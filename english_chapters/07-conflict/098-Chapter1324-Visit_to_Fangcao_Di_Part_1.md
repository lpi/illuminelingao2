# Chapter 1324 - A Visit to Fangcao Di (Part 1)

Upon entering the school gate, they saw a half-person-high stone pedestal upon which stood two life-sized statues. Most members of the delegation could be described as well-read, yet none could identify what deities these stone statues depicted. They could only see that the two were figures of young people—one male, one female—dressed in the uniform worn by Fangcao Di students, which the pirates called "uniform." Both figures were posed standing tall with chests thrust forward, striding ahead—the male figure with one hand pointing forward, the female holding a book roll.

Wang Ci examined them again and again. The scholars of Lingao had only ever seen the few temples in county and prefecture. He at least had come from the mainland and was more worldly. He had entered at least one or two hundred temples and monasteries, yet he had never seen statues like these. Setting aside the question of what these statues meant—which he couldn't fathom—the statues themselves differed greatly from any he had seen before. The lines of both the clothing and the faces were quite sharply defined, yet the appearances and expressions were remarkably lifelike. Wang Ci clicked his tongue in wonder.

Just as he was absorbed in looking, someone quietly tugged at his sleeve. Wang Ci started, only to find it was Huang Bingkun.

"Which deities of the pirates might these male and female figures be?" Huang Bingkun whispered. "Since they claim to be descendants of the Song, why would they worship these neither-Buddhist-nor-Taoist heterodox demons?"

Wang Ci shook his head: "These are certainly not orthodox worship!"

Yet beneath these statues there were no sacrificial vessels: no offering table, no incense burner, and such. Students walking past showed no "reverential and awed" expressions. The statues didn't appear to hold any sacred significance. Moreover, Transmigrator Dong who was guiding their tour had simply walked past them—in contrast, when transmigrators visited the county school, Wang Ci had wished he could recite the biographies of all seventy-two disciples of the Confucian school.

Though puzzled, he was reluctant to ask lest he reveal his ignorance. Most members of the delegation shared this mindset as they doubtfully walked forward. Only Liu Dalin asked Dong Yizhi what manner of immortals these two statues represented.

"These are not gods or Buddhas—" Transmigrator Dong said.

"Then they must be some illustrious worthies of Australia?"

"Neither," Dong Yizhi thought to himself that these two statues meant nothing at all. They were merely the creative work—or perhaps "plagiarism"—of some art-student transmigrator. The originals were probably male and female Young Pioneer statues from some Children's Palace, adapted to "this timeline" styling.

"These are not worthies. They represent the image of young scholars of our Great Song, the Australian Temporary Residence. One might also say they represent the image of our Fangcao Di students."

Though the delegation didn't fully understand the specifics, they roughly grasped that this was the Australians' ideal image of young scholars. Wang Ci examined the two statues. Both male and female were tall and robust in appearance. The male particularly, with his rolled-up sleeves revealing bulging muscles, and the girl with her sturdy calves exposed beneath her skirt hem wrapped only in form-revealing thin stockings and a pair of enormous natural feet—Wang Ci silently cursed: "These pirates are truly a crude lot!"

Such figures had not a trace of refined scholarly grace. They looked no different from laborers farming or doing manual work. Yet the expressions on their faces and the manner of their postures radiated that soaring, headstrong spirit typical of the pirates' unstoppable drive forward—like bold warriors. And these were supposedly the pirates' model young scholars in their minds. How laughable the pirates' vision was! No wonder the gentry privately gossiped that the pirates "couldn't distinguish noble from common" and were "crude and unlettered."

Each person in the party harbored their own thoughts, but outwardly revealed nothing, merely exchanging "after you, after you" courtesies as they followed Transmigrators Dong and Tang into the campus.

Walking along the cinder road into the campus, roadside trees had been planted on both sides. After several years, though not yet tall, they were already lush and verdant, interspersed with various flowers and shrubs that in the spring sunshine competed to blossom fragrantly. Here and there were placed a few rocks, a few benches—arranged simply yet elegantly, with considerable taste. Walking among them was quite refreshing and pleasant. The earlier unpleasant feeling of "crudeness" immediately dissipated considerably. The group thought to themselves in unison: "These Australians/pirates really know how to enjoy themselves!"

At the end of the walkway was the large athletic field with its 400-meter oval track. It happened to be the time when Fangcao Di's daily morning exercises were concluding and groups were dispersing. After completing the final few movements of group calisthenics, each class gathered into formation and returned to their buildings.

Students in uniform marched with regular steps and orderly formations toward the teaching building. Though there were dozens of columns moving simultaneously and the field appeared chaotic with formations weaving past each other, under the class monitors' leadership the complex formations proceeded in perfect order, and before long all had evacuated the field and returned to their respective classrooms.

"The Australians run their school like they run their army—truly impressive." Liu Dalin spoke half in flattery, half in genuine awe. The others were struck speechless—the impact was too great. Were these really students? They were first-rate soldiers! Just this display of formations expanding and contracting as they wished, with students moving as one body at the sound of commands—most armies of the Great Ming couldn't do this.

They had all witnessed Bofan Army reviews and drills and deeply felt that the Australians not only had "superior weapons and equipment" but excelled at military training. They hadn't expected the school to be run just like the military. If these students were a few years older and pulled out onto the battlefield, they would instantly become a formidable fighting force!

"The pirates' schemes are insidious!" Huang Bingkun thought to himself. Looking at the expressions on those around him—some grave, some wooden, some showing obvious delight—he couldn't help sighing secretly: The hearts of the people in Lingao County had already been half-bewitched by the pirates!

Seeing the Jasmine Pavilion party somewhat dazed, Dong Yizhi coughed once. "Distinguished guests, the daily morning assembly is over. Please follow me first to a rest room to refresh yourselves briefly, and then you may attend some of our classes." With those words, he again made an inviting gesture.

The rest room had tea prepared and waiting. The party sat down to rest briefly while Dong Yizhi gave a short introduction covering Fangcao Di Academy's general structure, academic system, and enrollment numbers.

After several years of development, Fangcao Di School had expanded into a comprehensive complete school with seven major educational departments: Junior Elementary Department, Senior Elementary Department, Middle School Department, Normal Department, Learning Academy, Professional Training Department, and Literacy Department. According to Fangcao Di's academic system, Junior Elementary was two years, Senior Elementary was two years, and Middle School was divided into junior and senior levels at 2+3. The four stages could be combined flexibly, with credentials awarded upon completion of each stage. Completing the entire course took nine years. This was roughly the basic system for the nine-year compulsory education that the Council intended to implement in the future.

Aside from the Middle School Department, which wasn't yet formally operational, all other departments were running effectively. The total enrollment exceeded six thousand.

By old-timeline standards, a six-thousand-student middle school was just an ordinary complete middle school—it couldn't compare to some of those monstrous county secondary schools. But in this timeline, when that number was announced, the entire delegation was shaken.

In this timeline's schools, whether government-run or private, aside from the highest institution of learning like the Imperial Academy, enrollment at most never exceeded two or three hundred.

Suddenly hearing that this school had six thousand students, for natives of this timeline who weren't accustomed to industrial-era numbers, the shock was overwhelming.

"There are actually as many as six thousand?" Liu Dalin asked in disbelief. He had long heard that the Australians practiced teaching without discrimination, assuming there must be some exaggeration. He hadn't expected it to be true.

"Indeed there are." Dong Yizhi nodded. "But this is still far from meeting educational needs. Currently there are still two or three thousand children who should be enrolled but lack spots, so we're preparing to establish another school elsewhere to meet demand."

"Transmigrator Dong, the Council is accepting this many children into school—what exactly is the purpose?" a gentleman asked. "This student has heard that most of these children are provided food and clothing by the Council, and not a penny is charged for tuition. Yet from what I've seen, most of Fangcao Di's graduates have become workers. Since they're becoming craftsmen anyway, why bother to have them attend school? Isn't the Council's approach superfluous?"

"Universal education is our basic policy." Dong Yizhi said. "Literate workers can contribute far more." He knew the gentry would find this point hard to understand, so he didn't elaborate. Just then, the class bell rang. He rose and invited them to attend classes.

Based on the delegation's requests and the school's instructions, the school had arranged a rich and colorful program. However, since they had come for an in-depth visit, attending classes was an essential element, making it the first course on today's menu.

Liu Dalin, Wang Ci, and their party were led into a Junior Elementary class and arranged to sit at the back together with several dozen children to listen to Dong Yizhi's lecture.

The teaching building didn't provoke much unusual reaction from the delegation—similar-style architecture was already common in Lingao. As for the large glass windows in the classroom, those had also lost their shock value—glass windows had become ubiquitous in Lingao. However, the densely arranged desks and chairs in the classroom left a deep impression: the blackboard at the front, the bright red slogan above the blackboard, the illustrated blackboard newspaper at the back, and the colorful posters on the white walls to either side—all embodied an atmosphere completely different from the traditional dim and tranquil study-hall style of schoolrooms. There seemed to be a more intense and more vigorous atmosphere in the classroom.

Sitting in the classroom, they could hear unified recitation from other classrooms—Wang Ci listened; it wasn't traditional primers like the *Standards for Students and Children*, *Thousand Character Classic*, or *Hundred Family Surnames*. He couldn't help feeling secretly disappointed. Sometimes there would be strange sounds like "ah," "oh," "eh," "yi" and such. Wang Ci, being well-read after all, quickly surmised that this was probably some kind of Australian "phonology" instruction.
