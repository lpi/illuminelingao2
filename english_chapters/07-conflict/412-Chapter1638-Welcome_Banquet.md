# Chapter 1638 - Welcome Banquet

Seeing that everyone was somewhat skeptical, Huang Binkun roughly described the various measures taken in Lingao since the Australians arrived, such as road construction, bandit suppression, water conservancy projects, clarifying land tax measurements... he rambled on about many things. The listeners were entranced.

After a long while, Liang Cunhou finally let out a breath: "Putting it this way, the Australians seem like capable ministers of a well-governed world."

Huang Binkun fell silent. He had inadvertently said many good things about the hair-bandits, which even he hadn't expected—how could he contact loyal and righteous men like this? However, he was unwilling to tell lies to indiscriminately disparage the hair-bandits' actions.

"The Australians truly have a new atmosphere!" Someone clapped and praised.

"Brother Huang must also be serving the Australians. Otherwise, how could you know so clearly?"

"Learning literary and martial arts, selling to the imperial family. Brother Huang is full of learning, just right to teach the Australians to understand the principles within."

"Heard that there are very few scholars among the Australians. 'Since ancient times, one can conquer the world on horseback but cannot govern the world on horseback.' It's natural for Brother Huang to be reused..."

Although they said "Brother Huang," in their hearts they all meant "myself."

Most of these scholars had small family properties, no way to enter officialdom, wrote average essays, and had bleak prospects for passing the imperial exams. Although they lived in the south, their news channels were much more informed than ordinary people. Seeing the court ineffective in suppressing disturbances in Shaanxi and Shandong, bandits everywhere in the interior, and Eastern Tartars knocking on the borders outside the pass... internal trouble and external aggression. The desire to seek fame and fortune had also faded a lot. The power of the Australians occupying Qiongzhou was just expanding—they had financial power and military power, offering a vague temptation to this group of people who couldn't see a future.

Those with some meager family property just hoped to connect with the Australians like Master Gao, selling Australian goods to get rich; those who were ambitious but penniless secretly hoped to join the dragon early and earn themselves immense wealth and honor.

It was just that they had absolutely no chance to talk to the Australians. Although there was a large Australian commercial port right outside the city gate of Guangzhou, the people busy inside were all local commoners. Moreover, Young Master Liang also said: In this dignified Great World, there were basically no True Hair-Bandits, all were their subordinates.

Among these people, if anyone could speak to "suspected True Hair-Bandits," it was only this Young Master Liang. The Liang family had close associations with Manager Guo; the largest local charity hall was jointly run by them. However, in recent years, the Liang family hadn't had deeper interactions with Manager Guo, seemingly deliberately keeping a distance. And with Young Master Liang's personality, asking him to build bridges for everyone was also quite difficult.

Now that such a Scholar Huang who was familiar with the "Hair-Bandit Situation" had arrived, everyone naturally treated him like a treasure. One by one, they desperately beat around the bush asking questions.

Huang Binkun laughed bitterly in secret. *What disciples of sages are these? Everyone is a profit-seeking fellow! The Great Ming hasn't fallen yet, and they're already thinking about becoming ministers who follow the dragon!*

"Although they are capable ministers of a well-governed world, they all have the style of harsh officials," Huang Binkun tried to switch to the topic of blackening the hair-bandits. "The laws are enforced strictly; the common people get blamed for every move. Even the gentry and scholars cannot be exempted..." As he spoke, he talked about the hair-bandits' various "misdeeds," such as being grabbed for hard labor for urinating anywhere, getting whipped for spitting... Of course, the most heinous crime was not giving preferential treatment to scholars. Not only did they merge the poll tax into the land tax, but they also wrote off the exemption from grain tax in one stroke.

Saying this did weaken the atmosphere of "Lingao is a paradise on earth" at the table by a few degrees. If nothing else, this "refusal to treat scholars preferentially" cooled down the enthusiasm of this group of scholars.

"As the saying goes, governing a large country is like cooking a small fish. With the hair-bandits acting like this, I'm afraid it won't last long. The lesson of Qin is not far behind!" A scholar sighed.

Huang Binkun was about to agree when Lin Zunxiu frowned and said: "If the laws are so harsh, wouldn't the people of Lingao have no way to live? How can it be said they live and work in peace and contentment?"

"Qin's collapse was not due to harsh laws, but the abuse of the people's strength!" Said one of the scholars, "The Qin laws were severe starting from Shang Yang's reforms. Why didn't the country perish then, but instead eventually unified the six states? It shows this is not the root of the chaos!"

This scholar looked very young and his clothes were shabby, appearing quite conspicuous among this group of *xiucai*: "I think the reason Australians can achieve such success lies in the benefits of severe laws and harsh punishments. Leaving aside other things, regarding the various abuses in taxation, could the Australians have eliminated them without severe laws and harsh punishments?"

"This is Wu Ming," Scholar Shi whispered, "He, well, isn't even a *xiucai*..." There was a bit of disdain in his words, "But his insight isn't bad, just likes to make shocking statements."

"Can't put it that way... Although abuses are rampant in taxation, the grain-tax households and gentry are the foundation of the court. Actions like the Australians' as described by Brother Huang, I'm afraid, will chill people's hearts." Someone was worried.

Then several people argued for a while. It seemed there were quite a few who approved of the hair-bandits' "severe laws and harsh punishments"—they were mostly from urban industrial and commercial owner families, having no vital interests in land tax, but attaching great importance to social order, thus greatly appreciating the Australians' various practices.

"Just take the fact that a few years ago the Australians passed troops under Guangzhou City and wiped out so many bandits. The four suburbs have been peaceful since. This is a tremendous benefit."

Huang Binkun secretly frowned. He stole a glance and saw that Lin and Liang didn't mind the increasingly "Ming traitor" remarks, so he just casually responded a few times. Aside from silently chanting "merchants are cold-blooded," he just talked about Lingao's local customs, things like big iron ships, small trains, even the appearance of Fangcaodi School, students' strange clothes, etc., keeping his mouth shut about why he came to Guangzhou. This caused the others at the table to click their tongues in wonder.

After the second round of wine was rewarded, Lin Zunxiu finally sighed and said faintly: "Sigh, Young Master Huang. Now national affairs are difficult, and refugees are rising everywhere. Sometimes, I actually want to sell this restaurant and, like the Australians, open a big big factory, hire these refugees. Upwards I can repay Heaven's favor, downwards I can benefit the common people." Huang Binkun pretended to nod seriously, putting on a look of deep agreement, while understanding in his heart that these scholars had already been influenced by the hair-bandits. He wondered if there were still any clear-eyed people in this County School who could see through the hair-bandits' treacherousness.

Just as everyone was pondering, the cook's voice outside rang out again: "Third round, Dragon and Tiger Fight!" Accompanied by the voice announcing the dish name, suddenly a miserable female voice came in from outside: "Master, please show some mercy, the child hasn't eaten for days, Master—"

Hearing the commotion outside, everyone walked to the corridor to look out. They saw a disheveled woman leading a five or six-year-old girl, bowing and begging for food everywhere in the outer hall of the restaurant. Diners either ignored her, pretended not to see, or scolded the waiter angrily. Several shop assistants were dragging this madwoman-like woman, pulling desperatedly outward. But she just wouldn't be dragged out. Everyone only heard the woman's frantic crying and screaming.

Seeing this, Lin Zunxiu just snorted, flicked his sleeves, and sat back in his seat. Seeing the host return to the wine table, Huang Binkun followed back. The group of scholars sighed for a while and also returned to their seats one after another. Only the chubby Young Master Shi took his own bowl, picked several large pieces of meat to press onto the rice, and went out of the private room carrying the bowl. Everyone sat in silence. Huang Binkun wanted to say something, but stammered and couldn't speak.

After a while, Scholar Shi walked back slowly: "Sigh, truly miserable, truly miserable. Man of the house died, kicked out of the house by the brother-in-law, hasn't eaten for days. Show some mercy. I let the mother and daughter eat their fill and sent people to take them to Manager Guo's charity hall." Scholar Shi rambled on, but no one at the table answered him.

Scholar Lin said: "You save them for a moment but can't save them for a lifetime. Just this bit of a matter counts as miserable? There are hundreds of times more miserable people in this Nanhai County of Guangzhou City! You might as well go see how many road corpses the charity hall collected today preparing for the crematorium. Even if you save these, there are thousands upon thousands of poor people in the eighteen provinces under heaven, can you save them all? People are eating human flesh in the Central Plains—in the end, they all become roving bandits, coming to find us for food with knives and spears. I think we might as well close our eyes and just eat, muddle through wherever we can, save the trouble of worrying about the country and people in vain!"

Once Lin Zunxiu's words came out, Huang Binkun saw the faces of all the scholars present turn white. The newly served Dragon and Tiger Fight was emitting fragrance, but not a single person was in the mood to move their chopsticks.

"Sigh, if I could open a big big factory, a big big cannon factory, not only would I make money and quell the chaos in the world, but the hired poor people would also have food to eat." Lin Zunxiu said leisurely.

Huang Binkun raised the wine in his cup: "Nowadays roving bandits are rising everywhere and Eastern Tartars are a scourge. Young Master Lin worries about national affairs and the court. I toast Young Master a cup."

"Hehe, the court? If I built the cannon factory, whether the Emperor or the officials, they should pay back the city redemption fees, happy donations, and happy contributions they owe me, right?" As soon as these words came out, everyone at the table laughed, and the atmosphere gradually became lively.

"Of course, my family doesn't have the money to open a cannon factory either. Hehe, selling these few restaurants wouldn't be enough." Young Master Lin said dejectedly.

"Come come come, eat eat, Dragon and Tiger Fight." The atmosphere at the wine table became lively again. The scholars at the table also gradually opened their hearts and their mouths. This one talked about how many shi of grain his family happily contributed back then; that one said that's nothing, our old man almost hanged himself to raise the city redemption fee—fortunately, Master Gao acted quite decently and managed to get it all back the next year. Otherwise, the salt tickets in hand would have become a pile of waste paper.

"Gao Ju, decent my ass!" Speaking of Gao Ju, someone else complained, saying that when the Purple Treasure Studio issued shares a few years ago, it was Gao Ju who created obstacles, so his family couldn't buy even though they wanted to buy more. When wanting to visit Manager Guo, it was also Gao Ju who slandered them and had people block them outside the door. Various liquor table stories flew about, making Huang Binkun feel somewhat annoyed with the chaos. But the scholars present were very curious about the Australians' affairs and insisted he speak, so he had to pick some novel things like hair-bandits building buildings and farming to talk about. On the contrary, Young Master Liang, although he didn't say much, Huang Binkun felt he had been paying attention to him all along.
