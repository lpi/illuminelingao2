# Chapter 1549 - Policewoman

His gaze fell on the clerk's face, and he laughed, "Shopkeeper, you speak well. Your establishment is indeed the number one inn in Lingao."

The clerk smiled. "You flatter us, guest. May I ask your surname?"

"My surname is Zhuo, given name Yifan."

"Long looked up to, long looked up to. Guest, please follow me. Just call me Li Xiaoliu."

"I wouldn't dare. Thank you for your trouble," Zhuo Yifan said very politely.

As they spoke, the people on the carriages had disembarked. There were several female relatives, dressed luxuriously, surrounded by maids and older female servants, circled by house guards and slaves—the full style of a wealthy noble household.

The clerk knew such households hated people looking at their women—General Manager Li had even hired female clerks specifically to serve them—so he didn't even turn his head, focusing entirely on greeting Zhuo Yifan's group.

Just as they reached the door, a sharp shout came from inside, and a figure flew out the door, landing heavily with a loud "thud," rolling twice before stopping.

It was a big man in black, face covered in dust, howling "Ouch, ouch," struggling to rise.

A black shadow flashed at the door, revealing a voluptuous, gorgeously beautiful woman in her prime. Her features were picturesque, lips like cherries, but her jet-black hair was cut short. She wore a black police uniform, waist cinched by a diagonal belt, emphasizing a slender waist one could grip with a hand.

The policewoman strode out, raised a willow-leaf eyebrow, and pointed. "You think this is the Ming? Still throwing your dog-legged lackey weight around? Let me tell you, this lady is in a good mood today, or for that grab just now, I'd count it as assaulting a police officer and blow your skull open with one shot!"

The big man struggled to get up, his face looking very defiant.

The girl scowled and sneered, "This lady coming to register your master's household residency was already giving General Manager Li face. Since you dare to be glib and talk nonsense, trying to take advantage of a Yuan Elder Court public servant, don't blame us for following procedure. Tell your master's whole family to come to the police station tomorrow to register. Big wife, little wife, unmarried daughter, newlywed daughter-in-law—everyone stand honestly on the street and wait for their number to be called! If you miss the deadline and can't register, don't blame me—you earned this for your master."

The burly man rolled his eyes, daring not say another word.

The policewoman dusted off her hands. Several servants and the innkeeper ran out. A steward-like man rushed out holding a red envelope, stuffing it into the policewoman's hand, smiling apologetically. "Officer, please quell your anger. He has eyes but no pupils and offended your distinguished self..."

But the policewoman bought none of it. She tossed the red envelope aside and left with a cold sneer. Even the shopkeeper who wanted to chase after her to mediate didn't dare approach.

The steward looked angry. picking up the red envelope and stomping his feet, cursing the unlucky devil. The burly man, face ashen, followed the steward indoors without a word, scuttling away like a rat.

People outside on the street pointed and discussed animatedly. Zhuo Yifan was also amazed: he had never seen the girl's simple and rapid strike technique. Not flashy, but very practical.

Zhuo Yifan whispered to the clerk, "Who is that?"

"A police officer from East Gate Market Police Station, in charge of order in this area."

"Police? A public servant?"

"Yes, locals call them Police. Checking into inns, registering residence, making ID cards—it's all their jurisdiction."

"If so, why was that man so bold? As they say, a strong dragon doesn't suppress a local snake, let alone a public servant!"

"You are right, guest. But where outside do women serve as public servants? That man is new and didn't know the score—he's a guard for Master Guo who arrived yesterday. Knows some three-legged cat Kung Fu. I heard Master Guo's third concubine often asks him to escort her when going out. Old Master Guo used to be an official in the capital; a card from his family worked with any official. Used to being domineering locally. Plus he drank a few cups just now; alcohol went to his head, and he made trouble for his master."

Though the clerk lowered his voice, there was a gloating tone. It seemed this family's reputation here wasn't good.

"That female officer's skill was truly high..."

"Guest carries a sword; presumably you practice martial arts too."

"Zither and sword and book box are scholar's essentials. I wave it around a bit for fitness; can't call it martial arts."

The clerk giggled and led him inside.

Qiongan Inn was meticulous toward these "Gods of Wealth" from across the sea. At ports with scheduled Dabo shipping lines—Haikou and Bopu—they had offices with special lounges and carriage teams. Wealthy families could rest there after disembarking, then transfer to carriages to reach East Gate Market.

Because female relatives of wealthy families generally disliked showing their faces, asking them to get used to Lingao's "queuing and number calling" immediately was difficult. Li Xiaopeng specifically asked his grandfather to lobby Chief Xiong, finally obtaining the "privilege" of police coming to register residency on-site.

Even the main gate's design was unique. Enter the gate, and there was a spirit screen. Around the screen was the front courtyard. Apart from the counter room, there were three entrances. The left and right entrances led to long alleys, with large and small courtyards scattered along both sides. The middle entrance also led to an alley, straight to the back courtyard: kitchen, carriage sheds, and warehouse for large luggage were there. To let wives and misses relax, a dedicated garden was built beside the inn.

The clerks led the group into the left alley. High grey brick walls lined both sides, making it cool inside. Narrow trellises along the wall base were dotted with green potted plants, adding life.

Black lacquered courtyard gates lined the alley, each with a plaque. The clerk took Zhuo Yifan to one, took out a key, and opened the door—no padlock, but a keyhole installed *in* the door. Very novel.

The inn had prepared two courtyards for them, one large, one small. The small one for masters, the large for servants. Though laid out as traditional quadrangles, the structure was totally different: first, heavy use of two-story buildings increased effective floor area ratio; second, it fully considered traditional wealthy families' segregation of men and women, close and distant, master and servant in room allocation. No other inn in Lingao could match this. Naturally few could afford it, but fortunately, guests here stayed for ten days or a fortnight at least, or over six months at most, so business wasn't a worry.

Zhuo Yifan and the steward took a quick look and were satisfied: rooms were clean, furnishings exquisite. And the legendary "Australian comforts" went without saying.

They settled in. As the "Eldest Young Master," Zhuo Yifan naturally had to handle everything. When wealthy families traveled long distances, they brought not just bedding but spittoons, tea cups, and candle stands—partly fearing outside things were unclean or unsatisfactory, partly fearing the inn wasn't fully equipped. So besides luggage, they brought many odds and ends.

Zhuo Yifan finished assignments and returned to the main room. A fruit feast was already on the table. Six large white porcelain plates were full of sliced fruits of various colors. Though only late spring, there was excellent watermelon. And many unrecognized fruits, red, green, yellow... colorful and mouth-watering just by look and smell.

There were two large glass jars. One full of plum syrup, emitting the scent of osmanthus. The other full of red liquid, smelling tart and refreshing.

Maids hurriedly took out the masters' tea cups, rinsed them with hot water, and used a new bamboo ladle to pour a cup for each master to cool off. They also wrung out brand-new towels Li Xiaoliu sent, soaked in cold water, for wiping sweat.

Li Xiaoliu was busy as a beaver, attending to everything, showing servants how to use courtyard facilities. Finally he came to the main room, standing at the door without entering. "Guest, for your heavy luggage, send to the back warehouse or move in here?"

"Send it all into the courtyard."

"Yes!" Li Xiaoliu asked again, "Would Master Zhuo please come to the counter to sign the guest register?"

Zhuo Yifan followed Li Xiaoliu to the counter. As a young master, he didn't need to write; an accountant served him. But their group of over twenty took a long time to report names, identities, and origins. When registration finished, Li Xiaoliu smiled apologetically, "Tomorrow police will come to register residency; we'll have to disturb you guests again. This is official business; please bear with us. This isn't the Ming; the Australians..."

"I understand. No worries."

"Yes, Master is considerate." Li Xiaoliu asked again if they brought large amounts of valuables. They could store them at the counter or call Delong staff immediately for deposit and exchange services.

"Silver was remitted via Delong. No precious valuables. But we only have silver; we brought few circulation vouchers..."

"The shop can handle that." Li Xiaoliu pointed to the wall behind the counter. A board listed today's exchange rates for silver and gold of various purities, and even copper coins.

Zhuo Yifan nodded noncommittally. With his status, he naturally didn't exchange money himself. After procedures, Li Xiaoliu presented a *Guest Room Facility Usage Manual*—since opening, equipment failures due to misuse had happened often.

Zhuo Yifan tipped the clerk with an envelope and went to his courtyard. Passing a courtyard gate, he heard someone shouting for mercy:

"Third Madam, spare my life! This slave dares not do it again! Ouch..."

Listening closely, it was the sound of a wealthy family executing domestic law. Amidst the slap of planks was a woman's shrill scolding: "Beat him hard! Break his dog legs!"

Zhuo Yifan smiled faintly and walked on.
