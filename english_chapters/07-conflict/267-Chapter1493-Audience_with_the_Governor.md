# Chapter 1493 - Audience with the Governor

"Look, this is obviously a weapon forged by pagans, yet stained with the blood of a Christian," the Chief of Police mocked: "Even if a fraudster, he was after all a fraudster who prayed before Christ."

Governor Juan Salamanca maintained silence regarding officials' gossip. After the servant took away the Count's gift according to his instructions, the Governor suddenly asked the Chief of Police: "Mr. Brambilla, I heard Count Vananois likes to hunt sitting in his villa, especially shooting monkeys; do you know about this?"

The police chief was greatly startled, unable to say anything for a moment. Initially instigated by Sanabria and other ill-intentioned people attempting to find out the Count's background and secrets in his residence, the police chief exhausted his wits bribing and threatening. He finally succeeded in controlling a Tagalog servant in the Count's mansion, but unfortunately, that servant vanished after transmitting valueless news only once. Until one day when the Count banqueted colonial officials, he inadvertently complained at the table that a greedy servant stole too much rum, got drunk, and jumped into the sea to commit suicide.

The internal route of developing informants failed; native spies sent to monitor the villa also had no harvest. Weiss bribed fishermen and farmers in surrounding villages; these suspicious strangers would be driven away as soon as they appeared in daylight. A few particularly desperate peeping toms would lurk until sunset to approach sneakily under cover of night; without exception, Special Reconnaissance Team snipers on duty in watchtowers equipped with night vision goggles and Mosin-Nagant rifles would deliver one or two bullets as a reward for their work enthusiasm and patience. Sometimes Weiss would also bring his FAL rifle to participate in this "low visibility moving target shooting competition"—naturally taking first place every time. What colonial officials heard were merely the Count's slight complaints at banquets—monkeys were rampant in Manila suburbs. To protect famous trees and fruits in the garden, he had to patrol the garden all night, ready to shoot monkeys climbing the courtyard wall at any time.

Mr. Brambilla naturally couldn't see the corpses of "monkeys"—their ends were all the same; whether killed by gunshot or seriously wounded, they were invariably tied to a large stone and thrown into Manila Bay. However, after dispatched spies went one by one without return, the Chief of Police finally realized his opponent wasn't to be trifled with. Moreover, as Count Vananois's reputation rose daily, this shady surveillance and investigation had better end early. But these shameful things were actually shaken out in public by the highest superior; the police chief instantly felt his hands and feet turn ice cold, at a loss for what to do.

"The Count has the right to accuse you of abusing power bestowed by His Majesty before the Colonial High Court, if he wishes. And I can also accuse you of dereliction of duty. Your actions squander precious financial and human resources on irrelevant places, yet indulge Dutch spies to act wildly in your jurisdiction. The numerous crimes they committed already threaten the entire colony, threatening the safety of all His Majesty's subjects. I would like to hear what you have to say about this!"

The Governor's angry rebuke echoed in the silent public hall. He didn't explode for no reason. Nearly a month ago, a strange fire turned Parian's largest cockpit into smoking ruins. It was the busiest twilight hour of the day; over three hundred gamblers and spectators, including quite a few Spaniards and European travelers, were buried in the sea of fire. Before the fire was extinguished, it also burned down dozens of Chinese shops. What troubled Governor Salamanca most was that taxes from cockfighting gambling had become one of Manila's financial pillars. The destruction of the cockpit caused the colonial government to lose thousands of pesos in revenue daily. This made the Governor, who spent money like water, furious—Baguio gold was brilliant, but mining and transportation had too many unknowns, incomparable to the cockfighting tax providing fixed income daily, which was reliable.

Before clues about the cockpit fire were sorted out, the wharf area on the Pasig River caught fire again. Many valuable Chinese goods just unloaded from ships and moved into wharf warehouses, which also stored even more precious Australian goods, were all torched. This time someone reported seeing suspicious personnel appearing before the fire started. Police Chief Brambilla arrest a large bunch of people indiscriminately; after extorting them one by one, he released most Chinese, throwing a few natives too poor to squeeze oil from their bones into prison as arson suspects to report completion of duty. Not long after, a terrible incident occurred where a convoy transporting military supplies was attacked outside the city. Survivors reported that although attackers were few in number, they were well-equipped and well-trained, obviously not done by native bandits.

Just as the whole city was panicked by one disaster after another, relatively reliable bad news came from Formosa: Dutch ships frequently appeared north of the island, attacking supply ships, even approaching the coast to fire at Spanish city defenses. Undoubtedly the Dutch were about to launch attacks on San Salvador and San Domingo. Although most Spaniards in the Philippines didn't care about those two colonies that didn't bring many Chinese commodities, bad news coming one after another somewhat changed the attitude of colonial military and political VIPs. Governor Salamanca's vigilance against Dutch invasion and dispatching spies as saboteurs seemed not so unreasonable, but a threat that could turn into reality at any time.

"My Lord," Zapatero reminded carefully in a low voice, seemingly interrupting Your Highness the Governor's temper tantrum was also a terrible thing, "The Count is waiting for an audience outside."

Municipal officials tactfully rose to leave, including the Chief of Police who had been slumped in his chair. The Governor called back the Parian District Chief: "Mr. Aguilar, I entrust the task of manufacturing saltpeter using feces to you. You can rely on the Chinese under your jurisdiction; it is said they have a tradition of collecting feces as fertilizer, which is very beneficial for completing your work and solving our current difficulties."

"Will definitely fulfill your entrustment!" Juan Aguilar shouted frantically, "I swear to Jesus Christ and you, guaranteeing with my honor, absolutely strictly not squandering even a copper of His Majesty's colonial treasury. However, managing construction projects costs money; please permit me to collect another community public fund from the Chinese."

"Permitted, but remember not to oppress them excessively. Chinese are still very useful to us. But you must watch out for those suspicious people; they are mostly spies sent by the Dutch. Once Chinese carrying weapons and firearms are found, do not hesitate, arrest immediately."

The ashen-faced Chief of Police, restless Mayor, ecstatic Parian District Chief, and others all walked out. Weiss Lando was guided in from another side door by a servant. The Governor noticed the saber was indeed missing from below the sash of his black satin cavalry uniform, only a short sword hanging there, with several strangely shaped Chinese characters carved on the hilt. Governor Salamanca was amazed at this odd characteristic of the Oriental colony; it seemed to have been conquered by Chinese and their lifestyle and national symbols. Even colonial Spaniards were accustomed to riding Chinese sedans in and out, never without a gold-flecked paper folding fan covered in Chinese characters in hand. The Governor disliked this fashion, especially unhappy discovering the visitor was sizing him up with eyes that weren't humble.

"Mr. Vincenzo," the Governor omitted Weiss's noble title and rank right from the opening, pointing to an armchair near the end of the table as he spoke. Weiss sat down unconcernedly; at least this position was close to the fan hanging under the ceiling. A Negrito dwarf squatted in the corner, feebly pulling a rope to drive the wood-framed cloth-covered fan blades back and forth—this was the only means of heat relief. Malacañang Palace, which Weiss visited as a US soldier back in the day, was still a piece of wasteland by the Pasig River at this time. Being received by the supreme ruler of the Philippines in a stuffy, dark room emitting a dank rotting smell without any etiquette or ceremony in this dimension, Weiss felt equally unhappy.

"Stinking Spanish pig," he cursed inwardly, though a smile still hung on his face.

The Governor continued in a cold tone used for subordinate officials: "I am very glad you took time to come at my summons, but I invited you to remind you that the Philippine colony enforces the Laws of the Indies promulgated by His Majesty our King, as well as our country's written codes and part of customary law. Regardless of which law, killing people in a duel is not permitted, you should know."

"Your Excellency, for an innocent man, your words are completely correct. But for a man deserving death, what difference does early or late execution make?" Weiss, hand pressing the knockoff Zhongzheng sword hanging on his belt—which he exchanged for a fine Toledo sword from a Senator—answered with composure: "Esteban Sanabria was a fraudster. He forged government documents and chaotic contracts, not only stealing and swindling property of law-abiding people but also blackmailing them. He tried every means to evade taxes, harming the state. He engaged in smuggling, even selling weapons and gunpowder to enemies of the Empire. He also committed crimes of murder, abusing and killing Filipinos, Chinese, and Mexicans who had converted to God to seize property. And he himself was a suspicious New Christian, even privately retaining Jewish lowly heretical beliefs. The Royal Prosecutor from Madrid told me petitions and accusation letters accusing Esteban Sanabria he received now pile up in his room at the residence. Shouldn't such a man full of crimes die? Isn't God killing this villain through any hand He selected all out of His divine judgment?"
