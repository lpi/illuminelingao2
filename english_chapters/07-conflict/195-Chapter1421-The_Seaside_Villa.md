# Chapter 1421 - The Seaside Villa

After parting from the treasurer, the red-flag carriage passed through the garden plaza in front of the Governor's Palace, drove through several streets and houses, and on the Count's orders exited the castle's south gate, heading toward the seaside. The road beneath the wheels would become, more than three hundred years later, Manila's famous scenic boulevard—Roxas Boulevard. In this time-space, however, although the colonial authorities regarded this road as a crucial military artery connecting Manila to the fortresses of Cavite and Carmona, and allocated funds every year for its maintenance, the road conditions were appalling. The so-called repairs amounted to shoveling a few loads of dirt into the ruts and tossing a couple bundles of firewood into the sinkholes.

The carriage lurched somewhat as it rolled over these obstacles, but did not slow down at all. The shock-absorbing leaf springs creaked beneath the body but held up under the test. The carriage drove all the way to a small bay surrounded by sand dunes. Behind the bay was a small fishing village called Malate. Looking past the small boats beached on the sand and a cluster of shabby huts, there were only two brick-and-stone buildings near the village: one was a church, and the other was a two-story villa perched on a slope overlooking the bay, surrounded by a wooden fence. It had been built by a former Manila city official for his sickly daughter so she could breathe the healthful seaside air. After the little girl died and the official returned to Spain, the fine building had fallen into disrepair day by day. Vince had not spent much to purchase it.

The carriage had barely stopped when Vince opened the door and jumped down. Shrek, however, dawdled on the rear step for a long time before finally clambering down slowly. Vince had long known that this seemingly strong black slave was actually pitifully timid. The swaying, bouncing ride of the speeding carriage had already frightened the wits out of him. Vince left Shrek standing there in a daze and walked straight toward his new residence. Both the garden and the villa had their gates wide open. The courtyard was piled with bricks and lime. The weeds and creepers that had covered the stone walls had been cleared away. Carpenters and masons hired from the Parian were busy repairing the parts of the building that had been damaged through years of neglect and, at the Count's instructions, giving it a fresh coat of whitewash.

The vegetation in the courtyard had been cleared—in the tropics, plants were incredibly aggressive; at the slightest reduction in human activity, they would quickly reclaim their territory. When he had first bought this villa, the undergrowth in the courtyard had been so dense it was almost impossible to walk through.

Apart from Mimi, who was inside the house supervising the workmen, there was a young man leading several local servants in unloading large and small wooden crates from an oxcart and carrying them into the house. These were all Vince's luggage, a considerable portion of which consisted of the various trappings the fake count used to maintain appearances—all purchased at great expense from Macao, some of them spoils from the Manila galleons.

The young man wore a newly made livery coat embroidered with the "coat of arms" of the Fananovoua Count's family. His hair was cut unevenly, with short stubble sticking up at different heights on his forehead like a dog had gnawed on it. This was undoubtedly the result of cutting his own hair while looking in a mirror; no one local would cut their hair so short.

This was already a kind of compliance with "organizational arrangements"—originally he had been wearing his Navy training uniform all the time. But on the matter of hair, the young man had refused to compromise and continued with this strange style.

Vince knew that this young man, who was desperately showing off and afraid others wouldn't know he was an "Australian Shorn-Head," was named Ji Mide—a naturalized citizen from a Chinese merchant family residing in Tonkin. The prolonged civil war in Vietnam had dragged quite a few Haiyang Chinese merchants into the abyss of bankruptcy; Ji Mide's father was one of them. Although they had not ended up losing both their lives and their property, the whole family had no means of livelihood—they couldn't even afford passage back to their ancestral home in Fujian.

Through introductions from acquaintances, father and son had found work at the Dachang Trading Post. Unlike his father, who only wanted to make a living, the exquisite Australian products had ignited in the young man an almost fanatical longing for "Australia." This passion had even moved Beikaï, the chief of the Tonkin Station, who sent a report to Lingao recommending that Ji Mide be admitted to study at Fangcaodi.

Because of his family's business, Ji Mide had learned to read, write, and keep accounts from childhood. Being clever and eager to learn, he naturally needed far less effort than most refugee-origin natives to obtain a Lingao Grade B certificate. Because of his age and specialty, he had enrolled in Fangcaodi's commerce vocational track. Near graduation, he was selected to join the Southeast Asian Company for an internship on the first Luzon trading voyage.

This internship—which everyone at Fangcaodi envied—played a not-so-small joke on the young commerce-track star student. He came down with tropical typhus, and with the complications, he was at death's door just as the fleet was preparing to return. Although he was out of danger thanks to the ship's doctor's treatment, a full recovery was certainly not going to happen in ten days or half a month.

The fleet could not wait any longer. A sailing trade fleet needed to return as quickly as possible before the monsoon season ended. But no one could take on the enormous risk of bringing a still-convalescent infectious-disease patient aboard. Oceangoing ships were already breeding grounds for epidemics; even the strictest quarantine measures might not prevent an outbreak. In the end, it was decided to leave Ji Mide to recuperate at the Cantonese guild in the Parian. Ping Qiusheng left him a supply of medicines and silver, and gave extra gifts to the guild headman, arranging for someone to look after Ji Mide until the next trading ship came to take him back.

Before setting out, Vince had learned from intelligence channels that he would "find a useful person" in Manila. After today's near-blown cover meeting with the informant, Vince decided that this young man—bursting with enthusiasm since his recovery and "always ready to contribute to the cause of Australia-Song"—really ought to be put to use. Leaving him in his house to do odd jobs all day was really too much of a waste.

Vince climbed the steps and strolled along the veranda for a few paces. Thin, dark Chinese workmen went in and out through the open front door, carrying buckets of lime and sawn lumber into the house. He followed them inside. To increase the indoor lighting, the first-floor windows had been enlarged, and a full-height atrium space had been added—a hole had been cut in the roof, ready for the installation of a glass skylight.

The newly installed Lingao-made shutters were all thrown open, brightening the originally dim living room considerably. Despite the good ventilation, the pungent smell of lime, lacquer mixed with linseed oil still made him frown. Mimi, however, didn't mind. She ran back and forth in the living room tidying up, nimbly dodging the falling plaster and paint. The swirl of her skirt and her slender young waist suddenly made Vince catch a whiff of alluring youthful fragrance amid the acrid air. He waved his hand, signaling Mimi to accompany him as he looked around. The entire villa and garden were a bustling construction site, with the sounds of hammering walls and nailing wood mingling with the clamor of the workmen. His bedroom on the second floor was largely complete. The walls still smelled of fresh whitewash, and the floor had been laid with Porto cork flooring from Macao. This type of flooring was durable, attractive, and resilient, and was very popular among the Elders in Lingao.

Furniture had already been placed in the room—old furniture from the original villa, which had suffered some warping from moisture during years of vacancy. Mimi had hired a carpenter to refurbish it all. Everything was very solid, all made from fine local timber.

As per Lando's instructions, the single bed had already been made up with Lingao grass mats, gauze mosquito netting, and a bamboo-bark cooling pillow. It looked very refreshing.

Just thinking of how the Spaniards in Manila actually slept on mattresses made him itch all over. He wanted desperately to take a bath.

But the newly built bathroom was empty—no fixtures at all, just a few holes left for plumbing.

"The bathroom fixtures won't ship from Macao until later. And the piping, too. But the people here don't know how to install them..."

"That's all right—installers will be sent along with the ship." Lando said. "Has the drainage culvert been completed?"

"The coolies won't come to work until the day after tomorrow—local coolies are in short supply right now, and the prices have gone up," Mimi took out a small notebook. "The foreman in charge says: everything here is going up in price. Even the timber."

Timber was something that could be found everywhere in Manila—as long as you could find enough workers to cut it and haul it back. If even that was going up in price, it could only mean that labor costs had risen enormously.

"A new bathtub has been prepared for you in the washroom downstairs—as you instructed, bought from the Japanese village. A temporary latrine has been set up in the yard. As for soap, bath brushes, and toilet paper, I found everything in the Parian. It'll be delivered shortly."

The Southeast Asian Company is doing well! Lando thought. At least he wouldn't have to write letters specially requesting these most ordinary daily necessities.

"All the windows must be replaced. These ridiculous shells must all be changed to glass." Filipinos liked to fit pearled oyster shells in their windows to block the scorching sunlight. Moreover, in earthquake-prone Manila, replacing broken shell windowpanes was far cheaper than glass. Even the Spaniards were not immune to this custom—especially since any European glass that survived the year-long voyage to Manila intact commanded exorbitant prices.

"Go to the Huang Ji shop in the Parian to buy glass. The Southeast Asian Company's glass plates are all marketed through them. And have them send a glazier over. No—I don't mean you. Have Ji Mide handle this. Remember to bring my card. And as for that fool Shrek—have him stand guard at the front gate in full gear! Off you go, my sweetheart."

Watching Mimi blush as she closed the door and left, Vince happily pulled off his sweltering boots. He did not lie down directly on the bed, but instead stretched out on a bamboo daybed he had bought from a bamboo shop in the Parian—he wasn't ready to take off his dirt-and-sweat-stained clothes just yet to enjoy the bed. With the habits he had developed on the battlefield, he quickly fell asleep amid all the noise.
