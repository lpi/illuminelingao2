# Chapter 1491 - Barter Trade

Based on the observed error, Hale re-adjusted the elevation and azimuth angles finely; other cannons also underwent corresponding fine-tuning and were loaded with live ammunition.

"Mr. Paul, it seems this cannon is not as accurate as you claimed." Observing with a telescope from the side, Zheng Zhifeng was somewhat dissatisfied after seeing the shell impact point. In fact, for these cannons to achieve such high precision at such a long range was already unprecedented in this spacetime. The gap between these and the Hongyipao the Zheng family bought with huge sums from the English, Portuguese in Macau, or Greek merchants in Manila was shockingly large. It was just that having witnessed the power of Australian cannons, Hale's shooting appeared somewhat lackluster.

"This is called calibration firing. In reality, after the first shell is fired, due to barrel temperature, operation technique, firing force, firing data calculation, weather conditions, and various other factors, it is very difficult to hit on the first shot. The purpose of calibration is to correct the artillery's firing data so that subsequent shells can accurately hit the target." These professional terms never heard before coming out of Hale's mouth indeed thunderstruck Zheng Zhifeng. For most Chinese at that time, firing a cannon was just pointing the muzzle in the general direction of the enemy and lighting it with a slow match. As for so-called gunnery, few cared, and even fewer truly understood.

"Hitting the target on the first shot is either God's will or guidance..." Hale stopped mid-sentence, looking at Zheng Zhifeng who was blank-faced and rolling his eyes, he couldn't help feeling he was casting pearls before swine, and continued: "In fact, general experience dictates that for insurance, two test shots are needed to determine the bracket error, then based on the error amount, it is easy to compensate and correct firing data; if the site environment and artillery performance are familiar, one test shot can also suffice, just like now."

Struggling out of a pile of unfamiliar terms, Zheng Zhifeng asked: "You mean, now you can definitely hit it?"

A confident sneer appeared on Hale's face: "Let us wait and see."

With a command, six cannons spewed fire tongues a *zhang* long, pushing shells out of barrels at speeds invisible to the naked eye, smashing toward the target. In the telescope, after three or four seconds, several balls of fire kicked up on the mound, followed by several thunder-like sounds a few seconds later.

"They are actually flowering shells [exploding shells]?" Zheng Zhifeng couldn't help sucking in a breath of cold air. Not only did most shells hit, but they were also powerful flowering shells that could explode! Could this be the rumored flowering shells used by Australians? The power was indeed extraordinary, and most rare was such precision!

After witnessing the crushing power of Australians using grenade fire against the fleet, Zheng Zhifeng held this weapon in high esteem—though he didn't expect to get this "weapon of mass destruction" from Hale.

European grenades had already flowed into China in the late Ming, but limited by the technical level at the time, the power of grenades was very small, playing no major role in land or sea battles, thus not valued by people. Only after the appearance of grenades filled with high-density black powder used by Australians did flowering shells become feared.

"Correct, grenades—or flowering shells," Hale said. "Although power is limited in land battles, in sea battles, once a wooden ship is hit, the effect far exceeds dozens of solid shots."

"Mr. Feng, are you satisfied with the goods this time?" Hale had a slight smile on his face, but his voice remained cold.

"Very satisfied; you, Paul, never break your promise." Zheng Zhifeng returned to reality from shock and fantasy.

"Our transaction?"

"Not a penny less. I, Zheng, also said, as long as your goods are good, your silver won't be a cent short." Saying this, he had men carry over two large chests filled with shining white silver. A sharp light suddenly lit up in Hale's eyes; he rubbed the silver with slender fingers, feeling the cold texture, then closed the lid and had men carry them away, saying: "According to our previous agreement, for the six cannons large and small, besides corresponding solid shots, each cannon comes with 20 explosive flowering shells. I will leave the firing tables and teach the gunners you sent until they all learn it."

"Pity it's a bit few."

Zheng Zhifeng calculated: if he installed such large cannons on his newly built three-masted great ships, how would the situation change? Let alone facing Zheng Cai brothers or Liu Xiang's Fujian ships and Guangzhou ships, even the great clamp-board ships [galleons] of Macau Red-haired barbarians would be blown to ashes! Although Australian ships could sail without wind, having such cannons could at least allow fighting on a relatively equal level, rather than being reduced to live targets on the sea.

After Operation Starvation, Zheng Zhifeng reorganized remnant ships, rushed building large Fujian ships using aged timber to fill the trade ship gap, while re-establishing a shipyard on Kinmen Island, purchasing dried timber at high cost to start building new specialized warships—the prototype of these warships was those unfinished improved Fujian ships Xu Ke found in the new Zhongzuosuo shipyard. These ships were the result of local shipwrights improving upon advantages of European ships.

Hale seemed to know what he was thinking, sneering: "Forgive my bluntness. If you continue to install these cannons I hand to you on those wooden boxes of yours, you still won't be a match for Australians."

Zheng Zhifeng was shaken. Although he wanted to refute Hale, the miserable state of the Zheng fleet's total defeat in Weitou Bay left him speechless. With difficulty, he said:

"We also have a few Red-haired barbarian ships, yet still no match for Australians..."

"Their ships suffered from inferior cannons. With my cannons installed, you can at least maneuver against Australians for a while. As for your wooden boxes—I advise you not to build them anymore; tearing them down for firewood earlier is more calculable."

"You mean?"

"Those Chinese ships you build, whatever name they face, I have observed carefully. Perhaps not bad as trade ships, but very unsuitable as warships. They have no decks, center of gravity too high. Cannons are hard to arrange. Your ships can only arrange three or four large cannons. Cannot form the power of a broadside salvo."

"To build Western ships, I don't have artisans versed in Western ship skills," Zheng Zhifeng said. "I have enough ship timber and many artisans; even building ten ships simultaneously is no problem."

"What do you think of the two-masted ships seen in Manila harbor?"

"Very good, but don't you think they are too small?"

"When the Australian fleet attacked Zhangzhou Bay, most were such light, fast small ships. Compared to your wooden boxes, they are of course too small. But their speed is very fast, enough to rival Australian patrol ships. And four large cannons can be installed on their small bodies." Hale made a gesture; a Tagalog servant brought a glass of red wine. "You should have seen Australian patrol ships."

"Yes. But they are powerless against Australian great fast ships..."

"You don't need to worry about this. As long as you are willing, I will soon build larger warships, enough to rival them. Of course, they will also be sold to you," Hale said calmly.

Zheng Zhifeng's eyes lit up. But he quickly realized this might be just drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. Even so, those light small ships equipped with Hale's cannons could at least play a certain role.

"Then what price do I need to pay?"

Hale laughed: "You truly are a first-rate businessman." He put down the empty wine glass. "Will your Anhai ships still come to Manila?"

"If I guessed correctly, your nephew Zheng Sen and Zheng Cai brothers will also send ships to Manila—after all, this is your largest remaining trade channel."

"There is also Japan."

"Unless you send a fleet to Japan to root out Australian power, otherwise I don't see what advantage you have in Japan trade. Leaving this aside. I think you certainly are willing to monopolize Manila trade—at least exclude those annoying relatives."

Zheng Zhifeng's eyes widened: if he could exclude these two competitors from Manila trade, Zheng Lian, Zheng Cai brothers, and Zheng Sen who lost financial sources would decline quickly; finishing them off would be as easy as turning a hand.

"Your conditions are..."

"You must send enough ships to Manila. In the trade season, at least four to five Anhai ships should arrive every month, the more the better..."

"How is this possible?" Zheng Zhifeng shook his head interrupting him. "Spaniards don't have that much silver to buy my goods."

"Spaniards don't, but I have large cannons, perhaps warships in the future."

"You mean," Zheng Zhifeng was somewhat surprised, asking in shock, "I can directly use goods to offset the value of ships and cannons?!"

"Correct," Hale said. "Of course, specifically which goods can offset will be decided by me."

"As long as they aren't too obscure things."

"You can rest assured; things I want are all easily procured." Hale pulled a page from his pocket. "This is the specific commodity list."

Zheng Zhifeng took it. Goods listed on the paper were indeed common things. Totaling over a hundred items, some Zheng Zhifeng himself didn't know what they were. Most important were pig iron, copper material, lead, mercury, and various metals.

"Things are not hard. But these are all cold goods; you won't get a good price selling them after taking..."

"Hehe, my dear friend. Your concept is a businessman from start to finish." Hale laughed. "You don't need to worry about my financial problems. The more goods you provide, the more weapons and ships I can supply you. Of course, you can ship and sell silk, porcelain, and groceries as you please."

"Good, it's a deal!"

"Finally, I need more population—they can also count as a kind of goods."

"Population?" Zheng Zhifeng hesitated, "Don't you know Spaniards are very wary of Chinese immigrants?"

Spaniards throughout Philippine colonial history always held an attitude of suspicion yet forced acceptance toward Chinese immigrants. And this time was only a few decades from the so-called "Chinese Uprising" in the Wanli era.
