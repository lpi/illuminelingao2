# Chapter 1289 Retaking Anping

Tong Tailang was dazzled by his words. This Japanese samurai had never thought that there were so many tricks in conspiracy and scheming, and he admired Qian Taichong even more. However, he was a little curious and asked:

"What are the ten major crimes?"

"As the defender of Anping, when the *Kun* thieves attacked, he ignored the safety of the mistress and the young master above, and ignored the families and clansmen of the whole city below. He abandoned the city and fled without firing a shot. This is the first major crime!"

"Correct!"

"When the mistress and the young master were in distress, he had neither a plan to defeat the enemy nor a strategy to rescue them. He sat by and watched without paying attention. This is the second major crime!"

"The General died in battle in the wilderness. He did not shroud the corpse, did not hold a funeral, did not remove his auspicious clothes, and drank and made merry every day, playing as usual. Being 'frenzied' like this is the third major crime!"

...

Qian Taichong listed them one by one, reading ten crimes in one breath. Each one was a very serious "crime" in the social environment of that time. If he really pursued these crimes, it would be light for Zheng Zhiguan's head to fall to the ground.

"Are we going to kill him?"

"If he understands reason, allow him to atone for his crimes." Qian Taichong did not intend to kill people—especially Zheng Zhilong's clansmen. This was a very serious matter in a patriarchal society, let alone that he was essentially an outsider.

Zheng Zhiguan himself was insignificant, but once killed, it would cause the Zheng clansmen to have a mentality of resistance and guard, and future affairs would be even more difficult to carry out. Although the Lord Governor supported him, his strength was the smallest after all.

"I am going to have an audience with the young master now." Qian Taichong said, "Report these matters to him."

Although Zheng Sen was only eight years old, he was already at an age where he could understand and remember things. Although he (Qian) was in charge now, the young master would grow up one day. The relationship between the assisting powerful minister and the young master ascending the throne at a young age had been very delicate since ancient times. If he could not handle it properly, he would inevitably bury the root of trouble for the future.

However, he did not go to see the young master immediately, but went to see a female servant who was currently responsible for taking care of the young master's daily life.

This female servant was also a distant relative of the Zheng family. She originally served in the inner residence of the Zheng Mansion and knew the young master. So after Tong Tailang took Zheng Sen and fled to Jinjiang, he was served by this female servant who had also fled here.

"I want to have an audience with the young master in a while. I don't know how the young master's daily life is recently?"

"Daily life is normal, but he hardly speaks on weekdays. He is silent all day long. In addition, the young master has refused to eat fish or meat. The servant girl is afraid that his body cannot support it." The female servant was very anxious.

So, the young master was very heavy-hearted, Qian Taichong thought. But because he was in an unpredictable situation, he didn't want to cause trouble to the people around him, so he remained silent. This ability to endure was better than that of ordinary children. Not eating fish or meat was mourning for his father. His filial piety was pitiful. In this way, the young master was a talent worth cultivating.

"I want to have an audience with the young master."

Zheng Sen was just eight years old. Like his father, he had handsome features. Because of repeated changes, he became very deep at a young age. Seeing Qian Taichong coming to visit him, he knew that this was the "Mr. Qian" who assisted him. Although Zheng Sen was young, he also knew that this Mr. Qian was running around for his status now. He only returned from Japan in 1630, and his Chinese was not very fluent yet, but he still reluctantly said some words to encourage "Mr. Qian".

After meeting the young master, Qian Taichong became even more confident. Immediately, he planned the plan to return to Anping with Tong Tailang and others.

The core of the plan was suddenness—although Qian Taichong was unwilling to kill, he could raid when not killing. He decided to take Zheng Sen into Anping City suddenly under the pretext of returning to the ancestral hall to worship ancestors on the day before the Winter Clothing Festival, disarm Zheng Zhiguan, and seize his troops.

The plan was not complicated, and there was a component of gambling in it. But Qian Taichong believed that the possibility of success was high. Although Zheng Zhiguan was also one of the Eighteen芝, he was mediocre and had no courage—this could be known from his desperate escape from Anping back then. Moreover, the news he got from the spies sent to gather intelligence these days: Zheng Zhiguan drank and made merry after returning to Anping, and rarely asked about government affairs. From this point of view, he was a person with little ambition.

In terms of strength, Zheng Zhiguan was also the weakest—he only had more than four hundred of his own personal soldiers and family servants. As for the more than one thousand hastily armed tenants, Tong Tailang believed that they did not have much combat power.

As long as his side acted decisively, Zheng Zhiguan's will would be easily destroyed, and Anping could be retaken completely without bloodshed.

A few days before the action, in order to paralyze the opponent, Qian Taichong sent someone to Anping to express that the young master hoped to return to Anping to worship ancestors on the Winter Clothing Festival—of course, it was rejected. The reason was that the ancestral hall was severely damaged and was still under repair, and there might be no place for the young master to live if he came back.

"Since this is the case, can the young master be allowed to send someone to deliver some offerings to express his filial piety?" The sent person discussed in a helpless tone.

"Ten people are allowed to come. No weapons are allowed. Come and return on the same day. Staying overnight in the city is not allowed."

"Yes, thank you, my Lord."

Qian Taichong believed that in this way, the Anping side would put their main vigilance on the day of the Winter Clothing Festival. So early in the morning on the day before the Winter Clothing Festival, headed by Qian Taichong, Tong Tailang led one hundred Japanese mercenaries, Cao Xiangjiao led fifty soldiers of the Governor's Standard, clustered around Zheng Sen sitting in a sedan chair, and with yamen runners sent by the Jinjiang Magistrate clearing the way, they suddenly set off from Jinjiang and went straight to Anping.

In order to ensure suddenness, the whole group did not rest along the way. The sedan bearers changed shifts without stopping the sedan, walking thirty li in four hours, and arrived at Anping City at noon.

Anping's city wall had not been repaired and still looked like a ruin. Because of limited troops, Zheng Zhiguan placed his main force on guarding near several key points such as his own mansion in the city. He deployed the main force in the place facing Zhangzhou Bay. In the place facing the mainland, only a simple gate tower was built at the original city gate, and some soldiers were sent to check pedestrians.

Seeing this group of people suddenly appear, the guards were at a loss—they had indeed received orders not to allow people around Zheng Sen to enter Anping, but the one who came was Zheng Sen himself, the general's legitimate son.

"We are escorting the young master back to the ancestral hall to prepare for the ancestor worship on the Winter Clothing Festival. Anyone who blocks the young master from worshipping ancestors is a disloyal and unrighteous person of the Zheng family," Qian Taichong rode on a horse and shouted, "Who dares to block?"

The Zheng army officers and soldiers at the checkpoint looked at each other hesitantly, not knowing what to do. Even soldiers knew what status the general's legitimate son had, let alone that there were people from the government coming with him. If they really started fighting, no one could bear this responsibility! Besides, there were only twenty or thirty people at the checkpoint, simply not a match for those Japanese mercenaries holding bright tachis and looking like wolves and tigers on the other side.

Just as everyone was hesitant, Qian Taichong raised his horse whip: "Escort the young master into the city!"

The Japanese mercenaries and the soldiers of the Governor's Standard unsheathed their long sabers together, forced their way through the checkpoint, entered Anping City, and drove straight to the Zheng clan ancestral hall in the city.

Zheng Zhiguan, who received the news in advance, turned pale with fright—he didn't expect Zheng Sen to come in person suddenly. Even less did he expect that he would drive straight to the ancestral hall. He originally thought that even if Zheng Sen entered Anping, he would first seize the original Zheng family mansion. Therefore, deployments were made there, and capable confidants were also sent. Instead, no troops were sent to guard the ancestral hall, only some servants were sent to sweep and guard it.

For a moment he was frantic. In terms of troops, he had more than two thousand people in his hands, and armed resistance was very easy. But he dared not lay hands on his nephew. Once he hurt Zheng Sen, not only would it be difficult to explain to the Imperial Court, but there would also be people within the Zheng Group using this as an excuse to crusade against him.

He gathered his family servants and hurried to the ancestral hall. Offerings had already been arranged in the courtyard of the ancestral hall. The Japanese Guard and the soldiers of the Governor's Standard stood solemnly in the courtyard, creating a chilling atmosphere.

"This is the Zheng clan ancestral hall. No soldiers are allowed to enter!" He was stopped at the gate by a Squad Leader wearing bright helmet and armor. Zheng Zhiguan could tell at a glance: This was a dignified regular military officer of the Imperial Court: A Squad Leader of the Governor's Standard Battalion.

Zheng Zhiguan hesitated: He was not the kind of daring person who dared to risk universal condemnation. Now Zheng Sen had already arrived in the ancestral hall, not only with his own armed forces but also with government soldier guards. The only way to solve it was to rush in and fight, then expel the nephew. This would ruin his reputation and doom him beyond redemption.

Besides, his few hundred family servants were probably not opponents of this group of tiger and wolf soldiers. Seeing the family servants around him flinching, Zheng Zhiguan yielded: "Fine."

On the first day of the tenth lunar month, Zheng Sen presided over the sacrificial ceremony of the Winter Clothing Festival in the ancestral hall in Anping as the eldest grandson of the eldest branch. Zheng Zhiguan was disarmed and put under house arrest. The ships, troops, manors, and property of the Zheng family originally under his control also fell into Zheng Sen's hands.

"Sir is truly a god-like man!" Tong Tailang admired him prostrate. Qian Taichong took them to capture Anping City and seize Zheng Zhiguan's forces "without bloodshed".

"We still have many things to do." Although Qian Taichong had the excitement of a small trial of his ox-cleaver, he still harbored great worries. Suddenly capturing Anping this time was certainly gratifying, but as a result, other forces would also be vigilant against the young master, and it would be difficult to act with such sudden effect in any further planning.

"Please give instructions, Mr. Qian!" Tong Tailang and the others were all very excited.

"The first thing is to hold a funeral for the General!" Qian Taichong said, "For this matter, I have to go to find the Lord Governor again. I leave Anping to you."

Qian Taichong went straight to Fuzhou without stopping, and reported the news of successfully capturing Anping to Zou Weilian.

"...It all relied on Your Excellency's prestige." Qian Taichong said as he presented the gift list.

The gift list contained four kinds of precious gifts, all of which were rare foreign goods. They were worth a lot. Zou Weilian nodded slightly: "Mr. Qian is indeed a great talent. I wonder what you plan to do next?"

"I beg Your Excellency to point out the maze!"

"I dare not, I dare not. If there is anything, please speak frankly."

"Qian is just a commoner. For many things, it is very inconvenient..."

Qian Taichong said without concealment: For the next plan, he needed an official position.
