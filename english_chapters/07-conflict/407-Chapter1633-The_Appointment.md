# Chapter 1633 - The Appointment

He ate lunch at the Trading Post Restaurant, then went straight back to Bairencastle. Liu Xiang first made a trip back to the Senator Apartment District. Although he was rarely in Lingao, just like rooms at the Kremlin, he still occupied a set of apartments.

Because no one had lived there for a long time, although the General Office's service staff cleaned and ventilated regularly every week, it wasn't suitable for immediate occupancy. So Guo Ling'er and their daughter were still staying at the guesthouse, and only the luggage had been brought over.

Liu Xiang looked at his apartment that he had never lived in. The furniture and such inside were complete, but there were no daily necessities like pots and pans. Apart from the things brought back from Qiongshan, some things still needed to be supplemented, and the hygiene also needed to be thoroughly re-cleaned... The General Office had already arranged all of this.

He had already thought it through. When he went to Guangzhou, it would be better to leave his family in Lingao. Once Guangzhou was "liberated," his workload would definitely increase tenfold or a hundredfold. Bringing his wife and child would be very inconvenient and would also be distracting. Moreover, without his adorable daughter around, he could take the opportunity to consider the issue of a second secretary...

After sorting out family matters, he immediately went to the Organization Department to report.

Ming Lang looked at this Director Liu in front of him, feeling very conflicted in his heart. According to organizational principles, the Organization Department had the greatest say in personnel appointments. But when it came to the class of "Senators," many organizational principles were torn to shreds. In particular, his Organization Department actually didn't have management authority over naturalized citizen cadres—those were all under the control of the Civil Affairs Department's Human Resources Division.

The result was that his Organization Department, like in the old spacetime, had become a department that just went through the motions.

The practice of "Organization Department expresses intent, Senators actively apply, vertical departments directly appoint, regional heads invite personnel" had already become the convention. Specifically applied to Liu Xiang, he was nominally just "returning to the capital to report on work." The one in the Qiongshan County Office was just a "deputy acting as manager." Although there was already an "appointment intention" for the Guangzhou Prefecture position, it still required respecting his personal wishes before starting the public announcement process.

The resolution for armed occupation of the Pearl River Delta region was only made in the last week. The original plan was the unattractive "underground government" model. Not to mention the full allocation mode, capital relocation, picking the peaches... these things that had been discussed on the forums for a long time were intimidating.

Although Guangzhou was about to become the most prosperous and flourishing region under the Senate's rule, its work difficulty would probably also exceed that of any directly controlled area. There were quite a few people who wanted to be lords of their own domain, but most people were still unwilling to do this pioneer ox kind of work.

After the intent to organize the Guangzhou local government was made public, there were few respondents. Some wanted to go but were obviously unqualified. Subsequently, Ming Lang had conversations with several Senators whose conditions were more suitable, but everyone who received the intent clearly refused. Tragically, the Organization Department was powerless to do anything about this.

Ming Lang got straight to the point: "Regarding the matter of adjusting your work position that the Organization Department proposed to you, how is your consideration going?"

"I obey the organization's arrangement." Liu Xiang nodded. Since he was going, he might as well agree straightforwardly.

Ming Lang obviously relaxed. He said nothing, just stood up and shook hands with Liu Xiang.

"Then congratulations to you."

"The burden on my shoulders is heavy." Although he had decided to take the position in Guangzhou, when he actually took on this job, he still felt a heavy weight on his shoulders.

"You can rest assured about this. Guangzhou is different from other county towns. It's the first major city under our rule, and the support given will also be different. Policies will definitely be adjusted as well."

"The new Guangzhou City Government—will it only manage Guangzhou City, or will it include the counties below?"

"Currently, it includes the counties below. But your work focus is on the two counties of Nanhai and Panyu attached to Guangzhou Prefecture City." Ming Lang said, "I can give you the inside scoop. Currently, the Executive Committee's thinking on local administrative institutions is that provincial governments manage counties directly. So after the situation stabilizes, Guangzhou will be listed as a separate municipality."

"That's good. Looking at the materials, Guangzhou Prefecture has fifteen counties and one sub-prefecture below it. Even taking away the attached counties, there are still fourteen county-level units. The burden is too heavy."

"You don't have to worry about this aspect. The Executive Committee has already instructed our department to arrange enough Senator cadres for you." Ming Lang took out a *Draft Organizational Outline for the Guangzhou City Temporary Administration Commission*. "You can take a look first."

"Is this the final decision?" Liu Xiang asked.

"No. As the highest administrative official in Guangzhou, you can express views on personnel. If you insist that a certain Senator cannot be appointed, it's not impossible to consider. Secretary of State Ma's instruction is that 'the first task of the leadership team is to maintain unity.'"

Liu Xiang opened the folder. In the draft, the "vertical departments" of judicial, taxation, police, political security, etc., either already had names listed or were annotated "to be separately selected by the Organization Department." His eyes passed over these names. Some people he recognized, some he didn't. However, since there were only so many people in the Senate, he knew a thing or two about each person's situation more or less.

"What about these positions without specific appointments?"

"As the chief administrator, you can recommend. Of course, whether to use them still requires the Organization Department's approval, and the person also has to be willing..."

Liu Xiang hurriedly asked the key question: "What about the people from the original Guangzhou Station? Can they continue working in the new team?"

"The same principle as above." Ming Lang added, "Guo Yi is not included. He has another assignment."

*As expected!* Liu Xiang nodded. But he still wanted to fight for it: "Guo Yi is our number one agent in Guangzhou. Will his departure shake the confidence of our business partners..."

"With your Guangzhou City Government to vouch for it, it should be fine." Ming Lang said, "To be honest, his continued tenure would be unsuitable for him and also unsuitable for you to carry out your work."

Guo Yi was the person in charge of the old Guangzhou Station. Now with a new leader above him, he probably wouldn't feel comfortable. As they say, "the first task of the leadership team is unity."

"Alright. Actually, I think he's more suitable than me..."

"He has repeatedly proposed not to continue as the head of the Guangzhou Station." Ming Lang said, "As for the other several Senators, I'm not sure if they will definitely agree to stay on. Tell me your specific retention requirements, and I will talk to them one by one."

"One last question. How will we be fed financially? Is it stirring the ladle in one pot, or each raising their own child?"

"This hasn't been finalized yet, so for now it's still the full allocation mode—"

"Damn..." Liu Xiang couldn't help but say. This bizarre full allocation system had been costing him dearly. It was practically forcing him to "run to the ministries." For administrative leaders who didn't seek advancement, this way of muddling through was effortless and carefree. But while this could work for a small place with less than ten thousand people like Changhua, it was very unsuitable for a big county like Qiongshan, let alone the future Guangzhou City.

"Rest assured. After the Third General Congress, a new fiscal and taxation system will definitely be established, and we won't continue with full allocation." Ming Lang said, "The Finance and Economy sector and the State Council have had several meetings. They're still working on the specifics."

"That's good. Otherwise, if even building bridges and paving roads requires central allocation, that's just too inconvenient." Liu Xiang nodded repeatedly. "Thank you for your trouble."

"Not at all, not at all. You're bravely shouldering a heavy responsibility here."

Coming out of the Organization Department, he returned home and quickly turned on his computer, browsing the posts on the forum. First, to see how the winds were blowing, and second, to check out the recent hot topics.

Apart from some posts that intentionally or unintentionally revealed too much, there was actually quite a lot of good stuff on the forum, especially some quirky ones. Because in this world, the transmigrators were the greatest prophets, especially with minimal interference in Europe, where the prophet level appeared even higher. Liu Xiang found such a post in a showing-off thread by someone from the Colonial Trade Department.

"*João, Duke of Braganza, known as 'John the Restorer,' married Luisa de Guzmán, eldest daughter of Juan Manuel Pérez de Guzmán el Bueno, the 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia of Spain, in 1633. Of course, our Colonial Trade Department wouldn't miss it. Even if we couldn't attend in person, the gifts had to arrive. I just don't know, when that exquisite sealed gift box finally reached this Duke's hands after a year of crawling through the Jesuits' hands, what expression he had when he opened it and saw 'And congratulations on the birth of little Prince Teodósio.' The mysterious Australians of the Far East—are they prophets or devils? Is the helping hand they extend God's guidance or the devil's temptation? Getting João IV to launch the Portuguese independence movement ahead of time will be the first flap of our wings in Europe...*"

Seeing this, Liu Xiang also couldn't help but chuckle. Si Kaide's side isn't easy either! Hmm... foreign trade... let me look... oh, found it.

"*Although our main export commodities have already made a name in Europe, the transportation strategy of our main trading partners is 'half-way' trade. That is, purchasing the raw materials we need from East African colonies and Indian colonies, exchanging goods, then stockpiling our industrial products in Ceylon (Portuguese-Dutch contested), Goa (Portuguese), Mombasa (Portuguese); the Spaniards stockpile in Manila, waiting for ships from the Americas...*"

"*The great Murad IV of the Ottomans is fighting fiercely with Shah Safi of the Safavids in the Basra-Baghdad region and has the upper hand. The successor to Abbas the Great performed really poorly. Historically, by 1639, he would suffer a complete defeat and cede Mesopotamia... Therefore, the British purchasing in Basra has been greatly affected...*"

*Looking at it this way, the anticipated shipping capacity bottleneck is about to appear! Seems like my tea clipper was launched at the right time! However, with this international situation, plus the Thirty Years' War in mainland Europe, couldn't the industrial side also develop some export models of munitions? At least we could help Europe phase out all those old matchlock muskets. If the Nanyang-style rifle is too advanced, I wonder if the flintlocks manufactured in Foshan would be suitable?*
