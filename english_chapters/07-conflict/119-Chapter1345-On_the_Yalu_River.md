# Chapter 1345 On the Yalu River

As for which part of Dongjiang would rebel, in the view of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, there were many suitable candidates, and the most suitable one was Shang Kexi among the "Three Shun Princes".

Although Shang Kexi was called one of the Three Shun Princes along with Kong Youde and Geng Jingzhong, they didn't have much origin other than both coming from Dongjiang. Shang Kexi inherited his father's career. His father was a guerrilla under Mao Wenlong. After his father died in battle, Shang Kexi inherited the troops and rose to the rank of Vice General. He was stationed on Guanglu Island. According to the factional division, he belonged to Huang Long's camp. Historically, when Kong Youde and others fled across the Liaodong Sea, Huang Long intercepted the rebels, and Shang Kexi contributed a lot.

When the Manchus broke Lushun, hundreds of Shang Kexi's family members were killed. logically speaking, he had a blood feud with the Manchus, but he took the initiative to cross the sea and surrender to the Qing in the second year after Kong Youde surrendered to the Qing. Although historical records said that the main factor for his surrender was that Shen Shikui, who succeeded as the Commander-in-Chief of Dongjiang, attempted to lure and kill him, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau believed that his surrender should be an outbreak of long-term dissatisfaction. And seeing that many Dongjiang generals surrendered to the Qing after he defected, Dongjiang's dissatisfaction with the imperial court had reached a trigger point. From this point of view, the main generals of Dongjiang defecting to the Qing did not need too much help, just following the trend was enough.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau decided to start with the discord between Shen Shikui and Shang Kexi.

For the Senators on the *Haitian*, who surrendered to the Manchus was the work of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, and they had another important mission to execute.

The *Haitian* gradually approached the mouth of the Yalu River. According to the map, they were already in the Dadonggou sea area at the mouth of the Yalu River, about fifty kilometers away from Zhenjiang Fort.

Although Mao Shisan claimed to be a military household of Zhenjiang Fort, in fact, the real Zhenjiang Fort had never been under the jurisdiction of Dongjiang Town. Zhenjiang Fort was briefly recovered only after Mao Wenlong's famous battle, and was taken by the Later Jin less than ten days later. Since then, although Dongjiang had entrenched itself in Korea and crossed the river to raid repeatedly, it had never recovered Zhenjiang Fort.

On the Yalu River in 1633, after the Dingmao Barbarian Disorder and Mao Wenlong's execution, the garrison and settlers of Dongjiang Town actually ceased to exist. Zhenjiang Fort military households like Mao Shisan were all stationed on the islands around the mouth of the Yalu River.

"Lower the pilot boat. First level combat readiness for the whole ship!"

With this command, the *Haitian* lowered a small boat, then slowly entered the Yalu River at a speed of three knots under the guidance of the small boat. The navigation capacity of the lower reaches of the Yalu River was acceptable. In 1910, 1000-ton ships could still sail directly to the coast of Sinuiju. The *Haitian*, with a full load displacement of only a few hundred tons, would have no problem sailing to the river surface off Zhenjiang Fort as long as it proceeded carefully.

The river surface was wide, but siltation was relatively serious. Many large and small islands were distributed on the river. Most of these islands were once settlements and military farms of the Dongjiang Army. When Nurhaci was alive, the Later Jin had launched mopping-up operations many times, expelling the garrison soldiers and burning crops. Now these islands had completely become uninhabited islands. Only abandoned fields and dilapidated houses remained.

Both banks of the Yalu River were also full of dilapidated scenes. In the past, there used to be quite dense population and large areas of cultivated land here.

Due to Dongjiang's harassment tactics, the Later Jin moved all the residents originally along the coast of Zhenjiang Fort to the inland. Therefore, except for the surroundings of a few Later Jin settlements, this place had become uninhabited. It had purely become a military garrison area. As for Uiju of Korea on the opposite bank, it was also looted by the Manchus during the Dingmao Barbarian Disorder and became a lifeless place.

Soon after the *Haitian* entered the mouth of the Yalu River, it was discovered by various Later Jin forts on the shore, and black smoke began to rise from the beacon towers. Xue Ziliang could see people and horses active around the forts through the telescope.

Zhenjiang Fort soon appeared in the field of vision. The history of Zhenjiang City was very long. It was the site of Laiyuan City in the Liao Dynasty, the seat of Posu Prefecture in the Jin Dynasty and Posuo Prefecture in the Yuan Dynasty. In the Ming Dynasty, it was called Jiulian City because its site had "nine connected camps". In the 24th year of Wanli (1596), in order to strengthen the border defense of Liaodong, the Ming court "built a new city on the old site of Jiulian". In October of the same year, the Changdian Defense Command was changed to a Guerrilla Command and moved to this city, coordinating with the Kuandian Participating General's camp. Because the purpose of building this city was to guard the eastern fortress and protect the safety of the river and sea, it was named "Zhenjiang" (Guarding the River).

It leaned against Zhendong Mountain in the north, faced Hengdao River in the west, was separated by the right branch of the Ai River in the south, and bordered the Yalu River in the west, with Uiju of Korea on the opposite bank. Its strategic position was very important—it was not only a transportation hub between the Ming Dynasty and Korea, but strategically shielded the four guards (Jinzhou, Fuzhou, Haizhou, Gaizhou) in the south and looked after Korea in the east. It was an important strategic support point for Liaodong defense.

Looking through the telescope, the scale of the entire Zhenjiang Fort was quite impressive. The whole city was square with a perimeter of 1040 meters. All defense facilities were complete, and the watchtowers were stern. After the Later Jin expelled the Dongjiang Army and reoccupied this place, they stationed 300 Manchu soldiers and 1000 Mongol soldiers here, and dispatched 4 Manchu and Mongol officials each for defense, which could be called heavily guarded. As soon as the *Haitian* appeared, all four gates here were tightly closed and they were waiting in full battle array.

That night, the *Haitian* anchored at a deserted island in the river opposite Zhenjiang Fort. According to the map, this island should be Duozhi Island of Korea. For safety, the marines landed to search. There were no inhabitants on the island, but there were traces of cultivation, probably the Dongjiang Army had once stationed and farmed here.

The island was full of white bones, especially on the river beach facing Uiju of Korea, where white bones almost covered the beach. In August 1624, the Later Jin raided the Ming troops who were farming and harvesting grain on the island. The Ming officers and soldiers were panic-stricken and fled in scramble. More than 500 heads were cut off alone, and the remaining Ming troops scrambled for boats to cross the river, and most of them fell into the water and drowned. The skeletons all over the ground were exactly left by the Dongjiang soldiers and civilians at that time.

"So tragic," Huang Hua said standing on the barren river beach. He seemed to have fallen into some kind of contemplation.

"We are finally going to deal with the Wild Boar Skins." Wang Ruixiang patted Huang Hua on the shoulder and said meaningfully, "As long as you know what kind of goods they are—it's up to you next."

Huang Hua took a deep breath: "No problem. I am a businessman."

***

Considering that the garrison and defense officials of Zhenjiang Fort would definitely take action the next day—whether fighting or sending envoys, the ultimate purpose of the *Haitian*'s visit was to send Huang Hua ashore to establish contact with the Later Jin. Therefore, Huang Hua must be prepared to land the next day.

Gifts and trade samples prepared for Huang Taiji and others were piled up in the cabin. The most striking one was a gorgeously decorated Western-style two-handed heavy sword.

"It's really a good sword, just don't know if Huang Taiji can appreciate it. Casting pearls before swine." Wang Ruixiang couldn't help but pull the sword out. "Hope this deal is worth it..."

This sword itself was not strange, nothing more than being cold-forged by machine with tool steel, but the modeling and decoration were extremely luxurious. Not only were the hilt, guard, and scabbard inlaid with gold and silver, but even the blade itself was inlaid with various decorations—these were all made by the master craftsmen of Zhimingzhai.

Originally, some Senators wanted to get some radioactive luminous bodies on this "Sword of Kings" to let Huang Taiji die sooner, but considering that radioactive elements were not easy to process and setting up a supporting production line for such a sword was really not cost-effective. In case something went wrong, they might kill themselves first.

"How is Huang Taiji going to hold this thing?" Huang Hua couldn't help asking. he was a bit worried about whether his gift suited the customer's appetite.

Wang Ruixiang said indifferently: "He doesn't need to hold it himself, just let his attendant carry it."

"I don't think he necessarily likes it..."

"Hehe, this sword is just meant to be a stepping stone. Once you send up the samples you brought, he will definitely treat you as a guest of honor, and maybe even give a hugging courtesy," Wang Ruixiang said.

The trade goods prepared for the Manchus took a lot of brains. The economic state of the Manchus was very desperate. The domestic production level was low, and they were in a state of material shortage for a long time. Prices of everything soared. Except for ginseng and furs, they could hardly bring out any bulk trade goods. And these things were meaningless to the Senate—except for being re-export trade goods.

As for horses, various metals, and population that the Senate needed most urgently, although the Manchus had the ability to supply them, they were strategic materials after all—the Manchus needed these themselves too.

Being short of materials and lacking sufficient payment means—so Huang Taiji had always kept a tight watch on import and export trade. Goods unrelated to people's livelihood and national use were basically prohibited from import. Tobacco, which the trade port had thought about before, was just one example.

As for luxury goods and enjoyment items used by the upper layer of the Eight Banners, they could be largely satisfied by looting and a small amount of import. The Senate obviously found it difficult to sell them in large quantities.

For the Manchus, the goods they needed to import most were grain, followed by iron products and cloth. And for these goods, the Senate's own demand was also huge, and some even had to be imported in large quantities.

After many discussions by the Planning Institute, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, the final export goods decided were mainly cloth, paper, and salt, adding tea, strong liquor, finished medicines, etc., according to the characteristics of the Later Jin.

In addition, after discussion, the Senators believed that given the extreme conservatism of the Manchus in foreign trade, to make the Manchus loosen their mouths and be willing to sell their kidneys for it—exporting materials that they themselves urgently needed, they must bring out some genuine goods to move their high-level officials.

Therefore, in the catalog of goods about to be displayed to Huang Taiji, the last column "Weapons" listed goods they could not refuse. Some goods appeared in the export catalog for the first time.

After careful consideration, the weapons exported to the Manchus, in addition to bows and arrows produced on Jeju Island, added armor made in Lingao.

Because the Eight Banners had few people but strong combat power, the Manchus valued soldier protection the most. Eight Banners soldiers all wore heavy armor, some even wore double heavy armor. Compared to the inferior iron armor equipped by the Ming combat soldiers, theirs was much better made. There were many examples in battle where being hit by a dozen arrows did not matter, and they even had considerable protection against the shooting of inferior light firearms of the Ming army.
