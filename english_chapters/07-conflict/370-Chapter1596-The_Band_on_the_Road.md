# Chapter 1596 - The Band on the Road

According to the situation they had grasped beforehand, except for the group in Nanbao which had not yet been arrested, all four groups of the enemy had been surrounded and annihilated.

Photos of the corpses and captives were being developed at top speed to be compared with the photos in the surveillance records. So far, there were about fifty people on the list. However, not everyone had been photographed.

Since there were people who hadn't been photographed, there must be others who hadn't been discovered. Their existence was a huge hidden danger to the Senate: the attack on the *Xiaocang* was an action that exceeded the expected scope. This point made Wu Mu very worried.

The most critical thing was that there was no news of the capture or killing of the primary figures yet.

"Alright! Is everyone ready? All units line up and get on the vehicles!"

Okamoto, the head of the Art Troupe, shouted into a tin megaphone. In front of him were the neatly dressed members of the Folk Orchestra.

Today was the day of the dress rehearsal for the Cultural Festival. The entire staff of the Art Troupe had assembled and lined up in the compound of the Propaganda Department early in the morning. Even Deputy Director Dongfang, who always got up late, arrived early. The dressing rooms in the gymnasium were limited in size, so the musicians had put on their costumes beforehand.

Various equipment was packed in boxes and strapped onto public carriages borrowed from the bus company. The naturalized citizen musicians would also take carriages to the gymnasium. According to the previous security deployment of the Political Security Bureau, the four Senators would ride in the Dongfeng official carriages specially dispatched by the General Office. In addition to the coachman armed with a pistol, each carriage was equipped with a guard soldier carrying a double-barreled shotgun, and a squad of troops was sent to follow the vehicles for protection.

Except for Okamoto, who was not going on stage, the other three Senators all wore performance costumes—custom-made for them by Hong Huangnan, using linen fabric to adapt to the weather in Hainan.

Liu Shuixin was still radiant and graceful. Nan Gonghao looked dashing in a well-tailored long shirt, with a white bow tie that was an original item from the old timeline. Only Dongfang Ke looked slightly bloated and uncoordinated in his upper body because he wore a stab-resistant vest inside—fortunately, he wasn't fat to begin with.

"Wearing this for a rehearsal, you really are full of paranoia!" This was Okamoto complaining about his partner, but he only received a roll of the eyes in return.

Nan Gonghao also carried a stab-resistant vest with him, preparing to put it on before going on stage. Lingao was too hot, and he felt he couldn't stand running around wearing such a thing.

The group sat down in the carriage. Just as the driver was about to crack the whip to urge the horses, a figure ran in from outside the compound gate.

"Chief, Chief Okamoto—" The person shouted while running. Sharp-eyed Okamoto had already recognized that it was Wang Qisuo, a soldier of the Garrison Battalion and the chief erhu player of the Folk Orchestra.

"Qisuo?? Why did you come back suddenly? Weren't you escorting the Little Senator to the gymnasium?" Okamoto asked the soldier in front of him in confusion.

"Sigh... That Chief Little Qian wouldn't let me on their boat. She said... said they are a female sailor team, and men are not allowed on... So I had to come back..." Wang Qisuo answered bashfully.

"What boat? What is this all about? So you were sent back by Little Qian? Heavens..." Okamoto thought that this ABC little girl was really feisty, sending away a guard casually. This matter should reasonably be reported to the General Office, but he felt that it was none of his business. Now that he didn't have a PHS, it was very inconvenient to report. He decided to call the General Office after arriving at the gymnasium.

Qian Duoduo and the others shouldn't be in any danger taking a boat. He immediately called Wang Qisuo to get on the carriage and squeeze with the guards, and the convoy set off under the guidance of a lead vehicle flying a special flag.

The road along the Wenlan River was not wide, and to accommodate the heavily loaded vehicles carrying equipment, the convoy's speed was not fast. The Senators chatted in the carriage, the topic nothing more than complaining about the current situation.

After the convoy left the security zone, it sped up. Suddenly, a strange sound came from the distance, followed by another, and then another in an instant.

"Is this? Gunshots?? What happened??!! Guards!" Okamoto called the guards in astonishment. Nan Gonghao and Liu Shuixin also changed their expressions. Dongfang Ke, leaning in a corner of the carriage, had no expression of surprise at all, only saying: "This seems to be coming from the direction of the riverside, not the gymnasium direction."

No one cared where the gunshots came from, because gunshots should not have sounded here and now. With sharp whistles, the convoy stopped. The soldiers on the lead vehicle had already disembarked. Led by the squad leader, they spread out in a fan shape to monitor both sides of the road. Other security personnel also held guns in their hands, guarding the flanks of the Senators' carriages. Okamoto also wanted to get out of the car to check but was stopped by the guard on the carriage: "Chief, please stay in the car to avoid accidents."

At this moment, the captain of the guard trotted over, climbed onto the running board, and reported to Okamoto: "Report to the Chief, there is an abnormal situation about one kilometer ahead. A large number of naturalized citizens are scattering and fleeing. According to the safety plan, the convoy will pause its advance. A soldier has been sent forward to scout the situation. Chiefs, please pay attention to safety and do not leave the carriage!"

Before Okamoto could speak, Dongfang Ke looked up and said: "Sergeant! Immediately send a soldier to run back to the sentry post at the gate of Bairen City to report the situation of our convoy and ask if the superiors have new instructions. Then move the convoy off the road and restrain the musicians on the carriages behind, don't let them scatter."

The naturalized citizen sergeant of the Garrison Army paused for a moment, still loudly replied "Yes, Chief!", saluted, and left.

Nan Gonghao, whose face was already as pale as his shirt, stammered at this time: "This... what is the situation... How about we turn around and go... go back... to Bairen City..."

"No need, let's wait until the situation is clear. We didn't bring portable communication tools. Gunshots mean there must be an emergency." Dongfang Ke remained expressionless, but his speech speed obviously increased. After speaking, he began to unbutton his shirt.

"What are you doing?" Okamoto stared wide-eyed at this colleague who had always been a maverick.

"Obviously taking off clothes," Dongfang Ke quickly took off his performance costume, pulled off the stab-resistant vest, and handed it to Liu Shuixin, who had been sitting silently since the car stopped. "Teacher Liu, you put it on. Nan Gong, give the one in your bag to the coachman in front."

"Wh... what? Are you joking?" Nan Gonghao was about to open his backpack to take out his own stab-resistant vest to wear when he heard this request and was a bit stunned.

"In case of any accident, the four of us and those two soldiers don't know how to drive a carriage. Give it here." Saying that, he snatched Nan Gong's backpack.

"I don't need it. I'm safe hiding in the carriage." Liu Shuixin's face was a bit pale, but she refused his kindness. "Give it to the guard. They have to go into battle directly."

"Hey! You, yes you, turn around, take this and put it on!" Dongfang Ke said to the driver who was already standing by the car on alert. The coachman employed by the General Office had also undergone military training and various training for emergencies. He was calm at this time, only saying "I dare not, I dare not" repeatedly when receiving the vest.

At this time, the noise approached the convoy. The captain returned, climbed onto the window ledge again, and reported to the Senators: "Chiefs, it has been confirmed that a shooting incident occurred at the pier ahead. It seems that enemies attacked a boat and were killed at the pier. Now the situation on the surrounding streets is chaotic, and a large number of naturalized citizens are fleeing. I saw people from the Public Security Army sealing off various intersections. Please decide: should the convoy turn around and return to Bairen City?"

The few artist Senators looked at each other. They didn't quite understand the current situation. After a short while, Head Okamoto spoke up and discussed with his colleagues: "How about measuring the surrounding situation first? If there is danger, resolve it immediately? Then, we go directly back and look for a sentry post in the city?"

While hesitating, teams of Garrison Battalion soldiers and police were rushing to various intersections according to the plan on the main road.

The other three Senators hesitated for a moment and nodded in agreement with the decision to turn back. Since a terrorist attack had occurred, the order around the gymnasium would definitely be chaotic. Going there rashly would disrupt the formation and cause trouble for the law enforcement agencies handling the situation.

So the huge convoy began to turn around slowly collectively. Fortunately, the riverside of the Wenlan River was not like the downtown area—the downtown area didn't have such spacious places—and it took a lot of effort to reorganize the team. Half of the garrison soldiers got out of the cars and formed a hollow square formation to surround the Senators' carriages. At this time, a stream of people surged from the South, seemingly coming from the direction of the gymnasium square, with people of various colors in indigenous and naturalized citizen attire running wildly with noisy sounds.

"Approaching the Senator convoy is prohibited!" Several soldiers stood on the carriage running boards and shouted loudly, but the chaotic crowd didn't seem to hear what they said. In desperation, the guard captain ran to the end of the team and stood still, fired three shots into the sky, and then shouted again: "Fix bayonets!"

All the shotguns of the guard team were instantly fitted with bayonets. The shiny bayonets and warning shots dispersed the crowd rushing over.

"Chief, in my opinion, let our carriages go along the riverside, and let the brothers walk on the main road to protect us. This is safer." Wang Qisuo, who had been standing beside the coachman, suddenly spoke up. The Senators nodded skeptically. Indeed, this could reduce the possibility of spies mixing in the crowd and getting close.

The convoy moved slowly due to the unclear enemy situation. A squad of guard troops was stretched thin in this situation. The guards on the carriages also got off to increase the foot patrol force.

The soldier sent to report and get reinforcements was nowhere to be seen, which increased the doubts and vigilance of the Senators and naturalized citizen officers and soldiers. The three men had already taken out their pistols long ago.

"I haven't fired this thing for a long time." Okamoto held the Glock, his body trembling slightly. "How many meters do I have to be to hit the target?"

"Theoretically, the closer the better." Dongfang Ke had already left his seat and was half-kneeling by the carriage window, looking out. He held a S&W 9mm revolver. Benefiting from his study abroad in the United States back then, he was not a blank sheet of paper when it came to pistol shooting.
