# Chapter 1489 - Collaborator

"But we absolutely cannot underestimate this guy; he is a thorough pragmatist. Look at the contact fuze he designed," Lin Shenhe said. Weiss managed to bribe some Spanish officers to steal several shell fuzes manufactured by Hale under the name of scrap, letting the *Haiqi* specially transport these dangerous goods back to Lingao for disassembly and analysis. "The structure is terrifyingly simple; except for a setback spring, there is no safing and arming mechanism. The key is it doesn't need any complex craftsmanship or many skilled artisans, very suitable for the production level of that half-assed factory in Manila. At least it fires relatively reliably. Compared to the standard Type Liu-1 fuze produced by Bopu Factory, the effective rate tested on medium-hardness soil is only eight percent lower, performing quite well. As for safety, excluding our products, what type of grenade fuze in the 17th century needs to consider safety performance?"

The atmosphere in the venue turned grave again. Xu Ke, who hadn't spoken, opened his mouth: "Based on import material data combined with intelligence from other channels, it can be basically determined that Philippine authorities currently do not possess the ability to self-produce pig iron." He found several photos from the documents, "Data from the Great Library indicates early Philippine iron smelting industry was closely related to technology spread by Chinese immigrants. Until the early 20th century, blast furnaces used locally were still the trumpet furnaces appeared in Fujian in the late Ming. However, according to the Manila Station report, neither Hale's factory nor other places have revealed similar equipment."

"If personnel infiltrating Hale's factory melting workshop didn't see wrong," Xu Ke dug out some more pictures, sketches drawn by the Intelligence Bureau based on Ji Mide's descriptions, "Pig iron ingots and scrap iron are unloaded from ships at the port directly to the factory wharf along the river. Melting equipment includes a crude ground furnace; Chinese workers use traditional Chinese puddling method to puddle wrought iron, supplying forging and rolling machines. There are also two cupolas for casting special castings, very common in current Europe. The core of the casting workshop is three reverberatory furnaces. According to Manila Station's description, some may be used to melt copper, but mainly used to melt iron."

"There is a relatively small reverberatory furnace where workers are often seen tonging out red-hot clay pots, pouring red-hot molten metal from pots into trough molds. Intelligence agents witnessed workers loading weighed iron filings, crushed small iron blocks, charcoal granules, and cut iron bars into each clay pot before entering the furnace, putting 12 pots into the furnace door each time. We infer this is producing crucible steel; the process seems close to Krupp's method. But output isn't large. The main function of these reverberatory furnaces is still refining pig iron of different sources and greatly varying quality. Hale's factory cannot self-produce pig iron, so it makes sense he values this process particularly."

"Please note, the reverberatory furnace style shown in the sketch is basically consistent with that unfinished dual-chamber reverberatory furnace of the Zheng clique found on Xiamen Island. Hollow iron cast furnace nozzles capable of water-cooling were even found on the Xiamen foundry construction site. If Hale also uses similar nozzles in the Manila factory, then his reverberatory furnaces should be designed with heat exchange chambers, improving production efficiency through hot blast. At least in this casting workshop, Hale's reverberatory furnace is the item most possessing technology leading this era, or black technology. As for others, green sand molds, iron mold casting and such, count for nothing."

"Doesn't this make him Amaterasu descended to earth?" someone retorted, "Forget that this Little Jap is a weapon expert cum chemistry expert, now he's also a metallurgy expert?"

"We know too little about him. But since he is Japanese and skilled in weapon manufacturing, I guess he might have conducted relatively deep research into his country's military industry history. After all, modern Japanese military industry started from building reverberatory furnaces to cast cannons in Nirayama and Kagoshima. From some materials I consulted, some refining reverberatory furnaces in Bakumatsu and early Meiji Japan indeed adopted structurally similar hollow water-cooled nozzles."

"Metal mineral deposits everywhere in the Philippines are very rich. Could this situation occur," Wu Mu said, "Hale, to confuse us, or for prudence, on one hand requests Spanish Governor to import metals, on the other hand engages in indigenous blast furnace iron and copper smelting in other Philippine regions, then transports to Manila factory for processing. I don't deny Comrade Lando and Manila Station's work achievements, but the scope they stepped into is at furthest limited to Manila outskirts, inevitably leaving blanks."

"I agree," Jiang Shan said, "I suggest immediately dispatching long-range resource exploration, cooperating with Manila Station to investigate important mineral sites in the Philippines, especially current Philippine mineral mining and processing situations, ensuring grasp of first-hand intelligence. Considering the danger of this mission, I request assistance and support from Army and Navy department comrades and Special Reconnaissance Team comrades."

"Also, we have realized this man Hale's talent. Now we need even more to clarify his purpose in racking his brains to serve Spanish colonial authorities. Is his attitude towards us friendly, or attempting hostility? If the latter, how to eliminate him and the adverse effects he brings. To solve this, Comrade Lando needs to manage active contact with him. This also carries certain risks, needing everyone's assistance. We must start formulating various contingency plans, preparing for everything from peaceful contact to total war."

On the coastline of one of the countless uninhabited islands in Manila Bay, a lamp lit up in the morning mist. Flashing rhythmically.

As the light flashed, a light two-masted Guangzhou ship gradually appeared in the dense sea mist on the surface. It cruised carefully along the coastline, keeping distance from the shore. Light signals also flashed on the ship's mast.

After a few rounds of back and forth with the lights on shore, the Guangzhou ship's tiller was moved; the bow changed direction, coming toward the small island.

Crugged rocks lined the island coast; dense thickets and wild grass extended almost onto the rocks. The coastline was desolate. But in this small bay without a trace of human habitation, a wooden pier was built. Judging from the rotting of wood stubble and density of barnacles attached, the pier was built recently.

Although wild grass had grown sturdily on the compacted gravel ground, one could still see the ground along the coast by the pier had been leveled.

The Guangzhou ship approached the wharf carefully. On the bow and poop deck, several brawny men wearing bamboo hats and black clothes held Japanese muskets, bows and arrows, and lit slow matches, carefully guarding the surroundings.

Silence reigned on the sea and the small island; only the sound of waves hitting rocks echoed. The Guangzhou ship gradually approached the pier. As sailors on the bow threw heaving lines, a whistle sounded on shore, breaking the silence. Several skinny Malay sailors ran out from the woods, caught the cables thrown from the bow, and deftly secured them to bollards. Both sides exchanged a few words in Hokkien, and a gangplank was quickly set up.

Marcos appeared on the pier. expressing welcome to the oncoming guest.

Both sides didn't stand on ceremony on the pier; Marcos led the visitor directly to a straw shed in the jungle.

Hale was already waiting for Zheng Zhifeng's arrival in the shed.

He didn't dress like an "old sea dog" like last time he met Zheng Zhifeng, but wore a friar-style black robe. Other than that, he was no different from when he met Zheng Zhifeng in Xiao Liuqiu.

By contrast, the graceful and poised temperament of a noble son Zheng Zhifeng had in the past had vanished. His face was haggard, looking mentally and physically exhausted at a glance.

Didn't expect him to be haggard like this! Hale was secretly surprised and couldn't help but secretly regret.

Anping fell; Hale was the first in Manila to get the news. The destruction of Anping-Xiamen and death of Zheng Zhilong in battle was a devastating blow to the Zheng clique, and to Hale, it was no less than a sap to the head. He originally hoped the Zheng clique would act as stable Chinese goods suppliers, then use the firearms they urgently needed to extract financial resources to upgrade his workshop. Meanwhile, improving Zheng family equipment would enhance their combat power, pinning down Australian actions. Hale originally counted on the Zheng clique dragging Australians into an endless war of attrition along the Chinese coast, leaving them no time to look south.

But the Australian strike on Xiamen-Anping completely shattered his plan. Although the Zheng family wasn't completely annihilated and territory along the Fujian coast wasn't damaged, the Zheng clique had invisibly disintegrated. Remnant forces split apart; strength was far less than before—this year they didn't even send Anhai ships to Manila. Spies he sent to the Chinese coast and Japan reported that Anhai ships sent by Zheng family remnants to Japan suffered severe losses in Japan: Ming merchants crossed the sea ahead of time in winter when Chinese merchant ships usually didn't arrive, sailing an unknown route, transporting large amounts of Chinese goods. Moreover, it was rumored large amounts of goods were transshipped from Korea. As a result, when Anhai ships arrived, they found all Chinese goods abundant and market prices depressed. Anhai ships had to sell shipped goods at cut prices. Not only that, spies also reported that although Anhai ships owned by various Zheng family factions quickly restored to a considerable number, many were rushed built with this year's timber. Quality was very poor—typical disposable trade ships.

What worried Hale most was: the current split of the Zheng clique severely weakened their strength, making them even more insignificant on the whole strategic level. And the split made the Zheng clique powerless to resist erosion by other forces: Liu Xiang's group, compressed to the Chaoshan area, was restless with Dutch support. The Dutch bargained among various Zheng clique groups, attempting to gain maximum benefit. The Australians turned a blind eye to the changing situation in Weitou Bay, but swallowed the foundation in Tainan the Zheng clique had painstakingly managed for years in one gulp.
