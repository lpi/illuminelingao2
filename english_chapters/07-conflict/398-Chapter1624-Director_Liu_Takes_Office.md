# Chapter 1624 - Director Liu Takes Office

A convoy of tugboats sailed slowly along the coastline, the lead tugboat belching thick black smoke. This was the scheduled tugboat convoy plying between Qiongshan and Lingao. The barges were loaded with various agricultural and sideline products, mineral products, and building materials transported from Qiongshan to Lingao.

At the very end of the tugboat convoy was a passenger barge. It carried passengers traveling between the two places. Although ridiculously slow by the Senators' standards, for the natives whose boat trips depended entirely on the weather, it was incredibly fast.

However, there were no native passengers on today's passenger barge. The entire boat had been chartered by Liu Xiang, the Director of the Qiongshan County Office. He was taking his family and returning to Lingao to report on his work and, incidentally, to assume a new post.

A month ago, the General Office had sent a "first birthday gift" for Liu Xiang's daughter—due to his busy work schedule, his daughter's one-month feast and one-year birthday banquet had both been held in Qiongshan. Tucked inside were some other items: the smaller ones were two documents prepared by the Grand Library, one titled *Historical Research on the Shimazu Clan of Satsuma Domain Forcing the Sho Dynasty of Ryukyu to Pay Tribute and Submit*, and the other *Historical Materials on the 17th Century Civil War in Vietnam*; the larger one was the *Compilation of Local Conditions in Guangzhou Prefecture*, jointly compiled by multiple departments. Seeing these, and connecting them with recent trends in the "Two Journals and One Newspaper," Liu Xiang knew that a job transfer was imminent.

Regarding the job transfer, the Organization Department and Liu Muzhou of the Civil Affairs People's Commission had both spoken to him when he returned to Lingao for his last report. First, they asked if he had any intention of transferring: "to shoulder greater responsibilities"; second, they discussed his governance experience in Qiongzhou over the past few years and his views on local administrative affairs.

Although classmate Liu Xiang hadn't muddled through government offices before, he understood the term "organizational inspection," especially since Ming Lang had spoken to him personally. The implication of a transfer was very strong.

After he expressed his willingness to "accept the organization's test," a deputy director descended upon Qiongshan County. Following this, his originally overstretched team of naturalized cadres was suddenly fully staffed. Not only were all vacancies filled, but deputy positions were also added.

It had to be said that apart from the Senate's capital "Lingao," no other county seat could enjoy such a luxurious configuration of local administrative cadres. While Liu Xiang felt "flattered," he knew that his days of leaving Qiongshan County were numbered.

To be honest, he wasn't very satisfied with his work in Qiongshan over the past few years. Although Qiongshan County, being the prefectural capital, was developed early, had a large population, a good agricultural environment, and abundant water sources, and was listed as a "Demonstration County"—receiving considerable investment from the Planning Academy and the Central State Council, and being generously provided with funds, personnel, and equipment—if one were to ask where besides Lingao and Sanya in the whole of Hainan there was "industry above a designated scale," Qiongshan County was the only place.

However, due to the current county administration still operating under a system of full financial appropriation, the things he, the Director of Qiongshan County, could do were very limited. Almost everything required central approval, and many matters were vertically managed by various central ministries and commissions. If it weren't for the fact that his jurisdiction was a "Demonstration County" with significant policy inclination, he practically wouldn't have been able to get anything done. It was probably just like the bureaucrats of the past, mainly managing the collection of grain taxes. After all, trying cases now fell under the Circuit Court of the Arbitration Tribunal.

"If it weren't for the drama of the disturbance in Lingao, I guess the Executive Committee wouldn't have made up its mind either." Liu Xiang stood on the poop deck, smoking a cigar in the sea breeze. "Make a fuss, and all forces come out of their holes. It won't do not to conquer the mainland now. The situation pushes people forward."

He was roughly aware of the changing winds in Lingao. Expatriate Senators had keen noses; besides various publications, private messages between Senators were the most convenient channel for intelligence exchange. So concerning recent events like the establishment of Senate committees, the Youth League, institutional reform, etc., not only did he know about them, but he also knew a bit about the inside stories.

"It's all caused by being too idle!" Liu Xiang threw the cigarette butt into the sea. Years ago, Liu Xiang had said that the root of all contradictions in the Senate lay in the fact that the ruled area was too small—too many radishes and too few pits. Although everyone had an official position now, for a large portion of Senators who came with the mentality of "becoming a master of men after crossing over," their power and status were not enough—that is to say, they weren't busy enough. After all, everyone's pursuit was the superstructure.

With the conclusion of Operation Engine, the lower levels of existing institutions rapidly fleshed out, and the operation of the entire state machine became faster and faster. No matter how otaku or lazy the Senators were, they were modern people—or rather, future people—who had experienced the grind of a true bureaucratic society. They were all fished out from their dorms and from in front of their notebooks to fill the various key parts of this state machine, everyone busy to the point of dizziness. Those who really lacked practical experience were sent to various departments to serve as deputy directors in charge of specific matters—essentially administrative interns. Once they got the hang of it, there would be new appointments.

For example, the person currently serving as Deputy Director preparing to replace Liu Xiang was a former "Soy Sauce Senator" who had long muddled through various departments as a deputy division chief. After getting tired of administrative work combined with teaching, he embraced the ideal of becoming a "Marquis of a Hundred Li" (county magistrate) and actively requested a transfer to the local level. And so he came—after coordinating with him, Liu Xiang put him in charge of that year's autumn harvest, letting him get a good dose of labor.

"That's why they say labor is the best way to transform a person!" Liu Xiang felt another wave of emotion when he thought of the spirit and energy of that former Soy Sauce Senator after completing the handover work—power really exercises people.

"Why am I thinking about that guy for no reason!" Standing on the poop deck looking at the familiar receding coastline, Liu Xiang couldn't help but roast himself in his heart. That coastline, if he remembered correctly, should be the island where the Haidian Campus of Hainan University was located in later generations. The forestry processing base that Liu Xiang had "run around the ministries" to secure was built there. The estuary of the Nandu River was like the Nile, divided into two channels, one large and one small, by a central sandbar at the mouth. Beside the small western channel was this island. Log rafts coming down from upstream could land from the small channel and be transported directly to the processing plant. The processed timber was then directly loaded onto ships via the small wharf on the island for shipment.

Originally, this factory had been in a state of manpower shortage since its establishment. Workers had to simultaneously work as rafters, coolies, carpenters, and other trades; the operating efficiency and labor intensity were very high—after all, the disaster relief that year had poached a lot of manpower from Qiongshan Prefecture. It was only after Operation Engine began that the labor shortage started to ease. By now, this timber processing base was flourishing and thriving.

On the other side of the riverbank, machines roared and red brick chimneys were spewing thick smoke. This was another big project he had procured: a brick and tile factory. The raw materials used were leftovers like coal gangue culled from the coal washing plant.

"Thinking about it, I'm actually quite reluctant to leave!" When the coastline completely disappeared from view, Liu Xiang spoke softly to the sea breeze.

"Ba- baaaa," a familiar sweet, crisp voice sounded. He knew immediately it was his little girl.

"Why did you bring the child up here! The wind is strong, and it's unsafe! And you're not even holding her hand!" Liu Xiang turned around and got angry—Guo Ling'er had brought the girl up to the poop deck, but the little girl wasn't being held by the hand. Instead, she was flapping her arms and toddling towards Liu Xiang on her own, shouting "Papa" as she walked. Seeing this, Liu Xiang immediately ran over and picked up his precious daughter.

"It's not like you don't know your precious! If only I could hold her back! Feeding her a meal sent me running all over the second-deck cabins. I finally stuffed the last piece of fish into her mouth, and she wouldn't even drink her soup, insisting on finding Papa," Guo Ling'er complained with a face full of grievance.

Having given birth to a child—although it was a daughter, it was obvious that her Chief husband doted on this little darling especially—Guo Ling'er seemed to have gained a lot of confidence and dared to nag a bit in front of Liu Xiang. In fact, Liu Xiang quite liked the current confident Guo Ling'er. Her previous demeanor was completely that of a submissive Persian cat; rather than a pillow partner, she was more like a pet.

While dodging his daughter's demonic claws reaching out to grab his glasses and pull his hair, Liu Xiang skillfully undid the bib and smock his daughter wore for eating. That little bit of irritation in his heart had long vanished.

"Say Papa," Liu Xiang switched on the "Daily Quest: Tease Daughter" mode.

"Papa..." Liu Xiang was hit by the crisp, sweet, cute voice.

"Where's Mama? Where is Mama?"

"Woo..." Liu Xiang was struck by the cute little paws.

"Say Mama!"

"Papa..." Liu Xiang received the "Recognize No One But Dad" status, mood MAX, and switched on big laughter mode.

"This girl! When she was breastfeeding, she called for Mama all day long. After weaning, she only calls for Papa!" Guo Ling'er complained, reaching out to take the child. Judging from this girl's consistent "urinary nature," a timely rain was due not long after finish eating.

"You're doing it on purpose. You know she calls you every time, yet you always ask her to say Mama."

"Hahahaha," Liu Xiang couldn't stop laughing. Holding Guo Ling'er with one hand and the stair railing with the other, they descended to the passenger cabin.

After teasing the little girl for a while longer and seeing her start to rub her eyes, Liu Xiang kissed his daughter in his arms and asked, "Be a good girl and go sleep-sleep with Mama, okay?" The daughter spaced out for a moment, then replied in a milky voice, "Ha... oh...", and then threw herself onto Guo Ling'er.

"See, when she wants to sleep, she only looks for you, not me. Look at you being jealous!" After teasing Guo Ling'er as usual, Liu Xiang waved his hand, signaling her to take the girl to sleep.

Liu Xiang didn't have the habit of taking afternoon naps. Once he slept, he would sleep very heavily. He had tried taking naps after lunch a few times, only to find that he would sleep until five or six o'clock every time, which disrupted his bio-rhythm instead. So he simply stopped taking afternoon naps. Now that the little girl wasn't clinging to him and making noise, Liu Xiang took out those reliable "gift" documents again and spread them out on the desk.

"Vietnam, Ryukyu, Guangzhou—where to?" Liu Xiang had been agonizing over this for quite a long time.
