# Chapter 1624 - Director Liu Takes Office

A convoy of tugboats sailed slowly along the coastline, the lead vessel belching thick black smoke. This was the scheduled convoy plying between Qiongshan and Lingao. The barges were loaded with agricultural products, minerals, and building materials bound for Lingao.

At the very end of the convoy was a passenger barge carrying travelers between the two ports. Though ridiculously slow by Senator standards, for natives whose boat trips had always depended entirely on the weather, it was incredibly fast.

But there were no native passengers on today's barge. The entire vessel had been chartered by Liu Xiang, Director of the Qiongshan County Office. He was bringing his family back to Lingao to report on his work and, incidentally, to assume a new post.

A month ago, the General Office had sent a "first birthday gift" for Liu Xiang's daughter—due to his busy work schedule, both her one-month feast and first birthday banquet had been held in Qiongshan. Tucked inside the package were some additional items: two documents from the Grand Library, one titled *Historical Research on the Shimazu Clan of Satsuma Domain Forcing the Sho Dynasty of Ryukyu to Pay Tribute and Submit*, the other *Historical Materials on the 17th Century Civil War in Vietnam*; and a larger volume, the *Compilation of Local Conditions in Guangzhou Prefecture*, jointly compiled by multiple departments. Seeing these, and connecting them with recent trends in the "Two Journals and One Newspaper," Liu Xiang knew a job transfer was imminent.

Regarding the transfer, both the Organization Department and Liu Muzhou of the Civil Affairs People's Commission had spoken to him during his last report. First, they asked whether he had any interest in transferring to "shoulder greater responsibilities." Second, they discussed his governance experience in Qiongzhou over the past few years and his views on local administrative affairs.

Though classmate Liu Xiang had never muddled through government offices before, he understood the term "organizational inspection"—especially since Ming Lang had spoken to him personally. The implication of a transfer was unmistakable.

After he expressed his willingness to "accept the organization's test," a deputy director descended upon Qiongshan County. Following this, his once-overstretched team of naturalized cadres was suddenly fully staffed. Not only were all vacancies filled, but deputy positions were also added.

It had to be said that apart from the Senate's capital of Lingao, no other county seat could boast such a luxurious configuration of local administrative cadres. While Liu Xiang felt "flattered," he knew his days in Qiongshan County were numbered.

To be honest, he wasn't entirely satisfied with his work in Qiongshan over the past few years. Qiongshan County, being the prefectural capital, had been developed early, had a large population, a favorable agricultural environment, and abundant water sources. It was listed as a "Demonstration County"—receiving considerable investment from the Planning Academy and the Central State Council, generously provided with funds, personnel, and equipment. If one were to ask where besides Lingao and Sanya in all of Hainan there was "industry above a designated scale," Qiongshan County was the only answer.

However, because the current county administration still operated under a system of full financial appropriation, the things he could actually do were very limited. Almost everything required central approval, and many matters were vertically managed by various central ministries and commissions. If it weren't for the fact that his jurisdiction was a "Demonstration County" with significant policy inclination, he practically wouldn't have been able to get anything done. He was like a bureaucrat of old, mainly managing the collection of grain taxes. After all, trying cases now fell under the Circuit Court of the Arbitration Tribunal.

"If it weren't for the drama of the Lingao disturbance, I doubt the Executive Committee would have made up its mind." Liu Xiang stood on the poop deck, smoking a cigar in the sea breeze. "Make a fuss, and all forces come out of their holes. We can't avoid conquering the mainland now. The situation pushes people forward."

He was roughly aware of the changing winds in Lingao. Expatriate Senators had keen noses; besides various publications, private messages between Senators were the most convenient channel for intelligence exchange. Regarding recent events—the establishment of Senate committees, the Youth League, institutional reform—not only did he know about them, but he also knew a bit about the behind-the-scenes stories.

"It's all caused by too much idleness!" Liu Xiang threw his cigarette butt into the sea. Years ago, he had said that the root of all contradictions in the Senate lay in the fact that the ruled area was too small—too many radishes, too few pits. Although everyone had an official position now, for a large portion of Senators who had crossed over with the mentality of "becoming a master of men," their power and status fell short—that is to say, they weren't busy enough. After all, everyone's pursuit was the superstructure.

With the conclusion of Operation Engine, the lower levels of existing institutions had rapidly fleshed out, and the operation of the entire state machine was accelerating. No matter how otaku or lazy the Senators were, they were modern people—or rather, future people—who had experienced the grind of a true bureaucratic society. They were all fished out of their dorms and from in front of their notebooks to fill key parts of this state machine, everyone busy to the point of dizziness. Those who genuinely lacked practical experience were sent to various departments to serve as deputy directors in charge of specific matters—essentially administrative interns. Once they got the hang of it, new appointments would follow.

For example, the person currently serving as Deputy Director preparing to replace Liu Xiang was a former "Soy Sauce Senator" who had long muddled through various departments as a deputy division chief. After tiring of administrative work combined with teaching, he embraced the ideal of becoming a "Marquis of a Hundred Li" and actively requested a transfer to the local level. So he came—after coordinating with him, Liu Xiang had put him in charge of that year's autumn harvest to give him a good dose of labor.

"That's why they say labor is the best way to transform a person!" Liu Xiang felt another wave of emotion when he thought of the spirit and energy of that former Soy Sauce Senator after completing the handover—power really exercises people.

"Why am I thinking about that guy for no reason!" Standing on the poop deck watching the familiar coastline recede, Liu Xiang couldn't help but roast himself. That coastline, if he remembered correctly, should be the island where the Haidian Campus of Hainan University would be located in later generations. The forestry processing base that Liu Xiang had "run around the ministries" to secure was built there. The Nandu River estuary was like the Nile, divided into two channels—one large, one small—by a central sandbar at the mouth. Beside the smaller western channel lay this island. Log rafts coming down from upstream could land via the small channel and be transported directly to the processing plant. The processed timber was then loaded onto ships at the island's small wharf and shipped out.

Originally, this factory had been in a state of manpower shortage since its establishment. Workers had to simultaneously serve as rafters, coolies, carpenters, and other trades; the operating efficiency and labor intensity were severe—after all, the disaster relief that year had poached significant manpower from Qiongshan Prefecture. It was only after Operation Engine began that the labor shortage started to ease. By now, this timber processing base was flourishing.

On the other side of the riverbank, machines roared and red brick chimneys spewed thick smoke. This was another big project he had procured: a brick and tile factory using leftovers like coal gangue culled from the coal washing plant.

"Thinking about it, I'm actually quite reluctant to leave!" When the coastline completely disappeared from view, Liu Xiang spoke softly to the sea breeze.

"Ba- baaaa," a familiar sweet, crisp voice sounded. He knew immediately it was his little girl.

"Why did you bring the child up here! The wind is strong, and it's unsafe! And you're not even holding her hand!" Liu Xiang turned around and scolded her—Guo Ling'er had brought the girl up to the poop deck, but the little girl wasn't being held by the hand. Instead, she was flapping her arms and toddling towards Liu Xiang on her own, shouting "Papa" as she walked. He immediately ran over and scooped up his precious daughter.

"It's not like you don't know your precious! If only I could hold her back! Feeding her a meal sent me running all over the second-deck cabins. I finally stuffed the last piece of fish into her mouth, and she wouldn't even drink her soup—insisted on finding Papa," Guo Ling'er complained with a face full of grievance.

Having given birth—although it was a daughter, it was obvious that her Chief husband doted on this little darling especially—Guo Ling'er seemed to have gained considerable confidence and dared to nag a bit in front of Liu Xiang. In fact, he quite liked the current confident Guo Ling'er. Her previous demeanor was completely that of a submissive Persian cat; rather than a pillow partner, she was more like a pet.

While dodging his daughter's demonic claws reaching out to grab his glasses and pull his hair, Liu Xiang skillfully undid the bib and smock she wore for eating. That little bit of irritation in his heart had long vanished.

"Say Papa," Liu Xiang switched on "Daily Quest: Tease Daughter" mode.

"Papa..." Liu Xiang was hit by the crisp, sweet, cute voice.

"Where's Mama? Where is Mama?"

"Woo..." Liu Xiang was struck by cute little paws.

"Say Mama!"

"Papa..." Liu Xiang received the "Recognize No One But Dad" status, mood maxed out, switching on grinning mode.

"This girl! When she was breastfeeding, she called for Mama all day long. After weaning, she only calls for Papa!" Guo Ling'er complained, reaching out to take the child. Judging from this girl's consistent habits, a "timely rain" was due not long after eating.

"You're doing it on purpose. You know she calls you every time, yet you always ask her to say Mama."

"Hahahaha," Liu Xiang couldn't stop laughing. Holding Guo Ling'er with one hand and the stair railing with the other, they descended to the passenger cabin.

After teasing the little girl for a while longer and seeing her start to rub her eyes, Liu Xiang kissed his daughter and asked, "Be a good girl and go sleep-sleep with Mama, okay?" The daughter spaced out for a moment, then replied in a milky voice, "Ha... oh...," and threw herself onto Guo Ling'er.

"See, when she wants to sleep, she only looks for you, not me. Look at you being jealous!" After teasing Guo Ling'er as usual, Liu Xiang waved his hand, signaling her to take the girl to sleep.

Liu Xiang didn't have the habit of taking afternoon naps. Once he slept, he slept heavily—he had tried napping after lunch a few times, only to find that he would sleep until five or six o'clock every time, disrupting his entire rhythm. So he simply stopped. Now that the little girl wasn't clinging to him and making noise, Liu Xiang took out those "gift" documents again and spread them out on the desk.

"Vietnam, Ryukyu, Guangzhou—where to?" Liu Xiang had been agonizing over this for quite some time.
