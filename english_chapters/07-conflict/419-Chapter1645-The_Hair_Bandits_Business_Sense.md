# Chapter 1645 - The Hair-Bandits' Business Sense

This news struck Zhang Yu like a bolt from the blue. No other family could ever compete with a business operated by the Hair-bandits themselves. They didn't use underhanded tricks or official power; they could crush opponents to death just by using price and quality. Take the time Author Guo started selling various Australian coarse papers a few years ago. Inside and outside the city, papermakers and paper sellers—except for those dealing in stationery paper products who escaped disaster because Australians didn't make these things—almost none were spared; most went bankrupt. Those who barely survived could only live by distributing "Australian paper."

That was one thing, because shops selling paper didn't produce paper themselves. When Australian paper was dumped, what finished were papermaking workshops and wholesale paper firms. Retail small shops could still make a living, even with profits better than before. The problem was that walnut cookies were produced and sold by themselves. If the Australians' tea food shop also sold walnut cookies, and the price was cheaper than theirs, small shops like theirs would have to close down for good in an instant.

"Mother, don't worry." Zhang Yu forced down the panic in his heart, "We are a century-old shop. Everyone recognizes this brand. So what if their price is lower?"

"Yu'er, you don't know." Mother frowned, "The retail part, they indeed can't snatch much business. I'm just afraid of the tea house business..."

For the Zhang family shop's walnut cookies, tea houses were a major outlet. His family's walnut cookies had some fame in this area. Nearby tea houses mostly used his family's goods. Although they couldn't make big money, it was a fixed income, crucial for the small shop's survival.

Tea houses were equivalent to wholesale business. Distance didn't matter. As long as "price is cheap and goods beautiful," Australians could take this piece of business. If so, their own shop could no longer be maintained!

With this made clear, Zhang Yu also got anxious. This was truly pulling the firewood from under the cauldron!

The Hair-bandits were really hateful! He couldn't help clenching his fists, but felt very lost. What to do? The Hair-bandits certainly wouldn't regard his family's small shop; they probably didn't even know there was such a shop in Guangzhou City. Why did they have to open a tea food shop properly? Could it be they wanted to sell "Australian Tea Food"? Thinking of this, he had a flash of inspiration. *Right, Australian tea food and Great Ming's tea food are definitely different. Dad said long ago, food customs differ within a hundred li. Australia is ten thousand li away overseas; they surely wouldn't make walnut cookies exactly the same as their family's.*

Thinking of this, he felt slightly relieved and comforted his mother: "Mother, don't be anxious. I have a senior student who is very familiar with Australians' affairs. I'll go find him to verify, see if there really is this Australian tea food shop, and what it sells."

He changed into outing clothes and ran out like a wisp of smoke. Opposite his home was a tofu shop. The boss's daughter was a year older than him, growing fair and clean, often helping sell tofu at the shop front. The two often looked into each other's eyes. Both being young, they couldn't avoid making eyes at each other. Every time the family needed to buy tofu, Zhang Yu rushed to go. When the girl handed him tofu, her hand would linger in his hand for a moment.

Seeing him come out of the shop, the girl was looking over affectionately, but saw him run past as if his butt was on fire, not even glancing here. She couldn't help spitting secretly.

He ran straight to the community school. Sure enough, Wu Ming was still in the community school at this moment, sitting under the corridor talking loudly with several senior students. Seeing this student who slipped away before noon running back, and winking constantly, trusting he had some urgent matter to tell him, Wu Ming said "Back in a moment" and strolled over slowly.

Before Zhang Yu could open his mouth, Wu Ming's fan already knocked on his head with a *pa*:

"You little rascal, skipping school all day! See if the teacher won't beat your butt rotten when he comes back." Wu Ming said smilingly. Although they had the reality of teacher and student, usually they were considered classmates, with no talk of teacher's dignity.

Zhang Yu was in no mood to joke with him. He grabbed his wrist and pulled him aside, saying anxiously: "I have something!"

"Oh? Usually getting a poor grade in exams doesn't see you this anxious..." Wu Ming straightened his sleeves, "Speak, what matter?"

"Senior Student, I know you are generally versed in Banditology. Do Hair-bandits have tea food shops? Do they sell walnut cookies?"

Wu Ming didn't understand the inside story for a moment and said vaguely: "Probably have them."

"Do they have them or not after all?" Zhang Yu was so anxious his eyes turned red.

Wu Ming didn't know why this junior student suddenly became interested in Hair-bandit tea food. Seeing him anxious, he comforted: "Speak slowly. Why do you ask this?"

He then told the news he heard from his mother in full detail.

"...As long as the Hair-bandits handle the business themselves, no one else can continue doing it," he said nervously, "What should be done? My family relies on just this one shop to maintain livelihood."

This stumped Wu Ming. The Yuyuan Society specialized in researching Banditology, but never researched Hair-bandits' "tea food." However, one thing was certain: If Hair-bandits also opened a tea food shop, the price would definitely be cheaper than the junior student's family. Moreover, Australians' tea food shops, needless to say, would be like Purple Treasure Studio, paying only normal taxes. Messy various "donations" and customary fees wouldn't be paid a single *wen*. Just this gave them advantage over the junior student's shop.

Wu Ming opened his fan, waved it a few times, and suddenly laughed: "What are you afraid of? Walnut cookies are cheap items speaking of it. Your family's shop is in the city; the Great World is outside the city. Who would run so far to buy a piece of walnut cookie? Even if they sell it cheaper, foot travel money is also money. Besides, your family is a century-old shop: wine aroma fears no deep alley. Australian shops don't have this fame."

"Senior Student, what you say is correct. But what I fear is they will snatch the tea house business. That is bulk business. As long as their price is a bit lower, tea houses will all go there to stock goods. Without the bulk business, my family's shop can't hold up!"

"So that's it!" Wu Ming slapped his thigh with the fan, saying excitedly, "This Way of Economy is indeed interesting! Australians truly don't deceive me!"

A look of disappointment appeared on Zhang Yu's face. He didn't understand "Way of Economy" or whatever, but he could see Senior Student Wu had no clever plan for this either.

Just as he was disheartened, Wu Ming suddenly said: "I actually have a way. Isn't this Great World currently inviting merchants? I think, how about you simply move the shop to the Great World? Since it's Australians' territory, those customary fees and miscellaneous donations can all be skipped. Wouldn't that be beautiful!"

Zhang Yu didn't know whether to laugh or cry: "Senior Student, you just said: Who would run outside the city to buy a piece of walnut cookie. Small shops like ours do business with neighbors of a few streets. Moving to the Great World, these old businesses would all be gone..." Seeing this, he knew Wu Ming couldn't come up with any clever plan, so he said dejectedly: "I'll find someone else to inquire."

"Don't be anxious." Wu Ming said, "Just right, I have a good friend, newly arrived from Lingao not long ago. How about I take you to see him? He lived in Lingao for a long time; he knows the Australians' situation clearly."

"That would be excellent!" Zhang Yu bowed deeply, "Please take Little Brother there quickly, Senior Student."

Wu Ming had a warm heart. Immediately asking for leave from the school, he led Zhang Yu to Huang Binkun's lodgings.

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, Huang Binkun sighed long and said: "As expected! The Hair-bandits' evil claws still reached into Guangzhou Prefecture!"

This "Someone's Evil Claws" was a rhetoric Australians were used to using. Huang Binkun, influenced by what he heard and saw, also learned it.

"Brother Huang..." Wu Ming opened his mouth, winking at him: *This little brother is anxious, you stop sighing and groaning.*

"Speaking of tea food shops, Lingao has them." Huang Binkun said, "Walnut cookies, I haven't seen them." He paused, "However, I generally don't like this item. Perhaps there are; I haven't seen them personally..."

Zhang Yu was about to cry: *What kind of answer is this.*

Huang Binkun hesitated, then said again: "Actually this little brother doesn't need to be anxious either. Hair-bandits' way of doing things has always been 'those who submit to me prosper, those who resist me perish.' As long as you go along with them, they always leave room. I think this time it's probably like this too."

"What is the meaning of this?"

"According to what I've seen and heard, Hair-bandits hate small workshop businesses most. Everything must be gathered into big factories. So this time if they also want to open a tea food shop, they certainly want to open a big big tea food factory..."

Zhang Yu's face turned white. He couldn't imagine what a big big tea food factory looked like, but if there were suddenly many many walnut cookies on the market, the price cutting would definitely lead to total loss of capital—his family couldn't afford it.

"...However, they always leave a living path for common people. When the time comes, they will probably organize some 'cooperative,' ask you to join 'joint operation,' then distribute a few small shares to you, asking you to work in the factory. If nothing else, supporting a family without worry about food and clothing shouldn't be a problem."

"This is swallowing up!" Zhang Yu shouted, "My family is a century-old shop, a gold-lettered signboard. How could we go participate in some 'joint operation'?"

Huang Binkun looked at Zhang Yu and shook his head sorrowfully: "Little Brother, you don't know the ruthlessness of Hair-bandits' methods. Although I haven't eaten your family's walnut cookies, as long as Hair-bandits want to make them, they definitely won't make them worse than your family—probably far better. Price at most exactly same. What method do you have?"

"Putting it this way, we just wait for death with bowed heads?" Zhang Yu's face was pale. He remembered that former classmate selling smiles in the gigolo house.

Seeing his dejected look, Wu Ming knew this matter mattered greatly to him. Thinking that rather than say a few itchless words to comfort, better simply use a direct method. So he said:

"Don't be anxious. Since Australians are inviting merchants now, how about you and I go to the Great World tomorrow to take a look? Whether Australians have tea food shops, whether they make walnut cookies, asking face to face will clarify. Isn't it better than you worrying for no reason like this?"

Zhang Yu thought this was the only way, so he said disheartenedly: "This is good too."

Huang Binkun felt unbearable in his heart and said: "At least Hair-bandits still have some conscience, not to the extent of exterminating all. How about this, tomorrow I will accompany you to go together. To see if there are True Hair-bandits. I can also speak a few sentences of Australian Bandit dialect, can ask clearly face to face."
