# Chapter 1622 - The Sansi Statutes Bureau

The Law Society was also drafting a similar research report. This wasn't prompted by the Lingao disturbance, but because the Third Plenary Session was imminent. Institutional adjustment was already unavoidable, so the Law Society had started working on this half a year ago.

If it were just that, Ma Jia would have offered a professional comment. He would have viewed this report as a personal stepping stone for Lu Xuan, given the man's behavior today. But the content of the rectification suggestions sent Ma Jia into deep thought. The proposal wasn't exactly unfathomable. It simply suggested that each administrative department be responsible for clarifying its own functional authority, formulate departmental regulations based on its actual situation, then submit them to the Executive Committee for review, and finally have their validity confirmed by the Senate General Assembly. Although this method was simple and feasible, it wasn't particularly brilliant.

However, there was a premise to this passage: before being submitted to the Executive Committee for review, the departmental regulations from each department first had to pass an initial review by a "committee composed of policy researchers and relevant professionals."

Recently, various committees had been flying all over the BBS, and Ma Jia was particularly sensitive to the word "committee." Of course, following this line of thought, once such an institution was established, members of the Law Society would naturally be elected into this "committee" due to their professional backgrounds.

*Are you trying to curry favor with the Law Society and use this as a stepping stone?* Ma Jia thought for a moment and said, "Your proposal is excellent. As for revisions—this is a Grand Library project, after all. It wouldn't be appropriate for our Law Society to intervene. With papers like this, there are too many people who can't be listed as authors. Hahaha, hahaha."

Lu Xuan was about to continue speaking when the secretary knocked on the door.

"Come in!"

The secretary entered and reported, "Chief Ji has arrived."

"Please ask him to come in."

Hearing the title "Chief Ji," Lu Xuan's eyebrows twitched inadvertently.

Soon, the thick-browed, stout President of the "Indigenous Protection Association," senior teacher at Fangcaodi Education Park, and the Senate's most famous "Soy Sauce Senator," Ji Xin, appeared before everyone.

Lu Xuan was the first to stand up and greet Ji Xin with a smile. "Hello, Teacher Ji."

This Senator—who had participated in all major legal incidents in the Senate yet insisted on remaining at Fangcaodi to teach and refused to serve in administrative positions, living in relative seclusion—had always been someone Lu Xuan couldn't quite read. He was always extra careful when facing people he couldn't see through. He and Ji Xin both taught at Fangcaodi and were considered half-colleagues in the education sector. Every time they met, Lu Xuan addressed him as "Teacher."

"Teacher Lu is here too..." Lu Xuan was the only Senator who used "Teacher" to address him. Ji Xin enjoyed this simple and affectionate title. Over time, he had learned to reciprocate in kind.

"Curator Yu arranged for me to ask Executive Ma for instructions on some work." After speaking, Lu Xuan turned to Ma Jia. "Executive Ma, since you have business, I won't disturb you any longer. Please notify me anytime if there are any questions about the report."

"Alright, leave the report with me for now. Please tell Curator Yu that we will study it carefully. I'll have Director An contact you if anything comes up."

Ma Jia stood up again to shake hands with Lu Xuan and saw him to the door.

"Why is he here?" Ji Xin asked An Xi with a suspicious look as soon as Ma Jia closed the door.

While pouring tea for Ji Xin, An Xi replied, "The Grand Library is preparing a policy study in the direction of law. The project is being led by Lu Xuan. He brought the first draft of the proposal today to ask Executive Ma to review it. The proposal is still on Executive Ma's desk. I don't know the specific content."

"Grand Library? A proposal in the direction of law? Undertaken by Lu Xuan?" Hearing An Xi's words, a series of question marks popped up in Ji Xin's head.

Although Ji Xin couldn't be said to know Lu Xuan well, his impression of the man wasn't favorable. While Lu Xuan's work had been exemplary when they worked together, and Lu Xuan had always been polite in their limited dealings, Ji Xin—as President of the "Indigenous Protection Association"—was deeply disgusted by Lu Xuan's actions at Lu Family Manor. Out of consideration for the face of a fellow Senator and colleague, Ji Xin hadn't openly broken with Lu Xuan, but he always kept a deliberate distance from him beyond perfunctory greetings.

At this moment, Lu Xuan—already sitting in a carriage—also felt uneasy about Ji Xin's appearance. Unlike Ji Xin, Lu Xuan clearly remembered every interaction between them—especially from more than four years ago, when he and Ji Xin had participated in disaster relief together. Lu Xuan had handed over several orphans collected by the disaster relief working group to Ji Xin. Among them, two children who wished to study had entered Fangcaodi through Ji Xin's recommendation...

Ma Jia picked up Lu Xuan's report from the table and handed it to Ji Xin. Ji Xin quickly flipped through it. He wasn't surprised by the beautiful fountain pen calligraphy on the report—he had seen Lu Xuan's penmanship during open classes long ago. But he was equally surprised by the content of the proposal. Ji Xin's brows furrowed, and the habitual sorrowful expression on his face deepened. Countless thoughts raced through his mind, but strongest among them was Lu Xuan's gradually hideous face constantly emerging from the depths of his memory.

Ji Xin couldn't quite sort out his thoughts. He looked up at Ma Jia, who appeared as calm as still water. An Xi, on the other hand, was leaning over anxiously. Ji Xin hurriedly handed the report to An Xi.

An Xi was equally surprised by Lu Xuan's report, because he thought he understood Lu Xuan. The standard of this report greatly exceeded his expectations. After the surprise, An Xi's face showed more confusion, and he murmured, "I'm afraid it's not as simple as he says. This Master Lu probably wants to use Executive Ma and our Law Society as a stepping stool!"

An Xi's inference didn't mean he had really figured anything out, but was an instinctive defense against Lu Xuan's sudden appearance: *One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.* He understood this principle at least.

"Master Lu? Which is the Zhang Family Manor at East Gate Market?" Ma Jia was the Executive in charge of powerful departments. Hearing An Xi say this, he suddenly thought of something.

"Yes, Lu Xuan is actually the master of Zhang Family Manor."

After An Xi finished speaking, Ma Jia's expression shifted again. He looked at the confused An Xi, then at Ji Xin who seemed to have realized something, and held back what he was about to say.

Ji Xin also raised his head, staring at the ceiling. After a long while, he muttered to himself, "The Sansi Statutes Bureau!"

Hearing Ji Xin utter this phrase, both Ma Jia and An Xi were confused. However, An Xi appeared more eager and asked immediately, "What? What Sansi Statutes Bureau? What does that mean?"

"In the second year of Xining in the Northern Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi served as a Participant in Determining Governmental Matters and presided over the reforms. Based on his proposal, the Sansi Statutes Bureau—the Three Departments Statutes Bureau—was established to formulate regulations for the new laws. Later, this institution actually became the headquarters for Wang Anshi to preside over the reforms." Ji Xin was from the East China University of Political Science and Law and understood the "Xining Reforms," which left a heavy mark in legal history.

"Reform headquarters?!"

Ji Xin found An Xi's jaw-dropping reaction amusing. He continued, "At its inception, besides formulating regulations for new laws, the Sansi Statutes Bureau was also in charge of national finance and accounting..."

"He wants to seize power from the General Administration of Finance too?" An Xi couldn't help interrupting again.

"He has no such intention. The Sansi Statutes Bureau was also responsible for supervising the implementation of new laws and had the power to inspect and impeach local officials. I'm just illustrating how much power this institution wielded." Knowing An Xi's limited professional knowledge, Ji Xin continued to explain, fearing he would over-interpret.

"Indeed, just the power to formulate new laws and supervise their implementation is already formidable," Ma Jia said.

An Xi raised the report in his hand and said indignantly, "The Grand Library has calculated well—wanting to use our Law Society as a ladder to fight for positions for themselves. The formulation of departmental law is a matter of state; how could they possibly handle it at their level? Executive Ma, I'll go and turn them down right now."

Ji Xin, however, looked relaxed. "His suggestion states clearly that this preliminary review committee is to be composed jointly with professionals. In terms of his wording, you can't find any fault; it's all official boilerplate."

"The Grand Library clearly wants to use the Law Society as laborers while they pick the peaches themselves. Who doesn't know that submitting *Policy Research* to the Executive Committee is the Grand Library's specialty?" An Xi had completely written Lu Xuan off; he couldn't believe such a scheming proposal could come from that man.

"Hehe, do you really think this is the Grand Library's intention?" Ji Xin said leisurely.

An Xi instantly thought of something, and the expression on his face became more natural as he turned to look at Ma Jia.

Ma Jia gave Ji Xin a look full of profound meaning. "I also think it's impossible for Old Yu to do this. He's a man who has read history books his whole life; would he not know this trick? He's now in a position of prestige and engaged in his own profession of history. He doesn't understand administrative law or organizational regulations. Why play this game? What good does it do him if this proposal passes?"

"So you're saying it's—"

"Exactly. I think it's Master Lu's own calculation." Ji Xin had never been one to mince words and said whatever he thought. He smiled slightly. "How much do you know about this Master Lu?"

"Not much," Ma Jia said cautiously. An Xi sensibly said, "I have something to attend to. I'll go back to my office first."

"I know a little bit about this Director Lu," Ji Xin said. "You know he married a native wife, right?"

Ma Jia shook his head. "I really didn't know that. He's always lived in seclusion and rarely contacts our Law Society. I have no concept of his private life at all."

"You are the Director of the Political Security Bureau. Alright, saying this is a bit taboo. Let's get back to the point: did you know that not long after he got married, his father-in-law and brother-in-law both died in accidents?"

"Such a thing happened?!" Ma Jia was very surprised. "Are you saying..."
