# Chapter 1371 - Raising Silkworms

Lizheng was one of the first orphans taken in by Zhao Yingong and accepted as an apprentice. She had already received a considerable amount of cultural education in Zhao Yingong's "private school." This time, she was selected to take charge independently as the technical and administrative head of the Jixian Village Extension Station.

Li Yao'er had given her a crash course in sericulture technology at the mountain villa. Although Wang Siniang was clever and had rich experience in raising silkworms, she was illiterate after all, so her ability to accept new knowledge was somewhat poorer. In comparison, Lizheng, who already had the level of a Type B diploma, was much better. After all, things like lending and running cooperatives involved finance and numerical management. Wang Siniang, being illiterate, could not personally manage and supervise these things. Therefore, she could only exist as a wedge inserted into Jixian Village and a figurehead.

Duoduo's mother didn't know the tricks inside, but she had good eyesight and could see that although this person was young, she was also a "person in charge," so she dared not look down on her.

The number of people in Wang Siniang's house gradually increased. Every time a boat brought new things, one or two more people would unknowingly appear. There were men and women, and their common characteristic was that they acted with propriety and were taciturn. One rarely saw them gathering together to chat idly. Basically, everyone had work to do and never stopped their hands.

The hatching of ant silkworms generally started at 4:30 in the morning and they would all be out by 8:00 in the morning. After they were all out, the ant silkworms had to be transferred to silkworm trays for feeding. In Jixian Village, gathering ant silkworms was done using a feather sweep—this was also the most commonly used method, and every household had feathers specifically for sweeping ant silkworms. However, a different set of practices was used here.

Duoduo's mother and the other working women, following Lizheng's instructions, spread a kind of thin but tough cotton paper over the silkworm trays after the ant silkworms came out. Then they sprinkled chopped withered mulberry leaves on the cotton paper—this was called "lure mulberry," specifically used to attract the ant silkworms onto the paper.

After smelling the scent of the lure mulberry, the ant silkworms would crawl onto the cotton paper. Then the lure mulberry was gently swept away, and the cotton paper was moved to the rearing tray. The cotton paper was then flipped over to give mulberry leaves. In this way, the work of gathering ant silkworms was completed. Not only did it save labor, but it also caused less damage to the ant silkworms and the unhatched eggs.

Watching this technique, Duoduo's mother saw that the number of ant silkworms harvested was much higher than the usual sweeping method, and she secretly made a note in her heart: she would do this too when raising silkworms in the future.

The newborn ant silkworms squirmed in the "silkworm baskets," looking very strong and black, which was the proper color. This kind of ant silkworm was rarely seen in previous years. Wang Siniang's Guangdong breed was indeed good stuff! Duoduo's mother regretted a little why she hadn't bought a sheet of eggs on credit to raise—the conditions offered were clearly very favorable.

The ant silkworms in other households in the village came out a few days later, but the situation was still considered good. It looked like this year's silkworm harvest would be much better than last year's, at least reaching an eighty or ninety percent level. The constitution of the hatched ant silkworms was also good. The ant silkworms in Shen Kaibao's house came out exceptionally well, which made him forget his various troubles for a moment and have great hope in his heart.

However, during the first and second moults, there was continuous rain, and the temperature dropped all the way. Silkworm diseases began to appear in the village, and seeing people constantly going to the village stream to dump "silkworm baskets," a big stone pressed on Shen Kaibao's heart again: looking at this, it was impossible to enter the third moult peacefully.

According to the experience of previous years, in an average year, about one-fifth of the silkworms would be lost during the silkworm season. in a bad year, only one-third of the ant silkworms could live to spin cocoons. Of course, there were even worse cases, that is, a large area of crop failure in the village. But such things rarely happened.

For Shen Kaibao and most villagers, this year's silkworm harvest had to be at least eighty percent to make up for their losses over the past year and support them until the next year. If the silkworm harvest was only sixty or seventy percent, this year would become very difficult for many families to endure.

Tension filled the whole village. Although families usually did not burn incense during the silkworm raising period to avoid affecting the silkworms, every household prayed before the statues of the Kitchen God and the Silkworm God, praying that the upcoming third moult would pass peacefully.

Wang Siniang's silkworm house had good insulation and means to raise temperature and monitor temperature and humidity. It had been able to maintain the temperature and humidity in the silkworm room at the optimal state. coupled with the thorough disinfection work beforehand and the strict cleanliness work of the silkworm raisers, the silkworms were very strong. Duoduo's mother's work was busier now—she now had to wear cotton clothes similar to a baby's swaddling clothes every day, covering herself strictly from head to toe, even wrapping a headscarf on her head, and washing her hands when entering and leaving the silkworm room. A stone water trough was specially placed in front of the silkworm room, filled with clear water added with something unknown that had a pungent smell. People entering and leaving had to soak their hands and arms in it for a while before taking them out. A person was specially assigned to supervise nearby. If anyone forgot and only went to wash their hands after being reminded, a demerit would be recorded.

There was more and more work, and the rules became stricter. A complete set of "Standard Operating Procedures" was implemented here, taught hand-in-hand by Lizheng. Regardless of whether the silkworm raising women understood it or not, as long as they did as they were told, they were not allowed to do less or more, let alone change it casually. Every move had to be done according to the rules. If any link was done wrong, a demerit would also be recorded.

If three demerits were recorded, wages would be deducted—this was light. Duoduo's mother had also been deducted a few times. If it were a servant under the name of Wang Siniang's master "Master Zhao," the consequences of making a mistake would be much more miserable. Not only would money be deducted, but they would inevitably suffer physical pain: Duoduo's mother had heard the sound of bamboo boards hitting flesh and crying and begging for mercy from the side room several times, and occasionally saw a few silkworm raising women who were not very bright kneeling in the courtyard reciting the "Standard Operating Procedures" after work.

"Master Zhao's rice is really not easy to eat." Every time Duoduo's mother saw such things, she would feel a chill on the back of her neck, so she remembered the various rules particularly firmly—although she would not be beaten or punished by kneeling, if too much money was deducted, she would be laughed to death when she returned home.

As the third moult passed, the silkworm raising work entered a climax. Duoduo's mother and the silkworm raising women all lost weight, and their sleepless eyes were covered with red veins. Although a two-shift rotation system was implemented here, which was better than enduring day and night raising silkworms at home, the workload was much larger.

The silkworm raising women, in addition to constantly cutting and placing leaves during their shift, also had to inspect regularly. If stiff silkworms or sick silkworms were found, they had to be removed immediately with silkworm chopsticks and put into a special collection bucket.

The work of cleaning silkworm droppings was also very heavy—however, cleaning silkworm droppings here was much more convenient than raising silkworms at home. The bottoms of Wang Siniang's silkworm trays were paved with a layer of very fine silk net. When cleaning, one only needed to lift the silk net, and the silkworm droppings would naturally fall down. It was good enough to dump them into a special silkworm dropping basket.

Silkworm droppings and stiff/sick silkworms were stored in a special room and dumped together into the biogas digester behind the toilet at night to kill viruses and bacteria through fermentation treatment. Selling silkworm droppings as fertilizer was also an income for silkworm farmers, but traditional silkworm raising did not strictly isolate and control silkworm droppings or treat them harmlessly, becoming an important vector for silkworm diseases.

Although the silkworm raising women worked day and night and were frequently blamed, the treatment given by Wang Siniang also improved. They could eat as much rice as they wanted for three meals a day, and saw meat and fish every day. Before starting work every day, there was a special meeting to "motivate" them. For those who worked excellently and completed the indicators well, the top three were given extra bonuses in proportion.

Wang Siniang and Lizheng took turns supervising and patrolling. Their own voices were hoarse and their eyes were red. Everyone worked desperately in this intense atmosphere—the extension station raised a lot of silkworms, but used much less labor, relying entirely on work efficiency to improve.

In the village, it was the same busy and tense atmosphere. Shen Kaibao's whole family, including his ten-year-old grandson, hadn't closed their eyes for several days. Although there was the shadow of silkworm disease, and they had to dump a few "silkworm baskets," the remaining silkworms were considered striving. The "babies" after the "fourth moult" ate seven piculs of leaves on the first day, each one green and strong, making a sound of "sha sha" when eating leaves. Seeing that their own mulberry leaves were not enough, and the mulberry leaves bought with their savings were also almost used up, Shen Kaibao estimated that it would take another thirty piculs of leaves to reach the mounting stage. Relying on their own ability, they absolutely couldn't gather enough.

Shen Kaibao discussed with his sons Daqing and Sanqing where to borrow money to buy leaves again.

"We've mortgaged all the land to him. If we ask again, what can we use as collateral? Master Cao won't agree," Daqing said.

"If we can't borrow from Master Cao, should we beg Shopkeeper Wang in the town again?" Sanqing said.

Shen Kaibao said with a frown: "It was possible in previous years, but this year Shopkeeper Wang said he himself is a clay bodhisattva crossing the river."

"It seems we still have to beg Master Cao..." Sanqing said dazedly. He really couldn't hold on anymore, his eyelids felt like they weighed hundreds of catties, just wanting to close.

Shen Kaibao didn't speak. He thought and thought again, but apart from Master Cao, he really couldn't think of anyone who had the ability or possibility to lend him money right now. But this Master Cao was shrewd. He would never lend money without solid collateral. These thirty piculs of leaves, according to the current market price, would cost at least four mace of silver per picul.

Daqing said: "How about asking the leaf guild to buy on credit first..."

This was a way, but buying leaves on credit from the leaf guild meant not only high prices but also outrageously high interest. Thinking that his silkworm cocoons hadn't been harvested yet and many were already gone, Shen Kaibao's heart was anxious.

At this time, there was suddenly a noise on the rice drying ground outside. It turned out that Duoduo's mother's husband passed by with a boat carrying ten piculs of leaves. So the father and son's conversation was interrupted, and they all went out to watch the excitement.

Shen Kaibao was a little surprised. He knew Duoduo's mother's family. Their mulberry land was much less than his own. Although they only raised two sheets of "silkworm seeds" this year, the leaves were definitely not enough to eat. A few days ago, he even saw Duoduo's mother's father-in-law looking worried because he had no money to buy mulberry leaves. How come they suddenly raised money today?

He hurriedly stopped Duoduo's mother's husband and asked where the leaves came from. What was the market price?

"This is what Duoduo's mother bought on credit from the Shen Da family," he said loudly. "Their family has plenty of leaves!"
