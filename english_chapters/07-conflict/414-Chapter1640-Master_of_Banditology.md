# Chapter 1640 - Master of Banditology

Huang Binkun was momentarily at a loss for words. Indeed, what were the hair-bandits plotting? To become emperor themselves? Although the hair-bandits didn't have much territory, occupying the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture could be considered quite a significant situation. If they intended to rebel, with their warships and cannons, sweeping through half of China would be absolutely no problem; the government troops were definitely no match for them.

If one said they wanted to change the dynasty and vie for the Central Plains, ever since they bombarded Humen and bloodbathed Zhongzuo, any armed force on the Mainland would be like rotten wood before them. Although the hair-bandit army didn't look like many, once they rushed into Guangdong and made a high call, raising an army of hundreds of thousands would be a matter of moments. In these times, as long as there was army pay and grain, there was no shortage of poor people willing to eat army rations and become soldiers.

But they just stayed on that island of Qiongzhou, tirelessly building roads, stringing iron wires, opening up wasteland for farming everywhere, managing water conservancy, recruiting exiles, setting up schools... managing a desolate pirate island until it was flourishing. Not only that, they seemed to take pleasure in this, and created many messy so-called "Australian gadgets"—in Huang Binkun's view, these "Australian gadgets" were simply meaningless, wasting money and grain for nothing.

He thought for a long time before saying: "I think they want to build a 'New Australia'!"

"New Australia?!" Several people exclaimed in surprise.

"Exactly!" The more Huang Binkun thought about it, the more he felt his guess was correct, so he related his observations and thoughts one by one. Everyone listened very carefully.

Although their understanding of Australians could be considered rich, most of it came from Australian books and periodicals and rumors. They didn't have the personal experience of someone like Huang Binkun who had lived in Lingao for a long time and could frequently come into contact with True Hair-Bandits. Now hearing Huang Binkun's words, they were surprised and delighted.

"Ships, cannons, and machines, in the final analysis, are just ingenious objects. Having them adds color; being without them doesn't hinder the big picture." Huang Binkun spoke with assurance, "If you say they want to vie for domination of the world, why print these Australian studies books to scatter over the world? Younger Brother is in Qiongzhou, seeing the common people gradually learning Australian laws, getting used to using new Australian words, flocking to Australian customs even more, and hair-people clothing has actually become the fashion. What children sing when they have nothing to do are also hair-people nursery rhymes..."

"Transforming the civilized with the heavy!" Young Master Liang said softly.

"Exactly!" Huang Binkun slapped his fan heavily, "As for the saying that Australians are descendants of the Great Song, I absolutely don't believe it. Is there any reason for descendents of the Great Song to change their attire themselves and abandon the Great Song's dress and headgear? Apart from saying a few phrases like 'Our Great Song' and 'Australian Temporary Court,' they neither avoid the names of the Great Song's emperors of past dynasties nor use the Great Song's institutions and regulations."

"The so-called transforming the civilized with the heavy is just wishful thinking." Lin Zunxiu laughed.

Everyone nodded. Then Lin Zunxiu asked him many things about Australians first. Compared to the overseas-bizarre-tales type questions most scholars asked at the banquet that day, the questions Scholar Lin asked were mostly about the institutions and regulations implemented by Australians in Qiongzhou and their national governance strategies. The themes were not only clear but also had depth. Some questions greatly exceeded the scope of Huang Binkun's knowledge.

As the conversation grew enthusiastic, Lin Zunxiu exchanged a glance with Liang Cunhou, and Liang Cunhou nodded. Scholar Lin said: "Brother Huang, please follow me."

The group stood up. Lin Zunxiu led the way to the backyard, where there was a small two-story building built in the middle of the courtyard, not attached to any surrounding houses. Huang Binkun secretly wondered: *What kind of layout is this?*

Lin Zunxiu took a key from his sleeve and opened the building door. The first floor only had some large water vats, all filled with clear water. In the center was a staircase. Huang Binkun suddenly realized: *It turns out to be a library.*

Several people climbed the stairs up. Sure enough, the second floor was all bookshelves, piled with various books. Huang Binkun vaguely felt something was wrong, and suddenly he understood: *The collection here is solely Australian books!*

Huang Binkun had seen the scale of the Australians' library. In terms of scale, this library count for nothing. However, for a scholar's villa to actually have so many Australian books, this was truly a groundbreaking first time to see.

Lin Zunxiu said: "As long as there are Australian books on the market, I instruct servants to collect them as much as possible. Even their storybooks and novels are not missed. It's just a mix of fish and dragons, mud and sand falling together. I don't know which are useful and which are useless. Since Brother Huang comes from Lingao, I still need to ask Brother Huang for much guidance."

Huang Binkun took a look. The collection inside really had everything. From various "magazines," "pictorials," "readers" he saw in Guangzhou bookstores, to "textbooks" only available in Lingao... it could be said to have everything one could expect. In the corner, there was also a shelf piled with things he was very familiar with: *Lingao Times*—almost every household of the gentry in Lingao subscribed to a copy to study the Australians' policy trends.

"*Lingao Times*!" He couldn't help crying out, walking a few steps quickly to the bookshelf.

He saw these newspapers stacked neatly according to month and date. However, judging from the freshness of the paper, it seemed they weren't read much.

"This is the Australian court gazette I specially commissioned Owner Guo to buy from Lingao." Liang Cunhou said, "He sends it to me once a month. Looking at the dates on it, is it published daily?"

"Exactly!" Huang Binkun said, "So-called daily newspaper. One sheet is issued every day." He rubbed the paper, "This newspaper has a lot of substance in it!"

"Please teach me, Brother Huang!" The eyes of several people revealed light. They knew that this newspaper was equivalent to the Australians' "court gazette." Reading court gazettes to know the court's direction was an ancient practice. But they had absolutely no concept of how the Australians' "court" operated or how to judge it. Moreover, this Australian court gazette was full of odds and ends, from astronomy and geography above to agricultural seasons and farming below, and even everyday street life—everything was there. To see the "direction" from it was truly very difficult.

Huang Binkun was very proud—among the gentry in Lingao, there was already a certain understanding of judging what the Australians probably wanted to do from the *Lingao Times*. He randomly pulled out an old newspaper.

The headline on the front page was *Maintaining Maritime Trade Order is the Senate's Unshirkable Responsibility*.

"Gentlemen, please look. What does this article explain?"

Several people read it once. The article mixed narrative and commentary, saying nothing more than that maritime trade order must be stable and safe, so that it could benefit the livelihood and prosperity of countries along the coast, and words to that effect.

"Can't see anything." Wu Ming spoke, "I think it's just the sea power the Australians advocate all day long."

Huang Binkun nodded, flipped to the second page, and pointed to an article on it, saying: "Look at this one again."

The title of this one was *Quanzhou Prefecture Brews Tragedy Again—A Maritime Merchant's Whole Family Commits Suicide*. The article talked about a certain maritime merchant whose ship was intercepted by Zheng Zhilong because he hadn't bought the Zheng family's trade command flag, and the ship and cargo were all confiscated. The involved maritime merchant lost his family fortune, and the whole family committed suicide.

The group was silent, pondering slightly. Huang Binkun then flipped to another section, where there was another article: *What Limits the Steps of Huaxia Maritime Merchants*.

"...And this one: *European Nations Navigation Record (Serialized)*."

"These?" Several people looked at Huang Binkun with puzzled eyes—although they probably understood a bit, they felt there was a layer of separation.

Huang Binkun pointed at the date and said: "The date this paper was issued was three months before the Australians attacked Zhongzuo and severely defeated Zheng Zhilong..."

"So that's how it is! So that's how it is!" Scholar Shi was greatly excited, "Brother Huang truly wakes the dreamer with a single word!"

"You flatter me!" Huang Binkun said, "From this newspaper, one can not only know the direction of the hair-bandits... Australians' court situation but also see other things. The profundities are endless."

"In the future, we will still need Brother Huang to give much guidance!" Lin Zunxiu was also very happy, "Brother Huang is truly the Number One Talent in Bandit Affairs! Seeing you today, we must drink a large cup."

By the mottled bamboo forest, in the Bamboo Pavilion, the group talked heart-to-heart freely. The western sky gradually turned from bright to crimson. Finally, the setting sun broke through the clouds and, in the last moment before falling into the western mountains, revealed its fiery red corner. The afterglow dyed Baiyun Mountain completely red, foreshadowing that tomorrow would be a sunny day. Lin Zunxiu beckoned to the servant outside the window. When the person came in, he instructed:

"Prepare a banquet. Tonight, I want to drink with the brothers until we drop!"

A few days after returning from the Bamboo Pavilion, Huang Binkun found that he had muddily become a "Bandit Affairs Talent" and a "Banditology Master." Visitors to the inn were endless every day, and the inn's entrance was like a marketplace, making him very uneasy. Fortunately, with Liang Cunhou's help, he soon moved out of the inn and temporarily stayed in a temple inside the city. The environment here was quiet and the housing elegant. Lin Zunxiu also sent a handsome page boy to serve his daily life. His days were spent contentedly.

It was just that the list of names of civil and military officials and advisors who had participated in the campaign against the hair-bandits back then, which he had asked Young Master Liang to find, yielded no results after he quietly visited a few people. When entering their homes, upon hearing he was from Lingao, they politely invited him in, and the gatekeeper didn't even ask for a tip. But after entering and talking face-to-face with the master, they just exchanged a few pleasantries and saw him off. Although servants came to present local products the next day, there were no further expressions.

Huang Binkun hit a soft nail again this day and walked back in a foul mood. It was already time to light lamps. Although there was no curfew in the great port of Guangzhou, there were not many pedestrians on the road. On the way back to his residence, Huang Binkun constantly felt someone following him. One alley away from the temple, he saw a figure seeming to flash at the corner, and they seemed to have a weapon in hand. Huang Binkun didn't think much and prepared to bypass this small alley and take a long way around. As soon as he turned around, he saw two dark figures spring out from the corner, swinging sticks at Huang Binkun's head. Fortunately, Huang Binkun had suppressed bandits and gone into battle before. He was agile and even more quick-witted. He easily dodged the stick aimed at his head, punched the comer in the face, kicked another one away, and turned to run, only to see three more people running over with sticks. The several people surrounded Huang Binkun in the center. Huang Binkun saw that these five people were all dressed in scholar's robes, but their skin was dark and arm muscles slightly bulging, clearly having done farm work. One of them shouted loudly: "Hair-bandit! Stop right there!"
