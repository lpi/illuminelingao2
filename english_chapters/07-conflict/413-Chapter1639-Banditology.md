# Chapter 1639 - Banditology

Following the banquet, Huang Binkun was considered a "member" of this circle of scholars. Only toward the evening's end did he learn that most belonged to the "Yuyuan Society," which ostensibly devoted itself to "exploring essays, reciting poetry, and composing *fu*"—but in truth was simply a group mixing together to eat, drink, amuse themselves, write verses, and discuss national affairs.

The society maintained a loose organization. Its membership was not limited to students of the Nanhai County School—there were also *juren* like Liang Cunhou and scholars without degrees like Wu Ming. Among them, Lin Zunxiu served as the financier, while Liang Cunhou vaguely assumed the role of leader.

A few days later, Lin Zunxiu invited Huang Binkun to his "villa" for recreation.

The Lin family's villa lay at the foot of Baiyun Mountain. It bore the elegant name "Bamboo Garden," though in truth it was merely a separate residence in the mountain woods. The furnishings were ordinary, but the surrounding scenery was beautiful and the atmosphere tranquil. Not far from Guangzhou City, one could travel there and back within the same day. Lin Zunxiu used this place as a gathering venue for Yuyuan Society members—particularly the inner circle.

When Huang Binkun arrived, he discovered Young Master Liang had already preceded him. Observing the slight smile at the corner of his mouth, Huang Binkun understood at once that inviting him here must have been Liang Cunhou's idea.

This was somewhat puzzling. Though Huang Binkun knew most Yuyuan Society members harbored goodwill toward the Hair-bandits and intended to profit from their rise, Young Master Liang's attitude remained ambiguous. Huang Binkun sensed instinctively that his thoughts ran deeper than the others'.

Besides Young Master Liang, several other scholars were present. Some he had seen at the restaurant; others had not attended the banquet. Scholar Shi and Wu Ming, who enjoyed making provocative statements, were both in attendance. Lin Zunxiu introduced them one by one.

After servants served tea and they chatted for a while, Scholar Lin broached the main topic.

It turned out these few were all scholars obsessed with "Bandit Affairs." Among them, the one with the greatest interest was actually Young Master Liang—the very man who rarely discussed "Australians" outside these walls.

Speaking of historical connections with the Australians, in all of Guangzhou City, he was probably second only to Gao Ju himself. Years ago, when Guo Yi organized the charity hall and launched businesses, the Liang family had contributed considerably. Later, when the Ming army campaigned against Lingao, the Liang family had also secretly protected Guo Yi's remaining properties and personnel in many ways. Thus, as soon as Guo Yi returned to Guangzhou, he had quietly paid a visit.

However, their interaction was limited to this. The Liang family, being officials for generations, exercised extreme caution regarding dealings with Australians and remained unwilling to be tainted too much by their association. After all, consorting with overseas peoples not only sounded improper but also courted disaster.

Though maintaining distance, Liang Cunhou had always been intensely interested in everything concerning the Australians. In his view, though Australian influence in Guangzhou City grew day by day and many scholars discussed "Australians" and "Banditology," most merely scratched an itch from outside the boot—no one truly understood the Hair-bandits.

The Yuyuan Society provided him an excellent opportunity to gather like-minded individuals for studying the Australians—because of his status, it was inconvenient for him to openly discuss "Banditology" or collect Hair-bandit materials everywhere. Under the cover of the Yuyuan Society, it was far easier. Around him, a group of scholars obsessed with Banditology had gathered. They used this place to discuss Banditology, collect various "Australian books," envisioning that one day they might organize "Bandit Affairs" to enrich the country and strengthen the army, supporting the Great Ming's restoration.

Huang Binkun was secretly alarmed—he had not expected such a group to exist in Guangzhou City! However, observing their discourse, they were neither like those scholars in the restaurant anxious to "follow the dragon," nor like officials who feared bandits as they feared tigers. Instead, they harbored genuine concern for the country and its people.

*These are the talents I seek!* Huang Binkun rejoiced inwardly.

The topic began with a copy of the Australian book *Elementary Knowledge of Physics* that Scholar Lin had recently purchased. The reason for acquiring this book was that they had heard many of the Australians' "ingenious objects" were based upon its principles. In truth, the book drew from popular science physics texts, covering mass, the interaction of forces, conservation of energy—the most fundamental physics concepts. It contained no practical applications. For scholars perpetually steeped in poetry and classics, it proved genuinely abstruse.

Because Huang Binkun had read Huang Ping's textbooks and heard him explain some of the content, he could elucidate the underlying principles. He promptly selected what he knew and explained it in detail.

"Banditology is indeed abstruse," Lin Zunxiu shook his head. "It seems that to truly launch Bandit Affairs, specialized talents are absolutely necessary."

"Back when Chief Manager Li wanted to purchase a cannon factory from the Australians and hire their craftsmen, the Australians refused to allow it," Scholar Shi said. "I believe this matter is difficult."

"If they won't hire out craftsmen, can't we send our own people to learn?" Huang Binkun interjected.

"Go learn?" Several pairs of eyes widened.

"Precisely." Huang Binkun nodded. "The Hair-bandits love to play the teacher. They run schools in Lingao, teaching the learning of the Hair-people. They collect children everywhere to enroll—this younger brother once sent a young pageboy to study Bandit Learning."

"How did he fare?" Liang Cunhou was greatly concerned. "Did he learn the methods of building cannons and ships?"

"That represents the highest level within Banditology—he hasn't reached it yet. But this book—" Huang Binkun pointed at *Elementary Knowledge of Physics* with his fan. "He understands everything in it."

"Such a thing is possible!" Lin Zunxiu was greatly excited. "I wonder if Brother Huang has connections? I would also like to send a few pageboys to study Banditology!"

"Worthy Brother Lin, don't press others," Liang Cunhou said. "This matter can be discussed at leisure later."

Huang Binkun hastened to add: "The Australians maintain strict surveillance both internally and externally; they generally don't accept outside students. But if one seeks avenues, it's not impossible. However..."

"However what? Could the tuition be expensive? That's no concern."

"It's not a matter of money." Huang Binkun thought of his own Huang Ping and could not help sighing. "Gentlemen may not realize—Australians are most skilled at confusing hearts. A perfectly good child, upon entering their school, within a year or two becomes a 'Fake Bandit.' Forgetting their masters, indifferent to ancestors—all principles of heaven and human feeling cast aside. Everything becomes Australian learning, Australian rules..."

"One must find older children, resolute in character and able to read, to send."

"Where would one find such children!" Scholar Shi said. "Which family would willingly send a literate child to study Banditology? If it's ordinary servants and pageboys who are dull and ignorant—as Brother Huang says, wouldn't they also be confused after going..."

"It seems this matter is very difficult."

Speaking of Banditology, Lin Zunxiu possessed the greatest interest and considered himself the deepest researcher. He unconsciously launched into impassioned discourse:

"Difficult as it may be, we must find a way! Banditology is the urgent matter of our times! Since the iron ship sailed north in the early years of Chongzhen, entered our Qiongzhou, and defeated our Royal Army, in just three or four years they have become like a state unto themselves. They build machines, repair warships, entice commoners to cross the sea and join them. The government cannot restrain them! This is indeed a great transformation unseen in three thousand years. China's bows, spears, and bird guns cannot match the Hair-people's artillery and cannons; China's boats and ships cannot match the Hair-people's steam-powered warships. Thus we are constrained at every turn. In today's circumstances, to speak idly of expelling barbarians and driving them beyond our borders is surely delusional talk. Even wishing to preserve peace and guard our territory—without guns, cannons, and warships—is empty talk. This student believes the way to strengthen ourselves lies in mastering their techniques and seizing what they rely upon. Therefore, we cannot help but learn Banditology and manage Bandit Affairs. Establish cannon factories, build shipyards. These Hair-people's guns, cannons, and warships are mostly manufactured in Qiongzhou. The iron they use is Chinese iron; the craftsmen are merely exiled commoners. Yet they can wield these to invade and bully our Great Ming. If we can truly master their methods deeply, we too can build ships and cannons like the Hair-people. Perhaps we might even surpass them. At that time, we need not worry about failing to exterminate the Hair-bandits!"

Huang Binkun listened to this grand discourse with rapt attention, deeply appreciating the argument of "a great transformation unseen in three thousand years." This was a thunderclap that could wake sleepers. What a pity that the Emperor, the ministers of the central government, and the governors, inspectors, and surveillance commissioners of various provinces could not hear it. Apart from a single "Australian Goods," practically no one had truly grasped the depth of the Hair-bandits' machinations.

"Brother Lin, to summarize today's situation with 'a great transformation unseen in three thousand years' is most concise and stirring. With this phrase as the central thesis, you could well write a great article using the content you just mentioned—circulate it and shake everyone under heaven."

"Hah, if I wrote such an article, the scholars under heaven would curse me to death." A helpless smile appeared on Lin Zunxiu's face. "Calling it 'alarmist' would be light; should they say I'm 'blaspheming sage learning,' I would be beyond redemption."

Liang Cunhou gently tapped his palm with his fan. "Worthy Brother Lin worries overmuch. Whether learning Banditology, managing Bandit Affairs, or borrowing their good methods and systems, there is a fundamental principle to always remember: it must be grounded in our Chinese Confucian moral code. Take China's ethics and moral code as the essence, supplemented by the Hair-people's techniques for wealth and power."

"Precisely! Brother Liang speaks excellently!" Several voices clapped in agreement. "Banditology for utility, Chinese learning for essence. The Australians' strengths must be learned; our ancestors' legacy must be preserved all the more!"

Huang Binkun agreed wholeheartedly. Just as he was about to speak, Scholar Shi interjected: "Learning Banditology and managing Bandit Affairs—leaving aside whether we can exterminate the Australians, at least we can protect ourselves." Despite his appearance as an overweight man aloof from worldly concerns, when discussing matters, Scholar Shi showed no ambiguity whatsoever. "Years ago, when the Australians' forces approached Bai'etan and burned the Five Rams Station, our troops had no power to retaliate. Fortunately, the Australians prize commerce and value profit. Otherwise, I fear Guangzhou City would have fallen into their hands long ago!"

Wu Ming laughed coldly. "Is it not already theirs? I'm not being alarmist—if the Australians wanted this Guangzhou City, taking it would be effortless."

"True, inside this Guangzhou City lies a mountain of gold and a sea of silver."

"Then why don't they take it?" Liang Cunhou suddenly asked.

"For business." Wu Ming snapped his fan shut. "It's not difficult for the Australians to seize Guangzhou. The difficulty is that once they take Guangzhou, they can no longer trade with the Great Ming. What does a mountain of gold or sea of silver within the city matter? What they value is not money!"

Huang Binkun could not help chiming in: "What you say is precisely right! Though the Hair-people claim to love commerce and pursue profit, in reality, what they scheme for is something else entirely!"

"Then what do they scheme for?"
