# Chapter 1376 - Semi-Mechanized Filature

Having arranged the matter of forming the security force, Master Zhao felt at ease in body and mind. The reliability of the Star-Stepping Squad naturally couldn't compare to armies trained by the Council of Elders, but he was now the master and provider for these people - they had no choice but to risk their lives for him. Besides, he had also given Zhao Tong instructions: "The authority of Master Zhao must be greatly established and promoted."

Just as he was feeling pleased with himself, someone came to report: "Miss Li has arrived."

Li Yao'er had been running between the silkworm seed farm and the filature these days, leading a group of students from the "Sericulture Training Class," both raising silkworms and reeling silk - in fact, her own knowledge of these things was also limited, all relying on crash courses when she was in Hainan. So leading students was very exhausting. Her genes that she had complained about for years - "This lady is just the type that gains weight easily, even drinking water makes me fat" - seemed to have suddenly disappeared. Her face was thinner by a size, and the flaw that had always troubled her when wearing skirts - the excess flesh on her thighs - had also vanished without a trace. She was startled to discover during evening baths that she had become firm and toned.

The servants looked at Li Yao'er's haggard face and her running up and down the mountain every day, feet never touching the ground, and whispered among themselves that Master Zhao really had sharp eyes for picking people: even taking a concubine who could work so hard.

"When will the boiler workers arrive?" This was Li Yao'er's first sentence upon entering.

Phoenix Mountain Villa already had a boiler, but this boiler was used to support the villa's water pump. Currently, the villa's water supply had already squeezed out all the remaining capacity of this equipment. Making it additionally bear the burden of supplying steam and water to the filature was truly overwhelming.

For this purpose, the Mechanical Division had supplied two new boilers, respectively for supplying hot water and driving the water pump to supply water to the filature. This way, new equipment operators and maintenance workers had to be assigned.

"The telegram said they would arrive on this ship, either tonight or early tomorrow morning." Zhao Yingong looked at this nominal "concubine" of his. She was still in that outfit: narrow-sleeved jacket with a vest outside. Only her double-bun hairstyle was a bit askew, looking somewhat messy. Her face was puffy, her eyes full of red veins, looking extremely overworked.

"Without firing up the boiler room, the trial reeling simply can't be done. Cocoons don't wait for anyone."

The silkworm cocoons Phoenix Mountain Villa had obtained through small loans and purchases were now all piled in the warehouse at the foot of the mountain. Fresh cocoons couldn't be stored for long. According to the general work process, the silkworm cocoons first had to be dried to kill the pupae before they could be preserved for a longer time. A centralized drying room had already been built in the filature, but this required the boiler to provide heat. Moreover, the filature itself also needed large amounts of hot water.

"When the workers arrive, have them start working," Zhao Yingong said. "How is the training of the silk reeling female workers going?"

"They can already start work." Li Yao'er said, "Most of them know how to reel silk the traditional way. The method is actually about the same, except that the original hand-cranking is now changed to foot-pedaling." She was somewhat worried. "This set of equipment, to tell the truth, I'm a bit worried. It's another revived product. Can it be put to use? This is the first time it's been made..."

"No, this is not the first time it's been made." Zhao Yingong said, "The Mechanical Division made a prototype and ran it experimentally in Lingao. Otherwise, they wouldn't dare give us an experimental product to use directly, right?"

"I hope so." Li Yao'er didn't have as much confidence as Zhao Yingong. The boiler and equipment had been technically debugged and confirmed normal by the Elder responsible for installation. Barring accidents, as long as the workers arrived tomorrow, it could be officially fired up and used. But whether this brand-new filature could produce normally under her half-baked "technical guidance" - she really felt afraid.

Originally, she had just wanted to grow some herbs, do some gardening, and then artificially cultivate ginseng. Slowly, it had become the potato cultivation journey on Jeju Island, and then she arrived in Hangzhou and became a sericulture technician. Now, she realized she had suddenly become the manager of a filature! This transformation was too fast.

"Let's go to the filature and take a look." Zhao Yingong encouraged her. "See the great power of industry."

For convenience of water use and drainage, the Cihui Hall Filature was located at the foot of Phoenix Mountain Villa, near the Fuchun River. The Cihui Hall refugee camp dormitory was right next door, saving the cost of specially building worker dormitories and canteens. The ten-meter-high red brick chimney stood alone by the river, very conspicuous.

In the boiler room below the chimney, a Lancashire boiler was installed specifically to supply hot water and steam, and a power fire-tube boiler was installed to drive the water pump.

A wall separated the filature from the surroundings. Inside were rows of houses that looked somewhat strange against the backdrop of the local scenery.

There were household servants standing guard at the factory gate. They were under Zhao Tong's command and recognized Zhao Yingong and Li Yao'er, so they let them in.

Although the factory had completed construction and installation of all buildings and equipment and was in a state ready to start production at any time, it was empty inside now. Apart from a few servants on duty in the factory warehouse who hurried out to pay respects when they saw them arrive, all the workshops were empty.

Both Li Yao'er and Zhao Yingong were standing in a real filature workshop for the first time. The Lingao-manufactured equipment was neatly arranged on the bases, with various brackets, pipes, and valves intricately arranged together. Zhao Yingong had originally thought this set of equipment would definitely be very crude. However, truly standing before these crude pieces of equipment, he realized his own insight was really too shallow.

If he didn't have a manual in his hands, he simply couldn't explain the principles and operating modes of this equipment that was considered "backward" and "simple."

A single person was really too insignificant before the crystallization of wisdom gathered from countless people that was large-scale industry.

Workstations connected by countless pipes and brackets were arranged one after another, like a sleeping dragon. Once awakened, the fire and smoke it would spew would converge into terrifying productivity, burning the production methods of the old world to ashes. Making countless people perish together with it.

Zhao Yingong couldn't help but feel surging emotions and said: "This is large-scale industry!"

Li Yao'er didn't feel it as deeply as he did, but the factory and equipment before her also moved her. However, thinking that this filature and the female workers who would soon fill these workstations were all under her management, Li Yao'er began to feel a bit panicked - this was too terrifying! Could she handle it?

However, she didn't dare say these words. Right now, there were only two Elders at Hangzhou Station, and they needed to support each other, especially to encourage each other. It was better to say fewer discouraging words.

"Our filature looks quite high-end, grand, and classy..." Zhao Yingong seemed to be trying to dispel her unease and said somewhat jokingly.

The equipment used by Cihui Hall Filature was a modified imitation made by the Mechanical Division based on the equipment "Steam-Powered Great Device" of the Jichang Long Filature run by Chen Qiyuan in the 19th century. The technical level was very low - even by 19th-century standards, it could only be considered semi-mechanized production. But its advantage was that operation and maintenance were very simple, perfectly suited to the social conditions of the time.

The filature that the Council of Elders wanted to establish in the 17th-century Ming Dynasty naturally had the 19th-century Jichang Long as the most ready example. Therefore, not only was the equipment imitated, but the factory layout and management model were also referenced.

The greatest advance of the Jichang Long's Steam-Powered Great Device was using steam to cook cocoons instead of the charcoal fire cooking handed down through generations of hand reeling. This was a major advance in production technology.

The cocoon itself was formed by silkworm-spun fibers stuck together by sericin. Getting the silk out was like peeling apart stamps - water had to be used to dissolve the sericin. With traditional charcoal fire cooking, the temperature couldn't be constant, affecting silk yield and texture. The unified circulating water supply used by the "Jichang Long" factory ensured stable temperature and clean, fresh water quality for silk reeling. Therefore, the silk was even in thickness, clean in color, and lustrous - this was determined by improvements in silk reeling technology.

Although this set of equipment had a boiler, mechanical power was not used in silk reeling. Instead, foot-pedal-driven equipment was used. Therefore, it still couldn't be considered a mechanized filature. Purely from the silk reeling perspective, although the equipment speed of foot-pedal equipment was more stable and uniform than the hand-cranking method of traditional silk machines, it still couldn't compare with the effect of a prime mover, and the evenness of the silk produced was also a level lower. Li Yao'er knew that this kind of silk could only be called "improved silk." It was still considered good quality in the 19th century, but became outdated after the early 20th century and couldn't even be exported. The silk improvement work done by Suzhou Sericulture College at Kaixian Village also used similar human-powered "improved machines," but the raw silk produced couldn't reach export standards. However, compared to handmade raw silk, it was already tender and smooth, even and white.

But in this time and space, this minor flaw wasn't a flaw at all. One should know that among the raw silk Zheng Zhilong exported to Japan, there was so-called "yellow raw silk" - actually just yellowish stale silk from previous years. Generally speaking, it was worthless, yet it could actually be used for export. This showed how urgent the international market demand for raw silk was at that time. The silk reeled by Cihui Hall Filature's Steam-Powered Great Device would inevitably be better than even the best Huzhou silk.

The filature had a total of 300 foot-pedal silk reeling workstations, one cocoon baking room, along with auxiliary rooms such as the baking house, baking shed, and cocoon storage room. Each workstation was equipped with a round kettle, with steam pipes beneath the kettle to keep the water in the kettle constantly at the required temperature for cooking and rinsing cocoons. Hot and cold water taps were also installed. Boiling water was used for rinsing cocoons. Cold water was used to regulate temperature and perform necessary washing, enabling rapid silk extraction. This facilitated quickly drawing out the silk ends onto the reel.

The Steam-Powered Great Device improved labor productivity very significantly. According to Chen Qiyuan's experience running Jichang Long: each female worker could match the work of more than ten people. Hand silk reeling allowed each worker to manage ten silk ends, while machine silk reeling could manage sixty silk ends. Those with good skills could even manage over a hundred ends, improving labor productivity by six to ten times. Although Zhao Yingong had no factory experience, he knew that the equipment manufactured by the Mechanical Division had significant improvements over the Jichang Long prototype, so the efficiency improvement should be more than this. Plus, the Industrial Bureau personnel were designing the filature's labor management system based on "Taylor's principles," so worker efficiency would improve even more.
