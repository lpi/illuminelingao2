# Chapter 1250 - Naval Battle (Part 1)

At this time, the First Squadron used *Lichun* as the lead ship—it had the fastest speed, highest masts, and largest effective observation range. With "high-power" observation binoculars provided by the Optical Factory, the Navy had an incomparable advantage in "search."

At 7:50, *Lichun* received the following telegram: "Enemy fleet has departed Xiamen Island. Main force comprises three three-masted gunships and two European-style sailing ships, 14 other sailing ships, 90-100 fire ships. Heading toward Kinmen Island."

The telegram was sent by scouts of the Special Recon team ambushing on Xiamen Island. Seeing the telegram, Ming Qiu realized the enemy's "decisive battle" fleet was approaching him. Fire ships were Zheng Zhilong's final killer move; this time the opponent was definitely coming with the idea of a fight to the death.

He looked at the current current and wind direction. The enemy was coming with wind and tide; speed might be as high as 5-6 knots. Calculating this way, they would encounter each other in less than two hours.

The enemy could easily discover them—rolling black smoke spewing from funnels was enough to be the most obvious marker. The enemy came prepared and would definitely strive to intercept the First Squadron at sea for a "decisive battle."

At 8:00 sharp, urgent battle drums sounded. Sailors who had relaxed somewhat tensed up again. Everyone began re-executing pre-battle preparations: clearing battle stations, checking gun bores. Every gun began slowly rotating and elevating. Gunners imagined enemies appearing on the horizon, beginning simulation drills. Marines squeezed below deck were ordered to rest—lacking space to lie down, they closed their eyes to doze leaning against each other. They knew after experiencing an exciting early morning, they probably wouldn't be able to lie down to rest until final victory.

At 9:17, *Qingdian* spewed an unusually thick black smoke column due to engine overheating, attracting the attention of sailors in the crow's nest of Zheng Lian's flagship to the northwest.

Zheng Lian was originally looking for a chance—the longer the sea transit, the more disadvantageous for him. Sailing a large formation of sailing ships was a difficult matter. Although in an inland sea like Xiamen Bay, and the Zheng family had relatively more experience in formation sailing, requiring over 100 dilapidated fire ships to maintain stable course and speed for a long time to coordinate with the covering fleet was simply too difficult.

Now that sailors discovered the smoke column, he realized the Australian fleet was right before his eyes. Zheng Lian visually estimated wind and tide, both favorable to his side. Confidence surging, he immediately ordered the helmsman to turn the rudder, heading toward the smoke column.

At 9:19, the lookout on *Lichun* reported: "100 enemy ships, bearing northwest by west, 2.5 nautical miles, closing."

News of contacting the enemy was communicated by flag and light signals to the 4 gunboats following behind.

*Lichun* maintained course, continuing forward, guns all pointing in the direction of the incoming enemy ships. Ming Qiu wasn't worried at all about the Zheng family's 19 warships—destined to be cannon fodder. The only threat was those fire ships. Once hit by a fire ship, the consequences would be unimaginable—Zheng Zhilong had used fire ship tactics multiple times, inflicting heavy damage on Dutch warships, possessing successful combat experience. It had to be treated seriously.

To counter the fire ship tactics prevalent in the South China Sea, *Lichun* and the other four gunboats each installed a 5-barrel Hotchkiss manual rotary cannon. As a supplement to the typewriters, these two rapid-fire weapons had strong lethal effects on small vessels. They were sharp weapons against "ship swarm" tactics like fire ships.

Of course, even without these, the Senate Navy wasn't afraid of fire ships—in 1840 the British, with neither typewriters nor Hotchkiss rotary cannons, destroyed all Manchu Qing fire attacks relying solely on rowboats and steam paddlewheelers. The Senate's emphasis on this was nothing more than a reaction under the dual mindset of "caution" plus "crushing."

Since the First Squadron had only five warships, Ming Qiu made no complex tactical deployments. He ordered the signal: "Follow me closely!" Then increased boiler pressure, steaming toward the enemy fleet at 12 knots.

At 9:30, the lookout sailor atop the mast of Zheng Lian's flagship discovered large patches of smoke columns on the southeast horizon. Moments later he began to distinguish towering masts; it was *Lichun's* foremast. Distance between sides was 5500 meters.

The woo-woo of conch shells sounded successively on the decks of Zheng Lian's fleet. Zheng Lian watched the fire ship fleet on his fleet's right from the stern castle. Over 100 fire ships formed a column several nautical miles long, looking very magnificent, but long sailing had stretched their formation very long. He was somewhat anxious; like this, fire ships would be hard pressed to swarm into action, easily evaded or sunk by enemy ships.

"Lower topsails, let the fire ships catch up!" Zheng Lian issued the order.

Ming Qiu had been observing enemy movements with binoculars. Noticing Zheng Lian's fleet beginning to lower sails, he realized the enemy was waiting for fire ships to catch up—fire ships varied in size and type, impossible to coordinate speed, inevitably resulting in some fast and some slow. To ensure fire ships could form overwhelming numerical superiority in a short time, the enemy had to slow down to wait for lagging ships.

This was exactly the timing to defeat them in detail. He ordered: "Left rudder 15 degrees. Full speed ahead!"

"15 degrees—left—" The helmsman repeated his order with drawn-out tones. At this time the engine room telegraph rang. *Lichun's* funnel spewed large amounts of black smoke. Below deck, machinery and boilers roared; the deck vibrated with it.

The four gunboats close behind *Lichun* adjusted course one after another, seizing the T-crossing position.

Li Huamei stood at her post on deck, eating dry rations for breakfast. Besides rock-hard Navy biscuits, everyone had a cup of sugary black tea, refreshing and quick to replenish energy. Li Huamei felt she hadn't contributed much in the early morning shelling action—she just stood at her post looking out for abnormalities, waiting for orders momentarily. Although she received not a single order from start to finish, she had consumed massive calories in intense excitement and nervousness, so that these dry, tasteless Navy rations became delicious.

Suddenly whistles blew on deck: "Prepare for battle!"

Li Huamei hurriedly stuffed the remaining biscuits into her mouth in two or three bites, drank the tea in one gulp, and stood up to gaze into the distance. Has the Zheng fleet come out?

If hitting the Zheng family just now was a surprise attack, somewhat unfair, then this time both sides could be considered arrayed in formal battle lines, fighting face to face. Li Huamei knew, for the Zheng family to dare come out to fight with their main force annihilated, they would definitely use their consistent killer move—fire ships.

In terms of cannon power and range, the Zheng fleet was absolutely no match. But fire ships were their only chip to snatch victory from defeat. Li Huamei was very curious to see how the Australians would deal with this sea of fire ships—knowing even the Dutch were very afraid of this.

Comparing, he raised the telescope bought from the Dutch, slowly extending the tube. The sea surface was smooth as a mirror. The Australian warships began to reveal blurry silhouettes: A big fellow! Masts towering, spewing black smoke. Behind it, four black warships formed a column, cleaving waves toward them. Each looming like a mountain, motionless as the earth, black smoke rolling like fire sweeping in. Zheng Lian's hand involuntarily trembled. He knew he couldn't wait for the fire ships to catch up; he had to engage immediately to stall the enemy. He shouted:

"Light matches!"

Lighting matches was the order for imminent combat. As the command was passed down, gunners stripped off shirts, lit slow matches, opened powder jars. Holding breath and concentrating, waiting only for the leader's order to fire.

At this time Zheng Lian's warships formed three columns. Two European-style "夹板" ships and three three-masted gunships sailed in column; on the other side were 14 large Guangdong and Fujian ships in double column. Further north of these two columns was the fire ship fleet, formationless and stretching several nautical miles long.

At this time, the First Squadron was bearing south-by-west of Zheng Lian's fleet main column, forming an oblique T-head with Zheng Lian's fleet. Although the formation wasn't perfect, it was enough for the First Squadron to unleash broadside firepower.

Fleets closed. Distance 4500 meters. First Squadron gunners rubbed their hands. Sailors pushed ramrods; HE shells were loaded into bores. Guns began to traverse, barrels elevating, ready to fire at any moment.

Warships of both sides got closer and closer, sizing each other up at such close range. The two largest maritime powers in the East Asian seas were about to fight to the death. The Senate wanted to rule the ocean; the Zheng family wanted to monopolize trade. Neither giving an inch. Hulls rose and fell in the waves, distance gradually closing, heavy and slow.

Li Ziping was in the fire control tower at this time—he wasn't reassured by the gunnery of naturalized naval officers, so he came personally to supervise. instructing every link of firing: "Be bold but careful! Don't panic!" As he spoke he lit the cigar in his mouth, staring at the gradually approaching Zheng warships in the distance.

Distance 2800 meters. This was about the limit of effective range for the few 24-pound bronze cannons on Zheng Lian's flagship. Zheng Lian knew although this gun could reach that far, firing at this distance was just listening to the noise. Zheng Lian wasn't an ignorant pirate; he frequently contacted European seamen and ships, knowing when Dutch and Spanish fought at sea, they had to close to one or two hundred *zhang* before opening fire. So he held back the order to fire.

But Ming Qiu intended to fully utilize his advantage. Although hit rates weren't high at this distance, their rifled guns and primitive fire control technology gave them a considerable advantage.
