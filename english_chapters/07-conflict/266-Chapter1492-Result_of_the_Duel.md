# Chapter 1492 - Result of the Duel

"Rest assured, they have changed their attitude," Hale said. "Additionally, I know you have many connections in Japan. If you could send more Catholics from Japan to the Philippines to build an Eden on earth, I would be infinitely grateful."

"Population from Fujian is no problem. Japanese Catholics I'm afraid are very difficult. The Shogunate basically allows no one to go abroad..."

"You see, if everything has to go through the government, people like us would have no value of existence, right?"

Zheng Zhifeng laughed loudly. He hadn't laughed like this for a long time since the battle of Weitou Bay. He said:

"You truly are a remarkable man!"

Next, Hale demonstrated the launch of Congreve rockets. Zheng Zhifeng was clear about the rocket's power—he had witnessed with his own eyes how rockets fired from ships turned the entire anchorage into a sea of fire when Australian warships attacked Kinmen Island. Now discovering the man before him could also provide similar rockets, he was simply overjoyed.

"You see, if those wooden boxes of yours are equipped with rocket launchers, one salvo can deal a fatal blow to the enemy. Especially for attacks on enemy ports. Putting them to the torch is a piece of cake."

"I just want to know, how many rockets can you sell me next time I come?"

"This is no problem, no problem. Now let's talk about the price..."

Watching Zheng Zhifeng's ship leave, Hale's men on the island packed up items and began loading boats prepared to return to the estate outside Manila. Chests unloaded from Zheng Zhifeng's ship contained, besides silver—Spanish pesos and Chinese silver ingots—some exquisite handicrafts and silks he specified to be sent, all used to please local dignitaries.

Marcos came to report that things were all loaded onto his flagship.

"Marcos, do you say this Chinese man truly understands the real power contained behind cannons?"

"I think he doesn't understand..."

"Yes, if he understood, he should have long knelt to surrender to Australians, instead of making this futile struggle." Hale put on his hood.

Behind cannons lay a nation's industrial power. Let alone dozens of cannons, even giving the Zheng family several times more cannons couldn't change their decisive disadvantage against Australians. Those Chinese claiming to be Australians already possessed steamships, rifled guns, rifled cannons with obvious signs of self-manufacture—this was already strength possessing a primary industrial nation's foundation. It was no longer something an agricultural nation of this spacetime could contend with.

"He has much courage—like us. Otherwise, we should also surrender immediately."

"Exactly, my dear Marcos," Hale said. "Let's hurry back to the estate. I expect the Baroness will have a new invitation tonight."

In Manila, as long as it didn't rain, the weather approaching noon would force people to hide back indoors, whiling away this terrible time inside mosquito nets and on beds. Even the colony's core, the Governor's Palace shaded by greenery, seemed no exception; first-floor windows were shielded by wooden shutters, and huge louvers on the second floor were tightly closed. Silence reigned all around; even colonial sentries under the porch held pikes, leaning against door pillars half-dozing.

In fact, the place housing the heart and brain of this Philippine colony could absolutely not get such leisure. This residence located by an eye-catching square with lush flowers and trees in the core area of Intramuros was a massive and seemingly proper two-story stone masonry building. In the Philippine colony full of bamboo stilt houses and thatched huts everywhere, stone buildings were the symbol of Spanish ruling power. Like most high-class buildings in the Philippines, the ground floor served as storerooms and servant quarters, while the second floor was for the master's living. Between floors was a mezzanine where Governor Juan Salamanca chose to work and deal with government officials.

Louvers were closed tightly to resist fierce sunlight, making the already poorly lit hall appear even dimmer. A small glass oil lamp flickered on the long table, illuminating the Governor sitting at the table and several Manila bigwigs.

"Mr. Osvaldo, my confusion lies in how you and your clerks wrote such an absurd report?" Governor Salamanca pointed at a stack of Australian paper scattered on the table, "Do you not understand what the niter collection pond Mr. Paul mentioned is? It just needs digging a few ponds, dumping in feces, garbage, and wood ash. Yet you want me to believe this bit of work costs 2000 pesos, requiring another 500 pesos annually. The niter collection pond in the munitions factory already produces saltpeter without adding a single copper of extra cost."

"You know, Manila City Hall has faced the difficulty of insufficient public funds for years. Forced by helplessness, I can only hire those dumb natives; naturally, they don't understand profound mathematics," the Mayor sipped Australian water, put down the glass bottle, and said leisurely: "You can ask Mr. Andrade to recalculate."

"Munitions factory, of course; wood ash left in the smelting yard is endless. If it could produce wealth like it produces wood ash, that would be great."

"No, your statement is too absurd. No need for me to remind you of your status; as the municipal magistrate of the colony, you and I share the responsibility of guarding the territory for His Majesty our King. The importance of new artillery ammunition to us is self-evident because we have never had enough troops in the Philippines. If the damned Dutchmen want to target the Philippines, they can easily recruit a hundred thousand Chinese and Japanese. Now perhaps Australians must be added."

"Even looking from a money perspective, niter collection ponds can reduce part of our expenditure on purchasing saltpeter from India annually; you can't fail to understand the significance therein, right?"

"Poor Esteban, he would surely go mad hearing this edict of yours," Manila's Chief of Police cracked a joke responding to the Governor. This youngest son of a Milan country squire liked to tell vulgar jokes from time to time to mask his own sinister greedy face, "Fortunately, he can hear nothing now."

The conversation shifted direction here. Esteban Sanabria had far more enemies than friends in the Philippines, so his exciting duel with the Count was always talked about with relish. Even more dramatic was that five days after the duel, the Navy Commodore's fleet arrived in Manila. Coming on the same ship was a special person, a Special Prosecutor dispatched by the High Court of Madrid, ordered to investigate a series of fraudulent crimes committed by Esteban Sanabria in Seville, New Spain, and the Far East colonies. Of course, the suspect he was to investigate was silenced forever. The timing couldn't be more appropriate. As for the immense wealth the deceased once prided himself on, it obviously brought him no benefit; even whether someone could inherit it was unknown. From New Spain to Manila, scavenger vultures were everywhere, ready to pounce on this corpse for a full meal.

Even in the chatter and arguments of municipal officials, there were multiple variations of how the former colony's number one wealthy merchant and fraudster died. In the Mayor's mouth, Sanabria had half his head sliced off; the Royal Ensign gestured how the Count pierced Sanabria from front chest to back with one stab. The most exaggerated version came from Parian District Chief Juan Aguilar, who insisted poor Esteban Sanabria was split into two pieces, man and sword, by the Count.

"Now ears can get peace," a municipal councilor said, "No one will grab you chattering endlessly all day anymore, as if slandering others' reputation is his only joy in living."

"Who dares slander Count Vananois now? Someone already traced his lineage to the Lando family of Lombardy. Maybe his family tree branches will continue to grow in the future, crossing before the Common Era, all the way to ancient Rome."

"That's impossible; when have you ever heard that guy speak a sentence of Latin?" The Chief of Police retorted: "Speaking with a Tuscan rural accent, at most reciting a few doggerel poems by Dante or Petrarch. If this is all the noble education that man received, then his tutor must be an ignorant swindler. His Count airs are all propping up a facade to trick ignorant and simple-minded women. We really should investigate his background carefully."

Two knocks sounded outside the door. The door opened, revealing the slender, frail figure of Governor's Secretary Eugenio Garcia Zapatero, face appearing pale as if frightened by something, "Count Vananois has arrived; he is waiting in the small drawing room and decided to present a gift to Your Excellency first to show respect."

A Governor's Palace servant walked in holding the Count's gift. The Governor's Secretary subconsciously shrank back, as if what lay in the servant's hands was a poisonous snake wrapped in silk. Everyone quickly recognized it; nestled in silk was a scabbarded, ornately decorated saber—the Count often wore it attending various occasions.

"Heavens, isn't this the weapon that cruelly killed Esteban?" Mayor Osvaldo exclaimed. But no one bothered to echo him. Everyone cast aristocratic reserve and demeanor aside, stretching necks to view the saber famous due to the duel.

Actually, this was an authentic "Made in Lingao," a high-grade export item specially for export, a product slightly modified from the standard officer's saber of the Fubo Army—modeled after the Meiji Type 32 NCO sword. Gold and silver inlaid fittings and cloisonné decorated scabbard were indeed eye-catching, but when the blade was drawn from the scabbard, the Royal Ensign exclaimed loudly in admiration. He collected quite a few Oriental weapons, priding himself as an expert, and the steel quality of this blade was superb; the pattern on the blade body looked even more exquisite than the best Japanese katana and Arab scimitars. Spaniards naturally didn't know that was the effect of acid etching + mechanical polishing.
