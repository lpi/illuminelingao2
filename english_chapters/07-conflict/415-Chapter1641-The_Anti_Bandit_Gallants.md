# Chapter 1641 - The Anti-Bandit Gallants

Five men in Confucian scholar robes were in a standoff with Huang Binkun, each witheyes rounded and seemingly dripping with blood. The leader wanted to show he had a just cause and wasn't a bandit, so he pointed at Huang Binkun and declared loudly: "You dog traitor! You people bring chaos to Nanhai, slaughter the gentry, harm the common people, and resist the Royal Army—"

Huang Binkun didn't know who these people popping out of nowhere were, but there was no doubt they hated the hair-bandits and wanted to exterminate them quickly. He hurriedly said: "Brother, you are mistaken. This little brother isn't a traitor..."

"Pah! If you're not a traitor, who is? You received great grace from the Imperial Court, yet in Lingao you let the hair-bandits grow strong unchecked. Instead of thinking about the Sages' learning, you deeply studied Bandit Techniques. How can such a disloyal and unfilial person not be a traitor? Dying is a small matter, losing integrity is a big matter. Not being filial to the Court, dying to defend the country and share the Emperor's worries, how are you not a traitor? Today, we will eliminate harm for the Court above, and below..."

Before the word "below" could be finished, the leader got hit on the head by a clod of earth. With a cry of "Aiya," he immediately covered his face and squatted down. It turned out Huang Binkun, seeing the other party obviously took him for a hair-bandit and wanted to get rid of him quickly, acted first based on the principle that a wise man doesn't eat loss right in front of him.

As the clod left his hand, he charged fiercely towards a shorter man on the right, snatched the wooden club from his hand, pushed him away, and took to his heels.

The opponents were in Confucian robes and scarves, which were elegant to wear, but for chasing people and fighting, such long gowns could only hold one back. Counting one by one, none of the five could outrun Huang Binkun.

However, alack, Huang Binkun was also wearing a long gown since he went to visit the gentry. Running hurriedly, he didn't notice a stone underfoot. The long gown wrapped around his legs and tripped on the stone, resulting in an immediate dog-eating-shit fall. As he fell, his right shoulder hit the wall, and the club flew out of his hand. When he tried to crawl up again, the people behind had already caught up. The one in the lead swung at his head, shouting: "Hair-bandit, receive death!"

Having suppressed bandits for many years, Huang Binkun had very rich combat experience. Seeing he couldn't dodge, he hugged his head with both hands and took a blow directly on his back. This blow made Huang Binkun dizzy, but fortunately, it wasn't a vitals spot. He then picked up the wooden club he had just dropped and fought with the people who caught up. These men in Confucian robes weren't as frail as ordinary scholars; they had great strength and swung their clubs with vigor. Fortunately, they had no combat skills—Huang Binkun was clumsy in defense but managed to hold them off with difficulty.

However, fighting one against five without a handy weapon, he gradually fell into a disadvantage. Just as he was calculating how to escape, a shout suddenly came from afar: "Over there, hey, what are you doing over there?" The voice sounded like patrolling yamen runners. The people besieging Huang Binkun saw it was bad, turned, and drilled into the alley, disappearing quickly. Only the one grappling with Huang Binkun had his shirt firmly grabbed and couldn't break free in time. The yamen runners rushed over noisily and seized both of them.

The two were held by the arms by two runners respectively, unable to move. Huang Binkun got up only to feel something flowing on his face. He wiped it with his hand and found it was covered in blood, which greatly terrified him. Fortunately, wiping again, he realized the scalp was scraped during the fall earlier, nothing serious. Only then did he feel relieved. The scholar in the long gown, arms held, kept cursing incessantly: "Hair-bandit, ruining Ming's teachings and human hearts! Hair-bandit, what crime did my parents commit that you hanged them!? Hair-bandit, licentious and shameless, what crime did my sister commit!? Dragged away to be a slave! Hair-bandit! Greedy and forgetting righteousness, even taking away my family's ox—" Hearing him cursing hair-bandits loudly, the runner hurriedly shouted: "What nonsense are you talking about! If you're drunk, go sober up first!"

Because both were dressed as scholars, the night patrol runners didn't know their backgrounds at first. Fearing they were *xiucai* or *juren* with titles causing trouble while drunk, they dared not use rough force, just restraining them from causing trouble.

However, the other party didn't care at all, struggling and kicking continuously: "Hair-bandit! You violate heaven's laws and collude with the government. How much silver did you give Xiong Wencan...", only to hear two slaps, *pa pa*. A runner, afraid he would spout nonsense and bring out something "unresponsive," directly gave that scholar two slaps on the mouth. With their family-inherited skills, the strikes were ruthless and vicious. The scholar's mouth immediately bled, and he couldn't speak. The leading runner, hearing his words, knew this person probably had some connection with "Australians," untriflable people. He hurriedly smiled apologetically and bowed to Huang Binkun: "Sir, you were startled. Are you alright?"

"No problem. You gentlemen have worked hard." Huang Binkun took out a visiting card. The runner's eyes flashed: *This is the Liang Residence's card!* He hurriedly smiled apologetically, "If you are fine, please go back first. This madman, we brothers will help him sober up first. To avoid him blathering..."

Huang Binkun felt not a trace of surprise at this sudden street attack, let alone being frightened. Ever since organizing scholars to spy on military intelligence, Huang Binkun had been ready at all times for a group of vicious hair-bandits to appear suddenly and fire those short-handled small fireguns at him. Today's scene, however, left him between laughter and tears. seeing the runners grabbing the near-mad scholar and pressing him down, his headscarf falling off, hair messy like a refugee, only hearing his hoarse shouting but unable to make out what he was cursing.

He smiled bitterly. Just as the runners were preparing to take the scholar back to the county yamen, the scholar got strength from somewhere, struggling to lunge at Huang Binkun. Fortunately, the runners had already tied him up and pulled him back immediately. However, just then, a mouthful of phlegm mixed with blood was spat from the scholar's mouth, flying straight onto Huang Binkun's face. Huang Binkun hurriedly used his sleeve to wipe it off, finding his sleeve full of fresh blood, mixed with phlegm and blood, and there was also a tooth just knocked out.

Huang Binkun didn't get up until noon the next day. Although he didn't suffer any major injuries yesterday—the page boy went out to find a doctor to apply some cuttlefish bone powder, and the bleeding on his forehead stopped—he still had some bruises on his body. Thinking he might as well recuperate for a few days before making plans, visitors came in an endless stream. It turned out the page boy had reported his attack to Scholar Lin early in the morning. The Yuyuan Society members came to visit one after another. Those who didn't come themselves sent page boys to deliver food and medicine.

Huang Binkun had never been such a center of attention in his life and had to get up to socialize. After a day, he ended up with a sore back and dry mouth. Finally sending off the last batch of guests, he could sit down to rest.

The page boy brewed a decoction for promoting blood circulation and removing stasis for him. He drank a few mouthfuls, feeling sore all over. He had been running around these days, visiting quite a few people and making friends with scholars in the County School. Calculating, he had delayed in Guangzhou City for over a month. He hadn't had the leisure to read some of the hair-bandits' miscellaneous books. Relaxing now, Huang Binkun's mind became clearer instead.

Thinking back to his various actions in Lingao, it couldn't be said he didn't exhaust his energy and thoughts, yet the hair-bandits neutralized them without much action. The so-called "jumping clown" was probably just like this.

Having finally arrived in Guangzhou, these days not only failed to give him the feeling that "the sky in the liberated area is a bright sky," but instead gave him deep disappointment and doubt. The filth and chaos here, the poverty of the common people... seemed to be contrasting everything for him to see. While the hair-bandits did whatever they wanted inside and outside the city, the government not only did nothing but many profit-seeking villains flattered the hair-bandits in every way. Even the students in the County School had no integrity.

It was funny to say, his success in everything in Guangzhou was also because everyone thought he was deeply versed in "Banditology." Huang Binkun pinched the tooth in his hand. After being spat on his face yesterday, he had carefully kept it. The ones in Guangzhou who shared his aspirations were probably only these few unknown scholars.

*Yes, I should talk to him!*

Huang Binkun called the page boy and told him to go to the Nanhai County Yamen to inquire about the person caught by the runners yesterday. The page boy returned not long after.

"That scholar died yesterday," the page boy said.

"What?!" Huang Binkun was greatly shocked, "Just one night, and he died?"

"Yes," the page boy said, "I heard the people inside say the night patrol locked him in the detention room last night. Checking early this morning, he had already hanged himself!"

Huang Binkun's palm hurt, seeming to be pricked by the tooth. He hurriedly threw the tooth out. He asked again:

"Was it really suicide?"

"The head jailer said it was indeed suicide, and added that it wasn't his first time being caught..."

"What happened? Tell me in detail."

"Yes." The page boy said this scholar was originally a son of a grain-tax household in the countryside of Dongguan County, named Lei Lunfu. A few years ago when hair-bandits' troops passed through, his family organized local militia to resist the hair-bandits, resulting in the whole family being wiped out. Only a younger sister was said to have been abducted to Lingao. He himself was studying in the county seat and escaped disaster because Dongguan paid the city redemption fee.

"No wonder he hated the hair-bandits so much." Huang Binkun nodded secretly.

"Since then, he became somewhat mad." The page boy continued, "Spending all day distributing leaflets in Guangzhou City, and suing at the yamen several times. Seeing the government ignored him, he went to make trouble at the Purple Treasure Studio. Being driven out by the armed escort agency wasn't enough; Manager Guo probably used some means to strip him of his *xiucai* title and had the Nanhai County Yamen arrest him and lock him up for half a month, making him suffer quite a bit in jail."

"And then?"

"And then he went against the Australians even more—" The page boy said this person gathered a group of people with similar fates as him and went to make trouble at the Purple Treasure Studio again. He was just arrested by Nanhai County a few days ago, beaten with dozens of strokes, and just released.

So that was it. Huang Binkun felt deep respect. *This is actually a righteous man! Just don't know who the other few people were. If I can contact them, my Anti-Bandit Great Enterprise will more or less have helpers.*

"Go to the yamen and inquire who the ones with this person were roughly, their surnames and names, and where they live."

The page boy laughed: "Master Huang, why take this trouble? Just give the head jailer in the yamen a few taels of silver, and Young Master can deal with them however you want."
