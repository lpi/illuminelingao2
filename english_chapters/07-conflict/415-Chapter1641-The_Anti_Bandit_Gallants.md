# Chapter 1641 - The Anti-Bandit Gallants

Five men in Confucian scholars' robes squared off against Huang Binkun, their eyes rounded and seemingly dripping with blood. The leader, wishing to show his cause was just and that he was no mere bandit, pointed at Huang Binkun and declared loudly: "You traitorous dog! You people bring chaos to Nanhai, slaughter the gentry, harm the common people, and resist the Royal Army—"

Huang Binkun had no idea who these men emerging from nowhere were, but there was no doubt they despised the Hair-bandits and wished to exterminate them at once. He hastened to say: "Brother, you are mistaken. This humble one is no traitor..."

"Pah! If you're not a traitor, who is? You received great grace from the Imperial Court, yet in Lingao you let the Hair-bandits grow strong unchecked. Instead of devoting yourself to the Sages' learning, you delved deep into Bandit Techniques. How can such a disloyal and unfilial wretch not be a traitor? Dying is a small matter; losing integrity is a great one. Not being filial to the Court, failing to die defending the country and sharing the Emperor's burdens—how are you not a traitor? Today, we shall eliminate this threat for the Court above, and below—"

Before the word "below" could leave his lips, the leader took a clod of earth to the head. With a cry of "Aiya!" he immediately covered his face and crouched down.

It turned out Huang Binkun, perceiving that the other party clearly mistook him for a Hair-bandit and meant to dispatch him quickly, had acted first on the principle that a wise man does not eat loss right before his face.

As the clod left his hand, he charged fiercely toward a shorter man on the right, snatched the wooden club from his grip, shoved him aside, and took to his heels.

His opponents wore Confucian robes and scarves—elegant attire, to be sure, but for chasing people and fighting, long gowns only slowed one down. Counting them one by one, none of the five could outrun Huang Binkun.

However, alas—Huang Binkun himself also wore a long gown, having dressed for visiting gentry. Running in haste, he failed to notice a stone underfoot. The long gown tangled around his legs and caught on the stone, sending him sprawling face-first. As he fell, his right shoulder struck the wall, and the club flew from his hand. When he tried to scramble upright, his pursuers had already caught up. The one in the lead swung at his head, shouting: "Hair-bandit, receive your death!"

Having suppressed bandits for many years, Huang Binkun possessed rich combat experience. Seeing he could not dodge, he hugged his head with both arms and took the blow directly on his back. The impact left him dizzy, but fortunately, it had not struck a vital spot. He then snatched up the wooden club he had just dropped and fought against the men who had caught up.

These men in Confucian robes were not as frail as ordinary scholars—they possessed considerable strength and swung their clubs with vigor. Fortunately, they had no combat skills. Huang Binkun defended clumsily, but managed to hold them off with difficulty.

However, fighting one against five without a proper weapon, he gradually fell into disadvantage. Just as he was calculating how to escape, a shout suddenly rang out from afar: "Over there! Hey, what are you doing over there?" The voice sounded like patrolling yamen runners.

The men besieging Huang Binkun realized the situation had turned against them. They spun around and dove into the alley, vanishing swiftly. Only the one grappling directly with Huang Binkun had his shirt firmly gripped and could not break free in time. The yamen runners rushed over noisily and seized both of them.

The two were held by the arms by two runners apiece, unable to move. Huang Binkun rose only to feel something flowing down his face. He wiped it with his hand and found it covered in blood—which gave him a great fright. Fortunately, wiping again, he realized his scalp had been scraped during the earlier fall. Nothing serious. Only then did he feel relieved.

The scholar in the long gown, arms restrained, cursed incessantly: "Hair-bandit, corrupting the Ming's teachings and people's hearts! Hair-bandit, what crime did my parents commit that you hanged them?! Hair-bandit, licentious and shameless—what crime did my sister commit?! Dragged away to be a slave! Hair-bandit! Greedy and forgetting righteousness, even seizing my family's ox—"

Hearing him curse the Hair-bandits so loudly, a runner hastily shouted: "What nonsense are you spouting! If you're drunk, go sober up first!"

Because both were dressed as scholars, the night patrol runners could not immediately determine their backgrounds. Fearing they might be *xiucai* or *juren* with titles causing drunken trouble, they dared not use rough force—merely restraining them from creating further disturbance.

Yet the other party showed no concern whatsoever, struggling and kicking continuously: "Hair-bandit! You violate heaven's laws and collude with the government. How much silver did you give Xiong Wencan—"

Two slaps, *pa pa*. A runner, afraid the man would spout nonsense and blurt out something "unanswerable," directly dealt the scholar two slaps across the mouth. With their family-inherited technique, the strikes were ruthless and vicious. The scholar's mouth immediately bled, rendering him unable to speak.

The leading runner, hearing his words, recognized this person probably had some connection with "Australians"—people who could not be trifled with. He hastened to smile apologetically and bowed to Huang Binkun: "Sir, you were startled. Are you all right?"

"No problem. You gentlemen have worked hard." Huang Binkun produced a visiting card. The runner's eyes flashed: *This is the Liang Residence's card!* He hastened to smile even more obsequiously. "If you are fine, please return first. This madman—we brothers will help him sober up. To prevent further blathering..."

Huang Binkun felt not a trace of surprise at this sudden street attack—nor was he frightened. Ever since organizing scholars to spy on military intelligence, Huang Binkun had been prepared at all times for a group of vicious Hair-bandits to appear suddenly and fire those short-handled small pistols at him.

Today's scene, however, left him caught between laughter and tears. Watching the runners seize the near-mad scholar and press him down—his headscarf fallen off, hair disheveled like a refugee—he could only hear hoarse shouting, unable to make out the words being cursed.

He smiled bitterly. Just as the runners were preparing to take the scholar back to the county yamen, the scholar summoned strength from somewhere and lunged toward Huang Binkun. Fortunately, the runners had already bound him and pulled him back immediately. However, in that instant, a mouthful of phlegm mixed with blood shot from the scholar's mouth, flying straight onto Huang Binkun's face.

Huang Binkun hurriedly used his sleeve to wipe it off, finding his sleeve soaked with fresh blood mixed with phlegm—and there was also a tooth just knocked loose.

Huang Binkun did not rise until noon the following day. Though he had suffered no major injuries—the pageboy had gone out to find a doctor who applied some cuttlefish bone powder, and the bleeding on his forehead had stopped—bruises covered his body. Thinking he might as well recuperate for a few days before making further plans, visitors arrived in an endless stream.

It turned out the pageboy had reported his attack to Scholar Lin early that morning. Yuyuan Society members came to visit one after another. Those who did not come personally sent pageboys to deliver food and medicine.

Huang Binkun had never been such a center of attention in his life and was obliged to rise and socialize. By day's end, his back ached and his mouth was parched. Finally sending off the last batch of guests, he could sit down to rest.

The pageboy brewed a decoction for promoting blood circulation and removing stasis. He drank a few mouthfuls, feeling soreness throughout his body. He had been running about these past days, visiting quite a few people and befriending scholars in the County School. Calculating, he had lingered in Guangzhou City for over a month. He had not had the leisure to read some of the Hair-bandits' miscellany publications. Relaxing now, Huang Binkun's mind grew clearer instead.

Reflecting on his various schemes in Lingao, it could not be said he had not exhausted his energy and ingenuity—yet the Hair-bandits had neutralized them without much apparent effort. The so-called "jumping clown" was probably just like this.

Having finally arrived in Guangzhou, these days had failed to give him the feeling that "the sky in the liberated area is a bright sky." Instead, they had brought deep disappointment and doubt. The filth and chaos here, the poverty of the common people... seemed to contrast everything for him to see. While the Hair-bandits did whatever they pleased inside and outside the city, the government not only did nothing—many profit-seeking villains curried favor with the Hair-bandits in every way. Even the students in the County School had no integrity.

It was laughable to admit—his success in everything in Guangzhou was also because everyone believed him deeply versed in "Banditology."

Huang Binkun pinched the tooth in his hand. After being spat upon yesterday, he had carefully kept it. Those in Guangzhou who shared his convictions were probably only these few obscure scholars.

*Yes, I should talk to him!*

Huang Binkun called the pageboy and instructed him to go to the Nanhai County Yamen to inquire about the person caught by the runners yesterday. The pageboy returned not long after.

"That scholar died yesterday," the pageboy said.

"What?!" Huang Binkun was deeply shocked. "Just one night, and he's dead?"

"Yes," the pageboy said. "I heard the people inside say the night patrol locked him in the detention room last night. When they checked this morning, he had already hanged himself!"

Huang Binkun's palm stung—as if pricked by the tooth. He hurriedly threw it aside. Then he asked again: "Was it truly suicide?"

"The head jailer said it was indeed suicide. And added that it wasn't his first time being caught..."

"What happened? Tell me the details."

"Yes." The pageboy explained that this scholar was originally the son of a grain-tax household in the Dongguan countryside, named Lei Lunfu. Years ago, when Hair-bandit troops passed through, his family organized local militia to resist the Hair-bandits, resulting in the entire family being wiped out. Only a younger sister was said to have been abducted to Lingao. He himself had been studying in the county seat and escaped disaster because Dongguan paid the city redemption fee.

"No wonder he hated the Hair-bandits so deeply," Huang Binkun nodded silently.

"Since then, he became somewhat deranged," the pageboy continued. "He spent every day distributing leaflets in Guangzhou City and filed lawsuits at the yamen several times. Seeing the government ignored him, he went to cause trouble at the Purple Treasure Studio. Being driven out by the armed escort agency wasn't enough—Manager Guo probably employed some means to have him stripped of his *xiucai* title and had the Nanhai County Yamen arrest him and imprison him for half a month, making him suffer considerably in jail."

"And then?"

"Then he opposed the Australians even more intensely—" The pageboy recounted that this man gathered a group of people who had suffered similar fates and went to cause trouble at the Purple Treasure Studio again. He had just been arrested by Nanhai County a few days prior, beaten with dozens of strokes, and only recently released.

So that was the story. Huang Binkun felt deep respect. *This is actually a righteous man! I wonder who the others were. If I can contact them, my Anti-Bandit Great Enterprise will finally have some helpers.*

"Go to the yamen and inquire who the associates of this person were—roughly their surnames and names, and where they reside."

The pageboy laughed. "Master Huang, why go to such trouble? Just give the head jailer at the yamen a few taels of silver, and Young Master can deal with them however you please."
