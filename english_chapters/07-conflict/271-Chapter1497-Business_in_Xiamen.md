# Chapter 1497 - Business in Xiamen

The cargo had originally been loaded well. Chen Huamin was just about to order the sea sacrifice and departure when suddenly a line of porters rushed onto the pier, all pushing Gale-style two-wheeled handcarts sold here from Lingao, piled high with many straw sacks. They were coming towards *Dongshanju*'s berth.

"What is this?" Chen Huamin was wondering—goods *Dongshanju* was to carry were all fully loaded without omission; supplies like food and water were also loaded—when he saw Liu Deshan at the end of the line, following breathlessly.

Porters arrived beside the ship; Liu Deshan stepped ahead boarding the ship first, disregarding greetings, instructing sailors to open cargo hold covers, ready to load.

"Cousin! What is this?" Chen Huamin couldn't make heads or tails of it, "Aren't our goods already fully loaded?"

"Stack them well, stack well." Liu Deshan gestured directing porters to load while saying, "This is salt, goods I just procured."

"Salt? Whom are you selling to? We are going to the Nan Zhili area; without salt license, how can the government allow import..."

"Hehe, who said selling to the government." Liu Deshan took out a towel from his pocket, wiping sweat, "This is shipped to Xiamen! That is Zheng family territory; what salt license is needed? I got news that salt prices over in Fujian are very high. We ship these salts there, dare not say much, but expenses for this round trip can all be earned back."

"Cousin, is this matter a bit improper?" Chen Huamin knew Fujian was always a salt import area, but his family bought the Australian navigation flag. Just running to Australians' enemy territory to sell salt like this—leave aside what Australians would think, could the Zheng family tolerate it?

"Rest assured, I have inquired properly. Families in Weitou Bay all said, regardless of whose ship, as long as goods can be transported there, ship and goods safety is guaranteed without exception, fair trade—no need to buy command flags. Heard that not only are salt and grain prices very high there, but also quite a lot of foreign goods accumulated for export, prices also very low. We transport to Guangzhou to sell to Master Qin, just right to earn a ticket!"

"This..." Although Chen Huamin felt his cousin's business sense was good, he still felt somewhat improper. But momentarily couldn't think of any reason to refute—cargo on the ship wasn't fully full; running a trip meant a trip's expense, naturally loading more goods was better.

"Since it's so, let's prepare to sail."

Just speaking, a big fellow with solid dark muscles all over, wearing a Han sword and a wooden tag written "Deputy Captain" at waist, and a face of thick beard walked up, cupping fists to Chen Huamin: "Captain, the auspicious hour has arrived!"

Chen Huamin grumbled in a low voice: "Little Wang ah! Said how many times, now call me Ship Captain!" Then seriously straightened his hat and long gown, picked up three sticks of incense from the altar table, lit them, and bowed respectfully three times, chanting silently: "Please Lord Mazu bless us sea-plowing people to go out to sea smoothly, without disaster or pain, return home safely! Chen Huamin, Liu Deshan and all crew staff present with respect!" After offering incense, Chen Huamin arranged fruits on the altar table, cut a piece from the roast pig with a small knife to place before the altar, finally filling three small porcelain cups of wine.

Chen took the first cup of wine, raised hand to sprinkle toward the sky, saying loudly: "Respect Heaven! Weigh anchor!"

Deputy Captain Wang beside him repeated loudly: "Yes, weigh anchor!" The Anchor Master standing by the hawsehole shouted toward the capstan: "Weigh—anchor—!"

Anchor hands immediately turned the capstan forcefully, bringing the iron anchor to water surface, simultaneously shouting chanties loudly: "Weigh anchor lo—goods—turn—like—wheels—! Gold—ten—thousand—taels—!"

Chen Huamin took the second cup of wine, waved hand to sprinkle toward the sea, saying loudly: "Respect Sea, cast off!"

"Yes, cast off!" Cable Master followed shouting, "Cast—off—!"

Cable workers untied cables tied on shore while responding with chanties: "Cast off lo—, smooth—smooth—prosper—prosper—! All—way—peace—safe!"

Took the third cup of wine, sprinkled on bow deck, "Respect God, hoist sail!"

"Yes, hoist sail!" Sail Master shouted down to the mast, "Hoist—sail—!"

Sailors quickly pulled halyards, raising cloth sails on three masts, and echoed: "Hoist sail lo—, one—sail—wind—smooth—! Sea—no—raise—waves—!"

Chen Huamin saw sails reached top, sea breeze filling three cloth sails, took a deep breath, waved hand toward open sea outside port, "New course—!"

*Dongshanju* exited Pearl River Estuary, crossed Humen, passed Lingdingyang, turned due east at Tonggu Banks, entered Tuen Mun, circled Ma Wan entering Hong Kong Channel.

Just a few years ago, Hong Kong was still a desolate place rarely known, with only some sparsely distributed small fishing villages. Except inland river boats coming to purchase incense wood in fixed seasons, only some sea ships passed occasionally.

Later when Imperial Navy was cut, several nearby islands became water forts of water "heroes," merchant ships passed even more rarely. Everyone preferred detouring a longer way, passing through Hong Kong Outer Channel.

But now, the entire penny's Bay channel was extremely lively. Australians regulated inland and open sea channels from Hong Kong Island to Guangzhou, exterminated water bandits, set up navigation lights, built lighthouses, marked hidden reefs and shoals one by one, greatly increasing navigation safety.

Most here were ships under Australians. These ships, whether small boats or big ships, were much faster than *Dongshanju*, sailing also very agilely. From time to time ships either quickly overtook *Dongshanju* sailing east, or rushed head-on toward *Dongshanju*, passing by edge only at the last moment, leaving a burst of good-natured light laughter.

Clumsy local ships: Guangzhou ships, Fujian ships also appeared among them. Australian own fleet capacity was severely insufficient; many freight businesses were contracted to shipowners to do. These ships sailed slowly, so much that *Dongshanju* had to avoid their wakes again.

Such complex navigation conditions forced Deputy Captain Wang Chengti to guard at the bow, watching situations at all times to issue commands to helmsman and sternsman at the stern, bypassing ships passing at any time.

On both banks of the harbor were moored various warships and merchant ships; many wharves, warehouses, boat sheds, and cranes were newly built. Occasionally one or two Australian-style large stone houses, large stone buildings appeared, looking particularly conspicuous. Most conspicuous among them was a large fortress near Central Pier, standing towering; Australian flags fluttered on corner towers. Chen Huamin had gone there to handle navigation procedures, having deep impression of this fortress.

"Look, that is the place where *Dongshanju* was built!" Following Chen Huamin's hand, Liu Deshan saw beside the beach to the east of Hong Kong Island actually became a huge shipbuilding yard. Wooden ships with varying degrees of completion lined up one after another; densely packed workers lay on ship hulls, striving to complete their works.

"When I first saw this ship here back then, I immediately liked her; felt whether smooth appearance or sturdy body and head all fit my wish perfectly, simply like built specially for me; such a her definitely is my ship. Although she only had a hull then, not even masts were settled!" Chen Huamin slowly recalled while gently stroking the wooden handrail of the gunwale.

"What's funny is, at the time because this ship type changed too differently from traditional Guangzhou ships, Fujian ships, no merchant dared verify buying this ship, causing her to stop work on the slipway for half a year. When I saw this ship and immediately decided to buy, I didn't bring enough silver on me, sigh!"

"I remember, that time as soon as you returned you wanted me to give you four-fifths of silver in the storehouse. Scared me thinking something big happened, that was nearly our one year's profit!"

"'To do a good job, an artisan must first sharpen his tools'! Besides now using new ship, running two more trips earns it back." Chen Huamin smiled, turning serious: "Moveover many great sea merchants operate several sea ships; profit obtained not as good as one foreigner sea ship running one trip. People's foreign ships carry large cargo volume, have large cannons to guard ship, fast speed and can enter/exit ocean. Therefore foreigner ships are made bigger and bigger; conversely we fell behind, need to learn making ships from foreigners. Heard Australians build ships even more terrible than foreigners, actually able to use iron to make ship ribs. Brother I can't figure out no matter what, this iron making ship ribs, ship adds quite a lot of weight for no reason, how can it sail fast?"

"Fortunately now seems this shipyard business is quite good, more and more merchants understand importance of good ships." Liu Deshan said, "Speaking of iron ribs, heard only their warships use iron ribs. But last time I sailed past shipyard, saw patrol ships they built, all used iron ribs, yet sailed agilely and fast, truly incredible!"

"It is said Australian merchant ships also use iron ribs." Chen Huamin pointed to a huge T800 hull on the beachhead, "Pity this ship is too big, port transshipment has many inconveniences. Otherwise brother also wants to taste something new."

"Hehe, Cousin you truly love the new and loathe the old. *Dongshanju* in hand only a few days, then fancying new ship again."

"We doing business on sea, ship is money-making tool, naturally must prepare a few good ships. I heard Westerners say before, carefully built big ships as long as maintained properly, using a hundred years is no problem. Here with us, instead like building disposable firewood ships."

"Cousin aren't you speaking with bookish tone? Your family is also sea merchant, don't know maintaining this ship has expenses every day. Calculating it's really not as good as building a new one per voyage."

"This is old business principle," Chen Huamin was full of zest, "I feel future sea business won't be done like our fathers and grandfathers. Ships changed, rules on sea also start changing, business principles naturally also must change."

Between the two chatting, *Dongshanju* already briskly passed Hong Kong Channel, turning northeast continuing to sail.

Exiting Lei Yue Mun, crossing Ninepin Group, passing Mirs Bay, turning East-Northeast, sailing straight to Xiamen.
