# Chapter 1299 Gentle Hometown

Several transport ships of Great Wave Shipping were anchored in Foshou Bay. These transport ships arrived according to a certain schedule, with an interval of about ten days each time. The refugee formation was also arranged roughly according to this cycle.

The number of ships coming from Jeju was uncertain, but at least three thousand people could be transported away each time—in fact, the number of refugees stranded here was rarely lower than this figure. In addition to the continuous stream of refugee formations sent from the Cloud Ascending Temple side, there were also many desperate refugees who came here spontaneously. The news that there were ships picking up refugees at Foshou Bay had spread like wildfire in the local area. Although they didn't know where they would be transported to after boarding the ship, nor did they know what the future held, imminent death still forced the refugees onto this road—just seeking to survive: since there were ships coming to pick them up, they weren't going to kill them at sea to feed the fish, right?

When Wang Ruixiang arrived at Foshou Bay, thousands of refugees were typically sleeping in the open outside the refugee camp. These people had no shelter or food, relying only on the small amount of relief ration gruel distributed daily by the Foshou Bay garrison to survive. Every night that passed, hundreds of people would die. However, new refugees arrived every day to replenish the numbers, so there were always quite a few people gathered outside the refugee camp.

Wang Ruixiang dismounted, took out a handkerchief, and wiped the clear snot running from under his nose. He watched the refugees collecting corpses under the command of the camp garrison—the corpses of refugees who froze or starved to death at night had to be encoffined as soon as it was light. The corpses, frozen stiff and covered with icicles, were piled like timber on rough sledges one by one, dragged to the seaside, loaded onto small boats, and then thrown into the sea.

Those doing this work were all half-dead refugees sleeping in the open outside—for no other reason than that working for the transit station meant getting an extra share of relief gruel.

To survive in this timeline, one's heart had to be hard. Wang Ruixiang listened to the crunching sound of his boots stepping on the ice and snow, walking through the refugees with a gloomy face. The refugees gathered outside the refugee camp had automatically made way for a wide path—those still lying across the road were either dead or about to die.

The gate of the refugee camp had opened. Huang Xiong, the person in charge of the Foshou Bay Transit Station, was standing straight in front of the gate. He was wearing the winter uniform only available to the Northbound Detachment, with a white sheepskin vest worn nondescriptly over his gray woolen overcoat.

"Rep-Report: Foshou Bay Dispatch Detachment Leader, Infantry Lieutenant Huang Xiong reporting to you! The detachment should have fifty-five people, actual arrivals thirty people, awaiting your instructions!"

His voice was a bit hurried, appearing not to have expected Wang Ruixiang to arrive in person.

"At ease." Wang Ruixiang's gaze lingered on this officer's face for a moment, seeing that he indeed looked uneasy. It seemed the tip-off from the Committee of Ten was true.

"Dismiss the troops! Take me to your headquarters!"

"Yes, yes..."

Huang Xiong's headquarters was located in the beacon tower. The beacon tower at Foshou Bay was just a signal tower. The entire tower body was built of rammed earth, not covered with bricks on the outside, and suffering from perennial lack of maintenance, much of it had collapsed. Surrounding the beacon tower was a wall four meters high and over a hundred meters long, and outside the wall was another moat.

Entering the wall of the beacon tower, a row of housing for beacon tower guards was built on the left side. There was a water well next to the housing—but the water source had long since become saline and undrinkable. Drinking water had to be carried from a nearby small river. In winter, having ice and snow to melt into water was slightly more convenient.

On the right side of the wall were buildings such as stables and warehouses for the beacon tower guards, used to stack various necessary military supplies within the beacon tower. Although these houses were in disrepair for years, with broken windows, rotten doors, and leaking roofs, they were much better than the shacks outside. Therefore, these houses were used as barracks and command posts for the dispatch detachment after slight repairs.

Wang Ruixiang walked in. It was swept clean inside, without a trace of ice or snow residue. Garbage was categorized, and firewood was stacked neatly.

Huang Xiong's dormitory-cum-command post was set up in the best room among them. This kind of house had two rooms, front and back. The outside was originally a kitchen-cum-main hall, and the back was a bedroom with a heated kang connected through the front and back walls. After Huang Xiong moved in, he changed the outer room into a command post, and the inside was his bedroom.

As soon as Wang Ruixiang walked in, he smelled a scent of rouge and powder. Seeing Huang Xiong's apprehensive appearance, he knew that what was said in the whistleblowing material was not false. But he was not in a hurry to expose it. He calmly looked at the documents, maps, and stationery on the table, and then looked at the rifle he hung on the wall. He noticed that the door curtain leading to the bedroom was new, and the room was excessively tidy.

"Captain Huang," Wang Ruixiang sat down, "Your little life is going quite well."

Huang Xiong was already feeling anxious. Provoked by Wang Ruixiang's words, he immediately shuddered and hurriedly stood at attention: "Report to the Chief, compared to other detachments, the conditions here are indeed relatively superior..."

"Bullshit!" Wang Ruixiang interrupted him, "There is the smell of a woman in this room!" He pointed to the door curtain, "Everyone is crawling on ice and lying in snow, rushing about to rescue more refugees. You, on the other hand, have hidden a beauty in a golden house for yourself first!"

Huang Xiong felt cold all over: he was indeed hiding a beauty in a golden house. Ever since they set up the transit station at Foshou Bay, in addition to refugees sent from Yizhou, refugees from all over arrived in an endless stream. Out of the purpose of enabling more refugees to survive, Daoist Priest Zhang and Wang Ruixiang allowed the dispatch detachment to use a certain amount of relief rations daily to relieve refugees, giving them some possibility of survival more or less. However, these refugees belonged to "off the books". How many came, how many died, and how many were lost—there was no evidence to check. The civil affairs department only recorded the number of "extra refugees" who could finally board the ship.

To survive, refugees were willing to do anything. For women who already had nothing, selling their bodies became the only means of livelihood. Thus, women used their bodies to seduce the soldiers of the dispatch detachment.

Although these women were disheveled and haggard, it was not a problem for soldiers who had served for a long time and saw even an old sow as double-eyelided, let alone that among them were quite a few daughters and wives of middle-class or even rich families who usually lived in comfort. Although they suffered from the poisoning of natural and man-made disasters, they still retained some charm after all.

Being on duty outside for a long time inevitably led to slackness in records. Some bold soldiers began to act. At first, it was just exchanging a bowl of gruel for a woman's one-night stand. Gradually, the soldiers developed feelings for some of the women. They also needed someone to help with sewing, mending, washing, and scrubbing, so they quietly started living together as temporary couples in pairs.

Huang Xiong was quickly drawn in. However, as an officer, he disdained promiscuously messing with refugee women. He spent some time picking a sixteen-year-old girl who was both talented and beautiful, and came from a scholarly family, counting as his "wife".

With the officer taking the lead, what was originally sneaky became open and aboveboard. By now, not only had most soldiers in the detachment gotten "temporary wives", some soldiers even kept women by their side as temporary couples while continuing to mess around with other women outside—as long as a bowl of gruel was given, as many women would lie down as wanted.

"Truly corrupt military discipline!" Wang Ruixiang reprimanded bitterly, "Are you still fit to be soldiers of the Senate! Women, women, can't you live without that hole?!"

Huang Xiong's face flushed red. He knew that the Senate's attitude towards soldiers was quite different from the Great Ming: the soldiers of the Imperial Army not only had good treatment but also high status. They received preferential treatment wherever they went. Moreover, no one was allowed to insult soldiers, and even committing adultery with a soldier's wife was a crime.

But in Lingao, there were more men than women, and soldiers had almost no opportunity to contact the public. Not to mention ordinary big-headed soldiers, even someone like Huang Xiong who had served for several years and been promoted to officer couldn't find a wife—soldiering had never been a profession that attracted women.

Now seeing boatload after boatload of women being transported away from under his nose, and women coming so easily, the long-suppressed desires naturally burst forth.

Wang Ruixiang continued to reprimand: "...Do you still have a shred of human conscience! How many refugees outside are starving to death, yet you are using relief rations to play with women!"

Huang Xiong dared not reply—Senator Wang's rage was imaginable: the Senate regarded military discipline as life, and among them, the most taboo was soldiers messing with women while performing tasks—visiting prostitutes during leave was free—as long as they went to yellow-licensed prostitutes. But once entering duty status, simply not even the word "woman" was allowed to be mentioned.

Thinking of the clause in "Discipline in Battle" about the death penalty for raping women, the back of Huang Xiong's neck felt cold. He knew a thing or two about this Chief Wang: rumor had it among naturalized citizens that he liked to use an axe, and had chopped off countless heads when fighting at the hands of the various great chieftains in the beginning.

If this Chief let out a sentence: "Drag him out and shoot him." He would immediately become one of the corpses put into a small boat and thrown into the sea.

However, at this moment, he didn't know how to explain himself: the Chief clearly came prepared. He couldn't make any sense arguing, and kneeling and begging for mercy was not popular in the Imperial Army. He could only stand without speaking.

Wang Ruixiang saw him dumbfounded, flushing red and unable to speak. He walked a few steps and lifted the door curtain of the inner room. The supplies inside made it burn warmly. The room was tidied up cleanly, and several sets of change of clothes were folded neatly and placed at the head of the kang. There was also a standard shirt being mended on the kang.

Wang Ruixiang snorted coldly and asked: "Where is the person?"

"Report, report to the Chief, all... all hidden in the refugee camp... inside..."

"Knew I was coming, right?"

"Yes, yes," Huang Xiong suddenly shuddered. Wasn't this intentionally deceiving the Chief? He quickly added, "No, no, no..."

Wang Ruixiang waved his hand and walked out again.

Huang Xiong trembled and lost color, saying: "I have been obsessed these days, didn't restrain the team well, and also took the lead in violating discipline myself. Please punish me severely, Chief: even if I am dragged out and shot immediately, I have nothing to say."
