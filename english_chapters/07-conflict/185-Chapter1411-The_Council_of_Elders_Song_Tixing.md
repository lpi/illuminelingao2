# Chapter 1411 - The Council of Elders' Song Tixing

Wearing her old jeans and blue tracksuit, now so worn they were barely presentable, both brought from the old time-space, with a pair of fake Qiangren 3515 combat boots slung over her shoulder by their laces tied together, the barefoot Su Wan wearily removed the tattered straw hat from her head, tossed it casually into the sea, and shuffled down the gangway.

The "Spanish Whore" might be convenient, but the ship was just too small. It had tossed Su Wan about so badly that she had been seasick the entire voyage, spending the whole journey lying on her bunk moaning.

"Greetings, Chief! I am a staff member of the Kaohsiung Municipal Hospitality Office. Welcome, Chief, to our location for guidance and inspection!"

A young man in neat attire, his voice booming, loudly introduced himself and saluted—welcoming and seeing off every Chief who passed through Kaohsiung was one of his duties.

For the young naturalized-civilian worker, he had already seen quite a few Chiefs—including female Elders—so his sense of novelty about Elders had long since worn off. But Su Wan's appearance still gave him a start.

This female Chief is terrifyingly tall! He thought in secret alarm. There are women this tall in the world!

Su Wan was 180 centimeters tall—a height rare even among male Elders, let alone natives or naturalized civilians. Yet she weighed only 59 kilograms. As a result, she had become the female Elder with the worst figure—at least according to the otaku contingent who were enthusiastic about curves.

"No need for pleasantries, no need." Su Wan waved her hand weakly. "I'm about to die of exhaustion. Is there a carriage?"

"A carriage has been prepared for you." The naturalized-civilian cadre's gaze fell on her bare feet and he got another shock—this woman's feet were even bigger than Elder Wei's! And those shoes slung over her shoulder were like little boats.

"What, never seen a woman before?" Su Wan said with displeasure, noticing the young man staring at her in astonishment.

"Ah, no, no." The worker started in alarm—"attempting to molest a female Elder" was probably a capital offense for one's entire family. But he felt a bit aggrieved inside: *Where did I have such intentions?* He hurriedly spoke up: "The carriage is ready. Please get in."

"What about my luggage?"

"The luggage will be delivered to the guesthouse."

She boarded a two-wheeled "Dongfeng" official carriage. This carriage had been in Kaohsiung for some time, overused in the subtropical heat and lacking maintenance; it was inevitably somewhat dilapidated. The body and oilcloth canopy had been faded by sun and rain. In some places, ugly "patches" had been applied. The seat cushion's rush-mat cover had split at the edges and been carefully mended; it looked rather shabby.

No welcoming ceremony presided over by Elders, no review, no welcoming band, no mounted escort of Japanese security troops with sabers—she had been unceremoniously sent off in a carriage by a lowly clerk. It made her feel somewhat put out: back in Lingao, at least police officers and students would salute her when she came and went. "What kind of treatment is this?" she thought indignantly. "I'm still a senior police officer, after all."

As one of the few Elder police officers in the National Police, Su Wan's presence was pitifully low—her profession meant she spent most of her time at crime scenes, autopsy rooms, laboratories, and classrooms. Even in Lingao, few people knew her. But at her height, once she appeared in that black police uniform, she was sure to leave a strong impression.

Her face was decently proportioned, and her skin was fairly fair. With proper styling, she could be quite attractive. But her small, sharp eyes were constantly darting about, sizing up the exposed skin of every person she saw regardless of gender or age. Her black hair, which could reach her waist when let down, was sometimes loosely worn loose and sometimes braided and draped over her left chest. A pair of black-framed glasses always hung around her slender neck. Her small hands, sometimes painted with red nail polish and sometimes with silver, were often unconsciously propping up her pointed chin.

To forensic scientists of later generations, she was the empire's Song Ci—its Song Tixing—and even more, she was to forensics what Lu Ban was to carpentry: the founding ancestor and "pioneer of modern forensic medicine and criminal investigation." Marble and bronze busts of her, in various sizes and expressions, stood in the lobbies of the Central Police University's Forensic Medicine Department and various other forensic institutions, gazing upon those who came after. The dozen or so monographs she authored were all authoritative works for the profession's theoretical courses. Her portrait was even engraved on medals specially awarded to forensic workers. Below her portrait was her famous saying: *Speak for the dead; uphold the rights of the living.*

But in the old time-space, Su Wan had been merely a mediocre forensic examiner from a third-tier county seat in the northwest, who had lost her job due to a misdiagnosis and, in despair, had defiantly signed up for the transmigration as a single participant.

As the only seedling in a thousand acres, in the field of forensic medicine, she—an actual forensic professional—was naturally more qualified than doctors who treated people or veterinarians who treated animals. Thus, like other Elders who had had basically no prospects in the old time-space, she had risen to high position in this new one. She had been appointed Director of the National Police Forensic Center, with the rank of Regional Commander in the National Police—equivalent to a lieutenant colonel in the military.

The carriage jolted along the gravel road. Kaohsiung was not Lingao, after all; road conditions were limited and there was no small train to ride. The carriage was both slow and bumpy, making Su Wan—already exhausted from seasickness—wonder if she was going to give up the ghost here. Compared to dying, she was even more averse to being buried anywhere other than Cuigang. After clutching her collar and braid and toughing it out the entire way, the carriage finally stopped in front of the central stilt house of the "extremely sci-fi" Kaohsiung Guesthouse.

Su Wan jumped down from the carriage and, after a bout of dizziness, finally steadied herself. The sentry at the door, seeing the carriage and her attire, knew this was the "female Chief" who had been expected recently. He immediately presented arms: "Greetings, Chief!"

Su Wan raised her right hand and returned a very perfunctory salute, forgetting that she was not in uniform and was barefoot. Lowering her head and yawning: "Someone help me."

The sentry did not dare delay and quickly called out. Two soldiers resting in a nearby hut came running out and hastened to support Su Wan by the arms. Su Wan was simply too tall; even though by this time-space's standards the two sentries were burly men, they still seemed rather short beside her. Although she was thin, she weighed them down considerably—especially since they had to climb several dozen steps. It took considerable effort to get her inside and seated.

The room was circular, its interior decorated in the Elders' habitually minimalist style. In the center was a semicircular service counter, and along the walls were rattan benches with matching low tables. Besides that, there were only cabinets standing against the walls.

After slumping in a rattan chair and spacing out for a while, Su Wan finally recovered. When she felt her head and eyes had returned to normal, two servants in short-sleeved summer maid uniforms were already standing before her. Su Wan looked up and suddenly realized that her disheveled hair and bare feet were really too undignified and lacking in the imposing aura befitting an Elder. She quickly and instinctively tried to shrink further into the chair—but for someone 180 centimeters tall, this little chair was rather cramped, and no matter how she tried to shrink, she couldn't shrink much.

Su Wan finally realized she had lost her composure. She hastily suppressed the fatigue and numbness on her face and brought out the cold arrogance and sharpness of a female forensic examiner: "Mm, comrades, who are you?"

"Reporting to Chief: this is the Kaohsiung Special Municipality Guesthouse of the General Affairs Office, a residence specially for Chiefs to stay and recuperate. We are the servants here. The secretary from Chief Wei's office has already given us instructions to arrange for your comfort. We will now prepare your room. Please rest for a moment. If you need anything, just summon us." One of the maids spoke.

"Good. Take me to my room."

"Please follow me, Chief."

When she opened the door and looked, Su Wan's eyes widened: this guesthouse was really "fantasy" or "sci-fi" enough. The guesthouse was located in a sparse grove of tall trees at the foot of a hill. With mountains behind it and facing the sea, it was both well-ventilated and shaded. The place where she stood was the central large domed stilt house, surrounded on all sides by an open veranda. Around this central circular stilt house, in two levels arranged with tasteful irregularity, were smaller dome-shaped stilt houses. All these stilt houses were connected to the central large stilt house by rope-woven suspension bridges.

This was just like the little people's village in Star Wars! So TMD corrupt! Su Wan exclaimed in her heart. No wonder everyone said the overseas Elders were all corrupt without exception—they had taken corruption to an art form. "I wonder how Wei Bachiyuan and the rest are corrupting themselves. Should report them to the Cheka."

Two maids supported the still somewhat dizzy Su Wan across the swaying suspension bridge and opened the door of one of the small huts.

"This is your room. Your luggage has already been delivered. If you wish to bathe, please go to the central hall."

"Thank you. All right, you go about your business. I need to rest a while." Su Wan happily went inside and found it was somewhat similar to a budget hotel from the old time-space, except the room was much more spacious. The décor was extremely simple, but the all-wood construction had its own charm.

She saw a large bed had been set up in the middle of the room, already fully made up. Su Wan didn't care that her feet were dirty; she dropped her military boots on the floor, flung off her jacket, and flopped face-first onto the bed. Just as she had done when returning home from work in the old time-space or at her residence in Lingao, she wriggled about and tugged off her skirt, underwear, and bra, tossed them aside, pulled open the covers, and burrowed in.

"There's nowhere as comfortable as bed—that's really the truth." She murmured cheerfully at the ceiling, stretching her limbs and enjoying the pleasant sensation of the rough cotton sheets and fine lan-grass mat against her skin, completely unbothered by the fact that she was sleeping naked.

"I wonder whose distinguished corpse they've specially summoned me to dissect." Su Wan happily rolled over, thinking of her assignment. Less than a minute later, she was asleep.
