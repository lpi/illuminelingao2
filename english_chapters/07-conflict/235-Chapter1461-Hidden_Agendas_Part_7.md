# Chapter 1461 - Hidden Agendas (Part 7)

"What legal issues?"

Wu Nanhai thought, *Bad—my pretentiously profound questioning has aroused his suspicion and wariness. This isn't good. I should be guiding him through casual discussion instead.*

He immediately resumed the peaceful, magnanimous smile he wore at Agricultural Committee and Senate meetings. "What I mean is, although this case doesn't directly involve a transmigrator, it at least concerns a naturalized citizen closest to a transmigrator. The legal significance shouldn't be underestimated."

Ji Xin said nothing. Just a few days ago, he had attended a Jurisprudence Society meeting where the main topic of discussion was the trial of the Yang Jihong case: professional discussions covering litigation procedure, applicable law, conviction, and sentencing. However, he hadn't expressed many opinions at that meeting. In his view, the Yang Jihong case involved deeper issues—not simply a matter of how to conduct the trial.

Seeing that Ji Xin wasn't showing a standoffish expression, Wu Nanhai continued:

"You know, I don't really understand legal issues. But Yang Xinwu—I don't know if you're familiar with him—ever since the Yang Jihong matter happened, he's been hanging around my place every day, dejected, drowning his sorrows in drink. A young man who used to be positive and sunny has become utterly dispirited. Out of comradely friendship and a sense of responsibility toward my customers, frankly, I'm a bit worried... Yang Jihong's case, no matter how you look at it, deserves sympathy. She's a desolate, lonely girl who became a maidservant here—to put it bluntly, serving with her body. That's already pitiful enough. Now she's pregnant with Transmigrator Yang's child and has become a suspect in custody. Though she's only a naturalized citizen, at the end of the day, two lives are at stake. From any angle, we should demonstrate humanitarian spirit—I personally feel we could show her some leniency."

These words were sincere and moving. Combined with Old Wu's benevolent and kind-hearted face, they were quite persuasive.

Yet Ji Xin's expression turned peculiar. Wu Nanhai sensed something was off, but the words were already out—he couldn't take them back. He had no choice but to continue along his original train of thought:

"You see, the core of this matter is still the issue of native identity and rights. As long as sufficient legal assistance can be provided, I believe that..."

Ji Xin nodded and interrupted him: "Are you suggesting I serve as Yang Jihong's defense attorney?"

For a moment, Wu Nanhai felt slightly embarrassed. But since his purpose had been seen through, futile cover-ups were useless. He could only nod. "That's right." As if to explain his suggestion, he added: "Although she's a native naturalized citizen, two lives are ultimately at stake, including a transmigrator's bloodline. If she really falls into Fu Youdi's hands—ah, I can hardly imagine. Even I can't bear the thought."

Ji Xin said: "She won't end up with Fu Youdi—but the maidservant system itself is reactionary and inhumane. I strongly disapprove of it."

"Exactly, I also disapprove of this return to slavery. That's why I hope you can use your legal knowledge to save her." Wu Nanhai raised his teacup. "'Same sky, same face.'"

This was a lyric from the old era, now used by Ji Xin as the slogan for the Native Rights Protection Association. Hearing it, Ji Xin was silent for a long while before finally saying:

"This is my duty. Since I established this association—even if it's just my one-man association—I have to see it through to the end and practice what I preach. However, recent developments have made me feel the case is somewhat complicated..." He pondered for a moment. "You're the third person in recent days to make this suggestion to me."

Now it was Wu Nanhai's turn to show surprise. He couldn't help asking: "Who else?"

"One is Transmigrator Yang himself." Ji Xin seemed thoughtful. "And the other is a female transmigrator I'm not familiar with."

"A female transmigrator?!"

"Yes," Ji Xin tilted his head back and scratched his chin, "I can't recall her name... surnamed Cheng, I think."

"Cheng Yongxin?"

"Right, that's the name." Ji Xin nodded. "She also came to discuss this matter with me, and talked to me about protecting native women's rights—she seemed like someone with ideas. If she hadn't explained herself, I would have thought she was sent by the Queen."

"Oh," Wu Nanhai said noncommittally. *What is she doing getting involved?* Wu Nanhai realized there was something here. Last time when Xiao Zishan had specifically called to ask which transmigrators had spoken with Yang Xinwu, he had seen Cheng Yongxin's name in the teahouse's hospitality and consumption record book. Moreover, the waitresses had also mentioned seeing Cheng Yongxin enter Yang Xinwu's private room. Transmigrator Yang had even specially ordered extra coffee.

Wu Nanhai was beginning to regret getting involved in this matter. But having come this far, he couldn't retreat. He said half-jokingly:

"I'm just someone who loves to meddle in others' affairs. I can't stand seeing comrades in low spirits. It affects my business. Besides, I'm about to become a father—an expectant dad can't bear to see children suffer. Never mind that Yang Jihong's child carries a transmigrator's blood; even if it didn't, for the sake of the unborn child, we should try to help her."

---

"But this case is indeed a headache. I've seen the materials. The facts are clear, the evidence is sufficient—going for a not-guilty defense would be difficult. I can probably only work from the 'humanitarian' angle."

Wu Nanhai had originally thought he possessed a "rare commodity" that could resolve this case, but given the current situation, he decided not to reveal it for now, lest Ji Xin grow suspicious of his excessive enthusiasm.

"I'll leave that to your efforts then. What did we all come to this era for? Isn't it to enjoy the taste of being on top? Popova's case is a matter of face for Transmigrator Yang, and also a matter of face for the many soy sauce transmigrators. Please ask the legal people to handle it well."

"I'll do my best."

After seeing Ji Xin off, Wu Nanhai quietly returned to the "accounting room"—the teahouse's "manager's office." As the teahouse's scale had grown, Chuqing rarely personally greeted customers at the front anymore. She now mainly worked behind the scenes to oversee everything. She had specifically studied basic commercial accounting on her own, and now personally managed all the teahouse's accounts and operations.

Though he didn't know what scheme this Cheng Yongxin was up to, after the Administrative Office inquiry last time, he had begun paying attention to this mysterious woman, asking Chuqing and the waitresses to keep a close eye on her movements.

"Husband, what's wrong? Is something the matter?" Seeing his expression fluctuating after he entered, Chuqing asked with concern.

"Nothing." Wu Nanhai shook his head. "Are you busy right now?"

"Not busy. Those two girls are very clever—I've already taught them the teahouse's bookkeeping method. It's made things much easier for me..."

Business was exceptionally good—so good that the loan they'd taken from Delong had been repaid in full two-thirds ahead of schedule. With operations flourishing, the "accounting room" had been upgraded to "manager's office." Because Chuqing had been discovered to be pregnant three months ago, she and Wu Nanhai had discussed buying two maidservant trainees with good accounting scores from the maidservant school to handle the teahouse's financial bookkeeping and administrative work in the "manager's office."

Wu Nanhai had originally wanted to promote from among the senior waitresses at the teahouse, but Chuqing thought that since the waitresses were now naturalized citizens whose indentures had been lifted, she didn't trust them. She insisted on buying trainees from the maidservant school who still carried death-contracts on their backs.

Wu Nanhai felt this wasn't quite right—but Chuqing felt it was exactly right: "This way I can feel at ease. It's convenient for me to teach and discipline them. Otherwise, I can't beat them, can't scold them—they're hard to manage. Besides, if they do well in the future, we can lift their indentures then. If they don't do well, we can demote them to waitresses. Carrot and stick together—that's how to keep them in line."

Wu Nanhai couldn't out-argue his wife and had to agree.

"Do something for me. Quietly." Wu Nanhai lowered his voice and instructed Chuqing to compile all the consumption records related to Cheng Yongxin since the Yang case began.

"...Which days she came, how long she stayed, what she consumed, which table she sat at, which people shared a table or private room with her—compile it all separately for me. Do it yourself."

"Yes, husband." Chuqing was somewhat puzzled, but she never asked questions about affairs between transmigrators.

The teahouse's account books were extremely complex, all stored in a locked small room inside the accounting office. Only Wu Nanhai and Chuqing had keys. In one row of black-lacquered filing cabinets, transmigrator visit and consumption records were stored by date. Using card indexes, one could easily locate each transmigrator's consumption records, including what they ordered, amounts spent, seat or room numbers, and even which naturalized citizens had accompanied them.

The ledgers didn't include conversation contents—that would absolutely cross the line. Wu Nanhai wasn't so blinded by greed as to go that far. But merely knowing who had sat at the same table with whom, who had been in the same private room, was enough to infer a great deal.

The materials Chuqing compiled arrived on his desk the next day. Wu Nanhai looked over her consumption records at the teahouse these past days and was startled. According to the records, Cheng Yongxin had come to the teahouse almost every day recently, frequently meeting with various people. Just among those obviously connected to the Yang Jihong case, there were Mu Min, Salina, Su Wan, and Yang Xinwu, plus Panpan and several others.

Wu Nanhai sketched on white paper with a pencil: Mu Min, Salina, and Su Wan were all members of the National Police and directly handled the case. Panpan was from the Propaganda and Literature Department. The common thread among these four was that they were all women.

Three women make a drama; now add Cheng Yongxin and Mu Min—five women, all transmigrators, gathering together. What were they up to? Wu Nanhai hesitated for a long while, then took out his PHS from a locked drawer and dialed a number:

"Director Xiao? This is Nanhai. There's something I'd like to report to you—"
