# Chapter 1484 - Hale's Cannon

This was the newly cast Dahlgren gun. Ever since Hale fished this type of cannon from the wreckage of the 901, the arsenal began working to copy it. But limited by workers' abilities and lack of technical details, Hale couldn't adopt the Rodman casting method (center-cooling) critical to the Dahlgren gun's performance. This made the cast Dahlgren guns mere external copies, their performance greatly discounted. For safety, no matter how surprised he was that the "Australians" cast only 130mm Dahlgren guns, the caliber of similar guns he organized to cast didn't exceed this either. He could only use a second-best method in artillery production: forge the gun body with a water-powered drop hammer, then bore it to make a smoothbore gun, and finally cut rifling inside the bore.

There were many defects in worker quality and workshop machinery operating efficiency, making it difficult to improve artillery quality and output. Especially the lack of sufficient fuel and raw materials left the factory often in a state of semi-stoppage—the resources the sleepy Philippine colony could currently provide were truly insignificant for Hale's ambition. He had to rely on long-cycle, unreliable import trade to obtain everything—this was why he was so anxious to develop the Baguio gold mine and propose the colonial authorities build a mint. The Philippines lacked exportable commodities; relying merely on royal subsidies from New Spain and local taxes could hardly support such massive military preparation.

However, producing cannons that made Spaniards click their tongues was already huge progress. The cunning Mr. Hale always used that cannon made by the Bopu Arsenal for firing demonstrations to leave a deep impression on dignitaries.

Fernando Marcos was just a seaman who couldn't tell front-loading from breech-loading, but when he saw the never-before-seen Dahlgren guns rolled out of the casting workshop, he still sincerely cheered for his patron.

A human-powered crane made of logs stood in the open space. This most common machine in the factory area was designed for lifting heavy guns. But the three Tagalog laborers Marcos saw now weren't busy lifting cannons; instead, they tied several seemingly heavy wooden crates together, hoisting them up to place on a waiting oxcart. Compared to lifting boxes onto the cart one by one, this was naturally much more labor-saving and faster. Marcos suddenly realized something was terribly wrong. Having spent considerable time in Hale's factory, he recognized at a glance that those long crate slats were specialized packaging for rockets.

He roared loudly. The driver reined in the horse in terror, seeing Master Marcos leap from the canopy behind him, jump off the cart, and run wildly, screaming abuses as he ran. The native laborers were bewildered. Though they couldn't understand the string of Philippine-style English Marcos popped out in his urgency, seeing a "Master" so agitated and angry meant something terrible had happened. As if to prove Marcos's rage wasn't groundless, the rope binding the ammunition crates snapped right then. The wooden crates smashed onto the rammed earth with heavy whistles; shattered wood wrapped in dry hard mud clods flew in all directions.

Marcos didn't know how long he lay on the ground before realizing no explosion had occurred. He saw the three native laborers still standing there dumbfounded. Although their naked upper bodies were cut all over by flying wood splinters, some wounds bleeding, they stood motionless like wooden chickens, completely scared silly.

The packing crates had shattered on the ground, and the tin lining burst open, revealing the rockets inside. Because of simple structure and convenient processing, the output of Hale rockets far exceeded cannons and shells; large quantities of finished products were transported out of the factory daily. Marcos checked roughly; luck was good, only the guide sticks on two rockets were broken. The papier-mâché pressed warheads were safe and sound, though there were impact dents on some sheet-iron rolled bodies. Thinking these iron sheets and paper shells were stuffed with terrible gunpowder and incendiary agents, thinking this accident nearly buried the entire factory and himself, Marcos flew into a rage. He picked up his cane and rained blows on the three trouble-making coolies. The three unlucky devils fell to the ground, heads broken and bleeding, wailing and crying. But Marcos showed no intention of stopping; the cane flew up and down, every blow with full force, just like when the Zheng family overseer whipped him.

This commotion was quite loud. Marcos suddenly felt his right arm holding the cane grabbed by a strong hand. His patron Hale, or Paul, stood behind him, wearing the priest's black robe as usual, just without the hat. "Marcos, confine these three idiots first. There's plenty of time later to teach them how to work according to rules."

Several Chinese foremen led a small squad of coolies to carry the rockets scattered on the ground back to the workshop as Hale instructed. Marcos noticed then that there were some Spaniards beside Hale. He recognized a few as East Indies Fleet officers; Captain Zubizarretta was also among them. They surrounded a middle-aged officer dressed in brocade with a majestic appearance. The bright ribbons, medals on his chest, and epaulets covered with tassels and embroidery all indicated this was a noble general. Marcos naturally had no access to the colony's high society circles; otherwise, he would surely have recognized this new celebrity in Manila, Commodore Marquis Don Juan de Baza y Cordova. He had traveled via Mexico to Manila on royal orders to inspect the novelties appearing here. This news stirred up a thousand waves in the colony's upper circles. The wind changed overnight; most colonial officials declared themselves staunch supporters of Governor Salamanca. Consequently, the eccentric Japanese monk Paul, who lived in seclusion, once again became a hot favorite.

"As you can see, a small accident just happened here," Hale explained the incident to the Commodore. His soft tone and serene attitude gave the latter high trust and favor toward him. "There's a benefit to this. You witnessed with your own eyes that rockets and ammunition made by my method won't explode even when hitting the ground from a height of 10 varas. After fuzes are installed, they will destroy hit targets with devastating explosions and fire, yet won't bring any harm to the shooter, nor explode accidentally when flying over your troops' heads. Sir, the weapons we manufacture are reliable for His Majesty's army and terrible for His Majesty's enemies. In both aspects, they far exceed any existing howitzers. Perhaps someone told you these weapons are difficult to manufacture and costly; that is all nonsense. Please follow me; facts will prove everything." Hale turned and walked toward the workshop gate: "Marcos, lead the way for us."

Hale's tour route was obviously carefully arranged beforehand. The Spanish officers, insisting on wearing formal dress in the heat, were first led to visit the casting and forging workshop, privately called "Fiery Hell" by devout Catholic native laborers. Walls of rammed unslaked lime and clay wrapped around tall wooden pillars supporting a semi-open roof to facilitate fire prevention and air circulation. The high roof reflected the banging of water hammers and the roar of water-powered bellows, mixed with the hiss of red-hot iron dipped in water and hundreds of other almost unearthly strange noises, all gathering in this gloomy space—sunlight penetrating between wall and roof was obscured and polluted by boiling heat and thick smoke. amidst this dim smoke and fire, one couldn't distinguish Chinese workers from Tagalog native workers at all. They were smoked black all over, crawling in and out like ants, blurry, haunting, acting like ghosts.

Marcos was already familiar with these scenes, but he still watched with awe as workers lifted red-hot forgings onto the anvil. The red light reflected on their faces painful from the heat; they moved the copper and iron forgings silently and carefully. Cams driven by water wheels lifted the arm, and the drop hammer crashed down heavily onto the forging. Sparks flew, like weapons of giants in myths—one hammer blow could shatter a man to pieces.

Marcos was already dripping with sweat. The Spanish gentlemen had long taken off their hats and wigs. Several guys wearing ruffs almost fainted, constantly asking attendants to pour wine to quench thirst. Hale seemed oblivious; he continued to lead guests to view the furnaces. Craftsmen in pairs used iron tongs to lift crucibles; molten steel flashed with blinding white light as it flowed into sand molds. Sweating like rain and panting, the Spaniards listened to Hale introduce in an unchanging serene tone how this crucible steel could make the best swords and drill bits.

Brick reverberatory furnaces lay under the factory shed like giant coffins. Captain Iker Zubizarretta approached the massive water-powered bellows in front of the furnace, wanting to catch a cool breeze next to the huge wooden fan blades opening and closing continuously. Unexpectedly, a laborer opened the furnace door at that moment. Incandescent heat light instantly pierced the thick smoke and dust, scaring Iker into backing away repeatedly. Laborers added fuel to the reverberatory furnace. Flames rushed out of the furnace with a roar like a gluttonous beast, swallowing firewood, charcoal, or whole baskets of dried peat dug from swamps as if licking oil. Although Hale described to the Commodore the magnificent scene of molten iron pouring out to cast cannon blanks with Iliad-style verses, the Spaniards were eager to flee this hell full of fire and smoke. They were blocked for a while at the exit passage by a heavy-duty trolley, watching a cast cannon blank being hoisted onto the trolley and pushed along the hardwood track paved on the ground to the next workshop. Even after cooling in the sand pit, the massive cast iron cannon blank still radiated unbearable heat, emitting a dark deep red glow like a beast's eye.
