# Chapter 1431 - The Cannon

Vince raised his binoculars. Three stout wooden poles had been erected diagonally inside the battery parapet, fixed together at the top with iron fittings. A block and tackle hung from them, with a hook at the end. The Spaniards were directing coolies to install a winch with a trailing rope nearby. He studied this derrick with concentration for a while, then turned his gaze to the beach below the battery. Most notably, a plank road had been laid on the beach. Colonial soldiers in gaudy uniforms were gathered beside the plank path; some held pikes, but more were waving bamboo whips and forks used for matchlocks to drive a large group of local coolies. The coolies, stripped to the waist, were hauling or carrying ropes that drew the observer's eye to the heavy burden they were pulling. A black cannon—this was definitely not another bored-out old Spanish bronze gun. It was larger than any gun on any fortress or ship in Macao or Manila in this time-space, comparable perhaps only to the main gun the Australians mounted on their steam warships. The black iron barrel presented a peculiar curve, looking like a magnified soda bottle. Compared to the thick, squat barrel, the triangular carriage made of timber beams was extremely crude, fitted underneath with four pitifully small iron wheels. If not for the wooden planks, such a clumsy and extremely uncoordinated contraption would surely have sunk into the beach sand and been unable to move.

"When was it spotted?" Vince asked.

"Before sunrise, 5:15. We spotted a ship," the Special Reconnaissance Team member said. Vince looked through the binoculars in the direction he pointed, and sure enough, a sloop with sails furled was anchored near the coast southwest of the battery. "Since then, the Spanish have been busy laying the temporary road. An hour ago they set up the derrick. The cannon was just unloaded from the ship by block and tackle."

The binoculars turned back to the cannon being dragged. Soldiers shouted, and bamboo whips and forks fell frequently on the coolies' heads and backs. The coolies' skin was covered in welts, and under the lashing and heavy weight, they constantly showed expressions of pain. Vince was unmoved by this cruel scene. He searched his memory. Visiting the batteries at Fort Quemoy with his father in his childhood was too distant a memory. But he clearly remembered that during Army training at Fort Jackson, he had visited Charleston to see Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie. That time, Recruit Vince Lando had been stunned by the massive Dahlgren guns. Now he was surprised once again by a similar cannon and carriage. Although lacking professional knowledge of antique ordnance, Vince at least knew that those fortress guns of the Civil War era were made to sink ironclads. If the *Esmeralda* were unlucky enough to take a hit from one, the consequences were easy to imagine.

"If I gave the order now, could you kill one of them?" Vince asked suddenly.

"Can't hit them. Range is over two thousand meters," the sniper replied. "But if we take up a position over there, no problem." He pointed to a sparse patch of brush south of the villa.

Vince shook his head. The tower was an excellent observation post that couldn't be given up. He regretted now not adding a few Barretts or .50 McMillans to the *Mackerel*'s cargo hold—even an M2 heavy machine gun would have been good. He opened the cover of the speaking tube on the wall and pulled the bell again: "Mimi, is that you? Send the big telescope and the camera up to the tower top. Right now."

"God knows when those bastards will start test firing," he muttered as he closed the speaking tube.

When the Count returned to the shooting house, Captain Pilar and his colleagues were completely drunk, lying crookedly on chaise longues, snoring loudly. Andrade was engaged in a heated discussion with the mayor about Oriental art and idolatry, occasionally quoting famous maxims from St. Augustine and Aquinas. The Count motioned for a servant to bring a chaise longue and sat down on the veranda next to Alfonso.

Vince casually studied this newly prominent figure who was the talk of Manila lately. His gold-embroidered uniform was new, setting off his newly acquired medal and sash quite dazzlingly. Alfonso spoke first, a hint of drunkenness in his voice.

"Count, is this way of drinking your genius invention? Rum with iced fruit juice—it's incredibly refreshing, like a cool cloud of mist."

"Back home, someone once said that if I'd switched trades to become an innkeeper, I'd have been even better at it than fighting heathens." Vince made a gesture, ordering a servant to bring over the shaker and well-chilled kvass. "Talk to me about natural philosophy, sir."

"Natural philosophy? My dear Fananovoua, I am no doctor or scholar. I am a soldier who wins God's favor by fighting, just like you."

"No, you heard Pilar? If how to kill a man faster with bullets and swords is natural philosophy, then how to kill a hundred men with one cannon shell should belong even more to the realm of natural philosophy."

"You mean the Paulo Cannon? That is indeed a delightful thing, just like your wine. As long as you don't happen to be standing in front of the muzzle."

"So tell me about it."

"Tell you what? The Paulo Cannon, or Paulo the cannon-founder?"

"Tell me everything, dear Alfonso. Tell me as much as you know," Vince forgot a large glass of cocktail into his hand. "These things are really interesting. Who doesn't want to achieve more merit on the battlefield?"

"Speaking of this Señor Paulo, he really is mysterious..." Major Alfonso, stimulated by alcohol, was in high spirits to talk.

"Is he still so mysterious even after you've worked with him?"

"Of course, of course, I have indeed worked with him. But to tell the truth, this is a man whose inner thoughts you can never know—perhaps he really is as the priests say, so pious that he doesn't care about the outside world."

"Indeed, this wondrous person didn't even attend the triumph—giving up such great honor is truly perplexing."

"He doesn't care about that. Besides, shortly after returning to Manila, he boarded that fast sloop and left again. Except for the Governor, no one in the Philippines knows where he went. He does whatever he wants, and His Excellency the Governor always expresses unconditional support—Señor Paulo is now the Governor's closest friend." A slightly lewd smile appeared at the corner of the Major's mouth. "But every time he comes back, there are always some surprising new tricks unveiled. Just you wait and see."

At this very moment, hundreds of nautical miles from Manila, on the desolate west coast of the northern tip of Samar Island, the chants of coolies and curses in a mix of Spanish and local dialect echoed in the air.

On this desolate, uninhabited coastline filled with dangerous reefs and shoals, three sailing ships of various sizes were anchored. On the quarterdeck of one small single-masted lateen-rigged sloop, Evaristo Okamoto was watching the coolies struggling in the shoals. Under the scorching sun and the relentless whips of the overseers, they were tottering one by one, yet had to exert all their strength to drag the ropes that chafed their skin mercilessly.

On the shoal, where the seawater came up to a person's waist, lay a massive pile of debris. Rusted iron ribs covered in dead marine organisms stabbed chaotically into the air. Attached to these iron ribs in bits and pieces were plates whose color could no longer be discerned.

The wreckage of the Type 901 gunboat *Nongchao*, which had capsized and sunk off the coast west of the northern tip of Samar Island during Operation Hunger due to a typhoon, had been washed up onto the shore during a recent typhoon.

Evaristo Okamoto was very interested in Operation Hunger. from the Spanish prisoners who had returned to Manila after being ransomed and from his own "fiancée," he learned many details of the operation, and also learned that an Australian ship had sunk at Samar Island.

To Evaristo Okamoto, a ship was a treasure trove. Especially for someone like him who had arrived in this time-space with nothing. He immediately brought men to Samar Island and soon found the spot where the *Nongchao* had sunk.

However, the Navy's thorough disposal of the *Nongchao* left him helpless with the wreckage. The *Nongchao*'s wreck lay on underwater sands and reefs, three or four meters deep even at low tide. And from the huge breaches in the hull, it was clear that the structural parts of the ship had been destroyed. With the technical resources he possessed, he could not salvage it at all—even if he could salvage it, it had no repair value, and furthermore, he lacked the ability to repair it.

After several exploratory dives using a diving bell, Evaristo Okamoto got nothing useful. He could only return in frustration. However, the *Nongchao* sunk in the waters of Samar Island remained the object of his obsession.

Evaristo Okamoto had no doubt that these so-called Australians had destroyed the *Nongchao*, but this destruction was carried out after the *Nongchao* had capsized and sunk, which meant their destruction and dismantling of the ship could not have been very thorough. In other words, this ship was still a treasure trove—provided he could touch it.

Paulo-Hale's salvage conditions were very unfavorable. He had no diving equipment, and using a primitive diving bell to dive allowed very limited action.

However, God seemed to be favoring his enterprise. Shortly after a recent typhoon passed, a ship passing near Samar Island brought news: the wreck of a strange large ship had been pushed onto the beach by the storm—and the ship's ribs were actually made of iron!

Hearing the news, Evaristo Okamoto immediately set out with a fleet. He took with him hundreds of coolies, large quantities of rope, winches, and blocks, and even a complete blacksmith shop. He prepared to thoroughly dismantle the wreckage of this ship on Samar Island and see what exactly he could get out of it.
