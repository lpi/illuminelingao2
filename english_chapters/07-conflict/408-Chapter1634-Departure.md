# Chapter 1634 - Departure

Senator Apartment District Service Center, "Senator-Only Library."

Zhang Yunmi sat at the reading room table. On the lustrous black lacquer tabletop lay a freshly sealed letter. A white Senator-exclusive letter envelope, faintly printed with a gray Holy Ship Sunrise watermark—elegant and exquisite.

On the perforation seal, the red sealing wax was imprinted with her seal—a seal script character "Zhang," artistically stylized into the shape of a flying phoenix.

At this moment, Zhang Yunmi's face had completely lost its usual youthful vitality, replaced by a leaden pallor. Not knowing how long she had been in a daze, suddenly, a gleam of light burst forth from her ashen gaze, sweeping toward the bookshelves a few rows to her front left. These were all books "For Senators Only." Finally, her wandering eyes fixed on position I210.1/1:3—she remembered it so clearly only because she had just returned that copy of *The Complete Works of Lu Xun* to its place before writing the letter.

Human blood steamed buns, huh...

Zhang Yunmi pressed one hand on the envelope as countless noisy voices echoed in her mind again.

"Yunmi! No matter what happens, I'll support you! Your business is my business! Whoever makes you unhappy for a moment, I'll make them unhappy for life!"

*Self-proclaimed manager classmate, outside of conversations about dance rehearsals, can our other topics even add up to 3000 words for a single update? Don't you think you're meddling too much? And you ran to school to show your loyalty—just because you like me doesn't mean you're already my boyfriend, okay!*

"Little Zhang, you're the ACE idol group that our Plaid Skirt Club worked so hard to build. We can't tolerate this kind of thing! We must seek justice for you!"

*Hehe!* Zhang Yunmi reflexively released a goddess-class skill. *You guys with your leg fetish! Foot fetish! Stockings fetish! Safety shorts fetish! Spending 80 yuan on standing tickets and craning your necks to watch the performance, waiting for Mr. Floor to make a contribution, you otaku!*

"Today's politics class, we'll discuss the dialectic of procedural justice and substantive justice..."

"This history class, we'll talk about how the real-power nobility of Europe handled their face issues..."

When Zhang Yunmi recalled these, she couldn't even summon a "hehe" in her heart.

"Little Zhang, Auntie Du is telling you! This issue is not a simple issue!"

"Little Miss Zhang, as a modern woman, I, Sister Cheng..."

"Little Zhang, in Uncle Shan's experience of struggle..."

"Senator Zhang, if we don't pursue this matter, how can we uphold the dignity and authority of Senators? This is a matter of right and wrong, you mustn't be confused!"

*Not a single good person among them!*

For the self-proclaimed boyfriend's image, for some group's face, for their respective so-called ideals, for attacking dissidents... you've been buzzing around me long enough!

Zhang Yunmi's delicate palm touched the sealing wax. This artistic rendering of the seal script "Zhang" was from a year before the crossing—the elementary school handicraft class assignment was to carve radish stamps. To finish the assignment, Dad stayed up all night designing it for her.

But none of you understand me!

No matter what, forever and ever, he is my dad!

Maltreating a Senator's child, slandering a Senator—two charges enough for the "Ten Unpardonables." According to the Law Society's opinion, enough to warrant the death penalty. Right now, the Law Society people were drumming up discussions on how this court should operate, what laws to apply, and the selection of judges.

As for the other parties, they all had their own agendas and were actively maneuvering. Although this matter hadn't resulted in death like the Maid Suicide Case, because it touched on several sensitive issues at different levels, it had triggered quite a battle among the Senators—even major military and political events like sending troops to Guangzhou Prefecture couldn't dampen certain people's enthusiasm.

Zhang Yunmi was at the center of the storm, suffering its ravages every day. Different people, different interests, different propositions, yet they all hoped unanimously that Zhang Yunmi would do something to add weight to their side. Old Zhang? His image had already been nailed as "went home and knelt before everything that could be knelt to for the maid who could bear him a son and a daughter." Apart from the position of "negative example," no arena of public opinion had any expectations for Old Zhang.

*I'm young! But I'm not stupid!*

Dad must be supported, even though his position in the Senate was finished. He would never be put in an important position again. From now until death, he would just be a "salary-collecting Chief." Even if she despised that maid, that was only about that person herself. When she thought about how that "ambitious" mom dumped her on the "unambitious" dad, this man had toiled to maintain this broken family with his income that wasn't meager but was hardly abundant. And at the crossroads of fate, he had also made a rare effort to fight hard and joined this magical time-travel group.

"Girl, I'm going with them now to fight, not to find myself a wife. You're grown up. It'll be hard for me to take good care of you anymore. I'm going for you." She vaguely remembered the words Dad said the night of the Maid Revolution as he tucked the wrench into his belt. When he spoke, his eyes were sincere.

*Dad, your daughter only wishes for you to be happy.*

Since this was the case, even if Qian Duoduo hadn't come to hint, Zhang Yunmi had long thought of a response plan. Since the vast majority of people believed that woman deserved to die, and the Executive Committee also believed that such a "major event" couldn't be dismissed with just the words "family matter," then do whatever you want! But according to the principles of "aristocratic politics" that you used to educate us Junior Senators, since Dad has clearly stated forgiveness, I'll give you a pardon letter too.

But I don't want to stay here anymore. Zhang Yunmi's heart was ice cold, as if the blazing tropical sun couldn't dispel this chill.

I want to leave. Anywhere but Hainan Island will do.

For an instant, she even thought of completely leaving this messy Senate and disappearing without a trace. Roll your doctrines and ambitions as far away as they can go.

However, she also knew this was impossible. She was destined to be unable to disappear without a trace like characters in novels.

"Uncle Xiao, this is the pardon letter I personally signed, or you can call it a statement or whatever. It doesn't matter." Facing this General Manager of the Senate, Zhang Yunmi's voice had lost much of its cold edge.

*Still throwing a tantrum, huh!* Xiao Zishan sighed to himself but didn't take issue with the slight impropriety in this Junior Senator's tone.

"Uncle Xiao, I've already mentioned it to Uncle Hu and Principal Zhang. I want to apply for an administrative internship."

"Ah!?" Xiao Zishan, holding the wax-sealed pardon letter, didn't react for a moment when he heard this.

"As you know, recently there's been a lot of talk that's been very disruptive to my studies—" Zhang Yunmi repeated to Xiao Zishan the same words she'd said to Hu Qingbai and Zhang Zhixiang. For some reason, Zhang Yunmi always intuitively felt that Xiao Zishan could play a decisive role in this matter.

"Our systematic study ended long ago. What remains now is specialized training. For me, it's just reading, writing, and translating more foreign language materials—I can do that anywhere. So I want to apply for an administrative internship, go somewhere outside Hainan Island to lay low for a while." By this point, Zhang Yunmi already had a look of grievance on her face, appearing incredibly pitiable, as if the allusion "I too find her sympathetic" should be transferred to her.

*Sigh! This girl has it hard too! Running into such a thing, running into such a father.*

"But Uncle Hu and Principal Zhang both said they can approve their parts, but since there's no precedent for an underage Senator applying for an administrative internship outside of Hainan Island, they suggested I come here to submit the pardon letter and ask Uncle Xiao how to handle this process."

*Indeed there's no precedent. But if this comes to me and we have to hold a formal meeting to discuss a new procedure, I feel like you won't need to think about going out to relax.* Xiao Zishan silently complained in his heart about the Senators' damned decision-making efficiency on these "major policies," then scratched his head in great difficulty—*How exactly should I handle this for her?*

"How about Qiongshan? Or Sanya. Sanya's been developed pretty well now. It's a nice place for vacation."

"I don't want a vacation. I want to go farther away, preferably off Hainan Island." Zhang Yunmi said.

Off Hainan Island—Jeju Island, Shandong were a bit far and the conditions were somewhat harsh. Besides, whether Little Zhang could handle the bumps of a long voyage was also a question. Taiwan had had an assassination incident, and malaria was prevalent there too. Hangzhou had a Luddite movement, and sending her there would immediately make him a focus of public opinion! Where else was there... Hongay, that place was about to go to war. Guangzhou?!

"Tell you what. There's going to be action in Guangzhou. Senator Liu Xiang—you know him, right!" He paused as he spoke, and seeing Zhang Yunmi nod, Xiao Zishan then remembered that Liu Xiang seemed to have taught the Junior Senators at Fangcaodi before.

"Well, in the next few days, he'll be taking his team over there to take over the Guangzhou regime. And he's been authorized with the power to invite other Senators to join his team. If you really want to leave Hainan Island for a while and find a place for administrative internship, you can ask him for help. I'll put in a good word for you too."

Recalling the gaze that swept back and forth three times when she first met Liu Xiang on the *Feiyun* the other day, Zhang Yunmi felt that convincing this Teacher Liu shouldn't be a big problem.

"Then I'll go pack my bags now. We'll leave in the next few days!"

"No rush." Xiao Zishan said, "Although you've issued a pardon letter, the Honor Court trial process still needs to go through. After all, this is a 'serious case.'" He weighed his words. "Anyway, the trial will be held in the next few days. Just wait a bit."

"Can we skip the trial?"

"This matter is actually quite complicated." Xiao Zishan said, "Actually, if you consider the facts of the case, you'll understand. Strictly speaking, this has already become a public prosecution case. Although 'a Senator's power is above all,' legally speaking, this kind of pardon can only mitigate punishment, not fully exonerate..."
