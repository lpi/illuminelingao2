# Chapter 1623 - The Role of the Indigenous Protection Association

"No, he's innocent. At least, I believe he's innocent now," Ji Xin said. "The matter was widely rumored among the natives at the time. As President of the Indigenous Protection Association, I received complaints from several of the Zhang family's relatives, so I conducted my own investigation."

Ma Jia listened in silence.

"I consider myself to have some investigative ability, but although the circumstances were strange and suspicious, I have to admit I cannot produce any evidence to accuse him. Logically speaking, it seemed unnecessary for him to do such a thing."

"Is there a file on this?"

"There must be one in the National Police records. All unnatural deaths require a death investigation. If you want to see my personal notes, you'll have to come to my office."

"No need. I trust your conclusion."

"However, through this investigation, I discovered some intriguing things," Ji Xin said. "Our Master Lu harbors soaring ambitions."

"Soaring ambitions?"

"Yes. It started a few years ago. At that time, we were both participating in a grassroots research activity for the Social Affairs Department, which also involved taking in native orphans and impoverished children. He recommended and sponsored four children to study at Fangcaodi."

"Isn't that a good thing?"

"Correct. It is indeed commendable," Ji Xin said. "But then he came to me privately, asking if I could help recommend two more children for Fangcaodi—recommending them in my name, while he paid the fees."

"Why didn't he come forward himself?" Ma Jia asked. "Plenty of Senators sponsor native children for schooling. The Senate hasn't forbidden it."

"He didn't say. My guess is that he didn't want to appear too prominent," Ji Xin said. "I didn't pay much attention at the time. But later, when I began investigating the Zhang Family Manor affair, I discovered a pattern—he sponsors far too many people. At the time, there were more than ten currently enrolled."

"More than ten?!"

"About eleven or twelve," Ji Xin nodded. "By now, counting both current students and graduates, there must be over twenty."

Ma Jia's expression shifted. Recommending and sponsoring native children had become something of a trend among Senators—similar to wealthy people "playing charity" back in the old world. Although there was a vague hint of cultivating personal followers, very few would sponsor so many.

"This piqued my interest considerably, so I continued my private investigation and discovered even more interesting things."

"After these students graduate and find work, they still maintain close contact with Lu Xuan. They visit Zhang Family Manor to pay their respects, kowtowing during festivals and holidays. Lu Xuan also provides them with financial assistance," Ji Xin said. "That's not all. He has adopted seven or eight native children into his own manor and educates them personally—these aren't in the naturalized citizen system. They're his household slaves."

"He's cultivating retainers!" Ma Jia's jaw nearly dropped. He had suspected that Lu Xuan's sudden visit harbored ulterior motives, but he hadn't expected such an elaborate scheme.

"From a legal standpoint, nothing he's doing is illegal. We've never said Senators can't keep slaves. Besides, these slaves are registered under his wife's name. As long as taxes are paid on time, it's perfectly legal. And as for sponsoring students—many Senators do similar things..."

"But they haven't established relationships of personal dependency based on it!" Ma Jia pointed out the crux of the problem.

Ji Xin nodded. "Precisely."

"I'm grateful you came today," Ma Jia sighed.

"In my opinion, even if I hadn't, you wouldn't have cooperated with him, would you?" Ji Xin smiled. "After all, the Law Society is also conducting research on political structural reform. Why help him carry the sedan chair and let him pick the fruit?"

Ma Jia smiled faintly, gazing out the window. "Even if the Law Society hadn't started that project, it would be timely to begin one now." He fell silent for a moment, then asked, "What brought you here today, anyway?"

"Coincidentally, it relates to this very Senator Lu," Ji Xin said. "You know about my Indigenous Protection Association." He smiled bitterly. "To be honest, the association isn't very popular. Not only do Senators find it an eyesore, but even Du Wen—who trumpets 'Labor is Sacred' all day—attacks me daily for 'paralyzing the working people.'" He let out a long breath. "However, because such an association exists, some naturalized citizens and natives are willing to bring their grievances to me. A few days ago, a Senator's lifestyle secretary came to see me about something troubling."

"Which Senator? What was the matter?" Ma Jia's interest was piqued.

"I won't say which Senator—it doesn't concern him anyway. The key is this lifestyle secretary. She reported that a classmate of hers from the maid training program is being severely abused by her Senator and can barely survive..."

"Is it Lu Xuan's lifestyle secretary?"

"Yes."

Ma Jia found this hard to believe. Senators had all sorts of personalities, and their ways of treating women varied enormously. But almost universally, the humanitarianism and spirit of equality from the old world still exerted a strong influence on them. When it came to the slaves of this era, they could generally be considered "gentle and benevolent." He had heard that some Senators enjoyed S&M play—tying up maids, dripping wax, or spanking them—but that was considered a "kink." Regardless of how they viewed their maids, affection was generally the norm. Deliberate abuse and wanton corporal punishment were unheard of.

"Perhaps he just likes S&M, or likes to roleplay as a master..."

Ji Xin shook his head. "I'm from the 21st century. I can distinguish between S&M and corporal punishment. In short, it's not an exaggeration to say that she's blamed for every breath she takes in Zhang Family Manor. A few days ago, she even fainted after being made to kneel following a beating."

Seeing that Ma Jia still seemed skeptical, he pulled out a notebook from his pocket. "I checked the records at the special outpatient clinics of Lingao General Hospital and Runshitang. There were no relevant medical records. However, Runshitang's sales records show that Lu Xuan's secretary has purchased a Chinese patent medicine for reducing swelling and bruises multiple times. I specifically consulted Liu San about it. He said this medicine was originally a 'stick wound treatment' used by yamen runners after beatings. He improved the formula after acquiring it and gave it to Runshitang for production and sale.

"Judging from the quantity and frequency of her purchases, the consumption is quite significant. Liu San said that if it were really for treating injuries from whips and boards, that person would have been beaten to death long ago. So..."

"So you believe that more than one lifestyle secretary in Zhang Family Manor is being subjected to corporal punishment and abuse—that it's widespread."

"Yes. Corporal punishment of slaves in Zhang Family Manor should not be an isolated phenomenon."

"But this isn't illegal," Ma Jia said.

"Correct. It's not illegal—unless someone dies," Ji Xin said. "That's why I came to discuss this with you."

"Even if someone dies, according to the *Common Program*, Senators are not subject to any punishment," Ma Jia said. "Besides, the Senate hasn't abolished the slavery system yet. It's still legal for natives to keep slaves; even the Senate itself retains provisions for indentured servants. Even for lifestyle secretaries, it was only recently that a document was issued canceling their slave status."

"Is the Law Society not considering abolishing slavery?" Ji Xin asked.

Ma Jia laughed. "You're quite right, but it hasn't been put on the agenda yet. Everything has to wait until we take Guangdong. As for Hainan, at least we've made slavery quite uneconomical. I think you're well aware that economic means are sometimes far more effective than a simple official document. Hastily announcing a law that looks correct but whose clauses are all generalities without implementation details is tantamount to having no law at all."

"I understand. There are a thousand threads to untangle," Ji Xin said. "However, I think the matter of Lu Xuan's lifestyle secretary warrants intervention. If something happens, I'm afraid there'll be another uproar. Our current political ecology has become quite abnormal. People jump at every opportunity, attempting to muddy the waters."

"I'm afraid that will be difficult. Interfering in a Senator's private life is politically incorrect," Ma Jia said. "Unless someone dies."

A look of sorrow crossed Ji Xin's face again. He didn't press the issue further. Under the current system, they were indeed powerless. He asked, "What about Senator Lu's proposal?" He shook his head. "I sense problems with it."

"Of course there are problems." Ma Jia rose from his seat and moved to sit beside Ji Xin. He offered him a cigarette; seeing him refuse, he lit one for himself and took a deep drag. "I also think it's not that simple."

"Then you still intend to revise it for him? He wants the Law Society to endorse his proposal and increase its weight. Aren't you afraid he'll seize the initiative?"

"The purpose of this proposal is to standardize the functional authority of various administrative departments, which aligns with the 'rule by law' policy our Law Society advocates. As the Senate's policy advisory body, it's entirely appropriate for the Grand Library to produce such a proposal offering advice to the Executive Committee. Since he asked us to revise it, the Law Society certainly can't refuse outright—that would be unjustifiable. I think we'll simply correct some conceptual errors in administrative law and make no other changes. Naturally, the Law Society won't sign it either. Let the Grand Library take the limelight." He smiled. "No matter what they're planning, there will come a day when the map is unrolled and the dagger revealed. If he's a fox, he'll show his tail eventually."

Listening to Ma Jia deliver this speech of polished officialese, Ji Xin suddenly felt the face of the man before him had grown somewhat blurred.

Ma Jia seemed to sense Ji Xin's unease and patted him on the shoulder. "Our Law Society has always adhered to the concept of rule by law. We don't play the trick of removing the ladder after someone has climbed the wall."
