# Chapter 1490 - Test Fire

Therefore, Hale hoped more than anyone that the Zheng clique could recover its vitality. For this reason, he hit it off instantly with Zheng Zhifeng who came seeking an alliance. In his view, although Zheng Chenggong had the status of a legitimate son and appeal, plus official support from the Great Ming, and the decisive strategy revealed in seizing Anping made his group not to be underestimated, he was the weakest in strength after all—the most important fleet and commercial channels were carved up completely, playing no big role. Moreover, he himself had no intersection with main members of this group; whether the other party could understand his power was also an unknown.

Zheng Zhifeng and he had long cooperation, and was the biggest power faction in Weitou Bay—his appeal was much greater than the Zheng Gongcheng [Zheng Chenggong] group where the lord was young and the state suspicious. Obviously, his ships and payment ability were also much greater.

"Mr. Feng, you look very haggard."

Zheng Zhifeng took off his cloak, "The Zheng family is in precarious danger, yet the situation in Weitou Bay is treacherous. It doesn't allow me a peaceful sleep."

"Is that so. I feel with your appeal and strength, you shouldn't have such worries. Just lacking some decisiveness."

Zheng Zhifeng nodded silently, taking the hot cocoa Marcos brought. He didn't continue this topic.

"Are the goods I want ready?"

"Of course. These are the goods you want; look over them first." Hale was still habitually efficient, without superfluous politeness.

On the open ground outside the straw shed were piled cylindrical objects tightly wrapped in straw ropes, full length nearly one *zhang* long, plus dozens of large and small wooden boxes.

Zheng Zhifeng's gaze involuntarily fixed on the objects. As packaging was opened, dozens of workers set up sturdy scaffolds, then used simple iron pulley blocks to hoist long tubular objects out of boxes, skillfully placing them on pre-assembled gun carriages.

Zheng Zhifeng scanned these novel weapons back and forth with greedy eyes. There were six fully assembled cannons in total, two large and four small. The large ones had a caliber around four inches (Ming inches, approx. 125mm), length over eight feet (Ming feet, approx. 2.5 meters). The small ones had a caliber over three inches (Ming inches, approx. 100mm), length over seven feet (Ming feet, approx. 2.35 meters).

These cannons weren't the Hongyipao familiar to Ming people—usually culverins or demi-culverins, but cannons manufactured adopting relatively modern craftsmanship of integral casting then milling the bore. After pulling rifling, they were muzzle-loading rifled cannons of quite considerable power. Because Hale knew his material defects well, he added iron hoops to the cannons. Thus the cannons appeared very clumsy. Fortunately, Zheng Zhifeng's demand was mainly for naval guns and fortress defense; being clumsy didn't matter much.

As for the better-performing Dahlgren guns he manufactured, the number was very few; he was neither willing nor found it convenient to sell them to Zheng Zhifeng. However, even such modified versions could oppose Australian warships to a certain extent.

"Mr. Paul, are these the powerful cannons you said could rival Australians? How come they look inferior even to Hongyipao?" Zheng Zhifeng asked suspiciously. After all, the cannons before him were different from the massive 18-pounder Hongyipao Zheng Zhifeng had seen before.

A trace of contempt involuntarily appeared at the corner of Hale's mouth. He said coldly: "Mr. Feng, you have reason to question what you see. After all, not everyone understands cannons. Cannons are not the bigger the better." He paused, completely ignoring Zheng Zhifeng's unsightly face from being ridiculed, and continued: "I said, my goods will absolutely not let you down. If your moves had been faster back then, perhaps you wouldn't have lost Xiamen so miserably."

Zheng Zhifeng fell silent. Indeed, if the gun factory could have started earlier, countering Australian "new cannons" wouldn't have been limited to just those few cannons removed from Australian ships. In the entire campaign, except for those few "Australian cannons," no firearm of the Zheng family posed a bit of threat to Australians. Whether on land or sea, Australians occupied the advantage in range. Enemies even routed their gunners with muskets when there was no artillery support. The most terrible thing was they shot surprisingly accurately—even European gunners they hired couldn't achieve such precision.

The cannon fire of the slaughter in Weitou Bay and Kinmen-Xiamen was branded deeply in his mind, making him restless in sleep and eating. Although he accepted most of the Zheng clique's legacy, posing as the biggest power faction in Weitou Bay, he knew his status was fragile. Australian double-masted clippers appeared off Kinmen and Xiamen from time to time, seemingly declaring sovereignty over this sea area. Command flags once sold for two thousand taels of silver now had no takers, because Australian patrol ships would implement capture upon seeing ships with Zheng family flags. Once captured, goods would be confiscated entirely. So shipowners going down to the Western Ocean began changing to fly Australian flags. The convoy patrol system established by Australians made them completely powerless against this. They could only sit and watch this huge revenue drain away. Even some small forces split from the Zheng clique began buying flags from Australians.

Strong enemies waited outside, and Weitou Bay wasn't peaceful inside. Zheng Cai brothers occupied Xiamen, not buying his account at all. Zheng Chenggong occupied Anping relying on official power, also sticking in his throat like a bone. As for other small forces, though not enough to be a worry, they had colluded, speaking in one voice and watching out for each other to avoid being swallowed by the three big forces. His plan to eat small ones first then take big ones to reunify the Zheng family failed repeatedly.

Zheng Zhifeng knew very well the current Australian silence was temporary. They intentionally didn't intervene in disputes in Weitou Bay just to let them fight to the death, consuming each other, finally swallowing them in one gulp—leaving not even bone dragging.

To break the deadlock, only refreshing armaments would do. The Australian attack opened his eyes, truly teaching him a lesson on what "gap" meant. In past armed conflicts with Europeans, the Zheng clique also realized their backwardness in ships and guns, so they introduced European ships, artillery, and technical personnel. But the gap between the two sides hadn't reached the point where the Zheng clique had no power to fight back. In several conflicts along the Chinese coast, they mostly could win using geographical advantage. They hadn't unheard of Australian strong ships and sharp guns, but due to lack of actual feeling, back then key members in the Zheng clique had great disagreement on whether to cooperate with Hale to build a new cannon foundry—after all, this expense was too big, inevitably affecting profit distribution.

Zheng Zhifeng lamented more than once that too much time was wasted in discussion back then. If the cannon factory could have gone into production earlier, though it couldn't turn the tide, at least they wouldn't have lost so miserably. Elder brother wouldn't have been murdered by poison, causing today's split situation.

Now, his only hope lay with Hale. Zheng Zhifeng's subordinates had traveled between Manila and Kinmen many times, bringing not only Hale's letters but also what they saw and heard in Hale's workshops and docks. This made his determination to refresh armaments at all costs increasingly strong.

"As per the original agreement, I will show you the power of this cannon. You will know your spending is value for money."

Saying this, Hale waved his hand to direct his men to start manipulating the cannons.

"Do you need to designate a target?" Hale asked, "I don't want to be said to be playing tricks of burying gunpowder in a mound." Saying this he handed over a telescope.

Zheng Zhifeng nodded, took the telescope, and gazed toward the island interior for a moment.

"Mr. Paul, I want your cannon to hit that earth mound two *li* away. No difficulty, right?"

Hale picked up a monocular telescope: in the field of view over a kilometer away—specifically, his professional eye estimated it to be around 1150 meters—was a mound about 9 meters in radius, standing solitary on a corner, very conspicuous. It could be seen barely clearly with naked eyes, but for artillery aiming, there was indeed certain difficulty.

"No problem." Hale said, "Marcos, take a few gunners to fire. Six guns shoot together."

Marcos first adjusted cannon position and balance with professional means and silently calculated redundancy compensation for recoil distance, so that re-adjusting positioning wouldn't have large error. Then according to cannon table data obtained from previous massive firing experiments, he adjusted elevation angle using a wooden quadrant inserted at the muzzle and adjustable sight at the breech, and moved carriage tail brackets to determine directional firing angle;

Afterward, gunners loaded paper-wrapped powder bags and conical shells with copper bases according to charge quantity specified by cannon table data;

All cannons were arrayed on one firing line, calibrated serial numbers 4-inch guns as A1, A2; 3.2-inch guns as B1, B2, B3; each gun separated by 6 meters, all aimed and in position. After everything was ready, Hale first conducted calibration firing on A1 and B1 guns. After all, cannons underwent long-distance transport and reassembly; compared to original optimal state, there would certainly be changes. So newly assembled cannons also had to undergo calibration firing.

Under normal circumstances, each cannon's condition is different; at least one calibration shot is needed to determine deviation compensation. But Hale was very confident in previous massive firing experiment results and very satisfied with these assemblers' professional quality, so he only chose one of each type of cannon as calibration benchmark.

After two deafening "Boom, Boom" sounds, through the telescope one could clearly see two spots of dust kick up by calibration rounds at distances less than 30 meters front-back and less than 15 meters left-right from the small mound.

Hale nodded secretly to himself. Rifled cannons were after all far more precise than smoothbore guns, and hitting this precision on the first calibration test fire was impressive.

"Muzzle up two degrees!" Marcos lowered the telescope and shouted a new command. Gunners immediately swung sledgehammers to hit wooden wedges, raising the muzzles.
