# Chapter 1482 - Boudoir

Hale pulled back his hood and removed his priestly garb. He picked up the Derringer pistol, playing with it meticulously. Soon he opened the hinged barrel, studied the chamber, then closed it. He cocked the hammer back and pulled the trigger repeatedly, listening carefully to the soft click of the firing pin popping out under ratchet control.

The Baroness saw a note also placed in the wooden box, with scrawled handwriting Weiss had written in haste. She picked it up and read aloud: "To the Rose of Manila, Baroness Ciarlo. From a devout soldier, Vincenzo Lando Vannanova."

"A man facing a duel in a few hours still has the mind to compensate you for the damage to your husband's armor." Hale finished studying the pistol and began fiddling with the accompanying ammunition: pea-sized spherical bullets integrated with percussion caps by paper casings. "Smoothbore gun," he grunted, "Flashy stuff, but still much more useful than your husband's armor."

"At least very suitable for hunting parrots and sparrows in the fields, stopping them from stealing corn."

"Stop mentioning your corn," Lucrezia stretched, indifferent to her alluring breasts trembling over the splashing water. "I've already written to the steward on the estate. Except for the fields planting cloves and nutmeg, plant half the other land with corn and the other half with sweet potatoes. As for developing new sugarcane plantations, I've also instructed them to prepare. I don't care about Ciarlo's armor; it's nothing but a decoration now. Don't think about that now."

"Did you buy the goods I asked you in the letter to purchase in Macau?"

"Don't mention the Australian goods you wanted—most are out of stock. Except for rice vermicelli and strong liquor bought in full, only one-third of the soap quantity was purchased. Other things are even further off."

"What about those instruments?"

"Only a part. Some they wouldn't sell. But my servants are very persuasive—they got hold of them."

"You are truly my lucky star."

"Save your sweet flattery—I really don't understand, what do you want these weird things for? And buying so much rice noodles, does Philippine rice not fill your men's bellies?"

"Of course, it is to serve His Majesty the King and His Excellency the Governor."

A look of disapproval appeared on the Baroness's face. As a Portuguese noblewoman, she had no reverence for the Spanish-Portuguese King. Not to mention the hostility of competition between merchants of the two countries in Southeast Asia.

"Only this way can I better serve the Baroness," Hale said, kissing her naked shoulder.

The widow smiled charmingly, whispering, "You are truly a devil." She said, "Tell me, who can win the duel? Vannanova or Sanabria, who do you favor more?"

"Is this a bet?" Hale put down the pistol and bullets, closed the wooden box, revealing a smile rarely seen by others. "What's the stake?"

"One gold coin," Lucrezia responded casually, her voice suddenly turning cold: "I bet the Count kills that liar, because he deserves to die. From Goa to Macau, people everywhere tell me Sanabria cheated them of their wealth with forged promissory notes from the Seville Chamber of Commerce and invalid Genoese bonds. My father's friends in Lisbon have filed charges in Madrid, but the result certainly won't be as they wish."

Lucrezia didn't further explain the reason for her worry, just as few knew the true source of her large fortune. It wasn't because her husband received a grant in the Philippines and bought large tracts of land to grow spices; nor because she owned several purchase and sales permits for the Manila Galleons, able to legally ship a batch of Oriental goods to Acapulco annually for sale. In fact, relying on her Portuguese origin and relationship with the Jesuits, the Santa Casa de Misericordia she presided over in Manila received widespread support from Portuguese merchants in the Far East; moreover, her lending interest was relatively low. In just a few years, she attracted business from many local Spanish merchants and converted East Indian maritime merchants. This naturally sparked jealousy and dissatisfaction from other charitable fund groups in Manila, especially the local earliest charitable fund group "Misericordia Brotherhood," and Sanabria was the only non-clerical director of this group. Don Esteban Sanabria had done quite a bit behind the scenes to snatch business from the Baroness.

"Bet a pistole?" Hale took a gold coin from his bosom and placed it in Lucrezia's hand. With just one glance, she noticed the difference in this coin: size, weight, and texture were no different from other pistoles; the material was indeed gold. But its shape was surprisingly regular, edges smooth without the burrs common in minted coins. Both front and back of the gold coin were smoother and more fluid than ordinary coins, and even the patterns were unusually clear.

"Too exquisite! You made this?"

"Cast a few blanks from the first batch of placer gold sent from Baguio. Following Lord Governor's instructions, I made a few for him in the workshop using the rolling mill and screw press for making brass parts. The German watchmaker working for me spent a week engraving the die. Coincidentally, just yesterday His Highness the Governor personally ran to the workshop to supervise this work. He was greatly surprised to see our machine forge 20 coins in the time it took Mexican minting craftsmen to cast one."

"Lord Governor plans to open a mint, in Manila? Will the King and the Council of the Indies agree?" The Baroness tossed aside the pistole gold coin, picked a bottle of rose oil from a pile of large and small bottles on the low table, and signaled Hale to apply it to her neck and shoulders.

"My dear protector," he obeyed, whispering in her ear at the same time: "This plan relies on you and your friends to push. You will silence those hindering colonial judges and officials. I assure you, not only the Governor, but even Archbishop Lorenzo approves of this plan. Whether His Majesty the King, the Council of the Indies, or the Viceroy of New Spain, all would establish be happy to see the good thing of no longer needing to send financial subsidies to the Philippines."

Due to a lack of coinage material and Spanish indolence, the Philippine colony had no mint. The currency needed by the colony—precious metal currency came from New Spain, base metal currency was supplied by Chinese merchants. Lack of products and having no currency of its own made the Manila colonial authorities economically "exploited"—silver coins from New Spain flowed into Chinese merchants' pockets after just passing through hands, while the Philippines remained in a state of deflation.

"The mood of the King of Spain and his finance ministers has nothing to do with me..."

"It will if you are the mint contractor."

"You're crazy. Such a benefit won't fall into my hands—"

"I guarantee you will obtain the Governor's authorization—think about the profits involved. If you can undertake it, we haven't even calculated the benefits from other aspects." His fingers slid over delicate skin.

The rich widow let out low pants. The difference between face value and intrinsic value was a huge profit; this was a temptation the Baroness couldn't resist.

"How much money do I have to put up to invest in this enterprise?"

According to the traditional practice of many countries in medieval society, the state paid no expenses for minting, adopting an "all-inclusive" model. The contractor only needed to deliver currency of sufficient purity and quantity according to the contract; the rest was their own profit or loss. Becoming a mint contractor required shelling out a large amount of startup capital, including building houses, buying equipment, hiring workers, purchasing coinage material and fuel, etc.

"Twelve thousand pesos, not counting coinage material."

"Really not cheap." The Baroness fell into deep thought. Although this amount was within her capacity, raising such a large sum of cash in the short term would require some maneuvering. Organizing the Baguio Company to search for and mine gold earlier, she was one of the major shareholders. Exploration and mining cost a large amount of money, leaving the Baroness's finances somewhat stretched.

The Baroness was always Hale's biggest financial backer. It was precisely thanks to this generous widow, rich in passion and wealth, that his enterprise could advance so smoothly: even after becoming a legendary figure in the colony, his proposed Baguio exploration plan still met with skepticism—except for the Governor providing a small squad of soldiers and two ships on condition of receiving one-fifth of the profits, all of Manila sneered at his plan as "whimsical." The adventure succeeded entirely thanks to the Baroness's funding.

"If everything goes smoothly, you will recover your entire investment in the first year."

"What about for the Governor and his friends?"

"All included."

"You are truly a devil," the Lady's voice was full of affection. "Do you know how much money I've spent for you since you came to Manila? You wanted me to invest in building water mills, then sugar presses, then mining gold, now you want me to plant corn and sweet potatoes, and act as a mint contractor..."

"Every time it was value for money, wasn't it?"

Hale's fingers were rough but dexterous. His forceful massage and kneading left flushed marks on the Baroness's fair skin. As his hands moved over her shoulders and went deeper downwards, Lucrezia's breathing became heavier and heavier. "What else?" She struggled to keep her mind clear.

"There is a second thing. Please introduce me to Count Vannanova. I wish to meet him, if he survives the duel—I am quite confident about this point. As for the third thing, that is—" Hale suddenly bent down and scooped the hostess out of the bathtub. Lucrezia gave a moan-like soft cry, hooked her arms tightly around the man's neck, letting him carry her toward the large bed at the other end of the bedroom.
