# Chapter 1430 - The Making of the Observation Post

"The Type 854 and 901 ships, as well as the underwater hull of the H-800, lack longitudinal anti-torpedo bulkheads and anti-torpedo belts. Even a detonation of a few dozen kilograms of black powder against the wooden hull would be disastrous."

"Do we have to consider mine defense for all subsequent models?"

"It's not impossible..."

"If you ask me, all-ironclad ships are the future direction of naval construction. It's already been proven that wooden-hulled warships are not unchallengeable in this time-space."

...

Wu De coughed. "Let's not discuss subsequent plans based on unconfirmed matters."

"I think, Xiao Jiang, you're overestimating the risk of this Paul spreading military technology to all of Europe. It's a bit like worrying the sky is falling. After all, we are the only ones who possess systematic industrial power. No matter how much he jumps around, he can't turn the sky upside down," Wen Desi said after listening to Jiang Shan's report. "However, under his influence, the Spanish are strengthening the defense of the Philippines, and intelligence on their maritime power should be monitored. do you have further information indicating how far the Spanish authorities can take Paul's armament plan? For example, after Operation Hunger is implemented, will the Manila government still have enough silver to pay for upgrading weapons and building fortresses?"

"The operation to rob the silver galleons had a considerable impact, but the substantive blow to the rulers of the Philippines was not as great as imagined." Jiang Shan looked at the stack of materials in his hand, mostly reports written by Vince, with some from the Portuguese in Macao.

"The tobacco monopoly forcibly promulgated by the Governor, plus the collection of gambling taxes and the leasing of land to the Chinese, have raked in quite a bit of revenue for the colonial government. In addition, they have conquered more natives than in history and attracted more Chinese immigrants. So now the colonial government's revenue from tributes and poll taxes has increased significantly compared to the past. And there's another interesting point: Manila's demand for a commodity usually imported from China—mercury—has greatly increased."

He dug out a telegraph form: "Three weeks ago, a Portuguese merchant ship from Macao unloaded 119 jars of mercury in Manila, each jar about two gallons. The Governor ordered a group of convicts sent to Palawan to mine mercury, even postponing plans to garrison troops and build a castle in Zamboanga for this purpose. Despite this, he continues to write letters requesting more mercury be shipped to Manila from Peru."

"Judging from the large imports of mercury and the start of local mercury mining, obviously they aren't doing it to make mercury fulminate—you don't need that much for fulminate. They must intend to use the amalgamation process to extract gold and silver. You must remember the report mentioned a recent grand celebration in Manila to celebrate the victory over the Ilocano rebels." Noticing Chairman Wen nodding slightly, Jiang Shan continued: "In fact, the area conquered by the colonial army includes Baguio, the most important gold-producing area in the Philippines. The Spanish have long known that rock gold and placer gold are produced there..."

"Proving his worth with other people's money bags—he really is clever." Chairman Wen seemed to be talking to himself. "Where is the *Haiqi*—the *Esmeralda*—now?"

"It is undergoing routine maintenance at the Bopu Naval Shipyard. After the overhaul is complete, it will return to Manila. Taking a batch of new cargo with it."

"I personally support the Navy providing support for the Intelligence Bureau's field operations, as long as it is within the Navy's capabilities," Wen Desi rose from behind the conference table, and Jiang Shan knew this signaled the end of the meeting. "That Japanese fellow who can build semi-submersible spar torpedo boats is also a bit interesting. Quite intriguing."

Shrek tiptoed across the garden path. Ever since he had received several doses of his master's "tough love" for trampling the flowerbeds, he had begun to imitate Mimi's light-footed gait. To onlookers, it looked like a mule trying to catwalk. Early in the morning, bursts of gunfire suddenly rang out behind the villa, greatly disturbing Shrek in his concentration on the art of tiptoeing. He was so frightened he nearly pitched headfirst onto the steps.

The newly built carriage house occupied the east wall of the villa courtyard. The original stables behind the house had been converted into a shooting range on the Count's orders, and a veranda with a pergola had been added to the outside. Shrek now stood before the steps of the shooting house. The intoxicating aroma of sweet wine and the terrible smell of gunpowder smoke mingled and drifted in the early morning air. A life-and-death question spun ceaselessly in his dull brain—should he go up? The master was up there, dressed like some uninhibited sea captain, his white silk shirt collar open, breeches bound tightly at the waist with a water buffalo leather belt, holding a wine glass in one hand and a wheel-lock pistol in the other, chatting and laughing with the mayor and his wife and a group of officials. The doors were wide open, and Shrek could see the crooked, headless, and legless wooden figures inside the shooting house. He didn't know why the Count used these Tagalog handicrafts as targets, but his dull brain thought: if he displeased the master now, he might very well end up like that pile of broken puppets on the floor.

"No, my dear Sebastián, Lord Fananovoua is right," Captain Pilar shouted, legs propped up on the coffee table, a discharged wheel-lock pistol resting on his knee. He had drunk quite a bit and spoke loudly in his drunkenness: "I'm not saying the liver isn't important to a man. I've killed many enemies with my own hands, and many have died before my eyes. No, don't think I'm talking about niggers and heathen savages. Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Saxons, Englishmen, even Spaniards are all the same. If the liver is pierced by a pike or shot through by a bullet, it's agonizing, but not immediately fatal. Some people look dead, but they've just fainted from the pain. To end a man's life and suffering, the fastest and most merciful way, as the Count says, is to put a lead ball through the heart, or relieve him of the heavy burden on his shoulders with a steel blade."

"But Aristotle—" Sebastián de Andrade wanted to continue.

"Drop your Aristotle, give up your scholastic philosophy," Pilar drained a large glass of sherry brandy in one gulp. "Seeing is believing. Let me tell you about natural philosophy. Five years ago I fought a duel with a friend—yes, that Catalan once had my friendship. I ran him through the liver. The fellow shook all over with pain, but he didn't fall and he didn't die. Instead, he struck back and wounded my arm. He was carried home and took a week to die, and I was exiled here. What? You don't believe me, but you believe some Aristotle? Let facts resolve your doubts. The Count has plenty of swords and pistols here."

Vince Lando summoned a local maidservant and whispered instructions to refill the captain's glass, intending to confiscate all the guns once he was completely drunk. These gatherings involving guns and swords were popular with the officers, but if things went wrong, there could be an accident. Although the villa was a small arsenal—besides modern weapons, it was stocked with Lingao-produced rifles, Navy 12-gauge shotguns, and custom-made .45 caliber new-model revolvers—he only ever brought out wheel-lock guns to entertain guests.

The mayor and his wife sat on the veranda. Vince noticed that Señora Isabella was already showing a trace of impatience. He was about to order the servants to fetch some iced soda water when he turned and saw his black slave standing bewildered at the foot of the steps.

"What's the matter?"

"Um—uh," Shrek finally remembered what he was supposed to say: "Miss Mimi asks you to go to the kitchen to look, because the ca—um, the cake is burnt—"

"Mimi," Alfonso teased Vince. "Is that the name of a young lady or a cat?"

"I'll bet an escudo it's a pretty little pussycat."

"And one that makes its nest in the Count's bed every night."

"Ladies and gentlemen, please excuse me for a moment," Vince waved his hand in response to the laughter. "I'll be right back. The servants here really don't give one any peace of mind."

"I heard that His Lordship the Count possesses a kind of repeating pistol with a wheel. If you would honor us, I would like—" The mayor didn't finish his request; his wife cut him off.

"My dear, I think we have seen enough shooting performances and heard enough terrible talk of blood and gore," Señora Isabella cast a bored look at her husband, then extended a hand toward the Count. Her lace-trimmed sleeve slipped down her shoulder, revealing a plump, white arm. "Many say your rooms are built entirely of Chinese porcelain. Would you honor a poor woman's curiosity?" Vince saw a look of resignation on the mayor's face. He began to display his trademark smile.

"You probably mean the bathroom. I'm afraid curiosity aroused by overly exaggerated rumors will lead to great disappointment," Vince gently took those pudgy fingers. "Please follow me."

"Find someone to go to the bathroom and help that Iberian stupid cow use the flush toilet. Watch her, don't let her wander around," Vince said to Mimi. "Now tell me, what's happening?"

"The observation post spotted the Spanish transporting cannons to Fort San Antonio."

Most of the detached buildings built by Spaniards in the colony had towers. The villa's tower had been raised by a story during the renovation. In the best weather, the observation post could even see ships entering and leaving Cavite harbor. The Special Reconnaissance Team was divided into two groups, rotating guard duty up there. Vince first saw a team member with his back to him, observing with binoculars. Another sat near the observation window, which was piled with sandbags to support the scoped Mosin-Nagant rifle in his hands.

The observation post monitored the surroundings 24 hours a day, night being no exception—they were equipped with night-vision gear that could be turned on in an emergency. With this team on duty, Lord Lando slept much more soundly at night.
