# Chapter 1669 - Xiong-style Pacification

Chang Qingyun gave a bitter laugh: "Bright people don't speak dark words. Last night, the Governor-General's Yamen received news from Gaoyao County saying that this Squad Leader named Cao took dozens of men to cause trouble outside the city and even got involved with the Jinyiwei. Lord Xiong, fearing that a stalemate between the two sides would look bad on his face, called me to rush over to be a mediator. Before I even reached the dock, I heard the sound of repeating guns (*lian fa chong*), followed by that group of soldier ruffians fleeing back into the city like scattered ducks. My heart was instantly clear as snow—having escaped with my life from amidst ten thousand armies back then, that sound of repeating guns is all too familiar. In all the territory of Liang-Guang, the only ones who can so easily dispatch dozens of soldiers with the power of a single boat are the Chiefs."

Suo Pu nodded. Establishing friendship while praising the other side—it seemed this Chang Qingyun didn't waste his time in the Lingao POW camp.

"I immediately reported back to Lord Xiong, saying that Jinyiwei Centurion Lin's party was numerous and highly skilled in martial arts, and had already dealt with those dozens of hillbilly soldiers. However, the one surnamed Cao is not a kind soul either. He likely has men and horses waiting on both upstream and downstream routes, probably unwilling to let it go. Therefore, Lord Xiong sent me early this morning. Either please raise your noble hands and yield that woman to Squad Leader Cao—Lord Xiong is willing to send five hundred taels of silver here; or please endure a little, change your appearance, and I will send someone to take you via mountain paths back to the provincial capital, letting the empty boat return." Finishing, Chang Qingyun laughed at himself, "But I fear the Chief won't agree to either of these two conditions."

Suo Pu laughed: "Since you know there are repeating guns, mention no more of handing over people or fleeing."

He asked again: "Do you know who that woman is?"

"Student does not know."

"She was formerly the secondary wife of Guangdong Inspecting Censor Gao Shunqin," Suo Pu said. "Speaking of which, she counts as your kind. Fallen to such a state, even if not saving her from fire and water, pushing her back into the fire pit would be unjustifiable."

Chang Qingyun said: "She is but a mere woman, and a concubine at that."

Suo Pu secretly despised him in his heart. Chang Qingyun looked up at him: "Squad Leader Cao is actually a small matter. Forgive this lowly person for being bold—with the Chief's status, coming to Zhaoqing in person, I fear Zhaoqing, and even Liang-Guang, are about to suffer an undeserved military disaster."

With a "shua" sound, Lin Ming immediately drew his Xiuchun sword, blocking the cabin exit. Xie Peng also drew his revolver.

Chang Qingyun didn't look back: "Chief, although student doesn't understand military affairs, I also know Zhaoqing cannot withstand a single blow from the Great Song army. However, as a person awaiting punishment for military defeat, yet receiving deep grace from Lord Xiong, I truly have no way to repay. If Centurion Lin fulfills it, dying here today can be counted as being loyal to Lord Xiong. Only for the living souls of Liang-Guang, I wish to offer one word. If the Chief can listen before disposing of me, student will die without regret."

"Speak," Suo Pu said. "You know the policy."

"Yes." Chang Qingyun seemed to return to the days of shaving his head, wearing rough cloth, and being called "9763." "Lord Xiong has long admired..." He seemed to be weighing words, "the demeanor of all Chiefs—"

"What? Old Xiong wants to invite us to dinner?" Kang Mingsi cut in and asked.

Suo Pu laughed: "Old Xiong's guest has already been treated just now. Don't stutter, speak. What message does Old Xiong want you to pass?"

Chang Qingyun calmed down, his speech becoming fluent: "Lord Xiong has long praised everything in Lingao, calling all of you 'virtuous and benevolent' gentlemen, absolutely not ordinary merchants..."

Hearing this, Suo Pu thought, this means recruitment (*zhao an*). He listened patiently.

"...All of you are descendants of Hua-Xia, of the Yan and Huang lineage. Sailing iron ships breaking through ten thousand miles of waves to return to the motherland, all are loyal and commendable men. If you can rest weapons and serve the court, naturally the future will be like brocade..."

So Chang Qingyun indeed brought a message of recruitment! Suo Pu thought, this wasn't surprisingly fresh. Xiong Wencai made his career by recruiting "giant bandits." As the biggest "sea bandits" in Liang-Guang, it was impossible for him not to think about this.

Originally planning to do it slowly after reorganizing Liang-Guang's military affairs, yesterday's conflict at the dock forced his plan to be advanced. True Kun were not rare in Guangzhou; several frequented official and commercial circles openly in the city. However, this was Zhaoqing, a military strategic location for Liang-Guang. True Kun penetrating deep here from thousands of miles away—their intentions need not be said.

Xiong Wencai had limited ability but self-knowledge. Back then he couldn't pacify Zheng Zhilong with the power of Fujian province alone, let alone the Kun thieves occupying Hainan, who were ten times stronger than Zheng Zhilong!

The matter of Kun thieves couldn't be covered up forever. Now with Eastern Barbarians and roving bandits making trouble, the court was too beleaguered to care about Hainan. If wait until the court recovered, there must be an explanation.

Xiong Wencai knew deeply that the current court was thoroughly rotten. The Emperor wanted to strive for good governance but had no strength to use—or rather, used it in the wrong place. He deeply knew the way of being an official, knowing that to continue mixing in officialdom, he absolutely couldn't follow the Emperor to "strive for good governance," which would only make things worse. Moreover, national affairs were difficult, the Emperor was eager for success and impatient. If there was a slip, he was not a monarch with tolerance...

Only try to whitewash: as long as no trouble occurred during his term, he could be an official peacefully.

Zheng Zhilong's destruction was a big blow to him. Although he held an attitude of "using bandits to attack bandits" towards Zheng Zhilong's group, Zheng was very diligent in suppressing other pirates after being pacified. Both sides achieved a "win-win." Xiong Wencai's promotion to Liang-Guang owed much to Zheng Zhilong's "performance."

Zheng Zhilong's destruction also announced that the Kun thieves became the biggest "giant bandit" on the southeast coast, completely bankrupting Xiong Wencai's strategy of "using bandits to control bandits" and letting sea lords of Fujian and Guangdong restrain each other. As rising stars, the Kun thieves not only easily destroyed Zheng Zhilong's main force but also forced the surrender of Liu Xiang's men. Originally Xiong Wencai almost reached a recruitment agreement with Liu Xiang, but it was ruined by the Kun thieves' fleet conducting several armed parades in Chaoshan.

Thus, the biggest maritime power in Liang-Guang, the Kun thieves, became the object of Governor Xiong's greatest concern. He had learned a lot about Hainan from merchants who had been to Lingao and had sent spies, with results both joyful and worrying.

The worry was that the Kun thieves in Hainan were already like an enemy state, openly claiming to be Great Song, levying taxes and training troops unscrupulously. The court's yamen officials were just decorations. The most critical point was that the huge appetite displayed by the Australians scared him a bit.

The so-called huge appetite was not "becoming Emperor"—this kind of slogan was not worth mentioning. In famine years, a few hundred poor peasants holding hoes to rebel, shouting "Emperor take turns, next year to my house" was common, no one took it seriously.

The problem was this group of Australians had the strength but were not in a hurry to do so. According to Xiong Wencai's experience, a team that could pull up thousands of men and take down a few county cities, the leader would definitely claim to be King if not Emperor immediately. However, the Kun thieves obviously had tens of thousands of men and the premier large fleet on the southeast coast, yet did nothing, even letting the court's officials hang around in the yamen—this made Xiong Wencai hesitate: This "build walls high, store grain widely, claim King slowly" was the tenet of the dynasty's Founder when he rose.

The joy was that although the Kun thieves occupied Hainan and formed a partition, taxes were still paid, and court decrees could still be transmitted, indicating the Kun thieves had no intention of independence and rebellion yet, so recruitment was still possible.

If the Kun thieves could be recruited, for the beleaguered court, it would remove a great trouble—Guangdong as one of the few remaining revenue sources for the court couldn't afford tossing about. Being able to pacify the locality would be a great merit.

Naturally, with Xiong Wencai's insight, he was very clear that this group of Kun thieves were absolutely not pond things, absolutely not something high positions and fat salaries could cage. Sooner or later they would raise the flag to rebel—but that would be at least a few years later. By then he might not be presiding over Liang-Guang military affairs in Zhaoqing anymore.

So he decided to recruit this group of "giant bandits" at all costs this time, in exchange for temporary peace. As for the future, discuss the future when it comes.

The recruitment conditions proposed by Chang Qingyun were extremely generous: Just accept recruitment, the court would establish a Deputy Commander position in Qiongshan, Hainan. Appointing Wen Desi or Ma Qianzhu as Deputy Commander. If they were unwilling, other True Kun could be appointed; Guangdong government would issue a one-time reward of thirty thousand taels of silver to the Fubo Army; one thousand men from Fubo Army could be listed as official troops, with monthly pay from the court; Australians could continue to station in Hainan. Except for paying taxes, appointing local officials, and postal transmission, the government would not interfere with anything else. As for Australians entering and leaving Guangzhou, they could do as they pleased.

Suo Pu thought, good guy, this is equivalent to full recognition of the status quo! Considered completely passing the public road. He knew very well that a few years ago, these conditions might have been negotiable. But now Hainan Island for the Senate was like clothes too small for a growing teenager. Many innate bottlenecks of Hainan in developing industry began to be exposed. The Senate already held an attitude of inevitably gaining Guangdong. Under this situation, probably no one would discuss recruitment issues.

Suo Pu shook his head slightly: "Although I cannot decide this matter alone, I'm afraid the Senate can only appreciate Lord Xiong's kindness."

Chang Qingyun had been to Lingao and was not surprised by this result. But Suo Pu's statement made his heart sink, trembling: "So, the Senate intends to..."

Suo Pu nodded: "Since Lord Xiong throws me a papaya, we naturally return with a jade. Please tell Lord Xiong for me: Liang-Guang is not only hot but also full of miasma, not a place for peaceful officialdom. Moreover, heard that Guangdong's astronomical phenomena are strange this year, fearing a heavy snow and severe cold not met in a hundred years. We pray that the Lord can be safe in everything and be promoted."

Chang Qingyun nodded: "Student understands. Many thanks to all Chiefs for kindness."
