# Chapter 1666 - Piyun Tower Banquet

"Yes, yes... Master Cao..." The wounded soldier stammered, "Our Squad Leader..."

"What's his name?"

"Cao Bajiao..."

"How did he know about Su Ai?"

"That... this lowly one... doesn't know... I just listened to his orders."

"Besides here, what other arrangements are there?"

"Heard... heard that Master Cao has set up a few boats downstream, and invited brothers from the naval forces."

"What about upstream?"

"Also... also have... men and horses prepared."

"Where is Cao Bajiao now?"

"That, this lowly one doesn't know..."

Suo Pu nodded. A team member raised his blade and finished him off cleanly. Several men spread out to check the surroundings, ensuring no one was left breathing, then threw all the bodies into the river. Apart from the bloodstains on the ground, nothing remained on the dock.

Although such a commotion had occurred at the dock, not a single person came to inquire throughout the entire night. Only when dawn broke and the city gates opened did a troop of soldiers march out from the city, escorting the Gaoyao County Magistrate to personally investigate. A criminal law secretary was sent aboard the boat to question them.

The county's criminal law secretary was an experienced hand. Before leaving the city, he had already gathered information. He roughly knew about "a flash of fire from the official boat," "crackling like beans without ceasing," "sweeping away all resistance"... He knew this matter involved passing Jinyiwei, was related to local soldiers, and the firearms that instantly killed a dozen people seemed connected to the legendary Australians. Added together, it was "unfathomable."

Whether it was the Gaoyao County Magistrate, the Zhaoqing Prefect, or the Governor-General of Liang-Guang sitting in his yamen, clearly none wished to wade into this muddy water. With this tone set, the criminal law secretary naturally knew what to do.

Procedural matters were handled meticulously as usual. Since there were no bodies, there was no need for an autopsy. Where the bandits attempting to rob the dock came from was naturally "unknown." The merchants and coolies on the dock would not be keen to serve as "witnesses" and suffer for a few days in the yamen, so they all claimed: "Was sleeping, didn't see." Lin Ming also insisted: "It was dark, couldn't see clearly." In short, this was an ordinary robbery case of "bandits attacking an official boat at night, repelled by escort guards," involving neither local garrison troops nor the Jinyiwei.

"With blood all over the ground, at least ten people must have died," the Gaoyao County Magistrate thought to himself as he looked at the bloodstains seeping into the soil and stone cracks. "Those soldier ruffians, I wonder if they'll let this go."

The Magistrate had suffered from the soldier ruffians for a long time. The soldiers were tyrannical, killing and robbing, and he could only pretend to be deaf and dumb. Now that they had suffered a great loss, he was secretly pleased.

With the official matters settled, the choice before Suo Pu was whether to continue upstream or go downstream. Continuing upstream meant passing through Dading Gorge, known for its precipitous terrain. That Squad Leader Cao's lair was there, perhaps even in the barracks guarding the gorge entrance! The entire Dading Gorge was 55 kilometers long with complex terrain. Upstream navigation was difficult and slow, requiring trackers. If ambushed by enemies, even with machine guns, safety couldn't be guaranteed. Returning downstream was safer and more appropriate.

But going back meant the original plan to inspect Wuzhou would be ruined. Just as they were discussing, a large red invitation card was suddenly delivered, inviting Lin Ming and the two distinguished guests to a banquet.

"Who sent it?"

"The messenger said they are from the Governor-General's Yamen!"

All three eyelids twitched! With Lin Ming's status, the dignified Governor-General of Liang-Guang would not seek to associate with him, let alone host a banquet.

Could it be that the gunfire last night caught Xiong Wencai's attention?

Opening the card, they saw the host was not Xiong Wencai, but a man named Chang Qingyun, inviting the three of them to a banquet at Piyun Tower.

"I just asked the servant who delivered the letter: he is a private secretary of Lord Xiong, a *Xiaolian* master," Lin Ming said.

Suo Pu felt the name looked familiar. He rubbed his chin for a while but couldn't recall where he'd seen it—probably in some intelligence compilation.

Kang Mingsi asked: "Should we go? Could it be a Hongmen Banquet—a trap?"

Lin Ming said: "Whether to go or not depends on the Chiefs' decision. But it definitely won't be a Hongmen Banquet. I think Lord Xiong probably wants to feel out our background."

Suo Pu smiled and said: "Go, of course we go. This is a great opportunity to inquire about the situation in the Governor-General's Yamen."

If Xiong Wencai really harbored ill intentions to "capture them all in one drum beat," a dignified Governor-General wouldn't need to go to such trouble.

Kang Mingsi said: "I won't go; the boat can't be left unmanned. Let Little Xie accompany you. But Old Lin, your leg is injured..."

Lin Ming quickly said: "It's nothing, just a flesh wound. I'll have someone support me." He then instructed: "Return the card, say we will certainly come to disturb them."

Piyun Tower was a city gate tower. The dock was outside the city, and entry was forbidden after dark, so Chang Qingyun's banquet was at noon. Before ten o'clock, the Governor-General's personal soldiers arrived with three palanquins to welcome them. Suo Pu and Xie Peng changed clothes, carrying pistols at their waists. Four special reconnaissance team members accompanied them, each armed with submachine guns and grenades. If Xiong Wencai had any ideas, they would make a scene at Piyun Tower and kill to their heart's content.

The palanquins patrolled along the city wall. Although they had conducted close-up observations, this was the first time they had inspected so closely along the wall. Suo Pu looked very carefully. The brick facing of the city wall showed signs of repair, and there were no weeds or wild trees, indicating careful maintenance. It seemed the local officials here were diligent about defense.

The palanquins proceeded and entered the North Gate of Zhaoqing Prefecture—Chaotian Gate. As soon as they entered, the palanquins were set down, and a steward-like person came to invite them. Suo Pu got out and saw a three-story tower standing on the wall, with a hip-and-gable roof and cross ridges. The carved rafters pierced the sky and the flying eaves were precipitous—a magnificent sight. On a gold-flecked black plaque, the words "Mainstay in Midstream" (Zhong Liu Di Zhu) were written uprightly in a dragon-flying, phoenix-dancing style. Suo Pu couldn't help praising: "Good calligraphy!"

"The calligraphy isn't bad!" Xie Peng looked closely and smiled to Suo Pu, "But the brushwork is too charming, lacking bone in the stroke. It can't be considered a top-tier work." Suo Pu also nodded: "You're right, the spirit is insufficient." Talking, the two followed the servant up the tower.

Although Piyun Tower was said to be a Song dynasty structure, it had actually been rebuilt several times. Suo Pu knew from the roof style alone that it was not an original Song artifact. Inside, the space was about five bays wide, floored with pine boards. The partitions and carved pillars were of cypress, carved with insects, fish, flowers, birds, clouds, trees, and immortals, as well as various folk tale characters, hollowed out exquisitely. Only due to age, the red lacquer was dusty and the carvings peeling. Touched by countless tourists, the wood was as smooth as if coated with amber.

Inside and outside the tower were the Governor-General's personal soldiers standing guard. Seeing this formation, Suo Pu wondered if Xiong Wencai had come in person?

Looking out from the railing, the West River meandered past, green mountains surrounded the city outskirts—truly a magnificent landscape. While he was sighing with emotion, the steward smiled and said: "Please, masters, ascend the tower."

Ascending to the top, they saw all the partition doors on the four sides were open. Not only was the scenery fully visible, but the breeze blowing also opened one's heart.

In the middle of the floor were three large Eight Immortals tables, already filled with small dishes. In the center was another table displaying sugar lions, sugar figures, and similar "display dishes"—knowing this was the so-called "Lion Immortal Sweets."

A dozen merchant and scholar-looking people were already waiting upstairs. Suo Pu knew Lin Ming's rank was too low for gentry figures to attend. The leader, a middle-aged man about fifty, saw them coming up and immediately welcomed them with a face full of smiles.

"Master Lin! This student Chang Qingyun offers his respects."

Lin Ming and Chang Qingyun did not know each other. With his rank, he couldn't contact governor-level officials daily, so naturally, he wouldn't be familiar with their private secretaries—strictly speaking, he couldn't "climb that high." However, the special status of the Jinyiwei gave them a great sense of superiority, so he didn't feel overwhelmed by the favor. He just bowed back with a smile, saying politely: "Forgive my rudeness, I was attacked by thieves last night and have a leg injury."

"I know, I know. That is why we are borrowing this occasion to welcome Master Lin and calm your nerves. Please, take your seats. And this is...?"

Lin Ming nodded and smiled, saying: "This gentleman comes from Nanjing. Master Chang naturally wouldn't recognize him. He is the grandson of the former Nanjing Jinyiwei Vice Commander Suo Ni, Suo Pu—also serving in the Guard..."

"I dare not accept the honor, Suo Pu." Suo Pu bowed to the crowd and spoke calmly, "I rely on the care of all you friends."

Then he introduced Xie Peng. The identities Lin Ming concocted for them were all Jinyiwei personnel. Since the Jinyiwei was massive, with over sixty thousand members by the late Ming, apart from a few top figures familiar in official circles, no one could be clear about the internal situation.

Everyone scrutinized the group: Suo Pu was dignified and composed, elegant and suave; wearing a half-new blue wide-sleeved scholar's robe, washed spotless. He wore a Three Mountains hat and a pair of half-worn thousand-layer soled cloth shoes. He looked handsomely refined yet heroic. His not-so-large eyes were pitch black, seeming always to carry a smile, yet in a glance, appearing to look down on everything around him.

Chang Qingyun had been a private secretary for many years and had sharp eyes. He saw at a glance that this young man was the leader. However, what unsettled him was that this person's gestures gave him a sense of familiarity, as if he had seen him somewhere before. His heart skipped a beat, and cold sweat broke out on his back, his eyes staring fixedly at Suo Pu.

Suo Pu didn't mind, exchanging greetings and taking his seat. When everyone was seated, Suo Pu and Lin Ming took the chief seats, Chang Qingyun sat as the main host, and the other merchants and scholars sat accompanying them. Suo Pu looked at the table, set with twenty-four small inch-sized official kiln blue-and-white dishes, holding various dried and fresh fruits, filling the table colorfully. He didn't recognize many of the items.

Sure enough, landlords and old money knew how to enjoy life.

"Let the banquet begin."
