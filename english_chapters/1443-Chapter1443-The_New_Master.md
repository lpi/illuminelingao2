# Chapter 1443 - The New Master

Fortunately or unfortunately, her looks were not the Chiefs' cup of tea: although she performed excellently in academic subjects, her short stature and the effects of foot-binding since childhood affected her movements, resulting in extremely poor grades in body shaping dance training and physical education. Her final comprehensive rating was only a bottom-tier E.

After graduating from the Maid School, as her companions with the highest scores were taken away by the Chiefs one by one, she also began to feel anxious.

This anxiety reached its peak when a female Chief appeared accompanying another Chief.

The Chief selected four companions at once, nodded to the female Chief, and went out the door; the female Chief walked up with a sweet smile, but the words she spat out froze Sun Shangxiang to the bone.

"Alright, let's get the unpleasant words out of the way first. My family doesn't practice that 'sisters' stuff, and the Master won't formally take you as concubines; as long as you follow the family rules properly, I will never deliberately mistreat you. If you have children, I will naturally let you give birth to them and raise them in peace. But if anyone harbors thoughts they shouldn't have—"

The female Chief slowed her speech, but everyone could hear the implication.

Seeing one of the maids trembling like a sieve, the female Chief looked at her specifically for a moment longer before turning to lead the four out.

"Ling'er is probably going to be out of luck; the First Wife of the Chief's family is not easy to get along with."

As soon as they left, a group of girls gathered together to whisper.

"Don't talk about her; Yueru too! She dreams of her child becoming a Chief..."

Wonder how those girls are doing now? After class, Sun Shangxiang returned to the dormitory, took a bath, and changed into clean clothes. The whip marks on her skin stung hotly. She applied medicated oil while tears fell drop by drop.

Is there anything more miserable in the world than this? Originally thought being a concubine was inferior; now, she couldn't even be one if she wanted to.

Several girls in the dormitory sat in a circle, discussing one of the topics that would never end in the Maid School: "How to fight the First Wife?"

Sun Shangxiang glanced at them, walked to the window, and stood gazing out.

No scenery outside could be seen from the high walls of the courtyard. However, they were often taken out for "internships" and "visits." To witness the glorious greatness of the Council of Elders' rule.

She didn't deny that Lingao surpassed all her imaginations of heaven; ignoring the future for the moment, just rolling on the bed wrapped in a fluffy cotton quilt was happiness.

But it was precisely this heaven that became the root of their misfortune.

People still in the hell-like Shandong, once they stepped on Lingao, would never want to leave; the same big ships would bring more women willing to serve as maids, until the Australian lords themselves had the will but not the energy.

The Australian lords had too many choices, but she had no choice.

It wasn't that she hadn't thought about redeeming herself, but she dismissed the idea after staying for a month: three meals a day plus occasional nourishing soups and medicines, every day either studying or taking various skill courses... She really didn't dare calculate how much silver the Chiefs would spend on them before they graduated.

She had heard of "Yangzhou Thin Horses" and knew that such girls would eventually be worth over a thousand taels.

A thousand taels was simply an amount only the Emperor could produce for her—even when her father was an official, it took months of effort to send a gift of twelve taels of silver to a superior.

Even stepping back ten thousand paces, if she really raised that money, apart from an Australian lord, who would dare to marry a redeemed "Australian maid" as a primary wife? Wouldn't that be slapping the Chief's face?

If she had to be a concubine anyway, she might as well be an Australian lord's concubine.

Sighing, Sun Shangxiang turned to join her roommates, telling the girls about a few vicious First Wives in her memory. A group of people huddled together, discussing how to "fight the First Wife."

However, before she could finish deducing the "Thirty-Six Stratagems for Fighting the First Wife," she was called away by the "Teaching Assistant."

"Congratulations, Sun Shangxiang!" The assistant said in a tone that was sour and somewhat gloating. "A Chief has chosen you."

In that instant, even without seeing the Chief's face, Sun Shangxiang felt a sense of relief.

Whether stretching the neck or shrinking it, it's a knife either way. No matter how terrible the First Wives were, they weren't those beasts in human skin after all.

She soon learned that there was no First Wife for her to fight; the one who chose her was a single "female Chief."

Changing into the formal life secretary attire—a black dress covered by a white frilled apron, white socks, and black cloth shoes. Her hair was tied behind her head with a ribbon. She didn't know why the Chiefs, who possessed wealth rivaling nations, liked this shabby and rigid outfit. At home, at least during festivals, she had nice silk clothes to wear and a few hairpins and rings to adorn herself.

The rattan suitcase was issued by the school, containing her personal clothing—also issued by the school. Except for her body, she had nothing.

She followed the General Affairs Office clerk who came to collect her, riding a carriage, changing to a train, and finally arriving at Bairen City, entering the heavily guarded Elder residential area.

Inspecting IDs all the way, stop and go, the suitcase getting heavier, her steps starting to stagger.

However, this residential area of the Elders surprised her quite a bit—Elders live here? Pigeon-coop-like buildings?!

No matter how big the questions in her heart, she could only remain silent. This was the first rule the Maid School taught them.

She followed the clerk into one of the buildings, climbed up a dark staircase, stopped in front of a door, and raised a hand to knock.

"Who?"

"Report to Chief, the life secretary has arrived."

"Come in."

Sun Shangxiang was startled as soon as she entered: she had never seen so many books.

Of course, she knew the Chiefs had a place called "Library," where books were said to pile from the floor to the ceiling, filling many rooms. Although the room in front of her wasn't that exaggerated, there was a whole wall full of books.

The Chief's desk was a disaster zone—practically a small hill made of books. Several books were tottering, yet the Chief didn't even look, casually throwing the book in hand on top, walking to the bookshelf to pull out several more for quick browsing.

Sun Shangxiang was simply numb.

She wasn't unshocked by the washroom covered in porcelain tiles, but after the shock came envy; however, in this era of severe book shortage where even copying books required connections, treating books so casually made Sun Shangxiang's hair stand on end.

Those are books, books!

Seeing the Chief casually stacking the books aside and returning to the seat with the rest, the cadre finally found a chance to speak.

"Chief, your secretary is here."

"Leave her. You go back first; thank you for your hard work."

After the clerk left, Sun Shangxiang nervously clutched her backpack, waiting for the Chief's next instruction.

"Go get me a bottle of kombucha."

Sun Shangxiang immediately put down her backpack, found a small refrigerator in the corner of the room, opened a jar of kombucha, and delivered it to the Chief's hand.

The female Chief didn't even give her a second look. After taking the kombucha and gulping down two mouthfuls, she continued writing furiously. Sun Shangxiang tactfully retreated two steps, waiting at the side as taught in her classes.

Waiting was naturally boring, and the smell of paper was an enchanting fragrance to Sun Shangxiang.

Therefore, without struggling for too long, Sun Shangxiang tiptoed and began to tidy up the books scattered by the bookshelf: judging by the Chief's actions, she obviously didn't need these books right now.

Picking up a few books, Sun Shangxiang discovered that every book had a small strip of paper stuck to the spine with Arabic numerals written on it. She studied the books on the shelf for a while, then began to insert the scattered books back in order.

When Sun Shangxiang had organized a shelf of books and clapped her hands in satisfaction, preparing to continue, she turned around to find that the Chief had stopped writing at some point and was sipping kombucha, looking at her with interest.

Sun Shangxiang froze instantly: she even wanted to kneel and kowtow to admit her mistake like in the past.

But the Chiefs didn't like that.

Gritting her teeth, she stammered in non-standard Mandarin:

"Chief... please check... might have placed them wrong... please you..."

The female Chief stood up, swung her ponytail, walked over with large strides, and bent down to scan the numbers on the paper strips.

"It would be even better if you sort the bookshelf next time. What's your name?"

Seeing the Chief adjusting the positions of the books herself, Sun Shangxiang hurriedly answered:

"Sun Shangxiang. 'Shang' as in..."

"Not the Maid School name, your original name."

The female Chief stopped her movements, turned her head to look Sun Shangxiang in the eyes.

"I won't ask you to forget everything you learned in the Maid School. Although I personally have some complaints about those courses, since you can stand here, it means those things are already part of you, and I have no right to negate you."

She sighed, confusing Sun Shangxiang completely.

"Chief?"

"I mean, if your surname was changed or something, and you want to restore your original name and surname, just tell me directly. Although a name is just a form of address, I don't like those otakus casually stuffing fine girls into their delusions—you can't just find a few Ling'ers, Yuerus, or Anus and clear the game with cheats like playing an RPG. This is the real world."

Sun Shangxiang was very sure that although she understood every word the Chief said separately, putting them together was simply no different from a heavenly book.

However, generally speaking, it should mean the Chief didn't quite like this name.

"Please bestow a name, Chief."

"Sigh, that's not what I mean..."

The female Chief smiled bitterly, turned around and walked to the refrigerator herself, taking out two bottles of kvass. She pulled out the corks with a corkscrew.

"Do you know who Sun Shangxiang was?"

Sun Shangxiang accepted the kvass the Chief stuffed into her hand with some trepidation and shook her head at the Chief's question.

"She was the younger sister of the Lord of Wu in Jiangdong during the Three Kingdoms period. She married Lord Xuande as a second wife for the alliance between Wu and Shu; however, she 'always had over a hundred maids holding knives to guard her.' I imagine Lord Xuande's expression every time they met must have been quite spectacular."
