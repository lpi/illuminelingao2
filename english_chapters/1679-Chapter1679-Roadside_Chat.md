# Chapter 1679 - Roadside Chat

Yun Suji made a request: first, prepare to visit a Standard Village. On the map, numerous Standard Villages were distributed in a cross shape along the Nandu River and Chengmai Highway. Yun Suji asked the County Office to introduce a relatively progressive village. The naturalized cadre of the County Office flipped through cards and said Borang Village south of Pingshen Ridge was a Model Village, recommending him to go there.

According to regulations, the County Office should send a messenger to notify the Village Head and the Resident Cadre to come to the county for a meeting and introduce Senator Yun. However, Yun Suji said village cadres were busy with work, and a trip to the city took at least half a day, not worth it. He was used to dealing with farmers in the Tiandihui in Lingao, so he traveled with light luggage and few attendants. He changed his clothes, didn't take a carriage, sat in a sedan chair (huagan), wore straw sandals, took a boat to the edge of the village, and walked in on his own. Four guards also disguised themselves as ordinary farmers, following far behind.

There was still more than a li from the ferry to the village. The road into the village was a dirt road, but it was repaired neatly and compacted smoothly. The road surface had no pits or hollows, and some small trees were planted. Although the trees were thin, they were green and lush, showing that care was taken to maintain them. No wonder the naturalized cadre of the County Office said this was an "Advanced Village."

Yun Suji walked slowly. Not far along, he saw a big tree by the roadside. Under the tree rested an old man with a load beside him, smoking and resting.

Yun Suji had a thought: if he just ran into the village like this, the people he met would inevitably be public officials, speaking polite formulas. He wouldn't hear many useful words. The countryside was an acquaintance society; no one dared to say much to a rash stranger. This old man resting by the roadside must know a lot about Borang Village, whether he was from this village or a neighboring one.

So he took out a cigarette from his pocket and walked up to him: "Old man, borrow a light."

He didn't know where the old man was from, so he spoke New Speech (Mandarin).

"Zhong (Okay)." The old man was very straightforward and handed over his pipe bowl. Yun Suji leaned the cigarette close to the fire to light it and took a drag.

"You look like a cadre; don't you carry an Australian lighter?"

"Left in a hurry, forgot to bring it." Yun Suji heard his accent was Central Plains Mandarin, and felt thirty percent closer. "Old man, are you from Henan?"

"Right, I'm from Henan Prefecture."

Yun Suji knew the so-called Henan Prefecture referred to Luoyang. He sat down beside him and said, "Then we are half fellow villagers. I'm from Dengfeng." He unconsciously added thirty percent Henan accent to his speech.

"You are also from Henan?" The old man sounded a bit closer in his speech indeed. "Where are you going?"

"Over there!"

Yun Suji said, seeing the tobacco in his pipe bowl was used up, took out a cigarette from his pocket: "Here, smoke mine."

The old man waved his hand repeatedly: "That stuff is precious, a pack cost a massive one yuan circulation coupon. I smoke my own leaves..."

Yun Suji suddenly realized there was a problem with his cigarettes. What he carried was Special Supply Holy Ship cigarettes; no naturalized citizen or native smoked this. Fortunately, this old man didn't smoke paper cigarettes, otherwise, he would have noticed something wrong immediately.

"What are you polite for, just smoke." Yun Suji stuffed it into his hand and lit it for him.

The old man took a puff: "Yi, truly not bad! Just the kick is small."

Yun Suji smiled, seeing the other party's guard drop significantly. He took the opportunity to ask: "Old man, are you also from this village?"

"I am from this village." The old man smoked the cigarette, "Went to the fair today, sold goods to exchange for some oil and salt. Looking at your appearance, you are a cadre?"

"I'm from the county, going to Boli Village to handle some business." He deliberately named a neighboring village.

"So you are from the county..." The old man flusteredly wanted to get up.

"Don't be polite, we don't do that stuff." Yun Suji said, "We are fellow villagers meeting fellow villagers, speaking some intimate words. Don't fuss with false etiquette."

"Zhong." The old man nodded repeatedly, looking Yun Suji up and down, "Did you also come from Shandong with the Chiefs the year before last?"

"Me," Yun Suji equivocated, "Long time ago. I came when the Chiefs first arrived in Lingao."

"Then you are an Old Person (Chen Ren)..."

"What Old Person, New Person," Yun Suji laughed, "How is life for you here?"

"That goes without saying, it's heaven and earth compared to the past. Back home, let alone oil and salt, getting some bean dregs to stick on cakes was a good meal."

"How many mu of land does your family have?"

"When registering residence, they allocated me thirty mu. I didn't want a single mu; just asked for one mu of private plot to grow some vegetables. I'm not a crops man." The old man laughed, "Can't do farm work. Back home I ground tofu, wanted to open a tofu shop with my wife, but the cadres in this village forbid it, saying opening a tofu shop in the village is not allowed; have to go to the county for approval. I am a small commoner, how dare I enter the county yamen to speak. I can't speak New Speech fluently; one mistake, get forty strokes first, and these two old legs would be gone..."

"Look at you, the Senate's County Office isn't the Great Ming's County Yamen. If you want to go, just go, what is there to fear?"

"Common people dare not breathe loudly seeing a cadre, let alone dealing with officials in the county. Not opening is fine; anyway, I still have skills, won't starve doing anything."

Yun Suji couldn't figure out why he wasn't allowed to open a tofu shop, thinking the food factory needed tofu. Looking at the stacks wrapped in Chinese iris leaves and tied with straw on his load, and two oil paper baskets tied to the load, he got curious: "What are you selling?"

The old man chuckled: "It's pancakes (Jianbing). There are construction sites everywhere in the county, and laborers selling strength are everywhere. My pancakes smell good and are filling. In the oil paper baskets is watermelon sauce my wife made this year. Took them to sell together. More than a hundred catties of pancakes, two baskets of watermelon sauce, sold out in half an hour."

"You know how to make pancakes too?" Yun Suji was surprised. Henan people love wheat food, especially steamed buns (Mantou), but he hadn't heard of them making pancakes themselves.

"I didn't know how. But this village is full of Shandong people; I learned by watching, what's rare about that? Pushing millstones and mixing batter are things I'm used to; what I make is only better than theirs." The old man smoked, "The weather here is warm, things to eat are all over the ground. Even gardening is easier than in Henan! Grind everything together and mix it; tasty and saves grain. Laborers get a full belly, I make some money—my son hasn't taken a wife yet."

Yun Suji smiled: "You have a son? Why doesn't he come out to do small business with you?"

The old man smoked the cigarette butt until it almost burned his hand before reluctantly throwing it away, saying: "Raised four sons, three daughters. Arrived here with only the youngest son left, just sixteen—his sister died only after reaching Hainan, ruined. Otherwise, marrying her out could have swapped a daughter-in-law back. If I knew earlier, I would have picked up a little girl on the road while fleeing and brought her along... The bride price here is too expensive."

Yun Suji saw he spoke lightly, but the skin carved like a knife and the dark face told the hardships of the journey. He heard him continue, "Son is an apprentice in the brick and tile factory, getting wages. Becoming a worker made his heart wild; let alone coming home, doesn't even send a message. His mother is worried; heard accidents happen often in the factory killing people..."

"You are not worried?"

"What's the use of worrying." The old man picked up his pipe bowl. Yun Suji handed him another cigarette, and this time he didn't decline, lighting it directly. "Life and death are fated. Fleeing for life from home, who could have thought to come here to live a peaceful life?" He sighed, "How many people kicked their legs on the road and fed wild dogs? Being alive to live peaceful days is earning profit, don't you say?"

"Yes, yes." Yun Suji nodded. Thinking it's no wonder they are satisfied with small wealth: people who have circled before the gates of hell and seen too many separations of life and death easily adopt an attitude of enjoying wine today while drunk. He asked about the village situation again, how the land was farmed, whether grain was sufficient.

"I don't understand farming matters. Looks like it's farmed well, better than back home. Grain is enough to eat. Families with many children and weak labor lack grain, but eating more pumpkin gets them through. Haven't heard of anyone unable to open the pot. Just too much corvée labor; can't catch a breath..."

Just as they were talking, a young man came running from the village side. He was in his early twenties, with thick eyebrows and big eyes, not tall, but looked fierce and energetic. Wearing a blue cloth double-breasted cadre suit. Seeing him running over, the old man flusteredly got up and threw the cigarette butt aside, trying to dodge, but was caught by the young man.

"Good you Old Man Meng, don't think I dare not manage you because you rely on your old age! Called you to go to the construction site to prepare the advance station, you dodged and didn't go, saying you were going to the county town to see your son! Turned out going for small business." Saying so, he raised his hand and punched, knocking Old Meng four feet to the sky, then kicked him again, knocking the load over. The pancakes wrapped in iris leaves rolled all over the ground, and the two baskets also overturned.

Yun Suji seeing he wanted to kick the baskets again, quickly stopped him: "Speak properly if you have something to say, why hit people? These are all food, can't simulate waste casually!"

Seeing a Cheng Yaojin (unexpected interrupter) burst out halfway, looking like a cadre too, the young man's voice and expression softened slightly: "Who are you?"

"I am from the county, coming to do business nearby."

"Since you are from the county, you should know the county just issued a notice to strengthen winter water conservancy construction support, mobilizing strong labor from over a dozen villages here to the site. Latecomers get no good fruit to eat! He is an old man, I don't expect him to work hard, just go to the advance station to cook should be fine, but he just lies and shirks!"

Yun Suji understood. Just as he was about to mediate a few words, the young man shouted at Old Meng again: "You better carry your load back to the village to prepare early. Go to the construction site to prepare the advance station for me today, or tomorrow I'll ask the militia to tie you to the labor reform team to dig sand!"

Old Meng dared not speak, packed up his load, and went towards the village. The young cadre followed behind. Yun Suji thought Qiongshan didn't have a prison at all; where did a "labor reform team" come from out of thin air? Fei Si said some cadres beat and arrested people at will; it seemed to be true.
