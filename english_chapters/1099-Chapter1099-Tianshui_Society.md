# Chapter 1099 - Tianshui Society

"You mean you want us to rope in the Donglin Party?" Li Yan said with interest.

"Correct," Yu E'shui nodded. "Strictly speaking, the Fushe."

"The Fushe controls the public opinion of the *Qingliu*. As long as they stop large-scale attacks on Sun Yuanhua, Sun Yuanhua's political life will be saved. Is that what you mean?"

"That's exactly what I mean," Yu E'shui said. "Although the speech officials are not controlled by the Donglin, the Fushe's reputation as *Qingliu* already carries great momentum in the court and the public. Before his death, Zhang Pu implicitly had the ability to sway public opinion in the court and the public. The power of this *Qingliu* cannot be underestimated."

"But, can the Fushe help with this?" Wang Ding held a skeptical attitude. What they were doing now, to put it plainly, was like what lobbyist groups did in the United States, and the Fushe was equivalent to a powerful political party.

In the end, for lobbying to be successful, one had to explain the pros and cons earnestly, and the other was to have an exchange of interests.

Wang Ding felt that from the perspective of pros and cons, it was hard to say whether the Fushe would stick its neck out to help Sun Yuanhua just to protect Zhou Yanru—after all, Sun Yuanhua and Xu Guangqi were not of the Donglin lineage. Sun's downfall would be a huge blow to Zhou Yanru, but whether Zhou Yanru's downfall would cause a serious blow to the Donglin, the Donglin and Fushe might not necessarily form a unified view internally.

From the perspective of interest exchange, the Senate couldn't bring out any interests to exchange with the Fushe. What the Fushe cared about most was grasping power in the court and locally; for this, the Fushe didn't hesitate to make pre-arrangements in the examination halls to obtain academic degrees for their own people. In comparison, the Senate's current influence on the court was pitifully small—unless they went to war.

"No, the possibility of the Fushe saving Zhou Yanru is very high!" Jiang Shan said. "Wen Tiren is the sworn enemy of the Donglin. If Zhou Yanru is driven away, the Fushe loses all its influence in the Cabinet and the central government—this would be a disaster for the Fushe, which pursues the rejuvenation of the Great Ming and the renewal of court administration."

Historically, after Wen Tiren drove away Zhou Yanru and became the Senior Grand Secretary, the Donglin's power in the court suffered a heavy blow. Not only did Wen Tiren oppose the Donglin everywhere, but the Eunuch Faction, which had been designated as the "Case of Rebellious Faction," also constantly counterattacked. To reverse this decline, the Fushe did not hesitate to exert full efforts seven years later to help Zhou Yanru come back and enter the Grand Secretariat again.

It can be seen that Zhou Yanru was the Donglin's main ally in the central government. Especially since Zhou Yanru made great "contributions" to the Fushe in the metropolitan examination of 1631, Zhang Pu would not fail to understand the value of a benevolent Senior Grand Secretary. Jiang Shan believed that as long as the pros and cons were explained to Zhang Pu and others, it was possible for both sides to cooperate.

Li Yan said, "This task can be given to Zhao Yingong to handle—he has already established friendships with some key members of the Fushe in Hangzhou. He can totally use these relationships to approach Zhang Pu and carry out the persuasion work."

"Wouldn't it be strange for him to come forward? What's the motive?"

"Don't forget Zhao Yingong is also a core member of the Hangzhou Church. Sun Yuanhua is a Catholic. Helping out of religious fellowship is suitable both emotionally and rationally."

"Send a telegram to Hangzhou immediately."

***

Hangzhou in the first lunar month, due to the Little Ice Age, saw not only most small rivers freezing but also thin ice on the West Lake.

Although the weather was cold, the streets were still lively. After the fifth day of the New Year, all the shops had opened, but families with overnight grain were busy visiting relatives and friends for New Year's greetings.

Zhao Yingong was now one of the "celebrities" in Hangzhou City. Since Zhang Dai and Fang Yizhi visited successively, his Wanbi Bookstore had seemingly become a famous cultural salon in the city. Not to mention the literati of all sizes inside and outside the city, even the ordinary citizens in the city knew that Wanbi Bookstore was an "interesting good place."

Especially some scholars of the Fushe in Zhejiang, led by Fang Yizhi, often gathered here to explore the "Science of Investigating Things" (*Gewu*)—Zhao Yingong achieved very good results through books like "Treatise on Light for Beginners" gifted to Zhang Dai, successfully attracting this group of scholars concerned with *Gewu* to Wanbi Bookstore. Thus achieving his goal of approaching the core figures of the Fushe.

"The New Year is about over." When Gao Xuan stepped onto the steps of Wanbi Bookstore, he sighed with emotion—compared to when he first came to Wanbi Bookstore early last year, his complexion was much better, his clothes had become very neat, and holding a bamboo folding fan that never left his hand regardless of the season, he looked like a *Xiucai*. Obviously, he had been well-fed and warmly dressed recently, living a quite comfortable little life.

Since Gao Xuan accepted the employment of Wanbi Bookstore and became a contracted writer, with an income of two taels of silver a month—his originally straitened days greatly improved, and his voice became much louder in front of his father-in-law and brother-in-law.

Gao Xuan was an "Editor," and also a staff member of this bookstore. The clerk at the door didn't greet him, letting him walk straight through the main hall to the "Editorial Department" in the back.

The Editorial Department was located in "Wanbi Tower," which was an "Australian-style" three-story blue brick building with a garden. There were a dozen rooms upstairs and downstairs, used by the full set of "reading, writing, editing, and proofreading" teams—Zhao Yingong specifically established the "Tianshui Society" within Wanbi Bookstore.

The main task of this publishing house was not to edit the books printed by Wanbi Bookstore—those were all printed using paper matrixes shipped from Lingao and didn't require any editing work. Apart from proofreading some paper proofs of traditional books shipped from Lingao, the publishing house's main work was to edit various popular readings, especially magazines.

These popular readings were all printed using lithography. This printing method allowed for quick plate making and accommodated both text and images, making it very suitable for small-scale, multi-batch printing businesses. China's first popular magazine, *Dianshizhai Pictorial*, used lithography. Zhao Yingong's publishing business ideas were inspired by *Dianshizhai Pictorial*.

However, his business scope was much larger. There were three types of periodically published magazines, targeting different groups of people. The first was *Tianshui Life Weekly*, which targeted scholars like Zhang Dai and Fang Yizhi: most of them had degrees like *Juren* or *Xiucai*, and some were even *Jinshi* who had served as officials. They were in well-off circumstances, many enjoyed long-standing literary reputations, and were upper-middle-class members among scholars, with considerable pursuit of spiritual life.

*Tianshui Life Weekly* was divided into four sections: Current Affairs Commentary, Reading Thoughts, Culture and Entertainment, and Strange News and Anecdotes. Its positioning was roughly the routine of *Sanlian* or *Phoenix* in the old spacetime: having a certain grade and depth without losing its nature as popular reading.

Zhao Yingong knew that although the target demographic was the middle and upper class, they had fame and influence among the intellectual class, and the reading habits of this group would inevitably influence many others. Just as white-collar workers always unconsciously imitated business elites, if efforts were made to build fame among the target demographic, this magazine would radiate to the entire intellectual class.

As for the introduction of science and technology, Zhao Yingong temporarily categorized it under Strange News and Anecdotes—changing the concepts of scholar-officials couldn't be done overnight. Moreover, populizing completely new concepts to traditional intellectuals who had no basic scientific concepts but considered themselves masters of knowledge would be too difficult. It was better to start from a humanistic perspective to change their concepts a bit first.

The second type was *Wanbi Studio Pictorial*, which was a different spacetime pirated version of *Dianshizhai Pictorial*, with mixed text and images, focusing mainly on images. The content focused on overseas strange news, social anecdotes, and natural science popularization. The target demographic was urban citizens with certain economic capabilities. The content was easy to understand.

Both of these pictorials used 16-kai pages and were beautifully printed. Because they targeted higher-level groups, the prices were also higher. Addressing the lower-level commoners, Zhao Yingong launched the third magazine: *Classic of Mountains and Seas Pictorial* (*Shanhaijing Pictorial*). This pictorial compressed paper and printing costs to the maximum, using cheap paper and simpler lithographic plate making. The format was reduced to 32-kai.

The content was mainly social news, a mix of folk legends and social novels, supplemented by a small amount of common scientific knowledge. It was mainly presented in the form of serial pictures—very little "text," only a few sentences, using not only vernacular Chinese but also vulgar characters. This was excellent leisure reading for ordinary people who knew few characters or were completely illiterate.

Hangzhou was a commercial city with a large population engaged in the tertiary industry. Citizen culture was very developed, and the urban commoners had a great demand for leisure and entertainment. "Comic strips" like *Classic of Mountains and Seas Pictorial* fit their requirements exactly.

Zhao Yingong hired a group of down-and-out literati to work for the publishing house at the cost of one to two taels of silver a month, euphemistically calling them "Editors." There were those who worked on text and those specifically responsible for painting.

Gao Xuan walked into the courtyard. The servant guarding the door was sweeping the floor; seeing him enter, he hurriedly and respectfully called out, "Mr. Gao!"

Gao Xuan nodded politely and asked, "Has the Master come?"

Zhao Yingong came to the "Editorial Department" to "guide work" once every three mornings. Calculating the days, he should be coming today.

"The Master didn't come today," the servant said. This surprised Gao Xuan a bit. Although Master Zhao had some strange ways in his speech and behavior, he was extremely disciplined in doing things and wouldn't change his habits without special circumstances.

Gao Xuan went into the small building on his own and came to his "Public Office." The sign hanging at the door read "Social Affairs Department." This department specialized in writing social news and street stories. It was also the department with the most local scholars.

The room had been cleaned until the windows were bright and the tables clean. Several rows of desks in the old spacetime style were placed face to face and back to back. It made the Senators feel very familiar as soon as they walked in. However, what lay on the desks were all the Four Treasures of the Study.

Several "Editors" had already arrived in the office, and everyone exchanged greetings. As soon as Gao Xuan sat down, a servant brought breakfast.

Master Zhao was a very good person. Since most of the editors came from poor families, he provided a breakfast every morning for the "Editors" who came to work. Although it was nothing more than fried dough sticks, white porridge, and Xiaoshan dried radishes, for these poor scholars, it was enough to warm their hearts and lungs.
