# Chapter 106 - Mobilizing the Masses (2)

Tan Guihuang said: "If the world were peaceful, just drying salt would be enough to ensure food and clothing." He said that actually, the salt this salt field could produce annually was more than just over a thousand yin. The salt merchants from Leizhou alone would come to buy several hundred yin every year. Since it was forcibly occupied by Great Household Gou, in order to monopolize the salt trade, he forcibly drove away the salt merchants from the mainland.

"Why?" Wang Luobin felt strange. For salt merchants, buying salt from anyone was not a problem. Why did Great Household Gou forbid old customers from buying salt after occupying the salt field?

"His family has a salt firm in Qiongshan. All the salt is transported to Qiongshan." Tan Guihuang sighed, "He has his own channels to sell salt to the mainland, so he doesn't care about the merchants from Leizhou."

It seemed there was collusion between officials and merchants involved here. However, none of them understood how the salt laws of the Ming Dynasty worked, nor could they figure out where the key lay.

"As long as there is salt, are you afraid of having no food or clothes?" Xi Yazhou waved his hand, "Every salt merchant on the mainland is filthy rich. Is it hard for us, who work bitterly to dry salt, to just make a living with food and clothing?"

Tan Chengqing suddenly turned silent amidst the joy and sighed softly, "We are just afraid that the salt we dry won't be kept."

"Don't be afraid of this!" Xi Yazhou said with confidence, "With us here, do you know this firearm?" He weighed the SKS rifle beside him. The blue gun steel gleamed faintly in the light of the kerosene lamp. "Even the hundreds of village braves of Huang Family Stockade were finished off just the same. Are we afraid of a few bastards who bully the weak and fear the strong?"

"But what if you leave? It will be even worse then." Tan Chengqing was obviously worried about the future, "The government says you are pirates, you say you are maritime merchants. Whether pirates or maritime merchants, you can't stay in Lingao for a lifetime. You have iron ships and fast guns, leaving whenever you want. But Great Household Gou is connected with the government—" Then he detailed the process of how Great Household Gou occupied the salt field in the past, with increased disappointment in his expression. He emphasized that the clerks and yamen runners in the government office all received benefits and helped Great Household Gou to oppress them. Even if they wanted to find a place to reason, they couldn't.

Xi Yazhou nodded and asked: "How many people does the Gou family have?"

"There are two big households in his main clan." Tan Guihuang was obviously more familiar with the local situation than his son. There were two brothers in the Gou family. The one in the countryside was the elder Gou, who kept more than a hundred family guards and evil servants, some of whom were desperate outlaws fleeing from the mainland, very fierce. The second Gou, because his son passed the imperial examination as a scholar (Shengyuan), moved to the county town, specializing in colluding with the government and monopolizing lawsuits. These two households colluded with each other and acted like local tyrants.

"How many people were in your village at that time?"

"At that time, there were many people in the village, more than three hundred households."

"Three or four hundred households, there must be three or four hundred able-bodied men, right?" Xi Yazhou said, "You three or four hundred able-bodied men, just watched helplessly as people took away your property?"

Hearing this, both men present blushed and lowered their heads. At this moment, a crisp female voice was suddenly heard: "This is not everyone's fault! It was all caused by the government."

Everyone looked and saw it was the girl disguised as a man. Seeing everyone paying attention to her, she realized she had forgotten her disguise as a man and became anxious and overwhelmed, standing up and wanting to run outside.

Du Wen hurriedly comforted her beside her. Without a common language, she just smiled and held her hand. With a person of the same sex beside her, the girl calmed down, and a blush appeared on her face not blackened by pot ash.

"You are Little Qin, right? Village Head Tan's daughter." Xi Yazhou said, handing her a fruit candy, "Don't be afraid, we knew long ago you are a girl."

Tan Guihuang smiled apologetically: "She is indeed my brother's child. Although a girl, she is the only child. Her father treasures her very much, and refused to betroth her even though she is old—"

Actually, this girl was only seventeen or eighteen years old, but in an era of early marriage and childbearing, she was indeed considered late. The girl refused to take the fruit candy, but ran over to kneel before Xi Yazhou, kowtowing repeatedly, begging him to help save her father and the village elders.

Du Wen hurriedly went over to pull her up, regardless of whether she understood or not, chattering a lot about gender equality, making Zhang Xingjiao so angry that his face turned red, and he simply refused to translate a single word.

"Little Qin, rest assured. We will definitely help rescue the villagers who were taken away." Xi Yazhou wouldn't give up such an occasion to show his heroism in front of a girl. He patted his chest with an extremely reliable expression, "Just tell us about this government matter."

It turned out that in the forty-fifth year of Wanli, after the earthquake in Lingao, the Maniao Salt Field suffered great losses. The salt workers specially submitted a petition to the county government at that time, requesting exemption or postponement of salt tax for a few years—although many salt fields were destroyed, the actual production capacity of the salt field still had a certain surplus. Mainly, the damage to personnel and property caused by the earthquake was huge, and recovery would take three or four years of respite. However, the Gou family had long coveted the salt field and used this opportunity to let Gou the Second discuss with familiar clerks in the county government, and bribed the private adviser, forcibly detaining and destroying the petition. Gou the Elder took the opportunity to monopolize the salt tax, employing many runners and thugs to urge the collection of salt tax in the salt village every day. The village, forced beyond endurance, could only ask him to pay on their behalf, thus falling into his grasp step by step. Although the county magistrate later noticed this matter, not offending local powerful clans was a golden rule for local officials. As long as the annual salt tax could be collected normally and the Gou family constantly sent filial piety gifts, he ignored it.

"In the final analysis, it's the government backing him up." Xi Yazhou said, "Right?"

"Yes, with the government backing him up, who can do anything to him?" Little Qin looked helpless, "Even if he comes alone, we dare not do anything. Otherwise, just with those men under him, Brother Chengqing can beat three of them alone."

Xi Yazhou knew the matter began to touch the core—the Gou family's tricks were actually not rare, nothing more than "collusion between officials and gangs." Collusion between officials and merchants, officials and gangs, officials and bandits has been a common social phenomenon in Chinese history. Even in the 21st century, a successful person, no matter which path to success he takes, always has the shadow of officials behind him: merchants want to earn excessive profits, gang bosses want a safe backing, all these depend on figures in official circles. Even the relatively aloof intellectual circles know that the power of an official hat is much stronger than academics. The Gou family in Lingao County of the Great Ming was nothing more than the same model.

Opposing the government means rebellion. The common people actually don't like the governments of past dynasties riding on their heads—but the government has severe laws and harsh punishments, and has an army—in modern terms, it controls the "state apparatus." Whether you like it or not, you have to obey it. Even the heroes of the greenwood take "not fighting officials" as a golden rule.

Asking the common people to oppose the government, in whatever form, is equivalent to "rebellion"—unless driven to desperation, the common people will absolutely not step on this path. Xi Yazhou certainly wasn't naive enough to think that his incitement could make the common people shed their heads and blood to conquer the country for the transmigrators—his policy was a roundabout way, perhaps called curve revolution.

"In the final analysis, the Gou family is so rampant nothing more than relying on two things: keeping thugs and colluding with the government." Xi Yazhou smiled slightly, "The first one is not worth mentioning. As long as everyone can unite, his few people are not enough to fill the gaps between teeth. The key is the second one. Since he can collude with the government, so can we."

The few people from the salt village stared dumbfounded at this short-haired "maritime merchant leader," probably feeling somewhat incredible. After a moment, Tan Guihuang asked cautiously: "Master is also familiar with figures in official circles?"

"To be honest, not familiar."

"Then how to associate with the government?"

"Why do you think the government associates with local tyrants and evil gentry like the Gou family?"

"Isn't it for a few coins?" Tan Chengqing looked disdainful.

"Correct. Since the officials covet yellow and white things (gold and silver), he has them, and we have them too." Saying this, he explained his ideas to the salt workers.

Actually, the plan was not complicated: First was to regain the right to monopolize the salt tax. With this, the Gou family had an official status. If this signboard was not smashed, the salt workers would still be trembling with fear. As for how to regain it, the salt workers didn't need to worry; they would handle it.

Once the salt tax right was regained, the Gou family would lose the legitimate excuse to interfere with the salt field production. What he had left was nothing more than a rotten debt delayed for more than ten years. Xi Yazhou in the later generations also understood this kind of usury with interest rolling on interest: as long as the debtor still had a little economic ability, the creditor would never say you had paid it off. So rather than continuing to pay this unclear money, it was better to write it off with one stroke and completely renege on the debt.

Losing the gold signboard of monopolizing salt tax, the debt issue would purely be a civil dispute, not involving the big principles of imperial grain and national tax. Even if he had the ability to collude with the government, it wouldn't be so easy for the official circles to stick their necks out for him.

After taking back the operation rights of the salt field and no longer being exploited by him, the income from selling salt would be guaranteed. Paying the salt tax and the "customary money" up and down the county as usual, the government would have no loss in both public and private aspects. The Gou family would lose its utility value. Without utility value, would the government still be willing to look after them?

"How can this matter be so simple." As soon as Xi Yazhou finished speaking, Tan Chengqing smiled bitterly, "The Gou family is extremely familiar with the clerks and runners in the three squads and six offices of the county government. They have had dealings for generations, deeply intertwined. Just relying on the Masters wanting to collect this salt tax, it won't pass in the Revenue Office."

Ancient county administration was less "rule by officials" than "rule by clerks." Since the Song Dynasty, most prefecture and county local officials were selected through imperial examinations. The administrative affairs of prefectures and counties were extremely cumbersome. Besides a set of complicated procedures for every matter and basic laws, the precedents that should be cited or could be used for analogy were countless. Which law or regulation should be followed to handle a certain official matter could not be found in books like laws and codes. If a mistake was made or a flaw was found by superiors, it would be rejected at best or reprimanded at worst, wouldn't that mean bearing the consequences? At this time, one had to find precedents that had occurred in the past to apply, so as to ensure nothing went wrong. But finding exactly what precedent was a branch of learning. This was called the "Way of Clerks."

People from imperial examination backgrounds could talk logically about classics, history, and policy essays, and recite poems and Confucius sayings fluently, but few could grasp the knack of these local administrations—not to mention others, just a fish-scale register (land registry) looked like ghost talismans to outsiders, but those who understood knew it contained information on land area, location, form, yield, tax amount, and owner. Therefore, officials, in order not to make mistakes or out of fear of trouble, could only entrust these matters to the runners and clerks of the three squads and six offices to handle. Humble clerks actually controlled local administrative power in ancient society.

Because clerks were often hereditary and had deep collusion with local big households, it was far from being severed by simple economic means. So Xi Yazhou's plan sounded really a bit idealistic to them.
