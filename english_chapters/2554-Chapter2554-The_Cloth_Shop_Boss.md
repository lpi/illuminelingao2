# Chapter 2554: The Cloth Shop Boss

Li Shan scratched his head, pondered a bit on the Guangzhou market situation report brought by Chen Xiaobing and others, then said: "Seems both are correct?"

Zou Biao spread both hands: "Meaning not wrong. These two sentences look contradictory, but both are correct. Social development has dynamic space-time imbalance; Britain is so, China is even more so. These two seemingly contradictory processes might exist simultaneously in the same country, possibly even within the same county."

"Didn't expect that you, clearly a Science student, have quite an interest in social sciences."

"I am an Engineering student." Zou Biao said solemnly, "Also, what we are discussing now belongs to economic history in essence; without certain mathematical ability, one cannot comprehend correctly."

"So long-duration history is still effective? If history still develops like this, seems historical things will still reappear?"

"Historical materials have true and false, but there is no saying of history invalid or not." Zou Biao said, "History itself is summary and refinement based on past information. Moreover, historical materials themselves have true and false, incomplete and broken. Wanting to know the situation truly still needs field investigation."

"We go for a loop in International [Market], almost feels like you want to write an argumentative essay." Li Shan laughed.

"International opened smoothly, but afraid the market is very uncalm." Zou Biao showed a worried look, "Not going to see the market personally, afraid big problems will arise."

Naturally, they also knew about the Paper Cotton matter. Whether Police or Political Security, an important job was collecting social and public opinion. The matter of Paper Cotton flooding and speculation was sent to their desks more than a month ago.

But Paper Cotton speculation actually belonged to financial problems. although Li Shan and Zou Biao realized the danger inside, how to respond specifically depended on Finance and Financial Department's decision. After all, they were leaders of production departments; they had no decision power regarding specific market operations.

"I also feel this Paper Cotton matter is somewhat outrageous. Speculative color is too thick." Zou Biao frowned tightly, "What did the Wang couple say."

"They don't manage this. Theoretically speaking, this matter is 'Touching neither 1 nor 8' [totally unrelated] now. After all, we don't have a futures market. The Bank also says this isn't under their charge—after all, people speculating Paper Cotton didn't take loans from the Bank either. Mayor Liu held a work meeting, giving this matter to Chu He and Ren Youzi. Theoretically, aren't they heads of Guangzhou Stock Exchange?"

"What use are those two bare commanders?" Don't look at Chu He and Ren Youzi as one Securities Regulatory Commission Secretary and one Stock Exchange Chairman; actually, expecting them to command, they could only command their own life secretaries. Set up an office in Great World for joint work.

Because securities business volume was very small efficiently, the Senate adhered to the tenet of not raising idle people. This Stock Exchange and Securities Regulatory Commission only opened for business on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, the two had separate part-time jobs.

"Isn't this professional alignment?"

"I feel going on like this will cause trouble sooner or later, sigh sigh sigh." Zou Biao started sighing.

They took a small skiff directly from Great World Wharf, all the way directly to International Market Wharf. Landing didn't attract much attention. Although the opening celebration was just held yesterday, the market face here was already quite lively. Naturalized Citizens entered and exited a lot; everyone was already accustomed to seeing people wearing Australian clothes, not attracting attention.

To promote market development, Hainan Demonstration Factory started putting inventory cotton yarn and cotton cloth into the market in batches starting a week ago. And Nansha Cotton Textile Factory, which they supported emphatically, also started putting cotton cloth into the market. Now was time to see market reaction.

In the four professional zones A, B, C, D of International Market, besides Zone D being mainly Senate enterprises opening, rent rate of shop slots in the first three zones was actually less than half. However, even less than half, the transaction volume formed was already quite considerable according to this timeline's standards. Merchants could fully comprehend the benefits of this type of professional market.

They first went to the Market Management Company to roughly understand the current market operation status. The situation was similar to what they imagined: current transaction volume wasn't big, but had a trend of gradual growth. However, in total transaction volume, the proportion of flowers, yarn, and cloth was very small. Only occupying less than twenty percent of total transaction volume. The big head was still silk products.

The reason was self-evident: raw silk and silk textiles had bulk buying from foreign merchants—with Guangzhou opening as a port and various restrictions on foreign merchants cancelled successively, foreign merchants' purchasing shifted from "Monsoon System" to "Year-long System." Many merchants stayed in Guangzhou long-term; obtaining commodities no longer concentrated in certain months.

On cotton products, the export quantity of various locally produced cotton cloths was minimal. On the contrary, due to the relationship of hot sales of low-medium grade cotton cloth in the market, large quantities of Songjiang cotton cloth arrived recently. Affected by factors of increased cotton cloth demand and rising prices, and the influence of continuously increasing demand for cotton yarn from small production weaving households and families, cotton yarn shipment volume of Lingao Demonstration Factory and Nansha Factory was stable and improving. Even "Improved Yarn" produced by Type 07 manual machines rose with the water. Prices were also climbing section by section.

Looking from the market, besides cotton price skyrocketing and that "Paper Cotton" which already started going mad, the general market situation was considered not bad. Machine-made yarn gained great recognition, having knocked out Earth Yarn's market to a certain degree.

Coming out from Market Management Company, they turned around in the market again, chatting with bosses and waiters at retail departments, roughly verifying data obtained from Management Company.

Speaking so, as long as Paper Cotton speculation could be curbed in time, dissolving financial risk, the risk of crisis outbreak in cotton textile market belonged to preventable and controllable scope.

After walking this circle, the two felt considered satisfied. Finally, Zou Biao suggested looking at Zone A.

Zone A did all small businesses. Don't look at people coming and going, very lively; in the entire market's transaction quota, it didn't even have five percent proportion. But such small business often related to thousands of families.

"...To see how much influence our behavior has on society, looking directly at the masses' condition is most realistic."

Zone A, besides having shop faces, also allowed setting up stalls utilizing undeveloped open ground. Merchants here, whether buying or selling, were small until couldn't be smaller. Traded commodities were few, only one or two bolts of cloth/silk; a few skeins of cotton/silk yarn; a picul of cotton/dry cocoons and such. Business though small, was the sideline of countless farm households around Guangzhou. Women of many families exchanged this for meager income to subsidize family expenses.

They quickly noticed in front of a small shop face, seven or eight people surrounded, seemingly saying something. Looking at appearance, seemed like some shop household was acquiring cloth from retail households.

Under Li Shan's signal, the group leaned over calmly. Observing the situation in the store.

Sure enough, this was a small "Cloth Shop." Li Shan knew the word "Shop" [Zhuang] had a special definition in this timeline's commercial field. Used in handicraft field, mostly "Putting-out Merchants": giving out raw materials, acquiring finished products; also some not giving materials, directly acquiring products from loose households; mostly having both.

Merchants setting up Shops all had their own wholesale channels. After receiving goods, re-transporting to some place for whole batch sales.

The Cloth Shop boss was a thin and tall man. While commanding two waiters to move cloth and receive visitors, he talked and bargained with retail households coming to sell cloth while picking on quality, measuring length, and finally weighing on scale. From time to time also reprimanding or reminding waiters a few sentences. Truly could be called ears listening eight directions and eyes viewing six roads.

Almost every roll of cloth unfolded in his hands, he started shaking his head. Although Li Shan and Zou Biao couldn't quite understand his Cantonese, general meaning was still known: all kinds of picky faults. Although retail households argued with him every time, final results were all losing the battle, deducted a few fen to one jiao by him.

"His style makes me think of a Wuxia character..." Zou Biao said.

"Who?"

"Head Shaking Lion."

Both laughed. This laugh alerted the boss. Boss raised eyes to look; several people wearing "Cadre Suits" were looking on. His mind was most active, immediately smiling and greeting: "Several Comrades, how about coming to the small shop to look?"

Li Shan also intended to understand merchant situation, so nodded: "Good is good, just you are still busy with business..."

"This doesn't hinder." Boss laughed, "Skill I practiced since young, one heart two uses, delaying neither talking business nor doing business!"

Finished speaking, greeted waiter: "Ah Qian, invite several Comrades inside to sit, brew good tea!"

Li, Zou two entered the shop. Shop area was very small. Besides counter, all was inventory. But inside the counter, a tea table and a few Australian Rattan Chairs were set up. Looking at the full set of "Kung Fu Tea" tea set on the table gave Li Shan a familiar feeling. didn't expect habits brought from old timeline by some Senators spread so fast.

Boss let waiter cover for a while, came over personally to brew tea for the two. Asked: "Two must be Australian Big Cadres..."

Li Shan couldn't help laughing: "How do you know?"

"Looking at your appearances I know. Attitude and manner, I know at a glance! Although missing that bit of meaning compared to Senator Chiefs, still have seven or eight parts resemblance."

Hearing this, Li Shan didn't know if this counted as praise or deprecation, could only dry laugh a few times. Zou Biao felt this boss was very interesting, asked: "Your vision is true! We are from Great Song Weaving Bureau, specially came to check Australian Cotton Yarn sales situation today."

"So this Australian Yarn is spun from your place!" Manager "surprisedly" said, "Disrespect, disrespect! Don't know Comrades' noble surnames?"

This needed no concealment either; two reported surnames respectively. Manager said: "My humble surname Li, given name Qiwei. Opened a small Cloth Shop in Nanhai County. This counts as a branch."

Tea in the two's mouths almost sprayed out. Li Shan endured laugh strongly, said:

"So... So it is Manager Li."

"Dare not, dare not." Manager Li was very excited, just about to entertain personally, customers waiting outside grew impatient, clamoring to sell cloth.
