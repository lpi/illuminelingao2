# Chapter 1662 - A Rescue at the Dock

In Suo Pu's view, the obstacles to the Council of Elders' rule over Guangdong, apart from natural factors, were the social conditions.

Suo Pu's gaze swept over everyone in the forward cabin. Kang Mingsi and Xie Peng were still tirelessly discussing matters.

Guangdong was different from Hainan: Hainan had a small population, land conflicts were not acute, and the power of local strongmen, landlords, and clan forces was limited. Under the Council of Elders' military pressure, they had easily submitted and been transformed. In Guangdong, things would not be so simple. The historical grievances among the Chaoshan people, the Hakka, and the Cantonese alone would be enough to keep Director Liu—now eagerly preparing to take up his post—busy for quite some time.

"The wheel of history rolls forward inexorably, crushing everything in its path"—easy to say, hard to do...

He recalled the materials he had read about accepting and transforming old societies and old cities. It was now near the fifteenth of the eighth lunar month. A full moon hung in the sky. The boats anchored in the river bend showed flickering lantern lights. The distant sounds of flutes and *pipa* drifted on the breeze. The river wind was moist and refreshing, the water murmured softly—all was serene.

Looking across to the north bank of the West River, Zhaoqing City stood with its back against General's Peak, facing the West River, commanding the waterway. The city wall had a circumference of 2.8 kilometers, entirely faced with brick. Though it couldn't be called a particularly imposing fortress, it had all the defensive features—corner towers, battlements, enemy platforms, barbicans—worthy of a strategic military location and crucial junction of the two Guangdong provinces. Suo Pu estimated by eye that the walls were over six meters high. Even without binoculars, he could see that artillery platforms of various sizes had been built atop the walls.

He noticed a three-story pavilion on the wall, quite impressive. He asked: "Is that Piyun Tower?"

Lin Ming hastened to reply: "Piyun Tower is at the North Gate. That's Kuixing Pavilion."

Suo Pu nodded. Kuixing Pavilion was dedicated to the star god Kuixing. But from its outward appearance, it was clearly a military stronghold, with gun ports and arrow slits bristling densely. These defensive measures were of little use, though. No wonder Lord Macartney had been left with nothing but contempt for the Qing after his audience with Emperor Qianlong—and the technological gap between Britain and the Qing was much smaller than that between the Council of Elders and the Ming.

While he was lost in thought, Lin Ming had already led some men to set up tables and chairs on the bow deck. He personally took dishes and wine from a large food container and laid them out. His eager, deft manner was like that of a waiter in a restaurant. Suo Pu couldn't help frowning slightly: this Centurion Lin was truly a shrewd, capable, and socially adept character! No wonder a petty centurion—an official of the most negligible rank—could get along so well everywhere just by brandishing the words "Jinyiwei"!

He supposed that men like this would do just as well under the Council of Elders' rule, managing and maneuvering their way through...

"Master Suo, the moon is bright tonight. Rather than sitting idle in boredom, why not share some wine and admire the moon together? Gaoyao County has just sent over a banquet." Lin Ming saw him emerge from the cabin and quickly invited him.

Suo Pu nodded: "That sounds good."

At the table sat only the four of them. The banquet had been sent by the county magistrate and was quite sumptuous.

"Come, come, come—this is Guilin Ruilu wine, all the way from Guangxi. Hard to find in Guangzhou..." Lin Ming was about to pour for them. Kang Mingsi glanced at Suo Pu. Suo Pu knew that retired soldiers could all hold their liquor, but this was "mission time," and drinking would be "breaking discipline."

"We'll make an exception today—consider it a day off," Suo Pu smiled. "Let's have a few cups, just don't get drunk."

The men raised their cups. Though Suo Pu poured himself some wine, he only sipped lightly. He watched the others drink and admire the moon, listening to the lilting strings and pipes drifting from other boats on the river. No one spoke; they all seemed intoxicated by the moment.

Just then, the faint sound of a woman weeping drifted on the wind. Suo Pu paid it no heed. Since arriving in this time-space, he had grown accustomed to all manner of suffering and misery. He knew well that momentary compassion could not bring peace to the realm. Besides, he was here for a staff reconnaissance, not a charity gala.

Lin Ming set down his cup and frowned: "How insufferable!" He made to rise. "I'll go have a look and give her some coins to move along..."

Suo Pu shook his head: "It doesn't matter. Let her weep. There are too many sorrowful people in this world. How could we possibly look after them all? Just keep drinking."

But Kang Mingsi said: "Well... from the sound of it, it's a woman. In this pitch darkness, could she be suffering at someone's hands? It doesn't seem right to just stand by."

Suo Pu smiled: "I didn't know you had such a tender heart for the fairer sex. Since you put it that way, let's go look into this matter." He called over an escort and ordered him to find out who was weeping.

"If she's just in difficulty, give her a few taels of silver," Suo Pu instructed.

Before long, the escort returned with a report: "She's a singing girl. From her accent, she's from somewhere near South Zhili. She was brought here two years ago as a concubine. This year, her master died and she was thrown out. She's been scraping by singing for coins here at the dock. She had the misfortune of borrowing silver from a flower-boat madam, and now she's being pressed so hard she's in tears."

"Since it's a matter of debt, find out how much and pay it off for her."

The escort smiled, as if there were more to say. Lin Ming laughed: "This isn't something silver can solve. Anyone who runs a flower boat at a major dock like Zhaoqing is a figure to be reckoned with. I doubt they're after just a few taels—they want her body."

"Oh? There are such machinations?" Suo Pu frowned.

"From what this master here says, this singing girl works independently—she has no indenture contract in a madam's hands. On the flower boat, whether she sells herself, when she sells herself, to whom she sells or doesn't sell—she decides all of that herself. The money she earns is split fifty-fifty with the madam. If a patron gives her private gifts, she can keep them for herself."

At this point, Suo Pu understood. Clearly the madam felt she wasn't earning enough from the girl and wanted to change from a partnership to an acquisition. He frowned:

"In that case, let's help her out."

Lin Ming said: "Helping her isn't difficult. The question is how far you want to go..."

Kang Mingsi grew impatient: "Old Lin, stop beating around the bush. Out with it!"

Lin Ming gave a dry laugh: "If it's just help for now, we pay off her debt and be done with it. But where there's a first of the month, there's a fifteenth. As long as she's still working on the Zhaoqing docks, sooner or later she'll fall into someone's clutches. If you really want to help her to the end, you have to get her out of here—send her off to wherever she has family or relatives, to settle down peacefully..."

"This is like playing matchmaker and then delivering the bride yourself," Suo Pu laughed. "That's why I say it's best not to be too kindhearted. We have too much business to attend to these things. Here's what we'll do: give her some travel money and let her seek her fortune elsewhere. The rest is up to her own fate."

"Yes, the Chief's instruction is wise," Lin Ming said with a smile. He thought to himself that the escort alone probably couldn't settle this—someone with official credentials would need to step in. He volunteered: "I'll handle this myself."

Kang Mingsi said: "I'll come along for a look."

Suo Pu smiled: "Look if you like, but don't go playing the martial arts hero."

The two men, with an escort, went ashore. After a short walk, they came to a small temple that still seemed to have some incense offerings. Lin Ming knew that such temples often had spare rooms to rent out—called "monk lodgings." It was not unusual for a woman who "worked independently" singing at the docks to stay in such a place.

The east wing of this temple had very low buildings. Small rooms lined all four sides of the courtyard, one next to another—over a dozen in all. Most were already dark, but a few still had oil lamps burning, flickering like ghost lights. The escort indicated a direction. Only then did Lin Ming notice that a small room on the southwest side had its door open. Some bundles and belongings were scattered in front, and someone was crouched under the eaves—a woman, it seemed—from whom the weeping was coming.

He strolled over and bent down to ask: "Was that you crying just now?"

"..."

The woman stirred slightly but did not answer. By the moonlight, Lin Ming couldn't see her face clearly. She appeared to be about thirty years old. Though he couldn't make out her features, he could tell she was quite comely. He sighed inwardly and asked again: "How much do you owe?"

"Fifteen taels." The woman raised her head to glance at Lin Ming, sighed, and said no more. Lin Ming felt the voice was somehow familiar. He was about to ask more when a woman's cold laugh came from inside the room: "Don't listen to her lies!" Following the voice, a woman in her fifties emerged and pointed at her: "Last year she borrowed seven taels from me to buy headpieces and clothes, at thirty percent interest. She hasn't paid it back. This year she got sick and borrowed another eight taels. Principal plus interest comes to forty-eight taels and six *qian*!" She rattled off the figures like an abacus, sharp and clear, spittle flying.

The young woman protested: "Heaven knows—the jewelry and ornaments I gave you, never mind forty-eight taels, were worth at least four hundred and eighty..."

"Those few brass and silver trinkets of yours, with a bit of kingfisher feather decoration—a few *qian* per piece!"

Lin Ming knew that the debts these flower-boat madams extended to their girls were compound-interest "king of hell" loans—if you tried to settle the accounts, you'd never get to the bottom of it. He spoke up: "I'll pay off this silver for her."

He pulled a Delong bank note from his sleeve and tossed it on the ground:

"Here's a fifty-tael Delong note! She and you are now even."

The madam quickly crawled on the ground to pick up the note. Holding it to the lamplight, she saw it was indeed a Delong note—the paper was distinctive, the printed patterns peculiar. There had never been any counterfeits on the market; you could tell it was genuine just by touch. Yet she sneered: "You're paying for her? Who do you think you are? Let me tell you—this little hussy has already caught the eye of Master Cao from Guangxi. He's willing to pay three... five hundred taels to keep her. You come here with fifty taels and think you can cut off my prospects?"

Though she said this, she clutched the note and didn't budge.

Lin Ming knew she was raising the price on the spot. Not bothering to waste words, he pulled out his badge from his waist and brandished it: "How much do you reckon this is worth?"

The madam thought it was some kind of jade ornament. She squinted to look—and in the moonlight saw clearly that it was a Jinyiwei badge. She was a madam at a major dock's pleasure quarter, well-traveled and experienced. One look at the badge and she knew she'd stirred up trouble. She quickly plastered on a smile: "What is the lord saying? That's a priceless treasure. Even if I had the heart and guts of a bear or leopard, I wouldn't dare ask for it..."
