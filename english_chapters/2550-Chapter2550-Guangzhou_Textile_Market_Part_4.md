# Chapter 2550: Guangzhou Textile Market (Part 4)

"...In the future, domestic and foreign merchant ships carrying textiles and raw materials can dock directly at the wharves here to load and unload cargo, saving the procedures and costs of land transshipment. Look, this row of land with houses under construction along the river is the future logistics center—that is, warehouses."

The two clicked their tongues unconsciously. The scale was so huge; would there really be so many merchants and goods coming here to trade? Looking at the scale of investment by the Australians, it seemed like a sure thing nailed on a board.

"As for the issue of popularity [foot traffic], you don't need to worry either. Although current customers are mainly wholesalers, we also planned blocks suitable for ordinary people to operate and consume. So there will also be plans in transportation for the future. The ferry wharf is just one; in the future, scheduled ferry boats traveling to and from here will be opened at various wharves outside the South Gate of Guangzhou. Not only solving the market's passenger flow problem but also promoting traffic between Henan Land and Guangzhou urban area."

Before a cross-river bridge appeared, Henan Land was quite restricted by commuting. If placed in later generations, relying merely on ferry boats and liners would not be enough. But 17th-century Henan Land was still purely countryside; commuting demand was far less than later generations. Providing cheap and safe ferry services was enough to satisfy general needs.

The Senate had development ambitions for this Henan Land area, planning to build it into the future New Guangzhou City. But right now, erecting a big bridge over the Pearl River was beyond their power, so they could only put down this huge New Guangzhou City plan temporarily, only attempting some new projects with limited investment.

At the market entrance, one could see a tall schematic diagram of the market, with different zones marked in different colors.

Along the Pearl River, from west to east, Zone A, B, C, and D, the four main business zones, were arranged sitting south and facing north according to the main gate direction, dealing in textiles, textile raw materials, textile machinery, and corresponding items. On their east and west sides, two zones were planned respectively. The East Zone was a living area, providing detached houses and single dormitories for rent and sale. Merchants, family members, and shop assistants could live here. A commercial street was also planned, opening various service industry shops, including catering, groceries, bathing... In the future, a "National Primary School" would also be established here. However, just a market was far from enough for the City Government to open a primary school for it; its main enrollment targets were children of employees of the Guangzhou State Cotton General Factory under construction opposite the market.

As for the West Zone, it was the Merchant Guild Zone. An Jiu said the Merchant Guild Zone was specially prepared for foreign merchants coming here.

The area they entered first was Zone A. Speaking of location, Zone A was the best, but the target customers here happened to be the most trivial small vendors and ordinary citizens.

When planning, designers considered that the market area was very large. Citizens coming for leisure purposes couldn't possibly stroll through the entire market, so the retail zone was placed in the block near the entrance. This not only facilitated citizens' strolling but could also gather popularity, forming a feeling of people coming and going at the market's main gate.

The business of the retail area was mainly in two parts. One part was for small vendors and local small weaving households to sell individually produced fabrics and raw materials. According to the Senators' speculation, eliminating household textile handicraft industry right now was impossible. Blocking is not as good as channeling; it was better to provide them an opportunity to differentiate themselves, saving them from the exploitation of putting-out merchants. Perhaps some models of getting rich through hard work could emerge from them.

Besides this, this zone was also a Clothing Street: not only providing ready-made clothes and alteration services but also providing old clothes recycling and sales, sewing equipment sales, etc. generally speaking, it was a street close to people's livelihood needs.

Because merchants in Zone A were all small clients, the characteristic was having many storefronts, but each occupied a small area. Shop faces were next to each other, densely packed, but the usable area of each shop face was only thirty square meters. The total occupied area was the smallest among the four business zones.

Some shop faces here had already been rented, hanging simple signboards. Some didn't even have signboards, just hanging a shop banner with words like "Patterned Cloth," "Raw Silk" marking the goods types.

"The rent here is very cheap. If unwilling to rent long-term, we also set up stalls for short-term rental—that open ground is the place for setting up stalls. However, things sold here are mostly handmade, small in quantity. If bulk commodities are needed, they can't bring them out, and buyers from the sea won't look at them either."

South of Zone A were the remaining three zones in order. Zone B mainly dealt in light textile raw materials: such as cotton, cotton yarn, silkworm cocoons, raw silk, wool, hemp thread... planned area was the largest; Zone C mainly sold various textile finished and semi-finished products, various cotton, woolen, yarn, cloth, silk, satin, etc. were all sold here.

As for the final Zone D, it sold textile machinery, from huge iron-wood looms to small machine needles and parts; all could be found inside. In the future, various chemical products for textile use, such as dyes and sizing agents, were also prepared to be sold.

Compared to the first three zones, the architectural style of Zone D also changed greatly. The first three zones were all two-story small buildings, first floor for shop face, second floor for office or storage. The style was Qilou [Arcade] style; the extended corridor could provide shade for pedestrians, considered commercial and residential architecture relatively suitable for the south.

Arriving at Zone D, because it involved display and storage of machinery equipment, it was no longer Qilou architecture, but truss-style warehouse buildings.

"This Australian architectural design is ingenious. If there are such wide eaves to provide shade for people in the scorching summer, it's actually not bad." Wu Yijun appraised this Australian-Song style architecture which was quite peculiar, admiring it considerably. In old timeline history, Qilou only appeared in the 19th century, spreading in Guangdong with the introduction of European architecture; originally it didn't exist in this timeline.

Although the entire market area hadn't opened yet, recruitment for rental started more than a month ago. Therefore, tentatively no shops were open. But well-informed merchants, some had already taken down their favored shop faces, some were still patrolling here, hoping to find a feng shui treasure land.

This project pushed strongly by Australians didn't need too much promotion for merchants with sensitive noses. The Australians' brains were obviously not just on reshaping Guangzhou's textile trade; afraid they had even bigger plans. The business opportunities within were self-evident.

The three people looked at flowers from horseback [glanced roughly], touring all zones roughly, and finally came to the Merchant Guild Zone in the west.

Buildings in the Merchant Guild Zone were more exquisite, mostly stone-built European-style buildings with different styles, no longer uniform Qilou or warehouse-style buildings.

An Jiu took the uncle and nephew to the first building in the West Zone. This building was the plainest in the whole row of buildings. An Jiu said this was the market's management company. Although hanging the sign of "Light Textile Market Co., Ltd.," actually the biggest shareholder and main operator behind it was the Cooperative Society Co., Ltd. So beside the door there was a second sign "Cooperative Society Co., Ltd. Guangzhou Branch."

There was a small square in front of the building. A flagpole stood in the center, flying the Morning Star Flag. Huge display boards stood at the edge of the square, hanging rows of wooden tablets.

"What is this?" Chen Lin asked curiously. He saw written on them lint cotton, clean cotton, cotton cloth, dried cocoons... etc., but there were still empty hanging spots behind, obviously other content hadn't been hung up yet.

"This is the market reference price, provided weekly by the Bureau of Statistics..."

The Bureau of Statistics would provide reference prices for various markets based on price data collected daily from main commodity distribution centers and consumption places like Guangzhou, Foshan, and Lingao. Mainly to provide a reference price for merchants and customers, preventing fraud caused by information inequality, trying to create an atmosphere of fair trade.

"Then what does this 'A-1 Standard Cotton Cloth' mean?" Chen Lin asked. His family wanted to transform into the cotton cloth business now, so naturally he cared about cotton cloth prices, but here there was only written one Standard Cotton Cloth, without other information.

"Standard Cotton Cloth refers to arranging a certain number of warp and weft yarns per square centimeter, reaching a certain range of weight; this is called Standard Cotton Cloth." An Jiu explained. Australian-Song Standard Cotton Cloth had several specifications, from A-1 to B-3, not necessarily woven into 20*20.

"Is it the 'Sheng' [unit] of official cloth?" Chen Lin asked. Before the Single Whip Method was implemented, cloth had always been one of the important taxes. The government had set standards; not only width and length had standards, but warp yarns within a certain width also had standards. Generally, 80 warp yarns were one Sheng. Specific measures of each dynasty and region had slight differences.

"Comparatively similar, but weft yarns also have to be counted in; generally speaking, there are differences." An Jiu pointed to the three words 'Reference Price' on the board and said: "This is just a reference. If you can make better things, naturally you can sell for higher prices. Those not meeting standards naturally can't sell for high prices; it depends on whether the buyer knows the goods."

The second room at the head of the row of Qilou in the Merchant Guild Zone hung a golden anchor at the doorway. An Jiu introduced: "This is the Penglai Company where I will take office in the future. Wait until my internship at the Nansha Cotton Textile Factory ends, I will formally join here. In the future, if you have anything to find me, you can come to this company—nine out of ten I won't be in..." An Jiu told a cold joke. Discovering the uncle and nephew didn't catch the laughing point, she immediately added a sentence, "Best to make an appointment beforehand; our work is very busy. Since we are all here, let's go in and sit first."

An Jiu said and led them into the reception hall on the first floor. People came and went in the reception hall; some obviously foreign faces also entered and exited here. The reception hall was partitioned into many single rooms along the courtyard using screens. An Jiu took them into a single room.

Chen Lin looked around and saw several signs hanging on the screen in the courtyard facing the main gate, written with "Lingao Penglai Shipping Co., Ltd.," "Penglai Development Co., Ltd.," "Penglai Investment Co., Ltd.," etc., several company names.

"What's the difference between so many companies?" Chen Lin was a bit confused seeing this. Wasn't Penglai Company just Penglai Company?
