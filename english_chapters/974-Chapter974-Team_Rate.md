# Chapter 974 - Team Rate

"Heaven is collecting souls in this tribulation," said an older-looking rider with a sigh. "I hear Hebei and Shanxi have also erupted in chaos."

"Everyone eat, drink, and rest up for the road!" The speaker was tall and imposing, yet quite young—only about twenty-four or twenty-five. With sword-like eyebrows and tiger eyes, he was a man of striking appearance. Once he spoke, everyone else fell silent—clearly he was the leader of the group.

They ordered food from the attendant: only flatbreads and hard buns, with pickled vegetables, garlic in sauce, and other coarse fare. No vegetables, and certainly no meat. In a disaster year, even the common pancakes that local farmers usually ate had become black and coarse, mixed with who knew how much ground bark and grass roots. Black, hard, and dry—not just the three women, even the other riders grimaced as they ate, washing it down with tea.

The young woman who had spoken earlier frowned as she ate. After a few bites, she simply stopped eating.

"Eat up. There's still food here—further ahead, who knows, we might have to eat human flesh." The lead young man showed his teeth in a smile. It was unspeakably sinister.

"Human flesh"—the three words swept through the awning like a chill wind, making everyone's hair stand on end, all coolness gone.

"You... you're joking..." The young woman forced a smile.

The middle-aged man with the local accent said: "Ten-odd years ago, during the local war troubles, it actually happened. They used human flesh as dumpling filling. When it came out, the local magistrate had them arrested, and I hear they were sentenced to death by a thousand cuts."

The young woman looked disgusted, then glanced at the food on the table—all vegetarian, so presumably no human flesh.

The group stopped talking and focused on eating. The lead young man ate while watching outside the awning, as if waiting for someone.

After the time it takes to finish a meal, another person entered from outside—dressed like a small peddler. He looked around, then walked directly toward the two tables where the riders sat.

"Pardon me, sorry to intrude." He smiled ingratiatingly toward the middle-aged man with the local accent. "Such hot weather—you've all worked hard."

The middle-aged man surprisingly didn't object, allowing him to sit down.

When the attendant came over, the peddler smiled apologetically: "Just a bowl of water will do. Nothing else."

A bowl of plain water was free at the tea stall, though naturally the attendant wouldn't show a pleasant face for it. A large, coarse, black-glazed bowl filled with water was brought over. The peddler thanked him profusely, pulled out a wotou bun as black as mud from his pocket, and ate it with the water.

"Doing business outside in this scorching heat? Such hardship."

"If I don't work a day, I don't eat a day," the peddler said.

"Yizhou is a dead zone right now—what kind of business can you do here?" The middle-aged man sneered coldly.

"A tiny capital-and-profit business—too embarrassing to mention," the peddler said with a fawning smile. "I get by through diligent legwork." As he spoke, his chopsticks traced a symbol on the table.

The middle-aged man's eyes flickered; he glanced at the lead young man, who nodded. The middle-aged man immediately laughed heartily: "You say you're getting by, yet you can't even afford tea." He picked up the teapot and filled the peddler's bowl with tea.

"Thank you for your kindness, sir." The peddler smiled, raised the tea bowl, and washed down the black bun in a few gulps. He expressed thanks, stood, and left.

The peddler followed the official road onward. After two or three *li*, he turned onto a side path and sat down in a small grove, fanning himself with his straw hat. Before long, the riders from the tea stall followed his trail.

Neither party spoke. The peddler led the way on foot—he moved with flying step, quickly guiding the riders to an ordinary farmhouse courtyard. Before he could knock, the gate opened by itself.

The small courtyard was extremely secluded—trees on three sides, facing a small river on the fourth. Beyond the trees lay open fields. The place was completely invisible from the main road. Once the summer crops grew tall, it would be virtually swallowed up in the green.

The riders entered the courtyard. Inside was a very ordinary farmhouse: three low rooms with thatched roofs, rammed-earth walls, scattered straw and farm tools in the courtyard, a stone mill in the corner. It appeared to be a middling peasant household—but appearances were deceiving.

"Please come inside." The peddler knocked lightly at the door a few times before speaking.

Once inside, they discovered these small buildings, outwardly shabby as worn cotton, were inwardly like a wealthy household's home. The so-called mud walls, broken bricks, and thatched roof were just facades to fool the eye.

The floor inside was lower than outside, so being inside didn't feel oppressive.

Not only was the decor luxurious, but every piece of furniture and ornament was exquisite.

On the central redwood table, two tables' worth of fine dishes had already been laid out, with several maidservants pouring drinks. Even more impressive—large blocks of ice were placed in the center of the room, emitting white vapor. Coming in from the blazing sun, everyone immediately felt refreshingly cool.

"A modest spread—please don't take offense." The peddler smiled. "Please have some food and wine, and rest a bit. The Altar Chief will come to meet you shortly." With that, he slipped away and vanished.

"Everyone sit," the lead young man gestured to the group, acting more like the host than a guest. "Come, come, sit down, don't be polite, eat. Those dry pancakes on the road were ruining my teeth. Come, pour tea for everyone!"

The group sat down. The young woman looked at the meat dishes on the table with some hesitation. The lead young man laughed, picked up a piece of meat, and put it in his mouth:

"Don't worry—this is premium yellow beef."

The middle-aged man said quietly: "Just eat like this?"

"It's fine," the young man nodded. "Just don't drink the wine."

They had eaten only coarse food along the way—barely enough to fill their stomachs. Now with such a fine banquet before them, everyone ate heartily, like wind sweeping away clouds. In moments, everything was cleaned up.

The dishes were certainly delicious, but to prepare such a feast in this disaster-stricken wasteland demonstrated the host's resources and capability quite clearly.

After the meal, the peddler returned silently to the hall.

"The Altar Chief has arrived and is waiting for you, sir."

"Good."

"The Altar Chief will see only you, sir..." the peddler said with an apologetic smile. "Please understand."

"No problem." The lead young man nodded. "Lead the way."

The peddler brought him to a side door, knocked, and pushed it open. Inside was another elegant room. Someone was already waiting. Unremarkable in appearance, about forty years old, his face had an unfathomable, sinister, intimidating aura.

Beside him stood a young girl in red, wearing her hair in maiden's style, carrying a long sword on her back. On either side stood eight burly men—a configuration like stars surrounding the moon.

"This is the Soul-Searching Sword, Min Zhanlian," the peddler reported respectfully.

"Oh." The middle-aged man's gaze swept over the visitor. "Long have I heard the name."

Min Zhanlian nodded casually: "No need for courtesy." He showed no intention of bowing in greeting.

"Impudent!" The red-clad girl scolded. "You meet the Venerable One and don't pay respects!"

Min Zhanlian smirked, seated himself in the guest chair without a word, and addressed the middle-aged man: "You summoned me here—what exactly needs to be done? Which deity is the target?"

Seeing herself ignored, the red-clad girl stepped forward, but a look from the middle-aged man stopped her.

"Young man, you have quite the nerve. But nerve and arrogance are only a hair apart." The middle-aged man spoke with forced composure. "Our sect is in need of talent, so this humble seat won't quibble over small matters with you."

Min Zhanlian put on an expression of impatience. "Just tell me, old man—who do you want killed? If you just say useless things like this, how can I give you a quote? In our line of work, time is money. I can't just sit here chatting with you. Please understand!"

Anger flashed in the middle-aged man's eyes, but they were currently in need of talent. This Min Zhanlian, nicknamed "Soul-Searching Sword" in the *jianghu*, was a famous assassin whose starting price was one hundred taels per life. His movements were unpredictable and his work was prolific—hiring him wasn't easy.

"It's this person." At his signal, someone brought a scroll.

On the scroll, done in plain brushwork, was a half-body portrait of Master Daoquan.

"A Daoist priest."

"Correct. His lay surname is Zhang; his Daoist name is Daoquanzi," the middle-aged man said. "He came from Jiangnan. But his accent is strange—we don't know exactly where he's from."

Min Zhanlian nodded to show he understood. He asked:

"Where is this person now?"

The middle-aged man told him about the Daoist temple where Daoquanzi was staying.

"I've already had people watching him. We know his movements every day."

"Good, now let's talk business," Min Zhanlian said.

"One hundred taels per life. I'll pay one hundred taels."

"Hmph. That's the base price. How much this person's life is actually worth—I'll know after my people take a look." Min Zhanlian chuckled. "Killing a farmer and killing a *jianghu* master are both one hundred taels—wouldn't I be taking a big loss?"

"He's just a Daoist priest with some medical skills..."

"If it were that simple, why would you need to hire me? Don't you have your own desperate killers?" Min Zhanlian sneered. People who came to him to buy lives had either underestimated their target or didn't want to show themselves. The assassination target was never a simple person.

In the *jianghu*, monks and Daoists were generally not people to trifle with. The other side had considerable power in southern Shandong yet had summoned him from afar—this so-called Master Zhang was definitely no ordinary good person.

"Fine. How much do you want?"

"I told you—I'll calculate after my people take a look." Min Zhanlian said. "However, starting from this moment, I'm charging fees."

"What? Charging before the job's done?" The middle-aged man finally couldn't help protesting.

"Of course. My men also need to eat and drink—they can't serve on empty stomachs." Min Zhanlian said. "My brothers all have special abilities. I need their assistance when I work. Starting now, seven taels three *qian* silver per day. Calculated daily, charged daily."
