# Chapter 1587 - Action Plan

"The defense situation of the gymnasium is like this." Zhuo Yifan said. He had revealed all the intelligence on the Bandits he had gathered through various means in recent days for others to reference in planning the action plan. He emphasized his impressions of the Cultural Festival activities and the situation that the Bandits did not set up strict sentries at the gymnasium.

Several people surrounding a table in a small room in the backyard of the Huang Family Medicine Shop remained silent, staring deadly at the crooked floor plan drawn on the rough-edged paper.

In the shop front outside, although it was already night, it was still very lively. There were people entering and leaving to see doctors and buy medicine. Voices came faintly.

Thick curtains hung on the windows, and disciples were on guard outside. They could discuss the details of the next action with confidence and boldness.

"Zhongjun, add another candle." Sima Qiudao broke the silence.

Several "Australian foreign candles" had already been lit in the room. Although not as "bright as day" as the gas lamps in the shop front, it was considered very bright.

Huang Zhen opened his mouth and said: "Young Hero Zhuo indeed has talent surpassing others. Being able to glean so much inside information on the Bandits from that Fake Bandit constable is truly a great contribution!"

"Where, where, it was just by chance!" Zhuo Yifan said modestly.

Wanli Feng said: "What the Young Hero said, at this juncture of the Cultural Festival, True Bandits and Fake Bandits gathered in one place, it is indeed a great opportunity for us to strike, it's just..."

"Just what?"

"Since this 'Cultural Festival' is a grand event for the Bandits, as the Young Hero said, with a large number of True Bandits present in person, obviously the arrangement at that time will not be like usual. At that gathering place, there must be soldiers carrying Australian firelocks for protection. The Bandit music bands and opera troupes also move in large groups. If we act rashly, I'm afraid we'll have to knaw on hard bones!" Wanli Feng, after all, had seasoned Jianghu experience and pointed out the key to the problem in one sentence.

"Indeed not easy to handle." Sima Qiudao frowned, "According to the news collected by Young Hero Zhuo and sent from Old Man Shi's side, during the three days of official performance, the Bandit's Garrison Battalion, Police, and Army will place heavy troops around the venue. Even if we can mix into the square, once we start, the losses won't be small, and I'm afraid it will be difficult to retreat completely."

The floor plan in front of them was drawn by combining the intelligence they had scouted themselves these days and the intelligence sent by Old Man Shi.

It looked like there was simply no opportunity to exploit. Even in the square, there were hundreds of guards in "bright helmets and armor" alone. Old Man Shi's intelligence said that there must be many plainclothes personnel on the scene.

Although Old Man Shi's intelligence said clearly that no special personnel would be set up to interrogate in the square at that time, and superficially entry and exit were free, in reality, it was loose on the outside and tight on the inside. Any slight abnormality would lead to arrest.

As for entering the gymnasium, it was even more impossible. The intelligence showed that everyone entering the gymnasium at that time had to hold a ticket. Those without tickets were categorically not allowed to enter. Moreover, the internal defenses were stricter, and even Old Man Shi did not have detailed intelligence.

Looking at this map, the four people all sucked in a breath of cold air. Originally thought that entering the gymnasium to assassinate was seeking one's own death, now it seemed that even taking action in the square was a narrow escape from death.

Although there were many crowds and the Bandits' firearms could not function effectively, they had the advantage of numbers. No matter how great one's own skills were, there was no chance of winning one against ten.

"We masters are afraid we are going to end up here." Huang Zhen touched his smooth chin again—local naturalized citizens did not have the habit of growing beards, which indirectly influenced the custom, and even fewer indigenous people grew beards. You Xiu especially disliked beards. To please this middle-aged widow, Huang Zhen had shaved off his beard recently. It was just that his chin felt chilly, and he always felt a little unaccustomed.

His tone revealed unwillingness and regret. Originally, Hero Huang held himself very steady. In order to have cover in Nanbao and facilitate gathering news, he inevitably dealt insincerely with Director You's overtures. He originally thought he could hold himself steady, but unexpectedly, one was a single man and the other was a resentment-filled woman. He couldn't withstand You Xiu's several flirtations and finally rolled in the sheets.

Huang Zhen prided himself on being an upright gentleman. Now that he had done such illicit things, although there was the "unavoidable" difficulty of "being diligent in the King's orders", and it was just acting on the spot, he felt some guilt after all. Seeing him unhappy, You Xiu thought something didn't suit his wishes. Not only did she fawn on him in bed, but she was also quite attentive in daily life, sending things over from time to time, and taking his torn clothes to wash. How could Huang Zhen withstand such wearing down in a gentle village? Plus the business was surprisingly smooth, the heroism of "how can you catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den" had disappeared mostly. Although he hadn't gone so far as to forget his mission, he looked forward to these days continuing day by day.

Seeing that these good days were not only going to end now, but inevitably there would be a bloody bitter battle, and might even result in being buried in a foreign land. Thinking of this, the tens of thousands of feet of heroism when setting off originally had retreated eighty percent.

"If too many people die and hurt the vitality of various sects, we masters won't be able to go back and explain to the seniors. We can only die in this place ourselves." How could Sima Qiudao not know Huang Zhen's thoughts? Even he himself didn't want to "be loyal" right here. So although he spoke boldly, there was a meaning of shrinking back.

Zhuo Yifan nodded: "This matter needs to be discussed at length. There must be a foolproof method..."

A tacit understanding had been reached between the words of the four people. Sima Qiudao closed his eyes for a while, then opened his eyes and said: "A few days ago, Righteous Man Gou who escorted us leaving Lingao has already been to Nanbao."

"Oh? Where is he now?" Zhuo Yifan asked.

"He refused to say where he stayed and didn't come here. We contacted in the teahouse." Sima Qiudao said, "Righteous Man Gou has already arranged the route and contact signals."

"Oh? How to act?"

"He said he couldn't stay locally for long: the Bandits hate him to the bone and have been offering rewards for his capture. Therefore, he can only wait in the Li area. He will meet us at the border when the time comes. As long as we can escape and reach the designated place, he will have prepared clothes, food, and weapons."

"Unexpectedly, there is still such a loyal and righteous man in the Bandit's heartland!" Wanli Feng praised.

"He wants us to be careful at all times. The Bandits are incomparably cunning with nets spread everywhere, not comparable to ordinary bandits. He wants us to only take by wit, not attack by force. Otherwise, even burning jade and stone together is not to be sought. To deal with the Bandits, one must win by surprise to have a few percent of certainty. Regardless of success or failure, leave immediately after one strike, absolutely must not delay and wait."

The other few people nodded. Needless to say, they had already personally felt the formidability of the Bandits.

Zhuo Yifan muttered: "Righteous Man Gou is extremely right. To succeed, we still have to win by surprise. The True Bandits live in seclusion on ordinary days. Only taking advantage of this juncture of the Cultural Festival when many True Bandits will come to watch is the opportunity to strike, it's just..."

The problem of "it's just", they had all discussed just now. Once they took action, it would be a narrow escape. Moreover, there might not be much certainty. Sima Qiudao, Huang Zhen, and Wanli Feng all stared at him, seeing what brilliant plan he had.

"Zhuo unintentionally learned from that young girl that the day before the Cultural Festival, the Bandits will organize a dress rehearsal, that is, the original cast going on stage to rehearse. It's just that there is no formal audience offstage. At that time, True and Fake Bandits from all walks of participation will go to that gymnasium together. If we disguise and ambush in separate groups, striking on the road, the Bandits can't set up defenses everywhere!" Zhuo Yifan's plan was decided, appearing quite confident in his words.

When these Jianghu heroes first arrived in Lingao, they were unfamiliar and fearful of the Bandits' various strange skills and excessive ingenuity, and had great psychological pressure. But after "doing business" locally for a period of time, they gradually became familiar with some laws of this land. Added with the large amount of intelligence provided by Zhuo Yifan, the knights walked out of the initial confusion and recovered part of confidence in completing the task.

"This plan is excellent! At that time, if the local insiders respond by taking the opportunity, it will definitely make the Bandits unable to attend to both head and tail!" Huang Zhen twirled his non-existent beard, eyes shooting out refined light.

"Furthermore, I observed that the females among those juvenile Fake Bandits all wear strange Australian clothes. If we can kidnap one or two on the way and let Junior Sister Zhou and others change into that 'uniform', it can also confuse the Bandits. It is said that the Bandits are lewd by nature and have no guard against beautiful women..."

Zhuo Yifan lowered his tone, but several listeners showed expressions of understanding.

"How to act?" Sima Qiudao asked.

"First ask the female disciples to change the Bandit attire." Zhuo Yifan said, "Women changing attire doesn't require shaving heads, just changing a hairstyle and changing clothes. Bandits don't like bound feet. Fake Bandit women either have natural feet or unbound feet. Fortunately, the female disciples of our various sects all have unbound feet, so this can be muddled through."

"Actually, we masters can also change appearance and disguise..." Huang Zhen said, "Director You advised me several times to shave hair and change clothes."

"Brother Huang doesn't need to. Someone also needs to respond here in Nanbao. You just preside over the situation here and wait quietly for our arrival."

"Good." Huang Zhen nodded.

Then the plan was set: divide the personnel into several teams. Nan Wan'er leads a number of female disciples to stand by in the square in front of the gymnasium, ready to act on signal at any time; female disciples such as Zhou Zhongjun led by Sima Qiudao, waiting for an opportunity to ambush Bandit female students, obtain uniforms, disguise, and then go to the square to stand by.

Abbess Miejing leads a team herself to respond at the intersection outside the gymnasium, firstly to intercept the Bandit's reinforcements, and secondly to meet the fellow daoists escaping from the field.

Sha Guangtian and Meng Bofei each lead a team to operate in various places in East Gate Market. Once the signal rises, they will attack and kill Bandit police, set fire to create chaos, and attract Bandit attention.

Wanli Feng leads a few people to stay at the inn, playing the Empty Fort Strategy. Once chaos arises, set fire to the inn, then rush onto the market street to create chaos.

"Zhuo himself will also wait for the opportunity in the square with several heroes." Zhuo Yifan assigned everything properly, "Everyone must act according to the signal!"

The signal was the special "Double-Kick" firecracker they brought secretly. After rising into the sky, it could emit three consecutive bangs.

"At that time, regardless of success or failure, I will release the second Double-Kick. No matter what everyone is doing, you must flee immediately!" Zhuo Yifan enjoined, "Must leave East Gate Market before the Bandits react!"
