# Chapter 451 - Autumn Levy (Part 2)

"I fear Old Eight's greed will be insatiable this year!" Liu Youren said with a dark expression. "These Australians have truly placed their trust in the wrong person."

"Master Liu, you're overthinking this," Zhang Youfu consoled him. "As for the grain levy, things will be handled the same way they always have been. What's so troubling about that? Could Old Eight suddenly change his nature?"

"Hmph, as if I don't know what kind of person Old Eight is?" Liu Youren said coldly. "He's the type who loves to ride on others' coattails. Now that he's latched onto the big tree of the Australians, things are going to get out of hand. Just wait and see—he won't stop until he causes a proper mess." With that, he stamped his foot and departed.

Zhang Youfu didn't try to detain him. Instead, he hurried off to report to Wu De.

Wu De gave an enigmatic smile and merely said, "There's something you should remember from now on. I've gone on a trip—traveling a long road. So there's no need to come looking for me for the time being."

"Yes, yes," Zhang Youfu replied without quite understanding, simply agreeing.

"However, if anything comes up, you are to report to my secretary, Chuyu, at once. Understood?"

"This humble one understands, this humble one understands." He knew Chuyu—she had been a maidservant at the Gou Manor and was now Wu De's favored bedchamber attendant. Zhang Youfu was well aware that the Australians didn't mind women taking charge of affairs; there were even women among them who appeared in public and served as leaders.

Wu De gave him some further instructions, and Zhang Youfu nodded repeatedly.

Finally, Wu De asked one more question: "You've joined the Tiandihui, haven't you?"

"That's correct; actually, my land holdings weren't quite enough to qualify." Zhang Youfu explained that his membership was purely a matter of showing support. Yet since joining, the Tiandihui had been remarkably diligent—people came by regularly to advise his farmhands on cultivation, and from time to time they delivered new things like fertilizer. The crops on his several dozen *mu* of land were now thriving.

"Prepare a room. The Tiandihui is sending someone to stay at your home and provide guidance at all times."

"Yes." Zhang Youfu understood this person would be there to keep an eye on him. However, since they were stationing someone at his home, there was clearly a significant agenda behind this grain levy business. He probed tentatively, "Should this humble one inform him every time I meet with the grain households?"

"He's there to help you farm. Other matters are none of his concern. Remember, if anything comes up, go to Chuyu."

Chen Minggang himself had received word through Zhou Qi that Master Xiong had approved his proposal to contract out this year's tax levy. He was quite pleased. He had his own calculations: in the past, although he had profited handsomely from the grain levy through various manipulations, his takings were still somewhat inferior compared to Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Wenchang—counties with larger populations and more farmland. Most of the local landlords here maintained fortified villages for self-defense, and the court's prestige didn't carry much weight. After a round of grain collection, once he distributed shares to his underlings and enforcers, the real profit in his pocket was only two or three hundred *shi*. For someone like Chen Minggang, who had visited Qiongshan's prefectural seat and even traveled to Guangzhou, who had seen something of the world, this was a bit disappointing.

Now, the Australians had appeared most opportunely. These Australians were hard customers—courteous enough in everyday dealings, but when it came to killing and burning, they didn't so much as blink. Whether attacking Gou Family Manor or exterminating bandits, they were utterly ruthless about killing and seizing property, thoroughly terrifying the local gentry. This time, Chen Minggang felt he finally had a powerful backer.

The government yamen was a place that could easily be bought off, but the Australians, apparently, could not be bribed. Chen Minggang was an observant man. He could see that although the Australians appeared courteous and honest, at their core they were people for whom profit was paramount.

As long as something or someone could deliver sufficient benefit to them, the Australians would protect it.

This time, through contracting the grain levy, he would give the Australians their full share of profit while also fully exploiting their "prestige" to make a killing over the next several years.

Chen Minggang reckoned that given the government's efficiency and the Australians' military power, even if the Great Ming managed to drive them out, it would be at least three to five years before that happened. It was entirely possible that the Australians, like the Portuguese, might simply settle down permanently in Lingao.

Even if the Australians eventually packed up and left, Chen Minggang himself wouldn't suffer the slightest loss. At worst, if his reputation became too tarnished, he'd simply resign his post, let his apprentice Zhou Qi serve as a figurehead for a while, and then have his son succeed him. As long as he held the Fish-Scale Register in his hands, no matter who became emperor, this position of Household Clerk would remain his family's. After all, his family had already survived two dynastic changes since the Song dynasty; a few more wouldn't make any difference.

This was precisely the clever scheme Chen Minggang had in mind. But as for how to please the Australians, how large their appetite was, and how far they would let him go—he still needed to probe and find out.

He instructed Zhou Qi to summon all his apprentices and the county's grain runners to his private residence—which was Qiuhong's home. After his wife's last outburst, Chen Minggang had simply brought everything into the open and moved openly into Qiuhong's residence. He had even given a word to the constables' squad leader to look out for the place. Although his wife and her relatives were resentful, there was nothing they could do. Zhang Wu had tried to make trouble several times, but each time he was suppressed by the squad leader. Zhang Shi, wary of gossip among colleagues, was also reluctant to continue supporting his brother and sister's agitation. The two sides had lapsed into a cold standoff.

---

After a few days, all the grain runners from various parts arrived. Lingao County originally had nearly thirty grain runners, divided into two groups. One group consisted of "contracting households"—generally petty rural landlords who, through collusion with Chen Minggang or by virtue of having numerous strong-armed clansmen capable of dominating the countryside, had obtained this position. The other group were urban and rural hoodlums and down-and-out riffraff, including some exiled convicts who served as enforcers during grain collection.

This gathering was already missing half its usual number. Many of these men had previously colluded with bandits. The recent bandit-suppression campaign had launched a large-scale, mass-mobilization "Root Out Bandits" movement, and several had been executed or arrested. Others, who had no connection to bandits but had accumulated deep popular resentment over years of extortionate grain collection, had also been seized by the masses under the pretext of having collaborated with bandits and summarily executed. The work teams were happy with this outcome—it gave them a convenient pretext to eliminate several local strongmen.

The grain runners who did show up were still jittery from the rural campaigns and terrified of the Australians as if they were tigers. In particular, there was a female Baldy-bandit named Du Wen who simply made everyone tremble with fear. It was said that several men who had tasted her iron kicks wouldn't be capable of being anything but eunuchs in their next lives.

They had been anxious and uncertain about their future. Now, suddenly receiving a summons from Clerk Chen for a meeting about the grain levy, each of them felt their spirits revive. They dressed in their best clothes and arrived eagerly to discuss business.

As this crowd gathered, buzzing with conversation, they swapped tales about recent changes around them—who had died, who had been arrested and whose whereabouts remained unknown... Being able to meet again, and hearing that they could continue handling the grain levy, they felt as if the clouds had parted to reveal the sun.

When Chen Minggang saw that everyone had arrived, he cleared his throat and got down to business.

He spoke about how the Australians intended to contract the grain levy this year. The attendees had already heard rumors about this before arriving. When they learned they would be working for the Australians, far from feeling any shame at becoming "collaborators with the Australian invaders," they were positively elated—now they could establish connections with the Australians! Not only could they continue in their positions, but they could also seize the opportunity to make a fortune.

"...But we still don't fully understand the Australians' temperament. The reason I've called everyone here is to work out a proper plan so that we can negotiate with their leaders."

After some discussion, since the Australians would be handling the overall contract this time, the individual contracting households would no longer manage things directly. Although secondary subcontracting was possible, everyone agreed that for their first time working for the Australians, they should be careful. Rather than scheming over subcontracting and "padded margins," it would be better to focus entirely on collection. Doing a solid job of levying a sum of grain for the Australians was the priority.

"But how much should it be?" someone asked.

"From what I gathered from Chief Xiong, the intention is to include the 'Reasonable Burden' portion alongside the levy. That comes to three thousand '*gongshi*'," Zhou Qi explained.

"That's too little." If it were only that much, why would the Australians bother contracting the levy? Clearly, they had much larger expectations.

"Exactly. We need to at least double it for the Australian masters to recognize our worth."

"Then we'll have to increase the amount of tribute rice. The old rate of adding three *dou* per *shi* of the basic quota definitely won't be enough." Among them were several who were skilled at mental arithmetic, and they quickly calculated the figures.

One of the grain runners, nicknamed "Umbrella-Shop Little Hu," said, "Eighth Master! If we simply do things the old way this year, I don't think we'll be able to squeeze out much profit."

The Magistrate's customary share of benefits had to come from somewhere, and the Australians' "Reasonable Burden" was also a substantial sum. Naturally, this gang of men also wanted to make some money on the side. If they simply followed past precedents, their only option was to add more tribute rice.

Adding tribute rice wasn't a major issue, but the defenseless small households had already been squeezed to the point of gasping for breath. Pressing them further wouldn't yield much, and might even provoke them to go crying to the Australians. The larger households could certainly afford to pay more—not only did they pay less tribute rice to begin with, but they also had plenty of privately cultivated hidden fields and land sheltered under others' names. However, these households had already been giving regular benefits for years. Increasing their levy without cause would inevitably breed resentment and make future dealings difficult...

Zhou Qi said, "What's there to fear? If anyone refuses to pay more, just get the Australians involved. Then they'll end up like Gou Family Manor—see whose neck is still stiff enough to resist—"

"One mustn't burn all bridges." Chen Minggang shook his head. "Stirring things up isn't hard, but everyone here still has to make a living in Lingao going forward. When the Australians leave, what will you do?"

Umbrella-Shop Little Hu said, "We absolutely must come up with some pretext. Only then can we approach the major households and leave them with nothing to say. This way, we'll also have room to maneuver in the future."

Chen Minggang nodded. Little Hu had good instincts—much sharper than his own apprentices. Too bad the man was a cripple and couldn't be put forward. Thinking of this, he glanced at Zhou Qi and couldn't help feeling a wave of distaste toward his eldest apprentice.
