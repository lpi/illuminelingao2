# Chapter 2731: The Capital (Part 83)

That night, just after the second watch, Li Rufeng suddenly summoned the bureau manager: "Old Zheng, tell the kitchen to cook by headcount! Half a *jin* of stewed meat per person, and two *jin* of wheat flour cakes! Also prepare fifty wine gourds, all filled with strong liquor!"

"Cook?" Old Zheng was startled. The escort bureau didn't do business at night, let alone go out, to avoid trouble.

"That's right, cook." Li Rufeng's eyes gleamed bright and sharp. "Send someone to wake all the escort masters resting in their rooms. Full equipment, weapons ready. No one may wear clothes with logos, carry personal items, or bring weapons with identifying marks. No noise, no lights. In fifteen minutes, everyone meets me in the main hall!"

Old Zheng knew the bureau must have a major operation tonight. He immediately roused himself, first waking the servants under him, then sending men room by room to wake people.

Not counting the servants, the bureau had fifty-five men capable of combat—whether escort masters or hired fighters. Three had either taken leave to go home or stayed out overnight because they couldn't return in time.

In just fifteen minutes, the main hall was packed with a sea of heads.

The lamps weren't turned up, so the hall was dim, faces indistinct, creating an eerie atmosphere.

Li Rufeng clasped his fists and bowed to everyone. "Greetings, brothers!"

Everyone knew being summoned at this hour meant a secret matter. No one spoke, only returning the salute with clasped fists. A collective "swish" sounded through the hall.

"...Calling you up in the dead of night is for a major matter." Li Rufeng's eyes swept over everyone. "I don't need to say it—you all know. For the past month, our entire bureau has been busy with this one thing."

Though they had been ordered not to make noise, a low buzzing still rose among them.

"Now we have the information. It's time for us brothers to show our skills. Shortly, I will lead men to rescue the hostage. I need forty brothers to fight. I know you're all brave men who want this honor. But the bureau can't be left unguarded. So everyone draws lots—those who draw will come with me; those who don't will stay to guard the bureau."

As he spoke, someone brought a jar. Everyone drew in turn, and soon they were divided into two groups: forty to go, twelve to stay.

Regardless of whether they drew "go" or "stay," everyone's expression was complicated.

Those who drew "go" naturally knew tonight would bring a fight with uncertain life or death, but afterward, the employer would give generous rewards. It all depended on whether you had the fate to enjoy that fortune. Those who drew "stay"—though they didn't have to risk their lives in the cold—would only be able to watch others count their silver when the brothers returned victorious tomorrow.

Li Rufeng looked at everyone's faces, then suddenly smiled. "What? Those going are afraid of dying? Those staying are afraid of missing the reward?"

This drew laughter from the hall. Someone immediately called out, "What can we do with our bad luck? The good fortune of getting rewards without risking our necks isn't for us!"

Li Rufeng said slowly, "That brother speaks well. We go out fighting through frost and snow just for a few taels of silver. These years, the escorting business has gotten harder day by day. It's all thanks to Delong backing us—giving us brothers a bowl of rice, keeping our families from cold and hunger, letting us walk respectably on the street where folks call us 'Constable, sir.' Now Delong's Manager Leng is in distress. We rescue Manager Leng—by feeling, it's 'accepting money to solve problems'; by principle, it protects our brothers' livelihoods."

He paused, then continued: "This rescue mission is very dangerous. If any brother doesn't want to go, I absolutely won't force you. Staying to guard the bureau is also contributing."

After that, he scanned everyone again. Seeing no one speak, he continued: "Every person in this hall—whether a full escort master or a good man who's come to help recently—you all know Heliansheng's rules. I won't repeat them. Just about this operation: Delong's Mister Wu has announced that if the hostage rescue succeeds, the person with the greatest merit gets one thousand taels."

At this, the entire hall stirred violently. Everyone's face showed greedy joy.

Li Rufeng was satisfied with this result. Once people's desires were inflamed, they would naturally fight for it. He continued: "Everyone who contributes in battle gets one hundred taels. Additional bounty for kills or captures: fifty taels each, no limit!"

The hall stirred again. The escort masters, somewhat listless from being woken in the middle of the night, now had blood pumping. If not for the ban on noise, they probably would have been howling enough to raise the roof.

"Those staying behind shouldn't be discouraged either. Tonight's guard duty pays fifty taels for escort masters, twenty taels for servants!"

The atmosphere in the room grew even more fervent. The escort masters rubbed their fists and palms, eager to rush out and fight immediately.

Seeing the mood was right, Li Rufeng ordered everyone to rest and eat first, ready to depart at any moment.

"Everyone eat your fill. Tonight there'll be no sleep, and for the next few days, everyone will have to work hard."

In the kitchen, the cooks roused themselves and prepared a good meal. Each person got a big bowl of stewed meat and two *jin* of wheat flour cakes. Fortunately, it was deep winter, and the cold storeroom behind the building could keep meat.

Heliansheng's bureau wasn't inside the city but was located in the suburb outside Chaoyang Gate Street. Chaoyang Gate was in the east of the city, with the meaning of "welcoming the rising sun." Grain from the south came along the Beijing-Hangzhou Canal via the Tonghui River to Tongxian, was loaded onto carts, and entered the capital through Chaoyang Gate. Besides grain, bulk goods transported on the Grand Canal mostly came through this gate. So placing the escort bureau here was not only convenient for transportation but also avoided the tight security inside the city—after all, escort bureaus mainly dealt with "bandits."

Li Rufeng ordered all horses and mules in the bureau brought out. With over forty people mobilizing, it couldn't be quiet. If the enemy had eyes nearby and word was sent by fast horse, the enemy would be prepared and the whole thing would fail. They had to act quickly.

Over forty riders left the bureau. First, they led their horses slowly. Only when all men and horses reached the main road did they mount up and gallop south.

At night, it was hard to see, but fortunately, the roads around the capital were well-maintained. There were no pedestrians or carts on the road at midnight. They only had to follow the gray road traces roughly. For easy identification, each escort master had luminous strips on chest and back. Thus, after galloping dozens of *li*, no one got lost.

When they reached Nanyuan, it was already past the third watch. Wu Cheng had been waiting by the roadside under the escort masters' protection. He'd been in the wilderness for half the night and was already pale from cold. Seeing them finally arrive, he was overjoyed: "Finally! This suffering—even for a thousand taels I wouldn't do it a second time..."

Li Rufeng had no time to chat with him. He asked the escort master: "What's the situation at Ningyou Temple?"

"All the same!"

Li Rufeng immediately ordered everyone to pass through a collapsed section of the earthen wall and enter Nanyuan.

"Everyone dismount! Bring only six fast horses with hooves wrapped and bits in mouth. Leave the rest of the horses and mules here!" Li Rufeng commanded. Galloping at night made too much noise and would alert those inside. It might even draw the garrison troops from the four gates.

"Everyone mask your faces! On the road, kill anyone you see!" He gave the order with murderous intent.

The group pushed through forests and grass, moving rapidly. Even Wu Cheng was carried along in the rush. As a Daoist, how could he endure such exertion? But thinking of the hundred taels after success, he managed to keep up with the team, supported by two escort masters.

Fortunately, they had this guide. During the day, the escort masters had made luminous markers along the route according to his directions. So the team's progress was unhindered. They reached the outskirts of Ningyou Temple just past four o'clock.

"What's the situation inside the temple?" he asked again.

"Same as before!"

Li Rufeng gathered several "leaders" from the group and made brief arrangements.

The assault was scheduled for the fifth watch. By then, the sky would be dimly lit, good for visibility. The night watchmen inside would be weary, waiting for shift change—a time when spirits were scattered.

"The situation inside the temple is unclear. Time is pressing, and we can't probe their defenses." He waved his hand, and people spread black cloth curtains around him to block light. He turned on a "hand lantern" and spread out a map—a rough sketch of Ningyou Temple drawn from Wu Cheng's description.

"This temple is quite large. From the mountain gate, there are three courtyards. But according to Old Daoist Wu, the only livable rooms are the main hall and the rear hall. In this cold, there won't be more than twenty guards. I estimate most of the guards and the 'hostage' are in the rear courtyard."

He used a twig to point on the map: "From what we've seen, they have one hidden sentry at the front courtyard's mountain gate and two lookouts on the main hall roof. The rear courtyard situation is unknown, but there's at least one sentry."

Chen Cui said: "The place isn't large; breaking in won't be hard. But from this forest to the temple gate is a full half *li*. As soon as dawn breaks, once the brothers leave the forest, the sentries will spot them. Also, there's no cover around. We can't pre-position ambush forces. If we don't act fast and fail to surround the whole temple, they might break through."

"And they have horses. If they break out on horseback, though we have horses too, chasing on horseback would make too much noise," Sun Changtou frowned. "Best to take them in the temple in one stroke."

"Using the darkness, we first hide near the temple. At first light, we move together," Chen Cui said. "Signal with a whistling arrow. I volunteer for the vanguard! I'll take down the sentries on the hall roof first."

He was from the "Mao Hulu" (climbing specialists). He was most agile at scaling walls and roofs. Since he volunteered, Li Rufeng wouldn't go against his wishes. He nodded immediately.

"Old Liu, you take the archers and watch around the temple. Shoot anyone who comes out! Don't let a single one escape!"

Liu Chang laughed: "Do I need to lead this personally? Let the lads handle it. I'll follow Master Chen up to the roof and provide covering fire. I guarantee no one runs out!"

With the plan set, Li Rufeng divided his men into six teams. Four archers watched the east and west sides of the temple. Six escort masters waited on horseback as reserve. The rest divided into two teams to storm the front and rear gates simultaneously.
