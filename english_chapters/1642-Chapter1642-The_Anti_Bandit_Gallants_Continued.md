# Chapter 1642 - The Anti-Bandit Gallants (Continued)

Huang Binkun was stunned, knowing the boy had misunderstood. He laughed bitterly: "Just go and inquire."

After the page boy left, he lay down to rest again, but as soon as he closed his eyes, all he saw were Lei Lunfu's resentful eyes and his hoarse, exhausted shouting. He had several nightmares in a row, so he simply stopped sleeping and went out for a walk to distract himself!

Huang Binkun strolled slowly alone on the streets of Guangzhou, feeling lost. The scholar who attacked him was dead—Huang Binkun didn't believe it was suicide; most likely the yamen runners had done something in secret. When he was in Lingao, he had vaguely heard that the hair-bandits had a blacklist with names of people opposing them. People on the hair-bandits' blacklist would die sooner or later.

He himself was probably on the hair-bandits' blacklist in Lingao. Thinking of this, he secretly lamented. This Scholar Lei dared to act and do, counting as a hero. Unlike himself, fleeing Lingao dejectedly, truly like a stray dog!

Strolling on the streets of Guangzhou he had just become familiar with, as a great city of the Southern Kingdom, although the area was vast and city walls tall, seemingly majestic, the whole city was filled with a lethargic air. Standing at the city gate and looking, the fiery construction site by the Pearl River and the slow pace inside the city seemed like two completely different worlds.

Huang Binkun reflected on his every plan since the hair-bandits landed, each one he thought was clever, yet every time it was as laughable as an ant trying to shake a tree. No wonder Father and Big Brother advised him to "understand the current affairs." But he just couldn't seem to swallow this breath. It shouldn't be like this!

But what should it be like? Speaking of living days, before the hair-bandits came, if they father and son weren't sleeping with weapons ready for bandit and pirate attacks, they were personally going down to the fields to direct tenants and long-term laborers in work. In leisure time, they repaired stockade walls, made weapons, and drilled local militia. At night they couldn't sleep peacefully either, having to get up every night to patrol, checking if the militia on the stockade walls were slacking, especially in the early morning—bandits and pirates always liked to choose this time to launch sneak attacks...

After the hair-bandits came, days were actually getting better day by day. Especially after the Tiandi Society contracted most of their land, even Father felt much younger. Not only were his steps light and vigorous, but he also often went to the county seat to attend various meetings; Big Brother and Sister-in-law's days also seemed flavorful: the recently added niece was proof.

However, their family's status in the county plummeted. The Huang family used to be the "Pillar of Lingao," now they became ordinary local gentry. To win in the County Consultative Council re-election, Old Dad and Big Brother had to use all their skills to echo the Australians' various "movements." Like marionettes...

*Really unwilling...* Suddenly Huang Binkun completely understood. The hair-bandits were indeed not simply changing the dynasty. Not only did they want to transform the civilized with the heavy, but they also wanted to completely change the long-existing rules of this world. They didn't want to share the world with gentry like him. Their end would either be becoming merchants like Scholar Lin or becoming like the workers and peasants under the hair-bandits' rule. If better, they might be a "cadre"...

Huang Binkun touched his forehead, finally understanding why he had always resisted since the hair-bandits came. In the world ruled by Australians, he wouldn't have a superior social status, wouldn't have the dignity of not kneeling before officials, wouldn't have the privilege of tax exemption, and no one would ever call him "Second Master Huang" again...

Thinking of this, he felt a surge of blood and qi, experiencing spinning heaven and earth, chest tightness and nausea. Staggering a few steps, he hurriedly supported himself against the wall.

"Eh? Brother Huang, why are you here?" Suddenly someone supported his arm.

Huang Binkun steadied his mind and saw it was Wu Ming. They were talking loudly in the Bamboo Pavilion a few days ago, and yesterday he had come specifically to visit him, so they were acquaintances.

"No problem, just momentary stagnation of blood and qi, slightly dizzy..."

"Brother Huang, you are also an injured person. Not recuperating in your lodgings, what are you doing running onto the street." Wu Ming was very enthusiastic, "Come come come, I'll escort you back."

Huang Binkun felt apologetic, but since he was weak all over for the moment, he could only say: "Troubling Worthy Brother Wu."

"Easy to say, easy to say. I just came back from school."

Although Wu Ming was a scholar, he was quite strong, supporting him all the way back to his lodgings. It turned out he was currently studying in the "Nanyu Community School."

He said he was studying, but actually he acted as a "teaching assistant." Basically teaching little younger brothers to read, while he himself pondered eight-legged essays to prepare for the *Tongshi* (Child Exam). This was very common in private schools and community schools at the time.

"Worthy Brother Wu has broad knowledge. You will surely pass high in this Child Exam..." Huang Binkun had nothing to thank him with, so he could only say some empty polite words.

Wu Ming laughed: "Relying on Brother Huang's auspicious words. I participated in the Child Exam at nineteen, wasted ten years in the examination field. This time I think I will surely pass."

Huang Binkun wondered secretly. As the saying goes, essays hate fate. How many scholars took exams for a lifetime and were still *Tongsheng* (Child Students) until death. He had only taken exams for ten years, how could he have such assurance to say "surely pass"? Could it be he had greased some joints? Thinking that he mingled with Liang Cunhou and others, perhaps he could benefit from connections...

While he was suspicious, the page boy returned. Indeed, he copied back a list of names. Whether they were the people who attacked Huang Binkun that night wasn't known, but they were all people who had been arrested by the county yamen together with Lei Lunfu.

Seeing him repeatedly examining the list, Wu Ming was very puzzled. Huang Binkun then roughly told him about Lei Lunfu's matter.

"So it was him!" Wu Ming smiled, his face full of disdain, "Good that he died."

"What is the meaning of this?" Huang Binkun said, "Although he attacked secretly, that was because he didn't know the inside story. Viewing hair-bandits as enemies, he is also a loyal and righteous man..."

Wu Ming showed a disapproving expression: "Hmph, what kind of loyal and righteous man is he? Just a rural evil gentry. I know a thing or two about his background."

It turned out that although this Lei Lunfu's family were natives of Dongguan, they also had property in Guangzhou City. He often came to the prefectural city for enjoyment and had many interactions with scholars in the County School.

"This person relied on his family having a few stinking coins and some influence in the county to act big in front of everyone. His family bullied tenants and oppressed the neighborhood in the countryside, not to mention hearing they even beat someone to death fighting over land..." Wu Ming said, two years ago when Commander Wang wanted to attack Lingao, Lei Lunfu jumped up and down quite a bit, spouting nonsense like "Hair-bandits have no soldiers available," inciting scholars to go to the Purple Treasure Studio to "uphold the Sage's teachings."

"Actually, he prepared to go snatch women inside. He even prepared sedan chairs for women and small boats, waiting to snatch them and immediately carry them to the pier to stuff into boats and take back to Dongguan," Wu Ming laughed, "Later seeing everyone ignored him, government defense was strict, and someone let out word that Purple Treasure Studio was already eyed by bigwigs in the court, he immediately shrank back..."

Listening to Wu Ming tell this Scholar Lei's "Glorious History," Huang Binkun didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

"Later when the Australian fleet attacked into the Pearl River, his family organized local militia hoping for self-preservation. Result was defeat and death, the whole family turned to ashes, and Lei Lunfu also became a stray dog." Wu Ming's interest in talking was strong, "These few people on your hand, though I don't know them, I roughly know they are also Broke-Boot Party members similar to Lei Lunfu. Loyalty and righteousness are out of the question, but having private feuds with Australians is true."

Huang Binkun was secretly disappointed; the fantasy of assembling a team of "loyal and righteous men" was instantly shattered. He asked again about the attitude of the three religions and nine schools in the market towards Australians. Wu Ming gently waved his fan and said: "Speaking of it, it's half praise and half blame."

It turned out since Guangzhou paid the city redemption fee, although the hair-bandits withdrew troops from under the city, the influence left behind was huge. Not only did Owner Guo return openly, but his business was even better than before, and he no longer used some secretive methods of the past.

"Take these Australian goods. Originally they were just rare playthings. Later paper, ink, and stationery were added. Still later, various needles, threads, iron nails, utensils, and farm tools surged in like a tide, plus useful and cheap items like matches... Let alone intervening, the government didn't even dare to tax..."

With this, countless small businesses and workshops in Guangzhou City went bankrupt and closed down.

"Isn't that causing boiling resentment among the people?"

Wu Ming nodded: "Naturally. For this matter, there were disturbances in the city several times. The government fears bandits like tigers, how dare they speak for the common people. Plus they are usually fed full with silver by Australians... Fortunately, Australians have a charity hall in the city. Those who really can't go on sign up there. Those willing to move are sent to Lingao for settlement; those unwilling to move go to work at the Great World construction site outside the city—at least they can make a living..."

"First harming the little people, then enticing them with food and warmth. Truly how venomous!"

"Who says it isn't!" Wu Ming nodded, "On the contrary, wealthy merchants and gentry with big families and businesses, some earned big money selling Australian goods, some don't care about small money and are happy to have various novel Australian gadgets for pastime. They have nothing but praise for Australians."

Wu Ming said the big households in this city were all calculating to build relationships with Australians to get a share of the pie.

The two talked about odds and ends for a long time. Seeing the sky turning dark, he bid farewell.

"I still have to go to the community school tomorrow. Brother Huang, please rest well."

That night Huang Binkun tossed and turned in bed, deeply feeling this Guangzhou was already like Lingao a few years ago. Except for hanging the flag of Great Ming, in reality, hair-bandits were everywhere. Wanting to gather anti-bandit righteous men here was already wishful thinking. Seeing the travel expenses he brought spent quite a bit during this time in Guangzhou, he needed to decide on the next step. Continue north to Fujian? To Southern Zhili? Or simply head straight for the Capital...

Passing the humid and hot night, Guangzhou's early morning was cool and comfortable. While citizens used to rising late were still in dreams, Zhang Yu, the young master of Huifu Lane, tucked his schoolbag under his arm and slowly paced out of the ancestral walnut cookie shop. Several old people getting up early to take down door planks greeted him enthusiastically when they saw him: "Shrimp Boy going to school?" Zhang Yu returned greetings one by one, leaving behind a patch of praise: "Truly knowledgeable and polite, when can my Datou learn to be like this."

Fifteen-year-old Zhang Yu was studying at the Nanyu Community School. He was a good child in parents' eyes and a good student in neighbors' mouths.
