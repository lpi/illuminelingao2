# Chapter 1803 - The Big Picture in Business

Gao Ju knew they wanted him to "negotiate" with the Australians and present their conditions. He cursed inwardly—how easily your lips move, while I do the hard work. When it came to the merchants' concerns, he shared them fully—no one was born with such high moral character as to willingly exchange solid silver for paper notes.

Yet Gao Ju understood clearly that the Council of Elders was utterly determined about this currency reform. From his several conversations with Liu Xiang and Zheng Shangjie, he knew there was no room for compromise. If the currency guild thought they could execute the policy with discounts and half-measures, the Australians simply would not accept it.

Gao Ju wasn't entirely clear why the Council of Elders wanted currency reform. In the past, when the Australians had implemented circulation vouchers on Hainan, he had estimated it was because they were short of silver and Guangdong already lacked copper cash—they had no choice but to use this method to fill the gap. But now their situation was vastly different. Apart from anything else, after the Council of Elders defeated Zheng Zhilong, forced Liu Xiang to surrender, and subjugated or absorbed the various sea lords of Fujian and Guangdong, most of the trade with the Eastern and Western Oceans had fallen into their hands. Merchants in Guangzhou estimated that this alone brought in three to four million taels of silver annually. By rights, they should have no shortage of silver at all.

As for the Australians' own expenses, they were remarkably frugal—even the fiercest anti-transmigrator critics had to admit they practiced "modest palaces and simple fare." Apart from a fondness for women, their lifestyles were beyond reproach.

No matter how he thought about it, Gao Ju couldn't fathom what the Australians needed to spend vast sums of silver on, or why they had devised this scheme of silver dollar circulation vouchers.

Using silver dollars was certainly good, but using treasure notes—that was somewhat troubling. Gao Ju was a merchant; he knew that every time the court made economic moves, speculators would swarm like flies to carrion, manipulating things from top to bottom to make enormous fortunes. The damage that caused...

He knew Guangzhou too well. Never mind the merchants sitting here at this meeting—they were all leading traders, certainly—but the wealth they could mobilize probably didn't amount to a tenth of the silver in this city. In the countless households of this densely packed municipality, in the caves of ornamental rockeries, in stone chambers within houses, beneath flagstones in courtyards, in chests in bedrooms and studies—vast wealth lay dormant. If someone harnessed this silver, it would become a destructive force in an instant. No matter how formidable the Australians' ships and cannons, a defeat in the economic arena would leave them equally unable to hold Guangzhou.

At this thought, Gao Ju felt a twinge of worry for the Australians.

Worry was worry, but the work Zheng Shangjie had assigned still had to be done. Once the new currency was issued, it had to circulate smoothly throughout the market.

After much deliberation, he spoke: "Gentlemen, I understand your views. However, the issuance of new currency is a matter the Council of Elders takes extremely seriously. Those of you who attended the Chamber of Commerce meeting know—was there any room for negotiation? I see very little margin for maneuver."

"Isn't that precisely why we need Master Gao to represent us?" Boss Zhu said. "You are an old acquaintance of the Australians after all. Even if there are some expenses involved, we are all willing to contribute—we certainly won't let Master Gao suffer any loss."

His words dripped with sarcasm, but Gao Ju's self-control was excellent. He merely smiled: "The Council of Elders conducts affairs differently from the False Ming. They have always been forthright and aboveboard—such tactics won't work."

Because this matter so deeply concerned the currency trade, Liang Chenlong pressed further: "Is there truly no room at all?"

Gao Ju replied: "Though I am an outsider, I have made my home in this Guangzhou Prefecture, this city of Five Rams, for over thirty years now. My entire household and estate is here. The safety of Guangzhou, the prosperity of its markets—these are matters of personal concern to me."

By stating his position first, he made clear that he would never "sell out everyone's interests to curry favor with the Australians." Of course, he couldn't say this explicitly—a hint was enough. Naturally, not everyone might believe him, but that didn't matter. The gesture had been made, and what he said next would carry more weight.

"...However, in this matter, the Council of Elders considers it a top priority. I have heard that the Finance Minister himself has come to Guangzhou to supervise the implementation. Even First Ministers Wen and Liu may not be able to insert themselves here."

At these words, the assembled merchants exchanged dismayed glances. Everyone knew that Gao Ju's most powerful patron was "Minister Wen." If even Minister Wen couldn't intercede, weren't they all out of options? Regardless of whether this was true, Gao Ju's refusal to take the lead demonstrated the Australians' determination.

"I wonder how much of this circulation voucher they'll issue?" Liang Chenlong shook his head. "They say 'anyone wishing to exchange circulation vouchers for silver coins shall do so at parity with silver dollars.' If there are too many notes and not enough bullion, then..."

This concern was shared by all. Now that he had spoken it plainly, the worries and discontent of the various houses surged forth like water from a broken dam. The hall of Jufeng buzzed with a sudden cacophony.

Boss Zhu added sarcastically: "Mark my words—these circulation vouchers will certainly become worthless."

Gao Ju felt his pronouncement was too hasty. Credit required collective maintenance. If these silver dollar circulation vouchers weren't overissued, and the regulations were well-designed, and the market accepted them without inconvenience, and all trades and industries supported them—then the vouchers should maintain stable value. Otherwise, the consequences would be unthinkable. If the market collapsed, even if some might profit from the chaos, the majority would suffer.

If it were the Ming court issuing circulation vouchers today rather than the Australians, Gao Ju would certainly avoid them like the plague and even marshal every resource to undermine the effort. The Ming court had taught merchants plenty of lessons through its Treasure Notes and many other matters: official promises could not be trusted. But the Australians were different. Circulation vouchers had been in use on Hainan for years without incident; the Australians had a reputation for keeping their word. Gao Ju still had faith in them.

He said nothing for the moment, waiting for the heated discussion to subside, for each household to voice its opinion without reaching a conclusion. Only then did he speak:

"I do have a perspective to offer for your consideration," he said. "These new circulation vouchers from the Australians have only just come out. We don't yet know whether they'll prove good or bad. But we should try to think positively rather than negatively. Notes are certainly for everyone to use, but the most direct stakeholders are we merchants. If the circulation vouchers have poor credit, we merchants will be the first to suffer. Therefore, we should help build trust in the vouchers. Only when vouchers are stable can our businesses prosper. Otherwise, with market turmoil and prices fluctuating three times a day, how can anyone do business?"

These words, compared to the chamber's prevailing "look out for yourself" rhetoric, struck everyone as refreshingly different. The room immediately fell quiet.

"My!" Boss Mi exclaimed. "Who knew Master Gao had such profound principles to expound!"

Gao Ju ignored the veiled sarcasm in his words and continued: "Think about it, all of you. These circulation vouchers have been in use in Qiongzhou Prefecture for four or five years now, and we've heard of no problems. The Australians have always been the most trustworthy of people. They would never be so shortsighted as to kill the goose that lays golden eggs."

This argument was solid and well-evidenced. Those present couldn't refute it—quite a few of them had actually been to Hainan or even Lingao, and facts spoke louder than words.

Gao Ju continued: "Business acumen—being so meticulous that you can calculate every fraction on a thirteen-rod abacus without letting a single thread slip through—that's mere cleverness. What matters is vision. The bigger your business, the farther ahead you must look. All of you conduct big business; your vision must encompass the bigger picture."

As he spoke, he lit himself a cigar and slowly exhaled a ring of smoke: "Today the Ming realm is beset by troubles internal and external, teetering on the verge of collapse. 'When Qin loses its deer, all the heroes of the realm compete to catch it.' Consider, gentlemen: among these heroes, who has the greatest strength? Who has the greatest ability?"

That the Great Ming would fall and the Council of Elders would contend for all under heaven—everyone knew this. But no one had stated it so plainly. The assembled merchants felt a collective chill, as if suddenly enlightened.

"...Our guiding principle in business should be: help the Council of Elders win its battles!"

"Master Gao," one merchant said with a slight frown, his voice hesitant, "I don't quite follow."

"Then let me be plainer," Gao Ju replied. "Any business that helps the Council of Elders win battles—I'll do it. Even at a loss, I'll do it. This isn't a loss; this is investing capital. When the Council of Elders has won its battles and peace reigns, what business won't prosper? And when that time comes, you'll be someone who contributed. The Council of Elders will remember you; doing business will become easy. Tell me—is there any more profitable business than this?"

"That's well said," agreed Manager Ding of the grain merchants. "Even setting aside future benefits, just having peaceful roads and contented people is enough to make business worthwhile."

Seeing support, Gao Ju pressed his advantage: "Never mind the future—just look at the present. Since the Council of Elders pacified the pirates on the Fujian-Guangdong seas, sugar, tea, porcelain, and all manner of mountain products from Fujian no longer need to take the roundabout route through Jiangxi and down the Five Ridges. They can come directly by sea to Guangdong, and prices have dropped by more than half. Think about it—isn't that how it is?"

These words didn't entirely convince the merchants, but at least the resistance wasn't as fierce as before. Gao Ju used both persuasion and pressure, and in the end the guild heads agreed to cooperate with the new currency issuance, fully adopting silver dollars and paper notes.

Liang Chenlong rode his sedan chair home. Though Gao Ju had made his speech, he remained uneasy. The Maokang Money Shop, which Liang Chenlong ran, was only a minor player in the currency trade. Its scale was modest, but he was a clansman of the Liang family, and through this connection he often handled sensitive silver transactions for various gentry that couldn't be conducted openly. He therefore had deep connections among the elite and had become head of the Currency Guild.

After the Australians entered Guangzhou, Maokang's business took the heaviest blow. His shop's dealings with currency traders in both the Northern and Southern Capitals were extensive. With Guangzhou's change of regime, some gentry had fled, others lay low, and north-south communications were severed. Maokang's exchange and lending business with the two capitals had almost completely ceased. Now he was just getting by on local operations.

He arrived at the outer study where he conducted business and lived. Barely having time to wipe his face and before even touching the tea his maidservant offered, he spread paper, ground ink, and began to write a letter.
