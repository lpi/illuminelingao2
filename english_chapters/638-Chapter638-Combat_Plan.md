# Chapter 638 Combat Plan

"The most suitable locations are, first, at the foot of Chengmai County proper, and second, at Shishan, halfway between Qiongshan and Chengmai." Dongmen Chuiyu pointed to these two places with a teaching stick.

"According to map data and Special Reconnaissance Team reconnaissance, Shishan has an elevation of 112.5 meters. It is a conical solitary extinct volcano with slopes ranging from 31 to 55 degrees. Vegetation is mainly mixed deciduous and evergreen forest. It is 362.4 meters from the nearest post road. Intercepting the government army here, the Fubo Army would possess a terrain advantage."

Following Dongmen Chuiyu's pointer, the officers' gazes projected onto a small hill on the sand table. The post road wound past the foot of the hill, and there was a large open space at the southern foot of the slope.

"Please look at the slide."

With his voice, photos of Shishan taken on-site appeared on the screen wall, including the mountain shape, terrain, and photos from various angles showing the distance and orientation relative to the post road.

The people present had just seen the topographic map on the sand table. Now looking at the on-site photos, the comparison gave them a more concrete impression.

"Shishan is seventeen kilometers east to Qiongshan County seat and sixteen kilometers west to Chengmai County seat, equivalent to the midpoint between Qiongshan and Chengmai. Fighting here, our side has a certain geographical advantage. Artillery can be placed on the summit. An observation post can be established on the summit, equipped with high-power telescopes to monitor the situation within a radius of over ten kilometers."

Everyone watched the slide intently, and some began to discuss where to deploy the formation.

From the sand table and photos, there was a large open area north of the mountain. Deploying the main force here would be enough to force the main Ming army into a pitched battle. Coupled with artillery fire support, the advantage was very obvious.

"If we fight here, once the enemy is routed, they will scatter and run." Someone raised an objection. "This is an inland area, and it's a continuous hilly region. From the photos, the vegetation is quite dense. once the enemy scatters, capturing prisoners will be very difficult."

"Our soldiers are trained according to 'line up and get shot' tactics," Fu Sansi coughed. He was a former PLA company commander who had spent a long time in the recruit camp and had a knack for training soldiers. He was currently the Inspector General of Training. Because there were not enough professional soldiers, he was temporarily acting as the commander of the 5th Battalion for this army expansion. "Currently, about half of the soldiers in the Army were recruited within the last three months. Most are still relatively unfamiliar with skirmisher combat in complex terrain. Once a pursuit and interception operation unfolds, line infantry is almost useless, and we can only rely on grenadiers and light infantry."

"I think it's better to having the decisive battle under Chengmai City," Zhu Quanxing said. This man was about thirty, from a petty clerk background, with a full beard and small eyes. He was the commander of the newly formed 6th Infantry Battalion, with absolutely no combat experience. He became the acting battalion commander solely by relying on a fanatical devotion to linear formation tactics drills.

The terrain under Chengmai City was flat, making it easy for undertrained troops to deploy, maneuver, and fight. Moreover, Chengmai County seat was very close to the sea and could receive Navy support. In comparison, Shishan was over 20 kilometers from the coastline; the Navy couldn't even watch the excitement, let alone provide support.

"These are photos of Chengmai County seat and the surrounding environment." Dongmen Chuiyu switched the slide to Chengmai County seat. Chengmai County seat was situated by a river no more than three or four kilometers from the seaside. The post road came from the south, passing the South Gate of Chengmai County before turning west.

Defeating the enemy here, a part of the routed army would attempt to rush into Chengmai County seat, relying on the city walls to hold out for reinforcements, while a part would retreat along the post road towards Qiongshan County.

According to one of the multiple plans drafted by the Staff Department, a small number of troops and artillery would be pre-positioned near Shishan or other favorable terrain to form an interception line. They would intercept the enemy when they fled here, while taking advantage of the situation to force the defeated army to surrender.

But this plan would cause further dispersal of troops. In a situation of overall insufficient military strength, there was great doubt whether a thin blockade line formed by a small number of troops could block a routed army bent on escaping for their lives.

Another plan from the Staff Department: Utilize the Fubo Army's mobility and battlefield control. After defeating the enemy army under Chengmai City, use troops for mobile warfare—coordinating with armed agricultural vehicles if necessary—to block the post road fleeing towards Qiongshan. Leave a gap in the direction of Chengmai County seat, forcing most of the routed troops to flee into Chengmai County seat.

This would form a siege situation ("caging the bird"). With over ten thousand men fleeing into tiny Chengmai, with no provisions inside and no reinforcements outside, under the Fubo Army's superior artillery fire, they could be forced to surrender very quickly. Even if they didn't surrender, the city could be breached very quickly.

Although this would break a Great Ming county seat, it was after all just a county seat. The death of a magistrate wouldn't cause too big a shock. After the battle ended, they could just withdraw from the county seat and let later officials declare it "recovered."

"I personally have an opinion." Someone raised his hand.

"Please speak." Dongmen Chuiyu saw this person was the 4th Battalion Commander Zhu Mingxia. He had extremely short hair, and his skin was dark and rough. He was very lean and capable; coming from the Armed Police, he was very seasoned in squad and platoon tactics.

"First, the enemy may not necessarily surrender. If the enemy doesn't surrender, attacking the city will inevitably result in relatively large casualties." He stood up and said, "We do indeed have artillery superiority, but merely using the firepower of 12-pounder cannons and 24-pounder howitzers clearly cannot destroy the city walls. Soldiers still have to rely on scaling the city to break in. If the enemy is relatively tenacious, the urban warfare after we scale and enter the city could bring us relatively many losses."

He strode to the sand table: "My suggestion is, after defeating the enemy army, utilize our army's characteristic of high mobility. After routing the enemy, rapidly squeeze the Ming army remnants into a 'dead ground' (*juedi*), forming an encirclement to annihilate them completely. A small army surrounding a large fleeing enemy force is not rare in military history."

Everyone watched his pointer move with rapt attention.

"I studied the geographic data prepared by the Staff Department. There is a place that is very suitable." He pointed to a river fork triangle south of the county seat on the sand table. "This place is surrounded by water on three sides. Once the enemy enters, it's very difficult to break out. Our army can effectively form an encirclement against the enemy with fewer troops."

"This place is too small, and the river depth isn't enough," Dongmen Chuiyu said. "According to the reconnaissance team's report, the average depth of this river now is only 1 to 1.2 meters; it can be forded with difficulty."

"Then press them to the seaside," Zhu Mingxia said.

This proposal gained the approval of the majority. Firstly, everyone felt that ordering soldiers to carry ladders to scale the city would likely encounter relatively large casualties. Secondly, forcing the enemy to retreat to the seaside allowed for Navy warship support. Under siege effectively from both land and sea, and under the superior gunfire of Navy warships, enemy morale would fall further, making mass surrender very easy.

The Staff Department immediately researched and revised the plan.

Northwest of Chengmai County was a small peninsula called Xiaoyingchang. Forcing the enemy into this place, the Fubo Army would only need Navy vessels and a small amount of infantry to form an encirclement posture.

Finally, He Ming decided to unfold the decisive battle with the Ming army under Chengmai County seat. His resolution was: Deploy the main force south of Chengmai County seat, defeat the Ming main force in battle, and subsequently use mobile forces to force the enemy to retreat to the seaside at Xiaoyingchang or into the county seat, achieving the goal of annihilation.

It was decided that the total military strength committed to the pitched battle would be five infantry battalions: Infantry 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Battalions. Except for the 2nd Infantry Battalion transferred to Sanya, the Lingao Garrison Battalion guarding Lingao, and the Infantry Training Unit training recruits, the Fubo Army's infantry units turned out in full force.

The Artillery deployed three field artillery companies, plus a supplementary company formed by the Artillery Training Unit. This company, besides artillery cadets, also carried as many as 20 cannons for replacement and reserve use.

For the Special Reconnaissance Team, in addition to Ye Mengyan's detachment, a detachment personally commanded by Bei Wei was added.

Pan Da commanded the Engineer Company. He originally wanted to organize another Capital Construction Engineering Corp unit, but time waited for no one, so the Executive Committee decided to temporarily subordinate the engineering team building roads within Chengmai County to him, men and equipment included.

The Fubo Army's auxiliary units were massive in scale, including cooks, transport teams, medical teams, and stretcher teams. This part was mostly staffed by conscripted militia, organized into the Field Army Logistics Column. Jia Mofei served as the Commander of the Logistics Column; having previously worked in the logistics industry, he had considerable experience in organizing material transfer.

The total combat strength was ten thousand men. Among them were 4,500 infantry, 750 artillery, and 200 engineers. There were also 400 cadets from various branches of infantry, artillery, and engineering, and the rest were auxiliary personnel for transport, medical, rear security, military industry, etc.

The Navy deployed two Type 8154 sloops, four twin-masted brigs, and twelve single-masted triangular-sail cutters. At the same time, a Marine battalion was on standby at Bopu at all times as the general reserve, to be committed to combat depending on the situation.

The Field Army reorganized and adjusted all units according to the previously issued organization regulations. The formally established basic tactical unit, the Infantry Battalion, was organized as follows: 8 companies per battalion: 1 Grenadier company and 1 Light Infantry company, with the rest being Line Infantry companies. This was a typical organization of the "Line Up and Get Shot" era. Grenadiers not only had to be "strong in build and brave in battle" but were also truly for "grenade throwing." As for Light Infantry, the standard of the era was soldiers composed of short, agile men trained in skirmishing and using rifled muskets. However, since the Fubo Army was already fully equipped with rifled muskets and skirmisher tactics were trained by everyone, Light Infantry became merely a branch title for those specialized in skirmishing warfare.

Each infantry company consisted of 3 officers, 5 NCOs, 1 drummer, 1 fifer, and 90 soldiers. Thus, the total combat personnel of a battalion was around 800 men. Roughly capable of completing independent combat missions.

To inspire soldiers' sense of honor, Grenadiers and Light Infantry were given special uniform decorations. Grenadiers were issued red cords, and Light Infantry green ones. Hanging on soldiers wearing shabby gray uniforms, there was almost no aesthetic to speak of.

"Make do for now; we'll change uniforms after fighting the battle. The soldiers look simply like flour sacks. Not martial at all." Wen Desi commented extensively on the uniform issue after inspecting the troops. "The officers look too rustic too, just having a command saber. Can't distinguish them at all. In linear warfare, the positions of officers and NCOs must be very conspicuous; only then can morale be boosted!"

"Put a feather on the officers' helmets?" He Ming's brain couldn't quite turn the corner. He vaguely remembered from movies he'd seen that officers in the linear warfare era had feathers or things like feather dusters stuck in their hats.

"Too ugly. You need suitable hats or helmets to use feathers. What does a safety helmet with a feather stuck in it look like!" Wen Desi said dissatisfiedly. "Temporarily use a rosette on the helmet for decoration. Look for information; I remember someone has researched this a lot!"

After completing the organization, the Senate held a grand flag-presentation ceremony at Mannyiao, awarding Army Flags to each battalion.

The Army Flag was bright red, with a large yellow five-pointed star in the center extending from a wormhole radiating light. On the five-pointed star was a raised clenched fist, symbolizing the Imperial Armed Forces. A white strip of cloth written with the battalion's designation was sewn close to the flagpole. The flagpole was a long white pole, and the top of the pole was a bronze Double-Headed Eagle, symbolizing the Imperial Power watching over the Eastern and Western hemispheres. The Double-Headed Eagle stood on a bronze oak leaf wreath, inside which was the unit designation in Roman numerals. Beneath the Double-Headed Eagle, gold ribbons could be additionally decorated to mark the battalion's honorary titles and medals won.

In addition to the Battalion Army Flag, each battalion could also possess its own Battalion Flag, with unlimited designs, as a special symbol of the battalion. This caused a wave of totem fanaticism. The five participating battalions used animals, patterns, and for a time it was a lively scene. Since the aesthetic tastes of each battalion commander and company commander varied, bizarre flags such as the Double Bear Underpants Flag and the Ascending Dragon Burping Flag appeared one after another. Given that the arguments produced no result for a time, the General Staff had to temporarily ask everyone not to continue discussing this issue endlessly—wait until after the battle to talk.

Infantry companies below the battalion level were also issued Company Flags, smaller in size than the Battalion Army Flag. Company Flags did not symbolize the Senate's power like the Battalion Military Flag; they were just unit markers.

After the flag-presentation ceremony ended, the Field Army held a military parade at Manyiao. The whole army conducted an infantry march-past in half-battalion units. Dust rolled over the drill ground, and cannons rumbled. The nearby commoners all knew that Lingao's Australians, or Hair Bandits, were about to fight a big battle with the Government Army.

While the Fubo Army was preparing for war at Manyiao, the Government Army gathered in Guangzhou finally began a large-scale sea crossing operation in June 1630, after preparing for more than two months.

Whether it was the reconnaissance detachments of the Special Reconnaissance Team lying in ambush outside Qiongshan County seat and the Haikou Thousand Household Post, or the intelligence organization inside Qiongshan County, or even the intelligence personnel in Guangzhou, all were issuing warnings that the main force of the Government Army had already begun crossing the sea to assemble.

The garrison troops and local militia of Qiongshan, Chengmai, Wenchang, and other places were also assembling towards Haikou. According to the latest reports, the Government Army would conduct a Grand Review and Sacrifice to the Flag in Haikou at the end of June by the solar calendar.

According to general custom, after the Grand Review and Sacrifice to the Flag, the army would depart immediately—a great battle was imminent.

The sound of signal cannons woke the soundly sleeping Gou Chengxuan. He hurriedly climbed up and put on his clothes. Since Lai Da volunteered to go to Lingao to gather military intelligence and mobilize the militia, his situation had improved even more. Although not explicitly announced, He Rubin seemed to treat him as a guest advisor, not only allocating him a fifty-something-year-old soldier for his service but also providing much more generous supplies than at the beginning. Although not comparable to official staff, at least he ate better than ordinary soldiers.

Because he didn't count as official staff, nor was he an officer, he customarily didn't need to attend roll-call meetings and the like. He Rubin would only summon him when he needed his consultation. Gou Chengxuan's days were passed quite casually.

At the end of June, he crossed the sea with He Rubin's central army to Qiongzhou Prefecture. After returning to Qiongzhou Prefecture, he spent almost every day and night in extreme excitement. Thinking of how he had hidden like a rat for over two years, not only risking the Hair Bandits' search and arrest but also suffering others' disdain, and now he was about to fight back to his hometown with the grand army, the excitement was indescribable.

Starting from the crossing of the central army, the garrison troops and local militia mobilized from various counties in northeastern Qiongzhou arrived at the Qiongshan Grand Camp one after another.

He Rubin assembled the grand army outside Qiongshan County seat. To express his attitude of not shirking hardship and personally attending to military affairs, he set up his Commander's Tent outside the city instead of occupying houses inside the city.

In the fields outside the county seat, the Government Army's camps connected one after another. Drums and horns sounded to the sky day and night, men shouted and horses neighed, a tense pre-war atmosphere.

The military camp where Gou Chengxuan stayed was the location of He Rubin's Central Army Camp, situated on a small hillside. Facing the sun and sheltered from the wind. Standing in front of the tent, one could overlook the entire drill ground in front of the Central Army stockade.

Although the formal drill and Flag Sacrifice wouldn't start until *chen* hour (7-9 AM), the officers and soldiers originally sleeping soundly in their respective tents had been awakened by that burst of cannon and horn sounds just now, drilling out of their tents one after another. Thus, the various camps became bustling with thousands of heads moving again, men shouting and horses neighing.

Soldiers were hurriedly tidying their clothes, some standing anxiously rushing to the thatch clumps to relieve themselves. Those with fast movements were already surrounding the cooks holding rice bowls ready to eat. There were also those packing swords and spears, donning helmets and armor, scrubbing firearms, saddling warhorses... and so on. With their activities, all kinds of talking, footsteps, and sounds of objects colliding rang into a noisy piece.

When had Gou Chengxuan ever seen such a scene? Seeing such a magnificent spectacle, he thought, *The Government Army's might is so flourishing; no matter how sharp the Hair Bandits' firearms are, they probably can't withstand this.* He looked around excitedly.

Small groups of men and horses had already begun to assemble towards the drill ground. Those with neat armor and weapons were the Camp Soldiers transferred from the mainland; those with old weapons and armor were the local Garrison Troops; those wearing only cloth uniform jackets and holding miscellaneous weapons were the Village Militia. No matter which group, they all held various flags.

"*Wooo—wooo—wooo—*" The long horn sound rang out again. Gou Chengxuan looked into the distance and discovered that an earthen platform had already been built on the drill ground, probably for the inspection and Flag Sacrifice. A cloth canopy was set up on the platform, and chairs were arranged. On the left and right sides, many flags of various sizes were inserted. A wide flight of steps extended diagonally from the front edge to the ground. Driven into the ground to the left front of the General's Platform stood a gigantic flagpole. A Central Army Sitting Banner was unfurling in the morning wind, making a flapping sound.
