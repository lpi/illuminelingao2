# Chapter 103: Salt Fields (Part 2)

Even today, with large-scale mechanization, solar salt production remains extremely laborious and grueling—far from simply digging evaporation pools on beaches for batch output. Ancients knew early that seawater pooling on coastal rocks could evaporate into small amounts of salt, yet until the Yuan Dynasty, boiling seawater remained the dominant salt-making method. Solar evaporation wasn't as simple as it seemed—theory applied to practice required systematic production processes. Wang Luobin had witnessed salt-field production in rural Guangxi. The process: seawater entered storage channels through tidal intake ditches outside dikes, then mechanical pumps lifted water from high to low through branch channels into evaporation pools. When brine reached 5–10 Baumé degrees, it entered concentration pools, further concentrating to 20–25 degrees, then flowed through brine channels to pump houses. Power lifted it to brine pools, then into crystallization pools. Brine depth: 6–8 cm, concentration maintained at 26–28 degrees—only then would salt crystallize.

In ancient times, such production conditions obviously weren't possible. How did they increase brine concentration under primitive conditions? This intrigued him greatly.

The village head led him and Xiong Buyou onto the dike. Below were numerous inkstone-like stone salt-evaporation troughs. Their arrangement was deliberate—seemingly haphazard piles were actually precisely layered heights. This was to maximize sunlight exposure. The troughs encircled central expanses of blackish salt fields. The head said the village currently had over 7,000 troughs, all carved and polished by ancestors, passed down through generations.

The salt field was a muddy tidal flat they called "salt mud." During dry season's strong sunlight, twice-monthly spring tides flooded this mud. Salt mud could absorb seawater salt; when tides receded, the mud was raked loose, then sun-dried for several days—evaporating water—leaving highly saline mud.

Putting salt mud into brine pools was entirely manual: wooden scrapers moved sun-dried mud into pools. These "pools" were simply pits dug in salt fields—2 meters wide, 3 meters long, 1 meter deep—bottomed with bamboo strips and grass for filtration.

After mud entered pools, workers trampled it firm, added seawater. Filtered water flowed through pre-cut outlets into adjacent brine ponds—producing a pond of brine.

How was brine concentration judged? Workers broke stems of *huangyu* thornbush growing at field edges and dropped them into brine pools. Only when stems floated was it truly saturated brine—otherwise, more sun-exposure was needed.

Brine was carried to salt troughs. Troughs were volcanic stone; Wang Luobin examined closely—stone had tiny dense pores, perhaps for drainage? Before sunrise, brine was poured into troughs. After a day's blazing sun, by dusk, salt could be scraped with boards and collected in bamboo baskets. During the hottest, clearest season, one trough could evaporate two or three brine refills.

Currently, most troughs were empty, but some still had crystallized salt—gleaming beautifully in sunlight.

Wang Luobin gazed at these 7,000-plus troughs: using such primitive labor methods, this place produced over 200 tons annually. He couldn't help marveling at ancient people's boundless wisdom.

A tool shed stood on the dike. Curious about ancient salt-field implements, Wang Luobin looked inside. Many tools were piled there—not very different from what he'd seen at modern salt fields. He tried the raking tool—much heavier than modern versions. Ancient manufacturing limitations meant only the clumsiest methods. Working under scorching sun with such heavy tools—truly grueling.

He approached a salt trough. Inside, a layer of white salt had crystallized—sparkling, beautiful, and very fine. It looked like modern factory-refined salt—greatly surprising him. Sea salt achieving this quality without refinement was something he'd never seen. He tasted a pinch—much milder than the refined salt they'd brought, melting immediately.

The sodium-chloride content was unknown—no instruments here for analysis. But Wang Luobin knew this salt's appearance alone would make it highly marketable.

Yet this place was so impoverished—completely unexpected. Ancient laborers truly lived in dire straits.

Just as he was reflecting, he spotted a group approaching the dike. The leader was on horseback—rare locally—trailed by a large crowd in blue robes. Village Head Tan's expression turned both fearful and disgusted. He said to Wang Luobin: "It's Landlord Gou."

"Landlord Gou?" Wang Luobin vaguely remembered this name from somewhere he'd forgotten.

"Mm, mm." Head Tan seemed afraid of this landlord's power—no time even to say more—and hurried to meet them, bowing and scraping, extremely respectful.

Wang Luobin didn't know who this Landlord Gou was, but from Head Tan's terrified deference, clearly not a good person—probably a local tyrant or bully. They were currently outnumbered; directly dealing with such people was difficult. Better to stay on the dike and watch.

The horseman appeared to be berating; Head Tan bowed repeatedly, seemingly pleading. This pantomime continued awhile, then Head Tan dejectedly led people toward the village—completely ignoring them on the dike. Wang Luobin quickly radioed those loading salt in the village, warning them to stay alert.

But the visitors clearly didn't dare provoke them—the shaven-headed pirates' ferocity was now common knowledge in Lingao. After a while, the village head returned to the dike, looking miserable, and led them back to the village.

After much questioning, Xiong Buyou finally pieced together the situation. According to government regulations, salt fields used the commutation system—salt workers didn't directly pay salt quotas to the government but converted salt into rice or silver. The old rule was each *yin* equaled one *shi* of rice. Later, rice-commutation became silver-commutation: first converting salt to rice, then rice to silver at market prices. Ma'ao Salt Field's quota was "1,417 *yin*, 230 *jin*"—commuting to over 1,400 *shi* rice, which at Tianqi/Chongzhen-era prices meant nearly 2,000 *liang* silver.

Commutation had some benefits for salt workers: production was no longer government-supervised. As long as you paid salt taxes on time, you could do whatever you wanted—no need to dedicate yourself night and day to Ming salt affairs. After producing salt, merchants would naturally buy it. If production was high and prices good, life was decent. Some, finding salt work too hard, paid taxes using income from trade or farming instead.

But after the earthquake, everything changed. Old Landlord Gou exploited the destroyed fields and unpayable tax debts, gradually controlling most salt sales through loan-fronting. His purchase prices were far below market—salt workers' back-breaking output couldn't even cover the rolling debts. He also colluded with officials, manipulating salt taxes, claiming rice prices had soared—each *shi* now commuted at 3 *liang* silver. High-interest debt on one side, mounting tax arrears on the other. Salt workers knew he was scheming but had to beg him to intercede with officials. Over time, the Gou family became the village's de facto rulers. Salt fields seemed to become Gou family property. Exploitation intensified; plus, every time pirates raided Lingao, they also robbed salt certificates and killed people. The village grew increasingly desolate. Able-bodied workers usually didn't dare come home—hiding inland, farming for survival.

As for today's visit—it was just collecting this month's "regulation silver" and ordering all able-bodied men back to make salt. Otherwise, he'd imprison the village's women, children, and elderly.

"Prison?" Wang Luobin asked. "Is he an official?"

"No—it's his family's private prison." Head Tan shuddered. "The Gou family is formidable. Never mind a private prison—anyone who offends them gets arrested and tortured to death—"

He quickly shut up, probably feeling he'd said too much, and just kept urging them to take their salt and leave. Wang Luobin felt the salt-village situation was complex—issues here might truly require a land-reform work team to handle.

To get Committee guidance, he returned to Bairren Fortress that night. Though some Committee members were absent, remaining members discussed and approved his work-team approach: deploy a competent team to the salt field, help villagers restore production, arm salt workers, eliminate landlords and pirates' threats, making Ma'ao Salt Field a key salt-chemical raw-material base for transmigrators.

Since this was transmigrators' first comprehensive social-level transformation of a locality, all groups took it seriously, seconding personnel to form a Salt-Field Work Team.

The Committee originally wanted Wang Luobin as team leader, but he felt the position suited someone both militarily capable and socially adept. Finally, Xi Yazhou was chosen.

Propaganda and organization work went to Du Wen—since landing, beyond reading radio scripts nobody heard, she'd had no real assignments. Hearing about "land reform," she enthusiastically volunteered. The entire work team comprised thirty people, including one doctor—"River Horse" (Hema).

Everyone carried sufficient weapons: pistols, rifles, daggers, ample ammunition. River Horse brought many medicines and simple surgical instruments. Considering possible long-term deployment, the team also brought wind generators and other equipment. Food was problematic—besides their own needs, they might have to provide relief to locals. Though Xiao Zishan had already taken people to Guangzhou for major procurement, the first grain shipment was still some time away. Wu Nanhai dared not give much—just one week's food and provisions.
