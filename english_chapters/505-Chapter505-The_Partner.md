# Chapter 505 - The Partner

Hai Shuzu, however, did not believe things were that dire. At present, his most valuable possessions were the five-masted ship and its cargo. What would be the point of abducting him now? Besides, the returning sailors and merchants aboard had said the Australians treated everyone courteously and did them no harm.

But his wife and family absolutely forbade him to go to Lingao. With such fierce opposition at home, he was at a loss. The trip to Lingao was indefinitely postponed. After much deliberation, his only recourse was to visit Guangzhou and seek help from friends he had made while studying there and from colleagues of his late father—perhaps borrow some silver to ease the immediate crisis.

Although Hai Shuzu commanded considerable social standing thanks to his ancestor's reputation, he himself was merely a *jiansheng*—a title the authorities had bestowed as a courtesy to his being Hai Gong's descendant. His family was not wealthy. Consequently, his fund-raising tour met with little success. Though friends contributed what they could—twenty or fifty taels here and there—after more than ten days, he had scraped together barely over three hundred taels, a drop in the bucket compared to what he owed.

He lingered in Guangzhou for some time, but everything there was expensive and lodging difficult to sustain. Knowing that staying longer would yield nothing, Hai Shuzu set off early to return to Qiongshan and attend to his affairs.

He dared not go directly home. Instead, he first took lodging at his family's rural estate and sent the estate manager to gather news. He sat alone in the house. When he had left, he hadn't even dared bring along the household servants he usually employed—they were among those to whom he owed money. Although their status prevented them from openly making a scene, their service had already grown slack, and they occasionally let slip snide remarks. Unable to bear the humiliation, Hai Shuzu had borrowed a servant boy from a friend to attend him.

He recalled that although the Hai family was not counted among the notable great households of Qiongzhou Prefecture, he used to go out accompanied by five or six servants in procession, all of whom had been invariably deferential. Who could have imagined that he would now find himself unable even to command his own household staff?

As he lamented his situation, several small two-man sedan chairs suddenly arrived at the estate. An estate worker rushed in to report. With the manager away, Hai Shuzu could hardly send a farmhand to greet visitors; he steeled himself and went out.

At the head of the party was his chief steward, Hai Ji, but the chair bearers and attendants were all unfamiliar faces. Hai Shuzu froze. When the sedan curtains parted, he saw that the occupants were his wife, children, and aged mother.

Hai Ji wept as he explained, "Home has become simply unbearable."

It turned out that after Hai Shuzu left, the throng of dunners and troublemakers, finding no head of the household to confront, had intensified their harassment, fearing their losses would never be recovered. With no other recourse, the family had asked the yamen to step in and restore order.

"Those runners from the yamen demanded gifts and gratuities as soon as they arrived. Even after we gave several hundred *wen*, they were unsatisfied. They went through the motions but made no real effort, leaving the mob to run riot. Someone threatened to storm the inner gates and take their grievances directly to the old lady and the mistress. Finally, County Magistrate Zhang happened by; he couldn't stand the spectacle and ordered several of the worst offenders cangued on the spot. Only then was order restored."

Hai Shuzu could only bow his head and sigh. Though he knew Magistrate Zhang had acted out of goodwill toward the family, using official power to suppress the crowd was not flattering to the family's reputation.

His mother, wife, and children, no longer able to endure the harassment, had borrowed sedan chairs from relatives and friends and slipped away in secret.

Seeing his family's frightened faces, carrying only a few bundles, their appearance utterly wretched, Hai Shuzu reflected that his failed venture had not only brought ruin upon his wife and children but also tarnished the family honor. In self-cultivation and household management alike, he had failed utterly—he could not help but weep.

"Those treacherous servants are truly insufferable," Hai Ji continued, rambling. "Those we owe money to, never mind—at least there's some grounds for that. But even those we owe nothing to refuse to come serve; some are already having others look for new positions for them…"

"When calamity falls, each flies off on his own. I can hardly blame them," Hai Shuzu said, disheartened. His family had resided in Qiongzhou for over a century and was known for virtue and charity. Though their circumstances were modest, they had never treated servants harshly. Yet in the face of a little money, all of that had evaporated. The power of money—he had never felt it so acutely before.

Sighs aside, the situation still had to be resolved. It was unseemly for the entire family to hide from creditors at some remote estate. Hai Shuzu consulted with his mother and wife and decided to sell the family's farmland. Combined with the silver borrowed in Guangzhou, they could at least repay some debts.

"But once the land is sold, we will not have a single *wen* left. Even a moderately comfortable life will be beyond our reach," Hai Shuzu said mournfully.

There was clan ritual land; food at least would be available. But their former leisurely existence would be no more.

"Selling land to pay debts is only proper," his mother said through tears. "But the silver you borrowed in Guangzhou—without any land left, how will you repay those people?"

Hai Shuzu thought: those who lent it had probably never expected him to repay anyway. But he could not bring himself to say so aloud.

The family debated how to live in the future, talking back and forth to no conclusion. They had no appetite even for lunch. That afternoon, however, the estate manager came hurrying back.

"Master!" He was too agitated to observe the formalities. "Those debt collectors have all vanished!"

"Vanished?" Hai Shuzu thought this group had been the most aggressive dunners, holding promissory notes that the authorities could do nothing about so long as they stopped short of rioting. How could they suddenly lay down their arms and run off?

"I've heard that someone bought up their notes!"

"?" Hai Shuzu was stunned. Bought up the notes? For what purpose? In his current state, ruin was only a matter of time; even if he sold his land, he might repay only twenty or thirty percent. Whoever purchased these notes had essentially bought a pile of worthless paper.

Hai Ji, however, suggested, "Perhaps some gentleman, admiring your well-known righteousness, has graciously extended a helping hand?"

Hai Shuzu could scarcely believe such good fortune existed. These loans, not counting interest, totaled over two thousand taels—he had no friends wealthy enough for this. Those who had contributed thirty or fifty taels had already shown considerable loyalty. Why would a complete stranger put up such an enormous sum on his behalf?

While he was still bewildered, an estate worker came in again to report: "A Mister Lin from outside has come calling." He presented a visiting card.

Hai Shuzu glanced at the cover—he did not recognize any Lin Baiguang—and said, "Tell him I am not at home."

"Mister Lin said that once you open the card, you will surely recognize him," the worker replied.

Hai Shuzu had no choice but to pick up the card. It was surprisingly heavy; underneath was an envelope. Inside were his own promissory notes.

He was bewildered and examined them one by one. Indeed, they were the notes he himself had issued, every single one, now gathered in this envelope. Each bore a stamp indicating the account had been settled.

Needless to say, this Mister Lin was the one who had secretly purchased his debts! What was his aim? Hai Shuzu was caught off guard and did not know what to do.

It was Hai Ji who had some insight: "Master, this Mister Lin does not seem to bear ill will. See—he has marked all the notes as settled and returned them in full. If he had some scheme, why would he do this?"

"Ah, yes, yes," Hai Shuzu said, enlightened. "I must certainly meet with him."

"Mister Lin, my master invites you in!" Hai Ji went out personally to welcome him.

Lin Baiguang smiled faintly. After the yamen had cangued a few of the most obstreperous creditors, confidence among the debt-holders had plummeted. Gao Di had no trouble at all—stripping off the interest, he purchased all the notes for thirty percent of principal.

Gao Di had wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to buy out the shareholders' equity at a discount as well, but Lin Baiguang instructed him not to.

"We can only remove some of the pressure for now while demonstrating our sincerity. If we solve all his problems outright and he's left with no worries, what happens if he feeds us empty words like 'I'll repay you even if my whole family must toil like oxen and horses, but if you want me to front your mining scheme—forget it'? What are we supposed to do then—kill him?"

"But we hold his debts; surely he wouldn't dare refuse," Gao Di said.

"Heh, that's not so certain." Lin Baiguang chuckled. "Perhaps we could threaten him this way, but then a seed of resentment would be planted—a major taboo when partnering on a venture."

"Furthermore," he continued, instructing Gao Di, "consider Hai Shuzu's family background. He is, after all, a member of the gentry, a scholar, and a descendant of Hai Gong. Originally, he was being pressured by a whole group of people here in Qiongzhou; now it would be just us—outsiders—pressing him. If the local gentry close ranks against us, we are, at the end of the day, newcomers. Wouldn't we then lose both our money and our man?"

"I understand." Gao Di's expression showed genuine admiration.

"A family like the Hais can only be won over with kindness; only then will they feel gratitude. As for pressure—we should leave him some. After he agrees to cooperate with us, it won't be too late to help him resolve the rest."

"What if he's just paying us lip service and later finds excuses to back out?"

"You're getting shrewder—but Hai Shuzu is, after all, a descendant of Hai Gong. Such base tactics are beneath him," Lin Baiguang said. "Even if he had the inclination, the family honor would never permit it."

Persuading Hai Shuzu to partner in opening a coal mine did not take Lin Baiguang much effort. For Hai Shuzu, desperate and at his wits' end, the path before him, though not particularly honorable, was preferable to losing everything and subsisting as a dependent at the ancestral shrine. Besides, even total ruin would not begin to compensate the shareholders for their losses.

Thinking of the curses that would be heaped upon his family filled Hai Shuzu with unease. The terms this Mister Lin from Guangzhou proposed were quite tempting: Mister Lin would provide the capital, while Hai Shuzu would serve as the figurehead to open a coal mine in Qiongzhou Prefecture. The Hai family need not invest a single coin yet would receive twenty percent of the profits. Mister Lin would take eighty percent.

Hai Shuzu said hesitantly, "I understand what you mean—it's nothing more than having me deal with the officials and local powers on your behalf. That much is easy; I still have some modest influence locally. But I have a word of caution: whether coal can actually be mined in Qiongzhou, I have never heard confirmed. Moreover, firewood is exceedingly easy to come by here—I doubt many would burn coal. Have you thought this through before sinking a shaft so rashly?"

Lin Baiguang nodded. Hai Shuzu was indeed a man of integrity! He felt genuinely impressed—in any era, it was a comfort to deal with honest men.
