# Chapter 1502 - Background

Lin Ming's adventure this time could be called "enduring humiliation for a heavy burden": although in Foshan he was merely a Trial Hundred Household or Hundred Household of a small Hundred Household Office, considered extremely trivial "official" in Great Ming's military rank system—if an ordinary military household, truly wouldn't even count as a fart—fortunately the bluffing title of "Jinyiwei" still had considerable power in late Ming; everyone had to respect him three points.

This time he pretended to be a worker on board, and didn't sail strictly to Lingao, specifically for his infiltration into Lingao to be safer—truly called fully immersing in the role; not only snatching arduous and tired work to do, but also sparing no effort in currying favor with people. Face tanned, skin became rough; gradually ground away the "official air" and "scion air" on his body one by one.

After sailing back and forth on the sea like this for several months on the ship, Lin Ming felt it was about enough, so he told the captain he wanted to go to Lingao to join Australians—this was no longer a rare thing in Guangdong and Fujian; quite a large-scale active immigration wave to Lingao had appeared, people crossing sea to "join Kun" every day—after clearing wages he got off the ship in Kaohsiung.

Getting off in Kaohsiung was carefully calculated by him—he had been here more than once, was quite familiar with the situation here, and roughly understood Kun thieves' style of doing things. Moreover, ships traveling to Lingao from here were many, and distance to Taiwan wasn't far; both places had many Great Ming merchant ships. These ships mostly recruited supplementary personnel locally before departure; getting on a ship was very easy.

Now he stayed below deck of *Dongshanju*, eyes bright, calculating next move.

"Young man, thinking about what?" Manager Liu fetched dinner, brought it in.

"No, didn't think about anything." Lin Ming covered up, seeing Manager Liu brought dinner, hurriedly stood up, "Manager Liu, I should do this..."

"You are new, unfamiliar on ship, what if you drop into sea when going to fetch?" Manager Liu narrowed eyes smiling, "I know you are a scholar, definitely can play chess—after eating accompany me old man for a few games is good."

"How can I count as any scholar..." Lin Ming hurriedly denied.

"Young man, don't hide from me. You are not only a scholar, family background is probably also quite good." Manager Liu said taking out wine pot and cup from cupboard.

"Can't drink on ship; I old man advanced in age, drink a few mouthfuls to activate blood—count as relying on age to sell age, won't offer you."

"Manager Liu you help yourself, I understand rules on ship." Lin Ming hurriedly changed topic.

Fortunately Manager Liu didn't talk about family background anymore after pouring wine. Lin Ming breathed a sigh of relief, looking at food in plate—unexpectedly good! Even more unexpected was Manager Liu ate exactly same thing as him. Food on *Dongshanju*, even for Employer and Captain, wasn't much different from ordinary sailors and clerks. These months what he ate on ship was merely filling stomach; initially those coarse foods were simply hard to swallow, spent long time adapting.

Food on *Dongshanju* was however quite sumptuous. Not only vegetables fresh—this was okay, after all just left port—also fish and shrimp to eat. Need to know Lin Ming spent almost every day on ship these months, yet hadn't eaten decent fish and shrimp a few times; only salted fish and brined shrimp, not only salty and smelly, but size pitifully small; didn't know where boatmen got them.

"How is it, we eat well on this ship right? Employer is kind hearted." Manager Liu unavoidably bragged for his master, "Look which shipowner gives clerks such good food."

Actually, Chen Huamin and Liu Deshan accepted some Australian concepts, giving improved food and pay to subordinates compared to other sea merchants. Not long after implementing this policy, they discovered "using fewer people with better treatment" was much more cost-effective than "using a large group with very low treatment." Sailors and clerks on *Dongshanju* were only half the number used by Great Ming merchant ships of similar capacity, yet cost spent on labor per voyage was one third less.

"Manager Liu you speak correctly. Both masters are benevolent." Lin Ming now developed habit of agreeing with whatever anyone said.

Lin Ming hadn't eaten decent meal for months; meeting this "good meal," immediately swept like wind rolling scattered clouds, eating cleanly, even mixing little leftover brine in dish plate with rice to eat. After eating, he poured a bowl of water, rinsed mouth.

Manager Liu sipped a mouthful of wine, laughed: "You still say yourself not a scholar; which ordinary clerk has your style? This vegetable juice, needless to say licked clean with tongue; rinsing mouth after meal, that needless to say more. Our Master Liu doesn't even have this style."

Lin Ming cried bitterness inwardly; didn't expect difficult days of months hadn't completely worn off original life traces. This old man could see it, could Kun thieves not see it? Unavoidably felt somewhat disheartened.

Feeling of dejection unavoidably surfaced on face. Manager Liu thought touched his sad matters, unavoidably comforted: "Young man, don't be dejected. You are still young, have strength. Nowadays sea surface peaceful, work hard. Wanting riches and honor certainly not easy, earning a well-off family livelihood probably still doable."

Lin Ming suddenly had an inspiration. He realized no matter how he covered up, traces left by past life couldn't be completely obliterated. Arriving in Lingao wasn't like this sea ship; sailors and clerks came and went anytime, gathering like crows and tiles, no one cared about anyone's business. Heard Kun thieves loved to dig to bottom [investigate thoroughly]; various clues revealed by himself designated would be discovered by them.

These words of Manager Liu, seemingly old man loving to chatter out of kindness, Lin Ming knew contained meaning of "interrogating background."

If he couldn't answer satisfactorily, couldn't gain their trust. This ship was built by Australian shipyard; this shipowner's relationship with Kun thieves probably not shallow. Arriving in Lingao, in case he went to chew tongue [gossip] with Kun thieves, he would die without burial place immediately! Seems disguising as poor man evasively wouldn't work; must fabricate a passable background to gloss over.

Thinking here, his mind made up; turning a few circles in brain, already had a draft, deliberately sighed: "Manager Liu your view of things indeed experienced! Not hiding from you, family in past indeed had a small property. Although not counted rich and noble, was worry-free about food and drink. Only parents left early..." Then with tears and mucus flowing fabricated a traditional story of prodigal son squandering family property, forced to wander sea to make living.

This kind of story though old-fashioned, in that time examples were not lacking; even fabricating was easy to be very perfect. Lin Ming also had an advantage: he was "earth worm" [local snake] in Foshan, extremely familiar with local situation, easily finding family with similar story. He chose this family's young master, after down and out having died in Guangzhou—others didn't know, Lin Ming knew.

He immediately grafted this family's matters onto himself removing head and tail. Speaking to emotional part, even feigned wiping tears to show weeping bitterly. Like this, even old jianghu like Manager Liu was deceived by him; seeing him sad, Manager Liu even comforted him a few sentences.

"Originally seeing you can write and calculate, wanted to keep you on ship as a clerical gentleman. But since you want to go to Lingao to join Kun, I won't mention it." Manager Liu said, "Heard Australians there have livelihood; many people who couldn't get by went there to seek survival, now living quite well. You are young and literate, as long as willing to work, in future surely can receive important use."

"Many thanks Manager Liu for comfort. Where dare I think of these now. Heard Australian side employs many people, as long as willing to sell strength have rice to eat, that's why want to go to Lingao. I only think of arriving Lingao peacefully, having a job, a house, down-to-earth earning a bowl of rice is good. Work on this ship, I truly can't do."

Navigation before modern times had neither weather forecast nor weather radar, barometer; nautical charts imperfect, plus pirates appearing... sailing had no safety to speak of, going to sea was risking danger. Ordinary commoners unless desperate, no one willing to go on ship to make living. This confession of Lin Ming was reasonable and fair. Completely fit his identity of down-and-out son.

"You are being too humble," Manager Liu drank a few mouthfuls, face slightly flushed, "You probably don't know yet, someone like you who can write and calculate, arriving in Lingao as long as willing to shave hair to join Kun, can mix a 'Cadre' to be—probably Australian 'clerk'. Salary amount aside, first can eat imperial grain [government salary], you say such benefit, does Great Ming have?"

Lin Ming startled, thought I really didn't know Kun thieves so "thirsty for talent," but like this, own plot was one step closer to success. Hurriedly smiled apologetically: "Body hair skin received from parents, shaving hair this matter too big. Even if not shaving, probably going to earn a mouthful of rice is also easy..."

Manager Liu nodded: "Young man filial piety commendable. I this old man won't say more. Just live fleeting days well in Lingao. I am old la, stayed with Master whole life, stayed used to it can't walk away. If younger ten twenty years, would also throw self under Australian hand to seek a future." Say finished he drank wine in cup in one gulp.

Finished dinner, Lin Ming cleaned tableware, returned to cabin. Manager Liu already set up chess game; two people killed back and forth a few games. Lin Ming usually had nothing to do in Hundred Household Office; to dispel boredom mastered every pastime gadget, chess skill could be called exquisite. He knew this ship had origins with Kun thieves, Manager Liu and others visited Lingao many times, was an excellent channel to understand Kun thieves' inside information. So intentionally controlled chess strength, two people killed inextricably hard to resolve, hooking Manager Liu who always swept whole ship previously to shout satisfying. While playing chess while chatting, Lin Ming took opportunity to understand quite a lot of affairs of Lingao.
