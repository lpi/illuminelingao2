# Chapter 1589 - Giving Instructions in Person

"Then how do you plan to handle it?"

"The specific plan will be notified to all Senators after it is determined. You can notify the Senators involved in this matter of this news first," Wu Mu said on the phone, "Just tonight. We will also invite you to a meeting then."

"Alright." Although Wu Ciren was not satisfied with this rhetoric, helplessly Wu Mu had already hung up the phone. He couldn't get anything out of asking more. Better wait until evening simply.

Returning to the rehearsal hall, Wu Ciren with a serious face called Yuan Ziguang, Dongmen Chuiyu, and others to a corner to "hold a small meeting". Fortunately, most members were surrounding Liu Shuixin and didn't notice the tense atmosphere here. Only the two little Senators Zhang Yunmi and Lin Ziqi cast surprised glances. Dongmen Chuiyu shook his head to signal "it's okay".

"Checking the situation I just heard from Wu Mu's phone call is like this, what do you think?" Wu Ciren relayed the news and asked his fellow enthusiasts.

"This... this is too... that... Even if Zuo Yami really went to watch a rehearsal with someone, it doesn't prove anything, right? She is a reliable element cultivated by the Senate for a long time! Or... or..." Yuan Ziguang, this old educator, obviously couldn't imagine that one day he would hear about "enemy agents" in idol group activities, somewhat incoherent.

If Zuo Yami really had problems, the Education Department would be disgraced. He thought, fortunately she was from the Maid Training Class!

How could Dongmen Chuiyu know the twists and turns in his stomach? He said: "I think we don't need to be too nervous. Various forces infiltrating Lingao isn't a matter of one or two days. Grassroots police officers don't have the ability to distinguish one by one. It's enough for us few to know this news. If Little Zhang and Teacher Liu hear it, it will definitely affect their mood, and the program quality will also be affected. Better not tell them. For other things, we have the army, the police, and the Political Security Bureau, still afraid of not being able to watch the venue?"

"Words are correct, but this is our essence saved for several years. Even if one is lost, I can't afford it!" Yuan Ziguang was anxious enough to jump. Several Senators had reserved positions in this idol group. If one really died, he, the direct person in charge of the Education Department, would be fucked 100 times by speech. Suddenly he realized why Xiao Zishan wanted to restructure the Maid Training Class. This damn thing was shedding a burden!

"I think we don't need to worry in vain. We will understand everything after the meeting in a while. Just in case, I will arrange a car to send Teacher Liu and Little Zhang back later. As for the problem of Zuo Yami, she belongs to the Household Registration Section. It's really hard for me to intervene in this matter. Let's wait for the Political Security Bureau to draw a conclusion." Wu Ciren made a summary.

At this time the door was knocked. Before Lin Ziqi could get up and walk to the door, it was already pushed open by a guard. The food delivery team of the Commercial Officer Restaurant filed in carrying food boxes.

Dongmen Chuiyu clapped his hands and shouted loudly: "Dinner time, everyone line up to collect meals!"

The gentlemen of the Checkered Skirt Club had always been generous to the idol group of their dreams beforehand, ordering the highest grade "bento". Just the imported Japanese lacquer food box outside was worth a lot. Opening it, colorful dishes were arranged neatly inside. It was completely made according to the mode of later generations' high-end Japanese bento. Not only were there all kinds of delicacies from land and sea, but also pickles and fruits.

The girls, who mainly ate in the cafeteria, had never seen such a luxurious "bento". One by one, they collected it and went to eat. Without greeting, Zhang Yunmi naturally took the lead, followed by Lin Aili and Zuo Yami collecting meals in the order of standing positions. Besides a few chairs in the rehearsal hall, there were no extra tables and chairs. The girls consciously left them for the Senators to sit, and sat on the floor themselves to eat.

Dongmen and others naturally wouldn't tackle seats with girls. Three chairs were left for Liu Shuixin, Zhang Yunmi, and Lin Ziqi.

"Damn, the gap already exists, eh." Zhang Berlin whispered while wolfing down the bento.

"Without a gap, there is no motivation." Dongmen Chuiyu said, "At least we haven't prepared the small cucumber set meal yet."

"What is your opinion." Zhao Manxiong's gentle and steady voice came from the phone.

Wu Mu suppressed the excitement of solving a big case: "Continue monitoring. Once more clues are found, catch them all in one net." He added another sentence, "The investigators also see it this way."

"I think you have to be cautious about this matter." Zhao Manxiong coughed lightly, "As long as one Senator is attacked by the enemy, regardless of whether actual harm is caused to him, your position as Director will be unstable. Yang Cao and them don't matter. I can move them to another place and promote them later. But you, once you fall, it will be very difficult to return to this position..."

"I am psychologically prepared for this." Wu Mu said, "Always thoroughly eliminate hidden dangers. I don't care about personal gains and losses."

"Then I agree with your plan." Zhao Manxiong said, "Have you notified the relevant Senators to come for the briefing meeting?"

"Just tonight." Wu Mu said, "To be honest, I think it's not quite appropriate. Shouldn't this matter be absolutely confidential?"

"You can't look at this matter simply with a professional eye. You must have political concepts." Zhao Manxiong said tepidly, "Doing political security work, the first thing is to maintain correct political views..."

"I understand your meaning." Wu Mu said.

"Be timely when closing the net, don't be dragged into the water by the fish..."

Wu Mu put down the phone. It was already seven o'clock in the evening. The office was quiet. He opened the curtains, looked at the lights of East Gate Market, took a deep breath, and picked up the phone after a moment: "Call Yang Cao, Liu Fuqing, and Ke Yun to come to me."

After dinner, the members of the Checkered Skirt Club continued rehearsing until late into the night. Until Liu Shuixin nodded indicating the effect was basically qualified, the dismissal was declared.

Lin Ziqi was young after all and was already excessively sleepy. She fell asleep in the carriage on the way home. Finally, Zhang Yunmi helped her into the house and incidentally stayed overnight at her best friend's home.

At the same time, a meeting was also going on in the Political Security Bureau building in Bairen City—"Project Sun Umbrella" Cross-Department Coordination Briefing.

This was a closed small conference room. Several Senators sat around the round table. Wu Mu hosted the meeting personally. Behind him sat the confidential secretary acting as a stenographer.

Because it was a briefing, apart from work-related Senators: Li Yayang, Commander of Lingao Garrison, and Mu Min, Director of General Affairs Department of National Police, several Senators directly related to this matter also came: Dongmen Chuiyu, Wu Ciren, Yuan Ziguang, Zhang Berlin... Even Oriental Ke and Nan Gonghao, who usually lived in seclusion and loved sleeping in, were summoned.

After briefing on the relevant situation and reiterating that the content of the meeting must be kept secret, Wu Mu invited everyone to express their views and suggestions.

Dongfang Ke spoke first. He restated his previous observations and reiterated at the end: Hope that both the Garrison Battalion and the Political Security Bureau will strengthen security forces to protect the safe conduct of art troupe performances, especially protecting those Senators who do not have the ability to protect themselves.

Li Yayang said: "The Executive Committee has approved your previous request regarding strengthening the security force investment for the Cultural Festival. However, pardon my frankness, Comrade Dongfang should not place too much hope on our Garrison Battalion. The role of garrison soldiers is more of deterrence. Potential enemies will be scared away by a target with more troops, but they will not leave. Instead, they will look for places with relatively weak defense forces to carry out sabotage! So I think Director Wu should bring the role of the Political Security Bureau into full play, to prevent trouble before it happens, and root out the enemies of the Senate in advance! Only in this way can the safe and smooth conduct of various activities of the Cultural Festival be guaranteed!"

Wu Mu answered: "Yes, we have done relevant work. Especially for the situation reported by Comrade Dongfang, we have carried out targeted control deployment. We will strengthen the security of key areas in the next few days. During the process of your Folk Orchestra and Checkered Skirt Club entering and exiting performance and rehearsal venues, I will send staff to follow. Hope the responsible Senators will cooperate."

Wu Ciren picked up: "We cooperate of course. After I received the notification last night, I immediately organized the Senator comrades of the club to discuss. But everyone agreed unanimously that we cannot treat our member Zuo Yami as a suspect for the time being. After all, she has no chance to do any conspiracy or sabotage!"

Dongfang Ke complained with a straight face: "Yeah, getting along with martial artists of unknown origin indeed doesn't constitute any instability factor!"

Wu Ciren was choked speechless. Wu Mu smoothed things over: "Okay, we have done detailed investigation regarding Zuo Yami's situation, and relevant clues are also being followed up. Won't mention much here. By the way, Dongfang, will you conduct a dress rehearsal before the official performance?"

"Yes, just on the previous day. All performance units including Fangcaodi Drama Club have to enter the venue and go through the performance process once. Will you clear the venue then?"

"No, we will do more efficient work. By the way, the General Office has despatched more official carriages and guards in response to the recent security situation. You also stop always riding a bicycle alone. Pay attention to safety, travel by carriage, and don't leave the sight of the accompanying guard."

Dongfang Ke nodded noncommittally.

"Regarding security work, everyone doesn't need to worry too much." Mu Min said, "Our Detective Team of the Tenth Section of the General Affairs Department has been fully dispatched, adopting man-to-man strategy against exposed suspicious elements. They are all professionals with considerable experience. In addition, personnel from the Ninth Section of General Affairs will also join the action. Furthermore, plainclothes police force from the Public Security Division will be mobilized. Ran Yao also issued a request for assistance to the General Staff. More Public Security Army will be transferred to serve as guards at that time. This allows more forces of the Garrison Battalion to be released to perform more important personal guard tasks."

The meeting lasted until midnight. After Wu Mu announced the adjournment, he was not idle but immediately called Yang Cao to the office giving detailed instructions in person for a long time.
