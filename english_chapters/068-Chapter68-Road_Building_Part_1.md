# Chapter 68: Road Building (Part 1)

*(Minor revisions based on reader suggestions.)*

"Commissioner Wang, it seems road-building won't be peaceful." Mei Wan said meaningfully.

"What do you mean?"

"I heard the reconnaissance squad sent to Lingao this morning was attacked at Bairren Rapids." Mei Wan spoke while steering around a large rock. The general public didn't know much about the Sino-American trio's situation, assuming they were also a dispatched recon squad.

"There's such a thing? How do you know? It hasn't been on the internal bulletin yet." The situation Guo Yi had reported after returning was still classified.

"Bodies floated down to the riverbed—anyone with eyes could see. What's there to keep secret?" Mei Wan said. "New environment, new atmosphere—can we please stop carrying over certain braindead habits?"

"What's there to fear? A dozen attacked three, and still got beaten back. Three with minor injuries, but the other side lost several." Wang Luobin feigned nonchalance.

"Can't say that. A few arrows would still make anyone nervous. And people can't work on-site wearing stab-proof gear—too hot."

Along the way, he reported highway construction problems: too few people could operate bulldozers—so many machines yet only two or three running. No hard hats—everyone had an '80 helmet, but wearing steel helmets to work was too exhausting. Suggested rushing a batch of wicker helmets—they'd found willow groves by the river. Drinking water—currently, daily water resupply meant returning to the beach. Bodies were losing minerals fast; salt was needed, but the Planning Committee wouldn't directly issue salt, claiming only the cafeteria could requisition it. After much pleading, they finally agreed it needed Medical/Health Group approval first...

"Also, the Construction Engineering Group has only a few formally assigned personnel—all technicians. Construction workers are all green hands transferred from the basic labor group. No skills? Fine—we can teach. Don't migrant workers learn the same way? But the problem is they swap them out the next day—calling it 'equalizing workload.' Come on, this isn't a communal canteen—can we really do egalitarianism? Right, the previous batch wasn't trained yet, and here comes another new one. Isn't that pointless churning? See how many people came to the site today—over three hundred? How much got done?"

"That's right." Wang Luobin was thoughtful. Indeed, most labor groups sent to the road site today had nothing to do.

"We need to establish a dedicated engineering team for infrastructure construction—with fixed personnel." Mei Wan said. "My requirements aren't high—50 people will do. Heavy labor can be assigned from basic labor."

The two discussed road matters as they arrived at the temporary highway construction headquarters. To facilitate on-site coordination, this location was about 2 kilometers from camp, with simple conditions—no electricity. Just a tent.

Inside, the tent, sun-baked all day, was still hot and stuffy. Drawing boards and surveying equipment were crammed everywhere. Rolled survey maps piled on a large table. Mei Wan presented the planning proposal.

The route was on the Wenlan River's east bank. The east bank had more development space than the west; future expansion could connect with Hongpai, Maniao, and other ports to form an integrated industrial base–port transport system. Modern Lingao's main industrial development zones were also on the Wenlan's west bank.

For 17th-century transmigrators, a complete road system was the foundation for reconstructing modern society. Modern roads facilitated goods and personnel flow, and greatly increased government control over society. Though China was among the first to establish a national road network, the extent and depth of road coverage remained inadequate. Take Hainan: in the Ming, there was only one official island-circling post road; counties had no well-developed major roads—only paths tramped out by people and cattle. Neither official roads nor general paths had hardened surfaces or drainage. "No rain, three inches of dust; rain, a coat of mud" applied equally to Ming-era Hainan.

By comparison, contemporary Europe wasn't much better. Before 1600, road conditions remained poor. Roman-era road-building techniques had been lost; potholes were filled with brush bundles. That weak, easily rotted material was even used as new road foundations. Modern road-building concepts came from Italian Tresaguet (ca. 1587), who first mentioned basic modern road principles in an article: roads must be above the groundwater level; roads need drainage on both sides; build a relatively solid foundation of gravel, then lay a mixed surface of crushed stone and mortar. He also noted this surface required long-term maintenance but was far cheaper than traditional Roman-style stone roads. From the 17th century, European road-building technology and administration entered rapid development.

The transmigrators' road planning was naturally ambitious. This planned highway: 8 kilometers in straight-line distance, 12–16 kilometers total route length, built to Class B military road standards—a road type with throughput under 200 vehicles per day. Design maximum vehicle speed: 40 km/h. Total road-base width: 7 meters; driving lane width: 6 meters, two lanes.

"I have a thought," Wang Luobin said. "Might be wrong. Are you investing too much effort in surveying? Are you trying to build a permanent highway once and for all? Is that necessary now? Build a simple road first, then gradually improve it. The Committee's idea is to connect to Bairren Rapids ASAP. At this rate, forget D+5—it won't be done in a month, right?"

Mei Wan looked at the others. Everyone stayed silent. Bing Feng had calculated rough work volumes; he knew Wang Luobin was right. But only Mei Wan and Zhuo Tianmin understood road and bridge engineering somewhat. Mei Wan, as Building Group leader, was enthusiastic about his proposal—no one wanted to raise the deadline issue.

Seeing his proposal might be rejected, Mei Wan anxiously explained: "This road is already a bit luxurious for us, but planning ahead, building a solid foundation also sets up for future expansion and renovation."

"We've just crossed over; everything needs rebuilding. What to simplify, what to refine—there's no objective standard, but as the actual engineering leads, you can't insist on perfection from a professional standpoint on everything. That's obviously impossible—neither technology nor materials are complete now. Blindly pursuing perfection is like climbing a tree to catch fish." Wang Luobin said.

Zhuo Tianmin, who'd remained silent within the Building Group, suddenly said: "I agree with Commissioner Wang. Road-building can be complex if you make it complex—considering gradient, geological structure, work volume, whether bridges or tunnels are needed, designing construction plans based on surveys... But it can also be simple. Especially when we're just temporarily building a dirt road. Just determine start and end points, intermediate must-reach points, then based on terrain, choose a route and build a simple dirt road. Given the actual survey, the local terrain isn't complicated. On such ground, building a dirt road doesn't even need strict surveying—no major problems."

Zhuo Tianmin's statement made Mei Wan's face suddenly darken. This man—a mechatronics undergraduate with registered consultant and builder certifications—had maintained a low profile in the group because he'd signed up late and had to care for his son. But his professional capability was widely recognized. This had always made Mei Wan somewhat wary.

Mei Wan had originally hoped to showcase his talents to the Committee through this project while building his reputation among the masses—earning public favor through high-quality public construction was an easy approach.

But now, his vision wasn't being endorsed by Wang Luobin, and Zhuo Tianmin had publicly contradicted him—leaving him with a "no big-picture view" critique.

"The beach has hundreds of people and all that material and machinery—everything needs to reach Bairren Rapids ASAP! Our current mission is *getting there*, not *how* to get there. Don't reverse priorities." He stood up. "Your requests—I'll give complete answers tonight. But the plan needs revision. By D+6, the convoy MUST reach Bairren Rapids!"

After the meeting, a deflated Mei Wan, per Wang Luobin's requirements, reorganized and revised the plan. The new road was a simple dirt-surface highway—suitable only for light traffic and conditions where the road could close on rainy days. Given that this highway wouldn't see heavy traffic, and it was now past the lunar mid-autumn with Lingao's rainy season ended, rain wouldn't significantly impact driving.

The next day, road construction finally entered proper mode. Following the direction of "survey, design, and build simultaneously," a temporarily assembled road-building team replaced the noisy, unproductive basic labor groups.

Since they had no 17th-century Wenlan River hydrological data and didn't know historical maximum water levels, they set the route at a margin of 10% above the 20th-century once-in-a-century flood standard.

The road-base used the fill method, suitable for lowlands in plains and hilly areas. To minimize transport, they decided to primarily use roadside-ditch soil, with borrow pits only as supplements.

Construction first calculated the roadside ditch width based on vehicle width, then measured outward from the road-base edge stakes to mark the ditch edge. Normally, lime lines were used for marking, or stakes with ropes. Mei Wan was reluctant to use lime, switching to wood ash for marking.

Soil dug from ditches—the shallow layer was paddy soil or other humus-rich soil, which the construction crew didn't want. Road-base construction best used clay and sandy soil. Both were abundant along the route—very convenient. Since the route was riverine, there was much sandy soil containing pebbles and shells. Filling this directly into the road-base would harm overall strength. Zhuo Tianmin, assigned to soil collection, set up sieves at the excavation site to screen out stones and shells. Pebbles could be construction material; shells—Mei Wan planned to burn them for lime, though he only knew they *could* be burned, not how.

Screened soil was used to fill the road-base. The entire road-base cross-section was stepped, with clay and sandy soil layered alternately. Every 20 centimeters of fill was rolled twice with a road roller. This continued until the road-base reached 1 meter high. Then the soil-excavated ditches on both sides were leveled for drainage. The road-base was essentially complete.

By comparison, the road surface was more complicated. Dirt surfaces needed to be flat and compact—not loose in dry weather, with minimal dust when vehicles passed; in rain, draining quickly. These few engineers had never done road or bridge work. Mei Wan stayed up all night reviewing the textbooks and technical materials he'd brought.
