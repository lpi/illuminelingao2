# Chapter 2152 - Reorganization Training

At the Relief Bureau, all the directors had shown up today. Even those who couldn't attend in person had sent a secretary or adviser to "represent" them. One look at this array and Luo Yangming understood: they were going to talk about money again.

It was now spring, the season when the countryside was caught between harvests—the summer grain hadn't yet come in, and the autumn taxes were even further off. The expenses within the city naturally fell upon the shoulders of the merchants. Chief Xie was also someone who loved grand projects; in barely a month since entering the city, he had already issued over a dozen "documents" pushing for something called "Australian New Policies."

To implement these "New Policies," one needed both manpower and money. Most of the original yamen runners were retained, though under new titles, and many new personnel had been recruited and organized into various "teams"—the "Public Order Team," the "Investigation Team," the "Propaganda Team," the "Labor Team"...

Now there were several hundred people "eating the Hair-Cutting Men's rice" inside and outside the city—in the old days this wouldn't have seemed like much, since the unofficial staff employed by the yamen had numbered even more. But in the past, even a proper yamen runner received only a few *dou* of rice and a few hundred cash per year in official wages, and relied entirely on their own "foraging." The Australians didn't recognize gray income, but they did pay full wages: anyone "eating public rice" received two hundred "standard *jin*" of work-rations per month. This wasn't a large amount, but it was basically enough to keep a family from going hungry. Compared to the Great Ming's practice of paying essentially no wages, this was quite progressive—and it was also the fundamental basis for the Australians' demands for "integrity" from public officials.

All of this meant that the Wuzhou Municipal Government's monthly payroll was an enormous figure. Then there were several thousand prisoners of war and refugees who, though they didn't need to support families, still needed to eat.

Beyond maintaining personnel, there were various reconstruction projects, each requiring money and grain. The funds and grain that Chief Xie had originally levied were being consumed at a rapid pace—the bureau directors had already petitioned him multiple times to "reduce expenditures."

Unexpectedly, Xie Ernin was completely unconcerned, and had instead given the bureau's Managing Director, old Mr. Qiao, who had gone to make the case, quite a talking-to.

"...The money and grain were spent, yes, but they were spent on proper purposes. The money goes out, the common people get it, and then they spend it again—isn't that stimulating the market? You merchants say every day: 'We open our doors for business but there's no trade.' Once the common people have money, naturally there will be trade. Who benefits if not the merchants?"

This convoluted reasoning left old Mr. Qiao utterly speechless, but the word "economize" was clearly off the table now.

Since Chief Xie wouldn't "reduce the flow," the only option was to "open new sources." Lately the Relief Bureau had done nothing but wrangle and argue over fundraising for various projects.

These past few days, the Bureau had been deliberating on the restoration of two pontoon bridges. These were matters Chief Xie particularly valued, so all the gentlemen at the Bureau valued them particularly as well, meeting daily to discuss how to raise the necessary funds and grain.

Technically, there was nothing difficult about repairing the pontoon bridges: the iron chains had been severed, true, but both ends were still tethered to the iron posts on either bank. Following the chains, the labor teams had already hauled the sunken portions out of the river. The missing sections could be forged anew—the city had both blacksmiths and pig iron, and as long as there was money, they could fire up the furnaces. Just reconnect the links and it would be done.

What made the bureau members and the craftsmen in charge of the repairs scratch their heads was the lack of boats. The Gui River pontoon bridge required 56 vessels; the Canglong Bridge, the longest pontoon bridge in Lingnan, required 142. Moreover, these boats all had to be fairly large vessels at least three meters wide—small dinghies wouldn't do.

The original boats from both pontoon bridges had either been destroyed or lost when the bridges were wrecked during the Battle of Wuzhou. Afterwards, the Beiwei Army had gradually recovered some stranded vessels from the riverbanks. As for the local naval warships and civilian boats, some had fled before the battle, and others had been set ablaze during the government forces' collapse—barely one in a hundred survived. The Beiwei Army and the Relief Bureau had searched exhaustively, but found only a small number of boats, and considering vessel dimensions and tonnage, fewer than thirty were usable. That wasn't even enough to restore the Gui River pontoon bridge alone.

Building new boats was possible, of course—the local boatwrights were desperate for work—but shipbuilding wasn't like hiring people to fill wall breaches with earth, a day's work for a pittance. Boatwrights couldn't work for free, and low wages wouldn't do either—otherwise a month's job could stretch to a year, with guaranteed leaking within three months of launching. The shipwrights had their guilds too, colluding among themselves and difficult to deal with. When the bureau directors calculated the expenses, they all grimaced secretly: without another round of "Reasonable Burden," this simply couldn't be done.

But collecting again so soon didn't sit well with the wealthy households—it had been barely a month since the last collection, and even the Great Ming didn't collect taxes at such a pace. So though everyone knew the money had to be collected, no one was willing to bring it up. The room full of people could only sigh and moan.

"Get up! Get up, you lazy dogs!"

Before Yang Erdong could react, a heavy kick landed on his leg, the pain jolting him alert. He scrambled to his feet from his spot against the wall.

"Fall in!" At this piercing shout, soldiers who had been scattered along the walls of the Three General's Residence rushed toward the open square in front of the gate—this was the first full assembly of the Wuzhou National Army Battalion.

Yang Erdong was momentarily confused, but he understood "fall in." He hurried to follow the others.

When Wuzhou had fallen, Yang Erdong hadn't fled the city in panic like the other stranded soldiers. Instead, he'd discarded his weapons, stripped a suit of clothes from a corpse, and mixed in with the refugees, planning to slip out of the city when the opportunity arose.

But he hadn't expected that once the Australians arrived, they'd immediately rounded up all the refugees and placed them in centralized housing, issuing daily tokens exchangeable for porridge. Except for local refugees who could return home freely, everyone else was treated as "labor" who had to work for their food. Yang Erdong was from Guizhou and couldn't imitate the Guangzhou Mandarin well enough to pass as a local, so naturally he couldn't get away.

After a few days laboring in the work team, his sturdy physique and experience as a household guard got him selected for the "Militia Team." His daily duties were standing guard, patrolling, and keeping night watch—easier than the labor team by far. As for switching allegiances, he wasn't particularly concerned: all he knew was soldiering, and what did it matter whom he served? As long as they fed him and paid him.

There were several dozen Hair-Cutting Men serving as officers in the Militia Team, and even by Yang Erdong's "elite" standards, these were rare "crack troops." Setting everything else aside, just the way a man stood before you—that straight, sharp bearing and those cold eyes—made you understand "I am not someone to trifle with" and made the rank-and-file obediently compliant. Of course, there were some who didn't believe it—who thought the Australians won battles only because of their superior firearms—and insisted on showing off their own martial prowess. They inevitably ended up crying for their mothers.

Yet fierce as these men were, they were easy to get along with. First, they didn't put on airs or abuse the soldiers below them. Second, everyone was treated equally: when physical labor came around, everyone pitched in, officers included. Meals were shared as well, the same food all around, with no special treatment.

This astonished Yang Erdong, who had spent years as a household guard—what was the point of being an officer then?

Before he could think through the philosophical question of what soldiering was for, the National Army Battalion arrived in Wuzhou.

As soon as the National Army Battalion reached Wuzhou and garrisons and defense areas were assigned, Qian Duo began reorganization training.

Though the National Army had now expanded to four companies, most of the soldiers were products of hasty expansion, mainly recruited from Ming army deserters. With time so short, they hadn't received much training; their military and political quality was unreliable. The National Army Command had issued specific instructions for reorganization training.

Qian Duo stood in full dress on a wooden platform overlooking this makeshift drill ground, surveying the rabble of three companies below.

As previously arranged, the only company composed of veteran naturalized soldiers had taken over the other companies' defense sectors, giving these three companies time to reorganize.

In terms of physique and health, the personnel of these three companies were above average by local standards and basically qualified as military recruits. But Qian Duo knew all too well: most of these men had received poor training and lacked combat experience. Old army habits ran deep. Not only did they take killing, burning, and raping during battle as commonplace, but shirking and malingering were endemic.

The three hundred-odd men below wore identical National Army uniforms—everything brand new—and apart from lacking rifles, they looked no different from the Attached Company. But the formation was crooked, and their bearing was a mixed bag. Those in front at least knew to puff out their chests and suck in their bellies in a show of "martial bearing," while those in back stood however they pleased.

"You are now National Army soldiers under the command of the Council of Elders!" Qian Duo bellowed. "No matter what you did before, no matter what rank you held in the Ming army, you are now glorious National Army soldiers! You must always remember that you are soldiers of the Council of Elders and of the people! Take pride in being soldiers of the Council's military. Obey discipline, fight without fear. Defend the flag with your blood and your lives!"

He swept his gaze over the dead-fish stares of the National Army soldiers below and roared: "Now hear the proclamation! The Military Regulations for All Armed Forces Personnel, approved by the Council of Elders!"

A sergeant immediately stepped up and howled in a voice that was nearly a shriek:

" "

"Article One! All actions are to be taken on command!"

"Article Two! Do not take so much as a needle or thread from the common people!"

"Article Three! All captured goods must be turned over to the public!"

...

These military regulations were nothing new to the National Army troops who had come from Guangzhou—their personal copies of the *Soldier's Handbook* contained them. But for soldiers like Yang Erdong, who had been "locally conscripted," it was all quite novel. By the time the reading was finished, he had a second thought: "What's the point of soldiering like this?"

After the regulations were read out, Qian Duo surveyed the soldiers below, who now showed faint signs of unease, and declared in a booming voice: "Since its founding, the Council of Elders' armed forces have campaigned north and south, never once defeated. All enemies have crumbled like clay chickens and pottery dogs—and it is because of this iron discipline! Remember this always!"
