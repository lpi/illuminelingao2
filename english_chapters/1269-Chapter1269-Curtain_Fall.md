# Chapter 1269 - Curtain Fall

Thus, this plan was carried out regardless of life or death—if they were Chinese, they probably wouldn't have done such a crazy and uncertain thing, but the desperate gambling spirit of Tō Tarō's gang was no less than that of the Imperial elites in the other timeline.

Tō Tarō once again sneaked into Camp Alpha with Ning Liujin under the guise of helping deliver goods and saw Fusong as he wished.

"...We plan to rescue the Young Master like this tonight. Please make preparations early," Tō Tarō whispered in Japanese. To prevent him from feeling fearful, he added, "We have made complete preparations and will rescue the Young Master off the island even at the cost of our lives."

"Go do it." A look of calm resolve inconsistent with his age appeared on Fusong's face.

That night, the moon was dim and stars were sparse, but the wind and waves weren't high. On a small hill near Guningtou Beach, the closest point to the mainland, inside a camouflaged observation post, Xu Ke was monitoring the beach with binoculars.

According to the estimate: After Tō Tarō's gang swapped Zheng Sen out of Camp Alpha using the "plum for a peach" strategy, they would come here to execute the smuggling. To smuggle across the strait at night, whether by small boat or swimming, they had to take the shortest route. Guningtou was closest to the mainland, so the possibility of them entering the water here was extremely high.

Clicking sounds came from his walkie-talkie; this was the signal from the SRT members tailing the escapees: the fugitives were heading towards Guningtou as predicted.

Xu Ke immediately raised his infrared binoculars to search the beach: sure enough, seven or eight people were running wildly on the beach under the cover of night, one of whom seemed to be carrying something on his back. He immediately adjusted the focus and saw clearly that it was a child on the back.

"They really came!" Xu Ke nodded secretly.

Although he not only went easy on this operation but also gave them a push, the boldness and daring of this group were indeed admirable. The final smuggling depended on themselves; if they were unlucky and all drowned in the strait, no one else could be blamed.

Unaware that someone was secretly monitoring them, Tō Tarō's group arrived on the beach, took out the bamboo tubes and ropes hidden in the reefs earlier, and clumsily tied them to their bodies. Tō Tarō tied bamboo tubes for Fusong and whispered, "Young Master, don't be afraid. We will push you across."

"I'm not afraid. I can swim."

"Good, let's go." Tō Tarō said, calling Honda over. "Honda, you have the best swimming skills. You take the Young Master."

"Yes, I will protect the Young Master with my life."

"Listen, everyone, we must send the Young Master back to the mainland even if we risk our lives! If Honda can't hold on, you guys take turns!"

"Osu!"

"Bastards, keep it down!"

Tō Tarō turned his head and saw Ning Liujin hadn't tied on bamboo tubes yet. He said, "You tie them on too and come with us."

Ning Liujin's face turned pale: "This lowly one cannot swim..."

Tō Tarō drew his wakizashi with a *shing* and stabbed it in. Ning Liujin collapsed on the beach without even time to scream.

The group then entered the water, swimming towards the opposite beach—days ago, Tō Tarō had already sent someone to secretly escape back to the mainland. At this moment, that person lit three torches on the opposite side. Swimmers in the strait could accurately judge if their direction deviated as long as they kept an eye on the three light sources in front of them.

Xu Ke watched them bobbing in the waves, gradually drifting away. He lowered his binoculars: "Tell the SRT to fire. Give them a send-off!"

Only Ning Liujin's corpse remained on the beach. Soldiers closed his eyes which were wide open in pain; his mouth was agape as if trying to shout an unwilling cry.

"Pity. This lad was quite capable. With some training, he might have been a seed for intelligence work." Xu Ke watched the soldiers carry away Ning Liujin's body and said with some regret, "List him in the Intelligence Bureau's External Collaborator Martyr Scroll and find a sunny spot in the cemetery to bury him."

Zheng Sen's escape didn't cause much of a ripple; instead, the news of his father's definite death caused a greater shock. Zhang Tumu and Xu Ke conducted a one-by-one comparison based on dozens of fingerprints lifted from various places and finally confirmed that a set of fingerprints appearing in all places Zheng Zhilong frequented and on items he commonly used should be his own. Comparing this set of fingerprints with those on the headless corpse confirmed they basically matched.

Then, several of Zheng Zhilong's concubines and personal page boys were brought out from the prisoner camp to identify the physical characteristics of the headless corpse. Finally, it was confirmed that this was Zheng Zhilong himself.

This news was subsequently transmitted back to Lingao. The Senate ordered: All forts in Lingao, Kaohsiung, and Hong Kong to fire an eleven-gun salute. The Propaganda Department subsequently issued a "Rebel Zheng Beheaded" extra. This extra was distributed not only in the Senate-ruled areas but also in coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian provinces in the form of leaflets through the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's channels.

A few days later, early in the morning on October 10th, engineers simultaneously set fires in various villages, towns, and camps on Anping, Greater and Lesser Kinmen, Xiamen, and Gulangyu, detonating large amounts of explosives placed inside houses beforehand—the captured large quantities of Zheng army gunpowder were of poor quality and unsafe to transport, so they were simply used on the spot to demolish sturdier buildings.

Explosions of tens of thousands of catties of gunpowder rose one after another. Black smoke wrapped in raging fire shot straight into the sky. Burning villages and forts were everywhere along Zhangzhou Bay.

Engineers held roll calls at various assembly points, then under Marine escort, lined up to rhythm of drums to cross the streets which had begun to burn, boarding the Daihatsu landing craft waiting in the bay batch by batch. The First Fleet, the last to leave Zhangzhou Bay, weighed anchor and set sail in the rolling black smoke, leaving the bay which had been reduced almost to ruins.

Operation Overlord thus came to a close.

Zhangzhou Bay, originally bustling with ships coming and going, a forest of masts and gathering of merchants, was left with only a dead silence. Public and private property on coastal islands and inside Anping City was looted clean, and the population was entirely taken away. According to Xu Ke's estimate, even if the Zheng family had enough funds, it would take a year or half to regroup here. This was enough for the Senate's trade war to exert its effectiveness.

Ming Qiu stood on the bridge looking at this scene of rolling black smoke with very mixed feelings—as a naval officer who spent his entire career in peace, coming to this new timeline by coincidence and commanding such a "complete victory" joint amphibious campaign in his twilight years, he had already left his name in the naval history of this new world.

But the things done in Zhangzhou Bay by this Navy of the "Senate and People" under his command could be called "Three Alls" (Kill All, Burn All, Loot All). Although the Voight-Kampff Army didn't massacre or kill indiscriminately, such large-scale destruction of buildings in the entire region regardless of military or civilian use, and the looting of the population, still made his conscience uneasy. Especially seeing thousands of civilians supporting the old and carrying the young, taking their meager possessions and boarding ships under the coercion of bayonets, leaving their homes forever. In the whole process, inevitably many people died on the streets, families broken...

The morning sun cast its light on the deck. The rising sun of the new empire had appeared on the horizon, but he wouldn't live to see the moment this regime reached its zenith—he didn't know if this was fortunate or unfortunate.

"I am old... I lived in an era of peace and prosperity for too long..." He held the railing, watching the plow of the warship slice through the sea surface driven by the roaring steam engine, thinking this as waves churned up.

The first rays of golden sunlight in the morning crossed the wide-open window, penetrated the curtains made of thin gauze, and shone straight onto the floor of the room, extending slowly and steadily forward along the ground until the sunlight reached the end of the room and climbed onto the vermilion rosewood Nanjing *babu* bed (canopy bed), making the intricate floral relief carvings on the bed frame shine, while the mechanical clock on the desk in the room swung tick-tock.

"Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding—"

The clock hands pointed exactly to 6:30. The originally quiet room was instantly broken by this sudden sound. The alarm clock on the chicken-wing wood flat-top desk struck its bells, shaking its whole body left and right, announcing the arrival of a new day. Until a hand appeared, grabbed the restless alarm clock, and pressed it gently. The whole room instantly returned to silence.

Chuqing rewound the alarm clock spring and gently placed it back, turned and walked past the flat-top desk, took clothes from the shelf, came to the bedside, lifted the bed curtain, stepped into the canopy bed, placed clean clothes on the bedside stool, lifted the inner quilt curtain, and said to the inside of the bed: "Husband, clothes."

Wu Nanhai stretched his waist. Actually, he had woken up before the alarm rang. In this 17th-century Lingao with no internet and almost no nightlife, waking up on time in the morning was much easier than in the old timeline.

Sufficient sleep and a regular life filled him with vitality upon waking. Wu Nanhai dressed calmly under Chuqing's service. Unlike other Senators who continued the habit of wearing old timeline clothing, he preferred Ming-style long robes. Of course, the long robes were improved by several female Senators and the cooperative's tailors; the style was closer to the *changshan* of the Republic of China era, basically belonging to the category of "Hanfu" in another timeline. But compared to modern clothing, it was still slightly complex and required help to dress neatly.

This was Wu Nanhai's home. Although the General Office built apartments specifically for Senators in Bairen City and Wu Nanhai could be allocated one by lottery according to convention, Wu Nanhai was unwilling to leave his cozy nest in the farm. Also, being at the farm was convenient for work at any time, so he submitted a report to the General Office requesting to establish an Agricultural Committee dormitory area in Nanhai Farm and giving up the apartment in Bairen New City.

Xiao Zhishan naturally couldn't oppose this kind of dedication to work openly and aboveboard, so he cancelled the lottery qualifications in Bairen New City for Wu Nanhai and a group of Senators willing to live in the farm, changing it to building an Agricultural Committee Senator Dormitory Area within Nanhai Farm.
