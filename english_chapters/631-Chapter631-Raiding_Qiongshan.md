# Chapter 631 - Raiding Qiongshan

The targets for breaking stockades had to be chosen very carefully. First, they had to have a bad reputation among the common people; second, they had to be powerful locally. Only in this way could it serve to warn others without frightening the common people too much or stirring up hatred against the common enemy.

Choosing targets wasn't difficult. Since stabilizing Lingao, the intelligence department had begun collecting intelligence on neighboring Danzhou and Chengmai counties for future regime takeover and warfare. The transmigrator group had a fairly comprehensive grasp of the situation in these counties.

Finally, You Laohu and Yu Zhiqian circled a few local tyrants, all typical ones who colluded with officials to oppress the villagers. Moreover, they were mainly clan landlords. Destroying one family would make a powerful clan completely lose control over the locality. This was more crucial than simply eliminating a band of local tyrants.

In the following week, Yu Zhiqian led his troops on an armed parade through Chengmai County, breaking two stockades and forcing many villages to provide grain and labor. They obtained large amounts of money, grain, and people. Most captured prisoners were sent by militia to Lingao for dispersed settlement. He only escorted over a hundred able-bodied men and dozens of captured local tyrants and their lackeys to the foot of Chengmai County City. The men continued helping dig trenches and build earthworks.

Originally You Laohu only intended to bluff, but now with plenty of grain and people, and seeing Chengmai County had no elite soldiers or capable generals, a small skirmish under the city walls—though casualties were few, the sight of township braves routing at the first touch of Minié rifles greatly boosted the morale of both transmigrators and indigenous soldiers.

With the aid of 12-pounder mountain howitzers, Minié rifles, and explosives, breaking stockades—an operation of some difficulty for ordinary bandits or even Ming troops—was effortless for Yu Zhiqian and the others. Yu Zhiqian's unit suffered total casualties of only nine infantry wounded, one militia killed, and eleven wounded. If not for the time and effort spent collecting supplies, they could have broken a few more stockades.

After every stockade break, Yu Zhiqian always let a few people escape to the prefectural city to raise the alarm—You Laohu had long set up ambush posts outside Chengmai's city gates; anyone attempting to enter the city to raise the alarm was hanged on trees outside. Eventually, no one went to the county town anymore.

Captured local tyrants and lackeys were hanged in batches on big trees lining the Chengmai-Qiongshan official road. For a time, the whole of Chengmai County shook; gentry and merchants in the county were terrified, fleeing in droves by night from the east and west gates. Yu Zhiqian instructed the secret sentries outside not to capture them, letting them flee.

You Laohu and Yu Zhiqian discussed: with grain and men on hand, why not set up a stockade under Chengmai city as a forward base? So they sent someone back to Maniao for instructions. Seeing them making such a huge commotion, He Ming sent another infantry company and several teams of student soldiers from the training unit to reinforce them.

You Laohu drove the laborers to build formal earthen works around Chengmai and sent people to repair the dock and dredge the harbor at the seaside. Mei Wan also simply sent an engineering team to guide the construction, utilizing labor to repair roads.

While Chengmai was making a huge commotion, on the Qiongshan-Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion-Chengmai official road line, the Special Reconnaissance Team led by Ye Mengyan was also actively operating. Leading a thirty-man team, he infiltrated all the way to Qiongshan County, setting up several reconnaissance posts along the way, extending the early warning line to Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion City. Then he led his men along the Nandu River to the Jiazi Coal Mine.

Tang Menglong had long received warning that the Ming army might soon launch a suppression campaign against Lingao.

Theoretically, the Jiazi Coal Mine was the Hai family's asset and officials shouldn't touch it. Moreover, being in a remote inland area with poor transport, military action against it would be difficult. But potential danger of attack always existed. The Administration Council's instruction to Tang Menglong was: stop all coal shipments, stop Hai family wharf operations, keep only local personnel, with specific work handled by Lin Baiguang. At the mine, temporarily shrink production scale, step up military training for miners, and strengthen mine fortifications.

When Ye Mengyan arrived at Jiazi Coal Mine, production had completely stopped; only the coal washing plant and briquette factory continued processing stockpiles. Miners were fully armed, practicing bayonet drills in the open. Tang Menglong had built several new blockhouses at the wharf and mining area, each capable of garrisoning five or six soldiers, stocked with many bamboo tubes of explosives.

"He Ming has obtained authorization from the Executive Committee: if necessary, you can lead your people to evacuate. You can withdraw now if you want," Ye Mengyan said. "You only have one platoon and thirty-some Minié rifles here; you definitely can't hold if the enemy main force attacks."

"What would the government army attack this coal mine for?" Tang Menglong said carelessly. "You walked the mountain road along the way. Would the government army ignore proper business, not attack Lingao, and instead bother to march this road to fight? Besides, this mine is considered the Hai family's property anyway."

"This is just in case," Ye Mengyan said. "Anyway, I've passed the message. If you want to withdraw, do it quickly. The main government force hasn't reached Hainan yet; it's easy to coordinate your main group's withdrawal now."

Tang Menglong considered for a moment: "I won't withdraw. There are several hundred people here, men and women. Evacuation is very inconvenient. If intercepted by government troops on the way, losses would be huge. Besides, there's a lot of equipment and material here; infrastructure cost a huge price. If we leave, villagers and bandits in the mountains will take the chance to loot and steal. Rebuilding after defeating the enemy would be another huge investment."

Since Tang Menglong decided not to withdraw, Ye Mengyan didn't insist. He left the explosives and some hand grenades he brought with Tang Menglong, and left a squad of spec ops members to assist in defense.

Ye Mengyan led the remaining men to infiltrate back to the Haikou area from the mountains. His second mission was to harass local government and garrison troops in Qiongshan. The spec ops team had few people but good equipment; however, lacking heavy weapons, besieging a city like You Laohu wasn't viable. Knowing that sniping a few passing messengers had little value, he simply led the team to Danying Mountain outside Qiongshan County City.

"Set up a cannon on this high point, and wouldn't Qiongshan surrender immediately?" Ye Mengyan lowered his binoculars, muttering. He wore a set of civilian-version US military jungle camouflage BDU from the Vietnam War era. Slung on his shoulder was a VZ68 submachine gun. No helmet. Behind him were twelve young men hand-picked from his detachment, dressed identically, except using less convenient SKS semi-automatics. These spec ops members sat silently in the woods eating rations and drinking water.

The entire Qiongshan County City lay at his feet. Built against mountains and facing water. A big river flowed past the south and east gates; outside the west gate was a man-made moat. Only outside the north gate was there nothing—like most Hainan county towns, Qiongshan's north gate was built but never opened; though it had a tower and gate, the inside was blocked by bricks.

It was evident the city's defenses were poor. Even by 17th-century Ming standards, it wasn't great, just passable. Ye Mengyan saw three city gates open, completely unguarded. Infiltrating all the way here, apart from哨 posts and small patrols ten li outside Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion City, there were no reconnaissance or precautionary measures along the road—could this be called "pre-war state"? Practically child's play. Thinking of this, he felt extreme contempt for the Ming officials.

"Detachment Leader! We sneaked all the way to Qiongshan; what next?" A member asked him.

"Higher-ups want harassment. I think this place can't withstand harassment. If we charge down, we could probably take Qiongshan County City." Ye Mengyan smiled. "Tricky situation."

"The streets outside the city are bustling; why don't we set a fire and burn the Qiongshan suburbs?" A member said. "Once this fire burns, old Wang Zunde will be forced to make the government army cross the sea."

Ye Mengyan chuckled: "Rotten idea. What if everything burns down?" He thought, actually it was a good method to shake Wang Zunde. But the Planning Institute, Administration Council, and Senate wouldn't forgive him—though for different motives.

"Burn the suburbs, and after we win we have to provide relief to victims," Ye Mengyan said. "Think of something else!"

At noon that day, Ye Mengyan led the spec ops team down from Danying Mountain. He decided to choose the East Gate Market Street outside Qiongshan's east gate as the demonstration site. Many pedestrians and shops here; it would cause the biggest sensation.

He left a covering group using automatic rifles on high ground outside the market. If large enemy groups rushed out from the city, they would use automatic fire to block. He himself led seven or eight men to the entrance of the East Gate Suburb Street. Though outside the city, there was a wooden barrier guarded by two militia.

Seeing the appearance of Ye Mengyan and others dressed in motley colors and hung with gear, the militia's first reaction wasn't fear or nervousness, but curiosity. One carrying a spear even stepped forward to see clearly. Upon seeing their short hair stubble, the militia seemed to suddenly realize, instantly dropping the spear in terror and running toward the city gate, shouting at the top of his lungs:

"Hair Rebels are here! Hair Rebels are here!"

Ye Mengyan waved his submachine gun; team members swarmed in. Two members quickly controlled the barrier entrance. He led the others charging straight along the street toward the city gate.

Not a market day today; few pedestrians on the street. Seeing a group of weird-looking people swarm in, everyone froze momentarily.

A few militia at the city gate seemed to react. Seeing few enemies, with a shout, they surged out of the gate tunnel with swords and spears to fight. A member behind Ye Mengyan immediately threw two hand grenades.

Grenades exploded in the gate tunnel; smoke filled the air instantly, amid wails and groans. The street fell into chaos; pedestrians hid in shops and alleys on both sides. Ye Mengyan knew they were few and couldn't stay long. He quickly pasted two Fubo Army notices on the fence by the gate. After pasting, he didn't leave immediately but shouted to the commoners on the street, saying they were Fubo Army troops coming only to warn the government, not to harm commoners, so don't be afraid. Shopkeepers on both sides held their breath listening, but no one dared speak. Ye Mengyan then turned and withdrew. Just then, SKS-D rifles rang out one after another; several militia on the gate tower trying to shoot arrows were killed by the covering group before they could draw their bows.

After withdrawing from the East Gate Street, Ye Mengyan's squad walked a few li then he ordered everyone to ambush at a bend in the post road. Sure enough, minutes later, over a hundred militia and village braves chased after them, led by a man on horseback wielding a long spear. Soon they approached within fifty meters.

Ye Mengyan tapped the marksman in the squad: "Shoot the one riding the horse!"

At the gunshot, the mounted leader fell. The braves around him fell into disarray. A row of hand grenades from the squad exploded in the dense crowd, knocking down a swath. Those not killed or wounded turned and ran back toward the county town. Members ambushing the rear threw another row of grenades, killing and wounding many. The enemy collapsed; regardless of roads, they scattered to flee.

Having fought a beautiful ambush and knowing the enemy dared not chase again, Ye Mengyan ordered the leader's horse retrieved. Members asked him to ride; he shook his head:

"I don't know how to ride..."

Privately he thought bringing a horse would make further harassment operations impossible, but he couldn't bear to discard it—it was a Mongolian horse, rare locally, much more majestic than the small fruit-tree horses.

Having made a big scene at Qiongshan was enough; might as well retreat to Chengmai to rest a few days before coming back. Thinking this, he ordered:

"Bring the horse, we return to Chengmai first!"

Members quickly cleaned the battlefield. Ye Mengyan ordered the pursuing leader's head cut off and hung on a roadside tree. Someone found a beautiful short sword on the body and handed it to Ye Mengyan.

"Captain, this thing is beautiful; you keep it." The member said.

Ye Mengyan looked at the short sword; dark green leather sheath inlaid with filigree gold and silver patterns, ancient style, clearly no ordinary object.

"All captures go to the public; turn it in." Ye Mengyan wasn't interested in so-called "divine weapons" of cold steel, just thought it looked nice. He tossed it into his backpack and ordered everyone to pack up and retreat immediately.

To prevent interception by Haikou Coastal Defense Battalion troops, they left the main road and detoured. Within a few hours, they retreated to You Laohu's camp under Chengmai city.

You Laohu's camp was now a considerable stockade. He drove seven or eight hundred male and female laborers. Under militia guard, led by the construction team, they built the camp and leveled roads daily.

You Laohu threw a banquet for Ye Mengyan in his headquarters.

His so-called headquarters was a temporary shed. Furnished very comfortably inside, with all kinds of chairs and even a large red mahogany bed. Clearly looted from big households in the countryside.

Hearing about Ye Mengyan's scene at Qiongshan's East Gate suburb, You Laohu was excited—he was a chaotic neutral type who loved trouble; such dramatic and lively scenes fascinated him.

"Little Ye, you really showed off this time." You Laohu slapped his thigh. "It's much more boring here. Sticking our butts out fixing roads and building stockades facing a lousy county town all day." Saying this, he instructed the company quartermaster to prepare food and treats for Ye Mengyan's team.

Soon a lavish spread was on the table, centering on a large platter of spare ribs. Each rib was reddish-yellow and bright, smelling fragrant; crispy outside, tender inside, rich in flavor.

"Done by a cook Old Yu caught. Skill is superb." You Laohu gnawed one clean with lightning speed and grabbed another.

Yu Zhiqian smiled: "Strictly speaking, we're violating discipline..."

"Discipline," You Laohu wanted to say "screw discipline," but thought he might get caught out, so changed to: "Anyway, sent to Lingao he's a cook; staying here he's a cook. I'm just using him first." He pointed at the ribs. "Target ribs are marinated with honey, crispy and tasty, a bit like Cantonese char siu but not quite. Endless aftertaste! When I get back, I have to make my life secretary learn from this cook."

Besides ribs, there were several plates of fresh vegetables and other dishes. Just no wine.

"Food is great. Where's the supply from?" Ye Mengyan wondered—Logistics absolutely wouldn't send fresh vegetables and raw meat.

"Old Yu got it from hitting big households—chicken, duck, fish, meat, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar enough!" You Laohu shook his head. "Actually there's plenty of wine, but can't drink." He smacked his lips regretfully. "Vegetables and grain were all requisitioned from various stockades. Since we broke a few and killed a bunch, stockades all over Chengmai are scared witless; they'd give up their wives if asked."

"Meat hasn't been quarantined..."

"Don't eat if you don't want to." You Laohu started his fourth rib. Seeing the ribs disappearing, Ye Mengyan hurriedly joined the gluttony.

While the three were eating and drinking, an orderly reported: The Planning Institute representative had arrived.

"Our good days are over." You Laohu shook his head. "Invite him in quickly."

Naturally, Yu Zhiqian hitting big households in Chengmai attracted Planning Institute attention. To bring captured materials and manpower into the system quickly, Wu De sent a special search team led by a Planning Institute representative.

"Local use of spoils ends in a messy account," he said seriously when giving orders to the representative. "Now You Laohu's detachment is hitting local tyrants under Chengmai, gaining much wealth, grain, and people. You go register spoils; some grain and non-staple food can be allocated locally to the detachment, but procedures must be sound."
