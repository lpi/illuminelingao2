# Chapter 1600 - The Boy

"What?" Huang Zhen didn't react for a moment.

"This month... my 'that' didn't come."

"What 'that'? Speak clearly," suddenly, Huang Zhen froze: "Your period didn't come?" You Xiu nodded shyly. Huang Zhen was not a novice lad, and he also understood medical principles, knowing what this meant. "How long has it been?"

"About ten days late."

"This is fine. Usually, women's menstrual disorders are common. Maybe you have been too busy with work recently, or maybe you ate cold food."

"I'm usually very punctual."

Huang Zhen checked her pulse, and sure enough, there was a sign of pregnancy. He lost his composure for a moment. He didn't expect that with separation by death or life imminent, such a thing would happen!

Huang Zhen had no idea what to do at this moment. He had married twice when he was at Mt. Hua, but both wives died of illness, leaving no children. Thinking that he was probably destined to be without descendants and would likely die alone in old age, he had given up the thought of remarrying. He never expected that in this dragon's pool and tiger's den, he not only found a land of tenderness but now also had news of joy.

In the past, this would truly be a great and beautiful thing. But tomorrow he would have to meet the heroes escaping from East Gate Market, flee into the Li area together, and try to leave Hainan Island. Although someone was said to be receiving them, it was likely a narrow escape from death, and it was unknown if they could escape smoothly.

Seeing his solemn face and fluctuating expression, not only showing no joy but revealing a trace of embarrassment and difficulty, You Xiu immediately started crying.

"You heartless man, do you despise me and this child?" She suddenly paused again, "You must have another wife and children at home! You deceived me so bitterly!" After saying that, she burst into loud wailing.

Huang Zhen was helpless, thinking that this was really an "ill-fated relationship." Anyway, although life and death were uncertain starting tomorrow, if he could leave a son or daughter, it could be considered leaving a descendant for the Huang family.

Thinking of this, he comforted her gently: "How could I despise you? I am a widower with no children. It's just that I run such a medicine shop alone and have to support you and your children..."

"How do I need you to support me?" Hearing his words, You Xiu couldn't help but smile through her tears, "Brother Huang, don't worry. I know you are a person to be entrusted to. But in this world, the word 'status' is the most important..."

Huang Zhen smiled bitterly in secret. Thinking that You Xiu used this opportunity to force a marriage, he thought that everything he said today was actually a lie, so he could only say: "You can rest assured about this. I will always give you a status."

"I knew you were the most reliable." You Xiu was full of joy and burrowed into his arms, "It's late at night. Tonight, let this slave serve the master well in a different way..."

While they were entangled in bed, a team of Japanese Public Security Army soldiers silently entered Nanbao Town. The final arrest was about to begin.

The east was faintly showing the white of a fish's belly. Zhuo Yifan and Sima Qiudao finally arrived at a small hill near Nanbao.

Although with the effect of the Hair Thieves' medicine, Zhuo Yifan could support himself to walk and did not have a fever, he had lost too much blood after all. His qi was deficient and his strength floating. Stopping and going along the way, he originally thought he could arrive at Nanbao late at night to contact Huang Zhen and the others. Unexpectedly, he barely arrived here until the roosters crowed.

Seeing that it was almost dawn, entering the town rashly was very dangerous. They hid in a forest on a small hill, not far from the town. There were several households below the hill. The two drilled into the depths of the forest, saw that there was no one around, and sat under a tree to rest.

"Brother Zhuo, we should count as having escaped. There are no pursuers behind. You rest for now. After dawn, I will go to the town to find Huang Zhen and the others, and everyone will try to escape together!"

Zhuo Yifan ran all night, his energy exhausted to the extreme, almost unable to speak. Sima Qiudao changed his dressing and gave him medicine again, and took some dry food for him to eat. Fortunately, he had replenished fresh water along the road, so he didn't have to risk going out to find water now.

Sima Qiudao let Zhuo Yifan lie down to rest. He had been leading Zhuo Yifan all the way and was quite tired. Besides, it was too early now. So he leaned against the tree to nap.

In a trance, he seemed to hear a rustling sound. Wrong! Someone! He immediately sat up pinching his knife, looked up, and saw a thin and small figure flashing past more than ten steps away.

Sima Qiudao was horrified, his sleepiness instantly disappearing without a trace. He leaped up, drawing a short dagger with one hand, and pounced fiercely in the direction where the figure disappeared!

Sima Qiudao's movement technique was extremely fast. With a leap, he pressed the person in front to the ground, raised the short dagger in his hand, and forced it against the other party's throat.

Looking closely, it was a boy of about ten years old. He wore "Short Hair," a blue cloth buttoned jacket, and his pant legs were stuck with a lot of mud. He was barefoot, with a pair of cloth shoes threaded with thin rope hanging around his neck. He also carried a canvas, school bag. Besides a crumpled student ID card, there was nothing on him.

"Who are you? What are you doing here?" Sima Qiudao shouted in a low voice.

Seeing the man in front of him with choppy hair, clothes covered in mud, and holding a knife in his hand, the boy was terrified. He stammered in reply: "Picking some herbs before school—to sell in town on the way..."

Sima Qiudao saw that there were indeed some herbs in the small bamboo basket next to him and asked: "Are you from Nanbao Town? How far is it from the town?"

The boy trembled and said: "I... I don't live in the town, just in the village down the hill. It's less than one kilometer from the town..."

"Going to school—where do you go to school?"

"Nanbao Primary School... newly opened recently. My family is poor and couldn't afford school originally. Later, a Chief came and said that going to Junior Primary School doesn't cost money, and they also provide a meal and a set of clothes." He begged again, "My family is poor, I have no money..."

At this time, Zhuo Yifan also woke up. Seeing this, he came over and said: "Little brother, don't be afraid. We are not bad people. We don't want your money." As he spoke, he opened the school bag. Inside, except for a sweet potato wrapped in banana leaves, were books and stationery: several "Australian style" bound books, notebooks, pencils, and the like. They were all fine white paper, printed and bound very beautifully. It was unimaginable that these were things a mud-monkey-like student could use.

Sima Qiudao let go of his hand, gesturing with the short dagger in front of his face with one hand: "Sit honestly, don't talk nonsense or move around, and naturally your life will be spared!"

The boy was scared trembling like a sieve, unable to speak, only nodding repeatedly.

Zhuo Yifan whispered: "Ask about the situation in Nanbao now."

"I know." Sima Qiudao whispered. He turned his head again and asked: "Let me ask you, has there been any abnormality in the town recently?"

"Abnormality?" The boy said blankly, "Nothing... about the same as usual..."

"Have many soldiers and public servants come?"

"Public servants?" The boy hesitated for a moment, then suddenly understood, "You mean the police, right? No, haven't seen many police coming recently."

"Did the Hair Thieves, um, the Chiefs, seal any shops or arrest anyone?"

The boy shook his head: "Haven't heard of that..."

Sima Qiudao shook the short dagger in his hand and threatened: "If you lie to me, I'll take your little life immediately!"

"I dare not, I dare not," the boy shook his head repeatedly.

Sima Qiudao asked a few more sentences and roughly knew that everything was normal in Nanbao. Presumably, the Huang Family Medicine Shop was safe and sound, and Huang Zhen and the others were fine. His heart was mostly settled.

"The medicine shop is fine. I'll go into town to contact Old Huang right now. You have an injury, rest here for now. As for this child—" Sima Qiudao's eyes revealed a fierce light, raising his short dagger, prepared to silence him directly.

Zhuo Yifan whispered: "Brother Sima, you can't!"

"If we don't kill him, what if he goes to report?"

"Brother Huang, you and I are both from famous and upright sects. We came to Lingao to save the common people. How can we kill the innocent indiscriminately and disgrace our sect's style? If we do this, aren't we the same as those Hair Thieves? Besides, this is still a child!"

"But—"

"We won't release him either. Tie him up well and leave him here, so he can't tip anyone off. It won't matter if someone rescues him in a day or two after we leave."

"Alright." Sima Qiudao found it troublesome, but what Zhuo Yifan said made some sense. He said, "Then you rest here. I'll tie him up tighter before going to town."

Immediately, he used the straps of the school bag to tie the boy's hands behind his back. After tidying up a bit, he went down the mountain to Nanbao.

Seeing the boy living in constant fear, Zhuo Yifan comforted him: "Just be at ease, we won't take your life."

The boy hurriedly nodded vigorously.

Zhuo Yifan leaned against a tree and sat down slowly, holding the short dagger in his hand. Sitting there bored, he asked: "What does your family do?"

"Farming. Originally rented a few *mu* of Master Zhou's land. Now working as long-term laborers for the farm..."

"That's a good family too." Seeing his correct features and clear articulation, Zhuo Yifan felt that he was not an ordinary ignorant villager, so he had the mind to talk to him, "Since you study, why don't you find a private school to study the Four Books and Five Classics, instead of reading the Hair Thieves' evil books?"

The boy puzzled: "My family can't pay the tuition. My family is very poor and can't even eat enough. If the Chiefs hadn't said there was a meal provided, my family wouldn't have let me go to school originally..."

Just for a meal. Zhuo Yifan secretly felt short of breath. He originally just wanted to relieve boredom, but now he had the idea of wanting him to walk on the right path. He said: "Do you know that the books you read in the Hair Thieves' school are not the learning of sages, but all Australian heretical fallacies? What use is studying them? Even being illiterate would be better."

"Heretical fallacies?" Obviously, the boy didn't quite understand this term. He said timidly: "What the Chiefs' school teaches is reading characters, arithmetic, and the like."

"Calling it reading characters, but you learn the vulgar script, not the orthodox characters. If you go to take the Imperial Examination, I'm afraid you will be beaten out by the examiner immediately..." Zhuo Yifan felt a dull pain in his wound, "As for arithmetic, it is not tested in the Imperial Examination. Your family doesn't do business, so what use is learning this? Even if you can't afford to study, being an honest and dutiful farmer, even if illiterate, is still the cornerstone of the Imperial Court. Why wade into the muddy waters of the Hair Thieves just to recognize a few characters..."
