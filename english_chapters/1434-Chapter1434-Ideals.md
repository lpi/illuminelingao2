# Chapter 1434 - Ideals

Jiang Shan thought, *It's a good thing I didn't bullshit with her about the maid issue.* He was a bit weary. Indeed, he came from a privileged background and possessed strong personal qualities. In his heart, he sometimes considered himself a member of the social elite. But he didn't care for the term "upper class," and even felt some aversion to it.

As for deliberately hiding his excellence—yes. That was true, because the Council of Elders was a ruling collective. Jiang Shan was very clear about the sense of crisis held by the "soy sauce" Elders—the rank-and-file members. Although their sense of crisis seemed inexplicable to him, group consciousness was often irrational. If he showed his sharpness too openly, it would definitely not bring any benefit to his career in the new world.

"I don't like labels like 'elite,'" Jiang Shan said. "It's easy to become detached from the masses."

"You ceased to be 'the masses' long ago. You don't have the consciousness of a ruling class at all."

"The masses of the ruling class."

"That's truly ridiculous," the woman laughed. "You are clearly the most powerful rulers in this time-space, yet you insist on pretending to be hardworking and simple, constantly putting on the face of the working people. It's affected to the point of being incomprehensible. I really don't understand who you are trying to please. The common people, or yourselves? Are you rulers or the ruled?"

Jiang Shan thought to himself, *What is she trying to do? What is she hinting at with these baffling words?* All along, he had only considered Cheng Yongxin a literary youth who had read a bit of everything, had a little insight, and thought highly of herself—he had seen many such literary youths. But today she clearly had some purpose in trying to influence him.

"Alright, alright," Jiang Shan smiled slightly. "We are indeed the ruling class. As to whether we have that self-awareness, I'm afraid time will need to prove it. The transformation of identity also requires a long process."

"How is your life secretary?" She suddenly changed the subject. "I think she looks okay. Just a bit thin."

"Very good, very capable at housework. Fairly smart too. The key is that she cooks very well; she's one of those rare people whose tastes align with mine."

"You know that's not what I'm asking."

"Do you like comparing?" Jiang Shan laughed. "I think neither men nor women like comparisons."

"Just curious," Cheng Yongxin hugged her knees. "Exactly how much better am I than they are? Where am I better? I want to know what the male Elders really think."

"It's a long story."

"You work in intelligence; being concise shouldn't be a problem."

"Interests, conversation, thought."

"Just as I thought."

"The current maids are very lacking in these three aspects, aren't they?"

"Not just lacking—severely lacking."

"Then why do the single and thirsty male Elders look down on female Elders? Those single female Elders, apart from that girl in the Exploration Department, don't seem to have boyfriends. Even non-binding lover relationships are rare." She suddenly interjected: "Do you know that Xiao Zishan often spends the night at Li Xiaolü's dorm?"

"That is a personal matter. As for others, perhaps the timing isn't right."

"You're playing dumb again." She gave a charming smile. "Fine, I can't outplay you in mind games. Aside from some male Elders being useless, it's really the lesson of Liu San and Wu Yunhua."

Jiang Shan said, "A single piece of evidence proves nothing. Otherwise, Bai Guoshi would be a counterexample."

"No, Bai Guoshi is the outlier. Most male Elders are unwilling to pursue single female Elders. Look at that Elder Ge in the Chemical Industry Ministry—is her figure or appearance bad? Why does no one pursue her? Not because they don't want to or because she lacks charm—but because they fear marriage with a female Elder would hinder their pursuit of three wives and four concubines. Isn't that so? The divorce case of Wu Yunhua and Liu San—although Liu San came out unscathed and made an almost perfect exit, he still lived in fear for days and ran away for months to avoid the limelight. No one likes having such trouble. So they'd rather make do with what's simple."

"Your observation and analysis skills are quite good."

"Thank you. So I think I should do something."

Jiang Shan asked, "You want to be a matchmaker?"

"I don't have the time—the Civil Affairs folks dumped a pile of county yamen archives on me. Besides, I'm an older unmarried woman myself; being a matchmaker would have zero persuasiveness," she said. "I want to train the maids."

"Train maids?"

"Not the kind of training you're imagining. Didn't you say it yourself? Many Elders complain their life secretaries lack taste—simply put, they don't understand what the Elders are talking about. The Elders would be very happy to have someone provide a subtle 'education' to their maids, allowing them to make a qualitative leap. I want to start a magazine aimed at life secretaries. Working in the Great Library gives me a natural advantage in resources, and I am a modern woman. Of course, this needs Dingding's nod."

"Very interesting." A look of puzzlement appeared in Jiang Shan's eyes.

"Of course, I'm not a living Lei Feng. If doing this didn't benefit me at all, wouldn't that be strange?"

"Perhaps you're doing it to maintain the greater good of the Council of Elders."

"Yes, yes, that's not wrong to say," Cheng Yongxin laughed. "Look, I don't want to stay in the Great Library translating ancient texts for the rest of my life. The best prospect is to become director after Yu Eshui quits. By the way, I've had disputes with him over professional issues; he might even tell the Organization Department that I'm incompetent..."

"You could come out and work. Administrative agencies are short of people everywhere. So is the education system."

"My ideal is a bit higher than that."

"You want to be an Executive Committee member?"

"At least a People's Commissar level. Not now, of course—I'm not arrogant enough to think that, nor do I have the ability. But in ten or twenty years, it should be possible. So I hope to take this opportunity to accumulate some popularity for myself. Staying in the Great Library gives me absolutely no presence—no one knows me."

"Why tell me such a grand ideal?"

"To seek your help."

"How can I help?"

"Nothing much. You're like the Buddha; when the time comes, just loosen your hand a little and don't slap me down directly, and this little woman will be endlessly grateful." Cheng Yongxin frowned pitifully. "You know most men in the Council of Elders always have some petty prejudices against women."

"Such a low request?"

"I think it's quite high."

"Alright," Jiang Shan said. "People with ideals should be respected."

"Great." Cheng Yongxin laughed. "Do you want something to eat? I brought sandwiches."

"No, eating late at night is not a good habit," he stretched. "Wouldn't it be better to do something interesting?" Jiang Shan smiled faintly. "The spring night is short."

He heard the steady breathing of the woman sleeping beside him. The exhaustion after climax made his eyelids heavy. Yet he couldn't fall asleep for a while. Lando's report invaded his mind again. He had read it so many times during the day that the text of the report still appeared clearly in his mind. Using minor characters from Star Wars as codenames for foreign intelligence operations—he didn't know if it was Li Yan's or some other Elder's bad taste. But the reality was, even if the Army and Navy under the Council of Elders were viewed as Clone Troopers, he had no right to mobilize them to destroy this potential threat; nor did he have Jedi Knights available. He could only count on a mercenary whose background he knew to deal with another mercenary about whom he knew nothing.

The Elders attending the joint conference were also undecided: let Lando lead the Special Reconnaissance Team to assassinate Hale, or ignore it for now and send an expeditionary force to flatten Manila after the first phase of the mainland conquest is complete? Both opinions had supporters. He estimated that once the *Haiqi* delivered the intelligence photos of the Manila Dahlgren gun, the military-industrial departments would surely be thrown into quite a turmoil...

Jiang Shan woke up. The sky was faintly light. He felt a heavy gaze fixed on him.

The woman was leaning on the pillow beside him, watching his face.

"You talked a lot in your sleep," she murmured. "You're under a lot of pressure."

"Did I scream or make other strange noises?"

She sighed, looked cautiously at his forehead, stroked it with her finger, and asked:

"It's six o'clock. Do you want to sleep a little longer?"

"No," he said. "The driver will be here to pick me up in an hour."

"Maybe we shouldn't meet at night. Your sleep time is too short."

"Proper sex life makes one energetic," Jiang Shan said. "I'm getting up."

She got down on the floor, picked up her nightgown and draped it casually over her naked body, walked barefoot to the sofa, and handed him the clothes he had thrown messily on the sofa the night before.

"Thank you," Jiang Shan said.

"Serving the man she loves is a woman's pleasure."

"That pleasure is truly wonderful for a man."

The woman smiled silently: "Enjoy it."

Jiang Shan left No. 3 Lychee Grove promptly at 7:00 AM. He returned to his office, carrying a faint scent of carnations.

His secretary brought him the latest intelligence compilation and internal publications, still smelling of ink.

"Coffee, black." He lowered his head and flipped through the pages. "And get me a sandwich."

"Yes, Comrade Director."

The coffee was the special Golden South Sea supply from the General Affairs Office. As Jiang Shan liked, it was clear black coffee with no sugar or milk. He took a sip, picked up the sandwich, and while chewing, picked up the telephone on the desk.

"Connect me to the Analysis Division Director's office."

Ten seconds later the call connected. Wang Ding was already in his office.

"There's something—do you know Cheng Yongxin? You do? Good. I want a file on her. Yes, I know accessing an Elder's Organization Department file requires permission from the General Affairs Office. And don't go to Wu Mu—they won't admit to any of this. Try to ask around. Don't write anything down. Come directly to me."

"Fine, let's be prepared and see what game you're playing." Jiang Shan silently finished the coffee in his mouth.
