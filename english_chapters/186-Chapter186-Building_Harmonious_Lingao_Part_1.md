# Chapter 186: Building a Harmonious Lingao (Part 1)

After prisoner processing ended, there was disagreement about prisoner disposition.

Per standard procedure, combat prisoners were interrogated, screened, registered, then "purified" and assigned to labor-reform teams under Wu De's unified management.

This battle had captured prisoners of multiple nationalities. Normally, they'd be treated equally as forced laborers. But the Navy requested direct recruitment of the two Spaniards—transmigrators knew little about this era's large sailing ships' rigging techniques, and these Spaniards had some knowledge.

However, a nationalist faction led by Dugu Qiuhun firmly opposed such preferential treatment: these Spanish scum had come to China's coast hoping to rob and get rich. They were outright pirates. Not being hanged at Bopu was already lenient enough. Recruiting them was absolute worship of foreigners.

The Navy ultimately lost under the nationalist banner. Even Mr. Wen, who usually favored them, refused support. His reasoning was simple: "This violates regulations."

Of course, the two Spaniards did receive some consideration. They were grouped with the Indian prisoners for labor—the Indians weren't Spanish compatriots but spoke some Spanish for communication, reducing loneliness. As for the Malay pirates, nobody cared about their fate. After brief screening, they were sent directly to the quarry.

Tan Ming emerged from Bopu infirmary on trembling legs. Last night had felt like a brush with death. Though he'd jumped for cover quickly, during the retreat, enemy shells had screamed behind him, stones flying everywhere. His head had been pelted with debris—without his Type-80 steel helmet, his skull would've cracked open.

Fortunately, just scrapes... who knew if he'd survive going forward...

He touched the gauze on his head. The iodine-treated wound still throbbed. Damn, wasn't this exactly like before? No, worse than before!

Tan Ming had worked as a security guard, laborer, briefly as an oil worker, even as an online-game power-leveler when bored, operated printing machines at a cardboard factory, and finally sold office furniture. But none of those jobs risked his life. Now he had to fight under artillery fire. He seriously doubted he'd live to see the revolution succeed.

Reaching into his pocket, he fished out a cigarette pack—as militia, he received one pack monthly. This waterproof, crush-proof case protected his property well.

Due to yesterday's battle, the Executive Committee had granted all combatants one day's rest.

Squatting at the entrance, he lit up and took a few puffs to calm his nerves. He was hungry but didn't want to eat. Same old cafeteria food with no oil or meat. Except fish, shrimp, and rice, everything was scarce. Back on construction sites, he could at least eat his fill of pork ribs and chicken legs.

The more he thought, the more frustrated he got. What devil had possessed him to join this transmigration? He shuffled back to his dormitory. On his bed lay an Executive Committee notification. Opening it, he found a special supply voucher—his mood immediately improved.

Also a notice of 500 bonus points. But this virtual number meant little to Tan Ming. The supply voucher was more practical.

Special supply vouchers were for scarce goods, generally issued to transmigrators doing dangerous or heavy labor. One voucher could be exchanged at Planning Committee for cigarettes or items this spacetime couldn't yet produce: candy, cola, and such. Or traded at the cafeteria for instant noodles with vegetables and an egg.

Also included was an invitation on local paper: please attend the "Commendation Assembly" in a few days.

This was more like it. Tan Ming thought, at least they remembered us who bled and struggled. The Executive Committee cadres weren't total bastards.

After discussion, the Executive Committee decided on these rewards for Bopu battle participants:

Award "Bopu Defense" armbands and shield badges. The former for military personnel, the latter for participating non-military personnel.

The Bopu Defense armband was red felt with white characters, 30mm wide, embroidered with "Bopu" in clerical script, with "1628" below. Recipients could sew it onto the left sleeve of their uniform.

The shield badge should have been metal, but Industrial couldn't find suitable cheap material. They decided on the same felt. The design was a shield with flat top, containing a black ship silhouette under radiating dawn light, with broken masts below symbolizing victory over pirates. "Bopu 1628" at the bottom. This badge could be sewn onto any official uniform.

Other material rewards: transmigrators received one special supply voucher and 200 bonus points.

Locals received 25-kilogram salt vouchers and 4-kilogram rice tickets. Salt vouchers could be exchanged at salt shops; some salt merchants would buy them, making them circulating securities.

Finally, battle reports would be compiled, and commendations would be awarded for outstanding performance.

Wu Mingjin sat in his inner office, deeply troubled.

Three months since these bald bandits came ashore. Spring Festival was approaching. Not only weren't they leaving, their buildings kept getting bigger and more numerous. Even their market was flourishing.

At Ma'ao salt fields, they'd clashed with the Gou family. The Gous—externally connected to pirates, internally connected to local government, deeply rooted local tyrants—the county magistrate could only pretend not to see their misdeeds. He'd originally hoped for a tiger-fighting-tiger scenario. Even if they couldn't be driven off immediately, at least mutual damage. Instead, the bald bandits had crushed the Gou family like swatting a fly. Within days, Gou Manor was gone. Even Gou Er, deeply rooted in the city, had fled.

Fortunately, these foreign barbarians from Australia at least respected Ming law. Salt Field Village's salt tax, surcharges, and miscellaneous levies were all paid. This gave him some relief. But these "baldies," claiming poor roads for tax delivery, had forced a road right up to Wenshui Bridge, then built a two-story tower there. Now baldies were always watching from that tower—obviously monitoring the county seat.

That wasn't all. The baldies were aggressively recruiting under the guise of organizing militia. Reportedly several thousand men already. All equipped with muskets and cannons, drilling daily. More ships filled Bopu Bay. Wu Mingjin knew he was completely surrounded by these baldies' sphere of influence. Unless the court sent troops to drive them away, how long he could stay in this county seat depended entirely on how long they'd let him. If fighting started, Wu Mingjin had no doubt the city's shameless runners would immediately surrender.

His petitions to the prefecture had vanished without trace. His letter to Guangzhou requesting help from fellow graduates had no response. Yet East Gate Market had become the county's most prosperous bazaar. Daily, crowds streamed from the city along the main road. The county's grain poured in; illicit salt poured out.

As a proper seventh-rank magistrate, he could only watch from the city walls. The county had neither money nor soldiers—just a besieged lonely city.

Recently he'd learned the baldies had taken Baitu Village. He didn't care about Baitu—it was a settlement of escaped households from elsewhere, unregistered, not paying taxes, nothing to do with the county. But from this action, he sensed unease—the baldies' tentacles were reaching across the entire county.

Sure enough, days later, village headmen secretly reported: the baldies had summoned leaders from villages on both sides of Wenlan River to Bairren Fortress.

Wu Mingjin didn't know the phrase "encircle cities from rural areas," but he understood the meaning. He quickly dispatched county officials including Wu Ya and Fu Baiwen to the villages, warning them not to collude with baldies, swearing "when imperial troops arrive, baldies become ash; collaborators face dire consequences." This made some villages waver again.

Just as he was pondering countermeasures, someone reported: The baldies had sent an emissary!

Wu Mingjin shivered. He'd sent people this morning to investigate last night's artillery sounds and the fire at Bopu. They hadn't returned, but the baldies had come.

Normally, to avoid implication, he never personally received baldy envoys, always sending his secretary. But this matter was critical—he had to understand what the baldies were planning.

"Summon the secretary!" he ordered. "Change clothes! Open court!"

"Open court?" The runner couldn't believe his ears. Weren't guests received in the reception hall? Why open court when there were no complaints to hear?

"That's right, open court!"

Xiong Buyu arrived as envoy, leading over ten men. Wang Ruixiang led, fully armed with entrenching tool shouldered, followed by twelve selected soldiers, all over 170cm tall, bearing rifles with gleaming bayonets. Behind them, seven or eight wheelbarrows loaded with bundled packages and wooden boxes.

What kind of county seat is this? The poorest small town in my hometown's poorest county is 100 times more prosperous. The only cross-town road was at least stone-paved, with some shops along both sides. But the buildings were low and dilapidated, pathetically small. He could see the county yamen from the city gate.

This procession swaggered into town. Xiong Buyu held a large envelope containing the Executive Committee's letter to Magistrate Wu. Onlookers pointed and whispered. Several ragged children suddenly ran up, saying in accented but clearly Mandarin-based pronunciation: "Candy, candy."

Xiong Buyu was amused. Who knew the American-soldier trick of handing out chewing gum actually worked.

After tossing out some candy, the procession reached the county yamen. The hall drum at the entrance hadn't been beaten in ages, covered in thick dust. A dusty official boot sat in the hanging shoe box. The group followed runners inside. Wang Ruixiang spoke to his soldiers, leaving two men at each doorway.

Seeing himself led to the main hall, Xiong Buyu was puzzled. Then a side door opened. A forty-something man appeared—white-faced, well-maintained, wearing official robes.

The attending runners called loudly: "Magistrate Wu is in session!"

The hall drum sounded three times. Runners holding execution rods called "Oh—" in acknowledgment and filed in, forming wing formations. Everything fell silent.
