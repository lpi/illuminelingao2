# Chapter 1177 - The Envoys

And the matter was urgent—it was already July. Once summer arrived, typhoons around the Japanese archipelago increased, and long sea voyages were generally suspended.

Sō Yoshinari dispatched a small envoy mission—secretly, of course. The shogunate was very wary of all kinds of Southern Barbarians. If word got out that the domain had privately contacted these new arrivals, there would be no end of trouble.

A Japanese sailing vessel slowly tacked toward Jeju Island. Though called a Japanese ship, it was actually a Chinese-built Guangdong vessel. Japan's shipbuilding industry was quite underdeveloped at the time; merchants making long voyages generally bought ships from China or Southeast Asia.

Because they were buying ships abroad, vessel sizes were generally small. This ship had a cargo capacity of only 70 tons and a full displacement of just over 100 tons—a very small vessel, equivalent only to the Senate Navy's Grade-3 auxiliary craft, the smallest classification of auxiliary vessels.

Tsushima's sailors were quite familiar with the waters around Jeju Island. After the failed Korean invasion, when Sō Yoshitoshi withdrew from Busan, he had taken a detour via Jeju Island to avoid the Korean Navy's pursuit on his way home.

The ship was intercepted by patrol boats more than ten nautical miles from Jeju Island. At the Colonization and Trade Ministry's request, the Second Fleet had established a blockade line in the Tsushima Strait, strictly prohibiting all vessel traffic between Korea and Japan.

The envoys from the Lord of Tsushima were Nagafune Genshichirō, a retainer of Sō Yoshinari, and Takeya Sōshō, a Nagasaki merchant. The Nagafune family had originally been retainers of the Ukita clan. After Ukita Hideie's defeat at Sekigahara and exile, his retainers became ronin and scattered in all directions. The young Genshichirō had no particular skills; after drifting about, he eventually found a place under the Lord of Tsushima and had been used as expendable diplomatic fodder ever since. Fortunately, Japan was now at peace, and diplomatic struggles between daimyō involved only matters of interest—there was no risk of losing one's life as an envoy. It was just tiring legwork. For this low-ranking samurai with a stipend of only fifty koku, it was already a decent assignment—at least he didn't have to pay for meals while on official duty.

Takeya was a distant relative and commercial agent of the Sō clan—merchants in this era often doubled as diplomats. Takeya Sōshō had dealt with Chinese merchants in Nagasaki and could speak Chinese. According to the returned merchants, this group calling themselves "Australians" spoke Chinese—albeit with a strange accent. And he had heard many secondhand accounts about the Australians. As a secondhand "Australia expert," he had been invited to help.

This mission was also something Takeya wanted. Regardless of anything else, Australian goods were quite popular in Nagasaki. Currently, only small quantities of Australian goods reached Japan, mainly luxury items at very high prices. And they were almost entirely controlled by Chinese merchants.

With limited supply and high demand, there was naturally no room for Takeya to get into the business—Takeya was only a mid-level merchant in Nagasaki, without much standing in the city's commercial circles. He had no connections in the shogunate, so he couldn't get a vermillion seal certificate to trade in Guangzhou. Fortunately, he still had a ship and often used his Sō clan connections to privately run goods to Korea. Fortune favors the bold—he had volunteered for this mission, contributing his ship and personally organizing tribute gifts at his own expense to undertake the Jeju peace mission. Of course, the primary envoy was still Nagafune Genshichirō.

Hearing that the visitors sought to meet with the "Australians" on Jeju Island, the patrol boat dispatched armed personnel to board the small sailing vessel and take control of key positions. The envoys' ship was then escorted by the patrol boat toward Chocheon Harbor.

When Takeya had been summoned by Sō Yoshinari, he had given a vivid account of all the Australian exploits he'd heard about: crushing the Ming army at Qiongzhou, iron ships bombarding the White Goose Pool, various "Australian goods," plus the embellished complaints from returned merchants about how the "four-pointed star flag ships" that had hijacked them were impossibly fast, bristling with guns and cannons—though in reality these were just auxiliary craft and patrol boats. All of this had left an impression in the Tsushima domain that the Australians were no less formidable than the Southern Barbarians.

These almost mythical accounts naturally had many skeptics who thought them wildly exaggerated. But as the envoys' ship approached Chocheon Harbor, the row of H800s anchored in the port—light black hulls gently rocking in the waves—quite impressed the mission.

Chinese merchant ships going to Japan included some large vessels with cargo capacities exceeding 500 tons and full displacements approaching 1,000 tons, but compared to the H800 with its 1,400-ton full displacement, towering masts, and elegant lines, they still seemed small. The H800s were comparable to the great Portuguese or Dutch Southern Barbarian ships.

Takeya had been a merchant in Nagasaki for years and was one of the most worldly men in Japan, having seen all manner of Chinese oceangoing vessels and Southern Barbarian ships.

In terms of tonnage and size, the H800 wasn't larger than other ships. But an entire row of such vessels anchored together created a visual impact far greater than one or two isolated large ships: ships coming to Nagasaki harbor, whether Chinese merchant vessels or Southern Barbarian ships, only came one or two at a time.

Around these large ships, many smaller vessels were also anchored. Even these were much larger than their own ship—larger, in fact, than most ships they had ever seen.

This massive concentration of vessels wasn't for showing off military might, but rather the Second Fleet and transport flotilla assembling at Jeju to await the last departure before summer. With the arrival of summer and typhoon season, maritime shipping would pause. According to Naval Command orders, all steam warships would return to Lingao for maintenance, H800s would return to Hong Kong for maintenance, and other sailing ships would undergo maintenance and repairs at Jeju, Kaohsiung, or Hong Kong as appropriate.

The Navy's large-scale "summer break" wasn't just about avoiding typhoons—it was also about resting the crews.

After more than half a year of intensive shipping and escort duties, both the Navy's vessels and personnel were showing fatigue. Steam-powered ships, whose performance was already unstable, had experienced multiple accidents and urgently needed factory maintenance. Personnel fatigue had also reached its peak—due to a shortage of reserve personnel, sailors were all working excessive hours.

The envoy mission on deck fell silent. Such a force of "pirates" or "Southern Barbarians" was clearly nothing to trifle with—the sheer audacity of directly seizing Jeju Island was not something ordinary Southern Barbarian merchants or pirates could pull off.

Ping Qiusheng didn't know that among the envoys was a secondhand "Australia expert." But regardless of who they were, the first day or two would naturally involve cooling their heels. He arranged for them to stay at the Chocheon Harbor guesthouse. Their rooms were, as usual, stocked with Australian propaganda picture albums: half were works by Leibtrani and his students—buildings and scenery of Lingao, the imposing Fubo Army, ships in Nogami Hayao's nautical style, epic battle scenes—mostly PS-edited versions of Warhammer 40K images from a certain Elder's private collection. There were also some things from the old timeline... In short, stun them first, then talk.

On the third morning, Ping Qiusheng received the Tsushima envoys at the Chocheon Harbor trading post.

"I am Nagafune Genshichirō-hyōe, envoy of Tsushima Province. By order of my lord, I command you..."

Ping Qiusheng's face remained expressionless as his mind raced through the material on the Tsushima Sō clan he had reviewed the night before...

Tsushima Province wasn't large, but its retainer band was. After their former masters, the Shōni clan, declined, their retainers had fled en masse to Tsushima. When Konishi Yukinaga, father-in-law of the previous clan head, lost his head after Sekigahara, another wave of masterless retainers arrived. Then there were the scattered drifters who washed up on their own... like the Nagafune Genshichirō family.

With so many retainers, there were too many mouths feeding from the treasury—but that wasn't the main problem. Because they came from diverse backgrounds, and there was more competition than resources, multiple factions inevitably formed, vying for power.

Since Sō Yoshinari was dissatisfied with the power of senior councilors like Yanagawa and Susa, he intentionally promoted outsider retainers without deep local roots. Genshichirō had thus secured a stipend of fifty koku per year, living in the nagaya row houses of the castle town. He still had to perform service, and life was bitter—hardly better than a foot soldier. By shogunate law, samurai couldn't take side jobs, and he had no land, so his wife had to supplement their income by looking after children for merchant families. For this mission as primary envoy, his entire outfit was borrowed from his lord.

But the Nagafune family had after all served high personages, so their bearing remained absolutely haughty. Genshichirō's two elder brothers had both died dramatically cutting their bellies during negotiations. He too had become a retainer by being willing to risk his life and bluff boldly.

"What is your offense!" Ping Qiusheng listened to his long-winded speech, then let his face harden. In his heart he thought: "Your uncle! I can out-bluster you any day."

"I am the Market Shipping Commissioner of Jeju, under the Maritime Control Commissioner of the Taifusi. I am dispatched by the Superior Nation. Your lord is merely a Fourth Rank Lower Grade Chamberlain, yet he dares send men here to be insolent! Is your lord ordering you to start a war? Then I shall order the Navy to immediately impound your vessels. Tomorrow the fleet will bombard the Waegwan! Flatten Tsushima! Blockade Nagasaki!"

"Please, Your Excellencies, calm yourselves and hear this humble one out." Takeya Sōshō nearly leapt up in alarm. If those "Australian black ships" really sailed to Nagasaki, Edo would be in uproar, and everyone involved would be lucky just to have to commit seppuku.

"We have not come to demand accountability," Takeya said delicately. "Our domain's trade with Korea has a long history and has never given offense to Australia. We do not understand why you occupy Jeju Island and intercept our ships..."

"This Jeju Island is rightfully territory of our Great Song. When the false Yuan fell to the false Ming, it was stolen by the Goryeo barbarians. Today our Australian Song has recovered its former territory. Have you anything to say!?"

"Ancient matters are not Japan's affair. Rights and wrongs of history are not for us to comment on. It is only that these ships belong to our domain..."

"Your Tsushima Province is both a vassal of the Eastern Sea and a vassal of Goryeo. Our Empire currently has no intention of conquering Japan. Does your lord wish to be a Goryeo man or a Japanese? Make your choice!"

"Tsushima is a Japanese domain. Our external attachment to Korea is merely expedience. My lord has no desire for war with your forces. Moreover, since Lord Ieyasu's time, all the Shoguns have made peace under heaven their mission, restraining the daimyō from provoking foreign troubles." Takeya knew their opponent was powerful; bluster would be meaningless. Only by demonstrating their full "love of peace" could they proceed.
