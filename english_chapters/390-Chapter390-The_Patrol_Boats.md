# Chapter 390 - The Patrol Boats

"Eating crayfish instead of sea lobsters?" Wu Nanhai expressed disdain. "If you really like them, Australia has freshwater crayfish too. Go eat them there later. But I still prefer real sea lobsters."

The discussion turned to mariculture. Lingao had extensive tidal flats, especially at Bo-pu, Ma-miu, and Hongpai ports—all with large tidal zones, the main areas for modern Lingao's coastal farming. These three regions were now under direct or indirect transmigrator collective control, providing a foundation for mariculture development.

"We know nothing about mariculture. No one studied it, no one's done it." Wu Nanhai said. "We'd have to find books and self-study first. Besides, at this time-space's fishing productivity level, expanding the fishing fleet is far more meaningful than mariculture."

"Let fishermen handle it. Early mariculture was developed by fishermen themselves. Oyster and kelp farming mainly involves seedling cultivation and artificial environment creation—very limited feed investment with considerable output."

No concrete results emerged on mariculture since it counted as fisheries, involving Naval Command coordination. After much thought, Wu Nanhai decided it was better for Naval Command to collect more "fishing tax." If possible, organize a fishing cooperative for collective offshore operations.

But just then, the Qiongzhou Strait situation was becoming turbulent. Naval People's Commissar Chen Haiyang was in *Fengcheng*'s captain's cabin studying charts on the table. This giant vessel had been anchored here for nearly a year—from the start a symbol of transmigrator collective power. Even when they'd huddled in Bo-pu's earthworks, *Fengcheng* intimidated everyone around.

For over half a year, besides attacks by Zhu Cailao and Liu Xiang, no one had dared challenge their presence in the Qiongzhou Strait. Small pirate bands that once frequented Lingao waters had long been eliminated.

But now, *Fengcheng*'s naval personnel were feeling pressure.

Small pirate groups were increasingly appearing in the Qiongzhou Strait—robbing any ships, frequently landing to harass and plunder villages.

Not that such things hadn't happened before, but never this frequently. Salt Village now had 1-2 invasion alerts weekly, with 20-50 people landing each time. The village was constantly running ragged; the militia had to maintain full-time alert, seriously affecting production. To protect salt workers, the Army had sent a platoon to garrison Salt Village. Salt transport ships to Bo-pu were also threatened. Naval Command had lost a salt transport in early June—thousands of *jin* of sea salt lost, plus five or six casualties. By June, attacks had grown more frequent. Naval Command began stationing marines on every salt ship and adopting convoy systems. Ma-miu to Bo-pu transports used ten-ship formations with armed sailing escort. Finally they suppressed pirates' salt-ship robbery attempts.

Escort battles weren't intense—often escorts' gunfire made attackers flee. But when attackers had four or five ships, they might press determined attacks, especially against salt convoys. For safety, escort ships upgraded to cannon armament—without canister shot, these starving, desperate red-eyed pirates couldn't be repelled.

Chen Haiyang quickly realized Naval Command lacked sufficient forces for maintaining sea dominance around Lingao. Naval Command possessed considerable ship numbers, but these were a hodgepodge of Guangdong coast vessels. Generally small—15 to 100 tons displacement—with varying conditions, good and bad. Most handled transport duties without cannon installations. Those qualifying as warships: only four constituting naval core forces: the 8154 fishing trawlers, the self-modified lateen fishing boat *Dengyingzhou*, the first self-built fast sailing ship *Zhenhai*, and the two-masted captured-pirate-then-refitted *Fubo*. The latter three had all been fitted with diesel engines.

Chen Haiyang had concentrated main forces for several patrol sweeps and multiple entrapment operations, sinking and capturing over twenty various vessels, killing or capturing hundreds. Prisoner interrogations revealed: most came from various Fujian coast sea gangs, unable to withstand combined Imperial-Zheng Zhilong suppression, scattering to Guangdong waters. Since the Pearl River estuary was also a suppression priority and Portuguese feared shipping lane disruptions—deploying large warships for Pearl River patrols—many small pirate bands couldn't establish footholds and continued westward toward lower-pressure waters.

From prisoners, the Executive Committee learned the latest maritime developments: confirmed that after Zheng Zhilong's surrender, Xu Xinsu and Yang Liu had been killed by late 1628. As for Chen Shengyu, Zhou San, and other medium-small pirates—mostly eliminated or absorbed by him. Li Kuiqi's battles with Zheng Zhilong continued. The transmigrator collective's most-watched Zhu Cailao had gone to Fujian fishing in troubled waters, repeatedly attacking Tong'an, apparently hoping to profit from Fujian coast chaos. According to pirates, Zhu Cailao had been absorbing scattered forces from various factions, substantially expanding his strength, seizing opportunities to plunder foreign ships in Fujian waters—quite profitably.

Chen Haiyang thought this was probably chain-reaction effects. Zheng Zhilong battling various maritime groups in Fujian waters would inevitably drive increasing numbers of scattered vessels to flee to the Qiongzhou Strait as he progressively eliminated and absorbed these groups.

Actually a good opportunity—a chance to absorb these people and ships. Chen Haiyang was already calculating. He wasn't impressed by their ships, but these experienced sailors would make excellent naval personnel. Training land-recruited farmers into sailors couldn't compare to these native seafarers.

As for whether these pirates could become qualified naval fighters, Chen Haiyang wasn't concerned. That was Political Department Officer Wei Aiwen's job. This brand-new organization had been proposed by Ma Qianzhu, under General Staff jurisdiction, specifically handling military political work. Wei Aiwen had been nominated for this new position based on his excellent political propaganda work at the Instructional Battalion. He simultaneously served as commander of the General Staff's direct recruit training camp. After enlistment, recruits first received 90 days of basic training and political education there.

But to achieve this goal, he needed to strengthen Lingao waters patrol forces. *Zhenhai* and *Fubo* originally handled long-range armed transport runs to Changhua and Yulin. Diverting them to security patrols caused no short-term problems, but prolonged diversion would affect island-circuit shipping—especially coconut and timber supplies.

"What we need now isn't a fleet, but sufficient patrol vessels for Lingao coastal security duties."

"Select some better-condition ships from our miscellaneous vessels, add cannons for patrol use." This was essentially the current armed sailing ship format. "Add diesel engines for increased mobility."

"No—those ships are too small. Installing diesel engines would be wasteful—I don't even want to spare cannons." Chen Haiyang quickly rejected this suggestion. Shipyard equipment upgrades, increasingly skilled workers, and the machinery shop providing ever more equipment had greatly inflated his ambitions.

"I want a small but professional standing patrol flotilla." He stated his requirements clearly at the Executive Committee meeting. "The current hodgepodge navy in the Qiongzhou Strait only has deterrent power, not enforcement capability."

Because these miscellaneous ships had no performance advantages, and experienced helmsmen were fewer than opponents had. They relied solely on firearm superiority to offset opponents. But these ships weren't designed for cannon installation—mounting multiple cannons was difficult and extremely inconvenient.

Finally the Executive Committee approved an emergency shipbuilding project, ordering Bo-pu Shipyard to concentrate all resources and immediately build five lateen patrol vessels. This ship type imitated the concept of anti-piracy cutters built by the British Royal Navy from the 17th to 19th centuries. Using single-masted lateen sails with shallow draft hull design, convenient for combat in rugged coastal terrain and shallow waters. For rapid maneuvering in calm or unfavorable wind conditions, multiple pairs of oars were also installed.

British anti-piracy cutters could reach 113 tons displacement, but Wen Desi's design had half that standard displacement—borrowing the concept rather than replicating. After all, these ships would only serve in the Qiongzhou Strait, at most around Hainan Island coasts. Oceangoing performance needed little consideration.

The new patrol boat's displacement was reduced to 60 tons to accelerate construction. The single-masted lateen design was retained for its suitability to coastal regions' variable winds. The sail rigging system was entirely copied from North American branch's yacht—except hand-crank windlasses replaced electric motors. The ship also had 3 pairs of long oars for additional propulsion and accelerated turning.

The ship used midship island layout. Fore and aft decks each mounted one 12-pound M1857 smoothbore naval cannon in open casemate installation identical to *Zhenhai*. According to Wen Desi's calculations, even with not-fully-trained gunners, each gun could fire once per minute. Ammunition configuration, based on several battle experiences, emphasized incendiary, explosive, and canister rounds, plus chain shot for targeting masts.

Since pirates facing patrol boats preferred boarding as primary combat method, and small ships had crew disadvantages, the ships also mounted a devastating close-combat weapon: multi-barrel guns.

Multi-barrel guns weren't machine guns. Though capable of brief continuous fire, they had no automatic mechanisms. Essentially they integrated many rifles firing sequentially for continuous-fire effect. This strange weapon had once been popular in Europe.

Li Yunxing's design basically replicated the original structure: 16 barrels. To reduce manufacturing costs, barrels were made from seamless steel tubes pulled by the rolling mill, then rifled. They fired Minié paper cartridges with percussion cap ignition. Caliber was 14mm—inherited from the seamless boiler tubes brought from modern times serving as Minié rifle barrels. Maximum range 400 meters; effective range 100 meters.

The major drawback of multi-barrel guns was difficult reloading—almost impossible during combat. So they developed an integral ammunition system. The gun body split into barrel unit and cartridge drum, with interchangeable drums. This allowed rapid reloading—similar to replacing revolver cylinders when reloading.

The result was extremely heavy—anyone hoping to use this as infantry "machine gun" saw its massive bulk and realized army deployment was impractical. Historically, such multi-barrel guns required two-wheeled gun carriages for land mobility, weighing nearly as much as light artillery but with inferior range and power. So they were quickly phased out of field forces.

Naval vessels were relatively insensitive to weight. Multi-barrel guns on ship decks used universal-joint mounts allowing convenient all-direction fire. Mounts had sliding rails, using travel to absorb some recoil. They also mounted improved firing mechanisms: a typewriter-keyboard-like hammer-striking device let shooters control firing rate. After Li Yunxing operated it several times, he could actually achieve burst fire. This weapon earned the nickname "typewriter." Each multi-barrel gun crew carried 12 drums standard. For shooter protection, multi-barrel guns had iron gun shields installed.

Besides this fearsome close-combat weapon, patrol boats used an ancient but effective method against boarding: protective nets along both gunwales. The handheld shotgun cannons that had proven effective in bandit suppression were also standard equipment for deck melee combat.

Ships temporarily lacked engines, but with future upgrade needs considered, construction left installation space and structural provisions. Planned engines would use single or twin-cylinder diesels—quick-starting, suitable for patrol boat needs.

Some questioned these ships' effectiveness given their small size—only 30 total crew. But Chen Haiyang believed they were fully adequate for escort and patrol security duties in the Qiongzhou Strait—no one should expect fleet engagements from them.

In early June 1629, Bo-pu Naval Shipyard laid five iron keels on slipways, simultaneously beginning construction. The patrol boats pioneered iron-framed wooden-hulled construction. Keels and ribs all used rolled iron. The steel plant produced keels and ribs in batches according to blueprints. The entire construction schedule was reduced by over two-thirds compared to wooden keels and ribs.

Patrol boat construction introduced many modern design concepts. Hull forms were completed on computer by Wen Desi and several ship-model enthusiasts using virtual shipbuilding software and extensive fluid dynamics databases. The Industrial Committee attempted standardized construction. Various wooden planking was unified in dimensions and shapes, batch-produced in workshops using woodworking machinery. Wen Desi even preliminarly attempted modular construction—some large components were built on ground then hoisted aboard for installation. Lateen sails were custom-ordered in Macao through Jesuit connections. The Jesuits wrote that the sailmakers they needed were en route from Europe to Macao; if all went well—no storms, disease, or pirates—they'd arrive in a year and a half.

Naval Command built ships and prepared for battle. Chen Haiyang intensively conducted training through operations, sending naval cadets, petty officers, and recruits onto armed sailing ships. Short-term voyages didn't require worrying about provisions—cramming extra people aboard was fine. *Zhenhai* and *Fubo* maintained combat readiness, daily patrolling the Lingao-Xuwen strait zone. Suddenly Lingao's coast was thick with masts—quite an impressive martial display.

Soon the first five patrol boats launched. Total construction time was under 20 days. Wen Desi ordered concentrating resources to first outfit one as verification vessel, deploying to combat as soon as possible to discover problems for further improvement.

Yue Lin now sat on this brand-new patrol boat's bridge. Under the awning was a rattan high-backed captain's chair fixed to the deck—and it rotated. This was a gift Wu Kuangming had carefully designed for Naval Command, also part of shipbuilding standardization measures. This chair, extremely comfortable in Lingao's climate, quickly became a symbol of naval authority. "Sitting the rattan chair" later became transmigrator-nation navy slang—meaning becoming captain.

His command flag flew from the mast. The newly-completed Patrol Boat 101 was this patrol formation's flagship. Beautiful lateen sails were full. On deck duty were marines newly issued naval-model Minié rifles—the naval model featured shorter barrels suited for deck use. Fore and aft open casemates identical to *Zhenhai*'s protruded black cannon muzzles.

Behind the bridge was an experimental weapon—Li Yunxing's "machine gun." Several "typewriters" had been manufactured and were being tested aboard. Patrol Boat 101 was honored as the first to mount this weapon.

"Finally looks like a warship." Yue Lin said with satisfaction. His gaze shifted from the cannons to the ships flanking him. Though somewhat worn fishing boats with patched hardtop sails, this three-ship formation spread across the sea still conveyed naval squadron bearing. In his imagination he saw himself in white gold-trimmed Grand Admiral uniform, chest covered with Korean-style medals, standing on a battleship bridge. Beside him on the sea, battleships spread in wedge formation, riding wind and waves under morning sun...
