# Chapter 325 - Occupying Thirteen Villages

Dang Namen thought quickly. The other two mountain paths were narrow and difficult to traverse, and the enemy had already seized the initiative to occupy favorable terrain. Their firearms were fierce; just a dozen men could block a large group. Only the terrain at Datai Slope was the widest and flattest. If everyone swarmed over, seeking life in death, maybe a few could escape.

Hearing his reasoning, the crowd hurriedly threw away the burdensome valuables on their bodies and swarmed towards Datai Slope.

"Detonate the first group!" Pan Da hurriedly ordered upon seeing the dark mass of bandits rushing over, having already entered the mine's kill zone.

Only eleven of the fifteen directional mines were detonated, and the timing of the detonations was inconsistent. But the violent explosions and the sky-filled flying stones smashed the rushing bandits bloody. Many died on the spot; more were smashed to near death, groaning on the ground.

The chain of explosions and shrill screams destroyed human will. The bandits retreated, bleeding and crying all the way, spinning around like headless flies. Yang Zeng led the expert marksmen in his platoon, performing precise shooting on the randomly running bandits at a distance of two hundred meters with a rare calmness. The unique skill of "one shot, one man down" stunned the Education Soldiers, who surged over to watch, disrupting the formation.

"Form up! Form up!" The sergeants yelled desperately, using scabbarded bayonets to whip and drive the chaotic recruits, forcing them to reform their ranks.

Pan Da coughed repeatedly, irritated by the smoke of gunpowder and dust—it seemed there was no need to use those grenade dischargers with questionable effects. However, the appearance of the Education Soldiers made him shake his head violently: *Fortunately, the enemy is few in number and their fighting will is not firm. Otherwise, they really couldn't be relied upon.*

Some of the bandits repelled from various places retreated near the stronghold, attempting to defend it. But a great fire had already ignited here, making it impossible to hold.

No road to heaven, no door to earth; the sound of gunfire and killing on all four sides was deafening. The bandits were like stray dogs. Dang Namen barely gathered more than a hundred people in front of the stronghold, preparing to rush out from Datai Slope again—staying here meant only a dead end.

However, before they could set off, they were intercepted mid-way by the 1st Platoon that had arrived to occupy the stronghold gate. First, they ate a canister shot from a 12-pounder howitzer, followed by three consecutive volleys. The painfully gathered team was immediately beaten into pieces, fleeing in all directions.

Under the desperate cover of Zhao Haiqing and a few trusted aides, Dang Namen managed to run to a secluded place at the bottom of the slope behind the stronghold. Only four or five trusted aides remained by his side. Zhao Haiqing had been shot in the back and was carried here, constantly foaming blood from his mouth. Seeing as he wouldn't make it.

"Boss Dang... run quickly, report to the brothers—" Before Zhao Haiqing could finish, he foamed blood from his mouth, his head tilted to one side, and he died.

The unique sound of Australian bird guns got closer and closer. Sounds of killing, screams, and groans came from everywhere; this was the Australian army killing his brothers. Behind him, the fire in the stronghold had turned into a soaring blaze... The situation he had painstakingly built up over ten years was destroyed in one morning. Right now, he was at his wit's end. Although there were still some brothers in "Thirteen Villages," if he couldn't escape with his life, it was useless! He thought the only plan for now was to hide until dark and then run. Having made up his mind, he immediately instructed his subordinates: "You go find your own way to live!" Saying so, he abandoned his trusted aides and went towards the deep forest and dense grass alone.

The 1st Platoon that broke into the stronghold quickly controlled nearby key points. After confirming that enemies inside and outside the stronghold had been cleared, they began organizing Education Soldiers to fight the fire. The fire in the stronghold had become difficult to control at this time. The 1st Platoon Leader had to command the Education Soldiers to push down all nearby houses to create a firebreak. Only then was the fire gradually brought under control.

At noon, as the Hall of Gathering Righteousness turned into a pile of charred wood and ashes, the flames were basically extinguished, and the entire battle entered the mopping-up stage. He Ming led the command post into the stronghold. The stronghold was a mess, with scattered valuables left behind by fleeing bandits everywhere. The granary, which hadn't been completely burned, was full of grain, enough to eat for two or three months. Various charred air-dried and cured beef, pork, chicken, and duck hung from the eaves.

In a row of houses behind the stronghold, thirty or forty women and a dozen old and young men were still locked up. When the bandits ran, they didn't unlock the doors for them, and they were almost burned to death.

These people all claimed to be kidnapped by bandits. Seeing the Transmigration Army arrive, they were all trembling with fear, kneeling on the ground begging for mercy.

"These bandits have harmed so many common people." As He Ming spoke, he ordered staff officers to seal the warehouses and organize people to clean up the spoils scattered on the ground.

"What about these people? Let them go. They are all unexpected poor people..."

"How do you know there aren't bandits or their families among them?" Luo Duo shook his head. "Besides, releasing them in these big mountains, what if they encounter bad people or wild beasts? Isn't that harming them?"

So it was decided to send these people back to Bairen along with the bandits for screening before processing.

Led by veterans, the Education Soldiers conducted a comb-style mopping up of the entire area surrounding the stronghold. The long spears they brought played an unexpected role at this time. Occasionally, a scream would be heard from the grass following the random stabbing of spears, followed by dragging out a bloody fellow. If stabbed in the thigh or similar places, they might still be saved; if stabbed in the stomach or similar, encountering a kind-hearted soldier would earn them a bayonet thrust; otherwise, they could only wait slowly for death. Seeing such a terrible end, many bandits hiding in the grass attempting to slip away at night came out to surrender one after another. By evening, fifty or sixty prisoners had been caught, and a similar number killed. Only three careless Education Soldiers were stabbed to death by bandits suddenly jumping out. But Dang Namen hadn't been found—he wasn't among the corpses.

He Ming saw the Education Soldiers cutting off heads, tying the hair of the heads together and hanging them on their waists or spears—some people's spears already had seven or eight heads hanging on them.

"What is this for?" He Ming frowned. He was extremely repulsed by this medieval practice of beheading. "We don't award prizes based on head count. Bury the corpses and heads!"

In the end, only leader-level heads were cut off and taken away. Although the transmigrators didn't like this method, they had to do so to announce the battle results to the people of the whole county.

At dusk, the battlefield cleanup ended. He Ming withdrew a portion of the troops from various roads, giving the fish that slipped through the net a glimmer of hope to escape. But Special Reconnaissance Team soldiers were already ambushed on the roads. Wearing night vision goggles, they conducted a night hunt on bandits attempting to sneak across the blockade line using darkness. In the continuous mountain forests where one couldn't see one's hand in front of one's face, a gunshot rang out from time to time. The dying cries of some hit people echoed in the valley all night. In a hunt in the early morning, Dang Namen was shot dead in a gully. In the morning, soldiers drove prisoners to identify the corpse. His head, with half the skull already blown off by a 7.62mm NATO round, was carefully cut off and put into a wooden box filled with lime.

The next day, the raid on Daolu Village commanded by Xue Ziliang was launched simultaneously. Led by Special Reconnaissance members, an infantry company rushed to Daolu Village by starlight and blockaded the whole village. Subsequently, Xue Ziliang led a squad straight for the Dang Family Ancestral Hall.

This ancestral hall was newly built after Dang Namen made his fortune. Actually, the Dang family had only moved here and settled for two generations; it was too early to build an ancestral hall. Moreover, his family had been ordinary farmers for generations, with no plaques of official titles to hang. So this ancestral hall appeared empty. However, the house was made entirely of brick and tile, with three courtyards front to back. Let alone in tiny Daolu Village, it was grand enough even by the standards of the whole county.

After the squad controlled the front and rear exits.

"Little Ye, take people to suppress the roof!" Xue Ziliang ordered. "Suppressing the roof" meant getting on the roof—this was scout slang, controlling the commanding heights of the building to suppress enemy fire and movement. It was a commonly used method in street fighting in old-style Chinese villages and towns dominated by single-story houses. Xue Ziliang personally led a team to rush directly in through the main gate. An old gatekeeper saw the door smashed open and hurriedly ran out from the gatehouse, scolding:

"This is Master Dang's Ancestral Hall—" Seeing a group of strong men dressed in colorful clothes holding various iron sticks, the gatekeeper was scared back a few steps, fell sitting on the ground, unable to say a word, shivering all over.

Seeing he was an old man, Xue Ziliang didn't make things difficult for him and rushed straight inside—according to intelligence, the bandits were all gathered in the second courtyard.

Suddenly, the old man shouted from behind in a shrill, unhuman voice: "Someone rushed in—"

The indigenous team members following behind weren't as respectful to the elderly as Xue Ziliang. A Kukri (dog-leg machete) came down on his head, instantly slicing off half his skull.

At the gate, two bandit guards stood. Seeing the situation was wrong, one ran straight inside, while the other held his saber horizontally and shouted: "Who goes there? Daring to break ground on Tai Sui's head—"

Before the bandit's roar ended, Xue Ziliang bounded in with a stride, waved his military saber, and finished him off on the spot.

"Bad news! Someone's crashing the place!" The bandit who ran in shouted while rolling and crawling.

The house instantly exploded like a pot. Many disheveled people ran out of the rooms carrying swords and guns. The Special Ops members already suppressing the roof fired a fierce burst into the courtyard with handheld shotgun cannons (grenade dischargers). Instantly, the courtyard was filled with cries for fathers and mothers, a scene of screams.

However, the disadvantage of this thing was also obvious. The entire courtyard was obscured by gunpowder smoke so thick nothing could be seen. Xue Ziliang cursed secretly: *What rotten junk!* He had to guard both sides of the inner gate, shouting:

"Don't move! Surrender and don't kill!"

This was shouted in Lingao dialect learned in a crash course. Then, people around him shouted it again in Cantonese and Hokkien. Under the training of a group of former PLA soldiers, the Army inevitably caught many habits, such as this pre-battle crash course in shouting slogans.

A fire铳 shot returned the shout, iron sand hitting the wall with *pupu* sounds. Xue Ziliang and the team members hurriedly shrank back behind the wall. Rifle fire began to ring out from the roof. Suddenly, a person darted out from the courtyard gate fast as lightning. The team members had no time to react; they only saw a figure rising and falling a few times, already running more than ten feet away. Xue Ziliang swung the Remington in his hand, and the muzzle instantly sprayed a huge flame. The person screamed and fell heavily to the ground.

"This kid probably knows *Qinggong* (light skill)," a young transmigrator soldier said beside him. "Moves pretty fast."

"Even the best *Qinggong* eats bullets all the same." Xue Ziliang smiled contemptuously. "Prepare to clear the field!"

"Captain Xue! Why did you steal my target just now?" Ye Mengyan poked his head out from the roof. "I had him lined up three-point-one-line!"

"Head cutting belongs to you."

"I don't want it." Ye Mengyan waved the SKS in his hand. "This thing is too long; using this as a commando is simply suffering!"

After another round of shooting, there was no more sound in the courtyard. Special Reconnaissance members went in to search room by room, throwing everyone, alive or dead, into the courtyard. At this time, one or two gunshots and screams also rang out at the front and rear gates of the ancestral hall. Probably fish slipping through the net tried to run out and were caught red-handed.

Nearly thirty people living in the ancestral hall, except those killed, all knelt in the courtyard with hands raised above their heads if they could walk. Every one of them was scared into staring wide-eyed, dumb as wooden tablets. In the middle, a bandit, because he wanted to pull a small dagger from his leggings while the Special Reconnaissance members weren't paying attention, had four fingers and half a palm sliced off by a soldier's curved knife. He was rolling on the ground, his wails piercing the heart and splitting the lungs, scaring the prisoners out of their wits.

After prisoner identification, that figure as light as a swallow and fast as a ghost was Wang Wushu. At this moment, he was thrown in the middle of the courtyard, his body riddled like a sieve. A soldier waved his knife and chopped his head off.

"Hang it at the gate of the ancestral hall." Xue Ziliang felt a bit nauseous, although he had seen quite a few similar cruel scenes.

After counting the prisoners, they found the last of the Four Heavenly Kings, Xin Nari, was missing.

"Where is Xin Nari?"

"He's not among the prisoners, nor among the corpses," a team member reported.

"He could actually run away from our hands?" Xue Ziliang found it hard to believe. "Search. Find him even if you have to turn the place upside down."

The result was that even turning the whole village upside down, they didn't find this person. Only after repeated questioning did they learn from the prisoners that Xin Nari had left here yesterday to go to a lover's house.

"It doesn't matter if one runs away. Let the county issue a wanted notice." Xiong Buyou, who was specially responsible for coordination, expressed indifference. He brought important news: "Magistrate Wu wants us to send the heads of the bandit leaders to the county as soon as possible, preparing to display them to the public."

When Wu Mingjin knew the Bald Thieves were going to suppress bandits on a large scale, he knew his chance to refresh his performance review had come again. He gradually ceased to dislike the Bald People now, especially last time when the Bald People handed him a large batch of pirate heads. After submitting the report, it naturally became his "personally leading village braves, exerting force to attack." This victory report actually received quite good reviews from the Prefect—reporting bandit suppression victories wasn't rare, but having many genuine pirate heads and seized material evidence was rare. Even the Lord Prefect had face.
