# Chapter 1623 - The Role of the Indigenous Protection Association

"No, he is innocent. At least I think he is innocent now," Ji Xin said. "This matter was widely rumored among the natives at the time. You know I am the President of the Indigenous Protection Association, and several of the Zhang family's relatives came to complain to me back then—so I also launched some investigations."

Ma Jia listened silently to what he said.

"I consider myself to have some investigative skills, but although this matter was too strange and weird, I have to say that I can't produce any evidence to accuse him of doing it. Logically speaking, it seemed unnecessary for him to do so."

"Is there a file on this matter?"

"There must be one in the National Police files. All unnatural deaths must undergo a death investigation. If you want to see my investigation notes, then you'll have to come to my office to see them yourself."

"No need, I trust your conclusion."

"However, through this investigation, I discovered some intriguing things," Ji Xin said. "Our Master Lu harbors soaring ambitions."

"Soaring ambitions?"

"Yes. It starts from a few years ago. At that time, both he and I were participating in a grassroots research activity of the Social Affairs Department, which incidentally also had the mission of taking in native orphans and impoverished children. At that time, he recommended and sponsored four children to study at Fangcaodi."

"Isn't that a good thing?"

"Correct. It is indeed very good," Ji Xin said. "Then he came to find me, saying he hoped I would help recommend two more children to enter Fangcaodi—recommending them in my name, with him paying the money."

"Why didn't he come forward himself?" Ma Jia asked. "There are quite a few Senators who sponsor native children to go to school. The Senate hasn't forbidden it either."

"He didn't say. I think he probably didn't want to appear too prominent himself," Ji Xin said. "I didn't pay much attention at the time. Later, when I started investigating because of the Zhang Family Manor matter, I found a problem—he sponsored too many people. There were more than ten studying at the time."

"More than ten?!"

"About eleven or twelve," Ji Xin nodded. "By now, counting those studying and those who have already graduated, there must be over twenty."

Ma Jia's expression changed slightly: recommending and sponsoring native children to enter school was considered a trend among Senators, similar to "playing charity" by wealthy people in the old world. Although there was vaguely a hint of cultivating personal followers, very few people would sponsor so many native students.

"This aroused my great interest, so I continued my private investigation and discovered even more interesting things."

"After these students graduate and get jobs, they still maintain very close contact with Lu Xuan. They often go to Zhang Family Manor to pay respects, kowtowing during festivals and holidays, and Lu Xuan also often gives them financial assistance," Ji Xin said. "That's not all. He has also adopted seven or eight native children in his own manor and educates them himself—these people are not in the naturalized citizen system; they are his slaves."

"This is keeping retainers!" Ma Jia's jaw almost dropped. He had thought Lu Xuan's sudden visit harbored malicious intent, but he didn't expect him to have such a move up his sleeve!

"You know, from a legal perspective, what he's doing isn't illegal. We haven't said that Senators can't keep slaves. Besides, these slaves are kept in his wife's name. As long as taxes are paid on time, it's legal. As for sponsoring students, many Senators do similar things..."

"But they didn't establish a relationship of personal dependency based on this!" Ma Jia pointed out the crux of the problem sharply.

Ji Xin nodded. "That is the crux of the problem."

"It's really thanks to you coming today," Ma Jia sighed.

"In my opinion, even if I hadn't come, you wouldn't have cooperated with him, would you?" Ji Xin smiled. "After all, the Law Society is also conducting research on political structural reform. Why help him carry the sedan chair and pick the fruit?"

Ma Jia smiled faintly, looking out the window and saying leisurely, "Even if the Law Society hadn't started this project, it would be timely to start it right now." He fell silent for a moment, then asked, "What business did you have suddenly proposing to meet me?"

"Coincidentally, it has to do with this Senator Lu," Ji Xin said. "You know I have an Indigenous Rights Protection Association." He smiled bitterly. "To be honest, this association isn't very popular. Not only do Senators find it an eyesore, but even Du Wen, who blows the trumpet for 'Labor is Sacred' all day long, attacks me daily for 'paralyzing the working people'." He let out a long breath. "However, because such an association exists, some naturalized citizens and natives are willing to come to me to pour out their grievances when they encounter problems. A few days ago, a Senator's lifestyle secretary came to find me and mentioned something."

"Which Senator? What matter?" Ma Jia was very interested.

"I won't say which Senator. Anyway, it has nothing to do with him. The key is this lifestyle secretary. She reported a situation to me: she said a classmate of hers from the maid training class is being abused very severely by her Senator and can barely survive..."

"Is it Lu Xuan's lifestyle secretary?"

"Yes."

Ma Jia was a bit incredulous: Senators had all kinds of personalities, and their ways of treating women were even more varied. But one thing was almost common, and that was that the humanitarianism and spirit of equality from the old world still had strong inertia in them. Treat the slaves of this spacetime, they could be considered "gentle and benevolent." Although he had heard that some Senators liked S&M tunes, tying up maids and dripping wax or spanking them, this was considered a "kink." Regardless of how they viewed their maids, affection was generally the mainstream. Deliberate abuse and wanton corporal punishment were unheard of.

"Maybe he just likes S&M, or likes to cosplay as a master..."

Ji Xin shook his head. "I am a person from the 21st century. I can distinguish what is S&M and what is corporal punishment. In short, it is not an exaggeration to say that she is blamed for every move she makes in Zhang Family Manor now. A few days ago, she even fainted from being made to kneel after a beating."

Seeing that Ma Jia still didn't quite believe it, he took out a notebook from his pocket: "I checked at the special outpatient clinics of Lingao General Hospital and Runshitang. There were no relevant medical records. However, in Runshitang's sales records, it is recorded that Lu Xuan's secretary purchased a kind of Chinese patent medicine for reducing swelling and removing stasis multiple times. I specifically consulted Liu San. Liu San said that this medicine is originally the 'stick wound medicine' used by the yamen runners for stick beatings. He improved the formula after obtaining it and gave it to Runshitang for production and sales.

"Judging from the quantity and frequency of her purchases, it is quite considerable. Liu San said that if it were really for treating injuries from whips and boards, that person would have been beaten to death long ago. So..."

"So you think that more than one lifestyle secretary in Zhang Family Manor is being subjected to corporal punishment and abuse, and it's a widespread phenomenon."

"Yes, corporal punishment of slaves in Zhang Family Manor should not be an isolated phenomenon."

"But this is not illegal," Ma Jia said.

"Yes, it's not illegal. Unless a life is lost," Ji Xin said. "That's why I came to discuss this issue with you."

"Even if a life is lost, according to the *Common Program*, Senators are not subject to any punishment," Ma Jia said. "Besides, the Senate has not abolished the slavery system yet. It is still legal for natives to keep slaves; even the Senate itself still has provisions for indentured servants. Even for lifestyle secretaries, a document was only recently issued to cancel their slave status."

"Is the Law Society not considering abolishing the slavery system?" Ji Xin said.

Ma Jia laughed. "You are very right, but it hasn't been put on the agenda yet. Everything has to wait until we take Guangdong. As for Hainan, at least we have made slavery very uneconomical. I think you are also very clear that economic means are sometimes much more effective than a simple official document. Hurriedly announcing a law that looks very correct but whose clauses are all generalities without implementation details is actually the same as having no law."

"I understand this. There are a thousand threads and ten thousand clues," Ji Xin said. "However, I think the matter of Lu Xuan's lifestyle secretary should be interfered with appropriately. If something really happens, I'm afraid it will be another uproar. I feel that our current political ecology has become very abnormal. People are jumping up and down in everything, attempting to muddy the waters."

"I'm afraid that will be difficult. Interfering in a Senator's private life is politically incorrect," Ma Jia said. "Unless a life is lost."

A look of sorrow and pity appeared on Ji Xin's face again. He did not delve further into this issue. Under the current system, they were indeed powerless. He asked:

"Then what about Senator Lu's proposal?" Ji Xin shook his head and said, "I always feel there are problems in this proposal."

"Of course there are problems," Ma Jia got up from his seat and sat down next to Ji Xin. He handed him another cigarette, and seeing him refuse, he lit one for himself. taking a deep drag, he said, "I also think it's not that simple."

"Then you still prepare to revise it for him? He wants the Law Society to endorse his proposal to increase its weight. Aren't you afraid of him seizing the initiative?"

" The purpose of this proposal is to standardize the functional authority of various administrative departments, which is in line with the policy of 'rule by law' advocated by our Law Society. As the Senate's policy advisory body, it is beyond reproach for the Grand Library to produce such a proposal to offer advice and suggestions to the Executive Committee. Since he asked us to revise it, the Law Society certainly cannot refuse outright. Otherwise, it would be unjustifiable. I think we will just correct some conceptual errors in administrative law in it and make no other changes. Naturally, the Law Society will not sign it either. Let the Grand Library take the limelight." He smiled as he said this. "No matter what they want to do, there will come a day when the map is unrolled and the dagger is revealed. If it is a fox, it will show its tail eventually."

Listening to Ma Jia finish this speech of smooth officialese, Ji Xin suddenly felt that the face of the man in front of him was a bit blurred.

Ma Jia seemed to sense Ji Xin's strangeness and patted him on the shoulder: "Our Law Society has always adhered to the concept of rule by law and does not play the trick of removing the ladder after climbing the wall."
