# Chapter 307 - Sweet Port Crisis: Heads

Master Zhu always slept in the courtyard of his study. It wasn't that he loathed seeing his wife—she had passed away years ago—but rather for the convenience of handling affairs. He stayed in his study until very late every day. Checking accounts, writing letters to out-of-town clients and branch staff, and reading correspondence were his main daily tasks. He especially had to personally calculate the accounts sent by shopkeepers, checking for any omissions or, worse, embezzlement.

As an employer, Master Zhu could hardly be called generous. Giving his staff enough to eat and money for clothes and baths was deemed sufficient; thus, most of his employees came from the poorest parts of Guangdong—people who would work for almost nothing but food. As for how their families survived or how they would support wives and children later, that was never his concern.

Consequently, mischief among the staff occurred from time to time. Unfortunately for them, no one could match Master Zhu's shrewdness. No matter how well doctored the accounts were, he could find the threads of deceit. Furthermore, he was an expert judge of expression; if a shopkeeper's look aroused suspicion, that man would soon be packing his bags. For decades, no one had ever taken advantage of him.

This morning, Master Zhu woke early as usual. Rising at dawn was an old habit, especially since the struggle with the South China factory was raging, making his sleep fitful. To guard against extreme measures from the "Australians," he had doubled the night watchmen and guards around the mansion.

As he stirred, the concubine sleeping beside him woke too. Having a woman beside him wasn't for carnal pleasure, but purely for the convenience of being served at night and in the morning. Unlike other wealthy men who lusted after beauty and kept many maids and concubines, Master Zhu often said: "Women are a burden—both physically and financially."

Today, Qiuhan was serving him. Because of Gu Dachun, Qiuhan's status in Master Zhu's household had risen, so the "privilege" of serving the master fell to her more often.
 
Qiuhan quickly got up, dressed, and hurriedly washed in the outer room. When she returned to the bedroom, she was neatly groomed. She spoke softly: "Master, won't you sleep a bit longer?"

"No more sleep!"

This dialogue was a daily constant.

Qiuhan took a thin lined jacket and draped it over his shoulders, helped him sit on the edge of the bed, put on his socks, leggings, and shoes. Then she helped him stand, tied his sash, and put on his long gown. Next came combing his hair and putting it up in a bun.

Suddenly, a scream rang out from outside, followed by the clang of a copper basin hitting the ground. Master Zhu frowned. Qiuhan quickly put down the comb and went to check.

Moments later, Qiuhan returned, looking panicked.

"Master! Under the eaves of the study... there are many boxes!"

"Boxes?" Master Zhu didn't understand immediately, but something was definitely wrong. He walked out of the bedroom and saw eleven wooden boxes arranged neatly under the eaves of his study.

His heart tightened instantly. Master Zhu remembered clearly that these things hadn't been there last night. Where had they come from?

"Open them!" At his command, a servant who had arrived stepped forward and opened one box. The servant suddenly shuddered violently, nearly throwing the lid away. He put it down quickly, his voice trembling:

"Master, it's a human head!"

Screams erupted from the women in the courtyard.

"What are you screaming for? Get them all out!" Master Zhu waved his hand impatiently and walked over himself.

Inside the box lay a complete human head preserved in lime. The bloodstains were fresh; it must have been severed recently. Master Zhu had never seen this man. *What does this mean?* He was puzzled.

The boxes were opened one by one. All contained heads. Suddenly, his heart nearly stopped. He clearly recognized the half-charred head of Qiuhan's brother, Gu Dachun, eyes half-closed.

He turned to Qiuhan, who was shrinking back. "Come here and look!"

"Your servant dares not—"

"Come here!" he roared impatiently.

Qiuhan fainted the moment she saw her brother's head. After reviving, she crawled to Master Zhu's feet, weeping and begging him to avenge her brother.

As for the other heads, Qiuhan identified them one by one. They were all key members of the Gu family pirate gang, all related in some way.

Qiuhan fainted from crying again, but Master Zhu had no mind to care for her. He was enveloped in a bone-chilling cold. He collapsed into the chair in his study, unable to stand for a long time.

The appearance of all these heads here meant one thing: the Gu family pirates had been wiped out. But that was secondary. Who could, overnight, unknowingly evade the night watchmen and guards to place eleven boxes of heads neatly under his study eaves?

This cold, precise action demonstrated the mastermind's confidence. They didn't regard his guards as anything at all. Moreover, they knew his every move perfectly. They struck in the dead of night, quietly bypassed all security, and accurately located one specific courtyard among many in the dark. This reality alone was enough to make him shudder.

This was a ruthless and pragmatic threat, and a warning—the South China factory was not without means to deal with him. And he had run out of tricks.

***

On the same day Beiwei led his men to deliver "gifts" to Zhu An, Wen Tong began his move on the Haiyi Guild's merchant houses. Liao Daxing, bearing gifts and followed by attendants, visited the sugar firms on Hai'an Street one by one, presenting six-item gift baskets.

This was South China Sugar's first public appearance on Hai'an Street. Although most owners politely declined via servants saying "the master is out" when Liao Daxing's card was presented, none refused the gifts. A few received him, exchanging pleasantries before seeing him out.

This probe confirmed Chen Tianxiong and the others' deduction: the attitude of most Haiyi Guild merchants had softened. Once news of Gu Dachun's annihilation at sea broke, Master Zhu's prestige on Hai'an Street would plummet. The Haiyi Guild sugar firms would shift their stance within days.

The anecdote of the eleven heads in the Zhu residence was spreading through every teahouse in Xuwen. Storytellers embellished it vividly, and listeners devoured it with gusto. Although the Haiyi Guild warned the teahouses on Hai'an Street to stop guests from spreading such rumors, the Haiyi Guild wasn't the government. People talked, and people listened.

A heavy, tense atmosphere pervaded Hai'an Street. In stark contrast, owners, shopkeepers, and stewards of various sugar firms were feasting, watching plays, and drinking with courtesans daily. In these settings, they whispered urgently, exchanging opinions.

The backbone of the Haiyi Guild, Master Zhu, was rarely seen at these gatherings. He was "ill." As for what illness, the Zhu household remained tight-lipped. Even if he wasn't "ill," he would hardly have his former persuasive power. The hearts of the people had scattered! Everyone in the Haiyi Guild knew this: two-thirds of the crushing season was gone, yet their sugar warehouses were empty. The South China factory showed no signs of collapsing; their ships continued to enter and leave Hai'an Harbor, shipping out sugar steadily. Seeing the number of farmers selling sugar dwindling, everyone panicked. The consensus prompted action: this deadlock could not continue.

"Report, Master," Wen Qing bowed to Chen Tianxiong and Wen Tong, who were engaged in their "post-meal chess game." "There's someone asking to see you. Boss Zhu of the Dachang Rice Shop brought him. Should we see him?"

Chen Tianxiong was pondering his move, hesitating with a "Horse" in hand.

"Who is it? Didn't you ask clearly?"

"Says he's from the Haiyi Guild—"

"Should we see him?" Wen Tong asked.

"No reason not to. Show him in."

Zhou Shizhai, watching in silence, spoke up: "Be careful. It's dark. In case..."

"Rest assured," Chen Tianxiong said. "Master Zhu doesn't have the guts for a 'dagger in the map' assassination." He smiled. "Besides, with you here, old brother, what do we have to fear?"

The visitor wore traveling clothes and a bamboo hat, seemingly trying to hide his face. When he took off the hat, Chen Tianxiong nodded.

"Boss Feng, a late-night visit. What advice do you have for us?"

"I dare not!" The visitor was Feng Guangfeng, boss of "Richangji." Hearing this stranger call out his name, he was startled. "Indeed, I am Feng Guangfeng." He bowed with hands clasped. "Is this Manager Wen?"

"This is Manager Wen. I am merely a lowly clerk," Chen Tianxiong said.

Greetings were exchanged. Chen Tianxiong didn't want the visitor to remember him too clearly, so he didn't give his name and deliberately sat in the shadows.

"Two managers!" Feng Guangfeng spoke earnestly. "This misunderstanding between the South China factory and the Haiyi Guild... The Haiyi Guild has offended you greatly. I have come specifically to apologize."

Wen Tong said, "Sugar business is one family, regardless of north, south, east, or west. We hope for your guidance and care in the future, brother."

"You are too kind," Feng Guangfeng said. "I have come this time..."

"Wait," Chen Tianxiong interjected. "Is Boss Feng here representing 'Richangji' or the 'Haiyi Guild'?"

The implication was significant. Feng Guangfeng dared not answer casually. After a pause, he said, "Naturally, the Haiyi Guild!"

"So, the Haiyi Guild knows you are here?"

"Not everyone—" Feng Guangfeng quickly clarified. "However, most of the Haiyi Guild, high and low, would be glad to see me here."
