# Chapter 1819 - Civil Service Consultation

"Since she's from Lingao, she must be very familiar with the chiefs' affairs. But a mere woman probably doesn't know much about Great Song's official positions either... Ah, might as well go ask. At worst, she still knows more than those who need retakes."

Though he thought this, actually going up to speak to her made him hesitate. Naturalized police officers transferred from Lingao held ranks of at least Police Third-Grade Superintendent (Second Lieutenant). Almost all held leadership or technical specialist positions. To newly-recruited local police, they were practically figures in the clouds. Every word and deed naturally radiated authority, inspiring awe.

This Lian Nishang—supposedly demoted to Guangzhou—held the position of Deputy Section Chief of the Guangzhou Municipal Police Bureau's Household Registration Section. To Li Ziyu, that was a genuine "big official."

Though Australians always preached "equality between officers and soldiers," and superiors rarely put on airs, including Elders who were unfailingly "approachable"—still, casually striking up conversation with a superior remained somewhat daunting for Li Ziyu, raised in the rigidly hierarchical Ming.

He hesitated for quite a while before finally steeling himself to step forward and greet her:

"Officer! I'm Li Ziyu from the Public Security Section. I have something to ask you for guidance." Li Ziyu stood respectfully across from Lian Nishang, using Cantonese-accented official Australian to introduce himself.

Before he'd finished, Li Ziyu suddenly noticed that this young female officer's hair was actually streaked with much gray. His heart lurched.

Lian Nishang looked up and smiled in response: "Comrade Li, hello. You don't need to be so formal. Please sit."

Li Ziyu quickly sat down. Looking at Lian Nishang up close, he noticed that despite her youth, fine wrinkles had appeared around her eyes. She looked very tired. Li Ziyu wondered if Officer Lian had some troubles on her mind. Seeing her show a puzzled expression, he hurried to say:

"Senior officer just transferred from Lingao?"

"Hehe, just call me 'comrade'... Yes, I've only been here about a month."

"Oh, are you settling in here in Guangzhou? Conditions must be much worse than Lingao?"

"It's fine, nothing unusual... When I was wandering in the past, sleeping in the wind, starving and freezing—I got through that too. Besides, Guangzhou—I once stayed in its charity hall for several months."

"Then you've returned in glory."

"'Glory' is too much. Just following work assignments." Lian Nishang's face showed loneliness as she spoke.

Li Ziyu heard this and knew the rumors about demotion to Guangzhou were probably true. He quickly changed the subject:

"Officer Lian, you don't have to take our professional exams. Why are you still here reading?"

"The chiefs say 'knowledge is power.' Our Great Song can defeat the False Ming each time precisely because the chiefs are omniscient. As subjects of Great Song, we should study more too."

Li Ziyu thought: *You're a woman—what more do you need to learn?* But still asked curiously: "Officer Lian, what book are you reading?"

"Oh, just some Great Song cases. Some are murder cases, some are just household matters. They're written as short stories. Reading them passes time as entertainment while also broadening experience."

"As the saying goes, 'Even upright officials find household matters hard to judge.' Yet the chiefs rather like managing such household trifles..." Thinking of his own daily street duties dealing with trivial matters, Li Ziyu couldn't help inwardly crying out: *I'm supposed to be a man who'll reach life's peak with the Australians!*

"You don't understand this. In police work, trivial matters can be very important. In Hainan's public security work, household matters account for a considerable proportion. If small matters aren't promptly and properly handled, they accumulate into big matters. For example, this case—it was precisely domestic violence: a husband chronically abusing his child-bride-origin wife. Because the local station didn't intervene in time, eventually the wife poisoned and killed her husband's entire family..."

"Ah, that's too vicious! Utterly against morality!" Li Ziyu was truly indignant. "Such an outrage against human relations—even a death by slicing would be appropriate."

Lian Nishang gave him a somewhat displeased look: "The court's verdict said that while her murder was certainly criminal, the husband's family had abused her for years—neighbors and relatives all testified, and the hospital had injury verification evidence—showing mitigating circumstances. So she was sentenced to lifetime exile to Kaohsiung."

"That, that's really too lenient. Setting aside the several lives at stake, just this transgression against human relations, this crime of murdering a husband and elder—granting her a quick death would already be great mercy. Yet they spared her life—that's simply inconceivable!" Li Ziyu's shock intensified. "And she didn't even get the death penalty—how is that reasonable?"

Li Nishang gave a cold smile: "So you didn't personally chop her into a thousand pieces to defend moral order—quite a pity?"

Li Ziyu suddenly snapped awake—what nonsense was he spouting?! Openly attacking the Elder Council's laws and precedents—and in front of a "veteran Australian hand" at that! This was practically suicide. Cold sweat instantly broke out as he hurried to explain: "No, no... I just felt that several lives were at stake. Even if there were mitigating circumstances, sparing her life seems... seems... really quite... too lenient..."

Only then did Lian Nishang's expression ease slightly: "You're new, so it's understandable. Let the pedants blather about 'moral order.' Just speaking of the facts: if the police had intervened in time to stop the husband's chronic abuse, perhaps none of this would have happened afterward. So household trifles, once accumulated, can also kill people."

"But, but, can the police really interfere in a wife being beaten by her husband?" Li Ziyu was still puzzled.

"How can they not? In Lingao, there are cases of women beaten by their men going to the Dongmen Citizens' Court to file complaints. There are also women crying to the police station. Besides domestic violence, every year we handle a considerable number of civil disputes classified as household disputes."

"Women beaten by husbands take it to court??!!" Li Ziyu was even more shocked—this was simply unheard of! A shrewish virago! He couldn't help blurting out: "That's too... too... too..." Then he suddenly remembered he'd just misspoken. If he said anything now that irked this cold-faced female "Australian hand," things would go badly—if she whispered a few slanderous words to the real Australians, never mind promotion, his life might be in danger!

He quickly covered himself, diverting the topic: "This is truly unheard of in the Great Ming. Even if a woman's natal family is powerful, they'd rather not openly make a scene. They fear 'airing dirty laundry.'"

"Even in Hainan, not many women are willing to speak up. As for 'dirty laundry,' that's the men's shame. If a woman gets beaten, she's not allowed to talk about it? Officer Li, your professional development still needs work. Why do you still have the False Ming's old thinking?"

"No, no, not at all. It's just a bit peculiar." Li Ziyu shook his head like a rattle drum, hurrying to distance himself. He knew if he continued on this topic, sooner or later he'd get in trouble. He quickly said: "Listening to you, senior, is better than three years of reading! Great Song's laws are truly different from the False Ming's. I still need to study more! Please, whenever you have time, give me more guidance!"

Lian Nishang nodded slowly: "Guidance is too much. I see you're still a salvageable person. Let's just study together."

Li Ziyu found her wording really quite awkward. But he didn't dare offend her. He could only nod in agreement and quickly move to the main topic:

"To be honest, I have a friend interested in this civil service exam, but it's completely unprecedented with nothing to reference. It's really hard to know where to start. There are some questions I wonder if I could ask, senior? This exam is the first of its kind for everyone. Senior has long served under the chiefs—you must understand much more clearly..."

"This civil service exam never existed in Lingao either. I can only share what I know. Whether it's useful depends on your friend himself..."

"Thank you so much, senior. I'm truly grateful..." Li Ziyu relaxed inwardly.

Li Ziyu's questions were mainly about selecting exam positions.

"...My friend studied at a private academy for a few years. Can read and calculate. Essays are passable too. Qualifications all match. It's just there are hundreds of positions with different names. And he doesn't know specifically what each does. He doesn't know how to choose the best option."

Lian Nishang looked at the recruitment notice and explained each department's functions one by one. She also described the general duties of each position. This opened Li Ziyu's eyes: who knew Australian official positions were divided so minutely! No wonder this civil service recruitment needed several hundred at once.

"...Actually, if your friend wants to take the exam, he should consider what he wants to do and what he's good at. The specific work content—with the False Ming's education level—is far from sufficient. After passing and starting work, everyone needs retraining. So any exam is essentially the same. Just depends on what he's willing to do."

"I see." Li Ziyu nodded.

"Speaking of the False Ming, naturally positions have fat and lean, comfortable and hard distinctions. These civil service positions similarly have this issue. Generally speaking, field work is harder but income and advancement are better. Office work is relatively easier but income is less and promotion is slower—though technical positions, if you can specialize deeply, also have fast advancement. If willing to work in outer counties, conditions are harsher and there's some danger, but future prospects are much broader."

"So the Elder Council values practical work most!"

Lian Nishang nodded: "Exactly. Our Great Song's selection of officials prizes practical talent above all: enduring hardship, working hard, getting things done. Such people naturally have unlimited futures."

"I see, I see." Li Ziyu nodded repeatedly.

"About testing for civil service, there's much more that could be said. But since your friend has studied, as long as he conscientiously studies the exam materials, passing shouldn't be a problem. As for future prospects—that depends on himself." She glanced at the study room's big clock. "It's getting late. I need to go to the cafeteria."
