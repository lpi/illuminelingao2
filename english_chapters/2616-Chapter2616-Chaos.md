# Chapter 2616: Chaos

Guan Youde bid farewell to Zhong Ji and dragged his groggy head home, not even greeting acquaintances he met along the way.

With a *squeak*, the door was pushed open. The adobe house was empty, with few valuable things. It was not an exaggeration to say that the family had nothing but bare walls.

After squinting on the dilapidated bed for a while, Guan Youde got up, lit firewood on the small stove, and started brewing medicine. All the silver in the family these years had been consumed in the medicine jar.

He didn't know what sin he had committed in his previous life to get a strange disease in the prime of his life. In ten years, he had seen all the famous and fashionable doctors around. He also invited gods from Daoists, and drank plenty of talisman water from shamans and witches, but he just didn't get better. His body became worse day by day, yet God wouldn't let him die immediately. After the Australians fought in, he pawned his family property to scrape together silver to seek medical treatment at the Provincial and Port General Hospital. A doctor named Fu said it was some intractable disease and prescribed him a Chinese medicine formula. Strange to say, it actually stabilized his illness. For the past two years, he relied on this prescription to prolong his life.

After drinking the medicine, Guan Youde remembered meeting a childhood playmate doing business in the city when seeing a doctor in Guangzhou, who had invited him to make a fortune together. He couldn't help having ideas in his heart. He touched his empty money bag and rummaged through the house, only finding a small piece of broken silver, not even enough for travel expenses to Guangzhou City.

"I can only go to that stinking woman and rebellious son to demand some silver to use." Guan Youde thought in his heart.

At dusk, Guan Youde came to a mulberry dike not far outside the village, where several silkworm farmers' thatched huts were located. The walls of the thatched huts were woven from mulberry branches cut in winter and plastered with mud, and the roof was covered with rice straw. This kind of thatched hut was the residence of local poor silkworm farmers, where the silkworm room and bedroom were mixed and undivided. Due to simple construction and low cost, they were widely distributed. Wherever there were mulberry fields, such silkworm huts were seen.

Guan Youde pushed the door and entered. He saw a haggard middle-aged woman wearing ragged clothes feeding mulberry leaves to silkworms in the dim thatched hut. The woman glanced at Guan Youde, her face gloomy, saying nothing, her hands working non-stop, as if as long as she didn't stop, Guan Youde would automatically disappear.

"Give me two taels of silver; I want to go to Guangzhou City." Guan Youde said to the woman. He didn't call her name, nor did he use a title.

Hearing this, the woman was very dissatisfied and said, "The silver is all managed by Bao'er."

Guan Youde scolded unhappily, "You slut, what kind of attitude is this? Do you still have me, the head of the family, in your eyes?"

"The head of the family should look like a head of the family." The woman retorted, her words having thorns.

Guan Youde also got angry and scolded, "My being betrayed by everyone and separated from wife and children in this life is all caused by you, this cheap woman! If you hadn't cuckolded me, would I have become this ghost-like appearance now?"

"Hmph," the woman sneered, thinking in her heart: *What a 'betrayed by everyone and separated from wife and children.' I am your wife. Following you in this life, I haven't enjoyed half a day of blessing. You got a strange disease yourself, and the family property was all consumed by you, yet you blame me! You are fickle and unjust, hooked up with wild women, and even beat me out of the house. Now you have the face to add crimes to my head. Why is God so blind not to let the King of Hell take you earlier?*

It turned out this woman was Guan Youde's wife by first marriage, Huang *Shi* (User's Note: Huang Clan/Lady Huang), who was driven out of the house by him going crazy two years ago.

Guan Youde scolded for a while. Huang *Shi* just endured, continuing to say nothing. At this time, the leaky thatched door was pushed open, and a fifteen or sixteen-year-old teenager came in. This was the "Bao'er" in Huang *Shi*'s mouth, and also the only offspring of her and Guan Youde, named Guan Zongbao.

Seeing Guan Youde here, Guan Zongbao's mood suddenly became very low. He didn't want to look at him even once, nor did he call him, going straight to help Huang *Shi* work.

Guan Youde exploded instantly and scolded, "Guan Zongbao, do you still have me, this Dad, in your eyes? Are you my son or not?"

Huang *Shi* also flared up and screamed, "How is he not your son?"

"If you are my son, you refuse to even call me Dad! Do you have a shred of respect for me, this Dad?" Guan Youde said exasperatedly.

"Ask yourself, what have you done in so many years worthy of my respect?" Guan Zongbao didn't know where the courage came from, stiffening his neck to roar back at Guan Youde. Usually, he hid if he could and avoided if he could.

"Then you are not my son! Do you dare to go to the ancestral hall with me and drip blood to recognize kin in front of the whole clan! If it drips out that you are not my son, I won't look for you in the future, nor need you to be responsible." Guan Youde scolded while taking out matches and cigarettes to light up.

Seeing this, Huang *Shi* shouted anxiously, "Don't smoke here! The silkworms will be smoked to death by you! Get out quickly!"

Seeing his mother anxious, Guan Zongbao also stepped forward and shouted, "Get out!"

Guan Youde saw the sky was turning upside down. The stinking woman and son dared to shout at him like this; he simply exploded with rage, scolding, "You dare to drive me out! This is my home! I am the head of the family!"

"Go back to your Guan Family Village to be the head of the family! These two thatched huts were built by me and my Mom with bundles of branches and handfuls of grass!" Guan Zongbao was very indignant, shouting back without showing weakness.

How could Guan Youde stand this anger? He slapped Guan Zongbao on the face with a backhand. Guan Zongbao was beaten back two steps, momentarily furious, rushing up to wrestle with Guan Youde. Since ancient times, a son beating a father was the most despised behavior in feudal ethics. Guan Zongbao didn't dare to strike hard, only trying to find a way to press Guan Youde on the ground to stop him from moving. Guan Youde showed no mercy when hitting people, but unfortunately, he was riddled with old illness after all, and his strength couldn't compare to the teenage Guan Zongbao. After hitting Guan Zongbao a few times, he was pressed on the ground.

Seeing the father and son fighting, Huang *Shi* was so anxious that tears flowed uncontrollably, crying and wailing.

How could Guan Youde be willing to give up? Seeing no chance of winning, he opened his mouth and bit firmly on Guan Zongbao's calf. Guan Zongbao hurt so much that he quickly let go of his leg. Because he used too much force just now, Guan Zongbao's limbs were now weak, hands and feet like filled with lead, and instead, he was gained the upper hand by Guan Youde.

Seeing this, Huang *Shi*, afraid her son would be beaten into some mishap, rushed up to hit Guan Youde, shouting, "Don't hit my son, don't hit my son. If you want to hit, hit me..."

Guan Youde let go of Guan Zongbao and went to hit Huang *Shi* again. For a time, the thatched hut was in chaos like chickens flying and dogs jumping. Crying and shouting mixed together. Neighbors living nearby were attracted over, and only then separated them. Seeing it was someone else's family affair, neighbors only offered kind words of persuasion; no one was willing to uphold justice.

Guan Youde spat and said, "Give me two taels of silver; I want to go to Guangzhou!"

Huang *Shi* cried, "Two taels of silver! With the chaos of war these two years, don't you know how hard life is? If given to you, what will mother and son use to buy charcoal for drying cocoons and silkworm papers for the next crop?"

Guan Youde snorted coldly, "Whether you steal or sell, what does it matter to me? You are my wife; giving money to me is justified by heaven and earth! I worked hard to raise the son; now it should be his turn to support the father!"

Guan Zongbao knew that Guan Youde would never give up today without getting silver. He only felt infinite resentment in his heart but didn't know where to vent it. Gritting his teeth, he said, "Silver! Silver! You only know silver! When have you ever had us mother and son in your heart?"

After speaking, Guan Zongbao rummaged in the thatched hut. From several different locations on the roof, wall, and underground, he dug out a few pieces of broken silver, totaling about one tael, and threw them to Guan Youde: "If you want silver, take it. Don't come to bother us in the future!"

Guan Youde picked up the silver, weighed it in his hand, and sneered, "I will come back." After speaking, he left without looking back.

After the fight just now, Guan Zongbao was weak all over, mouth and tongue dry. The soaring adrenaline in his blood made his face pale and head dizzy. Thirsty and unbearable, he scooped up a bowl of cold water from the bucket and drank it. After a while, he felt uncomfortable in his stomach and vomited holding the urine bucket.

Huang *Shi* had endured for many years. Since the family shame was seen by neighbors today, she cried and complained in front of them. If she didn't speak up at this time, in a few days, unfavorable gossip about her mother and son would spread in the village. Bystanders couldn't manage this matter. After listening, apart from sighing, it had no effect. Kind people would at most say a few words about Guan Youde's fault when hearing gossip.

After the neighbors dispersed, only a mess was left in the thatched hut. Guan Zongbao took out a candle, struck a match to light it. The shadows of mother and son flickered under the weak flame.

Guan Zongbao looked at his calf, on which a gruesome teeth mark was left, still bleeding. He remembered the clan elders said that animals' mouths were poisonous and had to be washed with burning wine (alcohol) if bitten, so he rummaged through general debris to find a small bottle of burning wine and poured it on. It hurt so much that tears appeared in the corners of his eyes.

Huang *Shi*'s eyes were dull and her expression trance-like, just silently shedding tears. The burden of survival already made her breathless, and there was still a plague-god-like man at home coming to disturb from time to time.

After treating the wound, Guan Zongbao asked Huang *Shi*, "Mom, what to do in the future?"

Huang *Shi* cried, "This god-damned one, why doesn't God take him away! I don't know what sin I committed in my previous life to come to pay the debt. I have had enough of such days..."

Hearing Huang *Shi* had thoughts of suicide, Guan Zongbao hurriedly said, "Mom, if you don't want to live with him, then don't live with him."

Huang *Shi* said, "I thought about it too, but with his appearance now, how could he possibly divorce me? If he were a beast thing, he would have been beaten to death and sold for meat long ago. Who told him to be a human too."

"Then let's go far away to another hometown and never come back."

Huang *Shi* hesitated slightly, "If mother and son leave, he will definitely go to my maiden home to cause trouble. Your grandpa is old, and uncle is useless..."

Guan Zongbao was also resentful in his heart. Neighbors were poor, but families were harmonious, and days would eventually get better. Why was his home chaotic all day long? All roots lay in that person; he must find a way to get rid of him.
