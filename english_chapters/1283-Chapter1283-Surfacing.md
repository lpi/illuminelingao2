# Chapter 1283 Surfacing

"On D-Day, when the 1st Marine Expeditionary Detachment was clearing Zhongzuosuo City, they discovered two Lingao-manufactured naval guns on the city wall. After checking the inscriptions, it was confirmed that these two cannons were the naval guns from the Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 that went missing from the Navy some time ago." The screen immediately displayed two smoothbore cannons that had fallen among broken bricks and sandbags. The gun mounts were damaged, but the cannons were intact, and the cast inscriptions, emblems, and dates could be seen very clearly.

Photos of the two cannons appeared on the screen, showing the whole view and close-ups from various angles, including the gun bodies and the damaged mounts. Only the artillery foundry in Lingao could manufacture this kind of cannon.

Then came a dozen more photos showing the ammunition, fuses, and supporting tools on the cannons.

"Very complete." Wen Desi said.

"Yes. After receiving my order, the Planning Academy's Special Search Team conducted a carpet search around the artillery firing position and discovered the ammunition and equipment supporting these cannons—all of which were equipment from Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64."

"Wait..." Wen Desi raised his hand when a picture of a shrapnel fuse was shown, "They also used this kind of fuse?"

"Yes. According to the reports from Shi Zhiqi and the marines, they were shot at by these two cannons during the attack, including shrapnel shells."

A low murmur of discussion arose in the conference room. This kind of fuse was technology from the 19th century. In this spacetime, it was a unique skill of Lingao. It could be said that apart from the Fubo Army's naval and land artillery, absolutely no other armed force could use this kind of fuse correctly.

"So, there are people trained by us in Zheng Zhilong's ranks?"

"About this, there is no definite evidence yet." Xu Ke said, "However, the Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 incident was indeed done by the Zheng clique. I will report on this point as the last item."

"Okay, please continue."

"Yes." Xu Ke clicked the mouse, and the weapon workshop on Gulangyu appeared on the screen.

"This is the weapon workshop newly built by the Zheng clique that we discovered on Gulangyu—mainly used for casting cannons." He displayed photos and surveying materials of various facilities and appliances in the workshop one by one.

"We handed over the photos and surveying materials of the entire workshop facilities to several Senators in the Manufacturing Supervision Department who have a relatively deep understanding of cannon casting and production organization for analysis. The conclusion they reached is that this is a very well-designed cannon casting workshop. The design concepts of some facilities are not only higher than the East Asian level in this spacetime but also superior to the current highest European standards."

Xu Ke displayed the next group of photos.

"This is one of the two facilities considered most suspicious by the Senators of the Manufacturing Supervision Department: the reverberatory furnace."

Most people present knew what a reverberatory furnace was. The principle of the reverberatory furnace was simple, and the construction difficulty was not great—after Japan opened its country with the Black Ships and before the Meiji Restoration, the Shogunate also engaged in a Westernization Movement for a while, which included building reverberatory furnaces under the guidance of Europeans and casting cannons according to the European model. Although the cannons cast were still smoothbore cannons, the pig iron water from the secondary smelting in the reverberatory furnace with higher furnace temperature was relatively pure, and the quality of the cast cannons was improved.

"The Senators in the metallurgy and casting sectors confirmed that the furnaces in this group of photos are all reverberatory furnaces used to melt pig iron for secondary smelting. The Science and Technology Group of the Great Library confirmed: In this spacetime, reverberatory furnaces of this structure have not yet appeared. So it is impossible that some European technician helped Zheng Zhilong build them."

There was another slight commotion below.

"The second item has not yet taken shape." Xu Ke clicked on the photo, which was the building resembling a square watchtower he saw in the cannon yard and various bamboo and wooden accessories found nearby.

"After identification by Senators from the mechanical and construction sectors, they unanimously agreed that this is an unfinished windmill. No bearings and transmission systems used inside the windmill were found around the windmill, so it should not have been completed yet. The Senator from the construction company pointed out that judging solely from the building structure, this windmill is very similar to the windmills we currently use widely for water lifting and drainage."

"Zheng Zhilong definitely didn't build this to grind flour or lift water." Someone joked below. Xu Ke also smiled and said:

"The Senator from the mechanical sector analyzed and said that there are two possibilities for building a windmill. One is to provide power for the boring machine used for cannons, and the other is to grind gunpowder. Perhaps both are possible. In short, this is obviously a practice to improve work efficiency." Xu Ke then introduced the facilities, material preparation, and recruitment of craftsmen in this cannon yard, especially the crucibles.

Using crucibles was nothing more than to obtain high-quality steel, but in cannon casting, neither China nor the West needed steel before the mid-19th century. Moreover, the amount of steel smelted by crucibles was too small. It was fine for manufacturing a small number of swords or tools, but it was uneconomical to use it to make cannons.

If it was to obtain high-quality swords, it was not worth mentioning for the Zheng Zhilong clique who controlled the trade route to Japan. So the possibility of manufacturing swords could be ruled out.

"...From the on-site investigation and the confession of the captives, we learned: This workshop is close to completion. Judging from the large amount of cannon casting materials they have already hoarded and the large number of craftsmen recruited in advance, the Zheng Zhilong clique has very high expectations for this cannon factory—this may be related to their refreshing of naval equipment. In the shipyard on the beach near the cannon casting factory, we found several large Fujian ships under construction that have been improved. These two ships are close to completion. We are considering towing them back to Hong Kong for further investigation—these are the photos of the ships."

"There are ribs, there are decks, and this unusual length-to-width ratio: I see it's about 4." Wen Desi commented, "This ship is an improved version of the Fujian ship. The deck and ribs are improvements made for installing cannons."

"Yes." Xu Ke nodded, "Experts from the Navy say so too."

"So, up to now, except for the shipyard, this munitions workshop has not yet been put into production?"

"Yes. There are no traces of production in the workshop—although according to the assessment, they could have started production completely. According to the captives, they were waiting for 'foreign cannons'. After our analysis, we believe that the so-called foreign cannons by the captives should refer to 'sample cannons', because in Jinmen and Xiamen, we found cannons manufactured by various countries: British, Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish castings are all there, with calibers ranging from 1 pound to 24 pounds. furthermore, they also have the two cannons from our ship—obviously, they do not lack foreign cannons."

Finally, Xu Ke talked about the issue of Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64.

"According to our interrogation of the captured prisoners, we obtained the following intelligence: The patrol boat was brought back by Zheng Zhilong's brother Zheng Zhifeng and others some time ago, and repairs were carried out at the dock. At the same time, the cannons and some equipment on the ship were dismantled."

At this time, a portrait of a young man appeared on the screen, labeled: "Zheng Zhifeng".

"We failed to capture Zheng Zhifeng. As for other high-ranking captives captured, they knew very little about this matter. However, we still gained something: several staff members confessed: The Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 was hijacked by someone Zheng family hired at a high price, and then handed over to the Zheng family." Hearing this, another small commotion appeared in the conference room, which quieted down in a flash.

"...In order to find out the specific situation, our bureau conducted an investigation in Jinmen, Xiamen, Anping and other places. Regretfully, Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 was not found, nor were other equipment on the ship found—including the typewriter and the equipped ammunition. They seem to have disappeared.

"Considering that capturing the Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 almost intact is not something ordinary pirates can do, therefore, we are very curious about who did it. Although we didn't catch Zheng Zhifeng himself, we captured many of his staff, personal soldiers, and family servants. Through further interrogation of these people, we learned that this was done by a Japanese Christian named Paul. Moreover, in addition to this, it is said that this person also promised to provide the Zheng family with firearms such as cannons, claiming that they are not much worse than Lingao's." Hearing this, the faces of everyone in the conference room became even more solemn.

"Since Zheng Zhilong kept secret about how he contacted Mr. Paul, we couldn't get more information from the staff. But through interrogation of Zheng Zhifeng's entourage, we obtained a portrait of Mr. Paul." A portrait of a typical East Asian man's face, about thirty-five to forty years old and in his prime, appeared on the screen.

"Everyone present may not necessarily be clear about this person, but presumably everyone knows Rando." Xu Ke paused. In his heart, Xu Ke was unwilling to mention his colleague, but he also understood his duty very well. "When Senator Rando first arrived in Lingao, the Political Security General Bureau interrogated him many times. At that time, he mentioned that when crossing spacetime, the small boat he was on encountered a storm. At that time, there were two Filipino crew members, a German chief mate, and a Japanese person on the boat." A photo of a naked white man's corpse appeared on the screen this time.

"This is the German chief mate, who died because his head hit the console. His name was Paul." Xu Ke paused intentionally so that others could organize their thoughts. "The two Filipino crew members went missing after encountering the storm, presumably swept into the waves. Paul died. The Japanese man was named Black (Heire), and he climbed onto the lifeboat with Rando. Later, the lifeboat was overturned by waves, and they were separated since then. Rando never met him again."

What appeared on the screen was a portrait of an East Asian man aged about thirty, with short hair, no beard, a sturdy build, a relatively fair face, and a smooth forehead.

"This is the portrait of Black drawn based on Rando's description at that time. It can be seen that the images of the two portraits match very well." This portrait was superimposed with the previous portrait, and the contours and facial features were very similar.
