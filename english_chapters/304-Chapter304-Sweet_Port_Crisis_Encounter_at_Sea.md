# Chapter 304 - Sweet Port Crisis: Encounter at Sea

To the east, roughly six nautical miles away, a column of ten or so vessels of varying sizes appeared.

Le Lin, the first mate of the *Great Whale*, raised his telescope and studied the distant ships' course with intense concentration.

A light breeze filled the *Great Whale*'s two stiff sails, pushing the ship along at two knots. The first mate checked his watch. They had been underway for two hours since leaving Hai'an harbor.

The *Great Whale* had entered Hai'an the previous night and offloaded two hundred *shi* of rice, then loaded two hundred *shi* of sugar. Originally, the plan excluded loading sugar—after all, the ship's mission was bait; in battle, cargo integrity was impossible. Whether soaked, burned, or bloodstained, the sugar would be unsaleable. Moreover, sugar was an excellent accelerant.

But loading no sugar would make the bait unconvincing—and the enemy had spies on Hai'an Street.

Xi Yazhou raised his telescope. He had deleted too many posts from the Lingao BBS and his popularity had plummeted. He was eager for an opportunity to distinguish himself. This was a naval operation, but with key Navy personnel away, the *Great Whale* was designated as bait—essentially artillery and close-quarters combat—so an Army officer could command. Ship handling remained the Navy crew's responsibility.

"First mate," he said. "Are those the pirates the Haiyi Guild hired?"

"Very likely," Le Lin replied. "We can't be certain yet—wait until they get closer."

"Good. Order a heightened alert. Everyone prepare."

The order was relayed. Lookouts increased to four.

"Send a message to A Squadron: suspicious vessels sighted approximately six nautical miles away." Xi Yazhou stood on the sterncastle, feeling like a general—though the deck piled with burlap sacks detracted from the image.

A Squadron—two trawlers providing cover—held station ten nautical miles south. Once combat commenced, they would rush to assist. If the enemy had fewer than four ships, they would destroy them; if more, they would defend the *Great Whale* and force the pirates toward Chrysanthemum Islets.

The fleet closed rapidly at an estimated four knots, using sails plus six to eight sculling oars per ship.

"They're sculling hard to catch us," Le Lin observed.

"Pirates for certain!" Le Lin lowered his telescope.

"Agreed. All hands, battle stations!"

The ship's bell clanged. Sailors and Army gunners sprinted to posts. Sugar sacks went below; sand-filled bags remained as emplacements. Seawater pumped onto decks guarded against incendiary attack.

The approaching fleet belonged to Gu Dachun—ten vessels including seven recently recruited freelance boats. Five thousand taels from Master Zhu and the previous raid's proceeds had emboldened him. This time, Master Zhu's message was explicit: seizing sugar was secondary; the goal was ensuring no ship except Haiyi Guild vessels would dare haul sugar from Leizhou.

Gu Dachun intended to show no mercy. His three ships were armed with over a dozen cannons, but without competent gunners, combat would hinge on boarding. Pirates massed on deck, weapons ready.

Of ten enemy vessels, three were twin-masted with three to five cannons each. The remaining seven were smaller, carrying no artillery but packed with armed men. The enemy had eleven to fifteen cannons; the *Great Whale* had four. Over a hundred marines would face seven or eight hundred adversaries.

The transmigrators had to avoid boarding combat. Numbers would tell in close quarters—there was nowhere to run on a ship.

By eight o'clock, the pirate fleet had maneuvered one nautical mile upwind. Three twin-masted vessels took center; seven others fanned out to encircle the *Great Whale*.

"We must not let them near," Xi Yazhou told Le Lin. "Concentrate all firepower on one flank. All guns—target the starboard side."
