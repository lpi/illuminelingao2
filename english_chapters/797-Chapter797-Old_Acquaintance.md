# Chapter 797 – Old Acquaintance

Lin Ming spent a delightful night with the dancing girl, the details of which, like drinking kvass in a mandarin duck bath, need not be elaborated. Though young, Li Yongxun knew what business her cousin-in-law was up to behind closed doors with a Hu girl, so she naturally didn't disturb them.

Seeing the lights extinguish in her brother-in-law's room, the sounds that had made her restless silenced. The watchman beat the drum outside. She knew it was late, but she still didn't want to sleep—today's sights and experiences had sufficiently piqued Li Yongxun's curiosity, making sleep difficult. She could only sit alone in the courtyard watching ants climb trees, scheming how to persuade her brother-in-law to take her to Lingao.

Li Yongxun, like a newborn calf fearing no tiger, had traveled alone from Nanjing to Guangzhou. But she dared not act rashly regarding Lingao—Lin Ming had threatened her before: saying the Guangzhou-Foshan area wasn't like the inland; it was full of merchants trading overseas. If she were tied up and sold to the Eastern or Western Oceans, separated by vast seas in barbarian lands, even the Emperor couldn't save her. This scared Li Yongxun into behaving. Although Lingao was Ming territory, it was now in the hands of the overseas barbarian Australians. There were many rumors about Australians "lacking women," so she dared not deliver herself to their door.

"Sigh—" After her tenth sigh, she remembered she hadn't seen the "great clip-board ships" (galleons) she intended to see today. she stood up and took a few steps; it seemed not to hurt much.

"Tomorrow I must go see the great clip-board ships!" Li Yongxun vowed silently.

Suddenly, lantern light shone outside the courtyard's moon gate. Someone seemed to be walking in the long corridor, muttering something. Then she heard a man's voice, instantly triggering a memory.

That strange accent had left a deep impression on her. Hearing it again was like breaking a memory jar in her mind; the events of disguising herself as a songstress in Guangzhou, deceiving men, stealing, and getting caught all flooded back. The face of the medicine merchant Manager Huang, whom she had drugged and whose luggage contained many strange good things, immediately surfaced. That wretched appearance, looking at her with lecherous eyes—even wanting to strip her clothes... If she hadn't found the Embroidered Uniform Guard badge she'd swiped, making him wary, he might have bullied her then and there. "Humiliation at the inn" had always been a sore point for Li Yongxun.

Could that wretched Manager Huang be here too? Li Yongxun's curiosity surged—what was he doing here? Huang Shunlong's place didn't sell medicine. Ignoring her foot injury, she shrank into the wall's shadow and limped quietly toward the moon gate.

The person walking with the lantern was indeed the "wretched man" Li Yongxun resented, Huang Tianyu. Huang Tianyu's presence in Macau had nothing to do with the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's activities—he was on a business trip for the Ministry of Light Industry, tasked with installing three sets of sanitary equipment ordered by the Macau Jesuits and providing maintenance and training for existing users.

The Ministry of Light Industry had exported several sets of sanitary equipment to Macau. These facilities were complex and expensive, representing low efficiency by old time-space standards. Each set required its own small high-level water tower, water heating furnace, and water-lifting equipment. Since steam engines couldn't be widely distributed yet, water lifting relied on tragically inefficient animal-powered treadmills or even more primitive human-powered chain pumps. As for heating, they dared not use boilers, opting for water heaters where cold water flowed through a serpentine pipe inside a furnace to be heated.

These devices were designed for robustness, simplicity, and durability, as finding mechanical maintenance personnel in this time-space was impossible—elders would have to do it themselves—not to mention parts had to be shipped from Lingao. The simpler and more durable, the less after-sales service required. The mechanical system didn't have that many people for customer service.

Huang Tianyu brought several apprentices and a renovation team from the Lingao General Construction Company to Macau, finishing the installation in a week. Afterward, he did maintenance for old customers, replacing the gears and chain drives of animal and human-powered machines—the quality of old products was worrying. Since the Manufacturing Supervision Department spontaneously formed a "Product Reliability Office," new products showed much better durability.

The Ministry of Light Industry hoped to make big money from sanitary equipment, so they valued follow-up service highly—in an era where they could only provide expensive goods with poor reliability and low efficiency, failing to provide good after-sales service was commercial suicide.

Because Huang Shunlong had Embroidered Uniform Guard guests, he feared trouble if they bumped into Australians. He asked Huang Tianyu to come at night. After the watches started, Huang Tianyu quietly arrived at the Huang residence with his apprentices, carrying rattan chests full of tools and parts.

However, the equipment was located next door to Lin Ming's courtyard. Huang Tianyu never dreamed someone in the courtyard was still awake, and that person recognized him.

Li Yongxun quietly opened the moon gate and crept out along the wall. Not far down the corridor was a small open door, brightly lit, with banging sounds coming from inside. curious, she dared not peek directly at the door—the light would reveal her shadow. She carefully circled to the courtyard wall where there was a decorative openwork window and leaned in to peek.

A strange pavilion stood in the courtyard, visible even from their guest courtyard. It was tall, with flying eaves and upturned corners, windows on all sides, but she'd never seen them open. Li Yongxun initially thought it mysterious—Lin Ming said it was likely where Huang Shunlong monitored his guests. He also told her much about Huang Shunlong's "glorious history."

"This man has a sickness in his heart; being cautious everywhere is natural," Lin Ming had warned her. "Don't be a busybody."

Now she discovered this pavilion was very odd. The lower half was completely elevated on brick and stone pillars, with no stairs to go up. Instead, a black iron pipe-like object extended vertically from the ground into the bottom of the pavilion.

The iron pipe ran along the ground on brick piers into a bungalow at the other end of the courtyard. The house was unremarkable, doors and windows wide open, brightly lit inside. Several figures were busy inside, banging and hammering, though their activity was unclear.

Li Yongxun had learned some skills in stealth, wall-climbing, and tracking, but with her limited mobility, she could only widen her eyes to observe. Fortunately, the doors and windows were large and the light bright; she could barely make out strange machines inside. She remembered before Governor-General Wang's campaign against the bald ones, when Violet House in Guangzhou was raided, several Australian machines were confiscated. Idlers went to watch. She and her cousin also pestered her brother-in-law to take them to see. They looked similar to this.

"Hmph, Boss Huang has close dealings with the bald bandits," Li Yongxun thought. Just then, a seven-foot-tall man came out of the house, his long gown tucked into his waist, covered in oil stains. A young man quickly brought a large mug:

"Master, have some tea."

"Mm." The big man took the mug and gulped it down, wiping his mouth after setting it down. The light shone right on his face—Li Yongxun almost cried out: Who else but Manager Huang! He hadn't changed much, except for a hair bun on his head, probably to deceive people.

So this wretched medicine merchant who looked at her with lecherous eyes and threatened to strip her pants and spank her was actually a bald bandit! And a low-class artisan bandit at that! Hmph, now you've walked right into the trap! Li Yongxun smiled smugly: let's see who strips whose pants and spanks whom.

While she fantasized about how this wretched man would howl for mercy and weep under her ancestral court flogging techniques, she suddenly heard someone in the courtyard ask: "The pipes in the heater look good; maybe we don't need to change them?"

Huang Tianyu had no idea a girl on the other side of the wall wanted to strip his pants and coveted his buttocks. He returned the cup to his apprentice and strode back inside. Two apprentices were dismantling and inspecting the heater. He checked the serpentine water pipe—bronze was indeed more durable than cast iron, pity the source was scarce—he picked up a wrench, disassembled the pipe, looked, and shook his head:

"Still have to change it." He pointed at the thick layer of scale in the pipe and told the apprentices, "This is scale. Acculated scale will gradually block the pipe. At best, it causes insufficient hot water supply; if severe, the pipe could burst. This is just a general heater; if it were a boiler, scale could cause an explosion. So, always check for scale accumulation during maintenance."

The apprentices listened respectfully. One asked:

"Master, I checked the water here; it's clearly very clear. Where does this scale come from?"

"This is the question of 'hard water' and 'soft water.' As we discussed before: natural water contains various soluble minerals..."

"Liar. How can water be hard?" Li Yongxun thought to herself. "And soft water!"

"Change the heating pipe. We'll take this one back; maybe it can still be used after treatment." Huang Tianyu finished explaining minerals in water and instructed the apprentices to work. Disassembled parts were recycled as per regulation, not only for savings but also for the Reliability Office to analyze and improve quality.
