# Chapter 2178 - Heading to Guangning

Having become a National Army soldier and been drilled for two months, even his name was changed. Ai Buyi was originally called "Ai Yi." The Great Song official thought it sounded bad and insisted on changing it to "Buyi" (Cloth Clothes/Commoner). Just learning to write these two characters caused him quite a bit of suffering—how could it be as simple as the original single horizontal stroke?

From the moment he entered the training camp, Ai Buyi missed his wife and children at home, and for this, he received quite a bit of "loving education" from the sergeants. This time, the campaign departure was rushed; there wasn't even the customary day off. They went straight onto the ship, the whistle blew, and they were off. Ai Buyi wept on the ship. This time, the company sergeant didn't beat him; instead, he handed him a cigarette and patted him on the shoulder in a friendly manner.

The ship moved and stopped, dawdling for several days. Ai Buyi was dizzy and disoriented, having long lost track of where he was being taken. Fortunately, there was no shortage of food and drink along the way, and no need for daily drilling. He just watched the river surface and the scenery on both banks every day, or otherwise fell asleep. Waking up to see a cabin full of soldiers and weapons, he felt incredibly depressed. Sometimes he thought about simply jumping into the river to end it all—it was said that someone had actually done so.

"All assemble!" With the piercing sound of whistles and the shouting of squad leaders, Ai Buyi stood up reflexively and ran to the assembly point.

"Form ranks!" "Count off!" "All check equipment!"

After a flurry of orders and bustle, Li Dong arrived in front of the formation and spot-checked the soldiers' equipment. With so many new recruits, forgetfulness was inevitable.

"All units proceed to Pier 4," Li Dong ordered after finishing the inspection. "Prepare to board!"

Because there weren't enough ships to transport the entire army at once, the troops departed in batches. The entire detachment would assemble at Guangning.

The fleet, towed by tugboats, first returned east from Zhaoqing to Sanshui, entered the North River, then turned north from the North River into the Sui River. The navigation was very smooth. Soon they arrived at Sihui.

Although the navigability of the Sui River couldn't compare to the main channel of the West River, it was more than enough for *Dafa* boats. In addition to the dozen or so *Dafa* boats carrying troops, there were also several requisitioned civilian boats accompanying them, carrying naturalized cadres and supplies to take over the county administration of Lianshan.

Sihui was a plains county. It had been taken over earlier and was not far from Sanshui, classifying it as a "security area." The troops rested here for a day before proceeding to Guangning.

Going north along the Sui River from Sihui led to the border of Guangning County.

Guangning was a mountainous county where Han and Yao people lived intermingled. Its establishment as a county was the result of pacifying the Yao area of Daluo Mountain in Qingyuan County during the Jiajing reign. After Daluo Mountain was pacified, four *du* (administrative divisions) bordering Sihui County and Qingyuan County were carved out to create the new Guangning County.

Although there were no longer Yao districts in this county by the late Ming, there were quite a few scattered registered Yao residents. It also bordered the Yao area of Qingyuan County. Originally, conflicts between Han and Yao were not uncommon, mixed with contradictions between both sides and the *Lang* troops recruited from Guangxi to "suppress the Yao." As the Leviathan of the government crashed to the ground, rebellions rose everywhere, and the environment inside the county was quite complex.

This county currently still belonged to the "quasi-security area." Not long ago, a naturalized citizen director and a National Army county squadron had just been sent to take over defense. The county seat and several major towns remained roughly stable, and transportation lines were smooth. However, bandit activity had increased significantly since early May, making it extremely unsafe to operate in the countryside. Because going to the countryside was extremely prone to attacks, retained personnel and naturalized cadres had to be escorted by armed force to handle affairs. In reality, this "quasi-security area" was already quite chaotic. Recently, there was even intelligence claiming that local gentry in Guangning were openly raising the banner of "serving the King" and pulling together teams to openly oppose the Senate. News just came a few days ago: a large group of unidentified armed men had gathered near Shijian, intending to take the town in one fell swoop.

Whether by water or land, Shijian was the only way to go from Sihui to Guangning. Convenient transportation had created a commercial market town. Therefore, the newly appointed Guangning County Director had stationed a squad of National Army soldiers here to train militia and maintain local and surrounding security.

This news caused tension on all sides because Shijian was a vital communication line connecting Guangning to Sihui. If bandits wanted to seize this place, it was hard to guarantee they didn't intend to "close the door to beat the dog" and attack Guangning.

"No, I don't think the enemy has that intention," Li Dong said. "They are just greedy and want to hit a rich target."

Shijian had many merchants. Besides silver and money, the materials and commodities stranded there due to the war were enough for them to loot extensively.

"How do you know?" asked Yang Zeng, commander of the detachment.

"Bandits are not government soldiers; they lack both political intent and strategic concepts. They are after the immediate benefits in front of their eyes," Li Dong said with confidence. "Once a transportation hub like this is taken, it will inevitably attract a counterattack. Bandits are unwilling to fight such hard battles that consume their strength—they simply saw that Shijian currently has few troops, or there was some opportunity to exploit internally, and wanted to gather together to pull off a big job."

Although judging that the bandits had no intention of "closing the door to beat the dog," once Shijian fell, it would cause serious damage to the lives and property of the people. So Yang Zeng decided to send the 2nd Company to land and take the land route straight to Shijian to lift the siege as quickly as possible. Li Dong's squadron would coordinate with their action. The rest of the troops and baggage would continue to advance by boat.

It was already early summer, and heavy greenery covered the hills.

A column of soldiers wearing gray uniforms and carrying rifles was marching on a winding mountain path amidst this verdant scenery.

Although their steps were brisk, everyone's load was actually quite heavy: backpacks and steel helmets piled up like a small mountain on everyone's back—it was just that they had been marching by boat before, rested enough on the boat, and rested again in Sihui, so their leg strength was still sufficient.

Serving as the vanguard were the soldiers of the 1st Platoon, 2nd Company, 10th Battalion of the Fubo Army. A few days ago, their platoon leader fell ill and entered the infirmary. The one serving as the new platoon leader was none other than Staff Sergeant Li Gangsheng, who had just made military achievements in the Battle of Guangzhou. Rumor had it that after this battle ended, he would report to the military academy and come out as an officer. Many people were envious of this. Some also said he had dog-shit luck: throughout the entire Guangzhou Liberation Campaign, whether local government officials or the Ming garrison, most surrendered at the mere sight of the wind or were settled by a proclamation. Often, the defenders opened the city and surrendered before the troops even arrived. There were very few battles with actual exchanges of fire. Opportunities to earn combat merit were even rarer.

Guangning was embraced by mountains; most of the county was mountainous and hilly, with large and small valleys scattered among mountain streams. The climate here was warm and humid, with abundant rainfall, and general verdure covered the mountains. Tender green and goose-yellow leaves sprouted from tree trunks. The newly awakened earth exuded the enticing fragrance of soil.

On the hillsides, cultivated fields could be seen; some were tea plantations, some were paddy fields, but regardless of the type of field, they were unattended. Of the villages passed, some had already been abandoned, and the rest were in a posture of strict defense. Whenever the troops approached, the sound of conch shells and drums would ring out, warning the village braves that outsiders were approaching.

There was a lot of rain in the early summer season, and the mountain roads were muddy and difficult. It was quite arduous for the soldiers to trek. Although the road was not easy to walk, the morale of the troops was good. Having won victory after victory, the young men's spirits were high. It seemed no difficulty applied to them. Those county seats simply dared not resist the resounding military might of the Fubo Army. The provincial capital of Guangzhou fell in a day; what good were these county seats? One messenger, or at most setting up the mountain howitzers to fire two shots, and they all surrendered one by one. Moreover, Guangning was in the hands of their own troops; there was no need to use knives and guns at all. The only thing to watch out for was bandits on the road.

Everyone had eaten their fill of salted cold rice balls supplied by the military station before breaking camp in the morning, so now was the time when their legs had strength. Li Gangsheng held a sour plum in his mouth—this thing was so sour his teeth almost fell out, but with it in his mouth, he didn't feel much desire to drink water.

The 1st Platoon sent out point men according to regulations. Two point men carrying Minié rifles vigilantly watched the movement on both sides of the mountain road. Tens of meters behind was the entire infantry platoon in a single-file marching column. Li Gangsheng himself was in the center of the formation.

While this small squad of infantry was advancing westward along the tributary of the Sui River, deep in the dense forest, Yang Juren was preparing an ambush with his regiment braves. He had brought a full three hundred men this time, all village braves and regiment militia. Among them were nearly two hundred young and strong men, many equipped with armor and firearms. Such well-equipped regiment braves were probably unique in Guangning. But his confidence came more from his nephew, Yang Erhu, who stood behind him with a "Tiger Crouch" cannon.

In these years of unstable times, Master Yang, well-read in history books, knew deeply that the most essential thing in troubled times was to have soldiers and grain. He had land, tenant farmers, and long-term laborers. As long as there were no consecutive disasters, there would always be grain. But without force as a backing, no matter how much grain there was, one was just a big fat sheep. Moreover, without force, what if his own tenant farmers and laborers caused trouble first? The few dozen regiment guards he had now probably wouldn't be able to suppress them.

After thinking it over again and again, Yang Juren thought of his ne'er-do-well nephew, Yang Erhu. Yang Erhu was his brother's son. He didn't like studying since childhood but liked to dance with spears and clubs. He learned martial arts from a master and tempered a good body, acquiring good skills in fist and staff. So Yang Juren spent money to buy him the titles of military licentiate and military provincial graduate all the way, and used money to fill a vacancy for him in the Zhaoqing Battalion, becoming a small infantry chiliarch.

Yang Erhu serving as an officer in Zhaoqing was naturally not to defend the country. Master Yang had instructed him clearly: first, the Yang family would have a backer in officialdom; second, get close to the brothers around him so that in case of any mishaps, he could pull up a team.

"Don't covet money. How much money can you make being this grunt officer? I have plenty of money. You just hold onto the soldiers tight—in troubled times, having soldiers makes you a 'Grass King'—our Yang family doesn't seek to be Grass Kings, but if you can bring a capable team to the family, the family can protect itself! Maybe we can even fish for great benefits in these troubled times!" Master Yang laughed. "At that time, the future for you and our Yang family will be immeasurable..."
