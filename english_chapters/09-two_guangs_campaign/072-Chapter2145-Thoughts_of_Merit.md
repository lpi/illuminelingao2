# Chapter 2145 - Thoughts of Merit

However, this system had not been implemented for long, and after a few years, the Earth God Shrine was only used to "worship the Earth God." For Xie Erren, this was a readily available empty room. The conditions were much better than the main prison, and it was directly opposite the main prison, which counted as preferential treatment without being too excessive.

Hearing this, Zhao Fengtian felt it was inappropriate and immediately said, "Chief! This isn't quite suitable. This woman intended to assassinate a Senator, which is a capital offense by law. Even if you want to show mercy outside the law and give her a fair chance, she should be sent back to Guangzhou and handed over to the South China Army Court Martial for trial and disposal."

Xie Erren was somewhat displeased: "Where do we have the spare capacity to send her back to Guangzhou now? Just detain her in the Earth God Shrine first."

Zhao Fengtian opened his mouth, wanting to say that even so, she could be sent to the captive team for custody, but seeing Xie Erren's bad expression, he stopped making a sound.

The bailiffs were the cleverest of all. The prison head already "understood" the "Chief's" thoughts and immediately shouted, "Girl, kowtow and thank the Master for his grace!"

While Cai Lan was still in a daze, Xie Erren had already stood up, his face slightly hot. He felt that everyone around him had seen through his thoughts—he didn't want to leave an impression of "being lustful" on the natives, so he said, "I still have things to do. Although the place is changed, she is still a prisoner and must be strictly guarded—no abuse is allowed."

After saying that, he hurriedly took his people and left. The jailers knew that the Master had an interest in this female prisoner, so they immediately changed their faces. With smiles all over their faces, the jailers helped Cai Lan up, said a few auspicious words congratulating the girl on "escaping the sea of bitterness," and respectfully sent Cai Lan out.

A superior speaks a sentence; subordinates run until their legs break. The jailers immediately started to arrange things. In less than an hour, Cai Lan changed from a "cheap wretch" waiting for death in death row to "Miss Cai." The prison head rejoiced secretly; fortunately, this Master came in time! Otherwise, by nightfall, this woman would inevitably have been ruined by the jailers, and then it would be hard to explain!

The prison head instructed people to prepare a bed and bedding in the Earth God Shrine on one hand, and on the other hand, he called the official matchmaker from the county—this official matchmaker was equivalent to half a female jailer; usually, matters involving female prisoners were handled by her—gave her a packet of疮 medicine, and asked her to apply it to Cai Lan.

"The Australian Master has his eyes on this woman, you must serve her carefully," the prison head instructed.

Since being arrested into the heavy prison, Cai Lan had first taken a beating of "killer batons," then was locked onto a urine bucket, with cangues on both hands and feet. Coming from a well-off family, how could she have suffered such misery? She was already withered after a round of torture. She asked herself that after failing to assassinate the bald thief official, she would undoubtedly die. Now this bald thief official not only didn't pursue it but also moved her out of the prison and gave her preferential treatment, just like dreaming. In her daze, she lost her bearings.

"Lift..."

With the shout of the headman, eight bearers exerted force together and lifted the coffin in the central hall. A few monks and Taoist priests also yawned, packed up their tools, and began to disperse. A few of Qiuchan's relatives who came to help also began to busy themselves packing up things.

Because of the turmoil of war, Qiuchan's husband's funeral ended after only the first seven days. Because his origin was in Teng County and he was young, no auspicious land had been purchased locally. In the chaos of war, it was impossible to hire a feng shui master to select a site, so they could only temporarily store it in a temple. Wait until the roads were peaceful before escorting the coffin back home for burial.

The mourners who came were mostly local relatives and friends—in these times, even entering the city from the countryside once was unsafe. A distant relative of Qiuchan came into the city to mourn, but encountered bandits not far from the city. All his clothes were stripped off, and he arrived at the door wearing only a pair of shorts. according to him, he knelt and begged bitterly, saying he was a guest for mourning and killing him would be inauspicious, so the bandits didn't take his life.

The relatives and friends who came to offer condolences kowtowed and offered incense. Inevitably, they had to sit down to drink a few mouthfuls of tea and chat a few words with Hao Ran, who was acting as the "receptionist"—no one knew this distant cousin of Qiuchan's husband, but Qiuchan's husband's family was an old and large clan in Teng County with many relatives, so not knowing him was nothing unusual. Moreover, this "cousin" was a returned traveler who had traveled far, was knowledgeable, and spoke well, so everyone was willing to chat with him.

Relatives and friends all said that the world was really broken, and naturally, some people secretly cursed the bald thieves a few times—it was true: if the bald thieves hadn't fought their way to Wuzhou, Wuzhou wouldn't have suffered military disaster, Qiuchan's husband wouldn't have died, and the rural relative wouldn't have suffered the misfortune of being stripped of clothes.

Once this was said, it inevitably led to some discussion. Most of Qiuchan's natal relatives were locals of Wuzhou, engaging in both business and farming, basically middle-class families with some small property. This passing of soldiers, just the great chaos when Xiong Wencan left, caused many families to lose their property and homes. Even for those who were safe in person and property, the days of fear and trembling were not fit for humans.

"Well, the Australians fly the banner of consoling the people and punishing the wicked, saying they are 'seeking welfare for the people.' After entering Wuzhou city, they said nothing but came up with a 'reasonable burden' first. As long as it is a shop, it has to pay! The Rehabilitation Bureau is forcing every shop to open for business now—there isn't even a ghost on the street in broad daylight; who do we sell the goods to if we open the shop?"

"Even the beggars have been arrested—it's good they were arrested, saving us from having to give alms when business isn't oping!"

"Beggars are easy to dismiss; this Rehabilitation Bureau is the difficult one to deal with!" A middle-aged man sighed. "One 'reasonable burden' asking everyone to share the payment, another 'strengthening security' asking every Paijia to provide able-bodied men... Now they want to repair the pontoon bridge—repairing the bridge is of course a good thing, but this matter requires us to contribute money and effort again."

"Since the 'Recovery,' not a single boat of goods from Guangxi has come down! Grain only goes out and doesn't come in—they said they would transport it from Guangzhou, but we haven't seen a single boat of rice yet! On the contrary, every grain shop is assigned the duty of supplying military rice!" This was a relative who opened a rice shop. "They also issued a price limit order, forbidding price increases! Well, it's just short of open robbery!"

"Viceroy Xiong of the Great Ming wanted us to supply military rice; here comes the Australian Chief Xie, also wanting us to supply military rice... Anyway, the common people are just fish and meat!"

"They say they want us to go out and traffic goods to 'invigorate the economy'... This Great Master is truly ignorant of worldly affairs—now it is chaos and war: there are bandits making trouble just out of the city. Walking along the river: Guangxi is the territory of the Great Ming; their goods can't come, and ours can't go over. If we go downstream, we heard that the Yao people in the caves are rebelling these days. Even boatmen dare not go without the escort of Australian gunboats. Going out to traffic goods is truly seeking one's own death!"

Yi Haoran listened to the guests' discussions while echoing them. He hadn't gone out much these days, nor for long. However, what he saw with his own eyes was that the Australians were extremely efficient. In just a few days, collecting corpses, clearing ruins, relieving refugees, repairing city walls... piece by piece, they had already started. There were no beggars or refugees on the streets, nor abandoned corpses. Order on the streets had returned to normal. Although shops had few customers, saying "not even a ghost" was an exaggeration; at least businesses involving people's livelihood still had business. Even the security in the suburbs didn't seem so unbearable: there were already farmers selling vegetables on the streets.

By the standards of the Great Ming, this Master Xie could already be considered a "capable official" among local officials.

Yi Haoran was extremely repulsed by the bald thieves, but he also had to admit: the bald thieves indeed had a set of methods in governance.

Since hiding in Qiuchan's home, Yi Haoran had no long-term plans. He only sought to muddle through the bald thieves' arrest and immediately set off west when the situation calmed down slightly and the roads were clear. Lord Xiong's place was probably no good—the Emperor would absolutely not forgive the crime of losing Guangdong. But as long as he was not under the rule of the bald thieves, anything was fine; he would more or less still have a chance.

However, the unintentional conversation of these people right now made him see an opportunity he could exploit.

In these few days, he had generally learned that the Australians failed to capture the entire territory of Wuzhou due to the Yao cave rebellion—not only that, but the main army had also withdrawn from Wuzhou, leaving only a small amount of troops. Therefore, several counties leading to Guangxi had not been taken. The government troops were still defending Teng County, and it was said that Xiong Wencan was also there.

From Guangxi to the capital, the journey was long. From receiving the defeat report to issuing the decree to arrest Xiong Wencan, the document transmission would take at least one or two months. Within this time, Xiong Wencan was still the Viceroy of Liangguang.

To save himself, Xiong Wencan would inevitably plan a counterattack deliberately—as long as he figured out the situation in the city and contacted Viceroy Xiong in time, the government troops still had a chance!

Now the troops in Wuzhou city were empty, and people's hearts were unstable. The bald thieves had the Yao people rebelling in the rear to constrain them. It was a great opportunity for a counterattack. Moreover, at this moment, Lord Xiong was eager to earn merit to atone for his crimes, so he wouldn't be so hesitant in strategy.

As long as he could incite some bailiffs and commoners in the city to "revolt," seize a city gate, and guide the government troops into the city, with that small number of men and horses of the bald thieves, even if their combat power was strong, they could only withdraw from the city first. It would be even better if he could capture or behead the Real Bald Senator Xie.

Wuzhou was an important gateway to Liangguang. If the government troops recaptured Wuzhou in one fell swoop, the bald thieves would have no foothold in this area and could only retreat east along the West River to Fengchuan County. trapped in the melee with the Yao people—once this Yao chaos started, it wouldn't subside without three or five years. As time went on, the situation might change! He would have established a peerless merit!

Thinking of this, Yi Haoran couldn't help but feel hot all over, wishing he could immediately go to the street to collect various news about the bald thieves and contact comrades from all sides to raise the righteousness flag together.

"Mr. Hao, your face is flushed. Have you been overworked these days?"

Yi Haoran was startled and hurriedly suppressed the excitement in his heart, covering up: "I indeed haven't slept well these days." He deliberately sighed again, "Thinking that I have traveled for many years and originally wanted to return to my hometown to live a few days of peaceful life, how could I expect it to be such a chaos of war!"

"Sir is right. In these years, there is not a single peaceful place in the world!" Someone also had the same emotion. "The Great Ming is in danger!"
