# Chapter 2343 - Personnel Adjustment

Zhao Manxiong narrowed his eyes, saying after a half while: "I see we have no choice, must do it in one step: Let key figures fully understand our goodwill, know the benefits of mutual cooperation. Other people with ulterior motives sowing dissension can't stir up waves anymore."

His subordinates looked at him with surprise, seeming not to believe.

"You are asking a tiger for its skin." You Guotuan shouted.

"Not so far, at most can be counted as a pinch of fur." Zhao Manxiong said, "Giving a reminder at critical moment is beneficial to us all."

"Director Zhao, is this matter reliable?"

"To me it's very simple. I," he looked around, "am also a Senator. Not Hoover, nor Beria. And him? Neither Roosevelt, Truman nor Stalin or Khrushchev. If he is smart enough, should understand my meaning."

Zhou Botao immediately understood his meaning. He was slightly excited: "I understand. If really tearing face skin to knock down Pol-Sec Bureau, we can also go the opposite way. NND (Damn it), you know how to manipulate public opinion, we don't?"

"Sacred power entrusted to Senators by the Senate, isn't it a pity not to use?" You Guotuan laughed, "We are staying in Lushan for long, eyes blinded (cannot see the true face of mountain)!"

"Our Director Zhao still sees very clearly." Wu Fo threw a flatter, but he was still relatively prudent, "But our power isn't big enough."

"Strong and weak can be transformed. After all things are in constant development and change." Zhao Manxiong said, "Of course, I personally extremely don't wish to walk to this step. After all we are riding on the same boat, doing the common cause, just different views and political opinions. Some contradictions better not be expanded."

He muttered to himself for a moment and said: "I have one more thing, want to notify everyone. Considering current situation, our personnel needs an adjustment."

Three Section Chiefs looked at him somewhat nervously.

"I consider, my personal resume is probably the object of some people's dread. Although I never worked in strong power organs. But my major and research direction probably make people generate many associations. I didn't consider this point in the past." He smiled slightly, "They all call us Cosplay Masters, but in heart don't think so."

"You want to resign?" Several people shouted out simultaneously. Wu Fo rushed to say: "You are the core of our department!"

For a time the conference room was full of voices of "The King cannot leave".

"No, no, I don't intend to resign, nor will leave Pol-Sec Bureau." Zhao Manxiong said, "I just consider our current situation, still have to do some things making Senators reassured. So I consider doing some, adjustment, to the Bureau's personnel."

"We absolutely support any adjustment you make." Three people immediately stated stance.

"Fine. Considering outside has an impression of 'monolithic block' on our department. I personally also feel there is such a trend. Now since there is a decision to strengthen local branches of Pol-Sec system. Preparing to arrange comrades to go to local sub-bureaus to serve as Directors—Wu Fo stay, you do technology, going to local place has no big space to display, better stay in General Bureau. Of course I am also asking for opinions."

"I have no opinion." Wu Fo wasn't interested in being dispatched to be Director, answering immediately.

"We have no opinion either."

"Fine, You Guotuan, you are counted as the youngest in our bureau besides Comrade Wu Mu. The Senate prepares to designate Foshan as experimental field, letting kids (2nd gen/young Senators) toss about..." Zhao Manxiong said, "Originally Pol-Sec system prepared to hand over to a certain one among them, but the Senate thought doing so was too assuming (trusting/risky). So want us to select and dispatch a Senator to serve as Foshan Sub-Bureau Director. I looked, You Guotuan you are the youngest among us, and have rich experience. Suitable for this position."

"This is a good job of carrying sedan chair." You Guotuan laughed.

"Good if say good, bad if say bad. Foshan's situation is second only to Guangzhou in complexity in whole Guangdong. The Senate has great expectations for there; kids themselves also have political opinion divergences. Probably there will be many contradictions in specific administration." Zhao Manxiong said, "You must remember, you go for escorting (protecting), first must guarantee kids' absolute safety; second give more suggestions on business, handing decisive things to the other party to do. This is training for them. Third must act according to regulations!"

"I understand." You Guotuan nodded solemnly.

"As for Comrade Zhou Botao, your task is going to Wuzhou, later also responsible for managing Pol-Sec work in Guangxi aspect. To be honest, your difficulty is biggest. Because that place Guangxi, even extensive management like Great Ming had great deficiency. You going to take charge of Guangxi work, probably will have great difficulty."

Although he said difficulty, this also meant he was promoted to a Regional Level Pol-Sec position. Zhou Botao naturally understood Zhao Manxiong's meaning; going to Wuzhou had heavy responsibility, but boundless prospects. Whether able to master it depended entirely on his ability.

Zhou Botao was steady by nature, nodding silently.

"Then is adjustment inside our Bureau. Obviously, we have to introduce some outsiders who won't make comrades feel unsteady when sleeping to serve important positions..."

"Whom do you plan to choose? Not a Senator in the Bureau?" You Guotuan was very worried about the Bureau's future; hearing about introducing outsider, asked immediately.

"Comrade Guo Yi."

Zhao Manxiong had been calculating this abacus for a stage—precisely speaking, before Liangguang Strategy started, after learning news that Guo Yi wouldn't stay in Guangzhou but would have other appointment, he had such a plan.

Senators' certain dread of him personally, this was a problem he couldn't solve. The only way was introducing people who could make them feel at ease to the Bureau to serve positions. This was a very hard to choose candidate. First, he must make all sides at ease; second, he must have certain professional ability, at least behaving "capable", to make others produce the feeling that this person could "check and balance" him.

The first candidate in his heart originally was Ji Xin. His "indisputable with the world" and detached attitude having no entanglement with all aspects had deep impression among Senators, a candidate acceptable to all sides. He was responsible for thorny case investigation work many times, himself from legal background, could be counted as "professional personnel". And he had private conversations with Ji Xin many times, believing this person had sufficient public heart, completely could cooperate.

He considered asking Ma Jia to resign, yielding the position of Chief Director to Ji Xin to serve. But he considered once Ma Jia left office, his most direct supporter in high level would lose pivot point. Ma Jia was a very good leader, not only holding powerful political resources sufficient to shelter Pol-Sec Bureau from wind and rain, but also important intermediary for his contact with high level. If he lost the title of "Director", many things in the future would be hard to open mouth.

After thinking again and again, he gave up the candidate Ji Xin. Turned gaze to Guo Yi.

If speaking of profession solely, then in whole Senate Guo Yi was the most professional Senator. However, after D-Day, he consistently did business work irrelevant to his own profession.

First he was professional enough, absolutely would leave deep impression on people; second, he was an independent person, like Ming Lang, a thorough outsider; and in Guangzhou for many years, having no power in Lingao. Cautious and timid usually, impression left on everyone was quite good. In other words, a person acceptable by all sides.

"He is a suitable person, surely nothing to say on profession." Wu Fo said somewhat worriedly, "But haven't given him contact with profession for many years, now we propose, Senate public opinion..."

"Comrade Guo Yi has been in Guangzhou for many years, proved his loyalty long ago." Zhao Manxiong said, "Impression he left on everyone is also quite good. So I nominate him to succeed Pol-Sec Bureau serving as Second Deputy Director concurrent Reconnaissance Section Chief, high probability can get passed."

"Letting him be Second Deputy Director?" Zhou Botao was somewhat uneasy, "Is this rising too fast?! Can the Senate agree?"

"His rank and seniority in the Senate are completely enough. Besides, if he cannot be Deputy Director, it won't play the function of making some people reassured."

"I understand."

"As for Action Section Chief, I consider asking Comrade Zhou Dongtian to serve. He actually counts as a professional too. Of course direction is not quite same as ours. Has long-term cooperative relationship with us and National Police."

This candidate could be accepted by all sides, and also played the role of contacting National Police. Key was he had long-term cooperative relatinoship with Pol-Sec Bureau; after joining there wouldn't be obstacles in cooperation. Everyone had no objection.

"Finally, our Office Director post has been vacant ever since Comrade Wu Mu went to Guangzhou. This post shouldn't be vacant for long, so I consider letting Comrade Chen Baibin serve. He performed very outstandingly in Wuzhou Incident investigation work recently."

Chen Baibin actually participated in investigation work many times. This time going to investigate Wuzhou Incident with Ji Xin, established friendship with Ji Xin, joined Indigenous Protection Association after returning. Although he counted as "old person" of Pol-Sec Bureau too, Zhao Manxiong's flaire was little, instead Ji Xin's color was relatively more. Having him serve this key post was equivalent to indirectly establishing certain association with Ji Xin.

Next he made some "oral arrangements" regarding next step work. After everything arranged properly and attendees dispersed, he picked up the handset, cranked a few times:

"I am Zhao Manxiong, please connect Comrade Xiao Zishan of Senate General Office."

He waited silently for a few minutes; call connected.

"Comrade Director, I am Zhao Manxiong, I have a matter needing your help."

Unknown what Xiao Zishan said in the phone, Zhao Manxiong smiled slightly, saying: "You worried too much. It is like this, I want to ask you to help me arrange a meeting..."
