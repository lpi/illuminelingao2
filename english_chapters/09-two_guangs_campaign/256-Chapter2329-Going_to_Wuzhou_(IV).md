# Chapter 2329 - Going to Wuzhou (IV)

"The next one is this Jiang Suo." Chen Baibin picked up the interrogation record, "Doesn't look like much juice, just a reckless big soldier."

"Jiang Suo..." Ji Xin murmured, "Such a familiar name. I always feel like I've seen it somewhere."

"A generic name." Chen Baibin said, "You can meet several in a month in the purification camp."

"Jiang Suo! Get up, a Lord wants to interrogate you." The retained jailer shook the shackles in his hand listlessly.

Jiang Suo climbed up from the straw mat. He sustained quite a few injuries during the fierce battle, but mostly superficial flesh wounds, nothing serious. He wasn't tortured in the cell either. He had already recovered quite a bit.

This was his second time being a captive of the Australians. Knowing the Australians didn't abuse captives, and having also harbored a heart determined to die, he ate well and slept soundly in prison, feeling quite at peace.

Hearing he was to be arraigned now, Jiang Suo was also very calm, only asking casually: "Wasn't I already interrogated?"

"New Australian Lords have been sent from Guangzhou," the jailer knew he was a tough guy, and was also polite in his speech, "You have big face this time. When you go to the execution ground it's enough to shout a few times." Saying that, he cupped his hands again: "Hero, pardon the offense." Then he put shackles and handcuffs on him.

Unlike Yi Haoran, Jiang Suo came from a military background and was young and strong. Zheng Ergen couldn't help but be wary.

Jiang Suo was detained in the county prison, just a few steps from the rear hall of the county yamen. Dragging foot shackles and handcuffs, he arrived in a few minutes. The moment he stepped into the rear hall, his eyes suddenly widened.

The bandit chief he thought about day and night over these years, who appeared in his nightmares every night, was actually sitting in the hall!

Although many years had passed, Jiang Suo still remembered the appearance of this man interrogating everyone in the troupe in the hall back then: a fair-skinned, elegant-mannered middle-aged man with a compassionate expression. Every time he asked questions, he let them finish speaking, neither interrupting nor scolding them. Only at the end of the interrogation did he say they were "muddled".

Everyone in the troupe originally thought with his attitude, the worst would probably be a few dozen beatings with a board each, and wearing a cangue for ten days or half a month. Unexpectedly, the judgment waiting for them turned out to be the execution of Senior Sister, and exile for others.

Jiang Suo would never forget the scene when Senior Sister was taken out of the cell by two bandit soldiers that day: Master cried out his daughter's name sorrowfully in the cell. Senior Sister's eyes were closed tight, but tears couldn't stop rolling down in strings. Only when she was about to leave the cell did she scream heartbreakingly, "Dad!"

This sound "Dad" woke him up from nightmares every midnight—he knew Senior Sister died unjustly, died wrongly. All her nostalgia and reluctance for the human world turned into this one word.

He never imagined that this man with kind eyebrows and pleasant eyes, who spoke gently and reasonably, was actually so ruthless and cruel.

What fault did Senior Sister have? Just to survive, she ate Master Luo's rice for a few days. When he was in Hainan, the bandits said every day they were "the direction of the people's hearts" and the campaign against the Great Ming was to "console the people and punish the guilty". But what did the common people count as? It was still the same using common people's heads to kill the chicken to scare the monkey.

"What are you dazing for? Quick, go in!" The bailiff behind pushed him.

Ji Xin didn't recognize him. He and Jiang Suo had only met once or twice in the public hall. And as a judge at that time, examining up to a hundred or at least dozens of captives and criminals every day, it was impossible to remember every face. Furthermore, Jiang Suo was just a unripe young lad back then. After years of exile and labor, his appearance had changed greatly.

"You are Jiang Suo?"

"It is me."

Chen Baibin asked a few more sentences about the content of the confession. Jiang Suo answered one by one without error. What Chen Baibin cared about most was how he mobilized the troops. Jiang Suo didn't hide this point either, telling how he contacted Song Ming and others, and how he met "Mr. Gou" and other things one by one.

"Mr. Gou?" Ji Xin suddenly interrupted, "You mean Gou Xunli?"

"Seem to be called this name." Jiang Suo was somewhat surprised. *Could this surnamed Gou also be an old acquaintance of the bandits?*

"Alright, so he's still alive." Chen Baibin certainly knew about Second Master Gou, famous in the Senate, "He really can bounce around."

"Don't mention it, he almost succeeded this time." Ji Xin looked at this young man with disheveled hair and untidy clothes in front of him, feeling somewhat familiar, but couldn't say it. He noticed the other party's gaze staring straight at him, completely without the flinching and avoidant eyes of general captives and indigenous commoners.

*This person has quite a guts, seems to be a desperado.* Ji Xin thought.

Judging from the summary of confessions from all sides, the civil leader of this riot was Yi Haoran, and the military leader was Song Ming—prisoners said this person had escaped—but this Jiang Suo was an out-and-out number two figure. More useful information should be obtained from his mouth.

Ji Xin opened his mouth and asked: "According to the confession, you said you were Xiong Wencan's family retainer—Xiong Wencan is from Guizhou, you are from Henan, how did you cast yourself under his door to be a retainer?"

"Hometown suffered flood and drought, nothing to eat. A few years ago I followed people to Guangdong to sell performing arts for a living."

"Since selling arts, how did you become a soldier again?"

Jiang Suo smiled strangely: "That year running around the docks in Guangzhou selling arts, just encountered you guys landing and harassing. The troupe suffered military disaster, dead died, fled fled, only left me alone. With no way out, I became a soldier to mix a mouthful of rice to eat. Later got Governor Xiong's appreciation, first became a retainer, then promoted to squad leader..."

"Wuzhou city broke, Xiong Wencan's retainers mostly routed at Bangshan. How did you collect the remnants and how did you lurk down?" Ji Xin asked, "And how did Yi Haoran contact you?"

"This matter naturally has inside information." Jiang Suo said, "Don't know if this lowly person says it out, can you spare my life?"

"If you can have meritorious performance, naturally punishment can be reduced by one degree." Ji Xin said.

"Give me paper and pen, I will write it out."

"You are literate?"

"When lowly person was young, read a few years of private school, recognize a few characters."

Chen Baibin scolded: "You cut the act of playing god and ghost, just say if you have words!"

"Lowly one is clumsy with mouth, speaking up afraid of mistakes. Better write it out." Jiang Suo said, "Besides this matter concerns the Senate Standing Committee. There are many ears and eyes here. saying it out if heard by people, afraid lowly person's life cannot be kept."

Hearing this, Ji Xin and Chen Baibin were both shocked. This Jiang Suo opened his mouth with heavy news. "Concerns the Senate Standing Committee", the weight of these few words was too heavy. Don't look at them hanging the words "Senate" on their lips every day, but the indigenous people of the Ming State mostly had no concept of "Senate". Many people only knew "Bandit thieves", "Bandit people", at most knew an "Australians". Those who formally knew "Senate", probably one in ten thousand. Let alone "Standing Committee"—even among naturalized citizens in Lingao, few knew this name. This person actually said it as soon as he opened his mouth.

Thinking again that captives confessed Jiang Suo, although merely a trivial squad leader, commanded Xiong Wencan's most elite retainer team, obviously one of Xiong's trusted aides...

*Could it be this Wuzhou Incident, behind it there are still certain invisible hands manipulating?* The two instantly became nervous. Speaking of which, this Wuzhou Incident indeed made people feel somewhat fishy. Ji Xin and Chen Baibin knew that Wuzhou having an accident might not be a bad thing for certain people in the Senate.

*Could it be...*

Neither dared to say the words. Chen Baibin said: "Since so, give you paper and pen." Saying that, he asked someone to bring the Four Treasures of the Study, and instructed the bailiff to remove Jiang Suo's handcuffs.

The chest board in front of the interrogation chair was quite wide and could originally be used as a small table. Removing handcuffs allowed writing.

Seeing Jiang Suo pick up the pen and start writing, Ji Xin ordered the bailiffs and jailers in the rear hall to retreat to the courtyard temporarily, to avoid letting them see what Jiang Suo was writing.

"You wait under the eaves for instructions."

"Director Ji, what will this Jiang Suo write out?" Chen Baibin was young after all, somewhat unable to hold his breath.

"Hard to say. But he is just a mere squad leader, what can he know? More likely it's a bluff, wanting to live by writing nonsense." Ji Xin said, "Ignore this, just let him write. At worst waste a few pages of paper."

Seeing Jiang Suo writing swiftly, soon he filled a page of paper. After blowing it dry, he folded it and sighed: "Finished writing."

Ji Xin was afraid there was something critical in this confession. If it really involved some secrets within the Senate, that wouldn't be a problem of internal strife—the nature would probably be a hundred times more serious!

He didn't summon the bailiffs under the eaves to take it, but got up directly and walked over, personally picking up the confession.

Jiang Suo suddenly exploded, grabbing Ji Xin with one hand, and holding the brush shaft with the other hand, stabbing fiercely towards Ji Xin's eyes.

Ji Xin was shocked and wanted to dodge, but his arm was tightly grabbed by Jiang Suo, motionless like an iron hoop. Seeing the black brush tip coming towards his eyes, Ji Xin in urgency could only tilt his head back to avoid its sharp edge.

Fortunately, Jiang Suo only had his hands uncuffed; below the waist was still restrained by instruments of restraint. The chair was fixed to the ground again. Relying only on the sudden thrust of both hands, the range was extremely small. Ji Xin dodged the brush shaft with a backward tilt, only heavily stabbed on the corner of the mouth, feeling a burst of sharp pain, salty and sweet in the mouth, bleeding immediately.

Chen Baibin was stunned for a moment. Seeing Ji Xin bleeding from the face, he reacted, shouting "Someone come!", jumped up himself, grabbed a bench casually and rushed up, smashing the bench on Jiang Suo's arm, only then rescuing Ji Xin from Jiang Suo's hands.

Ji Xin fell to the ground on his buttocks, face covered in blood, extremely embarrassed. At this moment, the bailiffs and guards outside all rushed in. Seeing this scene, they were greatly shocked. Immediately, water and fire sticks fell together, beating Jiang Suo until his head broke and blood flowed, putting shackles on him again.

Ji Xin only felt his cheek and mouth burning, blood gushing out constantly. He touched his cheek, there seemed to be a wound too, even the flesh rolled up.
