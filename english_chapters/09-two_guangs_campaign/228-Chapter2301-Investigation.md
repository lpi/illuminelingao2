# Chapter 2301 - Investigation

Yi Haoran was taken to the **County Police Bureau**—formerly the Cangwu County Yamen—for temporary detention. His arrest was "preventative"; without a specific charge, there was no interrogation. The police simply tossed him into a cell and went to report the completion of their task.

He was not the only one in the cell. To ensure the safe arrival of the grain fleet, Zheng Ergen, following Xie Erren's instructions, had conducted a "preventative detention" sweep in Wuzhou, rounding up a motley assortment of individuals deemed "potential threats." Naturally, this included quite a few cases of "the muddled monk judging the muddled case."

Seeing the cell packed with various characters arrested for unknown reasons, Yi Haoran felt slightly reassured. The thieves suspected him, true. But judging by the situation, they did not prioritize him highly, which meant he was safe for the moment—merely restricted in movement.

Yi Haoran did not care about his own personal safety. He had long since placed life and death outside his consideration. Even tonight's major event in Wuzhou would remain unaffected; all necessary arrangements had been made. Originally, he had planned to merely sit in the shop and wait until dawn to verify the results.

With these thoughts, he ceased worrying, found a corner against the wall to sit, and closed his eyes to rest.

Having sent Zheng Ergen off to make arrests, Zhao Fengtian still felt uneasy. The mysterious disappearance of the external transfer letter demanded an explanation. What if there was a mole lurking right beside the Chief?

Thinking of this, his mind immediately went to Cai Lan. Chief Xie had been spending his nights there recently, reviewing official documents; she was one of the few people likely to have contact with them. And given her suspicious background...

Zhao Fengtian could no longer sit still. He decided to find Xie Erren first, report the situation, and then decide on a course of action—after all, this matter involved someone close to the Chief.

However, he immediately hesitated. Whether or not this matter involved Cai Lan, it would be a huge embarrassment for Chief Xie. It was hard to say how the Chief would react. If Cai Lan turned out to be innocent and Chief Xie directed his anger elsewhere, Zhao Fengtian feared he would not have a good outcome.

He decided to investigate quietly first. He summoned the naturalized staff responsible for document transmission in Xie Erren's office and questioned them one by one, verifying that no errors had occurred in any step of the process.

Now, the only option was to search the office itself; perhaps it had been left in some corner.

Zhao Fengtian sent someone to quietly fetch Xie Erren's security secretary and asked about Xie Erren's current whereabouts.

"Chief Xie is currently at his office in the Prefectural Yamen. He has already notified us that he will not return to the Three Generals' Office tonight," the security secretary said. "He wants to preside over the command center."

"Where is Cai Lan now?"

"Nothing unusual."

"Go, come with me as a witness. We will go to the Three Generals' Office together and inspect Chief Xie's office."

The security secretary was somewhat surprised and asked, "Has something happened?"

"I won't hide it from you." Zhao Fengtian explained the disappearance of the transfer letter and his suspicions in detail. "This matter is of grave importance. Without concrete evidence, it is inconvenient to draw conclusions, and even less appropriate to report to the Chief."

"I understand." The security secretary realized the severity of the situation. "I'll go with you right now!" He added, "Ideally, we find nothing wrong!"

"I hope so too." Though Zhao Fengtian said this, he held little hope in his heart. Xie Erren's office was cleaned daily, and there were strict protocols for file management; it was impossible for a document to be left lying around.

If the document wasn't there, he would have no choice but to report to Chief Xie.

Zhao Fengtian and the security secretary went to the Three Generals' Office. After unlocking the door, they searched the office for a long time. Every document remaining in the office was cross-checked against the registry; not a single one was missing, and all were accounted for. Only that external transfer letter was nowhere to be found.

If the letter hadn't been misplaced, the only other possibility was that it had been put into Xie Erren's confidential box. This box was kept by his confidential clerk and contained high-level secret documents—but this possibility was minuscule.

Losing various documents was a major incident no matter how one looked at it, let alone a highly important external transfer letter. This had to be reported to Chief Xie immediately—he could not shoulder this responsibility alone.

Xie Erren's face turned extremely unsightly upon hearing Zhao Fengtian's report. After a long silence, he asked, "Do you have any hard evidence?"

"Currently, we have no evidence, but based on the document transmission hierarchy, it was definitely lost during the stage involving the Three Generals' Office," Zhao Fengtian said.

Xie Erren's head buzzed. Documents didn't have legs; they couldn't walk. The only possibility was that someone had removed it. And in the Three Generals' Office, aside from himself, the only person who could quietly remove a document was Cai Lan.

Of course, if one insisted on widening the circle of suspects, the servants attending Cai Lan and the confidential clerks who could enter the office... there were four or five others with suspicion. But in this moment, Xie Erren's intuition told him: the one who took the document was Cai Lan!

A strong bitterness instantly swirled in his mouth, making Xie Erren recall the feeling from middle school when he discovered the female classmate he had bitterly pursued for so long already had a boyfriend. His mind went blank.

Seeing Xie Erren's face turn pale, Zhao Fengtian knew something was wrong and hurriedly called out, "Chief! Chief!"

After repeated calls, Xie Erren finally snapped back to reality. He felt his heart racing wildly and his body going limp. To be honest, he had no love for Cai Lan, but he believed he had invested effort and bestowed grace upon her. He should have obtained this humble little woman's entire body and heart. He hadn't expected her to play tricks behind his back!

A wave of fury surged in his heart. If in the past he was just an ordinary middle school student who could only "let it go," he was now a regional potentate holding the power of life and death over countless people! If he wanted someone to live, they lived; if he wanted them to die, they died. If Cai Lan had truly betrayed him, he would make her wish she were dead!

Seeing Xie's face turn from pale to green and then flush red, Zhao Fengtian worried the Australian might be having a stroke or a fit of phlegm confusion. If something happened to him, it would be disastrous! Trembling with fear, he advised, "Chief, Chief, please calm down and catch your breath. This matter hasn't been investigated clearly yet..."

Seeing Zhao Fengtian's face full of worry, Xie Erren realized he had lost his composure. Regardless of whether Cai Lan took the document, if he flew into a rage now, he would only make himself a laughingstock. His expression just now had been a major loss of dignity. He quickly covered up, "I'm fine. The most urgent matter right now is the grain issue. Investigate secretly for now, control the situation and the relevant personnel—don't be in a rush to arrest anyone, just prevent them from escaping. We'll deal with it after the grain takes are unloaded tomorrow."

"Yes, I will arrange it immediately." Zhao Fengtian understood Xie Erren's meaning: keep it quiet for now and control the situation.

Just as he was about to leave, Xie Erren stopped him again:
"Who was the person to be transferred in that letter?"

"An accountant. I heard he is from Teng County..."

"Arrest him first."

"We have already arrested him."

"Good, go about your business."

Zhao Fengtian immediately notified the security secretary and Zheng Ergen. The three put their heads together and decided to first seal off the courtyard where Cai Lan lived, forbidding anyone from entering or exiting. Xie Erren's office in the courtyard had already been locked and did not need to be touched for the time being. The documents left in the main room would be retrieved by a confidential clerk. Any inquiries from unrelated personnel would be met with silence; news was to be temporarily blocked.

"What about that Mr. Hao?" Zheng Ergen asked. "We've arrested the man. Should we move him to a special detention area?"

"No need." Zhao Fengtian shook his head. "If we move him now, I'm afraid he might sense something. If he commits suicide, the trail will go cold. Send two capable men to disguise themselves as prisoners and put them in the same cell to monitor him secretly."

"Then, what about Cai Lan? If she notices something amiss and kills herself, wouldn't that be trouble?" Zheng Ergen was still worried.

Zhao Fengtian mused, "The Chief's intention is not to arrest anyone. Wait until there's time to investigate slowly. Observing the Chief's demeanor, it seems he isn't certain Cai Lan is involved—we have no evidence at the moment..."

"Wouldn't we know if we dragged her in for interrogation?"

Zhao Fengtian patted Zheng Ergen's shoulder and smiled. "Brother, this matter isn't actually complex, but we have to consider the Chief's feelings. No need to rush. If Cai Lan is guilty, the Chief can't protect her. But if she is innocent, and we strike too hard, how will we explain it to the Chief later? Since the Chief said not to arrest anyone, we should be cautious..."

"What if she commits suicide?"

"Then it's suicide to escape punishment," Zhao Fengtian said. "Even simpler."

"Alright, I'll listen to you." Zheng Ergen was a bit confused, but Zhao Fengtian's rank was much higher, and he was the Chief's trusted aide, so listening to his arrangement couldn't be wrong.

Because Xie Erren had said he wouldn't be coming over that night, Cai Lan had kept Jiang Qiuchan to keep her company, planning to do some needlework under the lamp and chat to pass the time.

Just as darkness fell, there was the sound of movement in the courtyard. Cai Lan felt strange: if Xie Erren wasn't coming, the courtyard was usually dead silent. Why were people suddenly coming?

She leaned against the window and peeked out quietly. She saw Zhao Fengtian and a familiar-looking bandit whispering in front of Elder Xie's study door. The lamp in the study was lit, and figures were moving inside.

What was going on? Cai Lan's heart tightened. She knew a little about the rules of these bandits; this study was like the White Tiger Hall or a military war room for the Australians. Except for Xie the Bandit himself, no one else was allowed to enter at will. Now that Xie was absent, what were Zhao Fengtian and his men doing at the study door?

She immediately thought of the letter she had burned—could they be here for that? At this thought, her heart sank: *Has something happened to Master Yi?!*

Although she didn't know exactly what Master Yi was busy with, she had been following his instructions these past days, writing the bits and pieces she heard from Xie Erren onto paintings and calligraphy using rice water, then transmitting them to Chang Qingyun. She didn't need to be told to know they were plotting something.

For a moment, Cai Lan was stunned. From the moment she burned that letter, she knew this day would come. She had long made her plans: once the matter was exposed, she would commit suicide and follow her fiancé to the underworld.
