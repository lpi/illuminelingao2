# Chapter 2149 - Wild Thoughts

With this explanation, Xie Erren finally had some confidence. He immediately ordered the battalion to enter and station at various city gates and important places inside and outside the city. Qian Duo's militia squad was no longer necessary and was disbanded on the spot. The original Fubo Army officers and soldiers returned to their units. As for the militiamen, those willing to go home were given severance pay to go home; those willing to continue being soldiers were temporarily formed into a supplementary company, under the command of the National Army Wuzhou Battalion.

Xie Erren took inventory of the troops in his hand: one regular army company, one National Army battalion plus a supplementary company, totaling more than five hundred men. Although it couldn't be counted as a strong army with sturdy horses, it wasn't the trembling "naked run" state at the beginning either.

Once his mood relaxed, he remembered the female assassin detained in the Earth God Shrine. He immediately instructed that he would "interrogate" her at night.

Disliking Zhao Fengtian for being wordy, he changed to another secretary. Although this new secretary was male, he was much more understanding. Hearing the leader's order, a "knowing"猥琐 (wretched/lecherous) smile immediately appeared on his face, indicating that he would definitely get the matter "done."

Actually, Xie Erren himself didn't have any lecherous thoughts for the time being. He felt he had too many things to do.

In previous days, he had been trembling with fear for safety issues. Now that a battalion of the National Army had arrived, and there was a battalion of Fubo Army operating outside the city, although it couldn't be counted as "impregnable," it wasn't "precarious like a pile of eggs" anymore. Some policies and such he had considered in the past could also be implemented.

*There are really quite a few things to do...* Xie Erren took a notebook out of his pocket.

"So, is there a chance to do a job in Wuzhou?" Rotten-Eye Hu said impatiently.

"Yes." Gou Xunli nodded. "Right now is a good opportunity."

The place where the sworn brothers were talking was in a crude mountain stronghold in the continuous mountains not far east of Wuzhou city. This area was a mix of Yao and Han settlements. Although not far from the prefecture city, the government didn't have much influence; it was a place where whoever had the biggest fist had the reason. Bandits basically didn't have to worry about government encirclement and suppression.

However, the bandits' days were not easy: not only were Han and Yao villages interlocked here, but due to the Yao uprisings, the government repeatedly conscripted Wolf Troops from Guangxi to "suppress the Yao," and there were also Wolf-Zhuang stockades in between. All villages existed in the form of stockades, and every stockade had militiamen and village braves. Various villages constantly had conflicts and armed fights due to disputes over land, water, forests, and various other reasons.

Villages in this atmosphere were basically heavily guarded, and the common people had rich experience in armed fights. Whether plundering or kidnapping for ransom, it was very difficult for bandits. Sometimes they would even be counter-killed by "fat sheep." Even "side hustles" were very difficult.

If not for the golden waterway of the West River with busy shipping, and Gou Xunli having many tricks in his belly to make a fortune from time to time, they simply couldn't support the more than two hundred people in this stronghold.

For Rotten-Eye Hu, he wasn't interested in "revenge" or the "Imperial Court." Although the Bald Thieves killed many of his brothers, he didn't plan to hit a stone with an egg. The only reason that could attract him to continue working with his sworn brother was still the word "wealth."

When they were trapped in Guangdong back then, they were once recruited by Master Shi to go to the Yao area in Lingao to receive "knights-errant." Although later the plan failed because heroes from all walks of life were arrested or killed one after another, Rotten-Eye Hu looked at his sworn brother Gou the Second with new eyes—being able to serve high officials of the Imperial Court was not something ordinary greenwood heroes could curry favor with.

Don't look at the greenwood outlaws proclaiming "not afraid of officials" usually; in reality, the thought of "accepting amnesty to become an official" was quite strong. Rotten-Eye Hu had followed Gou the Second to risk his life for these years, firstly because he had no choice, and secondly because Gou the Second had been recruited by the government several times, and he always held some kind of fantasy—maybe he could strike it rich.

If he took this opportunity to make a score in Wuzhou, regardless of whether the court awarded merit or not, at least looting enough for a few years' spending would be sufficient. If it went well, he would earn enough money for a lifetime—at worst, he would quit this line of work and go to the rich and gentle land of Jiangnan to muddle through the rest of his life. It would also save him from muddling along in this dilapidated and damp mountain stronghold.

"I have inquired clearly. The Fake Balds in the city are no more than two hundred. Including the bailiffs they recruited and the temporarily formed militia team, there are only five hundred people in total." After meeting with Yi Haoran and returning, Gou Xunli felt more and more that this adventure was promising—Yi Haoran was not only very familiar with the Bald situation but also held hatred towards the Bald Thieves. asking him to be the guide to smooth things over with the government was ninety percent sure. However, this advisor also raised a question: Since they were going to lobby Xiong Wencan, this side had to come up with a specific strategy so that Lord Xiong could consider the issue of support.

"Second Brother, it's not that I'm lecturing you, but the Bald Thieves' combat power is far above ours." Rotten-Eye Hu said, "In these few years, we brothers haven't suffered less at their hands! You say they have no more than two hundred Fake Balds, but our stronghold, calculated fully, also has two hundred brothers—half of them have to be summoned temporarily from home! Even breaking a stockade is strenuous; taking so few people to Wuzhou, isn't it walking like a sheep into a tiger's mouth? If Viceroy Xiong doesn't send troops, I think it's very precarious!"

"Counting on Viceroy Xiong to send troops is unreliable." Gou Xunli shook his head, "This is like doing business; if we don't bring out some dry goods (real stuff/results), why should Viceroy Xiong believe us?"

"That's true..." Rotten-Eye Hu was somewhat disappointed. "Then what is there to say?"

"In the past, wanting to ask Viceroy Xiong to send troops was a dream—but now he is as precarious as a pile of eggs. As long as we produce a little merit that allows him to cover up his faults before the Imperial Court, he will definitely bring out big capital!"

Rotten-Eye Hu stood up with a "teng" and paced back and forth in the thatched "Ju Yi Hall" (Hall of Gathering Justice), seeming somewhat excited, and asked back: "Tell me, what do we do?"

"Right now on both banks of the West River, the Yao rebellion has arisen, and the Bald Thieves are unable to attend to themselves—I heard from the spy in the city that the Bald Thieves originally intended to place heavy troops in Wuzhou, but more than ten days ago, they suddenly received news and retreated in panic, leaving only about a thousand men at the Ximatan drill ground in the west of the city..."

"Brother, you are trying to kill people without paying for their lives," Rotten-Eye Hu shook his head repeatedly, somewhat frightened. "Ximatan is only five or six *li* away from Wuzhou. With the slightest disturbance, they can reinforce Wuzhou. Our few people aren't enough to fill the gaps in their teeth! Can't do it, can't do it!"

"You only know one thing but not the other." During his trip to Wuzhou this time, Gou Xunli inquired about a lot of news. "The Bald Thieves at Ximatan aren't there every day—the entire Wuzhou Prefecture isn't just one Cangwu County! Some days ago, they set out to accept the surrender of various subordinate counties of Wuzhou, and now most of them are not there."

"But they will come back..."

"What if they can't come back?"

"?" Rotten-Eye Hu widened his eyes. "Do you have any brilliant plan?"

"Brilliant plan? I don't have one, but the current situation can be used."

The so-called situation was known to Rotten-Eye Hu, which was that the news of the "Yao Rebellion" had reached the local area.

The distribution of the Yao ethnic group in Guangdong had shrunk significantly in the Ming Dynasty, mainly concentrated in northern Guangdong: Lianzhou, Yingde, Ruyuan, Yangshan, and other prefectures and counties. However, there were still a large number of Yao stockades and caves in the mountainous areas along the West River in Wuzhou, Zhaoqing, etc. They had once besieged Wuzhou and even broke into the city once, capturing several court officials.

Although several Viceroys came here to "suppress the Yao" and basically suppressed the Yao people around Wuzhou, the power of the Yao people in the surrounding mountainous areas was still very strong. For hundreds of years, conflicts with the government and Han villages had been constant, and deep grudges had been formed.

News of the riots in the "Eight Rows and Twenty-Four Chongs" in Lianshan and other places was also passed to the local area: this place was only more than three hundred *li* away from Lianshan County. Rotten-Eye Hu knew: the rioting Yao people in Lianshan and other places were connecting locally, inciting Yao people to rise in response.

"Are you saying to unite with the Yao people?" Rotten-Eye Hu shook his head repeatedly. "This is not easy to handle! Which of these Tusi and indigenous officials is easy to get along with! Besides, what do we use to persuade them?"

"With such a big bait as Wuzhou, won't they be moved?" Gou Xunli sneered.

"The words are correct, but..." Rotten-Eye Hu looked at him. They had no dealings with the Li people (Yao people). Usually, although well water didn't violate river water, conflicts would erupt from time to time. Saying there was deep hatred was not true, but friendship was out of the question either. Could it be that this brother wanted him to lobby the Tusi personally? Although the Yao stockades were not dragon pools and tiger dens, lobbying at this juncture, it wasn't guaranteed that the Yao people wouldn't kill him as a spy.

Rotten-Eye Hu knew this sworn brother: if talking about being resourceful, he could barely count, but talking about risking his life to enter a tiger's den, that was out of the question.

Seeing his doubt, Gou Xunli smiled: "Brother, don't be suspicious! I have my own plan."

Gou Xunli's plan was simple: try to incite Yao riots as much as possible to create a chaotic situation.

"The Yao people in Lianzhou have been sending people to connect locally. I think even without our incitement, they will rise to rebel." Gou Xunli said, "Once the Yao people rebel and create chaos, they will inevitably go down the mountain to attack villages. The Bald Thieves newly acquired Wuzhou; according to their temper, suppressing bandits and stabilizing the locality is the primary task. Therefore, this Director of the Bald Thieves will inevitably send troops to pacify the Yao. This army of a thousand or so people has to guard against Ming troops coming from Guangxi and suppress everywhere; how can they still attend to Wuzhou city?"

"The Bald Thieves are extremely powerful; I think these Yao people can't resist for long either..." Rotten-Eye Hu still had lingering fears when speaking. The desperate past of being chased by small units of Bald Thieves with no way to heaven or earth, not even time to close eyes for sleep, was still vivid in his mind.

"As long as there is a gap of ten days or half a month, we will have a chance."

"What chance?"

"Sneak attack on Wuzhou."

Rotten-Eye Hu's jaw almost couldn't close, thinking this sworn brother must have gone mad. Wuzhou was a dignitary prefecture city! Let alone his few men, even the arrogant Bald Thieves besieged it with several thousand people and bombarded it with cannons for several days before taking Wuzhou down.

"Brother..." He stammered a bit, "This matter... is unreliable..."
