# Chapter 2363: Status of Sanya (Part 3)

When Xu Yanliang asked about housing, Tang Menglong waved his hand dismissively:
"Housing is ready-made—even building it for you now isn't difficult; we have architects here." He walked to the window and pointed to a three-story building northeast of the square.

"How about that one?"

Following his finger, it was a three-story brick-and-wood building in Neoclassical style. The outer wall was the original color of red brick, with green vines climbing on it, looking both artistic and fresh.

Xu Yanliang was a bit skeptical—he had seen enough of Lingao's Bauhaus-style architecture. Where did such a beautiful and elegant house come from? He hesitated: "That one?"

"That's right, that three-story brick building. Beautiful, isn't it?"

"Damn, you are generous enough!"

"This was designed by Zhang Xingpei; it was originally the Sanya Library." Tang Menglong said with some regret, "Unfortunately, there isn't a single book inside now. It's used as a dormitory for some naturalized cadres. To be honest, it's a waste. Might as well vacate it for your use."

Xu Yanliang felt somewhat flattered: "This is really a generous gift!"

"Not at all, not at all, this is also revitalizing fixed assets. Otherwise, leaving this good house empty, the maintenance fee alone is a large sum every year."

Xu Yanliang calculated in his mind; the headquarters currently had about fifty or sixty people, and even after expansion, there would be at most a hundred or so. This building was enough for office use. He immediately thought of another problem: the Southeast Asia Company's trading station was in Hexi District. If the headquarters staff lived in Hexi, they would have to spend time commuting every day.

"Can the dormitory issue be solved?"

"Yes." Tang Menglong said without hesitation, "I have plenty of houses here. Even the meal problem is easy to solve—just sign a meal plan at the cafeteria. If they want to improve their food, they have to go to Hexi—there are quite a few restaurants there."

Xu Yanliang settled the relevant relocation matters with Tang Menglong one by one. Tang Menglong patted his chest on almost everything, expressing his "full support."

Xu Yanliang naturally had to return the favor, immediately revealing to him that the Nanyang Company was about to start raising funds, implying that he could get the company's original shares with preferential conditions.

"Well, since the policy allows, I definitely want to buy a few shares." Tang Menglong didn't be coy, "But honestly, it would be even better if you could drive the industry and commerce here."

It seemed this Mayor Tang still had some ideas. Xu Yanliang thought for a moment and said, "It's still too early to say what we can do. How about this, tell me the basic situation of Sanya, and let's calculate together."

"Speaking of Sanya, there is some foundation." Tang Menglong said, "The problem now is that there are no new growth points. Since Engineer Wang was transferred away and I took office, the Senate has not added any new fixed asset investment projects here. Only some renovation and production increase investments. The amount is not small, but relying only on these few state-owned enterprises to lead, the growth is still too slow."

He didn't mention another crucial issue, which was that these state-owned enterprises contributed very little to Sanya locally. Take the local largest enterprise, Tiandu Mining Bureau, for example. Logically speaking, a small town formed by tens of thousands of workers should have considerable purchasing power. But more than half of Tiandu's laborers were slaves from Southeast Asia, who had no purchasing power to speak of beyond the most basic food and clothing. Other workers were also mostly bachelors—no wives, no children. After work, most of them just ate their fill in the canteen and went back to the dormitory. The connection with Sanya was that the canteen purchased locally produced vegetables, salt, seafood, and a small amount of daily necessities. The largest consumables: grain and clothing were transported from Lingao.

Such a large basic population base almost didn't participate in Sanya's economic cycle.

"...You know the style of old SOEs, right? Yes, Tiandu Mining Bureau is just like that." Tang Menglong said.

"Leaving other things aside, grain and cloth shouldn't be like this. You can't import directly here and have to transport from Lingao? Foreigners aren't willing to earn this money?" Xu Yanliang was puzzled.

"Foreigners are certainly willing. The problem is that after selling grain and cloth, foreigners also have to purchase goods. The goods they want: sugar, silk, handicrafts, medicinal materials... I don't produce any of them here; they have to be transported from other places. Or we pay in real gold and silver—but there is a quota for this."

This was indeed a problem, Xu Yanliang thought, but it was not easy to solve. For example, sugar and silk were actually somewhat "native products." Even if they wanted to develop related industries in Sanya, it would require huge investment. From the cost perspective, it wasn't economical either. This wasn't something the Nanyang Company could solve; it required coordination from the Planning Committee and other departments.

However, he didn't speak and continued to listen to Tang Menglong.

"Tiandu also has no suitable export products. Its only output is ore, and even the slag left from ore dressing is transported away. So what it produces actually has little to do with Sanya; it is completely an independent economy." Tang Menglong complained, "I once thought about whether I could sell houses to miners, or at least rent some apartments to them long-term. But miners all have dormitories, and it's hard for them to get wives and organize families, so they have no interest in buying or renting houses either."

Sanya's second largest industry was the coconut processing industry.

Sanya's surroundings naturally had many coconut grove resources, but far from the scale of plantations. It mainly relied on acquisition—this was also a sideline for many local commoners and nearby Li people currently. Because the Australians purchased coconuts, not only in Sanya but in all coconut-producing places in southern Hainan, buyers appeared, purchasing coconuts locally and transporting them to Sanya. It was currently the most successful industry in Sanya.

The coconut was a treasure all over. The Senate mainly used coconuts to produce coconut water and copra. Coconut water, as a specialty beverage of Sanya, was bottled and sterilized locally, then transported to Lingao and other places by refrigerated ships cooled by natural ice. It was also a quite high-end "Australian premium beverage" in Guangzhou. Copra was mainly used to extract oil. Coir extracted from coconut husks was used to make ropes. Coconut flowers could also be used to brew wine during the flowering season.

This industry generated almost no waste and can achieve full utilization of coconuts, with extremely high economic benefits. It was the most profitable industrial enterprise in Sanya. It was also the second largest local employer after the Tiandu Mining Bureau, absorbing a large amount of local labor.

"Sanya Coconut Company is our economic pillar here." Tang Menglong said, "It can be said that Sanya's ability to maintain today's situation is largely due to it."

"Where are this company's coconut products sold?"

"Almost all are transported to Lingao." Tang Menglong said, "A part is transported to Wenchang. There are also coconut processing enterprises there. We don't produce coconut oil here; we only process it into copra and then transport it to Wenchang for oil extraction. The same goes for coir."

"Primary processing."

"Exactly, just primary processing."

There were actually only two end products that the Coconut Company could sell directly: coconut water and Arrack.

Needless to say, Arrack was currently the No. 1 local product exported from Sanya, very popular among European merchants. However, the quantity of flowers was limited, the brewing season was short, and the output couldn't go up.

"...Actually, coconut trees can also produce coconut sugar. But we don't have plantations here, and collecting sap is too troublesome. It hasn't been done on a large scale—besides, European merchants are probably most interested in cane sugar; even if we spend effort to develop it, people might not be interested."

"Relying solely on acquiring coconuts, this industry won't grow big." Xu Yanliang said, "We still have to establish plantations."

"Establish plantations is easier said than done. The Agricultural Committee actually doesn't understand this either." Tang Menglong said, "When I went back to Lingao, I talked to Wu Nanhai. He mumbled a few times and squeezed out 'we will research it,' then there was no follow-up. Later I looked for Fa Shilu; he said their Agricultural Committee didn't have professionals specializing in tropical crops. Apart from some book knowledge learned in university, they can only rely on materials from the Great Library."

"No wonder things like quinine and rubber have never been sorted out..."

"There is a big difference between reading books and actually doing it. I understand this too. Besides, even if everything goes smoothly, plantations won't be harvestable for eight or ten years."

The third industry was fish-salt. The reason for putting them together was that Sanya's salt industry mainly served the fishery. Departing from Sanya, the abundant Xisha-Nansha waters had always been traditional fishing grounds for Chinese fishermen. Under the management of the Senate, fishermen had to register for fishing in Sanya before the fishing season every year, receive fishing flags, and then go south for fishing operations under the escort of the Coast Guard.

Because traditional fishermen lacked refrigeration conditions, they often needed a large amount of salt for preservation. Therefore, the consumption of salt was very large. In order to obtain protein, the Senate not only sold salt on credit with favorable conditions but also sent dedicated refrigerated ships to purchase fresh fish locally and transport them back to Sanya for processing into various fish products.

"Fishery tax and salt sales are considerable, but salt is a monopoly product. Like the mine in Tiandu, no matter how much is sold, it has little to do with me. At least the fishery tax is fully refunded to the municipal government currently—without this money, I really couldn't sustain it."

"The timber processing industry is also passable now. The Dutch and British often ship logs here—probably no cost to them; they can make money just by pulling them over. If we can create enough supply sources in Sanya, they should ship more timber over."

Aside from this, Sanya had some sporadic industry and commerce. Larger scales were ship repair, fishing boat manufacturing, fishing gear, and hardware. Many shell companies opened in Sanya for tax avoidance also provided a considerable amount of tax revenue and consumption.

"This can also be counted as an industry." Tang Menglong laughed.

"This, Old Wang and I chatted before he went to Guangzhou. He said this loophole would be plugged sooner or later. Of course, it won't be completely plugged; we still have to give them some space."
