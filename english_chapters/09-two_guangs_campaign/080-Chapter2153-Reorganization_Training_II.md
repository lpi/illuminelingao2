# Chapter 2153 - Reorganization Training (II)

This sort of thing was nothing new to soldiers—strict military law was a hallmark of medieval armies. The "Seventeen Prohibitions and Fifty-Four Capital Offenses" had a long pedigree, with scarcely a single infraction that didn't warrant beheading. Even a famous general as skilled at commanding troops as Qi Jiguang had enforced extremely harsh military orders.

However, the strictness of military law and whether it could actually be enforced were two different matters. Especially among the Ming forces they had absorbed from the Pearl River Delta region—these were troops that had enjoyed peace for a long time in late Ming terms, and they had inevitably grown "slack and indolent." Many were actually from military colony backgrounds and had never served as professional soldiers; they were called soldiers, but were really just peasants.

The forceful, murderous reading of the regulations immediately set many of these peasant-born soldiers trembling.

For old hands in the military like Yang Erdong, however, there was nothing special about these regulations. If there was any difference, it was that the Australians' regulations were somewhat simpler than Ming military law—even gentler, in a way. After all, the entire proclamation never mentioned the word "behead." In the Imperial forces, every announcement of military discipline required that bloody "kill" or "behead." To impress the lesson upon the soldiers, such occasions usually featured a few unlucky wretches being executed on the spot, their dripping heads hung up for all to see.

When the commands were finished, the actual drilling began.

Most of the men in this National Army battalion had already received about two weeks of reorganization training in Hong Kong. But those two weeks had included physical examinations, political education, physical conditioning, and basic discipline formation—the actual time spent on drill was quite limited. Qian Duo didn't trust such troops to fight, or even to hold a wall; he was in a hurry.

Qian Duo divided the National Army battalion into two groups. The first consisted of soldiers who had undergone the two weeks of training in Hong Kong; they had at least been introduced to discipline and formation drills, so their focus would be on tactical development, including firearms shooting, cold-weapon combat, and battle formation maneuvers.

As for the newly conscripted men who had been called up just before departure, and the locally recruited soldiers in Wuzhou—they would have to start from scratch.

The troops split into two groups and headed to their respective drill grounds. Training was organized by company, with each company assigned ten instructors at a ratio of one to ten. All the instructors were Beiwei Army corporals and sergeants. Even if their combat experience wasn't particularly rich, they had served in the forces for at least two years, and regulations and formations had been drilled into them until they could recite them in their sleep.

Because Yang Erdong was among the locally recruited deserters, he was naturally placed in the "full training recruits" cohort.

The first training content was formation drill—each man memorizing his position in the formation and falling in quickly upon assembly. This wasn't too difficult: memorize the men in front, behind, left, and right, and you could take your spot quickly. Once the instructors drilled the simple commands "Attention!" and "Dress right!" they issued no further orders. Instead, they paced in circles around each squad, hands clasped behind their backs, gripping three-foot-long unfinished wooden truncheons. Anyone who craned his neck or moved his hands to scratch an itch immediately received a blow.

"If you haven't heard a new command, no one moves!" The instructors bared their teeth and brandished their clubs.

This standing lasted a full hour. Everyone who moved during that time received a stroke. Some with weaker constitutions bent over and vomited all over the ground, then got hit again; others couldn't endure and begged the instructors for mercy, only to be beaten until they cowered and scurried, then clubbed back into the formation to hold out somehow. Only those who actually fainted were spared a beating—they were dragged aside and revived with a bucket of cold water to the face.

Yang Erdong, having "seen much of the world," recognized immediately that the Australians were "serious about this." He didn't even dare steal glances around, and could only let the screams go in one ear and out the other. After half a *shi* had passed, this ordeal finally ended.

They rested for part of an incense stick's burning time; then it was "Attention!" again. The instructors appointed temporary squad leaders and sergeants, made every man memorize their faces, demonstrated how to salute, and then pointed at their own shoulder insignia and announced: from now on, anyone who failed to salute when encountering someone wearing an armband would receive ten strokes of the military staff and be made to squat for two hours. This time they stood until the dinner break. The worst-performing squad in each company had to keep standing until everyone else finished eating before they were allowed to eat.

Lunch was served on the drill ground itself—white rice and mixed vegetable stew, all you could eat. The stew arrived in large tin buckets, steaming hot and fragrant, though unappetizing in appearance. Yang Erdong closed his eyes and took a bite: the taste wasn't bad; there seemed to be some meat in it—though exactly what, no one could tell.

After lunch and a brief rest, the afternoon training began. This was when the real test started: the instructors spoke entirely in the "New Speech," while the soldiers spoke all manner of dialects. If they had any common language at all, it was Guangzhou Mandarin.

Apart from a few "worldly" soldiers—like Yang Erdong, who understood "official speech" and could therefore grasp sixty or seventy percent of the New Speech—most soldiers found the New Speech about as comprehensible as a foreign tongue.

And so the afternoon drill became a brutal listening exercise. The instructors issued commands only in the New Speech, sometimes accompanied by physical cues; any error of comprehension earned a "mental injection" via military truncheon.

Since the commands were incomprehensible and the regulations innumerable—there was the *Soldier's Handbook*, true, but most soldiers were illiterate and couldn't possibly remember it all—beatings were constant throughout the drill grounds. While being beaten, one had to recite one's own offense aloud—in the New Speech, naturally; mispronunciation also earned more clubbing. After enough beatings, everyone figured out the pattern: the rule was, whatever you hadn't been ordered to do, you were absolutely forbidden to do. Anyone who did it got the club.

By evening, when they returned to their quarters—the new training company was billeted in the Three General's Residence, in empty halls spread with dry straw, providing shelter from wind and rain, quite decent lodging for soldiers used to sleeping rough—everyone had legs too stiff to bend and aches all over. They barely managed to crawl onto their straw pallets.

"The beatings I took today outnumber all the beatings of my last twenty years put together..." Li Pudun sat gingerly on his straw mat, wincing and complaining. He too was a surrendered soldier from Wuzhou.

"At least the Australians use thin wooden rods. If this were Ming officers, we'd have been beaten to death today..."

"Don't even mention the military staff—they can whip the flesh right off you!" said one soldier. "I saw it once, years ago. A chunk of flesh as big as your palm flew up and stuck to the flagpole. You could see the bone beneath... horrifying."

"Soldiering for pay is never easy! Just our bad luck!" sighed another. "My father died when I was fifteen, so I had to go soldiering for my meals. To this day I don't know how my family is doing, whether my old mother is all right..."

"How is she? Your mother's found a new daddy for you..."

"Go to hell!" The offended soldier was about to throw a punch when others pulled them apart.

"Haven't you had enough beatings? You want to hand them your head?!" Yang Erdong intervened. "Look at the time! The Australians would love for you to act up so they can execute a few for discipline."

"Brother Erdong is right. We're all comrades-in-arms here—stop stirring up trouble."

"The Australians are fierce, but at least they don't kill randomly. And the food is good! I just wonder how long this Australian rice will last!"

"Wanting rice to eat? Easy—if we can't eat Australian rice, we'll eat Ming rice again..."

"Stop your damn death-wishing!" An older soldier cut him off. "You tired of living?!"

Just then, a voice shouted from outside: "You lot! Don't just lie there like corpses—get up and soak your feet!"

"Your mother..." Li Pudun muttered under his breath. "A whole day of torment and still no peace!"

"Never mind. We're under their roof now. We eat Australian rice, so we have to take their orders." Others tried to placate him as they dragged themselves off their pallets and limped outside.

Standing outside was Company Commander Li Dong. He had served two years in the Beiwei Army before being discharged for flat feet, and had been recalled into the National Army as an officer when conscription resumed. In the view of the conscripts in the new training company, Commander Li was a bit too young, and therefore "too green." But after a full day of being "worked hard" by Li Dong, no one dared call him green anymore.

"After training, all personnel will wash up and soak their feet," he announced, sweeping his eyes over the ragged soldiers. "You! Pair up in twos and go to the mess hall to fetch hot water. You lot, go to the supply store and draw wooden basins!"

Under the supervision of officers and instructors, the entire new training company washed up, soaked their feet, and then lanced their blisters. Soaking feet helped relieve fatigue; lancing blisters helped with marching—the soldiers knew this well, but in camp they rarely had the means: wooden basins and hot water were not things you could come by easily. Sometimes, when luck ran out, there wasn't even drinking water, never mind foot-soaking!

The Australians had it easy—not only did they provide for foot-soaking, but they issued one basin per person. Each soldier was ordered to carve his name on his basin. Yang Erdong thought this extravagant: one basin each, and just for their National Army battalion, that was three or four hundred. These basins clearly weren't local products; they must have been shipped in by the Australians from Lingao.

No wonder the gentry all said the Australians were "extravagant" and "fussy."

"Once you've carved your name, the basin is yours to keep!" came the order. "Basins may not be shared or borrowed—if discovered, this will be treated as a disciplinary offense! Loss or damage must be reported truthfully!"

Instructions done, the instructors did not leave but supervised personally. They didn't leave until every man had finished his personal hygiene, and then they inspected carefully, with no cutting of corners.

Supper was a mixed vegetable rice porridge, tasting exactly like the noon stew, just with rice cooked in. After eating, everyone thought they might finally relax—but no: Li Dong announced that "Cultural Study" was to begin.
