# Chapter 2198 - Meeting at Sanjiang Market

At this time, Yang Zeng, who led the troops climbing mountains for half a day, had already arrived at Luming Pass and occupied Sanjiang Market, five kilometers below Luming Pass.

Once the Fubo Army controlled Luming Pass, they choked the road for the Eight Row Yao to harass Lianzhou to the northeast. And a squadron monitoring the four Yao stockades in Yonghua Township choked the road for the Eight Row Yao to harass Yangshan to the southeast. Plus the already recovered Lianshan County seat, the encirclement layout against the Eight Row Yao had initially formed.

The Eight Row Yao hiding in the mountains were not easy to attack and destroy. Now that able-bodied men all came out, it gave them an opportunity to sweep them flat instead.

Once the active forces were annihilated, the remaining women, children, and old people would not be a trouble. The riot suppression plan formulated by Yang Zeng was actually soldiers first and courtesy later. Defeat and annihilate the active forces of the Eight Row Yao, then carry out recruitment and pacification.

That evening, the reconnaissance squad sent by Yang Zeng finally met with the reconnaissance team of Huang Chao's Li-Miao Company. The two sides subsequently met at Sanjiang Market.

Yang Zeng couldn't care about eating and studied the situation of Lianzhou with Huang Chao. Currently, the Eight Row Yao riot looked powerful, but according to the intelligence they collected along the way, the main force of the Eight Row Yao was still the able-bodied men of their own village stockades plus some coerced commoners. The total troop strength was at most four or five thousand people. Not only were troops few and weapons inferior, but they also lacked siege weapons. Many times they couldn't even break relatively strong village stockades. Attacking Lianzhou City was just empty talk. Being able to successfully besiege Lianzhou City currently was already their maximum limit.

"Since they can't take Lianzhou, why still surround Lianzhou City?" Huang Chao asked. "Is it wanting to besiege the point to strike reinforcements?"

"I think it's impossible," Yang Zeng shook his head. "Chief, you think: for Yao riots in past dynasties, at most the Governor of Liangguang mobilized troops of two provinces to suppress them jointly. Even if the ones coming this time weren't our Fubo Army but Guangdong Ming troops, the Eight Row Yao would have no ability to eat them."

"Then it's making a feint to the east while attacking in the west." Huang Chao continued to put forward his view.

"To be honest, it doesn't look like it either." Yang Zeng already roughly understood the process of Huang Chao and others recovering Yangshan. "If saying feint to the east while attacking in the west, the largest city in the Lianyang area is nothing but Lianzhou City. Feinting to the east to hit Lianzhou is nothing more than wanting to loot local Han villages. But judging from the situation of surrounding villages, except for attacking several Han villages to levy grain, there were no large-scale stockade-breaking activities. Besides, why did they incite Yonghua Township Yao people to hit Yangshan again? Yangshan City's defense is much weaker than Lianzhou, and the richness level is not comparable to ordinary stockades. It is obviously more profitable for Eight Row Yao to attack it themselves."

"You mean their original intention was still to attack Lianzhou?" Huang Chao was a bit confused.

"Not entirely." Seeing Huang Chao's doubtful expression, Yang Zeng was a bit proud. Opportunities to talk big in front of a Chief were not many. But he immediately realized the inappropriateness of this attitude and changed to a respectful expression again. "Yonghua Township Yao people should be a suspect force; attacking Lianshan was also to pin down government troops. The purpose is nothing more than blossoming on four sides, pinning down the incoming suppressing government troops dispersedly. Not to disturb them attacking Lianzhou..."

"But didn't you just say..."

"I guess the leader of Eight Row Yao probably knows very well that relying on force alone cannot take Lianzhou. His purpose is probably to force the commoners in the city to pay 'ransom' or satisfy some conditions of his by besieging the city and cutting off reinforcements. Or maybe, he has some brilliant plan to take Lianzhou City."

But what exactly for, they had no way of knowing. Eight Row Yao lived in deep mountains for generations; roads were dangerous and they had always been closed off. Except for a few small peddlers selling goods, outsiders rarely dealt with them.

To deal with the Yao chaos smoothly during the Guangdong Strategy, the External Intelligence Bureau had always wanted to send intelligence personnel to infiltrate the interior of Eight Row Yao. But this kind of recruitment action was not successful. First, Yao people generally distrusted Han people; even contact was very difficult, let alone recruiting and training into intelligence personnel. Secondly, Yao people had numerous branches with heavy xenophobic psychology, and customs and languages differed much. Even people of the same race, if not local Yao people of Eight Row Yao, could hardly penetrate into their midst. The External Intelligence Bureau's intelligence on Eight Row Yao, besides materials taken from the Great Library, was limited to fragments from some Han merchants who had been to the local area. Valuable intelligence was extremely little. So in military operations, how to figure out Yao people's mentality and combat behavior patterns became a very difficult thing.

Yang Zeng's judgment was made based on this little pitiful intelligence. Huang Chao felt it made sense, but also felt as if something was missing. However, he hadn't received tactical command training, so it was more appropriate to believe the words of Yang Zeng, this "professional."

"Regardless of what their purpose is, our primary task is to occupy Lianzhou." Yang Zeng said, "I have already sent people out to reconnoiter while it's dark. Strive to annihilate the main force of Eight Row Yao under Lianzhou City."

"I have no objection to relieving the siege of Lianzhou, but slaughter shouldn't be too heavy. After all, we focus on recruiting and pacifying..."

Yang Zeng disapproved greatly in his heart. Without hurting the opponent, how to recruit and pacify? Since ancient times when two armies engaged, if the enemy wasn't crippled before negotiating peace, there would definitely be great future troubles.

But the other party was a Senator. It wasn't convenient to contradict openly, so he perfunctorily answered "Yes" a few times.

Zhen Huan was somewhat restless. He didn't expect to actually see Bi Da outside Lianzhou City. Although it was just a hurried meeting, it was enough to make him indulge in wild fantasies. Bi Da probably didn't see him, only caring about talking and laughing with her companions. Not seeing her for two years, Bi Da had become more charming; the mature aura was exceptionally attractive.

However, Zhen Huan restrained himself from thinking about Bi Da: he had accepted the mission to take brothers to reconnoiter the Yao people's condition at night, figuring out their camping locations and approximate troop numbers.

Years of fighting allowed him to quickly control his emotions—once unable to control, he could lose his life on the battlefield in minutes. Of the good brothers who came out of the stockade with him back then, few were still alive.

It had been several years since he took the brothers to follow the Australians to be soldiers for the sake of pursuing Bi Da. Although since parting by the river, he never saw this woman he thought of day and night again.

Although under the same Australian banner, Bi Da was far out of reach. Before coming out of the mountain, Zhen Huan had no concept of how big the Senate's team was. In his past thinking, Australians were nothing more than similar to the Big Sea Lords in merchants' mouths, having a dozen ships and at most a few thousand people. As long as time was abundant, there would always be a day to meet.

However, after coming out of the mountain, he realized his vision was too small. Being a soldier seemingly opened a door to a vast new world for him. In these years his footsteps trod all over Hainan Island; he also took the ship he couldn't dream of to Kaohsiung to "punish" local natives... witnessing the grotesqueness of the world outside the mountain, also witnessing countless joys and sorrows of the human world, and even experiencing many life-and-death crises. His knowledge was already different from the "Little Overlord" in the stockade back then. These years he also took leave to return to the village stockade, but already had no common language with people in the stockade. The only concern for the village stockade life initially was Bi Da.

Unexpectedly, he would meet her on this Yao area battlefield in Guangdong today! Just by the river where they camped, the person he thought of day and night was walking and talking with several men and women wearing naturalized cadre uniforms.

Parting for a few years, Bi Da's appearance didn't change much, only her hair was cut short, wearing an administrative staff uniform, carrying a canvas bag—ordinarily no different from "female cadres" seen everywhere on Lingao streets.

Although the person he thought of day and night all these years was less than tens of meters away from him, and he had fantasized about the scene of reuniting with her countless times, drafting the words to say many times in his belly... But when she was really in front of his eyes, Zhen Huan didn't know how to face her—timid due to being near to the loved one.

Thinking again that he had accepted the order to go reconnoiter, he didn't disturb Bi Da and turned away quietly.

This time for reconnaissance he only brought five soldiers of the Li-Miao Company. The reconnaissance location was both banks of the Xingzi River under Lianzhou City. Under the cover of night, Zhen Huan's squad took a small boat found by the river, rowing north into the Xingzi River, landing quietly north of Lianzhou City.

They didn't stay long near the Lianzhou city wall, but went all the way north towards the North Mountain. According to Yang Zeng's judgment, the Yao people would probably choose to deploy their main force in a place that was both conducive to concealment and conducive to supporting various city gates. And Yanxi Mountain was such a place. As a commanding height, one could easily observe the dynamics inside the city. The dense forest was conducive to hiding troops. And it could support various city gates within half an hour.

Sure enough, the reconnaissance team discovered the camping ground of the Yao big unit on the mountainside of Yanxi Mountain. The Yao armed forces obviously didn't realize hiding smoke and fire. The firelight appearing and disappearing in the forest exposed their position.

Zhen Huan led the squad to approach slowly towards the firelight. He noticed a raised small hillock near the camp, so he commanded the squad to sneak there.

He reminded the point man: "Watch your feet!"

Whether as a Li person himself, or fighting in mountains these years, he knew the combat habits of mountain peoples well: hunting traps and ground crossbows were often arranged around camping grounds. The Fubo Army squads often suffered such losses during punitive actions in Hainan and Taiwan. Once hit, not only would the ambushed person be seriously injured or die, but it would also alarm the enemies inside the camping ground.

Sure enough, at a place less than a hundred meters from the camping ground, the point man discovered a bamboo spike trap. Although the depth didn't pass the calf, hidden fire-hardened bamboo spikes could easily pierce through a soldier's foot and calf. Even without poison, one would end up half disabled. Moreover, these bamboo spikes were mostly coated with arrow poison customarily used by Liangguang Yao people.

They dismantled the trap carefully. Within a few steps they discovered a tripwire—this was the trigger mechanism of a ground crossbow. After removing the tripwire, they soon found a third trap... In just a hundred meters of road, they encountered a dozen various traps. Zhen Huan was secretly surprised: The enemy is very vigilant!
