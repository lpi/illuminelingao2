# Chapter 2200 - Discussing Conditions

Great Ming's policy of pacifying Yao had great randomness, often depending on the personal ability of local officials. However, in peaceful times, the attitude of local officials towards Yao people was often two extremes. One was: "Liangguang officials only strive for temporary ease, with no military preparations," turning a blind eye to various small-scale looting and infringements by Yao people, even suppressing local commoners and not allowing them to sue. Even after Yao people rose to riot and looted wantonly, local officials were helpless and could only "prepare red flowers, beef, and wine to soothe them." The second extreme was the opposite, extorting and blackmailing the Yao stockades that had already been pacified in every way, exploiting and humiliating them, "even bullying their remoteness and lack of appeal, picking quarrels cruelly, inverting right and wrong, both harming their lives and thwarting their nature."

Li Sanjiu had been beside *Lang* people Tusi for a long time and knew much about the mentality and style of Great Ming officials. In his view, since Australians called themselves Great Song, they were also Han people—he knew the style of Han officials too well.

In his more than ten years of military experience, whenever generals sent troops to fight, unless the military power was dangerous, it was invariably a good opportunity to get rich. This Australian "Great Song" was probably also like this. This Lianzhou City, after all, belonged to Great Ming. Great Song's generals had no responsibility to defend the soil, so they probably wouldn't go to rescue very enthusiastically—they were so fast, nothing more than fancying the children, jade, and silk in the city. This matter, he, Li Sanjiu, wasn't unable to discuss. Don't look at Yao people going down the mountain to loot every few days; what they actually sought was nothing more than daily necessities like salt, grain, and iron. As for other items, if this Australian officer covered them, it wasn't impossible for him to part with them—compared to his ambition, what did this little children, jade, and silk count for?

If Australians wanted to pacify, he would submit. Not only submit, but also send a large amount of gifts. If Australians wanted to suppress, he would drill into the big mountains and fight guerrilla warfare with them, making Australians have a headache—finally having to pacify.

Since the Australians had already come, he also had to express his sincerity.

He found a confidant with good water skills, whispered a few sentences, and let him swim across to the west bank.

Huang Chao heard an envoy came to see him. He really couldn't believe it a bit: this rebel leader would actively look for him to negotiate peace.

The Eight Row Yao riots in history lasted long and affected a large range, showing the leaders' attitude was very "firm." Why, when it came to his place, the other party wanted to come to discuss pacification so quickly?

In Huang Chao's heart, naturally, he hoped to fight less and die fewer people. The other party asking for peace talks was not inappropriate—at least he could listen to the other party's thoughts and incidentally understand the details.

Guards escorted the searched envoy in. The envoy was also obedient; entering the tent, he immediately knelt and kowtowed, reporting his name as Li Wu, coming to see "Great Song General" by order of "Lianyang Yao Stockade General Palm Matter Head Li Sanjiu."

Naturally, this title of Li Sanjiu was compiled by himself. Although the Eight Row Yao troops under Lianzhou City were all commanded by him, he was just a temporary coalition commander. Except for Majian Row's able-bodied men, able-bodied men of other rows all had their own Palm Matter Heads. Fighting wars was "listening to dispatch but not announcement."

"Stand up and speak." Huang Chao looked at the comer. Short and shrewd, able to speak fluent Guangdong Mandarin, obviously not an ordinary Yao person.

He already knew the name Li Sanjiu from the mouths of Yonghua Township Yao people. But their news was relatively simple, only knowing this person "had been an official" and only returned to Majian Row not long ago, being very trusted. This troop dispatch was all managed by him generally.

Li Wu got up respectfully, his heart settled halfway—although there was the saying "don't kill envoys," during war, being an envoy was a high-risk profession. Maybe one would be beheaded as a spy; such things happened often in the past.

He secretly sized up "Great Song General" in the tent. He saw the tent was crowded with people darkly. There were neither "Tiger Table" nor "Flags and Plaques of Royal Order." As for the man surrounded sitting behind a big table, he also had no general's style at all. An ordinary man, wearing Australian coarse cloth jacket, neither wearing armor nor gauze cap and boots and robe. If not for opening his mouth to ask questions, he simply couldn't recognize him from a pile of people. He followed Li Sanjiu to fight back then and saw the pomp of Great Ming generals. In comparison, this Great Song General was tight with shabbiness.

"I am Great Song Lianyang Recruitment and Pacification Commissioner concurrent Prefect of Lianzhou Military Affairs Huang Chao," Huang Chao read his official title in one breath. "Since you came by order, what exactly do you want to say? Just say it!"

Li Wu was a bit nervous. He looked up slightly and saw quite a few people squeezed in the tent darkly. He recognized a few people: Tianchang Gong and Palm Matter Heads of several stockades of Yonghua Yao people—he was slightly stunned. Didn't these Yonghua Yao people already submit to Li Sanjiu? How did they turn around and surrender to Australians? Could it be that the Yangshan side had already completely lost?

Surprised as he was, Li Wu still tried his best to maintain calm, only his attitude when speaking became a few points more humble:

"Our Palm Matter Head said: Great Song also fights the Ming Kingdom. Our Lianyang Yao people also don't want to receive the jurisdiction of the Ming Kingdom, so we rose to rebel. Lianyang Yao people have no intention to be enemies with Great Song. If the General is willing to help us break Lianzhou City, we Eight Row Yao people don't want any of the children, jade, and silk in the city, all offering to the General. We only ask to allow us to transport away salt, grain, and iron tools in the city. Lianzhou City also belongs to Great Song's jurisdiction."

This condition, according to Li Sanjiu's view, was very generous—compared to wealth, he now valued "name" more. As long as Great Song could acknowledge his power to rule the Lianyang area, what did a mere Lianzhou City count for?

*I want it all.* Huang Chao almost blurted out this sentence. If he really wanted to grab Lianzhou City, he didn't need to help Eight Row Yao; he could handle it just relying on the National Army. But grabbing was impossible. The Fubo Army wasn't the Ming army that would do anything.

"Absurd! Truly absurd! You barbarians also dare to come to discuss conditions with our Great Song." Zhou Liangchen jumped up. Don't look at his short time of surrendering and his seniority being below various naturalized citizens in the command, in attitude, he feared he wasn't "firm" enough. This time he followed Huang Chao to Lianzhou, although only as an "Advisor," no one discussed specific situations with him. But from Huang Chao and others' usual talk and arrangement, he knew Australians were definitely not masters willing to fudge with "recruitment and pacification" for temporary peace. So at this moment, he immediately stepped forward to rebuke the envoy.

Huang Chao signaled him not to interrupt. Zhou Liangchen shut his mouth tactfully immediately.

"Is there anything else?" Huang Chao ignored the first condition mentioned by Li Wu for the time being, wondering what else Eight Row Yao wanted.

"As long as Great Song is willing to canonize our Ma Jian Row's Li Sanjiu as the Native Subprefect of Lianyang Three Cities, hereditary without replacement, he will immediately lead Eight Rows and Twenty-Four Hollows to submit to Great Song. Lianzhou City will also be offered with both hands, without wanting any war trophies."

This condition made Huang Chao laugh and cry. Seeing Zhou Liangchen looking eager to try, he winked at him.

"Being a Subprefect, funny. Is that Li Sanjiu literate?"

"Not being a Subprefect is also fine. Tusi, Lianzhou Pacification Commissioner also work—whatever title Great Song is willing to confer is fine."

Huang Chao shook his head secretly: If conferring a Tusi could stabilize a region and comfort the people, there wouldn't be the Bozhou Riot, She-An Riot, and Sha-Pu Riot continuously in the late Ming, and the Qing Dynasty in the old timeline wouldn't need to carry out Reform of Native Chieftains (Gaitu Guiliu) and conquer Jinchuan.

The leash system like Tusi, in the final analysis, was a "last resort" method under the state of insufficient strength. It could gain temporary peace in the short term, but in the long term, it would inevitably become too big to control.

"You go down first." Huang Chao didn't answer his proposal. He waved his hand and let guards take Li Wu down. Then he signaled a group of surrendered people to all go out, leaving only naturalized cadres.

"What do you think of this Li Sanjiu's suggestion?"

"Naturally, it cannot be agreed to." Yang Zeng said, "If agreed, what are we still doing here?!"

"Correct. However, it can be seen his appetite isn't small."

"Chief, I think this matter can be utilized."

The speaker was named Fu Debang, the naturalized Lianzhou County Magistrate preparing to take office in Lianzhou.

He suggested agreeing to Li Sanjiu's condition for request of title first to exchange for relieving the siege of Lianzhou. Wait until their vigilance weakened, then take the opportunity of "canonization" to catch them all in one net.

Huang Chao shook his head repeatedly: "This matter is inappropriate."

Fu Debang still lacked a trace of cautious sensitivity in politics. From the perspective of stratagem, this could be considered an excellent strategy. However, they were not mountain bandits or pirates; they couldn't trample on faith and righteousness without bottom line like this. Rulers should cherish their feathers as much as possible and do fewer treacherous deeds. Fu Debang still had deficiencies in this aspect; he should point it out to him when there was a chance.

"Let the Li-Miao Working Team find someone to interrogate this Li Wu properly," Huang Chao said. "Especially this Li Sanjiu's personal situation."

Then he let others retreat, leaving only Yang Zeng to discuss the combat strategy. The two studied the map. The West Bank River and Xingzi River converged into the Lian River west of Lianzhou City. Except for a few mountains like Yanxi Mountain, North Mountain, and Jinfeng Mountain, the vicinity of Lianzhou City was flat land. Yang Zeng's plan was: except leaving one National Army unit to guard the Lian River ferry, the remaining troops would cross the West Bank River to the north first, then cross the Xingzi River to the east, with a company of Fubo Army as the vanguard, outflanking and surrounding Yanxi Mountain.

The reason for choosing to cross West Bank and Xingzi Rivers from the north instead of crossing the river at the Lian River in the south was that the West Bank River and Xingzi River were narrow in width, shallow in depth, and small in flow, convenient for building temporary floating bridges to let large units pass quickly. The structure of the prepared floating bridge was very simple, using collected small boats as bases and covering with wooden boards—even without equipping engineers, it wasn't a difficult thing.

"This battle actually has no difficulty. Their equipment level is very poor—not even as good as Ming troops, and not many firearms." Yang Zeng said, "The key point is to annihilate completely. Annihilating this main force of Eight Row Yao, Eight Row Yao will have no conditions to discuss recruitment and pacification—only surrender."

Minority nationalities fighting wars often had all able-bodied men coming out. Often the mobilization rate was very high; very few population could pull out a large number of men and horses. However, once annihilated, they would lose the ability to sustain combat.
