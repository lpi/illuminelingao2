# Chapter 2279: Looking for a Breach

Yi Haoran, having made up his mind to take the Cai Lan route, put effort into Qi Liheng. This Qi Liheng was also a seed of reading; although young, he was very intelligent. In just half a month, he memorized a "Hundred Family Surnames" fluently, and "Thousand Character Classic" also started, recognizing two or three hundred characters.

Although Qiuchan suffered pain of losing husband, seeing son intelligent and fond of learning, more or less felt comforted, respecting Yi Haoran increasingly. Seeing food in shop ordinary, every three or five days she inevitably made one or two side dishes herself, accompanied by maiden home brother, sending to shop to offer meals to Yi Haoran. Sometimes maiden family members had no time, she came herself. Seeing Yi Haoran’s clothes ragged, modified late husband's old clothes gave him.

If in normal times, Qiuchan’s action counted as quite "loose"; but her family was originally merchant family, originally didn't care about these much. Moreover after great chaos, social atmosphere often relaxed; various "Ethical Code Relaxed" matters emerged endlessly. Qiuchan’s actions instead didn't count as much out of line.

Yi Haoran took opportunity to inquire about Cai Lan’s situation from her. Jiang Qiuchan didn't suspect other things, told her experience of being "accompanying woman" in detail entirely to him.

Since Cai Lan was released from prison, detained temporarily in Earth God Temple, shortly lost sharpness. She was originally just from humble family jasper background; since childhood didn't suffer hardship nor had much experience. After family declined, had to travel thousands of *li* to throw herself to fiance, yet encountered Wuzhou falling, fiance committing suicide. Under dead end, arose thought of assassinating Hair thief head, then martyring for husband to die.

The strike with full strength before Dragon Mother Temple already exhausted all her sharpness. Waiting until suffering bitter beating in big prison, torturing a usually spoiled little woman till soul flew and spirit scattered; truly so-called seeking life cannot, seeking death cannot. Waiting until Xie Erren released her for preferential treatment, although heart still regarded him as "Husband Killing Enemy," secretly added a few points of gratitude.

Detained in Earth God Temple for several days, not only treated her injuries, but let her bathe and change clothes, supplying good food daily. Originally Cai Lan still feared this Xie Hair thief plotted misconduct, refusing to wear sent good clothes, only wearing own old clothes; at night dared not undress to sleep, sharpening hairpin to hide secretly on body, preparing to use this to commit suicide once this Hair thief came to force rape.

Didn't expect this Cai Lan waited bitterly for many days; Hair thief seemed to forget her generally, showing no face at all. This way, the air of firmness she gathered with difficulty leaked again. Days long, will wore down, no longer had heart of necessary death.

Xie Erren heard her spirit dissipated, no longer persisting in wearing past old clothes and broken shirt, knew already five or six points done. So moved her from yamen to Three Headquarters—there not only houses numerous, environment also much better than prefecture yamen.

"...She now lives alone in one small courtyard inside. Living daily life acts are all preferential; also has servant girls and women to serve. Just days passing depressing, daily can only amuse self with calligraphy and painting. I go inside to accompany her, she seems very happy. Just sighing from time to time..." Jiang Qiuchan said.

Yi Haoran listened carefully, asked again: "In your opinion, is this Cai Lan finding favor with Australian?"

Qiuchan jumped a fright. Because this Mr. Yi consistently had face of modest gentleman, never asking about such domestic gossip matters; now suddenly came such a sentence.

Yi Haoran also felt his asking somewhat abrupt, but this was a matter had to ask. His brain turned, suddenly remembered: This Chang Qingyun was also this Jiang Qiuchan’s benefactor. He could greatly utilize this point.

He pretended to be deeply pained saying: "Sigh, this matter I originally shouldn't ask much. This Miss Cai is also a bitter fate person. Just right now there is a difficult matter, must seek help from her to work."

Qiuchan seeing benefactor speaking with solemn face, believed seven or eight points. Hurriedly asked: "Don't know what difficult matter Sir means?"

"Student's colleague originally in Governor Xiong Shogunate together, Master Chang Qingyun..."

"What? Master Chang has whereabouts?" Qiuchan excited.

Chang Qingyun had grace on Qiuchan. Back then if not he stood out, Qiuchan would have been insulted on street long ago—in this era where woman's reputation integrity greater than life, Chang Qingyun’s grace was even bigger than Yi Haoran. Although a frail woman, she was a person daring to act and having affection and righteousness; absolutely wouldn't disregard benefactor in trouble.

"En." Yi Haoran nodded with pretended heaviness, "Master Chang failed breakout, now captured by Hair thieves, imprisoned in Sanheui parade ground..." He stopped deliberately, sighed.

"How is it?" Jiang Qiuchan surely chased asking, "Master Chang could it be has some mishap?"

"He is a *Juren* Master, also Governor Xiong’s advisor friend. Hair thieves hate scholars most. He a *Juren* in camp can have what good fruit to eat?" Yi Haoran heavily said, "Suffering abuse fully, dragging out feeble existence only."

"So it is like this." Jiang Qiuchan instantly put on heart, twisting handkerchief tightly with hands, "Just suffering for him."

"Few days ago I got news, saying Master Chang suffered much torture in camp, now body not good, lying sick in bed. I dragged many people, today finally could mix into camp, seeing his appearance, truly can be called bone standing shape dissolved. Continuing like this, probably life not long!"

"So it is like this!" Jiang Qiuchan said, "Master wants to save Master Chang..."

"Student indeed has this intention." Yi Haoran nodded, "Just you also know, I am here, nothing more than a fish slipping through net; being able to keep self safe is considered upper Upper Great Luck; where still have spare strength to save him! Only can open another path—if Miss Cai finds favor with True Australian Senator, if she can open mouth, maybe can release Master Chang out."

This speech was leaking no water, couldn't help Jiang Qiuchan not believe. Sure enough, her face dyed a layer of worry.

"Sir says right. Master Chang in trouble, by emotion by reason, Servant should exert effort to save. Just this matter fear cannot be achieved in one step." Qiuchan said, "Although True Australian Senator Xie supplies with brocade clothes and jade food. Yet Miss Cai is unhappy daily, often weeping. Moreover Servant goes to her place, always go in morning, leave before dusk. Whether she receives grace and favor, Servant isn't clear, nor dare to ask."

"Then usually you getting along with her, do what?"

"Nothing special either. Accompanying her talking to relieve boredom, also doing needlework together, playing chess, playing leaf cards. Sometimes also accompany her painting." Qiuchan frowned, trying hard to recall, "Actually she speaks very little, rarely saying her own things. Servant dare not ask much either."

"Never mentioned True Australian's matter?"

"Not a single sentence said." Qiuchan said.

"Then her fiancée?"

"Also not mentioned." Qiuchan frowned, "Just suddenly shedding tears from time to time."

"Then usually is her makeup and appearance tidy?"

"Actually tidy..." Qiuchan saying, suddenly said, "Speaking so, she must..."

"Yes," Yi Haoran nodded, "Allow Student to ask one abrupt sentence again. In your opinion, is Cai Lan still virgin body?"

This was somewhat hard to answer; not only involved personal privacy, also concerned reputation integrity. Qiuchan pondered for a moment, said: "No."

"That is it." Yi Haoran patted his hand with fan, "Cai Lan’s fiancée I recognize; most upright gentleman. Back then Cai Lan came to throw to him; because war was dangerous, he feared just in case he met mishap, delaying her, so refused to marry her completely. So never consummated."

"So it is like this." Qiuchan thoughtful, "She is also a bitter fate woman..."

"Cai Lan is also involuntary. Humans are not sages, how can be without fault? Naturally need not blame harsh." Yi Haoran knew Qiuchan also had a sad story; couldn't blame with Great Righteousness; otherwise once pushing others to self, arising rebellious heart this matter would fail, "If like this, she going to open mouth to Senator Xie, has several points of certainty."

"Yes," Qiuchan said, "To rescue Master Chang, Servant definitely exerts effort. Only Cai Lan’s mood good and bad at times, other things easy to say, this asking Australian matter, fear not so easy. Wait for Servant to think a method carefully..."

Yi Haoran nodded: "You are a woman hero, this matter Student trusts you. However, this Master Chang is different from ordinary captives. Just in case has slip, you are local person, having family and mouth, fear will harm you. This matter, better let me open mouth." Seeing Qiuchan doubtful, he explained, "I told you, I have old ties with her fiancée Xing Chenghuan. In my hand still have folding fan with inscription gifted by Mr. Xing back then. If can meet face to face, definitely can persuade her..."

Naturally, Yi Haoran couldn't really ask Qiuchan to do this matter, because Chang Qingyun’s days were passing very well, no "bone standing shape dissolved" at all. Besides Chang Qingyun trying to run actually wasn't hard, didn't need this trouble at all.

Qiuchan secretly moved by his consideration, but somewhat hesitated: "Master says, Servant naturally believes. But Master is a man, how can enter her courtyard? Just saying this Three Headquarters, entering gate needs checking waist pass..."

"I naturally cannot enter, but she can come out."

"Come out?" Qiuchan doubted, "She is like under house arrest in Three Headquarters, stepping not out of courtyard. Person also depressed and unhappy..."

"Not stepping out of courtyard, is it True Australian forbidding her to go out?"

"This actually no," Qiuchan remembered something, "Few days ago Senator Xie sent people to ask, if she wanted to go out for a walk—he sends people to escort. Just Cai Lan unwilling."

"That is it." Yi Haoran secretly said Heaven helps me! "You just need to persuade her to go out to burn incense. I see Dragon Mother Temple outside city is an excellent place."

Women in situations like Cai Lan mostly had bitter depression in heart; impossible to have interest in touring mountains and playing water. But burning incense and worshipping gods had very good comfort to their bitter depressive psychology.

"She is outsider, probably doesn't know Dragon Mother Temple’s efficacy. You are native born and bred Wuzhou local; presumably know many efficacious anecdotes of Dragon Mother Temple. Talk more to her, instigate her to burn incense; mostly will be willing to go."
