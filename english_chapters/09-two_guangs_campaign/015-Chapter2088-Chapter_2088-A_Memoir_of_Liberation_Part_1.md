# Chapter 2088 - A Memoir of Liberation (Part 1)

From Yuejiang Tower, Xiong Wenchan lowered his telescope, his hands trembling slightly. Chang Qingyun said in a low voice: "Your Excellency, there's no time to lose..."

Before he could finish, a tremendous roar erupted from the river. The *Zhujiang's* main gun spat a column of thick smoke toward the sky. A shell soared upward, screaming shrilly as it arced down toward Zhaoqing.

I was born in Gaoyao County of the former Zhaoqing Prefecture, Guangdong. I was the second son, so my childhood nickname was "Liu Erzai"—Second Boy Liu. My family were military households; generation after generation, we were soldiers. Young comrades today probably don't understand and assume military households were proud soldiers, distinguished and admired. That's not how it was, comrades. The glory of military service belongs to our epoch-making Fubo Army. In the old society, the saying went: "Good iron isn't made into nails; good men don't become soldiers." Being a soldier meant being looked down upon, just like peasants and craftsmen—and in some ways, military households were even more oppressed than ordinary commoners.

Under the false Ming, military households were divided into ranks. Those like *baihu* commanders were naturally distinguished and well-fed, with hereditary offices passed down through generations. But ordinary military households? They were, euphemistically speaking, the lords' tenant laborers. In truth, they were the lords' slaves—exploited and oppressed just like us. They too were among those the Fubo Army came to liberate.

My family had it slightly better than some, because my grandfather had once served as a servant to a *baihu* household and had helped raise the future *baihu*, Sun Shiwan. Because of this connection, the Sun family remembered my family's service and treated us with some consideration. Thus we bore lighter oppression. But others weren't so fortunate. Most of my childhood playmates were military household children, and their families were desperately poor. After a year of backbreaking labor for Sun Shiwan, they'd receive only a few hundred *jin* of grain—barely enough to survive. For this reason, ordinary commoners were unwilling to marry into military households—who wants their daughter to suffer poverty and abuse? As a commoner, if you stayed out of the cities and never encountered officials, you'd suffer less oppression. But military households labored every day under their officers' eyes: toiling until exhausted wasn't enough; the slightest defiance meant "military discipline"—dozens of strokes with the rod, skin torn and flesh split. Being beaten to death wasn't uncommon. The dead were simply dragged out and buried in the wilderness—worse than household slaves.

So many military households fled. Our garrison originally had over a hundred military households—one soldier per household meant over a hundred troops. But by the time I was born, only twenty or thirty households remained. The scene was one of utter decay. Apart from *Baihu* Sun Shiwan's family, even the *zongqi* and *xiaoqi* (company and squad leaders) who counted as "officers" lived in poverty.

With life so bleak, military households became reckless; discipline was utterly corrupt. Those who enlisted as garrison troops ran from real enemies swift as the wind, but pillaged their own people with fire-like ferocity—completely lacking any awareness of protecting the people with weapons in hand. In their home garrison, neighbors knew neighbors, so they couldn't go too far. But outside troops? Strangers in unfamiliar territory would loot and harass civilians. I was "fortunate" to witness this once.

I had a close friend named Hou Haisheng—I called him Brother Hai. His mother's surname was Hou; his father's surname was Hai, and he'd married into the family as an in-law. The maternal grandfather's family had run a pork shop in Zhaoqing for generations—they'd lived decently. But his mother was a gambler, lost everything, and hanged herself. His father fell ill from grief and was bedridden. Brother Hai barely managed to keep things together, scraping by with nothing to spare for schooling. Yet even Brother Hai, struggling as he was, got tangled up with Guangxi troops. That year the Fubo Army had just won the great victory at Chengmai. When news reached Zhaoqing, everyone was panicked. The then-Governor-General of Liangguang, Wang Zunde—the very man who'd started the war—was terrified of the Council's retribution and transferred the Wuzhou garrison to reinforce Zhaoqing. The Guangxi soldiers had no fighting spirit whatsoever. They never trained; once in Zhaoqing, they just went out looting shops and harassing women. The "wolf soldiers" among them not only robbed but killed at will. Everyone lived in fear.

We constantly heard: such-and-such shop was smashed; such-and-such young wife was assaulted; soldiers killed someone here or there—the whole city was chaos, chickens flying and dogs jumping. My sisters at home smeared soot on their faces and hid indoors. One day I went to deliver firewood to Brother Hai's family. I'd barely exchanged a few words with Uncle Hai when a neighbor burst in, saying Brother Hai was fighting with Guangxi soldiers. I later learned that three Guangxi soldiers had taken his pork without paying. Brother Hai was stubborn—he grabbed one by the collar and demanded payment. The soldier said: "I don't even pay when I visit whores—your few pounds of pork mean nothing!" And they started brawling.

I was frantic, afraid the soldiers would kill him—these military thugs wouldn't hesitate. I ran home, gathered friends, grabbed clubs and pikes, and rushed to the scene. Brother Hai was big and strong, holding his own one against three. We hurried over to "break it up," locking arms to separate them while giving the three soldiers a good beating in the confusion. Before they could return with reinforcements, we hid Brother Hai and his father at my house. The soldiers couldn't find their target and didn't dare cause trouble at the local garrison, so they just smashed Brother Hai's shop to vent. Later Wang Zunde was literally frightened to death by the Council, the Guangxi troops withdrew to Wuzhou, and the matter was dropped.

Brother Hai later enlisted with me. He served the Council and the people with distinction, but sadly sacrificed his life in the liberation of Manila, never seeing final victory. That farewell in Guangzhou became forever!
