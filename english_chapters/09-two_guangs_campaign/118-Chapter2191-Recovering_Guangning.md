# Chapter 2191 - Recovering Guangning

Just as the troops marched ten kilometers through the mountains carrying ammunition, transporting shells and gunpowder to the artillery position outside Guangning City, the scout team sent back a message: Guangning City seemed to have no enemy defense.

The top of the city wall was completely empty, without a single guard. Scouts observed the city from nearby hilltops with telescopes and also didn't find any signs of enemy troops gathering near the city wall.

Yang Zeng, who had already arrived at the forward command post, was secretly puzzled, thinking *are they playing the "Empty Fort Strategy"?* Just as he was about to instruct the scouts to "reconnoiter closely," suddenly the always tightly closed Guangning city gates opened by themselves. A large group of commoners came out of Guangning City beating gongs and drums, walking towards the confused Sui River Detachment. A middle-aged man dressed as a Confucian scholar at the front bowed with tears and mucus flowing from a distance, shouting something like "The whole city's people invite the Great Song Celestial Troops to enter the city."

"Could this be the enemy's trick, to lure us into the city for a 'Burning of Xinye'?" Huang Chao muttered.

Yang Zeng sent people to bring over the lead "Elders." He could be considered to have seen quite a few "local Elders," but this was the first time seeing such wretched ones. Each one had a bruised nose and swollen face, and their clothes were torn in several places.

The "local Elders" were searched before being brought before Yang Zeng and the others. Several people all prostrated on the ground, each reporting their names, "inviting the Celestial Troops to enter the city quickly."

Such eagerness was truly suspicious. Yang Zeng ordered a company to occupy various city gates and gate towers, and a company to enter the city to search, while questioning the "Elders" about the fall of the county seat.

It turned out that Guangning had fallen three days ago. At that time, there were bandits making trouble in the county. The Guangning County Director sent the 2nd Squadron to suppress the riot. Guangning County's original establishment only had one squadron of the National Army, and the 3rd Platoon was deployed at Shijian. With this arrangement, only the 1st Platoon and the newly formed "County Militia Team" were left in the county seat. The number was about two hundred people.

Given the sturdiness of Guangning's city defense, closing the city gates meant two hundred people were enough to resist the harassment of general bandits and chaotic soldiers, not to mention there was a fully armed National Army platoon. So when the news that a large group of bandits and chaotic soldiers were coming from Hezhou arrived, the County Director and the Squadron Leader were not too nervous. They sent people to Shijian to contact them to watch out for enemy situations, while closing the city gates and preparing for battle.

However, three days ago, part of the militia team in the city suddenly mutinied and opened the city gates. The bandits outside the city swarmed in. The National Army Squadron Leader hurriedly led the platoon to counter-attack, but suddenly died in battle. Part of the National Army soldiers surrendered on the spot, and the rest fought and retreated, finally breaking out and escaping with some militia personnel by opening the city gates.

"How many people ran away?" Yang Zeng asked.

"About a hundred or so." The middle-aged Confucian scholar said tremblingly, "This lowly one didn't see, just heard people say so."

"Where are the cadres in the county?"

"Heard... heard..." The middle-aged Confucian scholar was a bit afraid, in case this "Hair" chieftain vented his anger on his head, he would be doomed eternally.

"Heard what? Speak quickly!"

"Yes, yes, the cadres in the city, it is rumored that some fled with the Celestial Troops. The Magistrate and six others were trapped—that day... that day..."

"Killed?"

"Yes, right at the intersection of Cross Street," The middle-aged Confucian scholar shrank his neck, fearing thunderous anger would descend. "...Student, Student and the gentry in the city have collected the corpses, now all resting in the temple..."

Yang Zeng and others inquired carefully and learned that after the bandits entered the city, they caught seven naturalized cadres headed by the County Director. All were beheaded and executed at the intersection. They also beheaded all captured militia and wounded National Army soldiers, allegedly to "report merit." The next day, they killed several committee members of the County Consultative Council and merchants, and caught quite a few "treacherous people" who "attached to the Hair" to behead. In total, more than a hundred people were killed.

Although the incoming bandits claimed to be "government troops," their military discipline was extremely poor. Besides demanding various "offerings" after entering the city, stragglers committed all kinds of crimes: arson, murder, rape, and looting money. Almost all merchants and gentry in the city were harmed by them. Ordinary commoners were also trampled by them quite a bit.

Last night, the bandits suddenly started looting the whole city and captured many women. Early this morning, they opened the city gates and fled.

"...We awaited the Celestial Troops like withered fields awaiting sweet rain." After the middle-aged Confucian scholar finished "crying his complaint" with snot and tears, Huang Chao and Yang Zeng's faces were already iron-blue. Yang Zeng said: "Let's go, we enter the city!"

Entering the city, it was a mess inside. Every household had doors wide open; shops along the street were all smashed and looted empty. There were still corpses lying on the streets.

Survivors gathered on both sides of the road with fear on their faces to "welcome the Celestial Troops." These days they had suffered enough from the bandits' poisoning. Whether poor or rich, they all had great goodwill towards this regime they didn't understand before and only accepted passively—the contrast was simply too stark!

Although they suffered heavy losses from bandit looting, the commoners still set up wine and food by the roadside to show their intentions.

Yang Zeng and others came to the Cross Street intersection, only to see spots of blood on the sandstone slabs, a large black patch. Thinking of the comrades killed here a few days ago, indignation filled his heart—*if only we knew the situation here earlier! Even if the whole army force-marched until legs broke, we would have come.*

Huang Chao's feeling was different from his. Besides anger, an inexplicable fear welled up from the bottom of his heart. Although there were no corpses, the cold reality and the blood all over the ground reminded him that the situation he had to face was a hundred times more difficult than the "Pacifying the Li" in Hainan back then, and the cruelty was unprecedented. He took a deep breath to calm down, but somehow felt the air was full of the smell of blood. He couldn't help retching twice.

The corpses of the killed cadres and National Army soldiers had been collected by local "Elders" using simple coffins. Yang Zeng sent people to take a look; they said all were missing heads.

"Where are the heads of the martyrs?" Yang Zeng pressed the middle-aged Confucian scholar.

"The heads were originally hung at the County Yamen and the four city gates. They were all collected last night; probably taken away."

Heads were important props for recording merit; it wasn't surprising they were taken away. Yang Zeng was helpless. He instructed people to find a piece of land on high ground outside the city to bury the victimized cadres and soldiers. Hearing that the people in the city suffered heavily, Huang Chao instructed to set up porridge sheds locally to dispense porridge and clothes. He also personally went to offer condolences to the killed committee members of the County Consultative Council. Some committee members' homes were looted empty, and surviving family members were cold and hungry; he instructed to take all these people in and send them to Lingao for support.

From them, they learned that the one commanding this force was a scribe named Li Cungu. Although a scribe, he was bloodthirsty like a maniac. Once entering the city, not counting killing captives and "pro-Hair" local commoners, he also slaughtered their families, not even sparing the old and young, killing off more than ten households in one breath. It was only because the gentry and big households in the county jointly pleaded that the families of several Consultative Council members, who were originally to be killed off, were saved.

As for the militia team acting as insiders to open the door and part of the National Army surrendering to the enemy, which Huang Chao and others cared about most, the locals knew very little. They only knew that the ones who opened the city gate were a few young men in the militia team, all idlers in the county. As for their subsequent life or death, it was unclear; presumably, they fled with the bandits.

"The names of these people must all be recorded and wanted forever!" Huang Chao said indignantly.

However, relying only on these few plain names, without photos or fingerprints, and in an era of constant war, the possibility of catching them in the sea of people was extremely small. The only thing Huang Chao could comfort himself with was that since they ran with the bandits, maybe they had already lost their lives in battle.

To ensure Guangning's safety, the Sui River Detachment built another stockade on the bank of the Sui River north of Baoding Mountain to choke the road to Huaiji. The brought-along Guangning Battalion was responsible for the safety of the county seat and surrounding transportation nodes with the 1st Squadron and remnants of the original Guangning Squadron. At the same time, an infantry company was sent to Huaiji to establish contact with the local garrison, especially to gather back the troops and cadres who fled from Guangning.

Of the other two squadrons of the Guangning Battalion, one patrolled the interior line between Guangning and the Sui River to ensure smooth communication with the main force; the other maintained order among villages outside the city, gradually expanding the reconnaissance range to guard against enemies coming from the north.

The main force of the Sui River Detachment immediately set out for Huaiji. Originally, whether Huang Chao or Yang Zeng, they both intended to conduct a large-scale "Public Security Rectification" in Guangning and Huaiqing (Huaiji) to ensure the safety of the communication lines. But judging from the current situation, it no longer allowed them to advance gradually and fight steadily. The troops must reach Lianzhou as soon as possible to suppress the riot.

The Wuzhou Squadron was also left behind as National Army, but they acted as a mobile team, responsible for carrying out Public Security Rectification between Guangning and Huaiji, and simultaneously supporting various squadrons—the Wuzhou Squadron's combat power had been recognized.

The content of internal line Public Security Rectification was very simple, nothing more than circling back and forth on fixed routes. The main purpose was to maintain military presence and deter potential enemies. If there were small-scale riots, they could also be extinguished in time. Doing it was safe with timely supplies. What was relatively dangerous was the outer line patrol. North of Guangning was after all outside the control zone, plus the surroundings were all mountainous areas prone to ambush. The main work was actually following guides along the road from one village to another. At each place, they posted printed notices, summoned villagers to preach, called village elders to explain policies and assign tasks... Because civil affairs cadres were insufficient and Guangning was not in the recent occupation plan, these jobs were makeshift done by officers. Staff Officer Li Song was sent to the Wuzhou Squadron to guide work and compile documents, to avoid errors during future handover.

If the locals cooperated, they could be granted the power to organize militia for self-defense. Local militia would be included in the county militia sequence. At the same time, they were required to pay "Reasonable Burdens." If they didn't cooperate, the village would be broken, and the elders and big households would be arrested as local tyrants and evil gentry resisting the Celestial Troops, sent to the Guangzhou Court for trial—usually sentenced to fines or exile to Kaohsiung.
