# Chapter 2338 - The Hearing (II)

He waited for a few minutes. Although there was buzzing of whispering below, no one raised an objection.

"The *Investigation Report on the Wuzhou Incident* has received the approval of attending Senators, no Senator expressed objection to this. According to relevant investigation reply letters from all stationed-abroad Senators currently received, a two-thirds majority has been formed. Therefore, the Senate resolves to recognize the legality of this report."

Ma Jia read this sentence with cadence. Next was the main event—inquiry.

Sure enough, as soon as Ma Jia announced the start of the inquiry session, immediately someone demanded to speak.

Ma Jia looked intently; it was exactly Hai Lin of the Woodware Factory. He knew this Hai Lin was a senior "Senate Opposition", worthy of being called "Double Jade" (a pair of gems) with Shan Liang back then. Whenever a big event happened, he inevitably demanded opening a hearing. Various "System Questions" and "Reflection Questions" would appear on the BBS every week. For a time he was a figure causing headaches for the Senate.

This time Shan Liang wasn't selected, but Hai Lin was. Ma Jia knew he definitely came prepared, ready to fire cannons.

"Comrade Ma Jia," Hai Lin walked onto the podium, first nodding slightly to Ma Jia in greeting, then turning to greet the audience section, "Comrades!" Attitude polite and courteous, quite having gentlemanly demeanor.

Ma Jia thought, *this Hai Lin also starts to play this set now. Senators' political level these years has indeed improved.*

"Comrade Xie Erren, I have read the report on Wuzhou." Hai Lin said, "To be honest, I am both pained and surprised." Speaking of this he paused for a moment pretending to be deep, "The Senate handed such an important city to you, but what about you? Exactly with what kind of spirit did you do this work? Are you worthy of the trust of the vast number of Senators in you?!"

These words carried a flavor of criticism. Although Xie Erren had mental preparation long ago, inevitably he was made tongue-tied by this heart-condemning question.

But after all he came from a reporter background, having seen many monsters and demons. Calming his mood slightly, he followed the routine considered in advance, putting on a look of remorse and saying: "I indeed am unworthy of the Senate's trust in me, didn't do my own job well. For this Wuzhou riot, I am the first person responsible, nothing good to defend."

Hai Lin originally thought this reporter would inevitably justify with a set of glib rhetoric. Didn't expect him to admit immediately. This somewhat disrupted his plan.

Originally he prepared to "expose Xie Erren's painted skin" through a series of facts, to heat up the hearing atmosphere. But since Senator Xie immediately admitted he was a "demon", this originally planned big play couldn't be sung anymore. Helpless, Hai Lin could only turn the conversation front, starting to talk about the "accountability" issue.

"...Comrades, although the Wuzhou incident is a mistake committed by Comrade Xie Erren personally, do other departments, especially the State Council under the protection of certain people, as well as Organization and Personnel, Intelligence, Public Security and our consistently omnipotent Political Security Bureau have no responsibility? I see not only there is responsibility, but the responsibility is major!"

Dong Shiye whispered: "Started."

Ma Jia nodded slightly: "This is his old prescription unchanged for a thousand years."

He watched Hai Lin's impassioned speech, knowing Hai Lin's ultimate goal was Ma Qianzhu—criticizing Ma the Director thoroughly and making him stink, at least making him "unable to plague the Senate", was his long-term unhidden goal. Of course, this goal was becoming increasingly slim now. Everyone knew now, even if Ma Qianzhu stepped down and left office, the one succeeding as State Secretary if not someone from his team would be at least his close comrade-in-arms.

Sure enough, after a round of impassioned rhetoric of "Rectifying X is imperative", Hai Lin turned the target to Ma Qianzhu's head, expressing that in his many years as State Secretary, serious errors appeared many times. This failure in Wuzhou was even more of a "disaster". Moreover, Ma Qianzhu was one of the "nominator" for Xie Erren serving as Wuzhou Regional Director, and the specific appointment was approved by him. Should bear the primary responsibility.

"...I think, Comrade Ma Qianzhu should take the blame and resign—at least make a public self-criticism!"

Hai Lin finished speaking; a burst of sparse applause came from the seats. Although someone shouted: "Well said!", no one responded, appearing somewhat deserted.

Although the atmosphere wasn't as warm as imagined, it counted as firing the first shot. Next raising hand to speak was Cheng Yongxin. This didn't exceed Ma Jia and others' expectations—she hadn't spoken on public affairs for a long time.

Cheng Yongxin, ever since tumbling in the Maid Case, and hoping to fan the flames by using the Trouble in Lingao matter. After a round of tossing, it wasn't that she didn't gain any benefit at all; at least she was a famous figure in news media now. She very carefully maintained a distance from Du Wen in XX Rights causes, avoiding someone comparing her with Du Wen.

Although her attempt to enter media and influence media was somewhat realized, Ma Jia knew Miss Cheng not long ago XXXXX. Said to be physically and mentally XXXX, once XXXX, finally although XXXX, settling this XX, but XXXX recovering state of mind, so recently had been not very active, belonging to a dormant state.

Speaking at the hearing this time was obviously a signal of her preparing to return to the stage.

Cheng Yongxin's face was slightly pale. After going on stage she first asked Xie Erren a few questions—all about Cai Lan, including how he took in Cai Lan, and how he thought of keeping her by his side.

Although these were contents in the report, Xie Erren answered one by one.

"Fellow Senators," Cheng Yongxin generally didn't use the address "Comrade", "I want to draw everyone's attention to Cai Lan in this case. Although she has now been identified as one of the main participants in the Wuzhou disturbance, and even committed suicide before our investigation team went. However, should we think in reverse, why did she participate in this disturbance?"

Everyone widened their eyes, thinking *what is she saying like this?*

"...Cai Lan assassinating a Senator was originally a serious crime. But since the assassination failed, and Senator Xie used the Senator power in his hand to pardon her crime, then she should have been settled separately or released directly according to relevant regulations. Why take Cai Lan into the room like an object? Could it be that for certain Senators thinking with the lower body, the only function of XX is meat X tool (sex toy)?!"

Ma Jia nodded slightly. Cheng Yongxin's words were not wrong. On the matter of Cai Lan, Xie Erren had serious problems—could even say, many problems of the Wuzhou incident came from his improper handling of Cai Lan! Although her intention might not be here, the observational power to grasp key points was still online.

Cheng Yongxin continued: "Disrespecting XX, objectifying XX, casually degrading and playing with XX has already become common practice within the Senate, and has even formed a kind of unspoken rule, while the broad XX Senators can only swallow their anger..."

Ma Jia knocked the gavel, reminding: "Ms. Cheng, please pay attention to your speech content. We don't oppose everyone expressing opinions freely, but please surround the theme, don't stray too far."

"I am expressing my personal thoughts here. Making you unhappy is really very sorry." Cheng Yongxin spoke with sarcasm, "Fine, since present Senators don't like to hear this, then I will talk surrounding the theme."

"The reason why Cai Lan participated in the disturbance was that Cai Lan couldn't bear Mr. Xie Erren's mental and physical abuse of her!" Speaking of this, her emotions became somewhat agitated, "This facilitated Cai Lan finally throwing herself to the enemy..."

Next Cheng Yongxin conducted concentrated strafing on Xie Erren, almost directly putting several hats of "Scum", "Sex X", "Abuse X" on him. Everyone felt somewhat puzzled; how did Cheng Yongxin suddenly become so agitated? Just short of weeping while speaking.

"...I feel very strange. A person like Mr. Xie Erren whose ability is worrying, and whose moral standard I don't want to comment on, exactly how did he become the local administrative chief of an important city? He has absolutely no administrative experience at all, and his education has no professional background. Behind this, exactly who is acting as his promoter and protective umbrella? Also, Liu Youwang who played an extremely vile role in the case, such a morally corrupt villain, actually grandly became the officer managing a prisoner camp. I feel strange: on what basis does the Senate's Human Resources Department select and appoint? These are all what we should clarify. I propose conducting an independent investigation into these departments and individuals! If necessary, propose convening a Senate General Assembly to reorganize the departments!"

"Is she in the same gang as Hai Lin?" Dong Shiye asked in a low voice.

"I don't think so." Ma Jia shook his head slightly, "Hai Lin only wants to deal with Ma Qianzhu. She is spraying obviously Ming Lang's department."

"This is wanting to move Ming Lang?"

"Have some meaning of that." Ma Jia said, "She obviously isn't alone—someone behind is directing. The Personnel Arrangement Department has always been the invisible center of power; people wanting to intervene are truly quite a few."

Cheng Yongxin's speech received more applause than Hai Lin. Although everyone wasn't very interested in her accusation of "Objectifying XX", faults of the Personnel Department in selecting and using people in the Wuzhou Incident were obvious.

After continuous warm-up by two people, the atmosphere in the venue became much more enthusiastic. Many people requested to speak again.

"Now it's lively." Ma Jia said to Dong Shiye, "Today's hearing will be a protracted war."

The third Senator to speak wasn't very familiar to Ma Jia and Dong Shiye. Because usually this person's name was rarely seen appearing in meetings or newspapers and journals. Should be an ordinary Senator who rarely mixed in Senate politics, position not high, focusing on his own job.

"Regarding the Wuzhou riot matter, I also want to say a few words." He wiped his head with a handkerchief, obviously not quite suitable for such occasions, "The matter itself is already stated very clearly in the report. I personally have no questions. Mainly want to express personal views on this incident."
