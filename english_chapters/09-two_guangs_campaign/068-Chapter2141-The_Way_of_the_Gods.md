# Chapter 2141 - The Way of the Gods

Looking closely at the architecture here, although dilapidated, one could still discern the grandeur of its original construction. The main beams and pillars were made of precious *nanmu* wood. Not only was the main hall magnificent and elegant, but the surrounding area was also extensively built up with halls, pavilions, terraces, and open porches. Inside, there were the main hall, side rooms, wing rooms, connecting corridors, a retiring hall, the Yanxi Hall, the Youqing Hall, the Yanxi Hall, and dozens of other pavilions and terraces. There were also several *mu* of ponds, dotted with flowers and trees.

"The officials certainly knew how to enjoy themselves since ancient times," Xie Erren sighed. Although this Three-General Headquarters was a building from over a hundred years ago, its condition was actually better than some civilian residences. In terms of area and imposing manner, it was far superior to the Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen where he was currently staying.

Xie Erren suddenly thought: this place could totally be used to house refugees! But he immediately rejected this idea. If thousands of refugees moved in, they would inevitably light fires to cook, and once a fire started, it would be a major disaster. It was better to keep them settled in a dispersed manner.

However, these houses could be used as offices and factory buildings in the future...

As Xie Erren was pondering, he arrived in front of the General's Yamen. There had been no General stationed here for a long time, but in front of the gate stood a pair of peculiar large drums. The drum bodies were enormous, as big as large Jacuzzis. The drum skins were already tattered, but the drum bodies were even more strange. Not only was the surface texture rough, but the shape was not a perfect circle either; they looked as if they were made from the skin of some plant.

Seeing that Chief Xie was so interested in this pair of large drums, a clerk hurriedly introduced them, saying that after Han Yong conquered the Dateng Gorge, he chopped down the giant rattan that spanned the river, covered several sections of it with cowhide to make large drums, and distributed them to the military headquarters in Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and Zhaoqing to demonstrate the martial achievement of "pacifying the rebellion." It was said that when these large drums were beaten, "the sound was like thunder and could be heard for several *li*."

"This is rattan?" Xie Erren was somewhat surprised now—how thick must this rattan be! However, looking at the color and texture of the drum body, it did indeed have the feel of old rattan.

"That is why it is called Dateng [Big Rattan] Gorge," He Dongli said. "It is said that this giant rattan was a century-old rattan that spanned the Qian River. It sank during the day and floated at night. Anyone wishing to cross the river only had to cling to this rattan to cross the water. After Lord Han conquered Dateng Gorge and captured Hou Dagou alive, he chopped this rattan. Originally, merchants and travelers could not pass through Dateng Gorge, but passage began from then on. It is said that a section of the broken rattan drifted down the Qian River and Xun River, all the way to Teng County. Legend has it that Teng Prefecture and Teng County got their names from this."

Xie Erren nodded repeatedly. This Han Yong was truly a talent! Hearing that Han Yong had a shrine in Wuzhou, he proposed to go to the Han Duke Shrine to offer incense.

He Dongli was slightly surprised in his heart, but thinking that offering incense and praying to former sages was also a proper duty for a local official, he immediately led the way.

As soon as the news spread that the "Great Song Prefect" was going to offer incense at the Han Duke Shrine, the bailiffs of Wuzhou Prefecture and Cangwu County immediately sprang into action. First, they completely evicted all the refugees and beggars lodging in the shrine, and then they sent people to "suppress" and "clean the streets" everywhere along the route. For a time, the whole city was in a commotion. By the time Xie Erren arrived at the Han Duke Shrine, the streets were already spotless—because they heard that the Australians placed the utmost importance on "environmental hygiene," they had swept the streets completely and even sprinkled them with clear water—the only thing missing was padding the road with yellow earth.

Everyone said the efficiency of the Ming government was poor, but it didn't look poor at all! Xie Erren nodded secretly.

Not only were the streets "clean," but the directors of the Rehabilitation Bureau who were particularly eager to curry favor, as well as the local "Paijia" of the ward, also heard the news and came to "respectfully welcome" and "stand in attendance" by the roadside.

However, this Han Duke Shrine was slightly disappointing to him—perhaps because he was used to seeing various magnificent "fake ancient buildings" reconstructed in the old timeline, his expectations were always too high. Although there was a memorial archway in front of the gate of this Han Duke Shrine before his eyes, it just looked like an ordinary residential courtyard no matter how he looked at it! Although it was a brick and tile building, one could see it had been in disrepair for years. The plaques and couplets were weathered and peeling, the writing blurred.

Entering the shrine, there were towering ancient trees inside. He Dongli said that these trees all had a history of over a hundred years, and legend had it that one of them was planted by Wang Shouren.

"Wang Yangming has also been here?" Xie Erren was surprised again.

He Dongli said, "Mr. Yangming served as the Viceroy of Liangguang during the Jiajing reign. The Yangming Tower on the East Gate was built by his successor, Viceroy Lin Fulin, to commemorate him."

Xie Erren held Wang Shouren in high esteem. Hearing that he had also served as Viceroy of Liangguang here, he secretly regretted not reading the manuals compiled by the Intelligence Bureau and the Great Library carefully. He hurriedly asked, "Are there any relics of Mr. Yangming here?"

"There is a Four Sages Shrine in the city, and Mr. Yangming is enshrined there..."

"Good, we'll go take a look in a while."

He Dongli thought that this Australian was quite respectful towards the former sages of the Great Ming! He immediately made a few comments about the School of Mind, but unexpectedly, Xie Erren had absolutely no reaction to this and couldn't say anything sensible—obviously, he didn't understand.

The shrine was just a courtyard with three main rooms. The center enshrined Han Yong's spirit tablet. There was nothing special about it, nor were there any displays like "deed exhibitions" or "celebrity item exhibitions" from the old timeline, which made him feel slightly disappointed.

Xie Erren saw that although the buildings here were a bit dilapidated, they were kept clean. Upon asking, he found out that there was no special person guarding it, only the family living in the backyard of the shrine was responsible for guarding and sweeping. Hearing the bailiffs say that the "Great Song Prefect" was coming to offer incense, the head of this family came out "to welcome" with his son, pissing and shitting in terror, and wanted to invite him to "sit for a while and have tea."

"No need, I only came to offer incense to express my respect," Xie Erren waved his hand.

Hearing that the "Prefect Lord" wanted to offer incense, the father and son hurriedly arranged the vase and burner properly and prepared incense sticks. Xie Erren stood solemnly in front of the tablet, offered incense, and bowed according to the rituals. The crowd inevitably bowed and followed suit.

He Dongli and the gentry of the Rehabilitation Bureau who had heard the news were all a bit puzzled. This Australian master toured the whole city, neither looking at the treasury nor observing culture and people's livelihood, but first looked at the city walls and the General Headquarters, and then suddenly ran to Han Yong's shrine to offer incense. what kind of routine was this? But this was not strange either: because when a county magistrate or prefect took office, worshipping gods everywhere was also considered a proper meaning. Only a few people linked it to the recent news of the Eight-Row Yao "rebellion"—perhaps Prefect Xie was using this to express his "great ambition"?

Coming out of the main room, there were verandas on the east and west sides of the courtyard. The walls inside the verandas were covered with ink marks. Walking closer to look, they were all kinds of poems inscribed on the wall. It was just that many years had passed, and many were already illegible. He used to be fond of poetry, so at this moment, he picked the ones with relatively clear handwriting and read them one by one.

The inscribers mostly had signatures, but most were people Xie Erren didn't know; presumably, they were just officials residing in Wuzhou or local and passing literati. There were some well-written ones, but most could only be considered average. Later, he suddenly saw a familiar name: Zhu Yunming.

Xie Erren's understanding of this person, Zhu Yunming, was deeper than just "Four Talents of Jiangnan." He vaguely remembered that Zhu Yunming had also been an official in Guangdong—he didn't expect him to have been to Wuzhou too! Looking at the inscribed poem again, it was a seven-character regulated verse, rhyming on *ma*.

*Respectfully replying to Vice Commissioner Gu's poem at the Han Duke Shrine in Wuzhou*
*Towering timber constructs the Imperial house,*
*Leaning on heaven, heroic strategy regards insects and sand as trivial.*
*Sincerity returns to the palace towers, the heart hangs like a stone,*
*Blood drinks the Xiongnu, courage breaks the melon.*

*Midnight feast at the Kunlun Privy Council,*
*Three words of slander, the Fubo General's cart.*
*Where are the sharp tongues of that time now?*
*The old tree and grand shrine, the sun sets again.*

Judging solely by the poem, it wasn't top-grade, but the word "Fubo" in this poem suited his taste very well. He felt this was a good omen, and he didn't even feel annoyed by the news of the Eight-Row Yao riot, the emptiness of troops, and the instability of the rear area.

"These wall poems are all precious cultural heritage of Wuzhou; they must be well protected."

The crowd didn't know what "cultural heritage" was, but they understood "heritage." Obviously, Prefect Xie valued these wall poems very highly. The local Paijia had a quick mind and could tell that what he valued most was this poem by Zhu Yunming, so he silently committed it to memory.

Since Xie Erren said this sentence, everyone naturally echoed in agreement.

Xie Erren came out of the Han Duke Shrine and went to the Four Sages Shrine, performing the rites as before. Seeing that he was extremely respectful to the local former sages, He Dongli guessed he had the intention of "teaching through the gods," so he suggested visiting the "Dragon Mother Temple" to offer incense.

In the Ming Dynasty, there were as many as seventeen ancient temples in Wuzhou city and its suburbs, including the City God Temple, Guan Yu Temple, Xuanwu Temple, Wuxian Temple, etc., but the one with the longest history and the most flourishing incense was the Dragon Mother Temple.

There had always been Dragon Mother worship in the West River basin, with a very long history. Legends related to the Dragon Mother's life experience had been included in local chronicles since the Jin Dynasty.

It was said that the Dragon Mother's surname was Wen and her name was Ao. She was born in the era of King Huai of Chu, in Xiaotong Fang, Shuidong Street, First Division of Teng County, Guangxi.

Legend has it that the Dragon Mother once adopted five little dragons. Later, with the help of the five little dragons, she led the villagers to split mountains and divert water, controlling floods and benefiting the people, allowing everyone to live a life of favorable weather and abundant crops. Thus, Lady Wen was honored by the people of the West River basin as "Dragon Mother" and became a "Goddess" who benefited the people and protected peace.

The legend of Dragon Mother was particularly developed in the West River basin. According to several Daoist priests of the New Daoism, the legend of Dragon Mother had similarities with the legend of Mazu; both were deities born from the spiritual needs of people living along rivers and seas to pray for blessings and avoid disasters.

Starting from the Song Dynasty, due to the increasing number of believers, Dragon Mother worship was listed in official sacrifices, and Dragon Mother worship gradually rose in various places in Lingnan. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, Dragon Mother belief spread even more widely among the people, expanding to the surrounding areas of Lingnan, and Dragon Mother step by step became a water goddess with unique Lingnan characteristics.

The people of the West River basin and the masses who went to the southeast coast and Southeast Asia to make a living for generations still constantly remembered the Dragon Mother's grace, hoping to often receive the Dragon Mother's protection, and set up temples for sacrifice one after another. Since the Dragon Mother was the river god of the West River, Dragon Mother Temples were all built on the riverbank. In the old days, there were Dragon Mother Temples in every county along the West River, serving as "Dragon Mother Traveling Palaces." People went to the temples to sacrifice every year, praying for favorable weather and peace for the country and the people.

Xie Erren had read the introduction about Dragon Mother worship in the *Wuzhou Situation Manual*. Knowing the Dragon Mother's status in the hearts of the Wuzhou people, going to offer incense also had the meaning of winning over the people's feelings, which was not inappropriate.
