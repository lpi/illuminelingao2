# Chapter 2127 - The Capture of Wuzhou

Luo Yangming endured extreme anguish until dawn. His family was still at home; although Wen Tietou and the shop hands were looking after them, they were too few. If rioters struck, the consequences were unthinkable.

Though only four or five days had passed since the Fubo Army arrived outside the walls, it felt like half a lifetime—truly, each day seemed like a year.

Several times he had wanted to send someone to fetch his family, but the streets were in chaos; he feared an accident en route. Better to stay home behind locked doors; their neighborhood was mostly rice merchants, and though it made a tempting target, the guild had militiamen standing guard.

Just as the sky began to lighten, the rumble of artillery came from both north and south of Wuzhou. Luo Yangming's spirits soared—the assault had begun!

Signal rockets of various colors streaked across the sky, as beautiful to him as festival fireworks. He didn't linger to watch but scrambled down from the roof to report to the guild directors waiting in the hall.

"The Australians have begun the assault! In less than half a day, Wuzhou will belong to the Great Song!" Luo Yangming said, gesturing excitedly.

The directors' previously dull and anxious faces all relaxed. They had been on edge for days; now, hearing that the Australians were about to enter the city, the lawless nightmare was finally ending. Their lives and properties would likely be saved. The heavy atmosphere in the hall began to lift. Breakfast trays, which had sat untouched on the table, suddenly drew a crowd; someone even loudly scolded their servant for being "slow-witted" and not knowing to "warm up the porridge."

Luo Yangming watched the merchants resuming their swagger with their servants; clearly, they felt secure again. But this was no time to relax. The roving soldiers inside the city were still numerous, and cornered dogs could still cause great damage.

It was Guild-master Qiao who had his wits about him. He sent messengers to contact the militia and local garrison throughout the city, ordering them to "hold their positions" and "protect the people." After the crisis, there would be "generous rewards." He also dispatched an envoy to the city's highest military commander, the Xunwu Regional Vice Commander.

This vice commander was still in the city only out of necessity—Wuzhou was his defense zone. If it fell, the court would certainly hold him responsible, and his family would suffer as well. Ming generals mostly came from hereditary military officer families—essentially feudal petty lords—with personal stakes tied to their clans. For both practical and emotional reasons, he ought to fight to the death and perish with the city.

So the envoy Guild-master Qiao sent was a "death squad" volunteer—the recipient might well execute him on the spot out of a "no compromise with traitors" mindset.

The message Guild-master Qiao sent was simple: if the vice commander immediately ordered his men to open the gates and surrender, keeping his troops under control, he would receive twenty thousand taels of silver as a reward, plus three thousand taels for himself personally. The guild would also intercede with the Australians to guarantee his safety.

Having dispatched the envoy, Guild-master Qiao pulled Luo Yangming aside and asked in a low voice whether he knew anyone in the Australian army.

Luo Yangming naturally couldn't reveal his identity. He said that he had long had dealings with Dachang, and since Dachang was reportedly handling the Australians' military rice supply this time, there might be acquaintances among the Fubo Army.

"So you have no reliable contacts?" A doubtful look flickered in Guild-master Qiao's eyes.

"Though I have no acquaintances, the Fubo Army is famously disciplined. Someone will come to negotiate; Your Honor need not worry..." Seeing that Guild-master Qiao still looked unconvinced, Luo Yangming added, "I have an 'authorization certificate' from my dealings with Dachang. With that, getting an audience with the person in charge shouldn't be a problem..."

Once he mentioned having "credentials," Guild-master Qiao relaxed somewhat. He had lived in Wuzhou a long time; he had heard of the Australians, used Australian goods, but had no firsthand experience of how the "Hair-Bandits" operated. In a situation as perilous as a city falling, one misstep could mean instant disaster.

At least there was Luo Yangming, someone with "Australian connections." Guild-master Qiao felt slightly more confident. He then explained the "gratuities" the gentry and merchants had agreed upon: so much per soldier, so much per officer, so much for the commanding general. He asked Luo Yangming if these "figures" were appropriate—and of course, when the time came, "Brother Luo" would handle the negotiations...

Luo Yangming was privately amused, but free money was free money; there was no need to save it for these fat cats. And a windfall for the army after its long march wouldn't hurt. He agreed to handle the negotiations, which finally put Guild-master Qiao at ease.

After Dayun Gate fell, the last organized resistance inside the city completely collapsed. The remnant of the Xunwu Vice Commander's elite—his personal retainers—attempted several counterattacks at Dayun Gate without success, and the unit essentially disintegrated. As for the rioters who had been terrorizing the city, hoping to loot under cover of chaos, they now descended into a final frenzy; their formations shattered entirely, and soldiers ran amok, looting and setting fires. The city plunged into total chaos.

After Zhu Quanxing's 2nd Battalion entered the city, they simultaneously seized key points, rounded up rioters along the way, and sent men to negotiate with surrendering soldiers. All surrendering Ming troops, whether local or guest soldiers, were ordered out of the city to await inspection and reorganization. The city's militia and constables were ordered to remain at their posts, guarding key roads, mopping up roving rioters, and dispatching firefighting teams as needed.

Yang Zeng's battalion entered from the south, deploying in squad and platoon-sized units throughout the city to hunt down rioters and assist in firefighting. Everything proceeded in orderly fashion; by noon, the entire city was pacified. Although fires kept breaking out, prompt response prevented any large-scale conflagrations. A few slum neighborhoods had burned, leaving several hundred homeless, and the dockside district along the river outside the walls had been heavily damaged—leveled almost entirely. But overall, the city had escaped major destruction.

The terrorized and brutalized people of Wuzhou—rich and poor alike—finally, amid fear and uncertainty, welcomed their new masters. Some, however, would never see this day's sunrise. Civilians killed in the previous night's riots still lay in the streets, and in the Cangwu County yamen, the magistrate who had hanged himself in despair still dangled from the beam in the rear hall, the courtyard in ruins.

Zhu Mingxia did not enter the city himself. To him, Wuzhou was just a name on a map; his mission was combat. The Ming main force was not far away.

So the job of temporary military government director fell to Zhu Quanxing.

Zhu Quanxing entered the city on foot. Unlike other cities, Wuzhou had opened its gates without major destruction—though the sieges and the arson plots had caused considerable damage. Thanks to "Lone Wolf's" efforts, Xiong Wencan's plan to burn the city had been foiled, but the situation inside was still unstable. Under these circumstances, a formal "liberation parade" was out of the question.

The local worthies wanted to "welcome" him at the gates; Zhu Quanxing replied that it was "unnecessary" and told them all to report to the prefectural yamen—the temporary military government's headquarters—and await orders.

Normally such work wouldn't require a Council of Elders member; the receiving team of northward cadres from the Qiongya Column would handle it. But Wuzhou's strategic importance was exceptional. Whether the Fubo Army pushed deeper into Guangxi or dug in to defend Guangdong, Wuzhou was a critical transportation node that had to be properly managed.

"All militia except firefighters and prefectural and county yamen constables are to disband on the spot and return home."

"All military personnel inside the city, whether local or guest troops, are to exit the city and report for inspection at the northern gate. Anyone remaining after sunset will be treated as a bandit."

"All Ming officials must report to the Cangwu County yamen by sunset to await disposition. Those who hide will be treated as rebels."

"All sulfur, gunpowder, tung oil, and other flammable materials inside the city are to be removed and stored outside the walls."

...

Order after order issued from the gates of the temporary military government. The takeover involved countless details, but after years of experience, the Council of Elders had developed a mature system for receiving cities. Several veterans among the northward cadres were on hand. After entering the city, they directed troops to seize key departments, seal and confiscate weapons, and round up stragglers—all in good order.

Zhu Quanxing was spared the details. He set up his table and maps at the prefectural yamen, which served as the temporary military government, and began arranging defense and security for Wuzhou.

Given the current situation, Wuzhou was a "frontline city"—and the environment was highly unfavorable. It was not only far from the Pearl River Delta, the core of the Council's governance of Guangdong, but also straddled the remote border between the two Guangs. To the west, the Guangxi Ming forces still had considerable strength. They had now been joined by the retreating Liangshan anti-Yao Regional Commander and the Central Route garrison, boosting their power. Though historically impoverished, Guangxi had several grain-producing regions and could be self-sufficient. By comparison, the Fubo Army in Wuzhou was already struggling with overstretched supply lines. To the east, from Zhaoqing to Wuzhou, the mountainous riverbanks were home to numerous Yao settlements; if a large-scale uprising occurred, Wuzhou could become an isolated outpost.

Whether as a spearhead for the conquest of Guangxi or as a shield for defending Guangdong, the 2nd Battalion had to first secure Wuzhou's defenses.

The first step, naturally, was to understand Wuzhou's current situation. The most suitable person for this was obviously "Lone Wolf," who had sent signals and secret letters. By rights, this intelligence operative should be coming to make contact soon.

What kind of intelligence would this Lone Wolf bring? Both Zhu Quanxing and Xu Ke were intensely curious about this operative inside Wuzhou. If not for his timely actions in foiling Xiong Wencan's arson plot, they might now be facing a smoke-filled ruin and a sea of refugees.

Yet even now, this mysterious Lone Wolf had not appeared.

Just then, the orderly came to report again: the local "worthies" had been waiting for quite some time.
