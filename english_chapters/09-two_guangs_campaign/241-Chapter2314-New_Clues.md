# Chapter 2314 - New Clues

"Cai Lan is also a principal offender; her life cannot be spared," Xie Erren said. "I will give her a chance to commit suicide with dignity, avoiding the humiliation of a public execution. I will also provide a good set of grave clothes and choose a place for burial."

Yi Haoran cupped his hands and said, "Many thanks!" He said generously, "Do as you wish!"

"Good! Mr. Yi is truly a hero. Straightforward!" Xie Erren nodded, secretly delighted. "Take Mr. Yi back and serve him well."

Yi Haoran was taken down, and Zhao Fengtian walked in quietly.

"Do you think this old man can keep his promise?"

"Half and half," Zhao Fengtian said. "He is a dying man; saying anything doesn't matter. It depends on whether he really cares about the Luo and Jiang families. However," he paused, "I see he is a righteous man of affection."

"I have that feeling too." Xie Erren nodded. "He counts as a gentleman! However, I fear that if he regrets it at the moment and shouts out at the public trial rally, it will be unseemly..."

"That won't be a problem," Zhao Fengtian whispered. "The public trial venue is large; tin megaphones are needed for everyone to hear. Just assign a sharp police officer to hold the megaphone and remove it at any time. Also, put a noose around his neck with a knot at the throat. Have someone pull it from behind. If he really starts shouting indiscriminately, just pull the rope tight, and he won't be able to say a single word."

"You really have a way," Xie Erren patted his shoulder. "Let's do that! Go back and plan his confession carefully to see how it should be written."

"Yes, I'll consider it right away." Just as Zhao Fengtian was about to withdraw, Xie Erren stopped him again: "How are arrangements for Cai Lan?"

"Everything is arranged properly," Zhao Fengtian said. "Chief, rest assured."

Following Zhao Fengtian's instructions, Zheng Ergen specifically arranged for two female wardens who specialized in guarding female prisoners in the Yamen. They were ruthless types, most skilled at torturing and humiliating female prisoners physically and mentally. In less than three or five days, Cai Lan wouldn't be able to endure it and would have to seek death.

But it wasn't appropriate to say these words to Xie Erren. He understood this Senator too well.

Xie Erren nodded and said, "Is the report to Guangzhou ready?"

"The draft is finished. I'll send it to your desk in a moment. Please give modification comments after reviewing it."

"This report is most critical. It must be sent out tonight. Otherwise, the Senate will inevitably be suspicious later." Xie Erren was quite satisfied with his efficiency.

The unloading work continued until evening before finishing completely. It was safe and sound. Large amounts of grain entered the warehouse, and rice prices dropped in response. That night, according to Xie Erren's instructions, the more than twenty captives and insider spies caught last night were publicly strangled at various city gates in Wuzhou. The originally panicked city settled down again.

The Second Squadron, which took over the defense of Sanhezu, set up a shelter there, successively receiving hundreds of scattered refugees and captives. These refugees were then handed over to the fleet returning the next day to be taken back to Sanshui. Wuzhou could no longer shoulder these burdens.

In the city, Xie Erren carefully read Zhao Fengtian's report. To be fair, the report was written very adequately. But it was inevitably too plain and narrative, lacking language sense and proper measure. Xie Erren was a professional in this aspect, an expert level in wording and phrasing.

This report had to be handled extremely carefully. It had to make the Guangdong Region feel the situation wasn't serious, yet not show an intention to downplay it. After pondering the wording carefully for half a day and making painstaking modifications, he was finally satisfied.

In the report, he didn't mention a word about Cai Lan destroying the transfer letter. This joint was too big and had to be flatly denied. As for the relationship between him and Cai Lan, it was mentioned even less. Cai Lan was only categorized as a "retained staff member" mixed into the list of insider personnel captured during the riot.

Reading it through one last time and changing a few words and punctuation marks, Xie Erren stamped his large seal, put the document into a "Top Secret, Urgent" bag, and handed it to the confidential clerk.

"Send a summary via radio tonight, and send the full text early tomorrow morning!"

After finishing these things, Xie Erren let out a breath. He felt his soul had returned a little.

"Liu Youwang woke up?" Zhao Fengtian was exhausted after tossing and turning for a day and a night. He had already washed up and returned to his bedroom, ready to go to bed early and sleep well. Unexpectedly, Zheng Ergen suddenly came to find him, reporting that Liu Youwang, who was found in the ruins of Sanhezu, had woken up.

Hearing this news, Zhao Fengtian didn't dare to delay. He hurried back to the office and lit a candle.

Liu Youwang was the Warden of Sanhezu. In the whole of Sanhezu, only he and Jiang Yougong were naturalized cadres. The others were all retained personnel.

Jiang Yougong was already dead, and strictly speaking, he didn't have much to do with the Sanhezu camp. If the Senate wanted to investigate the Sanhezu matter, Liu Youwang was the key figure.

Exactly how the bandits and Ming army breached the Sanhezu camp and what happened before and after—only he could explain it clearly now. The key was that from the preliminary interrogation of surviving retained personnel, and the returned captives and refugees, the water in Sanhezu was very deep.

"How is Liu Youwang's condition now?"

"He is conscious. The medic said he is fine, mostly flesh wounds and contusions," Zheng Ergen said.

Zhao Fengtian frowned slightly and whispered, "This medic is too arbitrary. He isn't even a doctor; on what basis does he say Liu Youwang is fine?"

Zheng Ergen was a bit baffled. He said, "Then, then I'll let him check carefully again..."

"What can he find by checking again? He isn't a doctor. Just don't draw conclusions casually."

Zheng Ergen understood somewhat and immediately said, "I know!"

"Did Liu Youwang say anything?"

"He just said the opera chest exploded during the rehearsal. He knows nothing else."

"Weren't the opera chests taken from the Three Generals' Office warehouse? Those chests were taken out of the warehouse as items left untouched for decades. The gunpowder certainly wasn't original—someone put it in halfway."

"Liu Youwang also said he personally came to Wuzhou to transport the chests back, approved by the Chief personally," Zheng Ergen said. "But he also admitted that after moving the chests into the camp, he didn't manage them and handed them all to Chang Qingyun."

"Who is Chang Qingyun?"

"A captive in the camp, heavily originally an advisor of Xiong Wencan."

"Was this Chang Qingyun caught?"

"No. No corpse was found either—perhaps it was burned."

"Is there a confession saying Chang Qingyun was an insider?"

"Currently... not yet," Zheng Ergen said. "According to the captives and refugees, Chang Qingyun was Liu Youwang's dog-head advisor (consigliere), often helping Liu Youwang do bad things and persecuting refugees in the camp. He put the most effort into organizing the opera troupe and getting women."

"So this Chang Qingyun was a helping hand (hanger-on)." Zhao Fengtian felt much more at ease.

"Should be." Zheng Ergen continued to report that Liu Youwang did many bad things in the camp: raping and occupying women, embezzling money and grain, and abusing or even killing captives and refugees.

"...Public resentment against him was great. So when the bandits attacked and the insiders shouted, the camp immediately fell into chaos. Jiang Yougong wasn't any better. National Army soldiers said he rarely cared about military affairs and often fooled around with Liu Youwang in the camp."

"I didn't expect the camp's problems to be so big!" Zhao Fengtian feigned surprise. "This is important information. We must focus on collecting relevant evidence."

"It seems now that Liu Youwang and Jiang Yougong acting unlawfully and being paralyzingly careless in the camp was the main reason for the accident at Sanhezu."

"I think so too." Zheng Ergen agreed with Zhao Fengtian's tone-setting. "There is one more thing I need to report."

"Speak."

"A small ox-horn seal was found on Liu Youwang. Strangely, a nearly identical one was found on Jiang Yougong, only the seal script was different."

Saying this, Zheng Ergen took out a kraft paper bag for evidence and poured out the seals.

"Both small seals were kept close to their bodies and wrapped very carefully. Obviously, they are very important things. But the seal script on these seals cannot be read at all."

Zhao Fengtian examined the two small seals in turn. From the size, texture, and script, he could judge they were from the same batch and the same hand. But the seal script was strange writing no one recognized.

"This is a secret cipher seal. The script is a code; only the shop that issued the seal understands it." Zhao Fengtian was knowledgeable. "It is used to deposit and withdraw money from shops and banks—it seems this Liu Youwang got quite a bit of wealth." He explained briefly to Zheng Ergen.

Zheng Ergen suddenly realized: "So Jiang Yougong had one too..."

"Exactly. The two of them were in cahoots at Sanhezu, making a mess of things, and even poking a hole in Wuzhou City." Zhao Fengtian sighed. "It's meaningless to say this now. The key is where they hid the silver—maybe others are involved."

Large shops or banks that took deposits made secrecy their primary principle, so the secret cipher seals usually had no name, only the depositor knew where it was deposited. Confidentiality was high.

"Did Liu Youwang say where this thing came from?"

"I haven't asked him yet. I estimate he won't say. But it's not hard to check. There are few seal-carving shops in Wuzhou City. Ask an old master, and we'll roughly know which shop carved it."

"Check it. You must put effort into this case and investigate strictly! Get to the bottom of it!" Zhao Fengtian set the tone instantly, making the Sanhezu corruption case a key focus. This way, he could maximize potential blame-shifting and divert the line of sight of future investigations.

"Yes, I'll go investigate right now!"

"For Liu Youwang's side, don't alert him for now. Just send someone to watch him. Start from the periphery. First, clarify the source of the ox-horn seals; second, clarify what illegal activities he and Jiang Yougong specifically conducted in the Sanhezu camp, and if any other naturalized cadres are involved—report this case directly to me!"
