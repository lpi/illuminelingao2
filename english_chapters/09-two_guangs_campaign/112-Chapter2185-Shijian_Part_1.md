# Chapter 2185 - Shijian (Part 1)

On the front, Li Gangsheng withstood the "pig rush" (human wave attack) of the regiment braves, and on the flank, the "surprise attack" by the small squad of bird-gunners led by Ma Huliang was also beaten back by a volley from Squad 9. Ma Huliang didn't possess the "fearless bravery" of Yang Xiaodong; as soon as the blood of the people around him splattered on his face, he immediately ran away.

When the soldiers of the 1st Platoon began to pursue with fixed bayonets, the Yang Family Village regiment braves collapsed instantly. Hundreds of people disbanded in a hubbub. Provincial Graduate Yang was almost trampled to death by the fleeing militia; fortunately, Yang Erhu still remembered his uncle and led a few personal guards to save him from the scattering crowd at the risk of their lives.

Seeing the complete defeat, Yang Jinghui was disheartened. Feeling he had no face to see the "village elders" upon return, he drew his sword to slit his throat. Yang Erhu was sharp-eyed and quick-handed, snatching the sword away and saying: "Master, do not lose heart! Losing a battle here doesn't matter. The Hair Rebels are strong but few in number; we just need to avoid their momentum for a while!" With that, he hurriedly ordered a few servants to carry Master Yang and fled in panic.

By the time the follow-up troops of the 2nd Company arrived, the ambushing village braves had been driven from the battlefield, leaving only a mess of corpses and wounded.

However, Li Gangsheng couldn't feel happy at all. It looked like a complete victory, but his platoon actually had three killed on the spot and another ten wounded to varying degrees, two of whom had severe injuries—which were almost synonymous with death.

Among the slightly wounded, several also belonged to the category of "unsuitable for combat duty," meaning although they didn't need to be evacuated to the field hospital, they had to leave the company to go to the accompanying "Convalescent Team" to perform some simple field service tasks.

Calculated this way, out of thirty-four people, the net attrition reached eight, almost one-quarter. Although the enemy abandoned over a hundred corpses on the battlefield and there wouldn't be few captives, no amount of kills and captures could offset his own net attrition.

Li Dong led men to search for and arrest captives in the grass. There were militia and village braves everywhere in the bushes who hadn't managed to escape, many of them wounded. Some were actually not seriously injured, but since collecting captives was difficult at the moment, captives who couldn't walk on their own were all unwanted, left in place to survive or die on their own.

In total, over fifty captives were caught. Urgent interrogation of the captives revealed that the enemy were village braves from Yang Family Village. This sparked a debate among the commanders.

Because they had encountered an ambush, Wu Baliu, commander of the 2nd Company, worried that the communication line was threatened and strongly advocated sweeping Yang Family Village first. Wu Baliu had been abruptly promoted to company commander in the 10th Battalion shortly after entering Guangzhou; his rank was even one grade lower than a senior captain, so he was very unreconciled to this "victory" that wasn't crisp enough.

But Yang Zeng, commander of the Sui River Detachment and also battalion commander of the 8th Battalion, believed that their primary objective was to lift the siege of Shijian and ensure the safety of Guangning County seat's gateway.

"Our army is currently advancing by both water and land with the purpose of rushing to Shijian as quickly as possible. If we split forces to suppress bandits now and rush into the mountainous area with unclear circumstances, the probability of suffering a loss is high. Moreover, the village braves cannot threaten the water transport on the Sui River."

Although Huang Chao was present, he felt it was better to speak less on military issues and let the commander be responsible.

Thus, it was decided that the plan remained unchanged. The 2nd Company and the Wuzhou Composite Squadron would continue to double-time forward by land to lift the siege of Shijian.

Unlike the West River with its busy shipping, the banks of the Sui River were covered with vast mountains. The narrow roads stretched the troops out very long. Plus, this was a "non-security area" where enemy forces could appear from all directions. The losses from the ambush just now were heavy. Although the two severely wounded were immediately sent back by boat, everyone knew they boded ill. If it happened again, his platoon would be written off. The heavy responsibility made 2nd Company Commander Wu Baliu and Li Dong's nerves very taught, and the subordinate officers and NCOs became tense along with them.

However, the subsequent journey was safe and sound. The villagers in the villages they passed all fled far away. Occasionally encountering a village that fortified its walls and guarded strictly, they only sent people with tea and water to "welcome the Great Army passing through," showing no hostility.

Wu Baliu questioned people at every such village encountered. From the mouths of local commoners, they learned that those besieging Shijian were indeed the Yang Family Village braves who had ambushed them—many villages were angry but dared not speak out against Yang Family Village. As for the Yao movements that the battalion commander and the Head of State wanted to know most about, there was very little information. They only knew that local Yao people were following bandits to cause chaos, and a few villages had united to come out and plunder, but there were no large-scale troop movements. It seemed Director Huang's judgment that the Yao people were only "looting a burning house" was correct—they had no intention of large-scale rebellion.

Wu Baliu led the team rushing and finally arrived at a place less than 2 kilometers from Shijian. This place was known as the South Gate of Guangning. The so-called small town was just a larger village, situated on a small alluvial plain among mountains by the river, protected by a wooden stockade wall. The Yang Family Village braves besieging Shijian had set up wooden barricades at the traffic choke point, controlling the road and several villages on the nearby hillside.

Xie Wendong, the head of the village braves besieging Shijian, was originally the second-in-command of rural bandits. When the Yang Family Village braves rose to power and suppressed bandits in the surroundings, seeing the situation was bad, under Master Yang's coercion and inducement, he killed the main leader in an internal conflict and surrendered the mountain stronghold.

He originally had fifty or sixty old bandit partners under him, which was also a power within the Yang Family Stockade. Provincial Graduate Yang both guarded against him and used him. This time, to win people's hearts, he sent him to lead the team to attack Shijian, letting him make a small fortune.

Xie Wendong originally thought this Shijian would inevitably open its gates and surrender like last time, obediently offering up wealth and goods. Therefore, he only brought over a hundred regiment militia; the others were able-bodied men from various villages attached to Yang Family Village, following along to "get rich" and boost morale. They wouldn't get a share of the valuables, but getting some tattered clothes, furniture, and pots would be good too.

Unexpectedly, a small squad of the National Army was stationed in the town, and they had added fortifications. He led the militia to charge for a while, but before they could climb the stockade wall, they were beaten to flowing water by firearms—besides Nanyang rifles, the National Army also had many captured Ming army firearms, fired by militia temporarily conscripted from the town. A burst of chaotic fire, and Xie Wendong's subordinates couldn't withstand the firepower and instantly withered.

Xie Wendong jumped with rage. He did have some desperadoes under him, but there were too few of them. The main force was ordinary commoners. Seeing Shijian was a hard nut to crack, no one was willing to risk their lives. A stalemate ensued.

Just as he was at his wit's end, his "Strategist" Jiang Wenming offered a plan: since they couldn't take it down for a while, they might as well block the roads to prevent reinforcements from the county seat from coming to the rescue. At worst, they besiege it for a few months, forcing them to run out of food and surrender.

This Jiang Wenming was originally a failed scholar who owed gambling debts and had to go up the mountain to become a bandit. Because he could read a few characters, had a vicious heart, and knew a few moves with spear and club, he was considered "talented in both civil and martial arts" and soon became the "Strategist" of the stronghold.

He knew that this "career" of banditry wouldn't lead anywhere, so he had hooked up with Provincial Graduate Yang very early on, often doing dirty work that was inconvenient for Master Yang to show his face for on ordinary days. Jiang Wenming had also contributed to Xie Wendong's internal conflict killing the leader and surrendering to Yang Family Village this time.

Xie Wendong already knew about Master Yang suffering a huge loss in the ambush. Not only had Yang Erhu sent a messenger early on telling him to withdraw troops quickly to avoid being bitten by the Hair Rebels and suffering another big loss, but Yu Heiqi, a former subordinate who fled back from the battlefield, also ran to him and told him the whole story.

"How many people did the Hair Rebels bring?"

"Saw no more than forty-something people, and we were beaten to collapse by them." Yu Heiqi was still in shock. "Those firearms, formidable!"

"Cut the crap! Do I need you to tell me Hair Rebel firearms are formidable?" Xie Wendong said impatiently. "I'm asking exactly how many people are in their main force?"

"This, the lowly one didn't see... dare not say." Yu Heiqi said, "Only know the Hair Rebel main force is by boat..."

"Scram!"

Xie Wendong lost his ideas for a moment. Speaking of running away, that was naturally the safest best policy. But the fat meat of Shijian was right by his mouth, yet he couldn't eat it; it was inevitably a bit regrettable. Especially since last night he had just transported several hundred *jin* of gunpowder from the mountain stronghold, planning to float it over by boat to blow open the riverside stockade wall and break in during the chaos. If he ran now, these things would be wasted.

Thinking back and forth, he decided not to run for the time being, but to seize the time to do this job first—anyway, the Hair Rebels' main force was by boat; traveling upstream to get here would take until the day after tomorrow at the earliest. As for the troops coming by land, there were only a few dozen of them. He would just send some men to rely on wooden barricades to block them. Presumably, these few dozen people couldn't attack through.

Immediately he discussed with Jiang Wenming. The two split the men and horses in two. Jiang Wenming took half the men to block the intersection, and he took the other half to attack Shijian.

"...You seize the time to act. Even if you don't succeed, you have to leave." Jiang Wenming instructed him.

"I know this." Xie Wendong said carelessly. "You just guard against the Hair Rebel land scouts rushing over—heard they are all very capable troops."

"No matter how capable, it's just a few dozen people. I'll just hold fast here without going out. They don't have cannons; they can't attack it easily."

Jiang Wenming spoke with some confidence. For storming fortifications, besides gunpowder, they had also transported quite a few firearms like Lychee Cannons from the stronghold, plus a Ming army iron cannon—this was old stock in the stronghold. To hit Shijian, Xie Wendong had brought out all his old capital.

With these firearms, plus wooden barricades and hastily repaired batteries, resisting a few dozen people should be no problem.

Wu Baliu's advance party arrived before dark. Hearing the report from the point men ahead that the enemy had actually built fortifications on the road and set up cannons, he thought heavy troops were gathered and dared not underestimate them. Because it was late and the surrounding environment was complex, he decided not to attack that night but to wait until daybreak the next day to handle it.

"Tomorrow our 2nd Company will take the main attack; you follow behind." Wu Baliu gestured on the roughly drawn topographic map. "The terrain here is narrow; troops cannot spread out easily..."

"I request that the main attack mission tomorrow be executed by our squadron," Li Dong said. "Please have the Fubo Army support us with firepower."
