# Chapter 2366: Agricultural Company (Part 2)

"Slave?" Xu Yanliang was a bit surprised, "Where is his father?"

"His father is a hired hand of this farm, a good hand at farming. Had no wife. The Master said a man without a wife has no roots, so he specifically went to the human market at the pier to buy a female slave for him to marry." Hu Sanqing said while leading the way, "Among the immigrants who came to Sanya back then, except for those who had their own families, how many women were there? The few servant girls the Master brought back then were all married out within two years... In this place, the bride price even for a widow is very high."

"Didn't many refugees arrive from Shandong later? I remember there were quite a few women."

"All assigned to state-owned farms. Chief, watch your step..." After speaking, he shouted to the people nearby: "Are you all blind? Entertain the military lords to rest in the pavilion and prepare tea and water!"

The four guards rested in the pavilion by the gate, and Hu Sanqing led him and Yuan Fei through the open space behind the gate to the inside.

Xu Yanliang looked at this "private farm." He had also been to several farms, but those were all state-owned farms personally built by Wu Nanhai, carefully designed and constructed. As for private farms, he had never visited one.

At first glance, this farm was very different from those state-owned farms. Upon entering, there was a compacted threshing floor with several four-wheeled ox carts parked. Surrounding the threshing floor were houses of various sizes and heights. There were brick-and-wood structures, as well as simple bamboo and reed huts. The best brick-and-wood building among them was a towering Dutch-style windmill, which was slowly turning—probably a mill, because Xu Yanliang saw several large red brick silos standing behind the mill.

Chickens and dogs strolled on the open ground, and several naked children played together—a scene of rural scenery.

"Chief, come this way," Hu Sanqing led them through a wooden archway between the houses, walked along the alley for dozens of steps, turned a corner, and came to a small courtyard. Three north-facing rooms with stone-paved floors. In the courtyard, there was a gourd trellis growing densely. Underneath were stone tables and chairs. On the table was a complete set of Kung Fu tea sets, very exquisite. This was probably where Farm Owner Hu rested and met guests.

"Chief, please rest here for a moment and have some refreshments. The Master will come to pay respects as soon as he returns." Hu Sanqing said and withdrew.

Seeing that the layout of this garden was quite orderly and the Kung Fu tea set was also very exquisite, Xu Yanliang said: "This Farm Owner Hu is quite a capable woman..."

Yuan Fei held back his laughter and said: "Chief, Hu Wumei is not a woman..."

"Not a woman? Then why is he called Wumei (Fifth Sister)?"

"His family had difficulty with heirs, with single transmission for several generations, so they gave him a woman's name."

"So that's it." Xu Yanliang laughed, "I interpreted the name too literally. Fortunately, I didn't make a joke."

"His name has confused many people. Not just you, Chief." Yuan Fei said.

"This Hu Wumei looks very good at management; this farm is done well."

"He is the second largest farm owner locally, so naturally it's good." Yuan Fei said, "When Hu Wumei came to Sanya back then, he came with the title of Mayor of Anleyou City. Later the planning changed, and this town was gone. He became the Bailiff of the First Jia of Jinling District. He is also a member of the Municipal Consultative Council of Sanya Special City. He is a semi-official figure in Jinling District. Don't look at old man Liu Xiang having more wealth and land than him and also being a member of the Municipal Consultative Council, but his words are definitely not as effective as Master Hu in Jinling District..."

"So that's how it is." Xu Yanliang nodded. Obviously, this Farm Owner Hu was an "emerging landlord" supported by the Senate.

Don't look at Hu Sanqing's sloppy old peasant appearance; his response was quite orderly. In a short while, he brought people back. He had changed his clothes: he brought several green coconuts peeled and inserted with straws, and two plates of pastries. One plate was covered with shredded coconut, looking like mochi. Xu Yanliang picked one up and tasted it; indeed, it was mochi with red bean filling. The other plate was also white pastries, trembling slightly at a touch. Taking a piece with a spoon and putting it into his mouth, it was coconut jelly, smooth and tender, overflowing with milky fragrance.

"Your Master really knows how to enjoy life; looks like he's not a country bumpkin landlord." Xu Yanliang smiled and picked up a green coconut, saying to Yuan Fei: "Come, you taste it too!"

Yuan Fei didn't decline and took a green coconut to drink.

"These are all local products; how can they be counted as enjoyment..." Hu Sanqing laughed apologetically.

"It's local produce here, but in Lingao, it's a rare thing." Xu Yanliang said, "Take this green coconut; even now in Lingao, it's not something ordinary people can afford to consume."

"Isn't it said that Lingao is also planting coconuts..." Hu Sanqing said.

Xu Yanliang was stunned. Lingao was indeed planting coconuts, but due to temperature, it was not very successful. Currently, there were only experimental plantations in a few places, and output was basically out of the question.

"You are quite well-informed." Xu Yanliang laughed, "Go to Lingao often?"

"We don't go to Lingao often, but we subscribe to newspapers. The Master reads 'Lingao Times' every day, just that we are a bit far here, so what we see are newspapers from four or five days ago."

"Your Master is quite concerned about current affairs."

"The Master said that only by caring more about the Senate's movements can one know what to do to make money. Some new things can also be known in time."

It turned out that this Hu Wumei not only subscribed to "Lingao Times" but also subscribed to various journals and magazines. There were even professional magazines like "Agricultural Technology" that Xu Yanliang hadn't even heard of. This Hu Wumei was quite fond of learning.

"Then tell me, apart from farming, what other businesses has your Master done by caring about current affairs to make money?"

"This, I dare not boast for our Master randomly." Hu Sanqing laughed, "Just last year, the Master saw news in the newspaper and said that the Senate was mostly likely to start the Northern Expedition. Once a war starts, preparing military provisions is inevitable. So he set up an aquatic product processing factory over at the port to process various smoked and cooked fish products. At first, not that much could be sold, and a lot of money was invested. The Master said it didn't matter; produce it first and store it. Later, the Logistics Department came to purchase and bought it all at once..."

Xu Yanliang nodded. In fact, as long as one paid more attention to "Lingao Times," one could catch many opportunities to get rich. But what he thought of was not Hu Wumei's business acumen, but that many opportunities were no longer graspable by small people. Rushing to set up aquatic product processing like Hu Wumei could not be done without considerable financial investment.

Of course, the expansion period of the Senate would last for many years. At least in the next hundred years, every expansion would bring enough upward opportunities for the common people. There was no need to worry for the time being.

While talking, suddenly heavy footsteps and a middle-aged man's voice were heard outside: "Where is the Chief? Why didn't you tell me sooner!"

Hu Sanqing hurriedly went out to welcome him. In a short while, a medium-sized middle-aged man walked in hurriedly. He looked just over forty, with standard short hair, wearing a short-sleeved white linen shirt blackened by sweat, and wearing a pair of linen beach shorts. The clothes were not only heavily worn but also had traces of tearing on the edges, covered with mud—probably just came back from the fields.

Upon entering the courtyard, he immediately came towards Xu Yanliang and bowed deeply: "Chief..."

"No need to be polite." Xu Yanliang waved his hand, "My surname is Xu, called Xu Yanliang. I was just transferred to Sanya from Lingao, just wandering around locally to familiarize myself with the situation. coming to your place was a spur-of-the-moment decision. Sorry to disturb your work."

"What are you saying, Chief! Having a Senator grace my humble house, this lowly one is honored for three lives, um, making my humble house shine..." Hu Wumei spoke "Guangpu," which wasn't hard to understand.

Before Xu Yanliang could speak, Hu Wumei turned to Hu Sanqing and said: "How could you just bring these things to fool the Chief! Go to the back house quickly, tell Third Aunt to bring out my Limushan Special Grade Oolong Tea! And tell the small kitchen to prepare some snacks..."

Xu Yanliang hurriedly waved his hand: "Don't go to such trouble. I'm just passing by to have a look. This coconut water is refreshing, drinking this is just right. No need to add snacks; I can't eat them. Just sit down; let's chat for a while."

Hu Wumei said: "How can that be! It's rare for the Chief to grace my humble house. Please sit for a moment, Chief Xu, and allow this lowly one to go change clothes." Without waiting for Xu Yanliang to speak, he excused himself and went out again.

As soon as he left, servants came in to deliver more fruits and snacks, filling the stone table in a moment and setting up a folding table aside.

Xu Yanliang was really surprised at a glance. Because almost all the various tropical fruits he saw in the greenhouse of Wu Nanhai's Demonstration Farm were here, such as dragon fruit, mango, watermelon, and banana. Upon asking, they were all cultivated locally.

"Sanya is indeed a good place; fruits are constant throughout the four seasons." Xu Yanliang sighed.

"Chief, taste this Tong Sui (sugar water). In Sanya, Hu Wumei's family is famous for making Cantonese Tong Sui; it is said that they specially sent people to Lingao to learn it." Although Yuan Fei said so, his own Adam's apple was moving up and down; obviously, he was craving it.

"I don't like Tong Sui much; if you like it, eat more." Xu Yanliang was secretly amused. It seemed that this Hu Wumei was indeed not from an ordinary country bumpkin landlord background. He asked: "What is this Master Hu's background?"

"He was originally a 'shopkeeper' under Zhu Cailao. After Zhu Cailao was finished, he led men and ships to defect to the Senate."

"Oh, so he is also of pirate origin."

"Yes, but he was trusted by the Senate very early—otherwise, he wouldn't have been asked to be the Jia Head here as soon as he came."

Those who could be the Jia Head of the basic unit were all backbone personnel in the Senate's grassroots.

Yuan Fei continued: "When he came to Sanya back then, he was a labor captain, managing an immigrant team of three hundred people. He also brought dozens of family members, relatives, and servants himself. Later when land was distributed, his family alone was distributed three thousand mu."
