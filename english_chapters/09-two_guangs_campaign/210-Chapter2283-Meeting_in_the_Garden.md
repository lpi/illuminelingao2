# Chapter 2283: Meeting in the Garden

Yi Haoran had matters in heart, unwilling to drink much; poured a shallow cup, ate a few mouthfuls hastily then declined saying "Full," also said going to "digest food," quietly paced to garden.

Wen Yun’s unintentional question just now made him even more vigilant. Although here was quiet, after all there were quite a few people in yard; let alone himself talking with Cai Lan about beheading business, even pleasantries and chat, with their mutual status was also greatly inappropriate.

So before he went to garden, first observed in yard for long time; confirming no one noticed him, then quietly went towards garden.

Garden very small, only about a mu size; middle was a water pond, middle was stone pillar, lotus filling pond. Facing pond was an extremely small waterside pavilion. Yi Haoran feared being seen if sitting in waterside pavilion, so sat down under big tree in corner.

Thick shade under tree covered sun; noon light spots sprinkled on ground, very dazzling. He squinted eyes looking at lotus in pond, ears filled with continuous cicada chirping sound, mood instantly became empty for it.

Feast temple supplied to Cai Lan was naturally more lavish; however neither Cai Lan nor Qiuchan had heart to eat and drink. Hastily finished eating, small Daoist sent tea water again; said to be famous tea from Seven Star Crags collected by Abbot, very precious. Cai Lan drank a few mouthfuls carelessly, couldn't taste any difference either.

After meal she was somewhat sleepy, originally wanted to take a nap here; but Qiuchan said not suitable to sleep immediately after meal, better go out to walk, digesting food before sleeping.

"This day so hot, where to walk under big sun; I don't bother moving." Cai Lan said.

"Miss you don't know, behind this yard, is a flower garden; although small, extremely exquisite. Inside many trees, has wind, even cooler than in room."

Cai Lan couldn't twist her, had to comply.

Two people strolled along flower path. Cai Lan originally spirit dizzy and heavy; now arriving in garden, cool breeze blowing gently, flower fragrance in bursts, felt spirit lifted instead.

"Garden here is even more exquisite than Three Headquarters..." Cai Lan said, "Gardens in Three Headquarters, all deserted..."

"Since Miss likes, why not ask Master Xie to renovate again; usually also having a place for sightseeing?" Qiuchan had heart to let her meet Yi Haoran, so deliberately led her to talk.

Cai Lan smiled bitterly: "Which brand of figure do I count, also worthy to raise such request! My heart died long ago; now just living a skin bag only." Said sighs.

"Miss speaks what words; I see this Elder Xie treats you not thin, must have affection and righteousness."

"He just covets flesh joy only." Although Cai Lan was a woman not stepping out of door, had natural perception force towards man's emotion, "There will be a day, he will discard me like worn shoe—but also good, that way released instead..."

"Miss speaks what words, I see definitely won't be so..." Qiuchan knew not far ahead would meet Advisor Hao, saying: "My stomach hurts a bit; Miss rest in garden for a moment, I go and come."

Cai Lan saw here lonely without people, presumably wouldn't meet strange people either, said: "You go fast return fast."

Qiuchan left; Cai Lan bored to death, walking forward along flower path. Suddenly she stopped steps, screamed a small sound surprised.

Under big tree past corner ahead, on stone bench sat a man over fifty, hair grizzled. Looking at appearance, not rich not poor, like a scholar of small comfort family. Resting with eyes closed.

Hearing her scream, Yi Haoran opened eyes—sure enough was Cai Lan. Although hadn't seen a few times, he still vaguely remembered her appearance.

Immediately got up, bowed: "Miss Cai, always good?"

Cai Lan’s first reaction was to withdraw immediately to avoid; however opposite party bowed, with her family education absolutely no reason to avoid directly—had to force a curtsey, then wanted to leave.

"Miss Cai don't go." Yi Haoran hurriedly said, "Student has an old friend's object here, want to invite Miss to verify." Saying so unfolded thing in hand; surprisingly was a fan face.

Cai Lan didn't want to look at any "old friend's object" at all; however once fan face unfolded, her originally flustered eyes instantly fixed—this fan face was too familiar!

Content of fan face was plain and ordinary, just mountain rocks, orchids and a clump of bamboo. But this picture this brush stroke she was too familiar—this was fan face she painted together with fiance Xing Chenghuan.

She surprised said: "You, you are what person?!"

"Student is a old friend of Mr. Xing." Yi Haoran put away fan, bowed slightly, "Miss Cai, Student has no evil intent. Just have a few words want to say for Miss to listen."

"I don't want to listen," Cai Lan panicked hands and feet confused, turned wanting to leave.

Yi Haoran saw many scenes; immediately sneered saying: "Miss Cai, here is Wuzhou's most incense flourishing temple; outside pilgrims weaving. If causing a scene, this fan inevitably will fall into Australian hands; at that time, nothing can be cleared..."

Sure enough, Cai Lan immediately stopped steps, turned trembling said: "You... what do you want..."

"Student said, have a few words want to speak with Miss." Yi Haoran said, "Miss you rest assured, I and Mr. Xing are also old friendship; absolutely won't do things harming his family."

This sentence was like a critical hit, hitting Cai Lan’s heart bottom deeply directly. She couldn't help trembling all over, low voice said: "You, you exactly what person? Want me how?"

"I said: Mr. Xing’s an old friend only." Yi Haoran said leisurely.

Cai Lan didn't want to talk much with this old man popping out suddenly; however at this moment whatever she did would cause disturbance, causing huge misunderstanding. Under helplessness had to nod: "Sir has words please speak."

"Please Miss sit this side." Yi Haoran seeing her submit, face turned gentle.

Cai Lan helpless, had to sit on a piece of mountain rock opposite stone bench, said: "I and Sir never knew each other; don't know what words insist on speaking to me?"

Yi Haoran put away fan, said: "Miss presumably recognizes this fan."

"This is my fiance Xing Chenghuan’s fan." Cai Lan asked in surprise, "Sir where come from?"

Fan face as calligraphy and painting sociality between literati, gifting, exchanging were not rare. But this fan was different; it was made by Xing Chenghuan and herself together: she painted orchids, Xing Chenghuan painted mountain rocks and bamboo. Speaking of it this was boudoir object; fiance absolutely wouldn't gift this fan to others casually.

"Truth not hide: Student surnamed Hao, given name Ran; originally worked in Governor Xiong Shogunate. With Mr. Xing was good friend. When he committed suicide, handed this fan to me as token, saying if I could escape with life, in future having chance to meet you, return this fan to you completely, letting you keep a thought. He said he refused to complete marriage with you back then, actually already held thought of martyring for city with body, unwilling to delay you..."

Saying so, handed fan to Cai Lan.

First half of this speech was completely fabricated; fan being Xing Chenghuan’s was not fake, just lost at banquet picked up by him. Not few days Wuzhou was connected by war disasters; Yi Haoran naturally forgot to return. At time of war chaos, he treated as own fan, stuffed in sleeve, survived instead. Second half sentence was true words.

Cai Lan taking fan, tears already rolling; hands grasping folding fan tightly, suppressing sobbing sound strongly. She came to offer incense today, originally mood already better much; this fan appearing stirred her mood messy again.

Fairly speaking, her emotion towards Xing Chenghuan didn't count as how deep; although engaged since childhood, never met a few times. It was during these few months from she fleeing to Guangdong to Wuzhou falling, counted as getting along day and night, had those few emotions. Xing Chenghuan treated her very well, yet unwilling to complete marriage consummate with her; once made her very disappointed, thinking he disliked herself—didn't expect, fiance actually thought for her like this!

Thinking again herself failed assassination; originally should be like martyr women in books, firm and unyielding, cursing thieves dying body. Result submitted to Xie Hair's hypocrisy, confusedly gave body to him... Cai Lan instantly felt shame hard to bear, five organs burning; wishing heaven immediately drop a thunder, splitting herself alive!

Yi Haoran seeing her about to weep, afraid she once loud voice attracting idle people, hurriedly said: "Miss please silence voice!"

Cai Lan silently stopped tears nodding, low voice said: "Many thanks Sir. Just Maid lowered body serving thieves... body long not clean; unworthy of Master Xing's kindness to me, also failed Sir's good intent..." Saying she handed fan back again, "Fan still please Sir take back keeping a thought; Maid unworthy to hold this fan."

"Miss words wrong." Yi Haoran thought long ago; if blindly blaming her losing chastity, result was nothing more than making her shame hard to bear, committing suicide—this had no meaning to him; if conscience long lost, messing up would even report himself out.

Only comforting her heart with way of "Forgiveness," then stimulating with Great Righteousness, could let her take risk of Anti-Hair for "Redemption."

"Miss Cai temporarily falling into mud, is also excusable. Since ancient times difficult only one death; even heroes and gallants, at time of dead end inevitably short of breath and long of emotion. Hair thieves invading Two Guangs, various prefectures and counties hearing wind surrender; big and small officials which one not full reading Sage's books, deeply receiving Imperial Grace; arriving at crisis juncture, leaving leave, surrendering surrender. Neither fighting to death nor dying for duty; eyebrowed men having read books understanding reason still like this, let alone Miss just a weak woman! Blaming with Great Integrity and Great Righteousness, inevitably loses way of Loyalty and Forgiveness."

Since "losing chastity," although Cai Lan heard quite a few people's comforting words, none explained as clearly and thoroughly as Yi Haoran. Although knowing he said these words to excuse for her, the other party's broad and kind heart unconsciously made her feel warm at heart bottom.

"Master don't excuse for Slave Maid. Starving to death small matter, losing chastity big matter. Slave Maid nothing more than an ignorant little woman, and already lost chastity; how dare compare with various Masters?"

"Hehe, this statement wrong! Two Guangs heroes and lofty ideals are many; yet which one dares to assassinate True Hair on steps of Dragon Mother Temple like Miss?!" Yi Haoran face full of righteousness, speaking even more cling clang powerful.
