# Chapter 2125 - Secret Letter

Now, outside Wuzhou city, the only entity with substantial grain reserves was the 1st Mixed Brigade. Although the brigade's supply train had stockpiled considerable military rations on Changzhou Island and elsewhere, it could only sustain the 1st Mixed Brigade for fifteen days.

The resupply efficiency from the Sanshui Joint Logistics Base was steadily declining as the supply line stretched ever longer. The available steam-powered tugboats were limited, forcing reliance on requisitioned local wooden vessels to transport supplies—and these unpowered craft moved very slowly going upstream on the West River. Getting supplies to Zhaoqing was already a strain.

They had originally counted on taking Wuzhou—a major grain trading hub—and seizing local stores to supplement military provisions. But according to all available intelligence, Xiong Wencan had already moved the grain out. Even if Wuzhou fell without bloodshed, there wouldn't be much grain left—probably not enough to feed the local populace, let alone anyone else.

Most troublesome of all, Guangdong had long depended on Guangxi for its rice supply. Now that war had broken out, the flow of Guangxi grain had been completely cut off. The entire province's food supply now fell on the Council of Elders' shoulders. Rice shipped from Southeast Asia had to be transshipped through Lingao, Sanya, and Kaohsiung to Guangzhou; the longer the supply chain, the more acute the grain crisis became.

If the 1st Brigade started providing relief to refugees, even at the bare-minimum "prevent starvation" standard, their stores would last only about a week. Even if they took Wuzhou immediately, the grain inside would be scarce, yet they would have shouldered the burden of the population—and the first step of Xiong Wencan's arson plan would surely be to burn whatever grain remained in the city.

If they didn't provide relief and let refugees scatter to fend for themselves, many would starve. First, this meant losing precious population; second, such blatant "standing by while people die" would severely damage the Council of Elders' carefully cultivated image of "benevolence" and "love for the people," undermining subsequent civil affairs work.

"I think we have no choice but to provide relief." Zhu Mingxia said after much consideration.

"Have the troops eat less and ration more out. If everyone drinks thin gruel together, we can at least hold on a few more days." Zhu Quanxing shook his head. "The problem is what happens after that. The chances of securing enough grain from Wuzhou are now close to zero. We're at the end of our supply line—our weakest point."

They had assumed that with the West River at their backs, the 1st Brigade's logistics would be the easiest. But at sufficient distance, the weaknesses of their transport capacity were fully exposed.

"For now, we can only take it one step at a time. Wuzhou must be taken, and the civilians must be fed!" Zhu Mingxia frowned.

As they were discussing, a runner came to report: Xu Ke had brought the old man who insisted on seeing a chief.

Zhu Mingxia paused. Normally, Xu Ke could handle such matters himself; bringing the old man here meant there must be important intelligence. Recalling that Xu Ke had mentioned "Lone Wolf" was active inside the city—this old man was probably his courier or something similar.

"Show them in."

Half an hour earlier, Xu Ke had already questioned Li Wensheng. As an intelligence officer, he was quite fluent in Cantonese and could converse without difficulty. When he heard the emergency contact code the old man gave, he nodded quietly, looked Li Wensheng over, and asked: "Do you know Luo Yangming? Was it he who asked you to carry this letter?"

Li Wensheng had finally met a chief. He was just wondering how to begin when the Australian spoke first. He was startled, then immediately nodded: "Yes—he is this humble one's master."

Only then did he fully explain his identity and his relationship with Luo Yangming.

"...The city is in chaos now. My master especially instructed me to deliver this letter to the chiefs—he said it could save the people of Wuzhou from fire and flood..." As he spoke, he fumbled in his shoe and produced an oilcloth packet.

Xu Ke nodded. Seeing that Li Wensheng was exhausted after a harrowing night, stomach growling audibly, he ordered tea and snacks brought.

A runner brought a cup of tea and a paper-wrapped packet of pastries. Li Wensheng tried one—crisp, sweet, and fragrant. Not bad at all. He glanced at the wrapper, which read: "Zhang's of Guangzhou City — Special for the Grand World — Cookies — Century-Old Australian Recipe."

These Australian pastries were quite tasty, he thought, and his nerves settled considerably.

Xu Ke unwrapped the oilcloth. Inside was a letter addressed to "Such-and-such shopkeeper at Such-and-such trading house in Sanshui." He broke the seal and drew out two sheets of paper, reading them by lantern light.

The content was unremarkable: given the current siege of Wuzhou and the possibility of something happening to him, this was how outstanding accounts and goods between them should be settled, and what arrangements should be made—perfectly fitting the identity of a merchant making contingency plans in the face of danger. Even if intercepted, it would cause no suspicion.

The secret was in the invisible ink written between the lines.

The External Intelligence Bureau's invisible ink was nothing exotic—mainly rice-water, essentially available everywhere. Xu Ke swabbed the paper with iodine solution, and blue characters immediately appeared.

Small-script regular characters in blue, densely packed—even the blank reverse side was covered. Xu Ke read through carefully, then smiled at Li Wensheng: "Thank you so much! This is a great gift!"

Zhu Mingxia studied the hand-copied contents of the secret letter that Xu Ke had brought. It was Lone Wolf's report. The first part described the situation inside Wuzhou. First: morale was unstable. He had already contacted a group of influential local "worthies" who, to protect their lives and property, had taken control of portions of the local military and militia, securing important government offices and granaries. However, rioters were numerous and the entire city couldn't be controlled. He urgently requested the Fubo Army to attack as soon as possible and restore order before large-scale chaos ensued. Finally, he specifically noted that Xiong Wencan's arson plan was imminent; as order collapsed, massive intentional fires could break out at any time—the consequences unthinkable.

"It looks urgent..." Zhu Mingxia finished the letter, then asked Li Wensheng a few more questions, realizing the situation inside was already dire. The observation post also reported that faint firelight could be seen within the city—apparently some areas were already burning.

If Wuzhou went up in flames, the consequences would be disastrous. Not only would the city's meager remaining grain be destroyed, but tens of thousands of civilians inside would be left homeless. The Fubo Army would then face tens of thousands of refugees without food, clothing, or shelter. For every reason—practical and moral—the Fubo Army would have to provide relief. The Sanshui joint-logistics command would have to ship not only grain but vast quantities of relief supplies to resettle the populace.

Even if the 1st Brigade took Wuzhou, the logistical burden would force them to retreat with the refugees—back to where supplies were more accessible. It would be tantamount to defeat.

The second part concerned the garrison's situation. First, rumors suggested Xiong Wencan and some key officials had already fled Wuzhou...

"He got away?!" Zhu Quanxing, who had joined the meeting, sounded faintly disappointed.

"With our numbers, a watertight blockade of Wuzhou was always going to be difficult." Zhu Mingxia said lightly. "He escaped—so be it. Capturing him would have been more trouble than it's worth."

The letter specifically mentioned that all the factions preparing to "turn coat" had agreed on a recognition signal: white cloth strips tied around the left arm. Important yamens, granaries, and towers already under control would display double lanterns as a sign. The Fubo Army was asked to take note when entering the city.

Further down: the Ming main force had split into two columns, retreating toward western and northern Guangxi—no secret, since scouts had already spotted them. Next came the locations of Ming grain depots: the letter stated that most of Wuzhou's stored grain had been shipped to Tengxian.

"How about we hit Tengxian?" Zhu Quanxing suggested. "If the intelligence is accurate, we can at least grab a large haul of grain."

Zhu Mingxia nodded. It was a good idea, though they still didn't know exactly where in Tengxian the grain was—the Ming supply depot wasn't necessarily in the county seat. Right now, Wuzhou was more urgent; they shouldn't split forces yet.

"Let's settle Wuzhou first." He glanced at his watch: 2:30 a.m. Nearly three hours until dawn. "We need to act quickly—if a citywide fire really breaks out, there's no recovering." Zhu Mingxia said. "The moment it starts getting light, we attack! Take Wuzhou as fast as possible!"

"Understood!" Zhu Quanxing replied. "The troops are ready."

Zhu Mingxia then held a brief meeting with the 1st Brigade's principal officers, sharing Lone Wolf's intelligence. Several decisions were made: First, the refugees must be properly settled and fed. Wuzhou, this key trading town at the Guangdong-Guangxi border, was one the Council of Elders intended to hold firmly; winning popular support here and laying a political foundation was essential. Even if the 1st Brigade itself was short on food, they couldn't let the refugees starve. They would also build shelters so the elderly and infirm had somewhere to escape the elements.

Second, the immediate grain problem: starting tomorrow, the troops would skip one meal a day, diverting the saved rations to the refugees. Since they now knew the Ming grain depot's location, following the Fubo Army's usual practice, they would naturally go foraging. A decision was made to send scouts to Tengxian to gather further intelligence before the next steps.

"Are the loudspeakers set up?" Zhu Mingxia asked.

"All in place," Xu Ke said.

"Write a 'Proclamation to the People of Wuzhou' and start broadcasting immediately. Even though Xiong Wencan's plan to burn the city is probably no longer a secret inside, we should still expose him. And put some pressure on those soldier-bandits—let them know that anyone who tries to loot will not end well."
