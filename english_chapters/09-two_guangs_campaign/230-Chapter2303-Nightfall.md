# Chapter 2303 - Nightfall

Liu Youwang had no idea that the chests were filled with death warrants. He only thought about how he would listen to the opera and feast tonight, and then toy with the girls in the troupe. The more he thought about it, the happier he became, oblivious to everything else as he sat in his office smoking and reading the newspaper—recently, he had taken an interest in the *Lingao Times*, which he previously cared little for. To climb the ladder, one had to study more.

Chang Qingyun, however, was not as relaxed. His forehead and palms were sweating. In his forty-plus years of life, this was the first time he had been this nervous—even the moment he had been captured alive by the bandits hadn't been this tense; that was merely fear.

While directing the preparations for Liu Youwang's nightly "dress rehearsal," he was secretly controlling the conspirators in the camp.

At Sanhezu, through internal recruitment or external infiltration, Chang Qingyun directly controlled fifty or sixty conspirators. According to Yi Haoran, there were other conspirators in the camp as well. These people were obviously backups in case he failed.

Liu Youwang had accumulated a dangerous amount of hatred in the camp; it was at the point where a single spark could ignite it. If they raised a cry from on high, the camp would erupt into chaos. However, as long as the Third Squadron outside was not pinned down, the chances of a successful riot were slim. That depended on the people outside.

Chang Qingyun did not have much confidence in the "people outside." He had served in both the bureaucracy and the military and knew that "coordination" was a very troublesome matter. Even for the Imperial Army, coordinating a simultaneous advance on a specific date was no easy task. The slightest mishap could cause the coordination to fail. Therefore, he did not dare to trust the "outside support" too much.

According to the current plan, once the signal was given in the city, they would first directly control Liu Youwang, then ignite the gunpowder in the opera chests to cause a fire, and immediately incite a riot.

Of course, without armed support from outside to harass the enemy, the Third Squadron would be able to suppress such a riot quickly if they acted fast.

However, doing so would mean the chaos at Sanhezu would inevitably draw the attention of Wuzhou City. In this way, the defenders in the city would have no time to attend to other matters, allowing the team entering the city to act with composure.

To be honest, Chang Qingyun was not too worried about his own safety. Once the riot started, it would not be difficult for him to grease his soles and slip away. The ones who would truly find it hard to escape were the "righteous men" who had infiltrated the city and Yi Haoran.

Truth be told, his emotions regarding Yi Haoran were quite complex. Originally, he had harbored resentment for being dragged into this conspiracy. Now, however, he felt a sense of awe and respect for this "pedant." Mr. Yi sought neither fame nor profit, nor even really for the Imperial Court, but solely for the two words: "Name" and "Teaching" (Confucian moral code).

In this world, pure men were rare. Yi Haoran was such a pure man. He had a premonition that this Master Yi would likely not leave Wuzhou alive.

Luo Yangming had barely warmed his seat after returning home when everyone in the household came to complain about Master Hao's arrest. They all spoke in unison: Master Hao was innocent, and he should find a way to bail him out as soon as possible.

Luo Yangming could not reveal that Master Hao's arrest was actually his own idea. He simply comforted them, saying that Chief Xie had too many things to do these past few days, and he would attend to it tomorrow when he had time.

Li Wensheng was not reassured and added, "Master! Nowadays, military law rules in Wuzhou. It represents the Master best to send a greeting to the Yamen tomorrow. Otherwise, once an order comes down to execute many people, Master Hao might get mixed up in it—once a person stops breathing, they can't be revived."

After Xie Erren entered the city, he had purged the order within the city and prosecuted rogue soldiers and criminals for arson and looting, executing hundreds on the river beach outside Wuzhou. This had left a deep impression on everyone.

"Rest assured, there have been no military tribunals recently," Luo Yangming comforted them. "Besides, the Australians follow rules. Even if it is military law, there must be a procedure, right? They can't just push someone out and behead them..."

"If Master says so, this old man is relieved," Li Wensheng said.

Unexpectedly, when they retired for the night, Wen Yun also complained, "Mr. Hao is a good scholar and has never done anything bad. He treats everyone well! Why did they suddenly arrest him? It's unreasonable!"

Because Ding Atao had her monthly period recently, it was Wen Yun who slept with him.

Luo Yangming was already a bit drowsy and replied perfunctorily.

"I told you, this is the Australians' decision; I can't do anything about it," Luo Yangming smiled bitterly. "Don't be nervous, it's nothing serious. At most, Mr. Hao will squat in a cell for a few days; they absolutely won't let him suffer..."

"I know about government lawsuits. Once you enter the depths of the Yamen, even if you are innocent, you have to squat for ten days or half a month. Even if he doesn't suffer in jail, what about Liheng's books..."

"Who is Liheng?" Hearing a strange name, Luo Yangming's drowsiness vanished instantly, and he pressed for an answer.

"It's the student Mr. Hao took in—you've been coming home so late these days, no wonder you don't know. It's Miss Jiang's son..."

"Miss Jiang?!" Luo Yangming suddenly remembered something. "Is that... Qiuchan?!"

"Qiuchan?" Wen Yun tilted her head and thought. "Yes, yes, that's her! The Mistress said she is the daughter of the Ruijin Tang Silk Shop family. Her husband was killed by rogue soldiers when Wuzhou fell, leaving only this son. Mr. Hao is a relative of her maiden family..."

As she said this, Luo Yangming vaguely recalled something; it seemed his wife had indeed mentioned this. A sudden chill ran down his spine: Wasn't this Jiang Qiuchan serving as a "companion" right beside Cai Lan?! People who seemed completely unrelated were suddenly linked together: Hao Ran - Jiang Qiuchan - Cai Lan...

Luo Yangming did not know about Zhao Fengtian's suspicion of Cai Lan, but the fact that Hao Ran's line could lead to someone beside the Chief! This immediately aroused his professional vigilance—this matter was likely not simple.

Thinking of this, he immediately threw on his clothes and got out of bed. He lit the oil lamp.

The little girl was startled by the noise of him getting up and asked in surprise, "Master, what's wrong?"

"I have urgent business and must go to the Yamen!" Luo Yangming said. "You just go to sleep."

"Master needs to go out; this servant will help you dress and call a shop assistant to follow..." Wen Yun moved to get up.

"No need, just stay at home," Luo Yangming instructed, then suddenly remembered something. "Where is your brother sleeping tonight?"

"He and the assistants are all sleeping over at the Great South Gate..." Wen Yun was confused. "There is work tomorrow. Does the Master need him?"

"I'm not looking for him," Luo Yangming said. "Just go to sleep. Don't wait up for me."

Luo Yangming changed his clothes and called a shop assistant from the storefront entrance to follow him. He rushed towards the City Government. Although Wuzhou was under curfew, he had a special pass and arrived at the City Government unimpeded, where he met Zhao Fengtian.

Hearing his words, Zhao Fengtian stood up abruptly from behind his desk, looking agitated. "No wonder!"

"No wonder what?"

"I've always felt this matter was strange. So that's it!" Zhao Fengtian immediately recounted his search for the external transfer letter. "...No wonder the transfer letter disappeared without a trace! Cai Lan was originally the biggest suspect! Only she could access the Chief's documents. Now, with your lead, the relationship between them is linked up!"

"Cai Lan might still be innocent. Jiang Qiuchan is more suspicious!" Luo Yangming said. "Don't forget, she has been by Cai Lan's side the whole time. If she really wanted to scheme, it's not impossible."

"It seems this matter isn't simple," Zhao Fengtian said. "It's hard to say who destroyed the transfer letter right now, but it's certain that Hao Ran is connected to them. It seems this Mr. Hao is a big fish..."

"Definitely! Otherwise, why would Cai Lan or Jiang Qiuchan take such a big risk to save him?!" Luo Yangming said. "In my opinion, we must interrogate him tonight!"

"No need to be so hasty." Zhao Fengtian looked at Luo Yangming's bloodshot eyes and advised, "The man has been caught; where can he run? I'll instruct Zheng Ergen to detain him in solitary confinement right away."

Having said that, he immediately summoned a naturalized staff member and ordered him to notify Zheng Ergen: "Not only must he be kept in solitary, but send someone to watch him to prevent suicide!"

"You don't need to worry about other things either. Everyone has been busy enough these past few days. Zheng Ergen doesn't have many capable men under him, so he has to do it himself? Speaking of which, this matter isn't simple; there are quite a few people involved..."

"Who else..."

"There's also Manager Da who recommended Jiang Qiuchan to Cai Lan—he needs to be investigated too. If there's a connection, we might as well make it a major case." Zhao Fengtian said, "These masters are all putting on airs; it won't do unless we show them some color." He comforted Luo Yangming again, "We can deal with this case slowly after the goods are unloaded tomorrow. Cai Lan and Jiang Qiuchan are also under our control and can't run away. We'll try the cases together then."

Luo Yangming felt his reasoning was sound. After all, it was just a scholar plus two weak women; what could they do? Besides, they were all under control. Unless they had three heads and six arms, they couldn't stir up any trouble. However, his vigilance as an intelligence officer made him think again, and he said:

"I suggest immediate interrogation. This Advisor Hao has been lurking in the city for a long time and didn't hesitate to have Cai Lan destroy the transfer letter, which shows his hiding in the city has a purpose. It's not simply avoiding trouble or gathering intelligence. A large amount of grain is arriving soon; we must guard against any enemy conspiracies..."

Zhao Fengtian thought for a moment and said, "You have a point. I'll tell Zheng Ergen to interrogate him right now!"

***

Yi Haoran was already dozing off when he was suddenly startled awake by the sound of the cell door opening. The guard outside called out:

"Hao Ran! Hao Ran!"

Yi Haoran stood up and said, "This student is here."

"Come out!"

Yi Haoran stepped out calmly and asked, "I wonder what instructions the constable has."

"We're moving you to a different place," the guard said. "Follow me!"

Yi Haoran's heart tightened. He instantly understood that the Australians knew they had caught a big fish. His time was short.

He spoke calmly: "Please lead the way, constable."
