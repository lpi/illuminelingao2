# Chapter 2121 - Leaving the City

He summoned Zhu Quanxing, the commander of the Third Battalion assigned to lead the main assault, and asked:

"How long to take Wuzhou?"

"That depends on when dawn comes," Zhu Quanxing replied.

"And after dawn?"

"Including the artillery preparation, one hour to occupy the whole city." Zhu Quanxing glanced at his watch. "The troops are already fully deployed. They're resting in rotation now."

"Good. Wait for my order. Depending on the situation, we may have to attack tonight."

"Night operations make coordination difficult. Moving the whole force could be risky."

"I'm afraid we can't afford to take our time." Zhu Mingxia handed him the intelligence summary compiled from prisoner interrogations. "Xiong Wencan may very well try to burn everything down with him—if he succeeds, we'll have no choice but to withdraw."

"Very well, I'll go back and prepare," Zhu Quanxing said. "But a night assault carries great risk. And these past few days have seen only a crescent moon—nighttime visibility is extremely low. Observation and fire will both be difficult. It would be safer to begin the attack at dawn."

Organizing large-scale troop movements for night combat was indeed highly risky. Even for the Fubo Army, the foremost "elite force" of this timeline, every nighttime combat exercise produced unforeseen complications. Getting lost was the most common occurrence.

Zhu Mingxia weighed the options again and again but couldn't make up his mind. Taking Wuzhou by night truly carried great risk: entering the city would be easy, but once inside, problems would multiply. The streets were pitch black, with no signposts; the troops lacked lighting equipment, and entering with torches would greatly increase the chance of starting fires. They had only the maps provided by the Intelligence Bureau for reference. Friend-foe identification at night would be difficult, and the city was full of routed soldiers...

If Xiong Wencan seized the opportunity to set fires, they'd have no time to escape.

Just as Zhu Mingxia was hesitating, a runner suddenly came with a report: scouts had discovered that the enemy in Wuzhou had opened the east and west gates.

"What? Are they planning a breakout?"

Although the scheme to invite the city's notables to a banquet and catch them all had failed, the operation to expel the women, children, and elderly had begun. The garrison started going door to door, driving out the populace. According to prior orders from the higher-ups, able-bodied men were to be herded aside, while the women, children, and elderly were driven toward the eastern and western gates.

At first, they still separated out the able-bodied men; but soon the soldiers tasked with the expulsion, intent on looting along the way, lost track of such "minor details" and simply drove everyone—men, women, and children alike—toward the two gates. The men, fearing for the safety of their wives, children, and parents, didn't dare cling to their possessions and joined the crowd streaming out.

Driving out the common people was merely a pretext for the guest troops to plunder; thus order quickly broke down. Some raped women; others murdered for valuables. Many civilians carrying their modest savings were stopped and searched by rampaging soldiers. Some soldiers, finding the process too tedious, simply planted their swords in the street and demanded that passing civilians "offer tribute." Those who refused to hand over their valuables were cut down on the spot; young women were dragged off to be raped in broad daylight. The streets echoed with wailing; any who heard it were moved to sorrow.

The Governor-General's yamen was by now already empty; once the staff officers learned that Governor Xiong had long since left the city, they scattered like birds and beasts. The servants and clerks left behind in the yamen ransacked whatever valuables remained. Through the open gate, rampaging soldiers and urban vermin openly came and went, plundering the few remaining goods.

Only a few areas of the city still maintained order. Street barricades had been closed, guarded by militia. They refused passage to anyone—whether official, civilian, or soldier—and anyone who approached would be met with a volley of arrows. Bloody heads were haphazardly impaled on the barricade, warning all strangers who dared approach.

Around several public granaries and yamen, the local constables, the Wuzhou Naval Camp, and garrison troops had formed security cordons, driving off rioters and looters.

Most of the Wuzhou Naval Camp soldiers were Wuzhou natives, many with homes right in the city. When the women, children, and elderly were expelled, not a few of the naval soldiers' own families were among them. Ever since the war began, Chang Qingyun, knowing the Wuzhou naval forces stood no chance, had recommended sinking all the naval camp's warships—loaded with sand and stones—at the mouth of the Gui River, leaving only a few vessels to transport provisions from Guilin Prefecture. Thus the Wuzhou Naval Camp was now a navy in name only, deployed instead as infantry.

Within Wuzhou, Xiong Wencan relied on guest troops brought from Guangxi—especially the notoriously ill-disciplined Wolf Soldiers, whom he favored most. The local garrison was dismissed as "useless," paid poorly and constantly assigned to hard labor. As a result, tensions between local troops and guest troops had always been fierce; armed clashes between host and guest forces were frequent, the two sides practically at each other's throats. This latest expulsion, which directly harmed their families, instantly ignited the already explosive tensions. Clashes erupted throughout the city.

This hostility from the local garrison was fully exploited by the local magnates; these local forces became the backbone of the "restoration" the magnates had been planning. Thanks to them, order held in some parts of the city, and many civilians escaped expulsion. Places that Luo Yangming had "reminded" them the Australians would certainly want—prefectural and county yamen, public granaries, and other public buildings—were also protected and spared from looting.

Yi Haoran walked the streets with a dozen retainers and guards, swords drawn, guns loaded. No one dared make trouble as he passed. Seeing the chaos around him, his heart ached. Yet at this moment he was powerless. The officialdom within the city had collapsed; no one was left to direct the defense. Word had it that the Cangwu County Magistrate had hanged himself in despair on his dais; the Wuzhou Prefect was nowhere to be found. Many mansions, temples, and monasteries had been ransacked by rampaging soldiers and mobs. Yi Haoran was only a staff adviser—apart from Jiang Suo and the dozen men around him, he had not a single soldier he could command.

At present, there was nothing to do but leave the city as quickly as possible. Chang Qingyun had already gone ahead; he himself could only flee with all haste.

The expelled civilians stretched in a dark mass from the Xijiang Gate along the street all the way to the Wanshou Temple in the city center. Yi Haoran knew from experience that mishandling such a crowd could easily cause a stampede; back in Liaodong, he had witnessed panicked refugees trampling many to death or injury. But at this moment, he had no capacity to maintain order. He could only tell his men to walk close to the walls, to avoid being swept away by the crowd.

Along the street, rampaging soldiers, eyes bloodshot, watched the column, looking for any remaining loot to grab. Though Yi Haoran was shabbily dressed, the retainers and guards around him drew attention. Threatening the rioters with swords and firearms, they managed to avoid being pulled out and forced to "offer tribute."

The crowd moved slowly, inching forward, passing through the gate that had only been half-opened. Nearly twenty thousand civilians took about an hour and a half to file out of the gate. As soon as they were all outside, the garrison soldiers immediately closed the gate.

Some of the expelled civilians had relatives in the surrounding countryside and dispersed to seek refuge. But many had nowhere to go—especially the women and children, many of whom had never left the city; some had never even stepped outside their homes at night. Now, in the dead of night, they were driven out of the city, surrounded by pitch darkness, unable to tell north from south. They had also heard there were many "Hair-Bandits" outside the walls. Some had been separated from husbands, fathers, or brothers. Terrified and at a loss, they could only huddle outside the barbican. When the night wind blew, infants began to cry, and soon wailing rose to the sky beneath the walls.

The garrison soldiers on the walls saw that many people were lingering outside the Xijiang Gate—perhaps several thousand, refusing to leave. A company commander began to shout down at them:

"You below! Leave the gate at once, or we'll shoot!"

After shouting several times with no response, a dozen archers loosed a volley at the crowd below. Several civilians were killed or wounded, and amid a cacophony of wailing and screaming, the crowd slowly began to disperse.

The observation post atop Bangshan watched through night-vision binoculars, witnessing the scene. They spotted over ten thousand civilians pouring out of the Xijiang Gate. These old and frail women and children were now homeless refugees, strung out for a kilometer along the Gui River beneath Wuzhou's western wall. The pontoon bridge leading to the far bank had long been destroyed by Fubo Army artillery fire; the plank bridges over the moat south of the city had also been dismantled before the war. With no way to cross the river, the refugees could only head north.

"Sir, movement!" A soldier posted outside the Dayun Gate, facing off with Ming forces, noticed something unusual across the way and immediately ran to report to Zhu Quanxing.

Through his binoculars, Zhu Quanxing at first tensed at the sight of the dark mass of people—it startled him. Could the Ming soldiers have lost their minds and decided to attack? But upon closer inspection, he realized these were unarmed civilians, all of them elderly, women, and children. Counting more carefully, he found the numbers quite substantial; though he couldn't get an exact figure, he roughly estimated at least ten thousand.

Though Zhu Quanxing hadn't yet decided how to handle them, the forces deployed near the Dayun Gate were insufficient to deal with this many refugees. He also had to consider whether Ming soldiers might be hiding among them, ready to launch a surprise attack.

"Signal immediately—call up the battalion reserve!" Zhu Quanxing ordered. "And report to Forward HQ!"

When would Dr. Zhong finally unlock the radio technology? He desperately needed a radio right now.

Compared to Zhu Quanxing at the northern perimeter, who was momentarily at a loss, Zhu Mingxia—though he hadn't seen the dark tide of refugees—soon learned of the mass exodus.

He received the forward sentries' report so quickly thanks to the efficiency of the signal corps.

At the Wuzhou battlefield, the Fubo Army was experimenting with many new tactics and techniques. Battlefield communications was one of the key projects.

The Council of Elders could certainly boast of possessing communications technology from another timeline, but in practical application, these items from another world were too precious and too difficult to replicate. So apart from the Navy—which was somewhat more lavish, with radios on capital ships—Army communications had long relied mostly on running and shouting.
