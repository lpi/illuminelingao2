# Chapter 2253: Interrogation for Loot

The bandit chiefs and minor leaders who had died in battle were all beheaded. In accordance with Bi Da’s order, except for Zhang Tianbo’s head which was packed in lime to dry and store in a head box for future public display in the county seat, the rest of the heads were all impaled on spear tips and displayed on both sides of the roads leading from Dalang Market to the county seat and Yonghua.

"Should we send the prisoners back to the county with the Mountain Company?" According to Luo Yiming’s idea, he prepared to escort them all back to the county seat to hold a public trial rally and then execute the ringleaders as a warning to others.

Bi Da thought for a moment and said, "No need! The roads are not peaceful right now. Even if we send troops to escort such a large group of prisoners, it is hard to guarantee safety. Sun Dabiao’s gang has been destroyed, but his sworn brothers are still around; they might ambush us in an attempt to snatch the prisoners, needlessly increasing casualties. We will dispose of them on the spot. Save having long nights and many dreams—besides, this is Sun Dabiao’s old nest; it has the same deterrent effect."

Since they were to be disposed of locally, the spectacle naturally could not be small, otherwise, it would not serve to deter the petty criminals. Therefore, it was decided to wait until the militia sent by the county to move the war booty arrived, then hold a ceremony in front of everyone before executing them.

"Before that, we have to force the information about these bandit leaders' wealth out of them."

Thus, this Dalang Market instantly became a Shura Hell. On the cleared open ground of the ruins, torture racks were set up, and prisoners were escorted out in batches and tied up on them for "interrogation."

First were those famous bandit leaders. Except for Sun Dabiao—Bi Da instructed to leave him for last, to avoid accidentally killing him first during the torture.

The torture to force out the booty was conducted right on the market ground. Four soap-squad yamen runners who had rushed from the county commanded, selecting minions captured from guarding the "Ticket House" to do the hands-on work. The yamen runners wanted to show off their skills, while the small minions hoped to "atone for crimes with merit." One by one, they had no taboos and took turns going into battle. Various torture instruments: what the county yamen had, they had here; what the county yamen didn't have but the bandit den had, they also had here. Torturing day and night, the bandits' screams and wails did not cease day or night. On the first day, three were tortured to death alive.

The prisoners were all gathered on the market ground to "observe," each trembling with fear. Having been bandits for many years, it used to be only them torturing commoners and tickets; they had long held a sense of superiority in controlling the life and death of others. At this moment, seeing their former associates being tormented and tortured, tortured until they were half-dead, they finally realized that tyranny was not their privilege—one day it would also fall upon themselves.

"Report to the Magistrate, these few won't do—if we continue beating them, I'm afraid they'll expire on the spot..." A yamen runner came to report.

"How much booty have they confessed?"

"Quite a lot, but none is here; they must be excavated one by one."

"For all booty not located locally, spare their lives for now and treat their injuries—don't let them die too fast," Bi Da instructed. "Bring the next batch to question."

The yamen runners knew the meaning of this female magistrate with a fiendish look, immediately acquiesced, took the men down from the torture racks, and dragged another few out from among the prisoners.

These few were already pale-faced. Seeing someone coming to pull them, some collapsed to the ground, unable to speak, while others trembled all over and struggled desperately. One of them shrieked, "This small one is willing to confess! This small one is willing to confess!"

"For those willing to confess, give them paper and pen; require them to write everything clearly one by one," Bi Da instructed. "For those unwilling to confess, you continue serving them."

"Yes!" The yamen runner answered, then smiled apologetically, "This small one asks the Lord for instructions: can we rest for a moment? Since early morning until now, except for eating, we haven't rested—can barely lift our arms."

Bi Da nodded. "You have worked hard. Let the prisoners loosen up slightly for a moment."

"That isn't necessary. The small ones have a way to rest while making them confess," the yamen runner laughed.

This method was "Sitting on the Toilet." After bandits caught a "fat pig," in order to torture out the hoarded gold, silver, and wealth, they would light a candle or a small pile of charcoal in a toilet bucket and have the "fat pig" tie-sit bare-bottomed on the toilet bucket. With slow fire tormenting from below, in less than a few minutes, the tortured "fat pig" would cry to heaven and hit the earth. This method worked every time.

When the few being interrogated saw the toilet bucket and candle being brought over, they knew this meant "please enter the jar" (a taste of their own medicine). One by one, they let out sounds of despairing weeping and wailing. Bi Da, however, was completely unmoved, merely flipping through the large stack of "confessions" in her hand.

The content of the "confessions" was very complicated. Besides their hidden property locations, there was also everything they knew about the situation in the county. Under severe torture, in order to suffer a few less bouts of pain, they practically told everything they had.

From these confessions, Bi Da could see the ambiguous relationship between many wealthy households in the county and the bandits—she did not feel surprised. For local magnates, whether it was false compliance for appeasement or collusion for villainy, cooperating with bandits was nothing new.

However, with this black material in hand, it would be the basis for punishing the wealthy households in the future. Bi Da narrowed her eyes and looked at the distant mountains. As for how to punish them, it depended on whether they would "cooperate" with the work next.

Reading further down, as expected, the bandits effectively colluded with the Yao people too. It confirmed what Chief Huang had said: every time the Yao people rioted, local treacherous people seduced and coordinated with them.

This situation in Yangshan could truly be called a tangled mess. Bi Da thought, *If one wants to sort it out one by one, it cannot be done without three to five years. At present, the only way is to cut the tangled hemp with a sharp knife, clearing various hidden dangers in one stroke...*

Just as she was pondering the problem, suddenly someone came to report, "Pan Tianshun has arrived!"

"Invite him over."

Pan Tianshun received Bi Da’s order with mixed joy and disappointment. Joy that Sun Dabiao, this bane of the Yonghua Yao people, had finally been beheaded and captured, avenging a great enmity; disappointment because he had originally planned to use the full turnout of Yonghua Yao able-bodied men for the county's service as a condition to demand the occupation of Dalang Market henceforth.

Unexpectedly, this female magistrate had destroyed Sun Dabiao without a sound! Although Pan Tianshun was somewhat disappointed, the element of happiness was still the majority. Hearing that he was asked to return to Yonghua to recruit soldiers, he knew the county explicitly still intended to rely on the Yonghua Yao people, so he immediately took people on the road.

As soon as they arrived at the entrance of Dalang Market, they saw two large grave mounds standing by the road. Many spears were erected on the grave mounds and both sides of the road, impaling heads that had been dried of blood with lime. He could not help but be secretly alarmed. Walking to the entrance place, he saw a head receiving "treatment" different from the others, individually packed in a head box, with a banner hanging below: "Head of Zhang Tianbo."

Pan Tianshun naturally knew Zhang Tianbo's great name. Seeing the head of this illustrious one of the Three Tyrants hanging at the intersection with a ferocious face, he couldn't help but sigh with emotion in his heart.

Since he was passing through Dalang Market, Pan Tianshun thought he should still pay a visit to offer congratulations—after all, this girl would be the "Marquis of a Hundred Li" (Magistrate) here in the future. The quality of the Yonghua commoners' days depended entirely on her. Moreover, looking at her conduct, she was clearly not of the same path as Old Master Wang of the past; it was better to be exceptionally submissive.

"Pan Tianshun, the Magistrate is calling for you," Zhou Da said arrogantly.

"Yes, may I trouble Little Brother to lead the way." Pan Tianshun was very polite.

He had just heard that Bi Da was "Interrogating for Loot" and secretly wondered—he hadn't heard of a magistrate managing this. Could it be the county was truly difficult to such an extent? Only when he stepped into the torture scene did he know it wasn't for a bit of money.

On the wooden racks, bloody bodies were tied or hung one by one. Branding irons were stuck in raging fires; the ground was littered with blood-stained leather whips, rattan canes, bamboo paddles... squeeze-sticks of various sizes, finger-presses... Shocking large puddles of blood, vomit, and excrement covered the mud floor.

The screened bandit chiefs, large and small, were separately locked in rough wooden cages. Among them were big chiefs like Sun Dabiao, and also small chiefs who led only three or four bandits. At this moment, they no longer had their initial air of arrogance; their appearances were listless as they squatted in the cages, each posing as if closing their eyes to await death.

Beside the field, seven or eight corpses tortured to death were discarded, each appalling in appearance and beaten out of human shape... Pan Tianshun didn't dare to look again after one glance, only feeling a stream of cold air pouring straight down from his head to his feet—*this woman is truly vicious!*

However, he didn't dare to show a hint of this meaning. He still walked respectfully to Bi Da’s front—because the Australians did not practice kneeling, he bowed ninety degrees and spoke some words of congratulation.

"Not at all, you speak too politely," Bi Da said. "This is all the comrades' credit. You Yonghua commoners also exerted great effort."

"Not at all, not at all. Sun Dabiao’s gang harmed Yonghua for many years; it is the Magistrate removing a harm for us—the Yonghua commoners are endlessly grateful. The small ones are willing to be driven before the Magistrate’s horse."

Bi Da smiled. Although her smile did not imply a sneer, it made Pan Tianshun shiver with cold fear.

"The small one will now obey the order to return to Yonghua to recruit soldiers. I do not know if the Magistrate has any other instructions; the Yonghua commoners will definitely exert themselves to repay..."

"Repaying or whatnot is not needed; you are also in difficulty. Many able-bodied men were killed or wounded. I will be very satisfied if you bring one hundred able-bodied men." Bi Da did not know the thoughts in his heart but was quite sincere. "When you go back, tell the leaders of the various stockades that the market fair here at Dalang Market will soon be restored. The county has also transferred a lot of salt and general goods here. Ask them to come over to trade—fair buying and selling, deceiving neither old nor young."

"Yes, yes, this is all the grace of you, Old Elder Magistrate. As soon as this small one goes back, I will proclaim to the various stockades and tell them to bring goods to trade."

"You overpraise. As the head of a county, I must protect the peace of a region; it cannot be called any merit or virtue." Bi Da felt Pan Tianshun's attitude was a bit strange, wondering what was wrong with this Yao headman? Suddenly she heard a few "Sitting on the Candle" bandit chiefs screaming miserably for mercy again, and only then did she suddenly understand.

She had originally wanted to comfort him with a few sentences, but thinking of the chaotic and complex situation in the county, letting this Yonghua Yao headman maintain a certain heart of fear was not a bad thing.

"Go quickly and return quickly. The county still needs you to handle matters."

"Yes, this small one will definitely handle it well and return as soon as possible, daring not to delay the assignment!"

"Go to the Dragon Mother Temple warehouse," Bi Da wrote a slip. "First receive a salt ticket for one thousand *jin* of salt. Issue ten *jin* to every enlisted able-bodied man."
