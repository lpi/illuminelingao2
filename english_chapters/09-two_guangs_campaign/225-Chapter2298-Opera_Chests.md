# Chapter 2298: Opera Chests

"Just walk and look." Chang Qingyun said; Liu Youwang’s "Ambition" if in normal times, could figure slowly, sowing discord... tricks to play were many. But right now grain boat arriving immediate; also no time to play these tricks. He cared more about another matter:

"Just this Opera Chest matter, currently has eyebrow eye (clue)? This Liu Youwang asks this matter every day. I didn't expect this person opera addiction so big." He shook head said.

"Opera Chest has." Yi Haoran smiled, "Just no meaning. Can't take out."

"Oh? At where?"

"Just inside Three Headquarters—in General Town Office’s warehouse." Yi Haoran said, "I learned from an old clerk, Wanli Era Wuzhou’s Guarding Eunuch liked listening opera; specially brought an opera troupe and full set Opera Chests from north; when leaving office person left, these costumes Opera Chests moving inconvenient, then throw all in Wuzhou. Putting is several decades—these years no one moved; should preserve still good."

"This isn't same as none." Chang Qingyun disappointed said. Three Headquarters now was forbidden area; entering leaving personnel all had strict management. Even Liu Youwang himself had no method to extract Opera Chests out.

"It is useless; but anyhow can provide an excuse for you." Yi Haoran said.

"Also only can so." Chang Qingyun nodded, "I go back first."

He stood up wanting to leave; suddenly Yi Haoran called him stop: "Slow!"

"?"

"I suddenly had a stratagem; just don't know if appropriate..."

"You just say come listen." Chang Qingyun had interest.

"Just this method still has to search from Opera Chest."

"Opera Chest can't take out; only call helplessness!"

Yi Haoran nodded: "With our ability naturally can't take out. But, calling Liu Youwang go, maybe works."

"This, afraid not working." Chang Qingyun embarrassed said, "Liu Youwang although recently listening opera somewhat obsessed, matter heavy light always still understands: Three Headquarters is now Hair thief’s forbidden land; even if he wants to enter have to notify in advance; absolutely impossible to take out quietly..."

"Then let pass bright road (openly) take out." Yi Haoran said, "He anyhow is also one of local Fake Hair chiefs, doesn't have this bit face?"

"This really hard to say." Chang Qingyun frowned saying, "Now is exactly war fire military might time; wanting to get opera troupe? Liu Youwang afraid date not go to ask..."

He speaking suddenly stunned; a thought instantly rushed onto his heart head—doing so perhaps has drama (chance)! Chang Qingyun secretly thought. Thinking here, he nodded: "Good, then try try look."

"You have method?"

"Although no ten parts assurance, also have six seven parts." Chang Qingyun said, "Just you have what strategy?"

"You just listen me say..."

Chang Qingyun returned to camp; told matter of Opera Chests one five one ten to Liu Youwang.

"Old Chang, aren't you equal to finding nothing?" Liu Youwang somewhat dissatisfied said. Three Headquarters now was forbidden area; entering leaving checking very tight; even naturalized citizens couldn't enter leave at will. Moreover moving seven eight big boxes out from inside!

"Ashamed ashamed."

"You don't ashamed either; say listen look; can still think what method? Can't assume this Opera Chest only General Town Office has."

Chang Qingyun said: "Right now inside this Wuzhou city, having full set Opera Chest, really only General Town Office has—this thing originally wasn't ordinary people could afford to prepare..." He stopped, looked at Liu Youwang, "Student actually still has a method."

Xie Erren didn't know current dark current surging; someone wanted to give him "Color" to see. In his view, currently Wuzhou’s situation already improved largely. First was Guangxi aspect battles connecting victories; Huang Chao in North Guangdong also stabilized situation; not only defeated bandits, also controlled range of rioting Yao people inside Lianyang Three Jurisdictions; didn't expand further. Rapidly expanding National Army although combat power not high, loss very big, but through large scale stationing various county cities, traffic main roads and road patrol, effectively contained Xiong Wencan’s plan of "Indulging Soldiers Being Bandits"; various places and roads security had obvious improvement.

These victories reflecting on Wuzhou’s civil sentiment, was decline of various rumors; original "Australian no good" rumor once dust clamor straight up; making Wuzhou city inside people heart panic. Following victory reports continuously coming also gradually vanished voice extinguished track.

Even folk criticism biggest, once like rein off wild horse grain price problem, after transmitting news Australian grain boat fleet about to arrive also appeared small range falling back. This was first time after Wuzhou Recovery.

This news was after he received grain departed from Sanshui, ordered naturalized citizen cadres intentionally leak out. Sure enough effect brilliant. This kind small method although counted nothing; but made Xie Erren feel very complacent.

People heart gradually peaceful; inside Wuzhou border although still had small group bandits making chaos, but already no big worry; inside outside city security condition improved largely. Bringing along now convening Assembly Bureau meeting also rarely had representatives absent.

Right now he various matters smooth hand; quite had feeling of ambition satisfied will full: didn't expect self indeed had governing world quite managing administration talent! Back then he applied external transfer serving as local main official still somewhat anxious. Going to Liu Muzhou and Ming Lang place talking; inside heart even more no bottom—because talk lasting time had more than one hour; seemed simple random, actually was an "Interview."

Although finally his interview "Qualified," even might be excellent—otherwise wouldn't give heavy town like Wuzhou to him. But Xie Erren after all no what local administrative work experience to speak of. Rashly taking over a hundred wastes waiting to prosper medieval city. He however "Ambition Stored High Far," heart also no bottom.

Now hardest enduring part finally passed; right now not only government affairs smooth hand; Cai Lan’s change even made Xie Erren’s self confidence explode. He now started setting hand gathering material, preparing to use administration experience understanding in Wuzhou receiving, governing process write into long feature article, finding a suitable timing send back Lingao, publish on "Two Journals One Paper"—since decided walking local administrative chief this route, had to accumulate political capital for self as soon as possible.

Just when he was thinking how to plan this long report on overall, someone came in report:

"Sanheui Camp Manager Liu Youwang came, says wants to report work to Chief face to face."

"Oh? How he came." Xie Erren both somewhat surprised, also felt happy.

Liu Youwang this person usually rarely showed face in Wuzhou city. Xie Erren’s impression to him actually not bad. Bad things Liu Youwang did in Sanheui weren't a bit didn't transmit to his ears. He more or less from naturalized citizens, retained personnel mouth knew some rumors of his doings. But this after all was road hearsay rumors; no one could take out true proof real evidence.

Xie Erren felt, rumor definitely had certain truthfulness—after all such things in Lingao also couldn't do completely extinct; let alone such newly opened area. In his mind, Liu Youwang roughly was Fu Youdi (corrupt but capable figure reference) character. Having capability, private moral poor. After all he as one of Wuzhou local most important naturalized citizen cadres, under situation of completely not equipped subordinate, only relying on retained personnel managing several thousands captives and refugees in Sanheui Camp—these people both were human resources, could also be a bucket of gunpowder exploding anytime—he not only managed camp orderly, didn't erupt riot. Also implemented executed various assigned tasks one by one in place, not vague a bit. And these achievements were completed under premise of outside having security pressure, internal grain supply insufficient. Just this work ability, among naturalized citizen cadres counted quite outstanding. Xie Erren even had thought of recruiting him.

Xie Erren since decided walking local administrative chief route, then was very caring about naturalized citizen cadres; after all these people were left arm right arm after arriving local. Own pocket inside must have a few backup candidates.

However Liu Youwang towards him somewhat cold; several talks all looked left said other. And other naturalized citizen cadres mostly were moment moment coming before him turning; having matter no matter all wanted to come "Report Work," fearing not able to leave impression to him. Only this Liu Youwang was no matter not enter city; after entering city meeting finished affairs done then leave; resolutely not stay in city more. Usually nesting in Sanheui.

Xie Erren for a time somewhat confused; didn't know if he was pretending stupid or real stupid.

Later he consulted Liu Youwang’s cadre file; seeing he before joining army once worked under Agricultural Committee Huang Chao, then "Suddenly Realized": turn out this Liu Youwang was Huang Chao’s person; no wonder attitude cold to self!

But he didn't die heart—this Huang Chao going North Guangdong, administrative team selected didn't choose Liu Youwang; showing Liu in his mind status not high; belonged to character not bearing heavy responsibility. This way, later still could dig foot of wall.

"Invite him come in." Didn't know he wanted to talk what matter with self? Xie Erren unconsciously still somewhat expected.

"Report Chief!" Liu Youwang attention saluted a military salute, "Liu Youwang comes to report work."

"You please sit." Xie Erren looked at man before eyes with interest. Liu Youwang’s face appearance he always not quite liked; although skull appearance, face appearance in 21st century were denounced as "Pseudoscience," talking up meant very not complying "Political Correctness"; but relying on his many years media work experience, these things not nonsense talk. This Liu Youwang grew exactly a typical lower class villain appearance.

"Yes, Chief, thank Chief." Liu Youwang heart somewhat anxious. At beginning listening Chang Qingyun’s suggestion he very hesitant: he liked listening opera however also knew heavy light: Chang Qingyun thought reason for him very high sounding dignified; but speaking to bottom singing opera listening opera all were pastime; at this juncture self personally coming ask for Opera Chest, would or not be regarded as "Not Knowing Big Body" by Chief? Moreover various bad things self did in camp hard to avoid transmitting to Chief’s ears; in case provoking Chief angry, new account old account calculate together, he could count finished ball.
