# Chapter 2315 - Two Directors

Lingao, General Bureau of Political Security, Director's Office.

Ma Jia, Director of the Political Security Bureau of the Senate, sat in the rattan chair behind the desk, holding a "Top Secret" report with a red label in his hand.

Whether the desk, the rattan chair, or this office, Ma Jia probably used them no more than ten times a year. He basically only came to use them when signing documents that had to be signed by the Director. After using them, he would leave quickly, ending his work as "Director of the Political Security Bureau" in two or three hours.

In the Bureau, most ordinary staff wouldn't notice there was such a "Director." Let alone naturalized cadres, even most Senators had largely forgotten that he was the Director of the Political Security Bureau. This was probably the most non-existent of Ma Jia's many concurrent posts.

Today was not originally a day for him to "attend to Bureau affairs," but a phone call from Deputy Director Zhao called him out of his office in the Ministry of Justice.

Ma Jia kept a tacit understanding with Director Zhao since the Political Security Bureau existed. Unless it was an emergency, this fat man wouldn't call him over.

Sure enough, after reading the document clearly marked "Top Secret, Only One Copy," Ma Jia realized he was holding a hot potato.

To be honest, he never thought a Senator would make such a big fool of himself. Although details in the report were limited, judging from the summary of the "Wuzhou Area Weekly Routine Report" sent by the local Hidden Cadre attached to the back of the report, this Elder Xie, with whom he wasn't very familiar, had committed almost every low-level error possible.

"When did the report arrive?"

"Two days later than Xie Erren's report transferred from the Guangdong Region," Zhao Manxiong said.

"What classification is Xie Erren's report?"

"General Incident Report level." Zhao Manxiong leaned back against the chair back, speaking comfortably. "Urgency is normal; classification is Confidential."

"No wonder I felt something was strange when I saw his report. So there's such a hidden story inside." Ma Jia tapped the table with his finger. "I see his intention is to gloss it over."

"That's normal. Being raided into the city and getting snatched from the command center—just this is losing face to the extreme. If the absurd things he tossed around earlier are dragged in, Old Xie won't be able to mix in the Senate anymore."

Cai Lan attempted to assassinate a Senator, yet Xie Erren, without any procedures, placed her directly by his side and even let her access confidential documents. If this matter exploded, even if Wen (Desi) and Ma (Jia) came out to protect him together, they couldn't save him.

"At least he wasn't caught by the Ming army," Ma Jia said. "Otherwise, it would be a mega-earthquake for the Senate—I can already imagine the scene of the massive tear-down during the Senate meeting..."

"Even now, there's probably a huge war of words to be fought in the Senate," Zhao Manxiong said. "I think similar reports aren't just here with me..."

"You mean other departments..."

"Exactly. Although Xie Erren is the highest military and administrative officer in Wuzhou, he doesn't cover the sky with one hand. Besides us, the Volte Army, National Army, Taxation, and Police are all vertically managed. Theoretically, they can all report directly to their direct superiors. Of course, some departments might not be willing to get involved in this matter—it doesn't concern them much anyway. For example, Taxation. Wang Qiyi probably knew earlier than us, but they probably will pretend not to know..."

"As for whether the Military and Police are willing to reveal it, it depends on how much responsibility they bear," Ma Jia said. He understood Zhao Manxiong's meaning. The army, police, and political security all had undeniable responsibilities in this incident. Once the Senate investigated, it would be very troublesome.

Given the nature of the opposition faction in the Senate, this matter would inevitably be used by them to send a punitive expedition. So all three parties had pressure to shift the blame. As long as Elder Xie's "crimes" were thrown out, things like "accountability" would basically fizzle out—because the common characteristic of these opposition factions was the unrestrained magnification of "Senator Power."

If they took Xie Erren's report as the standard, then although he had certain responsibilities, the key issue was that the Senate invested too little power in Wuzhou. Xie Erren encountering this failure could be considered unavoidable—it could even be said he barely maintained the situation under extremely difficult circumstances.

"You can look at the article in this *Wuzhou Highlights*," Zhao Manxiong took out a single-sheet mimeographed tabloid from the file bag. These kinds of *XX Communications* or *XX Highlights* were small newspapers self-published by local governments at all levels under the Senate, serving propaganda and communication functions.

"This is the *Wuzhou Highlights* from the third day after the incident. It mainly features this dispatch: 'Fear Not the Demons and Monsters, They Vanish When the Sun Comes Out.' By the way, this dispatch was sent to the Propaganda Department yesterday, asking to be published in *Weekly Highlights*. Ding Ding was unsure about it, so he hasn't published it yet."

Ma Jia picked up the newspaper and read it carefully, noting down key points from the article as he read:

1. The cunning and cruelty of the Ming army and bandits.
2. The objective situation in Wuzhou was too harsh. Despite the Senate's strong support, Elder Xie's exhaustive efforts were hard to change things in a short time. This gave the enemy an opportunity.
3. Facing the enemy's elite surprise attack, Elder Xie remained calm in chaos, commanding with composure. He completely disregarded personal safety, sending the troops around him to rescue the people.
4. When the enemy fought to his face and all guards around him sacrificed themselves, Elder Xie still held a weapon and fought the enemy to the death. Regrettably, he was wounded and exhausted in battle; only after a failed suicide attempt was he kidnapped.
5. After being kidnapped, Elder Xie still cursed the enemy loudly, never yielding.
6. To rescue Elder Xie, the vast number of naturalized cadres, officers and soldiers of the army, and the people of Wuzhou spontaneously organized to fight the enemy to the death, wave upon wave. A large batch of heroic figures represented by Luo Yangming emerged.
7. This incident proved that no matter how cunning the enemy, they are no match for the Senate and the people. These jumping clowns hindering historical development will eventually be crushed by the wheels of history!
8. This victory was achieved under the wise leadership of the Senate and with the support of the broad masses. Elder Xie and the vast naturalized cadres and soldiers also withheld the test, practicing their oath to serve the Senate and the people in blood and fire.

"This writing style! It really has a set. A strong flavor of treating a funeral as a wedding. I think Xie Erren wrote it himself. Worthy of a professional reporter background. Naturalized citizens don't have this skill." Ma Jia laughed after reading. "He is seizing the high ground of public opinion first. Anyway, his capture can't be hidden."

"That's the thing." Zhao Manxiong nodded with a smile. "He naturally can't mention the most important things."

Once the matter of Xie Erren and Cai Lan exploded, not only would Xie Erren's own political career end, but it would also slap the faces of those advocating "Senators Above All." To put it plainly, this matter was the result of Xie Erren abusing Senatorial power.

"You are right." Zhao Manxiong nodded. "So I reckon this matter cannot be covered up in the end. You probably don't know: not long after Xie Erren's report arrived in Lingao, quite a few people in the Senate were already uniting, preparing to make trouble. I estimate in a few days, someone will propose convening a hearing."

"The spearhead will naturally be the Political Security Bureau."

"From the first day our department was established, the people in the Senate wanting to get rid of us haven't been few." Zhao Manxiong spoke unhurriedly. "This time gave them an excellent reason."

"Naturally, we can't let these people succeed." Ma Jia said. "What is the situation in Wuzhou now?"

"The key witness in this case, Cai Lan, has already committed suicide," Zhao Manxiong said. "I have to say, the comrades' awareness as the ruling class is getting higher day by day. As for the other few witnesses, I think they won't live to the day the hearing convenes."

"What about our man in Wuzhou?"

"He was originally from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau," Zhao Manxiong said. "Although he is now our Hidden Cadre, he falls under dual leadership. Our control over him is limited. I estimate Jiang Shan has also received this report."

"Now it gets lively." Ma Jia muttered to himself.

He didn't care much about Xie Erren's fate anymore. Although his report was written well and the matter was handled methodically, this affair definitely couldn't be covered up.

Of course, to maintain the Senate's face, the Senate might superficially accept Xie Erren's report as standard. But privately, it would definitely cause an earth-shattering row. Even if the "Unlimited Senatorial Power Faction" fizzled out, there was another group of Senators wanting to "Purge the Senate." Needless to say, giving them this incident as ammunition would have too great a lethality.

"We don't need to discuss Xie Erren's matter further," Ma Jia said. "You called me here surely to talk about how we respond at the hearing?"

"That is so."

Ma Jia looked at Zhao Manxiong's rather calm face, seeming to have a plan in mind. He asked, "What idea do you actually have? Tell me everything."

"I think you certainly haven't forgotten the proposals I requested from you at every General Assembly, Standing Committee meeting, and various other meetings of the Senate in recent years, right?"

"Oh?" To be honest, Ma Jia handled hundreds of proposals. Although he was the Director of the Political Security Bureau, he never intervened in relevant work, so he naturally didn't remember any relevant proposals.

"To be honest, I don't remember well. But I definitely have archives for any proposal. I'll just go back and check." Ma Jia smiled somewhat embarrassedly.

"Here are the relevant file numbers for these proposals, reports, and applications." Zhao Manxiong took out a memorandum. "You definitely have them there. The General Office definitely has archives too. You can retrieve them first to take a look." He sighed. "Since the Disturbance in Lingao incident, I realized we might need to be prepared, so I sorted out all these relevant documents from over the years."
