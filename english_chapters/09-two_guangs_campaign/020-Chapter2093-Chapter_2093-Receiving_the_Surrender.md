# Chapter 2093 - Receiving the Surrender

If they couldn't quickly establish control over the counties under Zhaoqing Prefecture, and the Yao tribespeople on both banks of the West River began to revolt, it would certainly affect the Council's pacification work in western Guangdong and tie down Fubo Army forces.

Two major tasks confronted Zhu Mingxia: swiftly occupy Wuzhou to establish Council rule over all of western Guangdong, and simultaneously "pacify the Yao" to keep the mountain settlements quiet.

From Zhaoqing to Wuzhou itself, there were no longer any defensible positions. Though the shoals downstream of Wuzhou prevented the river gunboat *Zhujiang* from proceeding further, large landing craft alone would be enough to breach any enemy defense line. If the river transit went smoothly, taking Wuzhou would be a matter of hours.

However, the tactical and equipment adaptations shown by Ming forces during the Antelope Gorge breakthrough made Zhu Mingxia realize that, despite its utter decay, the Ming military still had a few insightful individuals exploring ways to improve combat equipment and tactics at low technological levels. Though these improvements were far too minor to affect the Fubo Army's advantages, under certain favorable circumstances they could still inflict casualties. He needed to prepare accordingly.

"The entire brigade will rest at Zhaoqing for two days," Zhu Mingxia ordered.

Since the liberation of Guangzhou, the First Brigade had been constantly moving by boat. Though travel by water conserved energy, prolonged inactivity caused poor circulation and stiff muscles. Some exercise at Zhaoqing would benefit the next phase of operations.

The First Brigade's headquarters was established at the Naval Battalion barracks outside the East Gate. Though the "surrendered" county registrar and local gentry had kowtowed and begged him to relocate to the famous local scenic spot "Seven Star Crags"—a gentry member had offered his villa as his residence—the location was too far from the West River. Zhu Mingxia chose the Naval Battalion quarters instead.

Staying close to one's troops at all times was the surefire method for maintaining command. Zhu Mingxia practiced this regardless of which time-space he commanded in.

Within the Naval Battalion compound were several temples. The brigade headquarters was established in the Northern Emperor Temple—though called a temple, it was really just a small courtyard. A conference table in the main hall, maps on the wall—that was the command center.

"Have all units arrived?" Zhu Mingxia asked, studying the map.

"Third Infantry Battalion and brigade direct-support units have arrived. Eighth Infantry Battalion is expected to arrive in full by 1600 hours," the staff officer reported.

"And the National Army units taking over Zhaoqing?"

"En route. They should arrive tomorrow morning. First batch: two companies."

"Too few." Zhu Mingxia dropped the comment. "Have the surrendered officers and generals arrived?"

"All waiting outside."

Not many Zhaoqing officials had surrendered. The only civil official was the Gaoyao County registrar; among garrison officers, just a squad leader; among Guard officers, only a *zongqi*—all minor figures.

"Have them wait in the courtyard."

The surrendered officers gathered in the courtyard. Aside from Gaoyao County Registrar Lan Rutian, who had surrendered voluntarily, most had been too low-ranking to qualify for evacuation. When the city fell, unable to escape and unwilling to die, they surrendered. Guard officers predominated among them.

They mostly looked bedraggled—especially the Guard officers. After the city fell, the various garrison settlements had erupted in riots. Officers with heavy blood-debts had mostly been slaughtered. These men had been minor figures—not deeply resented—but many had been beaten and robbed in the chaos; some had nearly lost their lives. Had the Fubo Army not arrived quickly to restore order, they might not have lived to "submit to the Song."

When Zhu Mingxia appeared on the steps, the civil and military officers led by Lan Rutian were momentarily startled. Zhu Mingxia wasn't wearing a senior officer's dress uniform but standard fatigues—except for the peaked cap distinguishing him from enlisted men, he was virtually indistinguishable from the ordinary soldiers standing guard in the courtyard.

"Colonel Zhu Mingxia, Brigade Commander, First Mixed Brigade, Fubo Army!" the adjutant announced in a loud voice.

Only then did the surrendered officers realize this was a "pirate" high official. Lan Rutian stepped forward, leading them in the ceremonial court bow.

Zhu Mingxia waved his hand: "No need. Everyone, rise."

"Yes!" A unified chorus echoed through the courtyard.

"Your decision to forsake darkness and embrace the light—on behalf of the Council of Elders and the Fubo Army, I extend a warm welcome!" Zhu Mingxia stood on the steps without setting up a formal seat.

"We thank the General..." Lan Rutian led a deep bow.

"You are...?" Zhu Mingxia asked.

"This humble official is Lan Rutian, registrar of Gaoyao County—formerly of Ming-dynasty Gaoyao County."

"Good. I understand you were already one of our comrades—"

"Yes. Last year, this humble official came over from darkness to serve the Council of Elders," Lan Rutian said respectfully.

"Good." Zhu Mingxia nodded. "I hereby appoint you Deputy County Magistrate of Gaoyao County, acting in charge of county administration!"

"Yes! Thank you, sir, for the opportunity!" Lan Rutian dropped to his knees and knocked his head on the ground three times, tears of gratitude streaming.

Though the surrendered officers didn't know what "Deputy County Magistrate" meant exactly, they understood it was similar to a county deputy magistrate—essentially second-in-command of the county. For a former registrar—at the very bottom of officialdom—this was a leap of three ranks. Under the Ming system, a registrar rising to county magistrate or deputy was nearly impossible; such cases were rare exceptions.

"Since you're acting county head, let me first give you a few assignments," Zhu Mingxia said. "First: relief and comfort for the people. I've seen the city—rioters and bandits have done some damage. Some homes have been burned; some people have been robbed of food and property. You must arrange relief. Corpses must be promptly collected and buried. Second: take our cadres and immediately assume control of the prefectural and county offices. Seal the storehouses and archives. The clerks and runners of the old offices must report for duty at once—no staying home. Third: more troops will arrive shortly. Joint Logistics transport can't keep up yet, so you'll coordinate with my logistics officer on provisions—he'll give you specific types and quantities. Expenses will be settled by our requisition vouchers, to be cleared with Joint Logistics later. How are grain reserves here?"

"Adequate—there are several government granaries locally."

"Good. These three matters. Go handle them. Security will be my concern. When the National Army arrives tomorrow, local security and defense will be their responsibility."

"Understood, sir." Lan Rutian had memorized each task. At Zhu Mingxia's dismissal, he bowed again and withdrew.

"As for the rest of you," Zhu Mingxia surveyed the dozen-odd Guard officers of varying heights and builds—most disheveled and bedraggled—"I can see that Zhaoqing's liberation caused you quite some suffering."

An awkward silence, then an older man stepped forward: "Reporting, sir: this is all because we failed to lead our troops properly..."

Zhu Mingxia nodded but didn't elaborate: "Now that you've surrendered to our Council, as long as you serve the Council well, bright futures await you."

"Thank you, sir!" they chorused.

"I understand that Guard-origin officers are often related to each other?"

This puzzled them somewhat, though it was true. Guards stationed long in one place often intermarried within the garrison. Over time, most had some family connection. Hereditary officers were even more so.

"Sir, that's correct. Most garrison households are related in some way."

"So you likely have acquaintances and relatives throughout Zhaoqing Guard's various settlements and camps?"

"Yes." The quicker ones already guessed what Zhu Mingxia was getting at.

"In that case, I must trouble you." Zhu Mingxia signaled an orderly to bring out a tray piled with letters.

"You'll depart immediately. Each of you take a few servants and proceed to the various settlements and camps to persuade their Ming officers and soldiers to surrender."
