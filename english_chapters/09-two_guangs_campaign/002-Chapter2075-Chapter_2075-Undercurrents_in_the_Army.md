# Chapter 2075 - Undercurrents in the Army

These "young officers" had risen through the ranks as the army expanded and their seniority accumulated. Some now held important positions in army headquarters or branch commands; others had become battalion-level commanders. This was a force that the Executive Committee and military leadership could no longer ignore.

Personnel matters were one thing; on the political front, the Executive Committee had from the very beginning actively worked to strengthen "civilian" influence over the military as a whole. A certain high official who had successively held key Executive Committee posts was, strictly speaking, a co-founder of the Fubo Army—he had pioneered the "tractor training method" back in the early days. The victory telegram from Chengmai had borne three names as co-signatories, fully reflecting the Executive Committee's considerations regarding military personnel. Speaking frankly, the serious lag in Army staff work was partly due to the fact that the person handling routine operations for the entire General Staff—the army's "number one staff officer"—didn't even hold a military commission. Moreover, this supreme strategist's credentials were not entirely above comment.

Thus, during the formation of the Huanan Army, though the General Army's Chief of Staff position could be concurrently held by the Army Commander—after all, during campaign planning, the General Army was merely a coordinating mechanism, and communications conditions wouldn't permit fine-grained interference with tactical command on three fronts—if the three brigades still lacked proper staff departments, even routine work would suffer. Very well then: for the great, glorious, and correct Council of Elders, which demanded twentieth-century replicas in all domains, building an army without a staff system was simply an intolerable regression.

Establishing staff departments—at minimum equipping the brigade-level staff offices—couldn't be done with naturalized officers whose education barely reached primary school. The General Staff held an all-night "conjuring something from nothing" meeting and ultimately resorted to the "rob Peter to pay Paul" method: Elder military officers from various specialized branch commands were reassigned to fill the brigade headquarters. A quick staff training course was held—"three parts alike is pretty good"—and the staff organizations were, in fashion or another, cobbled together.

The Artillery was to be deployed at company level to each brigade in this campaign; battalion-level headquarters were deemed unnecessary. Thus, all Elder officers from Artillery Command down to the battalion level were transformed en masse into staff officers at various echelons.

Naturally, First Brigade's Zhu Mingxia was both militarily and politically superb, enjoying full confidence; therefore, the First Brigade Chief of Staff was also held concurrently by the brigade commander. The Second Brigade's Commander You was a brigade leader purely because of his ruthlessness—his military education was zero—so the professionally artillery-trained Ying Yu was appointed Chief of Staff to support him. The Third Brigade's Fu Sansi had both commanded troops and served in headquarters; no one in the army matched his comprehensive credentials. So Zhang Bailin, who had been serving as commandant of the Army Artillery Training Regiment, was assigned to continue his "studies."

"I have no opinions," Zhang Bailin said. "A soldier's duty is to obey orders..."

"All right, enough with the empty rhetoric." Xi Yazhou gave a slight smirk. "Being reassigned from a branch command to a staff position with no real authority—you can't possibly have *no* opinions?"

Zhang Bailin was young after all, and a few needling remarks from Xi Yazhou made his face flush red. He blurted out: "If you want my honest opinion on the transfer—I really don't have any. I understand the East Gate's difficulties: there are only so many Elder officers, and they have to be shuffled around. What I *do* object to is the Executive Committee—the State Council..." At this point he grew confused; in the past one could simply curse "the damned Executive Committee," but after the Third Plenary Session and the major governmental restructuring, he wasn't sure which entity to curse anymore. "...anyway, they treat us Army men like pack mules!"

Xi Yazhou said nothing, only handed him a cigarette.

Zhang Bailin lit the cigar, took a hard drag, and proceeded to grumble about all the grievances that had accumulated over the years.

His complaints could be said to represent those of the "young officers" throughout the Army. As for the old-school officers—even if they had complaints, they wouldn't voice them publicly, much less gather together to air them. They preferred to seek out senior Elders with whom they had connections and "blow the wind" in private.

The "young officers" had no such scruples. At virtually every internal gathering, they vented about the "Executive Committee"—and although that body no longer existed, it remained the "dragon" in their minds.

Ever since the Second Anti-Encirclement Campaign's victory, when the Fubo Army had pursued the enemy to the very gates of Guangzhou and launched the Pearl River Triangle operations, through the subsequent Operation Engine and its various subordinate actions—the Shandong Expedition, the Jeju Island Campaign, Operation Hegemon—they all shared a common characteristic: the Army had actively participated, yet always played a subordinate role. The Pearl River Delta battles were largely won by the Navy. The small units penetrating deep into the interior included Army personnel, but their backbone was the Marine Corps. The Shandong Expedition and Jeju Campaign, from a management perspective, were textbook cases of civilian control over the military. Lu Wenyuan and Feng Zongze had both been dispatched by the Executive Committee to serve as front-line commanders. The difference was that Feng Zongze answered more to the Civil Affairs Commission, while Lu Wenyuan also reported to the External Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Colonial Trade. Operation Hegemon was purely military, with Admiral Ming Qiu in overall command of operations.

So what did that mean for the Army? Either, like Zhu Mingxia and Nangong Wudi, you assisted the civilians in doing the dirty, exhausting work. Or, under the banner of "amphibious operations," you were ordered about by the Navy, serving only as rear-guard, reception committees, and battlefield cleanup crews. Most intolerable of all was the Marine Corps—created with the connivance of the Council's bigwigs—equipped with better weapons than the Army, doing the Army's work, yet somehow still Navy!

Think it through: the appearance of the Marine Corps was no coincidence. It manifested a military-building theory that had been tacitly accepted within the Executive Committee all along. This theory held: given the enormous threat that armies pose to political regimes, the army should be weakened as much as possible. Creating the Marine Corps was a direct embodiment of this theory—functionally dividing the Army's organization, diluting Army strength. Likewise, though the Navy was small, they conjured up a Coast Guard to carve away coastal patrol authority. Then, under the pretexts of "streamlining" and "efficiency," they split off all logistics units into a separate Joint Logistics Command answerable to neither Army nor Navy—layer upon layer, all designed to divide and rule.

Zhang Bailin grew more agitated as he spoke, gesturing with his cigarette:

"...Is the Marine Corps some unique exception? Then what is the National Army? What is the Security Force? What is the White Horse Troop? What are those militiamen Deer Manor Master organized? Whenever it's a direct combat mission for the Army, the higher-ups always connive with local Elders to conjure up some messy substitute.

"They'd rather trust a bunch of foreign mercenaries—Japanese, Koreans—than give the Army half a squad of equipment or even cold-weapon units.

"While the Army roughed it outdoors pacifying Hainan, in the end the National Army came to pick the fruits. Meanwhile, Special Reconnaissance was sent in to steal the glory of anti-bandit tactical guidance, leaving the Army to shoulder the blame for a 'command failure resulting in total annihilation.' If the Army had been in charge from the start instead of some county magistrate sent by the Civil Affairs Commission running his mouth, would there have been a total wipeout?

"We Army men have to beg for every extra pair of chopsticks, but a liaison officer dispatched by the External Affairs Bureau can openly use Council of Elders money to keep a gang of who-knows-what thugs! And how did that end? Special Recon still had to go clean up the mess!

"While the Army froze and starved fighting bravely in Shandong, for the mere Laizhou operation they had to send an abacus-pusher to sit over the Army's head as front-line commander. This same abacus-pusher later put on airs, playing war-room officer for the Xiamen operation! Once he'd grabbed enough glory, he went right back to pushing his abacus!

"The ancestor of all these theories is the Special Reconnaissance Team from the army's founding! If the pie weren't so small right now, monstrosities like a 'Tax Police Corps' would already be hatching!

"If the Council of Elders continues down this path," Zhang Bailin said bitterly, "the ones who'll win this realm for the Council will be all manner of militiamen, security forces, White Horse Troops..."
