# Chapter 2336 - Going to Wuzhou (XI)

"...But the matter of Cai Lan destroying the document is different. Only three or four people know the ins and outs of this matter, and not a single person masters the full picture. You can only piece together that such a thing happened, knowing nothing of other details. Moreover, there is also the Wuzhou riot, giving him a sufficient excuse to destroy key documents. As long as he insists firmly that there was no such thing, no one can falsify it."

"No wonder, no wonder, this Old Xie's scheming is really deep." Chen Baibin said, "After all, Cai Lan destroying the external investigation letter is only what we know; maybe there are other leak incidents we don't know. The nature is more serious than him keeping a female spy! So Yi Haoran is still alive, but Cai Lan is already dead."

"It is so." Ji Xin nodded, "Senator Xie counts as cutting off the tail to survive. As long as it is not a mistake of principle, there will always be a chance for him to turn over in the future."

"Wouldn't this mean letting him go..." Chen Baibin originally thought Ji Xin would be somewhat disappointed, but his expression was extremely calm, completely without meaning of disappointment.

"Little Chen, whenever an investigation involves a case of a Senator, the truth is only one aspect..."

"More important is the Senate's interest. Right?"

Ji Xin nodded: "It is so."

"But what if the truth conflicts with the interests of naturalized citizens and indigenous people..."

"Little Chen, are the Senate's interests consistent with the interests of naturalized citizens and indigenous people?"

"This..." Chen Baibin found it somewhat difficult to answer. This question was somewhat subtle. According to the Senate's public propaganda line, the Senate and the people were one, sharing common interests. From a general direction, it wasn't wrong.

But privately, Senators knew very well. Their interests were not the same—it could only be said that the goals were common.

"Actually, they are inconsistent."

"Correct." Ji Xin said in a tone of an intimate talk, "Actually we all know, our interests are not the same as the indigenous people. Landlord masters are exploiting them, aren't we exploiting them? Of course not [exactly], just that we brought new technologies and new systems, improved productivity, so we have more surplus value to distribute to them. Letting them live like human beings, living a better life than in the past—this is the greatest legitimacy of our existence in this spacetime.

"But you must have also seen, there are plenty of people in the Senate who view naturalized citizens and indigenous people as 'tools', 'cannon fodder', or even 'a number on the human resources table', and this kind of thinking has also been approved by many people. As Senators and rulers, perhaps thinking this way is beyond reproach. After all, human joys and sorrows are not the same, and buttocks cannot sit on the same bench. However, contempt for naturalized citizens and indigenous people will form a new class prejudice—this prejudice has now emerged—once it takes shape, it will cause endless harm to our future society..."

He sighed deeply: "I never believed the Senate would establish any Millennium Empire. But, as a member of the Senate, I hope it can live a bit longer, and on the day of reaching a dead end, it can still transition to a new country in a peaceful or less bloody way—instead of turning into a violent revolution because of our arrogance and prejudice..."

"Director Ji, what you said is inevitably too... too..." Chen Baibin was somewhat nervous. Although Senators had full "freedom of speech", no one had ever said similar words. Whenever discussing the future of the Senate nation, although there were disputes on many issues, almost all Senators had completely positive imaginations.

"Too sensational?" Ji Xin smiled, and shook his head again, "Not at all. Do you still remember the matter of Hao Yuan back then? Strange! Yi Haoran's alias was also surnamed Hao! Hahaha."

This laughter made Chen Baibin's scalp numb. This was indeed an inexplicable coincidence. He remembered when the report on Hao Yuan and Black (Heir) was submitted to the Senate for internal discussion, the fear revealed by Senators—that was unspoken fear from the bottom of the heart... The Political Security Bureau, Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Special Reconnaissance Team conducted a near-crazy search and suppression of Hao Yuan's remnants in Hangzhou and other places. Almost everyone who had contact with him, as long as they could be found, was secretly arrested or assassinated.

"Wait, the work I am doing now, speaking of it, is upholding the interests of naturalized citizens and indigenous people, but in essence, it is just delaying the arrival of a certain moment..."

"I understand your meaning, protecting the rights of naturalized citizens and indigenous people is protecting the Senate itself..." He murmured, "Isn't this the same meaning as protecting the Earth is protecting humanity?"

Ji Xin nodded: "Does the Earth need human protection? Simply doesn't need it. Whether the Earth is a lifeless desert or a lush paradise of life, it has no meaning to the Earth itself, only has meaning to the existence of humanity."

"So speaking, your work is truly very meaningful..." Chen Baibin said sincerely, "I support you! After going back, I will also help you do related things more."

"I am very satisfied that you can approve of my idea. To actually do this work is not easy." Ji Xin said, "Let's not talk about these, better talk about work."

They had been in Wuzhou for more than ten days, basically finishing investigation and interrogation work. Next was forming a specific report. This was a text to report to the Senate, which must stand up to scrutiny from all sides, and at the same time implement Ji Xin's train of thought. Chen Baibin felt quite difficult.

"My idea is this," Chen Baibin said, "According to the data we currently master, the facts of the whole process of the Wuzhou riot are relatively clear. Currently, among the main personnel involved in the case, only Jiang Qiuchan, Song Ming and Chang Qingyun are missing. Others are either dead or brought to justice, almost caught in one net. So the report itself is not hard to write. What's difficult is the situation regarding Xie Erren..."

Saying that he looked at Ji Xin, wanting him to offer opinions.

Ji Xin nodded slightly, asking: "Which parts do you feel are most difficult?"

"One is the man-woman relationship between him and Cai Lan, two is the matter of Cai Lan contacting confidential documents. These two are both big bombs..."

"Our investigation report is not based on rumors, everything must be based on facts." Ji Xin said, "As long as there is evidence for things, naturally write them down."

Conversely, what had no evidence need not be written. Chen Baibin thought, *isn't this following Xie Erren's path?* Although feeling Ji Xin's plan was very appropriate, being arranged by Xie Erren just like this, he felt somewhat unwilling.

Probably seeing his thought from his expression, Ji Xin said: "Don't feel you fell into Xie Erren's routine. This lesson for Xie Erren won't be light, at least he will be silent for three or five years. It is also a warning to many current Senators. Don't feel too good about themselves, trampling on systems at will."

"I have no view on Senator Xie. Just somewhat worried. Since the relationship between Cai Lan and Xie Erren is recognized, contacting confidential secrets and leaking secrets are not hard to deduce. What if someone holds onto this problem tightly at the hearing?"

"This is Xie Erren's problem, not ours. We only speak according to facts. No one can say otherwise. As for Senator Xie, probably at the hearing he will also insist on his own set of rhetoric. Anyway, as long as there is no evidence, no one can do anything to him. Furthermore, if someone really presses him hard, those Senators advocating 'Senator Rights Supremacy' will definitely jump out to help him. In addition, Wen and Ma are his direct and indirect superiors, and won't sit by watching him be made too embarrassed—after all, they have leadership responsibility, and will also give assistance secretly. As for other dispatched administrative Senators, seeing Senator Xie be targeted (集火-focused fire), inevitably will have a feeling of the fox mourning the death of the hare (sympathy for like kind), so although his situation is dangerous, it is not fatal."

Chen Baibin rarely heard such straightforward analysis in work, because Bureau Director Xiong always spoke very implicitly, and absolutely wouldn't have any speech unsuitable for public occasions.

While the two were discussing the report writing issue, an orderly came in to report: Zheng Ergen came.

Zheng Ergen came to deliver the conclusion report on the Sanhezui camp. Ji Xin and Chen Baibin browsed it roughly. From the conclusion, basically Liu Youwang, Jiang Yougong and others colluded, engaging in massive corruption in the camp causing intensification of contradictions, eventually utilized by Chang Qingyun. It specifically mentioned many details of Liu Youwang and others bullying men and dominating women, and living corruptly in the camp. Seeing he successively raped dozens of women, and forced to death or beat to death over a hundred people, Ji Xin couldn't help showing a sorrowful look, sighing: "It is our management not in place. Harmed many innocent people."

"If not for this, how could Chang Qingyun, a mere scholar, possibly stir up such a big storm!" Chen Baibin said.

"Did he say who the third seal belongs to?"

"No, didn't say anything. Used means (torture) and still didn't say."

"Really strange." Chen Baibin murmured, "Who is worth him protecting like this? He doesn't look like a loyal person."

"Maybe there is some leverage or family member in the other party's hands." Ji Xin said, "Have you checked his surrounding social relations?"

"Liu Youwang is an orphan, a penniless poor kid in Lingao. He muddled in the agricultural sector for many years without success, served in the Fubo Army without promotion, so haven't established a family all along." Zheng Ergen said.

"You go first." Chen Baibin said.

"How do you feel about this report?" Ji Xin asked after Zheng Ergen left.

"Except for this third seal having no whereabouts, others are all reasonable." Chen Baibin said, "Actually there are also many testimonies disadvantageous to Xie Erren inside, such as the opera chests Liu Youwang wanted, and his almost zero control and supervision over the entire Sanhezui prisoner camp, completely letting it drift."

"So I say, if someone wants to stink him up, these materials are enough." Ji Xin said, "Should be able to satisfy them."
