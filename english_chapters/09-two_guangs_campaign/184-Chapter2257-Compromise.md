# Chapter 2257: Compromise

For the gentry and large households, the most important thing was naturally land; with land, there was wealth and status. However, no matter how much land there was, if there were not enough tenant farmers and long-term laborers to cultivate it, it could not be transformed into wealth and power. And manpower was not only the source of wealth but also the guarantee of safety: especially in counties like Yangshan where Han and Yao lived together and public security was chaotic. The weak serving as meat for the strong was the norm. Neither individuals nor large households could count on the protection of the legal regime; they had to rely on armed force to guarantee their own interests.

In this way, manpower became the foundation for the various large households to settle down and get on with their lives. The Ouyang family was naturally no exception. For Ouyang Xi, collecting grain and taxes could still be perfunctorily dealt with, but these able-bodied men were his family's lifeblood. It was no wonder he hurriedly declined as soon as he heard the words "borrow troops."

However, this was not the main reason for his refusal. In fact, Ouyang Xi still harbored doubts about whether this "Great Song" that had popped up could gain a foothold in Yangshan.

Whether suppressing bandits or pacifying the Yao, Ouyang Xi’s opinion was no different from the county's. But as the leader of the gentry and large households in this county, he knew his role as a benchmark deeply. As long as he agreed to "borrow troops," other large households would naturally see it as his submission to the "Great Song," and many would follow the wind and fall toward the Australians. In case the Great Ming recovered the lost territory in the future—it concerned his reputation and the family's future, and he could not make up his mind easily!

However, to refuse outright, he indeed found it somewhat difficult to say, because his family had always had the reputation of being "public-spirited and justice-loving" in Yangshan—given the current situation in Yangshan County, if his family did not stand out, it indeed couldn't be justified.

"Sir also knows the current situation in Yangshan. Although Sun Dabiao has been destroyed, there is still Feng Haijiao and others. The bandit trouble is not pacified, and everyone in the county is in danger. Moreover, although the Eight Rows Yao rebellion has been quelled, it remains a hidden danger—Sir is the leading household of Yangshan. How can you sit and watch such a major matter concerning our native place without asking?"

"It is not that this student sits and watches without asking, but truly the able-bodied men on this student's estate are all dull commoners. Holding spears to protect the village, they still have some blood courage, but if required to go out to battle, I fear it would be a waste of provisions..." Ouyang Xi continued to decline.

"This student also served as magistrate in Yangshan for a few years. Back then, Old Brother Ouyang Da led the village braves to engage the bandits several times, personally facing arrows and stones. He is truly a defending general of our Yangshan. The village braves under his command even more so disregarded life and death, charging into enemy lines. How are they dull commoners?" Peng Shou’an did not allow him to dodge, poking through his evasive words to his face.

Ouyang Xi showed an embarrassed look—he forgot the other party was the county magistrate not long ago.

Peng Shou’an said solemnly, "Old Mister! This student was a wandering official with a three-year term for the Great Ming; for the Senate, I am merely an outside 'consultant.' The stability of Yangshan and the welfare of the commoners, strictly speaking, what do they have to do with me? Coming here to borrow troops is for the peace of the common people of Yangshan! I hope Mister thinks thrice!"

This faintly carried the meaning of blaming Ouyang Xi for only caring about his small family and not the greater good. It made him somewhat embarrassed and indeed made the old man waver a bit.

The Ouyang family's "public-spiritedness" toward Yangshan was not hypocritical, otherwise, he would not have presided over the renovation of the Reading Terrace, nor would he have organized village braves to fight for the county repeatedly. In history, during the Ming-Qing transition in Yangshan County, bandit harassments and Yao uprisings rose one after another. The Ouyang family dispatched village braves to participate in battles every time. Ouyang Xi’s son, Ouyang Da, died in battle during a defense against bandits attacking the city in the early Qing.

Ouyang Xi pondered for a moment and whispered, "It is not that I am unwilling to borrow troops, but truly this matter is of great consequence. Master Peng! You and I have been acquainted for many years and trust each other. Even though you are an official for the Australians now, I won't treat you as an outsider: I heard that Feng Haijiao and others have received titles from the Great Ming court. If I openly become enemies with them, isn't that attacking government troops?"

Seeing him speak his true thoughts, Peng Shou’an knew the matter was easy to handle, so he said, "Who Sun Dabiao and Feng Haijiao are, presumably Old Mister knows better than anyone. That such characters can also become officials is truly earthen pots making thunderous noise!" Seeing Ouyang Xi still hesitating, he whispered again, "This time, the Magistrate wants me to borrow troops, not dispatch troops."

Ouyang Xi was shaken and said, "What does this mean?"

"Magistrate Bi said, you, Old Sir, are the number one gentry of Yangshan, and the Young Master is a *Juren*. Presumably, cooperating with the county there will be many taboos, and unavoidable evasions—she does not blame you for this."

"Many thanks to Magistrate Bi for her understanding!" Ouyang Xi said hurriedly.

"No need to be polite." Peng Shou’an continued, "Now Magistrate Bi says, we don't want you to dispatch troops in an organized formation under the name of the Ouyang family village braves. We only want your family to provide fifty able-bodied men—weapons and provisions will all be prepared by the county, and we don't want people from the Ouyang family to command them—would this clearing of relations be acceptable?"

This was speaking plainly. Ouyang Xi felt that declining again would inevitably mean refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit.

He glanced at Peng Shou’an, feeling some doubt in his heart. He basically didn't believe a woman could come up with such an idea; it was probably Peng Shou’an’s idea. However, Peng had achieved nothing in his administration of Yangshan, and suffered a great defeat when assisting the Australian Magistrate Wang. Conversely, after this female *Kun* magistrate came, she only made one move, yet instantly enlivened the whole board. Ouyang Xi couldn't help but generate a certain suspicion: Could it be there was some expert secretly guiding the county?

However, this method was indeed appropriate. Although his family provided able-bodied men, they were not commanded by the Ouyang family after all. If the Great Ming government returned, there was room for evasion. If they didn't return, his family would count as having performed a merit for the Senate.

"Please allow me to discuss this matter with my son." Ouyang Xi said, "I will give Sir a reply tomorrow."

"What? He agreed?" Bi Da asked.

"Though not exactly the bullseye, it is not far off." Peng Shou’an was quite self-satisfied.

Bi Da frowned. You Ciren said, "Old Peng, don't show off your literary phrases, speak human language!"

"Yes, yes," Peng Shou’an was in a very good mood and didn't mind. "Master Ouyang said he wanted to discuss it with his son again and reply tomorrow—this is just for the sake of caution. The matter is already settled."

"So, he counts as having agreed?" Bi Da said.

"Exactly," Peng Shou’an nodded. "Speaking of which, it was still your idea, Magistrate, that was good..."

In their original plan, they wanted various large households to dispatch village braves in organized units to assist in the fighting. Firstly to save money, and secondly, the combat power of village braves was largely built on the foundation of "mutual knowledge between superiors and subordinates."

But Peng Shou’an visited several large households, and although every family was very polite and said everything was fine regarding the "Reasonable Burden," when it involved borrowing village braves, they all hummed and hawed. After hitting a wall, Bi Da asked Peng Shou’an to change course: want only able-bodied men, not the name.

"What these old moneybags fear is nothing more than that we are not 'orthodox,' fearing that one day the Ming government troops will fight back, and others will use this to make an issue saying they 'attached to rebels.' Since it is so, let's set their hearts at ease..."

"In this case, won't we be weaker in momentum..." You Ciren had some doubts.

"The Great Ming has ruled Yangshan for nearly three hundred years, and the concept of orthodoxy is deeply rooted in people's hearts. We are newcomers. The large households haven't seen us defeat the Ming army with their own eyes, so it is normal for them to be untrusting and suspicious." Bi Da said, "If we want them to stick their necks out and show their banners to help us now, they naturally won't be willing."

Thus the plan was adjusted to the current one: ask each family to provide able-bodied men, without needing them to pull out teams in organized units.

"...Actually, this is also good. The village braves they pull out in organized units are commanded by their own people. Their combat power might not be bad, but we can't stick our hands in either." You Ciren said, "After they eat rations here with us and get educated for a year or half, they will be our people. Even for a top gentry like Ouyang Xi, once he gives those fifty able-bodied men to us, they won't be his family's in the future."

So this "conscription of village braves" became "conscription of men." For the large households, this nominal change made them heave a sigh of relief. Especially since the Ouyang Xi family agreed to the "conscription" first, it set an example. Soon, Peng Shou’an conscripted four hundred able-bodied men from the dozen or so gentry and clan large households listed beforehand as having "relatively good reputations." And the collection rate of the Reasonable Burden also rose all the way, quickly reaching over sixty-five percent. The Great Song Yangshan County Government, which was originally short of soldiers and grain and dying, actually miraculously revived.

With men and grain in hand, Bi Da immediately reorganized the troops. She weeded out some of the old and weak from the conscripted men, selected over two hundred sixty people, mixed them with the one hundred Yao men from Yonghua and the original National Army, and finally formed five companies. Each company had a rifle squad, and the rest of the soldiers all used spears and large sabers. She also dug out all the armor in stock from the county armory, selected more than ten usable suits of iron armor, and issued cotton and cotton cloth from the warehouse, distributing them to women to beat solid and wad into cotton armor. She formed a fully armored squad for each company.

You Ciren also organized the weeded-out old and weak into a reserve company, used for guarding the county seat.

Most of the able-bodied men conscripted from the large households and powerful families had served as village braves for many years. Although they hadn't received much formal training, they had some experience in going into battle and killing. Their combat power was quite strong. After reorganizing and equipping, the military might flourished for a time.

Bi Da formally appointed Luo Yiming as the Mayor of Dalang Market and arranged for two full companies to be stationed there. Their task was mainly to defend Dalang Market and monitor the Yonghua Yao area. Once any situation occurred in the Yonghua Yao area or adjacent areas, Luo Yiming would have a mobile force he could dispose of at any time without waiting for the county seat to allocate troops to him. It was equivalent to having an additional attack position.

The other companies took turns escorting Peng Shou’an out to "visit guests" and collect the Reasonable Burden village by village; companies without "guest visiting" duties either guarded the county seat or patrolled along various roads in the county to wipe out scattered bandits.

You Ciren coordinated from the center, coordinating the patrol and clearing work of various companies, ensuring that there were National Army companies patrolling the roads every day, focusing on ensuring the safety of transportation nodes and important market towns in the county. Because military strength was now abundant, apart from the reserve company, he always had 1-2 companies on standby in the county seat, ready to set out at any time.
