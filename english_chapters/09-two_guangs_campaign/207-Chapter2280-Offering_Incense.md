# Chapter 2280: Offering Incense

Yi Haoran’s guess was indeed not wrong; shortly after Cai Lan moved to the Three Headquarters, she was "accepted for use" by Xie Erren. A little woman like her with no one to turn to, far away in a strange land amidst military chaos, facing Xie Erren’s tenderness, she actually had little room for choice. Besides death, she could only accept with half refusal and half submission. Although Xie Erren was a "Hair Thief," he was after all a "Marquis of a Hundred Li" of Wuzhou. Cai Lan had been in Wuzhou for a long time; she also knew more or less that Australians were not ordinary mud-legged rebels, but overseas giant bandits "invading"; could more or less count as a hero of a region. The servant women around her said: Master Xie was a "Senator" of Great Song, status incomparably noble, simply not comparable to her own fiance, a poor scholar.

Since she became "Senator Xie’s woman," people around her treated her with added courtesy; not to mention food and drink were honored and exalted, there were also slave maids serving her side—said to be all from Wuzhou local big households, accustomed to serving people, most understanding of human intentions. Truly so-called once lips slightly dry, someone served hot and cold suitable fragrant tea; once throat slightly sounded, spittoon was already presented.

When she was a girl at home, let alone someone serving, she had to cook in kitchen herself, work hard at housework, serving father and brothers; where had she lived such days of clothes coming to hand and rice coming to mouth! Let alone so meticulous and thoughtful. Saying she was not moved by it, that would be fake.

Although words were so, the two words "Loss of Body" and "Loss of Chastity" were like tight yokes, locking firmly on her heart, making it hard for her to let go; life of brocade clothes and jade food also lost color.

Whenever she sat quietly alone, she would seem to see her father’s dried thin and serious face, seeming to curse her: "Losing chastity to serve thieves, you are a daughter of a Confucian scholar, from a scholar line, how doing such shameless matter!"

Whenever thinking here, she would tremble for a while; huge mental pressure made her suffocate. Once thinking people behind her back would discuss her "frivolous," "lost chastity," "unchaste," she felt someone was ruthlessly whipping her. Since childhood father told her "Biographies of Exemplary Women," "Internal Training," "Admonitions for Women"; at this moment, those words in books she once read were like knives, constantly stirring her heart, making her unable to live in peace.

At night sometimes she would dream of her fiance—actually she wasn't familiar with this man who was originally to be her husband. They were engaged since childhood, but never met. It was only last year when famine caused civil uprising in hometown, the whole family fled to provincial capital—parents old and strength declining, living precariously; remembering back then there was such a marriage, so wrote a letter, asking Xing Chenghuan to send people to pick her up to complete marriage, so she could have reliance for life.

She traveling thousands of *li* to get to Wuzhou, actually only saw fiance three or four times. Truth to tell, she was even somewhat blurry about Xing Chenghuan’s appearance. So in dreams, the fiance she saw was always a blurry shadow. Weeping silently alone, then suddenly rushing up madly to choke her neck, roaring "Why didn't you die!"

Cai Lan often woke up screaming from nightmares, spending long nights in fear and guilt. This was also why she begged Xie Erren to find an accompanying woman; at least on days Xie Erren didn't come to stay overnight, there could be someone accompanying her to pass long nights.

Speaking of it, although Xie Erren used up "small intentions" to seduce her, after getting hands on her, Cai Lan actually couldn't feel much of this man's favor. Although under his wings she had no worry about food and clothing, could be called brocade clothes and jade food. However, days Xie Erren came to stay in her room were not many; in a week just coming once or twice only.

In this Hair thief residence, she was neither wife nor concubine, not even counted as a maidservant. This Senator Xie also never talked much about future arrangements with her; Cai Lan was like a lost traveler, back road cut off, front road vast. Couldn't find any direction, nor knew where to go.

This day she listened to Qiuchan’s words, feeling staying bored in Three Headquarters like this wasn't a thing either. Just painting couldn't dispel much sorrow and depression, instead making own makeup dim; better simply go out to walk and scatter heart, worshipping Dragon Mother, begging her to bless peace, escaping this sea of bitterness early.

Her hometown didn't have such a deity as Dragon Mother. But she heard people say early on that Wuzhou's Dragon Mother Temple was most efficacious. Immediately called people to report to Senator Xie, wanting to go to Gui River's Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense.

After Xie Erren pushed down Cai Lan, he greatly satisfied his conquest desire and vanity; however, he actually had not much love for Cai Lan. He didn't like this kind of traditional flavor full woman; to tell truth he didn't crave Cai Lan’s body either—according to General Office of Senate's maid selection criteria, Cai Lan could only be rated C grade. Plus since West Route Army advanced towards Guangxi, Wuzhou as transportation hub, work was heavier day by day. Not only to undertake Wuzhou's recovery and administrative governance, but also to do well a series of material preparations for Guangxi advance.

Although because of this preparation work, materials and manpower Planning Court injected into Wuzhou increased drastically, pressure was even greater than past. Xie Erren just reviewing reports and having meetings every day had to be busy until nine or ten o'clock; where still had interest to specially go to woman's place to stay overnight. Sometimes dealing with matters in Three Headquarters meeting, then stayed overnight in Cai Lan’s yard.

He felt he treated Cai Lan very well, at least materially very well. As for spiritual communication, to tell truth Xie Erren never thought about it. Anyway in future Xie family's maids would have a position for her.

Now hearing Cai Lan wanted to go offer incense, Xie Erren didn't hesitate, approved immediately. Just instructed Guard Captain to send a few people to follow for protection—there was outside city after all.

Qiuchan herself didn't expect matter to be so smooth; immediately taking chance of returning home, secretly informed Yi Haoran of the date of offering incense. Yi Haoran getting news was greatly happy in heart. Immediately stepped ahead to go to Dragon Mother Temple to survey terrain first.

Women offering incense, according to custom all had men accompanying. Moreover Cai Lan was Xie Erren’s woman—although having no name no title, people below dared not neglect either; finding chance to be alone with her was very hard.

Yi Haoran pondered again and again; regardless of Cai Lan’s own will, she arriving at Dragon Mother Temple would inevitably be "Guest of Honor"; Dragon Mother Temple Abbot mostly would come out to welcome, inevitably inviting her to quiet room in backyard to "use tea" and "rest." Under general circumstances, accompanying male servants and guards wouldn't follow into the room; only person able to follow in lay with Qiuchan—himself wanting to see her, only had this time.

Himself just had to hide in quiet room waiting before they arrived. But there were several quiet rooms for entertaining honored guests in Dragon Mother Temple backyard; he had no ability of foreknowledge, impossible to know in advance. And himself wanting to enter backyard casually wasn't an easy thing either.

Using forceful methods, nothing more than letting Song Ming’s people move out, kidnapping Abbot first, forcing him to cooperate. But doing so had great risk; in case Abbot didn't comply or reported afterwards, himself would be completely exposed.

Yi Haoran thought and thought, suddenly thought of an idea. He asked Jiang Qiuchan: "Which month which day is Cai Lan going to offer incense roughly?"

"According to Australian New Calendar, it is July 6th." Qiuchan said, "Weather hot, so plan to go out from door early morning, return to Three Headquarters before noon."

"You wait for my news, perhaps need to delay a few days. Is it convenient?"

"Nothing inconvenient." Jiang Qiuchan said, "Actually she has no matters, any day is okay. Just Zhao Fengtian told us, going out needs to inform two days in advance, for him to arrange guards and followers."

Yi Haoran did homework for a few days first. While eating dinner this evening, intentionally talked about anecdotes of Dragon Mother Temple.

He wasn't a local, but as a scholar, inquiring about news was quite easy. He also specially went to the newly established not long ago "Wuzhou Library"—which was the original Wuzhou Prefecture School; Xie Erren gathered books collected from various yamens here, free for locals to come to library to read—specially looked through Prefecture Annals, County Annals, reading origins and anecdotes of Dragon Mother Temple until fluent.

These days Luo Yangming was often not at home for dinner; small households didn't have too much men women great defense either. Ding A-tao, Wen Yun and Li Wensheng and others usually ate at one table. On dinner table inevitably had some casual chat, talking about marketplace news, discussing strange hearings and anecdotes. Yi Haoran took opportunity to talk about Dragon Mother Temple anecdotes.

People in rice shop besides Wen Yun were all outsiders, knowing very little about Dragon Mother Temple. Yi Haoran's explanation attracted everyone's interest.

Yi Haoran talked greatly about spiritual signs and miracles of Dragon Mother Temple for a few days in a row, gradually provoking Ding A-tao’s thoughts.

After Wuzhou liberation, Ding A-tao felt everything not smooth instead. Business stagnated aside, Luo Yangming was not at home all day long again, like changed into another person, filling her heart with panic and unease. She both worried whether this rice shop business could continue, whole family wandering on street like before, separating in life and parting in death; also afraid husband's "busy" was an excuse—perhaps having other women outside.

However as a daughter of scholar family, she dared not ask much, nor could question. These were all matters losing decency. Getting anxious and annoyed then took anger out on Wen Yun; afterwards inevitably regretted herself lacking generosity.

Now she was instigated by Yi Haoran intentionally or unintentionally, feeling since Dragon Mother Temple was so efficacious, why not go offer incense and pray, maybe would be efficacious.

Wen Yun was originally a young girl from poor family, lively and active since childhood. Since marrying Luo Yangming as concubine, although Mistress treated her quite well, rules were set everywhere for her, control very strict, thus rarely went out too, often feeling bored. Wanting to go to Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense she was naturally willing.

Luo Yangming hearing wife and concubine wanted to go to Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense, didn't feel strange, agreed immediately.

"Just I am busy with affairs, can't accompany you. Let Shopkeeper Li take A-Chun to accompany you go."

"I am old, legs and feet have many inconveniences. Matter of offering incense I won't go." Li Wensheng waved hand smiling, "Let Mr. Yi take A-Chun to go is fine..."

Yi Haoran hurriedly said: "Since so, this matter just hand over to Student."
