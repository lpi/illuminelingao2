# Chapter 2140 - Viewing Flowers from Horseback

"I heard that since Lord Han captured Dateng Gorge, this place has been open to boats and merchants."

Although He Dongli was not entirely ignorant of Australians, it was commendable that this "Overseas Barbarian" could think of Han Yong's deeds upon hearing just one sentence—this was something that happened a hundred and fifty years ago! Even in Wuzhou locally, leaving commoners aside, even among ordinary scholars, many wouldn't know if "Han Yong" was mentioned, let alone Dateng Gorge.

"Although Lord Han pacified Dateng Gorge, he actually allowed the local Yao caves to collect taxes from merchant ships crossing the gorge. Since then, Dateng Gorge has been open to merchants."

"Is the Yao situation peaceful now?"

He Dongli shook his head slightly: "Although Lord Han pacified the Yao twice, in reality, the territory of the Two Guangs has never been truly tranquil—it just hasn't become a major climate!"

In the mountains of the Gui River and West River basins surrounding Wuzhou, there were Yao and Zhuang stockades everywhere. Although most were appointed with native officials and chieftains, in reality, most "did not submit to imperial civilization." Various uprisings rose one after another. Even capable officials like Han Yong and Wang Shouren could only govern for decades of peace; trouble would arise again after some time. The so-called Yao-Zhuang uprisings were really nothing new to an old Wuzhou local like He Dongli.

Xie Erren fell silent. Seeing the collapsed barbican outside Dezheng Gate and the mutilated battlements, parapets, and defense towers on the city wall, his heart felt heavy—*The artillery fire was too fierce back then! How long will it take to repair this!*

The height of the city wall was about eight meters or more—this height was considered quite decent. Xie Erren stuck his neck out of the parapet to look down and felt that as long as the city wall was repaired, safety would still be guaranteed.

Seeing his concern for city defense, He Dongli told him that there were a total of five hundred and sixty-nine defense towers on the city wall, plus thirty-six watchtowers for housing guarding soldiers. However, only Dezheng Gate had a barbican.

"Zhao Fengtian!"

His secretary immediately followed, holding a small notebook and pen—this was Xie Erren's favorite style, issuing "instructions" anytime and anywhere.

"Instruct the Rehabilitation Bureau upon return to prioritize manpower and resources on repairing the city wall and defense facilities!"

"Yes, Chief." Zhao Fengtian hurriedly wrote it down.

Coming down from the city wall, Xie Erren was guided by He Dongli to inspect the city. Commerce here was indeed prosperous. According to He Dongli, there were eleven *fang* markets just inside the city. East of the Prefectural Yamen gate was the Prefectural East Market, one of the two most prosperous markets. Walking along, shops stood in great numbers on the street. Although there were few pedestrians, most shops had opened their doors, and street barricades everywhere were being repaired. Xie Erren looked at the scenery along the way. Although there had been fires inside the city, the damage was not too great—it was just that these houses were too unsafe. He secretly complained in his heart: *Most residential shops are either wooden structures or bamboo fences coated with yellow mud. If there are any fire prevention measures, the best are just river mussel shells inlaid. Except for government offices, temples, and a few large shops and mansions, almost no brick and stone buildings can be seen.*

*If Xiong Wencan had really succeeded in setting the fire, wouldn't it have been a sea of fire!* Xie Erren clicked his tongue secretly.

Even without walking into the shops, simply judging from the signs and displayed goods, the commodity economy here had considerable scale. There were extremely many types of goods, and various industries gathered. As a former journalist, Xie Erren had considerable observational power regarding a place's commercial environment.

"I didn't expect the commercial market in Wuzhou to be so prosperous." Xie Erren had seen many county and prefecture cities. Honestly speaking, except for Lingao under the Senate's rule and the newly liberated Guangzhou and Foshan Town, no town in Hainan or the Two Guangs could compare with Wuzhou.

Seeing this, Xie Erren's originally somewhat dim psychology became active again—*This place has great potential! Indeed, risk comes with opportunity. As long as I can firmly hold this Wuzhou City and manage it slowly, I dare not say the future number two of Guangdong Province, but number three will always be on the list. Besides, this is also an important commercial window to Guangxi and the interior.*

He looked up into the distance and saw three rivers converging near Wuzhou City, and mountains encircling it in the distance. "Leaning on Tea Mountain, facing Gui Water, with the Great River winding in front," it was known as the "Scenic Comparison of Lingao"—this praise was indeed not boasting.

"Truly worthy of being the convergence of three rivers and the thoroughfare of two provinces!" Xie Erren praised. *This splendid and magnificent landscape is now our Senate's!* Thinking of this, a burst of excitement surged in his chest.

Wuzhou in the Ming Dynasty was already an important commercial city in the Two Guangs region economically. Since ancient times, Wuzhou had been a major inland river port in the Lingnan region with obvious locational advantages. One could go upstream along the river to Nanning, Liuzhou, and Guilin, reaching far into the Great Southwest, and go downstream to the Pearl River Delta, straight to Guangzhou and Macao. This gave Wuzhou Port the functions of both an inland river port and a coastal port. In the Qin Dynasty, the Lingqu Canal was opened, communicating the Yangtze and Pearl River systems. "North water flows south, north boats cross the ridge," beginning to establish Wuzhou Port's important status in Lingnan. In the Han Dynasty, Wuzhou Port gradually developed into a water transport hub for Guangdong and Guangxi. Starting from the Tang Dynasty, Wuzhou Port had wooden sailing ships traveling to the coast of Guangdong. Thereafter, a large number of Guangdong merchants went upstream to trade in Wuzhou. Although located in the inland mountains at the junction of the Two Guangs, it had the convenience of a coastal port. Many "foreign goods" were not rare in Wuzhou, and "Australian goods" were very common.

Xie Erren took over such a territory—honestly speaking, if Wuzhou weren't located on the "frontline," given his ability and resume, he wouldn't have been able to come to Wuzhou as mayor.

"The Master speaks truly." He Dongli glanced at this Australian; his face was written with the four characters "Establish Merit and Build a Career." It was just that although Wuzhou was good, whether one could gain a foothold depended on one's ability.

He Dongli had no particular inclination: Great Ming had treated him not thinly, and he had no enmity with the Australians. As to which had a better future, as long as one wasn't blind, anyone who had toured Qiongzhou Prefecture wouldn't find it hard to answer. But Qiongzhou Prefecture was just a small place; governing the entire Guangdong well was true ability. especially the current Wuzhou, where the internal and external environments were very complex. How capable this Senator Xie of the Australians was, was really hard to say.

"This prefecture has been the thoroughfare of the Two Guangs since ancient times, a gathering of boats and carts, an accumulation of goods, and a congregation of hundreds of crafts." He Dongli said, "Truly a good piece of land! It's just that a great battle not long ago hurt its vitality! Master, please look..." He pointed outside the city with his finger.

The banks of the Gui and West Rivers outside the city used to have market wharves. Because they were affected by the war, more than half were destroyed. Looking around, broken walls and ruins were visible everywhere. On the shoals along the bank, the wreckage of sunken ships and messy timber exposed above the water could be seen everywhere.

"On this river surface, there were originally 'water execution markets.' Besides the Dan household boats, merchant ships from north and south gathered here, and merchants built shops on bamboo and wooden rafts to sell goods. In times of peace, connected wooden rafts were moored along the river here, a magnificent sight. Small boats shuttled through during the day; at night, lights connected in patches, voices boiled, and shouting of wares was endless. Outsiders who came here thought it a marvelous sight." He Dongli spoke with infinite regret in his words.

"Where are these wooden raft merchant ships?" Xie Erren was a bit puzzled: *I didn't see anything when I came here.*

"Those that could run ran away. Those wooden rafts that couldn't run also transported their goods away. The rest were burned clean during the city defense and siege a few days ago."

"What a pity!" Xie Erren shook his head. "We must restore it as soon as possible!"

He Dongli wasn't so optimistic—Australians had always valued commerce, and he believed Master Xie's words came from the heart. However, with the turmoil of war surrounding Wuzhou right now: Governor-General Xiong's troops were close at hand, and now merchants reported that the Yao caves on the West River were unstable. It would be good enough if this Chief could keep the four borders of Wuzhou safe.

Walking along the city wall, they went all the way to the "Three General Headquarters" in the east of the city.

Looking from the city wall, the scale of these Three General Headquarters was enormous, with a total of four large courtyards occupying several dozen *mu* of land. He Dongli said that these Three General Headquarters were established by Emperor Xianzong of Ming in the Chenghua years according to Han Yong's suggestion. They were the Governor-General of Two Guangs' Office, the Commander-in-Chief's Office, and the Grand Commandant's Office.

The architectural layout centered on the Governor-General's Office. The Governor-General's Office was on an earthen mound in the northeast of the city, the highest point in the city. The Commander-in-Chief's Office was to the right of the Governor-General's Office, and the Grand Commandant's Office was to the left. The Three Offices Conference Hall was in front of the Governor-General's Office. They formed a huge administrative building complex for the Governor-General of the Two Guangs, the Commander-in-Chief, and the Eunuch Grand Commandant to live, work, and hold discussions respectively.

"Wuzhou had eunuchs?" Xie Erren knew from history lectures that the origin of the Governor-General of the Two Guangs was in Wuzhou, but he hadn't expected the Eunuch Grand Commandant to have been stationed here too.

"Indeed, they were stationed here in the past. Later, the Governor-General's Office moved to Zhaoqing, and there were no longer internal officials stationed here. However, tax eunuchs came again during the Wanli years."

Xie Erren followed He Dongli to the front of the Governor-General's Office. On both sides of the main gate, the left was the Opening Office Stele, and the right was the Nominating Stele. Memorial archways were also built in front of the gate. The south archway said: "Controlling Two Domains"; the east archway said: "Lingnan and Seas肃 (Peaceful/Solemn) and Clear"; the west archway said: "People and Goods Peaceful and Abundant." The style was impressive, but since the Governor-General of the Two Guangs moved to Zhaoqing, the Three General Headquarters had actually lost their function. Having been vacant for many years, the buildings were inevitably dilapidated. Plus, being close to the eastern city wall and close at hand to Yangming Gate, they were damaged quite seriously by artillery fire during the battle. There were traces of roofs and walls being pierced and collapsed.

There were still a few yamen runners and gatekeepers guarding here, looking listless. Seeing the "Australian Master" arrive, they hurriedly got up to welcome him.

The old clerk accompanying them instructed: "Open all the main gates, invite the Chief to inspect!"

Xie Erren stepped into the Governor-General's Yamen following the clerk. Because Xiong Wencan had been stationed here recently, the interior had been renovated and repaired somewhat, not looking as desolate as the outside. However, judging from the small trees and weeds on the roof, the time of abandonment here had been quite long.

The couplet in front of the main hall of the Governor-General's Office read: "Opening Office in Wuzhou, Controlling Hundred Yues," contrasting with the mess left by people in the Governor-General's Office fleeing in panic and rogue soldiers looting during the city breach a few days ago, which carried a rather ironic flavor.
