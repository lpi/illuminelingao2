# Chapter 2333 - Going to Wuzhou (VIII)

Hearing that the City Government wanted to invite him, He Dongli was not panicked. He immediately followed the police to the San Zong Fu.

Unexpectedly, he didn't see the familiar Xie Erren, but two strange Australians. He couldn't help being slightly startled.

He Dongli immediately associated that the arrival of these two strange Australians was nine out of ten related to the Wuzhou riot not long ago. Xie Erren wasn't present; perhaps his position in Wuzhou was already unstable.

He felt nervous unconsciously. Such matters easily led to major imprisonments and fabricated charges, often involving a wide range of people. Not a few innocent people lost their families and lives for this. He must respond carefully.

However, judging by the appearance, it didn't look like an interrogation—at least they didn't put on the posture of an interrogation. Like Xie Erren summoning him, they offered a seat and tea.

"Your Honor is Mr. He Shouren?"

"This student is exactly." He Dongli bowed respectfully with hands cupped.

"We came from Guangzhou. Hearing that Mr. is an old local of Wuzhou, familiar with every aspect of local customs and sentiments, we want to talk with Mr."

"This student has lived in Wuzhou for generations. Indeed know quite a few anecdotes. Two gentlemen just ask."

"Heard there is a Dragon Mother Temple (Longmu Temple) by the Gui River here."

"Precisely. This temple is outside Dayun Gate. It is said to have been built in the Xianping era of the Great Song. It is also the largest Dragon Mother Temple locally, extremely efficacious."

"I heard when Senator Xie came to Wuzhou to take office, guided by you, he visited famous scenic spots inside and outside the city. He also went to this place."

"There was indeed such a thing." He Dongli's heart tightened. *Could it be for that matter?* He answered carefully, "That day we went to Han Gong Shrine first, then to Four Worthies Shrine. Finally went to the Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense."

"What happened when offering incense at the Dragon Mother Temple?"

"A woman assassinated Senator Xie in the street at the temple gate. However, it was threatening but not dangerous. Senator Xie had heaven's help and wasn't hurt..." He Dongli's heart sank. *Sure enough, it's for this matter!*

Although this matter didn't result in any consequences, he saw Senator Xie's embarrassed appearance at that time in his eyes—it could be counted as hanging by a thread. What worried him most was that going to the Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense was his suggestion.

Fortunately, the Australian in front didn't pursue "how they went to the Dragon Mother Temple", but asked another question.

"Who is this assassin woman?"

"This, the student isn't clear either. She failed to assassinate and was captured on the spot. A young woman, wearing a white flower on her head—should be a widow."

"How was she disposed of after being captured?"

He Dongli felt great difficulty. Although he didn't participate in Cai Lan's subsequent matters, once he came to the San Zong Fu to chat with Xie Erren and truly saw Cai Lan in this courtyard. Moreover, matters concerning Xie Erren and Cai Lan were not secrets among retained personnel and naturalized cadres in Wuzhou. But he only "heard rumors" of this matter.

"Was taken to the yamen. How she was handled later, the student doesn't know."

"Is this female assassin called Cai Lan?"

"Yes..." He Dongli trembled, saying involuntarily.

Ji Xin noticed his fearful expression, so he said gently: "Mr. need not be nervous. This matter has nothing to do with Mr."

"Yes, yes, student understands."

"However, Mr. must also understand. Some days ago, certain remnants of the usurping Ming attacked Wuzhou and caused a big mess. The Senate has to investigate this matter, and investigate to the end. Who is guilty and who is innocent must be clarified clearly. Hope Mr. cooperates well with our work, do not conceal deliberately. Mr. can also rest assured, my Senate never implicates the innocent, nor fabricates charges."

"Should be, should be." He Dongli secretly complained, "Student surely will speak all I know."

"From where did you hear this woman was named Cai Lan?"

"The student originally didn't know either, later heard people say."

"Heard from whom?"

"Many people in Wuzhou city know about this." He Dongli smiled bitterly.

"Regarding Cai Lan, what other rumors have you heard?"

He Dongli hesitated a bit, said: "Student indeed heard quite a few rumors—but just rumors. As for exactly who said them, student isn't clear either..."

"Just say."

He said after Cai Lan was captured, she had been detained in the Earth God Temple of the county yamen without disposal. After a long time, news came out, saying Senator Xie "received and used" (kept/took as mistress) her.

"As for whether this is true, student has no solid evidence. Just that she stayed in the San Zong Fu, which was seen by many people. Not false."

"So, many people in Wuzhou know about Cai Lan's matter."

"Such rumors spread faster among the market folks than national affairs." He Dongli smiled bitterly.

"Senator Xie should have heard too. Did he make any countermeasures or say anything?"

"Senator Xie seemed not to care about this."

Ji Xin nodded silently. This matched the situation he collected. Obviously, Xie Erren didn't feel there was anything inappropriate about receiving and using a female assassin. If not for the Wuzhou riot, even if the Senate inquired, it would be nothing more than a small romantic crime.

"Do you know any other strange things about Senator Xie?"

He Dongli was somewhat panicked now. These words gradually had a life-claiming momentum. He stammered: "No more... no more..."

"Think carefully." Ji Xin said seriously, "Don't have scruples! Speaking the truth can ensure your whole family's safety!"

Chen Baibin was secretly surprised. Ji Xin always looked kind and pleasant when interrogating naturalized citizens or indigenous people, sometimes analyzing pros and cons, rarely openly using the other party's family safety to threaten them to speak like this. What was going on?

He Dongli trembled, lowered his head and thought for half a day before saying: "Student didn't have much contact with Senator Xie. When meeting, we talked about local customs, astronomy, geography and products, nothing special. If saying something strange, there is one thing..."

He said shortly before the Wuzhou riot, Xie Erren sent someone to send a few paintings, asking if he was good at painting and could understand the meaning of the paintings.

"What paintings?"

"All freehand brushwork (Xieyi) flowers and birds, mainly various orchids..." He Dongli said, "To be honest, student can make do with scribbling a few strokes of freehand landscape, but really can't do flowers and birds. So I declined."

Chen Baibin and Ji Xin looked at each other. It seemed their speculation was correct. Before finding Chang Qingyun as a "ghostwriter", Xie Erren also looked for this more reliable He Dongli. Pity he didn't understand these...

*Truly time and fate.* Ji Xin sighed secretly.

He restored the original kind face again, asking: "Mr. Dongli, you are a local native, living here for generations. connections and information must be wider than us. I want to ask, how is the reputation of Senator Xie among Wuzhou folks?"

He Dongli didn't hesitate this time, said: "Reputation is fair. Although Wuzhou grain prices rose high these days, and livelihood is difficult, whether shopkeepers or commoners, days happen to be hard. But in the turmoil of war, can't blame him. He accommodated refugees in this city, relieved the poor. Under such a dangerous situation, Wuzhou city had neither starved corpses nor outflow of people. Damaged city walls and floating bridges were also repaired. Can be called a capable official."

Subsequently Ji Xin asked some other questions. He Dongli answered one by one. Only then let him go back.

"After going back, Mr. don't mention this conversation to anyone."

Seeing the Australians didn't ask him to sign and fingerprint the confession, He Dongli felt much more settled, hurriedly saying: "Yes, student understands."

"Looking at it this way, Xie Erren still has some talent." Chen Baibin said.

"Indeed has. But he was too careless." Ji Xin said, "Next, we will meet Luo Yangming."

Chen Baibin knew Luo Yangming was regarded as the "King Bomb" figure by Ji Xin. Not summoning him when just arrived, but summoning him suddenly now, meant the whole Wuzhou investigation had entered the conclusion stage.

Luo Yangming was summoned into the residence of San Zong Fu at night.

"Comrade Luo Yangming, please sit." Chen Baibin was very polite to this lower-level subordinate, "I am Chen Baibin of the Political Security Bureau..."

"Yes, Chief!" Luo Yangming said and was about to stand up to salute.

"Don't be like this," Chen Baibin waved his hand, "You are a hidden cadre now, shouldn't make such noise. We just talk quietly. Treat it as you reporting work."

"Yes!"

Chen Baibin introduced Ji Xin's identity again: "This is Comrade Ji Xin, the leader of the investigation team."

"Hello, Chief!"

"No need to be so polite." Ji Xin said casually, "You talk about work with Little Chen first. I'll listen by the side first. Ask you again if there are questions."

Chen Baibin said: "Talk about yourself first."

Luo Yangming knew this was the first inspection of him by the Political Security Bureau after his relationship transfer. So he gathered up 120% spirit, reporting his background, experience, timing of defecting to the Senate etc. one by one. Then he reported the process of accepting the assignment of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau to come to Wuzhou for intelligence work until Wuzhou's recovery. It took about more than an hour to finish reporting.

These contents were basically the same as Luo Yangming's personal file records they accessed before departure. Chen Baibin asked about his work situation for the Political Security Bureau after Wuzhou's recovery.

Luo Yangming knew the stakes were high here, dared not neglect, and briefly said the relevant work he did after Wuzhou's recovery and major events and public sentiments occurred in Wuzhou.

"Now our investigation learned that among several important figures in the Wuzhou riot, Yi Haoran, Chang Qingyun, Cai Lan, and Jiang Qiuchan are relatively key. How much do you know about these four people?"

Luo Yangming said: "Report Chief, I don't know Chang Qingyun, nor had contact. Hard to say. Yi Haoran worked as an accountant in my shop. My personal impression is this person is upright, open-minded and generous in getting along with people, simple and hardworking in life, never had bad habits. Can be called a modest gentleman. Doing things very meticulously."

"Didn't you find he had suspicious points?"

"Discovered." Saying that, he told once the story of how he suspected Yi Haoran initially, how he reported to Xie Erren, and Xie Erren proposed sending an external investigation letter to investigate.
