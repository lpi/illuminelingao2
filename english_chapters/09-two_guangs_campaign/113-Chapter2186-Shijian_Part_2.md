# Chapter 2186 - Shijian (Part 2)

"Oh?" Wu Baliu nodded. "The enemy seems to have gathered quite a few people. Your unit has many new recruits; can they handle it?"

"They need to undergo more tempering by war. If they always follow behind the Fubo Army, how can they take charge alone without fighting a few tough battles?" Li Dong was confident. "Veterans are still the majority in our squadron, and morale is high."

"Good, your squadron will take the lead!" Company Commander Wu appreciated the other's courage and agreed on the spot.

Li Dong took some men to the front to observe. The place where the village braves set up the barricade was exactly at the narrowest part of the road. It wasn't exactly perilous, but the terrain was indeed favorable. One side of the road was mudflats, which were not only open but also difficult for people to walk on; the other side was hilly terrain. The village braves had built towers on several main commanding heights to monitor the surrounding situation at any time.

"Everyone take a look, how should we fight this situation?" Li Dong asked.

Attending this pre-battle discussion, besides squad leaders, were the squadron's sergeants and veteran soldiers. Holding a discussion before battle to brainstorm was a feature of the Senate's officer education system.

At the meeting, everyone put forward their own suggestions. It boiled down to two methods: outflanking and frontal attack. The differences lay solely in specific execution. Some suggested cutting grass and wood to pave a road on the mudflats for the whole army to outflank and assault; others suggested setting fire to the mountain directly to drive away the village brave defenders on the hills... methods varied.

"What you're saying is all superfluous!" Yang Erdong said. "The captives said there are only two hundred village braves over at Shijian. The defensive measure is just a wooden fence. Let's not go through the trouble; just one assault and we'll take down this wooden fence to save time."

Yang Erdong had already been promoted to corporal and had changed weapons. He was full of enthusiasm.

"...The most important thing now is time. The Chiefs said we must rush to Lianzhou to suppress the Yao as quickly as possible. If we fight perfectly safe battles so slowly along the way, when will we reach Lianzhou?"

Li Dong deeply agreed with his opinion, so he decided to attack frontally.

The wooden fence on the road was only slightly taller than a person. Although there were defensive facilities like trenches and abatis, there were no insurmountable obstacles. Judging from the equipment of the militia standing behind the wooden fence, they didn't even have many bows and arrows, let alone firearms.

Immediately, more than ten simple ladders and several makeshift bridges for crossing trenches were made urgently. Wu Baliu's company also moved up, ready for "overhead fire."

The so-called "overhead fire" was rifle fire at a high angle of elevation. In the era of flintlocks and Minié rifles, this was a long-range shooting tactic commonly used by European armies. Sometimes, infantry could project bullets to places 500-600 meters away in this manner and still have considerable lethality. Of course, there was no accuracy to speak of with this "overhead fire," but in actual combat, commanded company volleys could still inflict sufficient casualties on dense enemy formations at long range.

Wu Baliu adopted "overhead fire" not to increase range, but simply to be able to shoot from behind the Wuzhou Squadron in this narrow terrain to support them.

Due to the narrow road, three squads couldn't go up together and could only enter combat successively in platoon columns. Unexpectedly, this time Li Dong didn't order the rifle squad with the strongest combat power to be the vanguard.

"Yang Erdong, you be the vanguard!" Li Dong ordered.

"Yes! Guarantee to complete the mission!" Yang Erdong trembled all over. Being the vanguard meant a high probability of death or injury, but breaking the wooden fence meant the first merit would be his too.

With the rapid beating of assault drums, the sound of rifle volleys rang out behind Yang Erdong. He didn't have time to think much; leveling his bayoneted rifle, he shouted: "Brothers, follow me!" With that, he was the first to rush out.

Yang Erdong came from the old Ming army and knew that even for positions like Vice General or Regional Commander, one had to lead house retainers to charge in front during battle; otherwise, other miscellaneous soldiers wouldn't be willing to risk their lives. His squad had many new recruits; if he didn't take the lead, he couldn't control the troops at all.

The whole squad, and then the whole squadron, started trotting behind him. This distance was only three hundred meters or so; the faster the action, the smaller the casualties. The Wuzhou Squadron managed to maintain order on this narrow road, soldiers lowering their muzzles and trotting all the way.

There were only some militia behind the wooden fence. Yang Erdong could clearly see their panicked running figures, followed by noisy shouting and the chaotic sound of bamboo clappers.

At this moment, what Li Dong had worried about happened: A flash of fire suddenly spurted from behind the wooden fence, followed by the boom of a cannon.

"It's over!" Yang Erdong's mind went blank: *On such a narrow road, taking a cannon shot to the face, if I don't die I'll at least lose a limb.*

However, when he came to his senses, his legs were still running, and his arms were fine. Four or five people in the squad following him had fallen, each a bloody mess. Screams were incessant.

The squad stopped instantly. Some had already turned around to run back. The chaotic situation directly blocked the squad behind on the road. Yang Erdong roared, wanting the squad to charge with him, but the whole squad cowered, daring not advance.

Arrows and projectiles fired from bird guns constantly flew over their heads. The entire column broke into three sections on the road and fell into chaos. Luo Mao shouted from behind for them to continue charging, but gunfire drowned out the officer's shouts. Some people started firing blindly. Ai Buyi was sandwiched in the middle, trekking all over with fear.

"Stop f*cking shooting! Follow me, charge!" Yang Erdong dragged and kicked the soldiers in the front row, finally managing to make them move forward reluctantly. Two soldiers, however, dropped their rifles, turned, jumped off the roadbed, and climbed up the hillside.

"F*ck your mother! Where are you going? Come back!" Yang Erdong roared. Seeing the fastest one had already run dozens of meters away, suddenly, gunshots rang out from the squad in the rear row. The two deserters climbing the hillside were hit successively and rolled down. The soldiers who were originally restless and about to route were instantly stunned.

"Those who don't want to die, follow me!" Yang Erdong seized this opportunity to rally the troops and charged all the way to the wooden fence. The squad quickly set up makeshift bridges, crawled over trenches, and erected ladders. Yang Erdong was the first to climb up the wall, stabbing down a panicked militia member.

The Yang Family Village braves didn't offer fierce resistance. In fact, when they broke through to the trench, the village braves scattered and fled. The entire squadron successfully breached the wooden fence. Immediately after, the 2nd Company followed and broke through.

After the wooden fence was breached, there was no suspense left for Shijian. Jiang Wenming and Xie Wendong slipped away with the remnants, leaving the ground full of trash and dozens of corpses to the Fubo Army.

Shijian was safely relieved. The National Army squad leader guarding the town and the town's "Elders" came out to welcome them. This squad leader hadn't been in office long and it was his first time undergoing such a test. At this moment, holding Li Dong's hand tightly, he couldn't say a word, almost bursting into tears.

The Sui River Detachment decided to rest overnight in Shijian. Li Dong's unit had taken the first merit, and every squad was beaming with joy. But good days in the army usually didn't last long. Before the Wuzhou Squadron's butts were warm, they received new orders: the entire squadron was to execute outer perimeter guard duty north of Shijian. The whole squadron had just finished tending to the wounded and preparing to eat, but had to pack up their mess kits, pass through the town, and go outside the village to prepare exclusively for camping.

Shijian Town was located on a small alluvial plain. The Sui River on the west side of the town turned from south to east here. The east and north sides were green mountains. The road to Guangning was sandwiched between the mountains to the north. The mountain pass was more than two *li* from the village. Fearing being too far from the main force, the 2nd Battalion's campsite was only half a *li* from the northernmost village. According to the report from the scout squad sent out, there was only a small village on the opposite mountain, and no trace of Ming troops was found. Tonight the weather was clear and windless, the temperature pleasant. Plus, with guard duty at hand, the officers used training the soldiers' spirit as a reason not to let them pitch tents.

The mishap during the attack left Yang Erdong with lingering fears. Although the squadron leader didn't say anything, he felt very uneasy inside. Although he had the first merit of "First to Ascend," he still volunteered, requesting his own squad to build the simple outer perimeter fortifications.

"We just fought a battle, casualties weren't few. Should we switch to another squad?" Li Dong asked.

"It doesn't matter. These raw recruits need to be drilled more to stop them from thinking too much."

"Alright, leave it to you then."

While the other two squads of Wuzhou Squadron were chewing on molar-grinding bricks with soup, Yang Erdong's squad could only dig pits bitterly with shovels, piling the excavated earth behind the pits to build a low wall only chest-high that looked like it couldn't block anything. They also knew that battle was won quite shamefully. There were only a dozen militia on the wall in total, and only three or five muskets. Although there was a cannon, it only fired once. The dozens of militia behind who didn't go up the wall slipped away as soon as the wall was lost. The squad itself lost four brothers, and the most shameful thing was that two were executed by "Battlefield Law Enforcement."

Shame was shame, but when working, Squad Leader Yang Erdong stood by the pit drinking soup with a bowl, calling it supervising and guiding them to build the wall. The Sui River Detachment built fortifications every night on the way north to Guangning; even fools had learned it, did they need him to teach? Originally, suppressing bandits in Zhaoqing was quite free, but as soon as they dug ditches, the soldiers couldn't help recalling painful memories of recruit training in Guangzhou. Plus, although Ming troops were approaching, they estimated that eight out of ten were garrison troops from Guangning and wouldn't be many, so the soldiers' enthusiasm for digging fortifications wasn't high.
    
"The Squadron Leader punished our whole squad, leader why don't you work together with us?" A few veterans asked complainingly, relying on their familiarity with him.

"What, not convinced?" Yang Erdong laughed. "When you change the strip on your armband to a bean (star), someone will work for you."

Soldiers and officers mixed familiarly, and bold new recruits talked back: "You officers are all from the Chiefs' regulars, how could we ever have that time."
