# Chapter 2311 - Thorny Confessions

Qian Duo nodded: "Replenishing the troops isn't a problem; the main issue is the heavy loss of weapons. The Third Squadron had been retrofitted with all rifles, and this time nearly half were damaged or lost. The new recruits will have to carry spears again!"

"I just remembered something. Those dock porters led by Luo Yangming achieved great merit this time. Why not replenish them into the Third Squadron..."

Qian Duo pondered for a moment and said, "We can't put them into the Third Squadron. The morale in the Third Squadron has been ruined by Jiang Yougong. If we add soldiers in, they'll just get corrupted. These men are good—fine fellows with combat capability. They could even join the Volte Army. Putting them into a fourth- or fifth-rate unit like that would be a waste. In my opinion, disband the Third Squadron completely, then reorganize it with the dock porters to form a new Third Squadron and a Replacement Squadron. I actually think we should disband the several hundred men of the Detective Team in the city sooner rather than later. Looking at their performance last night, they were completely useless—not to mention there were quite a few insiders mixed in..."

"We can't make the call on this," Zhao Fengtian frowned. "You and I both know this so-called Detective Team is a mixed bag. There are formidable professional soldiers, and there are old soldier ruffians just looking for a meal. Most are just there to get by. No matter which type, none are reliable. But this system was set up by Senator Xie in accordance with the spirit of the Guangdong Region. Abolishing it requires Senator Xie's word; we can't do it for him. Besides, when Senator Xie set this up, there was also the intention of 'supporting people'."

"I understand that intention. Otherwise, why would he set up so many units? It's nothing more than not wanting these people to have no livelihood and resort to desperate measures, further aggravating the banditry in the rear."

"Revoking it isn't hard; I estimate Senator Xie won't insist on it either. But we must give these people a way out. Otherwise, they will always be a hidden danger," Zhao Fengtian said.

The two looked at each other, unable to come up with a method. However, there was one good outcome right now: the massive burden of the Sanhezu Prisoner Camp on the Wuzhou local government had been wiped out. Whether the refugees and captives housed inside or the retained personnel managing the camp, these thousands of mouths were no longer their burden.

Of course, from a bad perspective, these people scattering out, many with no livelihood, would inevitably take desperate risks, worsening the security situation around Wuzhou.

Thinking of this, Zhao Fengtian's head swelled several sizes, throbbing faintly. He sighed, "We can't manage these things, nor do we have the ability to. In my opinion, the Detective Team needs to be purged. Kick out all those with problems—there are thousands of people scattered outside anyway, a few dozen more won't matter. Those with ability and clean backgrounds can be added to the Replacement Squadron. I will ask Chief Xie for instructions on this."

At this moment, the long blast of a tugboat's whistle came from outside. The two, who had been sleepless all night, stood up as if startled awake. Qian Duo said, "The grain fleet is here! I'll go to the South Gate first."

"You go receive them. I have to arrange the remaining matters." Zhao Fengtian smiled bitterly. "I need to have an explanation ready when the Chief asks later."

After Qian Duo left, he called for Zheng Ergen.

"How is the case progressing?" As soon as Zheng Ergen entered, Zhao Fengtian asked abruptly.

Zheng Ergen's collar was open, his forehead covered in sweat, looking exasperated. He plonked into a chair, panting heavily, "It's truly f*cking hard to deal with!"

"Don't panic, speak slowly." Seeing his appearance, Zhao Fengtian knew this bone was hard to gnaw.

"Those people from the Jiang family had no juice. They entered the interrogation room and confessed everything amidst tears. It turns out this Advisor Hao isn't named Hao at all; his real name is Yi Haoran. He was originally an advisor in Xiong Wencan's staff. According to Jiang Qiuchan, when the city fell, this Yi Haoran saved her and her child. So she helped him hide his identity and lie low. As for Jiang Rongxian, he basically knew nothing—he thought Yi Haoran was a relative of his sister's husband's family..."

"So, infiltrating Luo Yangming's rice shop was done through Jiang Qiuchan?"

"Exactly. Before Jiang Qiuchan married, she was a boudoir friend of Luo Yangming's wife, Ding Atao. They interacted frequently." Zheng Ergen picked up his bamboo water flask and took a big gulp. "This Old Luo isn't doing well; he has holes in his family."

"Don't drag in irrelevant things, stick to the main topic," Zhao Fengtian reminded him. Zheng Ergen realized he had misspoken and hurriedly turned back, "That's about it for Jiang Qiuchan's issues."

"Was Cai Lan the one who tampered with Yi Haoran's external transfer letter back then?"

"It was her. This matter is quite complex to explain." He recounted the cause and effect of the events. Zhao Fengtian was secretly startled as he listened; this Yi Haoran was a formidable character! He now somewhat understood that Jiang Qiuchan had been completely used by him—not only used but used in a way where she was sold and still helped count the money.

Although Zheng Ergen said the progress wasn't smooth, the confessions obtained from Cai Lan and Jiang Qiuchan had already roughly clarified the course of events. Finally, when he heard Cai Lan mention Chang Qingyun, Zhao Fengtian was shocked. He was the one who had approved Chang Qingyun to ghostwrite for Chief Xie!

For a moment, sweat poured down Zhao Fengtian's forehead. He had just received some news: in the disturbance at Sanhezu, this Chang Qingyun was obviously one of the masterminds.

"This is a big mess!" Zhao Fengtian thought to himself. Once the case was transferred to the Political Security Bureau, he would definitely lose a layer of skin! He tried to keep his composure, piercing together the materials provided by Zheng Ergen in his mind, roughly forming a picture of how this Advisor Yi built a network in the city and extended his tentacles directly to the Senator's side. Such a penniless advisor had quietly pulled off such a huge affair!

"...But this Yi Haoran is hard to deal with," Zheng Ergen said. "He hasn't said a word up to now. Aside from what involves Cai Lan, we know basically nothing about his activities in the city."

"Did you use methods?"

"Of course I did." Zheng Ergen smiled bitterly. "I used all the retained runners from the soap team and gave him a round of all the torture instruments. This scholar is very tough. He screams heaven-shakingly but won't give a single word of confession. I was also afraid of beating him to death and not being able to question him further, so I didn't dare go too hard."

"You did right. Grind him down slowly, don't kill him." Zhao Fengtian calculated in his heart and asked, "Have the other captives been interrogated?"

"We caught dozens, haven't had time to interrogate them in detail yet. Preliminary questioning shows that those who entered the city all claim to be subordinates of a Ming army general named Song Ming. The insiders arrested were all contacted by Yi Haoran and Chang Qingyun. They are all ordinary soldiers and can't say anything useful. Only one named Jiang Suo is relatively suspicious; the others say he might be a leader."

"Then interrogate him as a key focus too." Zhao Fengtian said, "We must find out the situation as soon as possible. Elder Xie is still waiting for our report."

Zheng Ergen shifted his feet uneasily and whispered, "Secretary Zhao, give me a hint. What exactly is Chief Xie's position?"

"What position?" Zhao Fengtian didn't understand for a moment.

"This case involves the Chief, especially that Miss Cai—she tried to assassinate the Chief back then. Does the Chief have any instructions?"

Zhao Fengtian was stunned. He didn't expect Zheng Ergen, who looked rustic and always recited regulations and decrees fluently, to have such thoughts! Come to speak of it, they were thinking along the same lines. Zhao Fengtian weighed his words and asked instead of answering:

"Old Zheng, you, the model of regulations and discipline, have such colorful intestines (cunning thoughts)..."

"I don't have colorful intestines; I squatted in Sanya for over five years!" Zheng Ergen smiled bitterly. "I don't want to go to Taiwan to be a institute director or bureau chief for another few years. You know, matters involving Senators..."

Zheng Ergen stopped halfway, but Zhao Fengtian naturally understood his meaning. However, it wasn't appropriate to speak too clearly at this moment, lest it leave loose ends. He spoke vaguely, "Yes, matters involving Senators must be decided by the Senators themselves." With that, he glanced at Zheng Ergen. The two instantly understood each other silently and shifted their gazes away.

Zhao Fengtian organized the confessions sent by Zheng Ergen, sent someone to understand the unloading of the grain ships, made a simple note, and went to report to Xie Erren without even eating lunch. Xie Erren, however, came over himself first.

Xie Erren had been lying in bed for half the day, thinking over and over without finding a suitable way to escape responsibility. He knew it was impossible to dump the pot completely; the only thing he could do was minimize his responsibility, especially avoiding leaving handles for serious disciplinary violations.

He reviewed his administration since arriving in Wuzhou and felt that although he had problems of "failing to observe" subordinates and being "paralyzingly careless" about enemy intelligence, his overall administration didn't have too many problems. If there was a real mistake, it was only in the matter of Cai Lan.

Leaving aside whether Cai Lan colluded with foreign enemies, just the fact that she had assassinated him back then and he hadn't handled her according to "Enemy Nature" protocols in time, but instead took her into his bed—this was a huge problem. Not to mention she now had strong suspicion of treating with the enemy.

"Putting a female spy in one's own bed." Thinking of the harsh discussions in the Senate and how this matter would become a permanent stain on him, Xie Erren couldn't sleep or eat. If he had only been filled with hatred for Cai Lan's betrayal last night, now he felt extreme disgust on top of it.

"Chief, why did you get up? better rest first..." Zhao Fengtian hurriedly supported him to sit at the desk.

"I'm fine. Although there was a fierce fight with the enemy last night, bumps and bruises are inevitable, but they are just flesh wounds. The enemy can't hurt me yet!" Xie Erren feigned boldness. "With so many things in Wuzhou now, how can I sleep?"

Zhao Fengtian said, "Since the Chief says so, I'm relieved. Let me report on the interrogation situation first..."

"The interrogation isn't urgent, just a few jumping clowns," Xie Erren waved his hand. "I heard the whistle of the grain fleet just now. How is the unloading going?"
