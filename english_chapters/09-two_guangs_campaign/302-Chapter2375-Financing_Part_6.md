# Chapter 2375: Financing (Part 6)

"You are absolutely right. This matter must be nipped in the bud!" Liu Xiang nodded repeatedly.

Taking advantage of the liaison going to call Mu Min, Liu Xiang chatted more with Chu He, smoothing out the details of the cause and effect.

In Liu Xiang's view, this matter was neither too big nor too small.

At its root, it was simply that this self-exiled Senator Chu He had been away from power too long, and his professional ability hadn't been demonstrated or recognized. Before finding a new job, he had nothing left but the title of "Senator" to maintain his dignity. However, today, this "dignity" had been shattered by a secretary who was obviously missing a screw.

Leaving aside whether this was intentionally ordered by Zhou Wei—tsk tsk tsk, the longest one was held up for fifteen days, and if you claim you're really wronged, who would believe you?—regardless of whether it was or not, if only this secretary had the level of a Ken Ken Mai Mai counter, just standing up to greet and asking to sit, Chu He absolutely couldn't have made a fuss. But who could have thought she copied the template of a sales clerk from a state-owned department store in the seventies and eighties—those were the strong ones explicitly prohibited from "beating customers."

Speaking of friction between Senators, during the previous policy dispute between the Northbound and Southbound factions, wasn't the anger even greater?! But no Senator had been wronged to this extent. That Chu He could be so angry that he came running to Liu Xiang—who was actually unrelated in any way—to "pour out his grievances," was it not because—

Liu Xiang quickly jumped his train of thought to "Records of the Grand Historian: Hereditary House of Confucius." At the Qi-Lu Peace Conference, the King of Qi humiliated the Duke of Lu in every way, but the Duke of Lu said nothing; then the King of Qi sent a dwarf to mock the Duke of Lu, and Confucius beside him couldn't stand it anymore, directly calling for a rushing slash:

"A commoner who confuses the lords with entertainment deserves to be executed!"

What right does a mere official slave have to look down on me, a Senator?!

This was Chu He's true mentality.

As for the mail delivery system, there were certainly problems, but it was just a mask. He, Chu He, couldn't very well say the other party was guilty of "lese-majesty"—the Senate had never established such a crime. Moreover, the Senators in this Senate always had "equality and fraternity" on their lips, and their favorite thing to do was to stop grateful natives who were about to kneel and kowtow, saying grandly: "We don't do that here."

Now, not only was none of that left, but one had to beg others shamelessly, and then got a cold shoulder after thrusting one's hot face!

Could this be tolerated? Senators all considered themselves Celestial Dragons. What kind of shabby Celestial Dragon was this! No Senator could tolerate this.

If you really drew your gun and shot this what-ever secretary on the spot, I would have looked at you with more respect. At least there would be fewer troubles left behind. Liu Xiang looked at him with a complicated mood.

But this trouble, interestingly, wasn't without being a good opportunity.

"Aiya! Old Chu, you are hiding great talent! You thought of a good way to raise 300,000 in thirty days just sitting on a boat!" Liu Xiang went along with Chu He's topic to flatter him. Although he only heard the title, it didn't affect Liu Xiang from directly saying this method he hadn't heard the details of was good, after all, there was still a pile of colleagues waiting for him to return in the conference room. "How about this, there's still a work meeting to hold in that large conference room, I really have to go! Old Chu, you're so insightful about economic work, I wonder if you could help advise and give our Guangzhou's economic development a diagnosis?"

Liu Xiang figured the person was now infinitely craving "respect," so it wouldn't be good to directly drive him away after the conversation, otherwise he would certainly become an "accomplice of the same ilk." Having talked this far, Liu Xiang had a sudden inspiration and proposed letting Chu He help "advise" on Guangzhou's economic development. He would first give him some materials, and in the end, even if he came back with nothing but a fart, it would be "a suggestion of great reference value and guiding significance." If he was someone with high emotional intelligence, as long as this favor was right, what harm would it be to let him pound the table in the future and brag that "Guangzhou's economic development was planned by me"?

After putting on another show of "three invitations and three refusals," Liu Xiang cheerfully called over an orderly to take Chu He to a small office with south-north ventilation next door, to study the information on Guangzhou's major wealthy households and the industry and commerce survey briefings on hand—absolutely unclassified, but not easy to produce a version that could be analyzed.

"Hey, I was waiting there for him to come out, but at the door I heard him inviting Zhuge Liang to come out of the mountain, so I came over first. Let me have a glass of water first, I'm parched." Just as Liu Xiang approached the conference room door, he heard Mu Min chatting with Director Zhang.

"Hahaha..." Before the person arrived, laughter came first. Liu Xiang also pushed the door open.

"Today's Zhuge Liang came to throw a tantrum."

"What's up?" Director Wang asked while fanning himself, joining in the fun.

"Today's Zhuge Liang ran into a cobbler." Liu Xiang sat in his seat and briefly recounted Chu He's experience in a few words. After hearing it, the others didn't know what expression to show—after all, the person in question wasn't here, so righteous indignation and such could be dispensed with.

"To be honest, this is indeed somewhat excessive." Zhang Xiaoqi was the first to express her stance, "After all, everyone is a comrade on the same boat. To put it mushily, we are like flesh and blood. A secretary being so neglectful, and still so neglectful to so many Senators—regardless of what schemes they have in mind, this is a matter between Senators. What business does a secretary have meddling?"

Ai Zhixin nodded: "This is not just excessive. At least she should be charged with lese-majesty! Execution, exile, hard labor..."

"Lese-majesty? Does our Senate even have such a crime?" Wang Qiyi shook his head, "We're saying 'our Senate doesn't do that' on one hand while charging others with 'lese-majesty' on the other. That makes it hard for the naturalized citizens."

"Better late than never. Just have the General Office come up with a regulation, wouldn't that be that?" Ai Zhixin said, "Senators must maintain sufficient sanctity!"

"How many degrees should a bow be? How should one greet a Senator? When should one kneel?" Wang Qiyi shook his head repeatedly, "Are you going for Spanish court etiquette or Versailles protocol? That stuff even screwed over the King and Queen themselves quite badly."

"Does he want to make a big fuss?" Mu Min was straightforward as always, hitting the nail on the head. "Then why did you call me over? You don't want me to arrest that whatever secretary, do you?"

Actually, that "live phone office call" was more of a performance. It didn't really matter if Wu Mu couldn't come. This matter hadn't risen to the level of "overthrowing the Senate." It was mainly to show the degree of importance. But calling Mu Min over, Liu Xiang had his own considerations.

"That's between him and Zhou Wei; we won't get involved. Besides, what crime would we arrest someone with?" Liu Xiang first expressed his stance. "But regarding this matter, we still need to be fully vigilant."

The others were confused by Liu Xiang's seemingly contradictory stances. What exactly do you want to do?

Under everyone's gaze, Liu Xiang said what he had just thought of: "It's like this. Comrade Zhou Wei has just received a new assignment, is short-handed, and has no choice but to put all resources to use. Inadvertently arranging an inappropriate person is also understandable." Zhou Wei had been in Guangzhou for so long, and besides the routine visits right after disembarking, he had come to talk heart-to-heart with Liu Xiang a few times. Liu Xiang had first thought Zhou Wei didn't take himself seriously, disappearing all day without knowing what broken business he was running. Now comparing, he actually counted as the "quite valued" batch! At least he "came to visit personally." Besides, no matter what the facts of this matter were, Zhou Wei certainly wouldn't accept the crime of "despising other Senators." If he didn't accept it, was Liu Xiang supposed to help put the hat firmly on him beforehand? That certainly couldn't be! So Liu Xiang simply used the explanation Zhou Wei would inevitably give first.

"But, as for the people at our own hands, whether there are arrogant attitudes, whether there is ideological backsliding—um, this stuff is actually hard to see. But I think, at least we can conduct a self-inspection, to see if the Lord Qins in our various units of Guangzhou Municipal Government are following regulations, whether such work errors have also appeared."

According to Liu Xiang's thinking, with Chu He sitting there, that posture was destined to be irreconcilable; otherwise, he would probably have to go repair computers with Old Zhang—thinking of this, Liu Xiang secretly glanced at Zhang Yunmi sitting next to him taking meeting notes, with a complex gaze containing a hint of amusement and a hint of apology. And whether Zhou Wei was wronged or not, he would inevitably have to take the fall in the end. If he confronted it head-on, then Chu He would only make it bigger, cementing the crime of Zhou Wei deviating from the organization, deviating from the masses (Senators), being disunited and unfriendly, and then Zhou Wei's Nanyang Company couldn't hope to go smoothly.

Therefore, Chu He must be appeased, and as for Zhou Wei, he could be warned, or not warned. But according to the analysis of Director Wang and Director Zhang, once this Nanyang Company really started, the historically accumulated silver underground in Guangzhou would very likely be taken advantage of by him, sucked away to embellish his political achievements, while the Guangzhou Municipal Government would very likely not even get a whiff.

He must be black(mailed) warned!

Since there was going to be a commotion anyway, to give "Senator Chu He" an explanation, why not give Zhou Wei a knock while at it?

However, Zhou Wei and Liu Xiang had no subordinate relationship on the surface. Although the Nanyang Company, which only had a shell, needed all its funds, manpower, and goods to be supplied by Guangzhou, damn it, on the surface there was just no relationship at all...

As Mu Min said, directly arrest that secretary? Looking at Mu Min's watching-a-good-show gaze, Liu Xiang could figure out with his toes: What crime? The Senate didn't have something like "imperial edict," everything had to "be handled according to law."

The only move Liu Xiang could think of in that flash was—I'll inspect myself! You can't stop me from inspecting myself!

"Originally I should have looked for Comrade Wu Mu, but Comrade Wu Mu happens to not be here today. I left a message with his secretary for him to come over as soon as he returns. This matter will probably still involve them." Liu Xiang explained another sentence, and said to Mu Min: "For now, please help, Comrade Mu Min, send some manpower to help with snap inspections."

Saying this, Liu Xiang looked around the Senators in the large conference room and said: "Let me say, everyone shouldn't be afraid of snap inspections, right?"
