# Chapter 2175 - Security Strategy

"Yao uprisings" in the two Guangs had a long history, traceable back to the Song Dynasty. From Song to Ming, a "Yao uprising" cycle of six hundred years ebbed and flowed across Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces. Generally speaking, the "Yao uprisings" developed from north to south: during the Song Dynasty, they occurred mainly in Hunan, but as the Yao people gradually migrated south, by the Ming Dynasty, the "uprisings" mainly occurred in the two Guangs.

The Yao people migrated from Hunan southward, entering Guangdong before Guangxi, but had long used Guangxi as their base. Guangxi's rugged mountains and dense jungles were ideal for the Yao, whose main livelihood was mountain slash-and-burn agriculture. Areas like the Goulou Great Mountains and the Dayao Mountains were major Yao population centers. Ming Dynasty Yao suppression policy focused primarily on Guangxi.

Since the Xuande era, the Guangxi Commander-in-Chief Yun Shan had been pacifying Yao along the Liangguang borders, killing tens of thousands over two years. Subsequently, Liu Pu and Tian Zhen continued massive killings in Guangxi. As a result, large numbers of Guangxi Yao fled into Guangdong, entering the mountainous regions bordering both provinces in the Zhao, Gao, Lei, and Lian prefectures, particularly the Yunkai Great Mountain range of Longshui. Thus, in the Ming Dynasty, Guangdong's "Yao uprisings" occurred mainly south of the West River, from Fengchuan and Kaijian in the west, to Yangchun and Gaozhou in the south, to Gaoyao and Xinxing in the east, using the eastern, western, and rear mountains of Longshui as their base and operating in the various mountain counties along the Liangguang border. The "Yao uprisings" affected a vast area; of Guangdong's ten prefectures at the time, six had Yao unrest.

Located in Longshui County, the Luopang Yao frequently raided the West River, posing a serious threat to the vital communication route between the two Guangs—like a bone stuck in the throat, a long-standing problem. The Ming court established the Governor-General of the Two Guangs in Zhaoqing precisely because of the Yao unrest.

However, after the Yao uprising was suppressed in the fifth year of Wanli (1577) and Longshui County was upgraded to the Luoding Directly-Administered Prefecture, Yao power in Guangdong declined. From then on, large-scale "Yao uprisings" in Guangdong ended. The Yao influence south of the West River no longer existed. Guangdong's Yao areas only remained in the mountainous prefectures and counties of northwestern Guangdong bordering Guangxi and Hunan, their strength greatly diminished. From then on, the scale and scope of "Yao uprisings" continued to shrink. Though there were many disturbances, they never again matched the past scale and momentum.

The "Eight Row Yao uprising" was an outbreak following the "pacification" of Guangdong's Yao uprisings. Though the scale was much smaller than before, in the old timeline it still required the Ming court to mobilize armies from several provinces and deploy tens of thousands of troops for suppression. So from the beginning, the General Staff and the South China Army Command were quite nervous about this "Yao uprising," because the Eight Row Yao uprising had started much earlier than in the original timeline and was much larger in scale.

The originally 1639 "Eight Row Yao uprising" that fully erupted had a limited range, but this time, the uprising came five years early and rapidly expanded due to the collapse of the original Ming army's Yao suppression system in Guangxi. In particular, the withdrawal of the two Lieutenant-Generals for Yao defense in Luoding Prefecture directly created a huge vacuum, and the rebelling Yao militias drove straight south, once again threatening the West River shipping lanes. According to reports from troops and local government, the Yao uprising had expanded from Lianzhou in northwestern Guangdong eastward and southward, with the affected area rapidly growing.

To prevent the Yao uprising from triggering a chain reaction, the General Staff accelerated the deployment of National Army units to the western and northern Guangdong regions to fill defense gaps while dispatching Xu Ke to command large numbers of reconnaissance personnel to scout the areas in western and northern Guangdong where uprisings had occurred. At the same time, extensive document archives and historical records were reviewed.

Based on scout feedback, the scale of the Yao uprising was not as severe as the staff officers had estimated. After the establishment of Luoding Directly-Administered Prefecture in 1577, Yao strength had greatly diminished. Though the Eight Row Yao uprising forces had stirred many Yao villages into joining the rebellion, these villages were generally weak in strength. Yao villages mostly practiced slash-and-burn agriculture in the mountains with minimal savings, relying on traders to import iron implements and salt. Lacking weapons and siege capability, though they could sometimes capture cities through surprise tactics, their overall siege combat ability was weak. The Hakka villages on the edges of the Yao areas had long been in conflict with the Yao, and the instances of their stockades being breached were not many. Therefore, Xu Ke's comprehensive judgment concluded: The scale of the Yao uprising was not too large, nor did it pose too great a threat.

"Isn't your conclusion a bit... optimistic?" Zhu Mingxia asked, frowning, during Xu Ke's report briefing.

"I think we should look at this matter from two perspectives," Xu Ke said. "Currently, disturbances along the West River banks are erupting everywhere, but according to our troop reports, Yao militia activity is mainly on the north bank of the West River—they have not infiltrated the south bank area. Based on historical records analysis, the Yao militia's main mode of operation is 'raiding'—meaning they care more about goods and captives than occupying territory."

The Yao people lived primarily by mountain agriculture, were widely dispersed with small settlements, highly mobile, culturally backward, and lived in hardship. They often took desperate risks for livelihood, commonly descending from the mountains to raid. Though Yao militias had captured Ming prefecture and county seats more than once, they basically all plundered and withdrew, never defending cities to the death.

"The Yao proverb says: 'Officials have ten thousand soldiers, we have ten thousand mountains. When soldiers come, we go; when soldiers go, we come.' Relying on mountains for protection, wearing down the enemy, and ultimately forcing the invading government troops to withdraw—this was the tried-and-true combat doctrine of Yao militias. The Eight Row Yao uprising actually lasted until the fall of the Ming and was only suppressed during the Shunzhi era using this doctrine." Xu Ke spoke eloquently. "So their uprisings often satisfied themselves with descending to raid, then retreating to the mountains to wait for another chance to strike. I researched the Ming army's methods against Yao militias; they particularly emphasized 'containment'—controlling the various land and water exits from the inhabited mountain areas with military force could effectively limit Yao militia activity. I think we can learn from this."

Zhu Mingxia listened to his briefing and felt his thinking was becoming clearer.

"There's another point. Though the Eight Row Yao armed forces have operated over quite a range this time and stirred up quite a few Yao villages to revolt, these villages basically haven't merged with the Eight Row Yao forces—the Yao people of the two Guangs are different from southwestern Yunnan-Guizhou. They don't have great chieftains who have ruled for hundreds or thousands of years like virtual emperors, such as the Yang clan of Bozhou or the An clan of Shuixi. The Yao do have leaders called 'headmen,' but their power is limited and their jurisdictions small. With backward economies, they generally cannot form large armed groups—don't be fooled by all these Yao villages rebelling now; they actually won't merge with the Eight Row Yao forces. For these Yao villages, rebellion is merely seizing the opportunity presented by the Ming army's collapse and the security vacuum to descend and plunder. As long as the National Army moves in quickly and rebuilds social order, the uprisings in these mountain villages will rapidly subside."

"You're saying that aside from the Eight Row Yao in Lianshan, the Yao uprisings in other areas are not worth worrying about? We don't need to specially dispatch troops to suppress them?"

This question carried significant responsibility. Xu Ke considered for a moment, then replied firmly: "That's right. Based on the document compilations from the Great Library and intelligence gathered from local elders and officials, as long as we can control local security and transportation arteries, we can effectively curb Yao raiding activities. Actually, even if we launch a suppression campaign, it would just be traversing mountains and ridges to attack stockades; there are no substantial armed groups for us to encircle and annihilate."

"So that's how it is." Zhu Mingxia nodded. "This is essentially a security pacification campaign."

"Exactly," Xu Ke said. "If we really mobilize large formations for suppression, that would be using a cannon to swat mosquitoes and would severely tie down our field forces. It's more appropriate to let the National Army deal with them. Actually, the most concerning issue right now isn't the Yao uprising—it's the local bandit problem. Their mobility far exceeds that of the Yao militias, and their destructive capacity is greater."

Bandits were an old problem. In 17th-century China, wherever there were people, there were bandits—even a "model capital" like Beijing had bandits operating just outside the city gates. Guangzhou, known as the foremost city under Southern Heaven, still had the possibility of being robbed or kidnapped by the "Great Heaven's Second" bandits as soon as one stepped outside the Big or Small North Gate. The banks of the golden waterway of the West River were naturally no exception. The collapse of the Guangdong Ming army and the destruction from local warfare had caused bandit numbers and equipment levels to multiply several times.

"...What's now raiding counties everywhere, attacking our troops and personnel, and putting enormous pressure on us is actually the bandits," Xu Ke said. "What worries me most is that the bandits might merge with the rebelling Yao. From current observations, there are already signs of this trend."

In the original timeline, the 1635 Yao uprising was minor; only the Eight Row Yao participated, briefly capturing Lianshan County seat and seizing the county seal before withdrawing into the mountain hollows to fight a guerrilla war with government forces. The real uproar came eight years later, when the Eight Row Yao joined forces with the Lang people of Lianshan County and linked up with tens of thousands of roving bandits under Zhang Xianzhong's generals Tang Taozhong and Yang Guozhi, successively capturing Lianshan and Lianzhou and raiding Yangshan, Yingde, and other places. The momentum was immense, and it wasn't suppressed until the Shunzhi era by Qing forces.

"...If we can't restore social order quickly, and the bandits form large roving bands, and the Yao militias merge on a large scale with these roving bandits, the situation then will be a hundred times harder to manage than now." Xu Ke then mentioned an important piece of intelligence.

"According to our interrogation of prisoners, many of the bandits currently operating in the West River basin are not scattered Ming soldiers but 'official bandits' from Guangxi."

"Official bandits?!" Zhu Mingxia was startled. "You mean Xiong Wencan..."

"Correct," Xu Ke nodded. "Though our intelligence is limited, Ming soldiers from Guangxi have infiltrated back into Guangdong in the form of small bandit groups and become bandits themselves."

"Xiong Wencan is short of grain and pay; would his soldiers be willing to be sent back to die?"

"Why wouldn't they?" Xu Ke said. "They're being sent to be bandits, not to fight. Being a bandit means freedom; all the plundered women and goods are their own—isn't that better than a few months' military pay?"
