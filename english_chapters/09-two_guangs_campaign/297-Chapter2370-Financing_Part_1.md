# Chapter 2370: Financing (Part 1)

The ice business was not unfamiliar to the Senate. Since the Senate could build cold storage, ice blocks had been sold to Guangzhou as a trade commodity. The various iced drinks in Purple Ming Pavilion in summer and the "local air conditioners" in the rooms were all products from the Lingao Cold Storage. High officials and noble people also gradually got used to ordering ice blocks from Zicheng Ji to create coolness for themselves in summer.

The weather in Nanyang and India was even hotter—speaking of which, present-day Guangdong could still harvest ice in natural ways during the coldest days of winter, but Southeast Asia and India definitely did not have this condition. Not to mention that the ice trade could be expanded to the Red Sea coast in the future.

If this business becomes big, it might be more profitable than selling sugar—at least it can fully utilize cargo space.

Thinking of this, Xu Yanliang couldn't help feeling a bit excited. Originally, he felt chaotic about the company's layout and development in Sanya, but now he slowly had a line of thought.

December 1, 1635.

"Faster, a bit faster." Chu He paced anxiously on the deck while muttering to himself. Captain Zhou Shengfu standing aside was very puzzled. They could almost see the lights of Lingao Point. Bopu Pier was right in front of them; why was this Senator still so anxious? Could there be an emergency at home?

Zhou Shengfu had been running the Hong Kong-Lingao route for quite some time, and it was really rare to see a Senator like this one with his butt on fire. Even when transporting wounded for the Logistics Department, racing against time, he hadn't seen the accompanying Senator doctor urging like this.

"Chief, don't worry, our ship can only run this fast..." He explained, "But since we can see the lighthouse now, we will definitely arrive in another hour." After speaking, he also paced and slowly moved away from Chu He.

Chu He cursed secretly. If not for rushing time, who the hell would take your clumsy old-style big ship? But the speed was uncomplimentable; it could only go three or four nautical miles an hour. It was almost twice as slow as the H800 he took from Jeju to Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, there were no ships from Hong Kong to Lingao within a week. The reason was also simple: the plague blockade in Guangzhou had just ended, and the liner route to Lingao had not yet been restored. He could only go back and forth with ships transporting "special needs materials." The only one that allowed him to transfer "seamlessly" was this dilapidated old slow ship.

His family was not in Lingao—since he was appointed as the Provost of Jeju National School last year, he had brought his family to Jeju. He felt the climate there was much better than Lingao. As for the children, it was not time for primary school yet, so he just kept them by his side.

What drove him to change several ships and rush to Lingao anxiously was not a family emergency, but the burning "ambition."

With great difficulty, the cargo ship docked at the pier. Chu He was waiting at the gangway before the ship even docked. As soon as the sailors set up the gangway, he couldn't wait to rush down with his guard. Zhou Shengfu hurriedly shouted from behind: "Chief, the Chief's special passage is over here!"

Chu He walked out quickly without looking back. The sentries on the pier didn't even have time to salute him before he brushed past. The guard Xiao Pu carrying the suitcase trotted all the way behind. As soon as they exited the port gate, Chu He got on the Senator carriage arranged by the General Office and said immediately: "Bairen City, Senator Villa Area, quick!" The coachman didn't speak either, raised his hand and cracked the whip, and the carriage proceeded rapidly towards Bairen City.

Chu He sat in the carriage. The scenery outside the window was quite different from when he went to Jeju five years ago, but he was in no mood to pay attention. Five years ago, he was a "soy sauce Senator" (slacker), muddling along in Fangcaodi. Now he was still a soy sauce Senator, muddling along in Jeju National School. Such a dull and ordinary life had made him bored. The opportunity to change all this was right in front of him. This time, he absolutely had to hold the opportunity tightly in his hands.

As soon as he got off the carriage, he walked towards his house in Lingao, which he hadn't returned to for a long time. Walking fast all the way, even when old acquaintances greeted him on the road, he just responded hurriedly without stopping a half step.

Returning to his apartment and opening the door, the room emitted a dampness peculiar to houses unoccupied for a long time, but the environment in the room was tidy, obviously cleaned frequently.

He walked into the study, taking off his coat while saying to Xiao Pu, "Open the box and take out my computer." Xiao Pu placed Chu He's laptop on the desk.

"Chief, do you want me to unpack for you..."

"No need." Chu He said, "Go to the Service Agency and ask them to send me a dinner, and a pot of tea. By the way, take my dirty clothes to wash. You go to rest in your dormitory after notifying them; no need to take care of me."

"Yes, Chief."

After the guard left, Chu He lit a cigarette, plugged in the power and the network cable. Having not used it for so many days, would there be any problems? Fortunately, whether it was power supply or network, everything was normal.

Chu He took out a draft from his briefcase and typed the content of the draft into the computer against it. The title of the draft read "Proposal on Simultaneous use of Equity and Debt for Nanyang Company Financing."

Before crossing, Chu He was a "financial migrant worker," working as a trader in a public offering fund. He decided to cross because of emotional problems. Since his original job and professional background were all useless skills in the eyes of the Senate, he first drove an excavator for a few months after D-day, and later slacked off in the Military Group and Fangcaodi. Because of his lazy nature, he was neither willing to strictly observe military discipline and set an example in the army, nor willing to punch in for class and take exams on time in school. Therefore, after Zhang Zhixiang rectified Fangcaodi in 1633, Chu He found that he couldn't "muddle along" in Fangcaodi anymore. Not only did a group of Senators "dedicated to the cause of education" regard him as a "lazybones," even the naturalized teachers felt that he was "not attending to his proper duties," so that Hu Qingbai bluntly interviewed him privately, asking him to "exert the positive influence of a Senator" and "not to shame the Senate."

In order to prevent Hu Qingbai from kicking him out of Fangcaodi unbearably and asking the Organization Department to "arrange other work" for him, and the Senate assigning him a job like driving an excavator again, he decided to take the initiative to apply to go to Jeju to be a teacher—the Senate planned to open a National School on Jeju Island—as the first National School in the northern region, the Senate attached great importance to this. They planned to send a Senator to organize it.

Jeju Island was far away from the emperor; it was an excellent place to slack off. Moreover, running a school there didn't have those rules and regulations, and he could be a gentleman quietly. He didn't understand civil engineering, but people from Lingao Construction Company would do it anyway. He just needed to "rule by doing nothing."

Immediately, he submitted an application to the education sector. Hu Qingbai was eager to "send away the god," and there were few Senators on Jeju Island originally. Feng Zongze naturally couldn't ask for more seeing a Senator willing to support Jeju construction. So with his strong support, Chu He became the Director of the Preparatory Office of Jeju Island National School.

Chu He stayed in Jeju for more than two years. Besides preparing for the construction of the school, he also served as a teacher for two years. During this period, he also assisted Feng Zongze in handling some internal affairs of Jeju. The days were carefree and comfortable. But overall, he achieved nothing. Except for Hu Qingbai and the General Office still remembering him, he gradually became a person forgotten by the Senate. As he grew older, seeing himself still "dangling around," his lazy heart gradually faded, and he felt he couldn't go on slacking like this anymore.

Returning to the finance sector was certainly a choice, but the main business of the current finance sector had little to do with "finance," mainly focusing on "accounting." His expertise in funds, stocks, and the like had little room for display in Lingao's world. Going there would only be a senior accountant. And he was not unfamiliar with the accounting profession, but he couldn't say he was very familiar with it either.

While in conflict, the Great Discussion triggered by the Wuzhou Incident caused a clear shift in the Senate's policy. The establishment of the Nanyang Company made Chu He keenly feel that the opportunity had come: once matters like stock issuance, bond financing, and stock trading were involved, it would be time for him to show his skills. Last month, as soon as he saw the news about preparing to build the Guangzhou Stock Exchange and raising private funds published in "Weekly News," he immediately got spirited—wasn't this a heaven-sent opportunity for him?! He decided to return to Lingao, submit the financing plan he prepared, and strive for a position in the Nanyang Company.

On this journey, as soon as he arrived at a port, he used his Senator status to change to the fastest ship, rushing to Lingao like wind and fire. On the way, while perfecting his financing plan, he prayed not to see news in the newspaper that the Nanyang Company's financing plan had been settled. After two weeks of sailing, Chu He finally appeared in his home. Ignoring the hardships of travel, he wanted to post his plan on the BBS quickly. While typing, the expressions of other Senators' approval already emerged in his mind, and a smile couldn't help but appear at the corner of his mouth.

While letting his imagination run wild, someone knocked on the door outside. It turned out to be people from the Service Agency delivering dinner. He suddenly remembered something, quickly filled out a temporary pass, sealed it in an envelope, wrote a few lines on the cover, and handed it to the waiter.

"Send someone to deliver this letter to this address immediately."

"We will send someone right away." The waitress took the envelope, showing an ambiguous smile on her face. Obviously, she knew clearly what was inside.

It was late at night. Senator Chu He lay on the bed sleeplessly. Beside him slept a woman with a graceful figure; her slightly rising and falling silhouette looked curvaceous under the cover of the sheet. However, the pleasure of the night only relaxed Senator Chu's mood for a while. At this moment, all was silent outside, and anxiety occupied Senator Chu's mind again.

Just now, after posting the post, he had browsed the relevant various plans on the BBS. In general, issuing stocks and engaging in a stock exchange was the consensus of many people in the financial sector. Various plans had their own merits. Some plans had many people's replies behind them. They looked very popular.
