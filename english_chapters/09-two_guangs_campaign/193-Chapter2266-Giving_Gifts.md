# Chapter 2266: Giving Gifts

In the courtyard of the main hall, a row of wooden boxes was placed. Counting them, there were exactly thirty-one. Several retained personnel of the county and local commoners were examining them one by one in turn. Occasionally, a dispute would arise. However, they always reached an agreement quickly, and the clerk behind them would make a tick mark with a brush on the folder.

The air was filled with a mixture of the smell of lime and decay. Yet, the people present seemed not to notice it at all.

After about half an hour, the retained clerk ran up to the main hall, presented the folder, and said, "Magistrate! The inspection is correct!"

Sitting upright in the main hall was the Director of Yangshan County, Bi Da. Besides her, several county cadres were also watching the boxes in the courtyard outside.

Bi Da picked up the folder and glanced at the unchecked marks on it. There were thirty-one heads in total. After identification by local relevant personnel, not a single one was missing; the names matched the heads.

Bi Da let out a slight breath and said, "So Feng Haijiao is finished."

"Exactly." Peng Shou’an looked happy, stood up and bowed, "Congratulations, Magistrate..."

Although the surrounding cadres looked down on his fawning manner, his words were pleasing to the ear. Since they arrived in Yangshan, they had racked their brains over the bandit problem. They had heard the fame of the "Three Tyrants of Yangshan" until calluses grew in their ears. Now that these three groups of men and horses were all eliminated, everyone felt a big stone had been moved from their hearts.

"This Yangshan County finally sees the sun after the rain!" Luo Yiming’s brows relaxed.

Naturally, Yangshan still had the problem of the Yao people, but since the suppression of Sun Dabiao, the Yonghua Yao people had roughly restored calm. Senator Huang’s military actions in Lianzhou and other places had also basically suppressed the spread of the Eight Rows Yao rebellion. Although there were sporadic Yao disturbances locally, like small groups of bandits causing trouble, they no longer had much impact on social order.

Now that Feng Haijiao was also beheaded, the last great scourge of Yangshan was removed. The Yangshan section of the Lian River was completely restored to operation. This was of great significance not only to Yangshan but also to restoring the trade route leading outside the province.

Once public security was restored, merchants entering and leaving Guangdong could pass through. For a place like Yangshan with poor land and poor people, the economic stimulus and income driven by the transit of merchants were crucial. especially since Chief Huang had also given them specific instructions to do a good job in the purchase, processing, and export of "local products and forestry products." Most of these goods still needed merchants' transportation and sales work, besides going through the cooperative system.

Originally, they had racked their brains on how to cleanly and thoroughly eradicate this last scourge of Yangshan. After Feng Haijiao suddenly abandoned Qinglian Market, the county once lost its target. Only a few days later did news come that Feng Haijiao had gone to Thunder Struck Slope.

Those familiar with the county's situation naturally knew what kind of place Thunder Struck Slope was. Once Feng Haijiao went up the mountain, it would be very difficult for the county to exterminate him again unless heavy troops and cannons were deployed.

Now that Xin Laonan had disposed of Feng Haijiao in an internal strife, not only killing Feng Haijiao but also presenting the heads of Feng’s main bandit leaders, it was not only a great merit for Yangshan but also a timely rain for the Senate's administrative institutions in Yangshan, which were stretched to the limit and terribly busy.

"In this way, our administration in Yangshan will be smooth," You Ciren said. "The pressure on public security has instantly decreased."

Currently, the National Army and militia supported by the county numbered more than a thousand. Although social order was restored through this, the financial pressure of raising a large number of troops was great. In particular, the current financial gap was mostly filled by the "Reasonable Burden" on local large households. If this continued for a long time, it would be a heavy burden for the large households too, and it was unknown how their attitude would change.

Bi Da did not participate in their discussion. She pondered for a moment and ordered: "Take all the heads to the city gate for display." After saying this, she picked up the letter and gift list sent with the heads and handed them to Peng Shou’an.

"Mr. Peng, I don't know many characters. I can't understand this letter full of literary phrases. Please explain it to me."

Peng Shou’an hurriedly took it. This letter was actually not very literary; it was written entirely in vernacular colloquialisms. The letter was written in Xin Laonan’s name. The first half was about being "muddled for a moment, presumptuously resisting the Heavenly Army, and harboring bandits." The latter part said he "repented" and was willing to submit to the Great Song. Therefore, borrowing the opportunity of Feng Haijiao going up the mountain to seek refuge, he annihilated him and presented the heads to show his sincerity, and so on. The wording was humble, and one could feel a strong desire to survive.

Sent along with the letter were not only thirty-one human heads but also gifts: one hundred *shi* of grain, one thousand taels of white silver, two boxes of various jewelry and curios, twenty bolts of silk, one hundred bolts of cotton cloth... The handwriting was not small.

Peng Shou’an read and explained, taking quite a while to finish readings, and laughed: "This Xin Laonan can be considered tactful. He sent us a heavy gift."

"He sent heads and gifts; what does he want?"

"He didn't say what he wanted, only said it was to show sincerity." Peng Shou’an read it a few more times and replied.

"He didn't mention amnesty?"

"No," Peng Shou’an shook his head. "Director, Xin Laonan is not a bandit, just a local large household—considered a good subject. What amnesty does he need..."

"Is there a good subject like him?" You Ciren roasted, "Although Xin Laonan washed his hands in a golden basin many years ago, he used to be a great bandit on the Sui River, killing and robbing countless times. Now that he has swallowed Feng Haijiao’s subordinates and wealth, and entrenched himself in such a perilous place as Thunder Struck Slope, he will inevitably be a scourge in the future."

Bi Da was very conflicted in her heart at this moment. From her original intention, a local power like Xin Laonan, who acted like a local emperor, was also a target for her to eradicate. But now Xin Laonan not only actively submitted but also specially sent the heads of Feng Haijiao and others, removing a major trouble for Yangshan. Not to mention the legendary difficulty of attacking Thunder Struck Slope, even among local large households, leaving a name of "mean and ungrateful" might be feared—after all, compared to the Three Tyrants of Yangshan, Xin Laonan’s crimes were very hidden, and he mostly harmed passing merchants, so local public anger was very small.

Although they had won successive victories in Yangshan, she knew very well that the current improvement in public security had a lot to do with the cooperative attitude of the local large households. To follow Chief Huang's instructions: pacify the situation in Yangshan as soon as possible, she could only hold her nose and continue to cooperate with the large households.

It was a pity that Feng Haijiao was not exterminated by herself. Otherwise, she could have carried out an extermination-style disposal no less than at Dalang Market, to awe the large households and Yao people in the area.

Thinking of this, she made up her mind. She asked, "Who sent these things?"

"Ouyang Xi sent a steward to deliver them." Peng Shou’an replied, "The messenger delivering the letter dared not come to see you personally, Old One..."

"Oh? Why?" Bi Da asked strangely, "Doesn't the book say: 'Two countries at war do not kill messengers'? I am not a man-eating monster; why dare not come to see me?"

Now all the cadres laughed. Luo Yiming laughed; "Since we took Dalang Market and killed Sun Dabiao’s gang, the county has practically described you as a monster with a blue face and fangs..."

"Someone outside described you as a female goblin captured by the Chiefs from the Li mountains of Hainan Island, who needs to drink human blood to survive."

"Magistrate Bi can stop children from crying at night in Yangshan now."

...

The county cadres were probably infected by the relaxed atmosphere, vying to tell legends about Bi Da in the county one by one. The atmosphere in the main hall was extremely cheerful. Only Peng Shou’an smiled without speaking—he was still not used to this atmosphere of no distinction between high and low status—even if the superior was a Li barbarian woman.

"Unexpectedly I became like this," Bi Da smiled yet seemed to sigh, "Also right! I was originally a *Jinmu*—do you know what a *Jinmu* is? It's a monster from our place..."

You Ciren probably knew some of Bi Da's past, and being falsely accused as a *Jinmu* was a sore point for her, so he hurriedly comforted: "This is all because local natives are ignorant and haven't seen a woman as an official, speaking nonsense. Since ancient times, heavy codes are used in chaotic times; inevitably one gets criticized and discussed. Don't take it to heart..."

"Not at all, I am very happy in my heart. The common people of Yangshan fear me, and the large households and bandits fear me even more—this is right. They have to fear first before we can do our work well. Mr. Peng—" She turned to Peng Shou’an, "Trouble you to make a trip to the Ouyang family and invite that messenger to come over for a chat tonight."

After Peng Shou’an left, You Ciren asked, "Magistrate! What is your idea on this matter?"

"My thought is this..." Bi Da recounted her considerations one by one, saying, "...Xin Laonan is naturally a hidden danger, but our strength is not strong enough yet. It is impossible to ask the Fubo Army to help us in suppression in a short time. Taking the natural barrier of Thunder Struck Stockade is impossible. So my view is to temporarily accept Xin Laonan’s amnesty. Although he may not be sincere, at least it can keep Yangshan calm for a period of time—firstly to paralyze him, and secondly to accumulate strength. Time is on our side. The longer it drags on, the fewer cards Xin Laonan has to play."

"But that place of his is very precipitous, and he has swallowed Feng Haijiao’s men, money, and grain. He can attack to advance and defend to retreat. Without removing them, it is always a hidden danger for the county..." Someone raised an objection.

"A hidden danger for the county is correct. But I know the place Thunder Struck Slope," You Ciren was not a local, but was very familiar with military geography annals, and after arriving in Yangshan, he focused on understanding the local geographical situation, "It is very remote, surrounded by mountainous areas, with no key traffic routes. It is insignificant to the entire county administration. Furthermore, although the terrain of Thunder Struck Slope is precipitous and hard for us to attack up, it is not easy for the enemy to come down either. We only need to deploy a squad of the National Army at Hu Bay to effectively monitor their movements. Although Thunder Struck Slope has paddy fields and can be self-sufficient, he has now swallowed Feng’s subordinates, increasing the population several times. Growing grain on the mountain by himself is definitely not enough to eat; he inevitably has to rely on external supplies. We can use this to strangle his neck. So my suggestion is, accepting Xin Laonan’s submission is fine, but we must strangle his neck. The place Hu Bay is just right."
