# Chapter 2000 - Softening

Wang Qiyi's mood was not bad. At the task force dinner cum briefing meeting in Room 114 of Finance and Tax Bureau, he even told a dirty joke smoothly. However, not sure if too implicit, except Chu Xiaoran other four seemed completely didn't understand. But this didn't affect his emotion at all.

Lin and Shi families were prepared for task force arrival, but caught off guard by task force requirement of sealing accounts and extended audit. Wang Qiyi thought well long ago. Discussing twists and turns these guys were unknown how much stronger than rookies under his hand. What he could rely on were only two strips: comparison of related businesses and strict implementation of case handling discipline. So-called building hard stockades fighting dull battles meant this.

"That Old Man Lin saw the running water [statement] of Noble Gathering we took out, face turned green. Hahahaha," Chu Xiaoran felt quite smooth today. Big households like Lin Family she dared not think in past now yes-yes-ing in front of herself also made her very happy. "Then, we slowly took out other families' account books. Taking out one, that Master Lin face black one penny. Finally when nine books all piled on table, his face was about same as dead person. Team Leader Yao, Comrade Xu say aren't it."

"Isn't it. Especially that Young Master Lin. Started rushing in anxiously. Result account books not taken all out yet. He said not a sentence running out anxiously again. Where is a bit rule of big household."

"He was scared silly. In past where official servants did this? Team Leader Zeng, how about your side?" Yao Yulan mood good today too. Their group had Xu Zhewei and Chu Xiaoran two persons who worked as accountant and inner manager originally. Basically confirmed Lin Family's white slip dealings without spending much effort. Next step was expanding result using this as breakthrough point.

"Similar to yours. But Shi Family has place relatively special. Is besides used in city he still has business in Qiongzhou." Zeng Juan put down chopsticks in hand flipping notebook. "Right, is in Sanya. Before our peripheral investigation only said it has a branch. This time getting accounts I and Comrade Huang tallied roughly. This business is not simple a branch. Capital Shi Family invested inside is not small."

"Isn't Qiongzhou long under Senate rule? Then he has no chance to steal tax leak tax. Your chunk of meat isn't fat."

"Sanya this branch very big?" Wang Qiyi shoveled a big mouthful of rice. Then picked up report of Zeng Juan their group aside chewing reading.

"Mm... Not simple, not simple." Wang Qiyi nodded slowly. Mouth corner actually leaked some smile. "Little Zeng, this Sanya branch is managed by that Young Master Shi nicknamed Chair Shi?"

"Yes. Shi Family Second Young Master Shi Misi."

"Hehe, this is very interesting." Wang Qiyi seemed child seeing new toy suddenly. Two eyes releasing light. "I make adjustment now. Zeng Juan, Huang Ping you two set off to Sanya tomorrow. Check Shi Family just smooth this line. As for his family in city I will arrange others. Do handover well. Yao Yulan you take Chu Xiaoran, Xu Zhewei continue digging deep in Lin Family! Make into Iron Case, understand?"

"Yes!"

Smooth degree of two groups far exceeded Wang Qiyi's imagination. Although he had seen accounting level of this plane in previous tax census and daily patrol. But he didn't know why always had some fear towards these big households in heart. Always felt level of accountants of Merchant Princes in this Number One Commercial Port of South China shouldn't differ too much from average standard of Big Four in old timeline. Worried himself becoming first "Professional" in Senate slapped face pa-pa by natives backward hundreds of years. Result today's result gave him a Reassurance Pill solidly. These Merchant Princes were hardworking. Means level also definitely not low. But Kung Fu all spent outside account books. Using Zeng Juan's words: "We even helped finding back many deficits. Does this count inspection or charity."

Thinking next step following gradual implementation of tax system, conversely would force these big households starting to do fake accounts seriously. Wang Qiyi felt a kind of absurd joy.

Of course, this was also excusable. Fraudsters of this spacetime generally wouldn't allow things developing to "Checking Accounts" step. Really reaching degree needing "Checking Accounts," matter basically counted settled down. No wonder when they went to Liang Residence today, servants inside faced like dead ash one by one, like losing deceased parents. Even Liang Family father and son faces weren't quite good looking—Could see just calmness under striving to support.

Today's visit situation made him full of confidence in future inspection work—Guangzhou City had quite a few gentry big households. Now their black materials already accumulated quite a lot. Checking accounts family by family. "Having Law to Abide" "Violating Law Must investigate" "Enforcing Law Must be Strict." Few rounds could destroy their foundation from economy.

Everything in this world speaking to bottom all needs material basis. Destroying their material basis, these aristocratic families big households naturally will decline. Need not move knife move gun. Also can let common people see their helpless declining process and ugly state struggling in decline with own eyes. Completely depriving possibility of them taking themselves tragic once, leaving noble spirit good name.

Compared to Lin Shi two families, approach of Liang Family made Wang Qiyi feel difference of Politics Business Aristocratic Family of new spacetime truly and clearly. He saw this legendary Young Master Liang for first time. Near forty years old age. A style of grace. Advancing retreating speaking talking quite had bearing. Neither humble nor arrogant. Replying answering spirit fixed idle seemed talking about other family's matter.

When Li Fulai took out Noble Gathering running water copy asking him to explain money silver dealings between two families, he was just shaking folding fan lightly speaking slowly: "Director Wang, Director Li observe clearly. My Liang Family's documents wrote clearly on white paper black words. Withdrawing shares leveling accounts. Luo Family and my Liang Family signed and drew pledge. Share debt money silver wrote off once since then. As for this account book, student not born learning accountant. Cannot read..."

"Hehehe, cut in two so crisply? When Noble Gathering submitted to Liang Family back then, Liang Family asked shouldn't be this little." Li Fulai not forgiving.

"Director Li don't mention matter of submitting back then again. Trend of submitting prevailed in former dynasty. Whenever having a Juren degree, naturally someone comes to submit property. Nothing more than evading a few Court tax money, avoiding harassment of Yamen clerks. My Liang Family two generations Jinshi. People sheltering under door unknown how many. But receiving some filial profit money monthly. Where can manage accounts of these many families? Besides that's others' property after all. We just fake a title plotting few dismantling money supporting family gate. Neither can nor convenient to intervene others' business. Since Senate came to Guangzhou, newspaper propagates New Tax Law daily. Your Bureau's several cadres also visit humble house often to preach. Student also knows this Submitting Sheltering matter is illegal matter in New Society. My Liang Family since under Great Song rule, naturally want to abide Great Song Law. Matter of submitting cleaned long ago. Noble Gathering and Luo Family also registered in Guangzhou Prefecture Yamen and Your Finance and Tax Bureau respectively. Two sides no more involvement. Everything only discussed by share debt."

Young Master Liang's speech was pleasant to hear, tight seam closed seam. Attitude also counted cooperative. Li Fulai for a time couldn't grab handle in his words. Cursed secretly: "This Glass Egg is slippery not staying hand!" Asked again:

"Advisor Liao of Noble Gathering said to be old person of Liang Family? Why went to Noble Gathering being accountant again?"

"Advisor Liao originally not entered household registration. Initially he returned home for mourning and resigned. Originally no involvement with Liang Family. He is also person with old and small. Must seek a mouthful of rice to eat. Noble Gathering hiring as Advisor, also just daily employment. East West Guest Host only. What impropriety?"

"Matter just so coincidental? Accountants in Guangzhou City no thousand also five hundred. Why hiring him specially?"

"Business of Noble Gathering, although student family has some shares, but after all not family property. Only sitting receiving dividend annually. What person his family use, why use, student neither knows nor convenient to ask more. Even if he has places of fault, own Senate law to dispose. Great Song all relies on evidence, stressing not engaging in implication. This words fear inappropriate."

This sentence conversely stuffed Li Fulai speechless.

"Alright alright, Director Li. If not understanding can understand slowly. Not one two days work." Wang Qiyi reached out stopping Li Fulai. Li's level not high enough. Couldn't cope with old fox like Young Master Liang on speech. Of course, Li Fulai could also shout loudly: "Liang Two! You stand up for me! This isn't place for you to play prestige. You confess problem honestly for me!"

However Senate didn't popularize this set—He Wang Qiyi didn't like this set either. He approved "Ruling Country by Law" very much. Despised certain people in Senate very much. They forgot they are rulers. Law is own will—Write a strip if no law.

He turned to Liang Wendao: "Master Liang, Liang Family accounts numerous mixed. Can let Director Li take back let them read for some more days. Avoid mistake ruining Liang Family clear reputation."

Liang Wendao smiled slightly said: "Director Wang words heavy. Planning its policy in its position. This is proper meaning. Just take accounts away." Looked at Liang Cunhou again. "You say those worldly affairs told father days ago to Director Wang listening."

"Yes, Father." Liang Cunhou endured nausea rising bowing to Wang Qiyi. He had Juren degree on body. In past where was logic acting like this. Helpless this Bandit group of crude blanks ignored Teaching of Names Scholars. For Big Situation only good to imitate Han Xin matter back then. "Director Wang. My Liang Family established family by Farming Reading. Merchant matters all cleared Leveled accounts by April New Calendar no more involvement. Fields outside city also reported with pledge. Absolutely no concealment. Hope Senate observe clearly! Specific situation, student already ordered person organizing into volume. Please Your Bureau take back for reference together."

Wang Qiyi face carrying smile. Saying repeatedly: "Good good good, you cooperating our work, we are also very grateful. These account books wait us finish checking, return together." He waved hand to crowd. "Everyone collect account books well—Open clearly on Temporary Detention Receipt—Hand to Liang Family for keeping."
