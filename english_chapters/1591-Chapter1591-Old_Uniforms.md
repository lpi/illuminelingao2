# Chapter 1591 - Old Uniforms

"Have you sent out your Public Security Army company?" Mu Min straightened up and asked again.

Although Li Yayang was the Lingao Garrison Commander, Mu Min was the "Director of the Cultural Festival Security Countermeasures Headquarters" and exercised command authority over security management.

"They've been sent out," Li Yayang said. "But looking at the trends, it's not enough. My only mobile force left is the Riot Control Company."

Originally, the Lingao Garrison Command had one National Army company and three Public Security Army companies under its command, which could barely plug the gaps in general security. However, the comprehensive campaign to "crack down on theft and destruction of communication equipment," jointly launched by the National Police and Lingao Telecom, had drained all the manpower. The only available unit left was a Korean company.

Although the loyalty of the Korean Public Security Army was not an issue, they were unfamiliar with the language and had low military quality. They could only serve as "door gods," using their bright helmets and armor to deter people. For actual security tasks, the police still had to be relied upon.

"The Riot Control Company cannot be moved. In case of a mass incident, this is our only mobile force." Mu Min stared at the various colored markers on the transparent glass board, biting her lip in contemplation. Today, their task was to ensure the normal operation of the Cultural Festival and the safety of the Senators and naturalized citizen performers. Specific arrest operations were not their responsibility.

The telephone suddenly rang rapidly. Mu Min picked it up herself without waiting for her assistant to answer.

"This is Mu Min." A moment later, her face suddenly became grave as she said, "This is a new situation. Okay, I understand. You don't need to interrogate him in detail. Take him directly to the Political Security Bureau and hand him over to Wu Mu!"

"You're saying a prostitute bought National School uniforms from you?" Yang Cao looked at Gou Buli with sharp eyes, making bystanders feel a chill.

A few minutes ago, a carriage from the General Affairs Section 9 had sped over, delivering this middle-aged man with a black cloth bag over his head to her office.

According to the introduction from the Section 9 police officer who handed him over, this man had walked into the police station's duty room early that morning, trembling as he shouted to the duty officer: "Someone is rebelling!"

According to regulations, shouting this phrase automatically triggered relevant investigation procedures. Of course, if he was talking nonsense, the consequences would be very serious. No one except a madman would dare to make such a joke.

The officer on duty did not dare to neglect this and immediately called for the Senator police officer on duty. After a few sentences of conversation, the officer immediately discovered a serious problem. Subsequently, Lingao's dictatorship organs began to revolve rapidly around Gou Buli.

"Yes, yes, it is... absolutely true." Gou Buli trembled, trying to calm himself down. To emphasize the importance of his verified content, he immediately added, "It was a Non-National!"

Gou Buli was one of the early "followers" in Lingao, but he had been speculative at the beginning and his stance was not firm. He did not become a naturalized citizen cadre like others, but was content to be a small restaurant owner, gathering information for the Australians to earn some benefits.

Over the years, he regretted it more and more. Compared to other naturalized citizens who surrendered at the same time, although he still received an allowance as a "trustee" of the police to collect clues about petty thefts, he remained a petty urbanite. He was not much better off than when he was a cook for the Gou family. Last time, he saw Yang Zeng, a former house servant of the Gou family, wearing a military uniform and carrying a foreign saber, walking past the street with three or four soldiers. He was so jealous and regretful that he almost wanted to commit suicide.

A huge opportunity for wealth and honor had just slipped away from him so easily. Gou Buli knew that if he wanted to sell himself and seek refuge now, he couldn't do it without some real talent and learning. So his only hope was that a "treason case" would fall into his hands.

Although he was just a "sitting spy" and could access very little "material," his heart for exposing a "treason" case never died. He usually reported even sesame-sized trivial matters to the police station. Being brought to this mysterious place blindfolded this time meant it must be a big deal.

Heaven pays off those who wait; finally, God had delivered the key to wealth and honor into his hands. However, if nothing was found in the end, he wouldn't even be able to continue running his small shop and would probably have to serve Fu Bu'er for the rest of his life.

Thinking of this, his body trembled involuntarily.

Yang Cao rang the bell: "Get a stenographer over here!"

Her assistant nodded to leave, and she added, "Bring tea." As she spoke, she looked at Gou Buli again. "Do you smoke?"

"A... a little."

Yang Cao took a cigarette from the box on the table and threw it to him. "Speak slowly, and be more detailed."

"Explain the situation at that time specifically again. Report every detail truthfully." Upon hearing this, Gou Buli immediately perked up: There's hope! This wasn't the usual official standard answer like "We will pay attention" or "We will investigate further."

"You know, I run a small restaurant and act as a trustee for the police bureau," Gou Buli said. "There is a prostitute named Xin Nachun who often comes to my shop..."

Speaking of this, he became a little apprehensive because every time Xin Nachun came, it was to conduct illegal gold and silver exchange business.

Private exchange of gold and silver meant at least a month in a labor camp if caught. If the amount reached a certain level, one would be exiled to Tiandu or Taiwan to "work until death."

He had hesitated for half the night last night before reporting it precisely because he was worried about this matter.

But now it seemed that the matter was urgent. If he could make a great contribution, the Chiefs would not haggle over these things.

Fortunately, Yang Cao did not ask why she frequented his shop. He felt slightly relieved and continued:

"A few days ago, Xin Nachun asked me some things about the school and asked about the current situation of my cousins. I thought she was just curious, so I told her what my cousins usually saw and heard. They studied at Fangcaodi for two years, but they were older and their studies were average, so they were assigned jobs after finishing junior primary school."

He took a drag on his cigarette here. "She, she asked me if their uniforms were still there?"

"Uniforms?!"

"Yes, uniforms." Gou Buli realized this news was very useful and quickly said, "I said the uniforms were still there. Then she suddenly asked me if I could sell the uniforms to her."

"Interesting," Yang Cao looked thoughtful. "Then what did you say?"

"At first, I thought she was joking. What use are old uniforms? I didn't pay attention. But later she pestered me about it three or four times, saying that many local rich tycoons who immigrated from the mainland wanted to try the taste of Australian students and were willing to offer a price of three hundred circulation notes."

*So rich!* Yang Cao thought. *Three hundred circulation notes for a set of old clothes! This woman's ulterior motives are obvious!*

"Did you agree to her?"

"How could I? What she did is simply disgraceful. I didn't expect, I didn't expect..."

Speaking of this, he suddenly couldn't continue.

It turned out that Xin Nachun turned around and threatened to report him to the police for "private exchange of gold and silver": In the past few months, Xin Nachun had exchanged over a hundred taels of silver and more than ten taels of gold at his place—such a large amount was enough for him to spend the rest of his life in a labor camp.

"Go on. What leverage does she have on you? Say it earlier, and you'll be treated with leniency."

"Yes, yes." Gou Buli was sweating profusely. He roughly described Xin Nachun's frequent visits to exchange gold and silver these days, and then continued, "I was forced and had no choice but to get three sets of uniforms and sell them to her."

Yang Cao nodded. "How much did you sell them for?"

"Five... five hundred... a set..." Gou Buli stammered.

"You made a good deal."

"No, no, I dare not... I, I just felt it was too... too suspicious..." Gou Buli turned pale with fright.

Yang Cao thought, *This matter is indeed too suspicious. Why did this prostitute want to buy uniforms? What does she want to do? Is it really for John does to try the so-called "Australian flavor"? In that case, one set would be enough—this obviously doesn't make sense.*

"What do the uniforms look like?"

"Just, just the uniforms of female students at Fangcaodi... nothing special..."

"Where is she now?"

"I'm not sure, probably in the hostel where she lives, or doing business."

"Your information is very important." Yang Cao said, "Go back first and do business as usual. Understand? Just like usual. Report any situation in time. I will arrange a contact person outside your shop."

"I understand."

"About today's matter..."

"Don't worry, I know how to keep secrets." Gou Buli knew that he must have provided crucial intelligence and felt much better. "I am also a trustee of the police bureau."

"It's good that you know."

She rang the bell and said to the assistant who came in, "Take him out."

Yang Cao then sent for Liu Fuqing and told him the news she had just obtained.

"Although I don't know if it's related to the Sun Umbrella Special Case, at this critical juncture, someone wants to get uniforms..."

Liu Fuqing interrupted her: "This is indeed very suspicious. I'll arrange for someone to check Xin Nachun's situation immediately! Find out where the uniforms went."

"Let's split up, the faster the better!" Yang Cao said, "Don't forget today is the first day of the Cultural Festival! Many students from Fangcaodi are going to the gymnasium to observe!"

Liu Fuqing went to the archives room. Since Xin Nachun was a "Non-National," she definitely had a special file in the Political Security Bureau. Whether it was the Customs Management Office of the Civil Affairs People's Committee, which managed Yellow Ticket prostitutes, or the Public Security Division of the National Police, responsible for the daily supervision and management of prostitutes, any material generated about her would be copied to the Political Security Bureau.

He retrieved Xin Nachun's file. Browsing through it hastily, he was soon startled: More than a month ago, Xin Nachun had been sentenced to whipping for "illegal solicitation"—this was nothing unusual, but on the relevant legal documents of this small case, Li Yongxun's signature appeared!
