# Chapter 37 - Saving the Ticket (Major Revision)

Chapter 37 Saving the Ticket (Major Revision)

(Note: "Piao" usually means ticket or kidnapping victim. Here it refers to the kidnapped victim - President Wen. "Saving the ticket" means rescuing the hostage.)

The plan to rescue President Wen was formulated by Bei Wei and Ran Yao.

They conducted detailed reconnaissance on the "Xuanzhu" flower boat.

"There are about ten bandits on the boat." Ran Yao pointed to the map drawn by Wen Tong, "They are equipped with knives and spears, and maybe a few fowling pieces."

"The terrain is open, not easy to approach." Bei Wei analyzed, "We must use sniping tactics."

"Sniping?"

"Yes. We set up sniper points at long range to eliminate the sentries and leaders on the boat first, then the assault team rushes up to save people."

"But, do we have sniper rifles?"

"We have the 'Type 88 Sniper Rifle' (actually a modified civilian hunting rifle) brought from modern times." Bei Wei smiled, "Although the accuracy is not as good as military ones, it is enough to deal with these bandits."

On the day of the action.

Bei Wei and Lin Shenhe (a shooting enthusiast) lay in ambush in a restaurant by the river. They set up sniper rifles and aimed at the flower boat.

Ran Yao led the assault team to lie in ambush on a small boat nearby.

Xiao Zishan led the support team to wait on the shore.

"Action starts!"

"Bang!"

A crisp gunshot rang out. A sentry on the flower boat fell headlong into the water.

"Enemy attack!" The bandits on the boat were in a mess.

"Bang! Bang!"

Gunshots rang out continuously. The bandits fell one by one. They didn't even know where the enemies were.

"Rush up!"

Ran Yao waved his hand, and the assault team rowed the small boat quickly closer to the flower boat.

They threw a few flash bangs onto the deck.

"Bang!" A white light flashed, and the bandits screamed, covering their eyes.

The assault team members rushed onto the deck like tigers descending from the mountain. They held shotguns and fired at the bandits.

"Don't kill me! Hero spare my life!" The bandits knelt down and begged for mercy.

Ran Yao rushed into the cabin and found Wen Desi.

"President Wen, we are late!"

"Good brothers!" Wen Desi had tears in his eyes.

The whole rescue process took less than five minutes. The Transmigrators achieved a complete victory with zero casualties.

This operation shocked the entire underworld of Guangzhou.

Everyone knew that the Australians had a mysterious and terrifying force that could kill people invisible from a thousand miles away.

From then on, no one dared to have ideas about the Australians easily.
