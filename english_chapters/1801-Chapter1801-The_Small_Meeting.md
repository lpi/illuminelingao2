# Chapter 1801 - The Small Meeting

Shen Changxi bowed to the circle of people and explained leisurely, "Everyone! Master Gao entrusted my humble shop to appraise the fineness of the Australian silver dollars. This really shows regard for my shop's meager past reputation! Since my shop's ancestors appraised the Franks' Cross Silver Coins over fifty years ago, no such work has been done in this Guangzhou area for nearly a sixty-year cycle."

Most of the people seated were from families that had been in business for several generations. A few had been mere striplings following their elders when the Cross Silver Coins were appraised, and they still had some impression of it. Hearing this "Shen Gongbao" speak of the past, they nodded slightly, recalling the eventful years gone by.

However, it was really inappropriate for a junior to speak of the past from nearly sixty years ago in front of a group of uncles and grandfathers. After establishing his own "authority," "Shen Gongbao" stopped talking and suddenly pointed his finger. With a *swish*, he gathered everyone's gaze together again.

"Regarding the fineness, I am a bit unsure. After all, it is dark and we only rely on two Australian oil lamps; it is still not as good as the sun in the sky. Moreover, although this oil lamp is bright, the flame color is still a bit yellowish. If we are to assay the gold and check the color today, I can only invite everyone to come again tomorrow."

Leaving some leeway in speech was the virtue of the silver smelting trade. Everyone was too lazy to say anything, just holding their own airs and waiting for "Shen Gongbao's" next words.

"However, this treasury fine silver is also called snowflake silver, meaning its color is pure white like snow. If the fineness is low, there will be absolutely no snow-white color. In my humble opinion, just looking at the color, the fineness of this Australian silver money is only slightly inferior to the treasury fine silver. However, after melting it down and looking again, there are differences." After speaking, Manager Little Shen looked at Manager Old Shen. Manager Shen just stroked his beard, closed his eyes and nodded slightly, saying nothing. Little Shen felt greatly reassured.

"The official treasury silver has a sufficient fineness of nine-three and a bit. This Australian silver, in my humble opinion, should be eighty-seven-five," Manager Little Shen concluded unhurriedly after enjoying the attention of the crowd.

The merchants sitting together immediately caused a stir.

The merchants gathered in Jufeng Bank were all top-tier big merchants in Guangzhou city. Many were directors of the General Chamber of Commerce or heads of various trade guilds. They were basically the leaders of their industries and had immense influence. They also held pivotal positions in the newly established Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce.

Today, Liu Xiang held a special meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce at the City Hall. The content was that the Senate was about to issue new currency in Guangdong, and the Guangzhou Special Municipality was the first. Therefore, the meeting was specifically convened to "instruct" the heads of various industries to cooperate and ensure the smooth circulation of money.

Merchants were all sharp characters. Upon hearing "instruct," they knew it was an order with absolutely no room for negotiation. In other words, the hustle and bustle the Australians had made in Guangzhou city over the past three months was all just a warm-up; the real finale was here.

Although ancient China did not have systematic financial theories, merchants had often learned about this without a teacher ever since Sang Hongyang of the Han Dynasty. Because while many imperial monetary policies went bankrupt, there were also many who extracted huge profits from them. The merchants knew something about the circulation note system the Australians had implemented in Hainan—many had already come into contact with this "Australian" paper money due to trade with Lingao.

Now that the Australians had arrived in Guangzhou, the merchants were somewhat mentally prepared for the promotion of new currency in Guangzhou. To be honest, the merchants were not extremely resistant to the circulation notes, because this paper money circulated well on Hainan Island, and the Australian government acknowledged it—compared to the Great Ming Treasure Notes which were "only allowed for me to use as money, not allowed for you to use as money," this was very conscientious.

However, the negative impression left by the Great Ming Treasure Notes on the merchants was simply too deep. At the thought that the Australians might fully circulate paper money, the merchants' hearts beat like drums. Many had already hidden away their silver ingots with the best fineness, in preparation for the Australians using the Great Ming's old trick: forcing merchants and commoners to exchange silver for banknotes.

However, the meeting did not mention exchanging silver for paper money. The new currency was still silver, only it had turned into silver dollars.

Merchants had seen silver dollars long ago. When the Franks came to Guangdong for trade decades ago, what they unloaded from their ships were these shiny round silver cakes. Later, the Red Hairs also brought silver dollars. Because of their good fineness, this foreign silver was very popular among merchants. However, merchants rarely used them directly. They either cut them up to weigh and use or simply melted them down to cast silver ingots.

Although merchants who had been overseas said that in many places overseas, this round foreign silver was used directly for circulation, no one did this in the Great Ming. Firstly, they didn't trust the fineness of the silver. In the early years, the foreign silver that came had sufficient fineness and weight, but later as more came, many silver cakes varied in size, and their fineness and weight also differed. In the end, it was more reassuring to cut them up and weigh them for use.

The silver dollars the Australians brought out were completely different from those brought by the Franks and Red Hairs. Although the size and weight were not much different, the level of exquisiteness was very "Australian"—as exquisite as the "Australian goods" they sold. Everyone who held one in their hands couldn't help but play with it for a long time.

Not only was the color silvery white and shining, but that nearly perfect round shape and the patterns detailed to the finest hair made everyone who held it feel that this was not money, but a piece of exquisite artwork. Compared to any kind of silver dollar or silver ingot they had seen before, it was a difference between clouds and mud.

However, no matter how good-looking the silver money was, one still had to check the fineness. The merchants gathered in Jufeng Bank just to see how the fineness of this Australian silver dollar was.

"Since the fineness is so, what about the weight?" Gao Ju asked.

"Each coin weighs six mace, seven candareens, and six li," Manager Little Shen said. "Every coin is like this, not a hair's difference."

"This is Australian money, it's not surprising," someone laughed. "What about the half-dollar and the twenty-cent coins?"

"These two types of small silver dollars have much worse fineness," Manager Little Shen said. "The look is sixty percent."

The seated merchants stirred slightly. Once this was said, a few shopkeepers and owners attending the meeting couldn't hold back and started whispering to each other, making the scene noisy for a while. Obviously, the fineness of the three types of silver dollars the Australians prepared to issue was not very good. Except for the one-dollar coin, the fineness of the other two was lower than they estimated. Just looking from the outside, the fineness of the three types of silver dollars seemed to be not much different.

Boss Zhu huffed and said, "These Australians haven't been in the city for many days, but their art of accumulation is quite pure!"

Lowering the fineness was a traditional art of accumulation in minting. The various Chongzhen Tongbao coins that were flooding the market now were like this. Not to mention the various privately minted small and mixed coins.

"You can't say that either." Shopkeeper Ding of the grain trade said, " If the Australians wanted to accumulate wealth, why would they need to mint silver dollars? They could just bring out those circulation notes for use—wouldn't it be easy to behead those who don't accept them?"

Because Shopkeeper Ding's grain trade had benefited from the Australians' banning of brokers, his words inevitably had a bias. But these words were reasonable. The Australians issuing silver coins, no matter the fineness, were still silver after all. Speaking of poor fineness, the various broken silver pieces they received every day had even more varied fineness. Just checking the color and weighing them every day took a lot of effort.

Master Gao had not spoken while they were discussing fineness. At this moment, he asked slowly again, "Old Shen! Are the sample coins everyone gave you all the same in fineness and weight?"

The merchants attending this meeting had each received a set of "sample coins." The ones brought to Shopkeeper Shen for assaying were exactly three silver coins from one of the sets.

Shopkeeper Shen nodded: "In reply to Master Gao, this money is really unique. I have been learning business in this shop with my grandfather and father since I was little. I have handled a lot of gold, silver, and copper coins, but I have never seen such uniform money. Put on the scale, there is not a hair's difference between each coin."

Everyone was an old hand in the market, so they naturally knew the benefits of uniform fineness and weight in money.

"What's the use of uniform fineness and weight?" Boss Zhu spoke again. " once this silver money hits the market, naturally someone will clip the edges and grind the faces. Just look at the copper coins on the market, which one isn't like this? When the time comes, one still has to check the color and weigh it before using it."

Shopkeeper Shen said: "This is different—copper coins are just small money after all. If a little is ground off, the value is negligible, and people won't argue with you over it. This silver dollar is over six mace of silver. If you grind off a few candareens, will the person receiving it let it go? This Australian silver dollar is not like the Cross Foreign Silver. Just take this milled edge and the double-sided pattern; as long as a little bit is ground off, there will be traces. Who would still be willing to accept it?"

Everyone argued about this again, the scene like fresh water just beginning to boil for a time.

Gao Ju suddenly spoke: "I'm afraid Shopkeeper Shen makes sense."

As the wealthy merchant with the most weight in his words in Guangzhou Prefecture City currently, one sentence from Gao Ju quieted the scene down.

"In my opinion, the Australians promoting new currency is not something open for discussion; it is a done deal," Gao Ju said. "Whether this silver coin's fineness is good or bad, and whether it can circulate in the market, strictly speaking, is not up to us. Only when money can be spent and circulated can it be called a success."

"Master Gao, what you mean is..." The person asking was the head of the manure guild, surnamed Mi. His character was most fond of opportunistic trickery, and his reputation in Guangzhou Prefecture was extremely poor. But dominating the manure guild, this big killer weapon, no one dared not to give him face directly.

Actually, he wasn't called for this General Chamber of Commerce meeting, but he was well-informed. Hearing of this matter, he insisted on coming to "stick a foot in" this private small meeting.

"My meaning is, the Australians are now the Emperor in Guangzhou city. If they want you to be round, you have to be round; if they want you to be square, you have to be square. Fortunately, the exchange plan given this time is quite considerate. We are not losing out by taking out some silver to exchange for silver coins. The most important thing is not to sweep away the Australians' face."

Everyone understood his words. The brokers attacked the Chaozhou-Shantou Guild Hall to fight for broker licenses. They swept away the Australians' face, and now they have ended up with broken families and lost fortunes—this is a warning from the past.
