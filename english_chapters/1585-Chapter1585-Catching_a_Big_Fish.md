# Chapter 1585 - Catching a Big Fish

In the black and white photo, the faces of the one man and two women were all photographed clearly. Zuo Yami even made a scissors hand gesture, with a smile that could be called "charming". Liu Fuqing couldn't quite get used to this "tune" liked by the Senators, but this was not the point. Monitoring Zuo Yami was originally casting a net blindly, not expecting to catch anything, but unexpectedly there was a fish in this net!

Now he had to see how big this fish was. Liu Fuqing stared at the indigenous man in the center: judging by his appearance, he should be a young master from a wealthy family. Although the black and white photo couldn't show the color of his clothes, from the rough texture, pattern, and the fan in his hand, it could be certain that he hadn't been here for long—these were all fashionable "Suzhou styles".

The so-called "Suzhou style" was the Suzhou model. At that time, this was synonymous with fashionable styles. There were two fashion centers in Great Ming in the 17th century: one was Beijing, and the other was Suzhou. Therefore, the External Intelligence Bureau would report the latest fashion trends of the two places to Lingao in the form of pictures, texts, and physical objects every six months.

Gathering this information was not a demand of the commercial department, although this information was quite helpful for them to study how to develop new products. The main purpose was to provide convincing cover for the dispatched intelligence officers of the External Intelligence Bureau, and secondly for the Political Security Bureau to judge the origin and approximate time period of suspicious personnel coming to Lingao.

Looking at this young man's appearance, he should be a newcomer to Lingao recently. If he were a wealthy young master local to Lingao, even if his clothing had not been changed to "Song style" and he maintained the Great Ming attire, he would not wear such "Suzhou style" clothes.

Just as Liu Fuqing was considering whether to query the materials of this young man, his assistant knocked on the door and came in: "Level I Commander, Director Wu is looking for you."

Liu Fuqing hurriedly tidied his clothes. Could it be that Director Wu wanted to inquire about the progress of the Umbrella Special Case? Thinking of this, he couldn't help but be secretly nervous: up to now, the only progress was this photo of unknown usefulness.

Although Chief Wu said "no time limit", the leader's patience was limited.

Wu Mu didn't waste words and directly handed him a file bag, instructing: "There is some new material here. Take it back and study it."

"Yes, Regional Command." Liu Fuqing was secretly puzzled. What new material?

"The new clues are related to the Cultural Festival." Wu Mu looked out the window, "Generally speaking, there isn't much juice. But there will be many Senators at the Cultural Festival. You have to check carefully and don't make mistakes."

"Understood, Chief." Liu Fuqing's heart skipped a beat: another clue involving the Cultural Festival! Could it be that suspicious rich young man?

He returned to the office and immediately opened the file bag. The material confirmed his guess, but there were more clues inside: The rich young master who came to the gymnasium with Lian Nishang and Zuo Yami had martial arts skills!

A rich young master, yet possessing martial arts skills, and interacting intimately with women in the Senate's police system—in Liu Fuqing's view, this was simply "colluding". The matter itself was already very suspicious.

He immediately called his assistant and handed the photo to him: "Find out this person's identity immediately. I want all his information and recent activities! Monitor him 24 hours a day after finding his whereabouts!"

"Yes, Level I Commander."

"And this Lian Nishang, go notify General Affairs Section 9 that we are going to start 24-hour surveillance on her."

After Liu Fuqing issued the order, he asked the secretary: "Is there any new news from Ke Yun?" Ke Yun was responsible for directly monitoring Li Yongxun herself. The answer was: "No new situation for now".

Liu Fuqing originally thought it would take 24 hours for new news to come. It took a lot of time to query a person's identity: checking with the archives department, visiting customs, police stations... Unexpectedly, less than an hour later, the assistant had already returned, holding a thick file bag in his hand.

"What?" Liu Fuqing was surprised, "Does this person have a case file?"

The assistant put the file bag on his desk: "This person is called Zhuo Yifan. Investigator Yang Cao is handling his case."

Bairen City, Senator Dormitory Area.

The sun gradually sank, and the clock pointed to seven o'clock.

This prefabricated housing residential area built shortly after D-Day was now almost uninhabited. Most dormitories had been demolished, and the materials were used for other purposes. Only a few dormitory buildings where Senators still lived remained, looking lonely.

Because this place was still under the jurisdiction of the General Office, there were still gate sentries and road lighting as usual, and the yard was cleaned regularly. Although it looked a bit deserted, it was not dilapidated.

Okamoto and Nan Gonghao strolled in this forgotten dormitory area. Recalling the eventful years back then, they couldn't help but feel a little emotional.

"I feel this place is a bit gloomy." Nan Gonghao looked around, "It used to be such a lively place..."

"Yeah, look, this used to be the female Senator dormitory area," Okamoto pointed to an empty foundation, "When it was hot, they didn't close the windows, and a few western horses walked around in bras and panties, even T-backs... It was so exciting..." He was immersed in beautiful memories as he spoke.

Nan Gonghao didn't pick up his words. He only remembered the days of road building. When he returned to the dormitory, he was so tired that he couldn't even speak, and he had to summon up the courage to take a shower.

Okamoto stopped: "This is it. No one lives in this dormitory building anymore. only he is still here. The reason is that it's close to work and he's not afraid of oversleeping... But I think he just likes to be alone."

Okamoto told Nan Gonghao beside him about the experience of invited by Dongfang Ke for dinner before the establishment of the Art Troupe. Now the two were standing outside Dongfang's dormitory door.

Earlier that day, the rehearsal of the folk music ensemble *Good News from Lingao Reaches Li Villages* was finally successful. Deputy Director Dongfang acted uncharacteristically and said he wanted to treat his colleagues to dinner to celebrate. However, the restaurants in East Gate Market were too noisy and the dishes were monotonous, and Nanhai Farm was too far. Considering the small number of people, he decided to cook and entertain them at his residence.

"Liu Shuixin said she would arrive later. There is a little difficulty in the rehearsal of the Checkered Skirt Club. Let's go up first." Nan Gonghao said. He didn't usually interact with people much, and it was the first time for him to go to a Senator's home for dinner.

The two pushed the door in and happened to run into two naturalized employees in uniforms coming out of Dongfang's room. The leader immediately spoke up and greeted:

"Hello Chiefs, you two came just in time. The shop just delivered the cognac ordered by Chief Dongfang! Wish you a pleasant meal!" After speaking, he bent his right arm and performed a very standard gentleman's salute before leaving.

"Oho, this Dongfang is very generous! I heard that this batch of brandy was just shipped from Goa last month!" Okamoto, who had been tired for several days, showed an excited expression. The two walked into this slightly cramped Senator dormitory. That antique piano had been moved to the Art Troupe rehearsal hall and replaced by a simple electronic keyboard. Therefore, a standard dining table was finally stuffed into Dongfang Ke's living room. Fresh fruits and a small wooden wine barrel just delivered were placed on the table, but the owner of the room was nowhere to be seen.

"You guys have really accurate timing! The lamb chops will be ready in 5 minutes!" Dongfang Ke's voice came from the kitchen next door.

The dormitory originally had no kitchen. Dongfang Ke privately occupied the room next door and converted it into a kitchen himself. Various kitchen utensils and tableware were slowly accumulated by him, either custom-made or bought from spoils of war. Everything was readily available inside. Except that the stove burned coal briquettes and the firepower was not enough, everything was perfect.

The two guests followed the sound into the kitchen, and a wave of heat and fragrance hit them in the face.

The oven emitted the aroma of roasted meat mixed with the unique smell of spices such as rosemary. The borscht on the stove also bubbled. Dongfang Ke, with his long hair tied behind his ears, tossed a cast iron wok with his left hand and held a small bottle in his right hand, sprinkling something into the pot.

"Menu: Rosemary Roasted Lamb Chops, Borscht, Pan-Fried Salmon, Corn Salad. Because time is limited, it's too late to make cake. Dessert is only cookies. You two go sit outside first. The wine just arrived. Cups are in the cupboard next to the stereo. Pour it yourselves." Dongfang said without looking back.

"We have salmon here?" Nan Gonghao wondered, "Didn't a Senator propose that the General Office supply it last time, but the General Office said this thing is a specialty of the Atlantic Ocean..."

"Salmon refers to Atlantic Salmon, of course we don't have it here. But Asia has Pacific Salmon. This is what Old Huang got from the Northeast, commonly known as Chum Salmon. The fish isn't worth much, the ice is valuable."

"Damn, it smells so good. Were you a cook before crossing?" Okamoto was already drooling.

"Just exceptionally picky about food..." Dongfang arranged the fish and side dishes on the plate and started stirring the soup pot again.

"If I knew earlier, I would have come to your place to mooch meals after rehearsal every day! This is simply a western restaurant!" Nan Gong was also very excited. He had been eating takeout bentos from the Senator Canteen in the rehearsal hall or studio for more than a week continuously.

"You think too much. Lamb chops and such have to be reserved with the supervisor of the canteen in advance. Fish has to be marinated in advance. As for that imported brandy, I only found it by chance when I went to No. 82 to order clothes from Minister Hong yesterday. Usually, you can only eat home-cooked food here. Besides, the rehearsal was so busy before, I haven't touched the kitchen for a long time."

When Dongfang placed the last dinner plate on the table, he took out three carved glass cups made in Europe from the cabinet. The PHS fixed at the corner of the table in the living room rang.

"Mn? Okay... So that's how it is, then you go ahead." Dongfang Ke put down the phone and looked at the two colleagues at the dining table, "You have to eat freely. Liu Shuixin said that because of temporary changes in the personnel composition of the Checkered Skirt dance program, the rehearsal has to be delayed for a while. To save time, she won't come to eat. Poor thing..."

"Then we can start eating?" Okamoto seemed unable to wait.

"Mn, let's start. For the Senatus!" Dongfang raised his glass and said the toast with a smile, then put down the glass and turned to turn on the speaker.
