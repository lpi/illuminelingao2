# Chapter 94 - Employment System (1)

Ye Yuming, having raised rabbits and poultry before, was assigned by Nanhai to manage small animals. Because the number of rabbits was still small, no dedicated cages were built for the time being, only a three-story rabbit tower was built in the yard. However, when taking care of the rabbits, he found the rabbits listless and not eating much. Could they be sick? As a result, he found such a passage in the agricultural materials in the Agricultural Technology Library: "Domestic rabbits have poor disease resistance. In humid and unclean environments, they are prone to contracting diseases and causing great losses, especially for young rabbits. Therefore, the management principle of dryness and cleanliness should be followed. Planning cages and environment should pay attention to dryness and cleanliness, and implement health and epidemic prevention management. In addition, rabbits are more cold-resistant but not heat-resistant. When the temperature exceeds 30℃, adult rabbits will reduce food intake or stop eating, does are prone to abortion, reduced milk production, or refusing to nurse kits, etc., and diseases will also become epidemic. Therefore, during hot periods, attention should be paid to heatstroke prevention and cooling."

Humid? Hot and stuffy? Rabbits? Then why did we bring rabbits to Hainan Island! There is even a pair of Angora rabbits! No choice, find a cool and ventilated place. Although this rabbit tower claimed to be under fruit trees, the fruit trees were still saplings. He had to move the rabbit cage out again, put it in an empty room, and sprinkled water around from time to time to cool down. Wu Nanhai was not responsible for rabbit feed. Fortunately, he had raised rabbits and had experience in cutting grass for rabbits. After harvesting vegetables, vegetable skins from the Food Office could also be fed to rabbits. By the way, when Nanhai's sweet potatoes are harvested, a large amount of sweet potato vines can be collected to feed rabbits—don't look at these guys being listless now, once they cheer up, their reproductive capacity is amazing.

The first few days were basically basic ground clearing work. The bulldozers of the engineering team removed stones, tree roots, and weeds, and transported a large amount of waste slag soil excavated from engineering projects, deepening the soil layer. Such fields were still quite raw and could only be used to grow sweet potatoes. As for hybrid rice, to be safe, it was better to leave it until next spring to plant. He had to see to what extent the local winter temperature would drop. Wu Nanhai also planned to plant some winter wheat and barley—barley likes cool climates, can withstand certain low temperatures, and has a short maturation time, which can snatch the planting gap of main crops.

Doing farm work is extremely hard work. Leveling land, digging ditches, plowing, applying base fertilizer. Although machinery can be used, there is no less manual work. Surprisingly many people applied to come to the Agricultural Committee. Many people regarded going to the Agricultural Committee as the idyllic life in their fantasy. Shortly after starting farming, some people complained of being tired or used the excuse that their major didn't match, and changed to other groups. Wu Nanhai himself also felt unable to bear it. He felt it was better for him to be an agricultural technician for guidance, and it was better to find farmers to do the work as soon as possible. The farmers allocated from Wu De worked very hard.

After more than a month of adjustment, Wu De's labor team was already very efficient. He used five people who had contradictions with each other as team leaders, intentionally encouraging competition among them. This personal grudge between leaders worked better than any intimidation. Every team leader drove his subordinates to work hard, fearing falling behind competitors.

Wu De also threw out material rewards at the right time. The team that completed the labor quota first every day could get extra food. He also adopted a "last place elimination" system. With every seven days as a cycle, the team with the lowest completion of labor quota in seven days would have four people reduced and distributed to the top four teams. If all members of a certain team were transferred away, the team leader would be demoted to ordinary laborer, canceling all benefits.

Wu De's measure was to see how much art of controlling people these team leaders had. This measure would intensify the fierce competition. If they didn't have the ability to win people's hearts and manage reasonably, team leaders who only relied on violence such as sticks and starving to force laborers to work hard could only achieve their goals temporarily, but it wouldn't work for a long time. Moreover, the oppressed laborers also saw the means to counter the team leaders—as long as they slackened off, after four cycles of seven days, the high-ranking team leader would fall. Both sides must reach a balance to cooperate effectively.

Obviously, Fu Youdi seemed extremely unadaptable in such competition. He was the earliest to become a captive team leader. At that time, he began to lord it over others, not working himself, just blindly fishing for his own benefits. Later, all four of his subordinates became team leaders. He was extremely unbalanced. To keep his face as the "oldest team leader" in front of Wu De, he intensified the oppression of his subordinates to work, and even raised two or three thugs by deducting everyone's food, establishing a tyrannical small kingdom. Almost no day passed without someone being beaten in his camp. The result was that he was hated more and more in his own team, and this person was still unaware.

Wang Tian was relatively honest. Although he also ate more and occupied more benefits himself, he did not oppress his subordinates. When working, he took the lead in working hard. Everyone thought he was a good person, but some people inevitably slackened off. Wang Tian was always cowardly and unwilling to manage much at first. Later, when he found his labor quota slowly dropping, he became anxious and beat people. When the quota went up, he started repeating this cycle again.

The other two were roughly at the level between Fu Youdi and Wang Tian. In comparison, Lin Xing's performance made Wu De look at him with new eyes. He divided his subordinates into several small groups, dividing labor and cooperating according to different work contents every day. Moreover, he set an example himself, eating, living, and working together with everyone. He never infringed on what others deserved. Even the reward food he got himself, he would share with his subordinates to eat together. But if someone slackened off, he would definitely not spare them lightly. Truly clear rewards and punishments. The whole team was convinced by him. Even some small landlords and rich peasants in the team in the past admired him very much. Some landlords privately invited him to be the head of long-term laborers in their own families in the future.

There are indeed heroes among the people. Wu De thought to himself. Unlike modern people who can access various information everywhere, where did a poor tenant farmer like Lin Xing, who was illiterate, learn this set? Could it be that there are people born with such leadership qualities in this world?

Wu De also slowly improved the food treatment of laborers. Now they could eat one dry meal and one thin meal every day. Of course, local miscellaneous grains were mixed into the dry rice. But for the laborers, it was already quite good. Some team leaders still deducted food as usual. He pretended not to know intentionally. So the ordinary laboring masses became more dissatisfied with their own team leaders, feeling that the pirates were relatively conscientious instead.

After more than half a month of this, Fu Youdi's team was on the verge of collapse. After being at the bottom for two consecutive weeks and having eight people transferred away, the flustered and exasperated Fu Youdi announced stopping food for a day in the team as punishment. The laborers who had long been oppressed miserably by him couldn't bear it anymore, swarmed up and surrounded him, punching and kicking. Even the few lackeys he raised were not spared, beaten black and blue.

The other teams were stunned by this sudden change. Wu De had a plan for such a situation long ago. He instructed the sentries of the captive camp that there was no need to enter the field to quell the riot when encountering such a situation, just control the periphery to prevent anyone from escaping in the chaos. He originally intended to wait for them to calm down naturally before going in to clean up the situation, but didn't expect Lin Xing to spontaneously lead people in to quell the riot.

Seeing Wu De coming, Fu Youdi's subordinates knelt at his feet one after another, scrambling to accuse this person of various crimes: some he knew, some greatly exceeded his expectations, making him fully understand that no one should think of being God—Fu Youdi had actually been secretly hoarding the steel tools issued to captives for work. The captives discovered very early that the tools issued by the "Chiefs" were much better than the crude iron farm tools they had used. Not only light and durable, but also maintaining good condition with almost no sharpening. Fu Youdi started calculating—Lingao was very short of iron products locally. Iron farm tools and products were all trafficked from the mainland. These particularly easy-to-use tools should be able to sell for a good price. He found that although registration and counting were done when collecting, because labor was required every day, it was impossible to collect when going to work and return when getting off work every day. Usually, they were piled in a shack. He secretly hid one every few days. Under the exposure of the masses, the black and blue Fu Youdi had to take Wu De to the place where he hid things, handing over more than ten shovels, spades, steel drills, and other things hidden in the grass by the river.

Looking at this pile of things, the transmigrators present were speechless. Are they really smarter than the so-called "natives"? At this moment, seeing a captive able to steal things one after another under their noses and hide them, probably no one dared to say so.

Unexpectedly, Fu Youdi, a person who was cowardly and couldn't speak fluently two months ago, actually degenerated into this in the end—seeing the angry accusations of the captives one by one, Wu De became more convinced of this point: Human nature in the 17th century and the 21st century is no different.

However, Fu Youdi's matter exposed many problems he hadn't thought of: none of the laborers came to report Fu Youdi's problems, but dared to be angry but not dared to speak, until finally unbearable, they exploded together, coming to a Chinese-style ending. It seems that his captive management policy also has inappropriate places.

I focused too much on creating internal conflicts. Wu De knocked his forehead a bit annoyed, only thinking about making them disunited and unable to unite to resist. Didn't expect that the prison bullies created actually controlled the subordinates strictly. Even the people he inserted inside who expressed willingness to join didn't provide him with any informing materials because of fear. Fortunately, Fu Youdi was just a small money-grubber. Otherwise, if he really hid tools and suddenly rioted, there would probably be casualties. Mutual restraint between people was not realized at all.

In the final analysis, my starting point was deviated. Wu De reflected on himself. He was still following some old experiences of the past. Although successful in managing personnel and brainwashing, the purpose of these practices was only to manage people well-behaved, not making trouble, just obediently working. It was not enough to bring into play people's subjective initiative. What they needed were local allies. The future transmigration building must be built on these cornerstones. Always dealing with them in a way of surveillance, control, and squeezing cannot gain the loyalty of these people.
