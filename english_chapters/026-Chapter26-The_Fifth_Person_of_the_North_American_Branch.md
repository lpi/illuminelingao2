# Chapter 26: The Fifth Person of the North American Branch

Shi Niaoren returned to America the next day. As for which weapons to purchase—with too many opinions and no decision—the North American contingent said to wait for their update before acting. After all, weapons shouldn't be stored too long; purchasing a few months before departure would be fine.

For the Executive Committee, the current discussions were unsatisfying. Many felt something stuck in their throats, though they couldn't say what. Every proposal somehow failed to match their vision. When discussing military weapons, though no one had actually used them, many knew enough to hold forth at length. But civilian versions were a complete blank for urban shut-ins. They had no theoretical foundation to discuss—essentially stumbling in the dark.

Jiang Ye spent these days lobbying the Committee members and Xi Yazhou, pushing his all-in-one weapons plan: semi-automatic rifles plus bolt-action Mosin-Nagants. Director Wen was tempted; he even looked up information on the Type 38 Arisaka—that thing with a bayonet could form a magnificent pike formation. Alas, the Athletics Group had no interest in continuing revolutionary traditions by working the bolt. His efforts among the masses also garnered little support—people wanted weapons that could "spray." Whether automatic rifle or submachine gun didn't matter, but bolt-action was absolutely rejected—it gave no sense of security.

Unexpectedly, a few days later, they received an overseas call from Dr. Shi. Another person had joined the North American contingent and was about to return to discuss weapons. This one, he said, had fired even more kinds of guns than Xiao Rui, knew the North American civilian weapons market like the back of his hand, and had "fired artillery on the ground and flown mares in the sky" (Mustangs). His exploits commanded respect. Most assumed the arrival would be a muscular, burly MAN.

What they saw when they picked him up at the base was an elegant young man, slightly slick in appearance. Everyone was somewhat disappointed, and began to doubt whether Dr. Shi's words were reliable.

The newcomer introduced himself as Lin Shenhe, a firearms enthusiast. Thanks to the decadent, backward U.S.A., he had spent years in America, handling countless famous and obscure firearms, even participating in building a Nordenfelt machine gun and a Napoleonic 12-pounder bronze cannon. The military buffs around him drooled. After hearing the Committee's firearms briefing, he smiled leisurely, mystifying everyone.

Xiao Zishan, seeing that smile, was reminded of Tang Guoqiang playing Zhuge Liang on TV. Unfortunately, no one was there to ask: "Why does the strategist smile?"

"You all don't understand the North American civilian weapons market, do you?" Lin Shenhe's voice was soft but perfectly clear. "Civilian weapons are actually very different from military ones, and performance varies by manufacturer." He paused and continued: "Take the AR-15—everyone knows it's the civilian version of the M-16, a semi-automatic. Actually, the various big and small profiteers making civilian goods in America are very cunning; they're nothing like what American GIs carry. AR-15 barrels—leaving aside competition-grade precision barrels—even the regular ones often aren't even chrome-lined.

"Or take the M1A that Xi Yazhou recommended—the civilian version of the M-14 from the famous Springfield Armory. Many people love it. Actually, its receiver is investment-cast, unlike the forged receivers of military-contract M-14s. By contrast, Norinco's M-14s have forged receivers, just poor quality."

"So American profiteers use the U.S. military for advertising to sell shoddy goods to hardworking American masses?"

"It's not exactly shoddy. The North American civilian gun market is huge, with demand from all income levels. It's different from military contracts. So there are companies that simplify production for low prices, and those that make expensive premium products. Take civilian M-14s again—LRB Arms uses forged receivers and costs much more than Springfield. Basically, anyone at any income level can find what they consider the best value."

After Lin Shenhe's introduction, everyone realized how complex American civilian guns were. They looked at him with newfound respect.

"So what's your weapon recommendation?"

"Well, that depends on the Executive Committee's requirements. On semi-automatic rifle selection, I agree with Team Leader Xi—given our environment, semi-automatics are best. With 200 semi-auto rifles, we can handle any complex situation at the start."

"We have no objections. The problem is choosing which semi-automatic has become a puzzle."

"For good value, the SKS really is great. Retail is $400; M43 ammo in North America is very cheap—suitable for large-scale issue. And stock is plentiful; bulk purchases are easy to obtain."

"Didn't Xiao Rui say Mosin-Nagants are only $80 each? $400 buys five!" The bolt-action rifle faction persisted loyally. "And the ammo is even cheaper."

"Which of you has used a Mosin-Nagant?" Lin Shenhe wore his all-knowing smile. "Among bolt-actions, the Mosin has the hardest bolt to work—people say you need to kick it open with your foot. And bolt-action rifles require extensive practice to develop combat effectiveness."

"You could choose others... like the Lee-Enfield."

"That's possible. But in my view, bolt-action rifles would be fine as equipment for native troops later on. We transmigrators should be better equipped for confidence."

"I still oppose Warsaw Pact weapons." Xi Yazhou maintained his theory. "Service life is too poor."

"Oh, that's not entirely true. Warsaw Pact weapons do have poor-quality examples. It depends on where they're made. As far as I know: on the North American civilian market, AK-series rifles from Russia's IZMASH and similar factories all use cold-hammer-forged barrels with chrome-lined bores, rated for over 80,000 rounds. Among AR-15s, only the HK416 uses cold-hammer-forged barrels. Bulgarian Arsenal-produced AKs claim barrel life of 15,000 rounds or more—that's what the U.S. Arsenal distributor told me."

"Then let's bulk-buy AKs! We can convert them to full-auto!" The AK faction became triumphant.

"I tend to agree with Xi Yazhou—we should at least have some semi-autos chambered in full-power cartridges." Lin Shenhe unhurriedly complimented, "Considering combat needs, Team Leader Xi's thinking is quite comprehensive. It's not about range—it's that full-power rounds have some penetration against old-style buildings and are advantageous against enemies in brush. The transmigrators will need this capability in densely vegetated areas."

...

After Lin Shenhe's brainwashing, the starry-eyed Executive Committee finally settled on a hybrid solution:

A small number of Russian-made AK semi-automatics chambered in 7.62mm NATO—the Saiga-308—as dedicated weapons for military personnel.

SKS semi-automatics using M43 rounds as militia weapons for transmigrators. Though the SKS had minor performance drawbacks, its ammunition was very cheap—unlike the astonishingly expensive 7.62mm NATO. Economy was also a consideration.

Lin Shenhe's recommended SKS was the SKS-D variant, whose advantage was compatibility with AK magazines—no longer limited to its own 10-round internal magazine. Sustained firepower was greatly improved.

"As for handguns—the M9 is just for show. Better to choose Glock: cheap and plentiful; American police love them. Under $500."

Lin Shenhe pressed his advantage and changed the Committee's handgun choice to Glock. Though the M9 was handsome, Glock was equally stylish, so there was no opposition. However, the procurement ratio dropped from majority to minority. Automatic pistols would be issued only to specialized military personnel in limited numbers; most would use S&W revolvers. Revolvers were better suited to low-quality reloaded cartridges.

Lin Shenhe then made many more suggestions: purchasing large quantities of Russian 4× optical scopes—essential if rifles were to achieve their 400-meter-plus long-range capability. Also, a small number of high-magnification sniper scopes for designated marksmen.

"We should also purchase small quantities of various light weapons as blueprints for future reverse-engineering, or at least as reference material."

Throughout this discussion, the Athletics Group—except for Xi Yazhou—maintained complete silence. But after the meeting, several requested a trip to the shooting club to fire an M-14 and experience full-power ammunition.

"Fine, arrange it." Wen Desi glanced at Xiao Zishan. "If they have that 308 thing, have everyone in the Athletics Group fire it to get a feel."

Getting money to America became another puzzle. These 200 rifles alone cost $100,000. Converting at a bank was obviously out. Fortunately, Wen Desi had recently opened many companies to cover money flows, one with import-export rights. They shipped several kilograms of gold by container under the guise of exporting electronics.

"Do you really trust that Dr. Shi and Lin Shenhe?" Xiao Zishan once asked Wen Desi during an evening stroll on the parade ground.

"If I don't trust them, what choice do we have?" Director Wen countered. "Our weapons depend on them. There's no other way."

"True enough." Xiao Zishan fell silent.

"To be frank, our entire operation is built on mutual trust." Wen Desi took a deep breath. "If you and Engineer Wang hadn't trusted me, would you have gone through the wormhole with me? If these people didn't believe we had a wormhole, why would they be here? Even those who left—if we hadn't trusted their promise of secrecy..." His face went cold. "We should have..."

Xiao Zishan shuddered. "Choose your words carefully!"

"Mm." Director Wen nodded. "How's Xi Yazhou doing lately? Any bad morale?"

"No. Besides, his proposals weren't completely rejected. He and that Lin Shenhe even went drinking together—quite a crowd, very lively atmosphere. Lin Shenhe has a lot of practical experience. Quite talented."

"Mm. What about the others in the Athletics Group? Any opinions?"

"They think we're making mountains out of molehills, overcomplicating things." Xiao Zishan smiled ruefully. He had more and more family members under his General Affairs umbrella now; from their chatter, he could learn many people's thoughts. "In their view, having guns to use is good enough; everything else is nonsense. So they have no particular opinions on which guns."

"That's good. Everyone's mood needs to stay stable. Honestly, everything is wonderful now—I'm just worried about after we go over..." Director Wen left the thought unfinished.

"Hold a weapon in your hands, and the urge to kill arises."

"Exactly. Especially when everyone has guns..."

"We'll need a system for managing firearms and ammunition?"

"Yes, definitely. At least in the long run, definitely."

"But that's really a technical detail. Looking at the big picture, we need a complete political system. In other words, a political platform, code of conduct, that sort of thing." Xiao Zishan said.

"Mm. So we should have a complete framework... A constitution?"
