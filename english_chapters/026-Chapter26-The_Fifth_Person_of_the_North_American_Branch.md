Chapter 26 The Fifth Person of the North American Branch (Revised)

The arrival of the North American Branch brought not only materials and personnel, but also a "mystery".

Among the core members of the North American Branch, besides Li Meidu, Bai Yu, Qian Shui and He Ying, there was a fifth person.

His name was "Li Meidu" (Wait, Li Meidu is Sister Du). No, his name was "Zhao Manxiong".

Zhao Manxiong was a mysterious figure. He claimed to be a former intelligence officer of a certain country, proficient in espionage, assassination, interrogation and other special skills.

He looked ordinary, middle-aged, taciturn, and always wore a pair of sunglasses, making people unable to see his eyes.

When he first joined the North American Branch, everyone was somewhat wary of him. After all, his background was too sensitive.

"Why do you want to join us?" Sister Du asked him.

"Because I'm tired of the dark life." Zhao Manxiong said lightly, "I want to go to a place where no one knows me and live in the sun."

"Can we trust you?"

"Time will prove everything."

Zhao Manxiong proved his value with actions.

He helped the North American Branch establish a secure communication network to prevent information leakage.
He taught everyone anti-surveillance and anti-interrogation skills.
He also used his "special channels" to get some sensitive equipment, such as bugging devices, miniature cameras, lie detectors...

"This guy is a professional!" Qian Shui commented.

After arriving in China, Zhao Manxiong was appointed as the director of the Intelligence Bureau (preparatory).

He began to select and train intelligence personnel among the Transmigrators. His training methods were extremely cruel, even perverted.

"Intelligence work is dancing on the tip of a knife." He said to the trainees, "A little carelessness will lead to death without a burial place. So, you must be harder, colder and more ruthless than the enemy."

He taught the trainees how to disguise, how to pick locks, how to steal, how to track, how to kill...

"Remember, you are ghosts in the shadows. You have no names, no past, only tasks."

Under his training, a terrifying intelligence agency - the "Social Security Department" (later renamed the Political Security Bureau) began to take shape.

However, Zhao Manxiong's existence also aroused the vigilance of some people.

"This person is too dangerous." Ma Qianzhu said to Wen Desi in private, "He is like a double-edged sword. If used well, he can kill the enemy; if used poorly, he can hurt ourselves."

"I know." Wen Desi nodded, "But we need such a person. In the complex environment of the Ming Dynasty, we need a dark force to do dirty work for us."

"We just need to control him." Wen Desi said confidently, "As long as our goals are consistent, he will not betray us."

Zhao Manxiong seemed to know everyone's suspicions about him, but he didn't care.

He usually lived in seclusion, rarely communicating with others. Besides work, he liked to sit alone in a corner, smoking and dazing.

No one knew what he was thinking, nor what kind of secrets were hidden behind his sunglasses.

He was like a shadow, silently guarding this nascent group, and also silently observing everyone.
