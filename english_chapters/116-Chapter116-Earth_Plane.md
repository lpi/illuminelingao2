# Chapter 116 - Earth Plane

Of course, the transmigrators didn't have bugles, nor did they have "little devils" like buglers. Upon his order, Yuan Qiushi just fired another signal flare upwards, this time a red one. Seeing this, the assault detachment members immediately blew whistles. This time, the assault team went into battle. They were all burly men. Besides full-body riot gear, each person held an anti-riot steel shield and waved a 21st-century cold weapon in one hand—a steel imitation of the Ming Dynasty border army standard long knife ordered by Wen Desi from a sword website. Both the steel shield and the long knife were very heavy, so these people were all burly men over 180 cm tall and weighing nearly 100 kg. Rushing at the very front was You Laohu (Tiger You). This person was actually a bit old and not tall or fierce enough, but he repeatedly volunteered, saying he had countless experiences in street fights and was willing to be the vanguard to chop people, willing even if he died. Only then did he get into the vanguard team. He originally wanted to bring a giant Green Dragon Crescent Blade similar to those used in opera, but people around him objected—fearing he might chop people around him if he slipped.

The village braves and family guards in the stockade were already panicked and shaken by this earth-shaking explosion. Some close to the gate were either smashed bloody by soil clods and rubble or bleeding from mouths and ears due to the shock. Seeing such a group of strong men in black helmets and armor, with giant shields and long blades, assaulting through the smoke, they were scared out of their wits.

Some turned and fled: "Stockade broken, stockade broken, everyone run for your lives—"

You Laohu was not tall but ran extremely fast. He was the first to break into the gate, almost tripping. The ground was full of soil clods and rubble. He stepped on something soft, looked closely, and found it was a corpse, probably killed by the shock, with no wounds on the body but bleeding from the five orifices, looking very terrifying.

Originally prepared for a fierce hand-to-hand combat at the gate, the assault team rushed in and found no resistance at all. The overly powerful explosive pack blew down the enemy towers on both sides, incidentally burying dozens of village braves waiting in full battle array inside the enemy towers alive. The more than ten people who heard the alarm and gathered behind the gate preparing to fight were also injured by the shock wave and broken bricks and wood, leaving only a ground of dusty-faced corpses. There wasn't even a single living person. This group of masters who intended to chop and kill didn't know what to do for a moment.

Wu De had rushed in with the follow-up troops. Seeing no enemies to clear at the gate, he hurriedly ordered the assault team to charge towards the main gate of the Gou family residence at the crossroads. Other teams also rushed along the streets towards their respective key points to control. Wang Ruixiang led a team to climb the stockade wall. Two night patrols ran towards them. Seeing this group of strange-looking people, they were startled. Wang Ruixiang screamed strangely, preparing to grab his axe for hand-to-hand combat, but the rifles behind him already rang out. Two enemies fell off the wall on the spot.

"What's the rush!" He just cursed, but was pushed aside by the people behind. These guys just killed someone, their eyes red with excitement, howling and running forward wildly, firing guns indiscriminately along the way, stepping on broken lanterns twice when seeing them. Unfortunately, there were quite a few things piled on the wall top. The one leading ran fiercely, tripped over a piece of wood, and since the wall top was a bit narrow, he fell down straight.

The first casualty of the attack operation happened here. Several people hurriedly held the wall top and jumped down, carrying this unconscious brother to the gate to wait for treatment.

Wu De ordered people to shout constantly, and at the same time sent people to light a wooden tower, intending to intimidate the people in the stockade not to move recklessly, letting the panicked village braves disintegrate on their own. Various assault teams occupied intersections separately, quickly cutting off the connection between the periphery of the stockade and the Gou family residence itself. He raised a white flag at the crossroads and asked people to shout repeatedly in the local dialect, Minnan dialect, and Cantonese: "Those who surrender will be spared death." In a while, dozens of captives were taken in. After their weapons were collected, the captives were tied in groups of five and pulled out of the stockade.

Street fighting did not happen as expected. The gates of poor and small households in the stockade were tightly closed. Some people who poked their heads out to check got shot for nothing. Wu De heard the firing sound of Saiga-308 rifles in the distance and knew someone was jumping over the wall to escape, but he was confident that the main leaders in the stockade didn't have time to escape.

The assault team surrounded the entire residence. Inside the residence, Gou Xunyi and his trusted followers knew that this time was ominous. Relying on the high and thick walls and the solid house, they constantly sent people out to ask for help while firing muskets indiscriminately.

The residence faced streets on all four sides. There were one or two hundred women and children inside, and seventy or eighty men. As soon as anyone approached this residence, the Gou family people threw down bricks, tiles, and stones from high places like heavy rain, making it impossible for everyone to lift their heads. Relying on the high protection of the riot gear, the assault team members rushed directly under the wall, preparing to climb the wall with ladders. The women inside the residence boiled water and sent it to the roof slope bucket by bucket, pouring it down with bricks and stones. Immediately, several charging assault team members were scalded. Someone was unfortunately poured on the head. Although protected inside and out, the pain from the seeping hot water made him roll on the ground. Seeing the opponent hurting their brothers, the transmigrators, most of whom originally came to fight with a teasing heart of a cat catching a mouse and felt somewhat reluctant about killing, now instantly had killing intent, roaring angrily together:

"Kill, kill them all!" "Leave not even chickens or dogs!" "Flatten Gou Family Stockade!" Everyone here was red-faced. SKS rifles fired wildly, hitting the eaves so that rubble and wood chips flew, and blood splattered. People on the eaves fell down swaying. A woman carrying water up crawled on the eaves, retreating slowly, when suddenly a puff of blue smoke rose from her shoulder, and she fell down straight. This scene caused a burst of cheers.

Taking advantage of this gap, everyone hurriedly pulled the scalded people down. Fortunately, the protection was tight and not too serious. The heat capacity of boiling water was also small, so the most serious was only second-degree burns. The most miserable one mainly had a large scalded area but no life danger. However, the brother who fell from the wall remained unconscious. The health group's diagnosis of him was extremely pessimistic, likely a skull fracture. After simple treatment, they hurriedly sent a car to transport him back.

"Spread sand on the car, quick!" He Ma ordered. Spreading sand on the car was for shock absorption, considered a local method for emergency evacuation of wounded in wartime. He decided not to evacuate the scalded wounded for the time being. These people were in no danger of life, and the chance of infection after treatment was not high. But this wounded person was difficult to diagnose without medical equipment, and if surgery was needed, there were no conditions here.

The transmigrators' rifle volley suppressed the people lying on the eaves so they dared not show their heads, but the family guards behind the thick walls still constantly fired muskets, bows, and arrows through the shooting holes. The biggest threat to the transmigrators was the wall gun (gingall). The wall gun was much more powerful than fowling pieces and blunderbusses, loaded with many iron pellets, iron nails, and small stones the size of broad beans, like a super-large shotgun, hitting a large area. Although the rifles in the hands of the transmigrators were very powerful, they couldn't approach for a while, and the enemies mostly hid behind walls and eaves, difficult to observe.

"Let's blast again. There's still one explosive pack!" Although Zhang Berlin had scratches on his face, he still refused to leave the front line with light wounds—actually, his injury was far from fatal, just a bit of abrasion.

Wu De thought that charging and climbing the wall would probably still result in casualties. Just use the old method, continue to let the Gou family take the "earth plane" (get blown up). He nodded: "But remove half of the charge for me!"

"Got it, I'll do it right away."

This time, to guard against the Gou family repeating the trick of pouring boiling water, besides the full-body riot gear, he additionally wore a plastic raincoat. Zhang Berlin held the explosives and was about to rush out when Wu De grabbed him:

"You looking for death!" He said sternly.

"What's wrong?" Zhang Berlin looked innocent, "I'm guarding against them pouring boiling water—"

"You just want to be waterproof. This plastic raincoat, if given a torch—" He pointed, "You become a torch."

"I heard plastic burns are terrifying. Melted plastic will burn and stick to the skin—" Someone was still chiming in.

Hearing this, Zhang Berlin hurriedly took off the raincoat. Wu De ordered the assault group to transfer five people to cover him. Three steel shields were connected in front to form a curved surface, and two steel shields were placed on top, simply forming a "turtle formation," protecting Zhang Berlin to advance under the main gate.

"Watch out for the enemy's wall guns!" Wu De knew this thing was very powerful at close range, "This formation must not break at any time. Hold on. We will cover you with firepower."

Here the transmigrators organized continuous rifle fire. Some installed scopes on rifles and shot straight at the opponent's shooting holes. Zhang Berlin's demolition team slowly advanced all the way. Arrows fell crackling on the steel shields, scratching many white marks on the steel plates. Bricks and tiles hit the shields above like raindrops, banging loudly. There were observation ports on the shields, but no one was in the mood to look at the situation outside right now, just moving forward continuously. Whenever the SKS rifles outside rang, the sound hitting their shields would decrease a lot. At this time, the defenders lit a wall gun. The assault team members saw a red flash of fire, stopped moving, and braced themselves waiting. After the flash of fire, the wall gun rang immediately. A fierce smashing sound on the shields, worse than the densest hail. The thrust of the gunpowder also made them feel a shake.

However, this was already the enemy's death struggle. Although someone threw out lime bottles and ignited sulfur packs from behind the wall regardless of life and death at this time, it could no longer stop their steps. The sulfur packs were blocked by steel shields and slid to the ground. Lime had no effect on people with goggles. The turtle formation soon arrived under the gate tower and placed the explosive pack. They retreated quickly.

The people in the residence were somewhat confused. They originally thought the people rushing under the gate were either preparing to chop the gate or preparing to set fire, but neither was done. If they were preparing to blow up the gate, logically, to blow open this gate would require at least one or two hundred jin of gunpowder, and a pit had to be dug under the gate. What could they do by just coming and retreating like this?
