# Chapter 95: Employment System (Part 2)

Wu De held a mass meeting. Fu Youdi and his enforcers were fiercely denounced. All his problems were laid out for criticism; even scratching his feet before meals and snoring during sleep were exposed. Wu De let the masses widely participate, enhancing their sense of ownership. It was a so-called "organized rebellion"—fully satisfying their liberation euphoria while demonstrating his wisdom.

Fu Youdi was declared stripped of all positions; he and his enforcers would "undergo labor reform under mass supervision." But when the masses tried to beat him—some even suggested public beheading—Wu De stopped them. No matter what, Fu Youdi had served the transmigrators faithfully. His fate couldn't be too miserable—otherwise, who would defect in the future?

Next, two other captains' problems were exposed: skimming food and slacking off. Nervously, both stood up and knelt before Wu De to confess.

"Your problems are serious." Wu De put on a stern-magistrate face. "But your recent work achievements are obvious to all, so these issues won't be pursued."

"Thank you, Master, for your great magnanimity." Both wept with gratitude.

"Continue working well." After speaking, Wu De reorganized the entire prisoner labor team—now called the "Production Team." Captain: Lin Xing. Deputy captain: Wang Tian. Clerk: Zhang Xingjiao. Below them, there were still four production squads; each squad leader was elected by the workers. Wu De stipulated that all management positions must learn Mandarin—so the two criticized captains could resume duty, naturally much more restrained. Others mostly developed intentions to learn the "Chiefs'" language.

The new labor system used work points. Each person completing basic daily work received one point. Managers and skilled positions received 1.2 points base. Exceeding quotas added points proportionally. Especially arduous, dangerous, or difficult work received bonus points.

Wu De stood before a rough blackboard, using Lin Xing and Xiong Buyou to simultaneously translate, finally explaining what work points meant.

"What are work points for?" he said. "Work points can now exchange for extra food. They're like money—want more fish? Buy it with work points. Want more rice? Same." He paused. "In the future, you can use work points for more things—those farm tools, implements. If you have enough points, you can buy them..."

Someone timidly raised a hand—Ma Peng. "Can I buy rice and have my mother eat it?" Probably fearing Wu De would think he wanted to escape, he added, "I can bring my mother here to eat..."

Everyone laughed: "Are you crazy? What would the masters want with your old mother?"

"Of course you can." Wu De seized the opportunity to announce new policies. "This is money you earned—how you use it is your freedom. We'll introduce more purchasable items in the future."

People whispered and murmured below. Everyone was clearly interested in getting paid for work. Someone asked: "The meals we eat now—will we need to pay work points for them later?"

"No—I said before, for extra food." Wu De explained that meals continued at two per day, one dry and one thin.

"Chief Wu said before, good workers can become 'employees.' Do 'employees' also earn work points?"

"Yes." Wu De explained the difference. Employees' point income would exceed theirs—for the same work, they got 1 point, while employees got 1.2. Explaining decimals was difficult, and Xiong Buyou struggled mightily. Finally, he used two fruits: one fruit represented 1.0; another cut into ten pieces, with two pieces representing 0.2. This visual education finally clarified things.

Employees received three free meals (two dry, one thin), were provided housing, and might later receive private plots—conditions that made many envious. But the concern about employees being rebels made most pessimistic about this bright future.

Wu De understood their concerns, so didn't oversell. Excessive enthusiasm would backfire. Chinese peasants were most practical and most suspicious. Without tangible benefits, they wouldn't easily board your pirate ship.

Indeed, everyone was skeptical of the work-point system. Some thought it was fraud—paying prisoners for work? What world was this? But from then on, Zhang Xingjiao was responsible for daily work assignments and point recording. After one week—they now knew "Chiefs" used seven-day weeks—everyone received varying work-point vouchers: minimum 7 points, maximum 10-plus. Vouchers came in four denominations: 1 point, 1 *li*, 2 *li*, and 5 *li*.

Given that work-point vouchers were effectively disguised currency, the Planning Committee's economics specialists evaluated their issuance. Discussion concluded: no problem. Work-point vouchers were essentially grain-backed internal-circulation coupons—redeemable only at the two transmigrator cafeterias for food. Issuance and circulation were extremely limited. As long as transmigrators had sufficient grain, maintaining basic credit was unproblematic.

Moreover, work-point vouchers had negligible value: 1 point = 1 bowl dry rice (100g); 1 bowl porridge = 0.5 points (50g rice); 1 salted fish = 2 points.

Daily earnings could only marginally improve meals—negligible impact on transmigrator food reserves. As Wu Nanhai put it: "If after six months ashore we still can't even feed laborers, we might as well commit group suicide."

As a first currency-issuance attempt, the Planning Committee cautiously established a Finance Working Group, regulating voucher issuance, printing, circulation, and storage. The vouchers were lithographed in the Document Printing Office; the paper was imported card stock, roughly the size of a one-*jiao* RMB note. The 1-*li*, 2-*li*, and 5-*li* matched the old 1-*fen* RMB size. They used single-color black-ink printing without color registration. Front: the Committee Building's majestic form. Back: the *Fengcheng*'s silhouette. Border pattern: coconut palms. Only the denomination used different ink colors for distinction. Each voucher had a unique Arabic serial number.

Xi Yazhou volunteered to write "Crossing Central Bank" as the masthead, but Finance Group Leader Cheng Dong felt these were just crude tokens—like cafeteria meal tickets. There was currently no bank. Better to preserve their token-coupon nature; don't misuse "bank" terminology to avoid future complications.

The final "fancy paper" in Wu De's hands simply read "Work-Point Voucher"; the issuing unit was the "Bairren Production Team." Due to crude printing and unsuitable paper, they looked somewhat like shoddy cemetery spirit-money—but technically, no one in the Ming could replicate them.

They bore a beautiful ink seal in seal-script—on closer inspection, Wu De's personal name-seal. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry. What was this supposed to mean?

Cheng Dong said it made things official—made vouchers look dignified—essentially using Wu De as a credit guarantee. After all, those laborers didn't recognize any Committee.

"If there's nothing on it, wouldn't it become true wastepaper—Greater Japanese Empire military scrip?"

After printing, all vouchers went to the Finance Group. Weekly, Wu De personally claimed them against point-tally sheets. Since payroll was detailed work beyond Wu De's financial skills, he only submitted weekly tally sheets; Finance Group payroll specialists compiled wage tables and distributed vouchers accordingly.

For Production Team laborers, this was a novelty. Copper coins—everyone used them. Silver—they had seen. Gold—heard of. Sometimes cashless, they'd barter vegetables, chickens, or rough cloth for salt and goods. But paper buying things? First time hearing this.

The Ming had once issued paper money. But this government-promoted currency, under financially ignorant emperors and officials, had long since died. In this remote region, for many years only copper and silver circulated. Though there were bills of exchange like later bank drafts, ordinary commoners never touched them.

After receiving vouchers, everyone looked at each other—no one believed these could buy food. They thought: *if I rashly try exchanging—Chief Wu said it works, but if Cafeteria Chief Wu says no?* Even government offices often contradicted each other. Cafeteria Chief Wu did look fair-skinned and kindly—but presenting fancy paper to buy things might anger him. When gods fight, commoners suffer.

Finally, under everyone's urging—and with Lin Xing's guarantee that if Cafeteria Chief Wu tried hitting anyone, he'd fetch Chief Wu De—Ma Peng shakily presented a 5-*li* voucher to buy one bowl of porridge. The server readily accepted it and ladled him a bowl.

Onlookers saw Ma Peng receive porridge, watched him slurp it down, then noticed the server showed no intention of punishing Ma Peng. After a stunned pause, everyone surged forward, scrambling to pull out vouchers—buying rice, buying salted fish. The cafeteria's Hu Yicheng was caught off guard; extras quickly sold out. No one had expected this sudden purchasing frenzy—so extra provisions were minimal. Those who missed out stared at him. Surrounding them were loud chewing sounds and greedy eyes that seemed ready to swallow him too. He quickly phoned Wu Nanhai.
