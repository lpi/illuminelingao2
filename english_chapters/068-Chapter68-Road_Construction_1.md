Chapter 68 Road Construction (1)

...transferred from the Labor Force Group as raw hands. It doesn't matter if they have no skills, we can teach them - aren't migrant workers equally capable? But the problem is that they change a batch of people for us the next day - claiming it's for equalizing workload. Please, this isn't eating from a big pot (socialist egalitarianism). Can we practice egalitarianism like this? Damn, the previous batch hasn't been taught well yet, and a new batch comes. Isn't this tossing about blindly? Look, more than three hundred people came to the construction site in one breath today. How much work did they do?"

"It is so." Wang Luobin looked thoughtful. Indeed, most of the labor groups sent to the road construction site today had no work to do.

"Must form a specialized engineering team for infrastructure construction. Personnel must be fixed." Mei Wan said, "My request is not high, 50 people is enough. Physical work can be done by basic laborers."

Talking about the highway all the way, the two came to the temporary highway construction command post. In order to organize construction nearby, this place was about 2 kilometers away from the camp. Conditions were very simple, and no electricity was pulled. Just a tent.

Walking inside, the tent exposed to the sun for a day was hot and dry. Various drawing boards and surveying equipment were stuffed everywhere. Rolls of survey drawings were piled on a large table. Mei Wan took out the planning scheme.

The route was chosen on the east bank of the Wenlan River. The east bank had more development space than the west bank. In the future, it could be connected with Hongpai, Maniao and other ports to form an industrial base-port transportation integration. Several major industrial development zones in modern Lingao were also set on the west bank of the Wenlan River.

For Transmigrators coming to the 17th century, a complete road system is the foundation for reconstructing modern society. Modern roads are not only conducive to the circulation of materials and personnel, but also greatly increase the regime's control over society. Although China was one of the earliest countries to establish a national road traffic network, the scope and depth of road extension were still very insufficient. Taking Hainan as an example, in the Ming Dynasty, there was only one official round-island post road. There were no relatively complete main roads in each county. Only some small paths stepped out by people and cattle. Whether official roads or general main roads and small paths, there were almost no road surface hardening and drainage facilities. The saying "three feet of dust without rain, a body of mud with rain" applied equally to Ming Dynasty Hainan.

In comparison, Europe in the same era was not much better. The road conditions before 1600 were still very bad. The road building technology handed down from the Roman era had been lost. Potholes on the road surface were filled with bundles of brushwood, and even such low-strength, easily rotting materials were used as the roadbed for new roads. Modern road building ideas came from the Italian Torgletta (circa 1587). In an article, he mentioned some basic concepts of modern roads for the first time, such as roads must be above the groundwater level; drainage facilities are needed on both sides of the road; building a relatively solid roadbed with gravel, and paving a mixed road surface of crushed stone and mortar on top - he also pointed out that this kind of road surface requires long-term maintenance, but the cost is much cheaper than traditional Roman-style hard stone highways. Starting from the 17th century, European road building technology and road administration entered a stage of rapid development.

The Transmigrators' road planning was naturally ambitious. This planned highway had a straight-line distance of 8 kilometers and a total route length of 12-16 kilometers. It was constructed according to the Class B standard of military roads. The passage capacity of this grade of military road is less than 200 vehicles per day and night. The designed maximum speed for vehicle passage is 40 km/h. The entire roadbed width is 7 meters, the roadway width is 6 meters, two lanes.

"I have an opinion," Wang Luobin said, "Maybe I'm wrong. Are you investing too much energy in surveying now? Are you planning to get it done once and for all, building a permanent highway at one time? Is there a need for this now? Just build a temporary road first to get through, and modify it slowly later. The Executive Committee's idea is to open the road to Bailaren Beach as soon as possible. Doing it this way, let alone D+5, it won't be finished in a month, right?"

Mei Wan looked at the few people around him. Everyone was silent. Bing Feng had calculated the approximate workload and knew Wang Luobin was right. But here only Mei Wan and Zhuo Tianmin knew a little about road and bridge engineering. Mei Wan, as the leader of the Construction Group, was enthusiastic about his own plan, so everyone was embarrassed to mention the issue of the construction period.

Seeing the possibility of his plan being rejected, Mei Wan explained anxiously: "This kind of road is already a bit luxurious for us, but prepare for a rainy day, lay a good foundation first, which is also good for future expansion and reconstruction."

"Now at the beginning of the crossing, a thousand things wait to be done. What should be simple, what should be refined, although there is no objective and practical standard, as actual engineering responsible personnel, you don't have to start everything from a professional angle and insist on perfection. That is obviously impossible. Neither technology nor materials are very complete now. Blindly pursuing perfection is a bit like climbing a tree to catch fish." Wang Luobin said.

Zhuo Tianmin, who had been silent in the Construction Group, suddenly said: "I agree with Commissioner Wang's view. Road building can be very complex, considering the slope of the road, geological structure, construction volume, whether bridges are needed, whether tunnels are needed, designing construction plans based on investigation... But it can also be very simple. Especially now it is just building a temporary road temporarily. Just determine the start and end points of the road, the points that must be reached midway, and then choose a route based on the passing terrain to build a simple dirt road. According to on-the-spot investigation, the local terrain is not complex. Building a temporary road in such a place won't have big problems even without strict surveying."

Zhuo Tianmin's speech made Mei Wan's face turn ugly instantly. This man, who graduated with a bachelor's degree in mechatronics and had qualifications as a registered consultant and constructor, although he kept a low profile in the group because he signed up late and had to take care of his son, his professional ability was obvious to all. This made Mei Wan always a bit taboo.

He originally wanted to show his skills beautifully to the Executive Committee through this project, and also establish popularity among the masses - winning the people's favor by building high-quality public buildings is a very easy way to succeed.

But now, his idea was obviously not favored by Wang Luobin, and was refuted by Zhuo Tianmin on the spot, falling into an evaluation of "no overall view".

"There are hundreds of people on the beach now, and so many materials and machines. These things must go to Bailaren Beach as soon as possible! Our task now is to be able to arrive, not how to arrive. Don't put the cart before the horse." He stood up, "The requests you made, I will give you a full reply tonight. But the plan must be redone. By D+6, the convoy must arrive at Bailaren Beach!"

After the meeting, Mei Wan, like an eggplant hit by frost, reorganized and revised the plan according to Wang Luobin's request. The new highway belonged to a simple highway with a dirt surface. Such a road surface is only suitable for conditions where there are few passing vehicles and traffic can be stopped on rainy days. Considering that there won't be many vehicles passing on this highway, and it was after the Mid-Autumn Festival of the lunar calendar, the rainy season in Lingao had ended, so rain would not have a great impact on driving.

The next day, the road construction project finally entered the right track. Adhering to the guiding principle of "surveying, designing and constructing simultaneously", a temporarily formed road construction engineering team replaced the original noisy basic labor group that showed up but didn't put in effort.

Because they didn't have the hydrological data of the Wenlan River in the 17th century, they didn't know what its historical highest water level was. Therefore, when delineating the route, the standard for distance from the river bank was based on the once-in-a-century flood standard of the 20th century plus a 10% margin.

The roadbed adopted the fill type. This kind of roadbed is suitable for low and flat sections in plains and hilly areas. In order to reduce transportation links, it was decided to use roadside ditches for borrowing soil as much as possible, and borrow pits only as a supplement.

The construction team first measured the position of the sideline of the ditch outward from the roadbed edge stake according to the width of the highway ditch calculated based on the vehicle width. Generally, lime line marking or staking and rope pulling were used to set the sideline. Mei Wan was reluctant to use lime, so he changed to sprinkling plant ash to define the edge.

The soil dug out from the ditch, the superficial layer was paddy soil or other soil rich in humus. The construction team didn't want such soil. The best soil for building roadbeds is clay and sandy soil. These two kinds of soil were not lacking along the construction site and were convenient to use. Because the location was along the river, there was a lot of sandy soil, mixed with many pebbles and shells. Filling directly into the roadbed was unfavorable to the overall strength of the roadbed. Zhuo Tianmin, who was arranged to be responsible for soil borrowing, set up a sand and stone sieve for construction at the borrowing site to screen out stones and shells from the soil. Pebbles could be used as building materials. Shells, Mei Wan planned to use them to burn lime - but he only knew shells could be burned, but didn't know how to burn them.

The screened soil was used to fill the roadbed. The cross-section of the entire roadbed was stepped, paved with alternating layers of clay and sandy soil. Every 20 cm of soil filled, it was compacted twice with a road roller. This continued until the roadbed was filled to 1 meter. Then level the ditches on both sides where soil was taken to facilitate drainage, and the entire roadbed was roughly completed.

In comparison, the work on the road surface was more complex. The soil road surface required to be flat and dense, not loose when the weather was dry, with less dust when driving; and able to drain water quickly when it rained. These few engineering technicians had never done road and bridge engineering before. Mei Wan pulled an all-nighter to review all the textbooks and technical materials brought with him.
