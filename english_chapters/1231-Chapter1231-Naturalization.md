# Chapter 1231 - Naturalization

Over these years, Li Siya had been the brain while she was the arms. Together they'd made waves on the sea with rich harvests, accumulating considerable surplus each year. However, with an eye to the future, they had to save more. Of the profits from each voyage, Li Huamei would deposit part in a Jewish bank in Macau under Li Siya's name, and deliver the rest directly to the young miss.

Li Siya gave her 5% of each voyage's net profit. By the standards of the time, Li Siya's generosity was already quite remarkable: after all, Li Chun was ultimately just Li Siya's household slave. Running errands and generating income for her master was simply her duty—that the master would give any extra money was already gracious, and sharing profits was an extraordinary favor.

Though she had this dividend, aside from keeping some cash on hand, most of it stayed in the Macau bank—also managed by her milk-sister. Li Huamei hadn't previously cared much about money, always feeling that with the young miss handling finances, following her wouldn't lead her wrong.

But lately her mindset had subtly shifted: she used to feel she and her milk-sister were family, not separate at all. But as she grew older, especially when secretly mourning the passing of youth, she suddenly realized she actually had nothing—even *Hangzhou* was her sister's property.

She needed to think about herself a little. The young miss wouldn't be doing this business in Macau forever. When the young miss left, what would she do? Keep following her?

Li Chun had been troubled by such questions lately. She'd even considered using this opportunity to join the transmigrators to turn the play-acting real—completely breaking free of her milk-sister's control. Before, everyone around her had been Li family people, and the ship belonged to the Lis. This time, blind Danes had delivered a windfall of money and sailors.

The spoils from the ship robbery, the proceeds from the ship sale—after deducting all expenses and outlays—totaled about twelve thousand pesos. The profits from shipping goods for the Australians weren't included—that part couldn't count as piracy income.

By the rules, spoils from the *Griffin* capture were distributed 50% to the captain, 20% to the officers, with the rest split among the crew. She alone got six thousand pesos.

Beyond the six thousand pesos, she'd also obtained Captain Weisheuey's private stash from the *Griffin's* captain's cabin: a bag of gold coins, a small pouch full of Ceylonese rubies, emeralds, and crystal. Miss Chun, who'd always prided herself on being upright and honorable, this time unhesitatingly pocketed everything.

With this capital, getting a new ship wouldn't be hard—though every time she thought of this, she silently cursed herself for being cold and faithless. Yet the idea grew more and more stubborn...

Whatever the future held, for now she'd settle down here, Li Huamei thought—I suppose I've officially joined the transmigrators now.

The matter of Li Huamei's formal application to "join" had been sitting on the Civil Affairs People's Committee's desk for quite a while. The reason for saying it would take three months was mainly that Liu Muzhou currently found the Executive Committee and Senate's naturalized citizen policies rather unclear. This was a matter of national policy—without a clear directive, he felt he shouldn't make the decision himself.

To date, the Executive Committee hadn't established clear norms for how to define and manage naturalization. Generally speaking, anyone who came to settle in Lingao was considered an "immigrant." Whether organized immigration or spontaneous, after arriving in Lingao, they had to enter the quarantine camp for purification, then be assigned to various locations.

These people were all registered, then uniformly assigned to various communes. Combined with the population from villages across Hainan's counties that had already been incorporated into communes, with village consolidation and household division completed and basic grassroots organizations established, this formed the "directly-managed population" under Planning Commission control. A considerable proportion of this population were "indentured servants." The so-called "naturalized citizens" referred to this directly-managed population. The Senate recruited soldiers from the naturalized citizens, hired workers and students, and selected cadres.

Naturalized citizens were under very strict control. The Civil Affairs People's Committee, Police Headquarters, and Political Security Bureau had jointly established a rigorous household registration system prohibiting free migration. Any movement of permanent residents had to be accompanied by household transfer procedures. Detailed tables tracked every naturalized citizen's specific whereabouts and movements.

Other villages and towns not incorporated into communes—their populations paid taxes to the Senate and provided labor, but weren't statistically counted as naturalized citizens. Currently the Civil Affairs People's Committee had only completed preliminary population surveys and land surveys for them, issuing new land deeds and household certificates. Beyond that, effective grassroots governance hadn't yet been established in these villages. The old rural self-governance patterns basically continued, with gentry and clans still enjoying considerable prestige and power. However, due to the establishment of the National Army system and the severe crackdowns during the pacification campaigns—particularly the purging of many gentry and clan members under charges of "colluding with bandits"—these traditional rural forces had become considerably less powerful.

The reason they weren't currently counted as naturalized citizens was purely due to insufficient cadres. Moreover, Hainan's territory was vast—completing this work couldn't happen overnight. Besides, the Civil Affairs People's Committee's current main energy was focused on immigrant settlement. Completing the "naturalization" of all Han, Miao, and acculturated Li populations across Hainan would still take two or three years.



But becoming a naturalized citizen wasn't hard. Anyone who voluntarily joined the military, became a worker or employee at a Senate-affiliated industrial, commercial, or agricultural enterprise, or attended a National School was classified as a naturalized citizen. In short, naturalized citizen was essentially a status anyone could attain if they wished—as long as they could firmly "serve the Senate and the people." No questions about background, gender, or age.

Though theoretically simple, in practice, which people could be counted as naturalized citizens had always been debated in the Senate. For example: could landlords be naturalized citizens? According to the Senate's current rural work philosophy, entrepreneurial landlords developing intensive farming were encouraged and supported. Since they were encouraged targets, classifying them as naturalized citizens was obviously no problem. But whether tenancy-based landlords could become naturalized citizens sparked major controversy in the Senate.

Tenancy landlords were targets for "elimination," yet there were currently many tenancy landlords actively supporting the Senate, with many having sent their children to National Schools and factories. In Lingao alone, over a dozen such landlord families existed—particularly Xun Suji's father-in-law, the Liu family. Though they'd joined the Tiandehe and started intensive farming, they still owned considerable rental land with many tenants.

Such detailed complications made naturalized citizen status difficult to determine operationally. Currently Ma Jia was heading the drafting of a legal document on this subject, to thoroughly regularize the matter.

People like Li Huamei—with some property and professional skills—who wished to "naturalize" would generally be approved. But the Political Security Bureau hadn't given Li Huamei a high political rating—though clear evidence of her relationship with Li Siya hadn't been obtained, various signs suggested it wasn't unfounded. According to the Political Security Bureau's assessment, she had "historical issues and complex social connections."

So this matter had been left hanging. But there were quite a few Li Huamei fans among the Navy's young turks. Hearing that Li Huamei wanted to "defect to freedom," they kept nagging Liu Muzhou to do something about it. Harassed unbearably, Liu Muzhou decided after much deliberation to report directly to the Executive Committee and let them decide—after all, Li Huamei was a name everyone on the Executive Committee had heard of.

Li Huamei didn't know the Australians were hotly debating her disposition internally. After distributing the loot, she went to the trading house to see if she had any mail. Mail forwarding was one of the trading house's services—and of course the Political Security Bureau wouldn't pass up the opportunity to inspect letters.

The letter was from the young miss—of course the letterhead was a Macau merchant firm, and the contents merely reported on traded commodities. Back in her bedroom, she held the envelope's inner lining over a gas lamp flame. Soon several lines of writing appeared.

Li Siya wanted her to gather intelligence on the Australian Navy's recent movements. Beyond that, she also wanted detailed intelligence on the "black-smoking three-masted fast ship"—including how many guns it carried, what size shells it fired, and what secret methods it had for propulsion besides sails.

Li Huamei lit the letter with the gas lamp and watched it turn to ash. She knew her sister had given her another difficult task. Of course, her sister had sent her to join the transmigrators essentially to gather Australian intelligence.

"The black-smoking three-masted ship"—the *Lichun*—she'd seen a few times in Bopu. But this time she'd returned to find the *Lichun* nowhere to be seen. Based on intelligence she'd previously gathered in Bopu, the *Lichun* was most likely now at Kaohsiung in Taiwan—a new port the Australians had built there.

Still, even without the ship here, she could get useful information from her "fans." Besides, there were some smaller "smoke-belching ships" in Bopu. With luck, she might even get to tour one—she'd once even boarded the Holy Ship, after all.

If she could find an acquaintance, she'd be seven or eight parts confident. Additionally, she wanted to take this opportunity to search for her elder sister's whereabouts—since the young miss said her sister was with the Australians, she was most likely in Lingao, the Australians' base. Quite possibly in Bairren City, not far from here.

To avoid trouble, she hadn't told the Australians about searching for her sister Li Mo. She'd find her first and assess the situation. Since the servant girl Li Ying was the only African in Lingao—too conspicuous—she was left at home. Actually, a 165-cm woman like herself was already eye-catching enough. Only because the Australians had recently brought in many northerners was she less noticeable. Li Huamei changed into an old female naturalized worker's uniform, put on a straw hat and straw sandals, hung her temporary resident permit around her neck, and shouldered a bamboo water bottle. She could barely pass for a newly-arrived Shandong lass.
