# Chapter 124: Grand Opening

Though Hainan Women's Cooperative Corporation had a grand name, it was essentially a secondhand-goods shop. Merchandise came from Gou Manor confiscations. Antiques, ornaments, calligraphy, paintings, porcelain had no local market—but ordinary household goods were plentiful, especially clothing. Dozens of cart-loads of bundled clothes. These attracted commoners.

However, as Wen Desi noted, shareholders' capital was denominated in transmigrators' internal accounting-currency: vouchers. How many vouchers equaled one *liang* silver or copper coins became a major problem. Per Committee's original statement: one voucher equaled one RMB.

"Since vouchers are RMB-referenced, values can use RMB benchmarks—" Li Mei said.

"Though I'm not an economist, timespaces differ—RMB values can't be directly applied. For example: a huanghuali table is worth a fortune in the 21st century. Using RMB—that table would be astronomical."

"We can convert using grain-prices." Cheng Dong suggested. "Purchasing-power would be more realistic."

He used rice as conversion-basis:

Lingao rice-price: 1.3 *liang* silver per *shi* (94.4 kg).

Modern Chinese urban rice-price: approximately 3.2 RMB per kg—converted to *shi*: 302.08 RMB.

Using this unit, RMB's actual purchasing-power in 1628 Lingao was: 302.08 RMB = 1.3 *liang* silver. Knowing local prices, RMB-conversion was straightforward.

After complex cost-calculations and market-research, Hainan Women's Cooperative Corporation—abbreviated "Women's Cooperative"—finally opened. Opening later than the salt-shop, plus Li Mei's public-relations skills, meant the Cooperative's grand-opening far eclipsed the salt-shop's. Though also just brick-pillared, awning-and-tarp simple sheds—it occupied a large East Gate Street lot. Li Mei had wanted to buy this land in the company's name—but land-systems were sensitive; Committee wouldn't decide. After intense lobbying, they finally issued a three-year land-use permit—the glorious certificate #001.

Compared to the salt-shop's quiet opening, Women's Cooperative's was quite "event-savvy." Opening featured 10,000 firecrackers specially purchased from the county seat. The crude brick-archway displayed a wooden plaque hand-lettered by Xi Yazhou: "Hainan Women's Cooperative"—five large characters. Surrounding brick-pillars displayed congratulatory plaques—crude but festive. Donors included: The Committee; East Gate Market Administration; Military Department; Security Department; Nanhai Experimental Demonstration Farm... even Ma'ao Salt Village and Damei Village committees sent plaques. Doorway speakers continuously played cheerful *Xi Xiang Feng* *(Happy Reunion)*.

This familiar scene made many transmigrators feel nostalgic—even without buying, they wanted to browse. Inside: over ten stalls, no counters—plenty of Gou Manor furniture substituted. Console-tables and square-tables piled with dazzling goods. First-batch merchandise was calculated by Li Mei: rural purchasing-power was limited; spending meant eating and wearing. Porcelain, ornaments, furniture weren't necessities—commoners couldn't use or afford them. Only clothing and daily-goods were must-buys. So main products were clothes and shoes. Sorting clothes by fabric, condition, and purpose; pairing all shoes—organizing thousands of items had been a massive undertaking. The Ming family of four worked two days and nights straight. Damaged items weren't sold—carted directly to the paper-mill site as raw material.

The Cooperative's entrance was immediately bustling. Locals had never seen such spectacle—crowds gathered. Li Mei seized the moment, directing clerks to attract customers.

Clerks were selected from Damei Village migrants—pleasant-faced, articulate middle-aged women. Bathed and uniformed in matching indigo-blue skirt-and-jacket sets embroidered with "Women's Cooperative"—they looked neat and sharp. Li Mei herself wore a blue cloth skirt-and-jacket—wearing Ming-era clothing naturally, without any awkwardness. Face washed clean, hair neatly combed—exuding crispness. She stood at the entrance greeting various guests. Even hesitant locals peering from a distance received her not-quite-fluent Lingao-dialect greetings—after all, she was mostly earning their money! Customers were Buddha himself.

She knew old farmers, being inexperienced, often didn't dare enter unfamiliar places—fearing scams. So she placed attractive items—secondhand clothes, shoes, hats, small combs, hairpins—along streetside stalls. Most commoners had never seen so many goods—silks and satins of all colors. Families with daughters to marry or daughters-in-law to welcome were calculating: pick up a few pieces. Those tight on cash—feeling poor folks couldn't wear such things—no problem—here were new and half-new cloth-garments, hemp and cotton, priced cheaper than weaving cloth and hiring tailors. Even the most cautious grew interested.

Within an hour of opening, all five shop-fronts were packed with people rummaging, haggling. Li Mei watched this lively scene with satisfaction—suddenly feeling this inexplicable arrival in 1628 wasn't so bad. She was already envisioning her future commercial empire—an unreachable peak in the old timespace! Excitement made her slightly dizzy—then remembering she was nearly sixty. Could she live to see that day? Should find a Chinese-medicine doctor for pulse-diagnosis—autumn was supplementation-season; wasn't it autumn now?

Lost in thought, she spotted a couple emerging from the East Gate—the woman blonde and blue-eyed. Spectators at the entrance, finding new curiosities, crowded to see the foreign-barbarian woman.

Li Mei parted the crowd to greet them: "Editor-in-Chief Ding! You've come to visit our little shop?"

The visitors were self-proclaimed *Lingao Times* publisher-and-editor-in-chief Ding Ding with his Western girlfriend Pan Lin. Just returned from Damei Village days ago—having rushed through a special feature: *The Crimes of the Gou Family*. Galleys just finished yesterday. Hearing the first joint-stock company had opened, his news-sensitive nerves fired—the two immediately came to East Gate Market.

"Sister Li! Your new shop's opened—we weren't first to support you. How rude." Ding Ding, a man of the world, was extra courteous. Looking around: "I didn't even send a congratulatory-plaque—"

"No worries—just publicize us later!" Ding Ding was still an editor without a newspaper—but Li Mei never doubted *Lingao Times* would become a major conglomerate like *The New York Times*. Better to cultivate connections now than later.

"Deal! Today I'm editing. Tomorrow you'll get a special edition!"

"Oh, many thanks! Normally, company-openings should treat everyone to drinks—conditions don't permit now. Come to my place in a few days—I'll cook personally. I still have some Pixian doubanjiang—I'll make you Sichuan cuisine!"

"We'll definitely come. I've been dreaming of shuizhu-yu *(boiled fish)*. Can't even find a red chili here." Ding Ding laughed. "Sister Li, give us a tour!"

Li Mei was delighted—showed them around. Material conditions remained crude, but commercial management was on track: purchasing, inventory, sales—all recorded. Clerks were illiterate; bookkeeping was Li Mei's responsibility. Clerk-compensation used sales-commission—no fixed wages; percentages varied by product; easy-sellers had low rates; hard-sellers, high rates. Three meals daily; work-hours adapted to old customs—5 AM to 6 PM. No days off. Though family-emergencies or illness qualified for leave—which meant no income.

By another timespace's standards, this severely violated labor laws—but in this timespace, it wasn't particularly harsh. Ding Ding recalled interviewing a Shandong old-brand business: even in the early 20th century, many shop-clerks received zero wages—just room-and-board from the boss, year-end red-packets.

*(Note: Historically, many commercial enterprises paid no base-salary. Clerk-income came from two sources: daily tip-sharing and year-end profit-sharing by labor-shares.)*

He noticed ceramic jars in a corner—filled with artemisia tea; a bamboo ladle; wooden bowls beside.

"Free tea." Li Mei explained. Many old businesses provided roadside-tea for passersby in all seasons—a traditional commercial virtue. Popular and good for customer-flow—people who came just for tea often got drawn to merchandise.

"You really know your business." Ding Ding admired. "Truly—every trade has its masters. Impressive! You'll be the first one here to get rich."

"Not necessarily." Li Mei smiled. "Business looks hot today—but today is just Day One. Long road ahead. We're a joint-stock company. Land-use rent, construction materials and labor, even clerks' daily meals—all company cash-expenditures. Except Committee's invested goods, the Cooperative hasn't taken one cent from Committee. This should qualify as 'self-reliant economic development model,' right? Please publicize us well—helps me lobby for preferential policies later!"

"Done!" Ding Ding looked excited. Whispering: "This Women's Cooperative—are men allowed to invest?"

Li Mei understood at once: "Isn't Little Pan a woman?"

They both laughed knowingly.
