# Chapter 124 - Grand Opening

This was the first modern joint-stock company in this time and space. The total share capital was two hundred thousand coupons. The shareholders were 35 women (175,000 coupons), the Executive Committee (20,000 coupons), and the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation (5,000 coupons).

Li Mei became the manager of the company without dispute. The name of the company was finally determined as "Hainan Women's Supply and Marketing Cooperative." Although the name was a bit earthy, it was cordial.

After the approval, Li Mei recruited personnel immediately. She had quite good popularity in the women's world. Although she was old, she was a veteran of the business world, with unique conversational skills and conduct. In the past, she served as the general manager of a large domestic company for many years, so naturally, she had a style. After the arrival, she kept a low profile and was willing to do dirty and tiring work in the cafeteria, so everyone had a good impression of her. In addition, the benefits of becoming a "Cooperative Member" were tangible: one could get coupons from dividends every year, and could also give priority to buying the company's tight goods. So the recruitment went very smoothly. Even the girls from the health group invested money—they had the most income because they were subsidized for their hard work.

Li Mei selected several women to form the company's team. They immediately went to the warehouse of the Planning Committee to sort and evaluate the materials.

Countless materials piled up like mountains in the warehouse of the Planning Committee: tables, chairs, benches, clothes, fabrics, various daily necessities... The confiscation team just registered the categories and quantities roughly before stuffing them in.

The condition of the items was also varied. Clothes and fabrics included brand new silk and satin, as well as worn-out old clothes. Furniture included high-end red sandalwood and rosewood, as well as miscellaneous wood furniture made by country carpenters. Some were complete sets, and some were odd pieces.

Li Mei took the people to sort them category by category. Anything that could be used by the transmigrators was set aside first. For example, furniture made of precious wood was all left for the transmigrators' own use. Any complete sets of miscellaneous wood furniture were also left behind—each dormitory of the transmigrators was empty, and everyone wanted to furnish some tables, chairs, and cabinets. The rest were odd pieces of tables, chairs, and benches, mostly broken and needing repair.

After finishing with the furniture, it was clothes. The silk and satin clothes of the masters and madams were mostly in small sizes, which the generally sturdy transmigrators couldn't wear. Li Mei selected the best ones to be sold as high-end goods, and the rest were dismantled to be sold as raw materials or re-sewn into other things. The servants' clothes were all coarse cloth, mostly worn out. These were bundled up to be sold as cheap clothes to the poor or simply sold by weight as rags.

As for various odds and ends, Li Mei asked everyone to try to form complete sets. If they couldn't be made into sets, they were sold individually.

After this selection, things filled several warehouses. Li Mei went to the Planning Committee again to apply for calling up the carpenters and tailors from the immigrants of Damei Village to repair furniture and alter clothes.

After more than ten days of busy work, the first batch of goods was finally ready. The Cooperative opened in the simple bamboo shed area of East Gate Market. Because there were many goods, it occupied three large sheds at once.

The opening day was chosen on an auspicious day. Li Mei was superstitious about this. Although the old almanac was useless, there were masters who knew divination among the transmigrators. Someone recommended "Create Taoist" (Cui Hantang), saying he was a master of divination. Li Mei hurriedly asked someone to invite him.

This Taoist priest had a very high generation in the Longmen School of Quanzhen Taoism. He was originally a legitimate Taoist priest with a certificate. Because he was obsessed with martial arts since childhood, he practiced hard for many years. Later, he felt that traditional martial arts were just flower stances, so he switched to Sanda (free combat). He was tall and strong, and after shaving his head and beard for the crossing, he looked more like a bandit than a Taoist priest. Hearing that someone asked him to divine an auspicious day, he readily agreed. After pinch-counting his fingers for a while, he set a time. He also said that the opening must be at noon when the Yang energy is at its peak, only then would business be booming.

Li Mei believed it firmly. At noon on the opening day, firecrackers were set off in front of the Cooperative's door. The plaque of "Hainan Women's Supply and Marketing Cooperative" written by Ma Qianzhu was hung up. Li Mei, dressed neatly, stood at the door to welcome guests.

The business was surprisingly good. The common people of Lingao had never seen such a way of selling goods. In the past, shops in the county town kept goods in cabinets. If customers wanted to see, the shopkeeper would take them out. Here, everything was placed on open shelves or piled on the ground, allowing customers to choose at will. Of course, valuable things were still kept behind the counter.

The most popular items were clothes and daily necessities. The poor people lacked everything. Cheap old clothes, although worn out, were better than the rags they wore. Pots, bowls, ladles, and basins were also snapped up. The prices set by Li Mei were very flexible. For damaged goods, the prices were extremely low, almost like giving them away. For slightly better things, the prices were reasonable.

What surprised Li Mei was that the purchasing power of the transmigrators was also very strong. Many people came to buy furniture and daily necessities. Although the dormitory conditions were simple, everyone wanted to make their small nest more comfortable. A table, a chair, a mirror, a teacup... these small things could greatly improve the quality of life.

Seeing the booming business, Li Mei smiled so much that her eyes narrowed into slits. She knew she had made the right bet. This was just the beginning. In the future, the Cooperative would become a business empire covering all aspects of life.

Just as Li Mei was immersed in the joy of success, a dispute occurred in a corner of the shop.

"Why can't I buy this?" A transmigrator was arguing with a salesperson loudly.

Li Mei hurried over to take a look. It turned out that a transmigrator wanted to buy a woman's embroidered shoe.

"Comrade, we sell these in pairs. You only want one, how can we sell the other?" The salesperson explained patiently.

"I just want one for collection! Can't I pay for a pair?" The transmigrator said confidently.

Li Mei didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She waved her hand: "Sell it to him, sell it to him! Charge the price of a pair."

The transmigrator happily paid coupons, took the embroidered shoe, and left. Li Mei looked at his back and shook her head. The hobbies of these otaku men were really strange.

At the end of the day, the Cooperative's turnover reached an astonishing figure. Although most of it was coupons, there was also a lot of silver and copper coins. Li Mei called a meeting of all shareholders that night to announce the good news. Everyone was overjoyed.

With the success of the Cooperative, East Gate Market became more and more lively. People came and went every day, bustling with activity. The commercial department took the opportunity to introduce a series of management regulations, such as market hygiene, fair trading, and tax collection. Although there was some resistance at first, under the powerful force of the transmigrators, everyone slowly accepted it.

The prosperity of East Gate Market also attracted the attention of the county government. Wu Mingjin stood on the city wall every day, looking at the lively scene in the distance with a complicated expression. He knew that the rise of the short-hairs was unstoppable. They not only had powerful force but also such means of doing business and winning people's hearts. If this continued, Lingao County would probably really become their world.

"Advisor Wang, what do you think we should do?" Wu Mingjin asked with a sigh.

Advisor Wang stroked his beard and pondered for a moment: "My Lord, the current plan is to adapt to changes by remaining unchanged. The short-hairs are powerful now; we cannot confront them head-on. It's better to maintain a superficial harmony and wait for the opportunity."

"Wait for the opportunity? When will the opportunity come?"

"The imperial court will not ignore such a huge monster forever. Sooner or later, the army will come to suppress them. At that time, we can cooperate from the inside and catch them all in one net."

Wu Mingjin nodded helplessly. This was the only way now. He only hoped that he could leave this troublesome place before the imperial army arrived.

While the county magistrate was worrying, the transmigrators were preparing for a new action.

After stabilizing the base in Lingao, the Executive Committee turned its attention to the outside. Lingao was too small and lacked resources. To develop, they must connect with the outside world. The nearest big city was Guangzhou.

Guangzhou was the commercial center of South China in the Ming Dynasty and the only port open to foreign trade. There were merchants from all over the world and countless goods and information. Establishing a stronghold in Guangzhou was crucial for the future development of the transmigrators.

The Executive Committee decided to send a capable team to Guangzhou to establish a commercial station and an intelligence station. The leader of this team was Guo Yi.

Guo Yi was a senior employee of a foreign trading company before the crossing, proficient in business and negotiation. He was also calm and meticulous, suitable for such a task alone. His assistants included Xiao Zishan, Yan Maoda, and several personnel from the Intelligence and Information Group and the Commercial Group.

They prepared a ship, loaded with goods produced by the transmigrators: glass mirrors, white sugar, fine salt, etc., as well as some high-end luxury goods brought from the modern time and space. These things would be their stepping stones to open the market in Guangzhou.

Before departure, the Executive Committee held a farewell ceremony for them. Wen Desi patted Guo Yi on the shoulder and said earnestly: "Old Guo, the heavy responsibility is on your shoulders. The success or failure of our trip to Guangzhou concerns the future development of the transmigrators. You must be careful."

"Don't worry, President Wen. I won't disgrace the mission!" Guo Yi said firmly.

The ship slowly left Bopu Port and sailed towards the vast sea. Guo Yi stood at the bow, looking at the receding coastline, his heart full of ambition.

Guangzhou, here we come!
