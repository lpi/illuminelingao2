# Chapter 124: Grand Opening

Though the Hainan Women's Cooperative Corporation had a grand name, it was essentially a secondhand goods shop. The merchandise came from the Gou Manor confiscations. Antiques, ornaments, calligraphy, paintings, and porcelain had no local market, but ordinary household goods were plentiful, especially clothing. There were dozens of cartloads of bundled clothes, which attracted the commoners.

However, as Wen Desi noted, the shareholders' capital was denominated in the transmigrators' internal accounting currency: vouchers. How many vouchers equaled one *liang* of silver or copper coins became a major problem. According to the Committee's original statement, one voucher equaled one RMB.

"Since vouchers are RMB-referenced, values can use RMB benchmarks—" Li Mei said.

"Though I'm not an economist, timelines differ, and RMB values can't be directly applied. For example: a huanghuali table is worth a fortune in the 21st century. Using RMB, that table's value would be astronomical."

"We can convert using grain prices," Cheng Dong suggested. "Purchasing power would be more realistic."

He used rice as the basis for conversion:

Lingao rice price: 1.3 *liang* of silver per *shi* (94.4 kg).

Modern Chinese urban rice price: approximately 3.2 RMB per kg. Converted to a *shi*, this was 302.08 RMB.

Using this unit, the RMB's actual purchasing power in 1628 Lingao was: 302.08 RMB = 1.3 *liang* of silver. Knowing local prices, the RMB conversion was straightforward.

After complex cost calculations and market research, the Hainan Women's Cooperative Corporation—abbreviated as the "Women's Cooperative"—finally opened. Opening later than the salt shop, combined with Li Mei's public relations skills, meant that the Cooperative's grand opening far eclipsed the salt shop's. Though it was also just simple sheds made of brick pillars, awnings, and tarps, it occupied a large lot on East Gate Street. Li Mei had wanted to buy this land in the company's name, but land systems were sensitive, and the Committee wouldn't decide. After intense lobbying, they finally issued a three-year land use permit—the glorious Certificate #001.

Compared to the salt shop's quiet opening, the Women's Cooperative's was quite "event-savvy." The opening featured 10,000 firecrackers specially purchased from the county seat. The crude brick archway displayed a wooden plaque hand-lettered by Xi Yazhou: "Hainan Women's Cooperative"—five large characters. The surrounding brick pillars displayed congratulatory plaques—crude but festive. Donors included the Committee, the East Gate Market Administration, the Military Department, the Security Department, the Nanhai Experimental Demonstration Farm... even the Ma'ao Salt Village and Damei Village committees sent plaques. Doorway speakers continuously played cheerful *Xi Xiang Feng* *(Happy Reunion)*.

This familiar scene made many transmigrators feel nostalgic; even without buying, they wanted to browse. Inside, there were over ten stalls with no counters—plenty of Gou Manor furniture substituted. Console tables and square tables were piled with dazzling goods. The first batch of merchandise was calculated by Li Mei: rural purchasing power was limited, and spending meant eating and wearing. Porcelain, ornaments, and furniture weren't necessities—commoners couldn't use or afford them. Only clothing and daily goods were must-buys. So the main products were clothes and shoes. Sorting clothes by fabric, condition, and purpose, and pairing all the shoes—organizing thousands of items had been a massive undertaking. The Ming family of four worked two days and nights straight. Damaged items weren't sold but were carted directly to the paper mill site as raw material.

The Cooperative's entrance was immediately bustling. Locals had never seen such a spectacle, and crowds gathered. Li Mei seized the moment, directing clerks to attract customers.

The clerks were selected from the Damei Village migrants—pleasant-faced, articulate middle-aged women. Bathed and uniformed in matching indigo blue skirt and jacket sets embroidered with "Women's Cooperative," they looked neat and sharp. Li Mei herself wore a blue cloth skirt and jacket, wearing Ming-era clothing naturally and without any awkwardness. Her face was washed clean, her hair neatly combed, and she exuded crispness. She stood at the entrance greeting various guests. Even hesitant locals peering from a distance received her not-quite-fluent Lingao dialect greetings. After all, she was mostly earning their money, and customers were like Buddha himself.

She knew old farmers, who were inexperienced, often didn't dare enter unfamiliar places for fear of scams. So she placed attractive items—secondhand clothes, shoes, hats, small combs, hairpins—along the street-side stalls. Most commoners had never seen so many goods—silks and satins of all colors. Families with daughters to marry or daughters-in-law to welcome were calculating: pick up a few pieces. Those tight on cash—feeling poor folks couldn't wear such things—no problem; here were new and half-new cloth garments, hemp and cotton, priced cheaper than weaving cloth and hiring tailors. Even the most cautious grew interested.

Within an hour of opening, all five shop fronts were packed with people rummaging and haggling. Li Mei watched this lively scene with satisfaction, suddenly feeling this inexplicable arrival in 1628 wasn't so bad. She was already envisioning her future commercial empire—an unreachable peak in the old timeline! Excitement made her slightly dizzy, but then she remembered she was nearly sixty. Could she live to see that day? She should find a Chinese medicine doctor for pulse diagnosis—autumn was the season for supplementation; wasn't it autumn now?

Lost in thought, she spotted a couple emerging from the East Gate—the woman was blonde and blue-eyed. Spectators at the entrance, finding new curiosities, crowded to see the foreign barbarian woman.

Li Mei parted the crowd to greet them. "Editor-in-Chief Ding! You've come to visit our little shop?"

The visitors were the self-proclaimed *Lingao Times* publisher and editor-in-chief Ding Ding with his Western girlfriend Pan Lin. They had just returned from Damei Village days ago, having rushed through a special feature: *The Crimes of the Gou Family*. The galleys were just finished yesterday. Hearing the first joint-stock company had opened, his news-sensitive nerves fired, and the two immediately came to East Gate Market.

"Sister Li! Your new shop's opened—we weren't the first to support you. How rude." Ding Ding, a man of the world, was extra courteous. Looking around: "I didn't even send a congratulatory plaque—"

"No worries—just publicize us later!" Ding Ding was still an editor without a newspaper, but Li Mei never doubted *Lingao Times* would become a major conglomerate like *The New York Times*. Better to cultivate connections now than later.

"Deal! Today I'm editing. Tomorrow you'll get a special edition!"

"Oh, many thanks! Normally, company openings should treat everyone to drinks—conditions don't permit it now. Come to my place in a few days—I'll cook personally. I still have some Pixian *doubanjiang*—I'll make you Sichuan cuisine!"

"We'll definitely come. I've been dreaming of *shuizhu yu* *(boiled fish)*. Can't even find a red chili here." Ding Ding laughed. "Sister Li, give us a tour!"

Li Mei was delighted and showed them around. Material conditions remained crude, but commercial management was on track: purchasing, inventory, and sales were all recorded. The clerks were illiterate, so bookkeeping was Li Mei's responsibility. Clerk compensation used sales commissions—there were no fixed wages, and percentages varied by product: easy sellers had low rates, and hard sellers had high rates. There were three meals daily, and work hours adapted to old customs—5 AM to 6 PM. There were no days off, though family emergencies or illness qualified for leave—which meant no income.

By another timeline's standards, this severely violated labor laws—but in this timeline, it wasn't particularly harsh. Ding Ding recalled interviewing a Shandong old-brand business: even in the early 20th century, many shop clerks received zero wages—just room and board from the boss and year-end red packets.

*(Note: Historically, many commercial enterprises paid no base salary. Clerk income came from two sources: daily tip sharing and year-end profit sharing by labor shares.)*

He noticed ceramic jars in a corner, filled with artemisia tea, with a bamboo ladle and wooden bowls beside them.

"Free tea," Li Mei explained. Many old businesses provided roadside tea for passersby in all seasons—a traditional commercial virtue. It was popular and good for customer flow—people who came just for tea often got drawn to the merchandise.

"You really know your business," Ding Ding admired. "Truly—every trade has its masters. Impressive! You'll be the first one here to get rich."

"Not necessarily." Li Mei smiled. "Business looks hot today—but today is just Day One. Long road ahead. We're a joint-stock company. Land use rent, construction materials and labor, even clerks' daily meals—all are company cash expenditures. Except the Committee's invested goods, the Cooperative hasn't taken one cent from the Committee. This should qualify as a 'self-reliant economic development model,' right? Please publicize us well—helps me lobby for preferential policies later!"

"Done!" Ding Ding looked excited. Whispering: "This Women's Cooperative—are men allowed to invest?"

Li Mei understood at once. "Isn't Little Pan a woman?"

They both laughed knowingly.
