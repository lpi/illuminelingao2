# Chapter 1699 - Food Factory

Yun Suji looked at this patch of figures showing lagging delivery progress and couldn't help sighing.

Insufficient soybean delivery affected not only soy sauce production but also involved the production of tofu, fermented soya beans, and yellow soybean paste. These were all fist products of the food factory. Although broad beans could be used as substitutes in some places, it was not the same thing after all.

On the rails in the factory area, workers were pushing flatbed carts towards the cleaning workshop. The carts were loaded with rattan baskets full of white radishes. On another track, dried shredded radish transported out from the drying workshop was being sent for packaging.

Yun Suji was watching intently when suddenly the secretary knocked on the door to report: "Chief Xi Yazhou is here."

"Ask him to wait downstairs for a moment, I'll come down immediately." Yun Suji said.

Accompanying the new Army Chief of General Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the South China Army was Chen Sigen. This fitness coach and nutritionist had retired from the position of Special Reconnaissance Detachment Squad Leader. He now served in the Ministry of People's Livelihood and Labor, specifically responsible for national fitness and national nutrition work.

Their visit to the food factory this time was mainly for the logistical food support work of the upcoming Mainland Campaign.

Since the Senate created the army, it has entered the 6th year. The army's logistical supply has also undergone several changes. However, the daily basic supply standard is still based on the standard formulated by Chen Sigen when the Security Regiment was first established. The specific supply standard is: 850 grams of rice, 350 grams of vegetables, 50 grams of soy products, 50 grams of meat or aquatic products, 20 grams of oil/fat, and 10 grams of salt. This standard is not high, but basically meets the needs of soldiers for daily training and housekeeping. When encountering collective corvée labor, field training, and expeditions, the supply standard is adjusted according to the situation.

As Chen Sigen pointed out many times, the supply standard of the Fubo Army can only be considered to satisfy calorie and vitamin needs. The supply of protein and fat is seriously insufficient, thus the soldiers' physical fitness level is on the low side—muscles require a large amount of protein to synthesize. Reliance on training alone cannot truly solve this problem.

The supply keynote set in the Mainland Campaign is relying on "local procurement" for staple food, but the supply of non-staple food has to rely on the Senate's food industry to provide. Although the rich Pearl River Delta won't lack chickens, ducks, freshwater fish, and pigs, the health department still holds a cautious attitude towards local procurement of animal foods.

The Joint Logistics Headquarters sent several official letters to the food factory, requiring them to develop military food that is "easy to carry," "easy to eat," "not easily spoiled," and "rich in protein and fat." Looking at these official letters, Yun Suji could only smile bitterly in secret.

The only thing most conforming to this requirement is canned food. You guys killed the glass jar cans yourselves. Isn't what's left just salted meat and dried meat? Let alone whether these things are "healthy" enough, they can't meet "easy to eat" just by themselves. Such foods are mostly either dead hard or hugely salty; it is hard to swallow them without secondary cooking.

Xi Yazhou and Chen Sigen were both soldiers who had served overseas for a long time, so they both had the muscular brother image with dark skin. Seeing Yun Suji, Xi Yazhou extended his hand while grinning with his big mouth: "Factory Director Yun, long time no see! The dry sausage you gave Joint Logistics for trial last time was very good! Delicious even when eaten directly."

Yun Suji shook hands and said: "It's a pity the raw materials for dry sausage are too few to process more." He had wanted to say "even scrap meat isn't enough," but finally swallowed those words back.

"We came this time to see if we can find more substitutes." Chen Sigen said, "Soldiers' protein and fat intake is insufficient. I estimate that during the Mainland Campaign, the daily calories needed by soldiers won't be lower than 5000 kcal. Just eating rice won't do."

"We have already made considerations." Don't look at Yun Suji having gone to the countryside for half a month; usually, there is still Heaven and Earth Society work to do, but he never put down the matter of new product development in the food factory. In recent years, as long as supply conditions permitted, he would produce small amounts of various foods on a trial basis. Even if mass production wasn't possible, he wanted to try if it was possible. Thus, accumulating over time, quite a few products could be put into production. Some products were manufactured in small batches to supply the Senate's special supply shops and the Violet run businesses in Guangzhou for sales.

"Go, let's go to the workshop to see." Yun Suji said, "I'll introduce as we walk. You see which products are suitable. As long as raw materials can be supplied, production lines can be adjusted."

"This is great." Xi Yazhou's eyes lit up.

Yun Suji took them to the production area and walked into the first workshop.

"This is the Poultry Egg Pickling Workshop." Yun Suji introduced, "Watch your step."

The most eye-catching things in the workshop were large pools tiled with porcelain one after another. Wooden frames were suspended over the pools, and rows of large bamboo baskets hung below, submerged in the pool water.

It was the first time for both Xi Yazhou and Chen Sigen to come to a food factory workshop. Although the smell inside was really unpleasant and the ground was wet, they still felt very curious.

"These few pools mainly produce salted eggs. The eggs are in the baskets. The production process of salted eggs is simple. If the eggshell isn't broken, they can be preserved for a considerable time." Yun Suji said, "Poultry eggs are one of the protein sources we have in relatively ample supply now. High salt content can also replenish salt in soldiers' bodies."

Xi Yazhou was interested: "Why do I remember pickling salted eggs uses yellow mud slurry?"

"Yellow mud also works. But the salt water pickling process is simpler. Just test the PPM concentration of salt in the pool water every day. If not enough, add salt directly. If it's mud slurry, much stirring is needed after adding salt. Besides, salt water has better fluidity; just soaking them in directly is fine, no need for manual mud coating."

"What's in those big cloth bags?" Xi Yazhou pointed at a few cloth bags half-sinking and half-floating on the pool surface.

"It's red chili. Salted egg yolks easily become sandy and oily [with chili]." Yun Suji said, "I've also thought about transportation. Use egg trays for packaging. Just like the common kind in supermarkets, twelve in a group. Made of molded paper pulp. Then match with a relatively thick paper box. Putting them into standard packing cases can withstand long-distance transportation..."

Chen Sigen shook his head and said: "Salted eggs won't do. The preservation period is too short. Even if we fight in spring and the temperature isn't high, the preservation period of raw eggs is only a month. Moreover, your salt water pickled ones probably won't keep for a month once separated from salt water."

Now Xi Yazhou shook his head too. He knew the transfer efficiency of the Joint Logistics Headquarters. Departing from Lingao to Hong Kong, then transshipping from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, then distributing to the front line—this process indeed wouldn't exceed thirty days, but these salted eggs would become "fresh perishables." Warehouses at all levels couldn't store them; they could only be distributed as soon as they arrived. Obviously somewhat unrealistic.

"If salted eggs must be issued, salted eggs using the yellow mud pickling method are relatively more feasible. But they also have to be transported in sealed baskets. If packaged individually, they won't do once the yellow mud dries." Chen Sigen looked at the baskets of salted eggs in the pool water, "To ration eggs to the army, egg powder is still the best."

Xi Yazhou asked: "Can egg powder be produced?"

"There's no difficulty in technology, but production quality is very unstable." Yun Suji had thought about this long ago, "We don't have the ability to do spray drying, only hot steam mixed drying."

Next, they entered the second workshop. Because cooked food was produced here, Yun Suji asked a naturalized citizen to bring three cotton white lab coats, hats, masks, and oilcloth high-tube water boots.

"The clothes have all been cleaned and disinfected." Yun Suji said, "Mainly don't touch any equipment."

As soon as the workshop door opened, the rumbling sound of machine rotation came from inside. Xi Yazhou noticed there were power overhead shafts on the workshop ceiling; this was mechanized production.

"This is the Meat Product Workshop." Because he was wearing a mask, Yun Suji's voice was somewhat muffled.

"Dry sausages are made here?"

"Yes, but only sausages are made here. To make dry sausages, they have to undergo a process of air-drying and smoking." Yun Suji said.

Steam filled the workshop. Xi Yazhou didn't smell fragrance; instead, he smelled an indescribable odor.

"What's being mixed here is sausage meat filling." Yun Suji pointed to a device resembling a concrete mixer in both appearance and shape, said. It was driven by a belt from the overhead shaft and was rumbling while mixing. "Raw materials are processed into different specifications in the crushing workshop: there is minced meat, and also meat cubes. Then they are mixed here. Of course, starch must be added as a filler. Then salt, spices, and various flavoring agents are added, and finally a small amount of sodium nitrite."

"Sodium nitrite?" Xi Yazhou was startled, "This stuff is toxic."

"Correct, this stuff does have toxicity, so dosage must be controlled well. But it is an important additive in processed meat products. Besides color developing, it also has a flavoring effect—this stuff plays a big role in why you think sausages are delicious. Of course, the more important use is acting as a preservative."

A worker threw a full bucket of green plant fragments into the mixer.

"This is basil. This batch is making Italian-style herb sausages." Yun Suji said, "Different flavored sausages can be made according to added spices and flavoring agents."

While talking, the worker pulled the gear lever, stopped the machine, and opened the discharge port.

Chen Sigen looked at the meat filling being released from the discharge port with a slightly uncomfortable feeling: "To tell the truth, I really don't want to know what meat this is made of..."

"Intestine filling [sausage], colloquially called creamy offal tube." Yun Suji cracked a joke, "After Germans kill a pig, nothing is left over—all chopped up and made into sausages."

"The ones sold in Nanhai shops," Xi Yazhou asked hurriedly, "should be good meat, right?" His stomach felt a bit uncomfortable.

"That's natural. Starch is still added, and a part of chicken or duck meat is added as filler. But you can be assured, whatever meat is used, it's good meat. Especially the fat cubes, they are genuine hard fat." Yun Suji said.

"What about these?" Chen Sigen asked about the meat filling in front of him.
