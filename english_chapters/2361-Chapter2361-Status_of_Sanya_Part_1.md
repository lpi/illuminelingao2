# Chapter 2361: Status of Sanya (Part 1)

The Senate's initial planning for Sanya revolved around the Tiandu Mine, roughly conducting development and construction along the coast of Yulin Bay.

But as the project progressed, they soon discovered that the original planning did not suit the development needs of the so-called "Southern Central Metropolis of Hainan Island"—there was too little land for construction. Ji Runzhi stated that if Sanya was only positioned as a naval port and resource export port in the future, choosing the area around Yulin Bay would be no problem; not only were the port conditions superior, but the terrain was also easy to defend and hard to attack. However, as an industrial and commercial city, it was far from enough. Therefore, the site selection for Sanya Special City still took the coast of Sanya Bay as the urban area.

The small boat set sail from Yulin Fortress Pier and sailed along the west bank of Yulin Bay. The sea breeze was strong; although it was winter, the sea breeze on Yulin Bay still permeated with the scent of summer.

Sunshine, sandy beaches, the sea... in any spacetime, this was a beautiful picture. However, Xu Yanliang was in no mood to appreciate it. Following Tang Menglong's guidance standing beside him, he identified the main mountains and rivers along the coast.

"This is 'Rabbit Tail Ridge'," Tang Menglong pointed, "Between 'Rabbit Tail Ridge' and 'Deer Turning Head' is Dadonghai."

Although Xu Yanliang had been here in another spacetime, Dadonghai, which had completely wiped out traces of artificial buildings and dense tourists at this moment, made him feel a bit unfamiliar. He carefully identified the scenery here, trying to compare it with the impression in his mind.

The rough terrain was still the same: Dadonghai was a naturally formed crescent-shaped shallow bay. The water surface was a crescent-shaped sandy beach, and to the south was the boundless sea. The sand here was flat, the water clear, the wind light, and the waves fine. The casuarina equisetifolia trees on the shore provided verdant shade. From a tourism perspective, it was indeed a rare subtropical seaside scenic spot in China.

However, at this moment, Dadonghai was still a desolate bay. It was sparsely populated. Apart from traces of a few fishermen's activities on the beach, there were only a few slightly dilapidated stilt houses deep in the bay—these were the "seaside vacation cottages" built for the Senators back then, which used to be a "must-visit holy land" for Senators coming to Sanya. Taking maids here for vacation was once popular in the Senate. In recent years, the Senators' novelty had passed, fewer people came, and the General Office and Sanya Municipal Government were too lazy to repair them frequently. After a few typhoons, they had become dilapidated and crumbling.

Sanya in this spacetime was still not attractive enough—resources like blue sky and sea needed sufficient infrastructure to attract people. The Senate's construction here was still somewhat lacking after all. "Pure natural" wooden cabins ultimately couldn't meet the Senators' needs for enjoyment.

Crossing Dadonghai and bypassing a cape, they arrived at Xiaodonghai. The iconic Luhuitou Ridge could be seen, where the Navy had set up batteries and observation towers on the commanding heights of the ridge. The Morning Star Flag fluttered in the wind.

Below the ridge was a large star fort guarding the anchorage. Multiple light sailing warships were docked here. On the shore, Navy soldiers in white uniforms were drilling.

"Are there no civilian ships here?"

"This is a military port. According to the rules, only Senate ships can enter and dock in Yulin Bay and Big/Small Donghai; civilian ships are generally not allowed to enter." Tang Menglong said, "Civilian ships all dock over in Sanya Bay."

Because they had been informed in advance, the battery did not fire a salute. Spewing smoke and steam, the traffic boat bypassed Luhuitou and entered the vast Sanya Bay.

Looking from the boat, patches of buildings appeared on the seashore in the northeast direction of Sanya Bay, and masts could also be seen.

"Here is Sanya Special City." Tang Menglong pointed with his hand.

Sanya originated from a small village with the local name Sanya. In the Tang Dynasty, it had a formal name, Linchuan County, named for being "close to the river and plain." The river was thus named Linchuan Water.

According to the "Gazetteer of Yazhou," the county seat was in "the mountains southwest of the Salt Field, one hundred and ten li southeast" of the prefecture city. It relied on Dacheng Ridge in the south, connected to Haoba Ridge in the north, relied on Dagou Ridge in the east, and faced the river in the west.

Linchuan County was abolished in the Five Dynasties period, and Linchuan Town was not set up again until the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song. However, by the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, this place had become entrenched by bandits. Since then, Linchuan had been silent. According to the "Gazetteer of Qiongzhou" compiled in the Zhengde reign of the Ming Dynasty, there was only "stone street still existing" here. It can be seen that it had been completely abandoned.

But Linchuan Port, the estuary of Linchuan Water, rose at this time. The reason was that since the Song Dynasty, there were salt fields on the local seashore. In order to export edible salt, the estuary of Linchuan Water became a natural river port for exporting edible salt.

In the Ming Dynasty, Linchuan Li was set up near Linchuan Port. The specific location was "Longpo," which was exactly between the Sanya River and Linchuan River, the two main rivers in the Sanya area. Among the fourteen "Li" under the jurisdiction of Yazhou in the Ming Dynasty, Linchuan Li was included. It can be seen that the population at that time was at least a hundred households.

However, when the Senate's Sanya Development Detachment arrived back then, the population of Linchuan Li had plummeted to less than fifty households. And they were all of "salt household status," that is, salt workers specializing in drying salt. Obviously, the reason why a Li was set up here was entirely because of the salt field. Although Sanya Salt Field was listed as one of the six major salt fields in Qiongzhou under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Revenue, annual production of sea salt was only a few thousand shi. When Wang Luobin and others landed in Yulin, they sent people here for social investigation. At that time, the salt field was in a state of near abandonment, with only a small number of salt workers still engaged in small-scale production.

"...After Wang Luobin became the mayor, he also carried out technical reforms in the salt field, introducing windmill water-lifting and concentration technology. Now the output of the salt field has gone up. But I feel the demand from the Planning Committee is not very strong..." Tang Menglong complained.

"The scale of salt chemicals hasn't picked up, so what's the use of drying so much salt? How much can people eat?" Xu Yanliang said, "The least lacking thing in Hainan and Guangdong is salt! The salt you dry in the south of Hainan Island is more expensive than Ma'ao salt when transported to Lingao. If not for maintaining the operation of the salt field, transporting salt from Sanya wouldn't be economical for the Planning Committee at all!"

"Wait until the chemical zone in Danzhou is set up; I don't know if the situation can improve." Tang Menglong was depressed, "The current salt field workers are still too poor. Working themselves to death just to fill their stomachs."

Although the salt field was under the jurisdiction of the Planning Committee, the salt field workers all lived in Sanya. Their consumption of food, clothing, housing, and transportation could largely stimulate consumption in Sanya.

The miners of Tiandu and the salt workers of the salt field were the two largest consumer groups in Sanya at present. If they lived too poorly, the commerce in Sanya naturally couldn't be improved.

"How can it be so fast?" Xu Yanliang said, "For this project, the blueprint is drawn big enough, almost turning Danzhou directly into an industrial park, but if you expect it to cause a sea salt supply crisis, you have to wait at least two or three years."

"Two or three years doesn't matter. As long as it can be set up, I'd be happy to be mayor here all my life." Tang Menglong said, "The environment here is good."

"If the environment is good, why don't you bring your wife and children over?" Xu Yanliang couldn't help laughing.

"Where would the children go to school if brought here? There is only one National Primary School here—it was said that the calcultus mode would be copied in Sanya to set up a ten-year National School, but after Wang Luobin left, there was no follow-up. The land was circled well. The least valuable thing in Sanya now is land!"

The two stood on the deck pointing out the landscape; although the voyage time was long, it didn't feel boring. The traffic boat entered Sanya Bay. Sanya Port had very good port conditions, with deep water and a wide bay. The inner harbor had good shelter conditions, so it replaced Linchuan Port at the river estuary in the Qing Dynasty. The Senate also set up the main commercial port here.

"There are quite a few ships docked here!" Xu Yanliang saw that the port had a bit of the meaning of a forest of masts. At a rough glance, there were about a hundred ships of various sizes docked. Most were various small and medium-sized ships common along the coast of the South China Sea, but there were also a few large merchant ships mixed in.

Tang Menglong frowned: "To be honest, quite a few ships come, but most don't come to do business."

This was the best shelter port in southern Hainan. With regular patrols by the Coast Guard and protection by coastal defense troops, plus a dedicated shipyard providing ship repair services, many surrounding fishing boats and passing merchant ships would choose to dock and resupply in Sanya. If southbound merchant ships were delayed in their return voyage and missed the returning monsoon, they would also choose to winter in Sanya.

"...To be honest, our merchants here cannot be said to be not hardworking, but there's no way; the variety of goods available for purchase here is too small, and some stocks are insufficient. people would rather go to Lingao or Guangzhou to purchase. We just earn a service fee. In comparison, the fishing industry is more prosperous. Xun Suji set up a food processing factory here back then to acquire and process catch locally, and the benefits are not bad. It can be considered a local pillar industry—it also helped the salt field digest a lot of salt."

"Earning service fees isn't bad either. Singapore is a small country; it doesn't produce much itself, and consumption is limited, but it doesn't hinder it from becoming an important port and cargo distribution center." Xu Yanliang thought, Sanya's congenital deficiency was hard to overcome, and wanting to turn it into a commercial center was probably beyond its power, but turning it into a "service area" on the highway might still be possible.

"I hope so." Tang Menglong said, "I just hope you can bring new business to me here. Among national policy enterprises, you are the first one with headquarters set here."

"Not at all, not at all, we still need the municipal government to support us a lot."

The traffic boat slowly docked at the pier amidst the mutual flattery and politeness of the two. Sanya's weather was much hotter than Lingao, making it even less suitable for raising horses, so there were naturally no official carriages. Tang Menglong's usual means of transport was the rickshaw.

The two got on rickshaws and went all the way to the City Hall.

Sanya City Hall was located in Longpo. On the new map drawn by the Senate, this place was called "Hedong Island." It was a long and narrow strip of land between the Sanya River and the Linchuan River. Not directly facing the sea, it was equivalent to the inner city area of Sanya. Ji Runzhi's plan back then was to use this place as the administrative and cultural education center of Sanya.
