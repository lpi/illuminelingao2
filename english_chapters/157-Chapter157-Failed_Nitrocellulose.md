# Chapter 157: Failed Nitrocellulose

*Whew*... finally completed something milestone-significant. Xiao Bailang flicked the newly-completed ceramic-vat—that crisp *dong-dong* sound was more glorious than heaven's bells. Industrial-Department brothers who'd lived at kiln-sites for a dozen days wept—not easy! After multiple failures in forming, air-drying, glazing, and firing-temperature control, they'd finally achieved success. Now: large-scale seafood-pickling, soy-sauce, light-chemical-products all had basic equipment. Future flush-toilets had hope.

"Our transmigrator-nation's era of depending on Ming-people for ceramic-vats—gone forever!" Xiao Bailang's powerful-voice rang beside the vat. He struck a pose—unfortunately Ding Ding wasn't there to photograph.

Ceramic-vats: simple in principle, but large-diameter thin-walled ceramics were hardest to manufacture. Transmigrators had made small-diameter ceramic-pipes and vats—no experience with this scale. Industrial-Department consulted countless-references, recruited all Lingao potters—finally completing vat-firing. No simple-task. Helping-potters said: only Qiongshan-county kilns in entire Qiongzhou-Prefecture had this capability. Successfully trial-producing surprised even them.

Industrialized ceramic-workshop had basic production-capability. Brick-kiln already had all forming and firing conditions—800°C temperature sufficed.

With various vats and pots, Chemistry-Group could finally begin their great indigenous-chemistry process. Among most-urgent chemicals: sulfuric-acid and nitric-acid had widest uses. Especially nitric-acid—most explosives and pyrotechnics required it. From transmigrator-miracle nitrocellulose to dangerous nitroglycerin.

Manufacturing nitric-acid required nitrates. Without synthetic-ammonia industry, nitric-acid needed nitrate-salts. China's natural nitrate-deposits were in Sichuan and northwest—none in south. They relied on collecting saltpeter-soil for refining. Dirty, inefficient work. Without Guangzhou Forward-Station's timely saltpeter-shipment, Chemistry-Department would've been reduced to excavating toilets and pigsties.

With sufficient saltpeter—smuggling-export-quality from Guangdong, excellent-grade—and ample black-powder stockpile, this saltpeter could all be used for nitric-acid.

How to make nitric-acid? Transmigration-enthusiasts nearly all read *Mysterious Island*—knew nitric-acid was made using sulfuric-acid. For nitric-acid, first need sulfuric-acid.

Ji Situi considered: modern industrial sulfuric-acid had three sources. First: coal-coking by-product. Second: sulfur plus saltpeter. Third: iron-pyrite. Each had pros/cons and indigenous-processes—but all currently-unusable. No raw-materials. Fortunately, Guangzhou had purchased green-vitriol. Though yield was tiny—process was extremely-simple. Their laboratory-equipment sufficed.

Green-vitriol distillation for vitriol-oil was the most traditional, simplest sulfuric-acid method. Ancients used vitriol-oil in small-scale metalworking. Late-Ming—benefiting from Western missionary science-transmission—some had made nitric-acid and aqua-regia. But manufacturers didn't realize potential-applications. Given more time, perhaps Chinese-chemistry's new-epoch might have begun. But the "great-unification"-obsessed slave-owner regime quickly ended that possibility.

Green-vitriol dry-distillation's efficiency was extremely-low—sulfuric-acid yield only ~10% of raw-material. Better than nothing—purely temporary-substitute. This distillation was highly-polluting, somewhat-dangerous. Chemistry-Group chose a suitable-wind-direction site in Bopu's heavy-industry-zone for factory-building. All participants received chemical-factory labor-protection clothing and masks. Days later—20kg concentrated sulfuric-acid.

With concentrated sulfuric-acid, nitric-acid was possible. Again distillation: add saltpeter to sulfuric-acid, slowly-heat, using nitric-acid's volatility to obtain concentrated nitric-acid. This process released substantial-heat. *Fengcheng*'s refrigerator-made ice finally served proper-purpose—ice-water-mixture for cooling nitric-acid condensation retorts.

With nitric-acid, guncotton—that transmigrator-miracle—was immediately-proposed. Guncotton not only had greater explosive-power than black-powder—it was excellent propellant.

After plan-approval, Li Di began trial-manufacturing smokeless-explosive—guncotton. Properly Chemistry-Group's responsibility—but they doubted nitrocellulose feasibility. Navy's Li Di suddenly abandoned steam-engines, volunteering for guncotton—condition: batch-production priority for Navy.

First: gathered ceramic-vats, acids/bases for one-batch, plus 15kg cotton. Lye came from stockpile—needed Planning-Committee approval. Explosives were military-priority—approval came quickly.

Since both lye and nitric-acid were corrosive, Li Di borrowed Chemistry's gloves and apron.

Guncotton required extremely-pure absorbent-cotton. Normal explosive-factories purchased pre-made products. Transmigrators had to hand-process.

First: process cotton. Tear apart, remove visible-impurities (pebbles, leaves). Wash until rinse-water ran clear. Place cotton in ceramic-pot, add water just covering it, then add 2–5% lye by water-weight. Cover, boil, simmer 10 minutes. Cool, rinse thoroughly—scrubbing for ~10 minutes. Spread washed-cotton on clean paper, sun-dry outdoors. Pour remaining lye into waste-alkali barrel. Begin mixing concentrated nitric-acid and sulfuric-acid at proper-ratio for esterification mixed-acid. Lingao's dry-season still had high-humidity—mixed-acid had cooled, cotton wasn't dry yet. Future needed drying-machines. Eighth-Route Army's ordnance used heated-*kang* for drying—learnable.

Li Di placed most-dried cotton into mixed-acid, pressed, stirred, covered. Watched time—after 10 minutes, removed it, set aside. Added remaining-cotton. Combined both batches afterward.

Poured waste-acid into waste-barrel, continued stabilization-treatment. Took 6 hours—first-batch guncotton completed. Still wet—only air-drying was safe. Had to spread-out to prevent accidents.

By evening—finally dry guncotton. 16kg. Take to Artillery-Group for testing! They were practically weapons-research-institute now.

These days, Bopu's range had daily-explosions—often seeing smoke-trailing, blackened Lin Shenhe, Bai Yu, and others gasping by the riverside.

Li Di brought new-guncotton to the range. Suddenly—massive-explosion. Half a cannon-barrel flew spinning through air—terrifying. Soon Lin Shenhe climbed out of trench, completely-blackened, nodding to others emerging behind:

"Our cannon barrel-life exceeds expectations."

Li Di hurried over, handing him guncotton: "This is my new-guncotton. Please test. Careful—this stuff's power isn't comparable to black-powder!!!"

Lin Shenhe looked puzzled: "Is this high-nitrogen or low-nitrogen?"

"High-nitrogen?" Li Di was clueless.

"I sweat—brother, you made guncotton without knowing this?" Lin Shenhe was shocked. "Different nitrogen-content means completely-different performance."

"Should be low-nitrogen." Bai Yu—weapons-manufacturing background, knew some pyrotechnics. "Indigenous nitric-acid, indigenous esterification—hard to produce high-nitrogen guncotton."

"Let's try." Li Di's confidence wavered.

Half-hour later, Lin Shenhe found Li Di—blackened, reeking of gunpowder—unhappily saying: "Your guncotton—use it for paint or glue."

"I followed the textbook exactly!" Li Di shouted. "Standard laboratory-procedure."

"Problem: it won't detonate."

"Probably insufficient nitrogen-content." Bai Yu said.

"Another victim of Verne-poisoning."

Verne made guncotton-manufacturing seem very-simple. Actually, guncotton was difficult under crude-conditions. Especially during esterification—accurately controlling nitrating-agent composition, reaction-temperature, reaction-time, and other factors to control nitrogen-content, viscosity, etc., was required.

How difficult? Transmigrators' technical-library had many indigenous-explosive booklets—even nitroglycerin and RDX indigenous-methods existed. Uniquely absent: guncotton. Clearly not easily-manufactured.

Industrially, guncotton was classified by nitrogen-content: Grade-1 high-nitrogen, Grade-2 high-nitrogen, Grade-3 low-nitrogen, blasting-gelatin-cotton, pyroxylin, lacquer-cotton, celluloid-cotton. Indigenous nitrocellulose could at best reach celluloid-cotton level.

"Wasted so much nitric-acid and lye." Li Di was frustrated. Chemicals were already-tight.

"If celluloid-cotton level—could use as propellant. Though inferior." Lin Shenhe thought. "Wu Yunduo's memoirs mentioned: reloading cartridges used either black-powder or discarded movie-film. Celluloid as propellant."

"Try as propellant?"

"Can't use directly—needs grinding then compression." Bai Yu shook his head. "Store for now. With future equipment, scale-up. Let's ask Chemistry-Department to rush mercury-fulminate. Rifles won't work without it."

**(Note: Li Di's method cannot produce usable nitrocellulose. In proper laboratory-environments with analytical-grade reagents, celluloid-cotton is achievable. But formal nitrocellulose production is far more complex. Beyond nitrogen-control difficulties—removing free-acid from cotton-fibers isn't simple water-washing. Early nitrocellulose's incomplete-acid-removal caused multiple-accidents. Austrian military suffered greatly—completely abandoning it.)**
