# Chapter 1076 - Defending Laizhou

In order to issue his first commercial loan, Leng Ningyun put a lot of thought into it—he conducted a comprehensive credit investigation on this merchant, including his past business status, credit situation, and his assets.

In 17th-century Beijing, there were no specialized private investigation agencies, and the government's control over private information was far inferior to that of later generations. Therefore, this information was all dug up by Wu Kaidi and his men.

*It seems I need to expand the number of investigators under my command,* Leng Ningyun thought. *In the 21st century, a bank can hire an investigation company; in the 17th century, I have to run an investigation company myself.*

The investigation company didn't necessarily have to be subordinate to Delong, he thought. It could be managed entirely according to the concept of "tertiary industry." If any problems occurred, he could immediately distance himself.

Speaking of which, he also needed a security team—currently, the bank's security business was responsible by the Qipwei Capital Head Office; they dispatched four nursing home guards to sit in the shop and keep watch at night. Leng Ningyun always felt uneasy: *Is this number of people too few? moreover, the weapons carried by the escorts are also very simple; in my eyes, they simply have no deterrent force.*

He returned to his study amidst his random thoughts. Looking at the cash flow charts and various diagrams on the table—all drawn by himself personally—Delong's business was very quiet, so he had plenty of time to engage in professional business in this area.

The loans didn't look very good on the report—the loans in the last two months were mainly micro-loans. Leng Ningyun sighed. Compared to the Shanxi merchants who had enormous power in the capital, his own activities were not yet up to par, and were ten thousand eight thousand *li* away from his own vision.

In the cause of the Delong Beijing Branch, Leng Ningyun had his own complete set of concepts. In his original design, soliciting savings and commercial loans were just the first step. Delong's work in Beijing was not only to compete with Shanxi people for loans and deposits but also to get involved in the budding insurance industry in the future, including the mutual funds, joint-stock systems, etc., that he had once envisioned in Lingao—although they were not very practical. But in terms of loans, especially official loans, there must be a breakthrough! Leng Ningyun had even considered engaging in the national debt business of the Great Ming government.

His plan received strong support from the Senators in the finance and economic system, but in front of the Industrial Party headed by Director Ma, these were all "crooked ways and wicked paths." In the theoretical journal *Morning Star* (*Qimingxing*) edited and issued by the Propaganda Department, he had once read an article titled "Be Vigilant Against Virtual Economy Bubbles" written by a certain cadre Senator, calling for vigilance against engaging in "virtual economy" in the financial and economic fields to destroy the "large economic environment." This article criticized various financial businesses, except for insurance, one by one—although Leng Ningyun considered most of the content to be "nonsense taken for granted by a layman after reading a few books," this article represented a strong anti-financial trend of thought within the Senate.

In comparison, the voice of his own system was still too weak. The Senators controlling the finance and economic system were generally relatively low-key, with very little enthusiasm for the development of financial products and businesses, mainly acting as "accountants."

His work in Beijing, on the one hand, had to have actual economic benefits and results; on the other hand, it was also to increase the prestige of himself and other Senators in the financial circles.

Wu Kaidi ran around outside for a day and returned to the bank in the evening to report to him.

He ran to more than a dozen government offices (*yamen*) and sat in tea houses frequented by *yamen* clerks and officials' long-term followers. The general news he got was that the news of Kong Youde capturing Dengzhou had already appeared in the Capital Gazette (*Dibao*). The court was questioning Shandong Governor Yu Dacheng about the whereabouts of Sun Yuanhua and other Dengzhou and Laizhou officials, demanding him to report back quickly.

"...Yu Dacheng hasn't replied yet—it is said that the Emperor is very furious about this, repeatedly calling Yu Dacheng 'incompetent'..." Wu Kaidi spoke vividly, as if he had seen the Chongzhen Emperor say this with his own eyes, reminding Leng Ningyun of taxi drivers in Beijing in another spacetime.

"What do the officials of various factions in the court say?"

"Master Xiong of the Ministry of War is still the same as before, strongly advocating for appeasement," Wu Kaidi said. "Although Grand Secretary Xu and Grand Secretary Zhou didn't say much, everyone feels they are also of the appeasement faction—Sun Yuanhua is, after all, Grand Secretary Xu's man."

Generally speaking, although Dengzhou had already fallen, the current court opinion was still mainly "appeasement."

"Who are the ones advocating suppression?" Leng Ningyun asked.

"The most radical advocate is Li Jizhong, a Director in the Bureau of Operations of the Ministry of War. He once opposed Master Xiong's appeasement theory in the ministry meeting, wanting Master Xiong to transfer elite troops from Liaodong to suppress. I heard they parted on bad terms. Master Li Jizhong is afraid he will soon leave his post."

Then he listed some names, and Leng Ningyun made a few notes—this was a memo for himself; for specific details, Wu Kaidi would write a detailed report for him.

"What are the comments on Sun Yuanhua in the court?"

"Anyway, no one says good words, but Governor Sun's life or death is uncertain now. Even if they want to impeach him, there is no target. If he really died for the country in Dengzhou, wouldn't impeaching him be giving others a handle against themselves?"

Leng Ningyun thought, *it looks like once the news that Sun Yuanhua has arrived in Laizhou reaches the capital, he will face fierce artillery fire.*

He looked at the Capital Gazette brought by Wu Kaidi—he had received specialized training in ancient Chinese on how to read the Capital Gazette. However, although the writing style of the memorials was not considered elegant, it was not ancient vernacular either, and it was very strenuous for him to read.

"Call the advisor (*Shigong*) over in a while."

Leng Ningyun employed several advisors to help handle documents. Especially for the content in the Capital Gazette, he often relied on the advisors' explanations. These advisors were not naturalized citizens, so they only handled affairs and did not participate in secret matters.

Impeachment would not only come from his own political opponents; various forces dissatisfied with Xu Guangqi, Zhou Yanru, Xiong Mingyu, and even the Liaodong clique would use this incident as ammunition to attack their opponents. The situation Sun Yuanhua had to face was probably very bad.

To protect him from harm, it looked extremely difficult. Leng Ningyun felt troubled unknowingly—*this task is too difficult!*

However, to show his ability, he had to get things done properly. Who couldn't do easy things?

After thinking for a moment, he felt he still had to work on the eunuchs. *I wonder what the eunuchs' intention is now?* Wu Kaidi said: He specially went to the residences of Old Eunuch Yang, Junior Eunuch Yang, and several other eunuchs he often visited and had dealings with, chatting with the little eunuchs and servants he was familiar with to test the views of the "Inner Ministers" in the palace.

Overall, Sun Yuanhua had no bad reputation among the eunuchs—generally speaking, he was quite smooth in his official dealings and conduct, and he was not a member of the Donglin Party, perfunctory to the eunuchs quite well. Although there was no great friendship to speak of, at least there were no signs of enmity.

In this case, it would be much easier to maneuver. Leng Ningyun thought, *just as later generations said, things that can be settled with money are not difficult things.*

After considering again and again, Leng Ningyun decided to continue collecting information for these few days, while he telegraphed "Center" that he prepared to use Eunuch Yang's channel to try to ask Wang Dehua and others for help. For this purpose, some special "Australian goods" in stock needed to be used as gifts for bribery. He requested "Center" to approve.

While Leng Ningyun was racking his brains in Beijing considering how to start aiding Sun Yuanhua, Sun Yuanhua had already settled many things in Laizhou.

First was straightening out Laizhou's defense—Laizhou Prefect Zhu Wannian was decisive and capable. In the original historical trajectory, Zhu Wannian contributed greatly to the defense battle of Laizhou. Finally, he was seduced and captured by the rebels, eventually dying in Dengzhou. Now that Sun Yuanhua was out of trouble, Zhu Wannian had a pillar of support and immediately strengthened Laizhou's defense under his instructions. Magistrate Hong of Ye County was also a quite capable local official. Laizhou's defense immediately improved greatly.

The most critical person was Shandong Regional Inspector (Censor) Wang Daochun—this person held a "suppression" attitude from the beginning. Sun Yuanhua visited him immediately after escaping, indicating that he had suddenly repented and was determined to "painfully suppress."

In this way, Wang Daochun, who originally criticized Sun Yuanhua's "appeasement" policy greatly during the Dengzhou-Laizhou Incident and was also a Censor, became Sun's ally—at least before the situation calmed down, he would no longer impeach Sun Yuanhua who was presiding over the counter-insurgency work.

The Engine Forward Command estimated that as long as Sun Yuanhua arrived in Laizhou and put on a posture of "painful suppression," his originally passive situation would improve greatly. Especially a group of officials who hated the rebels deeply would change their stance towards him more or less.

Sun Yuanhua's second step was to quickly visit the local gentry: The gentry were not only wealthy but also had great appeal locally—some gentry were themselves leaders of village militia (*Tuanlian*), belonging to local power factions with grain, pay, and soldiers. In ancient society, obtaining the support of local gentry was crucial for defending a city.

Although Laizhou was not a wealthy place, the head county, Ye County, also had some big rural officials: Jia Yuxiang, the former Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Left, and Zhang Xin, a *Jinshi* of the fifth year of Tianqi, were both locals.

Sun Yuanhua visited them one by one and received their support. Especially Zhang Xin, whose family had abundant assets, immediately expressed willingness to donate a huge sum to recruit village braves and reward soldiers.

Then he summoned the students of the Prefecture School and County School, asking them to work together with one heart to prepare for defending the city.

However, there were not many defenders in the city, only three thousand men. Some were even drilling troops of the local Guard (*Wei*). Fortunately, Laizhou Guard also had some Tartar troops (*Daguan Bing*): descendants of Semu military personnel from the Yuan Dynasty; the combat effectiveness of Tartar troops had always been relatively strong in the Ming Dynasty.

But Sun Yuanhua knew very well that this little military strength was difficult to withstand the rebel attack. He understood too well the troops he had personally built, equipped, and trained. No army in the Great Ming was as good at using firearms as they were—not to mention that Dengzhou City was full of firearms and gunpowder—that was his painstaking effort for many years.

Except for transferring elite border troops from Liaodong, the various armies distributed in Zhili and Shandong were simply not the opponents of the rebels. Not to mention field battles, even defending the city might not be successful.
