# Chapter 817 - The People of Leizhou Station

After completing the formalities, members of the new and old leadership teams held a welcome and farewell banquet at the Leizhou Station headquarters—formerly Zhu An's residence. The attendees were naturally all Elders. To avoid provoking the "comrade from Central"—especially since she was a woman, and women tended to be more sensitive, plus she was a married woman—the banquet was extremely proper. there was no "entertainment" that the masses enjoyed, and the dishes belonged to the delicious-but-practical category.

Views were exchanged happily at the table. Yan Maoda was originally a member of the Guangzhou-Leizhou faction and frequently came to Leizhou for trade business, so he was very familiar with the Leizhou Station people. As for Bei Kai, he had once traveled to Vietnam with Chang Shide to search for the Hongji coal mine, so he wasn't an outsider either. By comparison, Jin Zhijiao was a pure "outsider." Perhaps feeling her presence made everyone unable to relax, Jin Zhijiao quickly excused herself after eating to return to her room—she still had to continue auditing Leizhou's accounts and write an audit report for the Cheka. Unlike the Guangzhou Station, the Leizhou Station had fewer economic entities and simpler account categories. Jin Zhijiao and several female apprentices had been stationed in Leizhou since the annual meeting ended and had essentially cleared things up.

After Jin Zhijiao left, Wen Tong ordered someone to clear the table, then had Ah Zhu set out tea, snacks, melon seeds, cigarettes, and the like in the living room of his own small courtyard. The group drank tea and chatted.

After some small talk, the conversation turned to the future operations of the Leizhou Station. The Vietnam Trade Company had been separated from the Leizhou Station system, becoming a state-owned direct-operation company. Although its "status" had been raised, since its headquarters remained in Leizhou and a large portion of its trade goods was Leizhou sugar, its cooperation with the Leizhou Station remained inseparable.

"I really hate to see you go. Leizhou sugar industry can't do without you," Wen Tong said with emotion to Chang Shide.

"Anyway, things are mostly set up. Let the Tiandihui and Delong Bank people handle it from here. They're more professional than I am," Chang Shide was actually unsatisfied with this transfer, but didn't show it on his face, pretending to be indifferent. "If the two of us keep sparking so much passion here, that bunch in the Council of Elders will die of jealousy. Don't worry, even though I, Chang Shide, am no longer in Leizhou, alive I am a Leizhou Station man, dead I am a Leizhou Station ghost."

Wen Tong sighed: "Sigh, take care of yourself—without you, I feel there's no meaning in staying in Leizhou."

"Don't say that. Leizhou is a living piece on the go board for the Council of Elders. Right now it's a major source of hard cash—just the net income of over a hundred thousand taels of silver annually, plus the rice and coal exchanged from Vietnam. Saying our Leizhou Station is Lingao's blood bank isn't an exaggeration—Leizhou is a vast world where much can be accomplished!"

When the Guangzhou Station was forced to retreat, the Leizhou Station continued to operate, serving as Lingao's only external channel at the time. In a situation where all trade was successively cut off and imports/exports were nearly paralyzed, Leizhou fully utilized its geographical advantage facing Lingao across the strait to continue handling bulk commodity exports and coal/rice imports.

In this respect, the Leizhou Station's contributions and achievements even surpassed those of the Guangzhou Station. After the Chengmai Campaign ended, the Leizhou Station Elders received a Collective Second-Class Merit Medal in addition to the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign Commemorative Medal and the Chengmai Campaign Victory Medal. In terms of medal level, they ranked higher than the Guangzhou Station personnel.

News from Lingao also indicated that the Executive Committee intended to make Leizhou the first "Lingao-ized" prefecture on the mainland. The importance attached to Leizhou was evident.

For the past two years, Wen Tong had managed internal affairs and technical work in Leizhou. His energy was focused on the South China Sugar Factory, while the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild and the Leizhou Sugar Production Association were basically Chang Shide's responsibility.

After the Sugar War, the Leizhou Station successfully integrated Leizhou's sugar trade. Subsequently, Chang Shide focused mainly on sugarcane production, organizing the Leizhou Sugar Production Association. This sugarcane planting organization, modeled on the Japanese agricultural coop system, supported farmers' production by issuing loans. It not only dealt a heavy blow to local rural small-scale usury but also distributed Lingao's grain circulation coupons. This small-scale reform not only increased farmers' enthusiasm for production but also covertly controlled the local sugarcane source. In the 1630 crushing season, the South China Sugar Factory actually controlled over 90% of the sugarcane production in Xuwen and Haikang counties. Local traditional sugar sheds, except for those in a few remote areas with poor transport, suffered a devastating blow. Small loans also allowed Lingao's grain circulation coupons to begin penetrating local circulation.

For the next step, he had already agreed with the Tiandihui: the Tiandihui would send specialists to Leizhou to improve sugarcane varieties and promote new fertilizers and pesticides. But the Organization Department's sudden transfer left Chang Shide somewhat brooding. It wasn't that he clung to power—being transferred back to Lingao would certainly mean a newer, bigger appointment—but leaving the Leizhou situation half-finished felt like abandoning things halfway.

Wen Tong asked, "You're currently holding both the Secretary-General of the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild and the Chairman of the Sugar Production Association. Who will take over when you leave? The naturalized citizens can't prop up this scene yet." Since he supervised technical work, he didn't deal much with locals; it was all Chang Shide holding up the front. He feared things would fall apart once Chang left.

"Let Chen Tianxiong take it. Or ask Lingao to send another person over. I think sending someone from the Tiandihui system would be good. It's more convenient if they know the profession. Later, train up the Wen brothers. Ah Zhu and Qiu Han can be trained more too."

"All right. I'm just afraid he won't be willing." Wen Tong nodded. "Old Chen is very busy himself."

Chen Tianxiong, as the External Intelligence Bureau's dedicated intelligence officer in Leizhou, had been focused on collecting intelligence on local customs and geography in Leizhou and surrounding counties. Recently he had gone to Gaozhou. Using the cover of a Taoist priest from Monk Zou's Temple, it was safe and convenient for him to travel around as an outsider. Zhang Yingchen had taken a fancy to Chen Tianxiong's activities and specifically held a business meeting with him during the annual meeting. Thus Monk Zou's Temple became the New Taoism's first stronghold on the mainland.

Wen Tong felt Chen Tianxiong wouldn't necessarily want this position, and the matter would need approval from the External Intelligence Bureau.

"Who came up with this crazy idea? Moving people around randomly like this—is there any continuity in planning?!" Wen Tong was angry. He was someone used to doing work methodically and hated leaders giving blind orders and messing around. In his view, transferring Chang Shide now was a major blow to the sugar industry reform led by the Leizhou Station.

"Don't complain yet," Yan Maoda, true to his business background, was very composed. "A transfer is a transfer. Staying in one place too long isn't good either. Moving around is preparation for doing bigger things in the future." He actually liked this transfer—staying at the Guangzhou Station offered limited room for development, while coming to Leizhou to head Vietnam trade offered plenty of scope. "Maybe Old Chang is being sent to a better place this time."

Returning to his own courtyard, Wen Tong was still holding onto his anger. His women—now formally called maidservants—were chatting in the living room. Originally he only had Ah Zhu, whom Chang Shide helped him buy. Later Ah Zhu introduced him to a woman named Qiu Han—Qiu Han was originally Third Master Zhu's concubine. She didn't hide it, only saying that after Third Master Zhu died she had nowhere to go and begged the Master to take her in.

Wen Tong, partly due to Ah Zhu's plea and partly because Qiu Han was quite good-looking with a voluptuous figure—better looking than Ah Zhu—saw her kneeling on the ground begging humbly. His male chauvinism and compassion erupted simultaneously, and ignoring Chen Tianxiong's fierce opposition, he took her in. Chang Shide was very supportive of this—saying possessing the enemy's woman was a great pleasure.

"If she dares to speak or act out of turn, hang her up and whip her with lashes dipped in cold water. See if that doesn't make her obedient!" Chang Shide imparted his experience to Wen Tong. "The more you beat them, the more obedient they are. The less they dare to have second thoughts."

Wen Tong disagreed inwardly—he felt Old Chang's woman-handling techniques were simply fascist dictatorship, not the "militarized maidservant management" he preached. He had long harbored certain suspicions about Old Chang's sexual proclivities.

The lamps in the courtyard were lit—there was no electricity here; they burned gas lamps. Qiu Han was waiting for him at the door. Following the Elders' taste, her hair was tied loosely without a bun. She wore a waist-cinched so-called "New Hanfu." This was something Chang Shide had gotten from Zheng Shangjie when he went back for the annual meeting.

"Master." Seeing Wen Tong approach, Qiu Han hurried forward to welcome him.

Qiu Han had been a personal maid in a wealthy household and then a concubine to Third Master Zhu. She had learned a full set of serving skills, excelling in cooking and needlework. She was also skilled at gentle attentiveness. Compared to the poor fishergirl Ah Zhu, who could only serve her master with her body, Qiu Han was much more pleasing. Originally Wen Tong and Chang Shide were wary of her, but as time passed, they slowly relaxed. Gradually, Qiu Han appeared more favored. Instead, she surpassed her good sister Ah Zhu, seemingly becoming Wen Tong's number one maidservant. The days she served him alone at night became more frequent—Wen Tong wasn't accustomed to Chang Shide's heroic style of having several women serve him simultaneously.

The room had been remodeled to modern standards. Insulation and privacy were greatly improved. A gas lamp lit the room brightly. A bathroom had been installed, fitted with a Lingao-made custom double bathtub filled with steaming hot water.

Herbal bath liquid produced by the Light Industry Ministry had been added to the water, filling the bathroom with a pleasant fragrance. This was a luxury item sold with the bathroom suite. It was essentially distilled natural spices. The Light Industry Ministry's accompanying pamphlet hinted that using it in bathwater had aphrodisiac effects, causing wealthy buyers to flock to it like ducks, though it was purely a gimmick.
