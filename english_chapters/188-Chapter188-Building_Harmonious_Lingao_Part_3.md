# Chapter 188: Building a Harmonious Lingao (Part 3)

Zhang Youfu had been waiting outside the main hall. He was an old acquaintance of Xi Yazhou's. Every county interaction with the transmigrators went through him. Among all the county's landlords and gentry, he was most favorably inclined toward them—having earned considerable fees over these months.

Welcoming them into the hall, crimson candles blazed high. An eight-immortals table was set for banquet. Inside was a middle-aged scholar. Seeing Wen Desi and others enter, he stood, clasping hands in greeting, all smiles, beckoning them to be seated. His manner was extremely warm—no first-meeting awkwardness at all. Everyone understood this was today's true host.

The visitor was Wang Zhaomin, Wu Mingjin's secretary. He'd observed Xiong Buyu's entire visit from behind a screen and had reread the letter several times afterward.

Years of itinerant secretarial work had given him vast experience. The transmigrators' joint defense purpose was crystal clear to him. He estimated these baldies of unknown origin probably had the same calculations as recently amnestied Zheng Zhilong: they didn't want to be the government's enemy, but hoped to occupy a coastal base for maritime trade. Similar to Zheng Zhilong occupying Zhongsuo.

Wang Zhaomin's mind, however good, however experienced, couldn't imagine these people's true purpose was replacing Ming Dynasty. To him, not attacking the county seat showed the baldies wouldn't cross certain lines—by contrast, Zheng Zhilong had occupied imperial Zhongsuo city.

Given this premise, the baldies' demands weren't excessive. After careful consideration, Wang Zhaomin thought negotiation was possible—discussing terms and conditions. After all, they'd sent a hundred-odd genuine pirate heads as greeting gift. Sincerity was clearly sufficient.

Wu Mingjin was helpless. Unwilling but powerless, he could only temporize. So he sent Wang Zhaomin to make contact.

Landlord Zhang's banquet, by another spacetime's standards, would be pathetic to these worldly transmigrators. But for people who'd eaten fish and vegetables for months, whole chicken, whole duck, big chunks of stewed meat, plus an entire crispy golden roast suckling pig—this alone accelerated salivation among oil-starved transmigrators.

There were also fresh vegetables and plenty of wine—local liquor. But no "fresh seafood"—too abundant locally, not worth serving.

For display purposes, the eight accompanying transmigrators as guards couldn't share the table. Only Xi Yazhou and Wen Desi ate the banquet under everyone else's envious gazes.

The others squatted in the outer hall, where there was also a table. But it had only an elderly, virtuous chicken and some vegetables. A bowl of meat slices was piled high, but after each person took one slice, the rest underneath was all fried sweet potato—only 8 slices, clearly calculated per head.

But they didn't dare eat much anyway—after being terrified by Health Department doctors about parasites, they maintained wariness of locally cooked food, plus concerns about poison. Two men guarded the main gate; two more the side entrance.

After polite exchanges and several rounds of drinks, the two commissioners having eaten some suckling pig, talk turned to business. Zhang Youfu spoke first, again probing the Executive Committee's demand for villages to meet at Bairren. He offered that county gentry were willing to contribute grain and funds—just name the amount, it would be delivered on time—if only they wouldn't organize this joint militia defense.

Wen Desi asked directly: "Is this the Magistrate's position or the gentry's?"

Zhang Youfu was momentarily speechless. He looked awkwardly at Wang Zhaomin. These words were actually Secretary Wang's instructions. The gentry themselves didn't oppose organizing joint defense—Northern Lingao had long suffered pirate raids. Many local bandits colluded with pirates for highway robbery and kidnapping ransoms. Gentry and tenants suffered greatly. The gentry had somewhat lost faith in the yamen. If a powerful group was willing to lead the organization, they'd be happy.

Wang Zhaomin interjected: "Naturally the gentry's position."

Xi Yazhou smiled coldly: "The gentry's position?" He tapped the table. "December 17th, what did Wu Ya tell the elders in Meitong Village? December 20th, what did Fu Baiwen say at Nadu, Meiyang, and Meiguo villages? Just two days ago, your bailiff specifically went to Bowen Village saying 'when heavenly troops arrive, ash remains,' didn't he?"

Wang Zhaomin's heart lurched—these baldies knew the county's actions precisely. He forced a smile: "County officials inspecting the countryside is routine—"

"Inspect all you want, that's your duty." Xi Yazhou said. "Recently the county's been aggressively collecting autumn grain. Running short again?"

"Collecting imperial taxes is righteous duty. What's wrong with that?"

"Times are bad. Many pirates and bandits. We want to organize joint militia defense, but the authorities won't allow it." Xi Yazhou showed a sinister smile. "Who knows what might happen to grain convoys along the road—"

Wang Zhaomin visibly shrank. If they'd threatened to storm the city, he wouldn't be afraid—if they wanted to attack, they already would have. Why negotiate? It had to be empty bluster. But robbing grain convoys benefited the baldies while threatening Wu Mingjin's very career.

He quickly smiled: "You're all the court's good citizens. Organizing militia is for local people's benefit. This matter is discussable."

Wen Desi ate another bite of crispy suckling pig—the flavor was indeed richer than the other spacetime's. He said: "Secretary Wang, let me speak plainly. Magistrate Wu is still this county's parent official. Law-abiding good citizens like us, committed to 'protecting territory and people,' would never trouble him. Not only that, we wish him 'rapid promotion.'"

Wang Zhaomin nodded, calculations settling. He made eye contact with Zhang Youfu. Zhang quickly stood and excused himself.

Both sides lowered their voices and began secret discussion.

At first, Wang Zhaomin only agreed the yamen would tacitly permit the matter. But Wen Desi firmly refused. To him, tacit permission was the same as refusal—from another spacetime's experience, tacit permission was merely prelude to future prohibition. Though this didn't affect the transmigrators themselves, villages would have reservations.

Finally, they reached agreement: the transmigrators' organized joint militia defense would face no county obstruction. But the organizer couldn't use the transmigrators' name—it must be some village headman. Easy enough. Wen Desi proposed Damei Village as the proposer. Once the petition came in, the county would stamp approval.

The transmigrators promised: responsibility for county pirate defense, organizing bandit suppression, maintaining rural peace. Simultaneously, no interference in the yamen's routine administrative functions, and assistance with certain tasks when necessary. Such as autumn grain collection. If the county couldn't meet summer/autumn tax quotas, the transmigrators would provide assistance—assistance methods to be discussed.

The Ma'ao salt field salt tax and surcharges under transmigrator control would continue being paid, plus an additional 100 taels annually as county miscellaneous expenses. East Gate Market would pay 10 taels annual miscellaneous tax, receiving an official "broker license" recognizing its market status.

Both parties agreed: all pirate/bandit heads captured in combat would go to the county; captured seals, tokens, banners, and documents likewise. Other spoils would belong to the transmigrators.

If Officer Fu Baiwen was willing to return to Bopu as inspector, the transmigrators would allow it. They'd build him a new yamen and provide twelve archers. All expenses borne by the transmigrators.

The county would provide all legal conveniences to the transmigrators: escaping slaves, absconding debtors, property transfers, etc. Since transmigrators had no Ming household registration, Wang Zhaomin suggested establishing a "Bairren Village" with seven or eight registered households. This would give the transmigrators legal standing; otherwise, documents and contracts couldn't be written.

Finally, naturally, came personal benefits discussion. Wang Zhaomin was very keen on this, actively advocating for himself and his employer.

After bargaining, Wen Desi agreed: 300 taels of silver for Secretary Wang, 1,000 taels for Magistrate Wu. Both sides also agreed to partner in selling salt in the county seat and all fourteen county markets. The transmigrators would supply goods. Legalizing illicit salt and sales would be handled by Secretary Wang. Profits split fifty-fifty.

To avoid suspicion, both sides designated Zhang Youfu as liaison. If face-to-face meetings were needed, they'd be held at Zhang Youfu's place.

Finally, Wang Zhaomin advised Wen Desi that for future county activities, they should abandon their shaved heads and short clothes to avoid drawing attention. Wen Desi laughed it off but later thought it might be necessary—many gentry and farmer interactions lay ahead. Being too conspicuous wouldn't help integration.

With matters settled, both sides relaxed. Drinking became more enjoyable. At the height of conviviality, Wen Desi presented prepared gifts. For Magistrate Wu: an oval glass mirror. For Secretary Wang: a glass cup. For all other county officials: one freshwater pearl bracelet each—the kind sold for 5 yuan at pearl wholesale markets. According to reports from the Guangzhou advance station, their cultured freshwater pearls were very popular in Guangzhou.

Secretary Wang was naturally delighted. These baldies really understood things.

Since it was dark and city gates were closed, Secretary Wang couldn't return to the city. He'd stay at Zhang Youfu's. Wen Desi, having finished business, was in no hurry to leave. They still needed good discussions with liaison Zhang Youfu.
