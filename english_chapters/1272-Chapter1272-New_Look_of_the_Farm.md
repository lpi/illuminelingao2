# Chapter 1272: New Look of the Farm

Coming out of the house, Liu Ashui was already pulling the rickshaw and waiting in the square outside the guard room at the entrance of the residential area. This was a research and development test product of the Ministry of Light Industry's Vehicle Factory—the manpower rickshaw. Currently, only a few had been trial-produced. Because there was no rubber, the wheels made were relatively large, close to the original "Toyo rickshaw" prototype.

Originally, the Vehicle Factory really wanted to promote the Dongfeng two-wheeled carriage according to Senator Hong's idea—after the Jeju Island strategy, the supply of horses was no longer too tight. A large number of horses had been transported to Lingao for service.

However, keeping a horse specifically for pulling a cart took up space and manpower, and it ate a lot. Private use was really too expensive, and it was a bit extravagant even for Senators. So apart from a few "nouveaux riches" in Lingao, passenger carriages were only used for official business by various departments.

But there was still a huge demand for short-distance cheap transportation. Whether it was public carriages or the Lingao Urban Railway, there was a "last mile" problem.

So the Vehicle Factory settled for the second best and changed to designing and manufacturing a rickshaw. The rickshaw had a simple structure and was easy to repair. It didn't need to eat fodder and took up little space. The puller not only ate less than a horse but could also do other work besides pulling the cart.

This kind of vehicle was named "Type Zero". Type Zero applied new technologies developed, or rather "restored", by the Machinery Factory, especially adopting a new shock absorption suspension system to minimize the bumpiness caused by hard wheels. Since it was human-powered, Type Zero faced the problem of insufficient output power from the very beginning. Coupled with the heavy weight of the new shock absorption system unit, how to reduce weight became the main subject for Jiang Muzhi and Li Chiqi.

In order to make the vehicle body as light as possible, the two racked their brains during the design, trying to reduce weight in every possible place. First, the wheels were changed to steel—lighter and stronger than wooden structures; because it was human-powered and mainly used on roads, the body strength did not need to be too high. The original iron-framed wooden carriage design was canceled and replaced with hollow iron pipes to manufacture the body frame. Rattan was used to weave the body, but this body was prone to water ingress, so the improved design used bamboo strips.

The standard interior of the Type Zero included a retractable oilcloth canopy and a bell. The luxury version also had a kerosene lamp and a foot bell. Because the tail of the luxury version had a shining golden five-pointed star as a logo, it was also called the "Gold Star Type Zero".

Wu Nanhai thought this kind of vehicle was not bad—he constantly had to travel between fields and had a great demand for short-distance transportation. The bicycle he originally rode was a public vehicle of the Agricultural Committee. Now that there were more agricultural technicians and daily work was busy, it was inconvenient for him to occupy the already scarce public vehicles for his exclusive use for a long time, so he simply ordered a luxury version as a private vehicle.

The dormitory area was quite far from the Agricultural Committee office, equivalent to walking from one end to the other. The Nanhai Experimental Farm where the Agricultural Committee was located had now expanded greatly in area. Especially taking the opportunity of the last typhoon attack, the Agricultural Committee annexed a large amount of scattered land, extending the fields all the way to the school fields around the county seat, connecting these lands into one piece.

With land in hand, the Experimental Farm started major construction and added a lot of new infrastructure. Now, the Agricultural Committee's directly managed Nanhai Farm owned nearly a dozen entities: rice farms, dryland crop farms, vegetable bases, economic forest plantations, orchards, tropical crop gardens, medicinal herb gardens, nurseries, freshwater aquaculture farms, livestock breeding farms, poultry breeding farms, breeding stock and poultry farms, spawn farms, crop breeding farms, biochemical laboratories, sewage treatment plants, pesticide and fertilizer experimental factories, tea factories, veterinary stations, etc. There was also a dairy farm and vegetable garden specially set up to serve the General Office for Senators.

With all sorts of units and a large number of farm workers gathering here, a quite prosperous satellite town had actually formed by the Wenlan River.

The rickshaw pulled onto the Agricultural Committee Avenue. This was the main street of the entire Nanhai Farm. Radiating from it as the center were four branch roads connecting all units and institutions of the entire farm. After several years of development, the farm's population surged, and consequently, commercial activities on this avenue became very lively. Most of the newly built commercial premises on both sides had been rented out, bringing a considerable income to the Agricultural Committee.

Various shops on the avenue had already removed their boards for business. Wu Nanhai sighed with some regret. Originally, he wanted to set up a Rural Commercial Cooperative under the Agricultural Committee, but the Executive Committee, in order to curb strict prohibition of departments running their own businesses and engaging in "small and complete" operations, eliminated the seeds of enterprises running society. Only state-owned commercial enterprises under the Ministry of Commerce and private enterprises were allowed to conduct commercial operations.

It seemed that only the Tiandihui system, a "government-guided non-governmental cooperative organization", could "save the nation through a curvy path". Wu Nanhai calculated. Ye Yuming had talked to him several times about expanding Tiandihui's business scope. It seemed he had to seize the time to implement it.

Although it was still 7:30 in the morning, small stalls had already begun to be set up on the street, and peddlers carrying shelves began to hawk along the street.

All the peddlers' shelves hung a uniformly made standard wooden sign. This wooden sign was the mobile vendor business license recently launched by the General Administration of Taxation. Peddlers roving on the streets of towns within the entire Lingao County must hold it.

Activity areas were distinguished by the color of the wooden sign. Red meant selling was allowed in all areas, yellow meant wandering selling only in the county seat, blue meant selling was allowed in East Gate Market, and so on. Depending on the industry and area the peddler engaged in, a fixed daily business tax ranging from 7 cents to 20 cents in circulation coupons was collected.

There was a calendar pasted on the back of the business license. For every day the tax was paid, the police responsible for collection would stamp the corresponding date on the calendar. Taxes could be paid daily, or by week, month, quarter, and year, each with different discount rates. But if it was found that payment was overdue for 3 days, once caught, they would be sent to the Public Security Court for disposal. According to the "Interim General Principles of Tax Law", they would be sentenced to punitive labor in the labor camp for a number of days equal to the number of days of tax evasion multiplied by 3. So the peddlers were very enthusiastic about paying taxes in advance.

The rickshaw rolled on the road. After leaving the living area of the farm, both sides of the Agricultural Committee Avenue became open again. Running on the road were farm workers, farm carts, and machinery heading to work locations. As far as the eye could see on both sides were carefully maintained large fields, ditches, and woods. Every time Wu Nanhai passed by in the car, he would pay attention to whether the land by the roadside was fully utilized and whether the conditions of basic farmland facilities such as windbreak forests, ditches, and roads were good.

Liu Ashui walked as if flying, and soon the Agricultural Committee compound appeared in front of them. The farm office land had recently been expanded, and several new two-story and three-story buildings had been added. This made the entire building complex laid out in a "Tian" (field) character shape. The side facing the street was the office building for the Agricultural Committee, the Experimental Farm, and Tiandihui. The back building was the biochemical laboratory directly under the Agricultural Committee and the warehouses for Class I and II agricultural controlled items—as usual, managed by personnel sent by the Planning Commission.

Wu Nanhai liked this place very much, so he had constantly carried out greening transformations around it over the years, planting a large number of economically valuable arbor trees, fruit forests, and bamboo forests. Flower beds were also opened up—in addition to planting ornamental plants, various plant spices were also planted: oregano, basil, thyme, perilla...

Years of management had made the surroundings of the Agricultural Committee and the Farm office area shaded by green trees and fragrant with fruit trees. The lotus pavilion on the side had green leaves reaching the sky and ducks playing in the water. The natural environment was very beautiful. The Nanhai Cafe was located amidst this rural scenery. Of course, he also had a little selfishness. The small chapel he built personally was also hidden in the bamboo forest here. Apart from holding small-scale religious activities, it was equivalent to his small villa. He occasionally brought Chuqing here to rest and enjoy rare relaxing moments.

Entering the Agricultural Committee compound, Wu Nanhai got off the cart, thanked Liu Ashui, greeted the worker sweeping the yard, and walked towards his office with steady steps.

Wu Nanhai held multiple positions, but his most important "primary duty" was as the People's Commissar of Agriculture. He was in charge of agricultural matters and was a ministerial-level leader who could attend State Council meetings. In the Lingao regime, a Senator with high position and heavy power meant having endless work to do. Therefore, Wu Nanhai needed a large number of administrative personnel to help him handle specific affairs, forming a huge administrative team, abbreviated as: "Wu's Office".

At this moment, Zhang Xingjiao, the director of "Wu's Office", and Wang Tian, the deputy director of Nanhai Experimental Farm, were already waiting at the door of "Wu's Office" with file folders as usual.

Zhang Xingjiao and Wang Tian were both among the earliest naturalized citizens. Since defecting at Gou Family Village, Zhang Xingjiao had contributed a lot to the Senate. However, he had no fixed position and acted as a translator and consultant for a long time. Eventually, Wu Nanhai asked for him: Zhang Xingjiao was a scholar who could read and write. He was also from a peasant background and had personally participated in labor, so he was not unfamiliar with agricultural production. He was barely sufficient as a writer and general clerk for the Agricultural Committee. As for Wang Tian, when the farm was first founded, he was the head of the farm workers and the captain of the production team. In terms of ability, he was a capable and competent "foreman". Over the years, Wu Nanhai, Wan Lihui, and other agricultural Senators had taught him a lot of agricultural science and technology knowledge hand in hand, and sent him to a cultural course training class. Wang Tian lived up to expectations and obtained a Grade B diploma. Wu Nanhai appointed him as the deputy director of the farm, specifically responsible for the daily production of the farm.

However, Wu Nanhai was not quite satisfied with either of them—they were "re-educated" adults after all. Their concepts and thoughts were hard to transform thoroughly. Although they absolutely obeyed orders, there were always some distortions in execution, and sometimes they simply couldn't understand. In comparison, he still valued the group of young people under 20 who came out of the administrative training class more. But they were still a bit green and needed some time to tough it out.

Note: The names of Jin Wushun and Liushun in Section 45 were reversed and have been corrected.
