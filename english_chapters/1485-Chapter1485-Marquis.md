# Chapter 1485 - Marquis

The group fled the casting and forging workshop. Perhaps on Hale's instructions, or due to prior preparation, several native workers were already waiting outside holding tea buckets. The black tea imported from Lingao, with a little sugar added and chilled with well water, felt refreshing to drink. As soon as the Spaniards caught their breath, Hale dragged them on without pause. The next target was the machining workshop, built adjacent to the river channel and giant water wheels. Compared to the suffocating casting and forging workshop, the workshop was filled with the pleasant smell of freshly cut timber. The Philippines certainly didn't lack wood; excellent textured striped hardwood, worth tens of thousands in a certain East Asian country in later generations, was sawn here to make machine tool frames, bases, transmission shafts, or even cargo tracks paved on the ground. Filling people's ears were the squeaking and banging of transmission shafts and gears, and the screech of cutting tools and drills biting into metal. Although somewhat noisy and piercing, it was absolutely not as deafening as the noise in the hellish casting and forging workshop. The Spanish gentlemen seemed to recover some spirit, circling the massive boring lathes built for cannon making, uttering clicks of admiration.

Around the drilling and boring machines, native workers walked about occasionally, holding wooden shovels to shovel flying iron filings into baskets, ready to send them back for remelting. Marcos knew that over seventy percent of the iron and nearly ninety percent of the copper currently imported by the Spanish Philippine colony was consumed in this factory. Of course, what Manila citizens cared most about was the large sums of silver pesos it swallowed. But Governor Salamanca was the exact opposite: whether iron, copper, or silver, he sought to double the investment into this gold-swallowing beast of a munitions factory, as long as the golden eggs it laid could bring glory and promotion to himself and his allies in officialdom. Commodore Marquis Don Juan de Baza y Cordova had come precisely for this.

The Marquis grabbed a handful of iron filings from the ground, rubbing them in his hand. His pristine white silk glove immediately showed a large black stain. It was covered in soapy water used as lubricant and coolant, slippery with disgusting foam soaking the glove. Iron filings pricked the skin of his palm, hard and rough, as if reminding him they were planed and peeled from the mother body by even harder and sharper steel drills. As a senior naval officer, the Lord Marquis was no stranger to naval cannon foundries in Seville and Liérganes; he had also traveled to France, Germany, and Venice, visiting weapon manufacturing workshops there. Prototypes of these machines seemed to exist in European workshops. But discussing scale, precision, and high efficiency, comparing those European goods to the miraculous works designed by this Japanese priest was barely like comparing children's toys. Even among Europe's most renowned cannon casting experts, who would believe one could forcefully "hollow out" a cannon bore from a solid iron blank with a boring bar?

Marquis Bazan threw down the dirty wet glove and picked up a fresh pair of white silk gloves from the wooden tray a follower carried all the way. However, inner excitement caused his hands to tremble uncontrollably, unable to put them on. The Marquis threw the new gloves back into the wooden tray. "What is that?" He crossed his arms, pointing to a machine tool equipped with a spiral cutter ahead.

"It is a machine for making rifling."

"Rifling—" Marquis Bazan repeated this unfamiliar word. It was evident he was interested, yet he tried hard to maintain a dignified expression, not letting ignorant doubt show on his face.

The Japanese priest seemed to suddenly open a chatterbox, beginning to talk eloquently about various scientific theories, stretching from the principle of the Archimedean spiral to planetary rotation. The Commodore listened as if in a fog, vaguely seeming to understand a little: rifling designed according to spiral and rotation principles would increase shell accuracy more than tenfold. If gunners were equipped with telescopes, rifled cannons could even precisely destroy warships sailing a league away.

Equipping gunners with telescopes was rather extravagant; telescopes in Europe weren't cheap these days. But a cannon with a range exceeding one league that could precisely hit a ship was too shocking for this era.

"The problem lies with the shell," an artillery officer said. "Spiral rifled cannons have already proved their power in the Pangasinan suppression campaign. That is truly a terrible weapon of genius invention. It has only one drawback: only shells manufactured very precisely in size and shape can match the rifling. Manufacturing such shells is undoubtedly quite difficult. We could make do with those old-style round cannonballs in new cannons, but then it would be impossible to achieve the effect Mr. Paul claims.

"You are absolutely right." Hale immediately took up the thread. "I have devised a method. Using precision machines to manufacture precision objects is far more efficient than relying on manual manufacturing of clumsy things. Gentlemen, please follow me to watch how machines arc used to manufacture shells. Marcos, take us to the front."

In a corner of the mechanical processing workshop sat two small lathes powered by animal traction. Shell blanks transported from the casting workshop were ground and shaped here, and threads for installing fuzes were cut into the shell nose. Several selected Chinese workers carefully checked finished products with special calipers. Hale took one from the inspected shells, displayed it to the guests, asking them to imagine the terrifying scene when the hollow warhead filled with gunpowder or canister shot exploded, controlled by a fuze screwed into the nose.

"Spiral rifled artillery must form a tight fit with the shell used; its entire superiority stems from this. The most basic principle is there must be no gap between shell and bore; all thrust generated by gunpowder explosion is used to push the shell, not leaking and wasted through gaps like in smoothbore guns. Only when the projectile body completely fits the bore can it obtain friction from the spiral rifling, forming a stable spin motion perpendicular to the flight line. As for smoothbore guns, due to the existence of gaps, from the moment of ignition, the ball rolls along an irregular path in the bore. This chaotic rolling continues from the bore into the air. The final result is, one simply cannot foresee where the shell will roll to land."

Hale grew more excited as he spoke. Since coming to this spacetime, he rarely had such an opportunity to display his technical authority and advanced nature before a crowd: "Muzzle-loading rifled guns have two contradictory principles. To load the shell into the bore quickly and effortlessly means the friction between the two cannot be too great, but this violates the first principle that there must be no gap between shell and bore. If it were a breech-loading gun, this contradiction wouldn't exist; just making the shell slightly larger than the bore diameter would suffice, but we currently cannot manufacture reliable large breech-loading guns. To solve the contradiction, the method I first thought of was a chemical mortar-style shell—oh, you don't know what a chemical mortar is? Um—that is a kind of... anyway, a quite terrible mortar. The shell is the elongated cone you saw at the Cavite Naval Fortress, with a steel disk inlaid at the bottom, connected to the shell by a ring made of copper. When the explosive force of gunpowder pushes the steel disk, it presses forward against the copper ring. As a result, the softer copper ring expands outward to fit the bore."

"Simply too marvelous," Marquis Bazan listened entranced, unable to help sighing.

"But this is still too complex, unfavorable for production. So initially our shell production couldn't keep up with the number of newly cast cannons. I constantly tried to improve. What you see here is the result of my recent concept. Doesn't this shell look somewhat like an elongated water droplet? Look, we cut away a layer of the projectile body below the centering part. This part of the projectile will be entirely wrapped by a material that can expand under thrust, and it is much cheaper than copper."

"What material?"

"Papier-mâché."

"Paper?" The Commodore asked suspiciously. Incredible expressions appeared on several officers' faces.

"Yes, strictly speaking, it is paper pulp."

Prepared papier-mâché pulp was poured into special molds, wrapping the lower half of the projectile. After demolding, it needed drying and compressing. Finally, workers would trim the papier-mâché sabot surface with scrapers and calibrate the warhead outer diameter one by one with calipers. After completing all this, the shell would be sent to the charging workshop.

"Then Mr. Paul, may I presume to offer you congratulations, congratulating you on having solved the new shell production volume problem?" Standing by the stove in the drying room, Marquis Bazan asked, looking at the sabot shells packed densely on the drying rack.

"Currently, there are still some defects in factory operation. First, lack of labor, especially workers skilled in operating machines. So currently we can only manufacture about 100 explosive shells and canister shells a day." Marcos sucked in a breath of cold air. Hale's production figure included a large number of unfireable rejects; actual daily output was less than one-third.

The arsenal's operating efficiency was very poor; both Hale and Marcos knew this well.

Hale, however, continued to brag with composure: "As long as sufficient manpower and supplies can be provided, we can increase shell production by 3 to 4 times. It would be best to have more Chinese. The time and energy spent training a Chinese to operate a machine is 5 times less than training a native, and work efficiency is 5 times higher. If His Majesty shows favor and bestows European craftsmen familiar with instrument manufacturing skills, that would be even better. We have recruited some German craftsmen to undertake important technical work now, but regrettably, there are still too few—there is only one instrument craftsman from Augsburg in the factory. All precision optical instruments and shell fuzes rely on his skill. He also repairs clocks. His skill is impeccable, but the problem is he really can't handle all the work."
