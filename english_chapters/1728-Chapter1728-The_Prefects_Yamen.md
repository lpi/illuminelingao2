# Chapter 1728: The Prefect's Yamen

Kneeling in the very front was the original Vice Prefect of Guangzhou, Wei Bifu. Seeing the Hair-shorn thief superior exit the sedan, he hurriedly said loudly: "Wei Bifu and the civil and military surrendered persons of Guangzhou pay respects to Lord Liu."

Only then did Liu Xiang notice the large group of people in front of the screen wall. Seeing that those kneeling below numbered several dozen, all prostrating themselves on the ground, not daring even to breathe loudly, he couldn't help but feel his "official addiction" swelling. He coughed once and said: "Who are those kneeling?"

Wei Bifu hurriedly said: "Your guilty servant Wei Bifu leads the civil and military surrendered persons of one prefecture and two counties of Guangzhou to wait upon Your Excellency here."

Liu Xiang saw that this Wei Bifu was white-haired with a completely white beard. A man of such advanced age was still trying hard to put on a servile manner. He couldn't help but sigh secretly: fame and fortune were truly great things for wearing down a person! He said: "You all rise and speak."

Wei Bifu took the lead, trembling as he stood up. The group of surrendered persons behind him also stood up, each respectfully bowing with lowered backs, not daring to look up.

The Vice Prefect was the assistant official of the Prefect, generally responsible for a specific area of affairs. In a prefecture, it was already a considerable position. However, the fact that the highest-ranking official to surrender in Guangzhou Prefecture was only a Vice Prefect made Liu Xiang somewhat disappointed. Although the External Intelligence Bureau had already said that not many local officials would surrender, Liu Xiang still very much hoped that the Guangzhou Prefect could surrender.

"Where is the Prefect?"

Wei Bifu's body trembled slightly. He said: "Reporting to Your Excellency, the Old Master Dong... stubbornly resisted the Heavenly Army and has already committed suicide by poison in the rear quarters..."

This Prefect Dong had only been in office for less than half a year. Being able to come to Guangzhou to serve as Prefect was a plum assignment in both Ming and Qing. No one expected it would become a death sentence.

"There are quite a few officials in Guangzhou Prefecture. How come there are only you few?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency, many of them are incorrigible people. Some committed suicide to resist the Heavenly Army, and others abandoned their posts and are of unknown whereabouts."

Liu Xiang nodded and said: "Let's go in and have a look."

When Zhu Yuanzhang was in power, he formulated the "National Standards for Construction of Government Offices at All Levels," so the yamens of prefectures and counties throughout the country were basically built according to the same format. When Liu Xiang had traveled in the past, he had visited the Hongtong County Yamen and the Nanyang Prefecture Yamen. After arriving in this time-space, he had also toured the county and prefectural yamens on Hainan Island. Apart from differences in size and the refinement of the architecture, the basic format was the same.

But this was his first time receiving a prefectural yamen as a victor, and the feeling was different.

Wei Bifu hurriedly said: "Allow this humble official to lead the way for Your Excellency."

With Wei Bifu leading the way in front, the front of the screen wall was a memorial archway inscribed "Proclaiming and Publicizing Memorial." On the left and right were the "Clarification Pavilion" and the "Commendation Pavilion." After entering the gate, there was an interior screen wall, the so-called Xiao Wall. Circling around the Xiao Wall to the courtyard, they saw the second gate, the Ceremonial Gate. There were two courtyards on the left and right of the Ceremonial Gate. The east was the Guest Reception Hall, and the west was the Judiciary Office, with also a Land God Temple. Liu Xiang saw five or six corpses lying in front of the Judiciary Office and was startled, asking: "What happened here?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency, the Heavenly Army released all prisoners from the prefectural prison and killed several jailers..." Wei Bifu said apprehensively.

"The prisoners?" Liu Xiang realized something was wrong when he heard this. There was no such rule in the takeover plan.

"The Heavenly Army has released them all..."

Liu Xiang's face changed color. He couldn't help but whisper: "Nonsense!"

Although Wei Bifu didn't hear what he said, he saw that his expression suddenly became very unpleasant. Not knowing what had touched his reverse scale, he was afraid in his heart and hurriedly bowed even lower.

Liu Xiang couldn't be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He called over a naturalized citizen cadre beside him: "Go to the Security Command immediately and convey my order: anyone seen on the streets wearing prisoner's clothing or barely clothed, suspected of escaping from prison, is to be arrested without exception."

"Yes! Chief!"

Whenever there was a rebellion, every conquered city would "release all prisoners" to show contempt for the old authority, demonstrate benevolent governance, and also expand their own forces. But for the Senate, it was not the same thing. Even if there were many innocent people imprisoned, and many were locked up for trivial "crimes," there were also plenty of genuine "criminals," from bandits and robbers to murderers and petty thieves... Besides, the Guangzhou Prefecture prison was different from the county jails of Shunde and Nanhai. The prisoners were from over a dozen prefectures and counties in the entire Guangzhou Prefecture. Once these people were released directly into society, without money to go home and without food or clothing, they would immediately become an unstable factor in social security.

When formulating the city entry plan this time, Liu Xiang had specifically instructed that the policy for taking over the prefectural and county prisons was to "accept as is, temporarily not process." Unexpectedly, it had still been messed up by someone.

He then asked: "Which unit was responsible for the takeover here? Get the commanding officer to come see me!"

Wei Bifu saw his expression was unfriendly and hurriedly stood further back. But he saw the "Fake Hair-shorn" officer who had been the first to enter the prefectural yamen jog over, stand at attention in front of the Chief, and raise his hand to his forehead—this was the military salute of the Hair-shorn thieves. He heard him say loudly:

"Platoon Leader of 1st Platoon, Battle Line 4th Company, 4th Infantry Battalion, Second Lieutenant Wu Baliu."

"Was it you who smashed the prefectural prison, killed the jailers, and released the prisoners?"

"Yes!" Wu Baliu said loudly, "It was simply not a place fit for humans. It was a living hell. The prisoners' hands and feet were clamped in the rack and had rotted until maggots were growing. I saw several corpses wrapped in reed mats in the back, all bleeding from seven orifices—the prisoners said they were all killed by jailers who had secretly taken money in the past few days... I was furious! Is there any justice in this? So I killed the jailers and released all the prisoners!" After saying this, he still seemed a bit smug, as if he had enforced justice on behalf of Heaven.

"You're confused!" Liu Xiang bellowed. Seeing the other party's astonished eyes, he then realized his reaction was too intense. He softened his tone and said: "The jailers abused the prisoners and tortured them to death. They have their deserved punishment. The prisoners may include those wrongly accused and those who suffered injustice. They also need to be distinguished one by one. This is the work of the National Police and the courts, not your job!" He took a breath. "This prison has good and bad people. You released all the prisoners at once. Where do those whose relatives were killed, whose money and property were stolen and robbed, go to find justice? Who told you that everyone in prison is a good person?"

"This..." Wu Baliu scratched his head, annoyed. "I didn't think it through."

"How many prisoners did you release?"

"I didn't... didn't count..." He stammered, "When we opened the prison door, a lot of people rushed out all at once. Now there are only about a dozen left in the prison, those with wounds from punishment and the sick... Chief... Chief... did I make a mistake..."

Liu Xiang said: "Your mistake will be handled by the army. Return to your unit now and wait for the National Army to take over." Then he turned to Wei Bifu and said: "Let's continue."

Wei Bifu felt slightly relieved and didn't dare to flatter haphazardly anymore. He just led the way in front. Passing through the Ceremonial Gate, they could see a pavilion in the middle of the walkway in the courtyard, named the "Admonition Stone Pavilion." This was also a format formulated by Zhu Yuanzhang. Liu Xiang knew that the inside of the stone facing the main hall was carved: "Your salary and your emolument are the grease and marrow of the people; the common people are easily abused, but Heaven is not easily deceived." The outside was carved with the three characters "Justice Begets Clarity."

The east and west sides of the main hall courtyard were lined with clerk offices. The east was the Documents Office (managing the sending and receiving of documents and other matters); the west was the Archives Office (managing the examination of files from the six departments). Behind the main hall was what Liu Xiang was most concerned about—the Shelf Archive—which had already been sealed with seals and was guarded by soldiers. All other places were also sealed.

Liu Xiang asked a few questions and learned that the Treasury (prefectural treasury) had also been sealed and guarded by soldiers. The two places in the prefectural yamen he was most concerned about had no problems, so he was relieved.

Behind the main hall was the second hall used for hearing ordinary cases. Passing through the second hall, they arrived at the Flower Hall—this was already the residential part of the government office. The Flower Hall was where the chief officer held public and private banquets and received guests. Some cases unsuitable for public hearing were sometimes also conducted here. Therefore, its arrangement was more domestic and not as solemn as the main hall and second hall.

However, at this moment, the chairs in the Flower Hall were in disarray, a complete mess. Several corpses were laid out on the ground, all covered with white cloth. Naturalized citizen clerks were standing guard beside them.

"This is—"

"This is the Old Master Dong... and his family's bodies. We are waiting for Your Excellency's inspection." Wei Bifu hurriedly said.

Liu Xiang nodded. The coroner waiting on the side lifted the white cloth and said ingratiatingly: "Your Excellency, please see. It is indeed death by poison."

The deceased Prefect was a middle-aged man, not portly, even somewhat haggard. He was probably not from a wealthy family. Liu Xiang remembered that Lin Baiguang had told him that Old Master Dong had been quite close to the Guangzhou Station, receiving "gifts" and "stipends" from Guo Yi without hesitation, and turning a blind eye to the Senate's affairs in Guangzhou. He had originally thought that someone like Old Master Dong would surrender. He didn't expect he would commit suicide so decisively.

"Master Dong's attendant is waiting in the corridor. Do you want to call him in for questioning?" Wei Bifu asked.

"Yes."

Wei Bifu hurriedly waved to the bottom of the Flower Hall steps. A middle-aged man rushed in from the corridor, first kneeling on the ground and kowtowing to Liu Xiang: "Greetings to the Great Lord."

"Stand up." Liu Xiang waved his hand. "You are Master Dong's attendant?"

"Yes, this slave is Dong Qing."

"Do you recognize the several corpses here?"

"Yes, they were all prepared for burial by this slave and this slave's woman personally." Dong Qing had a sad expression on his face. "Master Dong, Madam Dong, Madam Dong's personal maid, and Master Dong's nephew. They all committed suicide by poison."

Liu Xiang sighed, waved his hand and instructed: "Find some coffins and have them encoffined as soon as possible."

"Yes, thank you for Your Excellency's grace." Dong Qing knelt down again and kowtowed loudly several times.

Liu Xiang asked again: "Is there anyone else in his family?"

Before Dong Qing could answer, Wei Bifu spoke up: "There is also an aunt and a young lady. Plus a few maids and servants. They are all being held in the back. This humble official had someone keep watch over them and forbade them from committing suicide, awaiting Your Excellency's decision."

"Oh?" Liu Xiang was a bit surprised. He had participated in pacification wars and had broken through many strongholds of landlords and powerful families. After every stronghold was taken, for fear of being humiliated, not only the family members of the masters, but even the maids and servants would commit suicide. So every time a stronghold was taken, special squads had to be dispatched to intercept and persuade them.
