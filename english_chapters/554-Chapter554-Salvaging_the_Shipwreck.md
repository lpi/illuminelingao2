# Chapter 554 - Salvaging the Shipwreck

The thick case file on Matter A was now brought to the conference table. Gao Xiaosong, who had been in charge of the matter at the time, cleared his throat and began describing the events from beginning to end. The Eight-Person Conference listened to the detailed briefing about the sunken ship.

After Zhou Weisen and the others had completed their investigation, the Executive Committee approved the decision to salvage items from the wreck. A secret salvage team was assembled, composed primarily of personnel from the Navy and the Long-Range Exploration Team, as well as those who had previously participated in surveying the sunken vessel.

Beyond salvaging items, the salvage team also had a mission to establish a temporary support base on Dongsha Island in preparation for subsequent salvage operations. Of course, in the official mission bulletin, this operation's purpose was described as "feasibility study for guano mining and establishing a transit consideration base for Taiwan navigation."

The salvage party—consisting of one motor-sail vessel, one large sailing ship, and several rowboats—arrived at Dongsha Island. Only then did Gao Xiaosong, who was in charge of salvage operations, reveal the true purpose of the trip to the participants. Some transmigrators who had been kept in the dark were shocked speechless. Everyone agreed: these people posed a major threat to the transmigrator collective. If they couldn't "come over to the light" in time, they would be resolutely eliminated!

However, everyone also looked forward to the upcoming task—a ship was a treasure trove for the transmigrator collective. A seagoing vessel was a mobile little world; even a fishing boat would have many useful tools and supplies aboard.

The mystique of this particular vessel sparked everyone's speculation. According to Lin Chuanqing, this ship was most likely a smuggling vessel dealing in illicit goods—either drugs or weapons.

This speculation raised everyone's excitement. If it was an arms-smuggling ship, they'd hit the jackpot! The SKS rifle was considered too ugly by many, not to mention it was only semi-automatic. Everyone hoped to find large quantities of AK-47s or better—maybe machine guns.

Although Lin Chuanqing mentioned the ship might be carrying drugs, everyone still unanimously believed it carried weapons.

The excited "leaders" left the carefully selected native naval personnel in the fleet puzzled, unable to understand what about this desolate little island could make them so happy.

Driven by the fervor of potentially acquiring weapons, work proceeded rapidly. Standardized lightweight trestle bridges were quickly constructed along the shore. A Marine platoon searched the entire island. After confirming it was uninhabited, they established a temporary camp in a sheltered coconut grove, then sent people to secure the wells.

Salvage operations and the survival of over a hundred people on the island both required fresh water. The island's well water wasn't purely fresh, so a temporary distillation station was set up beside the well specifically for desalination.

Salvage work proceeded smoothly. Despite lacking professional salvage equipment and sufficient diving gear—with only two qualified divers—everyone's efforts and the stimulation of their fervor meant that over a dozen or more days of salvage activity had gradually retrieved all the sundry items, tools, and equipment from the ship. Even the worn-out automobile tires used as bumpers on the hull were removed.

Salvaged items were first soaked in fresh water to remove salt, then air-dried in special shaded shelters. Items were inspected by dedicated personnel, catalogued, and packed into crates for storage.

The items recovered were a hodgepodge, but what everyone most wanted to find—weapons—still hadn't turned up.

"Those compartments haven't been opened yet," Zhou Weisen said. "If there's anything, it'll be in there."

Although using simple tools underwater to unlock sealed cabin doors was extremely difficult, Zhou Weisen and Lin Chuanqing managed to use tools to open one compartment. The small cabin was stacked with large green tarps. Zhou Weisen pulled back the tarps, revealing long rectangular iron crates stacked neatly beneath.

Zhou Weisen expended great effort to drag out a small crate. It was extremely heavy. The two of them struggled mightily to bring the crate out of the compartment and float it to the surface using flotation bags.

When the crate was opened, it caused a cheer: inside were handguns in individual packaging boxes, twelve in total, each with four magazines. The crate hadn't taken on any water, and the guns were very well preserved.

"It's a SIG P226!" someone in the crowd called out.

"It's a CZ99," Zhou Weisen, who had shot countless guns in America, immediately recognized it. "Yugoslav make!" He picked one up, racked the slide, and confirmed again.

"Yugoslavia?" No one had much concept of weapons made by this country that no longer existed.

"This is a good gun," Zhou Weisen said, expertly loading a magazine. "Fifteen-round magazine, strong firepower."

Weapons had been found, but not the automatic weapons everyone had most hoped for. There was some disappointment. Lin Chuanqing said, "Don't lose heart! Since there are handguns, there'll be other weapons. At the very least, we'll salvage a lot of 9mm Parabellum ammunition."

But retrieving weapon crates from the compartments was extremely difficult. Wreck diving required excellent skills; ordinary people couldn't do it. Even someone like Lin Chuanqing with some diving experience was only making up the numbers. Let alone carrying heavy weapon crates through narrow passages and hatches.

After several consecutive dives, Zhou Weisen and Lin Chuanqing completely exhausted their strength. They managed to bring up a few more crates containing military supplies and ammunition. One crate held NATO 7.62mm rounds. This greatly encouraged everyone—the cargo most likely included rifles chambered for this ammunition. Zhou Weisen believed there might be FAL automatic rifles or M14s.

After discussion, everyone agreed that relying on diving for retrieval was too inefficient. The wreck's interior was dim and cramped, making thorough searching impossible and dangerous. It would be best to raise the entire vessel in one effort and then search it.

Lin Chuanqing particularly advocated raising the ship as soon as possible. As a former fishing vessel captain, he knew the shipboard equipment well. Some specialized equipment on this ship had already been damaged. If they could raise it quickly, they could salvage a large portion of the loss. In particular, the engine room equipment—the longer it soaked in seawater, the more severe the damage. By the time they raised it later, it would only be good as scrap steel for remelting.

"Seawater corrosion of the hull materials is also quite severe. Marine organisms have already started attaching to the hull. After a few more months of soaking, even if we raise it, the ship will be ruined!" Lin Chuanqing warned.

Gao Xiaosong communicated with the Executive Committee via radio, requesting expedited salvage of the vessel. The Executive Committee held an emergency consultation on this issue and ultimately decided to raise the wreck. An 8154 trawler was specially dispatched to assist.

For recovering a vessel of less than a hundred tons from depths of less than 10 meters, the simplest method would be using a crane hoist. Unfortunately, the transmigrator collective had no crane of sufficient capacity. Heavy ship-mounted gantry cranes and derricks would have been suitable, but they were installed on the *Fengcheng* and couldn't be used.

Lin Chuanqing suggested a method of sealing leaks, then pumping water out of the hull while blowing in compressed air. With increased air inside the hull, buoyancy would increase and the vessel could be directly floated up. This salvage method required underwater leak-sealing technology. The transmigrator collective had no such technology, but this vessel had only opened its seacocks—the hull and all watertight compartment doors were intact. The vessel's tonnage was small, making this method entirely viable.

The final decision was to adopt this relatively simple salvage method. Equipment and spare diving gear were urgently shipped from Lingao. Lin Chuanqing and Zhou Weisen risked several dives deep into the ship's compartments to locate and close the seacocks one by one. Fortunately, Lin Chuanqing's experience working on American fishing vessels gave him thorough knowledge of valve locations and closing procedures.

After nearly a month of intense labor, the American fishing vessel finally rose slowly from the churning waves amid the spray, drawing cheers from the onlookers.

Once the vessel surfaced, the pumping slowed. Small boats positioned alongside monitored the draft on both sides and fore and aft, guarding against capsizing from pumping too fast. Once the hull was fully righted, it was towed alongside the large sailing ship. Lin Chuanqing boarded the wreck and manually lowered the anchor chain.

Everyone wanted to board this mysterious sunken ship for a closer look, but Gao Xiaosong ordered that no one except search personnel be allowed aboard, to prevent anyone from damaging items. Everyone had to continue watching from shore.

Under Lin Chuanqing's guidance, several transmigrators conducted a carpet search of the entire vessel. They found many supplies and equipment that had gone undiscovered during the dives, and the iron crates in several locked compartments were all offloaded.

Several crates were opened in succession. The contents varied widely—besides the previously discovered handguns, there were cartridges, magazines, and the like. Just no AKs. Not only no AKs, but not a single rifle in sight. Just as disappointment set in, someone suddenly called out:

"Found it!"

Everyone gathered around. In a newly opened crate, rifles had been found.

"Is this an AK?" someone asked.

The gun looked rather strange—an AK47-style body fitted with a straight box magazine. The proportions seemed somewhat off.

"Should be some variant of the AK." Gao Xiaosong found the gun unfamiliar, but its shape was definitely AK-like. Key components like the receiver closely resembled the AK.

Although Gao Xiaosong was a soldier, his actual knowledge of weapons was far inferior to amateur enthusiasts. He was quite unfamiliar with any automatic rifle outside the AK and M16 families. Moreover, Zhou Weisen and Lin Chuanqing were firearms enthusiasts from the world's largest light weapons market—America—and were extremely knowledgeable about small arms.

"This is the M77B1 automatic rifle," Lin Chuanqing said. "Essentially an AKM automatic rifle chambered for NATO 7.62mm," Zhou Weisen added. "Also made in Yugoslavia."

"So the arms dealers were trafficking Yugoslav weapons—a strange choice."
