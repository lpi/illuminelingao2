# Chapter 2586 - Investigation (Part 9)

Several people nearby couldn't hold back. Two men who looked like local rich farmers each paid for a crate. Seeing only a few crates of goods left on the boat, some neighboring drinking buddies began discussing pooling money to buy a crate—"group buying" in old-timeline terms.

A merchant beside Yuan Shuzhi also seemed quite tempted, muttering about wanting to get a few bottles to present to his father-in-law. He pulled Yuan Shuzhi to join the "group buy" for a crate.

With such a windfall right before his eyes, Old Yuan clutched the few yuan in manuscript fees he'd earned from magazine submissions, his expression fierce—clearly his heart was in turmoil. He normally enjoyed a drink or two, but high-end goods like Peerless Patriot could only be wishful thinking. With his income, he absolutely couldn't afford it. When colleagues gathered for drinks, they often talked about how this wine was heavenly and unparalleled—but he'd never tasted it even once.

Today, dazed and confused, egged on by the fellow next to him talking about group buying, surrounded by the surging crowd all rushing to buy, he hesitantly was about to hand over the three silver coins in his robe. In hindsight, it was like being possessed.

Just at that moment, someone suddenly patted his shoulder, and a voice sounded in his ear: "Traveler! Why are you still here? We're about to depart!"

Yuan Shuzhi snapped alert. He turned to see it was the old man who'd been sitting beside him. At that moment he suddenly realized—this was a "setup"! He immediately stuffed the money back, mumbling: "Oh dear, I almost missed the boat!" With that, he followed the old man and squeezed out of the crowd.

Behind them, the commotion continued. Before long, the dozen-plus crates of wine on that cargo boat were sold out. The crowd dispersed, and the orphans and widow quickly packed up and boarded the boat, pushing off within moments.

Yuan Shuzhi returned to the passenger boat and plopped down, saying to the old man: "Thank you, elder, for your warning! Truly enlightening! I nearly fell for their trick!"

The old man said: "Presumably you also saw through it..."

"Yes, I was suspicious from the start, but I'm normally fond of drink. They had my number, and before I knew it I'd fallen into the trap. Truly, those in the game are blind." Yuan Shuzhi sighed. "These swindlers are truly despicable!"

"Human hearts have been treacherous since ancient times." The old man consoled him. "You're traveling alone to Huizhou, a stranger in a strange land—be more careful."

"Thank you, elder."

The rest of the journey passed without incident. The boat reached Huizhou. Through their exchanges, Yuan Shuzhi and the old man beside him had become quite familiar. He learned the old man was surnamed Gao, a Huizhou native. However, he wasn't Hakka, nor Cantonese—his ancestral home was Chaoshan, and only his grandfather's generation had migrated to settle in Huizhou, making a living growing, gathering, and trading medicinal herbs.

Chance encounters on a journey called for speaking only three parts of one's truth. The old man was vague, and Yuan Shuzhi didn't probe deeply. When they reached the Huizhou dock, they exchanged well-wishes and parted ways.

Yuan Shuzhi had been traveling for a long time and didn't dare delay. He checked into a room at the designated Qiwei inn, then quietly went to see the local investigation team leader.

The investigation team that departed from Guangzhou had arrived in Huizhou several days earlier. Though no Elder led the group, the matter was serious, so they received enthusiastic reception from the county director.

This county director was none other than Liu Yixiao, former Danzhou county director. Ever since the scandal of a work team being completely wiped out on Danzhou territory, Liu Yixiao had been lying low there. As soon as the mainland campaign began, he applied for transfer to Guangdong—anywhere would do. Just to leave that sorrowful place.

Now hearing that the visitors were investigating the Senate's drug leakage case, Liu Yixiao knew the matter was important and didn't dare be careless. He immediately summoned the team leader Lu Cheng, expressing he would fully support the team's work. As for the naturalized citizen medical personnel they needed, he could arrange that immediately.

The doctor personally selected by Zheng Mingjiang was named Zheng Xiaoyu. He was originally one of her prized students. After being assigned to Huizhou, he actually controlled all of Huizhou's medical, epidemic prevention, and pharmaceutical work—holding considerable power.

Zheng Xiaoyu had already received Zheng Mingjiang's letter by this point. He immediately joined the team and began secretly investigating the fake medicine matter.

Having worked in Huizhou for a long time, he'd long heard that Australian miracle drugs were sold at the Luofu Mountain medicine market, but he hadn't connected this with drug leakage. Because medicines flying the "Australian miracle drug" banner had appeared at the market even before the Senate recovered Guangzhou. So nobody had thought anything of it.

So when Lu Cheng mentioned that Lushi Powder contained sulfonamide components, Zheng Xiaoyu's jaw nearly dropped.

"There's actually such a thing!" He said in shock. "I know this Lushi Powder—it's been sold locally for two or three years. It's renowned for miraculous effects. I thought it was just some traditional Chinese medicine proven remedy—I never imagined it had such secrets."

"This medicine really comes from here?"

"That's right," Zheng Xiaoyu was very certain. "This Lushi Powder is sold at the medicine market by a label called 'Wanchun Quan.' It's an old local pharmacy."

Lu Cheng perked up upon hearing there was a brand name. Because up until now, the various Lushi Powders they'd collected from the market all had different labels, but none was called Wanchun Quan.

"So it's being sold openly."

"Correct. As for the other medicines on the list, I've occasionally seen them too—mostly sold by traveling peddlers. Their origins won't be easy to trace. As for that fetus-changing medicinal wine—honestly, I've never seen it. But it's hard to say—this medicine market is a mixed bag with all sorts. Especially the ghost market, which sells everything..."

"Wait—the medicine market has a ghost market?" Lu Cheng was surprised.

Ghost markets existed everywhere by that name—typically markets trading in the dead of night or at dawn, selling mostly counterfeit goods, stolen property, or "cursed items." In short, things that couldn't be traded openly.

"That's right. They mostly sell all kinds of strange 'miraculous pills,' or else things like 'wild man's head' or 'dragon liver and phoenix marrow.'" Zheng Xiaoyu smiled bitterly. "Nothing legitimate. But I must say, sometimes you hear of people buying rare medicinal materials there. In any case, those waters run very, very deep."

From the investigation team's preliminary understanding, the Luofu Mountain medicine market was indeed a distribution center for Australian miracle drugs. They'd even discovered the source of Lushi Powder. This was nothing short of a major breakthrough. Lu Cheng was greatly energized and immediately held meetings non-stop, discussed, formulated plans, assigned tasks—preparing for a thorough investigation of the medicine market.

By the time Yuan Shuzhi's arrival was reported to the investigation team, Lu Cheng's related plans were already complete and ready for implementation. But Yuan Shuzhi was personally selected by Elder Zheng, so they had to consult with him regardless.

Unexpectedly, when they asked him to come to the county government, Old Yuan said he was doing "undercover work" and shouldn't openly enter and exit government offices. He suggested meeting at a certain place "in the form of a gathering for a meal."

Lu Cheng silently cursed a few choice phrases, but with the "undercover" label on him, his request didn't seem unreasonable. She immediately reserved a private room at a restaurant outside Huizhou city walls that Yuan Shuzhi had specified, meeting there.

This establishment's specialty was lychee wood roasted honey intestines—done sweet, crispy, and tender with distinctive flavor. It was somewhat famous locally. The investigation team members arrived and took seats in the private room, ordered some rice noodle soup, had the honey intestines roasted and sliced, and ordered a bottle of local moonshine before beginning their discussion.

Yuan Shuzhi listened to their investigation results from the past few days, was silent for a long while, and finally spoke: "What's the background of this Wanchun Quan?"

"It's a century-old establishment." Zheng Xiaoyu said. "At the medicine market, they specialize in wholesale of various prepared medicines. Many traveling doctors and medicine peddlers throughout the local area and eastern Guangdong get their pills, powders, pastes, and decoctions from this old shop."

"Do they make all the medicines themselves?"

"They make some themselves, and also sell some on consignment for others."

"In that case, this Wanchun Quan is a lead—but not necessarily a useful one." Yuan Shuzhi said. "Otherwise, this case would be too easy to crack."

"Comrade Old Yuan, you're right. So we plan to start with Wanchun Quan. Let's see what the story behind this famous Lushi Powder really is."

"In my view, we should first buy some Lushi Powder from Wanchun Quan and verify whether this Lushi Powder is the same as that Lushi Powder." Yuan Shuzhi ate a piece of intestine and took a sip of wine, looking quite content.

Though Lu Cheng didn't approve of his manner, what he said made sense. She knew this old fellow might look slovenly and greasy, but he had some real substance.

She was about to speak when suddenly a commotion of arguing and cursing came from outside. After a moment, an assistant came in to serve food. Lu Cheng asked: "What's happening outside?"

"Nothing," the assistant said. "A customer bought a few bottles of Peerless Patriot cheaply at the outside dock, thinking he'd found a bargain. Just now he took it out to show off, but when they opened it, it turned out to be fake wine. He's cursing up a storm."

Yuan Shuzhi was startled, thinking this might be the same scam he'd encountered en route. He said: "Even Peerless Patriot has counterfeits? I thought only Purple Record could make those bottles. There's no second source..."

"You're right, sir. But the swindlers nowadays aren't stupid either—they know you people trust those bottles. So the bottles are real, but the wine is fake. Not to mention anything else—an empty Peerless Patriot bottle is now worth over ten fen! There are people who specifically collect them to fill with fake wine and fool people."

After the assistant left, Yuan Shuzhi described the two scams he'd encountered during his journey. He added: "Who knew the swindlers would be so brazen! Setting up cons everywhere—even I nearly fell for their trap!"

At this point, he pulled counterfeit money from his robe: "I picked this up on the boat. They specifically use it for scams. I'm not very familiar with this stuff—Comrade Lu, take a look?"

Since counterfeit currency cases had been trending upward recently, Lu Cheng wasn't greatly surprised. However, when she took it and looked at it, she was just as shocked as Yuan Shuzhi had been.

"Comrade Old Yuan—you got this counterfeit on the boat?!"

"That's right, no doubt about it. When the victim went crazy, he was throwing them around the boat. I picked one up—I always felt this counterfeit was different from what I'd seen before..."
