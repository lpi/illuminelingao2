# Chapter 160: Training

Given resource and manpower limits, only so many cannons could simultaneously operate. The 12-pounder mountain howitzers could continue—useful for defense. Firing canister, they outperformed under-trained New Army rifles. Considerable power, high rate, not too heavy (250kg gun weight). One donkey or 3–4 men could haul them. Perfect for camp and Wenlan River defense positions.

The New Army formed up outside Bairren Fortress.

Ma Qianzhu wore a Type-87 training uniform, standing before them. Chest out, chin up, face arrogant—striving to look like movie military.

These former Great Ming commoners—for silver and rations—had unhesitatingly joined this unclear-origin armed force. No guilt about "betraying the dynasty" as "Ming traitors." No revolutionary passion for rebellion. Truly embodying the traditional old army's "soldiering for food" glorious tradition.

600+ freshly shaved gleaming skulls—still adjusting to each other's appearance. New uniforms weren't ready—they wore hand-sewn cotton training uniforms from Bairren Commune's women. Naturally lacking imposing appearance. Besides one 10-man demonstration squad with standard rifles—everyone carried equivalent-weight rocks tied to sticks.

Couldn't be helped. Logistics was overwhelmed—uniform patterns unfinished, equipment nowhere near ready. The Ordnance Department made many rifles—calibration was slow. Paper-wrapped cartridges also needed labor. At least one month before a fully 19th-century-equipped New Army. Properly, Xi Yazhou as future Training Battalion Commander should personally supervise. But he was sick again—probably resting at the Farm. Unlike the Navy's *Fengcheng* Hotel, the Army chose Nanhai Farm for recuperation—good environment, ample food, plus non-cafeteria delicacies to sample. Most Military Group personnel were either on duty or inspecting worker defense construction. Finally Ma Qianzhu—as Acting Chief of Staff—convened Training Battalion exercises.

This was somewhat related to recent army-formation conference disagreements. On New Army organization and personnel, the Executive Committee and Military Group had their first major divergence. The Executive Committee wanted civilians as Chief of Staff—strengthening Executive control over the military. If native soldiers couldn't be trusted—transmigrator soldiers also weren't eternally trustworthy. The Military Group wanted He Ming or Xi Yazhou—one senior, one core figure. Both naturally declined—mediating between the Executive and young turks wasn't easy.

The young turks lacked heavyweight support—lost the Chief of Staff competition. Final decision: Planning Committee Chairman Ma Qianzhu as Acting Chief of Staff. The New Army's establishment created countless needs requiring inter-department coordination—a Planning Committee person was convenient. Both sides found this acceptable.

Ma Qianzhu knew little about 19th-century armies—didn't know how line infantry parties trained troops. But he knew: any era's elite forces shared unchanging characteristics—disciplined soldiers were enemy nightmares. Before small-arms training, physical fitness, drill, and discipline training would continue for one month. For these formerly drifting Ming commoners, his only authority was the "Chief" title. Ma Qianzhu's entire military experience: three months of university military training.

Fortunately, the Military Group left him several veterans as instructors—plus some Salt Village militiamen. Their drill training was personally supervised by Bei Wei—currently the highest standard.

Physical training had no tricks—the transmigrator exercise method: cross-country running. But the veterans all declined—said this glorious task belongs to Chief of Staff Ma.

Ma Qianzhu knew this Acting Chief wasn't yet respected. The veterans wanted him embarrassed.

With conditions we go; without conditions we create conditions and go! Chairman Mao's words echoed. For Party leadership over the military—no, Executive Committee leadership over the military—he must persevere and show them. Intellectuals weren't to be trifled with.

With this resolve, Ma Qianzhu powerfully shouldered his empty rifle, strapped on an allegedly ammunition-filled backpack (actually rocks), and announced: Everyone maintain formation, bring weapons—draw sandals from Logistics—5km cross-country!

5km cross-country was one-way—meaning: run back yourself. No speed limits. After one month—everyone must return in formation. He firmly believed: for new armies, orderly retreat was more important than orderly attack. Naturally, exertion required sustenance. Ma Qianzhu leveraged his Planning head position—had the Agriculture Department supply extra jerky and dried fish for the New Army. Unlimited grain.

Three days later, Ma Qianzhu's feet had blisters—he realized continuing with socks would exhaust his sock supply. Quickly switched to foot wraps. Now hoping calluses developed quickly.

During rest, he ordered everyone lying in rows—himself at front.

Many wondered: why rest so organized? But they grudgingly complied.

Former armored vehicle commander Bai Yu approached:

"Commissioner Ma—really doing this?"

"Start!" Ma Qianzhu's face showed martyr-approaching-execution solemnity.

"Well—I must say—I've been retired for years—"

"I trust you." Ma Qianzhu closed his eyes—dead pig not fearing boiling water expression.

"Actually, Commissioner—you don't need this. The PLA never did this. U.S. soldiers don't either."

"Too much talking. I'm Chief of Staff. Obey orders!" Ma Qianzhu's face: unwavering determination.

"Fine, fine—you win." Bai Yu shrugged. Thinking: intellectuals' excessive book-learning.

"I'm declaring—if something happens, don't blame me." Bai Yu climbed onto the tractor, started the engine, drove toward the formation. No—not to run over people. Just barely—passing within inches of everyone's skulls—carefully drove in first gear.

This roaring steel monster clanking across the ground immediately panicked those lying down. Some scrambled away.

"Everyone stay!" He commanded loudly. "Nobody moves!"

Though shouting—creaking tracks dropping dirt near skulls were terrifying. Sweating profusely—Ma Qianzhu himself wasn't fully confident in Bai Yu. But gamble or nothing.

When the tractor's shadow returned to the garage—he immediately ordered rule-breakers to step out. An extra hour in the sun—carrying rifles, full gear. Looking at their eyes—he was glad shooting training hadn't started.

Ma Qianzhu's tractor training method spread within hours. Someone unceremoniously nicknamed him "Ma SS." Du Wen was devastated—specially called demanding why he'd adopted Nazi fascist methods? Repeatedly saying "you've disappointed me so much." Per Ding Ding's newspaper—Ms. Du Wen even shed tears... Next morning Ma Qianzhu discovered himself: a tabloid gossip figure.

Gossip or not—already committed, Ma Qianzhu had to persist. At least specific drill, shooting, military terminology, grenade throwing were handled by veterans. Otherwise, single-handed with the *Militia Training Manual*—things would've been difficult.

Military training's first days matched Ma Qianzhu's university experience: squad-level drill. Though the Military Group's doctrine was 19th-century column/line battalion-level tactics—how 19th-century Europeans trained was unknown. Basic drill followed PLA regulations.

With Salt Village drill experience plus militia demonstrations, training was easier than expected. Ma Qianzhu insisted: all commands in Mandarin—no translators.

"Ming regular forces also used official language. Sichuan troops didn't get Sichuan dialect commands."

Instructors naturally used sticks inspiring rapid Mandarin comprehension. Daily: the training ground full of shouting. These livelihood-driven peasant soldiers were woken at 5am by loudspeakers, herded to the training ground. "Deputy Master Chief" instructors were fierce—carrying sticks. Their words were incomprehensible—but they demanded understanding. Wrong responses or non-responses meant beatings. Gradually, people who'd never understood left from right grasped the commands. Then forced 9-abreast to "learn walking." Each step: foot height, stride length, arm swings specified... Walking like this was utterly awkward. They'd seen regular troops: beyond drill-field formations circling—never saw such things.
