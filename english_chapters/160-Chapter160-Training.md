# Chapter 160: Training

Given resource and manpower-limits, only so-many cannons could simultaneously-operate. 12-pounder mountain-howitzers could continue—useful for defense. Firing-canister, they outperformed under-trained New Army rifles. Considerable-power, high-rate, not-too-heavy (250kg gun-weight). One donkey or 3–4 men could haul them. Perfect for camp and Wenlan-River defense-positions.

New Army formed up outside Bairren Fortress.

Ma Qianzhu wore Type-87 training-uniform, standing before them. Chest-out, chin-up, face-arrogant—striving to look like movie-military.

These former Great-Ming commoners—for silver and rations—had unhesitatingly joined this unclear-origin armed-force. No guilt about "betraying-dynasty" as "Ming-traitors." No revolutionary-passion for rebellion. Truly embodying traditional old-army's "soldiering-for-food" glorious-tradition.

600+ freshly-shaved gleaming-skulls—still adjusting to each other's appearance. New-uniforms weren't ready—wearing hand-sewn cotton training-uniforms from Bairren Commune's women. Naturally lacking imposing-appearance. Besides one 10-man demonstration-squad with standard-rifles—everyone carried equivalent-weight rocks-tied-to-sticks.

Couldn't be helped. Logistics was overwhelmed—uniform-patterns unfinished, equipment nowhere-near-ready. Ordnance-Department made many rifles—calibration was slow. Paper-wrapped cartridges also needed labor. At least one-month before fully 19th-century-equipped New Army. Properly, Xi Yazhou as future Training-Battalion Commander should personally-supervise. But he was sick again—probably resting at Farm. Unlike Navy's *Fengcheng* Hotel, Army chose Nanhai-Farm for recuperation—good environment, ample-food, plus non-cafeteria delicacies to sample. Most Military-Group personnel were either on-duty or inspecting worker-defense-construction. Finally Ma Qianzhu—as Acting-Chief-of-Staff—convened Training-Battalion exercises.

This somewhat-related to recent army-formation conference disagreements. On New Army organization and personnel, Executive-Committee and Military-Group had first-major-divergence. Executive-Committee wanted civilians as Chief-of-Staff—strengthening Executive-control over military. If native-soldiers couldn't be trusted—transmigrator-soldiers also weren't eternally-trustworthy. Military-Group wanted He Ming or Xi Yazhou—one senior, one core-figure. Both naturally-declined—mediating between Executive and young-turks wasn't easy.

Young-turks lacked heavyweight-support—lost Chief-of-Staff competition. Final-decision: Planning-Committee Chairman Ma Qianzhu as Acting-Chief-of-Staff. New Army's establishment created countless-needs requiring inter-department coordination—Planning-Committee person was convenient. Both-sides acceptable.

Ma Qianzhu knew little about 19th-century armies—didn't know how line-infantry-parties trained troops. But he knew: any-era's elite-forces shared unchanging-characteristics—disciplined-soldiers were enemy-nightmares. Before small-arms training, physical-fitness, drill, and discipline-training would continue one-month. For these formerly-drifting Ming commoners, his only-authority was "Chief" title. Ma Qianzhu's entire military-experience: three-months university-military-training.

Fortunately, Military-Group left him several veterans as instructors—plus some Salt-Village militiamen. Their drill-training was personally-supervised by Bei Wei—currently highest-standard.

Physical-training had no tricks—the transmigrator exercise-method: cross-country running. But veterans all declined—said this glorious-task belongs to Chief-of-Staff Ma.

Ma Qianzhu knew this Acting-Chief wasn't yet respected. Veterans wanted him embarrassed.

With conditions we go; without conditions we create conditions and go! Chairman Mao's words echoed. For Party leadership over military—no, Executive-Committee leadership over military—he must persevere and show them. Intellectuals weren't to be trifled with.

With this resolve, Ma Qianzhu powerfully-shouldered his empty-rifle, strapped on allegedly-ammunition-filled backpack (actually rocks), announced: Everyone maintain formation, bring weapons—draw sandals from Logistics—5km cross-country!

5km cross-country was one-way—meaning: run-back-yourself. No speed-limits. After one-month—everyone must return in-formation. He firmly-believed: for new-armies, orderly-retreat was more-important than orderly-attack. Naturally, exertion required sustenance. Ma Qianzhu leveraged Planning-head position—had Agriculture-Department supply extra jerky and dried-fish for New Army. Unlimited-grain.

Three days later, Ma Qianzhu's feet had blisters—realized continuing-with-socks would exhaust his sock-supply. Quickly-switched to foot-wraps. Now hoping calluses developed quickly.

During rest, he ordered everyone lying in-rows—himself at front.

Many wondered: why rest so-organized? But grudgingly-complied.

Former-armored-vehicle-commander Bai Yu approached:

"Commissioner Ma—really doing this?"

"Start!" Ma Qianzhu's face showed martyr-approaching-execution solemnity.

"Well—I must say—I've been retired for years—"

"I trust you." Ma Qianzhu closed eyes—dead-pig-not-fearing-boiling-water expression.

"Actually, Commissioner—you don't need this. PLA never did this. US-soldiers don't either."

"Too much talking. I'm Chief-of-Staff. Obey orders!" Ma Qianzhu's face: unwavering-determination.

"Fine, fine—you win." Bai Yu shrugged. Thinking: intellectuals' excessive-book-learning.

"I'm declaring—if something happens, don't blame me." Bai Yu climbed onto tractor, started engine, drove toward the formation. No—not to run-over people. Just barely—passing within inches of everyone's skulls—carefully drove in first-gear.

This roaring steel-monster clanking across ground immediately-panicked those lying-down. Some scrambled-away.

"Everyone stay!" He commanded loudly. "Nobody moves!"

Though shouting—creaking-tracks dropping dirt near skulls were terrifying. Sweating profusely—Ma Qianzhu himself wasn't fully-confident in Bai Yu. But gamble-or-nothing.

When tractor's shadow returned to garage—he immediately ordered rule-breakers to step-out. Extra-hour in sun—carrying rifles, full-gear. Looking at their eyes—he was glad shooting-training hadn't started.

Ma Qianzhu's tractor-training-method spread within hours. Someone unceremoniously-nicknamed him "Ma-SS." Du Wen was devastated—specially-called demanding why he'd adopted Nazi-fascist methods? Repeatedly saying "you've disappointed me so much." Per Ding Ding's newspaper—Ms. Du Wen even shed tears... Next-morning Ma Qianzhu discovered himself: tabloid-gossip-figure.

Gossip-or-not—already committed, Ma Qianzhu had to persist. At least specific drill, shooting, military-terminology, grenade-throwing were handled by veterans. Otherwise, single-handed with *Militia Training Manual*—things would've been difficult.

Military-training's first-days matched Ma Qianzhu's university-experience: squad-level drill. Though Military-Group's doctrine was 19th-century column/line battalion-level tactics—how 19th-century Europeans trained was unknown. Basic-drill followed PLA-regulations.

With Salt-Village drill-experience plus militia-demonstrations, training was easier-than-expected. Ma Qianzhu insisted: all commands in Mandarin—no translators.

"Ming regular-forces also used official-language. Sichuan-troops didn't get Sichuan-dialect commands."

Instructors naturally used sticks inspiring rapid Mandarin-comprehension. Daily: training-ground full of shouting. These livelihood-driven peasant-soldiers were woken at 5am by loudspeakers, herded to training-ground. "Deputy-Master-Chief" instructors were fierce—carrying sticks. Their words were incomprehensible—but they demanded understanding. Wrong-responses or non-responses meant beatings. Gradually, people who'd never understood left-from-right grasped commands. Then forced 9-abreast to "learn walking." Each-step: foot-height, stride-length, arm-swings specified... Walking like this was utterly-awkward. They'd seen regular-troops: beyond drill-field formations circling—never saw such-things.
