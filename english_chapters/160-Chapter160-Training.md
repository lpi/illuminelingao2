# Chapter 160: Training

Due to limits on resources and manpower, only a limited number of cannons could operate simultaneously. The 12-pounder mountain howitzers remained in service; they were particularly useful for defense. When firing canister shot, they outperformed the poorly trained New Army riflemen. They possessed considerable power and a high rate of fire, and at 250 kilograms, they weren't too heavy. One donkey or three to four men could haul them. They were perfect for the defense positions at the camp and the Wenlan River.

The New Army formed up outside Bairren Fortress.

Ma Qianzhu, wearing a Type-87 training uniform, stood before them. With his chest puffed out and chin held high, he wore an arrogant expression, striving to resemble a military commander from a movie.

These former Ming commoners had unhesitatingly joined this armed force of unclear origin for the sake of silver and rations. They felt no guilt about being branded "Ming traitors" for betraying the dynasty, nor did they possess any revolutionary passion for rebellion. They truly embodied the glorious tradition of the old army: "soldiering for food."

Over six hundred men with freshly shaved, gleaming skulls were still adjusting to each other's appearances. The new uniforms were not yet ready, so they wore cotton training uniforms hand-sewn by the women of the Bairren Commune. Naturally, they lacked an imposing appearance. Aside from a single ten-man demonstration squad equipped with standard rifles, everyone else carried rocks tied to sticks to simulate the weight.

It couldn't be helped. Logistics was overwhelmed—uniform patterns were unfinished, and equipment was nowhere near ready. The Ordnance Department had manufactured many rifles, but calibration was slow. Paper-wrapped cartridges also required labor. At least one month would pass before they had a fully equipped, 19th-century-style New Army. Properly, Xi Yazhou, as the future Training Battalion Commander, should have personally supervised this. But he was sick again—probably resting at the Farm. Unlike the Navy, which used the *Fengcheng* Hotel, the Army had chosen Nanhai Farm for recuperation due to its good environment, ample food, and the availability of non-cafeteria delicacies. Most Military Group personnel were either on duty or inspecting the workers' defensive construction. Finally, Ma Qianzhu—as Acting Chief of Staff—convened the Training Battalion exercises.

This was somewhat related to recent disagreements at the army formation conference. On the issue of the New Army's organization and personnel, the Executive Committee and the Military Group had their first major divergence. The Executive Committee wanted civilians to serve as Chief of Staff, thereby strengthening Executive control over the military. If native soldiers couldn't be trusted, transmigrator soldiers weren't eternally trustworthy either. The Military Group wanted He Ming or Xi Yazhou—one a senior figure, the other a core member. Both naturally declined; mediating between the Executive Committee and the "young turks" wasn't easy.

The young turks lacked heavyweight support and lost the competition for the Chief of Staff position. The final decision was that Planning Committee Chairman Ma Qianzhu would serve as Acting Chief of Staff. The New Army's establishment created countless needs that required inter-departmental coordination—a Planning Committee person was convenient for this. Both sides found this acceptable.

Ma Qianzhu knew little about 19th-century armies, and he didn't know how line infantry units trained troops. But he knew that elite forces of any era shared unchanging characteristics—disciplined soldiers were an enemy's nightmare. Before small arms training, physical fitness, drill, and discipline training would continue for one month. For these formerly drifting Ming commoners, his only authority was the title of "Chief." Ma Qianzhu's entire military experience consisted of three months of university military training.

Fortunately, the Military Group had left him several veterans as instructors, plus some Salt Village militiamen. Their drill training was personally supervised by Bei Wei and represented the current highest standard.

Physical training involved no tricks; they simply used the transmigrators' standard exercise method: cross-country running. However, the veterans had all declined to lead it, claiming this glorious task belonged to Chief of Staff Ma.

Ma Qianzhu knew this Acting Chief position wasn't yet respected. The veterans wanted to embarrass him.

*With conditions, we go; without conditions, we create conditions and go!* Chairman Mao's words echoed in his mind. For the sake of Party leadership over the military—no, Executive Committee leadership over the military—he would persevere and show them. Intellectuals weren't to be trifled with.

With this resolve, Ma Qianzhu powerfully shouldered his empty rifle, strapped on an allegedly ammunition-filled backpack (actually filled with rocks), and announced: "Everyone maintain formation, bring weapons—draw sandals from Logistics—5km cross-country!"

The 5km cross-country run was one-way—meaning they had to run back themselves. There were no speed limits. After one month, everyone had to return in formation. He firmly believed that for new armies, an orderly retreat was more important than an orderly attack. Naturally, such exertion required sustenance. Ma Qianzhu leveraged his position as head of Planning and had the Agriculture Department supply extra jerky and dried fish for the New Army. Grain was provided in unlimited quantities.

Three days later, Ma Qianzhu's feet were covered in blisters, and he realized that continuing with socks would exhaust his supply. He quickly switched to foot wraps. Now he was hoping calluses would develop quickly.

During rest periods, he ordered everyone to lie in rows, with himself at the front.

Many wondered why rest was so organized, but they grudgingly complied.

Former armored vehicle commander Bai Yu approached him.

"Commissioner Ma—are you really doing this?"

"Start!" Ma Qianzhu's face showed the solemnity of a martyr approaching execution.

"Well—I must say—I've been retired for years—"

"I trust you." Ma Qianzhu closed his eyes, wearing the expression of a dead pig that didn't fear boiling water.

"Actually, Commissioner—you don't need to do this. The PLA never did this. U.S. soldiers don't either."

"Too much talking. I'm Chief of Staff. Obey orders!" Ma Qianzhu's face showed unwavering determination.

"Fine, fine—you win." Bai Yu shrugged, thinking: *intellectuals and their excessive book-learning.*

"I'm declaring—if something happens, don't blame me." Bai Yu climbed onto the tractor, started the engine, and drove toward the formation. No—not to run over people. Just barely—passing within inches of everyone's skulls—he carefully drove in first gear.

This roaring steel monster clanking across the ground immediately panicked those lying down. Some scrambled away.

"Everyone stay!" Ma Qianzhu commanded loudly. "Nobody moves!"

Though he was shouting, the creaking tracks dropping dirt near his skull were terrifying. Sweating profusely, Ma Qianzhu himself wasn't fully confident in Bai Yu. But it was a gamble or nothing.

When the tractor's shadow returned to the garage, he immediately ordered the rule-breakers to step out. An extra hour in the sun—carrying rifles and full gear. Looking at their eyes, he was glad shooting training hadn't started yet.

Ma Qianzhu's tractor training method spread within hours. Someone unceremoniously nicknamed him "Ma the SS." Du Wen was devastated; she called him specifically to demand why he had adopted Nazi fascist methods, repeatedly saying, "You've disappointed me so much." According to Ding Ding's newspaper, Ms. Du Wen even shed tears... By the next morning, Ma Qianzhu discovered he had become a tabloid gossip figure.

Gossip or not, he was already committed, so Ma Qianzhu had to persist. At least specific drills, shooting, military terminology, and grenade throwing were handled by veterans. Otherwise, single-handed with the *Militia Training Manual*, things would have been difficult.

The first days of military training matched Ma Qianzhu's university experience: squad-level drill. Though the Military Group's doctrine was 19th-century column and line battalion tactics, exactly how 19th-century Europeans trained was unknown to him. Basic drill followed PLA regulations.

With the Salt Village drill experience plus militia demonstrations, training was easier than expected. Ma Qianzhu insisted that all commands be in Mandarin—no translators.

"The Ming regular forces also used an official language. Sichuan troops didn't get Sichuan dialect commands."

The instructors naturally used sticks to inspire rapid Mandarin comprehension. Daily, the training ground was full of shouting. These livelihood-driven peasant soldiers were woken at 5 a.m. by loudspeakers and herded to the training ground. The "Deputy Master Chief" instructors were fierce and carried sticks. Their words were incomprehensible, but they demanded understanding. Wrong responses or non-responses meant beatings. Gradually, people who had never understood left from right grasped the commands. Then they were forced nine-abreast to "learn walking." Each step had a specified foot height, stride length, and arm swing... Walking like this was utterly awkward. They had seen regular troops before, but beyond circling formations on the drill field, they had never seen such things.
