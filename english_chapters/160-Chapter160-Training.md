# Chapter 160: Training

Given resource and manpower limits, only so many cannons could operate simultaneously. The 12-pounder mountain howitzers would continue—they were useful for defense. Firing canister, they outperformed the under-trained New Army rifles. They had considerable power, a high rate of fire, and weren't too heavy at 250 kilograms. One donkey or three to four men could haul them. They were perfect for camp and Wenlan River defense positions.

The New Army formed up outside Bairren Fortress.

Ma Qianzhu wore a Type-87 training uniform and stood before them. Chest out, chin up, face arrogant—he strove to look like a movie military commander.

These former Great Ming commoners—for silver and rations—had unhesitatingly joined this unclear-origin armed force. They felt no guilt about "betraying the dynasty" as "Ming traitors." They had no revolutionary passion for rebellion. They truly embodied the traditional old army's glorious tradition of "soldiering for food."

Over 600 freshly shaved gleaming skulls were still adjusting to each other's appearance. New uniforms weren't ready—they wore hand-sewn cotton training uniforms from Bairren Commune's women. Naturally, they lacked imposing appearance. Besides one 10-man demonstration squad with standard rifles, everyone carried equivalent-weight rocks tied to sticks.

It couldn't be helped. Logistics was overwhelmed—uniform patterns were unfinished, equipment nowhere near ready. The Ordnance Department had made many rifles, but calibration was slow. Paper-wrapped cartridges also needed labor. At least one month would pass before they had a fully 19th-century-equipped New Army. Properly, Xi Yazhou as future Training Battalion Commander should personally supervise. But he was sick again—probably resting at the Farm. Unlike the Navy's *Fengcheng* Hotel, the Army had chosen Nanhai Farm for recuperation—good environment, ample food, plus non-cafeteria delicacies to sample. Most Military Group personnel were either on duty or inspecting worker defense construction. Finally Ma Qianzhu—as Acting Chief of Staff—convened Training Battalion exercises.

This was somewhat related to recent army formation conference disagreements. On New Army organization and personnel, the Executive Committee and Military Group had their first major divergence. The Executive Committee wanted civilians as Chief of Staff—strengthening Executive control over the military. If native soldiers couldn't be trusted, transmigrator soldiers also weren't eternally trustworthy. The Military Group wanted He Ming or Xi Yazhou—one senior, one core figure. Both naturally declined—mediating between the Executive and young turks wasn't easy.

The young turks lacked heavyweight support and lost the Chief of Staff competition. The final decision: Planning Committee Chairman Ma Qianzhu would serve as Acting Chief of Staff. The New Army's establishment created countless needs requiring inter-department coordination—a Planning Committee person was convenient. Both sides found this acceptable.

Ma Qianzhu knew little about 19th-century armies, and he didn't know how line infantry parties trained troops. But he knew that any era's elite forces shared unchanging characteristics—disciplined soldiers were an enemy's nightmare. Before small arms training, physical fitness, drill, and discipline training would continue for one month. For these formerly drifting Ming commoners, his only authority was the "Chief" title. Ma Qianzhu's entire military experience consisted of three months of university military training.

Fortunately, the Military Group had left him several veterans as instructors, plus some Salt Village militiamen. Their drill training was personally supervised by Bei Wei—currently the highest standard.

Physical training had no tricks—they used the transmigrator exercise method: cross-country running. But the veterans had all declined, saying this glorious task belonged to Chief of Staff Ma.

Ma Qianzhu knew this Acting Chief wasn't yet respected. The veterans wanted to embarrass him.

*With conditions we go; without conditions we create conditions and go!* Chairman Mao's words echoed. For Party leadership over the military—no, Executive Committee leadership over the military—he would persevere and show them. Intellectuals weren't to be trifled with.

With this resolve, Ma Qianzhu powerfully shouldered his empty rifle, strapped on an allegedly ammunition-filled backpack (actually rocks), and announced: "Everyone maintain formation, bring weapons—draw sandals from Logistics—5km cross-country!"

The 5km cross-country was one-way—meaning they had to run back themselves. There were no speed limits. After one month, everyone had to return in formation. He firmly believed that for new armies, orderly retreat was more important than orderly attack. Naturally, exertion required sustenance. Ma Qianzhu leveraged his Planning head position and had the Agriculture Department supply extra jerky and dried fish for the New Army. Grain was unlimited.

Three days later, Ma Qianzhu's feet had blisters, and he realized that continuing with socks would exhaust his sock supply. He quickly switched to foot wraps. Now he was hoping calluses would develop quickly.

During rest, he ordered everyone to lie in rows—with himself at front.

Many wondered: why was rest so organized? But they grudgingly complied.

Former armored vehicle commander Bai Yu approached:

"Commissioner Ma—really doing this?"

"Start!" Ma Qianzhu's face showed the solemnity of a martyr approaching execution.

"Well—I must say—I've been retired for years—"

"I trust you." Ma Qianzhu closed his eyes—a dead pig not fearing boiling water expression.

"Actually, Commissioner—you don't need this. The PLA never did this. U.S. soldiers don't either."

"Too much talking. I'm Chief of Staff. Obey orders!" Ma Qianzhu's face showed unwavering determination.

"Fine, fine—you win." Bai Yu shrugged, thinking: *intellectuals and their excessive book-learning.*

"I'm declaring—if something happens, don't blame me." Bai Yu climbed onto the tractor, started the engine, and drove toward the formation. No—not to run over people. Just barely—passing within inches of everyone's skulls—he carefully drove in first gear.

This roaring steel monster clanking across the ground immediately panicked those lying down. Some scrambled away.

"Everyone stay!" he commanded loudly. "Nobody moves!"

Though shouting, the creaking tracks dropping dirt near skulls were terrifying. Sweating profusely, Ma Qianzhu himself wasn't fully confident in Bai Yu. But it was gamble or nothing.

When the tractor's shadow returned to the garage, he immediately ordered rule-breakers to step out. An extra hour in the sun—carrying rifles, full gear. Looking at their eyes, he was glad shooting training hadn't started.

Ma Qianzhu's tractor training method spread within hours. Someone unceremoniously nicknamed him "Ma SS." Du Wen was devastated—she specially called, demanding why he'd adopted Nazi fascist methods, repeatedly saying "you've disappointed me so much." Per Ding Ding's newspaper, Ms. Du Wen even shed tears... Next morning, Ma Qianzhu discovered himself a tabloid gossip figure.

Gossip or not, already committed, Ma Qianzhu had to persist. At least specific drill, shooting, military terminology, and grenade throwing were handled by veterans. Otherwise, single-handed with the *Militia Training Manual*, things would've been difficult.

Military training's first days matched Ma Qianzhu's university experience: squad-level drill. Though the Military Group's doctrine was 19th-century column and line battalion tactics, how 19th-century Europeans trained was unknown. Basic drill followed PLA regulations.

With Salt Village drill experience plus militia demonstrations, training was easier than expected. Ma Qianzhu insisted: all commands in Mandarin—no translators.

"Ming regular forces also used official language. Sichuan troops didn't get Sichuan dialect commands."

Instructors naturally used sticks to inspire rapid Mandarin comprehension. Daily, the training ground was full of shouting. These livelihood-driven peasant soldiers were woken at 5am by loudspeakers and herded to the training ground. "Deputy Master Chief" instructors were fierce and carried sticks. Their words were incomprehensible, but they demanded understanding. Wrong responses or non-responses meant beatings. Gradually, people who'd never understood left from right grasped the commands. Then they were forced 9-abreast to "learn walking." Each step had specified foot height, stride length, arm swings... Walking like this was utterly awkward. They'd seen regular troops: beyond drill-field formations circling, they'd never seen such things.
