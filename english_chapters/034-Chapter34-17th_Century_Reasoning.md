Chapter 34 17th Century Reasoning

The interrogation of the captives was conducted by Zhao Manxiong personally.

In the gloomy basement, instruments of torture were displayed. Although the Transmigrators advocated civilization, they were not soft-hearted when dealing with enemies.

"Say, why kidnap President Wen?"

The captive was trembling: "I... I said... It was the Boss who ordered..."

"Who is the Boss?"

"Wang... Wang Mazi."

"Where is he?"

"At... at sea..."

Through the captive's confession, Zhao Manxiong pieced together the whole picture of the matter.

It turned out that Wang Mazi was not an ordinary pirate. He had the support of a big maritime merchant family in Fujian behind him.

This big family was the Zheng family.

"Zheng family?" Wen Desi was shocked, "Zheng Zhilong?"

"It should be." Zhao Manxiong nodded, "Zheng Zhilong is the overlord of the southeast coast now. He monopolizes maritime trade and charges protection fees. We do business here without paying tribute to him, he is naturally unhappy."

"So he instigated Wang Mazi to kidnap me to warn us?"

"Exactly."

"Hmph, Zheng Zhilong." Wen Desi sneered, "He thinks he is the Dragon King of the Sea? We will let him know who is the real master of the ocean!"

However, dealing with the Zheng family was not easy. The Zheng family had thousands of warships and hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Their power was huge. With the current strength of the Transmigrators, confronting them head-on was undoubtedly hitting a stone with an egg.

"We can't be reckless." Ma Qianzhu analyzed, "We must outsmart them."

"How to outsmart?"

"Divorce stratagem." Ma Qianzhu said, "The Zheng family is not monolithic. Zheng Zhilong has many brothers and subordinates, and they have conflicts of interest with each other. We can exploit these conflicts to disintegrate them from within."

"Also," Lin Baiguang added, "We can use the power of the government. Zheng Zhilong is a pirate who accepted amnesty. The court has always been wary of him. We can create public opinion to make the court suspect him and even suppress him."

"Good idea!" Wen Desi nodded, "Let's proceed in two ways."

On one hand, the Transmigrators strengthened their own defense and expanded their armed forces.
On the other hand, they began to engage in diplomatic and intelligence activities.

Lin Baiguang went deep into the officialdom of Guangzhou and made friends with officials, revealing the "ambition" of the Zheng family intentionally or unintentionally.
Zhao Manxiong sent spies to infiltrate the inside of the Zheng family to collect intelligence and sow discord.

At the same time, the Transmigrators also used modern forensic technology to conduct a "17th Century Reasoning" on the scene of the kidnapping case.

They collected fingerprints, footprints, hair and other physical evidence at the scene and analyzed them.

"The footprints show that there were five kidnappers. Their height is between 1.6 meters and 1.7 meters."
"The hair analysis shows that they have lived at sea for a long time and their diet is mainly seafood."
"The fabric fibers left on the carriage belong to a special rough cloth from Fujian..."

This series of scientific evidence pointed the finger directly at the Zheng family.

When Lin Baiguang presented this evidence to the magistrate of Guangzhou Prefecture, the magistrate was stunned.

"This... this is amazing!" The magistrate exclaimed looking at the microscope and test report, "You can even find out this?"

"This is Australian grid science (forensics)." Lin Baiguang said unpredictably, "Nothing can hide from our eyes."

The magistrate was convinced by the "divine skills" of the Australians. He believed that the Zheng family was the culprit behind the scenes.

"Damn Zheng Zhilong! How dare he commit crimes in my jurisdiction!" The magistrate was furious, "I will report to the court and impeach him!"

With the intervention of the government, the pressure on the Zheng family increased instantly. Zheng Zhilong had to restrain his subordinates and dared not act rashly against the Australians for the time being.

The Transmigrators won precious time for development through wisdom and technology.
