# Chapter 317 - Human Dissection

Just as he was thinking, Big Sister Li walked in to ask if "teaching" should begin—she was the mother of the mother-daughter pair brought back by Zhang Xingjiao back then. Although she was older, she was literate, so she was assigned to the hospital to handle administrative work and miscellaneous duties. Because she consistently refused to reveal her real name, everyone addressed her as Big Sister Li.

"Mm, I'm going right now." Shi Niaoren stubbed out his cigarette butt.

The dissection room was located in the semi-basement of Bairen General Hospital. Apart from a few vents sealed by louvers, there were no windows; outsiders trying to peek through the louvers couldn't see anything at all. The door was always kept tightly closed, and no one except Shi Niaoren could open it. The purpose of this was naturally secrecy. Human dissection remained a taboo for many Chinese people even in the 21st century; families would absolutely not agree unless absolutely necessary. Let alone in this era.

Shi Niaoren arrived at a room where Hippo was already waiting. Acting as a dissection assistant, he was also practicing his surgical skills along the way.

He unlocked the usually locked door, led the others down the stairs, and turned on the fluorescent lights. At the end of the stairs was a corridor. Because there weren't enough ceramic tiles available yet, the surface was still simple cement, with fluorescent lights emitting pallid beams overhead.

The air smelled of disinfectant.

The autopsy request form for the corpse had already been filled out. Shi Niaoren demanded that procedures here be as meticulous as in a 21st-century hospital. He flipped through the form, learning that this person was named Chen Yabao, age unknown. He had been wheeled here, ready to face the physicians' scalpels.

The dissection room wasn't too large, about sixty square meters. On all four sides were wooden tiered stands for future interns and nurses to observe dissections; fully seated, it could hold about thirty people.

The room was equipped with ventilation equipment, which was quite a luxury for the transmigrators. In the center of the room was a reinforced concrete rectangular dissection table covered in ceramic tiles. Since the transmigrators' own ceramic kiln hadn't started production, the facing square tiles were custom-ordered from Fujian through merchants—kilns there had year-round experience making foreign porcelain to order, so trial-producing new products was relatively easy. The resulting tiles were indeed "porcelain tiles"—not just glazed on the surface, but truly a block of "porcelain brick."

The transmigrators didn't know that ceramic tiles had already been manufactured in Ming Dynasty kilns. The most famous "ceramic tiles" remaining to this day were the floor tiles of the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing—which were blue and white porcelain.

The surface of the dissection table had many grooves and was equipped with a faucet and a spraying hose, allowing continuous rinsing of the corpse during dissection.

At one end near the dissection table stood a material cabinet, with various dissection instruments and sampling containers placed on different shelves. Adjacent to the dissection room were a preparation room and a specimen storage room.

It took Shi Niaoren a great deal of effort to get the Executive Committee's approval to build such a dissection room—unlike a pharmacy or an operating room, which could show immediate utility to the Executive Committee, this was an important cornerstone for rebuilding modern medicine in this timeline.

The lighting in the room was extremely bright, enough to see every detail on the dissection table clearly.

A corpse covered with coarse white cloth lay on the dissection table; it had just been sent down by a dedicated winch. The deceased was a peasant working on the Bairen City infrastructure construction site who had died suddenly while working. He wasn't a local, so the body could fall into the hospital's hands. Such opportunities weren't many—Shi Niaoren's biggest headache was the inability to preserve heavy sources. There was no shortage of corpses in this timeline; sometimes after a battle, they were practically everywhere. But they couldn't be kept; they had neither cold storage nor enough preservatives. And the temperature in Lingao was never low. They had to use one as soon as they found one.

Hippo changed into his clothes first, putting on latex gloves and a mask. He lifted the white cloth. The deceased was a young man, very thin and small. His muscles and tendons, however, were developed and powerful. There were varicose veins on his calves and arms, obviously someone who had engaged in heavy physical labor for a long time.

Hippo stuffed a pillow under the corpse's neck and arranged the arms. Shi Niaoren laid out the dissection instruments they needed: scalpels, rib shears, clamps, cranial saws... everything was cleaned very cleanly. But unlike surgical instruments, they didn't need strictly sterile disinfection. Here, there was no need to worry about patient infection; physicians only needed to ensure their own safety.

"The little nurses will be here in a moment," Hippo said.

Shi Niaoren teased him: "Do you feel excited dissecting in front of them?"

"As long as they don't treat me as a man-eating demon, it's fine." Hippo smiled bitterly. "In modern society, although people can't accept dissection emotionally, they at least know it's beneficial to medicine. Here?"

"Take it slowly. Changing concepts doesn't happen overnight. They are the seeds of modern medicine." As Shi Niaoren spoke, he picked up a four-page dissection analysis form, reading while talking.

"What is the cause of death?"

"Sudden death. Probably something like coronary heart disease," Hippo said.

"In this timeline, coronary heart disease is rare. Besides, he is still young." Shi Niaoren scrutinized that young but already gray-white face. "He is very thin. Mild malnutrition."

"I'll fill in the corpse condition record." Hippo took the folder.

He muttered to himself while writing: "There is a trauma scar on the left arm." He moved that arm aside and said, "Sorry, brother." Recorded: "Mild muscle rigor." He opened the eyelids and wrote: "Pupils equal and round, diameter 0.3 centimeters." Then he pried open the stiff jaw and said, "Let's check the teeth."

Footsteps sounded in the outer corridor. The door to the dissection room opened, and Ai Beibei arrived.

"They're here." Behind her was a group of young women, all crude among the nurses, and orphans whom the transmigrators were most willing to verify. Shi Niaoren intended to train them into doctors and had even taught them some basic medical Latin.

"Good morning," Ai Beibei greeted. "Come on in, all of you."

The nurses stood in a row at the door, six in total. As they walked into the room, they all glanced nervously at the corpse on the table.

They had served in the health department for several months, seen various scenes, and participated in collecting bodies. They had slowly adapted to sores, mangled limbs, rotting flesh... scenes and smells like these. But watching a human dissection was a first.

"Put on your masks and sit down. Don't fidget."

Shi Niaoren admired these girls one by one. Guo Fu was also here. She was one of his favorite nurses. Although young, the enthusiasm and ability she showed in nursing work were stronger than many older girls. Especially, she wasn't afraid of dirt or blood, and wasn't superstitious at all.

The girls were a bit nervous seeing the corpse, though they had seen plenty. But this was the first time they were going to watch a live "autopsy." It was just like that somewhat scary hanging chart they saw in class—only this time it was a real person cut open for them to see.

Guo Fu was worried about how she would react. She already felt a bit strange inside. As a nurse, she was used to seeing dead people, but for now, dissection was a new, terrifying experience for her.

"Morning." Ai Beibei greeted them and walked straight to the changing room, took off her white coat, put on a mask, took a surgical gown deeply from the rack, and slid her arms into the sleeves. Shi Niaoren, who was also putting on a gown aside, gallantly helped her tie the straps behind her back. Then, as if rehearsed, the two walked one after another to the washbasin. After washing their hands, Ai Beibei picked up a canister of talcum powder and sprinkled it on Shi Niaoren's hands, then held open a pair of latex gloves. Doctor Shi slid his fingers inside; all this without saying a word.

Shi Niaoren walked to the dissection table, took the clipboard from Hippo, and focused on reading it. Shi Niaoren didn't even glance at the corpse on the table at this moment. Hippo observed the professor's movements secretly, suddenly feeling the scene was very much like a symphony conductor taking the stage, only lacking the audience's applause.

Ai Beibei climbed up the wooden ladder on one side of the dissection table and took a photo of the corpse from above.

"This is the corpse of a young male," Ai Beibei said. "Development normal, mild malnutrition, body type leaning towards thin..."

Based on these physical signs, Shi Niaoren analyzed the deceased's hairstyle, facial features, tooth wear, and cranial suture closure, then said:

"The deceased is an unmarried young male, age between twenty-three and twenty-six." Then he turned to the little nurses and said, "This is your first time watching a dissection, right?"

"Yes, Dean." The girls answered in unison.

Shi Niaoren nodded. "Today we are conducting gross anatomy. The reason for dissecting this person," he pointed to the corpse on the table, "is so that we doctors can clearly understand the structure and state of the human body. And at the same time, know why they died."

Shi Niaoren pointed to the wall behind him and said to the girls: "Please look at the words on the wall."

The girls' gazes followed his hand to a motto written in black ink on the white plastered wall.

*Mortui Vivos Docent.*

Shi Niaoren read this Latin sentence aloud, then translated: "The dead teach the living." He withdrew his gaze back to the corpse.

"This person on the dissection table died suddenly during labor. There were no symptoms of illness beforehand. We call this sudden death." His gaze swept majestically over the girls, seeing them looking at him with bated breath, just like the graduate students he mentored in the past—who could imagine that over half a year ago they were waiting to be sold as slaves in the human market of Guangzhou or begging in the streets?

"We will now analyze from the autopsy exactly why he died suddenly."

After saying this, Shi Niaoren checked a set of dissection instruments placed before him and selected a scalpel. He scanned the incision site with his eyes, then cleanly plunged the sharp knife deep into the corpse.

When this knife went down, some girls screamed, immediately scolded by Ai Beibei.

Hippo secretly observed the nursing students. He knew that soft-hearted people or germaphobes couldn't watch autopsies. Even people with some experience weren't very willing to watch the first cut. Up to this point, the corpse on the table still looked somewhat like a living person.

But once the first cut was made, there were no more illusions. The corpse had lost all dignity as a human being. Regardless of whether it was once a man, woman, or child, now it was just a pile of bones, flesh, lymph, and blood vessels.

Because Shi Niaoren worked in research, he hadn't done many autopsies in the past. But after D-Day, he knew the road to performing surgeries in the future was long and heavy, so he practiced whenever there was a corpse. His knife skills were honed anew. The incision was fluid; he began the dissection calmly and agilely.

He made two cuts downwards from the corpse's shoulders, the incisions meeting at the bottom of the chest cavity, then cut from there down to the genitals, opening the abdominal cavity. Three cuts squarely formed a "Y" shape. When the knife went down, only a "squelch" was heard as flesh and skin parted. According to Shi Niaoren's dissection experience, over-nourished modern people usually had a layer of yellow fat here, but this person surprisingly didn't—truly lean to the bone.

Both Hippo and Ai Beibei were watching the nurses' expressions. Three had turned pale, another gagged and turned away; the remaining two held on without moving.

Reasonably speaking, this batch of senior nurses had seen quite a few bizarre corpses with guts spilling out. When pirates attacked Bopu, the first class of Health School students turned out in full force to collect bodies, purposely to build courage. Although they vomited dimly then and screamed from nightmares in the dormitory at night, they slowly got used to it over time—people in this timeline were much tougher or more numb towards death.

Ai Beibei clapped her hands: " anyone who wants to go out for a few minutes can. If you can't hold it, go vomit outside."

But no one moved. The dissection paused for a moment until everyone got used to it before continuing.

Now Hippo put on his gloves and worked alongside Shi Niaoren. The professor began to strip the skin from the ribs using a larger scalpel, peeling it back quickly. Then he used sharp rib shears to cut the ribs, revealing the pericardium and lung lobes. Gloves, scalpels, and the table were full of blood. Ai Beibei turned on the faucet and started rinsing with the hose.

Hippo cut open a section of muscle on the other side of the table, opening the abdominal cavity.

"This is the stomach..."

Shi Niaoren explained. As he spoke, Hippo extracted the stomach and intestines from the abdominal cavity, placed them in a shallow stainless steel dish to show the nurses, checked for specific lesions, and then put them into a glass jar. Because the chemical department could produce very little formaldehyde, he didn't plan to make too many human specimens for now.

As Shi Niaoren explained and dissected, the room was soon filled with the heavy smell of blood and stench. Ai Beibei turned on the ventilation switch, and the smell in the room improved a bit.
