# Chapter 1282 Handling Opinion

Xiao Zhanfeng understood the meaning in the Chief's words and stood at attention: "Serve the Senate and the people!"

"Good, since you have arrived in Leizhou now, you will be one of the main persons in charge here in the future. I happen to have a tricky matter that I prepare to hand over to you to handle." Yan Maoda said.

Xiao Zhanfeng thought to himself, this first test has already come. He calmly said: "Please give instructions, Chief."

"Follow me."

Yan Maoda stood up, led him through a door, turned seven times and eight times in the corridor, passed through several doors with sentries, and finally came to a small room with guards standing guard.

There were only simple tables, chairs, and filing cabinets in the small room. Xiao Zhanfeng was relatively familiar with the Australians' set-up. seeing this layout, he knew that this was a place for interrogating important criminals.

Yan Maoda opened an inner door. Inside was another guard, guarding a long corridor. On both sides of the corridor were seven or eight iron-clad locked doors. Obviously, this was a prison privately set up by the Australians locally.

When Xiao Zhanfeng was in Leizhou, he only knew that the Australians had seized all of Third Master Zhu's original properties, controlled the original Haiyi Hall, and carried out large-scale construction on Hai'an Street. He didn't expect that there was actually such a complete scale in secret.

It seemed that the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild on Hai'an Street was the seat of the Senate's government in Leizhou.

Yan Maoda nodded to the guard, led Xiao Zhanfeng to a door, and gestured for him to open the peephole on the door and look inside.

The peephole was covered with thick glass, but the size was very small—currently, they couldn't make very thin one-way glass with coating, so they could only reduce the size. To ensure safety, the thickness was also made relatively large.

The cell was not big, but it wasn't dark and damp either. The skylight on the roof let down bright light, allowing the environment to be seen clearly. A woman was sitting in the room, lowering her head and embroidering on an embroidery hoop.

Although her head was lowered and her face couldn't be seen clearly, it could be seen that she was not old, just twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with fair skin and a plump figure. She was at least a woman from a middle-class family.

"This is—"

Yan Maoda didn't speak and took him back to the interrogation room.

"Her name is Qiu Han." Yan Maoda took out a thin file from the filing cabinet and placed it on the table in front of him. "The matter is very simple. Qiu Han is Senator Wen's life secretary—used to be..."

Xiao Zhanfeng nodded. He knew Wen Tong—although not as familiarly as Chen Tianxiong—and he also knew what a life secretary was.

"Before becoming Senator Wen's life secretary, Qiu Han used to be Zhu An's, also known as Third Master Zhu, concubine. This point was already explained in the materials submitted when she became Senator Wen's life secretary."

"However, during the political background check last year, we discovered that Qiu Han was not only once Zhu An's concubine, but she was also the sister of the pirate Gu Dachun whom we killed."

Xiao Zhanfeng was a bit confused. This matter didn't have much to do with the Civil Affairs Committee or the External Intelligence Bureau; it was within the jurisdiction of the Political Security General Bureau. He didn't know why they specifically told him about it.

"After being exposed, Qiu Han confessed that she didn't tell the truth because she was afraid. She also said that when she defected to Senator Wen back then, she did have the intention to avenge Zhu An and her brother. But as time went by, she felt that Senator Wen was deeply kind to her and she couldn't bring herself to do it anymore. She only wanted to serve Senator Wen well. Apart from this, she had no other feelings, nor did she collude with outsiders. We conducted physical analysis and lie detection on her confession, and conducted field investigations for several months, concluding that what she said was indeed the truth."

After Yan Maoda finished speaking, he looked at Xiao Zhanfeng significantly and continued: "Since the matter has been investigated clearly, a specific conclusion and handling opinion must be given. Senator Wen proposed: Hope to release Qiu Han and let her return to work by his side."

He pulled out a formatted official document paper from the file—Xiao Zhanfeng recognized it; this was the "Political Review Conclusion and Handling Opinion Form".

The political review conclusion column had already been filled in: "After investigation: concealing part of personal family relationships is true; no deeds or speech harmful to the Senate and the people." The handling opinion column below was still blank.

"Now I authorize you to fill in the handling opinion."

Xiao Zhanfeng was startled: "Chief, this violates organizational procedures. I don't have this authority..."

"This is a special authorization I give you as a Senator and the Deputy Station Chief of Leizhou Station." Yan Maoda said seriously, "You know I have this power."

Every Senator Station Chief stationed abroad actually acted as the person in charge of local political security.

"You have half an hour now to study these materials," Yan Maoda looked at his watch. "I'll come back in half an hour. The handling opinion you fill in will be my decision."

Only Xiao Zhanfeng was left in the interrogation room. He hadn't expected this test to be so subtle, and it even involved a Senator. He carefully studied the few materials. No matter how he looked at it, apart from the circumstance of concealing that she was Gu Dachun's sister, Qiu Han had no stains.

From a prudent perspective, it was not very appropriate for someone like Qiu Han, whose history was not clean and who had once concealed her kinship, to return to a Senator's side. But thinking from another angle, Qiu Han had been Senator Wen's life secretary for more than a year; if she wanted to make a move, she would have had countless opportunities long ago.

He picked up the dip pen and wrote in the handling opinion: "Transfer back to the original unit for controlled use." Then he signed his name and the date below.

He dried the ink with blotting paper and handed it to Yan Maoda who returned to the interrogation room. Yan Maoda looked at it silently and put it into the file. He pulled the bell rope to call the guard outside.

"Fill out a Release from Investigation Decision Form No. 11 and send it over for my signature."

***************** *******************

Xu Ke was the first among the Overlord Operation Special Task Force to return to Lingao. Originally, he should have returned to Kaohsiung to continue providing intelligence and internal security support for Operation Engine, but an urgent telegram came from the "Center", asking him to return to Lingao immediately to report on his work.

"It's probably the munitions factory on Gulangyu that attracted their attention," Jiang Shan thought. He had already submitted the first batch of reports to the Intelligence Bureau in Xiamen, including photos, surveying materials, and captive confessions.

As soon as the transport ship he was on entered the port, Jiang Shan, Director of the External Intelligence Bureau, was personally waiting for him in an office in the Customs Building. It looked like he was a bit anxious.

"You've worked hard on the journey. You should have been allowed to rest first after running back and forth, but this discovery is really too important." Jiang Shan said straightforwardly, "This is the analysis done by several Senators in the mechanical sector based on the photos and surveying materials you sent before. It seems the situation is more urgent than we thought."

Jiang Shan took a file bag sealed with sealing wax from his briefcase and handed it to him, "Study it and compile a report immediately. The Executive Committee will hold a special secret meeting tomorrow morning, and some persons in charge of relevant departments will attend."

"I understand this. I will get the materials ready tonight." Jiang Shan said, "Later I had some new discoveries on Gulangyu and Xiamen Island."

"Good. Include them all. This matter must be kept absolute confidential. Even the professional Senators you consult must be limited to the few listed on our list."

"Yes, I understand." Xu Ke replied.

"Then go home and tidy up first. In two hours, I'll send someone to pick you up. Tonight you will stay in the General Office's No. 1 Guesthouse to prepare the materials." Jiang Shan said.

Early the next morning, the meeting was held in the conference room of the Executive Committee compound. Not many people attended the meeting: this was an enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee. Apart from the Executive Committee members, only the Chief of General Staff, the Minister of Navy Military Orders, the Director of the External Intelligence Bureau, the First Deputy Director of the Political Security General Bureau and others attended the meeting. Basically, they were all heads of decision-making and violent institutions.

Xu Ke had been preparing the report materials all last night and was busy until past two in the morning before finishing the PPT. For confidentiality, he did all the materials himself.

Ten minutes early, Xu Ke followed Jiang Shan into the meeting room. This was his first time coming to the meeting room of the Executive Committee compound. At this time, Xu Ke was wearing a neat navy uniform—the Type 87 naval officer spring and autumn service uniform he wore when serving in the PLAN in the past, with the insignia changed. Because this uniform was made of woolen material, Xu Ke used it as a dress uniform and wore it only on relatively major occasions—the uniforms of the Senate Navy were really too shabby.

He carried a confidential briefcase in his hand, which was equipped with a security rope tied to his wrist.

The meeting participants arrived one after another, and the meeting started on time.

Wen Desi, who presided over the meeting, first made a simple opening speech, then signaled Jiang Shan to take over.

Jiang Shan stood up. He was wearing a beautiful safari jacket—from the material to the workmanship, one could tell at a glance that it was a product of another time-space. It looked particularly eye-catching among the cotton military fatigue-style jackets worn by most people in this office.

"Comrades. In the recent Operation Overlord, our bureau dispatched Navy Lieutenant Xu Ke to move with the troops to provide intelligence support and collect intelligence on the spot. He made some important discoveries in Xiamen while performing his mission. According to the materials and intelligence analysis we grasp, the nature of this matter may be very serious. Moreover, we believe: it may also involve the Ship 'A' Incident. Therefore, it is necessary to report to the Executive Committee and the Senate, and ask the Executive Committee to give specific instructions on the next step of work—now let him explain to everyone."

Xu Ke stood up, walked up to the podium in a few steps, first saluted everyone with a military salute, then took out the documents from his bag. However, he didn't flip through them because he already knew the content by heart. Then he turned on the laptop and projector.

The meeting used a projector to play the PPT. The first thing displayed on the screen was a few digital photos of the Zhongzuosuo City after the battle. Xu Ke began to explain.
