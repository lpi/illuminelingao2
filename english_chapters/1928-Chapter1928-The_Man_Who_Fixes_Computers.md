## Chapter 1928 - The Man Who Fixes Computers

The Senate also strongly supported this matter. Not only did they allocate special funds to expand the old timeline goods warehouse at Gaoshanling to store Elders' scrapped personal items, but they also spared no expense in offering consumer goods to buy back Elders' scrapped personal items. On one hand, these items could recover some resources; on the other hand, it avoided the possibility of these items flowing into society and causing leaks.

These items from the old timeline, even if just a notebook, demonstrated the "backwardness" of the Senate's existing industrial system products in terms of material, processing technology, and performance.

Why were Australian products so advanced, yet the Senate could only produce "clunky, big, and ugly" "austerity versions"? This doubt had long existed among naturalized citizens.

Regarding the origin of the Elders, the "Australia" explanation was currently used, but the Australia story wasn't a panacea. Therefore, for a long time, information about the original timeline was handled with a policy of keeping a lid on it. The General Office and the Great Library jointly issued the "Notice on Preventing the Diffusion of Old Timeline Intelligence."

Zhang Haogu of the Truth Office took the lead and, based on this, formulated the "Advanced Technology Protection Regulations (Draft)." This seemingly innocuous name actually contained many controversial clauses, such as inspecting the preservation status of old timeline items in Elders' private spaces and offices, conducting random checks on life secretaries' knowledge of old timeline technology and history, and monitoring and preventing core naturalized citizens from discussing the origins of the transmigrators.

This draft was unsurprisingly rejected, but it had a significant impact. The result was that the Senate and the Executive Committee formulated a series of policies to prevent intelligence diffusion based on the "Notice."

This "trade-in" policy for personal items was an important measure among the confidentiality policies. Lin Shenhe probably felt his computer was beyond repair, and having borrowed Feng Zongze's computer gave him something to fall back on, so he simply handed it over to the Planning Commission for scrapping and recycling.

So if Dr. Zhong wanted to get his hands on this scrapped computer, it would likely be handled according to the procedures for using Senate reserved old timeline materials, and the approval process for this was quite complex. Besides, Lin Shenhe's machine had a broken screen cable, while the rest of the motherboard functions were relatively intact. It was unknown whether the Great Library would agree to let him remove a component from the power module.

In fact, Feng Nuo also had a say in this matter, especially regarding the removal of parts. Of course, the approval process wasn't under his control; he just signed off as the head of the technical department.

"If Dr. Zhong can settle everything beforehand, doing a favor wouldn't hurt. Anyway, only one of the two computers can survive; saving one is as good as saving the other. I haven't refused Elders' requests on similar forms before," he thought. "Transmigrating and actually bringing a Sony..." Feng Nuo shook his head, replaced the desiccant in the iron box, put it back in the cabinet, relocked it, and returned to his desk.

In the old timeline, Feng Nuo was a PhD student in the computer science department of a university in Beijing. His supervisor was a big shot in the field of architecture—mediocre academic standards, but very skilled at bragging and maneuvering. However, this had nothing to do with Feng Nuo. He wasn't an angry youth; it wasn't easy for the boss to feed a large group of people, and he treated Feng Nuo reasonably well. Unfortunately, Feng Nuo wasn't a creative person; one might even say he was rather inert. By the sixth year of his PhD, he had written a pile of code and a heap of applications, guides, patents, and reports, but had barely managed to churn out a few papers, published in journals of mediocre quality. The boss didn't give much guidance but had high requirements for graduation and wouldn't relent to let him defend his dissertation, let alone drop out to find work—Feng Nuo's face didn't matter, but the boss's face did.

Feng Nuo felt slightly boxed in.

In those two years, PhD students jumping off buildings was a trend. Feng Nuo could well understand the depression brought by graduation pressure and was very worried that one day his dopamine levels might happen to be low and he would take that path. Of course, hindsight proved Feng Nuo worried in the wrong direction; his hormone levels seemed to remain consistently high. Combined with graduation pressure, this led him to resolutely join the transmigration. Perhaps due to his hormone levels falling back after the crossing, he soon regretted it, and regretted it many times. The most recent time was just now when talking to Dr. Zhong, when he suddenly remembered he was just an ungraduated PhD.

In the early days of the crossing, Feng Nuo was quite depressed for a while. Actually, he wasn't suited for transmigration; he was the kind of person who couldn't leave the modern technological environment and the internet. Fortunately, relying on the golden signboard of his school and years of coding experience, Feng Nuo infiltrated the IT group and hung around for a long time. Of course, he claimed to be a PhD, boasting about how great his academic achievements were and how he only transmigrated in anger because his achievements were usurped by his boss, etc. This routine had truly inherited the essence of his former supervisor. In fact, no one had the mind to scrutinize the gold content of his doctorate, so he hadn't been exposed yet.

However, this was of little use. There were plenty of people in computer-related majors in the Senate, but it was one of the most useless majors. Feng Nuo called it a "former sunrise industry." Everyone knew this stuff was too advanced, so much so that the first generation of Elders couldn't possibly restore the level of the electronic information industry of the old timeline in their lifetimes. So Feng Nuo quickly put away his boasting and continued to muddle along.

Working in the computer room offered unique advantages. His job was mainly maintenance, which wasn't much work. The spare time was spent playing games, reading forum posts, watching movies... He was like a fish that accidentally swam into a water-filled rut, greedily breathing the modern atmosphere in the computer room every day.

The place where he worked was called the Senate's Computing and Data Center, and the director was Xu Laowu. However, Xu Laowu didn't manage the computer room; he was the overall person in charge. Feng Nuo's current official title was Director of the High-Performance Computing Resource Management Office of the Planning Commission. His main task was managing all electronic computing equipment brought by the transmigrators from the old timeline: from the large computing clusters deep in the General Manufacturing Plant down to the Deli solar calculators in the hands of Elders. Although he had several other concurrent positions with different names, simply put, he was the Senate's computer system administrator plus repairman. Considering confidentiality, he also had to moonlight as a cleaner.

Fortunately, later there were life secretaries. He applied to have a life secretary come over to work part-time as "security duty," though the main work was cleaning and helping with repairs.

Feng Nuo originally had several colleagues, including many coders, system administrators, database administrators, etc., whose skills were better than his. They all despaired of this former sunrise industry one after another and changed jobs. After all, most IT group people had data analysis and processing skills. Some went outside to be leaders, some went to the Planning Commission, some to various departments in the industrial sector, some to the General Staff to develop combat training simulation and logistics management software, and of course, some went into general administration—the list went on.

Fewer and fewer people remained, but coincidentally, the work in this former sunrise industry grew heavier day by day. The reason was simple: it had been six or seven years since the crossing. Under the hot and humid conditions of Hainan, lacking necessary maintenance conditions, with unstable power supply and even bumpy transport, the lifespans of various electronic components were running out one after another. Dr. Zhong who came this morning and Lin Shenhe earlier were just a microcosm.

Feng Nuo's job was nicely called management, but in the past two years, most of his energy was actually spent on repairs. Feng Nuo remembered a joke circulating when he was in school in the old timeline: "Hearing you studied computers, all your aunts and relatives ask you to install systems and fix computers. Damn it, who can tell them universities don't teach computer repair; go to the computer tech city to clean dust and install systems." And now, Feng Nuo felt that he, a "PhD," wasn't even as good as someone who studied computer repair in a vocational school. Fortunately, his previous research direction was hardware-oriented, and he had actually gone to the computer city to learn some skills for a few days. In the past few years, he had supplemented his knowledge and practiced every now and then. He finally upgraded his computer repair skills from changing graphics cards and memory to being able to replace components, thus securing his position as "Director of the High-Performance Computing Resource Management Office."

It was hard to say whether fixing computers counted as private work or official business. Calling it official business, most of the equipment he repaired was Elders' personal items; calling it private work, these Elders' personal computers were actually the pillars of various aspects of the Senate's undertakings, involving the allocation of large amounts of top-controlled old timeline materials and components.

However, officially speaking, Feng Nuo's most important work duty was still the "management" of the Computing Center.

Contrary to most people's imagination, the Computing Center and Data Center were not located in the stronghold of Senate black technology—the Gaoshanling Great Library—but in a separate courtyard deep within the General Manufacturing Plant in Bairen City. This was considering that the Senate's network infrastructure capabilities were purely running on past capital, and there was no hope of establishing a self-reliant system in the foreseeable future. Therefore, being able to post on forums, check databases, or connect to computing clusters to calculate some simulation data at any time could only be done within Bairen City. The Senate didn't have enough equipment and cables to support network access in Gaoshanling or Lingao County. To save materials, most of the wired and wireless network connection equipment originally provided in various office buildings and Elder apartments had been dismantled, retaining only a small number of access nodes. For Elder apartments, if one wanted to use the network, one had to go to a dedicated "internet room," and office networks were strictly limited to a few access nodes per department. Having the Computing Center's servers together with the precision processing equipment from the original timeline at the General Manufacturing Plant also facilitated stable power supply and security protection.

For dispatched agencies in Sanya, Qiongzhou, etc., as well as places around Lingao with power supply like Bopu Port, Gaoshanling, Taibai Observatory, Manyao Industrial Zone, Manyao Fort, etc., even if Elders could use personal computers for work, information exchange could only be done using USB flash drives. This once caused the USB ports of the receiving servers to age and break successively. The Planning Commission had to requisition "USB hubs" from all Elders. This small item, which sold for only a few yuan in the original timeline, had been completely forgotten by the vast majority of people, becoming one of the few items "not brought from the ship." In the end, Feng Nuo only managed to collect a meager few hubs, using them carefully and sparingly every day.
