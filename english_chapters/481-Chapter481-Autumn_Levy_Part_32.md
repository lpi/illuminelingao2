# Chapter 481 - Autumn Levy (Part 32)

"Isn't Delong already handling collections?" Yan Ming was quite sensitive about this jurisdictional issue.

"Delong is managing the county treasury, but it's not the collection authority—paying taxes to a bank doesn't mean the bank is collecting taxes."

"You mean to set up something like a tax bureau?"

"Precisely. This agency will need to be established sooner or later. We'll start with this year's grain collection." Wu De explained his concept to everyone. The reason for calling it the "Grain Collection Bureau" was that they still needed to use the Great Ming's official façade temporarily.

"This Grain Collection Bureau will nominally be a temporary agency under the county yamen. We'll invite Wu Ya—the County Deputy—to serve as Director-General. Of course, he's just a figurehead. This way, many things can be conducted in the name of the Lingao County yamen. When necessary, we can even deploy 'official forces'..."

"What official forces? Aren't they just our own people?"

"Ha, true enough." Wu De smiled. "The main task of the Grain Collection Bureau is to assist Delong in collecting autumn grain. Meanwhile, our Leadership Group's primary work will be surveying and re-measuring the land."

From this autumn through next spring would be the phase for conducting a comprehensive fact-finding investigation of Lingao's land and grain production conditions—preparatory work for the new tax system. From next summer onward, they would formally implement the new tax system.

First would be a cleanup of land property rights: reissuing land deeds and verifying taxable land. Because the Household Clerk had long been manipulating the fish-scale registers for personal gain, the registers no longer matched actual land ownership.

Second would be clearing hidden land, "false registrations," and fields that had escaped taxation through various other means.

Finally, they would conduct a basic investigation of the fertility, cultivation, and harvest conditions of the land as a basis for setting tax rates.

"...This will require help from the Agricultural Committee. I've already discussed it with Wu Nanhai. He'll assign us a group of personnel with agricultural expertise to serve as consultants for surveying land conditions. Once we've thoroughly investigated everything, we can design new tax rates and collection methods."

"So the Household Office will essentially be defunct after this."

"Of course. In the future, they'll only need to handle routine administrative paperwork. Though there may still be some matters requiring the retained personnel's services."

"Clearing the land will surely face enormous resistance. The gentry and grain households will react very intensely."

"Their passion should have been pretty much exhausted by this incident. Even if they want to cause trouble, we'll now know how to deal with it."

The greatest benefit was that through this incident, they had roughly grasped how the gentry and major households would react, what they were capable of, and which individuals reacted most intensely. Though Chen Minggang's "land survey" had ulterior motives, it had given Wu De and the others an opportunity to observe how the gentry and major households responded.

The Grain Collection Bureau then plunged into the intense work of sorting through the account books. Grain runners from the study class and retained Household Office personnel who had "performed well" were assigned to assist with the organization. All account books were re-registered using modern formats according to Sun Xiao's instructions.

Re-registering the fish-scale registers took considerable effort. Though Yu Eshui had boasted confidently at the time, once the actual goods were in hand, he found himself overwhelmed for a while. They had to bring in classical Chinese specialists and recruit literate employees to help. Fortunately, with Zhou Qi, who had followed Chen Minggang for nearly twenty years, they managed to decipher the cryptic data and land maps.

Based on this working ledger, cross-referenced with collection records, each household's payment amounts were verified. New "grain notices" were then issued according to the principle of refunding overpayments and collecting underpayments.

"The silver that Chen Minggang's gang extorted from grain households under the guise of 'land surveying'—we need to investigate that thoroughly as well." Wu De looked at the newly transcribed ledger of "land survey" bribes. "How much Chen Minggang himself got, and how much each of his subordinates got—every bit must be completely investigated!"

"There's no need to investigate all this, is there? Their assets all belong to us now anyway..."

"No. After investigation, all these bribes must be returned."

"Is that really necessary?" Sun Xiao was quite surprised. "These were bribes paid willingly to Chen Minggang's gang. One party offered, another accepted. Even under modern law, there's no provision for returning bribe money."

"No." Wu De shook his head. "Pay attention: these bribes were given specifically for the land survey matter. We need to draw a clear line separating ourselves from it."

Wu De intended to use the bribe returns to inform grain households: the land survey would continue. Don't think bribes could get you exempted.

"This really seems like an unnecessary gesture." Sun Xiao found it quite painful to part with the money.

"Giving up a little is insignificant." Wu De said. "Establishing proper rules for these grain households is what's truly important."

News of the changes at the county yamen gradually reached the ears of the common people and the gentry households alike. The sudden changes, the citywide lockdown, and the atmosphere of fear from the mass arrests had everyone in the city and surrounding countryside quite nervous for a while. But when they saw everything continuing as normal, with no change of flags above the city gates, they relaxed. Apart from many unfamiliar faces, the county yamen operated as usual. It was currently the busy farming season, and by custom the yamen wasn't accepting complaints and the magistrate wasn't holding court sessions. But Magistrate Wu was still carried about in his sedan chair to make several trips to the countryside—reportedly to "inspect typhoon and flood prevention work."

Huang Binkun, who had run about most vigorously in the previous phase, had fallen into a bewildered sense of powerlessness. By rights, he should be happy. All his activities, running about and lobbying everywhere, had finally thwarted the Australians' scheme to use clerks for grain collection in the county. Now grain collection was suspended, and Chen Minggang's entire gang of grain runners had been swept away. The gentry and grain households had finally vented their anger.

But to this day, he still couldn't be certain whether it was his activities that had produced results, or whether the Baldies had intended to do this all along.

If it was about controlling the county yamen—they hadn't touched the county's officials, yet they'd purged all the clerks who handled actual business! Clerks might be hateful, but without this lot, no one could administer the county's affairs. Didn't the Baldies understand this?

To find out what the Baldies were really planning, he tried to find acquaintances in the yamen to gather information. The Huang family had always been well-connected at the yamen; there were plenty of acquaintances willing to take Huang money. But now this place where you could previously learn anything if you were willing to spend suddenly became tightly secured. Not a shred of detailed information leaked out. The few remaining familiar faces saw Huang Binkun coming to inquire and fell silent, even firmly refusing to take silver—this behavior was practically the sun rising in the west.

He had no choice but to frequently visit the proclamation wall by the yamen entrance to see if any notices had been posted.

The wall, weathered and faded by rain, now bore several brand-new announcements. A crowd had gathered to read them. Huang Binkun's spirits lifted immediately, and he hurried over.

Seeing his scholar's attire, someone called from behind:

"Scholar! Help us read it!"

Huang Binkun read aloud as he skimmed. The first notice announced the establishment of the Grain Collection Bureau. It denounced at length the various abuses of using grain runners for past collections and declared that from this day forth, the practice of the Household Office employing private grain runners was abolished. A specialized agency—the Grain Collection Bureau—would now handle these matters.

"Grain Collection Bureau—is that a new office?"

"Quiet, let him read on."

Pressed by the crowd, Huang Binkun had no time to ponder the implications and began reading the second announcement.

This one was peculiar: it concerned the agency management of the county treasury. Henceforth, all deposits and withdrawals from the county treasury would be handled by Delong Grain Trading Company.

Huang Binkun's experience was limited, and for a moment he was dumbfounded—could a county treasury really be "managed" this way?

The commoners also couldn't quite understand what this "treasury agency" meant. Everyone knew Delong Grain Trading Company—that big grain establishment at East Gate Market. Every day, fully-loaded ox-carts came and went, looking quite impressive and prosperous. The circulation coupons most useful for buying things at East Gate Market were issued by this firm.

While everyone was buzzing with discussion, Huang Binkun slipped away amid the confusion. Though he didn't understand exactly how the county treasury would be "managed," he understood the notice's statement that all monetary and grain transactions for the county yamen would be handled at Delong.

Connecting this with the Grain Collection Bureau business, everything suddenly became clear. The Baldies were seizing control of the county's fiscal power! This way, the yamen's Household Office would lose all real authority—grain collection would become the business of the Australian-controlled Grain Collection Bureau. This so-called Grain Collection Bureau was clearly the Australians' handiwork.

Truly pressing forward step by step. Huang Binkun thought: now the Baldies were no longer content to merely interfere with county administration from outside the walls—they were openly and directly inserting themselves.

He wandered to the side of the county yamen. This area had formerly been where the county's clerks congregated—runners who worked at the yamen mostly lived here. He thought he'd seek out some of their family members and perhaps glean something from the women and children.

But the alley entrance was empty and deserted, with the wooden gate barrier closed. At the gate stood a militia guard from the Militia Squad holding a wooden staff. What kind of protocol was this? Huang Binkun found it strange. He was about to inquire when the militia guard shouted: "What do you want?"

The accent was definitely not local. This startled Huang Binkun. To his knowledge, the county's militiamen were all locals—because the position exempted one from corvée and taxes, outsiders had no chance at such benefits.

Looking at the man's stance holding the staff, and the short stubble of hair visible beneath his cap, Huang Binkun immediately recognized him—this was a "fake Baldy"! Most likely one of those militia soldiers they'd organized.

Huang Binkun said he was looking for someone, but no matter what he said, he was refused entry. The other man clearly didn't consider this distinguished *xiucai* worth any respect. Apart from repeating "No passage allowed," he said nothing.

Huang Binkun pulled a string of copper coins from his sleeve and pressed them forward: "Friend, be a good fellow and accommodate me!"

"I don't take money." The militia guard pushed his hand back forcefully—if Huang Binkun hadn't had some martial training, he probably would have fallen on his backside.

"Ungrateful wretch!" he cursed inwardly and slunk away in embarrassment, pocketing the coins.
