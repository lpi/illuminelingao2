# Chapter 691 - The Ticket to Dongsha Island

"A few pistols?" The fellow sitting in the cast-iron chair raised his eyebrows and once again displayed a childlike cheerful smile. "Dear Mr. Australian Federal Government Official, wouldn't you and your colleagues like to confiscate some more dangerous contraband? I think you'll be interested."

The refitted Vessel 8154 no longer had the appearance of a fishing boat. It now looked quite similar to a light escort vessel from around WWII. Besides the manually-rotated 70mm rifled cannon, a rotatable machine gun turret had been installed above the forecastle—and inside wasn't a typewriter but a genuine M240 machine gun. Without question, once it opened fire, it could disable any warship of this timeline within minutes.

In the Lingao Navy's registry, Fishing Vessel 8154 was listed as an "8154-class High-Speed Cruiser"—aside from being slightly smaller, its firepower could even qualify it as a battleship of this timeline.

Weiss Rando had traveled to Dongsha Island aboard one of these. Also coming were several motor-sail vessels and salvage boats temporarily converted from landing craft.

Since his interrogation, Rando had been secretly transferred to the Administrative Office's Second Guest House. Father Jin Lige had tried several times to visit him but was kept away with the terrifying excuse of "contagious disease." He enjoyed comfortable house arrest at the Second Guest House. Good food, hot baths—he received a cool cotton-linen blend summer uniform. Only later did he learn this was reserved for transmigrator-level personnel. Though this place couldn't replicate everything from the 21st century—most items were imperfect imitations—for Rando it was already very pleasant. Especially the white porcelain flush toilet in his bedroom washroom, which moved him deeply. Someone who hadn't experienced the 17th century's abysmal sanitary conditions would have difficulty understanding his emotion.

At the Second Guest House, someone came to talk with him every day. The visitors varied. Some clearly showed the air of having lived in America in their manner and speech. Many spoke surprisingly good English.

Their conversations covered all topics—his mercenary work, weapons use, and even the situation of the Portuguese in Macao. Clearly they were interested in all information.

The woman who had called herself a federal law enforcement officer also visited once, discussing certain details of weapons trafficking with him. Including some of his past operations. Rando discovered the federal government actually knew his activities quite well—they just hadn't bothered to pursue them.

"What use is knowing so many details?" Rando gazed at this beautiful female agent. Though she wore coarse cloth uniforms, with blue eyes cold as ice, she remained charming and attractive. "Are you planning to prosecute me on behalf of the federal government?"

"Just want to learn more about the situation." Salina answered simply.

"I'm quite curious," Rando looked at her. "How did you come to serve the Chinese?"

"Similar to you." Salina shrugged indifferently. "Any other options?"

"Of course not. Had I known they were living so comfortably, I should have come crying and begging for the Chinese to take me in earlier." Rando stretched. "God, they really live well!"

"They built this bit by bit. You're just here to enjoy the fruits."

"NO, NO," Rando wagged a finger. "I paid for my ticket."

Though he said this, Rando still felt vague anxiety—surely the situation wouldn't change?

Standing on deck gazing at the island—the barren island already showed the embryonic form of a base. As a mercenary who frequently traveled by ship around the world, he fully understood Dongsha Island's importance on the South China Sea route. The Chinese of Lingao's next step after occupying all Hainan Island would certainly be Taiwan.

And Dongsha Island was an important waypoint on the route to Taiwan. Occupying it as a relay base was unsurprising.

But Dongsha Island was relatively close to the mainland. Many coastal fishermen came here to fish, making information leaks easy. Once the transmigrator regime established a base here, attacks from Zheng Zhilong, Liu Xiang, or other Europeans were quite possible. Ensuring personnel and facility security required establishing a garrison force. Therefore, until recently there had been no consensus on whether to establish a permanent base here.

However, intelligence about exploitable shallow petroleum resources near Jilong had stirred the hearts of quite a few transmigrators. Taiwan was, after all, an important link in the empire's future continental chain. So establishing a relay base at Dongsha was put on the agenda.

The Industry Committee had already made considerable investment here for guano mining. They had repaired and cleared the island's wells, established a steam pumping station, and to supplement the limited freshwater output, had set up a distillation plant using boiler heat from steam engines to desalinate water. This station used brackish water of lower salinity pumped from saltwater wells.

Simple rail tracks had already been laid on the island, piers built, and cranes installed to facilitate export of guano. The waters around Dongsha had rich fishing resources. The Agricultural Committee was also preparing to establish a fisheries facility here specifically for purchasing, processing, and storing seafood.

As a garrison measure, the Navy would establish a small-scale fortress here. Beside the pier, a pentagonal star fort was under construction. Once completed, the Dongsha Island fortress would be permanently garrisoned by four cannons and a Marine company. Weather observation and navigation stations would also be established here as an important support base for future maritime navigation.

The Agricultural Committee and Civil Affairs People's Committee had originally planned to establish a fishing village here with settlers. But after investigating geographic and hydrological data, they concluded there was no suitable harbor and the environment was harsh. Historically, fishermen only worked here seasonally, and a fishing village would have difficulty surviving. Ultimately they decided to only establish a fishing station here, normally managed by Marines, with fishermen landing during fishing season.

The pier was now packed with vessels—Dongsha Island had no harbor, surrounded entirely by beaches. Aside from the pier, there was almost nowhere for ships to dock, making berths very tight. The transport fleet from Lingao had the pier's sides completely jammed. The landing craft had simply beached directly.

When 8154 docked at Dongsha Island's only berth, he saw many simple facilities already built on the island. Large shelters stood among the coconut groves. Steam engine black smoke and steam constantly shot toward the sky.

"You've established a relay base at Dongsha—are you planning to go to Taiwan?" Rando leaned against the ship's railing, casually asking Qian Shuiting beside him.

Qian Shuiting responded with a bland smile. His lips held an American cigarette—this was Rando's cargo salvaged from Vessel A.

"Taiwan is a future matter." He said evasively.

"The world is also a future matter."

Qian Shuiting smiled. Rando's status hadn't been confirmed yet, and he didn't want to discuss too much, lest he be attacked by populist factions in the Yuan Laoyuan.

When Rando stepped onto the pier, he discovered a simple rail track had already been built on Dongsha Island. Many empty ore cars sat on the tracks, along with simple cranes. The pier surface was covered everywhere with grayish-white powder and gravel with a glassy sheen.

"What are you mining on this barren island? Coral?"

"Guano." Qian Shuiting said simply. He had come with the salvage team as a weapons consultant. The Political Security Bureau had given him an additional task: serving as this mercenary's interpreter and escort.

"You don't need to deliberately ask him anything. Just treat it as official escort plus interpreter." Wu Mu had said. "You can speak freely with him."

"Speak freely—is that appropriate?"

"Correct. Speak freely." Wu Mu said easily. "If he's one of us, he should know everything anyway. If he's not, knowing won't matter."

Rando had no interest in guano. He smoked Lingao-produced cigarettes. He had grown accustomed to these timeline's cigarettes; American smokes now seemed lacking in flavor.

They came to a temporary camp in the coconut grove. Many sheds and large tents had already been erected inside. Some diving equipment had been unpacked and was undergoing final testing. Among this miscellaneous gear was even an old-fashioned two-person hand-cranked air pump. There were also gasoline drums painted yellow, neatly stacked with waterproof tarps over them.

Given this scale of operation, his ticket price had obviously captured the interest of the Chinese of Lingao. But if they salvaged nothing, he would die without a burial place.

"I hope everything goes well!" He muttered.

Zhou Weisen and Lin Chuanqing, in charge of diving, were already discussing the descent plan in the command post. A nautical chart of the waters around Dongsha Island was spread on the table, already marked with pencil in several places.

Everyone shook hands courteously. Lin Chuanqing gestured, and a sailor brought over iced soda. Everyone sat down and drank heartily.

"Based on the coordinates you provided, we'll search these points one by one starting tomorrow. Small boats have gone to drop buoys—unfortunately there's no GPS here. We calculated using sextants. Hopefully without error." Zhou Weisen said. "Average depth is under 20 meters, so diving should be relatively easy."

Lin Chuanqing said: "I'm curious. When you sank the ship, how did you plan to salvage it later?"

"Hire divers, of course." Rando said. "How was I to know I'd come to a place without divers?"

"Then how did you retrieve the weapons you brought to Macao from the ship? Though it sank shallow, entering a sunken ship for diving? Unless you're a very professional diver!" Zhou Weisen indicated this was hard to imagine.
