# Chapter 290 Sweet Port Turbulence – Dirty Tricks

"Tell them not to worry. As long as they're willing to put in the effort, you can squeeze oil from stones. Besides, do they dare to nitpick with Haiyi Hall?" Third Master Zhu sniffed disdainfully. "When Haiyi Hall tightens the money supply, those money-grubbing dogs will be crying for their parents."

As the Sugar Industry Guild, Haiyi Hall was powerful and wealthy. It was not only the local sugar giant but also effectively controlled local finance. Ordinary merchants and landlords really didn't dare to cross them.

"You," he pointed to another subordinate standing aside, "go tell Zhao the Chicken Foot: tell him to watch South China closely. Within three to five days, South China will definitely have problems. Strike when the opportunity arises!"

Then he instructed several other subordinates to implement various tasks. He didn't fully trust Zhao the Chicken Foot's men, so he arranged his own manpower separately. Keeping this group of riffraff on the payroll was mainly so he could use these unkillable rolling bandit-meats as scapegoats if something went wrong.

After sending everyone away, Third Master Zhu closed his eyes to rest for a while. The plan was proceeding step by step. As soon as South China's cash flow broke, all the methods would be unleashed. He doubted they could withstand this chain of tactics.

While he was calculating, a servant boy rushed in and whispered a few words in his ear. Third Master Zhu's eyes instantly widened: "Really?!"

"It's true! People at the dock saw it with their own eyes. The ship that arrived this morning—South China's people are unloading it now. It's all heavy iron chests! Definitely silver!"

"I didn't think they'd be bold enough! To actually dare transport silver from out of town." This move somewhat exceeded his expectations. To dare transport silver directly by ship in these chaotic waters showed guts!

Admiration aside, this complicated matters. Third Master Zhu pondered for a moment and asked:

"Where is the ship from?"

"Replying to Third Master, I heard it's from Guangzhou!"

The word "Guangzhou" made his eyelids twitch. Was the Gao family starting to intervene? Or was it just funds they mobilized in Guangzhou?

Third Master Zhu's mind spun like a windmill. Because he wasn't asking questions, the servant boy dared not speak or leave. After a long while, Third Master Zhu asked: "How much silver was transported? Do the people at the dock know?"

"Well, it's said that a total of one hundred iron chests were unloaded from the ship. As for the weight, it's really impossible to tell."

Just knowing the number of chests naturally didn't tell him how much silver there was. Third Master Zhu had heard that seasoned old bandits had a skill: they could tell how much silver was on a cart by the tracks it left. Unfortunately, he didn't have such talent on hand.

"How many people to carry each chest?"

"Replying to Third Master, just one person!"

That meant each chest was at most a thousand *liang* of silver. Third Master Zhu felt slightly relieved. But on second thought, even at a thousand *liang* a chest, that was one hundred thousand *liang*. If South China really got their hands on a hundred thousand *liang*, his plan to squeeze them down would fail—not only fail, but the consequences of not collecting sugar this year would be unimaginable!

Sweat began to bead on his forehead.

"Hmph, it might be the Empty City Stratagem!" Third Master Zhu muttered to himself. He immediately ordered:

"Go, invite the strategy master. Prepare brush and ink, write a letter!"

Moments later, the strategy master who specialized in handling his correspondence arrived.

"Write a letter to Guangzhou immediately. Ask: 1. Current sugar prices in Guangzhou; 2. Tightness of the money market in Guangzhou; 3. Has anyone been mobilizing large funds recently, and what is the interest rate?"

The strategy master's brush flew, quickly writing down these questions, then looked up at him.

"That's all. Seal it immediately. Send someone to deliver it to Guangzhou post-haste. I want a reply as soon as possible."

"Third Master, there are no ships to Guangzhou today—" the strategy master reminded him.

"Tell them to send a ship specially. Don't load cargo, leave immediately!" Third Master Zhu waved his hand. "Be fast! Wait in Guangzhou once they arrive, and come back only when there's news! Go do it."

Zhu An painfully felt that communication speed with Guangzhou was too slow. The things he wanted to inquire about weren't secrets. An investigator could visit a few guild teahouses in a day, sit and listen, and know exactly where South China's silver came from and under what terms. Unfortunately, a round trip for this precious news would take at least ten days. In ten days, god knows what else might happen!

With this silver, South China immediately increased its purchasing intensity. The weighing stations increased to ten. The unease and restlessness that had been swelling were once again suppressed. The *Ascending Peace Island* left the dock that night, fully loaded with nearly 600 *shi* of sugar. This news threw Haiyi Hall into turmoil. This was disastrous! Two ships had already transported sixteen hundred *shi* of sugar. If South China kept transporting received sugar away to liquidate it endlessly, Third Master Zhu's plan would be completely ruined—commoners outside didn't know, but everyone in the sugar business knew clearly: Guangzhou sugar price was three *liang* eight *qian*. Shipping sugar out meant earning money back!

"Third Master! Stop holding out! If this goes on, we won't have food to eat this year!" The fat manager of "Riyuelai" begged bitterly.

"I haven't collected even five thousand *shi* of sugar yet! It all went cheap to the South China Factory!"

"What do we do? Looks like they have silver again."

"I said earlier this shouldn't be handled this way!" Hindsight experts were publishing their brilliant opinions.

The commotion made Third Master Zhu irritable. He shouted: "What's the noise!" He stood up and glared at everyone. They all involuntarily lowered their voices.

"You lot, charmingly shortsighted!" Third Master Zhu scolded. "Just staring at the few coins in front of you! The knife is already at our necks, yet you're thinking about the profit in your own homes. If we don't finish off South China, in a few years, the sugar-boiling masters begging under the porch of Zou Monk's Temple will be our seniors!"

He waved his hand: "Are sugar-boiling masters arrogant? You've all been in this business for decades. Last year, how much silver did it cost to hire a master? Three meals a day, meat at every meal, or he'd walk immediately. This year? Give his whole family bowls of rough rice and he'll work for you day and night! You all want to end up like them?!"

At these words, everyone's faces turned dark. South China's strength was obvious. Whether it was clever contraptions or sorcery, South China had indeed changed the sugar industry situation in Leizhou of the past hundred years. Now South China was pressing step by step, not only getting into sugar boiling but also sticking a foot into the most profitable transportation and sales sector. Judging by the ability South China had already shown, controlling all of Leizhou's sugar exports probably wasn't a daydream.

"Why don't we make peace with South China?" Feng Guangfeng suggested. "Let South China join Haiyi Hall too. Every family gives up a share to South China so everyone can eat. And South China is good at boiling sugar, high yield and good quality. If we cooperate, we might not lose out."

Everyone buzzed again. This idea didn't sound bad. South China had strong power and unique sugar-boiling skills. Uniting might not be a bad thing.

"You're all confused!" Seeing his calculations about to fail, Third Master Zhu said deeply, "What is South China here for? Isn't it to swallow Leizhou sugar whole! They have wealth and power; would they be willing to share with us?"

"I oppose too!" The young master of "Rixiecheng" also jumped out. "South China haven't fully fledged yet. If we don't take this chance to knock them out, when they are full-fledged, Haiyi Hall will have to change its name to South China Hall!"

"Besides," Third Master Zhu knew these people couldn't get past greed, "Leizhou sugar only has this much share. If we give South China a share, how much? Too little, they won't be satisfied. Too much, we lose out."

Put this way, everyone nodded again. After all, spitting out what one has swallowed is hard. No one wanted to lose their current dominant position. Seeing the situation controlled, Third Master Zhu told everyone to disperse and not be anxious.

Having sent this group away, Third Master Zhu couldn't help cursing them secretly as "shortsighted"! But he had to force himself to think of new tracks. Even if they were pig-like teammates, they were a group who shared his fate.

Just as he was about to get up and return to his residence for a nap, a servant boy came and whispered something. Third Master Zhu looked impatient but on second thought said: "Call him in."

A while later, someone brought in a man in ragged clothes. This man had large hands and feet, dark skin, and burn scars on both hands. He quickly knelt and kowtowed upon entering the hall.

"What is it?" Third Master Zhu asked with some annoyance, actually knowing what this man came for without asking.

"We really have no way out, so we came to beg Master," the man kowtowed again. "The silver given last time is almost all spent. Investigating... women and children are starving and can't take it. Beg Master for mercy, award some more silver..."

"Humph!" Third Master Zhu looked unhappy. "Silver? You think I run a charity here?"

"Beg Master for mercy!" The man lowered his head. "We... also have no choice. Several hundred mouths to feed. Fifty *liang* of silver, we've been spending it tightly..."

This man was named Lin Zhuang, originally a local sugar-boiling worker. This year, because South China Factory opened, sugar-boiling workers lost jobs in large numbers and livelihoods were difficult. He was elected to present a petition to the yamen requesting a ban on South China's machine sugar production, but it was rejected. With no way out, he had to seek help from Third Master Zhu of Haiyi Hall and received fifty *liang* of silver in aid.

But this aid wasn't unconditional. Third Master Zhu had instructed him to take men and mix outside the sugar trading houses, looking for opportunities to cause trouble.

"You have the face to say it!" Third Master Zhu leaned back. "What about the things I told you to do? It's been seven or eight days, and there's not a peep! Even if I threw silver into water, I'd hear a splash. You several hundred living people haven't even let out a fart."

"This..." Lin Zhuang was tongue-tied, then pleaded, "It's not that we didn't try. It's really that this violates the King's law. South China has a plaque inscribed by the County Magistrate. This thing, doing it, we're afraid... afraid..."

"Afraid of what?!" Third Master Zhu glared at him. "South China Factory caused you to lose jobs, ruined your families. Do you have any blood in you? Silver, I have plenty, but I never give it to trash!"

Lin Zhuang seemed moved by his words, kowtowed again, and said loudly: "Third Master rest assured. Whether we are trash or not, we'll show Third Master in a few days!"

Third Master Zhu nodded: "Tell everyone, if trouble happens and you get lawsuits, go in and I, Third Master Zhu, will naturally look after you. Haiyi Hall will support your families! For those dead or injured, Haiyi Hall pays the compensation silver!"

He gave Lin Zhuang a few more instructions. Lin Zhuang's face looked uglier and uglier, but in the end, he nodded:

"Third Master Zhu, leave this to us. But your words must count!"

"When have I, Third Master Zhu, ever not owned up to my words?" Zhu An said seriously, shouting, "Men, bring fifty *liang* of silver for Lin Zhuang first!" He lowered his voice, "After it's done, there will be another reward for you!"

Lin Zhuang's face flushed, and he responded: "Good, I'll go arrange it now."

Watching Lin Zhuang leave, Third Master Zhu chuckled inwardly. Just this sugar worker causing trouble would be enough for them to swallow.

Then he called a sedan chair to go home, planning to nap before making further plans. However, the arrival of the fifty thousand silver agitated him badly. A sure thing had suddenly developed a twist.

"Is South China really not fated to die?" Third Master Zhu suddenly had such a strange thought. He had dominated Hai'an Street for decades. There had been outsiders trying to dip their fingers into this fat meat, and every time he had beaten them off with various methods. Why was South China so hard to chew?

Thinking of this, he couldn't sleep even more. His sixth concubine, who was currently favored, saw him tossing and turning and came in to serve.

"Make me a bowl of tea!"

Locally produces no good tea, but Jiangxi tea wasn't lacking here. In a moment, a bowl of strong tea was presented. Zhu An drank and thought.

Using the topic of South China refusing sugar to cause trouble was already weak now that a large amount of silver had arrived. Cane farmers still hoped to sell sugar. Even if they caused trouble and brought down South China, at most they'd vent their anger, but the sugar still wouldn't sell. Since farmers harbored hope, they wouldn't be resolute in action. As long as South China's people had a bit of adaptability, they could deal with it. Lin Zhuang's group of sugar workers, having nothing and having his guarantee, would act without scruples. But the other side had escort agency men and hundreds of employees; the effect was hard to say. However, once an incident occurred and there were casualties, it would be enough to give South China a headache.

Just this wasn't enough to put South China to death. Pity that South China's financial situation was still unclear. Third Master Zhu drank cup after cup of strong tea, still unable to think of a suitable method.

Watching his sixth concubine busy serving him, an idea suddenly came to him.

The sixth concubine was the sister of his sworn brother at sea—Gu Dachun. Gu Dachun was the leader of a small band of pirates nearby. Called pirates, it was actually a gang centered on the Gu family, gathering relatives and fellow villagers. They had three or four boats and seventy or eighty people. Usually, they fished and did small coastal trades. When they saw an opportunity, they also robbed passing merchant ships and coastal villages.
