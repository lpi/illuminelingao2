# Chapter 30: The Guangzhou Undercover

From the start, the Executive Committee had targeted the Gao family's two children as a priority. Adults' worldviews, once formed, are difficult to change. By contrast, adolescents think more flexibly, have a natural irreverence toward authority, are easily moved by novelty, love adventure, and are eager to prove they can match adults in capability—all qualities the transmigrators could exploit.

Each crossing, they spent considerable time with the two children, observing their personalities and abilities. Compared to Gao Lujie, the boy Gao Di was more valuable—girls had smaller social circles and fewer opportunities to appear in public. Gao Di was also younger, with far more malleable views and character than his sister.

Gao Di was clever and quick; when Xiao Zishan taught him bookkeeping and arithmetic, he learned instantly. Sometimes Wen Desi would specifically send him on small errands, which he handled capably. When given modern candies and snacks, he always took them home to share with his sister—evidence of an ungreedy, unselfish nature and a sense of responsibility.

When they entered the study, they found both siblings kneeling stiffly on the floor. Beiwei's eyebrows shot up as if about to flare up, but Wen Desi, knowing he couldn't stand such things, quickly stopped him.

"Stand up. What are you kneeling here for, no reason at all? Do you think we're City Gods?" Wen Desi smiled faintly and raised his hand.

"We beg the masters to forgive our mother's offense." The two children didn't rise; they spoke in unison and kowtowed together.

"As I said before—ignorance is no crime." Wen Desi said. "Both of you, please stand."

"We thank the masters for their grace." The siblings exchanged a glance, looking relieved, and quickly stood.

"Gao Lujie, step outside first. I have words for Gao Di."

"I understand, sir." Gao Lujie responded brightly and withdrew. Beiwei rose and went to the window; seeing that Gao Lujie had really left, he nodded.

Xiao Zishan asked: "Do you know Guangzhou city well?"

"Yes—people at the Gao mansion often sent me on errands. A few coins each trip."

"Those playmates I asked about earlier—do you still play with them often?"

"Some were promoted to real duties; the rest are idle at home with nothing to do. They often invite me out to play."

"Are any of them reliable?"

Gao Di's head snapped up: "Does the master want to take on new household members?"

A clever child indeed. Xiao Zishan nodded silently.

"We don't need that yet," he said deliberately vaguely. "This isn't quite the same as selecting household members, though it's somewhat related."

"Then please instruct me, sir—what kind of person do you need?"

"I need a few children who know Guangzhou well. Each day, they'll report the city's news and market prices." Xiao Zishan, following the pre-discussed script, listed which commodities' prices he wanted.

"That's easy—just go to the guild teahouses and check the posted boards."

"Each day, compile everything into a ledger using the bookkeeping method I taught you."

"I understand."

"Each month you'll receive an extra tael of silver as operating funds. You choose the people, but choose carefully. Don't take anyone unreliable or prone to loose talk. Also, pay constant attention to news from the Gao household." Xiao Zishan fixed his eyes on the boy. "Anything important—don't write it down. Wait until we come and tell us."

With each instruction, Gao Di responded. Xiao Zishan noted a hint of trepidation on the boy's face, but excitement clearly overflowed.

"Does your family have anyone friendly inside the Gao household?"

"Yes—Uncle Chang, my father's sworn brother. He does odd jobs in the outer courtyard." He went on at length: this Gao Chang was his father's fellow townsman who had joined the household six or seven years ago. Strong and knowing some martial arts, he could have been promoted to household guard, but his blunt speech and lack of money to bribe the stewards meant he was disliked. At twenty-five or twenty-six, still doing odd jobs, he hadn't even been assigned a maidservant wife.

"A bachelor?"

"Yes, but Uncle Chang takes it in stride—he rarely complains."

The four exchanged glances. This was a promising prospect: someone overlooked at their current workplace would be glad to change employers. Blunt speech meant straightforward and guileless. Rarely complaining meant a balanced temperament. And strong with martial skills had its uses.

Of course, these were the nephew's words, possibly exaggerated in favor. But this was a time of need; they couldn't be too picky. Besides, whether someone was suitable could only be known through use.

"Should I invite Uncle Chang over? He's off duty today."

"Good, go get him."

"I'll say Father invites him for a drink—he'll come."

Such sharp instincts—without being told about secrecy, he already understood. Though this child's cleverness might become a problem if not well managed later. Xiao Zishan's thoughts tended toward the darker side.

Shortly, Gao Chang arrived. Introduced by Gao Di, he kowtowed in greeting. They sized him up: not tall, but sturdy, with nimble movements.

Xiao Zishan asked about his background and service at the Gao household.

"...I've been doing odd jobs in the outer courtyard for six years." Gao Ju reported.

"I see you cut a fine figure and you're quite capable. How is it you've always been just a laborer?"

"This humble one is naturally clumsy and can't talk well. That's why I've always been a laborer."

"Have you married?"

"No..." Gao Chang blushed. "Too poor—no woman would have me."

"You've served the household all these years; hasn't the Gao family assigned you a maidservant wife?"

"Truly, this humble one is too poor. Even if assigned a woman, I couldn't keep her."

Xiao Zishan thought this man was decent: the masters had shown him no favor, yet in front of outsiders he wouldn't speak ill of them.

"How does the Gao family treat you?"

"I'm just a servant. The masters give me clothes to wear and food to eat—that itself is kindness." He spoke with neither servility nor arrogance, advancing and retreating with ease.

Xiao Zishan glanced at Beiwei. The former recon soldier suddenly sprang up and shoved him hard. Caught off guard, Gao Chang stumbled backward seven or eight steps before regaining his footing. Though clearly startled, he simply tidied his clothes and returned to standing with hands at his sides.

Beiwei nodded. This man's lower-body stance was stable—he definitely had skill.

"You know martial arts?" Xiao Zishan asked.

"Just country skills, practiced for self-defense and health. Nothing worth the masters' notice."

Xiao Zishan nodded and asked nothing more, telling Gao Di to see him out for drinks.

After Gao Di left, everyone was fairly satisfied with this interview. But how to recruit this man would require further thought. They discussed the upcoming work in Guangzhou. They had now established their first intelligence network—its purpose was less about gathering intelligence than testing whether Gao Di was suitable for such a role, and also verifying whether the Gao family would prove loyal.

If Gao Qing stubbornly continued as Master Gao's spy, the next step would be to find replacements quickly.

"I think Gao Qing's attitude toward Master Gao is also ambiguous." Beiwei said. "Judging by his wife and children, they don't look like they're fully committed."

"I agree." Wen Desi nodded. "Gao Qing is simply cowed by Gao Ju's power; in reality, he has little loyalty to his former master."

"Actually, what he fears most is following us far from home. We bear the title 'Australian sea merchants.' He's not from the seafaring regions of Guangdong or Fujian who are used to sailing abroad."

"Let's win over his wife and children first. After today, he'll think twice before going to report."

"Will he still go?"

"I think so—just much less often. Gao Qing is timid and indecisive. His former master's authority still looms; he still thinks of keeping a fallback option. Until he's out of Gao Ju's sphere of influence, we can't fully trust him."

"We need to get our own house as soon as possible."

"Right. For now, we want the convenience of trade, but before the final crossing, we must secure a new property."

"Gao Di is promising, but he's just a child. He can't handle buying real estate or servants."

"What about Gao Chang..."

"Someone's there!" Beiwei suddenly shouted. He flashed to the window and grabbed a rock from a potted plant, hurling it outside. A muffled thump—it seemed to hit something.

The three city-dwelling homebodies panicked, collapsing in their chairs, barely daring to breathe.

"What happened?" Wen Desi asked shakily.

"A shadow moved across the corner of the opposite courtyard." Beiwei fumed. "Conducting infiltration reconnaissance before dark—quite the nerve."

"An eavesdropper?"

"Must be." Beiwei said. "The path was zigzagging toward the window."

"One of Gao Ju's people?"

"Unlikely. Gao Ju already has eyes here. Our business with him is going smoothly; he has no reason to do something that would anger us."

"Then who could it be?"

"Probably people who envy him." Xiao Zishan recalled what Gao Ju had said when giving them the house: *"Lately, with these rare goods appearing on the market, I've attracted considerable attention."* This must be one of those "attentive" parties.

Things were becoming increasingly complicated. Thinking of how distracted Gao Ju had seemed today, their thoughts all grew tense.
