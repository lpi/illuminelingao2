# Chapter 2028 - Seeking the True Baldies

"So that's how it is." Li Suiqiu nodded. He thought secretly, these Australians really have many tricks.

The collective wedding matter he had already seen reported in the newspaper—a full page. He rarely read closely articles where hair-thieves praised themselves, but roughly knew the Australians played "official matchmaker," matching a batch of "chaste widows" and reformed prostitutes with husbands.

"Widows remarrying" had stirred debate in Guangzhou's scholarly circles, with some approving and some cursing. Li Suiqiu was indifferent either way—since ancient times keeping chastity was never easy. Wanting to remarry simply meant inability to maintain it; better to let nature take its course.

Li Suiqiu knew Australians always loved capitalizing on major social events to glorify themselves. This collective wedding was probably the same. The Zhang family stepping forward to hold this ritual was just joining the excitement. This was within reason.

But to participate and give offerings at a ritual, one normally had to be friends and relatives of the host family. Zhang's was just a small shop owner in the past, with no connection to his family whatsoever, let alone friendship. Why would they suddenly come to invite his family to "participate"?

Qing Jing probably saw his puzzlement and smiled: "This isn't Master Zhang's idea. Our abbot Daoist Cui dispatched this humble Daoist. This is a joyous occasion for the whole world to celebrate; we invite everyone to participate, share in the blessing..."

Speaking to this point, the meaning was quite clear. This was the Australians' idea; they just weren't saying it openly.

Li Suiqiu cursed inwardly: truly skilled at amassing wealth! He knew clearly: given the current situation, how many wealthy households in the city were eager for any opportunity to forge even the slightest connection with the hair-thieves. This Qing Jing had wide social circles and was acquainted with all gentry and wealthy households in the city. By the time he made one round of visits, forget a mere few hundred taels of silver—even ten thousand taels was easily achievable.

Thinking of this, he "hehe'd" and said: "Seems this Daoist Cui is quite skilled at amassing wealth. Since you came to my residence, you didn't come in vain?"

Qing Jing heard the unfriendly meaning in these words and hurriedly bowed apologetically: "What is Master Li saying! Participating in rituals is by fate; the amount is just karmic connection. This humble Daoist absolutely dare not haggle."

Qing Jing dared not continue being perfunctory with him and hurriedly said "excuse me" before rushing out.

Li Suiqiu felt troubled inside; after seeing his mother, he returned to the outer study. His personal servant was already waiting for him.

After returning to the city, Li Suiqiu mostly maintained a "secluded" lifestyle, never going out except for small gatherings with teachers and friends and social occasions with relatives. He rarely lingered on the streets. But he cared deeply about news from the streets; every day there were designated servants going out to buy newspapers, copy proclamations, and bring back various market rumors and privately circulated "flyers."

Today the servant brought much news as usual. Li Suiqiu first flipped through *Sheep City Express*; nothing much new. Local news continued reporting on matchmaking and the collective wedding. Besides that, it was "Our valiant Fubo Army achieved great victory at such-and-such place again, killing XXX bandits..."

Domestic news was rather interesting. From this newspaper, Australians seemed to know the Ming's situation like the back of their hand. Not only were court affairs known in detail, but large and small events from various places were also known precisely. They could even quote original passages from official communiqués, court gazettes, memorials, and various documents. This most puzzled Li Suiqiu and others—even if Australians had many spies in Beijing and "telegraph" to transmit messages instantly, how could they have spies throughout the two capitals and thirteen provincial administrations? Especially for matters involving bandits, news was even more detailed than the court's.

Although Li Suiqiu had no way to verify that everything in the newspaper was correct, he instinctively felt the hair-thieves' mastery of information was extremely powerful; major news from across the nation took them only three to five days.

After reading a few domestic news items, he couldn't bear to continue—the entire page was bad news. Floods, droughts, locusts, plagues, bandits swarming everywhere.

Never imagined the national situation had deteriorated to this extent! Li Suiqiu sighed inwardly. Previously, without access to Australian newspapers, he only had a vague sense of the overall situation. He had been to the capital and many places, witnessing conditions along the way, knowing the national strength was declining. But he'd never realized the Ming's crisis was so widespread and severe. Now with newspapers frequently publishing disaster reports from everywhere, not only detailed text but also various woodcut illustrations, depicting the misery vividly.

This day-after-day impact made Li Suiqiu feel increasingly lost about the Ming's future. What was the Ming's fate?

There could be no answer. Li Suiqiu vaguely sensed he had already seen the future, yet deep in his heart he utterly rejected this answer.

With this melancholic mood, he put down the newspaper and picked up a pile of messy paper scraps. These were various "tabloids" sold privately on the streets. This trade wasn't run by Australians but by vendors who used clay movable type and soot-water on coarse paper to reprint court gazettes. The various tabloids sold published mostly crudely written, vulgar vernacular novels and story collections. Li Suiqiu had seen servants read such stories in their spare time before and didn't mind. But recently he discovered these crude things actually contained a different universe!

This different universe began with a serialized novel called *Tales of Australian Heroes* in a tabloid. A few days ago he accidentally saw the opening passage on his servant; though the characters were blurry and language crude, the content immediately caught his attention.

This *Tales of Australian Heroes*, though the whole story obviously alluded to hair-thieves and was entirely "false history," the imitation of *Water Margin*'s prologue fabricating the Australians' origins was quite thought-provoking.

At the end of the Southern Song, loyal ministers and righteous warriors protected the Song and resisted the Yuan. When all failed, they threw themselves into the sea to show their resolve.

Immortals pitied them, opened the gates of the celestial realm, sent iron ships to save them, carried them back to the Earthly Immortal Realm, and placed them in the Great Ao of the Eastern Sea.

They taught them immortal arts; after nine generations, there were over five hundred descendants, all learning immortal techniques.

One day the immortals said:

"You are originally mortals, saved by our great iron ship in an apocalypse. Now another apocalypse comes; without completing karma, you cannot approach the Great Dao. You should go again with the great iron ship to save the people, complete this karma, and attain the Great Dao."

Thus they reopened the celestial gates, and five hundred people departed on the great iron ship.

Praised thus: Loyal ministers and righteous warriors repay the sovereign's grace; when heaven's gates open, the Song house survives. Five hundred exiled immortals save the great tribulation; wherever the iron ship arrives, sun and moon are renewed.

As a Confucian disciple, Li Suiqiu naturally didn't believe Australians were "immortals," but he understood the meaning behind this story—they were painting their usurpation of rivers and mountains with the cosmetics of "divine mandate" and "heavenly destiny."

He recalled prophecies from the streets that his servant had recently brought.

"A purple cloud rises from the South Sea; the First Emperor frequently digs at Ma'an Mountain. The dragon energy of a thousand ages can't be dug to death; the Great Song opens again in Southern Guangdong."

This was extremely plain and had been circulating since years ago; needless to say, it was secretly fabricated and spread by hair-thieves.

"Solar eclipse—heaven collapses; lunar eclipse—earth cracks; eclipse of both sun and moon—extinction."

This passage was more meaningful. Since the first year of Chongzhen, celestial phenomena had been changing. There was a solar eclipse in the first year of Chongzhen, followed by solar eclipses in the second, fourth, and fifth years; until the seventh year of Chongzhen, there were continuous solar eclipses in the third, seventh, and tenth months. Though Li Suiqiu didn't understand astronomy, he was a believer in "correspondence between heaven and man." These continuous "abnormal phenomena" had long made him uneasy.

He recalled a gathering at the end of Tianqi, when someone mysteriously mentioned an astronomical phenomenon in the seventh month of Tianqi's fourth year: "Five Planets in Conjunction; the Emperor Star lost position; a guest star transited the sun; the Imperial Star dimmed."

Previously they only saw this as an omen of Emperor Xizong's short lifespan—which later proved true. But recently, street talk said this was a portent of the Ming's imminent fall and change of dynasty.

Even as a disciple of the sage's teaching, facing these prophecies, Li Suiqiu couldn't help but waver inwardly—was the Ming really going to fall?

He painfully bowed his head, no longer reading these distressing papers. He was well-read in history; from the Founding Ancestor to now was over two hundred sixty years. Since the First Emperor unified China, no dynasty except the glorious Han and Tang and the Great Song surviving on half its territory had lasted so long. Like a person entering old age, the various symptoms of the dynasty's decline had appeared.

"When a nation is about to fall, there must be monsters"—this phrase suddenly flashed in his mind. Indeed! Weren't these Australians who came on iron ships precisely the "monsters"? Even the Eastern Barbarians (Jurchen/Manchu) had traceable origins; only these hair-thieves, besides claiming Song lineage and physical appearance, had no resemblance to Chinese whatsoever. Even their origins were concealed, never clarified.

You may fool ignorant commoners, but you can't fool me!

Thinking of this, Li Suiqiu suddenly felt filled with fighting spirit—he would properly contend with these hair-thieves falsely claiming Song descent!

But after this excitement came a wave of emptiness: how to contend? Li Suiqiu wasn't a feeble scholar; he mastered the "Six Arts" and was quite skilled with the sword, a cultured and martial Confucian. In the history of the old timeline, he led troops to rescue Ganzhou and died fighting there. But at this moment, he wasn't thinking of martial combat or assassination, but of understanding the Australians' inside story and finding corresponding methods.

The Jade Source Society run by Young Master Liang specialized in researching "Baldy Studies." Li Suiqiu had some knowledge of it. But he had little contact with the Liang family. Since the Voodoo Case implicated the Liang family and they were punished in the tax rectification, the Jade Source Society had scattered. Though Liang Mansion wasn't raided, it had become a deserted place with few visitors. This was naturally somewhere he couldn't go.

Moreover, the method of merely collecting materials and listening to others recount experiences felt like scratching an itch through boots.

If only he could directly interact with Australians! At least he could get first-hand news from them.

But although there were many true baldies in Guangzhou city, he had no connection to any. Li Suiqiu racked his brains for a long time but couldn't think of anyone who could introduce him.
