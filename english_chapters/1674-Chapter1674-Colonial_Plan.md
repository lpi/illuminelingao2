# Chapter 1674 - Colonial Plan

"The Planning Agency's consideration is to develop the Brunei oil field. Although the initial investment is large, the technical threshold is low and the output is stable," Wu De said. "Fellow Senators can also express your own views."

Senators of the petroleum faction were basically all Brunei faction subscribers. From a professional perspective, Brunei oil was much better than Taiwan oil.

"Internal combustion engines are the development direction for prime movers..." A petroleum faction Senator just wanted to wax lyrical on this but was interrupted by Wu De.

"We do need oil very much, but mainly in the areas of diesel and kerosene. Especially kerosene; with a stable supply of kerosene, the kerosene lamp industry has great potential. You should pay more attention to this aspect."

"Shouldn't we go for electric lights? Or at least gas lamps."

"Gas lamps are not the direction of development. Electric lights need a power grid, which is not something that can be achieved overnight—in the old spacetime, most rural areas only got electricity in the 80s, and remote mountainous areas didn't get power until the 90s. According to our industrial and economic development level, popularizing kerosene lamps within a generation would be considered very good."

Before cheap and sufficiently bright night lighting existed, the vast majority of people in the world could only sleep as soon as the sky turned dark. The only entertainment activity at night was making humans. Lighting a lamp to do work or read at night was something only families with "at least meager assets" could afford. If cheap kerosene lamp lighting could be popularized, it would be equivalent to liberating the nighttime of countless people, creating objective conditions for family labor and study.

The meeting gave everyone a whole day for "group discussions" to speak freely on the Second Five-Year Plan. The newly elected Cabinet members were also "discussing in groups."

Although there were newly elected Senators in this cabinet, almost all of them continued to engage in their original work, so they knew things within their own scope of work very clearly and mastered a full set of materials and plans. Naturally, they inevitably tried to stuff private goods into the Second Five-Year Plan.

Group discussions were held in the Nanhai Coffee House and the conference rooms of various ministries and commissions—the Senate Hall only had one open-air venue, which was okay for general meetings but not for small meetings.

The conference room of the Executive Committee General Office was packed. Those present were all "Ministers" in charge of affairs, with only one exception, and that was Si Kaide—although he was no longer the Minister of Colonial Trade, foreign trade was one of the most important departments of the Senate, playing a crucial role in material supply and currency balance, so this cabinet meeting "expanded" to include him.

Si Kaide seemed well-prepared psychologically for stepping down this time. It was no wonder; although his work in his own post had not been bad these past few years, every time major policies were discussed, he always "swam against the current," tilting left then right, or being sprayed by sprayers from both sides for tilting both left and right simultaneously. His reputation in the Senate went from bad to worse, and stepping down was an inevitable outcome.

After the election ended, Wen Desi said to Ma Qianzhu: "Si Kaide is a good comrade. His foreign trade business work over the past few years should still be affirmed."

Si Kaide comforted himself: stepping down is good too. He had been blackened enough these past few years. Since the Senate was a system where the Emperor took turns, he was a high official in charge of a region, so resting for a term was no problem. Moreover, he was still the People's Commissar for Trade, and his scope of work hadn't changed. At this moment, he was reporting on next year's foreign trade supply plan.

The foreign trade supply plan was crucial to the Senate because many projects in the Second Five-Year Plan were directly related to what goods the trade department could procure. In this spacetime where the supply chain was extremely undeveloped and trade circulation was mainly for luxury goods, many industrial raw materials, if not found in the controlled areas, would require immense manpower and financial resources to search for and purchase—some couldn't even be obtained.

"...Senator Ping wrote: the next trade fleet will ship us 100 tons of copper and 100 tons of sulfur from Japan. The South American wild rubber and cinchona bark shipped by the Dutch from the Americas will also roughly arrive next year..."

Dean Shi, who was sitting quietly, suddenly opened his eyes and said: "Say that again, cinchona bark, how much?"

Si Kaide scratched his head and said: "I dare not say exactly how much, but definitely tons of it. Just don't know if long-distance transport affects the efficacy. In addition, the British East India Company will ship saltpeter, graphite, and asbestos, as well as opium from India."

Zhan Wuya patted Si Kaide on the shoulder and praised: "Little Si, your work is outstanding! Unexpectedly, you actually managed to get rubber, graphite, and asbestos. No need to say more, we must get the electric furnace working next year. With that, silicon steel, #45 steel, #65 manganese steel, stainless steel, calcium carbide, and electric welding will all have hope."

"Electric furnaces aren't in the Five-Year Plan, right?"

"I thought we couldn't get suitable raw materials so I didn't write it in. Besides, the certainty wasn't too high..." Zhan Wuya said, "But the electric furnace is a hurdle we must cross. Without it, many things cannot be started. It is a key link in our industrial chain, better to take it down as soon as possible."

"...Besides continuing to ship slaves, Quarkiong will complete the horse contract delivery next year. The several breeds of horses we purchased from Europe and India will all arrive. But the mortality rate is feared to be high..."

Regarding horses, except for Wu Nanhai, everyone's interest was not great. Since capturing Jeju Island and opening trade channels with Later Jin, although all parties were not very satisfied with Mongolian horses, at least the demand gap was filled. The Army's cavalry, artillery, and baggage trains barely covered their horse shortage. The upcoming Mainland Campaign would unfold in a water network zone where boats were much more useful than horses. As for the agricultural department, although the size and traction of Mongolian horses were a bit poor, modified agricultural machinery could barely cope. However, the low traction of Mongolian horses still limited some large agricultural machinery that Wu Nanhai originally planned to promote in state-owned large-scale intensive farms. Compared to others, his desire for horse breed improvement was quite urgent.

"We are about to launch the Liang-Guang Campaign. In order to display our mighty military prestige and the dignity of Senator officers, senior Army officers should be equipped with horses that look divine and tall. Hope this is considered..."

The speaker was the newly appointed Army Chief of Staff and Commander of the South China Army, Xi Yazhou.

Wu Nanhai "humphed": "Old Xi, if you want to eat horse meat sausage, wait for the horse transport ship to arrive and you can eat enough. Don't pull insults about prestige..."

"Old Wu! Although I ate a few chickens and ducks back then, it was because I was seriously injured on Juhua Islet and needed to nourish my body. It was a bit urgent then and I didn't have time to notify you. You shouldn't always hold onto this! Is there any comradeship left... Look, Nick..." Xi Yazhou suddenly realized he had let slip something. He had maintained an attitude of "beat me to death and I won't admit it" regarding eating Nick's pigeon. Now he fell silent with a thick face.

Wu Nanhai originally wanted to talk about the mysterious events of rabbits disappearing from the farm and a certain suckling pig flying out of the pigsty and appearing in the grass outside the farm, but seeing the atmosphere was inappropriate, he stopped.

Si Kaide continued: "I have here a letter from Senator Xue Ruowang, Consul in Batavia. Everyone should have seen his proposal. Being alone in Batavia is not easy for him; rubber, cinchona trees, and everything were bought by him. He proposed the Palembang Plan in Sumatra, wanting to start experimenting with establishing colonies for the Senate from there. First open plantations, large-scale planting of rubber, cinchona trees, oil palms, and other tropical cash crops, while preparing for the development of Palembang oil fields during the Third Five-Year Plan. As for colonial personnel, mainly recruit from Hakkas. You also know: the conflict between locals and Hakkas in Guangdong is very sharp, armed fighting is commonplace. We still have the pirate giant Liu Xiang in our hands. His pirate group members are mainly from Chaoshan—anyone who knows a little about the Chaoshan area knows that Chaoshan people and Cantonese people don't get along either. So I think from the perspective of stability maintenance, we can migrate a part of Liu Xiang's group there..."

"Not a single thing accomplished, and now wanting to open a new colony. Not to mention manpower, how much material and transport capacity will this investment require?" Wu De was already frowning, "Tropical plantations are necessary, but the investment is not small. Moreover, it's in the Dutch-controlled area! What if the Dutch learn from the Spaniards and carry out a Batavia Massacre to cleanse Chinese immigrants? This amounts to another Vietnam instance!"

"If that happens, we will blood-wash Taiwan (Tayouan/Fort Zeelandia)." Si Kaide said, "The Spaniards dared the Manila Massacre because they saw that the Ming would not retaliate. With our Senate backing the colony, the Dutch won't be so blind."

"Investment, I think won't be too large." Ma Qianzhu said leisurely, "Plantation economy is very cruel and arduous. Letting our people go consume themselves won't do; we still have to use local materials and introduce slavery. Chinese immigrants can be craftsmen, merchants, overseers, and agricultural technicians. Also, this matter can adopt the model of 'Government Supervision and Merchant Operation.' Liu Xiang's private wealth is probably several million, plus several old moneybags under him. Letting them invest to engage in a colonial development company, financial power is more than enough."

Ran Yao said: "Is this appropriate? This is tantamount to cultivating a new group power overseas. If it becomes too big to fail, destroying it later will take great effort. And I know Senator Xue; dealing with an old fox like Liu Xiang who roamed the seas, I fear he will be eaten without even bone residue left..."

"Just asking them to pay, didn't say let them responsible for organization and leadership." Si Kaide had planned this long ago, "Immigrants consist of three parts: Hakkas account for half, Chaoshan people from Liu Xiang's old subordinates account for thirty percent, and Fujianese from Zheng Zhilong's old subordinates in Kaohsiung account for twenty percent. This population ratio is enough for them to check and balance each other."

"It's also much easier for them to kill each other." Ran Yao said, "I'm afraid the Dutch originally had no ideas, but someone among them will go collude with the Dutch first!"
