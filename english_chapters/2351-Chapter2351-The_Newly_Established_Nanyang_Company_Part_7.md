# Chapter 2351: The Newly Established Nanyang Company (Part 7)

"From the perspective of grain, we might as well go directly for Pathein in Burma; that's the largest grain trading port in the 17th century," Wang Kai said. "If we go for Prey Nokor, that place is a stage for all parties to compete. If a fight breaks out, we'll have to consume extra resources..."

The current Mekong Delta, including the later Saigon, was still the territory of the Champa Kingdom. However, this Champa was no longer the ancient kingdom on the Indochina Peninsula of the past. Since the era of Lê Thánh Tông of the Le Dynasty in Annam, border conflicts between Vietnam and Champa had been constant. Thánh Tông led a personal expedition to capture the Champa capital, Vijaya, splitting Champa into three small tributary states: Hoa Anh, Nam Ban, and Champa. In 1611, Nguyễn Hoàng conquered Hoa Anh and established the Phú Yên Prefecture in the occupied territory. Afterward, Nguyễn Hoàng died in 1613. On his deathbed, he instructed his clansmen: "To the north, Thuận-Quảng has the danger of the Transversal Mountain and the Gianh River; to the south, there is the solidity of the Hai Van Pass and Non Nuoc Mountain. The mountains produce gold and iron, and the sea produces fish and salt. It is truly a place for heroes to use martial force. If we can tame the people and sharpen our soldiers to contend with the Trịnh clan, it will be enough to build a foundation for ten thousand generations."

The remaining rulers of Champa accepted the title of Viceroy of Cambodia and were theoretically vassals of the Khmer. At the same time, they also declared themselves subjects to the Southern Nguyễn. The Ayutthaya Kingdom, which ruled Thailand, also had designs on this area. Three parties were competing here. Intervening carried considerable risk. This was what Wang Kai was worried about.

Business hadn't even opened yet, but there was already a debate about the direction of development; this was not a good omen. Thinking of the various proposals within the Southward Faction, Zhou Wei realized that his future days would probably involve a lot of lip service.

Under a major premise, there were bound to be countless personal ideas; fearing it would be difficult to take care of them all.

Xu Yanliang said, "Only with multiple parties restraining each other do we have a chance. The King of Champa is also very clear about his current situation; our joining this game strictly benefits him. A few years ago, Ping Qiusheng of the Ministry of Colonization and Trade went there and even signed a trade agreement with the local King of Champa. This agreement should still be valid."

"Is that the Ping Qiusheng responsible for Japanese business?" Wang Kai asked.

"Yes, that's him. He went on the Southeast Asia expedition back then; he went to Vietnam, Champa, and Ayutthaya. However, he was most interested in Japan, wearing an *eboshi* all day long and playing at being a descendant of the Taira clan. Right now, he's simply stationed in Japan..." Zhou Wei was quite dismissive of Ping Qiusheng's bad taste.

However, Ping Qiusheng's trip to Southeast Asia back then could be considered paving the way for the current Nanyang Company. At least if they went now, it wouldn't be the case that there wasn't even anyone to talk to locally.

"It's a pity he's not local, otherwise we could chat with him. Senator Ping should have quite a few talents in this area in his pocket." Zhou Wei felt it was a bit of a pity.

"There should be his original report in the archives of the Ministry of Colonization and Trade. Just dig out the report and take a look," Xu Yanliang reminded him. "As long as the names are mentioned above, check their whereabouts. Those who can be transferred should be transferred. The personnel will be fleshed out."

Immediately, Xu Yanliang issued a document requesting to access the relevant files of the Ministry of Colonization and Trade. Xu Yanliang said that since the Nanyang Company's first target was the Indochina Peninsula, they might as well apply for the Great Library to take the lead in a special research project, extracting relevant materials to compile a few situation reports.

"Although the historical materials of the Indochina countries are not rich, the historical events of some major nodes are still relatively clear, as well as trade situations and the like. It is still very useful to us."

"You're right. The work at the Great Library is too leisurely; it's good to keep them busy," Zhou Wei said. "Save them from always causing trouble inside."

Seeing Wang Kai seemingly a bit lonely, he added, "As for the work in Pathein you mentioned, we know nothing about Pathein. We might as well send a ship to pave the way first. After all, we haven't directly inspected Burma."

"Burma in the 17th and 18th centuries was one of the minor hegemons in Southeast Asia. If it weren't for Taksin, whether Siam could have continued is an unknown," Xu Yanliang said. "It's okay to send a ship to inspect, but we must act cautiously. It's more appropriate to find a Senator from the Remote Exploration Department to go."

"No, I think we should go in person!" Wang Kai said, unable to hold back.

Zhou Wei certainly didn't want to go, but since Wang Kai said so, it wasn't convenient to object: "Why don't you make the trip personally?"

"I would like to, but I don't know how to sail..."

"Do you get seasick?"

"It's okay. Now that I've taken boats a lot, I'm somewhat used to it."

"Then that's fine! Just find a ship specifically to send you."

"Safety must be considered thoroughly," Xu Yanliang said.

"The Senate has so many ships; surely we can pick out a few excellent captains. The Remote Exploration Department goes out for exploration often; they should have candidates."

"Candidates aren't hard to find, and they are from the Southeast Asia Company."

"Who?"

"There's a female captain named Li Huamei..."

"You mean that female pirate!" Wang Kai remembered. "She seems to have become a naturalized citizen a few years ago."

"That's right. She is attached to the Southeast Asia Company. When we first circumnavigated Hainan Island to go to Sanya, she was the navigator. She is very familiar with the routes to India and Southeast Asia. After naturalization, she also participated in Operation Overlord. She is a very excellent captain and is fully capable of this job."

"Let her come see me immediately." Zhou Wei originally had no interest in the Pathein inspection, but hearing that there was such a figure in the Southeast Asia Company, he suddenly became enthusiastic. He immediately called Wang You in.

Hearing that Chief Zhou asked about Li Huamei, Wang You had an answer right away:
"She's not in Lingao."

"Where did she go?"

"The *Hangzhou* went to Taiwan," Wang You reported. "It was transporting the 6th Taiwan Expedition Team for exploration."

"When can she return?"

"Probably about a month," Wang You said. "It depends on the notification from the Remote Exploration Department."

A month would be too long. All three felt a bit disappointed. Wang Kai said, "Let's move first. We'll talk about the inspection when she comes back."

"Why not change to someone else?"

"No, no, I think she is very suitable," Wang Kai said. "For this kind of inspection work, we still need someone like her to sail the ship." As he spoke, he ordered Wang You: "Send a telegram to Kaohsiung. Ask her to report to the Nanyang Company headquarters in Sanya immediately upon her return!"

Wang You hesitated for a moment and said, "Manager Wang, I can send the telegram. But isn't this a bit too rushed... She'll be back almost for the New Year. After being away for a few months, we should let people go home and rest..."

"Can't she work overtime?" Wang Kai said somewhat consistently.

"This," Wang You hesitated, "Li Huamei is Chief Qi's wife..."

"Chief Qi? Which Chief Qi?"

"It's Chief Qi Feng of the General Construction Company."

"So it's him!" The three realized. No wonder Wang You was so "caring" about Li Huamei; it turned out that the female pirate leader of yesteryear was now a Senator's wife! And the legal wife, not some life secretary!

Unexpectedly, that kid Qi Feng, without a peep, took the female pirate home!

Although Li Huamei wasn't exactly a stunning beauty, and years of life at sea had made her image somewhat "rough," she was, after all, a famous woman in the Senate. The halo of this popularity was still very strong. These few people felt some envy, jealousy, and hate in their hearts.

Xu Yanliang said, "Since she is a family member of a Senator, we still have to be polite. How about this: send the telegram as planned, just say there is an inspection job in the Indochina Peninsula to be given to her, and ask her to arrange her time."

"I'll go do it right now," Wang You said and turned to leave. After a short while, he walked back in holding several thick files.

"Chiefs, these are some detailed materials of the Southeast Asia Company at present. Please have a look." Wang You put the materials on the table and pulled out the thickest one. "This is the company's secret roster. It has a classification level. Please check the sealing wax and sign for it."

Xu Yanliang looked at the sealing wax; it was intact. He nodded and signed the receipt.

Wang You was quite capable. He spent less than a week organizing the basic materials of the Southeast Asia Company. On one hand, this was due to the experience he had accumulated as an advisor in pirate gangs for many years and the ability he had honed. On the other hand, it also benefited from his service time in the Joint Logistics.

Although he was almost governing by doing nothing in the operation of the Southeast Asia Company and didn't play any active role, he was very thorough in the management of assets and personnel. The summary tables and situation reports presented to them were clear and detailed.

The three immediately split up to check the capital of the Nanyang Company. Zhou Wei was most concerned about ships, Wang Kai was concerned about money and goods, and as for Xu Yanliang, he cared more about the employees.

In his view, whether ships or money, they could be solved in the future. Only team building was the most difficult. As the Senate's HR, he knew that the Senate had innate deficiencies in the cadre team—he had seen too many heavy losses caused by naturalized cadres making up the numbers.

Once the Nanyang Company was established, it would inevitably require a large number of cadres. Looking at the current situation, with the Southeast Asia Company as a foundation, there was no shortage of maritime professionals for the time being, and there were also some talents in commerce. But there were relatively few cadres in business management. Especially for future colonial pioneering in the Mekong Delta, management cadres with certain leadership skills and prestige were even more needed.

Such people were not easy to find. Xu Yanliang flipped through the secret roster of employees and shareholders. Under each name, besides a photo, there was an introduction to his personal and family situation, attached with a detailed personal biography. It could be seen that whether shareholders or employees, most were from pirate backgrounds in the Fujian and Guangdong regions. their political ratings were mostly not high; most were just above the standard for normal use. Quite a few were still "controlled use." He noticed that Li Huamei was also a controlled use subject.

"This 'controlled use' has been controlled all the way to a Senator's bed. What on earth are they controlling!" Xu Yanliang secretly complained. It was probably Qi Feng who insisted on marrying her—indeed, even heroes have a hard time passing the beauty trap.
