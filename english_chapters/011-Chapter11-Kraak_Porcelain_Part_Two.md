# Chapter 11: Kraak Porcelain (Part Two)

After Wen Desi sold off the gold in the present timespace—since its purity was lacking—he netted roughly 270,000 yuan. He then found a small smelting plant to re-smelt the silver and cast it into standard 925 industrial silver, which fetched another 200,000 yuan.

As for those several hampers of porcelain, leaving them in the hotel room was not an option. But transporting them all at once would raise questions about how such a pile of goods had suddenly appeared. So they stayed on a few extra days, taking turns hauling pieces out in travel bags.

They counted the porcelain: two hundred pieces in total, mostly plates of various sizes, along with quite a few bowls and vases. Though they knew this was Kraak porcelain, they were all laymen when it came to antiquities.

Wen Desi recalled that at some past dinner he had met a Professor Ma, who taught in the history department of a well-known local university. The professor dabbled in antiques and had a modest reputation in collecting circles. After much rummaging through his business-card holder, he found Professor Ma's number and arranged to meet for lunch to discuss a matter.

"That's right, this is Kraak porcelain," Professor Ma examined the plate in his hand. "A typical export ware. The distinguishing features are wide rims, predominantly blue-and-white, with compartments and circular medallions on the rims of plates and bowls, decorated with landscapes, figures, flowers, and fruit motifs."

Wen Desi put on an attitude of humble receptiveness.

"Kraak porcelain is divided by period into Wanli and Kangxi. This one is Wanli. You can tell by the way the circles in the pattern are drawn with two strokes joined together—that's a characteristic of late-Ming to early-Qing ceramic painting."

Wen Desi thought to himself: *This is actually from the Tianqi reign.*

"So this plate is quite valuable?"

"Don't think of money the moment you hear 'antique.'" Professor Ma's expression turned disdainful. "The value of cultural relics lies mainly in their historical and cultural significance."

As he spoke, he turned the plate over and over, reluctant to put it down. Then he frowned slightly: "This plate still has its 'kiln fire'—it hasn't been properly aged. Could it be a high-quality replica? Where did you get it?"

Wen Desi could hardly say he had brought it fresh from the kiln in another timespace. "I was out in the countryside on business and saw a villager with a stall. The patterns were rather unusual, so I picked up a few pieces."

"You have a good eye for detail." Professor Ma nodded approvingly. "Kraak porcelain was actually a made-to-order product. The decorative patterns catered to European aesthetic preferences—some were painted directly from designs supplied by the Europeans."

"So it should be genuine then?" Wen Desi affected an eager desire to know whether it was real.

"It should be." Professor Ma pondered. "However, this type of porcelain is not very abundant in China. Most pieces on the market were salvaged from the sea. But this plate has clearly never been submerged."

"If it's real, what's the current market rate?"

"Well, the ceramics market is rather complex, and it's been somewhat cool lately overall. But Kraak porcelain is a hot commodity—highest transaction rate among ceramics—though the value per piece isn't enormous. A plate like this could probably sell for three to four thousand yuan."

"That's not bad." Wen Desi adopted the smug air of someone who had found a bargain.

"The problem is that the authenticity is a bit unclear," Professor Ma leaned back in his chair, a subtle smile behind his glasses. "Your plate here has everything going for it—except for that kiln fire. Normally there aren't many high-quality fakes of Kraak porcelain; I've never heard of any mines being planted."

Wen Desi put on an anxious expression: "Professor Ma, can you tell me whether this thing is real or not?"

Professor Ma thought for a moment: "How about this—I have a friend who specializes in porcelain collecting; he's an expert in the field. I'll give you his number. Make an appointment and let him have a look. If it's genuine, he'll definitely want it."

The expert Professor Ma referred him to was also surnamed Ma, though he and the professor were not related—he was a big name in collecting circles. The moment Wen Desi showed him the goods, the expert wanted all two hundred pieces. The specialist strongly suspected that Wen Desi had unearthed a porcelain trove in Fujian. Not only were "Old Wen's" pieces in excellent condition, but the implication was that there were plenty more where those came from. Expert Ma knew that Kraak porcelain, being moderately priced, sold quite easily. A stable supply was exactly what he wanted, and he told them to keep bringing more.

After selling off the gold, silver, and porcelain, this first trip had netted roughly three million yuan. With this as seed capital, the Executive Committee began taking further action.

Continuing to rent hotel rooms was clearly not ideal. Wen Desi decided to set up a company. For 20,000 yuan, he had a full set of paperwork processed, and a trading company was born. By now Xiao Zishan had been informed by his employer that his labor contract would not be renewed. He simply went full-time, taking on the title of Administrative Manager. Wen Desi also wanted to resign, but his company was busy and his supervisor had treated him fairly—he couldn't just walk out. After much negotiation, he finally arranged to leave in three months. Wang Luobin, on the other hand, was far more casual: he submitted a resignation letter, came straight to Guangzhou, and actually joined a small machinery factory as a worker, saying he wanted to "get familiar with the craft."

The newly formed company had nothing to its name. Fortunately, Xiao Zishan had spent many years in Guangzhou and had made broad connections in sales. Now that he had money in hand, everything was easier. For an office, they rented a long-term business suite in the same hotel—a self-contained unit with a private entrance that bypassed the lobby, quiet and equipped with underground parking. Very convenient. Xiao Zishan designated a small storage room inside as the wormhole crossing point and installed a security door. To prepare for the next phase of bulk cargo transport, he purchased a hydraulic hand truck.

On the matter of a company vehicle, the Executive Committee had its first disagreement. Xiao Zishan favored a seven-seat small-displacement minivan like the Changan Star—cheap, could carry many people, could also haul cargo, and was fuel-efficient. Wang Luobin argued that since they were ultimately headed to the seventeenth century, such a vehicle couldn't be put to use there—the Ming dynasty had no gasoline, and the roads weren't suited for such small cars. He therefore proposed a four-wheel-drive diesel-powered SUV—diesel substitutes being comparatively easy to obtain.

After several hours of discussion on this issue, the Executive Committee finally decided to buy an SUV. The car saleswoman was puzzled by these men's choice: they rejected the more fuel-efficient fuel-injected models and bought an older-model Cherokee Jeep—four-wheel drive, manual transmission, diesel engine, with a self-recovery winch.

They had the car. They had a revenue channel. What next? The three members of the Executive Committee sat around the conference table, discussing the next phase of the plan.
