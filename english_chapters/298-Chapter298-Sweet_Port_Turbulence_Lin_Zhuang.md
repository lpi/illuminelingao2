# Chapter 298: Sweet Port Turbulence — Lin Zhuang

"Listening to Brother Zhanfeng's words in the tea shed, you seem to be very familiar with Lin Zhuang?" Chen Tianxiong went straight to the main topic.

"More than just knowing," Xiao Zhanfeng said. "He was originally my neighbor!"

It turned out that Lin Zhuang and Xiao Zhanfeng's families originally lived on Haian Street. Because Xiao Zhanfeng's father had little land at home, he did some small business and actually prospered. In order to let his children study and stand out, he moved to the county seat to live so they could attend a good private school.

"Lin Zhuang, this person, has been a king of children since childhood," Xiao Zhanfeng laughed. "He likes to stand out, talks about loyalty, and likes to make friends. Originally, he was a pretty good person. Pity!" He shook his head. "This person made careless friends and contracted bad habits. The few hard-earned coins he made firing boilers in the sugar shed were either spent in 'private doors' or given away to others at the gambling tables."

"So that's how it is." Chen Tianxiong thought this was just his private morality. Eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling didn't necessarily mean incapacity, and a modest gentleman didn't necessarily mean great talent. If Xiao Zhanfeng's insight was just this, it was a bit weak.

"...This is still a minor matter," Xiao Zhanfeng's face flushed slightly—he rarely drank distilled white liquor. "It's just that with bad habits, his virtue is inevitably deficient. Take this time for example—"

This time Lin Zhuang took the lead to go to the county *yamen* to sue, and the sugar shed workers pooled a sum of money—the *yamen* opens like the character 'eight'; don't enter if you have reason but no money. As long as a lawsuit is fought, regardless of whether it can be won or not, there are customary expenses for managing relationships up and down.

"This Lin Zhuang is good! Using the lawsuit as an excuse, he collected a lot of money from the workers, and he himself embezzled at least half. When the lawsuit was lost, he said the money was all spent, and swallowed the remaining funds, making everyone destitute."

"This isn't all. Later, Master Zhu gave him silver to maintain the sugar shed workers well, preparing to make trouble for you. I don't know how many times he collected silver before and after. However, recently, I saw him lose more than ten *liang* in one breath at the casino. The old and young in front of the Zou Monk Temple drink moldy rice porridge every day—letting him take the lead, this group of sugar shed workers can be considered blind."

This statement was quite different from the "person is still decent" that Zhou Shizhai had inquired about; it was simply on par with a "despicable villain."

"Isn't the rumor outside that he is still a decent person?"

"Hehe, ordinary people don't know his tricks. He also pretends well, wearing ragged clothes all day long, looking miserable. Actually, you just need to go to Aunt Ai's house on the back street of the county to see what his style is. Isn't it crystal clear?"

"Who is Aunt Ai?"

Xiao Zhanfeng was stunned and smiled. "Right, you have only been here for a few months, so naturally you don't know."

Aunt Ai was a famous procuress locally; she presided over a large "private door," and most of the secret prostitutes in the county stayed at her house. Besides women, she also ran a casino, a gold-squandering cave for the lower class society in Xuwen County.

"Are you very familiar with Aunt Ai?" Chen Tianxiong asked abruptly, seeing if he was an honest person. Chen Tianxiong thought that it wasn't a big problem for a person to have some faults, but he was afraid of a hypocrite. Xiao Zhanfeng spoke about others enthusiastically, but his words implied familiarity with casinos and "private doors"; I'm afraid he wasn't an upright gentleman either.

"Not familiar with her, but very familiar with a person inside her place." Xiao Zhanfeng seemed unaware of Chen Tianxiong's intention and was in high spirits. "I am a pauper; Aunt Ai's eyes are very snobbish."

It turned out he had a distant female relative who had been widowed for many years and was now helping in the kitchen there as a maidservant. Xiao Zhanfeng also often went to find her.

As for why he often went to Aunt Ai's place, he kept his mouth shut, obviously not something glorious. Chen Tianxiong thought it was mostly some unclear relationship with this widow. It was inconvenient to ask more.

Immediately stopping the questioning, they chatted about everything under the sun. Xiao Zhanfeng was extremely interested in South China's machine sugar production. Chen Tianxiong explained some basic principles to him to suit his fancy. Unfortunately, what he had learned since childhood was only the Thirteen Classics. The word "science and technology" was far away, and he hadn't even read some ancient Chinese science and technology books, so explaining was very strenuous.

"Looking at it this way, my generation is actually frogs in a well!" Although Xiao Zhanfeng didn't understand eight out of ten sentences, he still listened with great interest, and finally said this sentence.

"It's just that South China's situation is worrying now." Seeing it was about time, Chen Tianxiong pulled the topic back.

Xiao Zhanfeng said unfathomably, "How so?"

Chen Tianxiong immediately recounted the matter of Master Zhu preparing to let the sugar shed workers cause trouble.

Xiao Zhanfeng nodded. "I have also heard rumors of this matter. However, I think this matter won't flare up. Even if it does, it will just be loud thunder but small rain."

"Why is this?"

"Hasn't Shopkeeper Chen heard of 'raising bandits to enhance one's own importance'?"

These words gave Chen Tianxiong a reminder. Xiao Zhanfeng said proudly, "What kind of stuff is Lin Zhuang? A thing with a hard mouth but soft bones. Let alone that if the matter breaks out, the *yamen* will pursue it: at the very least, being detained for a few days and getting a beating is inescapable. Even if Master Zhu mediates in the *yamen*, suffering is inevitable. Besides, if South China is really toppled, isn't he afraid of Master Zhu burning the bridge after crossing it?"

"Correct, correct!" Chen Tianxiong suddenly realized that this scholar's vision was indeed good. Once South China fell, Master Zhu would no longer need to give him silver to maintain the team of sugar shed workers. Instead, the sugar shed workers would be grateful to Master Zhu. How could he, a person who relied on intermediation and playing both sides to make big profits, continue to mix?

"Then, in Brother Zhanfeng's opinion, how should this matter be resolved?" Chen Tianxiong felt deep respect.

"Just call me Zhanfeng." Xiao Zhanfeng probably rarely received such respect, and couldn't help feeling that "a scholar dies for his bosom friend." Immediately, he poured out all his views on this matter.

"Master Zhu also knows that Lin Zhuang is unreliable. So he organized another group of people—Zhao the Chicken Foot's gang of hoodlums. They are desperadoes who fear nothing, unfortunately, their numbers are too small to amount to anything. So to cause trouble at South China, the sugar shed workers and the hoodlums depend on each other. If the sugar shed workers don't riot, the hoodlums can't fish in troubled waters." Xiao Zhanfeng tapped and drew on the table with his chopsticks. "How could Lin Zhuang not know Master Zhu's calculation? If Zhao the Chicken Foot's people cause trouble, the sugar shed workers will definitely be the ones to take the blame. So he blindly delays, just to get more benefits from Master Zhu. But in case Lin Zhuang is forced by Master Zhu to make a move, things will get big."

Chen Tianxiong listened very carefully. Comparing the before and after, wasn't Xiao Zhanfeng's current statement contradicting the earlier "matter won't flare up"? Thinking silently, this person was a scholar after all; "making shocking statements" was probably a habit.

But there was no need to puncture it at this time. Overall, his analysis made sense, and he mentioned many details they hadn't grasped originally. Being a local, he saw things more thoroughly after all.

"So—"

"So as long as Lin Zhuang is subdued, Zhao the Chicken Foot's gang can't stand out at all."

"I also have this intention!" Chen Tianxiong said, "But I heard it's already too late. They say they will burn incense and swear an oath at the Zou Monk Temple in three days..."

"Everyone in Xuwen knows about this." Xiao Zhanfeng disapproved. "Shopkeeper Chen, think about it: if there really is to be a disturbance, it would only be secret networking, gathering suddenly to burn incense and start the incident when the time comes. How can there be something where the burning of incense is known throughout the city three days in advance? Besides, Lin Zhuang's so-called burning incense and swearing an oath is just 'swearing an oath', not saying they will move immediately."

He got more excited as he spoke. "Lin Zhuang was nothing more than pressed urgently by Master Zhu, making a gesture. It also counts as being worthy of the silver he received. So three days later, he definitely won't make a move—do you think a leader would still be soaking in a private door gambling and whoring a few days before making a move?"

So this was the real meaning of what Xiao Zhanfeng said about "this matter won't flare up, even if it does, it will be loud thunder but small rain." Chen Tianxiong nodded secretly; this person indeed had some ability.

"So there is plenty of time to subdue Lin Zhuang."

"Does that mean Lin Zhuang is not at the Zou Monk Temple?" Chen Tianxiong asked.

"How could he be there!" Xiao Zhanfeng said. "Ever since Master Zhu recruited him, he has been living at Aunt Ai's place. Living a leisurely and happy life. He's probably still there now."

"Then I would like to meet him and 'make a friend' with him." Chen Tianxiong cupped his hands. "I trouble Brother Zhanfeng for guidance!" He said, "I am an outsider and am completely in the dark doing this; I rely entirely on your care."

"Easy to say, easy to say!" Xiao Zhanfeng bowed in return. "If there is any service I can render, I will do my best."

Seeing that he didn't decline at all, Chen Tianxiong saw he was clearly a person willing to take responsibility. He took out ten *liang* of silver and placed them on the table.

"Listening to your words is better than reading ten years of books," Chen Tianxiong said. "Brother Zhanfeng's life is hard. Please take this bit of silver to subsidize. There will be other thanks in the future!"

"Cannot accept." Xiao Zhanfeng refused flatly. "I absolutely do not want money. Please take it back. I said these words because I treat you, Shopkeeper Chen, as a friend. If the conversation wasn't agreeable, even if you gave me ten thousand *liang*, I wouldn't bother to say these things."

This was a person with some backbone, although the latter words sounded a bit like bragging to Chen Tianxiong. Immediately he took the silver back. "In that case, I will come again tomorrow. At that time, I will ask Brother Zhanfeng to lead the way to subdue Lin Zhuang."

"What is difficult about this? Going today is also possible."

"No need, no need," Chen Tianxiong said. "I still have a few things on hand to deal with. Since the matter hasn't reached that stage, going tomorrow is also in time."

Chen Tianxiong returned to the sugar firm with Zhou Shizhai. Although he didn't see Lin Zhuang today, befriending a person like Xiao Zhanfeng was a great harvest. Chen Tianxiong liked to let things cool down a bit when doing things. After thinking for a moment, he invited Zhou Shizhai in.

"Master Zhou!" He went straight to the point, "What do you think of this Xiao Zhanfeng today? Is he trustworthy?"

Zhou Shizhai had been escorting for a long time and had full experience in the *Jianghu*. He had a way of judging people.

"Trustworthy." Zhou Shizhai was unambiguous.

"Mn, I also think this person is usable." Chen Tianxiong said, "But one cannot lack a heart for defense against others. Ideally, now is the critical moment. Please take a few local brothers to inquire about Xiao Zhanfeng's background."

"Okay, I'll go right now." Zhou Shizhai went out immediately.

In the evening, the sugar factory workers who went to lobby the sugar shed workers all came back one by one. One day's time naturally didn't have much effect, but the news brought back was clear: many unemployed workers were depressed and felt hopeless about the future. Although Lin Zhuang supplied brown rice daily to barely make ends meet, everyone felt that living on relief like this was not a long-term plan.

The matter of burning incense and swearing an oath indeed existed. And recently someone had been constantly inciting them to storm the South China Sugar Factory, saying that as long as the South China Factory was destroyed, the sugar sheds in Leizhou would recover. The sugar boiling masters were most enthusiastic about this—after all, using all old methods, they benefited the most, so they were willing to take risks. But ordinary workers felt that storming the sugar factory and engaging in smashing and fighting was tantamount to "violating the King's law." Even if the old method of sugar making was restored, it was just eating a mouthful of rice, so their enthusiasm was not high. Plus, the leader Lin Zhuang had an ambiguous attitude and never expressed his stance. Without someone leading, no one was willing to stick their neck out, so it had been deadlocked.

Looking at it this way, Xiao Zhanfeng's judgment that "burning incense" was only "swearing an oath" and not "starting an incident" was completely accurate. Chen Tianxiong immediately wanted these people to continue their activities tomorrow, hinting to the unemployed workers: South China is willing to recruit workers, not only paying wages but also willing to relieve their whole families.

Regardless of how many unemployed workers would be pulled over by them, at least people's hearts would be confused—but it seemed that Lin Zhuang had never truly united the people—this ancient worker leader still had too many selfish thoughts, so he couldn't achieve anything.

Looking at it this way, the matter was already eighty or ninety percent certain. Buying off Lin Zhuang tomorrow probably wouldn't require much effort.

The next day, still accompanied by Zhou Shizhai, the two dressed as an outside merchant and his servant. First, they took a sedan chair secretly to the "Dachang Rice Shop" in the county seat—this was the place where Liao Daxing originally worked as a shop assistant, so the relationship between the two places was unusual; the rice used in South China was purchased from there. Boss Zhu of the Rice Shop was naturally extremely attentive to such a big customer.

To avoid possible spies, after the two arrived, they sent a shop assistant to invite Xiao Zhanfeng. After Xiao Zhanfeng arrived, Chen Tianxiong's group was led by him to Aunt Ai's house.

Entering through the front door and exiting through the back. Behind the rice shop was a small alley. Walking dozens of meters, they turned onto a long street paved with extremely flat bluestone slabs. Looking around, rows of buildings were quite neat. The pedestrians on the street were also dressed much more neatly than in Lingao—thanks to the booming sugar industry, Xuwen was considered quite a wealthy place.

However, "private doors" were never in lively places. Xiao Zhanfeng led the way, turning past the front of the county *yamen* and entering a quiet place behind the county seat. The roads here were mostly lined with the back walls of large households' homes. Fire walls towered high, with only small doors opening one by one. Pedestrians were scarce.

Turning a few more corners, they walked to a double-opening small door. Xiao Zhanfeng stopped and said, "This is it."
