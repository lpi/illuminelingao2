# Chapter 42 - Unexpected Visitor (Second Update)

Chapter 42 Unexpected Visitor (Second Update)

The Fengcheng successfully passed through the wormhole and arrived at the sea surface of the Ming Dynasty.

However, just as they were cheering for their success, an unexpected situation happened.

"Report! A small boat is found ahead!" The lookout shouted.

"Small boat?" Wen Desi was stunned, "Is it a fishing boat of the Ming Dynasty?"

"No... it looks like a modern speedboat!"

"What?!"

Everyone was shocked. Modern speedboat? How could it appear in the Ming Dynasty?

"Could it be... we crossed back?" Someone guessed.

"Impossible!" Wen Desi denied, "The coordinates are correct, and the energy consumption is also normal."

They used searchlights to illuminate the small boat.

There were four people on the boat: an old couple and a young couple. They looked like tourists.

"Who are you?" Wen Desi asked with a loudspeaker.

"We... we are tourists..." The young man on the boat shouted trembling, "We were fishing at sea, suddenly foggy, and then we saw your big ship..."

It turned out that these four people were indeed modern tourists. They rented a speedboat to go fishing at sea, but they strayed into the wormhole area by mistake and were "sucked" in together with the Fengcheng.

"This is troublesome." Xiao Zishan frowned, "What to do with them?"

"Kill them to silence them?" Xi Yazhou made a beheading gesture.

"No!" Wen Desi shook his head, "We are civilized people, not bandits."

"Then let them join us?"

"Can only be so." Wen Desi sighed, "Anyway, they can't go back."

So, the four tourists were taken onto the Fengcheng.

When they learned that they had traveled to the Ming Dynasty, they all collapsed.

"My God! I still have a mortgage to pay!" The young man cried.

"My stocks! My funds!" The old man beat his chest and stamped his feet.

Only the old lady was relatively calm: "It's good to be alive. It's good to be alive."

After a period of comfort and explanation, the four tourists finally accepted the reality.

It turned out that the old man was a retired navy engineer, the old lady was a retired teacher, the young man was a civil servant, and the young woman was a doctor.

"Hey, these are all talents we need!" Wang Luobin clapped his hands and laughed.

"Mr. Navy, you can help us manage the ship."
"Teacher, you can teach the children."
"Mr. Civil Servant, you can help with administration."
"Doctor, go to the Medical Group."

In this way, the four "stowaways" became members of the Transmigrators by mistake.

Their arrival also reminded the Transmigrators: Time travel is risky, and the wormhole is unstable. In the future, they must be more careful.
