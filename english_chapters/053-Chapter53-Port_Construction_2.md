Chapter 53 Port Construction (2)

With the completion of the wharf and road, the efficiency of unloading materials was greatly improved.

Crates of machines were transported to the campsite and installed in temporary simple sheds.

"This is the power station." Wang Luobin pointed to a shed, "Inside are two 500kW diesel generator sets."

"This is the telecommunications center." Xiao Zishan pointed to another shed, "Inside are radios and a small telephone exchange."

"This is the hospital." Shi Yishi pointed to a large tent, "Inside are operating tables and medicine cabinets."

The campsite began to take shape, looking like a small industrial town.

However, a new problem arose.

Water source.

Although they brought some bottled water and water purification tablets, it was far from enough for so many people's daily use. They needed to find a stable freshwater source.

"We have explored before." The leader of the geological prospecting team said, "There is groundwater here, but the water level is deep."

"Then dig wells." Wen Desi ordered.

"We have drilling rigs." The prospecting team leader said, "But we lack drill pipes."

"Make them ourselves!" Wang Luobin said, "We have steel pipes and welding machines."

So, the Industrial Group began to process drill pipes overtime.

A few days later, a simple drilling rig was set up in the center of the campsite.

"Start drilling!"

With the roar of the machine, the drill bit drilled deep into the ground.

10 meters, 20 meters, 30 meters... No water came out.

Everyone was anxious.

"Keep drilling!" Wen Desi gritted his teeth.

40 meters, 50 meters...

Suddenly, a stream of clear spring water gushed out from the wellhead.

"Water! Water is out!" Everyone cheered.

They tasted the well water. It was sweet and refreshing.

"Long live!"

With water, life was guaranteed. Everyone's morale was even higher.

They built a water tower beside the well and laid water pipes to deliver tap water to every corner of the campsite.

This was the first tap water system in the Ming Dynasty.
