# Chapter 15: Servants (Part One)

"We understand. Thank you, Master Gao." Wen Desi simply expressed gratitude without elaborating.

Gao Ju saw they were unwilling to discuss their ship and did not press. He summoned the servants who looked after the house: a middle-aged couple leading two teenagers, about thirteen or fourteen. All came forward and kowtowed.

"This household—though not born into my house—were people I saved from death in Jiangxi years ago. They are loyal and reliable."

Hearing their master speak thus, the family kowtowed again and again.

"Enough." Gao Ju instructed: "These gentlemen shall henceforth be your masters. Serve them diligently."

"Yes, we understand!" The family then kowtowed to Wen Desi's party. "We, your humble servants, greet our masters."

"This, this, this..." The three were startled and rose awkwardly. As modern people, suddenly having an entire family kneeling and kowtowing was bound to be uncomfortable.

"These are their indentures." Master Gao produced several papers. "They are sold absolutely; you may command them without hesitation."

"And this is the deed to this residence." He produced another document. "I had said I would buy a house on your behalf, but the timing is inconvenient. If you do not find this humble dwelling beneath you, please stay here for the time being."

"This..." The three exchanged glances. What a generous merchant! Though his intent to win them over was obvious, such liberality demonstrated sincerity.

Yet on closer thought, this windfall hid deeper meanings.

The house was his private property; he knew every detail. If he wanted to covertly investigate or monitor them, he would be in the shadows while they were in plain sight.

This family of servants had been in his employ for years. "Loyal and reliable"—to *him*, not necessarily to shady overseas merchants. If placed beside them to spy, the transmigrators' every move would effectively be under his control.

It felt like living in a glass house—stark naked.

Beyond currying favor, Master Gao was trying to keep them under his thumb. As for why—obviously the goods they brought had generated enormous profits.

Originally they had wanted to buy a house as a foothold, to expand gradually after the crossing. Now they had been handed a house and servants gratis. The situation had developed far beyond expectations.

However, refusing was unwise. Xiao Zishan calculated: the crossing-trade operations wouldn't continue for many more trips. As long as they acted carefully each time, nothing would be revealed. After the crossing, they could reconsider Guangzhou. For now, keep Master Gao content and let him keep selling their goods.

They exchanged glances. Wen Desi cupped his hands in thanks and accepted the documents. He took out a tael of silver as a customary gift for the kowtowing ceremony.

Master Gao was pleased. He ordered his servants to transport their silver and goods to the new residence, and had food, clothing, and supplies sent over—the utmost attentiveness.

Xiao Zishan, Wen Desi, and Wang Luobin conferred in low voices: since they were here, they might as well make the best of it. They would inspect the house and get a sense of the servants. They called the male servant over.

The man appeared quite aged; Xiao Zishan guessed he was at least in his fifties. He came and stood at attention, hands at his sides, face full of deference. Director Wen and Engineer Wang seemed uneasy, but Xiao Zishan remained composed. He first took a sip of tea and sat in silence before beginning his questions.

The male servant's original surname was Liu, given name Qing. He was originally from Jiangxi, tenant-farming about ten *mu*. In the forty-fifth year of Wanli, a flood destroyed his harvest, and the family fled. As they lay dying by the roadside, Master Gao happened to pass by on his way back from Nanjing. He took in over a dozen refugee families as bond servants, and Liu Qing was among the fortunate. Since then, he had been a slave of the Gao household.

After joining the household, he adopted the master's surname and became Gao Qing; his wife became Gao Xian. The couple had worked as general laborers in the outer yard. Less than half a month ago, they were reassigned here to look after this residence.

As for his age, he was actually only in his early forties. Exactly how old, even he wasn't sure. Xiao Zishan knew that in the old days, many farmers didn't know their precise ages—nothing unusual.

"Guarding this house must be better than working as laborers in the main residence?"

Gao Qing smiled bitterly: "Reporting to the master—it's less work here, more leisure, no one supervising us. But making ends meet is harder."

It turned out that when he and his wife worked at the main residence, though each earned only two *qian* per month, meals were free. Not only did they not go hungry, but their two children could eat their fill. Since being transferred here, his wages had risen to five *qian*, but they had to cook for themselves; firewood, rice, oil, salt, and vegetables all came out of pocket, and the children couldn't mooch meals anymore. Thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds were ravenous eaters; for a family of four to live on seven *qian* was truly a strain.

Wen Desi asked: "What do you mean? The children don't get wages—don't they also belong to Master Gao?"

"The children have never been assigned duties," Gao Qing shook his head. "Without duties, the household issues no money or grain. They depend entirely on their parents." He sighed. "I had hoped to get my daughter assigned to the inner quarters; she'd earn at least a string of cash. But she's not pretty enough, never selected. I asked the steward's wife for help—but she demands ten taels first. How could our family save that much?"

Corruption truly had ancient roots. The three marveled. Even becoming a maid required paying money. Then again, thinking of the *Dream of the Red Chamber*—how Wuer's family had to conduct a whole campaign just to get her a position at Daguanyuan—it was not so surprising.

"Now that you're in our service, are you content?" Xiao Zishan softened his tone.

Gao Qing glanced uneasily at these overseas-merchant masters who couldn't even dress themselves properly, and replied: "We are lowly servants; there is no question of content or not. Now that we belong to the masters, the masters may command us as they wish."

Xiao Zishan nodded and had him lead the way as they inspected the entire house. It was not large; each courtyard followed a layout of one main hall flanked by two side rooms. The first courtyard held the reception hall and study; the second had an upper floor for living quarters; the third contained the kitchen, firewood storage, and a mule-and-horse stable, plus a private well. Though the building was not new, it had been solidly constructed with blue bricks laid flat—very sturdy. Because it was intended for emergency refuge, furnishings were simple, but daily necessities were stocked. The kitchen was piled with supplies from the Gao residence: rice, salted meat, dried fish, firewood, oil, and salt. Gao Qing handed over an inventory list. Wen Desi had no interest and was about to say, "Keep it all for your family," when he noticed Xiao Zishan had taken the list and was examining it carefully.
