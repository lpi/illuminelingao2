# Chapter 30: The Guangzhou Undercover

From the start, the Executive Committee had targeted the Gao family's two children as a priority. Once formed, an adult's worldview is difficult to change. Adolescents, however, are far more malleable; they possess a natural irreverence toward authority, are easily moved by novelty, love adventure, and are eager to prove themselves the equals of adults—all qualities the transmigrators could exploit.

During each crossing, they spent considerable time with the two children, observing their personalities and capabilities. Compared to Gao Lujie, the boy Gao Di was more valuable—girls had smaller social circles and fewer opportunities to appear in public. Gao Di was also younger, with far more malleable views and character.

Gao Di was clever and quick. When Xiao Zishan taught him bookkeeping and arithmetic, he learned instantly. Wen Desi would send him on small errands, which he handled capably. When given modern candies and snacks, he always took them home to share with his sister—evidence of an unselfish nature and sense of responsibility.

When the siblings entered the study, they knelt stiffly on the floor. Beiwei's eyebrows shot up, but Wen Desi, knowing the man couldn't stand such acts of subservience, quickly stopped him.

"Stand up. What are you kneeling for? Do you think we're City Gods?" Wen Desi smiled faintly.

"We beg the masters to forgive our mother's offense." The children didn't rise; they spoke in unison and kowtowed together.

"As I said—ignorance is no crime. Both of you, please stand."

"We thank the masters for their grace." The siblings exchanged relieved glances and quickly stood.

"Gao Lujie, step outside first. I have words for Gao Di."

"I understand, sir." Gao Lujie withdrew. Beiwei went to the window; seeing she had truly left, he nodded.

Xiao Zishan asked: "Do you know Guangzhou well?"

"Yes—people at the Gao mansion often sent me on errands. A few coins each trip."

"Those playmates I asked about—do you still see them often?"

"Some were promoted to real duties; the rest are idle. They often invite me out to play."

"Are any reliable?"

Gao Di's head snapped up. "Does the master want new household members?"

A clever child indeed. Xiao Zishan nodded silently.

"We don't need that yet," he equivocated. "This isn't quite the same as selecting household members, though it's related."

"Then please instruct me, sir—what kind of person do you need?"

"A few children who know Guangzhou well. Each day, they'll report the city's news and market rates." Xiao Zishan listed the commodities he wanted tracked.

"Easy—just go to the guild teahouses and check the posted boards."

"Compile everything daily into a ledger using the bookkeeping method I taught you."

"I understand."

"Each month you'll receive an extra tael of silver as operating funds. Choose the people carefully. No one unreliable or prone to loose talk. Also, pay attention to news from the Gao household." Xiao Zishan fixed his eyes on the boy. "Anything important—don't write it down. Wait until we arrive and tell us directly."

With each instruction, Gao Di responded. Xiao Zishan noted trepidation on the boy's face, but excitement clearly overflowed.

"Does your family have anyone friendly inside the Gao household?"

"Yes—Uncle Chang, my father's sworn brother. He does odd jobs in the outer courtyard." He explained: this Gao Chang was his father's fellow townsman who had joined the household six or seven years ago. Strong and knowing some martial arts, he could have been promoted to guard, but his blunt speech and lack of money for bribes meant he was disliked. At twenty-five or twenty-six, still doing odd jobs, he hadn't even been assigned a wife.

"A bachelor?"

"Yes, but Uncle Chang takes it in stride—he rarely complains."

The four exchanged glances. A promising prospect: someone overlooked at their workplace would welcome a change of employers. Blunt speech implied honesty. Rarely complaining suggested a balanced temperament. And martial arts skills had their uses.

Of course, these were the nephew's words, possibly exaggerated. But this was a time of need; they couldn't be picky. Whether someone was suitable could only be known through actual use.

"Should I invite Uncle Chang over? He's off today."

"Good, go get him."

"I'll say Father is inviting him for a drink—he'll come."

Sharp instincts—without being told about the need for secrecy, he already understood. Though this child's cleverness might become a problem if not managed properly. Xiao Zishan's thoughts took a darker turn.

Shortly, Gao Chang arrived. Introduced by Gao Di, he kowtowed in greeting. They sized him up: not tall, but sturdy, with nimble movements.

Xiao Zishan asked about his background and service at the Gao household.

"...I've been doing odd jobs in the outer courtyard for six years."

"I see you cut a fine figure and you're capable. How is it you've always been just a laborer?"

"This humble one is naturally clumsy and can't talk well. That's why I've always been a laborer."

"Have you married?"

"No..." Gao Chang blushed. "Too poor—no woman would have me."

"You've served all these years; hasn't the family assigned you a wife?"

"Truly, this humble one is too poor. Even if assigned a woman, I couldn't keep her."

Xiao Zishan thought this man was decent: the masters had shown him no favor, yet he wouldn't speak ill of them.

"How does the Gao family treat you?"

"I'm just a servant. The masters give me clothes and food—that itself is kindness." He spoke with neither servility nor arrogance.

Xiao Zishan glanced at Beiwei. The former recon soldier suddenly sprang up and shoved him hard. Caught off guard, Gao Chang stumbled backward seven or eight paces before regaining his footing. Though startled, he simply smoothed his clothes and resumed his position.

Beiwei nodded. This man's lower-body stance was stable—he had skill.

"You know martial arts?" Xiao Zishan asked.

"Just country skills, practiced for self-defense. Nothing worth the masters' notice."

Xiao Zishan nodded and told Gao Di to see him out for drinks.

After Gao Di left, everyone was fairly satisfied. But how to recruit this man required further thought. They discussed upcoming work. They had established their first intelligence network—its purpose was less about gathering intelligence and more about testing whether Gao Di was suitable for such a role, and verifying whether the Gao family would prove loyal.

If Gao Qing stubbornly continued as Master Gao's spy, the next step would be finding replacements quickly.

"I think Gao Qing's attitude toward Master Gao is ambiguous." Beiwei said. "Judging by his wife and children, they don't look fully committed."

"I agree." Wen Desi nodded. "Gao Qing is simply cowed by Gao Ju's power; in reality, he has little genuine loyalty to his former master."

"What he fears most is following us far from home. We bear the title 'Australian sea merchants.' He's not from the seafaring regions where people are accustomed to sailing abroad."

"Let's win over his wife and children first. After today, he'll think twice before reporting."

"Will he still go?"

"I think so—just less often. Gao Qing is timid and indecisive. His former master's authority still looms; he still wants a fallback option. Until he's out of Gao Ju's sphere, we can't fully trust him."

"We need our own house soon."

"Right. For now, we want the convenience of trade, but before the final crossing, we must secure new property."

"Gao Di is promising, but he's just a child. He can't handle buying real estate or servants."

"What about Gao Chang..."

"Someone's there!" Beiwei suddenly shouted. He flashed to the window, grabbed a rock from a potted plant, and hurled it outside. A muffled thump—it seemed to hit something.

The three city-dwelling otaku panicked, collapsing in their chairs, barely daring to breathe.

"What happened?" Wen Desi asked shakily.

"A shadow moved across the opposite courtyard." Beiwei fumed. "Conducting reconnaissance before dark—quite audacious."

"An eavesdropper?"

"Must be. The approach was zigzagging toward the window."

"One of Gao Ju's people?"

"Unlikely. Gao Ju already has eyes here. Our business is going smoothly; he has no reason to anger us."

"Then who?"

"Probably people who envy him." Xiao Zishan recalled what Gao Ju had said when giving them the house: *"Lately, with these rare goods appearing on the market, I've attracted considerable attention."* This must be one of those "attentive" parties.

Things were becoming complicated. Thinking of how distracted Gao Ju had seemed today, their thoughts all grew tense.
