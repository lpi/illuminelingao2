# Chapter 7: Striking Gold — Gao Ju's Bewilderment

"May the almighty God of Traversal bless us. May the Timespace Management Bureau approve our operation. Amen."

Wen Desi murmured these words, shouldered his assault pack, and was the first to pass through the wormhole. Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin followed close behind.

Wen Desi was an outdoor enthusiast with a full set of camping and hiking gear at home—well-equipped indeed. However, he chose only quick-dry clothing, a survival kit, and a multi-purpose knife. He also brought an assault pack to carry the wormhole exit with him.

As for weapons, Wen Desi had considered his all-steel crossbow and hunting knife, but on reflection, if something did happen, three city-dwelling homebodies going head-to-head with Ming-era men in strength and ferocity seemed rather dubious. Since the wormhole exit could be moved at will, they could simply open it and escape if danger arose. As a precaution, Wen Desi produced three stab-resistant vests, some smoke grenades, and a few stun guns—useful for getting away in an emergency.

Xiao Zishan had no such equipment. He went straight to one of the ubiquitous military surplus and labor-protection stores and bought a set of training fatigues, a pair of high-top liberation boots, and a knock-off military backpack.

Wang Luobin wore his usual outdoor work clothes. Each person carried two days' worth of compressed rations and a few bottles of purified water, along with some emergency medicine. This was merely to minimize the chances of opening the wormhole and risking exposure.

The promotional items Xiao Zishan had brought were quite varied. At first they planned to bring only glass cups and plastic compacts, but they eventually decided it would be better to bring a sample of each—after all, they had no clear idea of the aesthetic tastes or needs of Ming-era people. Bringing more samples would help them feel out the market.

After determining the crossing point, Xiao Zishan visited the library several times and roughly located Haopan Street's present-day position. He found a budget hotel nearby and rented a room. Then, over several consecutive nights, Wen Desi cracked open the wormhole briefly to observe the environment on the other side—Haopan Street was, after all, a commercial district, densely populated. Opening the wormhole carelessly might land them in someone's bedroom or right in the middle of a busy street. To be safe, Wen Desi even ordered infrared night-vision goggles online. If the location proved unsuitable, they would have to move and try again—pure luck.

Based on Wen Desi's nighttime observations, the space on the other side appeared to be the back courtyard of some residence. Rows of gray-brick tile-roofed buildings were visible, and after dark, there was no one around at all.

None of them had any real idea what would happen after they crossed—and nowhere to consult. The preliminary plan was to cross over, hide in a secluded spot for a while, and as soon as it grew light, find a shop, walk in, display their wares, and see how the other party reacted.

There was no way to predict how seventeenth-century people would respond to these three strangely dressed individuals—whether they would avoid them or trigger a crowd of bewildered onlookers. Communications would also be a barrier, though according to Director Wen, Cantonese preserved more elements of ancient Chinese than any other dialect, so the difference might not be as great as with modern Mandarin.

They set the time for around five in the morning—*mao* first watch in ancient parlance. Too early and the sky would still be dark; though there was no explicit curfew in the Ming and Qing eras, nightlife was scant and pedestrians rare—if spotted by night-watchmen or yamen runners, they would be questioned. Too late and people would already be up and about, greatly increasing the chance of someone witnessing the wormhole opening—three people materializing out of thin air would be the talk of all Guangzhou.

These past few days, the great Master Gao Ju had been unable to sleep soundly at night. The dogs in the back warehouse courtyard never stopped barking after dark. His guards had gone to check several times but found nothing amiss. The warehouse yard was merely a storage area; its walls were not only high but flanked by side-courts and alleys. Even a first-rate cat burglar would have difficulty sneaking anyone in. Thus suspicion and superstition took hold; people said that at midnight, an eerie light would sometimes appear in the courtyard. For a time, the Gao household was on edge—daytime was manageable, but after dark, the warehouse became a place everyone avoided. Even the heavens had been strange lately: thunder rumbling at dusk, yet no rain; the sky frequently turning an uncanny shade of purple. Master Gao himself had not been in good spirits; even his favorite concubine had not been graced with his company.

It was not ghosts that Master Gao feared—rather, it was that this back courtyard warehouse held the key to his livelihood and his life. Of the hundred-odd shops on Haopan Street, every single one had made its fortune through foreign trade with barbarians. Now, all the goods and silver he had acquired from the Folangjiren the previous winter had been converted into what the Folangjiren favored: raw silk, silk fabric, and porcelain. He had also prepared large quantities of saltpeter and ironware—items the court had explicitly banned from export. If something went wrong, it would be his head—and losing his head would be the least of it. Half of his vast enterprise belonged to Eunuch Yang in the palace. Though Eunuch Yang was not as prominent as the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old, it would be no trouble at all for him to reduce Gao's entire family to ash.

Tonight the dogs were quite calm—not a bark all night. Master Gao managed a good night's sleep. Because of his unease these past days, he had been sleeping alone in his inner study. Shortly after the fifth watch, he rose. Attended by a maid, he brushed his teeth with green salt and washed up, half-closing his eyes as he gazed at the still dim sky, speculating about the weather and whether he might take a turn in the courtyard for some exercise...

From the back courtyard came another burst of frantic barking. Master Gao startled; his pleasant morning mood was shattered. He set his cup down hard and was about to call for someone to investigate when his head guard came scrambling and tumbling into the courtyard. Master Gao's face changed color. This was the inner study—male servants were not to enter without summons. For the guard leader to burst in so desperately meant something major had occurred.

"Master! Master! The warehouse courtyard... in the courtyard... there are... there are..."

"Calm down, speak slowly." Master Gao had been dealing in foreign trade and smuggling for many years; he had long cultivated a steady composure in the face of crisis. He steadied himself after only a moment of alarm.

"The back courtyard—the back courtyard—three Japanese have arrived!"

Hearing that three Japanese had appeared in his back courtyard, Master Gao remained somewhat mystified as to how they had gotten in—but as long as they were merely people, things could be managed. He relaxed a bit: "Just a few Japanese have you frightened like this! Tie them up and lock them in the firewood shed." He waved his sleeve with impressive poise, though his mind was turning rapidly.

Could it be that Old Wang on Youyu Islet had sent someone? Had a foreign ship now dropped anchor? Gao Ju knew the Folangjiren often had Japanese servants, but this was not the season for ships to arrive. Besides, as his business partner, Old Wang would never send a few Japanese without giving advance notice—and certainly not sneak them into his back courtyard.

"Master, these Japanese are... truly strange!" the guard hastened to report. "We didn't dare act rashly."

"Useless! Incompetent!" Master Gao raged, though inside he felt a twinge of fear. Though he was a merchant from another province residing here, he had heard plenty of tales of the vicious Japanese pirates who had once plundered the coast. The very reason Haopan Street had been enclosed within the city walls was because of those marauding pirates. For these three to slip into his back courtyard in the dead of night, undetected... Master Gao recalled what Japanese-speaking sea merchants had told him: that Japan had certain extraordinary warrior-sages who could conceal themselves, move unseen, and kill invisibly...

At this thought, great fear seized him. His earlier notion of simply having his men seize them faded away. He hurried to ask: "Where are these... people now?"

"We have them surrounded with bows and firearms in the back courtyard," the guard glanced at Master Gao's expression. "From their manner, it seems they bear no ill intent..."

"Fools!" No ill intent, yet they came to his back courtyard—what for, to borrow soy sauce?

"Master, these men carry no weapons. This is something the leader among them tossed to me"—the guard quickly produced a small box from his jacket—"He also said a great deal, but I couldn't understand much of it."

Master Gao received the paper box with suspicion—and was immediately startled. It felt impossibly smooth to the touch, as if coated with glaze. But the rough edges told him at once that it was made of paper.

*How strange indeed*, he thought. He opened it carefully. Inside was a small, oval, flattened container—neither jade nor porcelain, likewise covered in a glaze-like finish, but in a dazzling shade of pink never seen on any porcelain. It was very light in his hand. Master Gao, having dealt in foreign goods for years and seen many things, could not for the life of him tell what it was made of. In shape it resembled a woman's powder compact. He tried lifting the lid; it opened like a clamshell at his touch. Inside, the lid gleamed brightly. He peered closely—and his face went ashen!
