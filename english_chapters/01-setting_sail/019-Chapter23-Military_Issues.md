# Chapter 23: Military Issues

The meeting lasted nearly the entire day, ending only after dark. Many matters remained to be resolved—down to operational details—but at least they had achieved a preliminary division of labor, established a rough framework, and set direction. Everyone now had a general idea of what to do.

Even so, excitement permeated everyone's minds. The Committee had made clear that outside the office building, no one could discuss crossing-related matters. But in reality, small groups strolling along the weed-overgrown running track continued quietly discussing the meeting and differing opinions. Among them were like-minded individuals deepening bonds through conversation—mainly by venting dissatisfaction.

The sources of discontent varied: the direction of a particular industry, an equipment list, or perhaps just someone's appearance. But wherever there was dissatisfaction, intimacy grew—and nothing could satisfy everyone. Small grievances began accumulating from the start.

The Executive Committee, immersed in the atmosphere of "a victorious conference, a unifying conference, a successful conference," naturally didn't notice. At the moment, Committee members were in private discussions with the core members of the Athletics Group.

The so-called Athletics Group, though currently responsible for physical training, was in reality the embryonic form of the transmigrators' future apparatus of force. It had been given this harmless-sounding name purely for cover.

Throughout the meeting, the Athletics Group had made almost no statements—a deliberate arrangement by Wen Desi. The Athletics Group's scope was too sensitive for open discussion, even among transmigrator cadres.

The current Athletics Group leader was a sales manager—though that wasn't why he became group leader. He had been a military officer, a graduate of the Infantry Academy, had served as a company commander in a field army, and had also worked as a staff officer at headquarters. He was the transmigrators' best military foundation.

He had a very impressive name: Xi Yazhou.

Xi Yazhou and his Athletics Group colleagues were mostly demobilized veterans. Not many, but the military bearing their service had given them was still clearly perceptible.

"Director Wen, this is Beiwei—formerly of the reconnaissance battalion, XX Military Region."

"This is Zhao De—formerly of the XX Naval Water Police District."

"This is He Ming," Xi Yazhou introduced the oldest one with reverence. "He served as an infantry company commander in the Liangshan rotation war."

This introduction commanded respect from everyone. This comrade approaching fifty had dark skin, slightly graying close-cropped hair, and sat with his back ramrod straight.

"Most transmigrators are laymen when it comes to military matters." Wen Desi chose his words carefully. "Quite a few know a lot about weapons and theory, but it's all armchair strategy. Few have actually served or touched a real gun. I'd like to hear the Athletics Group's thoughts—you're the professionals."

"I'd like to first confirm roughly how many will participate. What's the ratio of veterans and militiamen?"

"Hard to say now. Ultimately, probably five to six hundred. About ten more have the qualifications you mentioned."

"Then we'll have to take the all-people-soldiers approach." Xi Yazhou said. "This population base can't sustain even a modestly sized dedicated armed force." He paused. "With fourteen people, even if they were all Rambos, it wouldn't be enough. We need comprehensive military training. Everyone participates."

"Even women?"

"Yes—though Auntie Tian can be excused. Men of all ages; women under forty."

"What kind of training?" Xiao Zishan hoped it wouldn't be like university military training.

"We'll draw up a plan." Xi Yazhou thought. "The environment we'll face is completely different. So the curriculum needs modification. Initially: drill, basic field fortifications, disassembly and live-fire training with one long and one short light weapon each, plus simple combat techniques.

"First, we'll form a small squad of fifteen to twenty, mainly veterans, for early security and reconnaissance—our standing force. The Athletics Group will also recruit young people in good physical condition for more comprehensive training. Scale of about fifty—our core militia."

"These people can't be taken off regular duties."

"Of course," Xi Yazhou said. "That's why they're core militia—just more training content. They'll be the backbone in combat."

"How much time?"

"Basic training is thirty days; core militia ninety days. If we find promising people, I'd like to keep training them right up to the crossing." Xi Yazhou calculated. "Also, physical training must continue—at least daily long-distance running. The Athletics Group will handle all this. Weapons training will need another location. Are there shooting clubs in this county?"

"I think there's one—specifically to attract Hong Kong tourists."

"Good. Too bad guns are hard to come by." Xi Yazhou sighed. "Ammo at clubs is expensive. We can only let people get a feel—not really train them."

Xiao Zishan shifted uneasily. He sensed they were about to discuss extremely sensitive matters. For a moment he wondered if he should excuse himself.

"The weapons issue is indeed very difficult. Too sensitive."

"Can we get real guns?" Wang Luobin wouldn't give up. Though he claimed to have made N guns himself, they were all made from ordinary steel—very different from proper arsenal production.

Modern firearms use a wide variety of materials—over a dozen types of steel alone for different components.

"It's possible." Xi Yazhou knew something about this. "But I'd advise against it. The risk is high."

"Then we'll have to count on Industry to make them." Wang Luobin was disappointed.

"Make them here in this timespace?"

"We have equipment, talent, and materials aren't hard to buy. What we produce would be at least as good as Hualong-made guns."

Wen Desi shook his head: "Too dangerous. Illegal guns are a priority crackdown target. If we did it, the police would come knocking within days."

"Then what? There's no way for us to get weapons."

"How about bribing a shooting club for some real steel?" Someone was dreaming.

"You might as well go straight to the Armed Forces Department!" Xiao Zishan had to strongly object.

"Director Wen, how many weapons can we actually get? Give us a bottom line."

Wen Desi hesitated. These days, even hiding a shotgun could land you in court. But Xi Yazhou was their future military backbone—some show of trust was necessary.

"We have very little." Wen Desi never recorded these figures; they were all in his head.

Currently confirmed: over a dozen shotguns of various brands, calibers, and models—some old single-shot types, some the five-shot variety that often appeared in news reports. Calibers included 12, 16, and 20 gauge. All domestic old brands: Pigeon, Eagle, Flying Dragon, Double Ring—holdovers from hunting enthusiasts of the past. Shells, primers, and reloading tools were complete, but the guns were generally old; some had over thirty years of history.

What could actually be called rifles were two Emei-brand small-caliber sporting rifles in good condition, with competition sights, plus a small amount of ammunition.

One rifled hunting gun of unknown brand from East Germany, chambered in 8x57mm. A few casings, no ammunition.

Also several Shanghai-brand and Gongzi-brand air pistols, one a competition model with sights.

"Not a single real gun." Someone was disappointed.

"Not bad at all. Shotgun buckshot is effective at 35 meters; slugs at 70 meters—no worse than flintlocks, and far superior to matchlocks. Plus our rate of fire is an advantage." Xi Yazhou clearly wasn't disappointed. "The small-caliber sporting rifles have excellent accuracy and scopes—they can serve as sniper rifles to suppress important targets at range. I recall small-caliber rifles can achieve 200-meter effective range."

"Not much stopping power, right? The enemy will mostly be wearing full armor."

"Where would they get that much armor? Just ragged uniforms."

"That's the Qing. Our Great Ming wasn't that shabby..."

When someone was about to derail into Ming-fans versus Qing-haters, a quiet voice came from the corner:

"Just aim for the head."

This was Beiwei—a stocky former recon soldier who had sat there expressionlessly since the meeting began. Everyone shuddered.

Xi Yazhou nodded. "What level of equipment the enemy has—that's for the history buffs. The Intelligence Group needs to give us a capabilities table of late-Ming factions: combat strength, weapons and equipment, tactics, classic battles. That way we can make targeted plans."

"No problem." Intelligence agreed immediately.

They went over the details. The weapons issue was complicated; they decided to first gather intelligence before considering solutions.
