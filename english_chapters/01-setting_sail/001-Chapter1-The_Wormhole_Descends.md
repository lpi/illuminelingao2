# Chapter 1: The Wormhole Descends

The protagonist of this story—or rather, one of the protagonists—was named Xiao Zishan.

Xiao Zishan was born in the late 1970s. He was an ordinary person: ordinary family, ordinary looks, ordinary talents, and not the type to strive for self-improvement. His academic performance was therefore mediocre. Thanks to the expansion of university admissions, he too became a university student.

After graduation, Xiao Zishan bounced between several companies in the Pearl River Delta. He had been cheated by unscrupulous bosses and harbored unrealistic dreams, but ultimately landed a decently paying job at a foreign enterprise. He worked diligently to earn his wages—and just like that, six or seven years passed. Before he knew it, he was thirty and still renting someone else's apartment. He had few hobbies beyond a fondness for history and obscure books. By the time our story begins, he could barely remember his ex-girlfriend's face anymore—he still belonged to that crowd celebrating Singles' Day on November 11th.

On the evening where our story opens, the weather was foul. The pitch-black sky flickered with lightning—conditions that had persisted for nearly half a month. Sometimes the flashes were followed by torrential downpours; other times there was only rumbling thunder. Rumors of a major earthquake had circulated so long that people had grown accustomed to them. Xiao Zishan stepped off the bus with a yawn, eyelids puffy, legs weak, hair unkempt—the disheveled bearing of the "working poor." He had not been home for over a full day. As a newly minted regional manager, preparing for an inspection by his superiors had kept him in the office poring over reports for ages. Particularly troublesome was accounting for all those reimbursement expenses.

To call Xiao Zishan a corporate parasite would be a gross injustice. He had been in this position for barely three months. During his six or seven years at the company, he had remained stuck at the basic level of regional sales representative. Layer upon layer of leadership above him had been harvested like scallions—cut down crop after crop—while he persisted like the root that remained.

Three months prior, leadership had rotated yet again, leaving behind the customary pile of inexplicable reports and invoices. Only this time, he was appointed regional manager.

If this position had come two years earlier, he would have wept with gratitude. But now—Xiao Zishan wanted only to say to all those leaders, past and present: *Go to hell.*

Under the global financial crisis, the company had been half-paralyzed since the previous year. Familiar colleagues in the regional office had disappeared one after another. The remaining business was so light that he could handle it alone with leisure to spare. This appointment, coming without any salary adjustment for all those stagnant years and without any directives for developing business—based on his six or seven years of professional experience, it wasn't hard to understand: this was the prelude to shuttering the regional office. He was merely a caretaker, and once all affairs were wrapped up, he would be packing his bags.

But the paperwork still had to be done... if only to keep collecting that unchanged salary for a few more months.

Xiao Zishan sighed for the twentieth time. He carried a large travel bag—both the bag itself and its contents were promotional giveaways that had accumulated in the office over the years: kitchen aprons, undershirts, toothbrushes, ballpoint pens, and more. All crude little commodities. Apart from a few items, he had no real use for any of it. Yet he had greedily taken it all back—*when poor, one's ambitions shrink*—a saying that fit him perfectly.

His rented room was reasonably clean and tidy. After a shower, his spirits perked up unexpectedly. He casually booted up his computer and went online.

Orson Welles said the lottery is the painkiller of the poor; the internet, then, was the fountain of joy for people like Xiao Zishan—whether online games, BBSes, or the web novels he devoured daily.

Before he started working, Xiao Zishan had been something of a literary youth, devouring all manner of miscellaneous books indiscriminately. He also liked to dabble in writing, but lacking natural talent, he never made a living from it.

He regularly visited a few BBSes. He was no celebrity on the forums, but the eclectic hodgepodge of information, theories, and knowledge they provided—the debates, the arguments, the kaleidoscope of human nature—even the performances of certain hypocrites—were far more interesting than the mask-laden workplace.

As usual, he checked the hot posts of the day.

**"I have discovered a wormhole leading to the Ming Dynasty! It's absolutely true!"**

Seeing this title, Xiao Zishan couldn't help but chuckle. Were people so addled by reading time-travel novels these days? Or were they so dissatisfied with their circumstances that they yearned to start over in another world?

Then he noticed the post was by Director Wen. Director Wen was one of the "survivalist fanatics" on this BBS whom Xiao Zishan rather admired. Beyond his broad knowledge, his meticulous consideration of time-travel and survival issues was rare indeed. It was a shame Director Wen didn't write time-travel novels—if he did, Xiao Zishan would certainly follow them... though only the pirated versions, naturally.

"Another of Director Wen's wild ideas, I suppose." Xiao Zishan casually clicked on the post. With that click, his world began to change.

To put it in clichéd terms: *the wheel of fate began to turn.*

**One week later.**

"This is the wormhole?" Xiao Zishan peered cautiously at the luminous object before him. Strictly speaking, it was not quite a proper circle—a faintly blue light—not far from what he had imagined a wormhole to be. The difference was that its glow was not intense, and its size was much smaller: only about the size of a bathroom mirror.

"It's quite small," said Wang Luobin. He, like Xiao Zishan, was among the first to communicate with Director Wen and decide to come see for themselves.

"Applying pressure to the edge can enlarge it." Wen Desi sat on the closed toilet lid. With three people crammed into the bathroom, it was rather crowded. "This opening can be expanded or contracted—all you need is symmetrical force along the diameter. Enlarging and shrinking the opening is synchronous in both timespaces," Director Wen explained. "When the opening is reduced to 210 millimeters, the wormhole closes and can no longer connect the timespaces."

"Can you really travel back and forth through it?" In Xiao Zishan's experience, time-travel was strictly one-way—either you were hit by a car, struck by lightning, or at mildest got lost somewhere. The common feature was that you never came back.

"If I couldn't return, I wouldn't have been able to make that post, and you wouldn't be here now," said Director Wen. "I estimate that after crossing over, the destination corresponds to the location where the crossing originates."

"You should have bought a lottery ticket, Director Wen," Xiao Zishan murmured. "Discovering a wormhole in your bathroom has a lower probability than winning the jackpot."

"This isn't the jackpot?" Wen Desi laughed contentedly. "Is there any lottery that can win you an entire world?"

"Director Wen, didn't you always say: 'Solo, bidirectional, low-profile time-travel is the true way'?" Wang Luobin recalled the old BBS discussions about crossing over.

"That's right." Wen Desi pointed at the wormhole. "Do you know what's on the other side? It's a world!" He waved his arms excitedly. "Through this, I can possess an entire planet, an entire universe!"

"You're going to conquer the world all by yourself?" Xiao Zishan expressed serious doubt.

"That's why I made that post..." Wen Desi seemed somewhat reluctant. "Besides, the other side is not a pleasant timespace."

"What timespace is it?"

"Roughly the Tianqi reign. I found Tianqi Tongbao coins."

Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin both drew a sharp breath—the new world Director Wen had found was an era overrun by eunuchs.
