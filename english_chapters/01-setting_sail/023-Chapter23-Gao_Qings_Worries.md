# Chapter 23: Gao Qing's Worries

Spring in the City of Five Rams was gradually drawing to a close, yet the weather showed no sign of warmth. Gao Qing sat in the courtyard, staring blankly at the sky. Nearly two months had passed since he became a servant of the Australian masters.

At the time of his reassignment, Master Gao had given him special instructions: report all the Australian masters' movements back to him. And he had made promises—if the Australian masters left and never returned, or if something went wrong, he would take Gao Qing's entire family back into his household. He wouldn't let them end up on the streets.

Gao Qing and his wife had discussed several times what would happen if the Australian masters wanted to take them to Australia. Could they beg the masters to leave them behind?

These Australian masters were generous to their servants. Knowing his family's hardship, they gave extra monthly rice and wages for his son. But they were foreign sea merchants who would eventually return home. If they truly wanted to take the family to Australia, what then? By rights: these masters owned his family; wherever the masters went, the servants must follow—this was the natural order. Yet he didn't want to be uprooted again. When famine struck and he sold himself in his home village, he had already left his native soil. If he truly had to go to that Australia, ten thousand *li* away... Surely it was a barbarous land. Even if they possessed ingenious gadgets, how could it compare to China? Though Guangzhou wasn't his hometown, after living here all these years, he had grown attached.

Think as he might, his worries were endless. He had been in Master Gao's household for many years and knew that Portuguese merchants typically waited for favorable winds in June and set sail. The Australian merchants probably departed around the same time—would they want to take his family along?

He sighed again, squinting at the back courtyard gate. Steward Yan would be coming soon. By his count, the Australian masters were due any day now.

These past two months, roughly every two weeks, the three masters would arrive and stay for several days. He never knew when they came or how they entered the house. Only when daylight arrived would he find the gate to their courtyard already open, heaps of goods piled in the hall and under the eaves.

This always struck him as deeply mysterious—and the mystery carried a hint of fear. Though Master Gao had hinted or outright ordered him, even promised rewards, to uncover the Australian merchants' secrets, he hadn't dared. Sneaking into their courtyard would be easy enough—but what if he saw something he shouldn't...

Gao Qing knew the cardinal rule for servants: never learn what you shouldn't. Whether the master was from the Great Ming or from Australia.

Gao Di, however, didn't understand his father's thoughts. He came running over. "Dad, Mom's asking: when are the masters coming? She wants to prepare food. Last time Master Wang said he wanted a proper meal to try Ming cuisine."

"Should be any day now—the timing's about right." Gao Qing counted on his fingers. "Do you have the account book ready?"

"All ready. Last time at month-end, the masters reviewed it and praised me for keeping complete, careful records." Gao Di tilted his chin up proudly. "Master Wang even corrected my spelling. And that Master Xiao said he'd teach me something called Arabic numerals later—faster than what the accountants use."

"Good, good—as long as the masters are pleased." Gao Qing's words were vague. Having the children find favor with the masters was certainly good. If the masters were Chinese, it would mean excellent prospects for the children. But—alas! They were foreigners. Even if they didn't take the whole family, taking just one or two of the children—he couldn't bear it.

"I noticed Master Wen really likes Sister. Every time he calls her over to talk and gives her things. Do you think he'll take her as a concubine?"

These words struck Gao Qing's heart heavily. His face darkened. After a long silence, he said: "That depends on her fate." But inwardly he was unwilling.

While he brooded, he heard the gate—Steward Yan had arrived. Gao Qing hurried to greet him, seating him at the stone table, and sent his son to fetch tea and snacks.

"Old Gao, the Australian merchants should arrive any day now. What about the task the master assigned you?" Steward Yan dispensed with pleasantries.

"Reporting to you, sir, I really haven't been able to discover anything." Gao Qing knew this conversation was inevitable. "Those masters are very cunning. They never let anyone follow them into their quarters. And they always come and go without a trace."

"It's been two months, and you're still saying the same few lines. Truly useless." Steward Yan had always been Master Gao's confidant; he'd never paid attention to this menial servant who wasn't even permitted in the inner courtyard.

"Yes, yes, I'm dim-witted."

"How am I supposed to report to the master?" Steward Yan rolled his eyes. "The master is very displeased with you..."

"Please, Steward Yan, put in a good word for me..." Gao Qing was getting flustered. He fumbled at his waist and produced two *qian* of silver—his savings from the past two months, meant to buy fabric for the children's clothes. Steward Yan's half-true, half-false words had frightened him. Though he was no longer a servant of the Gao household, he didn't dare entrust his fate to these Australian masters either.

Steward Yan took the silver, weighed it briefly, and tucked it into his sleeve. "I'll cover for you with the master for now. But this matter—you can hide on the first, but not the fifteenth. One way or another, you must get to the bottom of these people!"

"Yes, yes, I understand."

"The moment the merchants arrive, bring them over immediately. At any hour."

"Yes, I understand."

Steward Yan departed. Gao Qing wiped the sweat from his forehead; his brow furrowed even more. Spying for Master Gao would ultimately offend his current masters. Setting aside the Australian masters' kindness—this would be ingratitude. Just the act of prying into and betraying his masters' secrets was disloyalty, probably a serious offense anywhere. Even if he didn't die, he'd lose a layer of skin. But if he ignored Master Gao's orders, he'd have no chance of returning to that household later—let alone that dealing with a lowly servant like him would present no difficulty for Master Gao.

While lost in thought, a sworn brother from the Gao household, Gao Chang, arrived carrying a large food box—cured delicacies Master Gao was sending to the Australian masters. Gao Qing forced himself to seem cheerful and called his wife and daughter out to take it to the kitchen.

"That bastard Steward Yan came to shake you down again?" Gao Chang was about twenty-five or twenty-six, a sturdy young man. He and Gao Qing were from the same hometown; he too had fled famine to Guangzhou and, with Gao Qing as guarantor, had sold himself to the Gao household. Both worked as laborers in the outer courtyard. Being from the same hometown and watching out for each other, they had sworn brotherhood.

"Alas." Gao Qing hung his head and mumbled.

"Brother, you're too timid," Gao Chang said indignantly. "You belong to the Australian masters now. Why bother with him? The masters are generous and let you save some money—and you go stuff it down that dog's hole!"

"Don't say more, brother. It's complicated." Gao Qing gazed at the sky above the courtyard wall. "This whole family... I fear we'll still need to rely on Master Gao in the future." He said no more.

"Strange. Your whole family's indentures were given to the Australian masters. Why would you need to rely on Master Gao? Don't tell me the masters don't want you?"

"No, nothing like that. The masters treat our family very well. Generous and speak kindly. All good people."

"Then why want to go back to the Gao household? At Master Gao's, brother, you were just a laborer—a slave among slaves. Nothing like now—practically a steward. I'm envious."

"But they're foreign sea merchants after all!"

"So what? They're not the red-haired, green-eyed Portuguese, all hairy and reeking. The masters speak oddly and dress strangely, but they're still Chinese."

"They'll leave someday. What if they want to take the whole family?"

Gao Chang suddenly understood—this was his sworn brother's worry. He himself didn't care. An orphan since childhood, still single, with no ties—anywhere was the same. But his brother had a family; putting himself in those shoes, the caution was understandable.

"Brother's concerns are valid. But in my view—if you go, you go. This Great Ming may be fine, but it's not *our* Great Ming. A servant here, a servant in Australia—how much worse could it be? These masters are kindhearted; if your whole family follows, you surely won't suffer." He smiled. "If I were you, I'd go along and see the sights of this 'little China overseas' called Australia."

"What you say makes sense, brother. But I don't want to die far from home." Gao Qing let out a long sigh. "Years ago, when famine struck and we needed to survive, I abandoned the old homestead and ancestral graves to flee. Thanks to Master Gao taking us in, we came here—over ten years now. The house, the ancestors' graves—probably all gone... I've given up any thought of going home..." As he spoke, tears fell; his voice choked. "I'm past forty now—not long for this world. To be buried in foreign soil in my old age—that would be dying with eyes still open."

Seeing his brother's sorrow, Gao Chang offered consoling words. But inwardly he disagreed. When a Gao household slave died, only those with status could use the master's gift money and savings to hold a Buddhist service and purchase a burial plot. Ordinary slaves received a cheap coffin and were carted to the paupers' graveyard outside the city to be carelessly buried. Did his brother want to stay just for that? He felt a sudden bleakness.

This muddling youth, who had spent twenty-odd years as a servant just getting by, felt for the first time a flash of something: *Perhaps the world shouldn't be like this...*
