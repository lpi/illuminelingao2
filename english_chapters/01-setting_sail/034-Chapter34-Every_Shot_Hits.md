"That's the *Xuanzhu* boat." Ran Yao pointed out a flower boat on the embankment through the Xiang-fei bamboo blind.

Lin Shenhe raised his binoculars and slowly adjusted the focus. The sky outside the window was already darkening somewhat; the light was soft. Perfect weather.

This was a tavern at White Goose Pool. Yesterday, the escort-bureau men had reserved this private room on the third floor's highest level. Ran Yao and Beiwei had conducted a full day of observation here and had figured out the entire situation.

The criminals had chosen their hiding spot well: "He" embankment was the outermost embankment at White Goose Pool, and the *Xuanzhu* was the outermost boat moored there. One sweep of the oar and they'd be on the broad Pearl River. Easy to board and disembark, easy to avoid attention, and easy to escape if trouble arose.

Reconnaissance had also revealed that the gang had placed two more lookouts nearby. One was on a small congee-selling boat moored at "Ren" embankment, just one embankment away from "He." The other was on the shore, selling medicine.

On the flower boat, there should be two men standing guard. One was fixed on the rear deck; the other moved constantly on and off the boat—the escort guards had told Ran Yao this was the flower boat's bouncer.

Lin Shenhe adjusted the focus bit by bit, observing the slope below, calculating shooting distances. From here to the end of the embankment was about 100 meters. The *Xuanzhu* was moored farther from the other flower boats, standing somewhat alone at the embankment's end. This was probably a security buffer the criminals had deliberately maintained. Unfortunately for them, this also made his shooting easier—if the boats were moored side by side like the others, he wouldn't be able to see clearly what was happening aboard.

Was Director Wen really on this flower boat? Was he enjoying soft fragrance and warm jade in this den of pleasure, or being tortured hideously? Hard to say.

He mentally "rolled call" on his targets, one by one. All were thin, dark-complexioned men—since arriving in this timespace, he hadn't seen a single fat person. Everyone had studied photos of these individuals repeatedly before the operation—including the madam and prostitutes, all memorized.

If any of the women showed unusual behavior, they'd have to be killed too—even women. Beiwei had specifically warned him, citing numerous examples of Vietnamese female special agents from the Sino-Vietnamese War as education.

What grudge did he have against them? Though these weren't good people, emotionally speaking, they were strangers to him just like Director Wen. Lin Shenhe shook his head, trying not to overthink. As a transmigrator, anyone who endangered the transmigrators' interests could be killed.

Having confirmed each target's position and distance, he put down the binoculars and dragged over a table. He placed a modified pillow on it—prone shooting was far more accurate than kneeling. He could lie on the table and shoot.

"When you hear firecrackers downstairs, start shooting." Ran Yao reminded him again, then hurried downstairs. He checked his watch: 5:20.

Lin Shenhe removed his helmet, then took off his bulky outer jacket. Clothing thickness could affect shooting accuracy. After positioning himself prone on the table, he adjusted his body angle with his left elbow as the pivot, aiming the rifle at the target.

The first target was chosen by Ran Yao: the medicine peddler, stationed at the entrance to "He" embankment.

In an instant, the peddler's head filled the entire scope. Lin Shenhe slightly raised his abdomen off the table so that his breathing movements and major blood-vessel pulses wouldn't affect his shooting. To achieve first-shot hit at 100 meters outdoors with an unfamiliar rifle required utmost concentration. He swallowed and said into the walkie-talkie: "Lin Shenhe ready."

Beiwei's team lay in ambush on a small rowboat 100 meters from the *Xuanzhu*.

Xiao Zishan waited with the escort-bureau pickup team and two mule carts a bit farther away.

As each team reported ready over the walkie-talkie, Ran Yao felt the surroundings grow quieter. His five-shot shotgun was chambered; a hunting knife was ready to draw. He reminded himself once more: this was a rescue operation, not an arrest.

The instant the firecrackers crackled to life, Lin Shenhe squeezed the trigger. His index finger moved so smoothly his right hand barely felt it. The first bullet went slightly wide, kicking up a puff of dust from the ground.

Almost without pause, purely by reflex—eject, chamber, fire—a red dot appeared on the medicine peddler's head, and he collapsed. In the instant of adjusting the scope, he glimpsed Ran Yao charging toward the flower boat, shotgun raised, cloak billowing behind him to reveal camouflage fatigues and an '80 steel helmet. Amidst the classical scenery of peach blossoms and green willows, the image was utterly incongruous—years later, he still remembered it.

Ran Yao remembered that Lin Shenhe's second target was the porridge vendor. Amid the firecrackers, gunshots were indistinguishable, but the vendor obviously hadn't been hit. He spread a mouth full of gleaming white teeth, drew three throwing knives from behind his back—their handles wrapped with blood-red strips of cloth. Ran Yao squeezed the trigger almost instinctively. The five-shot shotgun spat a blindingly bright tongue of fire. The knife-thrower crumpled into the water as if punched, red-ribboned knives scattering everywhere.

Screams and cries erupted. The few pedestrians and vendors on the embankment scattered in panic. No one dared run toward the embankment entrance where this death god had appeared—they either jumped into the water or pressed flat on the ground, trembling, burying their heads in the dirt.

Lin Shenhe's second target shifted to the archer on the rear deck. Prior intelligence hadn't identified this threat—they'd assumed he was just an ordinary lookout. In the scope, every movement was magnified 4×. The moment he saw this sentry pick up a bow, he fired twice in quick succession, killing the marksman—he who could hit a willow leaf at a hundred paces—on the deck.

The bouncer saw two black-clad men charging grimly toward his flower boat. Knowing things had gone wrong, he backed into the cabin while shouting something, his iron rod already in hand. Ran Yao was about to shoot when a blood-flower suddenly blossomed on the man's shoulder—a .22 caliber bullet had punched straight through his back. He toppled stiffly into the hold.

They charged into the cabin. Several women knelt on the floor, unable even to speak. Such fierce, strange figures exceeded their imagination. Ran Yao didn't waste time asking questions. Just as he was about to kick open the middle-cabin door, the curtain stirred slightly. He and his teammate fired almost simultaneously. Thick gunpowder smoke filled the cabin. With a scream, a large dark figure tumbled out, drenched in blood, clutching a dagger and a seven-star dart.

"Brother Wang!" One of the prostitutes shrieked.

Though his face was now a bloody mess from shotgun pellets, his build, clothing, and the prostitute's cry confirmed this was the Wang surname ringleader behind the kidnapping. Ran Yao exhaled in relief—the mastermind hadn't escaped! He was about to continue searching when Lin Shenhe's urgent voice came over the walkie-talkie: "Go rescue Director Wen! A small boat near the flower boat is getting away!"

From his position, he could see the small boat moving but was blocked by the flower boat—he couldn't hit the rower.

Fortunately, Beiwei was on the water to intercept. The moment Lin Shenhe spoke, Beiwei spotted the moving boat. He fired twice at the stern, immediately followed by screams.

"Row! Now!"

The two escort guards rowing sat dumbstruck. Only after the sharp command did they snap to and row furiously.

As the two boats drew closer, Beiwei estimated the distance and leaped aboard. But before he could steady himself, a man burst from the cabin, slashing at his face—fast and vicious. In a small rowboat fight, Beiwei was no match for this man. But he had a five-shot shotgun. Reflexively, he squeezed the trigger. The technological gap was lethal—sixteen pellets virtually point-blank turned the man into a honeycomb. So close that blood sprayed onto Beiwei's face.

Without hesitation, Beiwei charged into the cabin. This small boat was where the flower-boat crew slept—tiny space, just room for a bed and a small table. On the bed lay Director Wen.

"Target eliminated!" Beiwei shouted into the walkie-talkie. "Director Wen located." He checked his breathing—steady and normal; he seemed to be in drugged sleep. "He's safe."

"All teams withdraw!" Ran Yao's voice came over the radio. "Check the cabin for any modern items. Take what you can; throw the rest in the water."

"What about you?"

"Searching for stolen items. Leaving once done. Rendezvous at pickup point!"

"Stay safe."

"Understood."

Beiwei directed his teammate and the escort guards to carry Director Wen out while he searched the cabin. Besides some women's cosmetics in a drawer, there was nothing else. He went out on deck, collected the shotgun shell casings, searched the two bloody corpses—grabbing whatever scraps he found and stuffing them into his nylon pouch. Then he hurried back to the rowboat and rowed toward the pickup point.

From the first firecracker to Director Wen being loaded onto the mule cart, the entire operation took just over four minutes. The criminals had been utterly defenseless against this meticulously planned assault. As the cart pulled away, the string of firecrackers was still crackling away—as if celebrating the transmigrators' first victory.
