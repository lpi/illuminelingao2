# Chapter 8: Striking Gold — Australian Sea Merchants

"Damn, that was like riding a roller coaster." Xiao Zishan, still shaken, spoke in a low voice.

"Fortune favors the bold." Wang Luobin kept his hand in his pocket. Xiao Zishan knew he had been gripping the stun gun the entire time.

"What are you muttering about? Stay calm, stay calm." Director Wen's nose was beaded with sweat as well.

The crossing plan, passable in theory, had run into problems from the start. The moment Wen Desi stowed the wormhole exit into his pack, they heard dogs barking furiously, scaring all three so badly their legs turned to jelly. Fortunately, Wang Luobin had been gripping the stun gun the entire time. Hearing a rush of wind behind him, he frantically jabbed the button and swung his arm back—like a blind cat stumbling upon a dead rat, he managed to zap a vicious dog that had been about to pounce and maul them. The beast's fur stood on end, foam spewed from its mouth, and it collapsed on its back, twitching. It must have also shocked the dogs behind it, because the rest merely howled without closing in. Before the three could decide their next move, the courtyard gate burst open and seven or eight servants in dark robes surged in, armed with swords, spears, and cudgels. One even had a matchlock arquebus—its smoldering fuse coiled around his arm, the black maw of the barrel leveled straight at the three dimension-transmigrators whose heads were full of dreams of fortune.

The first people they encountered on their timespace journey were clearly not friendly—not only unfriendly, but their very lives were suddenly in jeopardy. Having a black-muzzled bird-gun aimed at them was a first for these homebodies.

In their online discussions of ancient firearms, they had looked down on Ming-era bird-guns as crudely made, with negligible range and power. But now, with barely twenty paces between them and that dark barrel pointed at their faces, even the shoddiest gun could surely blow their heads wide open. They were so flustered they didn't know what to do; the opening speech Wen Desi had prepared was frightened right back down his throat.

Fortunately, the servants had witnessed what happened to the dogs and hesitated. After a moment's standoff, Wen Desi calculated that although throwing a smoke grenade now would let them escape easily, their timespace-arbitrage career would be over before it started—not to mention their grand ambitions of unifying the world and revitalizing China! At this thought, boldness surged from his gut. He raised both hands, spoke and gestured in Cantonese, and tossed over a mirrored compact to demonstrate he meant no harm.

The compact proved remarkably effective. Before long, the three went from having weapons brandished at them to being treated as honored guests.

"Old Wang, do you think this is a trap? That they're luring us here to capture us?" Xiao Zishan stealthily glanced around. This was genuine Ming-dynasty architecture; the furniture beneath their backsides was genuine Ming-dynasty craftsmanship—any piece of it would fetch a handsome price if brought back to their own timespace. But at the moment, no one was in the mood to appreciate it.

"If they meant to act, they could have done so in the back courtyard..."

"Everyone stay alert. And don't drink the tea." Wen Desi spoke quietly. "Looking at this household's servants, I'd guess the master is a smuggler too. These types are usually ruthless and black-hearted. Be wary of any foul intentions."

"Mm, understood."

"Zishan, if I throw a smoke grenade, you immediately help me get the wormhole out. We bolt at once."

"Got it."

While they were whispering, they saw seven or eight servants ushering in a middle-aged man in fine robes. Having just weathered that frantic scene, Xiao Zishan and the others had only just regained some composure. Now their curiosity swelled—this was a real, live person of the Great Ming! Three pairs of eyes stared fixedly at the pale, well-maintained middle-aged man.

A moment earlier, when Master Gao opened the box, he had been astonished. Having dealt in foreign goods for over twenty years, he was no stranger to rare wonders. Setting aside the compact's unusual material—neither porcelain nor jade—what was embedded inside was a priceless crystal mirror. Over the years, he had seen such things only a handful of times, and though those had been considerably larger, none compared to this one in brilliance and clarity. He had heard from Portuguese merchants that such crystal mirrors came from only one city in the Far West, manufactured in a workshop on an island under strict guard. It was a closely held secret, rarely seen even in Portugal itself, let alone here in Guangzhou.

These three Japanese had considerable means! Master Gao speculated: could they be emissaries of some Japanese lord? Then again, Japan could barely meet its own daily needs—nine-tenths of its goods had to be shipped in by Chinese trading vessels. How could they possess such a treasure?

Since the other party was willing to present such a valuable gift as a gesture of goodwill, he must at least go and meet them. Master Gao could already smell silver. But as a precaution, he still brought along the most capable of his household guards.

The moment he came face to face with them, Master Gao froze again. These weren't Japanese!

Guangzhou was a melting pot; he had seen plenty of Japanese. Though these three had short hair rather than the typical Japanese topknot, they didn't look Japanese at all. One had his head shaved almost bare, like a mendicant monk; the other two wore it slightly longer. Their clothes were peculiar—front-buttoning jackets, short trousers that didn't reach the knee... Japanese didn't dress this way. Neither did the Portuguese.

Moreover, these three were tall—nothing like the short stature of the Japanese. Each stood over five *chi* and five *cun*; one was nearly six *chi*.

Their appearance: fair-skinned, with hands and feet neither coarse nor large—clearly people accustomed to a life of ease. Their expressions, though somewhat anxious, showed no trace of servility or inferiority; in their every movement there was a certain confidence.

Master Gao had navigated the merchant world for many years and considered himself a shrewd judge of character. Yet looking at these three, he could not place them at all.

As he pondered, he noticed the three staring at him intently, their gazes extremely strange. A chill ran down his spine; he involuntarily took a step back, wondering: could they be devotees of the Way of the Dragon Yang? Why were they eyeing him, a man, so disturbingly?

Xiao Zishan and the others, for their part, noticed the middle-aged man's expression shifting uncertainly and felt uneasy themselves. He appeared to be in his fifties, wearing a square-topped cap and a silk round-collared robe. His features were regular; he sported a thin wisp of beard; his fair face was slightly plump—a striking contrast to the dark, scrawny servants beside him.

Master Gao cupped his hands toward Wen Desi and asked: "How may I address the heroes?"

Because Wen Desi's jacket had a longer hem and its material resembled silk, he was mistaken for the leader compared to his companions' coarse cotton.

The moment he heard the question, Wen Desi recognized it—this wasn't Cantonese; it sounded more like modern Nanjing dialect. So he replied in Mandarin: "We have come from overseas. Losing our way in the night, we stumbled into your esteemed residence. May I ask what place this is?"

Though Master Gao did not fully understand, his instincts told him these people bore him no ill will. A veteran of the merchant world, he asked slowly: "Where do the heroes hail from?"

Since verbal communication was possible, the two sides exchanged names through a mix of speech and writing. Then Wen Desi unveiled the cover story they had prepared.

"Our ancestors were all Chinese. After the fall of Yaishan, they fled overseas. They once built a considerable enterprise in Borneo, but the local ruler grew wary of our growing power and repeatedly refused to tolerate us. So they took to the seas again, sailing south, until they reached Australia ten thousand *li* away. That was two hundred and more years ago."

Master Gao pondered a moment, then said: "So you are not Japanese after all?"

"We are descendants of Huaxia—how could we be Japanese?!" Wang Luobin cut in, displeased.

Master Gao raised an eyebrow. These overseas folk certainly didn't know their manners—a subordinate speaking out of turn like that.

"We are not Japanese," Wen Desi said. Seeing that the Ming-era gentleman raised no objection to this story, he grew bolder. He explained that Australia had been a wilderness with only a small native population; their ancestors had carved out a paradise there through sheer toil and now lived in peace and prosperity. But generation after generation, their forebears had longed for the homeland, so they had dispatched a few of their number, carrying trade goods, to work their way here and have a look.

In truth, this story was full of holes: How had they entered the city? Where was their ship anchored? None of it was explained. But as Wen Desi had predicted: sometimes all you need is a story, and the will to stick with it.

Master Gao nodded repeatedly. He knew of Borneo—several foreign-trade ships went there every year—and had never heard anything of the sort. But he couldn't be bothered to probe further; after all, this was ancient history from centuries ago, and who could sort it out? Besides, he had no interest in Borneo or Australia.

"...Having lost our way, we intruded upon your residence and disturbed your household. Pray forgive us." Wen Desi cupped his hands in imitation. "We come from overseas. May I ask what place this is?"

"Certainly, certainly," Master Gao replied. These people carried precious objects and had somehow entered the city by night—they were no ordinary folk. He would take their story at face value for now. "This is Nanhai County, Guangzhou Prefecture, of the Great Ming."

Wen Desi pressed further: "And what is today's date?"

Master Gao blinked. "The seventh year of Tianqi, second month."
