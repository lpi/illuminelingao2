# Chapter 32: Response

"Sleep is the state closest to death"—Director Wen woke from his dream with this phrase inexplicably springing to mind. He opened his eyes. A pale-red canopy with watergrass patterns swayed and rippled above him; a faint fragrance wafted to his nostrils. He closed his eyes to enjoy it—then suddenly snapped them open again. *Where am I?!*

If Director Wen hadn't already experienced the wormhole, he would have been ninety percent certain he had soul-transmigrated. His brain cleared slightly: wasn't he staying in the mansion Gao Ju had given them? That bed had a canopy, but just an ordinary blue cotton curtain. Nothing this feminine. Where exactly was this?

He hurried to sit up, but his head felt heavy and his limbs ached, utterly devoid of strength. He looked around: a tiny room, no windows on any side. Besides the large bed beneath him, there was only a small table and a chair. On the table sat a vase with potted plants; two landscape paintings hung on the wall.

He quickly moved to dress and discovered his stab-resistant vest, belt, and waterproof boots were gone. His ever-present folding knife, stun gun, and pepper spray had all vanished. This alarmed him considerably. As a longtime practicing "survivalist," these items were practically Wen Desi's protective talismans. Now, in an unknown situation, with all his defenses stripped away...

While he was alarmed, the door creaked. In came a lean man of medium build, his complexion revealing a vicious streak. Director Wen was no fool—one glance told him the visitor was no good person. With his own situation unclear, he decided to say nothing.

"How are you, Shopkeeper Wen?" The visitor made a casual salute with his fists, deliberately revealing the handle of the short sword at his waist. Wen Desi detected a slight Hokkien accent in his speech.

"May I ask who you are?"

The man chuckled coldly and sprawled in the chair. "We all make our living on the sea. We've heard that Shopkeeper Wen came from Australia and made a fortune selling rare goods. We'd like to know where your ship is moored and what your sailing route is—so we brothers can look out for each other on the water."

Wen Desi didn't answer, only asking: "Where is this place?"

The man laughed. "This is merely a temporary lodging for Shopkeeper Wen. No need to know. We're very curious about Australian affairs—we hope the shopkeeper won't be stingy with information." His expression turned threatening.

Director Wen thought: *You skinny little runt—you think I'm scared of you?* Under normal circumstances, he would have already given the man a thorough beating. But his hands and feet were weak and aching—he could barely move. Better not to take reckless risks. He could only respond:

"Certainly. What would you like to know?"

"What ship did you take to come to the Great Ming? Where is it moored now?"

Wen Desi dreaded this question most—there was simply no way to explain. Lies were also hard to construct—the slightest investigation would expose them. Since no "Australian ship" existed, the only option was to shift blame onto an existing vessel.

"Australian-built ships aren't suited for distant voyages, so we only went as far as Borneo. From there we transferred to a Portuguese ship." This was half-true—the man couldn't easily refute it. He then asked how they had entered Guangzhou.

Wen Desi's mind raced through many thoughts. Since this group had kidnapped him, they obviously weren't aligned with Gao Ju—possibly even enemies. Now his only option was to tie every verifiable fact to Gao Ju; that way they couldn't cross-check, and his lies wouldn't be exposed. He recalled everything Xiao Zishan had told him about the Haopan Street smuggling merchants. With his story prepared, he said:

"In Australia, we'd heard from overseas foreign merchants that Guangzhou in the Great Ming was richer than whole nations, but outsiders weren't allowed into the city to trade. By chance, we learned from a Portuguese sailor that there's a place called Youyu Islet at the Pearl River estuary—a good spot for foreign merchants to conduct smuggling. We disembarked there and paid someone to bring us into Guangzhou. That person delivered us to Master Gao Ju's mansion."

"Oh? What was this person's name?"

"We were newcomers and didn't dare ask too many questions. I think his surname was Wang."

"Wang Boss" of Youyu Islet—this was just a passing whisper he'd once caught from the Gao household servants.

"Strange—Wang Boss says he doesn't know any Australian merchants!" Suddenly, a clear, flirtatious female voice came from outside the door.

As the words fell, a young woman stepped out from behind the door. She wore a lotus-root-colored, close-fitting cross-collared jacket and a pale blue pleated long skirt. Tall and slender, arched brows, red lips, skin luminous as jade. Her large, bright eyes swept about as she spoke, naturally coquettish. But looking more closely, there was a subtle hint of menace in her gaze.

Boss Wang seemed quite wary of this girl; he hurriedly stood and offered his seat with a fawning smile. The girl didn't stand on ceremony; she sat down gracefully. A pair of lovely eyes, as if able to peer into one's soul, roamed over Director Wen. Wen Desi's heart pounded; he wondered: *What's this girl's game? Where in the seventeenth-century Ming did such a person come from?*

"And you are?" Wen Desi, unsettled by her words, knew that speaking up to defend himself would easily reveal flaws. Better to stall.

"Hey now—none of your concern..."

"Oh, Boss Wang, don't say that. I'm not some villain. I'm someone with a reputation on the seas. Why be so secretive? I'm Li Siya—" She stood up, lifted her skirt hems with both hands, placed her right foot back, and gave a graceful curtsy. Director Wen's brain buzzed. *Could this girl also be a transmigrator? Were there others in this world besides them?!*

Forcing himself to stay calm, he stood and gave a slight bow. "I am Wen Desi."

Now it was Li Siya's turn to be slightly startled. "Australia also practices Western etiquette?"

Wen Desi noticed the girl's hair and pupils had a slight brown tint; her long hair was slightly curly. He guessed she probably had Portuguese blood—such local-born mixed-race individuals were common in Macau, with some even having two Portuguese parents. The curtsy was simply Western manners. Reassured, he smiled:

"In Australia, we normally practice Western etiquette."

"Yet you still call yourselves children of Huaxia? Isn't that a collapse of ritual and music?" the girl teased.

"Our hearts turn toward Huaxia; thus we are children of Huaxia—it has nothing to do with ritual and music."

"Quite imposing." Li Siya sat in the chair, casually playing with a small knife—which Wen Desi recognized as his own ever-present folding knife. "But Shopkeeper Wen, you haven't answered my question. Wang Boss really doesn't know you!" She gazed at Director Wen lazily, her sweet voice saying: "For the rest of your life, you *do* intend to exist in male form, yes?"

Wen Desi broke into a cold sweat, knowing this girl, however coquettish her speech, was probably utterly ruthless. With such a person, showing weakness wouldn't work—but neither would outright defiance. He thought: *I only said his surname seemed to be Wang; I never said which Wang.* Besides, Xiao Zishan had told him that groups like the fishing-smuggling gangs on Youyu Islet were extremely exclusive—outsiders couldn't possibly get information. He sneered inwardly: *You're just casting a "golden bell" bluff.*

"I don't know any Wang Boss. I only heard his surname seemed to be Wang." To soften his tone, he smiled. "We come from overseas—we only know how to sell goods and make money. We don't go around asking about other people's affairs."

"You lot really do have black eyes that only see silver."

"Forgive us—pursuing profit is a merchant's nature."

"Why do I feel that Shopkeeper Wen and all your people are rather extraordinary?" Li Siya leaned slightly closer; a faint rose-water scent reached his nostrils. "Pursuing profit? Who in this world isn't a fly chasing profit? Even emperors merely pursue the interests of their own family name." Her eyes flickered. "Am I right, Shopkeeper Wen?"

"Yes, yes. Miss Li instructs wisely." Wen Desi began suspecting again whether she was a transmigrator. If she really was, hopefully not a fujoshi... While he was lost in thought, he saw Miss Li sit up primly and lay out a pile of objects on the table—all random items, even Xiao Zishan's socks and Engineer Wang's ballpoint pen. Their common feature: nothing from this timespace.

"Are all of these made in Australia?"

"They are made in Australia."

Then this graceful young beauty actually picked up Xiao Zishan's nylon socks—clearly knowing what they were—using a bamboo skewer.

"This sock—how is it made? How is this thread spun? Why is it so transparent yet stretchy?"

"These are knitted socks, made with a knitting machine." Wen Desi was very familiar with early-modern machinery: the first hand-cranked knitting frame was invented in England in 1598, producing only 16 loops at a time—still quite primitive. Only thirty years had passed since then; probably even the Portuguese didn't know about it.

"Made with a machine?" The girl gazed thoughtfully at Xiao Zishan's socks.

"Yes."

"And this thread? Raw silk can't produce such elasticity."

Wen Desi thought this was hard to explain. Knitting machines he could at least describe sensibly. Tell her this thread was refined from petroleum? Then his *nether regions* would probably immediately cease to exist in male form.

"This material is called nylon. It's not silkworm silk. How it's produced is a secret in our country—we merchants have no idea."

Li Siya nodded, but disappointment showed in her eyes. Wen Desi's heart stirred—surely these long, slender legs would be wasted without a pair of stockings. Next time they should definitely bring plenty of nylon stockings...

"It seems Australian writing is also Western-style. This pen doesn't need to be dipped in ink—quite convenient." Li Siya sighed, fiddling with the ballpoint pen, reluctant to put it down. "Your goods truly make me feel like a frog in a well. I never imagined there was such a place in the world, capable of making such ingenious things."

"You flatter us."

"Now that you've opened this sea route, you'll be trading regularly from now on?"

"Well..." Wen Desi wasn't sure how to answer.

"Hmph. It doesn't matter." The girl gave a cold smile, seeming to speak to herself. "The waters off Guangdong will fall into the Grand Chief's hands any day now. If you want to keep your ships and cargo safe for the long term, wisdom would serve you well!" With that, she rose and left on her own.
