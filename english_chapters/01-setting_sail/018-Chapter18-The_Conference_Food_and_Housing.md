# Chapter 18: The Conference — Food and Housing

Once they crossed into another timespace, the transmigrators would face three fundamental categories of problems:

1. Basic necessities: food and clothing.
2. Protection from violence—whether human or animal.
3. Protection from nature: weather and disease.

Compared with overly technical industrial matters, most people cared far more about these personal concerns.

Modern society is highly developed, marked by extreme division and specialization of labor. Every convenience of daily life—even the simplest—requires an entire industrial chain to maintain. A single drop of tap water, before it flows from the faucet, is supported by electricity, chemicals, steel manufacturing, cement, construction, and countless other industries.

In seventeenth-century Hainan, none of this existed.

Rice existed only as unhusked grain. Water, after simple sedimentation, could only be sterilized by boiling. Clothing had no concept of ready-made garments—the wealthy could hire tailors, while ordinary people relied on their wives to cut and sew.

Every daily necessity, even the things taken most for granted, either did not exist in that timespace or existed only in primitive forms.

As the Internal Affairs Team Leader responsible for livelihood matters, Xiao Zishan's proposed equipment list sparked immediate debate.

"Rice hullers, flour mills, grain-processing equipment—is all this necessary? Consider the spare-parts issue, plus power consumption... Even ancient times had water-powered rice-hulling workshops. As for grinding flour, Chinese peasants were still milling their own wheat well into the 1950s."

"Even if we adopt mechanized production, Machinery could build them. Bringing equipment from this timespace feels like a waste of transport capacity."

"And sewing machines, sergers, cutting tools... Team Leader Xiao, are you planning to open a garment factory?"

"Agriculture strongly supports grain-processing equipment! If Internal Affairs hadn't requested it, we would have!" Wu Nanhai sided with him. "It's about processing speed! Traditional methods are extremely inefficient. Feeding several hundred people through manual operations consumes too much labor."

"You could use water-powered mills—China had them, Europe had them..."

"That means building a dedicated mill. The labor and materials consumed don't count? With electricity, we can drive this equipment directly and quickly process enough grain."

"Machinery can handle spare parts," Xiao Zishan had anticipated this. "In rural areas, dry grain is typically stored. Using planned-economy-era standards: 12 *jin* of rice per adult per month. With 500 people, we need at least 6 tons monthly.

"That 12-*jin* ration is for ordinary citizens and office workers—heavy laborers receive more. After crossing, with so much physical labor, we should calculate at 14 *jin*. If we bring in local labor, supply needs increase further.

"Machine-processed grain is high quality, free of impurities. Stone mills demand high-quality stone; poor stone produces flour full of grit—bad for everyone's teeth.

"As for sewing machines—same reasoning. Clothes wear out and need replacing. Who do you expect to make new clothes? Your girlfriends?" Laughter rippled through the room.

"Perhaps you can find a local woman to marry. She won't know how to make our style of clothes. Teaching her isn't difficult, but a purely hand-sewn garment takes days, even for an expert.

"Perhaps you can wait those few days. But in the future, we'll be recruiting workers, and even—" he lowered his voice—"an army." He raised it again: "Will their uniforms also be sewn stitch by stitch by your wives?" More laughter.

"By that logic, ancient armies went naked? Hundreds of thousands of soldiers received new uniforms every year, didn't they?"

"That was based on vast quantities of cheap—even free—labor. We don't have that luxury." Xiao Zishan made a pained expression. "Our lives are finite. Productive capacity must be directed toward climbing the tech tree. Better to bring necessary machinery directly. It can also serve as an engineering sample for future replication."

Housing was another issue of great concern. Internal Affairs had originally planned to purchase large quantities of tents and establish a tent camp before constructing permanent structures. The Construction Group proposed purchasing prefab houses for direct assembly—common on construction sites as dormitories and offices. Panel materials came in many varieties, were lightweight, easy to erect, reasonably insulated, and more comfortable than tents. Durability was also respectable: with proper maintenance, seven to eight years presented no problem.

"Our company has one department that's been using the simplest corrugated-steel prefab as warehouse and office space for almost ten years now—still in good shape." The speaker was Auntie Cao's daughter, Li Xiaolü—a petite Northern woman around thirty, fair-skinned, wearing thin-rimmed glasses. "Prefabs can also be multi-story, but that requires light steel framing.

"Because of the harsh environment we'll face," her voice was soft, "we should use higher-grade materials, such as magnesium-phosphate prefabs.

"These use polystyrene foam core magnesium composite panels for walls and roofs, steel doors and windows, and light steel framing. No special machinery is needed for installation—with simple tools, four skilled workers can assemble a standard unit of about 60 square meters in four hours.

"Their modular flexibility exceeds corrugated steel. Units can be added or removed as needed, with doors, windows, and wall panels freely interchangeable. With reinforced structure, they can also be multi-story.

"These houses have excellent sealing and insulation, and are entirely fireproof. They're moisture-resistant, corrosion-resistant, earthquake-resistant, and light—a standard unit weighs only 2,200 kilograms. Expected lifespan exceeds ten years.

"Dormitories, offices, and small warehouses can all use this type."

"What about factory buildings?" Industry was quite interested.

"Large-span factory buildings won't work with these. But you could use cement-panel prefabs." Li Xiaolü continued. "Basically, angle-steel frames with cement-panel construction. Much heavier than standard prefabs—but the advantage is a lifespan of twenty years or more. They can handle large spans and can be built as two- or three-story structures."

"Cement panels..." someone said hesitantly.

"Construction believes our industrial system can produce both cement and angle steel without difficulty. If factory buildings aren't urgently needed, we could bring only blueprints plus necessary molds, jigs, and materials, then build on-site using local resources." Her face was pale. "However, assembling prefabs is skilled work. I recommend sending people to prefab companies for hands-on training."

Wen Desi nodded and made a note: "Practical skills training."

"Can we install plumbing and electricity in these houses?"

"Yes—though we can't run conduits inside walls, surface-mounting is fine. However, Construction's view is that dormitories and office buildings should not have individual water supply and drainage, to save materials.

"For water needs, we think it's best to have separate public washroom facilities with three sections: shower room, washbasin area, and toilets. This allows centralized plumbing. Given Hainan's heavy rainfall, we'll install enclosed corridors connecting dormitories to the washrooms. Winter temperatures aren't low, so the design doesn't include heating for showers."

"What about cooling? Summers in Hainan are scorching. We need air conditioning."

Though this drew eye-rolls, quite a few privately hoped for air conditioning. They were accustomed to it—in Ming-era Hainan, there wouldn't even be electric fans.

"Traditional AC is definitely out of the question." Li Xiaolü glanced at Xiao Zishan; seeing no objection, she continued. "Traditional AC requires enormous electricity and chemical refrigerants. Far too luxurious. If the Executive Committee decides to implement cooling, we have two options." She seemed slightly dizzy, suppressing nausea as she steadied herself against the table:

"First: evaporative-pad cooling—essentially evaporative ventilation fans, eliminating the indoor unit and compressor, using water as the refrigerant. Very energy-efficient. The downsides are high humidity, and the fans are difficult to manufacture.

"Second: groundwater-cooled AC. Similar in principle to radiator heating, except we pump groundwater instead of steam. High initial investment—deep wells and copper tubing for evaporators—but much better performance."

"Personally, I prefer the second option. It works far better, and the system is simpler."

"Isn't that type prohibited by the government? They say it wastes water."

"There's no such regulation in another dimension."

"I understand that. But wasting water is still the same—not environmentally friendly."

"You're worried about environmentalism back then?"

"You can reinject the groundwater, so there's no waste," she explained. "For something more advanced, there's geothermal AC. Similar method. About ten meters underground, temperatures remain constant around 20°C. Drill down and circulate water as a heat-exchange medium—warm in winter, cool in summer. In winter, extract heat from the ground; in summer, release heat into it. Our camp would need geologically stable ground. If too geologically active, it can only provide heating."

The attendees looked at Xiao Zishan—he was in charge of internal affairs. Xiao Zishan looked at Chairman Wen Desi. He favored anything that improved living conditions. *It's easy to go from frugality to luxury, hard to go from luxury to frugality*—a group of pampered city dwellers, starting over in a wilderness, would suffer low morale if conditions were too harsh.

But he didn't dare state his position. These livelihood systems would require substantial industrial resources, and he simply didn't have the courage to commit.

Wen Desi exchanged glances with him, then surveyed all the group leaders. Finally, he delivered the classic line:

"We'll need to study this issue further."
