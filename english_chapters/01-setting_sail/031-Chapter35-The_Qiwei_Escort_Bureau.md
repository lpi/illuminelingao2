# Chapter 35: The Qiwei Escort Bureau

"Help rescue a hostage?" The elderly manager of the Qiwei Escort Bureau, Sun Kecheng, rolled his eyes and fixed them on Sun Chang, who had come to summon him.

This Sun Chang fellow—by martial lineage his disciple-nephew and also a distant relative—but his too-blunt personality made him unpopular. After drifting to Guangzhou, he had simply become someone's slave. Sun Kecheng often felt regret about this: what a waste of his martial skills.

He had considered finding Sun Chang a place at the escort bureau, but the market for escort services had been poor these past years, and business was far worse than before. An escort bureau wasn't like other trades where adding a person just meant another pair of chopsticks. In the escort business, each position served a purpose: when you had work, you had people; more work meant hiring more, which meant more expenses with little profit margin. When business was slow, you didn't lay off—everyone tightened their belts together. With business down, naturally they couldn't add staff.

"Yes, my masters request that you come to discuss the matter."

Sun Kecheng was somewhat confused. He recalled that Sun Chang served at the mansion of the great Haopan Street merchant Gao Ju. This Master Gao was a well-connected figure in Guangzhou—why, when robbed, would he seek them out instead of official channels?

As for hostage rescue, escort bureaus weren't particularly interested. Relations between escort services and bandits were based on harmony—using secret argot, "making friends"—not all-out, life-or-death battles. To rescue a hostage was like snatching meat from a wolf's jaws. Anyone bold enough to kidnap someone in the provincial capital was no petty thief—it meant a vicious fight to the death. Win or lose, once their identity was exposed through involvement, they'd have made enemies with the bandits for good.

But the current situation was difficult. Since the first year of Tianqi, disorder had grown everywhere, escort routes had become increasingly perilous, and income kept dropping. The bureau had a hundred mouths to feed, top to bottom...

After much deliberation, he finally agreed to take the job. First, this business could relieve half the bureau's financial strain. Second, according to his disciple-nephew, these new masters were Australian sea merchants—this piqued Sun Kecheng's interest. Australian goods had gained sudden fame recently. These merchants were not only wealthy but treated people generously; they had even permitted Sun Chang to restore his original surname. They were benevolent gentlemen. For reasons of both sentiment and profit, he should help.

Xiao Zishan and Ran Yao viewed the Qiwei Escort Bureau manager that Sun Chang had strongly recommended with some skepticism. They had expected a burly giant with a bearded face—the type from martial-arts films. Instead, what arrived was a middle-aged man wearing a plain silk cap and a cross-collared jacket, just like ordinary folk on the street. Though his steps were still steady, he didn't look like a martial-arts hero.

But they urgently needed someone to gather information. Gao Di had already volunteered to go out, but no one dared pin all hopes on a few children. They recounted the whole affair, including the investigation results.

After hearing Xiao Zishan's briefing and investigative conclusions, Sun Kecheng nodded:

"The masters have an expert here."

"We're strangers to this place and don't understand the city's ways. We must trouble Manager Sun for assistance."

"Of course, of course." Sun Kecheng smiled and nodded. "Sun Chang is favored by you. For that alone, the Qiwei Escort Bureau must give its full support."

"What is Manager Sun's assessment?"

"Didn't that Master Ran just say there was one barefoot person? In this Guangzhou city, even villagers coming into town at least wear wooden clogs or straw sandals. The only people who go barefoot year-round are one kind: the *Danjia* boat people."

"*Danjia*?" Xiao Zishan seemed to have heard this term—apparently a type of ancient lowborn caste.

"Exactly. The masters don't know about the *Danjia*?" Sun Kecheng explained that the so-called *Danjia*, also called "egg households," were water-dwelling residents distributed along the coastal bays and inland rivers of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces. "Their descendants take boats as homes and fishing as livelihood. They identify hidden currents by reading water colors; in ancient times they were called 'dragon households.' Common folk call them '*Danjia*.'"

"They're fishermen?"

"Though the *Danjia* make their living on the water, some are fishermen. But not all fishermen are *Danjia*." He explained that the *Danjia* engaged in all kinds of water-based trades; their boats could be found at almost every inlet and fork of the Pearl River.

If there was a *Danjia* person among the kidnappers, things became much clearer. Director Wen was very likely being held on some boat on the water. This was the South City—climb over the city wall and you were at the Pearl River. Once the criminals boarded a boat, they had the whole sea to escape to. Moreover, the *Danjia* were an extremely closed community with dialects and customs distinct from land-dwellers. Without someone familiar with their inner circles, gathering information would be very difficult.

Hearing this, everyone's hearts sank. This was bad.

"There are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of boats on the water. Even an inspection would take a month or more." Ran Yao grew frustrated—forgetting that in this timespace he had no authority to conduct any inspection.

"The masters needn't despair. It's not that difficult. Though the *Danjia* and land-dwellers have no dealings and are mutually hostile, they wouldn't be behind a kidnapping. It must be outside criminals in league with pleasure-boat prostitutes. These prostitutes often engage in illicit activities—that knockout incense isn't something common in the *jianghu* underworld; it's more like what water-based prostitutes use to rob men of their money."

He smiled confidently. "Master Wen should be on one of those flower boats."

"Where do these flower boats moor?"

"The *Danjia* flower boats are mostly around Shicui Islet at White Goose Pool. I'll send out escort guards when I return. There are a few things I must make clear to you all—heed them carefully.

"First: avoid reporting to officials. Though Master Gao's influence could dispatch all the constables of the prefecture and two counties with a single card, those men are rogues themselves. A fat sheep at their door won't move them without being stuffed with silver. They might even collude with the criminals.

"Second: don't seize whoever delivers the ransom letter. Such people are either street beggars hired temporarily or common thugs—they won't know the criminals. Grabbing them is useless and will alert the other side. After dark, the city gates close. We don't know the terrain out here—fighting them on their ground, we might not have the upper hand. Night blindness in the Ming era may not be as common as imagined.

"Finally: don't act rashly. They certainly have lookouts around your residence. But these lookouts are also hired helpers who can't tell you much."

After seeing Manager Sun off, everyone discussed that simply waiting for news wasn't the answer. Fortunately, if the other side wanted ransom, there would have to be letters exchanged—this was a thread leading to the kidnappers. Though tailing people in Ming-era Guangzhou was impossible, modern surveillance technology could certainly work. They immediately installed cameras throughout the compound and set up a monitoring station in the courtyard, powered by banks of batteries—24-hour continuous surveillance of the surroundings. Lin Shenhe walked a circuit and installed several wireless cameras on the front courtyard roof to watch the street. He himself put on a camouflage jacket, took binoculars, night-vision goggles, walkie-talkie, and rifle, and climbed the compound's only large tree. Among the dense branches, he set up a platform and took turns with Beiwei standing watch, ready to respond at any moment.

Ran Yao changed into servant's clothes, clipped a DV camera to his waist, and walked up and down Haopan Street several times, guided by Sun Chang.

"Found the surveillance!" He came back and tossed the DV on the table.

Everyone perked up and crowded around.

"There are four people watching." Ran Yao played the DV for them. "Look here"—he pointed at a peddler on the screen—"absent-minded, eyes constantly glancing at Master Gao's front gate.

"This one—dressed as a beggar, but instead of begging on the busy street, he's hiding in the dead-end alley by the Gao mansion's side gate.

"This one is watching our front entrance.

"And this one—sitting alone drinking tea in the teahouse—probably the leader. They may have one or two more as runners to report. Let's print out photos of these people first—one copy for everyone."

"Good!"

"Should we grab them?"

"These people are probably just outer-ring members—they may not know the details."

"If only we could tail them. The leader should be meeting with the main conspirators."

"Possible. Too bad we can't follow them."

"What about planting a wireless beacon on him?"

"Better to just put the beacon in the ransom. That way we can go straight to their lair."

"Theoretically possible. But here we have no map, no GPS—we can't do precise positioning from the signal. We can only use radio direction-finding for rough positioning, and the terrain is too complex."

"The key problem is no map."

"The Ming should have maps, right? Have someone go buy a few."

"Sun Chang already bought one, but this map... is really useless." Ming-era cartography was still quite primitive; modern mapping techniques were roughly introduced to China by Matteo Ricci around this time.

"Still, it's an option. Who knows radio direction-finding?"

"I can do it." Beiwei said.

"Then it'll be up to you when the time comes."

"Best if we can find out the location and just go rescue him directly."

"Shouldn't be a problem. From Manager Sun's tone, he'll have the whereabouts in a few days."

"I wonder how Director Wen is doing right now."

Manager Sun returned to the escort bureau, drank several pots of strong tea, and thought for a while. He had thumped his chest at the Australian merchants' place; inwardly, he was already seven or eight parts confident. That water-based prostitutes were involved was certain—even if the Australian constable Ran hadn't mentioned the barefoot footprints, the scent he'd detected in the room told him as much. But how to investigate was tricky—escort bureau rules forbade setting foot in brothels and flower boats. He wasn't familiar with the people inside.

Fortunately, flower boats still depended on land-based vendors for food and supplies. From those small merchants who specialized in serving the flower boats, they could surely learn something. If nothing else, an extra person aboard meant considerably more provisions.

He called over several escort guards and split them into two groups: one would disguise as traveling merchants and make discreet inquiries; the other would question familiar vendors. Having given these instructions, he added:

"Pay attention to whether any boat has recently taken on a charter customer, or which boat has suddenly stopped receiving clients."

Flower boats were small; it was impossible to hide a hostage while still entertaining guests.

Once they located where the hostage was hidden, rescue would be straightforward. Manager Sun had done hostage rescues for several old clients before. He knew kidnappers rarely stayed with the hostages; those guarding the captive were usually small fry. This was both to avoid showing their faces to the victim and to ensure that if the hiding place was discovered by authorities, they themselves wouldn't go down with it.

But as that Constable Ran had said: the escort bureau's main job was to gather intelligence. How to act in the end was their decision.
