# Chapter 36: The Prophet

After exchanging pleasantries, Xiao Zishan took his leave and returned to the base, where Manager Sun of the Qiwei Escort Bureau had been waiting for some time. Before Xiao Zishan could even bow in thanks, the manager was already offering congratulations. Xiao Zishan presented him with one hundred taels of silver as a token of gratitude.

"The shopkeepers truly excel in both civil and martial arts!" Manager Sun's face bloomed into a smile as he accepted the silver. "Such skill! Such fearsome weapons! My disciples and nephews all say they've witnessed hostage rescues before, but never one so clean and swift."

"Without the help of Qiwei's experts, we strangers would still be fumbling in the dark."

"Please—Qiwei only played its modest part." Manager Sun passed the silver to a junior disciple behind him. "I have a matter to discuss, if Shopkeeper Xiao would be willing to hear it."

"Please, speak freely."

"Though the rescue went smoothly, those criminals have been here before and know the layout. You must guard against retaliation. As the saying goes: a thief may strike once, but no man can guard against thieves for a thousand days. With so many valuables here, caution is essential."

Xiao Zishan couldn't quite discern his intentions. Having just been deceived by that fox Gao Ju, Manager Sun's smile now seemed equally vulpine. He remained warily silent.

When no response came, Manager Sun had to speak plainly: the Qiwei Escort Bureau was willing to provide night-watch services for the residence—essentially serving as overnight security. Besides guarding storefronts, this was an escort bureau's primary urban business. Night-watching differed from household guards in that the bureau concerned itself only with nighttime affairs. Only after the evening watch, when every room in the residence was latched and lit, would the guards enter to patrol.

"If the shopkeepers find that arrangement inconvenient, you might consider purchasing a few servants. We could train some capable hands for personal protection."

So he was selling security services. Xiao Zishan considered it—night security probably wasn't a good idea, given how many secrets this residence held. Escort guards were shrewd and capable; over time, they would inevitably notice things. Training guards, however, might prove useful—though he couldn't make that decision alone.

Still, the Qiwei Escort Bureau connection was something the Executive Committee had resolved to fully exploit. Currently, Gao Ju was their only agent, and their social reach remained far too narrow. Escort bureaus, by contrast, interacted with all levels of society—from high officials to bandits and thugs. They knew everyone and could deal with everyone. This would prove invaluable for the transmigrators' future operations.

Compared to other professions and social classes, escort-bureau personnel embodied the most traditional virtues—valuing trust and righteousness above all. Once won over, they would make reliable allies.

But winning them over required showing favor, and escort guards weren't ordinary people. Though they "spouted slang" and "made friends" with bandits as part of their livelihood, that was merely business. In reality, they were extremely careful about whom they befriended. Attempting to purchase goodwill through lavish spending would backfire spectacularly; one might even be labeled a "mark" and looked down upon.

Fortunately, China had always been a society built on personal relationships and clan ties. The bonds of kinship, clan, and master-disciple relationships ran deepest. Working through these channels would prove far easier.

Following the approach the Executive Committee had discussed, Xiao Zishan said: "Sun Chang contributed greatly to this affair. We've decided to free him from bondage."

"This is tremendous grace." Manager Sun rose and bowed deeply. For slaves, freedom wasn't necessarily a blessing—especially when, after being freed, there was nowhere to go and the master refused to keep them on. That could prove a death sentence. But regardless of the circumstances, Sun Chang was both his clan nephew and martial nephew; the young man's servile status had always reflected poorly on this senior uncle.

"He earned this grace himself." Xiao Zishan deliberately glanced at Gao Xian, who was serving tea nearby. "A servant who doesn't shrink from trouble when the master is in danger, who steps forward and contributes—naturally shouldn't be mistreated." He paused. "Though Sun Chang will be freed from servitude, he's loyal and capable. If he's willing, we'd be happy to keep him on staff."

"You're too kind to this boy." Manager Sun looked genuinely moved. Even if the bureau's business improved enough to add Sun Chang as a guard, the young man would spend his whole life running escort routes. Staying with the Australian shopkeepers held far better prospects than being an escort guard.

"When he's out running errands, please look after him as an elder."

"Naturally." Manager Sun thumped his chest. "Whatever the shopkeepers entrust becomes Qiwei's business. We'll do our utmost."

Good—things were starting to click. Family matters were indeed handled more wholeheartedly.

Xiao Zishan gestured for Gao Xian to withdraw, then continued: "There's also Gao Di. You've met him—a young servant here. We've assigned him to gather market news. He's extremely clever and quick-witted. But I worry he's too young; spending too much time in the streets might lead him astray. And without martial skills, he could get hurt. Please have Qiwei train and discipline him. Though an escort bureau deals with all sorts of people, your men are notably upright. Entrusting him to you puts our minds at ease."

"The shopkeeper flatters us." Manager Sun brightened visibly—the Australian shopkeepers truly respected them.

Seeing the moment was right, Xiao Zishan said no more. Both sides exchanged a few pleasantries and parted.

That evening, Xiao Zishan crossed back to report the situation to the Executive Committee. Whether to grant Gao Ju credit sparked considerable debate—both sides presented compelling arguments, and neither could sway the other.

It was Yu Eshui's comment that offered a fresh approach.

"What month is it over there now?"

"The thirtieth of the fourth month."

"The thirtieth of the fourth month in the seventh year of Tianqi." Yu Eshui nodded thoughtfully. "In eighteen days, Emperor Xizong will go pleasure-boating at the West Garden after sacrificing at the Fangze Altar. Wind will capsize the boat, and he'll fall into the water. Though Tan Jing will rescue him, his health will decline from that day forward."

"He doesn't die until the eighth month. Are you suggesting Gao Ju delay the shrine project until August? Even if you play prophet, you can't possibly make him bold enough to wait for the emperor to die." The quicker minds already grasped his thinking.

"Heh, you underestimate bureaucrats' sensitivity to political winds." Yu Eshui smiled. "Why did Wei Zhongxian become the 'Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Years'? Because of the emperor's favor. His entire fortune depends on Emperor Xizong living or dying. Tianqi was never healthy, and after this incident, he never recovers. Once the emperor dies, Prince Xin will inevitably succeed. Wei Zhongxian, even if not toppled outright, couldn't possibly wield power the way he did during the Tianqi reign. Under such circumstances, bureaucrats won't rush to declare allegiance when the political winds remain unclear.

"This Eunuch Yang isn't part of Wei Zhongxian's faction—he simply wants to curry favor while he still can. If the situation suddenly becomes uncertain, he'll be the first to postpone construction. By not building the shrine, he maintains the status quo. If he builds it and the emperor dies with a new lord ascending, things will almost certainly reverse. Why would he invite such trouble upon himself?"

"You think Wei Zhongxian will simply watch Prince Xin take the throne? We know Tianqi was followed by Chongzhen, but those bureaucrats don't."

"Tianqi has no heir—naturally it goes to a brother," someone explained.

"Actually, Tianqi had three sons in total, but none survived to adulthood. According to historical records and modern scholars, the princes were likely killed by Wei and Madam Ke. By the seventh year of Tianqi, his youngest son had been dead for two years. Once the emperor fell ill, the only one to inherit was his brother, Prince Xin, Zhu Youjian.

"Though Tianqi was foolish, he was devoted to Empress Zhang and his fifth brother Youjian. Wei Zhongxian once tried to fabricate a major case implicating the empress's father, Zhang Guoji, in 'plotting to install Prince Xin'—hoping to strike at his enemies. The eunuch Wang Tiqian, knowing the emperor's temperament, dissuaded him: 'Our lord is confused about everything except his brother and his wife. If anything goes wrong, we're all dead.' Wei Zhongxian was so terrified that he immediately abandoned the scheme. This shows everyone understood how much Xizong trusted the empress and Prince Xin. Unless Tianqi fathered another heir, Prince Xin's succession was certain the moment the emperor died. The bureaucrats understood this perfectly."

"Once the emperor falls ill, Wei Zhongxian's blue-chip stock in the Ming market becomes shaky, while Prince Xin's potential stock turns bullish. Who would heavily invest in a stock that might plummet below issue price or be delisted tomorrow?"

"So I should tell Gao Ju to delay past the eighteenth of the fifth month?"

"News won't travel that fast. It takes at least ten days for Beijing news to reach Guangzhou. Better to tell him to wait until month's end—the outcome will be clear by then."

"Hehe, though I'm not fond of playing prophet, I think on this matter we can demonstrate a little predictive ability—explicitly stating that on the eighteenth of the fifth month, there will be major changes in court politics." Yu Eshui smiled. "Predicting the future holds powerful allure for anyone—especially such major political upheaval. Once verified, the impact could be tremendous. It won't make anyone immediately bow and swear allegiance, but it can powerfully reinforce the notion that we're following Heaven's mandate."

This solution was not only clever but greatly satisfied the transmigrators' appetite for playing "prophet." Someone soon suggested that Yu Eshui act as "prophet" and meet directly with Gao Ju and Little Yang. Others proposed he travel to Beijing and seek out Cao Huachun—perhaps they could earn credit for supporting Chongzhen's enthronement, and the transmigrators could use modern technology and ideology to directly reform the emperor, leading China into a democratic, harmonious, prosperous Ming utopia...

Yu Eshui immediately lost his appetite. Did these people think the Eastern Depot and Embroidered Guard were deaf? Such "heretical speech" about the emperor's life and death—they'd be immediately dragged to the imperial prison to sample the eunuchs' tortures. Even if Cao Huachun were willing to listen to such ravings, Prince Xin was currently keeping a very low profile, barely seeing even close attendants—let alone some self-proclaimed "prophet"! If this resolution passed, whoever wanted to be a prophet could go—he wasn't joining this circus.

Fortunately, hotheads were few, and the wild proposal didn't pass. Yu Eshui then offered some practical details: don't speak too plainly, lest Gao Ju become frightened. Fear could trigger unpredictable reactions. Simply say there would be major changes on the eighteenth of the fifth month. And don't claim personal knowledge—say someone had "read the celestial omens" or something similarly vague. Keep it mysterious.

"One thing to absolutely remember: don't say Wei Zhongxian will be toppled or when the emperor will die. Such earth-shaking words will certainly reach Little Eunuch Yang through Gao Ju. Given their nature, to earn merit or avoid disaster, they'd immediately report such predictions and have you arrested!" Yu Eshui emphatically warned them at the end.
