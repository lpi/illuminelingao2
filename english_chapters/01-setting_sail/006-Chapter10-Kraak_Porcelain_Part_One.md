# Chapter 10: Kraak Porcelain (Part One)

That evening, the three men who had completed their first crossing held their inaugural debriefing. Following formal procedures, they produced minutes. As Wen Desi put it: "We are making history."

Their conclusion: they had underestimated the ancients' wisdom, done insufficient homework, knew too little about the Ming dynasty, and relied too heavily on assumptions.

Still, their luck had held—they'd found a suitable agent with relative ease.

As for trade, despite lower-than-expected prices, the profits were better than feared once properly calculated.

One *tael* of Ming silver equaled roughly 37.3 grams. Silver prices in their own time fluctuated, but roughly three yuan per gram (retail 3.6–3.8; purchase 2–2.6, taking the higher estimate) meant one tael yielded about 112 yuan. Factoring in fire-loss costs—Ming silver was often impure and needed re-smelting—returns would be somewhat lower.

Selling a powder compact for ten taels meant roughly 1,000 yuan per piece. Xiao Zishan had brought over two hundred; this item alone could net two thousand taels—two hundred thousand yuan. Wholesale cost was only a few yuan each. Negligible.

"We could flip this again," said Xiao Zishan, scribbling calculations. "The gold-to-silver ratio in the late Ming was around one to ten. Convert two thousand taels to gold, we'd get two hundred taels—7,460 grams. At 150 yuan per gram, that's over a million. More profitable than selling goods."

"Gold circulation is limited, though," Wang Luobin said with regret. "You can't exchange for very much."

"There's something worth even more than gold," said Wen Desi.

"What?"

"Porcelain." He pointed at a Christie's auction notice in the newspaper. "Ming-dynasty porcelain—do I need to explain?"

When a pale-faced servant came running, Master Gao knew the three Australians had arrived again. Late at night, as before—materialized out of nowhere in the warehouse courtyard.

Had they not come in broad daylight the previous time and left the same way, he'd truly have suspected ghosts or demons.

"Master Gao, the goods."

Under the study veranda, servants had piled four or five cardboard boxes from the courtyard. Paper cargo boxes—a first for him. His heart pounded. Days earlier, he'd secretly doused the sample merchandise with chicken blood; the next day, the items remained perfectly fine—not transformed into dirt clods or wooden dolls. Only then had he relaxed.

"Steward Yan, inventory these," Master Gao instructed.

"Yes, Master."

The steward led the servants in opening boxes. Each item lay wrapped in exquisite paper, neatly arranged. Master Gao nodded. These Australian merchants were extravagant indeed—the packaging alone must have cost a fortune.

The three sat watching the inventory. In dim candlelight, Master Gao's Nanjing silk robe shimmered. Xiao Zishan thought inexplicably of burial garments and felt goosebumps rise.

Fortunately, they had prepared a gift. Once inventory was complete and figures verified, Wen Desi opened a box and produced a kerosene lamp—located with difficulty at a handicraft shop, 120 yuan, their most expensive item. He poured in kerosene, lit the wick from a nearby candle. The flame grew bright; the dim study flooded with light.

Master Gao and his servants stood slack-jawed. Of everything the Australian merchants had brought, nothing impressed them as deeply as this.

"This is called a kerosene lamp. A token of our appreciation."

"What a marvel!" Master Gao stepped closer—a ball of white flame, dazzlingly bright, encased in transparent glass. "Is this made in your country? What is its value?"

Xiao Zishan reflected on humanity's primal yearning for light. What they'd assumed would astonish the ancients had barely caused a ripple; yet this obsolete kerosene lamp astounded them—simply because it was so much brighter than candles or oil lamps. What if Master Gao could see an electric light? Xiao Zishan felt sudden confidence in their crossing plans.

"Made in our country," Wen Desi smiled with a merchant's cunning. "Two hundred taels will suffice."

"A marvel!" Master Gao circled the lamp, mesmerized, turning the knob to dim and brighten the flame at will. He knew this object, oddly shaped and fitted with expensive glass, was essentially a common lamp. Yet it was ten times brighter, with no smell, no smoke, and adjustable. Were Australian craftsmen all reincarnations of Lu Ban?

A thought struck him. "This oil—this 'kerosene'—does Australia produce it?"

Xiao Zishan nodded. Master Gao was sharp—he'd grasped the crux at once.

"It does."

"The price?"

"Ten taels per bottle." A bottle was just one liter. They had no intention of launching a kerosene trade yet; a premium now left room for the future. (Retail: 8.5 yuan per liter for lamp kerosene in Shanghai.)

"The lamp is fine, but the oil..." Master Gao's face showed regret.

"One bottle burns over a dozen hours. A month's supply—ten or twenty taels. Not excessive."

"If the oil were cheaper, I could sell this widely..." Master Gao was reluctant to let it go.

Xiao Zishan laughed evasively. Master Gao understood they wouldn't budge. Still, receiving the lamp as a gift with twelve bottles of kerosene was a windfall. Perhaps vegetable oil could substitute—he would try tomorrow.

Xiao Zishan demonstrated disassembly, maintenance, and refilling. Gao Ju had a young servant watch, learn, and practice until he made no mistakes. Then they tallied the goods.

At agreed prices, the total came to over three thousand taels. Xiao Zishan requested fifteen hundred in gold. Master Gao shook his head—at night, nowhere to exchange, and he had only fifty or sixty taels on hand. They settled for sixty taels of gold in place of six hundred silver.

Xiao Zishan then proposed purchasing porcelain. This surprised no one—overseas merchants always wanted porcelain. His warehouse was piled with the stuff. He ordered several hampers of export ware brought out.

Cutting the straw bindings, Xiao Zishan examined several pieces. Drawing on hastily-read ceramics books, he recognized them as "Kraak porcelain"—classic late-Ming export ware.

What was it worth in their time? An ordinary plate fetched several thousand yuan. On December 10, 2005, porcelain salvaged by Swedish diver Sten Sjöstrand from the South China Sea had been auctioned at China Guardian's "Ming Wanli and Qing Desaru Shipwreck Ceramics" session. Despite severe glaze corrosion from long submersion, 214 pieces of Kraak porcelain achieved a 92% sale rate and 2.727 million yuan. One blue-and-white lotus-petal medallion dish with bird-and-flower design sold for 55,000 yuan.

And here, brand-new Kraak porcelain filled several hampers before their eyes.

They bought it all for less than twenty taels. Xiao Zishan and the others cheered inwardly at the bargain; Master Gao laughed privately at these sea merchants who didn't know the market. Both sides believed they'd gotten the better deal.

Before leaving, Wen Desi left two hundred taels and asked Master Gao to purchase a nearby house for their base. The wormhole exit would be stationed there. Master Gao agreed.

After the merchants departed, Master Gao sat alone thinking, even turning away the concubine who came to invite him to bed. Purchasing a house was easy—but these people's identities remained murky. After pacing, he summoned his steward and ordered silence about the Australian merchants. He also had the steward list all servants, footmen, and maids who knew—anyone who let slip would face strict investigation and severe punishment.
