# Chapter 39: New Arrivals

For the entire ride back to base, Xiao Zishan kept up a steady stream of meaningless pleasantries—remarking on the weather, commenting on the scenery—anything to fill the silence. Whenever one of the four newcomers ventured a substantive question, he would pivot seamlessly into a rambling tribute to their driver: how hard the man worked, how modest his rates were, how thankless a life it was running an unlicensed taxi. The message was plain enough. *Watch what you say around outsiders.*

Meng Xian stepped off the minibus and drew a long breath of fresh air. *Not bad here,* he thought, surveying his surroundings. Already three or four young people in training uniforms were approaching to help with the luggage.

They were shepherded into a dormitory that retained the austere bones of its former life as military barracks—worn but functional, with iron-frame bunk beds arranged three to a room. Army blankets, bamboo mats, slippers, washbasins, cups, toothbrushes, towels—everything a person might need had been thoughtfully laid out.

"Please, everyone, sit." Xiao Zishan smiled broadly, gesturing with the expansive wave of a movie producer welcoming guests to his studio lot. "The accommodations are a bit rustic, I'm afraid, but I trust you'll manage. After all"—his smile widened—"where we're headed will be considerably rougher."

"Better than I'd imagined, actually," observed the bespectacled fellow who'd introduced himself as Tian Jiujiu, glancing around with an appraising eye.

"We do try to make everyone comfortable. D-Day is still some time off—rest up, stay in good shape." Xiao Zishan gestured toward the door. "For now, head over to Building No. 1 to register."

What followed was several hours of administrative processing. First came personal information forms on computer terminals—name, birth date, education, major, work history, various skills and certifications. The skills section alone was exhaustive, spanning thirteen major categories and roughly a hundred individual items, each with multiple proficiency levels to select. Xiao Zishan guided them through every field, repeatedly emphasizing accuracy and thoroughness. Even hobbies were subdivided extensively. Each person took nearly twenty minutes to complete.

Next came the medical room, where a white-coated specialist reviewed the physical examination records they'd brought from their local clinics. Everyone had been required to complete comprehensive exams before arrival, and all this data was entered into the system. They also submitted proof of vaccinations mandated by the Executive Committee, completed at local health stations. The doctor scrutinized everything with meticulous care, emphasizing repeatedly that this was a matter of life and death—concealing anything would be the height of foolishness. Anyone missing required doses could receive supplementary shots on-site.

Finally, the doctor produced two white pills and had each person swallow them then and there.

"What are these?" Zha Wuchu eyed the medication with deep suspicion.

"Anthelmintics." The doctor's explanation was terse.

"I don't have worms!" Zha Wuchu protested, looking genuinely offended.

"Take them anyway. Won't hurt you." The doctor remained unmoved. "You're going someplace without modern sanitation."

After downing the pills, they were directed to the dental room. A young man examined each person's mouth in turn, tapping around with practiced efficiency. Their teeth proved acceptable—mercifully, the dentist produced no terrifying drills. Just as they began to relax, assuming the ordeal was over, he tore off three appointment slips.

"Come back the day after tomorrow at 3 PM for cleaning."

Still nursing that instinctive fear of dentists, they returned to registration. Xiao Zishan was waiting behind a computer, holding a collection of metal chains with pendants.

"These are your ID tags." He distributed the chains. Besides a metal plate engraved with name and serial number, each one held something resembling a small USB drive sealed in opaque material.

"Dog tags," someone observed.

"Essentially, yes—but electronic." Xiao Zishan explained the system. The metal ID plate was straightforward enough. The USB-like device was an identification card that, through wireless sensing, could automatically retrieve each person's complete records from the server database. It also functioned like a campus all-in-one pass.

"So we can use this for meals? Do we need to top it up?"

"No top-up required—just swipe at the cafeteria." Xiao Zishan motioned for them to sit. "Let me explain how things work here. Everything at the base is provided. Whatever you need, you apply through the Executive Committee's logistics team, and we'll issue it. But understand—this only covers daily necessities. Cigarettes, alcohol, similar luxuries? Those still require RMB. There's a store on-site."

"What about internet?" Zha Wuchu asked, with the urgency of someone nursing a significant online addiction.

"Also free, but you'll need to log in with your ID card."

"There's still some time until D-Day—within the next month or two. The main requirements and rules were already explained before you came." Everyone nodded. "Try not to leave the base during this period. If you must go out, request permission first. The logistics team has already delivered your issued supplies to the dorm. Also, the Planning Coordination Group would like to inspect everyone's personal belongings. Some items you may have forgotten to declare; others may need to be handed over to the Resource Group for collective use." Xiao Zishan smiled reassuringly. "We'll compensate at fair value, of course—converted to shares or vouchers, whichever you prefer."

"The general meeting will be held soon. Rest well for a few days first. I'd recommend visiting the internet café and logging in with your ID card to review internal materials—our plan overview, current progress. Think it over carefully. If anyone wants to withdraw, all your belongings and money will be returned."

"Anyone who wanted to quit wouldn't have come," someone remarked.

"Perhaps not. But think it over again regardless." Xiao Zishan's expression grew serious. "After all, you'll be disappearing completely from this world. As good as dead. No one is made of stone; everyone has attachments. Consider carefully whether you can truly make this decision."

In the base's large meeting room, name cards were arranged on the table. With spectators included, roughly a dozen people had gathered—quite a lively scene.

Wen Desi glanced out the window. "Someone's watching us?" He tossed down an S card.

"That's right." The speaker was Zhong Lishi, who had cultivated many local connections over the past year. "I heard about it the day before yesterday while playing cards at the Armed Forces Department. Apparently the... *Bureau* called to ask questions."

"Bullshit. Starting a company isn't illegal." Wei Aiwen put his feet up on his chair.

Ma Qianzhu played a card at his leisure. "Watching porn isn't illegal either—try doing it in the street." He frowned at Wei Aiwen's feet. "Did you wash those?"

"We're not watching porn either." Wei Aiwen was growing annoyed. Everyone here spoke in half-hints and roundabout allusions.

"That would be called 'organizing group pornographic viewing.' Back during the Strike Hard campaign in the '80s, that alone would've been enough to get you shot." Xiao Zishan chuckled.

"You're just making things up—executed for watching porn? Are you getting paid five cents too?" Wei Aiwen shot back.

"Ah, the greatness of time." With that irrelevant pronouncement, Xiao Zishan continued flipping through his notebook. "I genuinely do feel something's off lately. A suspicious person showed up at the bus station yesterday."

"Could it be the legendary... *Bureau*?"

"Hard to say." Xiao Zishan paused. He'd meant to mention this the previous day but had forgotten. "Might just be coincidence. But he had the feel of someone from the dictatorship apparatus..."

"That's the same as saying nothing," Wei Aiwen attacked immediately.

"True," Xiao Zishan admitted. "But I sensed he was particularly interested in the word 'crossing.'"

The room fell silent, as if a secret had been inadvertently exposed.

After a long moment, Ma Qianzhu turned to Wen Desi. "Director Wen, should we accelerate things? Most people have already arrived. Those who aren't coming won't come."

"How much faster can we go?" Wen Desi shuffled cards slowly. "We still haven't resolved the ship situation."

"Can't we just rent one?"

"We're a brand-new company, barely a year old. Who'd rent to us? Even if someone would, the cost would approach buying outright."

"Then buy used."

"This isn't like buying a used car—you don't just walk into a market and pick one. The paperwork alone is exhausting. Wang Luobin has been running around on this for two months."

"Spend more to grease the wheels," Zhong Lishi suggested. "Don't be too picky—if it's expensive, so be it. RMB will be worthless to us soon anyway."

"We still need cash on hand for emergencies."

"Stock up on gold and silver instead. In an emergency, everyone accepts those."

"Speaking of gold and silver," another voice chimed in, "shouldn't we bring some 925 industrial silver? Better yet, mint some Spanish *reales de a ocho* to bring over. Otherwise, how do we trade with locals immediately after crossing?"

"That era doesn't lack silver," Luo Duo disagreed. "Bringing it—first, it's not cost-effective; second, it takes up tonnage. Trade doesn't have to depend on precious metals. Barter works fine."

"Industrial production takes time!" Zhong Lishi grew animated. "How long before our factories can produce enough goods for trade? At least three months. Where do you get supplies and construction materials during those three months? Don't tell me we're going to rob people!"

"Brother, do you know about salt?" Luo Duo said slowly. "Since ancient times, salt has been a universal currency worldwide. At least in the era we're going to, it still carries purchasing power with the local population."

Zhong Lishi calmed somewhat. "Do we know how to make salt?"

"Not from experience, but we know the methods. I've got mountains of reference materials—refined salt, iodized salt, pickling salt..." Luo Duo smiled with expansive confidence. "Who here knows how to smelt steel from memory? Make glass? Build rifles? We possess the accumulated wisdom of three thousand years of civilization, every technological advance since the Industrial Revolution—" His hand swept dramatically through the air. "We are omnipotent!"

This speech, which he clearly considered inspiring, sank into the swamp of silence like a stone. Apart from Zhong Lishi's skeptical glance, it produced no ripples whatsoever.

Over the next few minutes, Luo Duo expounded on his salt-making knowledge, occasionally sparring with Zhong Lishi in arguments that were neither particularly professional nor objective. Finally, Ma Qianzhu sighed:

"Why do our discussions always go off-topic?"

"Habitual digression..." Wen Desi observed. "Alright, alright—we'll discuss financial matters later. Zishan, what's the status on personnel check-in?" He seemed to remember something. "How are those four you brought back today?"
