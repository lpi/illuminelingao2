# Chapter 43: Just Arrived

On the ride back to base, Xiao Zishan made small talk with the four new arrivals—"Nice weather today, isn't it?"—for the entire journey. Whenever one of them tried to ask a substantive question, he'd launch into a monologue about how hard the driver worked, how little he charged, how running an unlicensed taxi was no easy way to earn a living. The message was clear enough: watch what you say around outsiders.

Meng Xian stepped off the minibus and drew a deep breath of fresh air. *Not bad here.* He looked around, taking in his surroundings. Already three or four young people in training uniforms were approaching to help with the luggage.

The newcomers were shepherded into the dormitory. The building retained its original barracks structure—somewhat worn but still functional. Each room held three iron-frame bunk beds. Army blankets, bamboo mats, slippers, washbasins, cups, toothbrushes, towels—all the essentials had been laid out, looking quite thoughtfully arranged.

"Everyone, please sit." Xiao Zishan smiled broadly, waving his hand with the expansive gesture of a movie manager. "Living conditions are a bit rustic, I'm afraid. But I trust everyone can adapt. After all"—his smile widened—"where we're going will be considerably rougher."

"Better than I'd imagined, actually." The bespectacled fellow who'd introduced himself as Tian Jiujiu glanced around appraisingly.

"We try to make everyone comfortable. D-Day is still some time away—rest up, stay in good shape." Xiao Zishan gestured toward the door. "For now, everyone should head over to Building No. 1 to register."

Over the next several hours, they first filled out personal information forms on computers—name, birth date, education, major, work experience, various skills and certifications. The skills section was particularly exhaustive, covering thirteen major categories and roughly a hundred individual items, each with different proficiency levels. Xiao Zishan guided them through the process, repeatedly emphasizing accuracy and thoroughness. Hobbies were also subdivided extensively. Each person took nearly twenty minutes to complete the form.

Next came the medical room. A white-coated specialist reviewed the physical examination records they'd brought from local medical centers—everyone had been required to complete comprehensive exams before arrival. All this data was entered into computers. They also submitted proof of vaccinations mandated by the Executive Committee, completed at local health stations. The doctor reviewed everything carefully, repeatedly emphasizing that this was a matter of life and death. Concealing anything would be the height of foolishness. Those who hadn't completed requirements could receive supplementary doses locally.

Finally, the doctor produced two white pills and had each person swallow them on the spot.

"What's this?" Zha Wuchu eyed the pills with deep suspicion.

"Anthelmintics." The white-coat's explanation was terse.

"I don't have worms!" Zha Wuchu protested, looking genuinely offended.

"Take it anyway. Won't hurt." The doctor remained unmoved. "You're going someplace without modern sanitation."

After downing the pills, they ended up in the dental room. A young man examined each person's mouth in turn, tapping around with practiced efficiency. Their teeth were apparently acceptable—the young dentist didn't produce any terrifying drills. Just as they began to relax, assuming they were finished, he tore off three appointment slips.

"Come back day after tomorrow at 3 PM for teeth cleaning."

Still nursing their instinctive fear of dentists, they returned to registration. Xiao Zishan was waiting behind a computer, holding a collection of metal chains with pendants.

"These are everyone's ID tags." He distributed the chains. Besides a metal plate engraved with name and serial number, each chain held something resembling a small USB drive, sealed in opaque material.

"Dog tags," someone observed.

"Hehe, yes—but electronic." Xiao Zishan explained the system. The metal ID plate was straightforward enough. The USB-like device was an identification card that, through wireless sensing, could automatically retrieve each person's complete records from the server database. The card also functioned like a campus all-in-one pass.

"So we can use this for meals? Do we need to top it up?"

"No top-up required. Just swipe the card at the cafeteria." Xiao Zishan gestured for them to sit. "Let me explain how things work here. Everything at the base is provided. Whatever you need, you can apply through the Executive Committee's logistics team, and we'll issue it. But note—this only applies to daily necessities. If you want cigarettes, alcohol, or similar luxuries, you'll still need RMB. There's a store on site."

"What about internet access?" Zha Wuchu appeared to have a significant online addiction.

"Also free. But you'll need to log in with your ID card."

"There's still some time until D-Day, though it's within the next month or two. The main requirements and rules have already been explained before you came."

Everyone nodded.

"Try not to leave the base during this period. If you must go out, request permission first. The logistics team has already delivered your issued supplies to the dorm. Also, the Planning Coordination Group would like to inspect everyone's personal belongings. Some items you may have forgotten to declare; others may need to be handed over to the Resource Group for collective use." Xiao Zishan smiled reassuringly. "Of course, we'll compensate at fair value—converted to shares or vouchers, whichever you prefer."

"The general meeting will be held soon. Everyone should rest well for a few days first. I'd recommend visiting the internet café here and logging in with your ID card to review internal materials—our plan overview and current progress. Think it over carefully. If anyone wants to withdraw, all your belongings and money will be returned."

"Anyone who wanted to quit wouldn't have come," someone remarked.

"No problem—think it over again regardless." Xiao Zishan's expression grew more serious. "After all, you'll be completely disappearing from this world. As good as dead. No one is made of stone; everyone has attachments. Consider carefully whether you can truly make this decision."

In the base's large meeting room, name cards were arranged on the table. With spectators included, roughly a dozen people made for quite a lively scene.

Wen Desi glanced out the window. "Someone's watching us?" He tossed down an S card.

"That's right." The speaker was Zhong Lishi. Over the past year, he'd cultivated many local connections. "I heard about it the day before yesterday while playing cards at the Armed Forces Department. Apparently the... *Bureau* called to ask questions."

"That's bullshit—starting a company isn't illegal." Wei Aiwen put his feet up on his chair.

Ma Qianzhu leisurely played a card. "Watching porn isn't illegal either—try doing it in the street." He frowned at Wei Aiwen's feet. "Did you wash those?"

"We're not watching porn either." Wei Aiwen was growing annoyed. Everyone here spoke in half-hints and roundabout allusions.

"That would be called 'organizing group pornographic viewing.'" Xiao Zishan chuckled.

"You're just making things up. Getting paid five cents for that?" Wei Aiwen shot back.

"Ah, the greatness of time." After that irrelevant remark, Xiao Zishan continued flipping through his notebook. "I genuinely do feel something's off lately. A suspicious person showed up at the bus station yesterday."

"Could it be the legendary... *Bureau*?"

"Hard to say." Xiao Zishan paused. He'd actually meant to mention this the previous day but had forgotten. "Might just be coincidence. But he felt like someone from the dictatorship apparatus..."

"That's the same as saying nothing." Wei Aiwen immediately attacked.

"True." Xiao Zishan admitted. "But I sensed he was particularly interested in the word 'crossing.'"

The room fell silent, as if a secret had been inadvertently exposed.

After a long moment, Ma Qianzhu turned to Wen Desi. "Director Wen, should we accelerate things? Most people have already arrived. Those who aren't coming won't come."

"How much faster can we go?" Wen Desi shuffled cards slowly. "We still haven't resolved the ship situation!"

"Can't we just rent one?"

"We're a brand-new company, barely a year old. Who'd rent to us? Even if someone would, the cost would approach buying outright."

"Then buy a used ship."

"This isn't like buying a used car—you don't just walk into a market and pick one. The paperwork alone is exhausting. Wang Luobin has been running around on this for two months."

"Spend more to grease the wheels. Don't be too picky—if it's expensive, so be it." Zhong Lishi suggested. "RMB will be worthless to us soon anyway."

"We still need to keep some cash on hand for emergencies."

"Just stock up on gold and silver instead. In an emergency, everyone accepts those."

"Speaking of gold and silver," another voice chimed in, "shouldn't we bring some 925 industrial silver? Better yet, mint some Spanish *reales de a ocho* to bring over. Otherwise, how do we trade with locals immediately after crossing?"

"That era doesn't lack silver." Luo Duo disagreed. "Bringing silver—first, it's not cost-effective; second, it takes up tonnage. Trade doesn't have to depend on precious metals. Barter works fine."

"Industrial production takes time!" Zhong Lishi grew animated. "How long do you think before our factories can produce enough goods for trade? At least three months. Where do you get supplies and construction materials during those three months? Don't tell me we're going to rob people!"

"Brother, do you know about salt?" Luo Duo said slowly. "Since ancient times, salt has been a universal currency worldwide. At least in the era we're going to, it still has purchasing power with the local population."

Zhong Lishi calmed somewhat. "Do we know how to make salt?"

"Not from experience, but we know the methods. I've got mountains of reference materials. Refined salt, iodized salt, pickling salt..." Luo Duo smiled with expansive confidence. "Who here knows how to smelt steel from memory? Make glass? Build rifles? We possess the accumulated wisdom of three thousand years of civilization, every technological advance since the Industrial Revolution—" his hand swept dramatically through the air—"We are omnipotent!"

This speech, which he clearly considered inspiring, sank into the swamp of silence like a stone. Apart from Zhong Lishi's skeptical glance, it produced no ripples whatsoever.

Over the next few minutes, Luo Duo expounded on his salt-making knowledge, occasionally sparring with Zhong Lishi in arguments that were neither particularly professional nor objective. Finally, Ma Qianzhu sighed:

"Why do our discussions always go off-topic?"

"Habitual digression..." Wen Desi observed. "Alright, alright—we'll discuss financial matters later. Zishan, what's the status on personnel check-in?" He seemed to remember something. "How are those four you brought back today?"
