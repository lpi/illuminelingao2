# Chapter 43: Just Arrived

On the way back to the base, Xiao Zishan made small talk with the four new arrivals—"Nice weather, haha"—for the entire journey. When one of them tried to ask something, Xiao Zishan immediately started going on about how the driver worked so hard, charged so little, running a 'black taxi' wasn't easy money, and so forth. The implication was clear: watch what you say around outsiders.

Meng Xian stepped off the bus and took a deep breath of fresh air. *Not bad here.* Looking around, three or four young people in training uniforms were already approaching to help with the luggage.

The four newcomers were welcomed into the dormitory. The dorm retained its original barracks structure—somewhat worn but still functional. Each room had three double bunk beds with iron frames. Army blankets, bamboo mats, slippers, basins, cups, toothbrushes, towels—all the essentials were provided, looking quite thoughtfully arranged.

"Everyone sit, sit." Xiao Zishan smiled broadly, waving his hand like a manager in a movie. "Living conditions are a bit rough. I hope everyone can get used to it. Hehe, after all, where we're going will be even tougher."

"Better than I imagined." The bespectacled fellow who called himself Tian Jiujiu looked around.

"We try to make everyone comfortable. After all, D-Day is still some time away. Rest up and stay in good shape." Xiao Zishan continued, "Everyone go register at Building No. 1 in a bit."

Over the next few hours, they first filled out a personal information form on a computer—name, birth date, education, major, work experience, various skills and certificates. The skills section was particularly detailed, covering thirteen major categories and about a hundred items, each with different proficiency levels. Xiao Zishan guided them through the forms, repeatedly emphasizing accuracy and thoroughness. Hobbies were also subdivided extensively. Each person took nearly twenty minutes to complete.

Then they were taken to the medical room. A white-coated expert type reviewed their physical examination records from local medical centers—everyone had completed comprehensive exams as required before coming. All this medical data was entered into computers. They also submitted proof of the vaccinations required by the Executive Committee, completed at local health stations. The doctor in white repeatedly reminded them: this was a matter of life and death. Don't conceal anything. Those who hadn't completed requirements could get boosters locally.

Finally, the doctor gave each person two white pills to take on the spot.

"What's this?" Zha Wuchu looked at the pills suspiciously.

"Anthelmintics." The white-coat explained tersely.

"I don't have worms!" Zha Wuchu protested, feeling deeply insulted.

"Take it. Won't hurt." The doctor was unmoved. "You're going to a place without modern sanitation."

After taking the pills, they ended up in the dental room. This time a young man tapped around in each person's mouth. Their teeth were apparently fine—the young dentist didn't bring out any terrifying drills. Just as they relaxed and prepared to leave, the dentist tore off three appointment slips.

"Come back day after tomorrow at 3 PM for teeth cleaning."

When they returned to registration, still fearful of dentists, Xiao Zishan was waiting behind a computer, holding a bunch of metal chains with pendants.

"These are everyone's ID tags." Xiao Zishan distributed the chains. Besides a metal plate engraved with a name and serial number, there was something resembling a small USB drive, sealed in opaque material.

"Dog tags," someone said.

"Hehe, yes. But electronic." Xiao Zishan explained their use. The metal ID plate was nothing special. The USB-like thing was an ID card that, through wireless sensing, could automatically retrieve each person's complete records from the server database. Of course, the card also functioned like a campus all-in-one card.

"So we can use this card for meals? Do we need to top it up?"

"No top-up needed. Just swipe the card at the cafeteria. From now on, we're on a supply system." Xiao Zishan gestured for them to sit. "Let me explain: everything at the base is provided. Whatever you need, you can apply for through the Executive Committee's logistics team, and we'll issue it. But note—this applies only to daily necessities. If you want cigarettes, alcohol, or the like, you'll still need RMB. There's a store here."

"What about internet?" Zha Wuchu appeared to have quite an online addiction.

"Also free. But you need to log in with your ID card."

"There's still some time until D-Day, but it's within the next month or two. As for the main points and rules, the Executive Committee has already explained before you came."

Everyone nodded.

"Try not to go out recently. If you must leave, request permission. The logistics team has already delivered your issued supplies to the dorm. Also, the Planning Coordination Group would like to inspect the belongings you brought. Some items you may have forgotten; others may need to be handed over to the Resource Group for collective use." Xiao Zishan smiled. "Of course, we'll compensate at fair value—converted to shares or vouchers, as you prefer."

"The general meeting will be held soon. Everyone rest well for a few days first. Best to go to the internet café here and log in with your ID card to review internal materials—our plan overview and progress. Think it over carefully. If you want to withdraw, all your belongings and money will be returned."

"Anyone who wanted to quit wouldn't have come," someone said.

"No problem—think it over again. After all, you'll be completely disappearing from this world. No one is made of stone; there are always attachments. Consider whether you can really make this decision."

In the base's large meeting room, name cards were set on the table. With spectators included, about a dozen people made quite a lively scene.

Wen Desi glanced out the window: "Someone's watching us?"—he tossed down an S card.

"That's right. I heard about it day before yesterday when I was playing cards at the Armed Forces Department," said the speaker, Zhong Lishi. Over the past year, he'd made many local connections. "I hear the... *Bureau* called to ask about this."

"Bullshit—starting a company isn't illegal." Wei Aiwen put his feet up on the chair.

Ma Qianzhu leisurely played a card: "Watching porn isn't illegal either—try doing it in the street." He frowned. "Did you wash those feet?"

"We're not watching porn either." Wei Aiwen was annoyed. Everyone here spoke in half-hints and roundabout ways.

"That would be called 'organizing group porn viewing.'" Xiao Zishan chuckled.

"You're just making things up. Getting paid five cents too?" Wei Aiwen shot back.

"That's the greatness of time." After that irrelevant remark, Xiao Zishan continued flipping through his notebook. "I do feel something's off lately. Someone suspicious showed up at the station yesterday."

"Could it be the legendary... *Bureau*?"

"Hard to say." Xiao Zishan paused. Actually, he'd meant to mention this yesterday but forgot. "Maybe just a coincidence. Felt like someone from the dictatorship apparatus..."

"That's the same as saying nothing." Wei Aiwen immediately attacked.

"True." Xiao Zishan admitted. "But I felt he was particularly interested in the word 'crossing.'"

The room fell silent for a moment, as if a secret had been exposed.

After a few minutes, Ma Qianzhu said to Wen Desi: "Director Wen, should we speed things up? Most people have arrived now. Those who aren't coming won't come."

"How much faster?" Wen Desi shuffled cards slowly. "We still haven't figured out the ship!"

"Can't rent one?"

"We're a new company, barely a year old. Who'd rent to us? Even if someone would, it'd cost almost as much as buying new."

"Just buy a used ship then."

"This isn't like buying a used car—just go to a market and you're done. The paperwork issues are exhausting. Wang Luobin has been running around on this for two months."

"Spend more money to grease the wheels. Don't be too picky. If it's expensive, so be it." Zhong Lishi suggested. "RMB will be useless to us soon anyway."

"We still need to keep some on hand for emergencies."

"Just stock up on gold and silver. This stuff, in an emergency, everyone accepts."

"Speaking of gold and silver, shouldn't we bring some 925 industrial silver? Even better, mint some Spanish real de a ocho to bring over. Otherwise, how do we trade with the locals right after crossing?"

"That era doesn't lack silver. Bringing silver—first, it's not cost-effective; second, it takes up tonnage. Trade doesn't have to depend on real gold and silver. Barter works fine." Luo Duo disagreed.

"Industrial production takes time!" Zhong Lishi grew excited. "How long do you think before our factories can produce enough for trade? At least three months. Where do you get supplies and construction purchases during those three months? Don't tell me we're going to rob!"

"Brother, do you know about salt..." Luo Duo said slowly. "Since ancient times, salt has been a universal currency worldwide. At least in the era we're going to, it still has purchasing power with the locals."

Zhong Lishi calmed down a bit: "Do we know how to make salt?"

"No, but we know the methods. I've got mountains of materials. Refined salt, iodized salt, pickling salt..." Luo Duo smiled grandly. "Who here knows how to smelt steel? Make glass? Build rifles? We possess the wisdom of three thousand years of civilization, all the modern technology since the Industrial Revolution—" his hand swept dramatically—"We are omnipotent!"

This speech, which he considered inspiring, sank into the swamp with a single plop and disappeared. Apart from Zhong Lishi's skeptical glance, it stirred no ripples.

Over the next few minutes, Luo Duo showed off his salt-making knowledge, occasionally sparring with Zhong Lishi in arguments that were neither professional nor objective. Suddenly Ma Qianzhu sighed:

"Why do our discussions always go off-topic?"

"Habitual digression..." Wen Desi said. "Alright, alright, we'll discuss financial issues later. Zishan, how's the personnel check-in situation?" He seemed to remember something. "How are those four you brought back?"
