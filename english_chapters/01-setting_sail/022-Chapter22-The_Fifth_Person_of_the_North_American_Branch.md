# Chapter 22: The Fifth Person of the North American Branch

Shi Niaoren returned to America the next day. As for which weapons to purchase—with too many opinions and no decision—the North American contingent said to wait for their update before acting. Weapons shouldn't be stored too long; purchasing a few months before departure would be fine.

For the Executive Committee, the discussions left everyone unsatisfied. Many felt something stuck in their throats. Every proposal somehow failed to match their vision. When discussing military weapons, though no one had actually used them, many knew enough to hold forth at length. But civilian versions were a complete blank for urban shut-ins. They had no theoretical foundation—essentially stumbling in the dark.

Jiang Ye spent those days lobbying Committee members and Xi Yazhou, pushing his all-in-one weapons plan: semi-automatic rifles plus bolt-action Mosin-Nagants. Director Wen was tempted; he even looked up information on the Type 38 Arisaka—that weapon with a bayonet could form a magnificent pike formation. Alas, the Athletics Group had no interest in continuing revolutionary traditions by working the bolt. His efforts among the masses garnered little support—people wanted weapons that could "spray." Whether automatic rifle or submachine gun didn't matter, but bolt-action was absolutely rejected. It gave no sense of security.

Unexpectedly, a few days later, they received an overseas call from Dr. Shi. Another person had joined the North American contingent and was about to return to discuss weapons. This one, he said, had fired even more types of guns than Xiao Rui, knew the North American civilian weapons market like the back of his hand, and had "fired artillery on the ground and flown Mustangs in the sky." His exploits commanded respect. Most assumed the arrival would be muscular and burly.

What they saw at the base was an elegant young man, slightly slick in appearance. Everyone was disappointed, doubting Dr. Shi's words.

The newcomer introduced himself as Lin Shenhe, a firearms enthusiast. Thanks to the decadent, backward U.S.A., he had spent years in America handling countless famous and obscure firearms, even participating in building a Nordenfelt machine gun and a Napoleonic 12-pounder bronze cannon. The military buffs drooled. After hearing the Committee's firearms briefing, he smiled leisurely, mystifying everyone.

Xiao Zishan, seeing that smile, was reminded of Tang Guoqiang playing Zhuge Liang on television. Unfortunately, no one was there to ask: "Why does the strategist smile?"

"You all don't understand the North American civilian weapons market, do you?" Lin Shenhe's voice was soft but perfectly clear. "Civilian weapons are actually quite different from military ones, and performance varies considerably by manufacturer." He paused. "Take the AR-15—everyone knows it's the civilian version of the M-16. Actually, the various profiteers making civilian products in America are cunning; their products are nothing like what American GIs carry. AR-15 barrels—even the standard ones—often aren't chrome-lined.

"Or take the M1A that Xi Yazhou recommended—the civilian version of the M-14 from Springfield Armory. Many enthusiasts love it. Actually, its receiver is investment-cast, unlike the forged receivers of military-contract M-14s. By contrast, Norinco's M-14s have forged receivers—just poor quality."

"So American profiteers use the U.S. military for advertising while selling shoddy goods to the hardworking American masses?"

"It's not exactly shoddy. The North American civilian gun market is enormous, with demand from all income levels. It's different from military contracts. There are companies that simplify production to reduce prices, and those making expensive premium products. Take civilian M-14s—LRB Arms uses forged receivers and costs much more than Springfield. Basically, anyone at any income level can find what they consider best value."

After Lin Shenhe's introduction, everyone realized how complex American civilian guns were. They looked at him with newfound respect.

"So what's your weapon recommendation?"

"That depends on Executive Committee requirements. On semi-automatic selection, I agree with Team Leader Xi—given our environment, semi-automatics are optimal. With 200 semi-auto rifles, we can handle any complex situation in the initial phase."

"We have no objections. The problem is choosing which semi-automatic."

"For good value, the SKS really is excellent. Retail is $400; M43 ammunition in North America is very cheap—suitable for large-scale issue. And stock is plentiful."

"Didn't Xiao Rui say Mosin-Nagants are only $80 each? $400 buys five!" The bolt-action faction persisted loyally. "And the ammunition is cheaper."

"Which of you has actually used a Mosin-Nagant?" Lin Shenhe wore his all-knowing smile. "Among bolt-actions, the Mosin has the hardest bolt to work—people say you need to kick it open. And bolt-action rifles require extensive practice to develop combat effectiveness."

"You could choose others... like the Lee-Enfield."

"That's possible. But in my view, bolt-actions would be fine as equipment for native troops later. We transmigrators should be better equipped, for confidence if nothing else."

"I still oppose Warsaw Pact weapons." Xi Yazhou maintained his position. "Service life is too poor."

"That's not entirely true. Warsaw Pact weapons do have poor-quality examples—it depends on manufacturer. On the North American civilian market, AK-series rifles from Russia's IZMASH and similar factories use cold-hammer-forged barrels with chrome-lined bores, rated for over 80,000 rounds. Among AR-15s, only the HK416 uses cold-hammer-forged barrels. Bulgarian Arsenal-produced AKs claim barrel life of 15,000 rounds or more—that's what the U.S. distributor told me."

"Then let's bulk-buy AKs! We can convert them to full-auto!" The AK faction grew triumphant.

"I tend to agree with Xi Yazhou—we should at least have some semi-autos chambered in full-power cartridges." Lin Shenhe unhurriedly offered his endorsement. "Considering combat needs, Team Leader Xi's thinking is comprehensive. It's not just about range—full-power rounds have penetration against old-style buildings and are advantageous against enemies in brush. The transmigrators will need this capability in densely vegetated areas."

...

After Lin Shenhe's thorough briefing, the starry-eyed Executive Committee finally settled on a hybrid solution:

A small number of Russian-made AK semi-automatics chambered in 7.62mm NATO—the Saiga-308—as dedicated weapons for military personnel.

SKS semi-automatics using M43 rounds as militia weapons. Though the SKS had minor performance drawbacks, its ammunition was very cheap—unlike the expensive 7.62mm NATO. Economy was also a consideration.

Lin Shenhe's recommended SKS was the SKS-D variant, whose advantage was AK magazine compatibility—no longer limited to its 10-round internal magazine. Sustained firepower was greatly improved.

"As for handguns—the M9 is just for show. Better to choose Glock: cheap and plentiful; American police love them. Under $500."

Lin Shenhe pressed his advantage and changed the Committee's handgun choice to Glock. Though the M9 was handsome, Glock was equally stylish, so there was no strong opposition. However, the procurement ratio dropped from majority to minority. Automatic pistols would be issued only to specialized military personnel in limited numbers; most would use S&W revolvers. Revolvers were better suited to low-quality reloaded cartridges.

Lin Shenhe then made further suggestions: purchasing large quantities of Russian 4× optical scopes—essential if rifles were to achieve their 400-meter-plus capability. Also, a small number of high-magnification sniper scopes for designated marksmen.

"We should also purchase small quantities of various light weapons as blueprints for future reverse-engineering, or at least as reference."

Throughout this discussion, the Athletics Group—except for Xi Yazhou—maintained complete silence. But after the meeting, several requested a trip to the shooting club to fire an M-14 and experience full-power ammunition.

"Fine, arrange it." Wen Desi glanced at Xiao Zishan. "If they have that 308 thing, have everyone in Athletics fire it."

Getting money to America became another puzzle. These 200 rifles alone cost $100,000. Converting at a bank was obviously out. Fortunately, Wen Desi had recently opened several companies to cover money flows, one with import-export rights. They shipped several kilograms of gold by container under the guise of exporting electronics.

"Do you really trust Dr. Shi and Lin Shenhe?" Xiao Zishan once asked Wen Desi during an evening stroll on the parade ground.

"If I don't trust them, what choice do we have?" Director Wen countered. "Our weapons depend on them. There's no other option."

"True enough." Xiao Zishan fell silent.

"To be frank, our entire operation is built on mutual trust." Wen Desi took a deep breath. "If you and Engineer Wang hadn't trusted me, would you have gone through the wormhole with me? If these people didn't believe we had a wormhole, why would they be here? Even those who left—if we hadn't trusted their promise of secrecy..." His face went cold. "We should have..."

Xiao Zishan shuddered. "Choose your words carefully!"

"Mm." Director Wen nodded. "How's Xi Yazhou doing lately? Any morale problems?"

"None. Besides, his proposals weren't completely rejected. He and Lin Shenhe even went drinking—quite a crowd, lively atmosphere. Lin Shenhe has practical experience. Quite talented."

"What about the others in Athletics? Any opinions?"

"They think we're making mountains out of molehills." Xiao Zishan smiled ruefully. From chatter among his General Affairs family members, he could learn many people's thoughts. "In their view, having guns to use is good enough; everything else is overthinking. So they hold no particular opinions on which guns."

"That's good. Everyone's mood needs to stay stable. Honestly, everything is wonderful now—I'm just worried about after we cross..." Director Wen left the thought unfinished.

"Hold a weapon in your hands, and the urge to kill arises."

"Exactly. Especially when everyone has guns..."

"We'll need a system for managing firearms and ammunition?"

"Yes. At least in the long run."

"But that's really just a technical detail. Looking at the big picture, we need a complete political system. A political platform, code of conduct—that sort of thing." Xiao Zishan said.

"So we should have a complete framework... A constitution?"
