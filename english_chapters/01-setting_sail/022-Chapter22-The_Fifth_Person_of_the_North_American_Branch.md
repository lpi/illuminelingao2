# Chapter 22: The Fifth Member of the North American Branch

Shi Niaoren flew back to America the following day. The question of which weapons to purchase remained unresolved—too many opinions, no consensus—so the North American contingent advised waiting for their update before taking action. Weapons shouldn't sit in storage too long anyway; purchasing a few months before departure would suffice.

The discussions had left the Executive Committee thoroughly dissatisfied. Everyone walked away feeling something lodged in their throats, some half-formed objection they couldn't quite articulate. Every proposal had somehow failed to match anyone's vision. When it came to military weapons, though none of them had actually fired one, plenty knew enough to hold forth at length on the subject. But civilian versions were a complete blind spot for a group of urban shut-ins. They had no theoretical foundation to work from—essentially stumbling through darkness.

In the days that followed, Jiang Ye lobbied Committee members and Xi Yazhou relentlessly, pushing his all-in-one weapons plan: semi-automatic rifles supplemented by bolt-action Mosin-Nagants. Director Wen found himself tempted. He even researched the Type 38 Arisaka—that rifle with its long bayonet could form a truly magnificent pike formation. Alas, the Athletics Group showed no interest in continuing revolutionary traditions by working a bolt. Jiang Ye's efforts among the rank and file garnered little support either. People wanted weapons that could "spray." Whether automatic rifle or submachine gun didn't matter, but bolt-action was absolutely rejected. It simply offered no sense of security.

Then, unexpectedly, an overseas call arrived from Dr. Shi. Another person had joined the North American contingent and was preparing to fly over for weapons discussions. This one, Shi claimed, had fired even more types of guns than Xiao Rui, knew the North American civilian weapons market like the back of his hand, and had "fired artillery on the ground and flown Mustangs in the sky." Such exploits commanded respect, and most assumed their incoming visitor would be muscular and burly.

What they found waiting at the base was an elegant young man with a slightly slick appearance. Disappointment rippled through the group; people began doubting Dr. Shi's words.

The newcomer introduced himself as Lin Shenhe, a firearms enthusiast. Thanks to the decadent, backward U.S.A., he had spent years handling countless famous and obscure firearms, even participating in the construction of a Nordenfelt machine gun and a Napoleonic 12-pounder bronze cannon. The military buffs drooled. After hearing the Committee's firearms briefing, he smiled leisurely—a knowing expression that mystified everyone.

Xiao Zishan, watching that smile, was reminded of Tang Guoqiang playing Zhuge Liang on television. Unfortunately, no one was present to ask the classic question: "Why does the strategist smile?"

"None of you really understand the North American civilian weapons market, do you?" Lin Shenhe's voice was soft but carried perfectly. "Civilian weapons are actually quite different from their military counterparts, and performance varies considerably by manufacturer." He paused for effect. "Take the AR-15—everyone knows it's the civilian version of the M-16. But in reality, the various profiteers manufacturing civilian products in America are cunning; their wares are nothing like what American GIs actually carry. AR-15 barrels—even standard ones—often aren't chrome-lined.

"Or consider the M1A that Xi Yazhou recommended—Springfield Armory's civilian version of the M-14. Many enthusiasts love it. But its receiver is investment-cast, unlike the forged receivers found in military-contract M-14s. Ironically, Norinco's M-14s use forged receivers—just poor-quality forgings."

"So American profiteers use the U.S. military for advertising while pawning off shoddy goods on the hardworking American masses?"

"It's not exactly shoddy. The North American civilian gun market is enormous, serving demand across all income levels. That's quite different from military contracts. Some companies simplify production to reduce prices, while others manufacture expensive premium products. Take civilian M-14s—LRB Arms uses forged receivers and costs considerably more than Springfield. Essentially, anyone at any income level can find what they consider the best value for their money."

After Lin Shenhe's introduction, everyone realized just how complex the American civilian gun market truly was. They regarded him with newfound respect.

"So what's your weapon recommendation?"

"That depends entirely on Executive Committee requirements. Regarding semi-automatic selection, I agree with Team Leader Xi—given our operational environment, semi-automatics are optimal. With two hundred semi-auto rifles, we can handle any complex situation during the initial phase."

"We have no objections there. The problem is choosing which semi-automatic."

"For value, the SKS really is excellent. Retail runs about four hundred dollars; M43 ammunition is very cheap in North America—suitable for large-scale issue. And stock is plentiful."

"Didn't Xiao Rui say Mosin-Nagants are only eighty dollars each? Four hundred buys five of them!" The bolt-action faction persisted with dogged loyalty. "And the ammunition is even cheaper."

"Which of you has actually used a Mosin-Nagant?" Lin Shenhe wore his all-knowing smile. "Among bolt-actions, the Mosin has the hardest bolt to work—people joke that you need to kick it open. And bolt-action rifles require extensive practice before they develop any real combat effectiveness."

"You could choose others... like the Lee-Enfield."

"That's possible. But in my view, bolt-actions would be perfectly adequate as equipment for native troops later on. We transmigrators should be better equipped—for confidence, if nothing else."

"I still oppose Warsaw Pact weapons." Xi Yazhou held his ground. "Service life is too poor."

"That's not entirely true. Warsaw Pact weapons certainly include poor-quality examples—it depends on the manufacturer. On the North American civilian market, AK-series rifles from Russia's IZMASH and similar factories use cold-hammer-forged barrels with chrome-lined bores, rated for over eighty thousand rounds. Among AR-15s, only the HK416 uses cold-hammer-forged barrels. Bulgarian Arsenal-produced AKs claim barrel life of fifteen thousand rounds or more—that's straight from the U.S. distributor."

"Then let's bulk-buy AKs! We can convert them to full-auto!" The AK faction's voices rose in triumph.

"Still, I tend to agree with Xi Yazhou—we should have at least some semi-autos chambered in full-power cartridges." Lin Shenhe offered his endorsement unhurriedly. "Considering combat needs, Team Leader Xi's thinking is comprehensive. It's not merely about range—full-power rounds offer penetration against old-style buildings and prove advantageous against enemies concealed in brush. The transmigrators will need this capability in densely vegetated areas."

...

After Lin Shenhe's thorough briefing, the starry-eyed Executive Committee finally settled on a hybrid solution.

A small number of Russian-made AK semi-automatics chambered in 7.62mm NATO—the Saiga-308—would serve as dedicated weapons for military personnel.

SKS semi-automatics using M43 rounds would equip the militia. Though the SKS had minor performance drawbacks, its ammunition was remarkably cheap—unlike the expensive 7.62mm NATO. Economy remained a key consideration.

Lin Shenhe's recommended variant was the SKS-D, whose advantage lay in its AK magazine compatibility—no longer limited to the standard ten-round internal magazine. Sustained firepower improved dramatically.

"As for handguns—the M9 is just for show. Better to choose Glock: cheap, plentiful, and beloved by American police. Under five hundred dollars."

Lin Shenhe pressed his advantage and swayed the Committee's handgun choice to Glock. Though the M9 was handsome, Glock proved equally stylish, so opposition remained muted. However, the procurement ratio dropped from majority to minority. Automatic pistols would be issued only to specialized military personnel in limited numbers; most would carry S&W revolvers, better suited to low-quality reloaded cartridges.

Lin Shenhe then offered further suggestions: purchasing large quantities of Russian 4× optical scopes—essential if rifles were to achieve their four-hundred-meter-plus capability. Also, a small number of high-magnification sniper scopes for designated marksmen.

"We should also purchase small quantities of various light weapons as blueprints for future reverse-engineering, or at least as technical reference."

Throughout this discussion, the Athletics Group—except for Xi Yazhou—maintained complete silence. But after the meeting adjourned, several members requested a trip to the shooting club to fire an M-14 and experience full-power ammunition firsthand.

"Fine, arrange it." Wen Desi glanced at Xiao Zishan. "If they have that .308 thing, have everyone in Athletics fire it."

Getting money to America became another puzzle. These two hundred rifles alone would cost a hundred thousand dollars. Converting currency at a bank was obviously out of the question. Fortunately, Wen Desi had recently established several companies to cover money flows, one with import-export rights. They shipped several kilograms of gold by container under the guise of exporting electronics.

"Do you really trust Dr. Shi and Lin Shenhe?" Xiao Zishan asked Wen Desi one evening as they strolled across the parade ground.

"If I don't trust them, what choice do we have?" Director Wen countered. "Our weapons depend on them. There's simply no other option."

"True enough." Xiao Zishan fell silent.

"To be frank, our entire operation is built on mutual trust." Wen Desi drew a deep breath. "If you and Engineer Wang hadn't trusted me, would you have gone through the wormhole with me? If these people didn't believe we had a wormhole, why would they be here? Even those who left—if we hadn't trusted their promise of secrecy..." His expression went cold. "We should have..."

Xiao Zishan shuddered. "Choose your words carefully!"

"Mm." Director Wen nodded slowly. "How's Xi Yazhou doing lately? Any morale problems?"

"None. Besides, his proposals weren't completely rejected. He and Lin Shenhe even went out drinking together—quite a crowd, lively atmosphere. Lin Shenhe has genuine practical experience. Quite talented."

"What about the others in Athletics? Any strong opinions?"

"They think we're making mountains out of molehills." Xiao Zishan smiled ruefully. Through chatter among his General Affairs family members, he could gauge many people's thoughts. "In their view, having guns to use is good enough; everything else is overthinking. So they hold no particular opinions about which guns to buy."

"That's good. Everyone's mood needs to stay stable. Honestly, everything is wonderful now—I'm just worried about after we cross..." Director Wen left the thought unfinished.

"Hold a weapon in your hands, and the urge to kill arises."

"Exactly. Especially when everyone has guns..."

"We'll need a system for managing firearms and ammunition?"

"Yes. At least in the long run."

"But that's really just a technical detail." Xiao Zishan gazed into the darkness beyond the parade ground. "Looking at the bigger picture, we need a complete political system. A political platform, a code of conduct—that sort of thing."

"So we should establish a complete framework..." Director Wen's voice grew thoughtful. "A constitution?"
