# Chapter 10: The Secret House

Xiao Zishan and the others rose and returned the greeting. Their earlier wariness of people from another timespace had faded—these were living, breathing people, just like them. Gao Ju's conduct over several transactions had impressed them as a man of integrity, worth cultivating. After the crossing, he would be a great help.

After pleasantries, they got down to business. With their new hydraulic hand truck, they had hauled over four pallet loads—more than a hundred crates.

Xiao Zishan's promotional items were exhausted. This shipment had all been purchased wholesale: mirrors of various sizes, disposable lighters, frosted and spray-decorated glassware. Wen Desi, having done extensive research, discovered pearls fetched high prices in the late Ming; so they had also bought large quantities of cultured pearls.

The steward had men open sample crates and present them one by one. Master Gao had long been mentally prepared for rare goods with every visit, yet each new item still astonished him. The disposable lighters in particular captivated him—nothing rivaled their convenience for starting a fire.

Master Gao examined the Wenzhou-made lighter—by now, translucent plastic no longer amazed him. He flicked it several times, then stared at it in admiration: "This method of striking fire is no different from flint and steel, except oil replaces tinder and a wheel strikes the spark. Nothing within is rare; yet your craftsmen have combined such ingenuity into one small, exquisite object—truly unmatched."

Wen Desi and the others nodded: who said the ancients were ignorant? Master Gao had grasped the principle at a glance. Of course, the gasoline inside was something ancients couldn't produce, but he recognized the liquid was oil.

"However, this lighter cannot be refilled," Wen Desi explained. "Once empty, it's discarded."

"Is that so? A pity." Master Gao stopped flicking it. "Why can't it be refilled? To discard such a clever, practical thing seems a waste."

Wen Desi wondered how to explain disposability. Should he say everything in their timespace was disposable? That might scare him half to death. He hedged, saying craftsmen were working on improvements.

After the goods were handed over, the total came to over thirty thousand taels. Several full-length dressing mirrors nearly made Master Gao's eyes pop—even in the palace, such things would leave the Emperor slack-jawed.

The pearls also won Gao Ju's favor. Since troubles erupted in Liaodong, tribute pearls from the northeast had ceased; South Sea pearl harvests were meager. The market was desperately short.

Master Gao knew they liked gold; he exchanged a thousand taels' worth. Then he ordered porcelain from his storeroom—as much as would fit on the pallets, tightly bound with straw rope. Truthfully, he had no idea how these three managed to transport more cargo each visit. He dared not ask, but speculated whether they might know some teleportation sorcery.

Xiao Zishan gazed at the crates of gold and silver and felt dizzy. Thank goodness they'd bought the hydraulic truck—how else would they move nearly a ton of precious metal? While his mind wandered, Wen Desi inquired about the house-purchasing commission.

Gao Ju pondered, then said: "Normally this would be no trouble. But as overseas merchants, you are not permitted under Ming law to purchase property here. Of course, you are all Chinese descent; your speech and appearance are Chinese enough. Change your attire and you could quietly take up residence. Only—lately, with these rare goods on the market, I find myself under considerable scrutiny..."

At this, they understood: success attracts attention. With so many unprecedented goods suddenly appearing in Guangzhou, who knew how many eyes and ears were watching.

Their original plan to establish a foothold inside the city had fallen through. According to the crossing strategy: Guangzhou was to serve as the mainland trade gateway, exporting modern products manufactured at the Hainan base and importing materials and personnel. It would also be a window for observing Ming developments.

Seeing the disappointment on Wen Desi's party's faces, Gao Ju revealed his own proposal—one he had been considering. In his view, the Australian merchants wanted a house because they needed a stable location for long-term trade, a place to store goods and lodge personnel. This was the same motive as when the Portuguese bribed high officials to lease Macau—only smaller scale.

"However, I do have another idea..." Gao Ju stroked his sparse whiskers, looking at them inquiringly.

"Please enlighten us, Master Gao."

"What you gentlemen want is simply a place to stay in the city. I have a property here. If you do not find it beneath you, it is yours to use."

Gao Ju dismissed the maids and summoned two trusted servants. He slipped the keys into his sleeve and led the way. They passed through narrow alleys to the back courtyard. The air carried the ammonia smell of mules and horses—the stable yard. But Master Gao did not enter; instead, he circled a wall corner. At the end of the passageway was a small house. An elderly servant sat by the door; seeing the master, he hastily rose.

"Open the door."

The old servant produced a key and let them in. On the wall of the inner room was an iron-clad door. Unbolting it, they stepped out and found themselves outside the estate entirely. Before them lay an extremely secluded cobblestone path running along the base of the city wall. On one side was wasteland beneath the foundations; on the other, high rear walls of wealthy households. No one was about; weeds grew wild. They occasionally passed branching alleys.

"The alleys lead to the main road out front; their entrances all have wooden gates normally kept locked. Though this path is public land, ordinary people cannot get in."

After several hundred meters, they reached a rear wall so weathered it was nearly crumbling. Unlocking the door, they entered a small rear courtyard paved with blue stone slabs, planted with banana trees and flowers—very secluded. Proceeding inward, they found three connected courtyards, all kept clean, fully furnished.

"This is my secondary residence. Reserved for emergencies."

This was Master Gao's secret house. He had several such properties in and around Guangzhou. This one was meant as a place to hide in case of disaster.

The front gate did not open onto the street. What faced the street was a sundry-goods shop—outwardly an ordinary oil-and-salt store, but actually arranged by Master Gao. Beside the shop was an inconspicuous side door with an alley leading directly to the house—very convenient.

Servants were on hand; seeing the master bring guests, they hurried to boil water and serve tea.

"Those of us in the overseas trade must be exceedingly cautious!" Master Gao sighed. "Making a living is not easy."

Smuggling meant dealing with unsavory characters—pirates, river bandits, mountain brigands—all the kind who would kill for money. Kidnapping, extortion, murder, and robbery were not unusual.

Though they had backing in the prefectural, provincial, and capital governments, officials were greedy and made demands. Moreover, the court was inherently suspicious of overseas trade, and there were periodic proposals to ban Portuguese trade with Guangzhou. Local officials frequently used this threat to squeeze merchants.

"All that is still manageable. What troubles us most is the recent surge in pirates. Foreign and Chinese ships alike have suffered greatly, and our livelihoods have grown difficult."

Xiao Zishan thought this was a good opportunity to gather intelligence on piracy along the Guangdong-Fujian coast. He feigned ignorance:

"Sailing from Australia, we found the route quite peaceful."

"That is your good fortune." Master Gao smiled bitterly. "Compared to Fujian and Zhejiang, this area is relatively calm. Haicheng has been utterly devastated."

Since the second year of Tianqi, pirates along the Fujian-Guangdong coast had been recruiting followers and forming confederacies, declaring themselves kings. The most powerful were Yang Liu, Cai San, and Zhong Liu. In the sixth year of Tianqi, Fujian's Regional Commander Yu Zigao and the Guangdong naval forces mounted a joint suppression campaign; they pacified Yang Liu, while Cai San and Zhong Liu fled abroad. This temporarily curbed the pirates' momentum.

Yet before long, Zheng Zhilong, Zhong Lingxiu, Li Kuiqi, and other pirate fleets resumed raiding the Fujian-Zhejiang coast. Fujian suffered most severely; Yuegang in Haicheng County—China's largest export port since the Longqing opening—was left in ruins. Ships heading overseas, fearing pirate attacks, had dwindled greatly.

"Here in Guangzhou, things have been quiet since last year's joint campaign by Fujian's Commander Yu and our provincial navy. The Portuguese, because their interests lie in Macau, also patrol the river mouth."

So pirate activity was concentrated along the Fujian coast. This information boosted their confidence—at least initially, they wouldn't face BOSS-level figures like Zheng Zhilong or Li Kuiqi.

"Still, caution is best," Gao Ju reminded them: though Guangdong's coast had no major pirates, small pirate and bandit gangs were as numerous as hairs on an ox. They were strangers here; mooring and disembarking required particular care.
