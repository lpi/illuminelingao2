# Chapter 42: The Ship (Part 2)

"Won't be usable?!" Many faces showed disappointment. Was the glorious multi-turreted ironclad battleship-freighter just going to vanish like smoke?

"Why beach it?" someone objected. "Once a ship is beached, it's very hard to refloat. We don't have enough crew now and temporarily can't operate it—but that doesn't mean we won't be able to later."

"Cross over just to use it as a hotel? What a waste! Without an invincible warship, how can we fight pirates on the high seas?"

"With this ship, Zheng Zhilong, Liu Xiang, the Dutch, the English—all just trash!"

"Can we avoid beaching?" Wen Desi asked. "There are quite a few good harbors on Hainan's west coast. Lingao alone has several deep-water port development zones. The one called Jinpai Port, right? They even did investment promotion in Guangzhou. It should have plenty of deep-water berths."

"Not that simple."

Meng De knew everyone's understanding of shipping and port facilities was essentially zero. He offered some explanation first.

Before modern times, except for a very few ports with particularly favorable geographic and hydrographic conditions where large ships could dock directly alongside, in most of the world's ports, large vessels had to anchor in deeper water within the harbor. From there, lighters and small boats would transfer cargo and passengers ashore one load at a time. Well into modern times, many major ports still had dedicated ferries for passengers embarking and disembarking ocean liners, plus cargo lighters. This was extremely inefficient. Modern ports therefore built various dock facilities; even the simplest setup required several piers.

The Lingao area where the transmigrators planned to land was in Hainan's northern region. The ports of Qiongbei, from Mulantou in the east to Bingmajiao in the west, comprised a series of coastal segments curving inland—from east to west: Puqian Bay, Haikou Bay, Chengmai Bay, Dongshui Port, Huachang Port, Maniao Port, Hongpai Port, and Houshui Bay.

Along these bays, large and small ports were countless. But most were small natural harbors with only fishing boats. Though Ming-era Hainan was an important waypoint for Sino-foreign maritime trade—many merchant ships stopped for shelter and to replenish freshwater—its own maritime trade wasn't well developed, concentrating mainly at Shenying Port in Qiongshan. The bays within Lingao County almost all retained their primitive appearance.

"There won't be any port facilities in these Ming-era Hainan bays. Moreover, the ports of the Qiongbei region generally have shallow water. The Jinpai Port development zone Director Wen mentioned is actually Hongpai Port. Even after Phase 1 development and dredging, it only achieved the capability to berth 5,000-ton general cargo ships."

This speech caused murmuring. Many had assumed Hongpai was a natural deep-water port. Not so. The Hongpai Peninsula jutted northward into open sea. The cape's coastline was constantly eroded by wind and waves, forming sea cliffs and wave-cut platforms. Eroded lava debris was carried by currents to the peninsula's west side, forming a gravel beach. Finer sediment moved into Hongpai Port, making the inner bay a sand-deposit beach. The west side of the peninsula—Hongpai Islet—was a basalt wave-cut platform, with good water depths of five-plus meters at its leading edge. But Hongpai Port's interior, affected by longshore drift and silting, had only two to four meters' depth.

Originally, the Executive Committee had planned to use Jinpai Port—that is, Hongpai Port—for ship mooring. Meng De's explanation completely scotched their plan. With two to four meter depths, forget 10,000-ton ships—even 2,000–3,000-ton vessels would struggle.

"Moreover, the extensive beaches formed inside the harbor will make our unloading work very difficult."

"Among Lingao's ports, the best hydrographic conditions are in the Houshui Bay area. On both east and west sides of Linchang Island within the bay, deep channels of ten meters extend inward. The wave-shadow zone south of the island is a shallow sediment deposit, but still seven to eight meters deep. The shore is coral reef, strongly erosion-resistant, with little sediment source into the bay. The beach erosion and deposition have stabilized. Houshui Bay is arguably Lingao's best natural deep-water port. For the transmigrators, Houshui Bay has Linchang Island as a natural harbor barrier. Building fortifications there could effectively defend against seaborne attacks—far better than tiny reefs like Hongpai Islet."

This was what professionalism looked like! Whether an excellent military organization or an efficient production organization, proper division of labor—placing specialized personnel in appropriate work positions—was the foundation. The Executive Committee deeply appreciated this. A reverential atmosphere settled over the meeting room.

"Seems you can't just take things for granted in this world!" Ma Qianzhu sighed.

"Should we put our port base at Houshui Bay? Since conditions there are superior."

"No, that won't work." Wen Desi shook his head repeatedly. "Houshui Bay is excellent as a port, but unsuitable as a landing base—no water."

Lingao's Houshui Bay area in ancient times had no major natural rivers. It was one of the county's driest regions. Local villages had suffered from water shortages for ages—only after 1949 were deep wells drilled and irrigation channels dug to solve the problem.

Without sufficient freshwater, everything became inconvenient. And this location was also rather far from Lingao County town and the transmigrators' future main base—making transport and communication awkward.

"What's your recommendation?" The tone of the question had shifted from casual to respectful.

"Where will the future main base be?"

"Bairen Beach. In the lower reaches of the Wenlan River."

"If you want the closest option, Bopu Port." Meng De thought for a moment. "Bopu Port is essentially the Wenlan River's estuary—classified as a river-mouth port. It's long been a key transit point between Hainan and the mainland, and a natural typhoon shelter. The central deep channel reaches six to seven meters, but the harbor has many sandbars, and the anchorage is very small."

"That depth should be enough for a 10,000-ton ship, right? I believe the draft is around seven meters."

"Correct. Shallow-draft coastal general cargo ships can be even shallower. The problem is I don't have local hydrographic data—no, I mean I don't have *Ming-era* hydrographic data. And without either a pilot or proper engine-room crew—even with a modern port—we couldn't dock. In modern times, many ships are actually 'pushed' to the dock by tugboats. With my ship-handling level, if the ship enters harbor without beaching or running aground, that'd be incredible luck."

"A ship costs at least tens of millions. Spend tens of millions to build a Yamato Hotel?"

"Actually, my recommendation is to use barges. Flat-deck or open-hold barges would work." Meng De boldly proposed a completely un-glorious idea, universally despised by the group. But he ignored their expressions. At least in his professional domain, he hadn't found anyone who could challenge him—which greatly emboldened him. Even if he said something wrong, no one could shoot him down.

"Towed by tugboats? Aren't those river vessels?"

"I'm talking about maritime barges, generally used in coastal areas. Deadweight tonnage ranges from 1,500 to 8,500 tons. Some barges are self-propelled for short coastal voyages. These ships have very shallow drafts—a 1,500-tonner draws only two meters."

A typical self-propelled deck barge had specifications like:

- Actual payload: 1,500 tons
- Gross tonnage: 1,411 tons
- Net tonnage: 342 tons
- Length overall: 61 meters
- Beam: 13.6 meters
- Depth: 3.2 meters
- Draft: 1.832 meters
- Navigable area: Coastal waters
- Main engine power: 330 kW

They could carry all kinds of dry cargo and containers. Drawbacks: very slow, short range, poor seakeeping—only usable for short coastal freight. Of course, none of this mattered to the transmigrators.

But after comprehensive consideration, they decided to prioritize general cargo ships, with self-propelled barges only as backup if the budget fell short. The reason was simple: self-propelled barges had no cranes or loading equipment—entirely dependent on port equipment. For the transmigrators, manually unloading thousands of tons was basically a myth, not to mention items weighing tens or hundreds of tons that no amount of manpower could move. General cargo ships typically had derricks and various loading/unloading equipment.

"I have an idea." Zhao De of the Athletics Group had served in a naval district and was part of the transmigrators' future naval core, so he also attended this ship-selection meeting.

"Even if the cargo ship doesn't beach, using a freighter as a warship is completely impractical." Zhao De brushed dust off his sleeve. "Large cargo ships have deep drafts, complex handling, and their turning isn't necessarily faster than sailing ships. No matter how powerful the ship, will opponents keep coming for head-on battles after taking one beating? They have numerical advantage—they can conduct harassment warfare along shipping lanes and coasts. When combat starts, we'll be overwhelmed. Even if we go out and sink a few, the rest scatter into shallow water—what can you do? Lower lifeboats to chase them? We need sea control. A single, isolated ship that guzzles fuel and manpower—too wasteful."

The glorious multi-turreted ironclad battleship-freighter had been criticized. Everyone felt pained, but thinking about it, this former naval officer wasn't wrong.

"I'm a fisherman myself. Back in the production brigade, I captained fishing boats. During my service, I saw the navy also used fishing boats—200 to 400-ton vessels with long range and seaworthiness. Wouldn't they be better as the core of the crossing navy than some ironclad multi-turreted battleship-freighter? Speed alone is much faster, and fuel consumption is lower."

"And you can fish!"

"Right, you can still fish. These are generally trawlers—very durable."

"Fishing boats aren't easy to buy." Meng De objected. "Fishery bureau paperwork is too complicated."

"No problem—after we buy them, we just don't register for fishery use. Once we cross over, we can do whatever we want with them."

Opinions in the Executive Committee diverged on this—some felt it unnecessarily complicated the operation. But the majority expressed support. The Hainan where the transmigrators would develop their base had extremely rich surrounding fishery resources—the Beibu Gulf remains an important fishing ground to this day, with annual fishing disputes between Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen. In the seventeenth century, it would surely be even richer. Having one or more fishing boats would enrich the transmigrators' protein sources. Modern fishing boats were nimble, agile, and easy to operate—perfect for the transmigrators' early near-shore naval force. After all, the narrowest point of the Qiongzhou Strait was under 18 kilometers—even very small boats could easily cross. Without vessels for early warning at sea, enemies might only be spotted when they entered visual range from shore—extremely passive.

So the plan was decided. Zhao De was tasked with fishing-boat selection and preparing related spare-parts and materials procurement lists. After the meeting, at Meng De's suggestion, a batch of transmigrators with good physical condition and some interest in sailing were selected for training. Meng De, using his work connections, found a friend whose family operated several coastal cargo ships and sent people aboard for one-on-one practical skill training.
