# Chapter 11: Kraak Porcelain (Part Two)

After Wen Desi sold the gold—its purity was lacking—he netted roughly 270,000 yuan. He then found a small smelting plant to recast the silver into standard 925 industrial silver, which fetched another 200,000 yuan.

The several hampers of porcelain couldn't stay in the hotel room. But hauling them all at once would raise questions about how such goods had suddenly appeared. So they stayed on a few extra days, taking turns carrying pieces out in travel bags.

They counted: two hundred pieces total, mostly plates of various sizes, plus bowls and vases. They knew it was Kraak porcelain, but they were all antiques laymen.

Wen Desi recalled meeting a Professor Ma at some past dinner—he taught history at a local university and dabbled in antiques with a modest reputation in collecting circles. After much rummaging through his business-card holder, he found the number and arranged lunch.

"That's right, this is Kraak porcelain," Professor Ma examined the plate. "Typical export ware. Wide rims, predominantly blue-and-white, with compartments and circular medallions decorated with landscapes, figures, flowers, and fruit."

Wen Desi adopted an attitude of humble receptiveness.

"Kraak porcelain divides by period into Wanli and Kangxi. This is Wanli. You can tell by the circles in the pattern—drawn with two strokes joined together. Characteristic of late-Ming to early-Qing brushwork."

*This is actually from the Tianqi reign*, Wen Desi thought.

"So this plate is quite valuable?"

"Don't think of money the moment you hear 'antique.'" Professor Ma's expression turned disdainful. "Cultural relics matter mainly for their historical significance."

He turned the plate over and over, reluctant to put it down. Then he frowned. "This plate still has its kiln fire—it hasn't been properly aged. Could it be a high-quality replica? Where did you get it?"

Wen Desi could hardly say he'd brought it fresh from the kiln in another timespace. "I was in the countryside on business and saw a villager with a stall. The patterns were unusual, so I picked up a few pieces."

"Good eye." Professor Ma nodded. "Kraak porcelain was actually made-to-order. The decorative patterns catered to European tastes—some were painted directly from European designs."

"So it should be genuine?" Wen Desi affected eager curiosity.

"Should be." Professor Ma pondered. "However, this type isn't abundant in China. Most pieces on the market were salvaged from the sea. But this plate has clearly never been submerged."

"If it's real, what's the market rate?"

"The ceramics market is complex, and it's been cool lately. But Kraak porcelain is hot—highest transaction rate among ceramics—though individual pieces aren't enormously valuable. A plate like this could sell for three to four thousand yuan."

"Not bad." Wen Desi adopted the smug air of a bargain-hunter.

"The problem is authenticity remains unclear," Professor Ma leaned back, a subtle smile behind his glasses. "Everything checks out except that kiln fire. Normally there aren't many high-quality Kraak fakes; I've never heard of any mines being planted."

Wen Desi put on an anxious expression. "Professor Ma, can you tell me whether it's real or not?"

Professor Ma thought for a moment. "I have a friend who specializes in porcelain collecting—an expert. I'll give you his number. Let him look. If it's genuine, he'll want it."

The expert was also surnamed Ma, though unrelated. A big name in collecting circles. The moment Wen Desi showed him the goods, Expert Ma wanted all two hundred pieces. He strongly suspected Wen Desi had unearthed a porcelain trove in Fujian. Not only were the pieces in excellent condition, but the implication was clear: more where those came from. Kraak porcelain, moderately priced, sold easily. A stable supply was exactly what he wanted. Keep bringing more.

After selling gold, silver, and porcelain, this first trip netted roughly three million yuan. With this seed capital, the Executive Committee began taking further action.

Continuing to rent hotel rooms was impractical. Wen Desi decided to set up a company. For 20,000 yuan, he had full paperwork processed and a trading company was born. Xiao Zishan had been informed his labor contract wouldn't be renewed. He simply went full-time as Administrative Manager. Wen Desi also wanted to resign, but his company was busy and his supervisor had treated him fairly—he couldn't just walk out. After much negotiation, he arranged to leave in three months. Wang Luobin was more casual: resignation letter submitted, straight to Guangzhou, where he joined a small machinery factory as a worker, saying he wanted to "get familiar with the craft."

The new company had nothing to its name. Fortunately, Xiao Zishan had spent years in Guangzhou building connections. Money in hand made everything easier. For an office, they rented a long-term business suite in the same hotel—self-contained with a private entrance bypassing the lobby, quiet, underground parking. Very convenient. Xiao Zishan designated a small storage room as the wormhole crossing point and installed a security door. For bulk cargo transport, he purchased a hydraulic hand truck.

On the matter of a company vehicle, the Executive Committee had its first disagreement. Xiao Zishan favored a seven-seat minivan like the Changan Star—cheap, carried many people, hauled cargo, fuel-efficient. Wang Luobin argued that since they were ultimately headed to the seventeenth century, such a vehicle couldn't be used there. The Ming dynasty had no gasoline, and the roads weren't suited for small cars. He proposed a four-wheel-drive diesel SUV—diesel substitutes being comparatively easy to obtain.

After hours of discussion, the Executive Committee decided on an SUV. The car saleswoman was puzzled by their choice: they rejected the more fuel-efficient fuel-injected models and bought an older Cherokee Jeep—four-wheel drive, manual transmission, diesel engine, self-recovery winch.

They had the car. They had a revenue channel. What next? The three Executive Committee members sat around the conference table, discussing the next phase.
