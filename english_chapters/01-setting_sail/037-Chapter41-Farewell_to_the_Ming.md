# Chapter 41: Farewell to the Ming (For Now)

"Amsterdam... no, Guangzhou—I'll be back." Xiao Zishan stood in the courtyard, gazing at the distant blue sky above the Lingnan First Building on Slope Mountain—its red sandstone structure with double-eaved hip-and-gable roof. Oh wait, it wasn't an ancient building. He smiled to himself. "It's a *modern* building."

This residence with its blue-brick paving, white walls, and black tiles was full of Lingnan flavor. Xiao Zishan remembered that in the twenty-first century, this should be Huifu Road—a street of cheap, excellent eateries, including some famous establishments operating for decades. He'd eaten "Yinji" rice noodle rolls and "Chengji" congee there... But in this timespace, it was quite a desolate place. Though houses could be seen, they were interspersed with abandoned gardens, even farmland and vegetable plots. Scattered woods and small ponds appeared everywhere.

Xiao Zishan had been familiar with such scenes since childhood. The southern city he'd grown up in resembled this. Traditional Chinese cities had fields and wasteland within city walls. Even into the 1960s and '70s, some areas still had villages inside cities—within urban districts, there were large tracts of farmland and village homes, even organized as production brigades.

This place had been selected as the transmigrators' future Guangzhou stronghold. The Haopan Street location would now serve only as a trading post, with the new residence as a backup base.

The new property was purchased with Gao Ju's money, but the location was found by Sun Chang—Xiao Zishan was increasingly fond of this young man. He worked efficiently and had a knack for understanding the transmigrators' thinking.

The property occupied higher ground than the surroundings, had an irregular shape, and was bordered by water on two sides. Its original owner had built a small residence and created a garden on the remaining land. Now, after changing hands multiple times, both house and garden had fallen into ruins—a wasteland of rubble and thorns. Only a pond of clear water, half a rockery, a few large trees, and a pavilion not yet completely collapsed hinted at its former glory.

Of all the properties Sun Chang found, this was the most dilapidated and cheapest—the buildings needed almost complete renovation. But it was quiet and secluded, with plenty of room for expansion. They decided to buy it immediately.

The renovation plan was entirely designed by the transmigrators' architectural team. The concept: modernize the interior while preserving the overall Ming-era appearance, to meet the transmigrators' future needs for a Guangzhou base.

In the Executive Committee's plans, this location would serve as the transmigrators' trade, intelligence, and communications center along the Guangdong coast.

The architects preserved the original residence's structural appearance, with comprehensive repairs and reinforcement. This section would be for dealing with locals.

Part of the ruined garden near the residence would be restored as a garden. The rest of the space was allocated for modern facilities: planned offices, dormitories, monitoring room, telegraph room, warehouse, and vault. Of course, all these buildings would have traditional courtyard exteriors, but internal facilities and structure would follow modern principles for maximum space efficiency.

Installing security equipment and communications devices meant dealing with electricity. Wind power wouldn't work inside the city—limited wind aside, the tall frames would be too conspicuous. Solar power was too inefficient. Though the Committee hadn't yet found a safe way to get a generator into the Guangzhou base, they prepared to build an underground, soundproofed generator room—better safe than sorry.

The garden and residence had wells. After testing, they were mostly acceptable. Hiring local well-cleaners for a deep cleaning would make them usable for daily needs; drinking water would require purification.

Though for quite some time this Guangzhou base would have neither electricity nor running water, construction would include pre-cut channels for future equipment and wiring.

For defense: the small waterways and pond on the northwest sides would be dredged and the banks reinforced. The crumbling walls were uniformly raised to 6 meters—in wealthy households' back courtyards, walls could reach 8 to 9 meters. Climbing roses were planted on the walls—their dense thorns also served as anti-theft measures.

But all this currently existed only on the designer's computer. Funds weren't abundant; excessive investment in a non-urgent project wasn't advisable. The wormhole's energy was about to dissipate. To preserve the last energy, crossing trade would stop after this trip. The transmigrators who had been active in the Ming timespace for several months would all withdraw until the final crossing operation.

Thus the ambitious construction plan had only been partially implemented. Sun Chang had hired bricklayers who were repairing the residence and surrounding walls. Watching the workers busily carrying bricks and mixing mortar, Xiao Zishan felt a pang of reluctance—who knew how long before he could return here.

After the official crossing, they would no longer be harmless Australian merchants selling novel goods for profit. They would be a political force with their own banner, plotting rebellion. As an Executive Committee member, he probably wouldn't be sent back to Guangzhou under enemy control. How long before the transmigrators' flag could fly over the Lingnan First Building?

While musing, he saw Wen Desi enter with a beaming face. This past week, Xiao Zishan had been supervising the new residence while Director Wen and Engineer Wang handled the crossing trade.

"Zishan, still supervising?"

"Director Wen, why are you here? You should be keeping a low profile lately."

"No worries—I've got Qiwei escorts with me, plus my protective charms..."

"Hehe, the same old three: spray, knife, stab-vest?"

"No—I learned from last time. Added a simple gas mask." Director Wen patted his bulging waist. He had just visited Gao Ju and spun Yu Eshui's vague prophecy with appropriately mystical flourishes.

"What was Gao Ju's expression?"

"Hard to describe!" Wen Desi thought. "Like he'd just eaten a dozen sour olives! But when he learned we'd leave the goods on credit before departing, he was so moved he almost cried..."

Both burst out laughing.

Considering that for a long time after the crossing, the transmigrators wouldn't be able to easily produce large quantities of "Australian goods" as they did now, they'd decided after discussion to leave Gao Ju a large consignment on credit. Gao Ju was moved nearly to tears—the goods were worth 200,000 taels! For the Executive Committee, this credit arrangement actually carried little risk—in RMB terms, it was only about 30,000. It wouldn't affect their funds on this side.

"So he paid quite a bit too?"

"Two thousand taels of gold. Plus many items we hadn't dared sell before—since this is the last time, sell and run." Wen Desi stopped laughing. "This is our last income before the crossing."

"Is it enough?"

"We've calculated several times. Not counting this income, current reserves are already sufficient—with a two-million-yuan cushion for emergencies."

"Someone will want something new by then."

"If it's not enough, we won't buy it. Everything essential has been budgeted. Anything additional is just icing on the cake."

"I just worry we've overlooked something critical. We're going to rebuild an entire industrial system. Can't afford to drop the ball at a crucial moment." Xiao Zishan remained the pessimist.

"Let's not talk about depressing things. Let's sort out matters here." Wen Desi said.

Back in the newly repaired room, Sun Chang stood waiting with an account book. He had effectively become the steward. Entrusting such a large estate to someone they'd known less than three months—in modern times, no one would do it. But here and now, the transmigrators had no choice but to trust.

"Sun Chang, we're returning to Australia this time. We won't be back until next year. Guard the residence well and don't cause trouble. Consult Manager Sun if anything comes up. For difficult matters, you may also seek Master Gao Ju's advice—I've spoken to him, and he'll see you."

"Yes. May I ask where I should meet the masters on your return?"

"No need. We'll send someone to contact you when we arrive." Wen Desi took out an aluminum commemorative medal sawn in half, giving one piece to Sun Chang. "When the time comes, use this as proof—you may follow that person's instructions."

"Yes. There's another matter I'd like guidance on."

"What is it?"

"This estate is so large—I alone may not be able to manage it well. Could the masters please buy one or two more household servants?"

"No need. After we leave, Gao Qing's family will move here. Gao Di is already studying with your martial uncle—teach him well in daily matters. Don't let him grow up useless like his father.

"All household income and expenses are under your management. Gao Di will keep accounts. Gao Qing's family has set stipends and monthly rice—just distribute according to schedule. Your monthly salary is two taels, half a *shi* of rice per month."

"Understood."

"Though I say don't cause trouble, that doesn't mean you should be a shut-in at home!"

"?" Sun Chang looked confused.

Wen Desi realized his slip but didn't correct it. He continued with a stern face: "Go out and about. Gather information. Report when we return."

"Yes."

"Wait patiently. We'll be back."

The day after the transmigrators left, Gao Qing's family was packing to move to the Australian masters' new residence. Steward Yan called for Gao Qing by the gate again.

Hearing the voice, Gao Qing was about to go out when his wife exploded:

"Go! Go on—go fawn over them! We came first, yet Sun Chang who came later got freed and became steward, while you—first in the door, still just a handyman!"

Gao Qing stood silently, still seeming inclined to go out.

Gao Xian broke into crying and shouting: "Marrying a useless wretch like you cursed me for eight lifetimes! Don't you have any sense? What has the Gao family ever given us? How have Master Wen and the others treated us? And you want to sell them out—for nothing!"

"Master Wen is still a foreigner... in the future..."

"So what if he's a foreigner? If they treat us well, I'd follow them to the ends of the earth! You just keep selling out—stay with the Gao family as their good slave!"

Their two children watched their mother rage, saying nothing. Both were old enough to understand that their parents had different ideas, but emotionally they preferred the Australian masters—so pleasant to speak with, always giving them good food and fun Australian trinkets. Their hearts naturally sided with their mother.

Gao Qing hung his head in silence. Seizing the chance, Gao Xian had already stepped out, smiling broadly at Steward Yan: "What bad timing—my husband went to the other residence early this morning to tidy up. I'm just packing with the children. Once we're done, we'll head over. Is there something? Should I have him come see you tomorrow?"

Steward Yan knew she was lying but couldn't do anything about it. He left sheepishly, muttering to himself: *These damn overseas foreign merchants really know how to sweet-talk people! Just a few days, and every one of them is now fiercely loyal!*
