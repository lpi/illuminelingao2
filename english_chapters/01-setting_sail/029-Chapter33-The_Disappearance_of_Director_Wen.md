# Chapter 33: The Disappearance of Director Wen

"My head's so heavy..." Xiao Zishan awoke from sleep feeling dizzy and extremely uncomfortable. These past few days he had been sleeping well—Ming-era Guangzhou had not only fresh air but no early-morning roar of cars. Sleep had been remarkably sweet.

Earlier, during their crossing trades, everyone had been too nervous to spend the night in the Ming dynasty. Before nightfall they would always leave, preferring to return another day. But now, as their business and connections grew more established, the work to be done on the Ming side increased daily. To extend the wormhole's lifespan, staying a few days after crossing had become routine. Moreover, these days they could live decadently with servants attending to their every need—there was almost a feeling of never wanting to leave.

But today his head was terribly heavy. He forced his eyes open; beyond the gauze window after the rain, bright sunshine flooded in. It looked close to ten o'clock. He felt puzzled—in this era with no TV or internet, even when everyone discussed and chatted together, they went to bed early, so each morning they naturally woke around seven. Why so late today?

He sat up and surveyed the room—and was shocked. The room was a chaotic mess; nearly every drawer and cabinet had been opened; things were strewn all over the floor.

*Robbed!*

The thought flashed immediately. He grew anxious—the cash and goods from this trade were still piled in the room! If... He hardly dared think about it. He hurried to dress and put on shoes—and suddenly realized his socks and hiking boots were missing! They'd really been robbed! There were some woven straw slippers in the room; he quickly put them on, threw on his clothes, and hurried out.

The moment he stepped outside, he saw Beiwei rushing out of his room. Xiao Zishan noticed Beiwei was also wearing straw slippers—his combat boots were gone!

"Something happened!" Beiwei said, succinct and to the point.

"What happened?"

"Director Wen is missing!"

"What!" This left Xiao Zishan's hands and feet ice-cold. Director Wen missing! This wasn't twenty-first-century Guangzhou where Director Wen knew people everywhere and there was "China's safest city" police—in seventeenth-century Guangzhou, beyond these walls, they didn't know a single person. They didn't even know which way to go.

The two ran frantically from room to room. Engineer Wang was still fast asleep. At the servants' quarters in the third courtyard, Gao Qing's family and Sun Chang were also in deep slumber. They woke everyone up—all were dizzy and nauseous. Gao Lujie and Gao Di wouldn't wake no matter how they called and shook them. While they fumbled about, Sun Chang suggested washing faces with cold water.

"Master Xiao, something's very wrong." Sun Chang watched as Gao Qing's family scrambled to bring water. Only after washing did everyone begin to feel slightly clearer.

"What?!"

"This is clearly knockout incense poisoning."

"Knockout incense?" For some reason, the first image that popped into Xiao Zishan's mind was Sun Erniang from *Water Margin*.

"Yes, knockout incense." Sun Chang had wandered from his famine-stricken hometown to Guangzhou, begging along the way. He had seen much of the *jianghu* underworld. "Are the masters missing anything?"

This reminder sent both of them sprinting to the west chamber of the middle courtyard. This room served as their main warehouse and crossing point; the Executive Committee had made some non-period modifications here—bricking up windows and extra doors, and creating a fortified inner chamber within using barbed-wire-wrapped steel fencing and a security door. Xiao Zishan saw that the padlock on the outer wooden door was missing; his heart sank. He pushed the door open—the steel grating and security door were intact; a full cartload of goods was still neatly stacked. He exhaled in relief.

It seemed the thieves hadn't succeeded. Twenty-first-century security measures still worked. The problem was they had lost Director Wen! That was far worse than losing goods or money. Money could be earned back, but losing a living person in the Ming Dynasty—that was another matter entirely.

"Who could have taken Director Wen?" Xiao Zishan's mind raced like a windmill. Was this a random incident or premeditated? Hard to say. If premeditated, only the Gao household knew they were here; otherwise they had no other contact with the entire city. What would Gao household people gain from kidnapping Director Wen? If random, could some master thief have broken in for valuables, failed, and simply taken Director Wen hostage? That was also possible.

The three searched Director Wen's room repeatedly but found nothing conclusive. His clothes, shoes, and hat were all gone—and his stab-resistant vest he always wore on crossings, his pepper spray, his stun gun, were all missing too.

After looking for a while, Xiao Zishan couldn't help saying:

"Old Bei, see anything? Aren't you a recon soldier?"

Beiwei spread his hands: "I'm a recon soldier, not a detective. We need someone from criminal investigation."

"Let's find someone in criminal investigation. Ran Yao used to be a police officer." Xiao Zishan remembered.

"Get him over here quickly. And those mystery buffs who haunt the mystery-novel forums—bring a few of them too." Engineer Wang saw Gao Xian about to come in and clean up. He immediately shouted: "Don't move! Preserve the scene!" Gao Xian fled in fright.

After discussion: Engineer Wang would first take the goods and money back through the crossing and report to the Executive Committee, then summon some professionals to examine traces. Xiao Zishan and Beiwei would stay here to investigate.

Xiao Zishan called Gao Qing's family and Sun Chang over, questioning them about anything unusual that had happened recently, including at the Gao mansion. After much questioning, he learned only from Sun Chang that: recently a "Young Eunuch Yang" from Beijing was coming to visit Master Gao, and Master Gao seemed to have something on his mind.

Gao Qing learned of this and became even more worried; he retreated to the front courtyard to sweep. Sun Chang remained calmer; he came forward to report: "There's no need to panic yet. If the thieves have kidnapped Master Wen, they'll surely send a letter. At that time, whether to report to officials or pay ransom, the masters can decide."

"Report to officials?" Xiao Zishan smiled bitterly. They were all "illegal entrants"—how could they involve Ming Dynasty authorities? Besides, he knew ancient law-enforcement mentality: unless it was armed murder or arson in broad daylight, the officials couldn't be bothered—unless heavily bribed. In that case, they might as well just pay the ransom.

"Yes," Sun Chang said quietly. "The masters are not Ming subjects and shouldn't appear publicly. But you could ask Master Gao to handle it and have the officials deal with it quietly." He glanced at Xiao Zishan. "Master Gao's word carries weight in the Prefecture and both counties."

"Mm." Xiao Zishan was noncommittal, but suspicion rose in his heart. Before Sun Chang arrived, everything had been normal; he'd been here a few days and Director Wen vanished...

As he was pondering, Beiwei walked in. Sun Chang quickly withdrew.

"Found traces!"

"Oh? Where?" Xiao Zishan perked up.

"The group came in by climbing the wall from the small lane behind the third courtyard. They knocked off a lot of tiles from the wall coping—they're scattered on the ground. There are also friction marks on the wall."

"And they left the same way?"

"Yes, they went back the way they came. I checked other spots—no wall-climbing marks elsewhere."

"I recall Master Gao saying the back lanes are all locked at the intersections with wooden gates—ordinary people can't get in."

"I don't think they came from there," Beiwei said. "The front entrance uses main roads—too conspicuous. If I were doing this, I'd come over the city wall."

"The city wall?"

"Yes. The back courtyards of all these houses abut the city wall." Beiwei nodded. "Though there are no ramps up or down, the wall is virtually deserted during normal times. Once you're up there, it's like a highway circling the entire city."

"Right, right—that's very possible!"

"The other day when someone tried to sneak in and eavesdrop, I threw a rock. That person ran off toward the city wall. I think it's probably the same group."

"So it was premeditated. But who would do this?"

"That I don't know. Anyway, we need to get Director Wen back first. We'll decide after the professionals come to look."

"Right. We should also notify Gao Ju and ask him to help look. He is the local strongman after all—he knows people."

"Could Gao Ju be involved?"

"Probably not—what good would kidnapping Director Wen do him?"

"Can't rule it out though. Let me check around again. Damn, my knife is gone too!" Beiwei fumed. He had paid good money for that blade on a sword-collecting website—now it, along with his 3515-brand '02 combat boots, had vanished.

Xiao Zishan sat in the study, repeatedly thinking through the cause and effect. No matter how he analyzed it, Master Gao was the prime suspect—after all, only he knew they lived here. But what was the motive? Xiao Zishan firmly believed everything in this world had a motive. What did Gao Ju hope to gain? Extorting money? He was already making good money from their trade. That didn't add up. Perhaps he wanted to use Director Wen as a hostage to guarantee exclusive monopoly on all Australian goods going forward—that was possible. But then there was no need for such elaborate measures—wall-climbing, knockout incense...

Wall-climbing, knockout incense...

When you got down to it, this was the work of *jianghu* underworld figures!

Xiao Zishan began to understand. He called Sun Chang in.

"Are you familiar with the street gangs and underworld rats of Guangzhou?"

"No," Sun Chang reported. "I'm not a local, and I'm not Cantonese. Besides, I've always worked in the Gao mansion; the Gao family scrutinizes the backgrounds of all household servants very strictly. Anyone connected with unsavory elements is never hired."

Xiao Zishan nodded. This statement largely cleared Sun Chang of suspicion. Sun Chang hesitated a moment, seeming to have more to say. Xiao Zishan said: "If you have something to say, say it. I believe in trusting those I employ and employing those I trust."

"Yes!" Encouraged, Sun Chang spoke up. "I have an idea."

"Go ahead."

"In Nanhai County, there's an escort agency called the Qiwei Escort Bureau." Sun Chang said. "It's a small bureau; their routes aren't long. But they have a specialty: 'store-sitting.'"

"Store-sitting?"

"Yes. The masters may not know: shopkeepers are often harassed and extorted by street thugs, so they hire escort guards to sit in the shop and keep order."

"So, like security guards." Xiao Zishan understood.

Sun Chang didn't know what "security guards" meant, so he just said "yes" and continued:

"Escort guards who sit in shops know the street thugs and lowlifes very well. If we ask for their help, they can definitely find out information. If this was just ordinary underworld rats, they might even be able to rescue the person."

---

*Note: "Store-sitting" as an escort-bureau service is documented only in Qing-dynasty Beijing; I haven't found records of it elsewhere. Also, the escort-bureau industry generally appears only in the Kangxi period of the Qing. My view is that given the commercial economy of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, similar trades or organizations must have existed—but since I couldn't find documentation, I've used Qing-era sources.*
