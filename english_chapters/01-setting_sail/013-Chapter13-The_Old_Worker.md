# Chapter 13: The Old Worker

"Zishan, I see you've got the makings of a landlord." Wen Desi chuckled. "Some people have the air of a true king; you have the presence of a landed gentleman."

"Maybe it runs in my family. My dream has always been a big estate—plant vegetables, raise chickens, put up a grape trellis, set a rattan chair underneath, and slowly sip tea..."

"Sounds delightful. But couldn't you do that now?" Wen Desi drawled. "We've made a lot of money. That little dream is nothing."

"Too bad the wormhole won't last forever." Xiao Zishan stretched. "This time I felt distinct energy fluctuations."

"If only it were Doraemon's Anywhere Door." Director Wen laughed.

Xiao Zishan grinned: "I wasn't finished. There would also be several cool beauties at my side, fanning me and peeling lychees. One mature woman, one imperious elder-sister type, one little *loli*..." He thought a moment. "Actually, that loli Gao Lujie is fine stock."

"That girl," Wen Desi lounged on the sofa, peeling a lychee, "is definitely not Gao Qing's daughter."

"Mm, significant DNA discrepancy." Xiao Zishan began cataloging the porcelain. After each crossing, he handled inventory. Engineer Wang had returned to his machinery factory—his enthusiasm lately was astounding. Not only did he work overtime every day, he came back still brimming with excitement.

"Her appearance has none of her father's features. Slight resemblance to her brother. And that height."

"So Director Wen has taken a fancy to this long-legged little *loli*?"

"Even if I have, I'll have to set it aside. Too much real work. Let's see what needs doing."

"Recruitment, of course."

After the third crossing-trade, they now controlled over twenty million yuan. The conditions for material preparation had been met.

To recruit, the first task was selecting an appropriate staging point—a facility to receive those who would report in. Guangzhou was clearly not suitable. The location should be relatively remote, close to the future crossing point, with sufficient living facilities for several hundred people, plus a large outdoor space—ideally a drill ground.

"What do we need a drill ground for?" Xiao Zishan was puzzled.

"Physical exercise." Wen Desi glanced at his own arms and Xiao Zishan's belly. "At the very least, if we have to run for our lives, we should outrun the Ming's natives."

They split up three ways. Since Xiao Zishan had worked in sales and knew the coastal cities of Guangdong, scouting fell to him. Wang Luobin would continue at his machinery factory. Wen Desi would remain in Guangzhou to prepare for the next crossing-trade, manage the online board, and identify talent. The first list of invitees was already drafted.

The fourth person to join the committee did not come from the internet—somewhat unexpectedly.

That evening, Wen Desi had just finished checking the board when Wang Luobin walked in, wearing an oil-stained uniform. He plopped onto the sofa, face beaming.

"Engineer Wang, you've been coming to work beaming every day. What's the good news?" Wen Desi was curious.

"Director Wen, I want you to meet someone."

"Who?" Wen Desi was surprised. Wang was normally taciturn; he wasn't local either. Why suddenly introduce someone?

"My boss." Seeing Wen Desi's confusion, he added: "The boss of the factory where I work. Surname Zhan."

"Hm?"

"I told him about the crossing—"

"What?!" Wen Desi nearly jumped up.

"Old Wen, don't get excited." Wang Luobin said. "His name is Zhan Wuya. He's a technician, very skilled—lathe, planing, milling, drilling—he knows it all..."

"All right, get to the point. He didn't think you were mentally ill or a con artist?"

"No—in fact, he wants to join."

"Join?" Wen Desi's mind didn't quite register. "He wants to go too?"

"Right. That day when we were working together on a hand-cranked Gatling gun—"

"What?!" This time Wen Desi really did jump up. "Engineer Wang!!"

He quickly lowered his voice—even though the room's soundproofing was excellent.

"Are you insane! Manufacturing illegal guns is a prison sentence!"

"It's fine—we'll have to make guns in the Ming anyway. Might as well practice." Wang Luobin looked utterly nonchalant. "We're machinists. Making a couple of guns is nothing. Someone's even knocked off a Japanese Type 92 infantry gun."

"Forget the Type 92—what's the deal with this boss of yours?"

"He's very impressed with your approach. Says to leave machining to him. He's planning to bring his whole factory over."

Zhan Wuya was not the grimy old worker Wen Desi had imagined. He appeared just over thirty, wearing a T-shirt, hair neatly combed. Only his large, rough hands revealed his occupation.

Because of his work, Director Wen often dealt with small processing shops like this. The two quickly launched into a deep discussion of machining, and their common ground broke down barriers. Before long, they were chatting freely.

"Director Wen, let me put it this way: in machining, there's nothing we can't make." Zhan Wuya's speech was full of working-class pride. "Take my little factory—I won't claim we can make tanks, but mortars and machine guns are a piece of cake. When I was at trade school..."

He launched into a five-minute account of building a mortar for his graduation project. Then he and Wang Luobin dove into discussing gun-making—it later emerged that they had bonded so quickly because both were fanatical firearms enthusiasts. Wen Desi hastily cut off their animated discussion before anyone might think they were an illegal-weapons gang.

Zhan Wuya introduced his factory's main equipment: two shearing machines, one 80-ton bending machine, one 63-ton punch and one 5-ton punch, two lathes, one planer, one radial drilling press, three bench drills, one cutter, five arc welders, one spot welder, one band saw, one overhead crane, one grinder, two grinding wheels, one oxy-fuel welding set, one air compressor, and one paint-baking facility.

"Actually, if you're willing to rough it, the Big Three machines are sufficient." Zhan Wuya said. "When I was a student, I read memoirs of old defense-industry workers. Those were real masters—a lathe and a vise, and they could make guns, artillery, machine tools." He paused. "But materials are critical. Without good materials, whatever you make will be compromised. Especially: you must have the right steel."

Wang Luobin said: "We plan to build a metallurgical industry—iron smelting, steelmaking."

"That's beyond my expertise. If you can solve materials, machine tools can manufacture all kinds of specialized equipment. The biggest advantage is self-replication; production capacity keeps expanding. Sustainable development, you might say."

"Indeed—no matter how much you stockpile, eventually you'll run out."

"Right. But some things you still have to bring in quantity—cutting tools, which are usually alloy steel or sintered ceramic. We won't make those at first. Same with grinding wheels; they need special materials and sintering. Also lubricants—I don't know if substitutes will work..."

"We can solve these problems one by one." Wen Desi was invigorated. "Old Zhan, why don't you take charge of industrial preparation?"

"No problem!" Zhan Wuya had never felt so fired up. Since leaving the factory to start his own business, he had struggled for nearly a decade. Though he had built a small operation, life had become dull—always scrambling to satisfy clients. Now, an unprecedented new world appeared before him. His fighting spirit surged.

The Crossing Committee's Industrial Group was founded that day. It came to be known as "the Industry Sector." A few days later, another member reported in—Ma Qianzhu, who would later fiercely contest with Zhan Wuya for the title of "Father of Crossing Industry" in their respective memoirs.

Ma Qianzhu had frequented the same forum as Xiao Zishan and the others; they vaguely recognized each other's handles. At first, he hadn't joined the wormhole discussion. He had been absorbed in another thread, devoted to his all-mechanical calculating-center system—christened "Gear Model 5"—an exercise in alternate-history design. Initially, he assumed Director Wen's wormhole was speculative fiction. When he discovered these people were actually preparing to go to the Ming, he hurried to sign up. His motivation was hardly surprising: only by creating a pristine new world—free of microchips, where he himself was among the elite—could he realize his dream: a luxury mechanical computing center covering 6,000 *mu*, with 80,000 horsepower, performing 20,000 calculations per second. The thought of this colossal machine made his soul tremble.

Ma Qianzhu's tastes ran to steampunk. Keywords: *rivets, steam, steel*. Forests of smokestacks, the roar of boilers, black smoke from burning coal, great clouds of steam, the thunderous clang of steel on steel, giant locomotives racing across the land, multi-turret airships kept aloft by helium-filled compartments—*this* was his ideal world.

Upon receiving Wen Desi's invitation, he packed his bags without hesitation, quit his job drawing highway-design diagrams, and set out by train for Guangdong.

His destination was not Guangzhou, but a county-level city he had never heard of. After getting off the train, he still had to transfer to a long-distance bus. This was the staging base Xiao Zishan had found. Here the transmigrators would groom their horses and sharpen their weapons, preparing for a one-way journey to conquer a parallel world.
