# Chapter 21: The Conference — The Women's Corps

During a break, Xiao Zishan stepped out and saw his "Women's Corps" chatting in the lounge. Most had slipped out shortly after the meeting began—there wasn't much entertainment here, only talking. The younger ones saw him and ran over calling "Team Leader!" "Team Leader!"—apparently finding it amusing.

Xiao Zishan gathered them: "There's a recess inside. Let's hold a quick meeting for our General Affairs Group."

"All right." "Go ahead, Team Leader, hahaha." The female energy was in full force.

Xiao Zishan sat, waiting for their giggling to subside—when giddiness got no response from a man, they quieted considerably.

"Our General Affairs Group, to put it bluntly, handles logistics." He surveyed them: eight people total. Except for one lady in her fifties, they were all between twenty-three and thirty, with one just over twenty who seemed reasonably mainstream.

He had reviewed their registration forms. Aside from the fifty-something lady who had written "housewife," the other six had all held jobs. Li Yuanyuan was a secretary; the other five had similar clerical work. Women with technical skills had been assigned elsewhere. Those in General Affairs were, needless to say, women without particular skills.

No wonder nobody cared about the General Affairs leadership—wasn't it basically the "remedial class"? To put it nicely, call it the "General Affairs Section."

"Since we're handling logistics, we'll be doing a lot of tedious chores. Let's start with the most basic issue: eating. General Affairs will be responsible for food supply."

"I've never cooked in my life. I hate cooking more than anything." Right off—a brick to the head that would have knocked out any inexperienced man.

"Neither have I," said another woman timidly, "but I can learn."

"I don't mind cooking, as long as you dare to eat it! Hahaha." This one struck a pose: *if you're not afraid to die, go ahead.*

"I can cook for everyone—rice, flatbread, hand-pulled noodles, all fine. But for this many people we'd need big pots. I've never worked in a cafeteria. I don't know if I can manage." Auntie Cao wrung her hands.

Xiao Zishan knew Auntie Cao's full name was Cao Shunhua. She had graduated middle school and gone to the countryside, returning to the city only much later. Aside from a few years as a temp at a neighborhood collective enterprise, she had essentially been a housewife all her life. Her husband had died young; her daughter worked in construction and had recently divorced. Life had been hard, but she was down-to-earth and resilient—a woman "with the traditional virtues of Chinese working women."

"Let's just order boxed lunches," suggested an older woman. "There are so many people, and there'll be more later. Even if we all cooked, it wouldn't be enough."

"Boxed lunches are low quality—everyone knows that." Xiao Zishan shook his head. "For a quick lunch here and there, fine. But we'll be here for half a year, maybe a year. Boxed lunches every day?!" He paused with an insinuating smile. "Don't you all want your boyfriends and families to eat well?"

In any other context, this reasoning would have fallen on deaf ears. But here was different. These women had chosen to go to another timespace for love; their devotion was surely far above average.

As for why he was insisting on running a cafeteria—it was mainly to accumulate experience for post-crossing food supply. Seventeenth-century Hainan had no fast-food companies.

The women exchanged glances but said nothing.

"Zhao Xiaoqin, you worked in procurement for a restaurant business, right?"

"Yes, five years of procurement experience." This woman approaching thirty let out a long sigh.

"Then you'll be in charge of purchasing." Xiao Zishan proposed. "You're certainly professional."

Zhao Xiaoqin hesitated: "But I'm not familiar with suppliers here."

"No problem. Since it's your field, changing locations should be a piece of cake for a professional like you." Xiao Zishan knew that besides financial incentives, the most effective way to encourage someone was to affirm their value as a professional.

"All right, I'll try. But I have one request."

"Go ahead."

"I need an office. I have my own computer, but I'll need a phone line and a fax machine. If possible, internet."

Xiao Zishan noted her requirements.

"Internet is a bit of a problem—we haven't set it up yet. Phone and office are no problem. I'll get you sorted."

"I'll need you to draw up a menu... a meal plan, so I can estimate quantities." She seemed to be thinking out loud: "Vegetables, meat, poultry and eggs..."

Good—now there was a working atmosphere.

"Xiaoqin-jie, we don't need to buy raw ingredients, do we? We can order pre-processed vegetables."

Yes, pre-processed vegetables. Xiao Zishan thought: *That's what I had in mind.* Someone bringing it up showed they were smart. The advantage was minimal preparation—just cook and serve, skipping tedious sorting, washing, and processing. Perfect for lazy modern people.

If they bought piles of raw chicken, duck, fish, meat, and vegetables like a company cafeteria, just prepping ingredients would cause enormous conflict.

"Oh, right—that's more convenient." Zhao Xiaoqin smiled. "Otherwise, picking and washing vegetables would be a hassle." The dejected look had vanished. "In that case, I'll go into the city these next few days, get some catalogs, check market prices, and when I get back we can calculate per-person standards."

"Good." Xiao Zishan was secretly pleased.

"I'll also need an assistant. Is that okay?" She hesitated. "It's not appropriate for just me to handle things alone."

A seasoned professional who knew the rules. Since she was being sensible, Xiao Zishan showed her full respect:

"You choose someone."

"I'll help you." The young woman who had suggested pre-processed vegetables volunteered. "I can speak Cantonese."

"Good. But Team Leader—what's our budget and reimbursement process?"

Xiao Zishan explained the procedure. During the year-long preparation, establishing a simple but complete administrative and financial system was essential—and would serve as an important reference for the future.

"Got it. Everything is cash on delivery, correct?"

"Correct." This was to minimize supplier contact—they'd just unload at the door and be done.

"Auntie Cao, you'll be leading our kitchen corps." Xiao Zishan spoke with sincerity. "Frankly, we young people aren't skilled at cooking. Running a cafeteria means keeping everyone satisfied. Your cooking is quite good—I'm entrusting this to you."

"Oh, you're too kind, Team Leader..."

"Just call me Zishan."

"Then I'll call you Zishan," Auntie Cao laughed happily. "Cooking isn't that hard—watch a few times and you'll know. It's just that my cooking is Northern-style. I don't know if the Southern comrades will be used to it—I hear you're supposed to add sugar to dishes?"

"I don't think it'll be a problem." Xiao Zishan smiled. "People's tastes aren't that particular anymore. We're getting pre-processed vegetables with mainstream flavors—easy to cook. You just mix things up and make some staples."

"Great! That's my specialty."

"Zhao Xiaoqin, you'll also need to acquire some kitchen equipment. You know a bit about that—go have a look."

She made a note. "What's the maximum number we'll need to feed?"

"Five to six hundred." Xiao Zishan seemed troubled. "Try to economize on equipment. Many things, like rice cookers, might not be usable over there."

"Oh, no problem," she said. "Kitchen equipment can be rented. For now, let's just rent everything."

Xiao Zishan nodded. Indeed, matching profession to task was most powerful. You had to use everyone according to their abilities.

He finished arranging cafeteria-related work. Besides their main duties, General Affairs would help in the cafeteria daily. Other transmigrators would take turns assisting in groups of four. In recognition of General Affairs' contributions, they would have a weekly group dinner—boyfriends or family could attend—at a standard of 20 yuan per person.

This small perk satisfied everyone.

"Li Yuanyuan."

"Present! Team Leader." The girl struck an attention pose.

"You'll also handle all clerical work—personnel files, meeting minutes, reports and applications from each group, financial statements—all to be compiled and archived. Understood?"

"Understood! Team Leader."

"Fang Yijing, you'll handle distributing daily necessities, dormitory management, and assigning cleaning duties."

"Me?" The woman named was startled.

"Weren't you a nursery teacher?"

"Those were children. Here there are many men—"

"It's fine. With women around, they'll pay more attention to their image and won't be too sloppy."

In the brief thirty-minute break, Xiao Zishan had roughly established General Affairs. Procurement: Zhao Xiaoqin. Cafeteria: Tian Shunhua. Dormitory: Fang Yijing. Clerical: Li Yuanyuan. Each with one assistant. After the crossing, organizing logistics would now have a model to follow.
