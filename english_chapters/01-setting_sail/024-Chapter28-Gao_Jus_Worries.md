# Chapter 28: Gao Ju's Worries

The weather wasn't warm at all, and it was still morning, yet Gao Ju was sweating.

Don't misunderstand—though Master Gao had reached middle age and his figure had thickened a bit, he was still a robust man. Not one of those soft, doughy rich men who needed tonics just to handle a concubine.

His arms might not have been tested by galloping horses, but he had once faced dozens of swords, knives, and firearms without changing expression. Yet here was such a man, on a not-particularly-hot late-spring morning, breaking into a cold sweat.

A month earlier, he had received a letter from Eunuch Yang saying he was sending his adopted son, Yang Tianliang, to Guangzhou to discuss an important matter. Gao Ju couldn't fathom what this matter might be, and his heart was drumming.

Having half his profits stripped away by this eunuch pained him every time. But over the years, it was Eunuch Yang's protection that had kept him out of disaster. So year after year, he sent every *fen* of dividends and profit shares to the capital, or deposited them with Guangzhou pawnshops as instructed, without fail.

Every year he sent lychees in summer and delicacies in winter, never daring to slack. So why had he suddenly dispatched a "Little Eunuch Yang" to discuss some great matter?

*Great matter?* Gao Ju smiled bitterly. He was merely a merchant—what great matter could he discuss with such grand palace personages? Surely it was just another demand for a large sum to be "borrowed" or "contributed." And the amount must be enormous; otherwise, a letter would suffice. Dispatching an "adopted son" in person—Eunuch Yang must be in dire need! He sighed. The windfall from a few months ago would have to be coughed up again.

Losing money wasn't what frightened him most. Ever since the rise of the "Nine Thousand Years" at the start of the Tianqi reign, palace affairs had become increasingly unfathomable. His backer, Eunuch Yang, came from the household of Gao Shiming; that Senior Eunuch Gao had wisely resigned on his own in the first year of Tianqi to protect himself. Eunuch Yang was now a marginalized figure in the palace.

What if the Nine Thousand Years took a disliking to Eunuch Yang? Gao Ju broke into a cold sweat. He had no fondness for Eunuch Yang—but years of mutual exploitation had bound them together like two grasshoppers on a string. If Eunuch Yang fell today, tomorrow the Eastern Depot's agents would come crashing through his gates. Catastrophic ruin would follow.

Could this visit be about that? Gao Ju started sweating again. He bellowed:

"Fan me!"

The maids attending in the study hurried to wave the silk fans gently, sending a light breeze mixed with rouge and feminine fragrance. Ordinarily, this would have calmed even the most irritable mood. But now it was useless—he felt only suffocating heat. He suddenly sprang upright and cursed:

"All of you, get out!"

The maids and pages were startled; they quickly hunched their shoulders and withdrew.

He bore it for a moment, then heard a report:

"Steward Yan has arrived."

"Send him in."

Steward Yan came to report that Gao Qing had just brought word: the Australian merchants had arrived.

"Already here?" Gao Ju's eyes lit up—this was somewhat good news. It gave him a small lift. After all, seeing people deliver money was always pleasant. Lately, they no longer wanted porcelain; instead, they wanted various precious medicines and spices, and they were buying hardwoods and sandalwood. This puzzled Gao Ju: the goods weren't hard to find—Guangzhou had plenty. The problem was that these commodities were mostly products of the "Western Ocean" (meaning Zheng He's Western Ocean, different from later usage); all foreign merchants dealt in them. Why would they need him to purchase on their behalf? This made him find these sea merchants ever more peculiar.

That Gao Qing was useless—two months of attending them and he'd discovered nothing. Though Gao Ju hadn't really expected that dull-witted fellow to uncover anything.

No time to worry about that now. He snorted and asked:

"How's the inventory going? Any new goods?"

"No new goods. We're counting quantities now."

"Fine. Have them come over for a chat."

"The Australian masters brought another person... a trader." Steward Yan wasn't sure how to describe this newcomer—whether employee, partner, or equal.

"Invite them all together."

"I understand." Steward Yan stepped closer and said quietly: "This newcomer seems to be a trained fighter. Should the master...?"

"Mm." Gao Ju considered. Probably unnecessary—but Steward Yan's caution showed loyalty. He gave orders: "Tell Instructor Zhao to have a few guards wait in the courtyard. Don't let them show themselves."

"Yes." Seeing no further instructions, Steward Yan was about to withdraw.

"Wait—no word yet from the man we sent to Shaozhou?"

"None. Young Eunuch Yang only left the capital on the second of the third month; he probably hasn't reached Nan'an Prefecture yet. Ten more days at most."

"Have the correspondence secretaries find all letters related to Eunuch Yang and look through them. Investigate Young Eunuch Yang's background: how old he is, when he was adopted, what habits he has—find it all."

"Yes, master."

"Any new court gazettes?"

"The secretaries didn't mention any, so probably not. For the fourth month, there's only one 'Urgent Appointments Report'—just appointments. They didn't think it worth presenting..."

"What nonsense—go fetch it immediately!" The Urgent Appointments Report was different from ordinary court circulars; it was the Ministry of Personnel's list of official transfers. Though it didn't include major officials, reading seasonal patterns—even minor personnel changes might reveal which way the court wind was blowing.

Having given his orders and drunk some tea to steady himself, he rose to receive guests in the outer study.

Beiwei was crossing the wormhole for the first time. Standing now in this Ming-era building, it felt like a dream.

Being a reconnaissance soldier was long in the past. After demobilization, whatever he did, he still worked to maintain the skills he'd learned. This time, joining the crossing-trade, his focus was a simple reconnaissance trip for future underground operations in Guangzhou.

Master Gao was their collaborator—but only a collaborator. Since the partnership was purely profit-driven, he might betray them at any moment. They had to guard against this.

If other forces intervened and endangered Master Gao for their own purposes, disrupting the collaboration, they also needed to be prepared to protect the collaborator and this channel.

From the moment Beiwei left the back door of the Guangzhou branch, all the way into the Gao residence, he had been walking with a peculiar stiff gait—every step exactly 80 centimeters. In his bag was a portable camcorder, automatically filming the environment. But more reliable were his eyes and brain: recording every doorway, every courtyard, every turn, every entrance...

Steward Yan had sent away the irrelevant servants, but this new Australian's strange behavior set the escorting guards to whispering. They also envied that powerful physique—an average guard probably couldn't last three moves against him.

Host and guests were now exchanging pleasantries. To avoid unnecessary socializing, they had agreed beforehand: Beiwei would present himself as a bodyguard brought by the Australian merchants. So he sat erect behind Director Wen, hands on knees, motionless. But his eyes surveyed every direction.

Though called the outer study, it was actually a complete small courtyard, and the hall wasn't small. Beiwei's gaze swept the room: eleven Ming-era people. That Master Gao; one escorting steward; one guard; two serving maids; two young manservants; and four household guards at the four corners.

The four guards were well-proportioned—small but sturdy. Obviously household martial artists. Their shirts were loose—probably concealing iron rods inside.

These were only part of it. Since entering, Beiwei had noticed four more guards standing inconspicuously behind the artificial rock formation and trees.

The true master was probably the guard standing behind Master Gao, controlling the door to the side chamber. He wore a blue archer's-sleeve jacket, standing quietly with hands at his sides, but emanated a subtle, contained ferocity.

He didn't know how formidable these Ming martial-arts masters actually were. Beiwei's palms itched—if there was a chance to spar, he wouldn't pass it up. He was interested in traditional Chinese martial arts. In the military, combat training focused on modern techniques; traditional martial arts weren't covered much. He'd attended some performances, but felt unsatisfied—too many flowery moves with little real combat technique.

Master Gao and Wen Desi continued their business talk, both somewhat distracted. One was thinking about Eunuch Yang's affair; the other was considering the expansion of the Guangzhou branch.

Wen Desi's main purpose for this visit was exactly that: to expand the Guangzhou branch.

Their foundation was good, but too closed off. All external dealings went through Gao Ju—unfavorable for future trade and intelligence work. The Executive Committee wanted to "go out" as much as possible and develop more agents—not just merchants like Master Gao, but also officials, scholars, and ordinary people.

Of course, they couldn't do that yet. Their appearance was strange, their speech peculiar—going out meant being mobbed by onlookers. But the household of servants Master Gao had given them offered another opportunity. If they could win the Gao family's hearts, the road ahead would only grow broader.

The meeting ended quickly. After exchanging goods manifests, the transaction was complete. Goods and silver would be transported by servants. Master Gao was anxious to return to his study and review the materials his secretaries had compiled, so he had no heart for polite invitations to stay for dinner. He simply had a table of food and wine sent over.
