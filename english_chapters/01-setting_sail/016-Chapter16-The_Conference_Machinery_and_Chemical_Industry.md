# Chapter 16: The Conference — Machinery and Chemical Industry

The discussion turned to machinery manufacturing—Director Wen's specialty. The central question was what equipment to bring, and Zhan Wuya, who had contributed a small machine shop, took the lead in reporting their available assets.

"Can this equipment produce the specialized machinery we'll need?" someone asked. "Boilers, for instance?"

"In theory, absolutely." Zhan Wuya scratched his head, clearly unaccustomed to fielding questions from the podium. "My little factory isn't much to look at, but given the right materials, we can fabricate most general mechanical equipment. Mind you, we mainly process parts for clients—we haven't tackled complex complete systems. And there are certain components we don't make in-house." He paused, searching for examples. "Standard components, for one. Screws, bolts, washers—those are best produced with dedicated equipment. We could make them, of course, but it's more trouble than it's worth. We'd have to build specialized machines just for that purpose.

"Then there are castings, gears, and bearings—not things a small shop can handle. They require specialized equipment, heat treatment, electroplating. That's outside my expertise. We usually just buy ready-made parts or outsource the work."

"But gears and bearings are indispensable," someone countered. "If we can't manufacture them, our entire equipment production capability hits a dead end."

"Then bring specialized equipment. For gears, you'd want a hobbing machine. Bearings are trickier..."

"A complete bearing-factory setup would probably run over ten million."

"Ten million is one problem—where do you find enough skilled workers to operate it?"

"We'll have to improvise. Maximize what we've got. Full-scale specialized equipment is too heavy an investment."

The suggestions came quickly now: "Heat-treatment furnaces for materials processing. Bearing cages and ball installation can be done by hand, fixed with a punch press..."

The discussion grew labyrinthine. After much murmuring, the Industry Group's deliberations gradually subsided—they had apparently reached consensus on gear and bearing manufacturing. Someone began compiling a list, which Xiao Zishan guessed was an equipment checklist.

Wen Desi spoke up: "I propose that for parts standardization, we skip the shearing and bending machines—extra punch presses can substitute. But we should bring as many cutting tools and grinding wheels as possible. The machine shop also lacks a milling machine and heat-treatment furnace. Those are essential."

"For completeness, we'll also need a broaching machine and a boring machine," added Jiang Ye, who had spent eight years as a lathe operator. "And more lathes. After all, the lathe is the most fundamental piece of machining equipment."

"How about eight lathes?"

"Too few. Make it twelve. They're incredibly versatile."

"What about forging presses? We can't do without those."

As the machinery discussion raged on, many in the audience began to yawn. But bound by the rule against leaving before an agenda item concluded, they simply started their own side conversations, and the room filled with a low buzz of competing voices.

Wang Luobin suddenly stood up without asking permission—the machinists had completely abandoned any pretense of following the moderator. "We also need a small foundry—don't forget that. If we're going to manufacture engines, it's absolutely essential. A single-cylinder diesel engine is practically universal: it can plow fields and transplant rice, power boats, generate electricity in mountain villages, haul people and cargo on roads."

"Small engines shouldn't be a problem," someone agreed. "A typical single-cylinder agricultural engine can use cast iron. HT250 will do—good vibration absorption, excellent casting flow, easy to machine."

"Speaking of casting, mold-making is another issue entirely. That's a specialized trade. Having equipment doesn't mean you can produce quality parts; you need proper molds. Modern mold-making equipment is insane—3D modeling, electrical discharge machining... This is going to be a problem."

"It's not that dramatic. You're thinking of current methods. In the old days, process designers would draw up blueprints, machine the parts, and fitters would assemble everything. Fitter skill was what really mattered."

Gradually, the machinery discussion wound down. The Industry Group had used a considerable amount of paper, and they seemed fairly confident in their conclusions. Wen Desi watched Engineer Wang scribbling enthusiastically and worried the procurement list was growing unwieldy.

"I'm Ji Situi." A man with a full beard rose to his feet. Despite the facial hair, his face had an almost baby-like quality. "I represent the Chemical Group, and I'm here to lodge a strong protest." He emphasized the words "Chemical Group" with particular weight. "Chemical industry is critically important—how can it be lumped indiscriminately with general industry? They're all machinists over there. We have nothing in common!"

"The grouping issue can be discussed later. First, let's hear your views on chemical industry."

"Three acids, two alkalis." Ji Situi's tone was declarative. "That's our goal—solving the production of these fundamental substances. Let me provide some basic context: the chemical industry we're discussing is heavy chemical industry—the foundation upon which all other chemical industry rests."

Now it was the machinery people's turn to yawn, though most still watched with interest.

"Chemical industry is the most versatile sector there is. Chemical products are rarely end products; they're primarily utilized by other industries. Sulfuric acid for fertilizer. Soda ash for glass manufacturing. Synthetic ammonia for explosives and fertilizers. If we can solve the production of these basic heavy-chemical products, we unlock solutions to countless manufacturing problems.

"Do you have any idea how much your daily life depends on the chemical industry?" He shook his head in exasperation. "You don't—that's why you lumped chemistry in with machinery. Tragic!"

"Skip the lamentations. Stick to the facts."

"Very well. Our fundamental chemical equipment needs include a synthetic-ammonia-cum-combined-soda-process system and a coal-tar chemical system. These two installations will roughly meet our basic needs—especially the synthetic-ammonia unit."

"What exactly is coal-tar chemical equipment?"

"A coking furnace?"

"No. Simply put, it's integrated equipment for manufacturing various chemical products from coal tar. It can produce sulfuric acid, phenol, aniline, dyes—and sulfonamide."

"Sulfonamide is invaluable. That gives us antibiotics."

"Output won't be enormous, but it should suffice for general use."

"And the synthetic ammonia—that's for fertilizer?"

"Extremely useful. Let me put it plainly: without synthetic ammonia, we cannot produce nitric acid. Without nitric acid, we cannot produce explosives. And the fertilizer industry's dependence on synthetic ammonia is even more absolute."

Ji Situi continued: "Beyond complete systems, we should prepare backup chemical equipment—synthesis towers, absorption towers, carbon-removal towers, distillation towers, saturated-hot-water towers, various reaction kettles, pressure-resistant piping, acid pumps, heaters... I'd estimate five to six hundred tons of materials in total."

"Can't we produce this equipment ourselves? Our machinery capability is fairly complete."

"It's a materials issue," Ji Situi replied. "Unless we can quickly produce stainless steel, polyethylene, and similar materials, manufacturing chemical equipment domestically within ten years will be extremely difficult."

"What about glass and ceramics?" Luo Duo spoke up again. "The Eighth Route Army made sulfuric acid using water urns as reaction towers. And plenty of improvised equipment during the Great Leap Forward relied on these materials."

"I'm not certain about that approach. If we can procure modern equipment, there's no need for improvised methods. Production efficiency would be far superior, and the working environment much safer. If any of you want to try making sulfuric acid using water urns, I'd suggest thinking carefully about your teeth."

"I'd like to ask: once we have this equipment, can we establish an organic-chemical industry?"

"That..." Ji Situi paused, thinking: *These people are really reaching for the stars.* Organic chemistry wasn't nearly that straightforward. "That will be very difficult."

"So no nylon and no synthetic rubber," someone lamented.

"What do you need nylon for—stockings?" came a teasing voice.

"Sheer black, sheer nude... can't live without either."

When trolling took over, Xiao Zishan had to quash their creativity and steer them back on topic.

"Rubber trees take eleven years before you can tap them," someone pointed out, "but there are countless uses for rubber."

"We're not making condoms—why must we have rubber?"

This drew another round of laughter, and the meeting once again descended into freewheeling discussion. Xiao Zishan finally managed to restore order.

"I assume you want organic chemistry for plastics," Ji Situi addressed the original questioner, who nodded. "Plastics are our most common household material, but they involve complex organic chemistry. We probably can't produce them—it's not merely a question of raw materials. However, we can manufacture celluloid and Bakelite."

"Bakelite is very useful."

"If we're building an electrical system, Bakelite is invaluable—though rubber would be too..."

"Let's have Agriculture address the rubber question later."
