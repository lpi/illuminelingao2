# Chapter 11: Servants (Part One)

"We understand. Thank you, Master Gao." Wen Desi offered simple gratitude without elaboration.

Gao Ju noticed their reluctance to discuss the ship and did not press the matter. Instead, he summoned the servants who had been looking after the house: a middle-aged couple leading two teenagers of about thirteen or fourteen. All four came forward and kowtowed.

"This family was not born into my household," Gao Ju explained. "I saved them from death in Jiangxi years ago. They are loyal and reliable."

At their master's words, the family kowtowed again and again in gratitude. Gao Ju waved them off. "Enough. These gentlemen shall henceforth be your masters. Serve them diligently."

"Yes, we understand!" The family turned and kowtowed to Wen Desi's party. "We, your humble servants, greet our masters."

"This, this, this—" The three transmigrators rose awkwardly, startled by the display. As modern people, suddenly having an entire family kneeling and kowtowing before them was deeply uncomfortable.

"These are their indentures." Master Gao produced several papers. "They are sold absolutely. You may command them without hesitation." He drew out another document. "And this is the deed to this residence. I had promised to purchase a house on your behalf, but the timing proved inconvenient. If you do not find this humble dwelling beneath you, please stay here for the time being."

The three exchanged glances. What a generous merchant! His intent to win them over was transparent, yet such liberality demonstrated real sincerity. Still, on closer thought, this windfall concealed deeper meanings.

The house was his private property—he knew every detail of its layout. If he wished to investigate or monitor them, he would remain in the shadows while they sat exposed in plain sight. And this family of servants had been in his employ for years. "Loyal and reliable" they might be—to him. Not necessarily to shady overseas merchants. Placed beside them to spy, the transmigrators' every move would effectively be under his control. It felt like living in a glass house, stark naked.

Beyond currying favor, Master Gao was clearly trying to keep them under his thumb. The reason was obvious: the goods they brought had generated enormous profits.

Originally, they had planned to buy a house as a foothold and expand gradually after the crossing. Now a house and servants had been handed to them gratis. The situation had developed far beyond expectations. Yet refusing would be unwise. Xiao Zishan calculated quickly: the cross-temporal trading operations wouldn't continue for many more trips. As long as they acted carefully each time, nothing would be revealed. After the crossing was complete, they could reconsider their position in Guangzhou. For now, better to keep Master Gao content and let him continue selling their goods.

They exchanged glances once more. Wen Desi cupped his hands in thanks and accepted the documents, then produced a tael of silver as a customary gift for the kowtowing ceremony.

Master Gao was visibly pleased. He ordered his own servants to transport their silver and goods to the new residence, then had food, clothing, and supplies sent over as well—the utmost attentiveness.

Xiao Zishan, Wen Desi, and Wang Luobin conferred in low voices: since they were here, they might as well make the best of it. They would inspect the house and get a sense of the servants. Xiao Zishan called the male servant over.

The man appeared quite aged—Xiao Zishan guessed he was at least in his fifties. He came and stood at attention, hands at his sides, face full of deference. Director Wen and Engineer Wang seemed uneasy with such servility, but Xiao Zishan remained composed. He took a sip of tea first and sat in deliberate silence before beginning his questions.

The servant's original surname was Liu, his given name Qing. He was originally from Jiangxi, where he had tenant-farmed about ten mu. In the forty-fifth year of Wanli, a flood destroyed his harvest, and the family fled as refugees. They lay dying by the roadside when Master Gao happened to pass by on his way back from Nanjing. He took in over a dozen refugee families as bond servants, and Liu Qing was among the fortunate. Since then, he had been a slave of the Gao household.

After joining, he adopted his master's surname and became Gao Qing; his wife became Gao Xian. The couple had worked as general laborers in the outer yard until less than half a month ago, when they were reassigned here to look after this residence.

As for his age, he was actually only in his early forties—exactly how old, even he wasn't sure. Xiao Zishan knew that in the old days, many farmers didn't know their precise ages. Nothing unusual about that.

"Guarding this house must be better than working as laborers at the main residence?" Xiao Zishan ventured.

Gao Qing smiled bitterly. "Reporting to the master—there's less work here, more leisure, no one supervising us. But making ends meet is harder."

When he and his wife worked at the main residence, he explained, they each earned only two qian per month, but meals were free. Not only did they not go hungry, but their two children could eat their fill as well. Since being transferred here, his wages had risen to five qian, but they had to cook for themselves; firewood, rice, oil, salt, and vegetables all came out of pocket, and the children couldn't mooch meals anymore. Thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds were ravenous eaters. For a family of four to live on seven qian was truly a strain.

Wen Desi frowned. "What do you mean? The children don't get wages—don't they also belong to Master Gao?"

"The children have never been assigned duties," Gao Qing said, shaking his head. "Without duties, the household issues no money or grain. They depend entirely on their parents." He sighed heavily. "I had hoped to get my daughter assigned to the inner quarters. She'd earn at least a string of cash. But she's not pretty enough—never selected. I asked the steward's wife for help, but she demands ten taels first. How could our family ever save that much?"

Corruption truly had ancient roots, the three marveled. Even becoming a maid required paying bribes. Then again, thinking of the *Dream of the Red Chamber*—how Wuer's family had to conduct a whole campaign just to secure her a position at Daguanyuan—it was not so surprising after all.

"Now that you're in our service, are you content?" Xiao Zishan softened his tone.

Gao Qing glanced uneasily at these overseas-merchant masters who couldn't even dress themselves properly. "We are lowly servants," he replied carefully. "There is no question of content or not. Now that we belong to the masters, the masters may command us as they wish."

Xiao Zishan nodded and had him lead the way as they inspected the entire house. It was not large; each courtyard followed a layout of one main hall flanked by two side rooms. The first courtyard held the reception hall and study; the second had an upper floor for living quarters; the third contained the kitchen, firewood storage, and a mule-and-horse stable, along with a private well.

The building was not new, but it had been solidly constructed with blue bricks laid flat—very sturdy. Because it was intended as an emergency refuge, the furnishings were simple, though daily necessities had been stocked. The kitchen was piled with supplies from the Gao residence: rice, salted meat, dried fish, firewood, oil, and salt. Gao Qing handed over an inventory list. Wen Desi had no interest and was about to say "Keep it all for your family" when he noticed Xiao Zishan had already taken the list and was examining it carefully.
