# Chapter 25: The Carrot and the Stick

The four visitors spent the remainder of that day productively. Master Gao's table of food and wine consisted of the "Four Great Courses"—twelve dishes in all—and though the cuisine differed from modern Cantonese cooking, the natural ingredients and careful preparation produced flavors that were rich, fresh, and succulent. A thick soup of "Xi Shi's Tongue" clams proved particularly excellent, drawing appreciative nods from everyone at the table.

*Being a leader really is grand,* Beiwei thought to himself. *Where would ordinary folks get to indulge like this in the Ming Dynasty?*

As he mused, Gao Qing's wife Gao Xian emerged from the kitchen bearing a freshly reheated main dish—a full plate of meatballs the size of pigeon eggs floating in shallow clear broth, glistening and tender, sprinkled with bright green scallions.

Wen Desi reached for his spoon first. One bite, and fresh, clean flavors filled his palate, with a subtle tingle of Sichuan pepper lingering in the aftertaste. Director Wen had moved in social circles back home; though never one for lavish banquets, his dining experience was among the best of the transmigrators. Yet this mouthful stumped him—he couldn't identify what it was. It seemed like chicken but also like seafood.

"What is this?" he asked.

"'Land and Sea Treasure,'" Gao Xian replied softly. "Soft-shelled turtle, silver fish, chicken, frog, and white shrimp, all mixed together. Does it please you, sir?"

"Excellent—truly delicious."

"Indeed, very good," another agreed.

"The landlord class really does live decadently," Engineer Wang said, wearing an envious expression that made clear he wouldn't have minded a little decadence himself.

"Such a fuss over some meatballs," Beiwei scoffed.

Wen Desi shook his head with genuine regret. "Almost every dish has Sichuan pepper—it overwhelms what would otherwise be wonderful flavor. The ingredients are so fresh and natural..."

"That seems to be a Ming-era habit," someone observed. "The Ming was also an important market in the Southeast Asian spice trade."

"That entrepôt trade is worth pursuing."

As they talked, Gao Xian brought out six small plates of cured snacks to accompany the wine. When she came to warm the jar of Jinhua wine, she found it untouched and hesitated.

"The masters don't drink wine?"

"We don't drink." They feared alcohol might cause problems, so they hadn't touched a drop since arriving in Ming-era timespace.

"If the masters don't wish to drink wine, I have some flower essence I distilled myself. Diluted with water, would that suit?"

"Flower essence—like cologne?" Everyone looked startled.

"Yes, I distilled it myself. Currently I have rice-leaf and perilla. If the masters don't mind, please try some."

It turned out to be aromatic essential oil distilled from plant leaves and flowers. Ming-era distilling technology was already mature, and small alembics, besides making liquor, were commonly used for flower essences. Diluted with clear water, the drink had an elegant, refreshing fragrance.

But Xiao Zishan had grown suspicious. This Gao Xian was supposedly a tenant farmer's wife who did menial work—yet she knew how to make flower essence and understood fine recipes. He studied the woman more carefully and noticed in her movements and bearing a certain refinement, nothing like her husband's awkwardness.

Intent on investigating, he stopped her as she turned to leave. "Sister Gao, you've served in a grand household before, haven't you?"

Gao Xian startled visibly. "Yes, I've always been at the Gao mansion..."

"That can't be right. At the Gao mansion you did rough work. How would you know the recipe for 'Land and Sea Treasure'? Where did you learn to make flower essence?"

Gao Xian stammered, her composure cracking. "I... the other servant women taught me... forgive my presumption, sir..."

"How old are you?"

"This servant is thirty."

Xiao Zishan studied her face—darkened by labor now but still showing traces of youthful beauty—and thought of Gao Lujie's appearance, the age difference between this couple. He understood seven or eight parts of it, though there was no need to speak aloud just yet.

After a moment's thought, he glanced outside the hall. No one else was there; Gao Qing was probably working in the back courtyard.

"These past days—has Gao Qing often gone to Master Gao's?"

Gao Xian started violently but said nothing. Xiao Zishan knew he was right: Master Gao must have Gao Qing reporting on them regularly.

"And Steward Yan comes often too?" he continued, his voice measured and slow.

"Never came... only occasionally..."

"Which is it—never, or occasionally?"

"It's... occasionally, just visiting as acquaintances..." The lie came with difficulty. Under this barrage of questions, she was already panicking. Master Xiao's words implied he knew everything, including her past—but how? While her mind churned in turmoil, she saw Xiao Zishan's expression darkening. Knowing things were going badly, she dropped to her knees.

"This servant deserves death. I shouldn't have deceived the masters..."

Beiwei had been a revolutionary soldier under the red flag, and he couldn't stand seeing this. He was about to speak when Wen Desi stopped him with a look. Though Xiao Zishan's questioning was sudden, it was part of their plan to win hearts.

"He's come quite a few times, hasn't he?" Xiao Zishan pressed. "I imagine he's even looked into the courtyard where we stay."

"No, no." Gao Xian's face went pale.

"And he's promised you—if one day we return to Australia, he'll take you back into the Gao household. Is that so?"

Gao Xian trembled. *The masters know everything!* She silently cursed her husband for his lack of backbone. Every time Steward Yan had cajoled and threatened, he'd agreed to let him search around. Though nothing had been discovered, this was still the crime of betraying one's masters.

"This servant deserves death. It's all my husband's fault..." Gao Xian prostrated herself and confessed everything about Steward Yan's visits during their absences.

"My husband is soft-eared and weak-minded; he was foolish to heed that man's nonsense," she sobbed. "I beg the masters, considering his age and his leg ailment, to spare him the household punishment. This servant is willing to take double punishment on his behalf."

Everyone listened, finding it matched their prior estimates. Seeing her beg so pitifully for her husband, they couldn't help but feel sympathy. *You don't know how sweet the new society is until you've experienced the old one.*

Xiao Zishan let the silence stretch deliberately, then heaved a theatrical sigh.

"Sister Gao, since your whole family came under us, have we ever wronged you?"

"You put me to shame, sir. The masters' kindness—our whole family is endlessly grateful."

"When your provisions ran short, we gave extra monthly rice. When the children grew and had no spending money, we gave them wages. I don't ask for gratitude—I only hoped that having traveled ten thousand *li* to find a foothold here, we'd have a peaceful place to rest. I'd prefer not to be scrutinized in every detail."

Gao Xian said nothing, only sobbed and kowtowed.

"Get up."

"I dare not. Please punish this servant severely to uphold household discipline."

Xiao Zishan thought this woman really did have her routines down—clearly not an ordinary farmer's wife.

"Without rules, nothing succeeds. You and Gao Qing were at fault, but we hadn't set rules beforehand. We'll count this as ignorance, not crime. Get up."

"Thank the masters for their grace." Gao Xian heard the change in tone and figured they wouldn't be thrown out. A beating she could endure; what she feared was being expelled. Even if Master Gao took them back, there would be no good days ahead.

"Do you understand what comes next?"

"Yes, this servant understands."

"I know you're not from a small household. You understand propriety far better than Gao Qing. From now on, guide him well—teach him to know his place."

"I understand, I understand." Gao Xian nodded repeatedly.

"As long as you serve diligently and loyally, whether or not we return to Australia, we won't leave you without a future. Make the most of this chance."

"This servant thanks—" Gao Xian began to kneel again, but Xiao Zishan stopped her. Better not to play the grand landlord too much in front of everyone. "Go call Gao Di."

After she left, Xiao Zishan turned to the others with a lighter expression. "How was my performance?" He was eager to shift the atmosphere—he didn't want to leave an impression of being tyrannical. *Performance*—yes, just a performance.

Wen Desi's jaw dropped. "Zishan, are you really from poor-peasant stock?"

"Of course."

"You're a Golden Horse Award-winning actor," Engineer Wang marveled.

"You scared that poor woman half to death. Wasn't that overkill?" Beiwei still felt sympathy.

"It was a bit much," Xiao Zishan admitted with a nod, "but for the carrot-and-stick approach, this is the minimum. We're surrounded by eyes. If we don't change this situation, we can't carry out any work later."

Wen Desi nodded. "The favors we gave them before were the carrot. Now it's time to show the stick."

"Exactly." Since they couldn't yet remove these "eyes," they could only turn them around.

"Will this be enough?"

"Just the beginning. Loyalty isn't built with a few words. Recruiting followers is hard." To gain loyalty, first one must have power—no one is loyal to the weak. Second, there must be benefits—with benefits comes motivation. Before, they had given benefits; now they had to demonstrate power. At the right moment, results would follow naturally.

"I read that the time-travel predecessors had it easy—a few words and their followers would kowtow in devotion."

"Maybe we lack that 'main-character aura'?"

"You can have it—I don't want it..."

The atmosphere lightened again, and Xiao Zishan secretly exhaled. In truth, he hadn't been entirely confident about that conversation, but he had exploited the woman's fear of her past being exposed.

After a while, Gao Di arrived. Though young, he was sharp. Seeing his mother's reddened eyes, he knew something had happened, and he hurriedly brought his account book to pay respects.

Wen Desi asked casually about the household situation and reviewed the account book—just a simple ledger, and with minimal expenses, it was quickly understood. He praised the boy a bit, and seeing his unease fade, asked:

"Do people from the Gao household come often lately?"

"Often!" The boy didn't hide it, nodding vigorously. "That Little-Hat Yan comes all the time, always whispering with Father."

"Little-Hat Yan?" Wen Desi was confused, then realized he meant Steward Yan—who regularly wore a six-panel cap.

"What do they talk about?"

Gao Di hesitated. Xiao Zishan spoke up. "Just tell us."

"It seems Little-Hat Yan always asks about the masters' affairs," Gao Di said. "But Father won't let me listen when they're talking."

"Are the Gao household people good to you?"

"Good?" Gao Di didn't quite understand. "I don't know. I've never served the Gao household directly. The accountants treat me well, and there are children I often play with."

"All Gao household servants?"

"Yes—some born in the house, some like me."

"Among those children, are there any you're especially close with?"

"Quite a few—Little Li, Little Qian, the Wang brothers..."

"Good. Come to the study later and make a list." Wen Desi instructed.
