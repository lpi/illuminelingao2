# Chapter 47: Preparing to Depart

The moon swelled toward fullness, and headquarters' steady rhythm fractured into something altogether more frantic. The entire organization shifted into high gear.

The Finance Department converted all liquid assets to RMB, then transmuted that RMB into an avalanche of supplies. To guard against last-minute complications, the Finance Group retained roughly 500,000 yuan in reserve. They'd also privately cast their remaining ten-plus kilograms of unsold gold into ingots—ten-gram, twenty-five-gram, and fifty-gram bars, ready for immediate use. Not as convenient as cash, but everyone understood gold's enduring value.

Except for the maritime personnel stationed at the freight-forwarding office on the Leizhou Peninsula, all transmigrators on external assignments returned to base for final preparations.

The Medical and Health Group conducted comprehensive final reviews, with immunizations as the priority. Despite countless announcements, some individuals hadn't bothered getting vaccinated yet claimed they had—a few had even brought forged vaccination certificates.

For certain vaccines, catch-up doses were no longer feasible. The complete hepatitis B series required eighteen months. The Health Group scrambled to increase vaccine procurement for faster protocols.

"Don't these people understand they're gambling with their lives?" He Ma stared at the "Incomplete Immunization Status Report," genuinely baffled. He didn't know seventeenth-century Hainan's precise disease situation, but it was easy enough to imagine—a paradise for microorganisms. Cholera had still broken out multiple times on Hainan well into the twentieth century.

"Many also skipped the corneal surgery for vision correction," Dr. Lan Fangfang added painfully. He'd had to append a complete set of old-fashioned optometry equipment to the medical supplies—equipment that had become genuinely difficult to locate compared to ubiquitous computerized optical systems.

Many things proved unexpectedly difficult to find. The Health Group's persistent headache was their inability to rely on disposable supplies like modern hospitals did. Glass syringes. Glass IV sets. These had largely vanished from the market. Matching items like small medical autoclaves had similarly disappeared. They'd scoured pharmaceutical companies, medical-equipment factories, and hospital warehouses across the country to assemble a complete set. Specialized rubber tubing on older medical equipment had long since deteriorated, with no replacements available anywhere—they'd had to commission custom molds from manufacturers at considerable expense.

The Executive Committee's attitude toward medical care was unambiguous: "Spend without limit." As long as expenditures ensured the highest possible standard of care, they'd approve any budget. The Health Group ultimately spent more than any other civilian department.

The final inventory could have equipped a small hospital:

**1. Diagnostic Equipment**

- Glass IV bottles ×50 sets
- Surgical instrument sets ×20
- Dental instrument sets ×10
- Obstetric instrument sets ×5
- Orthopedic instruments and equipment ×2 sets

Each surgical set included: electrosurgical knife ×1, pointed and rounded scalpels ×1 each, hemostatic clamps (large/medium/small) ×4 each, curved clamps ×4, hook clamps ×4, retractors (large/medium/small) ×2 each, toothed forceps (large/small) ×2 each, smooth forceps (large/small) ×2 each, intestinal spatulas (large/medium/small) ×2.

Plus surgical gowns, masks, caps, gloves, and extensive quantities of sutures, dressings, gauze, and disinfectants.

**3. Medications**
- Emergency drugs: mannitol, isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, verapamil, cedilanid, amiodarone, propranolol, digitalis, atropine
- Large quantities of lidocaine (anesthetic)
- Large quantities of furosemide (diuretic)
- Large quantities of antibiotics (penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, ornidazole, metronidazole, meropenem, vancomycin—spanning low to high potency)
- Large quantities of antivirals (ribavirin)
- Various common medications, vaccines, and antivenoms

**4. Equipment**
Autoclaves, various stainless steel medical containers, UV disinfection carts, refrigerators, infant incubators, and more.

First-aid kits: five allocated per person, with one issued directly as standard equipment.

If they could have located one, the Committee would have purchased a complete field hospital. But exhaustive searches across the country turned up nothing available for civilian acquisition. The Committee's perfectionist obsession with medical supplies eventually prompted intervention from the Health Group doctors themselves—they had to rein in the ever-expanding demands. Someone had even added a CT machine to the procurement list; they'd had to explain that while undeniably useful, it wasn't essential...

As for individual equipment, the Committee's "better excessive than lacking" philosophy found full expression—though they did create tiered configurations based on job assignments.

**Level A (Standard)**: Personal issue for all transmigrators.

At this level, equipment primarily addressed daily work and living needs, with limited protection for low-intensity conflicts and short-distance travel.

Knockoff USMC modular backpack (separable into six bags of varying sizes). Regular transmigrators didn't receive camouflage—just tropical military-green training uniforms and tropical combat boots. One boonie hat and one helmet-style cap each (the latter featuring a mosquito-net face cover). Also: goggles, raincoat, and rubber wading boots.

Normally, transmigrators would sleep aboard ship or in prefab housing at base, so accommodation items didn't emphasize camping capability. Given Hainan's subtropical climate: 15°C-rated sleeping bags with matching ground pads.

For protection and weapons, Level-A personnel weren't expected to engage in intense conflict—only limited protective gear was required. Issue: stab-resistant vest, gloves, and one Type-80 steel helmet. (Newer lightweight helmets had been rejected because synthetic materials deteriorated over time; the old Type-80s were abundant and cheap.)

Communication: walkie-talkie (1km+ range, networkable) and survival whistle.

**Personal items issued:**
- Waterproof outdoor watch (altimeter, thermometer, barometer, electronic compass, timer, alarm)
- Knockoff Swiss Army knife and short machete (1 each)
- Compass
- Headlamp
- Flashlight (friction-powered to conserve batteries)
- Windproof lighter
- Small steel cup (multipurpose, including morning wash)
- Outdoor canteen (effective preservation, neutral color)
- Military canteen (includes mess tin—highly practical)
- Mess kit, enamel plate, travel utensils (1 set each)

Finally: two days' emergency rations (energy bars and beef jerky), plus sewing kit and first-aid kit.

Toiletries and general underwear, socks, and clothing remained personal responsibility.

Above Level A came **Level B** (regular soldiers, long-distance surveyors) and **Level C** (scouts, remote field researchers). These levels added camouflage shells over training uniforms, plus increasingly specialized outdoor and military equipment—too numerous to list exhaustively. However, many Level B and C items weren't permanently issued; they'd be distributed only as operational needs arose and returned afterward.

Per Committee calculations, each transmigrator was permitted 200kg of personal items, including issued equipment. No restrictions on item types as long as weight remained under the limit—though privately carrying firearms was prohibited (any brought had to be surrendered for centralized storage).

Ma Qianzhu led tireless inspections of every transmigrator's packed belongings and found himself repeatedly shaking his head. Almost everyone had brought various computers, yet few had thought to include a notebook and pen. Many had also packed MP3 players, PSPs, and other entertainment devices—as if their destination featured power outlets on every tree. But underwear, socks, and toiletries—items crucial for hygiene—were conspicuously scant.

Such "hiking trip rather than time-travel" equipment was everywhere. The Committee decided to systematically adjust everyone's gear, persuading them not to bring so much useless weight. Rejected items could be mailed home, but most absolutely refused to leave their computers behind. Even if the crossing succeeded and they all eventually attained comfortable retirements, computers wouldn't be producible again in their lifetimes.

"Forget it—let them bring them." Shi Kai, responsible for all IT systems, sighed with resignation. "At least we'll have more spare computer parts." His own burden wasn't light—a full cabinet of IT equipment, and he wasn't entirely confident his undergraduate-level skills would prove adequate.

Wang Luobin and the other procurement specialists made additional runs to nearby cities—buying all kinds of items they hadn't previously considered but now realized were essential.

Packing continued through constant rechecking and supplementation. The commotion didn't subside until late into the night. The next morning, transmigrators gathered on the training ground, everyone dressed in their uniformly issued clothing.

"Not bad—actually looks like an army now." Xi Yazhou surveyed the transmigrators seated on the ground, waiting to board.

"Hmm. A rabble." Ma Qianzhu's tone was distinctly unenthusiastic. More than an army, this scene resembled a college military-training redux.

"Don't say that, Old Ma." Xi Yazhou clapped him on the shoulder with theatrical heroism. "Together, we'll sweep across all of China..."
