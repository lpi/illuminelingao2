# Chapter 843: Entrepôt Trade

Skaed kept this secret, merely indicating that as long as the East India Company was willing to sign a long-term trade agreement, the Lingao side could completely supply any Ming commodities they needed, including the raw silk and silk goods the Dutch were most interested in. As for prices, they would be lower than those of both Zheng Zhilong and Liu Xiang. Skaed proposed that the best "Nanjing silk" at Qiongzhou FOB price would be 110 taels per dan. The Dutch buying Nanjing silk transported by Chinese merchants in Tayouan paid as much as 145 taels per dan.

This price made Van der Lanthroon very satisfied. If enough raw silk could be loaded at Lingao, then ships departing from Batavia wouldn't need to return to Batavia immediately after unloading at Lingao. Some ships could go directly north to Tayouan Port and transfer to Japan. Copper and silver exported from Japan transported from Tayouan could also be shipped to Lingao to pay for transactions. The arrangement of trade routes would be much more flexible than before, and ship transport capacity could be maximized.

Van der Lanthroon immediately expressed willingness to sign this trade agreement. Both sides initialed a draft special trade agreement on re-exporting Ming commodities. The Department of Colonization and Trade would sell raw silk, silk goods, tea, porcelain, medicinal materials, and sundries to the Dutch East India Company. Both sides agreed on related prices. Specifically: 2,500 dan of raw silk at 110 taels per dan; 5,000 dan of refined white sugar at 4 taels per dan; 10,000 bolts of silk at an average price of 1.2 taels per bolt; and various other sundries. The Dutch East India Company would prepay 100,000 Spanish Reals for this to ensure Lingao could supply steadily in 1631.

The Dutch were not stingy about paying in advance in trade. It was precisely through prepaying deposits that the East India Company could obtain cheap and sufficient goods regardless of market fluctuations, making competitors unprofitable.

Because the matter was of great importance, Van der Lanthroon had no authority to formally sign such an agreement, so both sides only initialed it. Of course, this agreement alone made Van der Lanthroon so happy he didn't know where he was. This agreement was much more favorable than the unfulfilled supply agreement Governor Nauts, stationed at Tayouan, had signed with Zheng Zhilong a few years ago. Not only were prices reduced, but there was also growth in the supply quantity that had always troubled the East India Company.

The signing of this agreement alone could make Van der Lanthroon famous throughout Batavia. After all, this was the door to direct China trade that the Dutch East India Company had always dreamed of opening. Now it had actually been accomplished by this minor junior merchant—how could he not be overjoyed?

Of course, whether the agreement could be executed remained to be seen. But Van der Lanthroon didn't doubt that this group of "Australians" had the ability to accomplish it. If the entire agreement could be executed, his Van der Lanthroon's future in the Company would be bright indeed. He might even become a member of the Dutch East India Company's Batavia Council before long.

Van der Lanthroon worked hard to maintain his composure so as not to show his joy at the negotiating table. Skaed then made several special commodity requests.

Specifically, horse imports.

Throughout Southeast Asia and East Asia, horses were rare commodities. Not only were the breeds poor and the body sizes small, but the numbers were also insufficient. Nike had submitted a report to the Planning Institute requesting efforts to expand the number of horses to improve breeding efficiency. But he looked down on the Dian horses that could be obtained nearby. The Dian horse's small size and tragic pulling power made it of little use in Lingao's industry, agriculture, and military. Mongolian horses, while passable, could not be obtained in large quantities, and frankly everyone looked down on them too. The military and Agricultural Department both strongly called for obtaining quality riding horses and draft horses as soon as possible.

Obviously, relying on Nike and his apprentices and helpers at Gaoshan Ridge to do artificial insemination on their own, even if one stallion could cover 200 mares a year, but given the base number of horses, it would take many years of self-breeding to supply enough horses. Purchasing large quantities of horses from outside was obviously the only way. Moreover, their current stallion resources were not optimistic—besides a pair of Tieling draft horses, there was only one retired racehorse.

Although the various famous horses the Senators coveted were almost all on the other side of the globe, the biological department under the Agricultural Department confirmed that horses meeting Senator requirements were produced in Persia and India: they could be used as the currently urgently-needed riding horses and draft horses.

After research by the biological department under the Agricultural People's Committee, they believed several types of horses could be imported through the Dutch.

First was the Japanese Nanbu horse. This was a small strain from the "raiki" system produced locally in Japan, from northern Honshu. Adult horses could reach about 150cm at the shoulder, much taller and more robust than the average 120-130cm shoulder height of Mongolian horses. They could serve as either riding horses or draft horses. This type of horse had been purchased and used by the allied forces during the Second Opium War, becoming the horses for allied artillery and supply units. At that time, the allied forces purchased several thousand horses in Southeast Asia and Japan to supplement their forces and rated the Nanbu horse highest. This was the horse breed closest to Lingao that could provide a relatively large number of horses at once.

Another was the Marwari horse from India. This horse was said to be descended from crossbreeds of the warhorses used by Alexander's army, allegedly with Turkmen and Arabian horse bloodlines. It had evolved in India into a breed that could survive well in arid and barren terrain and was widely used on the Indian subcontinent as mounts for armies and nobility. The biggest advantage was that this horse was widely used on the Indian subcontinent, obviously giving it an advantage in adapting to Hainan Island's climate over other horse breeds.

Van der Lanthroon wasn't very interested in the business of transporting horses. Among goods transported across the sea, livestock were the hardest to transport. Horses were very sensitive animals that easily became startled and died during sea transport. They had high feed requirements and also needed large amounts of drinking water. Horses also took up a lot of cargo hold space. So although horses were expensive in East Asia, the East India Company still had little interest in transporting them.

Of course, since the Dutch were "sea coachmen," they wouldn't refuse any goods their customers needed. The East India Company had even transported elephants in Southeast Asia—of course, not because the Dutch needed them. Now that the Australians who had promised to open the golden door of trade with China needed horses, the East India Company would do its duty and would go through fire and water to get them. Furthermore, Skaed had already made clear that "generous prices" would be given for horses.

"This matter—I will most certainly do my utmost for Your Excellency." Van der Lanthroon said respectfully.

Transporting Nanbu horses temporarily posed difficulties—the Hirado trading post was currently closed. But transporting Indian horses wasn't a problem. The Company originally had trade routes going to India and trading posts there. Additionally, he could also request the Persia trading post to purchase some horses. Of course, horses from both places weren't cheap.

"Of course, of course." Skaed nodded. "Of course, besides these several types of horses, I know Europe has many excellent horse breeds..."

"It will take a very long time." Van der Lanthroon said. "If you need European horses, I will only be able to deliver horses to you at least three and a half to four years from now. And frankly speaking, I'm afraid the price will be unacceptably high."

"Indeed." Skaed sighed with regret. "But I still hope to get some good European horses." He then submitted a list of breeding horses.

Van der Lanthroon took it and glanced at it. He stared in surprise for several minutes. It listed the excellent horse breeds common in Europe. The list was very complete. Light, medium to heavy; warm-blooded and cold-blooded alike. There were many that even Van der Lanthroon himself didn't know.

"Good Lord!" Van der Lanthroon muttered quietly. "You have quite studied horses."

"We really like horses. Unfortunately, there aren't enough good horses here." Skaed laughed heartily. "As long as you bring me the horses alive and kicking, the price is negotiable. Oh, and I don't want geldings. All the horses must be young, not over 2 years old. And fertile."

"I will do my utmost to serve Your Excellency." Van der Lanthroon bowed respectfully. "I am Your Excellency's faithful servant."

That evening, Skaed hosted a reception to celebrate the trade agreement between both sides. Skaed was beaming. Reaching a trade agreement with the Dutch was very advantageous for Lingao. First, it effectively alleviated gaps in material supply. Second, the other party shipped at their own expense, delivering to the door—this was the best return for Lingao, which was severely short of transport capacity. And this entrepôt trade move, he believed, fundamentally solved the "foreign exchange" problem. Not to mention that the Dutch had also promised to first pay an advance of 100,000 Reals. Of course, Skaed had many more ideas about entrepôt trade.

As for reaching an agreement with the Dutch to purchase horses, although this was greatly appreciated by the Agricultural Department and the military, Skaed felt it was insignificant—this was after all just a small flourish on the cake. Without horses there would be no developmental stagnation, but without grain, timber, and these specified catalog commodities, the impact would be on the whole situation.

Van der Lanthroon attended the reception in the newly decorated trading house hall. The brilliant light emitted by the electric lamps and the large quantities of exquisite glassware and bone china used at the banquet left him dumbstruck. Although the banquet was not large, as a junior merchant of the East India Company, being hosted at a banquet by a high official who was one of the nine members of the Senate's Executive Committee made this minor noble from Zeeland feel extremely honored. After all, in Batavia, he didn't even have the qualification to attend the Governor's small banquets. Van der Lanthroon guzzled large quantities of rum mixed with sugar and fruit juice at the reception, and finally passed out and was carried out.
