# Chapter 1985 - A Counterfeit Bill

"Mm... Brother Yu, you thought wrong. How could I not know how much food can be sold in this Guangzhou city. The big head is in our Fubo Army..."

"Military supplies?!"

"Exactly. Not hiding from brothers, since my Great World shop opened, goods for the street actually decreased. Some old customers even said I'm unkind, deliberately hiking prices. Actually no, just Chief Hong's orders almost stuffed me to death..."

"Hahaha... Good! Stuffed to death is better than starved to death. Drink one!"

"Cheers!" "Cheers!" "Cheers!"

"Fubo Army eats walnut cakes too? Dear me, this treatment..."

"Not at all," Zhang Yu shook his head, "Walnut cakes have lard, white flour, walnuts, and sugar... none cheap. Soldiers eating a few as reward is fine; satisfying hunger every day is something even Senator Hong can't afford... The orders are for military rations, things soldiers eat as dry rations usually. Not as exquisite as tea refreshments, emphasizing satisfying hunger and not spoiling. Recipes also came from Senator Hong. But producing this, capital consumption is too heavy. Not only building factory needs loans, this production also relies on loans to turn over."

"Capital consumption so heavy, does relying on loans for turnover work?" Zeng Juan understood some economics and was a bit worried.

"I plan this way. With the Senate's spirit, going north and south to expand territory is a sure thing. Troops and horses haven't moved, food and grass go first. Chief Hong said more than once that opening factories is for oneself and also for the Senate. Convenient for both public and private; Australian saying is Win-Win. I thought buying land and machines also needs hiring masters from Lingao to teach. That Australian Secret Method book, called something 'Standard,' is much thicker than the Civil Servant Exam Guide I gave Ah Juan. I also begged Chief Hong to help find an accountant knowing Australian bookkeeping from Lingao. The current accounting room is completely incompatible with this set and Australian secret methods. Right now military supplies are tight; Chief Hong allowed me to use goods to offset payments. Brothers, I calculated privately; deducting everything, there's about 0.5 fen [5%] profit left..."

"Ah Yu, then aren't you working for free?"

"No, I told Chief Hong, I'll drop again. Just want 0.2 fen profit. Just allow me to print my family brand on the inner packaging."

"0.2 fen for this?" Everyone felt it was somewhat not worthwhile.

"Ah Juan told me, Chiefs' books state clearly: Brand is also money, and big money. We are not ignorant of this logic. Old saying calls it 'Gold Lettered Signboard,' and there's the story of the manager saving the signboard first when an old shop catches fire. Isn't it this logic?"

"Right! We all heard of this. Said to be a matter in the Capital!"

"But here, we only know 'Wine fragrance fears no deep alley,' guarding the gold signboard waiting for customers. Don't know how to use this signboard to make big money—Chief Hong said there's a big brand in Australia called 'Cola.' Wherever Australian troops are, there are his drinks. Although sold extremely cheap, a losing business, as long as where Australian troops pass, the trend of drinking 'Cola' rises locally. Compared to those capitals spent supplying troops cheaply, don't know how many times it earns back. I want to be this Huaxia's 'Cola'; wherever Fubo Army is, there is my Zhang Brand!"

"Ah Yu, ambitious. But your entire life and fortune are in this one bet; isn't it too risky."

"Hehe, Ziyu don't laugh. I'm just coincidental and thanks to Ah Xin's blessing to have the current situation. Every time I look back, this year passed like a dream. Even if truly lost, treat it as waking from a dream. Not that I belittle myself, Ah Juan, tell the truth, how do I compare with Master Gao?"

"Your momentum is strong, but looking at the whole board, still worse than Gao Ju by more than a little."

"More than a little? Simply cloud and mud difference! What am I, Zhang Yu? Look at Master Gao, representing Chiefs in Guangzhou since the Senate first appeared in Lingao, selling goods locally, mediating in official circles for Chiefs... exerted great effort. Saying he is the Senate's Number One Meritorious Official in Guangzhou is not excessive. Me? Just a second generation of an unrated small shop. Family had no money, studying didn't work. Regarding ancestral shade, seniority, connections, assets, etc., which one can compare to big merchants like Master Gao? Only one thing: though my seniority is shallow, I was cultivated by Chiefs single-handedly. As long as I follow the Senate wholeheartedly, working for the Senate dead set, I can surpass old big households like Gao Ju who rely on wealth, keeping distance, seeming close yet far!"

"Right, the Senate never treats its own people unfairly, never. Ah Yu, formidable! Seeing through clearly. Come, brothers toast Ah Yu a cup!"

The brothers ate and drank, making merry. Until the sky was turning dark, the waiter came to deliver fruits with an excuse, tactfully reminding them: "Night session is about to open; do masters want to extend the hour?" Only then did they scatter.

Several people fought to pay the bill. Zhang Yu laughed: "Agreed I'm the host; how can I let you spend money!" Saying so, he forcefully shooed them to the main gate, waving a hand slightly tipsily.

The Spaniard at the door understood the situation at a glance, hurriedly leaned up asking: "Want cars?"

"Right! Three!" Zhang Yu shouted unconsciously loud.

"Doesn't Your Excellency want a car for yourself?"

"I... no need! My home isn't far! Walking back..."

Seeing his face red with intoxication, the Spaniard knew he had wine in him. Saying no more, he called three "Venus Zero Type" rickshaws from the wall base immediately.

Zhang Yu helped brothers onto rickshaws one by one, paid the fare, then walked unsteadily back to the service desk in the lobby, preparing to settle the bill.

The bill was already copied clearly item by item in small script, summing up the total price. Although Purple Light Pavilion's prices were high, it emphasized "clearly marked prices." What item, what service, what price, all were marked one by one. Although some prices were "outrageous" in the eyes of market commoners, they absolutely wouldn't ask random prices.

Those willing to consume in Purple Light Pavilion naturally could afford this premium.

Zhang Yu scanned the end of the bill—it was within his expectation. He took out several Silver Dollar Circulation Notes from his pocket. Handed onto the table.

The cashier clerk took them in hand. Just about to put them in, suddenly his face changed, whispering: "This Master... your money, is not right."

"What?!" Zhang Yu had some wine rush, momentarily didn't understand what was going on: What's wrong with money?

"This money! Has problem." The clerk handed one of the bills to his eyes. "This is fake! The paper quality is also wrong."

"Fake?!" Zhang Yu sobered up completely now. Losing one yuan was nothing to him now, but he understood the weight of the four words "Using Counterfeit Currency"—especially now when the Senate was promoting new currency, taking counterfeit currency matters very seriously. Days ago, people were sent specifically to preach to merchants everywhere to pay attention to counterfeit currency. Unexpectedly, he spent one himself, and at this place, Purple Light Pavilion!

"This, this, I don't know where it came from..." Zhang Yu hurriedly explained, "I didn't mean it! Really!"

Seeing his nervous face, the clerk hurriedly comforted: "One who doesn't know is not guilty; you didn't mean it either. This counterfeit bill can't be returned to you—according to rules, it must be confiscated and turned in. You also have to register—this is also the regulation of the police!"

Zhang Yu was uneasy in his heart. After finishing procedures, sitting on a rickshaw, he started calculating: where exactly did this fake money come from?

Since the Australians started issuing Silver Dollars and Silver Dollar Circulation Notes in Guangzhou, Zhang Brand was one of the earliest shops to accept and use them. Because they started using checks for business payments long ago, many customers were still used to using cash, especially at the retail counter. The amount of Silver Dollars and Circulation Notes entering and leaving daily was not small. According to custom, he didn't handle this cash. It was counted and accounted for by the accountant and cashier daily, then deposited into the bank account. If there was a problem, it would have been discovered in finance.

Speaking of spending in his hands, the accountant wrote checks monthly—expenses on accounts were first "salary," second "entertainment expenses." Both fees were withdrawn directly from the bank with checks he wrote; there wouldn't be counterfeit currency. if counterfeit currency came to his hand, it could only be when getting change. But this one-yuan circulation note was the largest denomination bill; it couldn't be obtained from change...

"Strange, where did this fake money come from?" Zhang Yu wondered secretly.

Midday in early summer Guangzhou, the blazing sun was like fire. Pedestrians on the streets were sparse; even beggars without a tile over their heads had to find cool shade. Now there were no beggars in the Australians' Guangzhou city. The Police Bureau promoted "Catching Drifters" normalized management. Vagrants and beggars discovered were taken in, sent to labor centers—this was the Police Bureau's standard operating procedure. Every week a dedicated personnel transport ship sailed to the "Labor Purification Camp" set up in Hong Kong.

Zeng Juan, Tax Administrator of Great Song Guangzhou Special City Finance and Tax Bureau, walked swiftly with his team against the heat wave, attracting whispers from shop assistants watching shops on the roadside. These Australians were truly harsh to subordinates; in such hot weather, not even allowing a breath of rest, not even a cool sedan chair. What's the point of being this Senate official?

Wiping sweat beads already flowing to eyelashes randomly, Zeng Juan involuntarily raised the document file in his right hand to fan twice. The bag in his hand was very light, containing only a few receipts and declaration copies. This was the main target of Zeng Juan's household investigation today, Master Luo's Noble Gathering.

After Huang Ping transferred away at the beginning of the year, Zeng Juan acted as team leader for a period with the identity of deputy team leader. In the month following the successful conclusion of the first quarter collection work, he was officially appointed as team leader. This appointment was both unexpected and reasonable. Unexpectedly, Zeng Juan was just a new civil servant and an old scholar, yet was promoted to the team leader position almost monopolized by Lingao naturalized citizens in just over half a year, which was rare. Reasonably, with Australians' nature of testing everything, as a "study tyrant" ranking top three in both the resumption big exam and the first-quarter business exam, plus the seniority of deputy team leader, sitting in this position wasn't abrupt.
