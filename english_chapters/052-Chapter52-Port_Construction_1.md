Chapter 52 Port Construction (1)

Although there was a minor episode of stowaways, the construction of the port could not stop.

According to the plan, the Transmigrators needed to build a temporary wharf at Bopu Harbor first to facilitate the unloading of large equipment and materials.

Mei Lin, the leader of the Construction Group, took the command personally.

"We want to build a floating wharf here." Mei Lin pointed to a calm water area on the drawing, "Using the concrete floating boxes we made before, connected together, and then paving wooden boards on top."

"This is simple and fast." Wang Luobin agreed, "But we need pile drivers to fix the floating boxes."

"We have pile drivers." Mei Lin said, "Manual ones. Although slow, they are usable."

So, dozens of Transmigrators, shouting work songs, began to drive piles on the beach.

"Heave-ho! Heave-ho!"

Under the scorching sun, their skin was tanned and sweat soaked their clothes. But no one complained.

Because they knew that every pile driven was a foundation for the new world.

While building the wharf, the road construction work was also proceeding simultaneously.

They needed to build a simple road from the wharf to the campsite to transport materials.

"We don't have asphalt or concrete." A member of the Construction Group said worriedly.

"Use sand and gravel." Mei Lin said, "There are plenty of sand and stones on the beach. Mix them with clay and roll them compact. It's a sand-gravel road."

"Although not as good as a highway, it's enough for tractors and ox carts to run."

So, excavators and bulldozers roared, leveling the land. Transmigrators pushed wheelbarrows to transport sand and stones.

In a few days, a winding sand-gravel road appeared on the desolate beach.

Looking at this road, Wen Desi was filled with emotion.

"This is the road to the future." He said.
