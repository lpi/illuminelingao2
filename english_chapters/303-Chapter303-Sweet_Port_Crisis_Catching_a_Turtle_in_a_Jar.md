# Chapter 303 - Sweet Port Crisis: Catching a Turtle in a Jar

Night slowly descended from the sky, enveloping the harbor. The sea breeze stirred a thin mist rising from the water—a common phenomenon in Lingao during early summer. The fog thickened, wrapping docks, wharves, shores, islands, and factory buildings in a soft veil of gauze. Only the faint glow of lamps within the buildings remained dimly visible.

Wu De glanced at the luminous dial of his watch: eight o'clock in the evening. The lights near the Navy shipyard burned especially bright, and the rumble of steam engines could still be heard. That was the sound of cargo being loaded onto the *Great Whale*. The four smoothbore cannons that were to be installed on the ship had arrived at Bopu during the day. To avoid attracting attention, the loading would take place at night at the shipyard dock, carried out solely by naval marines without any laborers.

According to the plan, the *Great Whale* would erect walls of sand-filled burlap sacks, with rice or sugar sacks stacked on the outside as cover. Hidden within would be several cannons and two platoons of marines. The moment the enemy approached, the cannons would open fire on the pirate ships. By the descriptions of the *Guangbing*'s crew, the pirates' vessels were all small- to medium-sized coastal craft; a few cannonballs would certainly send them to the bottom.

If the pirates deployed only one or two ships, this plan, with the firepower the *Great Whale* was about to receive, would be simple and effective. But if the enemy brought many ships, the surprise of the initial salvo could only be achieved once. After firing, the cannons would need time to reload and aim. Any ships not hit could scatter and attack from multiple directions to neutralize the ship's firepower. The *Great Whale* was not a motorized vessel—slow and clumsy. If small boats swarmed it and the fight devolved into close-quarters boarding combat, the numerical advantage would favor the enemy. Or, if the enemy, shaken by the *Great Whale*'s firepower, turned and fled, the *Great Whale* lacked the speed to pursue, and the engagement would end as a mere rout. Clearly, relying solely on the *Great Whale* was insufficient; other ships would need to operate in coordination.

But if too many ships were deployed, the cunning pirates might withdraw their feelers, Obviously, no matter what approach the Navy took, the fundamental condition for victory—"the initiative"—remained in the pirates' hands.

Spread before him was a fifty-times magnification of the area around Hai'an Street on a 1:100,000 nautical chart, showing the distribution of islets, reefs, and sandbars. This region was dotted with islands and rocks of all sizes, forming countless winding channels and hidden straits. Such an environment was ideal for pirates using small, nimble craft.

After a moment of thought, he picked up the phone and called Li Di:  
"Is the *Dengyingzhou* in port?"

"Yes, sir."

"Summon that, uh, Wang—" Wu De suddenly recalled that everyone called the first mate of the *Dengyingzhou* "Wang Big Beard." "—the first mate to headquarters!"

"Wang Big Beard? Right away."

Soon, Wang Big Beard arrived. As for his beard—the Navy was divided into two factions: one believed it looked quite handsome, very "British," and urged him to keep it; the other insisted beards were unsanitary and that soldiers should be clean-shaven. The debate remained unresolved, so Wang Big Beard's beard persisted. After a voyage, crew members were entitled to a few days' rest, and he appeared clean and sharp. His Year-One pattern naval uniform suited him well, shedding any trace of his former pirate image.

"Based on your pirating experience, if you were to intercept ships going in and out of Hai'an Street harbor, where would you strike?" Wu De pointed to the chart. "Assume absolute security is required, and enemy vessels may have escorts."

Wang Big Beard studied the chart carefully—these exquisitely detailed maps no longer surprised him.

"Here." He tapped a cluster of black dots.

Wu De looked closely: a place called "Chrysanthemum Islets." Not true islands, just a jumble of rocks breaking the surface. The location sat directly on the approach to Hai'an Street harbor.

He nodded. The *Guangbing* had been attacked about four nautical miles southeast of this very area. Wang Big Beard's experience was accurate.

"Why this spot?" Wu De asked, as similar reef clusters existed elsewhere nearby.

"The conditions here are best. Lots of islets and rocks, all jumbled together—easy to hide ships. Just anchor behind the Outer Islets, post a lookout on the rocks, and when a ship comes through, you can dash out and catch them off guard. If the enemy has escorts too strong to fight, you simply cut through the Outer Islets and flee. The channels are many, the reefs dense, the water full of hidden sandbars. Any pursuing ship unfamiliar with the route will run aground instantly."

"Mm. And if we want to capture these pirates, what should we do?"

"Best to hide ships at the Inner Islets beforehand," Wang Big Beard said without hesitation. "Unless the pirates don't plan to escape via the Outer Islets, the Cat's Leap Pass between the Inner and Outer Islets is their only route. Station an armed vessel there to block them, and you can attack from both sides. No matter what skills they have, they won't escape."

"Very good." Wu De realized that just looking at the chart, he would never have known this mere cluster of dots concealed so many nuances.

"But the Inner Islets are very difficult to enter," Wang Big Beard cautioned. "The channels are too complex. Only small skiffs can go in safely. Larger vessels risk hitting reefs or running aground."

"What's the largest ship that can get through?"

Wang Big Beard shook his head. "Two hundred *liao* at most. The currents inside are chaotic and the sandbars many."

"Are you familiar with the approach?"

"Well…" Wang Big Beard hesitated.

"Speak honestly," Wu De said. "This mission is critical. Complete it successfully and you'll be commended!"

"Yes, sir," Wang Big Beard said, coming to attention in a less-than-perfect stance. "I have been inside, only once. I still remember some of the channel markers."

"Good. Prepare yourself. Report to the shipyard dock."

The next day, Wu De busied himself selecting weapons and personnel. For this operation, he decided not to draw on any transmigrators—it would be entirely a formed unit of the Navy's native troops. That evening, he and Wang Big Beard boarded a hundred-*liao* single-masted vessel and set out personally to reconnoiter Chrysanthemum Islets.

To minimize their profile, they brought only seven or eight sailors, plus two officer candidates from the first batch promoted for training—no one else. For safety, the boat was temporarily fitted with an outboard motor from one of the motorboats.

The vessel sailed for several hours through the night. Nearing midnight, Wu De estimated they were close to their destination—the Chrysanthemum Islets, just outside Hai'an Street harbor.

The sea was calm, the moon bright. The boat had lowered its sails and was now being sculled slowly forward.

"Spotted anything?" he asked Wang Big Beard, who was observing from behind a barricade at the bow.

"Not yet. Should be soon." Wang Big Beard watched the sea intently. His eyes had now adjusted to the darkness, and with the telescope, he could roughly make out objects within three hundred meters.

The reconnaissance vessel pressed on.

"Black shapes ahead," Wang Big Beard called softly. "Mind the speed!"

At this point, what appeared before Wu De was not just a few dark specks but a whole cluster of them. The crew tensed. Had they gone off course? The chart showed nothing like this strange jumble of small reefs and islets!

"All stop!" Wu De ordered quickly.

The vessel rapidly slowed, gliding forward on momentum. Wu De checked the compass bearing and went below to the cabin, switched on a flashlight, and carefully compared the chart. But the chart showed no such peculiar markings. Had sea conditions changed so drastically in four hundred years? The compass heading, ship's course, and calculated position were all correct. He thought for a moment, then recalculated the tidal schedule. That was it—this was the lowest tide, coinciding with a full moon, so many unnamed rocks had broken the surface. Such non-navigational waters would naturally not have been surveyed with great precision, and four hundred years had passed since then. Even meticulously measured channels would be unrecognizable after so long. The only option now was to use a sounding line, probing passage by passage as they entered Chrysanthemum Islets.

The Outer Islets were relatively open, but reefs abounded.

"Tide's low," Wang Big Beard said. "Normally, most of these rocks are submerged. A hundred-*liao* boat like ours can pass safely if we're careful."

Wu De surveyed the sea conditions and privately acknowledged that bringing Wang Big Beard as advisor had been the right call. Any large vessel chasing into this area without local knowledge would almost certainly run aground.

"Entering the Inner Islets now," Wang Big Beard said tensely.

The reconnaissance vessel passed a dark rock and turned into a narrow channel. It crept along like an old donkey, stopping and starting, while the sailors held their breath and strained their eyes at the bizarre rocks jutting up from the seabed all around. They gripped pike poles and oars, ready to respond to any emergency.

The currents within the channel were wildly erratic. The oarsmen exerted all their strength to keep from being swept onto the rocks. Wang Big Beard recalled the route he had once traveled, guiding the vessel's course. Sometimes he had to study a particular rock for a while to confirm it was the right landmark.

After nearly an hour of this halting progress, they finally entered the cramped Inner Islets and then slowly made for Cat's Leap Pass—two massive rocks. The gap between them was so narrow that a two-hundred-*liao* ship could barely squeeze through.

"This is Cat's Leap Pass," Wang Big Beard pointed to the two rocks. "They say even a cat can jump across."

Wu De nodded. "And beyond this is the Outer Islets?"

"Yes. Once pirates go through here, they can exit the Inner Islets via other channels. Supposedly there are seven or eight such channels, all navigable for ships of one or two hundred *liao*—but only with a guide."

"Then why didn't we enter the Inner Islets from this side?"

"I don't know this stretch—" Wang Big Beard was frank. "I've heard the waters near Cat's Leap Pass on the Outer Islets side have several shifting sandbars. Anyone unfamiliar with the local hydrology will probably run aground."

Wu De ordered the reconnaissance vessel into a narrow channel and found a rocky beach where they could moor. They cast the iron anchor onto the rocks, jamming it into a crevice, and secured the ship.

The entire Chrysanthemum Islets were shaped, as the name suggested, like a chrysanthemum blossom scattered across the sea. The tiny islets and reefs between them created countless strange, jumbled channels and inlets, some almost too small to call bays. At low tide, large ships simply couldn't maneuver among them. Only the waters of the Outer Islets were relatively broad.

Wu De took Wang Big Beard and one sailor and climbed up the nameless islet. A pair of binoculars hung around his neck, and he wore an oilskin raincoat. The three men scrambled upward, startling seabirds and lizards into scattering. Wu De paused to check for any movement on the surrounding sea.

The entire Chrysanthemum Islets were utterly silent; only distant fishing lights flickered. Seeing nothing amiss, he led the party upward.

Halfway up the islet, a thick layer of wet, carpet-like moss covered the slope. Each footstep produced a squelching sound like a wet sponge. On steeper sections, it was dangerously slippery, and they nearly fell several times. Higher up, the ground leveled into a relatively flat clearing, overgrown with thorny bushes. Dense stiff grasses and fallen dead branches wove together into a natural hedge. The sailor cut a path with his machete, and they reached a relatively level area near the cliff edge. The full moon hung overhead; moonlight glittered on the water. The entire Cat's Leap Pass spread out below them.

The vantage point was excellent, Wu De thought. An observation post could be placed here. Suddenly, an idea flashed into his mind. Wasn't this a far better firing position than any hundred- or two-hundred-*liao* ship?

A small patrol craft could mount only light cannons, and not many at that. Trying to block and intercept here would not give them firepower superiority. Since the Chrysanthemum Islets had so many small islets, why not exploit them? Why not emplace cannons on the rocks themselves? Excited by his own idea, he surveyed the area.

He estimated the angle, then examined the surroundings. Though this slope was slightly tilted, it was gentle enough that with a little leveling, medium guns could be mounted. The space was ample—three or four twelve-pounder artillery crews could be accommodated, along with a small infantry detachment for protection.

Gazing across at the opposite shore, he spotted several more potential gun positions. One or two cannons here, one or two there—totaling more than seven twelve-pounders, all creating interlocking fields of fire. Cannon shots from fixed rock positions would be far more accurate than from a pitching ship. With one or two vessels blocking Cat's Leap Pass, any pirate ship reaching this point would be caught like a turtle in a jar. Not a single one would escape.

"Summon the officer candidates!" Wu De ordered. "Have them conduct mapping exercises here and plot surrounding reference landmarks!"

After issuing the order, he descended to the ship and radioed Lingao with his plan.

"Request Chief of Staff Ma coordinate this matter," he added at the end of the message.
