# Chapter 115 - Breaking the Stockade

The plan was set, and the entire organization started operating accordingly. Although the military group had the largest number of people among all groups, they were responsible for security in quite a few places, so only thirty people were mobilized to participate this time. The rest were drawn from other groups. Everyone was bored to death working on shore. Going to fight this time was equivalent to an outing plus distraction. Everyone signed up enthusiastically. Soon there were more than two hundred and fifty people. Some people knew the news late and found the quota full when they went, so they hurriedly asked people to intercede everywhere. For a time, the front of the dormitories of Wu De, He Ming, and others was crowded like a market.

Wu De screened the applicants. Those with weak constitutions, mastering a unique technology, or older were all rejected. Only young and strong ones were wanted. A total of one hundred soldiers were selected. Because the opponents mainly used cold weapons, protective gear appeared very important. The ten assault team members preparing to participate in delivering explosive packs and assaulting each wore a set of armed police riot gear and carried ten anti-riot steel shields. Although this thing couldn't withstand modern rifle fire, blocking local cannons, bows, and arrows was no problem. Wu Nanhai organized women and the entire agricultural group to make dry rations. Because his various trial-produced dry rations all received negative results, finally, at Aunt Cao's suggestion, since they were only going for one or two days and didn't need long storage, they might as well make some pancakes. With oil and salt, they wouldn't spoil for one or two days. So she demonstrated, and a group of people mixed batter, chopped green onions, and tended the fire. Soon more than a hundred jin of pancakes were prepared, held in newly woven baskets, and carried by draft animals accompanying the team. The agricultural group accompanied a support team, using draft animals to carry pots for boiling water, pots for cooking rice, and some extra food. The health group also organized a medical team, bringing various emergency surgical instruments and medical supplies. They had the best treatment among all teams, specially equipped with an agricultural vehicle. The health center in Bairen City also made preparations for surgery.

The reconnaissance team set off before the main force. As soon as it got dark the next day, they carried radios and set up a forward command post on a small hill outside the stockade. Six snipers selected by the military group also came with the team. Wu De assigned one sniper with two scouts, divided into six groups, dispersed around the stockade to control the people entering and leaving: his order was simple, Gou Family Stockade was allowed entry but not exit. People coming out from the main gate were to be captured if possible, and those jumping over the wall were to be shot without exception. Completely isolate it from the inside out. The snipers used Saiga-308 rifles. This semi-automatic rifle using 7.62mm NATO rounds was very suitable for this task in both range and power. With specialized sights, hitting a living person a kilometer away was not a problem.

Wu De, who commanded this operation, arrived first. After dispatching various sniper teams, he sat down on a fishing chair in the command post. This command post was just a clearing opened up in the woods, surrounded by barbed wire on four sides. A shading lamp was lit inside the tent. The situation map and surrounding topographic map drawn by Xue Ziliang were enlarged and spread on the folding table. Beside it was a 15W radio, communicating with Bairen City with flashing lights.

At night, the main force arrived successively and dispersed to hide under the hillside. The first organization of a large night march went very smoothly. Using night vision equipment and fluorescent identification strips, more than two hundred people including combat personnel and logistics personnel, and many mules and horses arrived safely and on time. No one fell behind or went missing on the road. He asked the logistics group people to quickly organize boiling water for washing feet. He talked with several commanders for a while, instructing them to pay attention to discipline after breaking the stockade tomorrow to avoid looting and indiscriminate killing. Subsequently, he told everyone to rest early and sat by the table himself waiting for other follow-up teams to arrive. This was the first time the transmigrators took the initiative to attack in the more than two months since landing. With their technology and firepower level, breaking this stockade was as easy as catching a turtle in a jar.

According to the estimates of him and several intelligence personnel combining information from various aspects, Gou Family Stockade had at least one or two thousand shi of coarse and fine grain stored. Silver coins, cloth, jewelry, and ornaments were of course also considerable. Thinking that breaking the stockade would be of great benefit to the transmigrators, his heart secretly felt excited.

But then he thought that with more treasure, it would inevitably cause problems of interest distribution. Would someone see money and embezzle property? Would anyone raise different views on the current distribution system or the personnel managing property? He had seen things where people could share poverty but not wealth. Thinking that unknown numbers of people would be killed in the entire attack process, many of whom were innocent, his heart felt uncomfortable again. He didn't think highly of the so-called quality of civilized people. Once on the battlefield, red-eyed, they could do anything.

At a little past six in the morning, the sky was already somewhat bright. Xi Yazhou also reported that they had organized the common people of Salt Field Village and set off to come and carry things. The common people hadn't received military training like them, nor did they have night vision equipment, and many suffered from night blindness, so they only set off when the sky was slightly bright.

Wu De queried the observation station in the suburbs of the county again. It reported no abnormal movement in the county town. The sniper teams waiting outside all night also reported no abnormalities. He asked Yuan Qiushi, who was on duty outside the tent—this young lad had now become his full-time guard and orderly: "Is everyone up?"

"Already up. Some are asking where to brush teeth and wash faces!"

"Still brushing teeth and washing faces!" Wu De laughed, "Go, tell everyone: brush teeth and wash faces after fighting into the stockade. Eat immediately, prepare for battle!"

While chewing a pancake and drinking cold water, Wu De walked out of the tent, observed the lights on the city wall with binoculars, listened to the watchman's drum, and then announced assembling the team. He explained the battle plan of how to break Gou Family Stockade clearly to all combat members, assigned different tasks to each combat group, and finally said:

"After entering the stockade, make sure to remember four things clearly: First, no killing innocent people; second, no raping women; third, no burning houses casually; fourth, no hiding war trophies privately!" He paused, "I won't mention the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Most of you haven't been trained in the army in the past. Just one point, don't forget you are still civilized people! Don't do things worse than beasts."

Someone in the team made sarcastic remarks: "Please, just those dark and thin women who haven't bathed all year round? I wouldn't dare to rape even if she begged!"

Another person said: "Is it being a beast or being worse than a beast?" The people around burst into laughter.

This burst of laughter made him understand that although this group of people was armed to the teeth, they were at best a group of common people. He said no more. The movement here should have been noticed by the stockade. Delay leads to trouble; start attacking immediately.

Shortly after the fifth watch was struck, the watchman on the gate of Gou Family Stockade just extinguished the wind lantern for the night when he heard footsteps and coughing sounds from afar. Everyone immediately became alert, woke up those dozing companions, waited together, and looked out from the battlements. Lingao often had much fog in the early morning, and the distance was not very clear. Seeing shadows in the fog and night, the number of people was not small. A stockade guard asked loudly:

"Where are the troops from?"

The transmigration army had approached to a place 200 meters away from the stockade gate. Wu De asked everyone to stop. Each group occupied positions according to the division of labor and quickly dug shelters for themselves with entrenching shovels without making a sound—not afraid of enemy fire, but guarding against fragments from the explosion. Seeing he had been discovered, he didn't answer but immediately fired a signal flare.

Seeing the signal flare fired, the ten people of the demolition team ran wildly towards the gate with explosive packs on their backs at the speed of a hundred-meter dash. These people were selected from volunteers, not only physically strong but also masters of the hundred-meter dash. Although Zhang Berlin didn't succeed with the Berlin Cannon, demolition was passable. He volunteered to be the demolition man carrying explosives, and others carried semi-automatic rifles.

The watchman on the enemy tower saw no answer from that side, and a dazzling green ball of light flew out from the fog. Knowing it was bad, he hurriedly beat the gong.

"Bad news, someone is attacking the stockade! Attacking the stockade!"

Following the urgent gong sound, the village braves keeping watch in the sheds under the enemy towers hurriedly climbed up. While loading powder into cannons and wall guns (jingals), they leaned out, trying hard to see the enemy in the fog. Just as they were looking, a volley of gunshots came from the fog. Four or five village braves on the enemy towers on both sides screamed and fell. The rest hurriedly shrank behind the battlements. The next volley of shots directly penetrated the brick walls of the battlements. After a few rounds of volleys, there was not a single intact person on the enemy towers; bodies lay in disorder on the ground. The leaders below hurriedly urged village braves and family guards from everywhere to gather at the stockade gate, preparing to fight.

However, these dozen seconds were enough for the demolition team to run under the stockade gate. The explosive packs were tied with bamboo poles to ensure they could fully prop against the gate. Because there were no electric detonators or exploders, the three black powder fuses on the explosives were all detonated by safety fuses. According to the length calculated by the formula found in books, that fuse should detonate in two minutes, enough for the person lighting the fire to run to a safe place.

The fuse was indeed ignited, and all team members ran to a safe place and lay down together. Two minutes passed, no explosion. Two minutes and thirty seconds, still no explosion. Three minutes, still no explosion! The troops lying behind the earth mounds were all anxious and sweating. If the stockade gate couldn't be blown open, everyone would have to prepare to climb the wall and storm it.

"Damn, what is this thing!" Zhang Berlin lifted his head from behind the earth mound very unhappily.

At that instant, the explosives exploded. A flash of fire, and a dull explosion shook the ground so much that it trembled. Many people were shaken dizzy, their internal organs churning. Then various broken bricks, soil clods, and wood chips flew around and fell with crackling sounds.

Zhang Berlin felt a clang on his head; a brick fell. Just as he was rejoicing that he wore a helmet, suddenly his cheek felt cool, then burning hot. He touched his head; his hand was full of blood. He was stunned for a while, then started shivering involuntarily. "Close, close call, almost became a martyr."

Wu De calmed down. The stockade gate was completely shrouded in the smoke and dust raised by the explosion. Of the enemy towers on both sides, one was completely invisible, and half of the other had collapsed. The wooden stockade gate had definitely turned into flying ash and smoke. He waved his hand: "Blow the horn to charge!"
