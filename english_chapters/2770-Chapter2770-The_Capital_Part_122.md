# Chapter 2770: The Capital (Part 122)

With the key points determined, the arrest of Zhou Lezhi was quickly put at the top of the agenda. Xu Ke reported the relevant intelligence to the Center and soon received a reply telegram authorizing him to "act at his discretion."

This meant that if the arrest failed, on-the-spot execution was permitted. In a subsequent telegram, he was also required to do a good job of "material recovery"; if conditions did not allow, then "comprehensive disinfection" (destruction).

As for Liu Sha, all his requests were approved. At the same time, it was ordered that after the arrest operation ended, Liu Sha was to be transported to Guangzhou via sea route.

The telegram issued in the name of the Security Affairs Joint Conference also approved him to have command authority over North Zhili and Shandong, allowing him to mobilize all Senate resources in the two regions at any time. The Reconnaissance Bureau would additionally deploy a detachment.

Seeing the telegram, Xu Ke did not dare to be negligent; the authorization showed the degree of importance the Senate attached to this matter. He immediately summoned the heads of various teams.

Xu Ke currently had three surveillance teams deployed, targeting Wang Yehao, Eunuch Yang, and Shopkeeper Shen of the Xiaji Shanxi House respectively.

Now he made adjustments. Eunuch Yang had nothing to do with the kidnapping case, and Little Eunuch Yang was purely an accidental interlude in the kidnapping case; there was no longer any need to spend energy on him. All surveillance and control on him were withdrawn.

As for Shopkeeper Shen of the Shanxi House, Xu Ke analyzed that although he obviously played an important role in the whole case, he had no contact with the core figures. He was merely a thug and ally; monitoring him had little significance. Therefore, surveillance on him was also withdrawn.

He redistributed all surveillance forces to focus on monitoring and controlling the Wang Yehao group. This included Wang himself, Jin Wenchi, and Wang's other trusted aides. Regarding these people and their frequent activity locations, Liu Sha provided a detailed explanation.

Judging from Liu Sha's confession, Mr. Le was active in the Capital most of the time. After all, he was an important aide to Wang Yehao. Wang Yehao had many major affairs that needed to be discussed with him, and according to Liu Sha's narration, it was very likely he also held the right of interpretation for the "Heavenly Book." This meant that unless there was a major matter requiring him to handle it personally, this person could not leave the Capital, nor could he go without contacting Wang Yehao for a long period. The contact between the two was quite frequent.

As long as they were still in frequent contact, following the vine to find the melon would lead to Zhou Lezhi's hiding place. Xu Ke did not think that with Zhou Lezhi's half-baked knowledge of secret work (mostly armchair strategy), he could defend against the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's surveillance—all surveillance personnel were professionally trained and had rich practical experience.

Secondly, there was the old Zhou residence at the Wanggong Factory. Although Liu Sha said that only Zhou Lezhi's concubines and children were left there, with no important people or items, Xu Ke believed that since it was Zhou Lezhi's old home, and the current "Mr. Le" was a disciple, there might still be some connection between the two. This was a possible breakthrough point.

Other directions naturally also had the possibility of finding an entry point, but Xu Ke believed their manpower was currently limited, so it was more advantageous to simply abandon those clues with smaller possibilities.

"This person is a key arrest target of the Senate," he said very solemnly to the team leaders. "Using the Great Ming's terminology, he is an imperial criminal. We must find out his specific whereabouts!"

Everyone nodded together to show understanding.

Min Zhanlian asked, "Can we continue to use the personnel from He Lian Sheng as support? Our manpower is limited, and they often use the 'Blossoming' mode to evade tracking..."

The so-called "Blossoming" was actually creating false arrays, such as carrying out multiple sedan chairs from the mansion simultaneously, or a large number of people coming out of the mansion at the same time, making the surveillance personnel unable to attend to everything.

This method was very old but extremely effective. Especially in the Capital, a place full of government eyes and ears, the surveillance personnel's own actions were greatly restricted and they couldn't act recklessly.

"...Moreover, most of our people are not locals. As soon as they open their mouths, people notice you are from out of town. Although there are the most out-of-towners in the Capital, it is ultimately inconvenient."

Xu Ke pondered for a moment and said, "The people of He Lian Sheng are relatively complex. They can only do some relatively peripheral work. If you want them to monitor Wang's residence, wouldn't it scare the wits out of them?"

"At least we can use a portion of them." Min Zhanlian still persisted in his idea. "Used in the right place, they are more useful than transferring people from Guangzhou."

"Good, I approve your suggestion." Xu Ke thought briefly and replied, "However, armed escorts won't do; they look too obvious. And deep down they are all 'good citizens'; they can't do this kind of dirty work. Fortunately, they have some other people we can use."

"If they are *jianghu* figures, that would be best. Those who can hang around in the Capital all have some capability and are familiar with the locality."

"I will arrange the personnel; you just arrange the relevant contact points."

"Wang Zhi," Zhou Lezhi suddenly called out.

"What is it, Master Le?" Wang Zhi was originally reading *The Smiling, Proud Wanderer* on the porch. Seeing the exciting part, he heard the call and hurriedly put down the book to come in.

"This New Year has passed in a chaotic mess." Zhou Lezhi said while flipping through the ledger on the table. "I didn't even go to the Wanggong Factory side!"

Mentioning "Wanggong Factory," a slightly nervous expression appeared on Wang Zhi's face. He whispered, "The Master ordered last time that you should try not to go there. Neither of the two women are easy to deal with. Once you go, they will ask about the Master (Zhou's teacher/original Zhou). How will you answer them?"

"How can I answer? Naturally, whereabouts unknown." Zhou Lezhi smiled bitterly. "I indeed do not know the Master's whereabouts."

"You know, but they don't. When they start crying and making a scene, how will you handle it?" Wang Zhi said. "There are also the two children. Have you forgotten the matter of them holding the children and kneeling to beg you last time? Adults crying and children making noise, disturbuing all the neighbors..."

"Sigh, sigh, sigh," Zhou Lezhi felt compassion upon hearing him mention past events. "The Master has the grace of recreating me. Now his whereabouts are unknown. Logically, I should take good care of the two mistress-mothers and the children. At least during New Year's and festivals, I should go to pay respects and say hello..."

"Whether you take care of them or not doesn't matter much." Wang Zhi was a servant of the Wang residence assigned to Zhou Lezhi's use, so naturally, he didn't have much reverence for him. "With Master Wang taking care of them, they won't lack anything. I can't say the mother and children are living in luxury with brocade garments and jade meals, but at least they are a well-off family with no worries about food and warmth. If you go see them, it will instead provoke their sadness. Why bother! Besides, if you see them, they won't gain a piece of meat; if you don't look, they won't lose a piece. What's the point of fulfillfing this empty courtesy?"

This speech left Zhou Lezhi speechless. He had to smile bitterly and say, "Who can talk as well as you! Since the Master's intention is to tell me to go less, I will go less. Just help me buy a few practical New Year's goods—not the kind of New Year's gift goods that look good but are useless—and send someone to deliver them to Wanggong Factory."

"This is easy." seeing he didn't insist, Wang Zhi also breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. "I wonder how much silver?"

"Twelve taels of silver." Zhou Lezhi said, then suddenly seemed to remember something and asked in a low voice, "Last time I heard You Rong was very restless?"

This somewhat gossipy question immediately piqued Wang Zhi's interest. He also lowered his voice: "Yes! I heard Daoist Wood-Stone say that You Rong made a fuss a few times, wanting to see Master Wang and asking him to find the Master."

"I roughly knew this." Zhou Lezhi frowned. "I wasn't asking about this..."

"This, this insignificant one is not clear about. However, she is different from Jie Yi. A woman from a musician household background, raised in places of wind and moon since childhood. Now that the Master has been missing for many years, it's natural for her to have some thoughts." Wang Zhi's hesitating words indicated he knew more than just this.

Zhou Lezhi understood his meaning. After hesitating for a moment, he said, "actually, it might be better to let her do as she pleases. Her staying at Wanggong Factory might cause trouble sooner or later."

"Master Le, you don't have to worry about this. You Rong's parents are both in Master Wang's hands; she dares not make trouble. Besides, she still has Zhou Newton—although not her own flesh and blood, he was raised by her single-handedly, wasn't he? He will always be a reliance in the future."

"If the Master could return, everything would be easy to say." Zhou Lezhi smiled bitterly. "A single log is hard to support! It just so happens Daoist Liu is also gone! I'm really afraid..."

Speaking to this point, his face darkened. Liu Sha had been missing for quite a few days. Although Master Wang had secretly sent people to Tongzhou and other places to investigate, so far, whether in official circles or privately, it was a state of "alive no person, dead no corpse." There wasn't even a bit of relevant news.

Zhou Lezhi was very worried because various signs indicated that Liu Sha had either flown far and high or been captured by the Australian thieves.

He was mentally prepared for the possibility of Liu Sha running away. Many clues exposed after the failure of the whole operation showed that Liu Sha's "hands and feet were not clean" and he had engaged in many petty actions privately. Yang Tianliang's "suicide" was also indistinctly related to this.

Ideally, Master Wang should have investigated this matter thoroughly, but Zhou Lezhi knew in his heart that it was an ironclad fact that Liu Sha had problems.

After the operation failed, paper couldn't wrap fire; naturally, he wanted to fly far and high. If it was like this, Zhou Lezhi would actually be more at ease.

What he feared most was that Liu Sha had already been captured by the Australian thieves. If so, not only himself but even Master Wang would be in great crisis. Because Liu Sha really knew too much.

Zhou Lezhi knew the conduct of the Australian thieves all too well. The Master had once warned him not to harbor even half a bit of illusion about the Australian thieves. They acted decisively and struck extremely cruelly. And they were unscrupulous.

Once they learned that Master Wang was "Old Stone," he might still be okay in the Capital, but if he left the Capital, he would probably face the calamity of extermination in an instant.

As for himself, it goes without saying—ten deaths and no life.

However, these days bad been calm and tranquil continually, and no suspicious personnel had appeared around him. As for Master Wang's side, with the support of "counter-reconnaissance" techniques, no flaws had appeared either. According to the information they collected, the Australian thieves seemed to have put their main energy on Eunuch Yang and the Shanxi House.
