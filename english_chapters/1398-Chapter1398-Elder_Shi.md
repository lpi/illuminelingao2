# Chapter 1398 - Elder Shi

"Since it's a poor place, how can there be a teaching gentleman?!" He asked back.

"In my opinion: If not someone lying, then this teaching gentleman is extremely suspicious. Very likely an important figure behind the scenes—Jia Le was introduced by him."

Zhao Yingong's brain rotated rapidly. Should he catch this teaching gentleman? He quickly denied his own thought. Jia Le was insignificant; her superior wouldn't be some important figure either.

Getting one leading to another could find the black hand behind scenes.

"Can you watch this teaching gentleman?"

"Hard. We have not a single relationship in Nanxiawa. Sending people in is hard to gain trust..."

"Spend money, kidnap, whatever you do, get a relationship as soon as possible." Zhao Yingong said without hesitation, "I want to know what his name is, what he looks like, what he does in Nanxiawa, who he contacts. You investigate clearly tell me as soon as possible."

"Okay, I go to do it immediately."

Zhao Yingong watched Zhao Tong go out, panted heavily. Didn't know why he was very uneasy. An imminent sense of crisis always shrouded him.

Danger in dark, he hadn't not thought about, but tension of approaching crisis was never had before.

Must drag this guy out! Break body into ten thousand pieces! He said恨恨. If only there were a few Special Reconnaissance Team personnel.

Cao Guangjiu sat respectfully in a private room of a brothel. He had been to this kind of place not few times, just always came as accompanying guest—expenses here were not a small number.

Called private room, actually was a small courtyard. This courtyard was small, yet also had layout of spring stone flowing water. A plantain in corner, verdant dripping, reflecting pebble paving as if just sprinkled with water, making people look full of freshness.

Tea on table was already cold. Together with six kinds of dried fruit snacks in six-compartment carved lacquer red fruit plate, none had been touched. Outside wall, faintly came sound of sandalwood clapper singing, setting off loneliness in this courtyard even more.

Curtain lifted, came in a middle-aged scholar, lightly fanning folding fan. Cao Guangjiu hurriedly stood up to pay respect: "Elder Shi..."

He was secretly disappointed in heart. Originally thought appointment in such place, probably Master would see him personally. Unexpectedly coming was still a shiye—Master's household guest.

"Brother Jiu too polite, let's sit down to talk."

"Yes, many thanks Elder Shi."

Scholar called Elder Shi wasn't eager to speak. First lifted tea cup drank a few mouthfuls of tea, ate some dried fruit snacks. Cao Guangjiu was secretly anxious, yet dared not say a word more, only accompanying respectfully.

After a long time, Elder Shi asked: "How is matter done?"

"Relying on Master's blessing, very smooth." Cao Guangjiu immediately told recent activities of himself and Gou Chengxuan one by one, "...Placards, nursery rhymes already spread out. Recently Phoenix Mountain Villa already increased guard. Zhao Yingong doesn't go out much either, probably afraid in heart already."

Then he reported Hao Yuan's plan of sending people to instigate Master Zhao's "Big Maid" in Villa. This news aroused Elder Shi's interest.

"Can it be done?"

"Hao Yuan seems confident."

"Hehe." Elder Shi smiled nodding, didn't pursue asking down. He pondered a moment asking: "How do you think of this person Hao Yuan?"

"Thoughts meticulous, acting ruthless. Absolutely not ordinary person."

"Brother Jiu, you also count as a local hero of a side, just saw this little content?" Elder Shi's tone carried teasing.

"Let Elder Shi laugh." Cao Guangjiu hurriedly roused spirit, said, "Then forgive me for being bold and presumptuous..."

"Speak no harm."

"Hao Yuan's shrewdness and capability, needless to say. Only in my opinion: this person has ability of seeing fire clearly. Seeing things seeing people, both have penetrating arguments. Most crucial formidable point: this person no matter where he is, associating with whom, three words two phrases, can make people produce good feeling, further willing to be driven by him. Neither using money, nor using method, people can trust him. He was in Nanxiawa only for a few months time, already directing common people inside like hands and feet."

"You speak so miraculously, could it be he has magic arts?"

"Absolutely no magic arts." Cao Guangjiu denied categorically, "He doesn't burn incense, doesn't worship god, nor has act of performing magic. I once sought opportunity to search his luggage, nothing unusual, no scripture also no ritual instrument. He also never treats illness or gives medicine to people in Nanxiawa."

"This is strange." Elder Shi twisted beard said, "Could it be doing good?"

"Exactly. But money on him is very little. Apart from silver given by Master, didn't see him have other channel of getting money. Taking all to do good is also very limited. Additionally he opened a charity school in Nanxiawa." Cao Guangjiu said, "This person is born with a kind of ability to bewitch people's hearts: a few words can speak into people's hearts. Speaking reasonable and making people comfortable. Making people convinced orally and in heart."

Elder Shi listened without revealing expression, asked: "So speaking, Hao Yuan is absolutely not a thing in pool?"

Cao Guangjiu's face changed instantly. He was experienced, how could he not hear what thing in pool meant in Elder Shi's words. Dared not respond directly, half a while later mumbled: "Not go that far ba..."

"Brother Jiu ah, could it be you were also conquered by him." Elder Shi smiled shaking head, "matter of this Hao Yuan, my Master also asked people to inquire his words and deeds separately. Leaving aside others, just his not greedy for money, not afraid of hardship, not fearing death, not fearing power and noble, deeply loved by common people... Brother Jiu is also person read old books, won't not know this kind of person right."

"Yes, yes." Sweat already flowed down on Cao Guangjiu's forehead.

"Hao Yuan's ambition is not small. He is not successful now. If he becomes successful, what does a Zhao Yingong count as?"

"Yes, Master wise." Cao Guangjiu rejoiced secretly. Looked like Master had meaning of killing donkey after grinding. Fortunately just now he said one as one, didn't cover up for him much in front of Elder Shi. Otherwise consequences unimaginable.

"How is Gou Chengxuan?" Elder Shi suddenly asked about him again.

"Person very capable. Although young, very calm. Handling things also effective. Can see experienced quite a few things." Cao Guangjiu while speaking felt back of neck chilly: How to know if anyone asked Gou Chengxuan same question.

"Then—"

Cao Guangjiu knew if he didn't say something "essential," Elder Shi absolutely wouldn't be satisfied.

"He seems to have extremely great hatred in chest, especially hates Zhao Yingong. Don't know if there is private feud?" Cao Guangjiu said carefully. This Gou Chengxuan wasn't easy to get along with either. His Broken Boot Party eyes for seeing people were very good. First time seeing Gou Chengxuan knew this person suffered great disaster ate great bitterness, mind extremely determined. Bare sticks from Guangdong not afraid of killing and beating, inevitably hundred times more vicious than him this Broken Boot Party having family and property.

"If not so, how could my Master use him?" Elder Shi smiled proudly.

"Yes, yes." Cao Guangjiu laughed dryly a few times accompanying, hoping this terrifying topic wouldn't continue. With his knowledge, deeply knew terribleness of Hao Yuan and Gou Chengxuan. He didn't want to say wrong words offending them.

"You are also person with family and property. As long as doing things honestly. Handling things well, my Master inevitably will thank you heavily."

"Dare not accept thanks." Cao Guangjiu put posture very low, "Beg Master to cultivate!"

"Easy to say." Elder Shi nodded, picked up tea cup to moisten throat again, then asked about preparation work of attacking Phoenix Mountain Villa on July 15th.

Cao Guangjiu reported manpower already arranged properly. He already greeted ten or so Fighting Society heads to use their people, put down deposit, only waiting for July 15th to move together.

During secrecy period, he didn't reveal who to deal with, nor told them to act together. To avoid leaking news.

"...Probably can recruit seven or eight hundred people. These people are old hands at fighting and brawling. Enough to use."

Phoenix Mountain Villa had at least twenty or thirty thousand population, but mostly refugees. These people unorganized, untrained, no weapons in hand, forming no combat power. What really needed to deal with was few hundred family soldiers in Villa.

Up to now, Cao Guangjiu still didn't know specific number of family soldiers in Villa. According to reports from several peripheral inside lines, estimated three or four hundred people at most.

"Enough people?"

"Enough. These few hundred people are core. Outside inevitably have to incite and coerce a batch of people. Otherwise momentum not big, can't stir up scale."

Besides Fighting Society members, Cao Guangjiu also prepared to contact Zhang Guangtian, mobilize a batch of Buddhists to "Defend Way Break Demon" then. Furthermore, poor people incited by placards would also be lured to Villa gate then.

Cao Guangjiu speaking here, hesitated a bit, said again, "Just silver not quite enough—"

"Master didn't already allocate five hundred taels for this matter to you. You giving five mace deposit to each of these few hundred Fighting Society people is not enough?" Elder Shi showed displeasure on face, seeming to dislike his appetite too big.

Cao Guangjiu naturally reported false accounts eating empty quota, but he raising silver matter wasn't for coveting money.

"Elder Shi, you don't know. Villa has family soldiers, Zhao Yingong is also a gentry. In Fighting Society's view that is a hard ground. They have to bear casualty risk. If Fighting Society people don't have heavy reward then, making noise temporarily refusing to go, very troublesome."

"Then what is your meaning?"

"Please Elder Shi convey to Master, before going to battle need heavy reward. Each person at least one tael."

"Unexpectedly you Fighting Society is also like government soldiers." Scholar smiled, "Wanting settling-in allowance without fighting, have to give opening allowance when going to battle."

"Dare not, dare not." Cao Guangjiu hurriedly defended, "Elder Shi you don't know Fighting Society rules. These people black eyeballs only recognize white silver. Without money to embolden absolutely unwilling to move hands."

"Good, follow you. Will prepare silver then." Elder Shi closed fan with a snap. Smiled, "Breaking Phoenix Mountain Villa, still afraid no money to take? These people, truly rat eyes inch light!"

"Thank Elder Shi understanding situation below! In addition, ask Elder Shi to convey to Master: need to prepare a few human lives."

"Human lives?"
