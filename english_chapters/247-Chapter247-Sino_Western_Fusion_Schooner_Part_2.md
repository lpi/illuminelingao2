# Chapter 247: The Hybrid Schooner (Part 2)

Regarding armaments, a barbette was installed at both the bow and the stern, each mounting a 70mm rifled cannon. Above the barbette was a retractable canvas frame, which could be covered to protect the cannon when not in use. It had the same structure as the barbettes installed on the fishing boats by the artillery trial group led by Lin Shenhe. The only improvement was that the recoil system of the naval gun carriage was changed from the original block and tackle system to a rail-mounted recoil-absorbing carriage. The gun carriage was installed on rails where wheels could slide. When firing, the recoil force was counteracted by sliding backwards along the rails. At the end of the rails were hardwood buffer blocks, utilizing the rebound force from the collision between the wheels and the blocks to push the cannon back to its original position—steel wasn't used to prevent sparks. If the transmigrators' mechanical capabilities were more advanced, Lin Shenhe could have introduced more complex gear, roller, and hydraulic systems to achieve better buffering effects—after all, on a warship, the weight and volume restrictions for solving gun recoil were much looser than in the field.

This system had undergone preliminary testing at the Lingao Cape fort and was considered to meet the basic requirements. Its installation on Ship Zero also included the intention of testing it at sea.

The gun emplacement was rotatable, manually pushed to rotate from below the deck. A speaking tube was installed at the emplacement to facilitate the gunner in directing the rotation angle. The 90-degree angle pointing towards the deck was mechanically locked out to prevent the enemy from firing on the deck if they boarded and captured the cannon, and also to prevent accidental friendly fire by the gunners.

Although the protection of the barbette wasn't perfect, no cannon in this spacetime could exceed the range of the 70mm rifled gun. The gun shield was made of riveted rolled iron plates, and its defense capability was impressive by the standards of the era. Wen Desi and the navy group had initially wanted to lay a layer of rolled wrought iron armor plates on the deck of "Ship Zero" to create the first protected cruiser (turtleback deck). However, after calculating the quantity of wrought iron plates required, Wen Desi abandoned the idea. Finally, only an armor belt was installed around the ammunition room as a safety measure.

Regarding auxiliary weapons, Li Yunxing's idea was to manufacture multi-barrel volley guns, but these were cumbersome and slow to load. Finally, based on Lin Shenhe's suggestion, mature technology was used: six 2-pounder light mortars were installed: one on each side of the hull, one at the bow, and one at the stern. The other two were to be installed on platforms at the top of the masts. This type of cannon was compact, mounted on a freely rotating gimbal, capable of 360-degree rotation, with an elevation angle of up to 80 degrees and a depression angle of 40 degrees. It fired iron sand, scrap iron, and canister shot with a total weight not exceeding one kilogram. The range was short, its function similar to a modern 12.7mm heavy machine gun, specifically used to kill enemies at close range. In naval battles, it was specifically designed to shred the opponent's rigging and sailors on deck, and when necessary, to sweep away boarding parties. Of course, the guiding ideology of the Transmigration Navy was to fire from as long a distance as possible, rather than engaging in exhausting and casualty-heavy close-range broadside slugfests.

Since Ship Zero was not prepared to install a full broadside of cannons, the usable space below its deck was much larger, greatly improving the ship's endurance and cargo capacity. The living conditions for the crew were naturally much better than ordinary sailing warships: more crew cabins, sanitary facilities, better lighting, and ventilation. Wen Desi even prepared retractable hammocks for the ordinary sailors. In the eyes of the transmigrators, these were merely the bare minimum. Wen Desi was very clear about the weaknesses of his group: they had plenty of courage and ambition, but lacked the will to endure hardship. Without letting everyone eat well, drink well, and sleep well, asking these people to go on long-distance adventures would be a pipe dream.

Regarding rigging, the shipbuilding team decided to temporarily use Chinese-style hard sails (junk rig). Hard sails were well-suited for the transmigrators' current capabilities, as they did not yet master the technology of manufacturing soft sails. Sewing complex sails was a specialized technique; not only did it require specific tools, but it also required a huge space. At that time, let alone the fact that no one in all of China knew this technique, even Macau might not necessarily have sailmakers. The Planning Committee's warehouse had no stock of canvas for sails and would have to rely on imports, and whether Macau had sufficient canvas available was still an unknown.

In contrast, the manufacturing and material requirements for Chinese-style hard sails were much lower. Hard sails were flat panels, while soft sails and jibs were complex curved surfaces requiring professional sewing by artisans. The material for soft sails had to be specially made canvas, whereas hard sails, due to their supporting battens, did not have high material requirements; ordinary cloth or even grass mats, reed screens, and similar materials could serve as substitutes. Even if slightly damaged, they could continue to be used, and temporary repairs were conveniently easy.

First, hard sails had high wind efficiency. A hard sail acted like an airplane wing, utilizing wind from "eight directions." When the wind blew towards the sail at a very small angle of attack, lift was generated on the sail surface. When the ship was hit by crosswinds, the lift vector was roughly similar to the ship's sailing direction, providing high efficiency. Even when encountering oblique headwinds, the ship could sail a "zigzag" track and still make headway. A sheet was tied to one side of the sail, allowing sailors to adjust the angle at any time. The ability to quickly raise and lower sails and tackle crosswinds by sailing zigzag routes made it much more convenient, the price being that the raw speed was slower than soft sails.

Secondly, the operation was convenient. Due to the lack of a complex running rigging system, ordinary people needed almost no specialized training to perform the work of setting and furling sails. Furling speed was extremely fast; in a crisis, simply cutting the main halyard would bring it crashing down in seconds. Raising the sail was slower and more laborious—the battens made it heavier—but it didn't require special skills. Hard sails didn't need frequent adjustment during navigation, saving manpower.

Although soft sail rigging was the trend for large oceanic sailing ships, Ship Zero's mission was at most to go south to the Philippines or north to Japan, basically circling the coastal areas. The Chinese-style hard sail was very suitable for the complex sea conditions and changeable wind directions of the continental littoral.

"Let's use hard sails as a substitute for now, and switch when we have sail manufacturing capabilities." Wen Desi didn't prefer hard sails, but reality dictated the choice—aside from industrial constraints, soft sail rigging required much higher skills from sailors. Ship Zero was a vessel to be put into use immediately.

"We'll use steam engines in the future, what do we still need sailing ships for?" Li Di asked.

Wen Desi shook his head. "At least for the next 20 years, large sailing ships will still be the backbone of our ocean transport—they don't need fuel. Steamships don't have an advantage in transporting bulk cargo yet; they are inefficient and consume coal. Long-range voyages require solving the problem of overseas coaling stations. As for when we can produce steam turbines, that depends on how fast we climb the tech tree."

Sailing ships actually continued to sail until the 1950s before being completely eliminated by the world shipping market. Before that, they remained the best vehicles for long-distance transport of bulk cargo.

"I really want to pilot our ironclad battleship soon." Le Lin, a naval enthusiast, spent all his free time at the shipyard despite not understanding shipbuilding technology.

"Actually, it's not that difficult. Iron-hulled ships are easier to build than wooden ships," Wen Desi said. "As long as there are enough materials and skilled worker training keeps up, building thousand-ton iron-hulled ships is a piece of cake."

"CEO Wen, do you think we should build another 70-ton class soft-sail rigged ship as a training ship?"

The speaker was Ming Qiu of the Maritime Power Department. As a naval advisor, he often came to the shipyard to check the construction progress. Honestly, after being used to modern warships, seeing the Navy's warship turning out to be a sailing ship was quite weird. Especially those strange gun emplacements—Ming Qiu only vaguely remembered seeing something similar when visiting a fort built in the late Qing Dynasty. Although reality was disjointed from his experience, the basic idea of building a navy was consistent: whether a navy of the sail era or the electronic era, people were always the most basic and critical component. Training enough sailors was a pressing matter. Ming Qiu had seen the sailing training ship of the visiting South Sea Fleet back in the day and felt this method was excellent for training.

"What you said makes sense. I'll discuss it with the Executive Committee to allocate materials as soon as possible to start another training ship, but this requires the support of the Foreign Trade Department." In fact, a few days ago, Ma Qianzhu had already sent people from the trading company to Macau to see if they could collect relevant materials and artisans.

Just as they were talking, a European-style sloop with a long bowsprit like a swordfish and hanging a long row of sails was sailing crookedly in the waters outside the shipyard. The sails were hung in a disorderly manner, and a few people could be seen crawling on them; faint shouts drifted over on the sea breeze.

"Whose boat is that?" Wen Desi was startled.

"Li Huamei's boat, the *Hangzhou*," Chen Haiyang reported. "We reported to the Executive Committee last time; she is now teaching everyone sail and rigging handling techniques."

"It's her. She seems very active." Wen Desi said thoughtfully, "Didn't Meng De report that she wasn't willing to be an instructor?"

"She refused. She's not strictly teaching now, it seems to be for recreation."

"Using this for recreation is quite unique." Wen Desi was filled with a sense of distrust.

After Li Huamei came to Lingao, the Executive Committee had doubts about her intentions, so they hadn't decided on a tone for treating her. They only sent people from the External Affairs Department to entertain her with good food and drink. Li Huamei, bored in the port, naturally established relations with the navy crowd at Bopu. Relying on her reputation, beauty, straightforward temperament, and fast ship, she quickly won over most of the navy crowd, except for a few former PLA navy officers who maintained revolutionary vigilance. They often took her boat for a spin, euphemistically calling it learning ship handling. Li Huamei was generous; she taught experience and occasionally performed ship handling techniques. For a time, her prestige soared, winning a large number of fans. Every time the Executive Committee held an expanded meeting, someone would put in a good word for her. This made the Executive Committee feel the powerful charm of a woman deeply.
