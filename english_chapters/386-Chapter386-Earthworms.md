# Chapter 386 - Earthworms

"Once the county's coarse grain yields increase, I'll directly manufacture complete compound feed to sell to farmers—no more self-mixing." Wu Nanhai had grand ambitions. "This will further increase yields, reduce technical difficulty, and make promotion easier."

Speaking, Wu Nanhai rode his Type 28 bicycle with Wan Lihui to a corner of the farm. A flat piece of land had been prepared here. Rows of small trees surrounded it on all sides, with drainage ditches dug.

Most conspicuous were the many large wicker baskets piled near the cleared ground. Though covered with straw mats, they emitted a pungent stench. Rotting liquid seeped onto the ground, with flies happily dancing above.

Wan Lihui immediately spotted his brother Wan Lihuang wearing a straw hat, sitting boredly in a grass shed, occasionally swatting flies.

Wan Lihui pinched his nose: "Why so stinky?"

Wu Nanhai seemed unconcerned, leaning his bike against a tree:

"Little Wan, this earthworm farm will be you brothers' responsibility from now on."

"Alright." Wan Lihui thought: Great, this stinking dirty work falls on us again—is it because we're from farming backgrounds? He bitterly reflected that his dream for this time-space had been freely playing with guns. Now no guns, just farming. Back to rural labor.

Despite such thoughts, he couldn't show it. He quickly expressed determination to complete the organization's assignment.

Artificial earthworm cultivation was a new agricultural technology. Its main purpose was providing low-cost protein feed for livestock, poultry, and fish while processing various organic wastes, converting waste to fertilizer, and eliminating organic waste pollution. It could also improve soil fertility.

Wu Nanhai planned to raise red earthworms—a common breed in earthworm cultivation, a dung worm that loved consuming various livestock manure with strong fertilizer affinity, suitable for artificial cultivation.

"Look, these are the red earthworms we'll raise." Wu Nanhai opened the wooden box. Several 90-150mm purple-red earthworms were wriggling inside.

"They're easy to raise—the key is properly preparing feed." Wu Nanhai led them to the baskets with their frankly foul odor.

"Earthworm feed," he said, "comes from many sources. Basically any non-toxic, disease-free organic waste works: livestock manure, plants, fruit peels, sugarcane bagasse, rotten fruit. Red earthworms especially love rotten fruit and vegetable leaves—they prefer sweet-sour flavors."

"Rotten fruit isn't common locally—" Wan Lihui thought that since Wu Nanhai's comprehensive composting plan, seemingly no organic matter escaped his grasp. He wondered how he planned to allocate organic waste to earthworms. Those baskets contained who-knew-what, stinking terribly.

"Rotten vegetable leaves work too. Also wild fruits." Wu Nanhai seemed to have planned ahead. "Leizhou is shipping us several boatloads of jackfruit—they have tons of it there, plus sugarcane bagasse." He pulled back a basket mat.

The basket contained rotting jackfruit and much sugarcane bagasse—a sweet-sour-stinking smell made him cover his nose.

"These also need composting soon." Wu Nanhai frowned slightly.

Organic matter for feed must be fully fermented before use. Earthworms are omnivorous segmented animals. These organic wastes must be composted and fermented before earthworms can consume them; otherwise mass earthworm deaths would result. So the Wan brothers' main task was actually composting.

Wu Nanhai personally took a shovel, scooping out various organic wastes for a composting demonstration.

Before fermentation, livestock and poultry manure must be watered and crushed. Crop stalks and straw are first cut into short strips with a hoe-knife; rotten fruit and sugarcane bagasse can be used directly. After piling, water is added and mixed evenly for thorough soaking. Then ground-pile to one meter height. Pile loosely without compacting—this aids thermophilic bacterial growth. Thoroughly water for 50-60% moisture content.

After piling the feed, cover with plastic sheet for temperature and moisture retention. Since large plastic sheets—such luxury items—weren't available here, straw mats substituted. Then water again to keep mats moist.

"After three or four days, internal pile temperature can reach 50-60°C." Wu Nanhai opened his bag and extracted a rod-shaped object wound repeatedly with grass rope. Carefully unwrapping it revealed a huge glass rod—the Glass Factory's latest product: an alcohol thermometer. The ugly thing resembled a vibrator, sure to inspire endless imagination in otaku.

"Thermometer. You must monitor compost temperature daily. Too low or too high won't work. Turn the pile every two weeks, adding moisture. After three or four turnings, fermented feed should be: dark brown, odorless, soft and loose, not sticky. Then it's ready."

Wan Lihui watched Wu Nanhai dig into a small pile and pull out a handful of fermented feed: "Just like this."

This action somewhat impressed him: indeed, this was how an agricultural technician should be.

Then Wu Nanhai began leading them in making earthworm beds. Fermented feed was piled into ridges 80 cm wide, 200-300 cm long, then watered. Finally he dumped the wooden box's earthworms in. The earthworms almost immediately burrowed into the feed.

"If they won't go in, the feed isn't properly fermented." Wu Nanhai said. "This batch is breeding stock from the ship—just a few dozen. Normally each earthworm bed can be seeded with a thousand. In about three or four months, you can reach 15,000 per square meter—harvest time. Not only can earthworms be used as feed, but earthworm castings can feed fish and shrimp, plus serve as fertilizer."

Wu Nanhai gave him a mimeographed booklet titled *Earthworm and Housefly Maggot Cultivation Technology*, printed with: "Internal materials, Agricultural Committee only."

"Earthworm cultivation is relatively simple. Mainly maintain temperature, moisture, and ventilation, plus process feed."

"Raising them this way—won't it take at least a quarter to reach batch production capacity? Is there time?"

"There's time." Wu Nanhai said. "Initially our lending scale is small—not that many chicks, so formula feed demand won't be large either."

Wu Nanhai finished his instructions and gave him an equipment list for earthworm cultivation: rakes, shovels, and such, plus medical factory face masks.

"These are now yours. Masks as needed—maintain proper labor protection. Take care of tools."

Then he mounted his bicycle and departed grandly. The Wan brothers sat by the earthworm bed, staring at each other.

"Brother, didn't you say coming here we could shoot Japanese for fun?" Wan Lihuang looked at his brother. "All I see is farm work all day..."

"Well—" Wan Lihui had no answer. This reality differed too much from casually shooting at Japanese pirates as target practice. "Let's just build the new countryside first."

"Then why come here to build? Could've just gone back to our hometown to build..."

"Enough questions!" Wan Lihui finally lost patience. "Go compost!"

And so the Wan brothers began their new countryside construction in the new time-space.

Wu Nanhai leisurely cycled along field paths, occasionally meeting his farm workers. Everyone was accustomed to these "iron-wheeled vehicles." No one came to gawk—they just stood respectfully as he passed. Wu Nanhai would greet workers as usual—not to "connect with the people," but because he was naturally kind-hearted.

Now instead of returning to the farm office, he headed to the newly-built livestock area.

Previously, the livestock section had been a small part of the farm—basically courtyard-style farming. Following battles, trade, and other means, livestock and poultry numbers had continually increased. Plus during spring, under professional veterinarian Yang Baogui's guidance, the Agricultural Committee had launched a massive artificial insemination campaign—results were significant. Clearly by late summer/early autumn, population numbers would further expand. The Agricultural Committee decided to establish permanent livestock facilities before then.

The livestock area was near Nick's previously-built horse stables. Actually the Agricultural Committee had long coveted this land—when building Nick's stables, they'd thought of purchasing it all together.

But within this large tract of wasteland was one piece of owned land—about 200 *mu*, which had grown some peanuts though clearly long fallow.

Ownerless land only required registration at the county government—pay a fee, receive a deed. But negotiations with this plot's landlord had consumed considerable time. This landlord was a stubborn type. When Wu Nanhai visited with Zhang Youfu, he couldn't believe this person was actually a landlord—his house had a thatched roof. Though poor as any ordinary smallholder, the landlord absolutely refused to sell this land he neither farmed nor could farm. Supposedly selling it meant he'd no longer be a landlord. To preserve this empty title, he adamantly refused. Multiple negotiations failed. Dugu Qiuhun, hearing about it, even proposed deploying his police force for forcible seizure. Zhang Youfu suggested: if the transmigrators didn't want to act themselves, they could forge a deed, then through Secretary Wang's connections spend 100 taels to sue in county court—guaranteed win.

"No, absolutely not." Wu Nanhai shook his head vigorously at this. Such collusion with officials to bully people—he fundamentally opposed it. Everyone agreed these methods were too dirty, seriously damaging the transmigrator collective's image. The Ming might be corrupt, but in the early revolutionary stage, the glorious righteous image must be maintained.
