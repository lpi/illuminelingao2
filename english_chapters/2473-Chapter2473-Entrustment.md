# Chapter 2473 - Entrustment

"I see, Fifth Mistress—what is her name?"

"Her original name is Lianjie (Lotus Sister). Even she doesn't know her surname. People in the Qu family call her Fifth Mistress or Lianjie." Li Tang knew the Chief was going to arrange a home for Lianjie and immediately became spirited.

"Is she literate?"

"Illiterate."

"How old is she specifically?"

"Thirty-three? Or thirty-four?"

Li Shan stroked his chin. Old age, illiterate, and not a working woman; this was quite difficult to arrange.

"How about this: I'll arrange for her to study in a literacy class first. I'll arrange a job for her after she comes out. Otherwise, illiterates can only do labor-intensive work. She is not young and wasn't a laborer before; she definitely can't do it."

"Many thanks, Chief!" Li Tang beamed with joy. It seemed everything was as she expected.

"You guys go."

The group took their leave. Just as Chen Lin was about to leave, Li Shan stopped him: "Heard you failed to attend the welcome banquet?"

Chen Lin was startled, thinking: *He even knows this!* Thinking again that Chen Xiaobing bailed him out, he must have reported to Li Shan. He couldn't hide it even if he wanted to, so he honestly told the story of going shopping at Friendship Department Store and being framed on the way back.

"...I really didn't do that thing!" Chen Lin wanted to defend himself, but Li Shan waved his hand: "You don't need to explain, I trust you! If it were true, she would have confronted you in the police station and filed a lawsuit that day. It wouldn't go so far as to delay until the detention time limit passed without showing up, and leaving a fake address. This is obviously a deliberate frame-up."

"Chief is wise!" Chen Lin hated that he couldn't kneel down and shout "Blue Sky Grand Master" (Upright Judge).

"But this matter of yours is also too strange. You just arrived in Lingao, know no one locally, let alone have enemies. Why did that woman frame you? Not an enemy, nor for money."

"This student thinks that woman is most likely instructed by that Advisor Xia." Chen Lin finally spoke out the guess that had lingered in his mind for a long time.

"It makes sense for you to say so." Li Shan nodded, "You don't need to worry about this matter; just do your own work well."

Chen Lin was full of joy, agreed, and hurried out.

However, Li Shan didn't think so. Although logically only Advisor Xia would do this, thinking carefully, he didn't seem to have the necessity.

At dinner, the visiting group ate with the "Technical Group." Because they would be partners in the future, Wu Yijun and others tried even harder to win over these few young students. Li Tang and An Jiu were naturally lively, so they chatted very well quickly. Seeing this, Li Shan felt relieved while secretly amused—it seemed there wouldn't be big problems in communication for future cooperation.

Originally, he was somewhat worried about letting Li Tang go out. Now it seemed he worried too much. Although this girl was slightly reckless, she did things quite methodically and had strong execution ability.

Chen Lin was in a good mood and inevitably drank a few more cups of Kvass at the banquet. His face was slightly drunk. Returning to the room after the banquet, he felt his whole body hot, so he came out of the room again and walked in the courtyard.

Lingao in January was similar to Guangzhou in March or April; even wearing a single shirt at night didn't feel cold. Chen Lin was happy in his heart and was planning to compose a poem. While chanting, suddenly someone in the dark said: "Who is there? Babbling *Yi Ya Ah Ya*, isn't it annoying?!"

Chen Lin was startled. Suddenly seeing a woman flash out from the dark; it was exactly An Jiu.

Seeing it was Chen Lin, An Jiu was embarrassed and hurriedly said: "Sorry, sorry, I thought it was some sour scholar! Too many sour scholars came here recently."

Chen Lin smiled: "This student is also a sour scholar."

"Ai ai, you are different from them." As An Jiu said this, Li Tang also walked over. Seeing it was him, the two looked at each other and laughed. Chen Lin felt his hair stand on end—*What is going on?*

"It's Young Master Chen."

"Dare not, dare not, just call me Chen Lin."

"We are discussing how to arrange Sister Lian."

"Didn't Chief Li say he arranged for her?"

"That is going to purification and studying. When she comes out three months later, doesn't she still need another arrangement for a place to go?"

"The Chief will also arrange this, right? I heard Australians possess the Four Seas, and industries are as many as stars in the sky; where can't be arranged?"

"Hee hee, surprisingly you can really speak in literary idioms." An Jiu covered her mouth and laughed. Li Tang also laughed: "Seeing you are reliable and also an upright person, let me tell you. We are discussing Zhou Suniang's matter."

"Zhou Suniang?" Chen Lin was confused. *How did another person pop up?*

"Li Tang!" An Jiu obviously still didn't trust Chen Lin.

"It's fine to tell him. Anyway, he was also framed by Advisor Xia that night. Squatted in the cell for a night for nothing."

Chen Lin smiled bitterly: "So you knew everything."

"Of course I knew," Li Tang bragged, "I even know the name of that woman who called 'Molestation'."

Chen Lin was confused now; what was going on?

"You sit down, I'll tell you slowly." Li Tang beckoned him over.

Chen Lin remembered ancient teachings; sitting side by side with two girls in this dark courtyard really had the suspicion of "under the melon patch and plum tree" (suspicious circumstances). He couldn't help but feel apprehensive: "This, isn't appropriate, right?"

"Look at your shy look!" Li Tang laughed quite presumptuously, "Rest assured, An Jiu and I won't eat you."

Chen Lin was a young man after all; being provoked by a girl with a few words made him lose face, so he followed.

Walking close, he found this pavilion was actually an open porch, with a kerosene lamp lit inside. It was just obscured by trees in front, so light was almost invisible from the east wing of the guesthouse where he stayed, but from the other side, the west wing, it was right in front of eyes. Only then did he relax.

"You sit down. I'll tell you." An Jiu said.

It turned out this Lianjie was a concubine of the Qu family. The Qu family had many wives, concubines, and dependents, and often bought clothing materials at Ruihexiang. They counted as big customers of the shop. But Manager An didn't like this family. Firstly, this family was overbearing; let alone the master, even advisors and favored servants were same. Secondly, this family was very unpleasant in paying bills, often delaying payment during the three festivals. Some fabrics bought by wives and misses themselves were not recognized by the accountant because they were not on the public account. Manager An suffered quite a few small losses.

An Jiu knew Lianjie through such commercial dealings. Lianjie was the Fifth Concubine of Master Qu. Because she was getting older and had no children, she was a punching bag role in the Qu family.

"Originally she endured it at home. Unexpectedly, recently the gold lock locket on the newly added grandson of the Qu family fell off, and then he fell seriously ill again. The First Wife of Qu family suspected her of playing tricks without rhyme or reason..."

"This... why?" Chen Lin listened entranced and couldn't help asking.

"Ai, it's a long story," An Jiu sighed, "Anyway, suspecting her of laying a black hand but unable to find evidence, so often used excuses to beat, scold, and punish her. Maltreating her a hundred times. Sister Lian couldn't bear it and wanted to commit suicide several times. I really couldn't stand watching it, so I discussed with Sister Li and helped her escape taking the opportunity of her coming out to buy materials..."

Chen Lin secretly thought the Chief was right to scold you! Putting aside the boldness of abducting someone else's concubine, just saving people in her own dad's shop showed this Miss An really had a big heart!

But this couldn't be said aloud. Chen Lin had to compliment: "Two young ladies are truly chivalrous people."

"Forget about being chivalrous or not; we just can't stand seeing such things under the Senate's rule!" Li Tang was indignant.

Chen Lin just smiled apologetically without speaking. Then heard An Jiu say: "The Zhou Suniang we mentioned is also a concubine of the Qu family..."

*Holy crap*, Chen Lin thought, *are you guys fighting against the Qu family or what! Does this imply you want to abduct Zhou Suniang too?*

Probably reading his thoughts from his expression, An Jiu hurriedly said: "We are not going to help her escape! This thing can be done once but not twice. Besides, Suniang doesn't have this intention either!"

"When Lianjie escaped, she also helped Lianjie. When parting, she entrusted us with a matter."

"Oh? What matter?" Chen Lin couldn't help asking.

"She has an older brother. The two were sold together. Her brother was sold, and she heard the human trafficker say the family who bought the brother was in Xiangshan County..."

Chen Lin understood now why the two girls insisted on pulling him; it turned out there was this meaning inside.

This favor could be helped. Although the possibility of finding him was extremely small. But the attitude must be positive. Needless to say about An Jiu; the relationship between Li Tang and Chief Li was obviously unusual—probably the legendary "Life Secretary." Currying favor with her well would be useful in the future.

"Zhou Suniang said she is doing okay in the Qu family now, just doesn't know how her brother is. Hoping to get exact news of her brother to settlee her mind; it would be better if they could meet once."

"My family is a large clan in Xiangshan County; it's not difficult to search. Just don't know what her brother's name is, how he looks, or any characteristics or tokens?"

Chen Lin's immediate statement indeed won the favor of the two. Li Tang nodded: "Mister is indeed an upright good person!" Immediately took out a silk handkerchief packet from her pocket, put it on the table, and opened it.

Opening the silk handkerchief, inside was a broken wooden comb.

"Suniang said this was her mother's wooden comb. She always wore it on her head. When separating from her brother, she broke the comb, one half for each, to keep as a memento." Saying this, Li Tang's eyes turned red, probably feeling empathy.

"As for names, they were young when sold, didn't even know their surnames. Not to mention appearance. But her brother has a tear mole at the corner of his right eye. Also, both siblings were scalded at the human trafficker's place; Zhou Suniang has a scar on her right calf, and her brother on the left elbow."

"Student understands. I will send people to search after returning. Only this broken comb..."

"I have already made a rubbing here." Li Tang took out a paper rubbing from her pocket, "The comb has the shop's engraved mark. Two words still remain on the hairpin."

"Having this is good." Chen Lin accepted it happily, "Student will definitely do my best in this matter."
