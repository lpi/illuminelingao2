# Chapter 1978 - The Secret of Finance

This remark meant they shouldn't discuss the "Flower Donation" issue today. Ai Zhixin had participated in the customs industry rectification meeting and knew a bit about the complexity of Guangzhou's customs industry. Discussing without detailed investigation was obviously engaging in empty talk. He nodded presently.

"Did you notice a problem today?" Wang Qiyi recalled the meeting process and had some concerns about the performance of other transmigrators.

"What?"

"I said in the meeting, too many people treat themselves as Guangzhou Municipal Government people."

"This can't be helped." Ai Zhixin was open-minded about this. Unlike the Wang couple who were only responsible for specific business, he needed to coordinate all aspects, so he considered problems more.

"If we want to do well in Guangzhou, firstly we need Liu Xiang's support, then police, commerce, and propaganda. Although we hang the same plaque as the General Bureau, specific matters are still Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau. We can't bypass Liu Xiang's level, nor can we butt heads."

"Did you forget why our Finance and Tax Bureau's approval is 'Directly Subordinate to Central Administration Council'? Our system isn't like the old timeline where each place belongs to each place, managed hierarchically with superiors only responsible for business guidance. Instead, it's vertical leadership. The authority Ming Lang gave us: personnel organization is in our own hands; our wages don't go through Guangzhou finance." Wang Qiyi tapped his teacup lightly and said slowly, "We are an independent system, right?"

"So the positioning the Center gave us is checks and balances." Ai Zhixin had thought about this problem long ago. Recently pressed breathless by revenue, he forgot. Now that Wang Qiyi mentioned it, he understood immediately. "Local governments are horizontal; we, Delong, and that Reserve Bank which is only a plaque, are vertical."

"Yes, together with Delong, we firmly grasp their money. The local government fiscal accounts are managed by us. Without the Finance and Tax Bureau's documents, they can't move money in the National Treasury, nor can they move money in their own local fiscal accounts. And since all money goes through the National Treasury at Delong, the ins and outs of every penny can't escape the Center's eyes. Governments at all levels have the authority to appoint personnel and set up institutions, so the Center can only control them through money."

Because Wang Qiyi had served in grassroots departments, he knew clearly how useful those functional departments supposedly eating local finance—like Public Security, Procuratorate, Court, Culture, Entertainment, Education, etc.—were to local governments. In some places, people even jokingly called the Public Security, Procuratorate, and Court the "domestic servants" of the local government—because if they dared not listen to local government instructions, they would immediately face the predicament of being choked by money. Funds and land were just common means; they even pulled tricks like directly cutting water and power to office buildings and family quarters.

Transmigrators are not saints. When they sit in the position of local high officials, they naturally have a stance. So the Administration Council wanted to squeeze the local lifelines tight from the start, strangling all possibilities of factionalism.

Now that the Senate built finance and taxation into independent systems through the Finance and Tax Bureau, local functional departments without worries might not buy the local government's account so much. Not only functional departments, this also avoided part of the internal government manipulation space brought by the Finance Bureau being under local management in the old timeline.

Internal control of local governments and departments under Senate rule started very early. From the establishment of the Cheka to the separation of military administration and military command systems, this awareness was reflected everywhere. Take the Finance and Tax Bureau itself: since establishment, just internally, a sum of tax had to pass through at least four posts—Tax Assessment Division, Hall Collection Post, Hall Accounting Post, and Agency Tax Accounting. Externally, tax funds were finally received by Delong. This cross-post cross-department restraint mechanism greatly increased the difficulty of fraud systematically.

"Internal control and checks and balances in the system are the embodiment of modern government management." Ai Zhixin summarized. He suddenly felt the burden on his shoulders became much heavier.

"By the way, if the tax sharing plan passes, we should submit a report to Chief Cheng." Zhang Xiaoqi realized her husband and Ai Zhixin forgot an important issue. "The Central Treasury must be separated from the Local Treasury. The tax funds shared to the locality are still tax funds and cannot be used directly as fiscal revenue! You let it slip in the meeting. We should let Delong open another Municipal Treasury Account for Guangzhou City. The shared tax funds enter here first, then can be allocated to Guangzhou City's own Fiscal Account only after we issue a letter."

"Sister Zhang, wait for me to straighten this out. Assuming 100 yuan of property tax is collected, and the sharing is 60-40 between locality and Center, then after we remit the tax funds to Delong, they deposit 40 yuan into the Central Treasury and 60 yuan into the Guangzhou Municipal Treasury. This money still can't be used. Only when we issue an appropriation notice to Delong can they allocate this 60 yuan to the Guangzhou Fiscal Account?"

"Yes. But not necessarily only allocated to the Guangzhou Fiscal Account. What if Guangzhou has other extra-budgetary expenditures? Did you forget the Central-Direct Enterprises and Institutions? Right."

"Then can't Guangzhou have extra-budgetary income? Like Central transfer payments?"

"Sure. Anyway, we must insist that Treasury and Finance are two lines. The Treasury is managed by Delong; Finance is managed by us. Whether transfer payment goes through Treasury transfer or Fiscal appropriation is decided by the Administration Council."

"I think Meng Xian and Liu Xiang will curse you to death if they know this. Hahaha!"

Guangzhou, Haopan Street.

The flat solid stone road underfoot, the orderly shops on the roadside, peddlers shouting their wares, large and small boats in the river... gave Zeng Juan, who had walked here countless times since childhood, a feeling of being in another world every time.

One year, just one year. A year ago, he and his little partners were still here eagerly waiting for new comic strips and new Australian movies, discussing Guan Yu beheading Hua Xiong. It seemed like in the blink of an eye, Guangzhou city fell, Australians established government, plague, clearing Guan Di Temple, civil service exam... Until now, it seemed he had lived a lifetime in this one year; everything was overturned.

Among friends, Chen Shixin had gone to Lingao, said to be studying painting under a real Australian Senator; Li Ziyu was also rising rapidly in the Police Bureau, repeatedly earning merits and awards, now sent to Lingao for training—promotion upon return was probably a sure thing; as for Zhang Yu, needless to say, a rising star in Guangzhou's business circle, even figures like Gao Ju had to give an Australian handshake and a few polite words when seeing him. Only himself, half a year ago still muddling along reading newspapers to people in teahouses to chat about Australian matters. Fortunately, fortunately...

Zeng Juan tugged the hem of his tax uniform to make it look crisper. He unconsciously glanced at the number on his chest and the badge on his shoulder again. This uniform was said to be designed by Director Ai in Australian style. The near-black navy blue made one look very solemn when wearing it. Although without a Sam Browne belt and peaked cap, it looked quite like Li Ziyu's police uniform. But much crisper than the police uniform—which was cotton cloth.

The Senate version tax uniform was basically formed by blending the Zhongshan suit and Type 07 police uniform based on the old timeline tax uniform, omitting troublesome ties and collar flowers. The left chest badge had personnel number and tax emblem, canceling epaulets. Originally Ai Zhixin planned to use thin wool fabric for winter wear but succumbed after strong suggestions from the Ministry of Light Industry and actual inspection of imported Dutch linen fabric. Fortunately, compared to Police or Political Security departments, Finance and Tax Bureau personnel were relatively few, and mostly engaged in clerical work with low wear rate, so Ai Zhixin's tax uniform could be said to be the uniform closest to the old timeline approved by Wu De.

This uniform was crisp and durable. The cut of the tax bureau uniform was also more exquisite than military and police uniforms, fitting better. Walking on the street gave a majestic feeling.

According to Vice Director Wang, this was because their Finance and Tax Bureau, like Li Ziyu's Police Bureau, were both "Court Hawks and Dogs." "If police are dogs that bite people, then we are hawks. Eyes must be sharp not to miss a milli-cent; claws must be ruthless not to let go of a cent."

Zeng Juan felt these Australians, using the new saying from Lingao, had very weird brain circuits. "Hawks and Dogs" was never a good term, yet they used it on themselves so righteously and self-satisfied. This was probably the simple and robust true nature Li Ziyu talked about. But speaking of which, whether hawk or dog, since wearing this tax skin, his back was straighter, walking brought wind, and even seeing old acquaintances on the road made him feel disdainful. Moreover, this outfit was much higher than Li Ziyu's shapeless wrinkled police uniform—fabric crisp and substantial, cut fitting... fitting... Zeng Juan accidentally thought "again" of those tax hall girls meeting with him a few days ago.

Head up, chest out, abdomen in, stride open, arms straight. Zeng Juan withdrew his thoughts, reciting the "habits" taught by instructors with sticks in the Guangzhou Cadre Training School, quickly catching up with his partner and Team Leader Huang Ping.

The last place to go today was the Gao Residence—Gao Ju's home, the "closest partner" of Australian Song in Guangzhou city. These tax administrators didn't stroll on streets daily like Li Ziyu's patrol police. The Finance and Tax Bureau stipulated: no entry without task. Usually, they mainly collected and organized data files transferred from the hall and taxpayers under their jurisdiction in the office.

Vice Director Wang set very high standards for this work. Some taxpayer files were randomly checked every quarter for non-jurisdiction tax administrators to read. If others couldn't grasp basic "management elements" by reading files, then it was considered unqualified. Not only work had to be redone, but the whole group's bonus would be gone. After today's visit, if no sudden situation occurred this week, they probably wouldn't leave the Finance and Tax Bureau again. And Team Leader Huang had received a transfer order to go to the Inspection Division next week. So according to Leader Huang, this visit was his last time as their leader.
