# Chapter 2012 - Choice

According to Du Yibin's personal view, this treatment was simply low to "Making People Hair Point [Outrageous]," but right now this counted as the biggest support Senate could take out. Even this Housekeeping Service Coupon was what he fought for several times before Civil Affairs Mouth barely agreed. He already thought well. Could learn from volunteers of later generations. Letting soldiers of army, students of Fangcaodi, colleagues of work unit organize a batch of people weekly or every half month to help doing housework. Lightening burden of disabled families with low cost as possible.

"As for the widespread scruple fearing being abused by husband and husband's family. We also said. Will safeguard their legal rights in system. In addition arranging work for them is just for letting them have income. So even women unable to go out working, marrying severe disabled naturalized citizens. We also give a Minimum Living Fee. Having income dominatable by self. Their status in family is different. Women status speaking to bottom is an economic problem."

This tune, Lu Cheng had heard many times in Du Wen's class. Unconsciously nodded silently.

"They having such an income. Regardless husband or husband's family. All dare not look down. Probability of abuse kind of matters happening also much smaller. In addition, when we arrange housing, we will also try arranging them in adjacent places—Can migrate help each other. People many aren't courage big?"

Lu Cheng couldn't help saying: "Senate thought too thoughtful!"

This was her sigh completely from lung and bowels. To Du Yibin not rare a bit. These things were all what he thought for many days.

"As for those having children. Just see if they willing to accept or not. Children willing to accept follow their surname." Du Yibin said. "Actually a part of disabled naturalized citizens lost fertility. We suggest women carrying children can consider them—Acceptance degree will be higher."

"Chief. I see shall we open a on-site meeting. You also be present. Like this persuasion power will be higher." Lu Cheng said.

Lu Cheng concentrated candidates on list up. Replied their scruples one by one in public. Because Du Yibin was also on scene. Equivalent to directly endorsing for Lu Cheng. Everyone's scruples were dispelled very quickly. Finally Lu Cheng asked them to sign up voluntarily. Those willing to marry exceeded two hundred people. This greatly exceeded Du Yibin's expectation. Heart was quite happy. Nodded saying good repeatedly. Also published a "Warm and Overflowing" speech. Encouraging everyone "Brave to Open New Life."

Du Yibin finished speech. Then distributed relevant materials to "Single Women" willing to marry.

This batch of materials was meticulously made by Civil Affairs Mouth. One copy for every disabled naturalized citizen. Besides head photo. Also had full body photo—This was for giving them opportunity to assess opponent physical disability status practically. Materials very detailed. Could say everything female side concerned. All listed above.

"Single Women" looked through seriously—Candidates material fully had two hundred plus people. Reading once all needed very long time. And they almost all illiterate. Although passed anti-illiteracy training. Reading materials very strenuous. So most people only looked at photos.

Choosing one then wrote down number on paper slip by self. Putting into basket. Feeling all unsuitable. Could also not choose.

Very quickly. Chirping speaking sound sounded in room. Discussion sound. Also laughter and exclamation sound. Du Yibin sat above. Heart felt quite satisfied. Could see out. They were all checking those materials holding expectation. He originally thought once opening materials would have many people giving up. Didn't expect. Actually had quite a few people examining photos repeatedly. Occasionally asking cadres beside to read material and explain nouns above. Most people couldn't understand currency unit of Senate. Still wanted to know income number listed exactly "Worth How Much Money"; Some not clear about nature of "Work." Because in their view. Men's "Work." Nothing more than Artisan, Farmer, Merchant, Assistant these few kinds. And work types listed on this material eyes blurred disordered. Many couldn't understand. Must have someone explaining.

Although knowing objects self choosing were all disabled personnel. But everyone always wanted to find a "Better" one. Inevitably had to pick pick choose choose. Occasionally criticizing feet discussing head with best friends. From time to time emitting snicker sound. Some people faces would turn red. They where still had look of "Chaste Women" with withered face and dead heart heart not long ago. Instead like young girls glowing out youth again.

In this way. This photo blind date activity became very lengthy. Du Yibin young couldn't sit still. Then quietly walked out. He breathed a mouthful of air deeply. Thinking...

Lu Cheng also hurried followed out.

"Chief..."

"Nothing. I feel somewhat air stuffy. Coming out to breathe air." Du Yibin said. "How is situation of student side?"

"All prepared well." Lu Cheng said. "Everyone emotion very high. Those not listed into candidate also waiting for next time eagerly. Who doesn't want a good family. Having man having child. Living a normal person life?"

"Opportunity of next time naturally have. But also need herself working hard right?" Du Yibin own emotion also very high. "Later we will give more people opportunity. Letting everyone live on good days."

"That is." Lu Cheng felt this young Senator happy somewhat over head. Seemed corner of eyes had tear light. Couldn't help secretly surprised. Regardless widows or those disabled naturalized citizens. Which family wasn't his relative. Why he so happy? She recalled a past event Mao Xiuyu mentioned. Senator Liu San personally held out a sick child from corpse pile here. Even fed rice fed medicine to him. "Father Mom both not over this. Let alone People Above People with no kin no cause." Mao Xiuyu saying here always wanted adding a sentence. "Non-Have Great Mercy cannot be so."

This noble Senator. Traveling thousand li coming to Guangzhou. Just for such a little matter. True so-called "Old Weak Widower Widow Disabled Young, Senate None Not Gracing." Lu Cheng heart very moved. Low voice said: "Chiefs are all people of Great Mercy. Common people none not grateful wearing virtue."

Du Yibin not like other dispatched Senators, already used to praise. Hearing this girl's words. Unconsciously face slightly hot. Said: "You overpraised."

Atmosphere just somewhat subtle. Suddenly Lu Weijia walked in from outside. Greeted: "Chief Du! A batch of goods sent here. Asking you to look over."

"I come right now." Du Yibin knew mostly things Wang Jun got for blind date grand meeting. He immediately walked to door. Only seeing several naturalized citizens pushing Gale Handcart. Full of Standard Boxes bundled above. What surprised him was Wang Jun actually came too.

"Why you came? Blind date meeting isn't opening tomorrow?"

"Opening tomorrow. So I come to arrange venue today." Wang Jun pointed at convoy. "I turned a circle in various organs in Guangzhou City alms-begging again. Got quite a few things. We hold blind date in Guangzhou first time. Need to make it grander." He said waving hand. "Everyone move quickly."

Venue of blind date meeting set in auditorium. Actually was a hall in temple in past. Because preservation relatively good. Used as auditorium. Inside besides three tables and dozens of long benches nothing else. Wang Jun commanded naturalized workers cadres cleaning auditorium once. Hanging lanterns tying colors. Moving tables from various places of Shelter temporarily again. Placing into two two opposite look. Every table placed with snacks and tea water. Also prepared many paper slips and pencils. Finally. Also a small sheep skin drum unknown where coming from.

"Wang Jun. Why placing into this face to face form? Like everyone encircling conference table meeting." Du Yibin puzzled. In his concept should be everyone sitting below. Then male side, female side taking turns going on stage introducing self. Then everyone conducting two-way selection. Writing out intended person number. Finally pairing again. Those paired counted success. Those not paired conducting next round.

"This is called Drum Beating Passing Flower Style Blind Date," Wang Jun said. "Efficiency relatively high."

In this blind date mode. Male female both sides sit opposite. Talking five minutes every time. If talking suitable can pair. Both sides can stand up leaving; Feeling unsuitable. Drum sound rings then moving position to opposite direction respectively. Changing next one.

"Civil Affairs Department held blind date in Lingao several times. I went to see. Probably just this mode. Pairing success rate still not bad. Key is saving time."

"Five minutes can talk out what. Emotion foundation not firm." Du Yibin recalled own love past events: Past exes short one three months. Long one getting along for year plus didn't reach talking marriage marrying stage.

"Looking at photo isn't it more unreliable." Wang Jun laughed. "Did you talk emotion when you went buying Life Secretary?"

"That is." Du Yibin nodded. "Free love to this generation is still luxurious a bit. Their next generation perhaps will be mainstream."

Everyone busy busy. Very quickly arranged venue well. Du Yibin recalled photo blind date meeting over there didn't finish yet. Then pulled Wang Jun over to see situation.

Already quite a few people elected suitable object. Registered at cadre place. But still many people rummaging checking in file folders on table. Senators looked. At least over half people already found suitable object. Wang Jun picked up those naturalized citizen files "With Famous Grass Owner" roughly looked. Medium disabled naturalized citizens most "Hot Hand." Especially one side limb defective. Such limb disability relatively light. Life basically can self care. Because still having labor ability. Mostly still have work. So particularly hot hand among candidates. Secondly was hearing one side or whole lost or one side vision lost. Because limb labor and life self care both no problem. So also relatively popular.

In comparison. Double lower limb lost and half body paralyzed. Whole vision lost etc. severe disabled naturalized citizens were few people asking. Only several women carrying children selected.
