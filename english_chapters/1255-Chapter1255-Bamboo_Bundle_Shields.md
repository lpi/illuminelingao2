# Chapter 1255 - Bamboo Bundle Shields

The First Expeditionary Force assembled and formed up on the beach. The three Marine companies, though thin in numbers, wielded the most powerful firepower of this timeline: Hall rifles, "typewriters," and the Trial Year 32-type battalion guns using friction recoil mechanisms—only three guns, to be sure, but they far outranged the 12-pounder mountain howitzers previously issued. They possessed a firing rate and range that no army of this timeline could endure. According to the staff officers' estimates, most contemporary armies would rout after just a few rounds.

Shi Zhiqi was in high spirits. The term "First Expeditionary Force" sounded far more impressive than "First Marine Battalion"—and far more "American." The First Expeditionary Force's uniforms had just been updated, completely abandoning the old Type 65 style of the Bobojun. They now adopted a bootleg version of the US Marine Corps combat utility uniform. Of course, the Lingao version of the MCCUU had neither camouflage nor any special fabrics—just the cotton or cotton-linen blend commonly seen in Lingao uniforms, dyed a most rustic deep blue with indigo. The caps were the signature octagonal caps.

Lingao couldn't equip the Marines with modern combat boots, so they still used integrated canvas leggings with standard Army load-bearing equipment.

Shi Zhiqi hopped off the small boat. With a pipe clenched in his teeth, a ceremonial sword at his hip, and a leather riding crop in hand, he cut an imposing figure. He swept his gaze over the Marines, already formed up—every man sharp-eyed and ramrod straight, quite in the Imperial Marine style. Feeling quite pleased with himself, he flourished the riding crop, puffed out a few smoke rings, and bellowed:

"Lads, f*** 'em all!"

"Sir, yes sir! F*** 'em all! For the Senate and the People!" the Marines roared in unison.

He pointed his crop downward: "All units, advance!"

Three companies marched in three-column formation, the fire support section with its guns and typewriters following in trace. According to plan, the First Expeditionary Force was supposed to wait for the heavy artillery to land before advancing. But the artillery transport ships hadn't arrived in time. Speed was paramount—to prevent Zheng Zhilong and his treasures from escaping, and to forestall the enemy from burning the city in desperation, Shi Zhiqi decided to advance immediately on the garrison, aiming to rout the enemy and take the garrison in one blow.

Zhongzuo Garrison's walls were less than six meters high, constructed in the traditional Chinese manner with brick-and-stone facing. Because it was only a garrison fortress, the walls weren't particularly thick—not only weak against artillery, but also lacking casemates and other protective works along the walls. Shi Zhiqi figured he could take it even without artillery support—besides, he still had three battalion guns and a platoon of assault engineers at his disposal. They could just blast open the gates with demolition charges. Shi Zhiqi certainly didn't believe Zheng Zhilong's pirate troops would want to fight him hand-to-hand inside the city—though the Japanese Guard, when their fighting spirit surged, might be willing to throw away their lives on that.

But Xu Ke, who was responsible for collecting and analyzing intelligence on the Zheng consortium, thought this unlikely. The Japanese Guards and Black Guards were essentially Zheng Zhilong's "foreign household retainers"—death-sworn warriors fattened on silver and Zheng Zhilong's last reserve. Once the garrison fell, the situation would be irrecoverable. Zheng Zhilong still needed these guards to cover his escape—why would he sacrifice them in street fighting for a mutual destruction?

"Marine Corps Songbook, page two, 'Song of the Marine Warrior'! All together!" the sergeants commanded loudly.

The Marines' iron-heeled canvas and leather-soled combat boots pounded Xiamen's sand, raising dust. The soldiers sang in unison:

*I am the Marine Corps, I am a killing weapon,*
*In the flash of crimson light I'll make your blood spray,*
*Make no mistake, this is my turf.*

*When you charge at me I'll smile,*

*For victory is mine, I am a first-rate killer, bringing death.*

*The tempering flames are already lit; stand shoulder to shoulder with me, you'll never be alone,*

*First to charge, last to leave—I know the warrior who goes never returns.*

*Swallowing fear when the enemy comes into sight,*

*Aim with your hands, pull the trigger with your will, kill with a cold heart.*

*I am the phantom advancing,*

*I am the warrior singing.*

*War-loving, battle-hungry, turning enemy lands to scorched earth,*
*Wading through seas of blood, sworn to kill every last one.*

*...*

The lyrics didn't always fit the rhythm, but several hundred robust men singing at full volume, accompanied by their heavy footfalls, resounded through the air.

Shi Zhiqi strode proudly at the head of Second Company. The First Expeditionary Force's regimental colors fluttered behind him, with his personal element's banner beside it—not only bearing his family crest but also embroidered with the medals he had earned and the locations where he had commanded the Marines in victorious battles.

"What are those barbarians singing?" Zheng Zhilong could faintly hear strains of song carried by the wind and asked.

"Reporting to the General: can't make it out clearly. Probably some kind of war song. Quite vulgar."

Zheng Zhilong raised his telescope and scanned the direction the song came from. Three columns of blue-clad soldiers were advancing across the sand toward them, their flags few, their ranks precise, their step uniform—clearly an elite force.

But by the size of the formation, there were at most five hundred men. No dust clouds from large troop movements appeared to their rear, and no herds of cattle or horses followed—so they clearly weren't dragging heavy artillery. Zheng Zhilong felt somewhat reassured: if only five hundred men were coming, his forces could still give battle.

How many troops could the barbarians transport from so far away? As long as he devoured this force, reinforcements would just be feeding the flames. Crush them as they came. Zheng Zhilong's confidence surged. He laughed: "The barbarians may have sturdy ships and fierce cannons, but they're ignorant of the art of war. Daring to attack with so few men—aren't they just throwing their lives away?"

The commanders also thought the barbarians were being overconfident and felt somewhat relieved. The younger, more hot-blooded ones, though initially stunned by the barbarian gunfire, now recovered their wits. Seeing that the enemy's land forces were few and apparently without artillery, they itched to give the barbarians a good thrashing.

"General, your humble servant requests permission to serve as vanguard! Let me blunt their edge!" A man stepped forward from the crowd—it was Lin Cha. Lin Cha was a senior commander under Zheng Zhilong, brave and skilled in battle. Zheng Zhilong had once petitioned the court for merit on his behalf.

"Your force is too small, and they're infantry. Stand down—be patient!" Zheng Zhilong shook his head. The enemy was an all-firearms unit. Though others might not understand, Zheng Zhilong maintained two all-firearms guard units himself and knew exactly what firearms could do. Lin Cha had only three or four hundred men—charge in, and they'd be cut down before they could swing a sword or spear.

"General, your servant has a method that might work against the barbarians," Lin Cha persisted.

"Speak."

"Earlier I spoke with General Tō about the power of firearms—unmatched. Even the bravest general in heavy armor cannot survive a musket ball. When fighting musketeers, the only choice is to charge forward, risking flesh and blood. But General Tō said that in Japan, there's an implement that can counter matchlocks."

General Tō was Tō Tarō—he refused to reveal his family name, so the Chinese simply used Tō.

"Continue." Zheng Zhilong was interested.

"Yes! I heard from General Tō that this implement is called a bamboo bundle shield. Multiple short green bamboo poles are bound into a bundle. Musket balls cannot penetrate..."

Zheng Zhilong thought a moment, then shook his head. "This bamboo bundle would be large and heavy. One hand can't hold it—how then to wield a weapon?"

"We split into three teams. The first carries the bamboo bundle shields in front to block bullets; the second, behind, uses all bows and arrows; the third uses saber and rattan shield troops. First, a volley of arrows, then the saber-and-shield men rush forward, cutting through with their heavy sabers and rattan shields!" Lin Cha had come prepared. He had already studied this problem and trained his men accordingly.

Zheng Zhilong turned to Tō Tarō: "Can this really work?"

"Reporting, sir: the bamboo bundle shield does work. Matchlock balls cannot penetrate it." Tō Tarō explained that in Japan, soldiers in siege assaults often carried such bamboo bundle shields to ward off musket balls.

Zheng Zhilong was tempted: "But where do we find bamboo on such short notice, and training teams in formation coordination isn't something that can be done overnight."

"Reporting, General: your humble servant has already prepared a thousand bamboo bundle shields. My men have also trained in the formations. I only ask the General's permission to lead the vanguard!"

"Excellent!" Zheng Zhilong nodded. "You've thought ahead! Very well, you shall lead the vanguard!" He bellowed: "Bring wine! I'll drink a toast to send General Lin off!"

After the toast, Zheng Zhilong ordered five dollars' bonus distributed to each of Lin Cha's men as encouragement for the vanguard. Lin Cha went to organize his troops—only about four hundred. Fearing the force was too weak, Zheng Zhilong ordered another subordinate commander named Lin Sheng to take his three hundred men in support.

Shi Zhiqi was leading his forces forward when the scouts came back to report that a force of seven or eight hundred had come out to engage them.

"First Company, Second Company, deploy into double-rank lines! Third Company, form reserve!"

Marine companies no longer included drummers and fifers—only buglers. At Shi Zhiqi's command, the bugler sounded the call. First and Second Companies deployed from march column into double-rank battle lines: First on the left, Second on the right.

"Halt! Dress ranks!"

Shi Zhiqi, with his command section, stood at the junction of the two companies. Behind him were the guns already unlimbering and Third Company forming the reserve.

With the Marines' weapons, they could easily employ skirmish line tactics. But the reequipping was too recent, and corresponding tactical training hadn't caught up, so they continued using linear volley-fire tactics. Shi Zhiqi figured that against the enemies of this timeline, linear tactics worked well enough—it maximized firepower.

Shi Zhiqi raised his telescope and looked. He couldn't help feeling puzzled—those seven or eight hundred men in the front rank were each holding what looked like a massive bundle of firewood? Thinking it over, he understood: it was meant to stop bullets.

"What the hell—this is just ridiculous." Shi Zhiqi muttered as he lowered the telescope. He drew his ceremonial sword:

"All hands, prepare for action!"

The bugle sounded its urgent call.

*Note: Bamboo bundle shields were indeed used in the Warring States period. Reportedly, they were invented by Takeda Shingen.*
