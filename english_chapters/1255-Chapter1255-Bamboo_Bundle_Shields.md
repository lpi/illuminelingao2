# Chapter 1255 - Bamboo Bundle Shields

The First Expeditionary Force completed assembly on the beach. Three Marine companies were numerically thin, but the firepower they possessed was the strongest existence in this spacetime: Hall rifles, typewriters, and Trial Year 32 Battalion Guns with friction recoil absorption devices—although only a mere three guns, their range far exceeded the 12-pound mountain howitzers commonly equipped in the past. Possessing ultra-long range and rate of fire unbearable for all armies in this spacetime. According to staff estimates, most armies in this spacetime couldn't withstand a few shots before fleeing in panic.

Shi Zhiqi was high-spirited. The term First Expeditionary Force sounded much grander than Marine 1st Battalion—and much more "American." The Marine First Expeditionary Force's uniforms were recently changed, completely breaking away from the Fubo Army's past Type 65 style, adopting a knockoff version of the USMC combat utility uniform style. Of course, the Lingao version MCCUU had no camouflage nor special fabrics, just the common cotton or cotton-linen blend of Lingao uniforms. The color was the most rustic dark blue dyed with indigo. The cap was also the iconic octagonal cap.

Lingao couldn't equip Marines with modern combat boots, so Marines still adopted integrated canvas gaiters, equipped with Army general-purpose webbing.

Shi Zhiqi jumped down from the small boat. Clenching a pipe in his teeth, waist carrying a saber, hand holding a leather riding crop, looking majestic. Glancing at the assembled Marine detachment, each spirited, backs straight, quite having the style of Imperial Marines, he couldn't help but be full of ambition. Waving the riding crop, blowing a few smoke rings, he shouted loudly:

"Lads, fuck'em!"

"Yes! Comrade Lieutenant Colonel." All Marines shouted loudly. "Fuck'em! Serve the Senate and the People!"

He waved his riding crop downward: "All units move out!"

Three companies advanced in three columns, the fire support detachment composed of cannons and typewriters following behind. According to plan, the First Expeditionary Force was to wait for heavy artillery to land before advancing. But the fleet transporting artillery failed to arrive in time. Speed is precious in war. To prevent Zheng Zhilong and his treasure from running away, and also preventing the enemy from setting fire to the city in despair, Shi Zhiqi decided to advance on the walled city immediately, striving to rout the enemy in one go and capture the walled city.

Zhongzuosuo City's height was less than 6 meters, using traditional Chinese brick-encased stone walls. Being only a Wei-Suo city, walls weren't thick. Not only was anti-artillery capability weak, but defensive works like towers on walls were also few. Shi Zhiqi felt he could take it even without relying on artillery—besides, he still had three battalion guns and a platoon of assault engineers available. Just deliver explosives directly to blow open the gate. Shi Zhiqi didn't believe Zheng Zhilong's pirate troops were willing to bayonet fight him in the city—probably only the Japanese Guard with severe *chuunibyou* flare-ups would be willing to send themselves to death.

However, Xu Ke, responsible for collecting and analyzing Zheng group intelligence, thought this possibility unlikely. The Japanese Guard and Black Guard were bluntly Zheng Zhilong's "foreign house guards," death warriors fed full with silver, Zheng Zhilong's last capital. Once the walled city broke, the general trend was irreversible; Zheng Zhilong still had to rely on guards to cover his escape. How could he bear to leave them in the city for street fighting with Marines, burning jade and stone together?

"Marine Songbook Page 2, 'Song of Marine Warriors'! Sing in unison!" Sergeants ordered loudly.

The Marines' iron-hobnailed canvas leather-soled combat boots trampled Xiamen's beach, kicking up dust. Soldiers sang loudly in unison:

I am the Marine Corps, I am a killing weapon,
Between flashes of red light letting your blood splash,
Don't doubt, this is my turf.

When you rush in I am smiling,

Because victory belongs to me, I am a first-class killer, bringing death.

Fire of tempering long ignited, shoulder to shoulder with me, you will never be alone,

First to charge, last to leave, warriors go with no return I know.

Devouring fear, when enemies enter sight,

Aim with hand, pull trigger with will, kill with cold heart.

I am a ghost advancing,

I am a warrior singing.

Loving war and fighting, turning enemy country to scorched earth,
Wading through seas of blood, swearing to exterminate all.

...

Lyrics sometimes weren't in rhythm, but hundreds of sturdy men opening throats to sing in unison, accompanied by their heavy footsteps, vibrated in the air.

Shi Zhiqi strode with head held high at the head of the 2nd Company. The First Expeditionary Force flag fluttered behind him. His personal Senator flag banner paraded alongside, embroidered not only with his family crest but also medals he was awarded and locations where he commanded Marines to victory.

"What are these Hair Rebels singing?" Zheng Zhilong heard the singing vaguely carried by wind from afar and asked.

"Reporting to General, can't hear clearly. Nothing more than some battle songs. Very vulgar."

Zheng Zhilong picked up binoculars, looking again toward where the singing came from. Three columns of blue-clad soldiers were advancing on the beach toward here. Flags were few, soldiers' ranks strictly orderly, steps uniform, obviously an elite army.

But looking at the scale of the troops, at most five hundred men. No dust clouds of large troop movements were seen behind, nor large herds of oxen and horses in the enemy rear train, obviously not towing heavy artillery. Zheng Zhilong felt slightly relieved: If only five hundred came, his forces could still fight them.

Hair Rebels came from afar; how many troops could they transport? Just eat this group first; follow-up troops would just be adding oil. Eat one group as they come. Zheng Zhilong's confidence surged. He laughed: "It's true Hair Rebel ships are sturdy and guns sharp, pity they don't know art of war. Daring to attack with so few men, isn't it just sending themselves to death for nothing?"

Generals also felt these Hair Rebels were too arrogant, feeling slightly relieved. Younger ones with hotter blood, initially stunned by Hair Rebel cannon fire, now recovered wits feeling opponent land forces were few and carried no cannons, rubbed palms one by one, preparing to give Hair Rebels a good look.

"General, this general is willing to be vanguard! Dampen their sharpness!" One person flashed out from the generals; it was Lin Cha. Lin Cha was a great general under Zheng Zhilong, brave and good at fighting. Zheng Zhilong once requested merit for him from the Imperial Court.

"Your men are too few, and infantry. Retreat for now, don't be impatient!" Zheng Zhilong shook his head. The opponent was an all-firearm unit. Others might not be clear, but he kept two all-firearm guards himself, very clear on firearm output lethality. Lin Cha had only three or four hundred men; they would be beaten to slag by Hair Rebels before having time to swing swords and spears.

"General, this general has a tactic, can fight Hair Rebels." Lin Cha didn't give up, continuing.

"Speak."

"I previously talked with General Tong, discussing fierceness of firearms, unrivaled. Even brave generals in heavy armor can hardly escape death once hit by iron guns. Fighting firearm hands, only by brave advance, fighting with flesh and blood bodies. General Tong however said in Japan, there is an implement, can overcome iron guns."

General Tong was Tōtarō—he wasn't willing to say his surname (myouji); Chinese naturally took Tong (To) as surname.

"Go on." Zheng Zhilong became interested.

"Yes!" Lin Cha said hurriedly. "Heard General Tong say, this object is called Bamboo Bundle Shield. Bundling multiple short green bamboos into a bundle, iron gun bullets cannot penetrate..."

Zheng Zhilong thought, then shook his head: "This bamboo bundled together, big and heavy, cannot be held with one hand. How to hold weapons to fight then?"

"Can divide into three teams. One team holding Bamboo Bundle Shields in front, blocking bullets. One team behind, all using bows and arrows. Last team, using shield and sword hands. First release volley of arrows, then shield and sword hands leap forward while trampling bodies, breaking enemy with broadsword and rattan shield!" Lin Cha came prepared; he had studied this problem long ago and trained subordinates on site.

Zheng Zhilong turned his gaze to Tōtarō: "Is it really feasible?"

"Reporting to Lord, Bamboo Bundle Shield is indeed feasible. Iron guns cannot shoot through." Tōtarō said in Japan, whenever attacking castles, many vanguard soldiers carried this kind of Bamboo Bundle Shield to resist iron gun bullets.

Zheng Zhilong was moved: "Only in haste, where to find these bamboos? Organizing teams to coordinate drill is also not a matter of one morning or evening."

"Reporting to General, this humble officer has already prepared one thousand Bamboo Bundle Shields. Subordinate soldiers have also practiced the formation. Only request General let this general fight!"

"Good!" Zheng Zhilong nodded. "Rare that you have the heart! Since so, you will lead the vanguard!" Saying this he shouted: "Bring wine! I drink to send General Lin off!"

After drinking send-off wine, Zheng Zhilong ordered men to reward Lin Cha's subordinates five silver dollars each as encouragement for the vanguard. Lin Cha took men to reorganize troops; his subordinates were only four hundred men. Zheng Zhilong, fearing insufficient strength, ordered a subordinate general named Lin Sheng to take his own three hundred men to coordinate in battle.

Shi Zhiqi was leading troops forward. Scouts ahead returned to report, saying a team of seven or eight hundred men came out to meet them.

"1st Company, 2nd Company deploy into double column line! 3rd Company as reserve!"

Marine companies no longer established drummers and fifers, only buglers. Following Shi Zhiqi's command, the bugler's bugle sounded. 1st and 2nd Companies deployed while marching, spreading into a double column line. 1st Company on left, 2nd Company on right.

"Halt! Dress ranks!"

Shi Zhiqi led the direct-controlled squad at the junction of the two companies. Behind him were cannons already beginning to unlimber and the 3rd Company acting as reserve.

In terms of Marine weapons, they could totally adopt skirmish line combat mode. But changeover time was short; corresponding tactical training hadn't kept up. Thus they continued using line infantry tactics. Shi Zhiqi felt against enemies of this spacetime, line infantry tactics weren't bad—could fully unleash firepower.

Shi Zhiqi raised binoculars to look, feeling strange unaware. These seven or eight hundred men, every one in the front row held up a gigantic firewood bundle? On second thought he understood; this was used to block bullets.

"Damn, this is too funny." Shi Zhiqi muttered, putting down binoculars. Drew command saber:

"All units prepare for battle!"

Bugles blew rapidly.

Note: Bamboo Bundle Shields were indeed used in the Warring States period, said to be invented by Takeda Shingen.
