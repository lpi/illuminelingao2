# Chapter 2399: Zhong Xiaoying's Request

"There's another trick here," Doctor Zhong said, getting into it. "The chili powder produced in Lingao usually contains a certain amount of salt. If you want the cold noodle soup to be saltier, add a lot of sugar instead of salt. Hanshi side dishes are the same principle: add more sugar instead of more salt. Side dishes can also have crushed sesame, crushed peanuts, and other nut powders added to enhance the fragrance."

Chu He took another sip of soup. Indeed, the soup base had a distinct sweetness. Compared to what he had eaten on Jeju, the flavor seemed heavier. He didn't know if this taste could be accepted by Cantonese people...

Looking at the dining department's business, the occupancy rate was about one-third—quite good for this time of day. But he noticed most customers were naturalized citizens. That is to say, this type of cuisine actually hadn't been accepted by locals yet.

Just as he was musing on the topic of "how to guide consumption," a female server suddenly came to his side and quietly asked: "Excuse me, are you Chief Chu He?"

Chu He was startled. Park Jihyun immediately put down his chopsticks, looking at her alertly.

"I am."

"There's a guest who would like to see you. Could you possibly meet them?"

Chu He thought: this is my first time in Guangzhou! Moreover, he was unfamiliar with most Senators in Guangzhou. Could it be that his reputation had already spread, and some local native big shot was rushing to flatter him, wanting to tag along with the Nanyang Company?

This wasn't impossible. After all, in a place like Zhongyi Trading Company, Senators would definitely frequent it. Waiting by a tree stump would eventually catch a rabbit.

"Yes." Chu He didn't hesitate. Regardless of the other party's motive for the invitation, as the future leader of the Guangzhou Exchange, broadly contacting local big shots would be very useful for future work.

"Please follow me to the private room. The guest is waiting."

Park Jihyun didn't even have time to wipe his mouth before blocking: "Chief, this isn't safe. Have them come here to see you!"

Chu He smiled: "You're overthinking. This is the Great World, Doctor Zhong's property. What are you afraid of?" Saying this, he stood up: "Lead the way."

"Comrade, you needn't worry," the female server smiled. "The private room is just upstairs."

Chu He followed the female server to a private room on the third floor. Upon entering the private room, he saw sitting inside a long-haired young woman wearing a woolen pinafore dress with a thin wool short jacket. Seeing him enter, she immediately rose to greet him, bowing deeply: "Uncle Chu."

Chu He was startled again. Looking at the young woman's clothing and makeup, he originally thought she was some Senator's life secretary. But the other party called him "Uncle," which wasn't how life secretaries or even naturalized citizens addressed people. Only little Senators or second-generation Senators could call him that.

He had met all the little Senators in the Senate. As for second-generation Senators, the oldest hadn't even started elementary school yet—they couldn't possibly be this eighteen or nineteen-year-old young woman.

He couldn't help showing a wary expression: "You are..."

"Uncle doesn't recognize me? I'm Zhong Xiaoying."

"Oh oh... so it's you." Chu He suddenly understood, thinking how could he have forgotten her! Come to think of it, when Doctor Zhong came to Jeju to survey Seongsan and build the astronomical observatory, she had come along.

"So it's Xiaoying." Chu He's face immediately relaxed. "I really..."

As Doctor Zhong's adopted daughter, Zhong Xiaoying had considerable fame in little Senator circles. Although she didn't study at the Academy, she was familiar with most little Senators inside and visited frequently. She was the one with the highest status and greatest fame among the Senators' adopted children.

"Uncle Chu is busy with work and it's been a long time. It's normal not to remember me." Zhong Xiaoying smiled. "Please sit down."

Compared to the innocent sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl in his memory, the Zhong Xiaoying before him was much more mature, completely adult in appearance.

Chu He immediately became suspicious: Doctor Zhong rarely cared about mainland strategy. Why did he suddenly send his adopted daughter to Guangzhou? Zhong Xiaoying coming to Guangzhou at this time must have a reason—could it also be for the Nanyang Company matter? Wanting Zhongyi Trading Company to get involved? But there was no need to specifically come find him. Buying shares was an aboveboard matter...

"This time Father sent me to Guangzhou for preliminary investigation about establishing schools locally." Zhong Xiaoying seemed to guess what he was thinking and immediately explained. "Also to look after Science Department's industries. I invited Uncle Chu here because I personally have something I'd like to ask your help with... To be honest, I only thought of this after seeing Uncle Chu today."

"It's nothing, nothing. Doctor Zhong and I are old acquaintances from Jeju. Whatever you need help with, just ask."

"I just arrived in Guangzhou a few days ago. Recently I heard Uncle Chu is leading the Nanyang Company project..."

"Ahem, I need to clarify. The Nanyang Company is Zhou Wei's project. I'm not with the Nanyang Company. I'm only responsible for fundraising, the securities side of things." Chu He quickly clarified.

"I think, since you're leading the Nanyang Company's fundraising, you must be quite familiar with Uncle Zhou."

"Yes, yes, quite familiar." Chu He understood immediately—this young lady had something she wanted to request.

I'm indeed "quite familiar" with Zhou Wei, but this familiarity belongs to the kind of not-so-pleasant "familiarity." Chu He naturally understood that although Zhou Wei and the "Seven Senators" now seemed harmonious and intimate, who knew what grudges might be harbored in his heart.

But he didn't want to lose face in front of the young woman. He immediately put on a dignified air: "Is there something you want me to tell Zhou Wei?"

"Yes," Zhong Xiaoying lowered her head. "Uncle Chu may not know, but I and some girls from the Academy have a sailing club..."

"I remember, I remember." Chu He immediately recalled the sensational "Storming Lingao" incident back then. At that time, Qian Duoduo and several girls had made quite a splash. "You still have a ship, called Xiaocang, right?"

Zhong Xiaoying raised her head with some pleasant surprise: "Uncle Chu, you know?"

"Of course I know." Chu He greatly enjoyed this kind of adoring gaze from girls. "And Qian Duoduo, Zhang Yunmi..."

"I didn't expect Uncle Chu to know our club so well." Zhong Xiaoying's initial sense of distance immediately disappeared. "Since that's the case, I won't beat around the bush. Our club has a foreign girl..."

This "foreign girl" was Sonia Lily Sharper. Since after the auction, she had become Lin Hanlong's life secretary. A year ago when Lingao established its museum, Sonia officially started working there, and also participated part-time in several exploration team surveys of various islands along the mainland coast, all of Hainan Island, and southern Taiwan.

"...Sonia heard that Southeast Asia is going to be officially developed. She's very interested and wants to participate in the action. But..." Zhong Xiaoying's face showed a difficult expression. "She doesn't know how to bring it up with Uncle Lin."

"Lin Hanlong won't let her go?"

"Not exactly. It's just that she feels Uncle Lin has been very magnanimous already, allowing her to go out and work, even letting her join overseas surveys, visiting many coastal islands and Taiwan Island. If she now proposes going to Southeast Asia—gone for at least half a year—she doesn't dare bring it up again. After all, she's still a slave..."

Chu He nodded: "I understand. You want Zhou Wei to approach Lin Hanlong about this, right?"

Zhong Xiaoying clapped her hands and laughed: "Uncle Chu, you're so smart! If Uncle Zhou says the survey needs her, Uncle Lin probably wouldn't object."

Not so sure, little one! Chu He thought. This Zhong Xiaoying was still too naive. Were surveys of Hainan Island, southern Taiwan, and coastal islands large and small the same as surveying Southeast Asia? Not to mention the great risks of surveying Southeast Asia, Sonia's sailing skills were quite formidable. What if she took the opportunity to run away during the survey? Could Zhou Wei bear this responsibility?

If it were an ordinary life secretary, running was running. The problem was this girl was not only knowledgeable herself but also clever and eager to learn. Working at the museum for several years, she had learned and accumulated a great deal of new knowledge. She was already a very important assistant to Lin Hanlong.

If she really ran away or had some other accident during the survey, it would offend Lin Hanlong terribly.

He thought for a moment and said: "This isn't difficult. I'll go talk to Zhou Wei about it."

"That's wonderful. I'll thank you on Lily's behalf." Zhong Xiaoying had no idea of the intricacies involved. She happily clapped her hands. "Uncle Chu, you're so kind!"

"It's nothing, don't be so polite." Chu He felt guilty inside and gave a few dry laughs. "I have other things to do, so I won't chat with you longer..."

Zhong Xiaoying stopped him and handed over a small ceramic jar with a rattan shell: "This is a nourishing paste I made myself. Inside is top-quality Korean ginseng and Liaodong deer antler, the best for replenishing vitality. I heard Father say you've been overworking. I thought this could nourish your body. Please don't despise it."

"Ah, this is really too kind..." Chu He only felt his face burning. "You father and daughter are both too kind. I'm unworthy, truly unworthy." Saying this, he quickly took the jar and left.

Downstairs, Park Jihyun was craning his neck to look. Seeing him come down, he immediately came forward:

"Chief, are you alright..."

"Nonsense, what could happen to me?" Chu He scolded him, casually handing the jar over. "Hold this!"

"I mean, is there anything important?" Park Jihyun took the jar and asked again.

"No, no."

"Then why is Chief's face red?"

"Spirit... Just ate cold noodles, hot from that!" Chu He feared this fellow would say something more exasperating. "Let's go, we're going to the walnut pastry shop!"

The two left Zhongyi Trading Company and walked along the road for a stretch. The air suddenly filled with a rich baking aroma.

"Chief, that shop up ahead is it." Park Jihyun reminded.

Looking carefully, in front were three or four storefronts with a wooden shop sign hanging outside, carved with two large characters "Zhang's," with two slightly smaller characters below: "Pastry Shop." Next to it was another line: "Main shop in Nanhai County..." The rest Chu He couldn't see clearly, but presumably it was the main shop's address, thereby indicating their "authenticity."
