# Chapter 972 - Qimu Island

Following the outline Xu Ke had given him, he focused his inquiries on several officers who would lead the Dengzhou Mutiny: Kong Youde, Geng Zhongming, Li Jiucheng and son, and others.

But Sun Yuan didn't know much about them. He only knew they had all come from the Dongjiang garrison originally. After Mao Wenlong's death, they had clashed with the current Dongjiang Commander Huang Long and had all come to Dengzhou. The only one he knew better was Geng Zhongming. Geng was in the headquarters staff and had more contact with retainers like them.

Here in Dengzhou, troops from various places gathered. The local Shandong troops were the most arrogant, followed by the guest troops transferred from the south. Commander Zhang Keda mainly relied on the southern troops. The Liaodong troops who had come from Dongjiang somewhat skulked about. As a Shandong soldier, Sun Yuan didn't think much of them. In his view, if not for the Dengzhou-Laizhou navy guarding the islands in Bohai Bay, braving wind and waves to transport provisions to Dongjiang, the Dongjiang garrison holding Lüshun would have been finished long ago.

However, he said Sun Yuanhua treated the Liaodong troops who had transferred to Dengzhou-Laizhou quite well. Not only did he favor the officers, but family members evacuated from Lüshun, Jinzhou, and other places were also given housing. Thus Sun Yuanhua's prestige among the Liaodong troops was relatively high.

"Those Liaodong fellows stick together tight. That Kong Youde you asked about has high prestige among them, and the Governor treats him quite courteously." He spat. "If the Governor hadn't taken him in at Dengzhou-Laizhou back then, that homeless ghost would have been left on some island eating salt sand in the wind—now look at him strutting about."

He then mentioned that the Liaodong troops had many cavalry. Kong Youde's command alone had over a thousand cavalrymen, which was why Sun Yuanhua treated him so differently.

Huang Ande mostly listened, rarely speaking. Occasionally he would refill Sun Yuan's wine. Having gathered enough information, he proposed going into the water city to visit old friends and relatives.

Sun Yuan laughed: "What's difficult about that! Craftsmen and laborers go in and out every day. Tomorrow I'll talk to the squad leader for you—just mix in with the group. So many people come and go in the city—it's nothing important."

Huang Ande couldn't help but despise the lax security—things he wouldn't have thought twice about before now seemed improper after becoming a Fubo Army soldier.

When they had drunk to satisfaction, both parties parted happily. The next day, Huang Ande smoothly infiltrated the water city. Using visits to old friends and relatives as his excuse, he wandered around inside. He already knew most of the facilities and their locations from before—this was just reconfirmation.

While Huang Ande was playing "spy" in Dengzhou, Lu Wenyuan, according to prior arrangements, traveled to Longkou to survey possible locations for a land base.

In the Ming, Longkou lay within Huang County, and Huang County was where Kong Youde and the Ming army would fight their seesaw battles. Therefore, the site had to be as far as possible from the battle zone. The General Staff's final choice was Qimu Island in Longkou Bay.

Qimu Island was a long, narrow peninsula extending from Longkou into Bohai Bay, surrounded by sea on three sides. Its area was approximately four square kilometers. Its southern part was an open golden sand beach; its northern part bordered sea cliffs. The entire island connected to the mainland via a sand spit about ten kilometers long and one kilometer wide, like a giant arm extending into the sea.

Even in the twenty-first century, Qimu Island had only been developed as a tourist area. In the seventeenth century, it was merely a barren peninsula with only a few small fishing villages and almost no inhabitants. Most of the island's land was saline-alkaline or sandy, unsuitable for cultivation.

But for the Elders, this was an excellent base site. Qimu Island was surrounded by sea on three sides. With just a few naval vessels and a small core force, combined with mobilized militia holding fortifications on the sand spit, the entire island's security could be ensured. The four-square-kilometer island was sufficient to accommodate many refugees. The only disadvantage was fresh water scarcity, though it wasn't entirely absent. The guide said there were still some streams and springs of "sweet water"—meaning fresh water—in the hills on the island's north side. Wells dug on the island also yielded water, but that was "bitter water"—only good for washing. Combined with a rainwater collection system, it could just about supply refugee needs.

This location, within Huang County but quite remote, attracted little attention. It was thirty kilometers from Huang County seat and only sixty kilometers from Penglai—the core zone of the Dengzhou Mutiny. If intervention was needed, forces could quickly enter battle. Moreover, this was all wasteland no one wanted in the seventeenth century—it couldn't grow crops. Very suitable for a Senate that needed to "live frugally."

Lu Wenyuan rode on horseback, feeling the whistling sea wind on his face—and this was still summer. What would winter be like? Thinking how even in the twenty-first century the Bohai Sea often froze over large areas, the Little Ice Age of this timeline would surely mean "a thousand *li* frozen, ten thousand *li* of drifting snow." Being an "estate master" here blowing sea wind and watching frozen seas wouldn't be pleasant.

Thinking that he would have to be estate master here for at least two years, Lu Wenyuan's heart, heated by hormones, gradually cooled. Shandong lasses were certainly attractive, but he also needed to take care of himself to have the energy.

Among the party were several trusted men sent by Sun Yuanhua. Zhao Yingong's proposal to establish an estate in the Longkou area of Huang County to recruit refugees for coastal agriculture, along with plans to build a church, had moved Sun Yuanhua. He specifically sent people to accompany Lu Wenyuan for this matter.

"Master Lu!" The guide saw the party continuing to push deeper into Qimu Island and couldn't help calling out. Though Qimu Island wasn't large, the sand spit was quite long—reaching the end would take at least another half hour. And there was nothing to see along the way. Except for some hills at the island's northern end with somewhat scenic views, everywhere was just sand flats and saline-alkaline land. He strongly suspected this young Master Lu had some kind of mental illness, insisting on sightseeing on this barren island and looking at land plots.

"What is it?" Lu Wenyuan spoke what passed for Mandarin with a strange, stiff accent.

"The island is the same all the way to the end—all sand and saline-alkaline. Can't farm, and lacks water," the guide advised. "Please turn back, sir."

Lu Wenyuan said: "I specifically want saline-alkaline land. Let's go! Keep looking ahead."

The guide silently cursed this incomprehensible Guangdong barbarian but had no choice but to lead them on. Finally reaching the end, Lu Wenyuan gazed out against the sea wind. South of Qimu Island was Longkou Bay—in the old timeline, this was where Longkou Port was located. Qimu Island's peculiar geography actually served as a breakwater for Longkou Bay, making it a natural harbor. On the southeastern coast of Longkou Bay, many sailed-down fishing boats were moored. Faint outlines of market streets could be seen on shore—obviously much more prosperous than Qimu Island. The reason was simple: the south shore of Qimu Island facing Longkou Bay was all sandy shallows where large ships could hardly approach.

No wonder there were no merchant ships landing here, and even the fishing village was small. If fishermen settled here, they could only use small fishing boats, and even mooring was difficult—there was almost no natural harbor or dock along the coast.

"What are those ships?" he asked.

"Merchant ships from Tianjin Wei and the south," the guide said. "Ships from the north sell grain; ships from the south sell paper and sugar. Return cargoes are local dried seafood. The merchants have built some warehouses at that fishing village."

Lu Wenyuan nodded. Future development in Longkou would have to be on the southeastern shore of the bay. Qimu Island wasn't suitable as a port. He saw a tall earthen mound on the opposite shore, somewhat like the beacon towers in Lingao, and asked: "Is that a beacon tower over there?"

"Indeed. That's Longkou Mound. It's said it was built during Emperor Hongwu's reign by one of the dukes. Longkou is named after that beacon mound."

He surveyed the surroundings again. In the northern part of Qimu Island was a hilly area with several peaks. Though not high, they had some undulation and appeared lush and green. If an estate was to be established, a mountain hollow would be a suitable location—at least it would be sheltered from wind. And the guide had said the island's "sweet water" surface sources were all in the hills.

He had the guide lead them up into the hills, observing the terrain as they went. He memorized the landforms, and when he couldn't remember, he sketched them on the spot. Soon he had roughly drawn up a development plan in his mind: where to site the estate, where to build artillery batteries, where to construct lookout posts, where to build docks and piers, and where to settle refugees when they arrived.

He enthusiastically climbed to the island's highest peak. Warm sunshine gently scattered down. The eastern coast had sand white as a whetstone, glittering with golden light. The western cliffs were craggy with strange, jagged rocks; occasionally tall rock pillars protruded from the sea. Warm breezes blew gently, making him feel refreshed throughout. He couldn't help but silently praise the picturesque scenery.

Standing on this highest peak, he could clearly see the entire layout of Qimu Island. Strictly speaking, Qimu Island proper didn't include the nearly ten-kilometer sand spit. The entire island was almost entirely covered with hills, with higher elevation in the north and lower in the south. The island had seven mountain peaks of various sizes: Old North Mountain, Lighthouse Mountain, Phoenix Mountain, Battery Mountain, East Mountain, West Mountain, and Snake Mountain. Of course, these names were given by modern people. In this timeline, they were just nameless hills.

Though the mountains on the island weren't high, the scenery was pleasant: "Mountains with the rugged heights of Phoenix and other peaks; waters with the vastness of the Bohai; caves with the depth of Dragon Grotto; rocks with the grandeur of General's Stone." Quite a fine landscape of mountain and sea.

The island's west side had endless blue waves—the necessary passage for all ships entering and leaving Longkou Bay. The island's north had sheer cliffs: "clouds shifting like snow waves dotted with light gulls"—a place to enjoy mountain and sea, experiencing both morning sunrises and evening scenes. The island's south was the golden sand shallows—where shallow-draft small boats could anchor. Looking east from the island, the sea was calm—that was Longkou Port, one of the six major northern ports.

"Does this land have landlords?" Lu Wenyuan asked.

"This is just a fishing village—where would landlords come from?" the guide said. "Who would farm here, unless they've gone mad!" Realizing his slip, he quickly added: "This land can neither be farmed nor used for residences or graves. What use is buying it? Except for some land around the fishing village that has owners, most is government land."
