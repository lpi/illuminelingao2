# Chapter 264 Entering the Treasure Mountain

To save time, the exploration team split into two groups again here. One group, led by Wang Luobin personally, went to Tiandu to inspect the mine, while the other group, led by Chen Haiyang, stayed locally to build Yulin Fort.

Finding Tiandu was much easier than finding Shilu. One only had to go upstream along the Tiandu River to find Huangni Ridge; the famous Tiandu Iron Mine was on this ridge.

The exploration team switched to a rowboat and continued upstream along the narrow bay. Both banks were continuous mountain ranges covered with dense vegetation. Some of them had been here in another spacetime and tried hard to search for familiar scenery.

"We should be roughly advancing along the G224 route." Wang Luobin looked at the map. "We might arrive in just 2 kilometers."

At noon on April 20th, the Tiandu Exploration Team successfully found the mouth of the Tiandu River. According to map judgment, this was not far from Da'an. In the past, it would only take a few kilometers to reach the location of the future Tiandu Town. However, whether Tiandu Town itself was the location of the Tiandu Iron Mine was another matter; the iron mine was still about 2 to 3 kilometers away from the town.

The exploration team abandoned the boat and went ashore here, going upstream along the river. The river valley was surrounded by dense primordial tropical rainforest, making it difficult to see the distant environment. After walking less than 2 kilometers, a river valley area appeared before them, with several villages nearby. Wang Luobin stopped, calculated for a long time with the map and compass, and then announced that this was Tiandu Town.

"Tiandu Iron Mine is still a few kilometers ahead. Keep it up, everyone."

With Wang Luobin's encouragement, the group continued upstream along the river. The road by the river was difficult to walk. This place abounded with various snakes, insects, and leeches. Various flying insects wove through the air. Fortunately, everyone was equipped with a full set of tropical gear as required: mosquito net hats and full-body covering tropical fatigues. Especially at the openings of the clothes, anti-leech gaiters were added. Walking past certain wetlands, the sight of rows of land leeches on branches collectively "standing up to welcome" when they sensed people coming gave everyone goosebumps.

"Check your cuffs and pant legs!" Liu Zheng issued instructions.

After passing the river valley zone, Wang Luobin let everyone rest for a while to shake off the leeches on their clothes and gear, and check if anyone had been "hit." Thanks to the protective measures being in place, although the leeches worked hard, their best result was merely drilling their heads into the outer layer of the canvas. However, seeing the mess of leech corpses on the ground, Wang Luobin felt that developing Tiandu might not be so simple.

"I wonder if large-scale spraying of insecticide would work."

"No need for insecticide." Liu Zheng observed the worms twisting in death. "Changing the ecological environment here can finish them off. It's too humid here; if we fill in the swamp areas, they will naturally disappear."

After walking forward for less than 1 kilometer, a wide river valley appeared ahead, surrounded by mountains. This should be the location of Tiandu Village. The famous Tiandu Iron Mine should be on the Huangni Ridge to its southeast.

The problem was that the vegetation here was too dense; no matter how he looked, he couldn't tell which mountain ridge had yellow soil. Although the mining area of Tiandu Iron Mine covered five or six square kilometers, the diameter of the pit developed later was only three hundred meters. Finding this specific spot would still be somewhat difficult.

"Besides being close to the port, the development difficulty here is no less than Shilu." Wang Luobin said, "A large amount of vegetation needs to be removed; the engineering volume is huge."

"It would be great if we could build a railway; both machinery and manpower could be transported in."

"The problem is that we lack manpower." Wang Luobin sat on a big rock. "When the Japanese mined Tiandu back then, they relied on filling the pit with human lives in exchange for ore. What we lack most now is human lives—"

"What's difficult about that? Any Manchurian captives we catch in the future will all come to mine." Liu Zheng's nationalist sentiments burst forth. "And those Southeast Asian Malay natives, let's just do a slave trade! Use them as consumables!"

"Those are things for the future. Who do we use to fill the pit right now? It's difficult." Wang Luobin gazed at this barren virgin land. The people of the exploration team were spreading out in all directions, using instruments to survey the mine and hammering rock samples. Some were also mapping the terrain here.

In the afternoon, based on data from later generations, the exploration team had roughly detected the location of the Tiandu mine and dug exploration trenches. According to Wang Luobin's instructions, they were to dig out one ton of sample ore.

"Dig so much? Are we carrying it back on our backs? Do you expect to make steel just from this one ton of iron ore?"

"We need to send it back for trial smelting. The steel plant doesn't have such small furnaces." Wang Luobin felt even one ton was too little—this kind of iron ore with over sixty percent content could go directly into an open-hearth furnace for steelmaking, which would require two experiments.

"Fine, but I'll say this upfront: everyone has to join in carrying the ore. Otherwise, just us few in the exploration team will be worked to death."

Immediately, the entire exploration team began digging ore, sweating profusely. Fortunately, one ton of ore wasn't too much; with more than ten people digging, it only took an hour.

After sampling the ore, the exploration team completely covered and filled the exploration trenches of the mine with soil—this resource could not be known to the locals for the time being.

Tiandu Iron Mine was also an iron ore with extremely high iron content, so much so that during the Guangxu reign, a local gentleman used only small square furnaces and a dozen workers to mass-produce pig iron bricks to supply the market, making a huge profit for a time. Wang Luobin did not wish for such a thing to be staged in advance at this time.

"Everyone rest well tonight. Tomorrow we go to Damao."

"Where is Damao now?" Liu Zheng was covered in sweat and dirt, wanting to go into the water to bathe but afraid of encountering leeches. He was full of discontent, hoping to return to the seaside tomorrow for a good bath, when suddenly he heard Damao pop up out of nowhere.

"It's a manganese mine with reserves of 1 million tons." Wang Luobin said, "This is an important raw material for manufacturing special steel."

"Boss, you won't want another ton of sample ore, will you?"

"One ton isn't needed." Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. "500 kilograms is still required." Everyone glared at him.

The next day, the exploration team advanced inland again. Before setting off, Wang Luobin called the fleet via radio, instructing Chen Haiyang to send people to transport the ore, and specifically warned: "Ensure secret transportation; especially, do not let the locals know what is being transported."

After arriving at the location said to be the Damao Manganese Mine, the exploration team began to lay out points and dig exploration trenches across the entire mining area. This place was much harder to find than the Tiandu Iron Mine. After tossing and turning for five or six days, the exploration team almost turned into marmots, turning over the surrounding soil layer. Chen Haiyang had finished transporting the iron ore and still didn't see the exploration team return, so he hurriedly sent another batch of people over to help dig trenches.

In the end, they did discover a small amount of manganese ore outcrop, but the real vein went ten meters deep underground. The difficulty of mining was quite significant.

"Engineer Wang, I think we should forget about this manganese mine for now—" Liu Zheng looked no different from a coal miner, "The shallowest part is ten meters deep, and water comes out from below. Without digging tunnels, I'm afraid there's no hope."

Wang Luobin looked at the dark exploration trench before him. Open-pit mining was probably out of the question. But digging tunnels involved a series of supporting projects: drainage, ventilation, tunnel hoisting, support... With all this stuff, even using indigenous methods entirely would be a huge project.

"Let's mine a few dozen kilograms of sample ore and withdraw." Wang Luobin appeared helpless.

"Look at this, what is it? Is it copper ore?" Suddenly someone showed him a piece of ore.

Wang Luobin picked it up and looked. It was a gray stone block but had a light green, glass-like luster. He weighed it in his hand, then scratched it with his Swiss Army knife to test the hardness.

"I didn't expect to find good stuff here after all!"

"What?!" Several people around him gathered around.

"This is phosphate rock!" Wang Luobin was very excited—one of the transmigrator's divine tools, matches, could only be born with this stuff. In this sense, phosphate rock was much more useful than manganese ore. He struck his lighter and burned a corner of the ore. The flame glowed green.

"Absolutely correct, this is phosphate rock!"

The use of phosphorus was known to basically everyone. Even if they didn't know it was used to make matches, they knew it was an important farmland fertilizer. Now that phosphate rock was discovered next to the manganese mine, the discovery that originally felt somewhat lackluster suddenly became extremely valuable.

"Where was it found?"

"Just on that small hill." The person who discovered the ore quickly pointed out the location. Wang Luobin was more excited than when he found the manganese mine and rushed to the exploration trench.

The exploration trench was driven into the slope of the small hill at an angle of about 30 degrees for about four or five meters. Wang Luobin hadn't studied geology, but he could roughly tell that the core of this small hill was mostly composed of phosphate rock, which also did not constitute conditions for open-pit mining. This disappointed him a bit.

"At least one base can support two mining sites." He consoled himself this way. However, judging from the recent stage: it was more realistic to go to Dongsha or Xisha to mine guano.

Most of the exploration team didn't think that complicatedly. Everyone enthusiastically dug another five hundred kilograms of sample ore to bring back to Lingao for the chemical and metallurgical departments.

When the exploration team returned to Yulin Harbor, the infrastructure project was just one-third completed. Yulin had mountains, water, land, timber, and stone; it lacked almost nothing. It was truly a good place for developing a base. This place was different from Changhua Fort. The purpose of Changhua Fort was merely to obtain a trade stronghold and foreshadow the future mining of Shilu. This place was a large distribution center for resources obtained by the Transmigration Group, so it had to be much larger in scale than Changhua Fort.

The accompanying Zhang Xingpei from Lingao Construction Company was an expert in wood structure building and also one of the many "returnees" in the Transmigration Group, with full-process house-building experience.

Especially since the consultant was Yu Eshui—this person participated in this circumnavigation inspection purely with the purpose of coming out to play. After experiencing a painful seasickness in the first few days, he had now become lively and volunteered to be the architectural consultant for Yulin Fort—he was obsessed with survivalist fortresses and had a special interest in logistics and city defense case studies.

"It doesn't need to deal with sieges, but at least it must ensure that a small number of people can defend a large amount of goods."

This was the key point Yu Eshui extracted after listening to Wang Luobin's long-winded list of base requirements.

Zhang Xingpei used to be fat. He had lost a lot of weight in recent months, but he still had that unhurried manner of fat people. He coughed before saying:

"How big does the freight yard need to be? What goods roughly? Must there be shelter?"

"The goods should be ore, timber, coconuts."

"That means there needs to be a relatively large storage yard." Zhang Xingpei looked for a while and sketched a simple floor plan on a notepad.

The drawn design was just a simple large courtyard, square in shape. A bastion was set at each corner. One was the living area, larger in area, capable of accommodating about twenty people for long-term residence, and equipped with a warehouse. The other bastions also had complete living facilities, accommodating up to a squad. The courtyard gate was right next to the living area, facilitating defense. The courtyard wall was a wooden wall erected with timber side by side, with soil piled at the bottom, 6 meters high, all sharpened at the top, and not walkable on top. Basically, it was impossible to climb without a ladder.

The four bastions, including the gate itself, were built with brick and stone. The roofs were tiled. A moat was dug outside the fort, diverting river water from nearby. There was heavy rainfall here in summer and autumn, so water usage was not a problem.

To facilitate loading and unloading of goods, a pier of more than ten meters would be built in the bay in front of the fort for ships to dock.

"Is it a bit too flimsy—" Chen Haiyang looked at this design diagram resembling a medieval fortress and was very worried.

"Defensive power is slightly lower, but it's enough. Local rich men's stockades haven't reached this level yet." Yu Eshui said, " The defense of Anyoule Market is just a wooden palisade wall plus a few towers. It shows that the biggest threat here is just a few dozen pirate sailors coming up to wander around and rob a few unlucky guys who didn't escape in time."

Even if the enemy really rushed into the yard, the things they could snatch were nothing more than ore and timber, which didn't seem to have much value. If they really wanted to attack forcefully, Anyoule Market was obviously a more valuable target than Yulin Fort.

While everyone was discussing details, the team doctor Jiang Qiuyan suddenly asked: "Who do you plan to leave behind at this Yulin Fort?"

"For now, leaving eleven or twelve people is enough. Two or three transmigrators plus a squad of marines. We can expand the scale later based on the development situation."

Jiang Qiuyan said, "Engineer Wang, I think this won't work. How many people does the Transmigration Group have in total? Scattering pepper like this everywhere—too few won't work, too many wastes talent. Not to mention our own people, just the Marine Corps would be short three squads this way."

"That's true. Stationing troops here and there, I always feel we don't have enough troops." Chen Haiyang had long been troubled by the shortage of naval forces. Whether sailors or marines, the Maritime Power Ministry felt stretched.

"And have you considered a problem? Placing a few transmigrators alone in this desolate land, surrounded by nothing but themselves—not to mention natives, they won't even see many living people. Limited by conditions, the Executive Committee can't possibly equip every stronghold with comfortable living facilities. Over time, won't these people all have mental breakdowns!" Jiang Qiuyan gestured excitedly, making people feel that he himself was about to have a mental breakdown.
