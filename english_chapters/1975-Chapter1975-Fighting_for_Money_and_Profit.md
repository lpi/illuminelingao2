# Chapter 1975 - Fighting for Money and Profit

Night had fallen on Guangzhou city, which stank from the excavation and dredging everywhere. The daytime noise gradually faded into darkness, but one room in the Guangzhou Municipal Government was still bustling with noise.

Yes, a Senate meeting attended by all transmigrators in Guangzhou was being held here. Originally a very ordinary regular meeting, the atmosphere became heated because of the Q1 Guangzhou Tax Statistical Report brought by Ai Zhixin's group.

The attending transmigrators—tall, short, fat, thin, men, women, old, young—were all gearing up, faces full of expressions like they were ready to devour a fat meal. Everyone held a kraft paper document bag or folder containing "materials."

As soon as Ai Zhixin finished the tax work report, the transmigrators in the conference room couldn't wait to start asking Liu Xiang for budgets.

"Oh my, this is quite a lot of money. Grand Magistrate Liu, don't forget what you promised me. There are many dilapidated houses in the Five Immortals Temple, and I promised Hu Qingbai to allocate part of the temple buildings to run a National Primary School..."

"Fatty Cui, what's the rush? You clearly have plenty of offerings from big households—can't you ask the moneybags to donate for running a primary school? Didn't you recruit several gentry families into the religion? Old Liu, this Guangzhou city is full of pits; we can't not fill them, right? Roads can't go unrepaired, right? And leveling bridge slopes, dredging inland rivers... I think we should increase investment and tidy up the environment quickly."

"Old Liu, since the plague ended last time, our medical system's vitality hasn't recovered. Now we have to bear medical support and epidemic prevention for the entire South China Army. Personnel, equipment, and venues are extremely scarce. This is a fundamental matter concerning the great cause of liberating all Guangdong and the welfare of people in the whole city and province. We can't handle another plague..."

"Liu Xiang, according to our previous resolution, our police system isn't fully staffed yet—and many civil tasks require our cooperation. Not enough personnel won't do..."

"Mayor Liu, after the last civil service exam, the Cadre Training School has started running. But if we want to persist in this method as a system, there's still a significant gap in teacher and personnel expenses..."

"The Planning Commission has approved the new urban area plan on Henan Island. Although construction costs are allocated by central finance, the preliminary preparation investment still has to come from us locally in Guangzhou. We aren't even a grassroots troupe now—at least we need to build a department, right?"

...

Looking at the crowd of hyper-excited transmigrators holding reports and Liu Xiang who sat silently playing with a pencil, Ai Zhixin and his two colleagues looked at each other. Exactly how many bad checks had Liu Xiang written before? Everyone lacked money, and Liu Xiang lacked money even more; they knew this long ago. Otherwise, Grand Magistrate Liu wouldn't have called every two days and inspected every three days, caring so passionately about tax collection work. Other department transmigrators were the same—giving venues when asked, giving personnel when asked, extremely cooperative. Naturally, this wasn't out of "comradely friendship," but because everyone was waiting to carve up this pot of fat meat cooked by the Finance and Tax Bureau. But today's explosive scene still exceeded their expectations. They originally thought everyone would sit together amicably, ticking boxes with pens and having a verbal debate.

The Wang couple had hung around Wudaokou for years and knew the Senate's financial issues clearly. Many expedient practices passed muster in the past because the territory was small and people few, relying on direct central financial management. Now they couldn't muddle through anymore.

Meng Xian sat there looking calm and composed. He also brought a table today. This was a Quarterly Treasury Tax Entry Table produced by the bank according to the format for mayoral review in the old timeline and the template provided by Zhang Xiaoqi, after the Delong Guangzhou Branch officially acted as the National Treasury in the name of the Central Reserve Bank Guangzhou Branch. Originally he didn't intend to speak on revenue issues today, but Ai Zhixin found him yesterday and talked a lot, insisting he help beat the drum regarding fiscal payment issues. Looking at this, Ai Zhixin was going to suffer a bit tonight.

"Alright, alright, I know everyone's requests; I remember them all. Aiyaya, Old Cui, stop blowing about your temple expansion. You lack money, I lack money too..." Seeing the meeting upholding the tradition of going off-topic, sliding from revenue allocation to future vision painting, Liu Xiang hurriedly stood up to shout for the brakes: "It's not certain if this money can be used yet!!"

Instantly, the conference room fell silent.

"Ahem, let me explain to everyone," Wang Qiyi saw everyone quiet down and spoke up voluntarily before Liu Xiang called names. This was agreed by the three before coming: Ai Zhixin would only make a concluding statement at the end; the Wang couple would take the flak upfront. This way they could have maximum maneuvering room depending on the situation. As long as Ai Zhixin, the "Chief" Director, didn't misjudge, they could pass safely. After all, previous words were said by "Vice" Directors.

Wang Qiyi didn't report selectively or add embellishments. Everyone was a transmigrator; exposure in the old timeline would surely enable them to understand the reasons. So explaining the situation completely was being most responsible to himself.

First, governments at all levels under the Senate now had their own independent fiscal accounts. This meant the days of directly withdrawing money from the bank with slips issued by Wudaokou like before were gone forever. According to the new fiscal system, although confiscations, war booty, taxes, slightly similar profits handed over by enterprises like Purple Light Pavilion, Purple Precious Studio, South China Sugar Factory, and monopoly funds from tobacco and salt were still handed over to the National Treasury, governments at various levels couldn't directly use National Treasury money. They had to wait for the National Treasury to allocate funds to local fiscal accounts according to regulations before localities could withdraw expenses from their own level's fiscal account.

Second, currently the Senate hadn't established tax budget levels, which meant all tax revenue belonged to the Center. Although tax funds were collected from Guangzhou and deposited into the National Treasury at Guangzhou Delong, the owner of the tax funds was the Central State Council. Under the current system, Guangzhou had to wait for the Center to issue a fiscal appropriation notice. After the Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau received the notice and sent an appropriation letter to Guangzhou Delong, Guangzhou Delong would allocate tax funds from the National Treasury to the Guangzhou Municipal Fiscal Account according to the stipulated amount for the Guangzhou Municipal Government and departments to withdraw and use. Before receiving the Center's notice, one could say not a penny of the tax funds on the Q1 report belonged to Guangzhou City.

"My f*ck!" Before Wang Qiyi finished, someone jumped up. "Talking so much, turns out this money has nothing to do with me!"

"Exactly, exactly. This is even worse than before. At least before, we could use part of what we collected ourselves. Now it's great, we have to wait for notification from above for everything!"

"This is 'running to the ministry to beg for money,' right!!"

"According to you, is Guangzhou now a pauper without a penny to its name?"

...

The conference room was in chaos.

"Everyone quiet down, listen to me for a moment." Meng Xian saw the situation was wrong and hurriedly came out to save the scene. "The banking system is independent. All departments opened their own accounts at Delong before; surely everyone knows this, right?"

Meng Xian referred to the requirements made by the Senate to standardize fund usage by departments after the Second Congress. Everyone had worked in "Central Ministries" before coming to Guangzhou, so they weren't unfamiliar with this.

"Actually, this is just the beginning, starting from finance. Fiscal [reform] is also inevitable. Without doing this, however chaotic the funds of our departments and stations were back then, that's how chaotic governments at various levels will be in the future."

Seeing everyone's emotions stabilize and silence return, Meng Xian struck while the iron was hot: "Regardless of whether other areas can catch up to the 21st century, at least I feel our basic government management systems should align with the 21st century. Besides, Old Wang just meant the requirements before fund allocation; he didn't say money wouldn't be given to everyone."

"Old Wang, oh, and Director Ai." Liu Xiang pondered for a while and spoke slowly. "You remain the Finance and Tax Bureau; collecting and issuing money are both with you. You are professional enough, and the system is surely correct. But I, this Guangzhou, also need to eat. Previously, I relied entirely on money from confiscations returned by finance to stay alive. Look at this whole Guangzhou: roads need repair, trash needs clearing, street security, and the plague that just passed, etc., etc. Oh right, we also recruited a new batch of civil servants; your Finance and Tax Bureau took quite a few too. Does this not all require money? Not to write bad checks, but which transmigrator sitting here doesn't urgently need money to build Guangzhou well, into a beacon on the continent? Originally I had to write reports to above every time to get money. Listening to you, not only do I have to continue reaching out to above for money, but even the money I use to stay alive now requires a report to use? Isn't this killing us?"

Ai Zhixin's scalp tingled from Liu Xiang's words. If he entangled on policy or system, with the Wang couple there, he feared nothing. But now Liu Xiang obviously knew he couldn't win playing the professional card, so he switched to playing the emotional card, the moral card, and pulled other department transmigrators in Guangzhou along. This was hard to parry. Just as Ai Zhixin was thinking how to play Tai Chi—to fully express his stance without leaving handle for criticism—Wang Qiyi spoke first: "You are worrying too much about this. We are all for the Senate, for our transmigration cause; how could we choke everyone's neck on money usage? New methods for new matters, old methods for old matters. That money absolutely won't be cut off."

"But, I still have no money in hand, right," Liu Xiang obviously wasn't that easily fooled. "Although tax funds in Guangzhou city come from Guangzhou, they must first be fully handed over to the Center, then we wait for the Center to distribute. Correct?"

" simply put, that's the meaning, but..." Wang Qiyi weighed his words, recalling the line agreed with Ai Zhixin earlier. "Our system is in its infancy; many things are expedient. We also thought of the part you're worried about, Old Liu. We made a plan before; Ai Zhixin also gave everyone a heads-up, right? Since everyone finds it so vexing to have money but unable to get it, why don't we discuss it first?"
