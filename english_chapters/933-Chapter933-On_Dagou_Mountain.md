# Chapter 933 – On Dagou Mountain

Qian Shuixie waited until he saw the team's two military dogs carefully lowered into the small boat in special sling bags before saluting Li Ziping. He put on his steel helmet and climbed down the net ladder off the ship. His personal orderly followed him down—because he had a wife, Qian Shuixie hadn't dared to openly keep a female orderly by his side. He had to go through normal procedures to select a nimble-handed sixteen-year-old lad who could wash clothes and cook to be his orderly. This lad was originally a runaway slave from Guangdong. As the saying goes, "no one is sharper than a palace eunuch"—in this era, people who served as slaves generally didn't lack smarts. Qian Shuixie was served very comfortably and had a good impression of him, so he gave him the name Chandler.

Chandler was a naturalized citizen with indentured servant status; he had no right to choose his own name. Generally, names were assigned using original surname plus a purification camp name. If the registers showed too many people with a certain surname, the surname might even be changed. But once one gained a transmigrator's favor and became an adopted child, apprentice, personal attendant, or orderly, one could receive a surname bestowed by the transmigrator. For naturalized citizens, this was a huge honor. The General Office also recognized this practice and issued corresponding certificates of bestowed surname.

Although Chandler was an orderly, he was also a full member of the Special Reconnaissance Team, with decent training scores. Carrying Qian Shuixie's stuffed large field pack, he climbed down the net nimbly. Because the Special Reconnaissance Team trained at high intensity and was on 24-hour combat readiness, their food standards had always been high. Recently, they had been adjusted to the same standard as transmigrators, guaranteeing not only fish at every meal but also daily intake of the scarcest油脂 (fats/oils). So physically, they were a cut above ordinary naturalized citizens.

"Is everyone here?"

"All present!" the NCO reported to him.

Qian Shuixie raised one hand high and brought it down, three times in succession: "Move out!" he ordered loudly.

The sailors on the rowboat immediately worked the oars, and the boat slowly headed for shore.

Two rowboats were lowered from the *Haitian*. One carried the fifteen members of the landing survey team; the other carried marines with a "Typewriter," serving as a fire point inside the lagoon to directly cover the landing team if necessary.

Li Ziping ordered the ship's cannons and "Typewriters" to go to full alert, ready to open fire to cover the landing detachment if enemy attack occurred.

They soon landed near the mouth of a relatively large freshwater river flowing into the bay. Although the *Haitian* didn't plan to establish a permanent camp here this time, the survey and Special Reconnaissance teams planned to conduct two or three days of reconnaissance and survey activities nearby, so they had to set up a temporary camp where fresh water was available.

The coast was exceptionally desolate. The beach was empty; no villages or houses were visible along the shore. But from faint traces of residue on the beach, he could tell people frequently came to the seaside and lagoon. Clearly the Pingpu natives weren't far from the sea. The reason they didn't live right on the coast was to prevent pirate attacks.

The marines began setting up a crude camp at the river mouth, while Qian Shuixie led the team inland along the river—his primary task was to ascend Dagou Mountain and observe the surrounding environment from a high vantage point, allowing the survey team led by Liu Zheng to draw a rough topographic map of the Dagou Harbor area. This place would later become a new base for the Transmigration Group. Wu Nanhai's Agricultural Committee had long been drooling over the Tainan Plain, which could be developed on a large scale.

Heading inland, apart from small patches of woods, everywhere was deep grass and brush. Approaching summer, vegetation was at its densest—not only was the path difficult, but mosquitoes and insects were numerous. Just walking disturbed clouds of various bugs. Liu Zheng was a seasoned trekker and knew the dangers of insects in such terrain; moreover, Taiwan was known for malaria hazards. Thus, all members of the landing survey team were wrapped up tight, wearing high-top canvas boots and wide-brimmed hats with mosquito nets.

Dressed in this gear, walking was naturally inconvenient. Combined with the deep grass and dense forest, although they landed at noon, the survey team didn't climb the main peak of Dagou Mountain until after four in the afternoon.

Despite the desolation along the way, they still saw many traces of human activity: faintly discernible paths in the grass, traces of once-cultivated fields. At the foot of Dagou Mountain, they even discovered traces of a native settlement that had completely collapsed and been buried. Clearly people had lived here, and in significant numbers. Based on the size of the settlement and traces of fields, Liu Zheng believed at least four or five hundred natives had lived here.

Where had these natives gone? It was generally believed they had been attacked and killed by pirate Lin Daoqian during the Jiajing reign, with the whole tribe migrating inland to "Ahou Forest." But data from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Ren Fu's account both indicated these natives should still be not far from the coast, rather than deep inland. Therefore, immigrants landing at Kaohsiung were bound to conflict with the local Pingpu tribes.

Dagou Mountain was over 300 meters high. With their high-powered binoculars, it was enough to see the terrain for over ten square kilometers around. What appeared before their eyes was the vast Kaohsiung Plain. Although the inland plain in their field of view was largely desolate grass and bush, occasional crude villages and surrounding reclaimed paddy fields could be seen.

"There are still quite a few natives here." Liu Zheng frowned. "Best to clear them out in one go, otherwise conflicts later will be troublesome..."

Qian Shuixie didn't speak. Survey team members were marking discovered settlements one by one on the map. Judging by the number and size of discovered settlements, the legendary "Takau" (Dajarriang/Taccariang) tribal group had at least over two thousand people. Dutch records stated they could field four or five hundred armed men at a time.

In terms of tribal distribution in Taiwan at the time, the Takau group was a large tribe not inferior to the Sinkan tribe of Tainan. Historically they had been in constant conflict with the Sinkan until the Dutch intervened, expelling the Takau group from the Kaohsiung Plain.

"To drive the natives out of here, we'll need at least an infantry company, plus militia." Qian Shuixie estimated the required troop strength.

According to historical data, the Christmas Campaign launched by the Dutch in 1635, which defeated the Takau tribe and forced their submission and inland relocation, involved 500 men plus 500-600 Sinkan allies. Primitive tribes generally mobilized all men as soldiers, so it could be inferred the tribe had at least a thousand able-bodied men. Otherwise the Dutch wouldn't have mobilized such a large force. The expedition against the Takau was one of the few large-scale military operations the Dutch conducted in Taiwan.

Liu Zheng said: "The advance party should land in winter after the typhoon season ends."

Summer was coming fast. Summer meant not only rampant mosquitoes but also many typhoons; ship navigation and the landing of personnel and materials would be greatly restricted. If things went wrong, epidemics could break out. At the end of 1631, massive numbers of immigrants from Zhejiang and Shandong wouldn't yet be available; starting a full-scale landing and construction in Kaohsiung at that time would still be timely.

"Also, winter vegetation withers, visibility is better. Good for observation. Look at this density," Liu Zheng pointed at the hillside. "Those tribesmen could easily hide hundreds of people in there, and you wouldn't spot them until they were right in front of you..."

Qian Shuixie nodded. Subtropical Taiwan certainly wouldn't be cold in winter, but this was the Little Ice Age; temperatures in southern Taiwan should be a few degrees lower than in the 21st century. Even in Hainan at lower latitudes, some vegetation showed obvious signs of withering in winter. The Dutch choosing to launch their expedition at Christmas clearly took this factor into account.

Since it was late, Qian Shuixie decided to camp on the mountain and wait until early next morning to descend and push inland.

The survey team found a spring by several large rocks at the peak. The area was flat with large stones and little vegetation. Fresh water was nearby. It was a good place to camp. The two agreed to bivouac there for the night. Liu Zheng had men build a bonfire under a clump of small trees and sent others to scatter sulfur and lime around the camp to drive away potential snakes and insects.

Reviewing a dinner of field rations—though they had seen deer, wild boar, and other animals on the way up, out of caution and health concerns Qian Shuixie hadn't permitted hunting. Even so, the famished team members devoured the field rations like a whirlwind. Chandler prepared a nice dinner for Liu Zheng and Qian Shuixie using transmigrator-special field rations, which the two ate with relish.

"Your orderly is very capable." Liu Zheng praised.

"Yeah, very capable, pity he's like us, haha." Qian Shuixie lit a farm-produced cigar with a stick from the fire, puffing smoke. "Not multi-purpose."

Liu Zheng teased him: "I think young Qian looks pretty good."

"I'm not gay, nor one of those sour scholars of the Ming," Qian Shuixie chuckled. "Speaking of which, for someone with a wife like me, having a maid is something I dare not even think about. Even with the wife in Guangzhou, living apart, I have to be well-behaved..."

Of course, Qian Shuixie nominally had a maid currently on the *Feiyun*, he just couldn't develop things in that direction.

"Listen to you, as if I didn't bring a wife," Liu Zheng said.

Qian Shuixie recalled that Liu Zheng indeed had a wife, and she was quite good-looking with a nice figure. He heard she used to be in the arts. At the annual meeting, Liu Shuixin had sung a few songs—a classically trained professional.

Liu Zheng said: "I hear the General Office is opening some Lingao Zhiming House or something. How about it—when we get back, let's go for a sauna together?"

"Besides. I'm far from the Emperor and the wife is far away. If your wife doesn't object, we'll go."

"No problem." Liu Zheng said. "Just a bath and a back rub—what's there to object to?"
