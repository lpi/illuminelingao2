# Chapter 2762: The Capital (Part 114)

"So we also have to focus on exporting culture, right, culture!" Leng Ningyun spoke more and more enthusiastically, "And scientific knowledge! Now the Senate's export of technology is still too conservative, either all basic theoretical knowledge or completely outdated stuff. The former is like Kangxi learning mathematics, purely a 'gadget' for rich people to show off skills; the latter, although it can make money, is still too shallow for those who know the trade."

"Your thinking has really opened up this time coming back." Xu Ke joked.

"Not at all. I have been thinking about how to transform traditional society all these years. We chatted idly on the Senate forum, but actually didn't hit the point. We Chinese people are actually the most pragmatic. Regardless of what technology or culture, we look at whether it has output. 'Black cat or white cat, the one that catches mice is the good cat.' If you want to spread technology and culture, you must first let everyone realize that your stuff is profitable."

"But in this way, won't basic disciplines be ignored by everyone?"

Leng Ningyun was stunned, then couldn't help but laugh loudly: "This is the Great Ming in 1637. Most common people can't even get enough to eat. When they go to sleep at night, they don't know if they will lose their little lives tomorrow. Even for officials, as long as their brains are still a bit clear and they can see the general trend, all are worried, thinking about saving the nation from extinction. Asking them to learn basic science, isn't this forcing people to do what is difficult?"

"But if you want to spread it, people have to spread it for you..."

"This naturally relies on the battlefield to obtain." Leng Ningyun said, "A few days ago I reviewed the history of the late Qing. Speaking of which, the scenes of the last years of a dynasty are all familiar. The Qing government's attitude towards foreign culture and technology also went from the shock and rejection of the First Opium War to the learning and introduction of the Second Opium War, and finally starting the Self-Strengthening Movement. There is a process."

"You mean fight another war, and the Great Ming will start a 'Kun-Strengthening Movement'?"

"Yes, there are many people with insight in the court and opposition. I have been in the Capital for a long time and deeply feel that the late Ming is not as dull and conservative as the late Qing. Social thought is much more active. Although there are many pedantic, stubborn, and self-enclosed scholar-bureaucrats, there are also many people with broad knowledge and open consciousness." Leng Ningyun said, "People like Li Luoyou have become more and more numerous in recent years. Those with simple ideas just want to use Kun guns and Kun cannons, mastering Kun skills to control the Kun; those with deeper insight already have a certain feeling about our advantages in technology, system, and culture..."

"There are quite a few people who know we have advantages. Like Liang Cunhou. Logically speaking, he is the clearest. Now he has become the number one anti-Kun element, vigorously drumming up Anti-Kun and Restore-Ming in Guangzhou City..."

"Seeing clearly doesn't mean accepting. Every system has its martyrs. Liang Cunhou just holds the thought of the Great Defense between Hua and Yi (*Hua Yi Da Fang*) and is unwilling. Actually, if you read the history of late Qing, the Qingstream conservative faction opposing Westernization always existed. Conservative and progressive, this is an eternal struggle."

"Alright, let's not talk dialectics." Xu Ke became interested, "What do you plan to do?"

"Naturally, I can't do anything now. A method like Zhao Yingong's is too ostentatious and eye-catching. Although the effect was great, it relied entirely on the Special Investigation Team to back him up to avoid messing up. I am in the Capital and dare not do it even more." Leng Ningyun shook his head and said, "My view is that the Senate must take Tianjin as an open port in the future. In recent years, we have opened up north-south maritime transport. Tianjin Wei is much more developed than in the past and can serve as an important infiltration point for our new culture and new system in the future."

"Wait until the Third Anti-Encirclement Campaign is victorious, and you can still raise winds and make waves in the Capital."

"Raising winds and making waves might be possible, but to do it like Zhao Yingong, I don't have the guts." Leng Ningyun laughed, "Unless the Senior Grand Secretary is Wang Luobin, the Seal-holding Eunuch of the Directorate of Ceremonial is Xiao Zishan, and the Admiral of the Eastern Depot is Ma Qianzhu..."

The two burst into laughter. As the laughter faded, Leng Ningyun said: "Saying nothing can be done seems too much. If the Third Anti-Encirclement Camapign produces a situation very favorable to us. I want to formally invest in running a newspaper. Actually, there are many things like Capital Gazettes (*Dichao*) and tabloids in the Capital now. Some are propaganda materials transported through the Shanhai Five Routes channels. They are very popular in the Capital, and people pass them around in every teahouse. But this is not the same thing as a newspaper after all."

"Good guy, you are going to snatch Dingding's rice bowl."

"If he is willing to come to the Capital to run a newspaper, I welcome him too. After all, professional talents still rely on his system." Leng Ningyun said, "Reform, modernization, making revolution—none can do without the fueling of news media. At the very least, there is an enlightening effect. If it really starts, sales won't be a problem. Dingding will have to send me a silk banner."

Xu Ke liked his humorous and straightforward attitude very much. Since they talked about this, he just happened to talk to him about the positioning of the future Bejing Station.

"Before I came, Center chatted with me about the positioning of the Beijing Station. After discussion, we felt that in the past, you balanced commerce and intelligence, which was actually somewhat risky, and your energy couldn't cover it. So after discussion, it is better to let you focus your main energy on managing business and collecting open intelligence, making a cut with secret line work. This is not just Delong; all shops of the Shanhai Five Routes must do this."

Leng Ningyun nodded: "I also think this is more appropriate."

"Correct. Secret intelligence and secret operations are done by specialized intelligence agencies. The Shanhai Five Routes are chickens that lay golden eggs; using them for adventure is too unworthy." Xu Ke said, "The Foreign Intelligence Bureau will arrange another station in the Capital in the future. You will not have lateral contact, only vertical contact."

"Good." Leng Ningyun suddenly thought of something, "What about He Lian Sheng?"

"They will still do their old trade, security work. I discussed with Jiang Shan too. It is inappropriate to let He Lian Sheng get involved in too many secret operations. First, it violates the moral values of this group of people; second, the people in the bodyguard agency are too complex."

Yang Tianliang hadn't thought about tea or rice for days, not even going to the place where he "went to work."

His formal position was the Manager of the Sutra Factory (*Jingchang Zhangsi*), which counted as "making it" among the eunuch group. But this position could not satisfy his desire by far.

As the name suggested, the Sutra Factory was the place where books were carved and printed in the Royal Great Within. It mainly printed classics, histories, philosophers, collections, and Buddhist and Daoist scriptures. Although structurally it was managed by the Directorate of Ceremonial, the most prominent yamen in the Twenty-Four Yamen, serving as a managing eunuch inside didn't allow him to enjoy any power dividends.

Naturally, there were various customary fees and earnings, but these were fixed things and couldn't be more. If talking about earning extra money, it was nothing more than reselling inventory books and printing plates. Yang Tianliang looked down on this kind of labor-intensive small money.

But his adoptive father's ability also stopped here. When the Nine Thousand Years was in power, he almost couldn't keep this errand. If he hadn't reacted quickly and bribed the eunuch party members heavily in time, the father and son would probably have been swept out long ago.

After the current Emperor came to power, Yang Gonggong finally mixed into the job of Seal-holding Eunuch of the Bell and Drum Division relying on old relationships from the past. But for Yang Tianliang to go a step further, it was as hard as climbing to heaven.

He drilled in many ways and finally got Wang Zhixin's promise. The bright road was instantly paved before his eyes.

However, these twenty thousand taels of silver became a roadblock. He originally thought his adoptive father would generously open his purse for his future. Unexpectedly, what he got in return was a reprimand, telling him to "stop delusional thinking" and "working honestly is the proper way."

Yang Tianliang hated in his heart. The father and son had had a rift for several years. From the initial Gao family silver matter to the recent series of events where his adoptive father forbade him to deal with Delong again, their feelings had gradually faded. Originally thinking that his adoptive father could help him once in such a matter involving his future, expectedly he was so decisive!

So he thought of Liu Sha and wanted to ask him if there were any opportunities to make money. During their chat, he told the other party about Yang Gonggong bringing ten thousand taels of deposits to Delong. Liu Sha expressed extreme interest.

The adoptive father not giving him money was unkind to him; Delong's Shopkeeper Leng refusing to lend money was unjust. The wealth of these unkind and unjust people should be taken via the Way. Yang Tianliang and Liu Sha hit it off instantly and engaged in the dirty work of plotting kidnapping and extortion.

They were not doing the dirty work of "Inviting the God of Wealth" for the first time. But after all, it involved Yang Gonggong, and Leng Ningyun counted as a figure in the Capital. No matter how bold Yang Tianliang was, he had to weigh it. Unexpectedly, Liu Sha patted his chest and told him not to worry, "When the sky falls, there is a tall person to hold it up."

Yang Tianliang didn't know who this "tall person" was. But seeing Liu Sha confident, he naturally believed it. After plotting secretly, the two pulled in several people and prepared the Ningyou Temple in the West Garden as a place to hide the hostage.

After some plotting, everything went smoothly. Leng Ningyun was successfully "invited," and next was waiting for silver. Ten thousand taels was indeed a lion's open mouth, but there were indeed exactly ten thousand taels in Delong's bank.

During these days, Yang Tianliang really walked with wind. In his heart, he calculated over and over again that after the silver was in hand, Yang Gonggong would "die of a sudden illness," he would formally enter the Directorate of Imperial Horses to serve, and his adoptive father's savings of decades would also be in hand—he didn't know the specific amount of this silver, but there was at least seventy or eighty thousand.

Unexpectedly, his wishful calculations all fell through. Not only was Ningyou Temple raided and Leng Ningyun rescued, but even Liu Sha disappeared. He sent a small eunuch to Tongzhou to contact Liu Sha, but waited bitterly at "Hou Garden" for several days without meeting anyone.

"Could this Liu Sha have sold me?!" Yang Tianliang was secretly alarmed. But on second thought, it seemed illogical. What benefit could he get by selling him?

What he worried about most was Yang Gonggong's attitude. If his adoptive father knew that he plotted to eliminate him, with his power in the palace, making him lose his errand and have a hard life would be easy. Seeing he couldn't bring out money, Wang Zhixin would turn around and treat him like trash!

Just as he muddled along uneasily day after day, suddenly one day a small eunuch came to report: Yang Gonggong invited him over.
