# Chapter 430 Moli Xuan Academy (Part 1)

The courtyard of Moli Xuan originally had many jasmine plants, but over the years, quite a few had died. This time during the restoration, new ones were replanted. Li Xiaolü also did landscape design for the garden, building Suzhou-style garden walls with lattice windows and constructing rockeries and ponds. In the end, this newly restored Moli Xuan took on the same style as many fake antique buildings in the original space-time.

Wang Ci was dumbfounded watching it. Lingao had never had the concept of private gardens. Apart from the small water and rock decorations in the back courtyard of the county yamen for relaxation, Moli Xuan was considered the best man-made landscape in the county, often serving as a venue for local officials and literati to hold elegant gatherings and banquets.

As for how short the entire construction period was, Wang Ci also found it hard to imagine—he hadn't seen the Short Hairs use any special mechanical aids, and the number of workers used wasn't particularly large either. By Wang Ci's estimate, if he organized people to do the repairs himself, it wouldn't be possible in less than half a month. Not to mention that the Australians had also expanded and added quite a few new buildings on the old site of Moli Xuan.

Besides the original buildings, the construction team added several structures, including a two-story waterside pavilion for gatherings and banquets, classrooms and dormitories built in modern style, and toilets and bathhouses.

When Wang Ci saw the many new buildings added, he couldn't help but seek out Xiong Buyou, who was coordinating at the construction site, to ask what these buildings were for.

"Of course, they have uses," Xiong Buyou smiled. "Moli Xuan was an academy in the past, wasn't it?"

Moli Xuan had been an academy since the Song dynasty, going through cycles of prosperity and decline. It had served as an academy for a long period in the Ming dynasty as well, but by the time Wang Ci arrived in Lingao, the academy existed in name only. The reason was simple—no money.

The county school was already short of funds, let alone a charitable school like Moli Xuan that relied on private funding. Originally, it also had about a hundred *mu* of land as a source of funding for the charitable school, but over the years, some had been fraudulently sold while others were occupied by powerful landlords. It had long become a muddled account. Without funds, they couldn't hire capable teachers or provide stipend silver, so naturally there were no students.

"Chief Xiong means to restore Moli Xuan Academy?" Wang Ci said excitedly.

"Of course. Otherwise, what's the point of repairing it? Just for drinking?"

"This is truly an immense kindness!" Wang Ci excitedly bowed deeply. "This student bows on behalf of Lingao's scholars..."

"Alright, alright, no need for formalities." Xiong Buyou thought to himself: don't rush to represent anyone. You don't yet know this thing is actually a sugar-coated bullet: it tastes very sweet now, but later you'll find out what's inside.

After the Moli Xuan renovation project was completed, Lingao County held an "enthusiastic," "simple," and "harmonious" ribbon-cutting ceremony. Wu Mingjin originally didn't want to appear at the Short Hairs' event, but the renovation of Moli Xuan was a major event for the county, belonging to the category of beneficial influences on education. Not appearing might seem "out of touch with the people." So he had to show up.

Wang Ci was once again exploited by the Crossing Group. He spared no effort running everywhere, delivering invitations for the Moli Xuan ribbon-cutting ceremony to all the gentry and scholars in the county. The Executive Committee estimated that, given Moli Xuan's fame and significance locally, these people wouldn't likely refuse to attend.

Sure enough, not only did all the provincial graduates and *xiucai* in the county say this was a momentous occasion that they absolutely had to attend, but even Liu Dalin, whom the Executive Committee hadn't been very confident about, indicated that this was a major event beneficial to the county's cultural education and he had to come. Not only that, Wang Ci also secured calligraphy for the commemorative stele from the *jinshi* Liu.

Liu Dalin, though still having some misgivings about the Crossing Group, had nevertheless observed over this past year or so all the things the Crossing Group had done in Lingao—bandit suppression, road construction, disaster relief, resettling the poor. Though he stayed behind closed doors, his family members were constantly gathering news outside.

He was a *jinshi* residing at home, with great fame in the county and even throughout Qiongzhou Prefecture. He figured he was certainly a target of this group of Short Hairs' covetousness. So these past days he only stayed at home reading, not going out and barely receiving guests. Only a few close relatives and friends could see him when they came calling. He kept arsenic and a knife by his side, ready to take his own life at any moment—first, to avoid the humiliation of capture. He had participated in planning the campaign against the Short Hairs, and it was said quite a few Short Hairs had been killed. They might well come for revenge. Second, in case the Short Hairs tried to force him to take a position in their puppet administration, he could die to prove his integrity. When the Short Hairs first entered the city, the atmosphere at the Liu household was extremely tense—not just Liu Dalin himself, but even the family members and servants were prepared for the entire household to meet its end.

Unexpectedly, after the Short Hairs entered the city, they withdrew again, merely sending a few dozen pirate heads to the county. In the several months that followed, except for swarming into the city for a stroll during the New Year, the Short Hairs never again entered the city in large numbers. As for the Liu household, absolutely no one came calling—it was as if the Short Hairs didn't know there was such a person as Liu Dalin in Lingao.

*Jinshi* Liu had originally imagined countless times how the Short Hairs would burst into his residence, hold knives to his throat, and how he, unyielding to force, would either die cursing the bandits or take poison... But none of the scenes he imagined ever occurred. No one came to the door seeking revenge, nor did anyone come with honeyed words and threats to coerce him into taking a puppet position. While he relaxed, he also felt somewhat bereft—these Short Hairs really had no discernment.

The family members, unaware of Liu Dalin's various thoughts, breathed a sigh of relief seeing that the Short Hairs didn't come to harass them. When family members relayed outside news to him, Liu Dalin never expressed any opinion, but inside he was secretly surprised—what exactly were these overseas Australians, who claimed to be descendants of the Song, scheming for in Lingao?

The Australians suppressed bandits and built roads in Lingao, established workshops and water conservancy projects—not a single thing wasn't beneficial to the country and people. They had come from ten thousand *li* away, leaving their homeland, to come to this small southern frontier county of the Great Ming to do all this. In this era, there was no concept of "Lei Feng spirit." Liu Dalin couldn't see what practical benefit they could gain from "learning from Lei Feng" in Lingao.

With Liu Dalin's political wisdom, he naturally understood this was the Australians' move to win hearts. Only winning hearts in Lingao seemed to have little value—this place was so remote and poor. Even if the Australians could turn the entire county to bandits, what of it? Even if they had greater abilities and could occupy all of Hainan Island, that was still just a corner of the South Sea.

When Wang Ci came to deliver the invitation, the family members strongly advised Liu Dalin not to appear and to stay low-key—though it was a good thing, if the government troops recovered Lingao in the future, it would be hard to explain when old scores were settled. But Liu Dalin didn't see it that way.

In his view, regardless of what the Australians were scheming, their repairing the Confucian temple, renovating Moli Xuan, and subsidizing the revival of Moli Xuan Academy was an extremely good thing for the locality. As the only *jinshi* in Lingao's history, not attending such an occasion might hurt the scholars' feelings. Furthermore, always hiding at home, he could never grasp the Australians' intentions. Better to be generous and go out to walk around and see. Seeing is believing. Finally, since the Australians hadn't done anything seeking revenge or forcing him to take a "puppet position" for over a year now, they probably wouldn't do it now either—besides, the Australians had never raised their flag or fired their cannons, nor had they driven Wu Mingjin away. This Lingao County was still the Great Ming's Lingao County.

Liu Dalin's acceptance of the invitation and writing of the stele inscription caused a great stir among the scholars and gentry of Lingao. For a time, the news of the Australians repairing the county school and Confucian temple and rebuilding Moli Xuan became the talk of the county. Even the scholars who had previously gossiped about their various actions had to admit that the Australians were "inclined toward cultural education."

To reduce resistance from local scholars and gentry, Xiong Buyou, though conducting a modern ribbon-cutting ceremony, deliberately minimized the display of the Transmigrators' strength. Only Xiong Buyou and a few others came to the scene. They carried no obvious weapons. Everyone at the scene was happy and harmonious.

The ceremony was a blend of ancient and modern. After both sides' leaders made speeches, Wu Ya personally unveiled the stone stele inscribed by Liu Dalin, *Record of the Chongzhen Renovation of Moli Xuan*. After the red silk slid down, Xiong Buyou and the few Transmigrators behind him couldn't help but applaud, and surprisingly, the natives around them followed suit.

Wu Mingjin elegantly cut the ribbon with a silver pair of scissors—this was the only part of the entire ceremony that caused discussion among the scholars, everyone feeling it was too extravagant. As for this pair of scissors made of over two *liang* of silver, it became a thank-you gift for the ribbon cutter.

After the ribbon cutting, everyone toured the newly renovated Moli Xuan, quite curious about the newly added facilities and furniture. Those who had more dealings with the Crossing Group knew that the study halls newly built here actually followed the format of Australian schools.

What made the scholars most envious was that Moli Xuan now had a library—inside were already stored over a hundred finely printed books of various kinds, newly printed by the newly established printing factory of the Light Industry Department. Representative classics were selected from the Hundred Schools of Thought and the Classics, Histories, Philosophers, and Literary Collections. The originals used were mostly Zhonghua Book Company's punctuated editions and Taiwan Academia Sinica's electronic versions. The quality of the editions was first-rate in the Ming dynasty. The scholars competed to read them.

Flipping through these books with exceptionally clear characters, snow-white paper, and refined binding, everyone couldn't help but marvel. In the meantime, a debate broke out between the pro-punctuation and anti-punctuation factions: the former believed having punctuation in books was a good thing, while the latter argued it would damage understanding of the original works.

But regardless of whether there was punctuation or not, Lingao had never in its history had such a complete library, public or private. The shock this brought to the scholars was immense. Weren't the Australians from a "barbaric land"? Why could their books be printed so finely? Moreover, the textual collation of each book was clearly the product of enormous effort—this was definitely not something a barbaric land could achieve. Could they really be descendants of the Song, the orthodox inheritors of Chinese civilization? Many scholars felt their sense of the distinction between Chinese and barbarian beginning to waver.
