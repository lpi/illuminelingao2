# Chapter 132: The Radio

Zhang Yuchen knew: outdoors somewhere, in some dark corner, in some back alley, or in some quiet courtyard room, someone sat before a radio—carefully turning dials, headphones on—a hunter cautiously stalking prey through the airwaves...

The imagination stopped there—because the mental image of this radio hunter wore Flying Fish robes. Zhang Yuchen shook his head—escaping spy-movie fantasies. The Brocade Guards lacked direction-finding equipment. But right now, he was doing exactly what hunted radio operators did.

*Transmigration Political Security Bureau Personal Assessment of Transmigrator Zhang Yuchen (Top Secret):*
*"Born XXXX/XX/XX. Joined transmigration enterprise XXXX/XX. Han ethnicity. Political orientation: moderate socialist. Personality—gentle, approachable with friends, taciturn; merciless toward enemies. Noble character, no bad habits, clear social ties. Expertise: communications and cryptography. Evaluation—a rare professional expert—"*

Zhang Yuchen had worked in telecommunications. Due to cryptography expertise, he was transferred to Intelligence for this Guangzhou underground operation as radio operator.

The new assignment initially unsettled him—but imagining himself as a secret radio operator behind enemy lines like in novels and films, his blood boiled with anticipation. Expressing this excitement, he'd even compiled a cipher set before departure. When solemnly presenting the codebook to Shao Zong, the latter laughed ruefully:

"Who's this cipher for? This timespace—besides us—who has radios?"

"Well—" Zhang Yuchen scratched his head. "It'll be useful someday."

This cipher set indeed proved useful later.

15:50 hours. In the empty radio room, Zhang Yuchen rubbed his hands like someone warming by a fire on a cold night—half nervousness, half meticulous preparation.

The forward station's scheduled contact with Bairren Fortress base station: 16:00. Per Intelligence regulations, stations contacted daily to confirm safety. Three consecutive missed contacts would trigger rescue team dispatch. Today was his first transmission.

He set up the transmitter; connected power. Power came from lead-acid battery banks, with hand-crank generator for charging. Antenna was strung on a courtyard tree.

The message lay before him—four-digit groups, plaintext. Besides confirming safe arrival, it contained Xiao Zishan's work report—clearly he'd never written telegrams. Rambling prose made the message very long. Fortunately, without radio-detection vehicles, safety wasn't an issue.

Now: 16:00. He nodded to Guo Yi and Xiao Zishan inside—donned headphones. Quickly tuning dials—he immediately heard loud, clear base station calling: "GDA... GDA... GDA..." Calls traversed space repeatedly—filling him with confidence. Barring surprises, this was Li Chiqi's cousin Zhang Yu—the 19-year-old girl tricked here by her scheming cousin saying "let's go somewhere fun." After fainting from blood exposure during nurse training (plus vomiting), she was conned by Shao Zong into becoming a radio operator.

Hearing those calls also meant the safety tether to Bairren Fortress. He adjusted frequency for strongest signal. Fortunately, this timespace had no other radio waves—the sky was silent.

He began transmitting—Guangzhou station's call sign: "GDA" several times—then leaned back, listening.

"BRL... BRL... BRL"—Bairren base station responding. Signal was loud and clear against clean background.

Base station was ready to receive. Zhang Yuchen glanced at the clock—pressed the key. Seconds later, he forgot himself—mind and body concentrated on nimble fingers, on the key's staccato long-and-short clicks.

His state seemed extraordinarily good—faster than any practice session. 16:22: after the final code group, he transmitted "GDA" signifying message end. He leaned back, listening for base station acknowledgment. At Bairren Fortress's "Lingao Telecom" building, novice Zhang Yu was probably decoding group by group—confirming no missed or erroneous codes. Errors would require retransmission.

About fifteen minutes later, "BRL"—reception success—sounded. The transmigrators' first long-distance telegram transmission was complete.

"Right now, Ding Ding's probably dragging his Western mare for live coverage of this historic moment." Xiao Zishan laughed. "'Dear viewers and listeners, perhaps you've just switched on the elevator—'"

"Western mare—I want one too." Zhang Yuchen's otaku nature emerged.

"When are we going to Macau? Try some foreign flavor!" Several were getting restless.

"Forget it—women who don't bathe for ten years—even if she's Audrey Hepburn's ancestor, I'm not interested."

"Little Guo, Salina seems pretty nice. Heard she's interested in you?" Xiao Zishan started gossiping.

Guo Yi suddenly blushed: "No such thing! We rarely interact." This was true—during Security Group work, Salina had shown interest. But fearing misunderstandings, he'd maintained strict distance.

"Why so shy? Getting a Western mare girlfriend isn't bad. Spreading China's divine might, sowing seeds across four seas—" Xiao Zishan chuckled. Others chimed in. While talking, the radio suddenly started clicking. Zhang Yuchen quickly donned headphones—listening carefully—began transcribing.

"What message?" Everyone tensed. No earlier reply—now sudden transmission. Some important directive?

"Agricultural Department to Guangzhou Forward Station—" Zhang Yuchen transcribed while decoding: "Please procure in Guangzhou:

Live pigs: 100 head

Live chickens, ducks, geese: 100 each

Lard, tallow, or miscellaneous vegetable oils: 2,000 kg

Horses: 10

Donkeys: 10

..."

"Heavens—Wu Nanhai thinks this is a farmers' market!" Lu Rong exclaimed. "Donkeys? I've never seen donkeys in Guangdong!"

"Horses aren't easy either." Zhang Xin said. "Maybe easier up north. In Guangzhou—probably only from military."

Most puzzling: 2,000 kg oil. What for? Before departure, cafeteria food—though slightly improved—was famously oil-lacking. Fried foods never appeared. Stir-fries were rare. Only big-pot soups had stingy drops of lard. Was Wu Nanhai rushing to improve meals with fried foods?

"I'm guessing the oil isn't his request—probably for soap?"

"Soap!" Zhang Xin's eyes lit up. "That's a transmigration money-making weapon! Every household needs soap."

"Can make different grades: various scented soaps and transparent soaps for the wealthy. Maybe add some aphrodisiac effects for brothels—"

"What counts as aphrodisiac?" Yan Maoda asked.

"Myrrh or something? Anyway, Arabs do this stuff."

"What's myrrh? Arabian Peninsula is far away."

"Don't worry—what doesn't Guangzhou have?" Guo Yi was confident. "We haven't fully mapped local supplies yet."

Yan Maoda said: "First establish what Guangzhou can supply—then what we can sell to Guangzhou."

Trade goods had been discussed in various meetings. Per Industrial Department reports, near-term products included: salt, cigarettes, glassware, refined sugar, matches, soap, and iron products (mainly sewing needles). Someone proposed liquor—but Ming-era distilled spirits were already widespread—couldn't generate premium profits.

"About liquor—I have an idea. But it needs Agricultural and Industrial cooperation." Zhang Hongda said.

Xiao Zishan: "I'll coordinate with them back at base."

"We've lost first mover on baijiu—but packaging can open markets."

Zhang Xin already understood: "New bottles, old wine?!"

Yan Maoda nodded: "Exactly. We needn't even brew ourselves—brewing requires grain. Bulk purchase baijiu in Guangzhou; ship glass bottles from Lingao; bottle locally. Value instantly multiplies."

"Excellent!" Xiao Zishan was energized.

"Thinking further—many possibilities. Like dyeing baijiu golden—like XO?" Guo Yi spoke up.

Everyone stared at him. Guo Yi felt his scalp tingling: "What?"

Yan Maoda chuckled: "Sometimes outsiders make craftier swindlers."
