# Chapter 991 - Champa

Finally, Ping Qiusheng didn't forget to take several close-up shots of Cam Ranh Bay with his 500D camera.

"Too bad I don't have a wide-angle lens—I'll have to stitch them together when I get back." Ping Qiusheng caught his breath. Meanwhile, he secretly photographed several swimsuit shots of Zhao Xue from the long-range survey team—she had worn a swimsuit to make moving around on the small boat easier.

Zhao Xue wasn't particularly beautiful, and her one-piece pullover swimsuit was completely lacking in sex appeal. But she was one of the few modern women among the Elders, tall and slender, very much fitting the Elders' aesthetic standards. For Elders who faced petite slave girls daily, she was practically a peerless beauty.

Looking through his telephoto lens at Zhao Xue's two sturdy, wheat-colored thighs as she leaned over the gunwale measuring water depth and temperature, Ping Qiusheng couldn't help experiencing certain physiological changes and couldn't help but sigh slightly. Zhao Xue had already been won over by Bai Guoshi's proximity. Still, he didn't feel too much regret—after all, marriages between Elders had many restrictions and taboos. Wouldn't it be quite despairing to end up like Liu San with an unpleasant conclusion?

About 50 kilometers west of Cam Ranh Bay was one of East Asia's larger bauxite ore zones. The survey team had some hope that smaller-scale bauxite deposits might exist along Cam Ranh Bay's coast. Aluminum was a very useful light metal—not only was it extremely useful industrially, but the Finance Department was also hoping to use aluminum to manufacture subsidiary coins. Though Lingao's electrical capacity still had a long way to go before supporting industrial aluminum smelting.

But the survey team obviously hadn't discovered any resources worth mentioning, which was why Zhao Xue had been active along Cam Ranh Bay's beach in her swimsuit these past few days, causing Elder Ping's adrenaline to surge considerably.

Ping Qiusheng's personal slave girl was only average-looking. After solving the basic problem of "having one," she had gradually ceased to arouse much interest in him. This time, he simply hadn't brought her on the ship. Though he dreamed daily of the Japan Governor position, he also knew that women of this era's Japan were nothing to write home about—no matter how noble their origins, it would be meaningless.

On the ship, he often discussed the slave issue with Quark—of course, Elder Ping wasn't interested in Quark's merchandise. The Malay racial type didn't fit his aesthetic. He was more interested in Quark's accounts of the slave market in Basra: female slaves of all skin colors and all nationalities gathered there, waiting to be sold. Every time he heard this, his blood would race and he'd toss and turn sleeplessly at night.

This clueless Quark should immediately go get a batch for the Senate! Though Ping Qiusheng had hinted several times that these female slaves would have a great market in Lingao, unexpectedly Quark remained completely oblivious, always digressing to comparisons of Southeast Asian slaves versus African slaves.

After resting at Nha Trang for two days, the fleet set off for the next stop. By now Quark's fleet should have been safe, but with his keen sense for business opportunities, he decided to temporarily follow the Australian fleet to Siam—perhaps there would be more chances to make money.

On the ship, Ping Qiusheng organized the materials from these past few days. Though Nha Trang here had already been occupied by the Later Lê's Nguyen, many traces of the Champa kingdom remained. The stone towers everywhere were proof: Champa was deeply influenced by India culturally, with Brahmanism once very popular, and there was also a caste system.

In terms of governing power, Nguyen control here was relatively loose. There were few fortresses and almost no signs of military activity. From local inhabitants, they learned that Nguyen officials and troops only came here to requisition grain and goods, occasionally also conscripting strong men. Beyond that, there wasn't much other activity.

Ping Qiusheng discovered there were also some Chinese immigrant villages here—the Nguyen's controlled territory was limited, their population even smaller, and they still had to handle expenses for large-scale military operations. So they actively recruited Chinese immigrants to develop the new southern lands and pay taxes. As encouragement, the Nguyen also granted the leaders of Chinese immigrant groups various titles and honors.

Obviously, after beginning the Southeast Asia strategy, establishing secure outposts in this region wouldn't be difficult. They didn't need particularly strong fortresses—just a small fortress like Yulin Fort would do. With Nha Trang's geographic advantages, large quantities of rice could be obtained here.

This region widely cultivated so-called Champa rice. Champa rice was drought-resistant with a short growing period—only about 50 days from planting to harvest. It had already been introduced to Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian during the Song dynasties. It was a transmigrator cheat code for pre-Song dynasties. Here as its place of origin, plus sufficient light and heat, yields were obviously higher. This grain shouldn't go to waste benefiting the monkeys for nothing. The sooner they took Nha Trang and Cam Ranh Bay, the sooner they could continuously absorb the grain resources of central-southern Vietnam, especially the Chao Phraya River delta region—Ping Qiusheng thought.

However, in the long run, the resource value here wasn't very great—besides obtaining rice, there weren't any special resources. Perhaps after completing the entire East Asian layout, this place would resume its traditional positioning: an Elder vacation port plus naval base. Of course, before taking Malacca, serving as an entrepôt between Australians and Southeast Asia would also be good.

The fleet sailed past Champa's coastline. This ancient kingdom, which had established fifteen dynasties since rebelling from Han independence and was once renowned as a great power on the Indochinese Peninsula, had now been reduced to a small state clinging to survival. The Later Lê and Nguyen to the north, the Khmer to the west—if not for these two nations' constant internal and external troubles, Champa would long since have been annexed and partitioned.

Along the way, they landed several times, with the Special Reconnaissance team conducting reconnaissance. They found that calling this place a "kingdom" was really quite generous. There were only villages and ragged inhabitants—the grass-hut-like dwellings contained no daily necessities. Not even basic coarse porcelain. They used pottery and wooden utensils; some used large shells. Rich or poor, the only leisure item was betel nut. Almost everyone chewed it.

Within the Special Reconnaissance team's survey range, they discovered nothing that could be called a "city"—only some larger-scale earthen stockades. Heavily guarded, apparently constantly on alert against Nguyen invasion.

Yet at some coastal bays, one could still see ruins of former ports. Some port ruins were quite extensive, obviously having once been prosperous cities.

As a country that had once been an important transit point on the maritime Silk Road, with flourishing commerce, to have fallen to such a state was truly astonishing to Ping Qiusheng.

In Ping Qiusheng's view, the Champa kingdom's situation was a case of bringing trouble upon themselves. Originally, the Nguyen's relationship with Champa was peaceful coexistence, even hoping to win Champa over through marriage alliances. After all, maintaining military pressure on two fronts, north and south, wasn't a good situation for the Nguyen. But at this point, the Champa kingdom became hot-headed—perhaps encouraged by Burma fighting against the Portuguese, perhaps for religious reasons. While barely able to fend for itself, it actually sent troops to aid the Johor Sultanate in attacking Malacca. The Nguyen at this time had an alliance with the Portuguese, needing to rely on Portuguese warships to counter the Trinh—without Portuguese naval support, the south would have difficulty resisting the Trinh. So they turned to attack Champa, both eliminating the threat and expanding territory.

It seemed the situation in Champa had great potential. Ping Qiusheng realized that with the interwoven complex relationships among the Trinh, Nguyen, and Champa, even with just a little resources, one could intervene and reap enormous benefits.

After two more days of sailing, the course had turned southwest. On the morning of the third day, with the sky just barely light, a large trumpet-shaped strait entrance appeared before the fleet. Scattered along this alluvial delta estuary were islands of all sizes. This was the seaward outlet of what would be Ho Chi Minh City—Saigon—in the original timeline.

But this place was currently within Cambodia's sphere of influence. Though it was popularly called Saigon, the Khmer who controlled this place called it Prey Nokor, meaning "king's forest." It was the domain of the Cambodian kingdom's viceroy, located roughly in what is now District 5 of Ho Chi Minh City.

With the North-South war, large numbers of Vietnamese and Champa refugees had come here to seek refuge and settle. Combined with the originally large numbers of Chinese already settled here for business, the place appeared reasonably prosperous on the surface. But the Cambodian kingdom itself was also in precarious straits, with pressure from Siam to the west.

Not long ago, after the suspicious "death in battle" of Yamada Nagamasa, the Japanese official-merchant in Siam, conspiracy theories had spread throughout this area. Suspecting the Siamese rulers were about to move against the Japanese, large numbers of Japanese immigrants who had previously been doing business and working in Siam had also entered Cambodia as refugees. Many had fled to Saigon. This place was practically a Southeast Asian refugee camp.

The—relatively large compared to the Dutch and Portuguese fleets here—fleet arrived: Quark's two ships plus the Southeast Asia Company's two ships already counted as quite substantial. The fleet's appearance gave local residents another opportunity to gawk at foreign curiosities. Ships flying the Southeast Asia Company's flag had never come here before.

The Khmer had no naval forces here. Saigon was essentially a free port. The port's hydrographic conditions were good, and many foreign merchant ships would stop here for trade and resupply. But now it was summer with typhoon threats, so only a few Chinese merchant ships sailing along the coast were in port. Not a single European ship.

The fleet anchored at a sandbar in the middle of the estuary and made camp there. After completing necessary formalities, guides familiar with the area led them toward Prey Nokor city. Those going to the city included Ping Qiusheng, Quark, and others, along with a squad of marines escorting gifts for the local ruler.

The natural conditions of this port were quite good. According to memories from the original timeline, with minor modifications, accommodating ships of 20,000-ton class wouldn't be much of a problem.

Along the way, before even reaching the city walls, they had already seen many shanties along the route—presumably refugees from the north. Some, seeing the group's rather impressive bearing, probably wanted to approach and beg for food or money. But seeing that everyone in the group had stern expressions and carried unknown firearms on their backs, they dared not approach.

Ping Qiusheng saw that these people, though ragged, still had decent complexions—apparently still able to get some food. They wouldn't need to flee elsewhere to beg. The Mekong Delta's fertility was truly exceptional. It was just a pity this bunch was wasting it.
