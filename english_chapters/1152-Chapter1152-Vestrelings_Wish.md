# Chapter 1152 - Vestreling's Wish

The taverns on Commercial Street were run by the cooperative, but the street itself was open to all. Under the slogan "Open the doors and find business opportunities," Commercial Street had always been one of the Colonization and Trade Ministry's most valued projects. During the day the gates stood open: fishermen, merchants, sailors, natives—anyone could come to Commercial Street to shop and spend money. It was a place with a complex flow of people.

Xu Ke immediately ordered the Service Company commander to be summoned, instructing him to first conduct a detailed investigation of Zhang Qianniu's interpersonal relationships—to find out if he'd behaved unusually recently, what he'd said, where he frequently went, and with which locals he'd had close contact. Xu Ke himself took several people to Commercial Street.

There weren't many drinking establishments on Commercial Street—just two small taverns, three or four food stalls, and a store run by the cooperative. Xu Ke had no trouble learning that Zhang Qianniu had been drinking at one of the small taverns that afternoon. He'd changed drinking companions several times during his visit.

This small tavern was privately owned. The proprietor had migrated from Beigang and rented a shopfront from the Kaohsiung city government to open his tavern, also selling food. The alcohol was rum and fruit wine bought wholesale from the local cooperative store, then watered down for customers. The prices were naturally cheap—about one-third of those at the cooperative's tavern.

Besides being cheap, this little tavern had another attractive specialty: oyster omelettes. The owner set up a stove in front of the shop and made them fresh daily. Business was booming, attracting a large customer base. Whenever Dutch ships came to port, sailors from Southeast Asia and Europe would come to eat this dish.

With cheap liquor and delicious food, the tavern had heavy traffic. Xu Ke saw the bustling scene—tables spilling out onto the street—and knew this investigation wouldn't be simple.

He and his men showed their credentials and quickly confirmed with the staff that Zhang Qianniu had indeed been there: he was a regular. According to the staff's recollections, this sailor liked to drink with people—anyone and everyone, whether Hokkien immigrants, Taiwanese natives, or foreign sailors.

As for who his drinking companions were, the staff couldn't remember clearly. People came and went on Commercial Street, with ships arriving and departing every day. Aside from the few regulars, they couldn't possibly recognize everyone.

Xu Ke felt some disappointment. He knew the case had now reached the most laborious and tedious "screening" phase. Simply put: identify everyone connected to Zhang Qianniu and investigate each person's background and activities on the day of the incident.

Commercial Street was particularly lively in the evening twilight. Sailors of various skin tones, Army and Navy soldiers, merchants from Beigang and the mainland, fishermen, native tribespeople, Japanese village prostitutes... all moved through the streets and alleys.

Vestreling and Father De Mordt were strolling the harbor streets alongside Cretia and Zhong Xiaoying. Though Commercial Street couldn't be called prosperous, it had far more commercial atmosphere than Fort Zeelandia. Zhong Xiaoying took Cretia to browse the Kaohsiung Branch of the Women's Cooperative—a store that women liked.

The Kaohsiung Branch was personally managed by Li Mei and was designed to attract small traders from the Fujian coast to trade in Kaohsiung. The branch also handled import and export trade with the Dutch, so it was quite substantial: a two-story building with projecting eaves, large glass display windows, various "Australian goods" in dazzling array, and middle-aged female shop assistants in blue cloth Han-style dresses calling out in various accents to attract customers. Naturally, there were also a few Korean security soldiers with batons and caps—foreign sailors and local natives often caused trouble after drinking here.

Zhong Xiaoying took Cretia to the cooperative to select some fabric as a gift—in about a week the Bancuijt siblings would be returning to Tayouan.

Cretia didn't choose silk—she could buy that in Tayouan just as well. Instead, she selected high-count cotton-linen blend fabric shipped from Lingao. This high-grade fabric, woven by the Lingao Textile Factory, had originally been reserved only for the Elders and some naturalized citizens. Now it was beginning to be supplied to the market in small quantities. The fabric was crisp yet breathable and sweat-absorbent, making it very popular.

The knitted cotton-linen socks produced by the garment factory also piqued her great interest. In truth, she wanted to buy many things in this shop, but Bancuijt worked for a company notorious for its stinginess with employees. Though he held a high position, his income wasn't high—of course, he used his authority to smuggle a little contraband and make some small profits, but that wasn't something one could openly discuss. As his daughter, she had very little money at her disposal. She had to pick up an item, look at the price, calculate for a long while, then reluctantly put it down. This process repeated itself over and over. Zhong Xiaoying enthusiastically helped offer advice, and by the time the two women had worked their way from the first floor to the second floor, an hour had passed.

Vestreling had been quite interested at first, but as time wore on, his interest waned. Father De Mordt, to avoid "worldly temptations," never browsed in shops, so the two men sat idly in the first-floor seating area along the street. The seating area was right next to the large glass display window, offering a clear view of the street scene. It was furnished with rattan tables and chairs and a few potted green plants. Besides providing a place to rest, it sold cold drinks and tea. But ordinary people rarely patronized it, leaving it empty.

Father De Mordt was something of a notable figure in Kaohsiung—especially since he had painted several decorative oil paintings for the cooperative. To maintain "spiritual purity," he refused payment. Consequently, the cooperative had placed him on its VIP list, and as soon as he sat down, a server brought two glasses of iced tea.

Whether iced tea constituted a "temptation of the flesh," Father De Mordt had once struggled internally. But other priests had no qualms about it, and he couldn't find any relevant papal encyclical on the matter—black tea was a product unique to Lingao in the contemporary world, so the Pope could hardly have issued an opinion on it.

Whether in Lingao or Kaohsiung, sitting down to drink a chilled, slightly sweet beverage with a lingering bitter aftertaste was indeed refreshing.

As the two drank their cool, slightly sweet iced tea, Vestreling began excitedly talking about his experiences these past days installing the great clock with Dr. Zhong. The various instruments and components of the clock had given him endless food for thought.

"It's truly incredible!" Vestreling said between large gulps of tea, talking at length about his impressions. The priest maintained a modest smile, listening attentively. Only when Vestreling paused did he gently advise the young man not to be dazzled by all manner of novelties, but to serve the Lord sincerely with his whole heart, and so on.

As he was delivering this religious sermon, Zhong Xiaoying and Cretia arrived, flushed and sweating, carrying several large and small grass bags. Zhong Xiaoying ordered more iced tea. With the women present, conversation became even livelier. Cretia excitedly displayed the various "Australian goods" she had purchased.

Vestreling, however, had little interest in these goods. During his days at the clock tower site, his admiration for Australian science had only deepened—he felt he'd discovered an entirely new world. A few days ago, while chatting with Mr. Huygens, he'd realized that Huygens shared this view. Huygens had even written several poems to express his impressions.

"Sister, speaking of which, I'm a bit reluctant to leave here," Vestreling said. "I really want to stay and continue learning from Dr. Zhong. I hear he'll soon be going on an expedition to the savages' territory..."

When Cretia heard him mention wanting to go to "the savages' territory," she couldn't help but recall how Vestreling had once slipped out of the city alone in Batavia to "explore" the wilderness and nearly been eaten by a crocodile.

She quickly tried gentle persuasion: "Didn't you want to visit Japan for a long time? After we reach Tayouan, we'll soon be going to Japan."

Reminded that they were headed for Japan, Vestreling stopped talking about wanting to stay in Kaohsiung. Instead, he turned to Zhong Xiaoying:

"Miss Zhong, does Lingao have universities?"

"Universities?" Zhong Xiaoying was momentarily stunned. She knew what a university was—Zhong Lishi had told her. Of course there were no universities in Lingao, but she couldn't lose face in front of foreigners. So she said: "Yes! Lingao has several universities."

This boast was rather excessive. Vestreling felt somewhat skeptical, so Zhong Xiaoying had to forge ahead: "My father is a professor at Taibai University. Taibai University specializes in astronomy, timekeeping, and mechanics. There's also Desi University, with law, arts, and shipbuilding programs; and Niaoren Medical University, South Sea Agricultural University..."

A sudden inspiration struck her, and she improvised several university names using the Elders' names, speaking with such conviction that Vestreling began to have doubts. But in the Europe of that era, universities were definitely rare things. Dutch universities were relatively numerous, but for a single city to have one university or "famous school" was already quite impressive—let alone multiple universities in one city. That was simply unheard of.

As Zhong Xiaoying was speaking off the cuff, she suddenly noticed that a priest was sitting nearby. She thought, "Not good—I'm going to be exposed!" This John De Mordt had come from Lingao. So she quickly patched things up by adding: "However, these universities only accept the most loyal and reliable naturalized citizens designated by the Senate. Outsiders generally don't know about them." As she spoke, she shot the poor priest a fierce glare, which successfully stopped the honest Father De Mordt from speaking up.

Vestreling hadn't noticed Zhong Xiaoying's momentary change of expression. When he heard that these universities "only accept the most loyal and reliable naturalized citizens designated by the Senate," his face showed disappointment.

"So they don't accept foreign exchange students?"

Zhong Xiaoying thought: Are you trying to get me killed? These universities don't even exist—where would exchange students come from? But she kept her composure and said: "I wouldn't know about that. The Senate would have to decide in a meeting. But even if you wanted to study, your Chinese is far too weak—they certainly don't teach in German there."

"That's no problem. I can learn," Vestreling immediately declared. "Look how much Chinese I've picked up these past few days. I'm not boasting—my sister and I are quite talented at learning languages."

*Note: The term "famous school" (名校) refers to a type of university in the Netherlands at the time. Because older Dutch universities had monopolized the title "university," later institutions could only call themselves "famous schools." Dutch universities in the 17th century were quite renowned, mainly because they were less subject to religious interference.*
