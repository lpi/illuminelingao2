# Chapter 536 - The Dugu Qiuhun Case

The Law-Studies Club members were jubilant, but Ma Jia had a thorny matter to handle. As head of the judiciary, his first task upon taking office was to face a dilemma: how to resolve the issues of Chang Shide and Dugu Qiuhun.

On the eve of the Assembly's closing, someone had proposed convening a public trial—dragging Chang Shide and Dugu Qiuhun before the Senate for a public struggle session. The proposal was rejected as too violent; besides, after several days of meetings, everyone was a bit weary. Furthermore, the overseas stations had conducted active lobbying before the Assembly, so it was quickly voted down. However, the Assembly passed a motion calling for a hearing by the Honor Court after the session adjourned, to question their conduct. The hearing would be held under the supervision of the Senate Standing Committee.

And this matter fell under Ma Jia's jurisdiction—since it was a court matter, it was more appropriate for the judiciary to handle it.

Ma Jia returned to his Maritime Court office in the Customs Building—he had not yet moved into the Executive Committee compound—and convened a small meeting of his key cadres to summarize the Law-Studies Club's activities in the preceding period. At the Second General Assembly, the Law-Studies Club was the biggest winner. Not only had its leader, Ma Jia, successfully squeezed into the highest ruling circle, but the principle of "rule by law" had been established, locking in the future prospects of every Club member. Though it would have been inappropriate to cheer in the office, everyone wore happy expressions. An Xi could barely contain his glee—he felt he had done the lion's share of the legwork for the Club's total turnaround.

At the meeting, the group took stock of the Club's and the entire transmigrated collective's issues and set the Club's next phase of activities. People trained in law tended to be stronger than average in logical thinking and articulation; there was no wasted talk, and the agenda was dispatched quickly.

Policy was decided: the Law-Studies Club would continue to hold high the banner of "pure scholarship," adhere to "public opinion first" and the principle of "rule of law." They also resolved to use the *Associations Law* passed at this Assembly to strengthen the Club's organizational structure and cohesion.

The meeting's final agenda item was "dividing the candy"—carving up positions in the judicial system. As the representative of the Arbitration Tribunal and the highest leader of the transmigrated collective's judiciary, Ma Jia had decision-making power over the judicial system's structure and personnel. The entire Law-Studies Club had been looking forward to this day for a long time.

Ma Jia was very cautious. He only promised at the meeting that everyone would get a piece of the pie. But before "dividing the candy," he asked everyone first to draft a plan for the judicial system—still essentially a blank slate—including which legal tradition to adopt, trial procedures, and how to structure the system. They had to build the house before deciding who would live in it.

"Everyone go back and discuss for a day or two. Have the proposals ready by Thursday for collective discussion," Ma Jia said. "That way I can submit the plan to the Executive Committee by next Monday and then to the Senate for approval. After that comes the personnel assignments. Everyone, put in the effort!"

"Will do!" they answered with excited expressions, preparing to disperse. Some were already arranging to meet at the Farm coffee house to talk over drinks. Ma Jia held Ji Xin back and pulled him aside.

"The Chang Shide and Dugu Qiuhun cases—I'm handing them to you."

Ji Xin hesitated. "What's the leadership's attitude on this?"

"Ambiguous. The gist from the top is: don't let it blow up," Ma Jia said. "But ordinary Senators and some Executive Committee members probably don't see it that way."

"I understand." Ji Xin nodded. "Leave it to me."

"It's in your hands." Ma Jia chose Ji Xin for several reasons. First, he had good interpersonal relations and was easy to communicate with. Second, he was older, relatively mature and prudent in handling affairs, and considered problems thoroughly—in such a tangled situation, he was more likely to keep his footing. Finally, he was upright and would not calculate too much for his own benefit, avoiding human-made complications. In both the Dugu Qiuhun and Chang Shide cases, plenty of people were looking to profit.

Ma Jia handed Ji Xin two case files. Chang Shide's was thin; Dugu Qiuhun's was much thicker. Ji Xin knew: the thickness of the files told him which case would be harder.

"Chang Shide is currently at Office Administration Guest House No. 1; Dugu Qiuhun is at the Army Club," Ma Jia said. "You can talk to them any time—as long as they're awake, they'll see you." He was hinting that both were under house arrest.

Ji Xin was then given a room in the Customs Building to handle the matter. He returned to his dormitory, grabbed his sleeping bag and personal effects, and brought them to the office.

Ji Xin was well aware that Chang Shide's situation could go either way; exonerating him would not be hard. What mattered most was the leadership's and the cadres' inclination—the attitude toward Chang Shide was "protect." After the Assembly, much of the masses' anger had subsided; employing some procedural techniques to let Chang Shide pass smoothly would not cause much controversy.

The difficulty lay in Dugu Qiuhun. Dugu Qiuhun's mobilization of the police to "suppress a riot" was not a major event in itself, and Ji Xin did not believe certain people's claims that Dugu Qiuhun had "coup intentions." On the contrary, he considered Dugu Qiuhun's loyalty to the transmigrated collective beyond question—it was only that his way of expressing that loyalty had touched transmigrators' deepest fear: that someone might use indigenous forces under their command to threaten fellow transmigrators.

The transmigrators intended to build their own empire; the indigenous population was a force they had to use—they would constitute the main body of the military and the administrative system.

Everyone already worried about how to secure the loyalty of indigenous elites. Now, out of nowhere, appeared the possibility that someone might use indigenous forces directly against comrades for the sake of power. Fortunately, this time the police had been sent back before they fully understood what was happening. Otherwise, the psychological impact on the indigenous population would have been enormous. If the transmigrators—whom the locals had regarded almost as gods—were seen scattering before indigenous truncheons, the transmigrated collective's prestige might well have collapsed.

From this perspective, Dugu Qiuhun's conduct was indeed "extremely egregious in nature." Demanding severe punishment was not unreasonable.

Punishing Dugu Qiuhun severely would not be hard—no one thought he had acted well or rightly; even the mildest view held that he lacked judgment. Removal from office, investigation, a lifetime ban on public service—all were feasible, and no one would cry foul on his behalf. But Ji Xin knew the waters behind this case ran deep.

The "Dugu Qiuhun Incident" was not an isolated event but one link in the entire "Maid Revolution." Ji Xin had not joined that night's march—he disliked such things—but many signs indicated that the Law-Studies Club was not clean in this affair. Ma Jia and Shan Liang launching the march together seemed like coincidence, but was it perhaps inevitable? Shan Liang had merely served as the trigger.

Besides the Law-Studies Club, how many others had been active behind the scenes during this revolution? He propped his chin on his hand and thought; shadowy faces drifted before him. Recalling the Executive Committee members' performance during the Maid Revolution, Ji Xin began to understand.

He broke the wax seal on the case file and studied the materials inside several times over. The file contained Political Security Bureau interrogation records: depositions from every indigenous policeman present that night, the interrogation of Police Reserve Company Commander Li Yayang, reports submitted by Bei Wei and Xue Ziliang, and transcripts of Ran Yao's several conversations with Dugu Qiuhun. Finally, there was a handwritten order from Dugu Qiuhun himself, instructing Li Yayang to assemble the Police Reserve Company and prepare to deploy.

The depositions of the indigenous policemen in particular made Ji Xin draw a sharp breath: multiple officers mentioned that Dugu Qiuhun had ordered them to open the armory and take Minié rifles into the city.

Whatever the intention behind carrying guns, the single act of ordering indigenous personnel to enter the city armed without authorization was enough to destroy Dugu Qiuhun. Ji Xin thought: right now, pinning a "coup attempt" label on Dugu Qiuhun would not be difficult.

Dugu Qiuhun's political future was finished. That was beyond doubt. The question, Ji Xin thought, was what Ma Jia had said: "The gist is: don't let it blow up," yet "ordinary Senators and some Executive Committee members probably don't see it that way."

Taken together, this meant that both in and out of power circles, an undercurrent wanted to make an issue of Dugu Qiuhun's attempt to enter Bairen Fortress. Meanwhile, most of the leadership hoped the matter would simply end here.

He decided to go talk to Dugu Qiuhun first.

The day after Dugu Qiuhun's police were intercepted by Bei Wei and Xue Ziliang and returned to the precinct, Ran Yao arrived at the station with Mu Min and several others. After a five-minute closed-door conversation, a white-faced Dugu Qiuhun was taken away. His pistol was confiscated. Mu Min was then announced as temporarily in charge of the East Gate Market Precinct; a batch of new trainee officers was transferred in from the Military-Political Academy. All the original East Gate Market Precinct policemen were taken to a Political Security Bureau "study camp"—Political Security personnel interviewed each one to establish exactly what had happened that night and what Dugu Qiuhun had said to the indigenous officers.

Li Yayang was also taken away that day; he was held for questioning at the Police Reserve Company headquarters for twelve hours before being released.

Dugu Qiuhun was in a room at the Army Club and looked to be in reasonable spirits. Since being brought here, he had been under house arrest. He had not attended the General Assembly, but the meeting minutes were delivered to his room daily, and he did vote—his political rights had not yet been revoked.

Seeing Ji Xin come to visit, Dugu Qiuhun still looked unconcerned:

"Are you a defense lawyer?" He waved dismissively. "I'm not guilty. I don't need anyone defending me!"

Ji Xin smiled faintly. "I'm not a lawyer. I'm a judge."

Dugu Qiuhun looked at him in confusion. Ji Xin briefly introduced himself and informed him of the resolution the Assembly had passed.
