# Chapter 355 - The Foshan Journey (Part 4)

He politely declined Shucui's offer to find him another companion, instead sending a note out—apparently he had a regular rendezvous elsewhere. Liu San seized the initiative and led Shucui away. With Huang Tianyu's friendly donation of a condom plus the alcohol swabs in his bag, his courage had suddenly swelled.

"Xiao Huang, you treat this... young lady... with care—" Liu San was slightly tipsy. He led Shucui to his room and closed the door behind them.

Huang Tianyu groaned inwardly. Liu San, oh Liu San, you Chinese medicine man really know how to pick them. You've dumped a *loli* in my lap. Though he called himself a lolicon, he really didn't have the nerve to openly violate one.

While he sat there conflicted, Qianqian had already poured a cup of wine. She even untied a pink handkerchief from her lapel, wiped the rim of the cup, and presented it to him with both hands.

Though she was a woman of the pleasure quarters, her manner was gentle and refined. Huang Tianyu felt increasingly well-disposed toward her. He took her hand and asked, "How old are you?"

Qianqian smiled somewhat bashfully. "Why do you ask that?"

He'd assumed she wouldn't understand his choppy Cantonese Mandarin, but the girl spoke a dialect similar to modern Nanjing Mandarin. Being able to communicate lifted Huang Tianyu's spirits.

"What, is it taboo?"

"No taboo." Qianqian answered, "Your servant is fifteen years old."

Fifteen—did that count as a minor or a young woman? This was truly a difficult question. He recalled Yu Eshui mentioning that in ancient times, girls over thirteen were considered adults and could marry freely. At fifteen, she'd probably already have a child or two by now. But then again, in modern times Qianqian would still be in eighth grade... Combined with her slender waist, flat chest, and pitifully large eyes, Huang Tianyu really couldn't bring himself to make a move.

Still, turning away meat that presented itself at his door seemed a terrible waste. An intense internal struggle waged within Huang Tianyu.

Sounds were already coming from the adjacent room—the faint panting and moaning of a woman, occasionally punctuated by Liu San's robust baritone shouts.

While he hesitated, Qianqian had poured wine and was offering it to him on a handkerchief.

"I've had enough, more than enough." Huang Tianyu smiled and declined. His head was already feeling rather fuzzy.

"Hmph, just drink it." The girl suddenly assumed a "drink or else" attitude, her willow brows upturned, her almond eyes round.

Thin-skinned, Huang Tianyu downed another cup. As they say, wine emboldens a man, especially his lust. Though the young woman before him seemed like an undeveloped child, he couldn't help reaching out his wandering hands. But as he did, his whole body went limp. He couldn't control his limbs. A thought suddenly flashed through his mind: "Not good!" The various underworld tricks Yu Eshui had taught them in his social customs class flooded his memory...

Qianqian watched Huang Tianyu collapse on the floor like a dead pig, his eyes still staring at her. She gave a satisfied "humph," tossed her head back, and planted her foot on a stool.

"Clever as a fox, but you still drank this old lady's footwash!"

Though she called herself "this old lady," her expression was still quite childish. Looking at the completely immobile Huang Tianyu, a mischievous look crossed her face.

"Well then, let this old lady see what fun stuff you've got, uncle." She tucked her skirt hem into her waistband and began rummaging through Huang Tianyu's bundle. Hands and feet numb, body paralyzed—Huang Tianyu could only groan inwardly: I didn't even get any action, and now I've run into a female robber! At least he hadn't brought any modern items on this trip, let alone weapons. Otherwise the loss would be huge.

"Hm? What's this?" Qianqian fished out a glass bottle from the bundle. Huang Tianyu recognized it—his chili sauce, Lao Gan Ma brand. His last bottle, brought along to spice up the unfamiliar local cuisine. The little girl gripped the bottle in her five-clawed grip, turning it this way and that, studying it for quite a while, then tapping it against the headboard—Huang Tianyu's heart leaped in panic. He wasn't worried she'd discover anything from the bottle; the label had been removed before D-Day per Executive Committee directives. He was worried she'd break it—if it broke, it was gone forever!

Finally, Qianqian managed to open the lid. Apparently unfamiliar with screw-top caps, she studied it curiously. Seeing the bottle full of reddish plant matter mixed with oil, giving off a distinctive aroma, she couldn't resist sticking out her tongue and licking the oily surface. Immediately she wrinkled her nose, sputtering repeatedly—chili peppers had only recently been introduced to the Ming and were rarely consumed, so she apparently wasn't used to the spicy taste.

"Could you at least dip a finger in it? Who licks it directly—how am I supposed to eat that now—" Huang Tianyu cursed silently.

Finding the chili sauce unpalatable, Qianqian casually set the bottle aside and pulled out Huang Tianyu's underwear, undershirt, and socks. She even examined these curiously before keeping one of his new undershirts and several nylon socks, tossing the rest aside. The bundle also contained some silver pieces and copper coins—his expense allowance—which the girl unhesitatingly stuffed into her bosom.

Finally, she produced a bottle of tomato sauce, brought for spreading on steamed buns. Learning from her experience with the chili sauce, Qianqian quickly opened it and gave it a lick.

A strange expression crossed her face. She smacked her lips, apparently savoring the sweet-sour taste. Suddenly her face lit up with joy. She wrapped up the bottle, apparently intending to claim this too.

Huang Tianyu cursed his luck—this little thief wanted everything, even his undershirt! He'd heard of men having a thing for women's used undergarments, but never heard of women being into that.

In the end, even Huang Tianyu's *Holyship* brand notebook and pencils were swept away. Using the bedsheet from his bed as a bundle cloth, she made a messy package. As soon as she swung it onto her back though, it fell apart, scattering everything on the floor.

"Curses!" Qianqian stamped her foot, her face showing frustration. She quickly crouched down to gather her loot. Suddenly, from outside came a call: "Shopkeeper Huang! Shopkeeper Huang!"

Huang Tianyu was overjoyed—someone had finally come! But his body was limp, his tongue felt like it had lost its tendons, and he couldn't make a sound. He could only try desperately to rock his body, hoping to knock over the chair and make noise to alert someone that something was amiss.

"Don't move!" Qianqian crouched down, a small dagger suddenly appearing in her hand, its cold blade pointed at his throat. Huang Tianyu broke out in a cold sweat and froze.

"Shopkeeper Huang is sleeping. Is there something you need?" Qianqian called out.

"The kitchen is here to clear the dinner things..."

"No need to clear them. Come back tomorrow."

"Yes." The voice outside gradually faded. Qianqian let out a breath of relief, put away the dagger, and said, "Sorry about this, Shopkeeper Huang. It's not that I meant to rob you—I'm just stranded out here with no choice. Please forgive me. As for Sister Shucui, I tricked her—you mustn't report her to the authorities! Otherwise, you'll regret it!" She shook her fist at him threateningly.

Huang Tianyu could only resign himself to his bad luck. Fortunately the loss wasn't great. Whether Qianqian was some divine being or not, the sooner she left, the better.

Qianqian blew out the candle, then crouched by Huang Tianyu and waited for a while. A peculiar delicate fragrance drifted past his nose, making him inappropriately restless—was this the legendary virgin's scent? Or some natural chemical compound the weirdos on the forums talked about? Just as his thoughts wandered, Qianqian apparently decided it was quiet enough outside. She rose and slipped out the door.

That pest was finally gone. But the more Huang Tianyu thought about it, the more aggrieved he felt. Liu San was probably still in the thick of a three-hundred-round battle with Shucui. That guy even had a wife, while he didn't even have a girlfriend, and his "live-in secretary" arrangement still hadn't materialized. Normally he lived in a group dormitory with electricity restrictions—he didn't even have a decent environment for masturbation. Finally he got a business trip opportunity for some indulgence, and this happens. Why was his fate so bitter? Just as he was wallowing in self-pity, a sudden commotion arose outside—sounds of running, fighting, then a woman's scream. Lights came on.

While he was still puzzled, his room door burst open. Chen Tong rushed in, calling, "Shopkeeper Huang! Shopkeeper Huang!" He scanned the room and, finding Huang Tianyu collapsed under the table, quickly dragged him out. Seeing his limbs weak and speechless, Chen Tong hurried to lay him on the bed.

Meanwhile the door had opened wide, admitting a crowd. Liu San pushed Shucui in—her hair still disheveled, wearing only an outer garment, barefoot, apparently pulled straight from bed. Her hands were bound behind her back, her face full of terror. After a moment, Qianqian was also pushed in by several inn attendants, her hair bun undone, a rope loop around her neck. The large bundle of stolen goods was also brought in.

As soon as Shucui entered, she dropped to her knees, kowtowing and begging for mercy repeatedly. She insisted she wasn't in league with Qianqian—Qianqian had approached her asking to partner for business, and she'd only agreed out of pity for the poor girl. She begged Master Liu to spare her and not hand her over to the authorities—"Shucui is willing to serve the gentleman with all her heart, free of charge."

Liu San thought: you still want to settle your debts with your body? Too bad I don't have enough condoms to enjoy your services.

The inn manager and attendants also spoke up for her, saying Shucui had been registered here singing for two or three years without incident. This was just a momentary lapse in judgment; they begged the gentleman to be lenient.

Liu San knew this had little to do with her—Shucui had merely been used by Qianqian. So he said, "Write me a written confession first!"

Shucui agreed readily. Since she couldn't write, an attendant drafted the statement for her, and she pressed her thumbprint to it.

Liu San first went to check Huang Tianyu, lifting his eyelids, prying open his mouth to sniff his breath, and testing his knee-jerk reflex.
