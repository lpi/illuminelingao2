# Chapter 1808 - Educating the Next Generation

Liu Xiang returned to his office, feeling rather exhausted. Zhang Yunmi brought him a cup of coffee, which he downed in one gulp.

Guangzhou was truly a complex multi-threaded simulation game—the kind that demanded all your CPU power, constantly making the computer stutter. But unlike a game, you couldn't save and reload when things went wrong. Every decision might lead the entire city toward ruin.

Every day, a mountain of official documents awaited him—though most needed only his review rather than his signature. The signature authority was shared among several Elders. Liu Xiang couldn't possibly decide everything personally.

Zhang Yunmi set a stack of documents requiring his processing before him. These were all matters that could only be resolved with his signature—or at least his comments. He picked up the topmost document and began reading.

"The Xinning County magistrate actually sent me a document written entirely in classical Chinese!" Liu Xiang was both exasperated and amused. "Does anyone still know how to read this? Here, take a look."

Zhang Yunmi accepted the document and scanned through quickly: "Xinning County respectfully memorializes: Your humble servant has received benevolent guidance, deeply grateful for sagely favor..."

"You actually understand this?"

Zhang Yunmi's face reddened slightly: "I attended a private academy for a few years as a child, so I picked up some classical learning. But I'm just barely literate—I can't actually compose anything myself."

"I see how it is—a hidden talent!" Liu Xiang teased. "I was wondering how you seemed to understand so much more than most naturalized cadres—so you had a foundation already."

"My lord flatters me." Zhang Yunmi lowered her head, not daring to say more. Studying the old learning was nothing to boast about in the Council of Elders—in fact, it could even be a liability.

"Don't be nervous. Tell me, what does this Xinning County magistrate want? Reading those memorial-style characters gives me a headache."

The memorial was quite lengthy, but Zhang Yunmi quickly summarized the key points:

In the fourth year of Chongzhen, the magistrate of Xinning County—which later became Taishan—was named Chen Zhongxiao. After being notified by the Council of Elders, he still hadn't formally surrendered. The land route between Guangzhou and Xinning passed through areas yet to be pacified, but Xinning bordered the coast where the Council of Elders was active, and the Council often sent ships there on various errands. So this memorial had been forwarded through the coastal patrol stations.

Its content was essentially a request for instructions: at the beginning of the year, the magistrate had received notice from the Bopo Army through the coastal patrol station, informing him that the Great Ming in Guangzhou had fallen and that he should remain in office pending disposition. Now half a year had passed. The magistrate wished to know what the Council of Elders intended to do with him, and whether his current salary and rations were according to Ming or Song scales.

Liu Xiang said: "This memorial has been forwarded through several hands to reach my desk. What's the matter—am I supposed to decide the fate of a county magistrate?"

Zhang Yunmi said: "Perhaps the magistrate doesn't know who to address it to."

"That's probably right." Liu Xiang found this situation laughable yet troublesome. "Send Zhang Yi a note—tell him to have someone go take a look at Xinning County. If this magistrate Chen is reasonably capable, keep him on. If not, we'll discuss replacement."

Zhang Yunmi acknowledged this, but showed some hesitation.

"Is there something else?"

"My lord, your humble servant has a request—"

"Speak."

"This servant wishes to do some practical work." Zhang Yunmi had evidently rehearsed this speech. Despite using the title of "Deputy Director of the General Office," correspondence with Lin Ziqi from Lingao had revealed that public opinion there still said she was doing "secretary" work. Lin Ziqi had teased her about it considerably.

"Oh?" Liu Xiang's engineering-oriented mind immediately fell into the logical trap: "The General Office Director's work is already quite practical—it provides deep and broad exposure to the governmental operations of Guangzhou Prefecture. Why would you call it impractical work?"

"Well, I hear that Lu Cheng is handling some interesting work recently. I thought perhaps I could, how to put it—go down to the grassroots level?"

Liu Xiang was startled by this—young lady, do you realize that right now Lu Cheng is working on "rescuing fallen women"? Some of those reproductive system diseases aren't necessarily transmitted only through direct contact! If you join that work, a certain German won't come knocking with a gun? Little miss, are you here specifically to get me in trouble?

He quickly deployed a barrage of technical terminology from biology to explain to Zhang Yunmi the risks of going "down" to this particular "grassroots level." This made Zhang Yunmi blush deeply, and she privately harbored strong suspicions that this strange uncle was using the opportunity to verbally harass her...

After thorough discussion, Liu Xiang finally understood that Zhang Yunmi simply didn't want to continue work that was nominally "Deputy Director of General Office" but essentially "Chief Secretary to Mayor Liu." He couldn't help scratching his head.

His worry wasn't Zhang Yunmi's new request, but rather: if Zhang Yunmi gave up her duties—under the current system, Elders truly could be this willful—then who would handle the current confidential work?

Previously in Qiongshan, confidential work had been handled by Guo Linger. This was also standard practice among Elders—what could be more reliable than a pillow-companion? Even if this wasn't universally true, biologically speaking Elders still habitually entrusted sensitive matters to their life secretaries. Now Liu Xiang's life secretary had changed. Guo Xier was first of all not an experienced hand, and second, she was the type who "couldn't absorb learning"—when he gave her correspondence to read and summarize, she'd fall asleep before finishing a single page. Third, Guo Xier had a somewhat "loose tongue"—perhaps due to youth and inexperience, her speech easily revealed extensive secondary information. For instance, on the first night Guo Linger had sent her to bed with him, during his post-coital refractory period Liu Xiang had asked a casual question or two and she immediately let slip, revealing all Guo Linger's previous advice about "you're too young, childbirth isn't suitable for you" and similar "caring" admonitions. Another example: she was allergic to celery. When getting food in the cafeteria, most people would simply tell the server "no celery please," but she insisted on saying "I can't eat celery"—not realizing this revealed additional personal information. Worse, if the server followed up with "why," she would honestly answer "I'm allergic, I can't eat it"... Observing her from Lingao to Guangzhou, Liu Xiang had long since excluded Guo Xier from his working hours. Otherwise he wouldn't have endured pressure to accept little Zhang as secretary-general—there simply weren't more "trustworthy" candidates.

Guo Xier did turn out to have considerable interest in fashion design. The school's instructional paper patterns she had already mastered in cutting, and she could even sketch some of her own designs—though peculiar combinations like Zhongshan jacket tops with deep-robe skirts left Liu Xiang completely baffled. Still, this didn't stop Liu Xiang from supporting her hobby. While in Hong Kong, he had urgently written to Lingao to purchase an experimental pedal sewing machine, and also written to several Elders with fashion design talent and some Hanfu enthusiasts requesting pattern books, teaching materials, design drawings, and such. These materials had arrived within a week of entering Guangzhou. Now Guo Xier spent every day in Liu Xiang's official residence working on her fashion design and tailoring, happily absorbed in her creative endeavors.

Liu Xiang's thoughts had somehow wandered to Guo Xier, then naturally jumped to those fresh, tentatively-awakened pleasures of youth... Ahem, he quickly pulled himself back. Liu Xiang shifted in his seat, moving closer to the desk, and with an earnest expression tapped his forehead. He mused aloud "Well then..." before pulling a manila document folder from the right-hand drawer and handing it to Zhang Yunmi.

"There is actually one piece of work, but it needs to be submitted to the State Council first. Only after approval can we form a team. Take a look at this first." Liu Xiang thought for a moment, then added: "Also, according to organizational principles, I can currently only assign you to 'primarily oversee' a certain area of work. I can't transfer you to a specific department—if you insist on that, you'll have to go through the Organization Bureau's process."

Zhang Yunmi raised an eyebrow in asymmetric disdain, uncertain whether she was mentally objecting to bureaucratic work styles. She reached out and accepted the folder Liu Xiang offered. The title on the folder read: "Proposal for Establishing Cadre Training Institutions in Guangzhou."

"You know, our current cadre corps is generally stretched thin. Most current mid-level and above cadres are shouldering responsibilities that don't match their actual capabilities. Even with such underqualified cadres, there's still a shortage." Liu Xiang said. "This underqualification manifests both in professional competence and in political ideology. You've probably seen this batch's reports these past few days."

Zhang Yunmi nodded in agreement.

"And now we urgently need to recruit more grassroots civil servants. These all have to be recruited and examined locally. These people are different from the cadres we brought with us—our influence here is limited, the information we spread gets distorted. So those we recruit will inevitably be deeply steeped in old ideas and old concepts."

When they were in Hainan, "major policies" had always been controlled by the Elders. Many specific affairs were even handled personally by Elders. Naturalized cadres, apart from following along due to gratitude, ambition, and other personal factors, didn't have much understanding of "why we do things this way" or "what's the purpose of doing it this way." Specifically, essentially all naturalized cadres lacked awareness of the fundamental question: "What kind of nation are we trying to build?"

Agricultural cadres might know they were supposed to make their assigned area look like the propaganda posters. Factory naturalized cadres might know about production targets and planned directives, might understand some technology. But few of them could explain why they were given such production tasks, why such industrial arrangements were made—they lacked knowledge of the overall Australian Song project, of the entire industrialization effort. This wasn't obvious when Council of Elders forces were confined to Hainan, because Elders directed everything and naturalized cadres only needed to follow the baton. Questions they didn't understand could be answered by readily available Elders—nearly every industry had Elders on the front lines guiding and participating in the work.

But in Guangdong, the extreme shortage of cadres not only required everyone to be multi-skilled. To ensure that Hainan Island—the world's only industrialized zone—could continue stable output and technological development, the vast majority of Elders capable of guiding industrialization and nation-building had to remain on Hainan Island. The newly liberated Guangnan East Circuit, despite having far greater population and territory than Hainan Island, could only muster thirty-odd Elders in scattered groups. Including those working in Hong Kong, they still numbered fewer than forty or fifty.
