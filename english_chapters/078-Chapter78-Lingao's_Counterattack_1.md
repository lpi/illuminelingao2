# Chapter 78 - Lingao's Counterattack (1)

When this new city was being built, no one realized that this huge construction site was not fully fortified. The local people's fleeing at the mere sight after landing and the victories in several small-scale conflicts made the transmigrators smug. The shipload of arms transported by the North American branch also inflated their sense of security to the extreme—thinking that trenches, abatis, barbed wire, SKS, and searchlights could constitute the strongest fortress.

The spies in the county seat peered from a distance every day, carefully not daring to get too close. Those companions who were taken away by pirates riding roaring monsters had given them enough lessons. The bravest people used trees and grass during the day to slowly approach, and could somewhat see what the pirates were busily doing. The city basically understood every move of the pirates, but was just helpless. There were not many people to discuss with, but after all the talk, it was all theoretical stuff. The gentry were not active, so what to fight with? He understood the thoughts of these old moneybags: at worst, in a critical moment, hide in the villages outside the city: avoid small chaos in the city, avoid big chaos in the countryside; this is an old saying tried and tested for thousands of years. As the county magistrate, there was absolutely no reason for him to escape if the city was broken, and he would inevitably have to die with the city—which he was extremely unwilling to do—if not for his strong desire to serve as an official, he wouldn't have gone to great lengths to be selected to be a county magistrate in such a poor and remote place.

The city was not peaceful either. More than two thousand villagers had taken refuge in the county seat. There were simply not enough houses in the city to live in. The farmers from all directions either hid in the city, or those who didn't enter the city dared not transport grain and vegetables into the city, deeply afraid of being robbed by pirates on the way. various foods were scarce. The refugees lived on the alms from the porridge sheds. Malnutrition coupled with sleeping in the wind and dew caused some elderly and children to die due to weakness. There were people crying on the streets every day, making Magistrate Wu restless. He was deeply afraid that once there was any sign of trouble, a civil uprising would be terrible. For this reason, he personally led people to patrol the streets every day to appease the people's hearts.

Just in case, he had already sent trusted family members with strong men to secretly send his family and precious savings to the prefectural city, instructing that once something went wrong, they should be sent across the sea back to their hometown immediately. In this way, he became a thorough "naked official".

Enduring in fear in the city for more than ten days, the pirates still showed no movement of attacking. The spies came back to report that the bandit 'Kun' stopped after repairing the road to Bairen Beach and were currently engaging in large-scale construction there. It seemed they had no intention of attacking the city. Wu Mingjin couldn't figure out what was special about Bairen Beach that was worth their digging here and there—he hadn't heard of any legends of ancient tombs or buried treasures in this place.

"This is really a headache." Wu Mingjin patted his head. In these ten days or so, it seemed his hair had turned much whiter.

"Master, Inspection Fu requests an audience." The long-term attendant came in to report.

"Ask him to come in." Wu Mingjin said grumpily. Although he knew that Fu BoWen's twelve people couldn't resist the landing of the 'Kun' bandits, he still held a grudge against this person for fleeing at the mere sight and not fighting with force. Now he could only perfunctorily deal with him; after all, he was the only military officer in the county, and he still had to rely on him. Fu BoWen probably also knew that his guilt was heavy, so he was very diligent in both preparing for war in the city and going out of the city for investigation.

"Respected Sir, the 'Kun' bandits are building a city on Bairen Beach!"

Wu Mingjin's hand shook, and the tea spilled out. He hurriedly asked: "How do you know?"

"Yesterday I personally went to investigate. The 'Kun' bandits have already built many houses on Bairen Beach!"

Wu Mingjin's teacup almost fell to the ground—his biggest worry was this. If the pirates occupied and did not leave, what should he do? In the past, he always held hope that the pirates would leave naturally after staying for a few days. Now not only did they not leave, but they were also building roads, and now they were building a stockade in a place less than ten li from the county seat.

Once the stockade is built, the pirates will occupy it for a long time. Needless to say anything else, it is already September, and soon it will be the days for collecting autumn grain. Both banks of the Wenlan River are grain production areas of this county. With pirates right in front of them, how dare the common people go to the fields to harvest grain!

If the autumn grain cannot be collected... Magistrate Wu knew that this was much more serious in nature than pirates causing trouble within the territory. Needless to say anything else, this black gauze cap (official post) was definitely gone.

"Quickly invite Mr. Liu." Wu Mingjin walked in a circle and ordered, "Invite all the gentry in the city! And also Master Huang from Huang Family Stockade."

The officials and gentry in the city listened to the news from the spies at the meeting. Among them, there were quite a few who had read military books. Seeing that this group of 'Kun' bandits lined up along the main road, they thought the pirates knew nothing about military affairs, setting up this long snake formation where head and tail could not look after each other. They didn't build a stockade with strict trenches and ramparts like in Bopu. There were only two or three bandits carrying bird guns everywhere. Most were laborers with short clothes and 'Kun' hair working.

With this, the officials and gentry became much bolder. Because Fu BoWen lost his defense area as the Bopu Inspection, he was most active in advocating attacking the pirates to atone for his crimes. Magistrate Wu specifically pointed out that the busy autumn season was approaching, and farmers along the river dared not go to the fields. If delayed, this year's harvest would be gone. Not only would it be sorry to the imperial court above, but the small people below would probably have no way to make a living, let alone pay rent... The gentry's minds gradually became active. Matters concerning their vital interests, they had to take the initiative. Some immediately expressed their willingness to contribute people and money to fight and drive away the pirates.

On the eleventh day of the ninth lunar month, the heads of various village stockades with militia were ordered to enter the city for discussion. Magistrate Wu's wording this time was extremely severe, plus several wealthy gentry and big households in the county clearly expressed their willingness to fight to the death, so the small stockades had to agree to participate, contributing three or five people, or knives, guns, and gunpowder. By the thirteenth day, nearly three hundred militia had arrived in the county seat. Magistrate Wu still felt it was not enough, and sent people to Lipan Du in Xinhua Township in the south of the county to conscript thirty Li native soldiers from the Li caverns. These native soldiers were all crossbowmen, equipped with poison arrows refined with poison.

Licentiate Liu suggested a night attack, and Magistrate Wu also agreed very much. But Inspection Fu and Guard Commander Huang both opposed. They had some actual combat experience and knew that fighting at night, even the best-trained official troops would find it difficult to control the advance and retreat of the ranks, let alone a rabble like them gathered temporarily. Since they were a rabble, the only way was to rely on numerical superiority, fiercely attack one point of the pirates, use the many to bully the few, eat up a group of troops, and destroy some of the pirates' vehicles and equipment.

Fu BoWen ordered everyone to prepare more fire seeds and gunpowder, ready to set fire during the battle. He originally planned to bring the Franks cannons of the guard station, but Hundred Household Sun insisted on refusing, claiming that both cannons and soldiers were for defending the city, and fighting outside the city was the county's business, which he could not control. Magistrate Wu went to speak personally, but was also rejected. He was very disappointed in his heart. The messenger sent to Tang Yunwen at Baisha also returned. Tang Yunwen claimed that he would participate in the suppression of Liu Laoxiang recently and had no time to come to expel this "small group of pirates".

However, Tang Yunwen's answer was also within his expectations. If the bandits did not break Lingao City, the official army would not come to suppress them. right now, they could only pull themselves together and fight with all their might.

The county gathered everything in the armory to equip these scantily clad militia, ordered the blacksmiths in the city to forge many new iron spearheads, collected various scrap copper and iron to use as cannon shots, and recruited manpower to build war chariots... For a time, the city was in turmoil and unbearable noise.

Every bit of these movements in the city was reported to the Executive Committee by the observation post under the city. Whether Lingao County was further strengthening defense or preparing for a counterattack, no one could make a judgment. Finally, the order to strengthen alert was issued, but the Military Team actually had no more strength.

Including the armed militia mobilized after landing, the Military Team had a total of only more than seventy people, from which three people sent to the surveillance point outside the county seat and two people escorting the long-range reconnaissance and exploration team were deducted. The remaining people were responsible for guard tasks from Bopu camp, warning posts along the highway, all the way to the Bairen Beach construction site itself. The Military Team had already canceled the three-shift duty mode and adopted a two-shift mode to barely maintain a certain scale of alertness.

Whether such a defense line full of holes would be effective in front of the Daming militia training groups, only actual combat could answer this question. This is not a game; it has no LOAD available. Every person dead, every piece of equipment lost, means irreparable loss.

All kinds of news coming from the observation post indicated that Daming Lingao County was about to launch a comprehensive attack on them. This was beyond the Executive Committee's expectation. Originally, it was thought that the county would not attack before receiving reinforcements from the Ming army, but on the thirteenth day of the ninth lunar month, the observation post found people dismantling the crouching tiger cannons on the city tower. This action further proved the Military Team's speculation. He Ming warned the Executive Committee that their current security situation was not optimistic. The Executive Committee decided in an emergency meeting to fully mobilize. Except for a few projects continuing, all others were suspended. SKS rifles were distributed to all males, revolvers to all females, and the Military Team was responsible for conducting several live-fire shooting trainings as soon as possible.

He Ming knew that the training most people had received was limited. During the preparation stage for transmigration, due to conditional restrictions, the so-called military training was mainly marching in formation and practicing physical fitness. Live-fire shooting had not been done a few times. A rookie unfamiliar with shooting holding an SKS was no different from holding a fire stick. Let alone expecting them to fight actively and effectively.

After discussion in the meeting, the Military Team decided to continue using the mobile defense plan. Once under attack, the mobilized soldiers would retreat to important strongholds, while the Military Team soldiers would use agricultural vehicles and jeeps for maneuvering. Where the enemy concentrated the greatest attack force, the agricultural vehicle mobile unit would attack them unexpectedly from the side and rear. He Ming believed that his side's powerful communication and mobility capabilities would effectively make up for the shortage of troops.
