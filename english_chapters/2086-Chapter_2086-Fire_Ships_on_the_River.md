# Chapter 2086 - Fire-Ships on the River

Not only that, they had also explicitly warned him that the Council of Elders was about to march on Guangzhou. If he wanted to preserve his office and his life, he should seek a transfer and leave early.

Xiong Wenchan would not, of course, flee simply because of some words from the pirates. He knew the Australians were not given to empty threats. However, by the pace at which government forces waged war, if he were to mobilize the armies of the Two Guangs to subjugate Hainan, it would take at least eight months to a year of preparation. If the pirates wanted to launch an expedition from Hainan with just a few thousand elite soldiers, that clearly wouldn't work—they'd first have to "sweep the land for troops," conscript peasants, drill them into an army, and that would take at least half a year.

Therefore he had made some preparations: casting many cannons in Foshan; manufacturing numerous new firearms—many copied from military treatises and diagrams presented to the court by various scholars and generals; expanding garrison troop quotas throughout the region; and hiring an additional five thousand water-fighters from the Tanka boat-dwellers to reinforce the naval forces inside and outside the Pearl River estuary.

He had not forgotten about Zhaoqing's own security either. The first batch of Red-Barbarian cannons mounted on the new millstone-style rotating platforms had been installed at the mouth of Antelope Gorge. Not only was a battery positioned at the eastern entrance, but following advice from a defeated general from the old Humen engagement, a permanent garrison was stationed beside the battery.

Antelope Gorge had fortifications at both ends. At the western entrance near Zhaoqing's prefectural city, he had also installed batteries and a garrison company. He had originally planned to build two more batteries on both sides of the narrowest section mid-gorge, but surveyors reported the engineering would be massive. Though the mountains on either side of Antelope Gorge were not sheer cliffs, transporting Red-Barbarian cannons weighing several thousand *jin* up roadless slopes and constructing battery emplacements would take years.

To guard against the pirates bypassing the waterway and taking the overland route, he had established a new camp on Beiling Mountain northwest of Zhaoqing, stationing a company to control the mountain pass.

Yet they had come so quickly! All the money and grain he'd invested in rebuilding the Pearl River estuary defenses had been utterly useless. Garrisons had surrendered one after another—not only had Humen's batteries not fired a shot, but Guangzhou itself had opened its gates without bloodshed. The thousand-plus soldiers he had painstakingly rebuilt under the Training Guerrilla Commander had simply defected en masse. The Commander himself had escaped with only a dozen bodyguards and household retainers.

Xiong Wenchan secretly regretted that his strategy of "orderly deployment, resistance at every stage" had turned out to be nothing but fantasy!

Regret was now useless. With Guangzhou lost, Zhaoqing had become the place that must be held.

Yet he had no time for careful preparations. Events had proven his estimate of the Fubo Army's marching speed was also wrong. After entering Guangzhou, the Fubo Army had made virtually no pause—neither "resting for several days" nor "plundering for three days." They had raced through the city without stopping, sailing up the river straight for Zhaoqing. From the mouths of fleeing officials and gentry, he learned the Fubo Army had advanced non-stop by river. In just three days, they had reached Antelope Gorge.

Yet Zhaoqing's forces were meager. He couldn't quickly summon the Eastern and Western Mountain garrison commanders from Luoding to assist. The only organized unit was the Zhaoqing Naval Battalion. Including his own retainers, the bodyguards of officials and officers who had fled from Guangzhou, and the local Guard garrison troops... everything totaled barely over two thousand men, plus a thousand Tanka water-fighters.

According to reconnaissance reports, the pirate forces gathered at Antelope Gorge numbered only about three thousand, with several hundred naval vessels large and small. Several large ships carried "giant cannons." Clearly, any river battle would end in defeat. Thus "fire-ships" had once again become the Ming commanders' consensus.

Xiong Wenchan watched the fire-ship squadron depart in grand array and exhaled slowly. Whether Zhaoqing could be held—everything hung on this single throw of the dice.

According to his orders, part of the naval fleet would follow the fire-ships. Once the fire-ships threw the pirate flotilla into chaos, they would take advantage of the current and sweep down upon them. The remaining ships would form a defensive line in front of the prefectural city—the last river defense if the fire-ships failed to break through.

"Your Excellency, these naval vessels waiting on the river are useless," Chang Qingyun advised in a low voice. "If the fire-ships fail to break the enemy, these ships will be like clay chickens and pottery dogs—utterly helpless. Why not commit the entire force, ride the momentum of the fire-ships downstream, and make one desperate gamble? Perhaps there's some chance of victory..."

Xiong Wenchan merely stroked his beard with a faint smile, saying nothing. Chang Qingyun couldn't understand and could only retreat to one side, mumbling.

Only Xiong Wenchan's central army commander knew the real purpose. These ships were meant to buy time for the Governor's escape. Once the pirates reached the city walls, he would immediately abandon the city, board a boat, and flee upriver to Wuzhou. Though the prepared sampan had three shifts of strong oarsmen ready to rotate, rowing upstream was inevitably slow. Without naval warships to delay the enemy, he might be captured alive before even clearing Dading Gorge.

"Enemy vessels sighted! Bearing 265, range 4 cables, heading 75, speed 7 knots!" The lookout shouted his report.

Even without the report, Schneider had already spotted the emerging masts through his binoculars.

"So they really are coming out to fight!" he murmured. As always happened before combat, his body tensed. Raising his binoculars, he adjusted the focus. The first vessel appeared in his eyepiece—a typical small West River rice boat, with bamboo bundles lashed to the bow, coated with mud. The waterline was pressed low.

Then a second appeared beside it, then a third, a fourth... too many to count. Ships flooded toward them; suddenly the river was covered with vessels of all sizes. With sails raised and oars plashing, riding the current downstream, they bore straight at the fleet.

Schneider felt his scalp tingle. The river here was narrow; heading upstream, he had little room to maneuver. His only option was to exploit the range advantage and destroy as many enemy vessels as possible at distance.

He ordered: "Formation heading 270. Speed 5 knots. Prepare for combat."

Ruan Xiaowu issued the firing command: "High-explosive shells, load!" The gunners used ramrods to load shells and silk powder charges into the breech. They cranked the handwheels; steam hissed from pipe joints as the massive bottle-shaped barrel elevated.

"Loading complete!"

The rangefinders called out distances: "3.5 cables! 3 cables!"

When the range closed to 3 cables, Schneider ordered: "Fire!"

The *Zhujiang's* battle pennant shot to the masthead. The main gun lurched as flame erupted from the muzzle. Given the *Zhujiang's* tiny displacement, the gun's recoil kicked the gunboat backward, throwing up a huge spray.

The shell screamed through the air in an arc. Ruan Xiaowu, stopwatch in hand, observed the impact through his binoculars.

Almost without need to aim, the high-explosive shell landed squarely among the densely packed fire-ships. A flash of red—a yellow-stained water column shot skyward.

Ruan Xiaowu immediately corrected the impact data.

"Reference on *Zhujiang*—*Suijiang*, open fire! Grapeshot!"

From the tail of the formation, a 621-class converted armed paddlewheeler's 130mm main gun fired at high elevation in a straddling shot. The shell arced over the fleet. The 130mm canister round shrieked through the air, then burst, spraying its twenty-seven one-pound iron balls indiscriminately across the river surface.

In an instant, iron balls raked across hulls. Where they struck, shattered planking, masts, sails, and the heads and bodies of sailors flew in all directions. The scorching projectiles ignited straw soaked in tung oil and gunpowder. Ships erupted in flames, then rapidly listed and sank as river water flooded in...

"What the hell is that..." Standing on the deck of the rearmost vessel, Cao Bajiao watched clearly, his heart chilling. He involuntarily hunched his neck. But the second cannon blast followed immediately, shells falling even closer, screaming projectiles once again sweeping the river surface. Hailing down from the sky, they harvested ships once more. Cao Bajiao's courage shattered. He had no more heart for "directing from the center." Leading his men, he scrambled into the sampan at the stern, cut the mooring line, and fled toward the riverbank—he dared not head for Zhaoqing. If captured, he'd lose his head.

"Range 2 cables!" came the observer's voice. Schneider ordered: "All vessels, fire at will!"

At under 400 meters, both the 30mm rapid-fire guns and the 13mm "typewriters" were well within effective range—and they were shooting at area targets. High-angle fire with maximum dispersion caused no problems.

Dense lead balls showered down on the fire-ships like rain, instantly shredding the bamboo-shield screens at the bows, igniting the straw in the holds. Fire-ships blazed; sailors died or fled. Unmanned, burning vessels collided with each other, drifting downstream toward the fleet.
