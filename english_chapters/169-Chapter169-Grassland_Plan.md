# Chapter 169: Grassland Plan

Huang Xiong joined the expedition as a squad leader in the 3rd Company. He had never seen such a lavish march. The units followed the coastline—the Navy's *Fubo* cruised nearby, keeping pace. At every bivouac, supply ships quickly beached—wheeled field kitchens rolled down wide gangplanks.

The field kitchens were ingeniously built—thin iron plate construction with stoves and chimneys. They were originally designed to be horse-drawn, but currently, they were shipped. The firewood soldiers gathered was quickly ignited. Crates of provisions came from the ships.

Water was pumped from a dedicated transport ship—an astonishing extravagance to Huang Xiong. He knew the Australians "processed" everything—including drinking water. They never drank raw water from rivers or wells, and they forbade their subordinates from doing so too.

For logistics organizer Ma Qianzhu, this wasn't unusual. The transmigrators lacked bleaching powder for field purification. A coastal march meant a difficult freshwater supply—Lingao's west was water-scarce. Ship transport was safe and convenient, saving the soldiers time and energy on water collection.

The crate contents weren't rice or flour—they were paper-wrapped blocks marked with Arabic numerals and words: "Grassland-1," "Grassland-2," etc. The paper wrappers had different-colored bands. Huang Xiong watched curiously as the cooks unwrapped them, revealing grayish or brownish blocks. They looked unappetizing. But once boiling water was added, a strange fragrance arose. It looked unappetizing, but the fragrance made mouths water—especially for the soldiers who had been marching all day with heavy packs.

"What's this?" He asked the stirring cook.

"Grassland-1 and -2."

"What is it?"

"I don't know. Chief Ma got it directly from the Farm." The cook sniffed. "Smells great. Don't know the ingredients."

"Flour paste? I can't eat wheat." One Lingao local complained.

"Flour paste? Dream on. I bet it's sweet potato powder."

"Can't be. On regular days we eat white rice—but on campaign we eat potatoes? Nobody would do that." Huang Xiong knew that normally soldiers were treated like beggars, but combat required proper feeding.

"Chow's ready! Chow's ready!" The cook banged his ladle on the pot rim.

Soldiers lined up by unit number—1st Platoon 1st Squad first, then 2nd Squad—to the last, which was the 3rd Platoon 9th Squad. New Army officers demonstrated officer-soldier equality, lining up with soldiers since training. Now it was habitual. Though some officers complained: daily white rice plus salted fish was a luxury for soldiers, but for officers, it was monotony. Some snuck to the cafeteria for extras. Ma Qianzhu discovered this and strictly forbade it, ordering officers to eat with the soldiers. He led by example.

After persevering for several days, Ma Qianzhu found that unlike the 5km runs (which got easier with persistence), this grew worse. Finally, he decided that officers would get evening supplements. For this expedition, officers' packs contained 125g of canned luncheon meat—making all transmigrators green with envy.

Huang Xiong queued for a portion of paste. He studied it momentarily, closed his eyes, and spooned it in. The richness of the flavor almost short-circuited his taste buds. Such deliciousness in this world! He quickly finished everything and rushed to check for leftovers. The pot was already mobbed—everyone holding up bowls demanding "more."

The cook—facing such enthusiasm for the first time—couldn't decide who should get the remaining scrapings. Finally, he added water and distributed it as soup.

Dongmen Chuiyu nodded, writing in his notebook: "Grassland-1 and -2: highly satisfactory."

After the meal, the Medical Team's female nurses landed, carrying red cross boxes and asking about pains and discomfort. Immediately many claimed foot pain or stomachache.

Tian Liang spotted Guo Fu among the nurses—he claimed stomach pain too. Mass stomach complaints terrified Hema (River Horse), who was still on the ship. Post-meal mass stomachaches? Food poisoning? Even mass diarrhea was unacceptable. A military demonstration becoming a trail of diarrhea would be a huge embarrassment. He personally landed with his medicine kit.

"Your stomach's perfectly fine." Hema slapped Tian Liang's belly—now it truly hurt.

The stomach farce quickly ended. The units resumed the march. Field kitchens were loaded back onto the ships. Soldiers packed up everything, including burying feces and garbage. Hygiene work was never neglected.

These 200+ men marched along barren roads toward Baitu. The weather was clear. Soldiers advanced to drum beats. Occasionally they saw farmers and merchants. Sometimes they passed villages. Seeing orderly troops pass, people watched—but didn't flee. The transmigrators' "righteous" reputation had clearly spread county-wide.

Roadside village gentry and elders, courting goodwill, sent representatives with tea, grain, chickens, and pork to "entertain the troops." Xi Yazhou always spoke with them, then dismissed the sweating elders—but accepted nothing. Huang Xiong found this incomprehensible—disciplined armies just didn't loot or disturb—but refusing offered gifts?

He mentioned this to Old Tiger—who laughed: "Meat? Ask the Medical Team if they'd take it."

"Why not?" Huang Xiong wondered—did Australians eat special meat?

"You're still new. You'll understand eventually."

Near dusk, the units had covered two-thirds of the distance. Tomorrow meant mountain marching. According to the maps, Baitu was under 15km away in a straight line. Xi Yazhou ordered a bivouac, preparing for the next day's attack.

"Bivouac! Cadets supervise!" Xi Yazhou ordered.

The Military-Political School cadets were distributed to platoons for observation—watching transmigrator officers' command and management. Headquarters also had cadets. Once the order was given, they sprang into action.

Bivouac training had been drilled countless times. Officers, cadets, and soldiers all knew their responsibilities. After site selection, platoons self-organized. Under cadet coordination, they assigned work sectors and tasks per regulations: wave-pattern trenches, excess soil piled into berms, barbed wire atop berms, and wooden corner towers. All grass and shrubs within 100m were cleared.

Bivouacs always meant defense first—an ancient Roman principle that was also the tramsmigrators' principle, even with superior technology and training.

Soldiers cut poles. Two raincoat halves tied together formed a two-man tent. The bivouac was platoon-zoned—drainage ditches and movement paths between zones. An emergency pre-assigned each platoon's assembly positions. Everything was well-organized.

Seeing 15 or 16-year-old cadets managing affairs competently, Huang Xiong was astonished. He could do this, but only because of years of military experience. These cadets had barely spent two months with the bald people. Though somewhat rough—with time and combat experience, they'd become qualified officers.

He secretly asked one cadet, "Where did you learn this?"

"The Chiefs taught us. Also this—" The kid cadet pulled a worn-covered book from his satchel: *Infantry Regulations*.

"Just reading?"

"Chiefs taught from this book. Everything's here—digging trenches, bivouacs, march formations—" The cadet spoke reverently about this regulations book claiming "it has everything."

Just the military manual! Huang Xiong thought. Wasn't this armchair strategizing? Though illiterate, he knew Zhao Kuo's cautionary tale. He recalled that Australians did love books. Though soldiers couldn't enter headquarters, he'd peeked inside. Most things were books and paper scrolls—exactly like scholars' studies.

Were Australians planning to fight from books? Utterly unbelievable.
