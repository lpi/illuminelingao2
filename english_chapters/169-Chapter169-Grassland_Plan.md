# Chapter 169: Grassland Plan

Huang Xiong—as 3rd-Company squad-leader—joined the expedition. He'd never seen such lavish-marching. Units followed coastline—Navy's *Fubo* cruised nearby keeping-pace. Every-bivouac, supply-ships quickly-beached—wheeled field-kitchens rolled down wide-gangplanks.

Field-kitchens were ingeniously-built—thin-iron-plate construction with stoves and chimneys. Originally horse-drawn—currently shipped. Soldiers' gathered-firewood was quickly-ignited. Crates of provisions came from ships.

Water was pumped from dedicated transport-ship—astonishing extravagance to Huang Xiong. He knew Australians "processed" everything—including drinking-water. They never drank raw-water from rivers or wells—forbidding subordinates too.

For logistics-organizer Ma Qianzhu this wasn't unusual. Transmigrators lacked bleaching-powder for field-purification. Coastal-march meant difficult freshwater-supply—Lingao's west was water-scarce. Ship-transport was safe, convenient—saving soldiers' time/energy for water-collection.

Crate-contents weren't rice or flour—paper-wrapped blocks marked with Arabic-numerals and words: "Grassland-1," "Grassland-2," etc. Paper-wrappers had different-colored bands. Huang Xiong watched curiously as cooks unwrapped—revealing grayish/brownish blocks. Unappetizing-looking. But once boiling-water was added... strange-fragrance arose. The aroma attracted half-day-starved soldiers. Approaching fragrance-source—pots held paste-like brownish-substance. Looked unappetizing—but fragrance made mouths-water—especially for pack-laden day-marchers.

"What's this?" He asked stirring-cook.

"Grassland-1 and -2."

"What is it?"

"Don't know. Chief-Ma got it directly from Farm." Cook sniffed. "Smells great. Don't know ingredients."

"Flour-paste? I can't eat wheat." One Lingao-local complained.

"Flour-paste? Dream on. Bet it's sweet-potato powder."

"Can't be. Regular-days white-rice—campaigning eat potatoes? Nobody'd do that." Huang Xiong knew: normally soldiers were treated like beggars—but combat required proper-feeding.

"Chow's ready! Chow's ready!" Cook banged ladle on pot-rim.

Soldiers lined-up by unit-number—1st-Platoon 1st-Squad first, then 2nd-Squad—to last were 3rd-Platoon 9th-Squad. New Army officers demonstrated officer-soldier-equality—lining-up with soldiers since training. Now habitual. Though some officers complained—daily white-rice plus salted-fish was soldiers' luxury but officers' monotony. Some snuck to cafeteria for extras. Ma Qianzhu discovered this—strictly-forbade it, ordering officers eat with soldiers. He led by-example.

After persevering several-days, Ma Qianzhu found unlike 5km-runs (easier with-persistence), this grew-worse. Finally decided: officers got evening supplements. This expedition—officers' packs had 125g canned-luncheon-meat—making all transmigrators green-with-envy.

Huang Xiong queued for portion of paste. Studied it momentarily—closed eyes—spooned it in. The flavor's richness almost-short-circuited his taste-buds. Such deliciousness in this world! He quickly-finished everything—rushed to check for leftovers. Pot was already-mobbed—everyone holding-up bowls demanding "more."

Cook—first-time facing such-enthusiasm—with remaining scrapings, couldn't decide who got it. Finally added water—distributed as soup.

Dongmen Chuiyu nodded, writing: "Grassland-1 and -2: highly-satisfactory."

After-meal, Medical-Team's female-nurses landed—carrying red-cross-boxes, asking about pains/discomfort. Immediately many claimed foot-pain or stomachache.

Tian Liang spotted Guo-Fu among nurses—claimed stomach-pain too. Mass stomach-complaints terrified ship-bound Hema (River-Horse)—post-meal mass-stomachaches? Food-poisoning? Even mass-diarrhea was unacceptable. Military-demonstration becoming trail-of-diarrhea—huge-embarrassment. He personally-landed with medicine-kit.

"Your stomach's perfectly-fine." Hema slapped Tian Liang's belly—now he truly-hurt.

Stomach-farce quickly-ended. Units resumed-march. Field-kitchens were re-shipped. Soldiers packed-up everything—including burying feces and garbage. Hygiene-work was never-neglected.

These 200+ men marched along barren-roads toward Baitu. Weather clear. Soldiers advanced to drum-beats. Occasionally—farmers, merchants. Sometimes villages. Seeing orderly-troops pass, people watched—but didn't-flee. Transmigrators' "righteous" reputation had clearly-spread county-wide.

Roadside-village gentry/elders—courting goodwill—sent representatives with tea, grain, chickens, pork for "troop-entertainment." Xi Yazhou always spoke with them, then dismissed sweating-elders—but accepted nothing. Huang Xiong found this incomprehensible—disciplined-armies just didn't loot or disturb—but refusing offered-gifts?

He mentioned this to Old-Tiger—who laughed: "Meat? Ask Medical-Team if they'd take it."

"Why not?" Huang Xiong wondered—did Australians eat special-meat?

"You're still new. You'll understand eventually."

Near-dusk—units had covered two-thirds distance. Tomorrow: mountain-marching. Per maps—Baitu was under-15km straight-line. Xi Yazhou ordered bivouac—preparing next-day's attack.

"Bivouac! Cadets supervise!" Xi Yazhou ordered.

Military-Political-School cadets were distributed to platoons for observation—watching transmigrator-officers' command/management. Headquarters also had cadets. Order-given—they sprang into action.

Bivouac-training was drilled countless-times. Officers, cadets, soldiers all knew their-responsibilities. After site-selection, platoons self-organized. Under cadet-coordination—assigning work-sectors/tasks per-regulations: wave-pattern trenches, excess-soil piled into berms, barbed-wire atop berms, wooden-corner-towers. All grass/shrubs within 100m cleared.

Bivouacs always meant defense-first—ancient Roman principle—also transmigrators' principle. Even with superior technology/training.

Soldiers cut poles. Two raincoat-halves tied together formed two-man-tent. Bivouac was platoon-zoned—drainage-ditches, movement-paths between-zones. Emergency pre-assigned each-platoon's assembly-positions. Everything well-organized.

Seeing 15-16-year-old cadet-kids managing-affairs competently, Huang Xiong was astonished. He could do this—but from years' military-experience. These cadets had barely two-months with bald-people. Though somewhat-rough—with time and combat-experience, they'd become qualified-officers.

He secretly-asked one cadet: "Where'd you learn this?"

"Chiefs taught us. Also this—" Kid-cadet pulled worn-covered book from satchel: *Infantry Regulations*.

"Just reading?"

"Chiefs taught from this-book. Everything's here—digging trenches, bivouacs, march-formations—" Cadet spoke reverently about this regulations-book claiming "it has everything."

Just military-manual! Huang Xiong thought. Wasn't this arm-chair-strategizing? Though illiterate—he knew Zhao-Kuo's cautionary-tale. Recalling: Australians did love books. Though soldiers couldn't enter headquarters—he'd peeked inside. Most-things were books and paper-scrolls—exactly like scholars' studies.

Australians planned to fight from-books? Utterly-unbelievable.
