# Chapter 211: Circulation

Thus, the transmigrator regime's first currency system was established. Upon the issuance of the new currency, all other tickets and vouchers were abolished. The work-point vouchers widely used throughout the Commune were recalled based on their grain exchange ratio.

"Should we establish a bank to handle this?"

"Of course," Cheng Dong said. "But for now, we won't use the name 'bank' or 'money house' or anything like that."

The Finance and Banking Committee's strategy was to establish a grain shop to handle the issuance, collection, and exchange of currency. Since the currency was backed by grain, a grain shop would be easier for the common people to understand than a bank, while also providing the cover of "merchant-issued tokens."

This grain shop was named "Delong Grain Shop" at Wen Desi's suggestion. Its headquarters would be in East Gate Market. To project the image of a major, creditworthy establishment, the Executive Committee approved the construction of a new two-story building as its business premises.

The new banknotes were to be printed by the printing plant under Zhou Dongtian's Propaganda Department. As the transmigrators' first set of banknotes, they could not be as crude as the previous work-point vouchers, rice tickets, and salt tickets. They needed to be attractive and durable, with specific anti-counterfeiting measures.

Zhou Dongtian brought in Bai Duoluo and Tan Ming to study the problem. One had worked in printing, and the other had operated three-color presses—both were professionals with expertise far deepening than that of the generalist Zhou Dongtian.

Specialized banknote paper was naturally unavailable. The transmigrators' small paper workshop could currently mass-produce only rough straw paper—made from local rice straw and fit only for toilet use. The small quantities of writing paper produced didn't meet banknote requirements either. Cheng Dong noted that the inventory included some heavy-weight colored cardstock with a stiff texture. Both its quality and colors were beyond the ability of any papermaking workshop in this timeline to replicate. The Lingao Food Circulation Vouchers would come in three denominations: 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. The 10-yuan note would use yellow paper, the 5-yuan red paper, and the 1-yuan green paper. Subsidiary coins would also be issued: 50 fen, 20 fen, 5 fen, and 1 fen, all on blue paper and differentiated by size.

The banknote designs featured agricultural themes—oxen, farmers, wheat sheaves, rice paddies, and the like. The issuer was "Delong Grain Shop," with a seal reading "Delong Grain Shop" in seal script below, along with Cheng Dong's signature. The reverse of each note also bore a line in regular script: "Each yuan redeemable for one catty of rice."

All these designs were lithographed in color by Bai Duoluo. Though Zhou Dongtian had initially wanted to use the four-color press in the printing plant, ink supplies were running low and couldn't be replenished for the time being. When they saw the sample notes, everyone thought they looked rather ugly—the designs had no three-dimensional depth whatsoever.

"It'll have to do." Cheng Dong looked at the sample notes that had been delivered, knowing this was the printing plant's limit. Asking them to produce something comparable to modern banknotes was impossible. Even these notes were already beyond the capabilities of local counterfeiters.

The largest user of circulation vouchers was Wu De. The monthly work-point settlement alone was a major expense. According to Wu De's plan, Baireng Commune would completely abolish the supply system and implement a monetized wage system. Each commune member would receive circulation vouchers based on the work-points they earned. The commune canteen's food supply would also shift to members purchasing meals with circulation vouchers.

For outside laborers belonging to the Labor Corps without Bairren Commune household registration, free meals would continue to be provided according to labor intensity standards, but their wages would also be paid in circulation vouchers. In fact, the transmigrators had already been paying these workers with rice tickets and salt tickets for some time, and they had accepted this.

Local people recruited by transmigrator enterprises and departments—the so-called "employees"—though registered in Baireng Commune, had their wages paid by their respective departments, not the Commune. Their meals would likewise be changed to self-funded, like regular commune members.

Finally, there was the military. Military pay had always been in silver. The officers opposed rashly replacing silver with paper money—this would give soldiers a sense of being cheated. Having shiny white silver turn into paper slips wouldn't make anyone happy.

So it was decided the military's basic treatment would remain unchanged: free meals provided, with pay continuing in silver.

To encourage soldiers to use paper currency, Cheng Dong proposed implementing a "military preference" policy at all transmigrator-owned shops in East Gate Market. Military personnel purchasing goods with circulation vouchers would enjoy a five percent discount. To give them access to this benefit, the grain shop established exchange offices in the military camps to collect and exchange their silver—this policy was exclusive to New Army soldiers.

"Just open an office in the garrison," Xi Yazhou suggested to Cheng Dong. "For the past two months, the soldiers have been hiding their silver all over the place. Recently there have even been losses and thefts. These soldiers are alone with nowhere to store their money. Set up a deposit service—even without interest, they'll be happy to save."

Soon, Delong Grain Shop offices were established in both the Bairren and Bopu garrison areas. These so-called offices were simply repurposed rooms within the garrison, each containing a wooden counter and some paper, brushes, and ledgers. The Finance and Banking Committee certainly didn't have enough personnel to provide daily service to the military, so the offices were open only on Mondays and paydays. Services offered included silver-to-voucher exchange, savings, and valuables storage. However, the current savings service paid no interest whatsoever—Delong Grain Shop's savings service was more like a coin storage service.

After this service launched, it was enthusiastically welcomed by the soldiers. However, few came to exchange for circulation vouchers. Most deposited their pay at the Delong office immediately after receiving it, getting a bankbook to carry on their person. Only soldiers with family locally would exchange some circulation vouchers on leave days to buy goods to take home.

After the first batch of circulation vouchers was distributed, the market didn't react dramatically. After all, those doing business at East Gate Market had grown accustomed to transmigrator vouchers over these months. Though the vouchers came in different types, one thing was clear: every transmigrator voucher could actually be exchanged for real goods, and the amounts were always exactly as stated, never shortchanged. Dongmen Chuiyu also posted numerous notices at East Gate Market, requiring all merchants to accept circulation vouchers across the board while guaranteeing they could exchange vouchers for grain at Delong Grain Shop at any time.

To build confidence in the circulation vouchers, every evening before market closing, Dongmen Chuiyu and the Delong staff would push handcarts full of rice, going shop to shop to redeem circulation vouchers. In the first few days, almost every shop would exchange their collected vouchers. But after half a month, very few did so anymore. Traveling merchants, receiving circulation vouchers but finding it inconvenient to carry grain on their journeys, chose to spend the vouchers directly at East Gate Market, using them to purchase various goods. Sedentary merchants initially exchanged vouchers for grain or used them to buy other goods as a precaution, but over time, as they discovered Delong Grain Shop continued to exchange vouchers freely at any time, many began keeping some vouchers on hand. After all, paper currency was far more convenient to carry and use than heavy copper coins and silver. The jumbled copper coins and the silver that varied in purity and constantly needed to be weighed had long been sources of complaint among merchants.

However, the circulation vouchers' range remained basically limited to transmigrator-controlled areas. Even in County Gate Market, just a stone's throw away, they weren't readily accepted—shopkeepers there generally took a wait-and-see attitude toward this paper money.

But Cheng Dong considered this normal. Paper currency was largely supported by government credit. Most paper currencies in the modern timeline were issued without backing—in this respect, they were even less secure than Lingao circulation vouchers backed by grain. The circulation vouchers would only be recognized as valuable wherever transmigrator influence reached. Without sufficient political and economic influence, people outside their territory naturally wouldn't accept them.

The final thing needing to be sorted out was the transmigrators' own internal currency: the point vouchers prescribed in the Transmigration Covenant as the units for distributing benefits to transmigrators.

Though during the operation of the Women's Cooperative enterprise, point vouchers had entered circulation as a form of capital and been used for consumption, they remained a virtual currency. Transmigrators consuming at the welfare cooperative paid with point vouchers through a signature and bill system, with receipts noting the date and amount. During financial settlement days, accountants from the Finance Department manually deducted the points from personal accounts on the computer. Not only was the procedure cumbersome, but it was also error-prone.

Now Cheng Dong proposed: make a portion of point vouchers physical, no longer merely computer ledger currency. Transmigrator salaries, hazard pay, and bonuses could all be paid in physical point vouchers. These vouchers were restricted to purchasing special goods and services, with external circulation prohibited. Currently, point vouchers could only be used at the transmigrator canteen, the Women's Cooperative, and the South Sea Demonstration Farm. Point vouchers had no lateral relationship with any other currency and no exchange rate. They were issued and collected solely by the Finance and Banking Committee.

Some suggested that since point vouchers were now physical, the supply system could be abolished for transmigrators in favor of a salary system. But after discussion, the Executive Committee decided to maintain the supply system for all transmigrators. The Executive Committee would continue to provide all transmigrators with free housing, medicine, food, basic weapons and ammunition, and clothing. However, transmigrators were permitted to use point vouchers at the three designated units to purchase additional consumer goods, including alcohol, tobacco, and other non-essential items. If the canteen had sufficient supplies, they could also buy extra chicken, duck, fish, and meat.

Point vouchers were the only currency transmigrators could legally hold. Apart from expense funds issued for mission requirements, individual transmigrators were not permitted to possess Lingao circulation vouchers or precious metals.
