# Chapter 1804 - Eve of Issuance

The letter was written to his patron, Young Master Liang. The Liang family had always been his backstage supporter and also his important major client. As soon as the wind of this currency reform leaked out, it aroused great interest from Young Master Liang, who asked him to pay close attention to the Australians' movements at all times.

In the letter, he detailed the process of the meeting and everyone's attitude, specifically mentioning Gao Ju's attitude of sparing no effort to stand on the platform and boast for the Australians. It seemed that the Australians' currency reform this time was imperative. At the meeting, everyone had reached a preliminary agreement. The guilds of various industries would share the quota for exchanging new currency according to their scale and capital strength. The Money Industry Guild had the largest shared quota, having to exchange two hundred thousand silver dollars. The guild internally considered this figure acceptable—after all, the exchange conditions given by the Australians were fair, calculating weight and fineness. Exchanging white silver for silver dollars wasn't really a loss.

However, Liang Chenlong also wrote his worries in the letter. He worried that exchanging white silver for silver coins was only the first step, and the next step would be to force them to accept a certain amount of silver dollar circulation notes.

Writing up to here, he sighed deeply, thinking that the next step would inevitably involve exchanging the collected copper coins for subsidiary coin notes—this was almost a sure thing. Although copper coins weren't very valuable, they were still money after all. He really felt the pain of exchanging them for pieces of paper.

After finishing the letter, he sealed it, stamped it with a secret seal, called a confidant, and whispered a few instructions.

The letter was not sent to the Liang residence as usual, but to Miss Yuewan at the Visiting Spring Brothel. Yuewan was "combed" (deflowered/patronized) by Liang Cunhou, equivalent to his mistress kept in the brothel. Many things that could not be done openly were contacted through her.

The servant took the order and left. Liang Chenlong watched his receding figure and couldn't help but let out a breath.

Liu Xiang sat at his desk, looking at the latest population statistics table on the table. Based on the first household registration data conducted after the establishment of the Guangzhou police system, he knew the exact population of the Guangzhou Special Municipality for the first time.

According to the administrative divisions of Nanhai and Panyu, the two attendant counties left by the Ming Dynasty in the past, plus the areas outside the city expected to be included in the "suburbs," including Henan Island and other places, the registered population totaled 283,700 people. This included all permanent residents with fixed abodes in Guangzhou. It did not include "floating populations" such as the Guan Di Temple group—this part of the population was at least over ten thousand.

The new household registration did not distinguish between non-agricultural and agricultural populations, because in the 17th century, the distinction between these two types of populations was not that clear-cut. Besides shop assistants and craftsmen in the city returning to their hometowns to help during busy farming seasons, and farmers from the countryside entering the city for short periods to work, there were also quite a few genuine farmers living in Guangzhou city, farming inside the city. Therefore, only broad occupational categories were registered—after all, in this era, a person's occupation was basically lifelong.

The registered population figures did not include the Tanka population. The Tanka data received from the River Police Station was very old, statistics from the Zhang Juzheng era. According to this outdated data, there were 22,000 Tanka people registered at the River Police Station. But the retained old clerks of the River Police Station said that the number of Tanka people was far more than this. Since they had no fixed abode and drifted uncertainly, it was difficult to accurately count their number, but the Tanka people active on the water surfaces of the Xijiang and Pearl Rivers outside Guangzhou city for long periods would not be fewer than 40,000.

To thoroughly figure out how many Tanka people there were, unless they were made to go ashore and settle down. The first large-scale practical project of the Guangzhou Municipal Government in 1950 was to build Tanka housing, letting the Tanka people go ashore to live, thereby controlling this group drifting outside mainstream society for the first time.

Controlling the Tanka people and making them go ashore to live and be registered as commoners would be of great benefit to the public security on the Pearl River water system, and even to the public security of Guangzhou: since ancient times, rivers and lakes have been natural hiding places for lawless elements.

But now Liu Xiang's Guangzhou Special Municipal Government was unable to do this, so he had to temporarily abandon the attempt to control the Tanka people. He put his main energy on the issuance of new currency.

The credit of new currency depended on whether its purchasing power could be guaranteed. Liu Xiang was very clear that once the new currency started to be issued, the issuance of banknotes would be like a flood breaking a dike.

First was the demand for currency circulation in the Guangzhou market itself. How much this figure actually was, no one had a bottom line—the Great Ming did not have a Statistics Bureau, nor did it have banks in the modern sense. No one could clearly figure out how much silver and copper coins were circulating in the market. The Ministry of Finance could only roughly estimate that about one million yuan of circulation notes were needed. Fearing it wouldn't be enough, the Ministry of Finance had already ordered the Hong Kong Mint to print millions more notes. Second was the expenditure of the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Compared to the past Guangzhou Prefecture, the expenses of the Guangzhou Municipal Government had expanded more than a hundred times. Building many new organs and maintaining operations, rapidly expanding public servants, taking in old personnel, relieving disaster victims, municipal projects... plus the unabated military expenditure demands. All these sharply amplified the quantity of new currency needed to be put into the market. After a rough estimation, Liu Xiang and the special commissioner group from the Ministry of Finance already had worries about inflation of the new currency.

Liu Xiang picked up another secret report; this was the latest statistics on Guangzhou's grain inventory. After abolishing tooth merchants and establishing two large bulk goods wholesale markets, it was mandatorily stipulated that all bulk grain transactions must be sold within the markets. Long-distance grain transport merchants from outside, farmers and landlords selling grain in batches, and local grain banks and grain shops engaged in wholesale and retail business all had to operate within the markets. The state-owned grain enterprises of the Senate, the Cooperatives, and Dachang Rice Shop also opened business offices in the markets as windows for operating and intervening in the grain trade.

At the same time, through the Federation of Industry and Commerce and trade guilds, inventory statistics were conducted on the large and small grain banks and grain shops engaged in grain wholesale and retail in the city. With this, the municipal government roughly figured out Guangzhou's bulk grain reserves. The total inventory of brown rice held by transporters, local wholesalers, and retailers was about 2,600 tons. This figure could supply the entire Guangzhou market for about one month.

According to the municipal government's past estimates of the population, 2,600 tons couldn't even support a month. However, Lin Baiguang believed that the past estimates were unscientific. Although the difference between the total population estimate and statistics was not large, the grain consumption quantity of 14 kilograms per person per month was too high. First, the elderly and children couldn't eat that much; second, 11 kilograms per month was barely enough for urban residents. The poor population in this city accounted for more than half, and their daily grain consumption simply couldn't reach the level of 11 kilograms per month. In addition, the big households in Guangzhou mostly had a considerable amount of stored grain—this was a convention at the time; big households often hoarded enough grain for the whole family to eat for two or three months. Furthermore, they could get grain supplies from tenants in the suburbs. Grain supply was not a problem. Since the household registration of the gentry and big households also included a large number of servants, with household sizes ranging from twenty or thirty to several hundred people, it could be said to alleviate a considerable part of the supply pressure.

In addition, the official treasury granaries left by the one prefecture and two counties of Guangzhou in the past, plus the grain in the confiscated "rebel properties," added up to seven or eight hundred tons in bits and pieces. Part of this grain had already been allocated for use as staff salaries and funds for the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Now there were still about 200 tons.

Besides these local grains, the warehouses of Guangzhou Great World and the warehouses on Hong Kong Island also stored 10,000 tons of brown rice transported from Southeast Asia and Hainan over the past three months. This was the trump card held in the hands of Liu Xiang and the Ministry of Finance. It was to deal with grain speculation.

Every major currency reform was almost always accompanied by a frenzy of speculation in necessities like grain. Especially in a situation like Guangzhou city, even Liu Xiang, who had never been a merchant, knew it was a good opportunity for grain speculation.

Guangdong's grain needed to be supplied by Guangxi. June and July in the two Guangs were the time for early rice harvest. In previous years, grain prices should have fallen by this time, but Guangdong itself lacked grain, and Guangxi was currently still under the rule of the Great Ming—Wuzhou had already set up water checkpoints forbidding all boats from going up or down—so the grain trade through Wuzhou also stopped. Under normal circumstances, just the news of the suspension of grain water transport in Wuzhou would be enough to trigger a skyrocketing grain price.

Fortunately, the Senate received reciprocity from the Chaozhou-Shantou Grain Gang for abolishing tooth merchants and clearing up tooth firm debts. Although the wholesale price of grain in the market rose slightly, the Chaozhou-Shantou Gang remained stable. The Chaozhou-Shantou Gang also used the advantages of its own merchant gang network to transfer grain from other parts of Guangdong to supply Guangzhou. This greatly alleviated the pressure on grain supply. It allowed Chen Ce, who was in full charge of economic and monetary policies in Guangzhou, not to use reserves on a large scale, but occasionally release a small amount of grain through cooperatives to suppress the rise in grain prices.

However, relying solely on the "return" of the Chaozhou-Shantou Gang was not enough. Merchant morality is profit-seeking. Their sacrifice of profit now was both reciprocity out of gratitude and because they knew that the Senate's violent machine was far from comparable to the Great Ming. However, once the profit was large enough, neither conscience nor fear would matter. Therefore, curbing speculation and guaranteeing currency value had to be based on the Senate itself.

In addition to storing a large amount of grain on Hong Kong Island, the Planning Commission simultaneously transported edible salt, cotton and linen fabrics, pickled and dried seafood products, and tea leaves from various regions to Hong Kong Island, ready to be transferred into Guangzhou at any time to stabilize prices.

In order to have sufficient channels for distribution, in addition to wholesale channels, in retail channels, Commercial Cooperatives, Dachang, and Wanyou rushed to open more than forty branch stores throughout Guangzhou city through receiving transfers, direct buying, etc. The retail network basically covered the entire urban area of Guangzhou and major towns in the suburbs. To ensure supply in townships, twenty mobile vending boats were refitted, all equipped with shop assistants and goods sources, to go down to the countryside for mobile vending in townships that had been basically pacified. Zheng Shangjie instructed the vending boats that they could also purchase rural local products according to market prices, further enlivening the rural economy and preparing for currency going into the countryside.
