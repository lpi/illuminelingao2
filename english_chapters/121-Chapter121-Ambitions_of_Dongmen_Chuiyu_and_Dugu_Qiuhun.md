# Chapter 121 - Ambitions of Dongmen Chuiyu and Dugu Qiuhun

In a conference room on the second floor of the hall displaying the public standard weighing instruments, the first meeting of the East Gate Market Industrial and Commercial Administration Office was being held. The conditions in the conference room were tough. The walls were only smeared with limestone, and because the construction was very hasty, the limestone had not completely dried yet. The floor was original ecological wood planks. The industrial department had not found lacquer trees for the time being, and modern paint was a very distant future. As for ceiling suspension and the like, there were none. The only modern equipment was a light bulb hanging high under the roof. However, the tables and chairs were very luxurious, worth at least several million in the 21st-century time and space. Large red sandalwood painting tables, red sandalwood official hat chairs, and rosewood round stools were messily arranged into the appearance of a conference room—these were all spoils transported from the Gou family.

There were seven or eight participants, all people willing to engage in commercial work. Some had real experience, while others were purely out of interest. The leader, a young man who claimed to have been an assistant administrator in an Industrial and Commercial Office, his name was no longer verifiable, but when he learned he was to be the management head of this East Gate Market, he gave himself a brand new name: "Dongmen Chuiyu" (Blowing Rain at the East Gate).

Beside him was his deputy: wearing an iron-gray uniform-style shirt, black trousers, and a black hat, with a line of characters on the armband "Administrative Law Enforcement Assistant." With a murderous look on his face, he looked like a Terminator of street vendors. Like Dongmen Chuiyu, this person's real name was unverifiable. In the history books of the future republic, he appeared with the weird name "Dugu Qiuhun" (Lonely Seeking Marriage). These two would pioneer a brand new commercial model of this time and space in Lingao County of the Great Ming.

In the not-too-distant future, the commerce of the transmigrators would eventually sweep across the four seas, and the trade network of overseas companies would span Europe, Asia, and Africa. But at this moment, all the commerce of the transmigrators was on that patch of mud without even concrete downstairs. Fortunately, Wen Desi had spoken: commerce was a project fully supported by the Executive Committee, with money if money was needed, and goods if goods were needed.

Where the flag points, trade opens the way. Colonial expansion in history invariably used commercial trade as a breakthrough. Trade could not only bring profits but also become an important means for colonizers to establish themselves locally. For the transmigrators, they had already used violent means to occupy the land. The next step was to increase contact with the local indigenous people, transforming themselves from green-faced and long-toothed pirates who killed without blinking into merchants with a large number of novel goods. The attraction of wealth would draw more and more wary locals to their side, eventually linking their own interests with them.

Of course, the transmigrators themselves also needed trade support, especially basic living materials like grain and non-staple food. All must be supplemented from local farmers. Relying on external input had great instability factors. Many people knew the history of ancient Romans often facing political instability because grain transported from Egypt did not arrive in time—this situation had to be avoided at all costs.

The meeting first reviewed yesterday's grain acquisition situation. Ever since the reconnaissance teams sent out in all directions reported that farmers had started to pay grain to landlords, the transmigrators began setting up points in East Gate Market to acquire grain. The local rice price was one tael and three qian of silver per shi. Calculated according to the general rice milling rate of paddy, about 70%, the acquisition price of paddy was set at eight qian per shi. This price didn't consider the costs of transportation and profit in the rice price—the commercial department estimated that the local grain acquisition price for paddy per shi would not exceed five qian. Acquiring at eight qian was already a rare high price.

The acquisition went very smoothly. The nearby common people, from small folks to big grain households, were moved seeing that they were willing to buy grain with shiny silver. At first, there were only sporadic ten or twenty people. Recently, more than one or two hundred people came every day, carrying grain in bags and dou on shoulders or pushing carts. The seven or eight people in the commercial department were too busy to handle it, so they had to call people from the agricultural department to help.

Some confusion occurred at the beginning because the locals were used to using dou as a grain measurement unit, ten dou making one shi. There were official dou and private dou, with different capacities. The top of the dou was open. Should the grain on the dou surface be flat or heaped, and if heaped, how high? These questions dumbfounded them. After a while of confusion, it was decided to implement new weights and measures, acquiring by weight. The acquisition price was set at eight qian of silver per one hundred kilograms, called "hectoliter" (gongshi). The weighing used a platform scale removed from the ship. Unexpectedly, this change in weights and measures did not cause resentment or protest from grain sellers. In their view, since the transmigrators were willing to pay money to buy grain, what measurement unit to use was their freedom. This surprised Dongmen Chuiyu greatly—no wonder it was said that ancient landlords used small measures for lending and large measures for collecting—the common people had no understanding of the importance of weights and measures at all.

In comparison, the common people were very interested in how to increase weight without using paddy. At first, everyone lacked experience and was busy and chaotic. The acquired paddy was mixed with many husks, even chaff and sand, causing quite a loss. At this time, someone came up with an idea and rushed to make a batch of grain probes to sample grain. Wu Nanhai also conducted emergency training, teaching everyone knowledge on how to distinguish the quality and moisture content of paddy, which curbed the situation of passing off inferior goods as quality ones.

"...Up to today, we have acquired 90 tons of paddy and 2100 kilograms of peanuts." Dongmen Chuiyu reported the acquisition situation to several committee members attending the meeting.

"How much more do you think we can acquire?" Wen Desi asked. 90 tons of paddy, milled into brown rice, would only be 70 tons. It seemed a lot, but with more and more people eating and the need to relieve the people, it was a bit tight.

Yu Eshui opened a notebook he carried with him: "There is still spare capacity for acquisition. According to the records of the county gazetteer, the autumn grain quota of Lingao during the Wanli era was 7646 shi 9 dou 2 sheng 7 he, and the newly reclaimed land rice levy was 6 shi 7 sheng 9 he, totaling 7686 shi 7 sheng 9 he. This is just the regular tax. Plus miscellaneous meltage fees and surcharges, and layers of exploitation by officials, the grain actually paid by grain households would not be less than 10,000 shi. Now it is the end of the Ming Dynasty, the time when powerful households concealing fields and population is most serious. A considerable part of the fields should not have grain tax. So I estimate the total yield of autumn grain in Lingao is between 50,000 shi and 70,000 shi. Acquiring three to five thousand shi is no problem for us."

Someone raised a question: "Is it necessary to reserve so much grain? Didn't we confiscate more than a thousand shi from the Gou family? And Salt Field Village has started selling salt to the mainland, exchanging salt for grain from Guangdong. Later we can also buy grain from Vietnam."

Wu Nanhai regarded the grain issue as very important and immediately retorted: "The more grain, the better. With grain in hand, there is no panic in the heart. Whether Guangdong or Vietnam, that's distant water. If cut off, it would be detrimental to stabilizing people's hearts."

Wen Desi continued: "At this stage, grain is harder currency than silver. Once there is a famine, grain prices skyrocket immediately, and silver depreciates. Don't forget it's still the Little Ice Age, and natural disasters are frequent. We are not just a few ships and a few hundred people anymore; we have to look at the overall situation of the whole county and make foolproof preparations."

"I also draw the Executive Committee's attention to the trade status and silver reserves," Cheng Dong spoke on behalf of the financial department, "Currently, the trade balance is a serious deficit, and silver is flowing out rapidly. After attacking Gou Family Stockade, our silver reserves rose to fifteen thousand taels under the old tael system, but nearly a thousand taels have flowed out in these few days. Continuing like this is not a solution; after all, there is also demand for currency circulation."

"Xiao Zishan went to Guangzhou. Should we ask him to withdraw tens of thousands of taels of goods payment deposited in the Gao family?"

"No need." Wen Desi said, "Lingao is a small place; too much silver inflow is not a good thing. We have another thing that can replace silver—salt." Salt had acted as currency for a long time in history. He prepared to use it to pay part of the grain payment and labor fees.

However, some opposed this practice: for common people, between silver and table salt, obviously the former was more attractive and easier to carry and use. The common people had tasted the sweetness of cash acquisition and wouldn't like such sudden forced barter trade.

"Open a salt shop." Dongmen Chuiyu suddenly had a whim, "Specialize in selling salt. He sells grain with his left hand and gets silver, and has to return it to us with his right hand. Hahaha, I'm really a profiteer—"

"That's a good idea. Using grain and table salt as equivalents is not the development direction after all. Now the salt production in the county is controlled by us; it is suitable for withdrawing currency from circulation." Cheng Dong nodded in agreement.

Dongmen Chuiyu struck while the iron was hot and hurriedly handed over a document: "This is the operation planning proposal of our commercial group for East Gate Market. Hope the Executive Committee approves it as soon as possible!"

"Planning proposal?" Several committee members were stunned. Although they set up a free market outside Bairen City, the purpose was only to promote commodity circulation and enhance feelings between transmigrators and local natives. Few people had thought carefully about how to manage the market. Everyone imagined this market as the free markets in many domestic cities: farmers and small vendors setting up stalls to sell goods, at most thinking of exempting stall fees.

"Correct, planning proposal." Dongmen took the opportunity to stand up, "Fellow committee members, let me introduce this overall planning proposal now. I believe that with this plan, under the correct leadership of the Executive Committee, under the guidance of President Wen, and with the strong support of Committee Member Cheng—"

"Cut the crap! We've arrived in the Great Ming and you're still playing this game!" Dugu Qiuhun was impatient.

"—Our East Gate Market will become the most prosperous commercial market in all of Lingao, no, all of Hainan!"

Dongmen Chuiyu had informally mixed in official circles anyway, so he didn't care about Qiuhun's complaint. After finishing the opening remarks, he hurriedly hung a newly drawn plan on the blackboard behind him. He got this only after running to the architectural engineering group, saying all good words, and giving a few packs of cigarettes.
