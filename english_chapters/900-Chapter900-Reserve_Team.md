# Chapter 900 - Reserve Team

Hu Qingbai thought to himself: You want to slide out of this! Xiao Zhaochuan was absolutely out of consideration; this was a rare professionally trained middle school chemistry teacher, much more important than a junior high math teacher. Jiang Youzhong could be considered; he wasn't a professionally trained teacher, just had teaching experience. Bai Yu was also okay, but Bai Yu was a "Learn Industry" teacher, frequently taking apprentices to various enterprises, very familiar with the field and knowing some mechanics. If dispatched for so long, Learn Industry work wouldn't be easy to carry out...

He went through Elder teachers one by one in his mind, comparing whose dispatch would have less impact on courses. Of course he couldn't reveal these thoughts. At least two Elders needed to be sent as camp teachers. One for Jeju Island, one for Taiwan Island. He mentally sorted regular Elder teachers back and forth several times. Still didn't set specific candidates.

At noon, Fangcaodi Elder teachers ate together. Fangcaodi was far from the Elder Canteen in Bairen City. Elder teachers sent Life Secretaries in turn to pick up ingredients daily, then let Life Secretaries cook in the school. Bai Yu's Life Secretary was originally a kitchen maid in a big household, with excellent cooking skills. After modern culinary reformation, Fangcaodi's small kitchen had always been her responsibility.

The food wasn't abundant, but cooked exquisitely and changed daily. But the group seemed to have little appetite. Hu Qingbai re-raised the dispatch matter at the dinner table; Elder teachers remained silent one by one. Elders working at Fangcaodi were mostly people who coveted comfort by nature, with little ambition for building merits. The Executive Committee and Senate paid special attention to education, investing heavily in Fangcaodi with complete facilities and good environment. Leaving this heavy comfort nest to ride sailing ships through stormy seas to live in sheds on Jeju Island and Taiwan naturally didn't elicit much enthusiasm.

After some mental battles, Jiang Youzhong was forced to agree to be a camp teacher—but he declared he wouldn't go to Taiwan, only to Jeju Island. Taiwan's malaria problem always made Elders pale at the mention.

Hu Qingbai wanted to continue mobilizing, but Ji Xin spoke: "Then I'll go to Taiwan."

Everyone knew this backbone of the Law Society had an eccentric personality—for example, he was one of the few who didn't want a Life Secretary. Besides participating in Fangcaodi teaching affairs and Law Society activities, he fiddled with his "Indigenous Rights Protection Association." This society was looked askance at since establishment. Plus he rarely spoke and had an indifferent expression, so some thought he had mental problems.

Hu Qingbai knew his mind was perfectly fine, just different pursuits. He immediately said many flattering words. And made quite a few promises to both as appeasement.

Zhu Mingxia stretched a long lazy waist, looking at the drill ground outside the window. Soldiers were playing on apparatuses on the drill ground—high bar, parallel bars, single-plank bridge, swinging bridge... various training apparatuses were surrounded by soldiers. Occasionally, bursts of cheering came due to someone's outstanding performance.

For Fubo Army soldiers burdened with combat, duty, and supporting agriculture/industry tasks, these training apparatuses were less training than sports entertainment.

Some were playing rugby matches on the newly completed rugby field—this sport, starting from Yanchang Village militia, had spread widely to every corner of Lingao. As a highly organized and confrontational game, it also spread widely in the army.

Ma'niao Fort was like a beehive: bugles, drums, commands, shouts, military songs... boiling from morning till night.

Zhu Mingxia knew that Elders outside Ma'niao Fort once made a huge uproar over attacking Dengzhou—some resolutely opposed, some supported to death, each with reasons. Finally it was decided to mix into the Dengzhou situation. Hainan's construction needed massive population; population diversity also facilitated rule.

After Operation Engine passed, the vigorous shipbuilding plan was put into implementation. The Army naturally could only continue to "endure." Fortunately, the Executive Committee promised in the military affairs conference that once Operation Engine was completed, the Army would be expanded by one infantry battalion and several support units.

"Don't know when we can have a new battalion." Zhu Mingxia sighed. As commander of the 4th Battalion, the only reserve of the whole army, he deeply felt the army's manpower shortage.

As the Army's strategic reserve, the 4th Battalion was almost run off its legs in the second half of last year. While other battalions scattered across Hainan for security warfare, his battalion, besides undertaking Lingao's own garrison taks, was constantly drafted to execute various missions: from rush-harvesting crops, being stevedores, road builders... having almost not a single day of leisure.

It wasn't until the Northern Qiongzhou security war ended and some battalions began returning to establishment that the 4th Battalion got a slight breather. The General Staff then promulgated the "Standardization Construction Outline," requiring the whole army to carry out regularization construction. After months of soliciting opinions, the new *Infantry Drill Manual* and *Training Outline* were issued, requiring training according to this new standard.

Zhu Mingxia was relatively satisfied with the new training outline. At least military training now had a standard.

This reminded him of when the New Army was just formed; it also went through fierce debate. The point of contention wasn't on whether to form it, but on how to train.

At that time regarding training, there was a debate between the so-called New Style Faction and Old Style Faction. The New Style Faction demanded training according to US Military or PLA training manuals; the Old Style Faction demanded training according to 19th-century army training systems. The former consisted mainly of past soldiers; the latter mainly of military enthusiasts.

Zhu Mingxia was originally Armed Police, by background belonging to the New Style Faction, but he opposed copying modern army training systems and manuals wholesale. The reason was simple: unit establishment, training system, command method, and even rank system were ultimately decided by the level of military equipment at the time. Without flintlock muskets, you couldn't do line infantry tactics; with repeating rifles, there was no need to keep line infantry tactics.

"We cannot train the New Army according to modern US or Celestial Dynasty army training manuals—absolutely not. We need to formulate training plans based on actual soldier sources and weaponry. I also oppose directly copying 19th-century European army training models. Any simple copying is unscientific. We must consider these indigenous people's physical conditions, cultural conditions, and our weaponry situation comprehensively to formulate rational training plans."

The Chief of General Staff then was Ma Qianzhu. He agreed with Zhu Mingxia's view. But required him to provide a detailed training plan.

Zhu Mingxia worked overtime, formulating a training plan based on his experience and ideas, referencing actual conditions of recruited soldiers.

In this plan, the daily 5km run Ma Qianzhu set was cut directly, changed to once every Friday for recruits in the first month; once every Monday and Friday in the second month; once every Monday, Wednesday, Friday in the third month. After assignment to units, three times a week. Within a week, Monday to Friday military training; Saturday and Sunday political education alongside cultural literacy.

This change drew great dissatisfaction from the New Style Faction. The New Style Faction was almost entirely PLA background, deeply influenced by it. They had a special fondness for foot marching and armed cross-country running. Daily 5km cross-country was the most basic soldier training item for them. Especially in the new time-space without mechanized transport, troop combat and maneuver relied either on boats or walking.

Zhu Mingxia insisted on his view. The reason was simple: compared to modern youths with relatively sufficient nutrition, indigenous soldiers were almost universally malnourished. Calcium deficiency was widespread. Lingao also lacked the ability to drastically improve the nutritional structure of soldiers' meals. So training shouldn't be excessive.

High-volume training required massive protein and calcium supplements. Fu Sansi couldn't deny this either; in the recruit camp, stress fractures were very common. Frequent high-volume exercise and running drained large amounts of calcium; without timely replenishment, fractures would result.

This system continued like this. Now that the training outline was formally compiled, these training methods he proposed in the past were formally incorporated into the training outline. His repeatedly proposed suggestion to formulate new food standards for soldiers also received a response.

In the past, the Senate's food standard for the Fubo Army was basically considered from calories. Supply was executed on the standard of full staple food and enough vegetables. Seafood, bean products, meat, and eggs were only supplied during "feast rewards." Later conditions improved slightly, but only allowed slightly improved meals one day a week. Overall protein and fat intake was severely insufficient; this helped little in improving soldier physique. Naturalized soldiers were all hardworking and enduring, but this didn't mean they should maintain a low supply level.

According to the new food standard, Fubo Army soldiers received more protein supply than before. Seafood became the main source of protein supply; additionally, bean product supply was drastically increased.

Fats/oils, originally only eaten during "feast rewards," now also had a clear daily supply standard. Of course the standard was still very low, and varieties of fat were diverse, even fish oil was listed as a supply item.

Looking at the new food supply standard, Zhu Mingxia sighed with emotion: "We're finally a bit richer too."

Over these few years, Zhu Mingxia watched the Fubo Army grow step by step. From attacking Baitu, to suppressing bandits in mountains, to the fierce battle of Maideng, the Fubo Army constantly exposed various problems. These Elder officers adjusted and adjusted again based on emerging problems, finally making it look like an army. Now the Fubo Army had a soul. Once an army had a soul, no matter how its designation changed or establishment altered, it would become an intangible asset passed down for generations.
