# Chapter 22 - Meeting Eating and Housing

Chapter 22 Meeting - Eating and Housing

The topic of "eating" was presided over by Wu Nanhai of the Agricultural Group.

"Comrades, eating is the top priority." Wu Nanhai stood on the stage, looking like an old farmer, "We go to the Ming Dynasty not to suffer, but to enjoy life. Therefore, we must ensure the supply of food."

"First of all, grain. We need to bring enough seeds. High-yield rice, wheat, corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes... all of them. Especially potatoes and sweet potatoes, they are high-yield artifacts, life-saving food in famine years."

"Secondly, meat. We want to develop the breeding industry. Pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks and geese... We want to build large-scale farms to ensure that everyone has meat to eat every day."

"Also, vegetables and fruits. We want to build vegetable bases and orchards to plant various seasonal vegetables and fruits. We want to achieve 'vegetable basket' freedom."

"Finally, fisheries. Lingao is close to the sea and has rich fishery resources. We want to develop ocean fishing and aquaculture to let seafood become a common dish on our table."

"In addition," Wu Nanhai added, "We also need to develop the food processing industry. Flour mills, oil presses, brewing factories, soy sauce factories... These are indispensable. We want to eat bread, drink soy milk, and use high-quality cooking oil and condiments."

"Don't forget tobacco, alcohol, sugar and tea!" Someone shouted below, "These are spiritual food!"

"Don't worry, we have them all." Wu Nanhai smiled, "We want to grow sugar cane to make sugar, grow tobacco to make cigarettes, grow tea to make tea, and brew beer and white spirits... We want to let the people of the Ming Dynasty taste the good things of modern times."

"Long live the Agricultural Group!" The foodies cheered.

After "eating" comes "housing". This topic was responsible by the Construction Group.

"Our goal is to let everyone live in spacious, bright and comfortable houses." The leader of the Construction Group, Mei Lin (an architect), said, "We won't live in thatched cottages or tiled houses, but in reinforced concrete buildings."

"We want to build a modern city. There are planned roads, water supply and drainage systems, parks and green spaces... There are electricity and tap water in the houses, and flushing toilets and showers."

"Wait, cement and steel?" Someone questioned, "Can we produce them?"

"Cement is simple," Mei Lin said, "Lingao has abundant limestone and clay resources. We can build small cement kilns. As for steel, the Industrial Group will solve it."

"What about bricks and tiles?"

"We can build brick and tile kilns. We can also make hollow bricks and aerated concrete blocks, which are light and thermal insulating."

"Also, glass." Mei Lin added, "We want to build a glass factory to produce flat glass. We want to let every window be bright and transparent."

"Sounds like a utopian city." Someone sighed.

"This is not a fantasy, but a blueprint." Mei Lin said firmly, "We have technology and drawings. As long as we have hands, we can turn the blueprint into reality."

"However," he changed the subject, "In the early stage, we may have to live in tents and simple houses for a while. Everyone should be mentally prepared."

"It's okay, we can endure hardship!" Everyone expressed their understanding. After all, Rome was not built in a day.

The meeting continued. The topics covered transportation, communications, finance, law... almost involving every aspect of building a country.

Everyone spoke enthusiastically and offered advice and suggestions. The atmosphere in the conference room was heated and harmonious.

Wen Desi sat on the rostrum, looking at this group of high-spirited people, a trace of relief flashed in his eyes.

He knew that this team had been formed. They had common goals and beliefs, and had the ability and determination to realize them.

They were the future masters of the new world.
