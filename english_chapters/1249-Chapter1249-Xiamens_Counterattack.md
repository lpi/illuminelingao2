# Chapter 1249 - Xiamen's Counterattack

The people gathered in front of the Dunren Pavilion instantly panicked. Wailing and howling ghosts filled the air; the solemn atmosphere of holding breath and waiting for orders vanished. Crowds desperate for survival stumbled and scattered, eager to escape this sudden death god.

Ying Yu began firing one shot after another at a fixed rhythm, landing a shell every 10 seconds. Dense shells rained down into the courtyard. With deafening explosions ringing out on the flagstone ground and roofs, plumes of flame and black smoke rushed to the clouds. Gravel, tiles, bricks, and broken wood flew everywhere. In moments, the courtyard was piled with corpses.

Ying Yu knew his gun couldn't be too precise; just covering the area centered on the Dunren Pavilion was enough. Moreover, as impacts increased, smoke and dust grew denser. Accurate positioning by the observer became difficult; continuing meant many stray rounds. But this was trivial now; after 20 HE shells, no one would be willing to stay in the Zheng residence.

He steadied himself. Waiting 20 seconds after the last HE shell was fired, he began firing shrapnel. He no longer calibrated targets but conducted fire for effect on the entire Zheng residence, striving to inflict massive casualties on fleeing personnel.

Black puffs of explosion smoke burst one after another in the sky, spraying iron balls toward the ground. People pushing and shoving, crowded in courtyards and corridors trying to flee, had their lives harvested by waves of "iron hail." A shell exploded at the courtyard gate, instantly mowing down 25 people like cutting grass.

Fleeing people didn't know what they had encountered. They subconsciously felt they couldn't stay here long, running crazily toward every exit of the residence. Mouths emitting meaningless mad screams and roars, pushing each other, trampling each other. Women, children, and the elderly were ruthlessly pushed down and trampled; many were trampled to death alive. Walkways and doorways were piled with corpses and groaning wounded.

Zheng Zhilong wasn't in the residence at this time. He had been in Xiamen these days: to set up an arms workshop on Gulangyu. The line connected by Zheng Zhifeng, with the other party's extravagant statements and several firearm samples provided, greatly piqued his interest—for over a year he felt painfully the gap in "technical level" between himself and the Australians. If he didn't have "strong ships and powerful guns," the maritime trade hegemony he diligently sought would be snatched away by the Australians.

This mysterious Kirishitan expressed willingness to establish a weapons workshop for them, manufacturing "new Red Barbarian Cannons" in no way inferior to the Dutch or Portuguese. Additionally, he could provide "cannons" the same as the Australians'. Of course, the latter were very expensive. But this brought great hope to Zheng Zhilong, who was feeling increasingly desperate.

If not for such urgency, he wouldn't have so easily agreed to Zheng Zhifeng's suggestion to cooperate with the Kirishitan Paul. For the "rearmament" plan being formulated, besides sending men to Macau to recruit "Black Barbarians" as mercenaries, he also sent men to Japan to recruit Japanese ronin he was more familiar with, and to purchase copper for casting cannons.

He was woken by his personal guards at the first wave of cannon sounds from Anping. But he didn't know what happened at Kinmen, only hearing rumbling cannons and seeing fire filling the sky. Obviously someone was attacking Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands.

Zheng Zhilong couldn't judge who the enemy was or the force of their arrival for a moment: it was dozens of *li* by sea to Kinmen Island; a small sailboat took almost half a day for a one-way trip. Even if Kinmen dispatched a messenger immediately, they wouldn't arrive at Gulangyu until noon.

He could only trust the general guarding Kinmen. Stationed at Kinmen was his brother Zheng Zhihu. Many biological brothers and clan brothers rose with Zheng Zhilong, but the bond with Zheng Zhihu was most unusual. Zheng Zhihu had followed him wandering in Macau, braved death with him as pirates in Japan; their feelings were deepest, and he was deeply trusted. Moreover, he was brave and decisive, with superhuman martial arts, establishing repeated war merits in battles sweeping the maritime heroes. At that time, there was the praise of "Long's wisdom, Hu's courage." So Zheng Zhilong placed this brother to guard Kinmen, guarding the key to Xiamen Bay and Weitou Bay for him.

At this moment he stood on Sunlight Rock on Gulangyu, gazing at the smoke and fire in the direction of Kinmen—whoever came, the opponent must have many men and ships. It must be a bitter battle over at Kinmen.

"Did Second Master Mang send a message?" He asked the guard beside him again. He had agreed with Zheng Zhihu that if there was urgent news and no time to send a ship, send a man by fast horse.

"Reporting to General, not yet."

Zheng Zhilong watched the gradually whitening sky. Smoke and fire grew larger; the sky near Kinmen Island was almost entirely shrouded in black smoke. He secretly felt bad; it looked like the battle on Zheng Zhihu's side wasn't going smoothly. Delay was not an option; he immediately ordered:

"Beat the drums and raise the standard immediately!" He waved his sleeve. "Prepare the boat, we return to Zhongzuosuo City!"

The cannon signaling a central army meeting sounded, followed by dense drumming and the woo-woo of horns. Zheng family generals who had been hesitant hurriedly armored up, flocking to the central army tent inside Zhongzuosuo City.

Half an hour later, the first batch of fire ships set sail under the cover of other warships—the commander was Zheng Lian stationed in Xiamen. Ships anchored in Xiamen turned out in full force. Except for a small number of useless small boats, half the fire ships were left behind—after all, using fire ships in the waters between Gulangyu and Xiamen Island was more advantageous than in Xiamen Bay. If Zheng Zhihu and the reinforcement fleet couldn't resist the enemy, the enemy would invade Xiamen with the momentum. As long as he had fire ships in hand, he still had a chance for a final fight.

At the same time, he sent two teams of personal guards, by sea and land respectively, whipping their horses to rush to Anping—Anping's defender was his clan cousin Zheng Zhiguan. Zheng Zhiguan had limited ability but was honest and steady. With Anping protected by the Kinmen islands, the defender didn't need great skill, just maturity and steadiness to maintain order in the city and the safety of the Zheng family.

However, if the enemy really pressed directly under Anping City, he had no bottom in his heart whether Zheng Zhiguan had the ability to hold the city and protect the safety of the Zheng family's old and young—especially his wife Lady Dong and son Fusong brought from Japan, who were now in the city. Although he felt Zheng Zhihu might not be defeated at Kinmen—even if Kinmen were truly captured by the enemy, the opponent might not dare to penetrate deep into the hydrology and geography of the unfamiliar Shijing River, putting up a formation to besiege the heavily guarded Anping City. However, a gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall; it was more appropriate to temporarily transfer family members to Jinjiang County City.

At this time, Zheng Lian was on his flagship. This flagship wasn't a three-masted gunship, but a large three-masted ship bought heavily from the Portuguese recently—an old Portuguese merchant ship with 24 bronze cannons, the largest firing 24-pound balls. To operate this Folangji ship, many foreign sailors were specially recruited from Macau and Manila. It was currently the ship with the strongest comprehensive combat power in the Zheng fleet. Zheng Zhilong handing this ship to him as flagship showed he valued him highly. Zheng Lian also hoped to perform well in this critical juncture.

Zheng Lian and his brother Zheng Cai were not from Zheng Zhilong's Shijing Zheng clan, but the Gaopu Zheng clan. Not generally considered Zheng Zhilong's clan cousins or the Zheng family's adopted sons. The brothers joined Zheng Zhilong early on and quickly became backbone subordinates. Zheng Cai became a guerilla general stationed on Xiamen Island in 1640, only one or two ranks lower than Zheng Zhilong. Zheng Cai was stationed in Xiamen for a long time, managing foreign trade at the mouth of the Jiulong River. Before Zheng Zhilong surrendered to the Qing, the brothers formed a powerful faction within the Zheng family. After Zheng Zhilong was taken to Beijing, Zheng Cai controlled the main foreign trade of the Zheng group, once enough to contend with Zheng Chenggong for the position of head of the Zheng group. Zheng Chenggong directing the spearhead at the Zheng Cai and Zheng Lian brothers in Xiamen first to reorganize was not unreasonable.

The main force led by Zheng Lian consisted of three three-masted gunships and two European-style sailing ships, plus dozens of Fujian and Guangdong ships. Over a hundred fire ships filled with dry wood sailed in a group on the other side. Every ship was equipped with iron hooks and chains to ensure the fire ship could connect tightly to the target ship.

With the wind in their favor, Zheng Lian led the fleet with full sails toward Kinmen.

Although Zheng Lian was unclear about the battlefield situation, he understood a bitter fight lay ahead. The only ones daring to intrude into Weitou Bay were the Dutch, Old Liu Xiang, and the Australians. The Dutch and Old Liu Xiang had always colluded; recently when Old Liu Xiang attacked Min'an, sailing ships commonly used by the Dutch appeared in his fleet.

However, Old Liu Xiang suffered a defeat at Min'an recently with heavy losses; he absolutely couldn't make a comeback so quickly. If it were the Dutch, their factor's ship in Xiamen had shown no abnormalities—nine out of ten, the sudden attack on Kinmen was the Australians.

Thinking of the Australians, Zheng Lian couldn't help feeling nervous secretly. Hearing that Australian ships were sturdy and guns sharp, extremely formidable; even the leader himself dared not confront them head-on. If they were raiding, he had to be extremely careful.

While Zheng's reinforcement fleet was sailing with the wind, the First Squadron's five steam warships were also sailing toward Xiamen at 8 knots. Because the First Squadron was fast, transport ships and motorboats carrying landing troops couldn't keep up with the battle squadron. So the landing troops: four infantry companies and attached small artillery were loaded onto the five ships for short-distance transport. Shohatsu landing craft were also stowed on deck.

By 19th-century standards, the First Squadron entered battle with Zheng Lian in an extremely dangerous state: decks packed with soldiers and ammo below, small boats lashed on deck above. If hit by an enemy shell, it would be enough to cause severe casualties and damage. But their advantage in firepower and mobility allowed the Senator officers to disregard this—as long as efficiency was maximized.
