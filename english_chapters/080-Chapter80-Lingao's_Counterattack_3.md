# Chapter 80 - Lingao's Counterattack (3) Revised

"I'm out of bullets!"

"Bullets, where are the bullets!"

Before the battle, everyone was issued 90 rounds of bullets. The SKS-D rifle uses AK's 30-round magazines. Everyone was confident that with such equipment, even if the Manchu Iron Cavalry charged the formation, they could be beaten to smithereens—the words were correct, but obviously not in the hands of these people. Seeing that the enemy did not fall and finish as soon as the gun rang like in games and movies, then collapse in defeat, but gritted their teeth and pounced fiercely with wild shouts, many people immediately panicked. Some forgot to grab magazines, others groped for magazines on their bodies, unable to pull out the perfectly good magazines no matter what.

"Don't be chaotic, everyone, steady!" He Ming ran along the earthen rampart shouting. He knew deeply that the military training of these people was not even comparable to recruits, nor had they fought a war with real swords and guns. It was inevitable to be temporarily confused, so he ran back and forth desperately to maintain morale.

Taking advantage of this gap in firepower, the militia had pushed many handcarts piled with sandbags and earth bags to the foot of the earthen rampart. Archers and crossbowmen, relying on the cover of handcarts, fired arrows randomly. Someone was hit by an arrow and fell to the ground howling. He Ma, leading the medical team, just wanted to go over to rescue, but was shoved hard by someone, then felt a pain on his head, only to find a guy threw a rifle on his head and ran towards the back soul-lost.

"Come back! You coward!" He Ma roared. Fortunately, there was a steel helmet on his head, otherwise wouldn't this eight and a half jin smash open his head?

Just as he was roaring, suddenly a puff of white smoke erupted fiercely outside the barbed wire, cannon sound roared. He Ma subconsciously lowered his head, only hearing the steel helmet on his head clanking, and his body was also hit by some things, painfully. looking up, a person had already fallen from the earthen rampart in front of him, face full of blood, very terrifying. Upon dragging, he found he was still moaning, knowing there was still hope.

The volley of two crouching tiger cannons pulled to the front of the earthen rampart overwhelmed the defenders who were already flustered. Although the range and power of this cannon were very limited, firing simultaneously at this place less than fifty steps away, even stones and broken iron had enough lethality. quite a few people were injured and fell to the ground immediately. None of the transmigrators facing the battlefield of real swords and guns for the first time showed the aura of a king, charging up calmly to chop people with a raise of the hand. The roar of two small iron cannons firing stones and broken iron became the last straw that crushed their fragile hearts. Seeing people around them screaming on the ground with faces covered in blood, someone finally couldn't hold on, screamed, and fled rolling and crawling. He Ming was so angry that he really wanted to take out his pistol and shoot a few on the spot. If there was a platoon of PLA right now—he thought, even using Arisaka Type 38 rifles, they could defeat this group of scantily clad militia within a minute—they underestimated the opponent's fighting will too much, and overestimated the psychological endurance of modern people too much.

"Shoot, shoot!" He Ming helped a person who was having trouble with his magazine pull out the magazine and install it for him, "Keep firing for me!"

Some of the most decisive militia had already climbed onto the earthen rampart. He Ming gathered seven or eight people from the Military Team and fired continuously in concentrated fire. The 30-round magazine of SKS-D gave them a great advantage. Hot rifle shell casings fell all over the ground. The militia gathered outside the breach fell in patches instantly, and the rest fled down.

This small counterattack stabilized the battle line. Bullets coming from all sides began to become dense. Taking advantage of this moment, he and other military team members went back and forth to encourage, calming down the emotions of the defenders who were originally a bit panicked. Li Jun kicked and beat those guys who fled back up from behind. The medical team hurriedly dragged all the injured people on the ground into the house to avoid the scene of blood flowing affecting morale.

"Don't panic everyone, pay attention not to expose your heads too much, don't stop shooting, the enemy can't come up..." He Ming walked along the earthen rampart, shouting.

Huang Shoutong wanted to insist on attacking one more time. The militia he brought had already surged to the foot of the earthen rampart, but now they were all caught in the crossfire between several camps. People kept falling, and the militia suffered heavy casualties. Shooting came from all directions. Obviously, the pirates' firearms shot farther than any kind of Great Ming, and they would occasionally suffer shots from high places with great power. Many people had their skulls disappear after a gunshot.

The gunners suffered concentrated shooting and were all killed in an instant. The archers and crossbowmen who intended to support the climbing of the rampart were killed before they had a chance to shoot arrows. The smart ones hid under the carts piled with sandbags and earth baskets. Dense bullets sprinkled on the militia like pouring rain. The militia only persisted under the earthen rampart for a moment before scattering under the rain of bullets. They failed to accurately estimate the range of SKS rifles from beginning to end, so many people were knocked to the ground on the way turning back to run.

He Ming saw the militia starting to flee and hurriedly ordered a cease-fire with the walkie-talkie. Even so, the messy gunshots took a good while to stop.

"Why cease fire?" A person ran over carrying an SKS, "Just getting into the groove of fighting!"

He Ming looked and saw that this guy was exactly the one who threw away his rifle and fled just now, and was dragged back by Li Jun behind. Seeing his excitement with heaving nose wings and glowing face at this moment, then associating with his soul-lost appearance just now, he couldn't help shaking his head.

"We want captives, not dead people." He turned to call the mobile team, asking them to go out and intercept the fleeing militia.

The appearance of agricultural vehicles made the remaining militia pale with fright. Originally, they brought bottles filled with gunpowder and oil, sprinkled with a lot of chicken blood, in preparation for possibly fighting "demon vehicles". But at this moment, who would think of these? They just ran for their lives. Unfortunately, how can people compete with four-wheel drive agricultural vehicles in speed on the river beach flat land? Soon, after the agricultural vehicles outflanked and surrounded them, and shot down several militia in succession, most people huddled together on the river beach. Xiong Buyou shouted repeatedly "Surrender and avoid death", and most people knelt and surrendered. Only a few who ran fast or were good swimmers escaped.

The rout was so rapid that even the black smoke for retreat couldn't be released in time. He Ming left some people to clean up the battlefield and dispatched eight agricultural vehicles, taking more than fifty people to cut off the retreat of the enemy at Bopu.

The attack on Bopu started at noon. Because warnings were received long ago, the logging teams and labor groups collecting agar and oysters in the surroundings had already retreated into the camp. Fu BoWen ordered the strong laborers to wave flags on one hand, and fired the three-eyed guns he brought non-stop on the other, plus beating gongs and drums desperately, creating an extremely huge momentum. Just as he was commanding everything on a hillside he thought was safe enough, a retinue beside him suddenly had a hole opened in his chest and fell. This scared him into turning around and leaving. Seeing the master suddenly ran away, the strong laborers also threw down various guys in their hands and fled in all directions. Therefore, they ran even earlier than Huang Shoutong's militia. Of course, that retreat signal wasn't sent either.

However, whether sent or not, it made no difference at this moment. The left and right route troops planned by Liu Dalin and Huang Shoutong had now all scattered. If anyone was smarter, then Fu BoWen's timely escape at least saved most of the strong laborers of the right route army, saving them from being captured—He Ming's arrest mobile team only caught some old and weak ones.

After the battle, Bairen Beach was filled with a bloody smell. From the foot of the earthen rampart in the Administrative Zone to the edge of the trench, many corpses fell. The otakus who experienced a "fierce battle" dragged their rifles, all feeling a bit dumbfounded. Killed people themselves? Seemed a bit unbelievable, but the corpses all over the ground clearly told of their deeds. Some were vomiting, some were weeping covering their faces, and some were laughing madly inexplicably...

It seems that the issue of psychological intervention for transmigrators must also be put on the agenda. Xiao Zishan thought, walking all the way towards the Administrative Zone. He watched the battle at the vehicle and material yard today—these days, the transmigrators began to implement an emergency system where there were several executive committee members in any camp, instead of everyone gathering together, to avoid being taken out in one pot.

On the battlefield, people from the Military Team held SKS rifles with bayonets fixed, vigilantly turning over every corpse. If there was still movement or signs of life, the medical team would carry them aside. Unless they were lightly wounded, they would not receive immediate treatment. Only those who could survive enough time would be treated by the medical team. Besides, many transmigrators were injured in this battle.

"Any casualties?" Seeing Shi Niaoren was also there, Xiao Zishan asked.

"No deaths so far, but quite a few injured." Shi Niaoren said, "Most were injured by crouching tiger cannons, many injured in the face and limbs."

"Oh?"

"Everyone has stab-resistant clothing on the body and steel helmets on the head. What use is this small iron cannon?" Shi Niaoren pointed contemptuously with his chin at the gun carriage fallen under the earthen rampart. Two short and ugly small iron cannons were overturned on the ground. The rough iron quality and ugly shape made it hard for people to associate it with the word artillery.

"Preliminary look, quite lucky, no eyes injured. The most seriously injured one was hit by an arrow, on the arm," Shi Niaoren gestured, "His arm won't be able to exert much force in the future."

Xiao Zishan was silent: This is better than being disabled. But it was inconvenient for him to say this.

The casualty report came out quickly:

A total of twenty-one transmigrators were injured, including a burn injury from rashly pinching the SKS rifle barrel.

In comparison, the attacking militia left more than one hundred corpses on the battlefields of the two places alone, and abandoned more than thirty wounded. These wounded had serious injuries and most would die within a day or two. More than one hundred and thirty people were captured, currently detained on the river beach, looking dispirited.

Quite a few things were captured. Besides many knives, guns, bows and crossbows, there were two crouching tiger cannons, gongs, drums, flags, rough handcarts, and even several carts of gunpowder and broken iron acting as cannonballs. These things were counted and stored by the Planning Committee personnel. Weapons could be used to arm native troops in the future, or melted down at worst. Cannons and broken iron were useless, so gave them to the future Steel Team as raw materials. Handcarts were very useful and could be used on the construction site. As for that gunpowder, although the Chemistry Team expressed contempt after seeing it, it was still stored.

The biggest gain for the transmigrators was capturing three horses. Hainan itself does not produce horses; they were all introduced from the southwest. These horses were not big. They might not work as cavalry horses, but serving as animal power was no problem. There were also five or six dead horses, all handed over to the Agriculture Team for disposal.
