# Chapter 1471 - A Dangerous Signal

Jiang Shan frowned, looking at the *Lingao Times* before him. This publicly circulated newspaper was the Senate's mouthpiece. Its news often represented the Senate's latest developments, policies, and future trends. Not only did keen-nosed naturalized citizens and natives read it carefully, but even transmigrators who could read the internally circulated *Weekly Bulletin* and *Venus* would subscribe to a copy specifically to divine the policy directions of the Senate and Executive Committee.

There was a short article on the third page of this newspaper, and it was this article that made Jiang Shan frown.

Judging solely by the article's title, "Housing Security in Lingao County Sees Initial Results," this was just common official jargon from the Propaganda Department praising the new society and new life, nothing more than singing praises for the General Construction Company and the Planning Academy to make naturalized citizens grateful to the Senate. But Jiang Shan read a trace of something unpleasant in this article.

The article reviewed the history of residential construction in Lingao, listed construction projects for naturalized citizen housing, square meters started and completed... listing a mass of achievements of the General Company. From this content alone, there was nothing inappropriate. But in the latter half of the article, it mentioned the terraced housing project allocated to high-ranking surrendered pirates in the early years and the Transmigrator Residential District project. Not only did it calculate the per capita square meterage of the two projects, but it also used an "extra feature" reportage style to write about the housing of naturalized workers, a navy officer of "shopkeeper" background from the surrendered pirates, and a transmigrator.

Although between the lines there was a context of "vigorously upward" and "happy life" unique to the Propaganda Department, Jiang Shan read the flavor within.

Naturalized workers were one thing, but that navy officer of shopkeeper background from Zhu Cailao's subordinates lived in a spacious three-bedroom, two-living-room terraced house, living harmoniously with his three wives and concubines. By contrast, the mentioned Transmigrator Cheng Mo lived in a one-and-a-half-room small unit, because the small room was used as Transmigrator Cheng's study cum workshop. The maidservant slept in the living room.

From the standpoint of intent, no one could say this article had problems: a transmigrator's housing wasn't even as spacious as a naturalized officer's—on the same level as a naturalized worker—which exactly illustrated the spirit of transmigrators not coveting wealth and rank, not being particular about life enjoyments, and serving the people with hard work and simplicity. How glorious and correct.

But Jiang Shan knew that the same article intent meant something else entirely to transmigrators: Transmigrators lived worse than naturalized officers! A naturalized citizen had three concubines, each with her own room, while the transmigrator's only secretary had to sleep on a cot in the living room!

*There are venomous fangs in this article.* He thought secretly. Clearly, the article was using the housing construction issue to imply that the Executive Committee paid insufficient attention to transmigrators' lives—even less than those early surrendered pirate "shopkeepers."

If such an article appeared ordinarily, Jiang Shan might have thought he was being oversensitive. But recently, the Administrative Office was issuing documents soliciting opinions on "Maidservant School Reform," "Determination of Maidservant Legal Status and Inheritance System" within a small scope.

Jiang Shan clearly remembered that the consultation document on maidservant school reform mentioned a large number of maidservants accumulating in the school due to slow sales—"Transmigrator demand for maidservants is weak."

Weak demand was a fact; Jiang Shan himself had no interest in buying a second maidservant yet, though he knew the current maidservants were much better than before. But after such an article was published, transmigrators who read it would easily form the association: "The reason there's no demand is because the allocated housing is too small."

He looked at the article's author, an unfamiliar name: "Zi Su" (Perilla). But the seasoned use of vernacular Chinese and journalistic writing techniques all indicated this came from a transmigrator's hand. Nine out of ten it was either Panpan or Cheng Yongxin. Panpan was a foreign girl; though her Chinese writing ability wasn't bad, Jiang Shan was familiar with the style of her reports—this must have been written by Cheng Yongxin.

Combined with several articles recently published by Shan Liang and others on the internal BBS involving maidservants and transmigrator housing issues, he completely understood what Cheng Yongxin intended.

"You really fear the world isn't chaotic enough," he muttered.

Since the Lin Xiaoya case, Jiang Shan had been "gently watching" Cheng Yongxin's activities. Although they still had weekly dates, the two never mentioned Senate hot-button issues, seeming to deliberately avoid them.

But this avoidance didn't mean Jiang Shan tacitly approved of her activities. Up to now, he basically knew the threads of Cheng Yongxin's activities. Until seeing this newspaper, Jiang Shan considered it within acceptable limits.

But today's report was a signal. If her past activities were merely pulling some small schemes, today's report declared she had begun a formal offensive—not babbling about women's rights, democracy, or whatever, but striving to control the position of public opinion.

She wanted to start by writing for *Lingao Times*, the most mass-market and highly authoritative outlet, to seize discourse power step by step.

---

Jiang Shan knew very well that despite *Lingao Times* having no classification level and being publicly distributed, seeming unimportant, its function and status were actually the highest among Senate media. Cheng Yongxin starting with this newspaper was obviously well-considered.

The PHS phone in the drawer suddenly rang. It was Wu Mu calling.

"This is Jiang Shan—yes, I've seen it—yes, there's meaning behind the words—you see it that way too? Indeed the flavor is a bit off—haha," Jiang Shan laughed. "I knew you guys knew everything. True, she and I are sort of partners in life, but not the like-minded kind. Right, work is work, personal life is personal life. I've always been clear on public versus private, putting Senate interests first—okay, I understand."

Jiang Shan put down the phone and exhaled a breath of stale air. He picked up the phone: "Please ask Section Chief Wang to come to my office."

Just as Jiang Shan thought, once the article in *Lingao Times* came out, "Maidservant Rights," "Marriage Law," "Inheritance System," and "Housing" instantly became sensitive words in the Senate like "democracy and freedom" in the old world. Not only were they visible everywhere on the BBS, but transmigrators were also discoursing loudly in the Farm Teahouse, the Cooperative Restaurant, and even the Industrial Zone Transmigrator Canteen. And ever since Cheng Yongxin leaked the possible school abolition to the maidservant circle via Sun Shangxiang, even transmigrators with zero connection to the Grand Library faction or the Legal Club were discussing this major matter concerning their pillow-partners' rights.

As undercurrents surged in the Senate with these words and various figures calculated their moves, the man who almost always sat in the office of the First Deputy Director of the Political Security Bureau slowly strolled to appear outside Xiao Zishan's office.

"Zishan, your days recently haven't been easy, huh? Many comrades are watching the dish to place their chopsticks."

"Hehe, nothing gets past your nose. Director Xiong, you never visit without a reason. heard your Little Wu has been lucky in love recently, winning the favor of the aloof Miss Carnation. Truly impressive."

 Pot-bellied Zhao Manxiong-ski sniffed vigilantly: "Carnation, looks elegant, but actually full of thorns inside. Moreover, that Carnation is a fake. Knowing she's a substitute yet acting quite open, plotting some 'worrying about the country and people' matters—she has quite the style of women in Eileen Chang's writings. Pity our Little Wu doesn't understand romance, haha."

"Comrade Little Wu's theoretical comprehension ability is still a bit lacking; he lacks understanding of the Great Leader's allusion about eating the sugar coating and firing the shell back," Xiao Zishan smiled.

"Leaving that aside, the Flower Girl has after all poked out your hidden intention to dispose of the maidservant school based on rumors. This matter isn't huge, but not small either, yet the water underneath is inevitably too muddy. If handled poorly and muddied by others, I fear it won't just raise a storm in the maidservant school; transmigrators will hardly remain unaffected either. Allocated maidservants, whether the Executive Committee acknowledges their status or not, have already become an indispensable part of transmigrators' lives. And the maidservant school is their window to the new world. The pillow talk stirred up by abolition is enough to form a massive storm in the Senate."

"Abolition—we didn't say that," Xiao Zishan picked up his signature large tea mug, drank a mouthful of authentic West Lake Longjing like a cow, and touched his somewhat thinning forehead. "We're just discussing transformation, transformation."

Director Xiong took off his glasses and wiped them, pretending not to see Xiao Zishan's scenery-spoiling drinking style: "Brother Zishan, you and I are both people with experience. Transformation is easy to say, hard to do. All those state-owned enterprises back then—said they were transforming, what was the result? Waists snapped from turning but didn't turn around; money, grain, and equipment all went into private pockets. Maphead led the CCCP to transform so happily back then—transformed Big Brother into heaven, Second Brother into birth, and the result was twenty years without catching breath."

"Old Xiong, looks like you came prepared. Let's exchange ideas." Although Xiao Zishan's qi-cultivation skills had achieved some success over these years, Director Xiong was no ordinary person after all. His ideas still piqued Xiao Zishan's interest.

"Ideas, I have none," Zhao Manxiong spread his hands. "But I thought of a person, someone fairly matched with Miss Flower, perhaps someone who can break the deadlock. It just depends on whether you dare to use him."

"Dare to use?" Xiao Zishan immediately sat up straighter. Experienced Old Xiong asking if he dared use someone from his pocket—definitely not a naturalized citizen, so it must be a transmigrator. As the Senate's chief steward, he knew all the transmigrators. Even if not familiar, he could at least name them. Yet there was one he might not dare use—who was this?

"Brother Zishan, this person, I estimate you know him too. I came late, but reportedly he put in some effort during the transmigration back then. Pity he's a schizo. After transmigrating, he caused some trouble, not big but not small, and was restricted in movement. The Black Four—do you still remember?"
