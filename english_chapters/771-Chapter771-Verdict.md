# Chapter 771 – Verdict

After Ji Xin concluded his statement, Xu Ke announced the end of the trial session. Then, Xu Ke spent an hour explaining the relevant points of law. This explanation had been drafted by the Law Society over several nights, aiming to be as accessible as possible. He explained the facts of the case and the applicable statutes. For the Tribunal, using modern judicial procedures for the first time, interpreting the law and the proceedings for the public was absolutely necessary.

Unexpectedly, the audience found the legal explanation far from boring; instead, they were fascinated. After witnessing the trial procedure, many wanted to understand *why* the Australians did things this way. Xu Ke’s explanation satisfied their curiosity. Although most only half-understood, they gained at least a preliminary grasp of the modern judicial system.

After completing the explanation, the clerk announced: "All rise!"

"The verdict will now be announced!"

Xu Ke stood, raised his gavel, and struck it once:

"The defendant is found guilty of 'destroying a military marriage'!"

A collective gasp and murmur rose from the gallery.

"In the name of the House of Elders and the People: the defendant is sentenced to seven years of hard labor and one year of supervision!" Xu Ke announced.

"Supervision" meant that after release, the convict had to wear specific markings on their clothing to be monitored at all times. Not only were they restricted in many ways, but the markings were also deeply humiliating.

The gallery erupted in discussion—the severity of the sentence shocked everyone. In Ming judicial practice, prison terms were rare. For a case involving adultery, custom dictated a few dozen strokes for the adulterer and a few dozen for the adulteress in the name of "correcting morals." If they were paraded in cangues, the public would have been delighted. No one expected the Australians to invent "destruction of a military marriage" and impose such a heavy penalty.

Everyone knew what Australian "hard labor" meant—it meant falling into the hands of Fu Youdi. That place was a byword for terror in Lingao; people doubted whether the unlucky "adulterer" would ever come back alive from the labor camp.

That messing around with a soldier's wife could lead to such an end baffled everyone. The Australians truly thought differently. In the 17th century, soldiering was a profession for "scum" despised by Chinese and foreigners alike. No one thought a soldier's wife getting screwed was a major issue.

With another strike of Xu Ke's gavel, the first trial conducted under the new procedural law concluded. Everyone stood as the judge left first. Then, guided by police, the crowd slowly dispersed. In the emptying gallery, two people remained seated until the crowd was mostly gone, leaving only rows of empty benches. Then they stood. The leader was a middle-aged man dressed with opulent dignity, clearly a person of status from the Great Ming. Accompanying him was a young man. Together they walked slowly toward the exit, the young man occasionally moving aside benches left in the aisle.

As they reached the door, several men in short jackets immediately approached and escorted them to a carriage waiting nearby.

Li Luoyou closed his eyes to rest for a moment. Gu Baocheng opened a beverage case in the carriage, took out a small thermos, poured him a cup of tea, and handed it to him.

Li Luoyou took a sip. It was excellent Wuyi tea from Fujian. He hadn't visited for a few months, and the Australians' amenities had improved even further—in the past, they offered hot water, but the tea leaves had been coarse and low-quality.

The carriage shuddered slightly and began to move slowly. The Mongolian horse wasn't strong or fast, but it had a smooth gait. On Lingao's leveled roads, the ride was steady. After two cups of tea, Li Luoyou caught his breath. Sitting on a hard wooden bench for over two hours had been tyring, not to mention the crowded room. If the weather hadn't been mild and the ventilation good, he might not have lasted.

Attending the trial at East Gate Market had been Gu Baocheng's suggestion. The scandal had become a hot topic in Lingao's streets thanks to the Propaganda Department's heavy promotion, and news had naturally reached *Qionghai House*, Li Luoyou’s residence in Lingao. Li Luoyou had taken a keen interest in Lingao's justice system on his last visit. Hearing that a case was to be publicly tried under "Australian-Song Law," his interest spiked, and he instructed Gu Baocheng to collect all relevant newspaper materials for him to read.

Li Luoyou had arrived from Macau over ten days ago, charged with the mission of rescuing the remnants of He Rubin's forces. Because the House of Elders needed to meet and discuss how to handle the Ming troops trapped in Qiongshan, Li Luoyou could only wait in boredom at *Qionghai House*. Sometimes Liu San or other elders he knew came to chat, but mostly he killed time reading Lingao newspapers and books collected by Gu Baocheng.

Gu Baocheng had been in Lingao for some time and understood the Australians' way of doing things—they would reveal or hint at many things in the newspapers. Reading the *Lingao Times* and locally printed books was the best window into their thinking.

Li Luoyou was interested in his nephew's view—of course, this wasn't profound insight, just as he regularly read the *Capital Gazette*, which revealed many of the Imperial Court's movements.

But the *Lingao Times* was far broader in content and livelier in form. Many formats were new to him. For instance, regarding this destruction-of-military-marriage case, the paper not only reported the cause and effect but also provided "background introductions" to "Australian-Song Law," specifically long articles on the concept and practice of "destroying military marriages." Li Luoyou read the articles carefully and soon realized the Australians intended to implement "Australian-Song Law" in Lingao. He was shocked.

Promulgating new laws was a key characteristic of a new dynasty. Openly discussing Australian-Song Law in the papers was a clear preparation to raise their flag and secede. Li Luoyou felt a wave of desolation—it seemed Qiongzhou Prefecture often would soon be lost to the Great Ming! Strangely, he felt quite calm about this reality, without the grief and indignation he had felt upon hearing of the fall of Shenyang. At least these people claimed to be descendants of Huaxia, did not treat the people like slaves or pigs, and had done many practical things to benefit the locals. The common people lived far better under Australian-Song rule than under the Manchus—even better than under the Great Ming, which showed its people no mercy. Officials cared only for their own wealth and rank, indifferent to the people's lives or the nation's territory.

Now, the officials ruling the Great Ming had sent him here simply to reach an agreement that would cover up the disastrous defeat of a war they had rashly provoked. Whenever Li Luoyou thought of this, he despaired for the Court. He heard the Emperor was diligent and sought to restore the Ming, but with such men as officials, even the founding Emperor Taizu reborn could hardly achieve anything.

Seeing his uncle's intense interest in the case, Gu Baocheng suggested observing the trial. Li Luoyou had long held a strong interest in the Australian judicial system—during his last tour of East Gate Market, he had noticed similarities between Australian justice and laws and those of the Europeans. But his stay had been too short to see a trial. Now, with such a significant case, he couldn't miss the opportunity.

Li Luoyou wanting to see the trial was naturally a special case—he played a crucial role in the Planning Commission's upcoming plans. On instructions from the General Office, Ma Jia immediately pulled two "reserved tickets" for them.

The entire trial process felt both surprising and logical to him—he realized his past assessment was correct: the Australian legal system was deeply influenced by European legal systems, including the form of interrogation. However, they had innovated upon the European system. For example, this "destruction of military marriage"—unheard of deeply. He felt even European laws wouldn't contain such a strange statutes.

"The Australians are buying the soldiers' hearts. I fear their future ambitions are not small," Gu Baocheng whispered in the carriage.

"If they couldn't buy hearts, how could they have wiped out Commander He's entire army? Do you think it was just 'sharp firearms'?" Li Luoyou said. "If we speak of sharp firearms, aren't the firearms of the Guanning Army and the capital battalions sharp? Yet they are beaten by the Manchus until they dare not step out of the city gates, hiding inside while watching the enemy kill and burn!"

Gu Baocheng knew his uncle referred to the Manchu incursion—news from the north was grim; the Manchus had plundered dozens of prefectures, taken countless riches, and abducted over a hundred thousand people.

In Gu Baocheng's view, the Australians surpassed the government not only in firearms and winning hearts but in many other aspects. But he dared not argue, only chiming in, "Uncle is right."

The carriage arrived at *Qionghai House*. This establishment occupied a fair amount of land, but the building's footprint was modest, and the frontage wasn't ostentatious. Unlike other merchants who tried to make their storefronts as grand as possible, *Qionghai House* had a plain, traditional facade, three bays wide, styled like an old, established firm.

*Qionghai House* did some retail business at the front, selling various mainland specialties. But this wasn't its main business—its core was bulk trade. *Qionghai House* imported bulk goods needed by the Australians from the mainland, especially Liaodong goods and items from beyond the Great Wall, particularly furs and hides. Horse, deer, and sheep hides were materials urgently needed by Lingao's industrial system. Additionally, it shipped and sold industrial raw materials like raw lacquer, tung oil, and silk from Guangdong and other regions.
