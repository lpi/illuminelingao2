# Chapter 104 - Mass Work

Zhang Xingjiao had returned; he was only gone for three or four days. This happened to do Xi Yazhou a favor: Xiong Buyou, the otaku from the cartoon company, was now a hot commodity. As the only translator of Lingao dialect, he was needed everywhere for communication, and some people even wanted him to start a Lingao dialect training class—Xiong Buyou never dreamed that a minor dialect from another time and space would bring him such great achievement today—it would be unreasonable to forcefully transfer him now. Zhang Xingjiao, a translation talent cultivated by the transmigrators themselves, came back just in time.

When he returned, he brought a mother and daughter pair. Wu Nanhai was startled when he saw them, thinking for a moment that he saw two living corpses. The mother's age couldn't be determined; she was sallow and emaciated, hunching her body, leaning on a stick with one hand and pulling her daughter with the other. The little girl's hair was completely yellow, and because she was very thin, her eyes appeared very large, looking just like a hungry stray cat. The things on their bodies that resembled clothes were already dirty and torn beyond recognition, merely hanging in tatters.

Perhaps feeling that bringing these two people back was useless to Master Wu, Zhang Xingjiao said apologetically that the mother and daughter had been starving for too long, so they looked a bit scary, wondering if the master still wanted to take them in?

Wu Nanhai sucked in a breath of cold air. Damn, this is too scary. He originally thought it would be at most a bit of malnutrition, just needing a few full meals—he initially had some romantic thoughts, thinking he could take this opportunity to raise a loli—who knew he would get two Ethiopian famine victims.

The two were so hungry that they didn't even have the strength to beg, just standing there with their heads bowed silently. Wu Nanhai was moved with compassion: let's take them in.

Zhang Xingjiao appeared very happy. After all, he brought the people. If they were driven back, given the state of this mother and daughter, nine out of ten they would die on the road, which would damage his hidden merit. It was best that Wu Nanhai was willing to take them in. The mother and daughter, probably numbed by the hard life, had no reaction at all until Zhang Xingjiao went over to remind them, then they barely crawled on the ground to kowtow in thanks. Wu Nanhai noticed tears flowing from the woman's eyes, seeming both grateful and extremely humiliated.

At this moment, He Ma was coming to ask Wu Nanhai for personnel, to transfer Zhang Xingjiao to the salt field work team. Wu Nanhai took the opportunity to let him take these two people to the health center for "purification"—this was the standard procedure for accepting local indigenous people, including haircutting, bathing, deworming, and treating skin diseases.

"But you have to send a nurse to do this," Wu Nanhai instructed, "Women in this era are very feudal. If big men from your place strip them naked to treat skin diseases, the woman will definitely commit suicide."

"Got it." He Ma smiled helplessly, "Do you think we like doing 'purification'? Being a doctor is bitter—" Saying this, he winked: "Nanhai, you are formidable! You got the jump on raising a loli!"

"This loli is too miserable." He recalled the girl's appearance in his mind; vaguely, she seemed quite good-looking, but right now he didn't even know how old she was. He remembered something: "Shave all the hair?"

"Of course, otherwise it can't be cleaned. Besides, scalp sores are very common among people here; it's hard to treat without shaving."

"You guys really have it tough."

"Yeah. By the way, leave that mother for our health group, okay? Train her to be a nurse. We are short of hands; the girls who came together refuse to be nurses, claiming it's dirty."

"Not for the time being. They must be panicked and uneasy arriving at a new place; separating them is not good. Besides, the two look like they would fall if the wind blows; let them recuperate and get stronger in the farm first."

"Nanhai, you really have a Bodhisattva's heart, good man!" He Ma said with a smile, "However, our group has booked this woman. You are not allowed to keep her for yourself. The loli is all yours—that girl's appearance is very proper."

The next day, as soon as it was light, the work team set off. With the experience from last time, they were familiar with the road. The agricultural vehicles arrived at the salt field in less than an hour. Because there was a lot of luggage, the vehicles drove directly in along the stone slab road. The village was still deserted. Occasionally, a few figures were seen on the street, but seeing three or four vehicles roaring into the village entrance, they ran home in terror, slamming their doors shut with a clang. Not a single person came out to watch the excitement.

Looking for Village Head Tan, he was nowhere to be found. Calling at doors everywhere to ask, terrifying panting sounds came from inside the houses. Pushing the doors open to enter, there were only some elderly people and women. Amidst their fearful expressions, one could see their faces full of sorrow, their skin as blue as their walls. Younger women had their faces smeared pitch black. It was rare to see a few able-bodied men, and they were all full of panic and uneasiness, some even full of hostility. Xi Yazhou knew that although it seemed deserted here, the atmosphere in the village was actually very tense. He called everyone to gather together and inquire household by household, not to act alone.

After inquiring for a long time, they finally walked into a house. Inside were an elderly couple, a young lad, and a burly man about forty years old, squatting on the floor of the main room. Xi Yazhou led Zhang Xingjiao in. The elderly woman was more composed and asked about the whereabouts of the village head. The few people didn't utter a word. Xi Yazhou asked the young lad again, but this lad with a filthy face turned his head away, shyly saying nothing. Xi Yazhou started to feel strange, then suddenly realized: this was a girl. Dressing as a man was probably out of fear of them looting.

To avoid misunderstanding, after saying a few casual words, Xi Yazhou led the people out, preparing to find someone else to question. As he walked past the wall root outside the courtyard, he heard the elderly man, presumably the father, squeezing out a panicked and trembling voice from his throat: "Child, take Little Qin out to hide later. If they arrest people, I can't face the village head..."

So the village head's daughter was here! Xi Yazhou knew this might be the breakthrough to the problem, but after hearing similar reports from everyone, a wave of doubt surged in his heart. Originally, he heard Wang Luobin and the people who came here a few days ago say: although the people here treated them coldly, they were not hostile. How come in just a few days without change, they regarded them as enemies? Such a cold attitude was a major obstacle to his plan.

He gathered everyone together: "Everyone saw it, right? The masses not only distrust us but obviously have hostile emotions. The key now is to let the masses know us. We must use practical actions to move the masses and raise their awareness! From now on, we must demand ourselves according to the excellent traditions of the People's Liberation Army, the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. While building the camp, we must also carry out propaganda to the masses. The center of the propaganda is: We are—" He suddenly got stuck. In another time and space, naturally, it would be "We are the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, the people's own army," and so on. But here?

Up to now, the transmigrators had not yet proposed a political slogan for mobilizing the masses—Li Zicheng had a slogan like "The Dashing King comes, no need to pay grain tax"—this involved delicate political ideology issues among the transmigrators. In many meetings before the crossing, such differences had already been revealed.

"Serve the people—" Du Wen just started.

"No way, we didn't come here for that, not good!" Someone immediately objected.

Indeed, most people here came with the purpose of becoming superior men. Saying things like serving the people would be too fake.

"Enforce justice on behalf of Heaven!"

"Please, this isn't Liangshan Marsh. The end of the Liangshan heroes wasn't that great."

Xi Yazhou thought for a while, then discussed with Wang Luobin: "I think let's call it 'Eradicate the violent and eliminate evil, protect the territory and comfort the people'."

"I want to point out that the political direction of this sentence is problematic and lacks revolutionary struggle nature." Du Wen pointed out that this slogan fully exposed the essence of opposing bullies but not the emperor, not opposing feudalism.

"Alright, alright," Xi Yazhou interrupted her speech, "What our political slogan is has to be decided by the Executive Committee meeting. Let's use this temporarily: it has more leeway and is also relatively targeted. It's easy for the salt workers to resonate with—common people don't understand big principles; clear, visible, and tangible benefits are what attract them."

Although some felt these words were too plain and lacked combat effectiveness, no one could come up with a more suitable one for the moment, so they decided to use this temporarily. Zhang Xingjiao liked this slogan very much.

Xi Yazhou ordered the work team to split into two. One team would establish a camp at the Ge Hong Temple at the intersection outside the village, doing everything themselves; the other team would immediately launch propaganda to the masses and investigate the situation in the village.

"How to do propaganda?" Someone started muttering.

"How to do propaganda? Have you ever met someone selling insurance? Just like that." Xi Yazhou pointed out, "Has anyone sold insurance? Anyone who has done sales will do too. You demonstrate in front, and everyone follow and learn. In the future, when you are in charge of a side alone, getting people to work and risk their lives for you will depend on this."

Everyone launched the transmigrators' first mass work according to his order.

Needless to say, such mass work was arduous enough, especially since the language was not very fluent, exhausting Zhang Xingjiao until his lips were parched and mouth dry. The result exchanged was still cold and fearful reactions.

However, they roughly learned that because Great Household Gou couldn't collect enough silver and the salt was scarce, he took away several elders of the village, threatening to release them only when the customary silver and salt were paid in full.

Through visits and propaganda, they discovered that the entire village was impoverished to the extreme. Food had been scarce here for a long time. The village head said the able-bodied men were reclaiming land in Maniao, but actually, they just planted some Araceae taro. Although this thing was abundant and filling, eating it for a long time made people's faces turn ashen gray. As for clothing, it was even more miserable. Clothes had long been worn to shreds. Many salt workers were stark naked when working, but usually, they still had clothes to wear. Now, only ragged clothes patched over and over again remained, unable to even cover their buttocks. Some families of four or five had only one piece of clothing; whoever went out wore it, while the rest stayed home naked in the straw pile. Every household could be described by the words "destitute with only four bare walls."

The work team learned all this, and compassion caused them intense anxiety about the suffering of the masses in this time and space. Some people even shed tears. Humans still have some pity for the suffering of their own kind after all.

The village was as silent as death. Under a solitary lamp, several main figures of the entire work team sat in a large tent. Everyone was thinking about problems.
