# Chapter 1840 - Suspicious Points

Suiyun wept softly: "This servant dares not do it again."

"Carry her down!" Yuewan said. "Go to my room to get medicine and apply it to her. Let her recuperate well."

Lian Nishang saw that Mingnu had been rescued, and the testimonies of the people in the courtyard didn't implicate any other illegal human trafficking. There was no point in watching this *laoju* display her authority here. However, the matter of selecting a maid based on birth dates still aroused her suspicion.

Although Yuewan's explanation was reasonable, the "Mao Family Inn Mass Murder Case" currently under investigation involved a large number of boys and girls and content about birth dates. At this critical juncture, this woman suddenly wanting to pick a girl with a special horoscope and attribute to be a maid was inevitably suspicious.

She immediately ordered the servant women and male servants in the courtyard to be brought in one by one, asking if they knew about inviting a Daoist priest to tell Yuewan's fortune.

Except for the house guards responsible for night watch and rough work, everyone said it was true. They also said it was common to select people around based on horoscopes. The proof was that the maids and servants around Yuewan had been changed over a month ago. The servants who originally had conflicting horoscopes or clashing attributes with her had all returned to the Liang Residence.

After a round of questioning, there were no suspicious points. Li Ziyu had leaked the bottom line just now, feeling a bit guilty of having an "unstable stance." Furthermore, since Mingnu was already found, insisting on further search would inevitably smack of "personal revenge." So he proposed to withdraw and return to focus on handling the Fangchun Court case.

"I'm still not at ease." Lian Nishang pondered again and again. "After all, this courtyard is Fangchun Court's place. Searching it won't take much effort." She then told Yuewan to gather everyone in the courtyard and then search the entire courtyard.

"Search this courtyard..." Yuewan seemed a bit surprised, showing a difficult expression. "Officer, you see clearly, this servant usually serves the master. There are many women's items in the room. It seems, it seems, very inconvenient... Please exempt the search, officer."

Lian Nishang couldn't help blushing. She roughly knew what these "women's items" were. Still a virgin, she felt a bit embarrassed and said: "Don't worry, we are just looking to see if there are suspicious people in the courtyard. We won't rummage through your things, let alone touch private items."

With a face full of reluctance, Yuewan barely agreed.

Because it involved a woman's boudoir, Lian Nishang didn't ask the police officers to follow. She only named Li Ziyu to accompany her to inspect the small courtyard once. Seeing the exquisite furnishings and magnificent utensils, including many Australian goods, Li Ziyu sighed secretly while watching. In such a first-class wealthy household, it was truly hard to imagine given his experience.

After the search, she called the roll one by one. There were no suspicious persons, nor were any critical items found. In the study, there were cupboards of Liang Cunhou's private letters and account books. But since this wasn't a major case and there was no search warrant, Lian Nishang naturally couldn't take them out for detailed inspection.

After the inspection, Yuewan saw everyone to the door, exchanged a few polite words, and saw them leave. Only then did she tell the house guards to get some reed mats to cover the door from the back courtyard, and find a carpenter to repair it tomorrow. Then she returned to the main room courtyard.

A little maid served tea. She took a shallow sip and let out a long breath. She asked: "How is Suiyun?"

"Medicine has been applied," the maid replied.

"Tell Liang Shun to go back to the residence to report to the Young Master. Tell him what happened today, and ask a doctor for Suiyun."

"Need to send a letter?"

"No need. Tell Liang Shun to say whatever he saw just now. If police question him on the way, tell the truth."

Shortly after the little maid retreated, another maid came in carrying a plate of dim sum. She put down the dim sum but didn't leave. Yuewan waited for her to close the room door before whispering: "Are the things okay?"

The maid replied: "Don't worry. The things are all fine. I was also betting, betting they wouldn't rummage through things indiscriminately—the Aussie yamen runners are indeed incorruptible and rule-abiding as outsiders say! Thanks to their incorruptibility, otherwise this matter would have definitely implicated the Young Master!" Saying this, she patted her chest: "I was scared to death! Thanks to you stalling them in front, otherwise just those books on the table..."

Yuewan shook her head, signaling her to stop talking.

"It's just wronged Suiyun." The maid said, "I see the hair-thief police have already become suspicious of this place. The things still need to be moved to another place as soon as possible."

The maid speaking was Surui, one of Liang Cunhou's personal maids. She didn't serve Yuewan originally but came specifically to deliver items today. unexpectedly encountering this event.

In the instant Suiyun couldn't withstand the Hair-thief police, the two divided the work: Yuewan went out to stall the Australians, while Surui hid the potentially problematic items in the back.

"It's also lucky you were here, Sister. Anyone else would probably have been blind." Yuewan whispered. "The things can't be moved now. Who knows if the Australians have set a trap outside? Hiding them here for a while is okay. If the situation becomes urgent, just burn them. It's just that with this girl gone and Fangchun Court in trouble, finding another one will be difficult..."

"This isn't an urgent task," Yuewan said with worry in her eyes. "Please ask Sister to go back and tell the Young Master: in everything, it's better to stand firm first. The hair-thieves are different from the Great Ming after all..."

Lian Nishang returned to the police station and first reported the situation to Mu Min. listening to her report, Mu Min nodded: "You did well. But you made a mistake."

"I know breaking in to search was a bit rash—" Lian Nishang thought the Chief was blaming her for breaking in to search without asking for instructions.

"No." Mu Min said. "The power of spot checks lies with you. If you feel suspicious and the place is indeed within Fangchun Court's scope, there is nothing inappropriate about going in to search—the Senate doesn't recognize any extraterritoriality—only that spot checks rely on suddenness, catching suspects off guard so they don't have time to hide their evidence. You entangled with that Yuewan in the front for so long; even if there were a big living person, they would have hidden them."

Lian Nishang suddenly realized. Thinking of Yuewan kowtowing, saying good words, then scolding and punishing the maid, forty strokes then another twenty—she originally thought it was to curry favor with her or vent anger, but it turned out to be acting to delay! Her face turned red, her fists clenched, filled with regret and hatred: "I didn't expect to fall for her trick!"

"You don't have to blame yourself," Mu Min said. "This girl's birth date is indeed very suspicious. Write down her horoscope and zodiac sign in the report. We will ask experts to judge—whether this matter has any connection with the Mao Family Inn case."

Lian Nishang said "Yes." Mu Min added: "But this time you didn't come back empty-handed. At least it shows this Master Liang has some unspeakable dealings in Fangchun Court. We'll investigate slowly later. You go."

Lian Nishang saluted and was about to leave when Mu Min stopped her: "How is that girl?"

"She is with Li Ziyu now. It seems she is physically fine, just suffered a great fright. Tomorrow her parents will sign a bond to take her back."

"No, no rush for that. You take care of the child for a few days first—Li Ziyu is a man after all," Mu Min said. "She might know a lot of information. Talk to her when she calms down."

After Lian Nishang left, Mu Min called Wu Mu and told him the situation in Fangchun Court.

"Although no suspicious signs were found. But judging from the performance of Yuewan and others, there must be problems in his outer residence in Fangchun Court."

"I'll arrange manpower to monitor immediately." Wu Mu said.

Li Ziyu took Mingnu back to the police station and first got some hot food for her from the cafeteria—Fangchun Court didn't allow the *pipazai* to eat and drink at will. Not only did they eat little, but various medicinal materials were often added, said to be used for "nurturing appearance." This made her always feel hungry. Seeing the steaming food now, she ate wolfishly.

Li Ziyu told her to eat slowly several times, looking at this friend's niece with pity. He had watched Mingnu grow up. Before she grew her hair out, she used to follow behind them calling "Uncle." He and Zhang Yu often teased her. Watching her eat reminded him of her innocent and cute appearance as a young child. A burst of tenderness rose in his heart.

But keeping this child in the police station wasn't a solution. However, letting Zeng Juan take her back wasn't legal—Zeng Juan wasn't the guardian. As for calling her parents, wouldn't that be just out of the wolf's den and into the tiger's mouth? Moreover, Mingnu's stepmother was suspected of human trafficking.

Lian Nishang returned and conveyed Mu Min's meaning. Li Ziyu said: "Section Chief, you are so busy with work, how can I let you help take care of a child! How about I take her home and let my mother look after her."

Lian Nishang heard this and it fit her wishes exactly. But she thought for a moment and said: "This might be inappropriate. You have old ties with this child, right? If you take her to your home, you might have an unstable stance when handling the case in the future."

Hearing her tone, Li Ziyu knew she didn't mean to blame him, and immediately said gratefully: "It doesn't matter. She's not my relative. This child is now a witness and has nowhere to go. If I, the handling officer, don't take her back, should I send her to that ghostly place, Huanghua Temple?"

So it was decided to let Zhao Gui send Mingnu to Li Ziyu's home first. Li Ziyu instructed Zhao Gui with a few words. Then he got up to find Zeng Juan—both to announce the good news and to let him rest assured early.

Without the burden of watching the child, Lian Nishang simply didn't go to the dormitory to rest. She returned to Fangchun Court to "work on site." She handled the legal procedures in the bureau first, issuing an arrest warrant to formally arrest Han Qiaojie, Huang Xiang, Muyun, Yao-sao, and others in Fangchun Court, interrogating them one by one.

Han Qiaojie made a circle in the city bureau and was sent back. She thought there was no big issue, but unexpectedly she had to "face the court" as soon as she returned. Taken to the flower hall, she turned pale—with these few "demon kings" here, she would lose a layer of skin even if she didn't die today!
