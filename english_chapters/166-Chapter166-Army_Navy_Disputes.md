# Chapter 166: Army-Navy Disputes

When Huang Xiong arrived at headquarters office, besides Li Yunxing there were three others. One he recognized—Battalion Officer "Chief Wei." Another "Chief Ma" frequently appeared at training grounds, seemingly important.

Unknown to him: Ran Yao. Li Yunxing had called the Security Group immediately after drill. Huang Xiong's insight clearly exceeded commoner level—he was probably a Ming military officer. He needed confirmation whether this was a spy.

Also one spectator: Dongmen Chuiyu. Currently on light duties—East Gate Market was orderly. He often loitered around Ma Qianzhu's office, even drafting staff regulations—earning a nominal staff officer title.

"Sit." Ran Yao said casually.

"Thank you, Chief!" Huang Xiong snapped another attention—he seemed particularly fond of this.

Everyone noted his movements differed from ordinary recruits.

"You were regular army?" Ran Yao asked directly.

"Yes! I was *bazong* at Jizhou garrison." His face was frank.

A Ming officer. This surprised Li Yunxing. This recruitment brought many escaped local military households. But Jizhou *bazong* and Hainan military households were completely different. The former were real soldiers. The latter were military landlords' serfs. Vastly different.

"Being an imperial officer—why travel thousands of *li* to Qiongzhou?"

Huang Xiong hesitated: "I... clashed with superiors. Accidentally killed him."

A killer too. No wonder fleeing so far.

"Why the conflict?"

"Money and grain." Huang Xiong smiled bitterly. "Court constantly owed wages—nearly starving soldiers. When some allocation came—never our share. I demanded it. Conflict resulted."

Straightforward reason. But Ran Yao knew: if a spy, his cover story would be waterproof. Being in Hainan, they couldn't investigate Jizhou truth.

"Why join our forces?"

Huang Xiong said: "Chiefs are overseas people—unrelated to Ming officialdom. Naturally I'd join here."

No holes in this either. Exchanging glances, Ma Qianzhu suddenly asked:

"How do you rate our militia training?"

"Chiefs' training methods—I've never seen before. Dare not evaluate." Huang Xiong said respectfully. "However, within a month, transforming village bumpkins into people who know advance, retreat, and formations—already masterful. More than sufficient against local bandits."

Ma Qianzhu nodded, asked random questions, then dismissed him.

"Keep him?" Ran Yao whispered.

Playing safe: this man shouldn't be used—best eliminated. He'd received full transmigrator military training. If truly a spy—escaping would leak intelligence to authorities.

Wei Aiwen said: "I recommend keeping him. Such people will grow more common. Everything has beginnings. Distrusting everyone—who can we use?"

"What if he's a spy?" Li Yunxing hesitated.

"Spies wouldn't expose identity so easily." Ran Yao said. "Personally, I believe him."

"That's not materialist." Dongmen Chuiyu criticized.

"What's materialist? For true vigilance—we have so many workers, civilians. Can you guarantee every one's reliable?"

"Little Wei's right. We can't always hide in our small circle." Ma Qianzhu decided. To Ran Yao: "Mark his file 'controlled use.' Assign two soldiers for cross-surveillance."

"I'll arrange it."

"Hey hey—" Wei Aiwen protested. "You've planted informants in Training Battalion without telling me?"

"That's Executive Committee vertical management. Just read our bulletins." Ran Yao tapped the table—this week's soldier trends document sat there. "Little Wei, your security awareness is poor. This is classified—just leaving it on tables?"

"Soldiers can't enter here. Even guards are ourselves. Can't lose anything. Doors have locks." Wei Aiwen was casual. "Chief of Staff Ma, want to see our shooting training?"

"Sure, let's go."

To date, the New Army had conducted 100 shooting sessions: 40 live-fire, 60 dry-fire. This exceeded 19th-century Britain's—the most shooting-focused army's—new recruit counts. Transmigrators spared no expense on their founding forces.

Walking to 2nd Company, they found soldiers clustered. One dark, brawny soldier aimed a rifle at a distant stone. The crowd surrounded him.

*BANG.* Stone flew. Good training. Wei Aiwen recognized him: Yang Zeng—Li Yunxing's discovered shooting prodigy.

Just as Wei Aiwen moved to commend him, Dongmen Chuiyu stepped ahead.

He told the shooter: "You—nice shooting."

The soldier chuckled.

"Now—shoot again for me." Dongmen spoke unhurriedly.

The soldier shot again. Hit.

Dongmen nodded, standing beside the soldier. He drew a Jierienduo pistol from his waist, loaded a blank, and said: "Once more."

The soldier began cleaning the barrel—then Dongmen fired skyward. The soldier's hand trembled—some powder spilled.

This lone staff officer began urging: "Faster."

Powder finally went in. During cleaning, Dongmen fired twice more.

The soldier began reloading.

"Faster. Even faster."

Dongmen's gun fired again. The soldier dropped a bullet.

"What are you doing? Load! Hurry load!" Dongmen shouted beside the soldier's ear.

The soldier frantically fished another cartridge from his pouch.

Gun fired again. Followed by: "Faster! Move faster!"

The soldier shakily inserted a round into the barrel.

Another shot. Everyone saw trembling hands placing the percussion cap.

"Fire! Fire now!" He continued.

The soldier finally finished loading.

"Quick. Aim. Shoot!" He commanded amid pistol fire.

The soldier's rifle fired.

Distant stone—no reaction. The bullet missed.

Dongmen Chuiyu holstered his pistol: "Keep practicing."

Everyone shook their heads. Great shot—but not a soldier.

After leaving, Wei Aiwen caught up angrily:

"Dongmen Chuiyu—don't you think that was excessive?"

"How was it excessive?"

"That Yang Zeng—since joining the Skirmisher Platoon, how much effort he's invested in shooting practice—do you know? He's currently the battalion's best shot."

"That's irrelevant. Captain Wei, remember: we need soldiers, not shooting athletes." He glanced at Li Yunxing. "Fighting isn't in quiet shooting ranges."

Before Wei Aiwen could respond, he walked away.

Wei Aiwen and Li Yunxing began disliking this non-nearsighted glasses wearer.

More infuriating for Wei Aiwen: his impressive artillery was split—half to Navy! Only 9 × 12-pounder mountain howitzers and some 6-pounders remained. 8-pounders and 70mm breechloaders went to Navy. Self-proclaimed "Artillery Superintendent" Zhang Bailin was furious—he'd invested massive effort in artillery. Li Haiping's shameless material bribery (unlimited Navy fish) luring away the best gunners made him livid.

"Chief of Staff Ma—this is unacceptable!" Zhang Bailin raged. "Army is anti-encirclement main force. Give cannons to Navy—how do we fight?"

"Right—Training Battalion has four infantry companies. Why does Navy take one as 'Marine Squad'? Executive Committee favors Navy—we accept. But this is bullying!"

Ma Qianzhu stood: "All you want is cannons! 8-pounders—can you haul them?"

"Nanhai Farm has—"

"You're Artillery Superintendent—how many horses for 8-pounders?"

Zhang Bailin fell silent—he didn't know his beloved weapon's horse requirements.

"At least six! Medium horses." Ma Qianzhu tapped the table. "How many horses does Wu Nanhai's farm have?"

"Donkeys work too—" Zhang Bailin weakly resisted.

"Donkeys can only pull 12-pounder mountain howitzers. One mountain howitzer battery's cannons plus limbers needs 30 donkeys. Wu Nanhai bankrupted himself wouldn't suffice! You don't appreciate costs!"

Zhang Bailin completely deflated. Wei Aiwen persisted about Marine Company.

"Marine Company is future Navy sailors. Training Battalion was just interim training. Month's up—Navy wants them for ship training."

Both received a lecture and left defeated.

"Navy's too damn bullying!" Wei Aiwen was still furious.

"Using *Fengcheng* Hotel—they've bribed Executive Committee. Too corrupt!"

"Let's find Commander Xi."

"Fat Xi?" Zhang Bailin rudely nicknamed. "He and Ma Qianzhu wear the same pants."

"What about others? Bai Yu, Ying Yu—"

"Unreliable. Those veterans spent lifetimes 'obeying Party's orders'—here it's 'obeying Executive Committee's orders.'"

"Continuing like this—Army will suffer." Wei Aiwen lamented Army's future.

"Hmph. Time to organize an advocacy group for Army's rights—for all transmigrators' sake! Their mismanagement harms the transmigration enterprise. Heard many battalion officers are dissatisfied with Executive Committee decisions—"

"Lower your voice. Tell me—specifically what to do?"
