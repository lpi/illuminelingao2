# Chapter 2103 - Abandoning the Australians for the Ming

Torn between these impossible dilemmas, Jiang Suo deserted. During a naval training exercise in the Pearl River estuary near Hong Kong, when the Marine unit was practicing amphibious landings, he deliberately let himself fall overboard, then swam far out before crawling ashore.

He stripped off his Fubo Army uniform and discarded everything. In a nearby fishing village, he stole a set of clothes. He had given no thought to what he would do after deserting, or whether he still intended to seek revenge. His mind was blank; he simply vanished into the night with no destination in mind.

He knew full well what awaited deserters—especially one guilty of "fleeing before the enemy." He begged his way to Guangzhou, and knowing that the Elders' annexation of Guangdong was imminent, he continued north, wanting only to put as much distance as possible between himself and the Council of Elders.

Jiang Suo had no intention of throwing himself on the mercy of the authorities. A man like him—little better than a beggar, penniless and unknown—would never gain an audience with any official. Even if he did, he would be suspected of being a spy and likely dragged out for immediate execution. Back in his homeland, the fortress lord had been known to behead travelers for looking "suspicious."

Jiang Suo was somewhat familiar with Guangdong's roads. Master Ban had brought them across the Five Ridges into Guangdong, and now he intended to retrace that route northward—the farther he could flee, the better.

But he had barely reached Nanxiong when a passing column of soldiers impressed him into labor to carry goods.

The loads were wooden crates, extremely heavy. The porters strained under shoulder poles and backloaded baskets, marching day and night. If Jiang Suo hadn't spent the past few years in the fishing village with food and drink aplenty—fishing, training, and toughening his body—he might have been worked to death within days.

Jiang Suo sought opportunities to escape, but the guards watched closely, and any attempt to flee meant decapitation. He could find no chance.

Then one day, a porter stumbled and smashed open a crate, scattering its contents—and Jiang Suo's life might have ended unremarked on that road were it not for what spilled out.

What fell from the broken crate were several brand-new Nanyang-pattern rifles!

Though Jiang Suo had never served in the National Army, he had seen this type of rifle more than once. It was a grade below the Minié rifles used by the regular army—shorter range, poorer accuracy. Only the National Army and police used it. Yet against ordinary bandits and pirates, it was already a fearsome weapon.

How could the Ming army have these?!

His astonished expression immediately attracted the attention of the officer in charge. That night, when camp was made, Jiang Suo was bound hand and foot and dragged before the commander.

"You recognize this bird-gun?" The officer's voice was grave.

Perhaps the days of grueling labor had dulled Jiang Suo's will to survive. He nodded. "It's a Nanyang rifle."

At the words "Nanyang rifle," the officer's brow twitched. "Who are you?!"

Jiang Suo held nothing back and immediately revealed that he was a deserter from the Australian army.

"So you were one of the Hair-Bandits' soldiers, then."

"Yes."

"Hmm..." The officer studied him for a long moment, then exhaled. "Do you know how to use this weapon?"

"What's so difficult about it?" Jiang Suo replied. "Among the Australians, this is merely a second-rate firearm issued to the National Army."

"In that case, load it and fire a shot for me." The officer ordered his attendants to untie him.

By now, Jiang Suo had put life and death out of his mind. In a few swift motions, he loaded the cartridge, shouldered the rifle, aimed briefly, and pulled the trigger.

The shot extinguished the glowing incense stick twenty *zhang* away.

---

The officer's eyes gleamed. "Good!" he murmured.

From that night on, Jiang Suo was no longer a laborer.

"My surname is Yi, given name Haoran. I serve as an advisor in Governor-General Xiong's staff," the officer said amiably, without a trace of the condescending posturing typical of the gentry class. "Since you know the Hair-Bandits' situation and are willing to serve the court, your future prospects are boundless. Guangdong's situation is precarious. I am returning with this shipment of firearms to Guangdong."

Jiang Suo did not know how the Nanyang rifles had ended up in Master Yi's hands, but he knew it must be a secret, so he kept silent.

"The rifles are fine, and simple enough to use—but alas, no one can handle them as skillfully as you. The Hair-Bandits are justly renowned for training elite troops—what a pity!"

As he said "pity," his gaze drifted toward the northeastern night sky, eyes filled with wistfulness.

"If the Australians were willing to serve our Great Ming, what fear would there be of the Eastern Captives? Of the roving bandits? But alas—it is already too late!"

Yi Haoran brought him back to Zhaoqing. Along the way, Jiang Suo learned that this scholar-advisor was a native of Liaodong who had earned the *xiucai* degree. Yet he was more passionate about military strategy than the Four Books and Five Classics. Works like *The Art of War* and *The Esserta of the Military Classics* he had read a thousand times over, until he could recite them with his eyes closed. Having repeatedly failed the higher examinations, weighed down by family burdens, he found work tutoring in the household of a military officer in Guangning. Though the pay was modest, the family lived in comfort and contentment.

Then, in Yi Haoran's fortieth year, the imperial army suffered a catastrophic defeat at Sarhu under Nurhaci's hand. Cities across Liaodong fell one after another; his employer died in battle; Guangning was abandoned. He led his family in flight toward the passes. Along the way, wife and children were lost to him, and by the time he found refuge in the capital, he was utterly alone.

Through old friends and relatives in the capital, through connections cultivated as a Liaodong native who "knew military matters," Yi Haoran secured a position in the staff of Yuan Chonghuan, who was about to march out beyond the passes. Under Yuan Chonghuan, he witnessed a turbulent chapter of history—the brief blossoming of victory in Liaodong, and the bitter feuding between Yuan Chonghuan and Mao Wenlong. After Yuan Chonghuan was arrested and imprisoned, Yi Haoran had nowhere to go. Using his credentials, he attached himself to the recalled Sun Chengzong, helped recover the four cities within the passes, then watched as Sun was once again sidelined and retired due to illness. Already past fifty, Yi Haoran obtained a letter of introduction from Sun Chengzong and joined the staff of Xiong Wencan, Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi.

Xiong Wencan's staff was teeming with advisors who had arrived on the strength of similar introductions. Naturally, no one looked on this aging *xiucai* with any special favor. They allotted him a small stipend each month and gave him a room to live in, but rarely called on him for any duties. Yi Haoran was content to be idle, wandering and sightseeing. But he soon discovered that Guangdong was far from the peaceful haven he had imagined. Several years earlier, Wang Zunde had mobilized the entire province's forces against the Australians, only to suffer a crushing defeat at Chengmai. The Hair-Bandits had sailed into the Pearl River estuary, and Guangzhou itself nearly fell.

That battle had caused an uproar at court. Tens of thousands of soldiers were killed or scattered, and numerous officers perished. Afterward, word came that the "Hair-Bandits" had been defeated outside Guangzhou's walls and fled by sea. They had supposedly dispersed to plunder along Qiongzhou's coast and were no longer a threat.

Yet he soon learned the truth was otherwise. Not only had the Australians not retreated, they had effectively taken control of the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture—and there were even Australian encampments on the very outskirts of Guangzhou. Because they didn't pillage or kill, and everyone could get by in peace, the matter had been hushed up. The Guangdong officialdom was "terrified of the Hair-Bandits," willfully ignoring their existence.

Yi Haoran understood that the "bandit threat had matured" and would become a grave peril. He sought out survivors of the Chengmai battle and the clashes in the Pearl River estuary. He quickly realized that the Hair-Bandits were an even more dangerous adversary than the Later Jin.

Having weathered so many reversals, he had long since seen through the hypocrisy of officialdom. Yet a lingering sense of loyalty to sovereign and country burned within him. Having witnessed the ravages of war, he believed the only way to spare the people from suffering was to win battles.

"For all under heaven to know peace, there must be war to end war," Yi Haoran said on the boat to Zhaoqing. "The Hair-Bandits are men, too—and their soldiers are poor common folk. What they rely on is nothing more than superior ships, powerful artillery, and disciplined ranks. If the court can steel its resolve, refine its weapons, and train a new army, there's no reason the Hair-Bandits cannot be defeated."

Yi Haoran put on no airs and showed none of the affected condescension of a superior deigning to seek counsel from an inferior. Speaking of himself, of the state of the realm, of the Hair-Bandits—he was entirely candid. And Jiang Suo spoke of the Australians and the Fubo Army with equal frankness.

The two men—vastly different in age and status—came to know and respect each other during that journey. By the time they reached Zhaoqing, Jiang Suo had learned that this shipment of weapons had indeed come from the Hair-Bandits. Xiong Wencan had spent a great deal of money acquiring a batch of Nanyang rifles and ammunition from Fujian and Shandong, intending to equip his personal guard. Because of the distance involved, Yi Haoran—the "idle man" of the staff—had been assigned to escort the shipment.

Upon returning to Zhaoqing, Yi Haoran discharged his duty and quietly reported the matter to Xiong Wencan, who took great interest. He secretly summoned Jiang Suo and praised him for "casting off darkness for the light." After a round of questioning, though he privately disapproved of Jiang Suo's "rebellious discourtesy"—the man had obviously "been tainted by Hair-Bandit habits"—he nonetheless commended him for his familiarity with "Hair-Bandit matters" and expertise with "Hair-Bandit weapons." He awarded him fifty taels of silver and the military rank of Company-Level Sentinel in his personal guard, specifically tasked with training the household troops.

Because Yi Haoran had carried out his mission effectively—and especially because he had recruited a "talent" like Jiang Suo—his standing in Xiong Wencan's staff rose sharply. After several discussions, Xiong Wencan realized that Yi Haoran not only understood military affairs but possessed unique insights into "Hair-Bandit matters." He began to lean on him. This, however, provoked the jealousy of Chang Qingyun, the self-styled "foremost expert on Hair-Bandit affairs." To balance the two factions and strengthen his own forces, Xiong Wencan dispatched Yi Haoran to Guangxi to train a new army. Jiang Suo went with him and was promoted to *qianzong*—the rank of company commander.

This new army of just five hundred men was not fully equipped with Nanyang rifles, but it was the force Xiong Wencan had poured enormous resources into arming and training. Now Jiang Suo was leading these troops in defense of Bangshan, west of Wuzhou, overlooking the Gui River. Since it was treacherous to stab an Elder who had shown him favor in the back, and treacherous not to avenge Qingxia, then let this long feud be settled fairly—on the battlefield!
