# Chapter 841: Merchant's Report (IV)

The three of us discussed the purpose of the peculiar wooden poles. Mr. Gonzalez believed they were some kind of special idol worship by the Australians—a type of ritual facility with religious meaning. But Mr. Leibtrini said he couldn't see any religious significance in them, because they didn't really count as idols, nor did any Australians show any gestures of reverence toward them. I personally think Mr. Leibtrini's view makes sense. Along the way, we saw no one express respect or worship toward these poles, nor any similar traces: no one offered, burned incense, or made sacrifices to the poles.

The distance from Bopu to Bairencheng was very short—we estimated only about one league. We then entered the area of Bairencheng. Later we learned that we never actually entered Bairencheng—the so-called Bairencheng was the Australians' castle, which no one except themselves and the native confidants serving them could enter. But outside Bairencheng, a city of considerable scale had been built around the Australians' castle. They call it East Gate Market. Because it is located east of Bairencheng. It is said that when the Australians first arrived in Lingao, this was where they traded with the local natives. In just a few years, this originally crude market developed into a fairly prosperous town.

East Gate Market itself has no walls for protection, but there are watchtowers at the road entrances. These watchtowers are very common here. They are not only in Bopu but also distributed along both sides of the road. The Australians seem to use them as a main defensive facility. The watchtowers are generally square-shaped, with thick stone slabs at the base and fired bricks for the tower body. Some are also very crude, built with interlaced timber or bamboo. Watchtowers generally have two to three stories. Some watchtowers' facilities could be called small fortresses, with moats encircling the watchtower, walls, and often cannons on top. The Australians station guards in the watchtowers, forming a tight lookout system. Obviously, the Australians are very anxious about their presence here and are constantly on guard against attacks.

Our carriage entered East Gate Market, entering the main street that runs east to west. The street was wide and flat, wide enough for twelve fully armed cavalrymen to ride abreast. On both sides of the street were many shops displaying a dazzling array of goods. Shops had two stories or three stories and were very compact. The streetscape here reminded me of the commercial districts of The Hague or Amsterdam. Australian houses are completely unlike Chinese architecture; rather, they are more similar to European houses. But more frugal and practical. Their use of space has reached an astonishing level; how to squeeze the maximum space from limited area is their only aesthetic standard for architecture. And what surprised us most was that every building we saw was tiled, and every building, regardless of size, used windows fitted with large pieces of glass.*

On both sides of the main street were many lateral side streets. Whether main street or side road, there weren't many pedestrians on the streets. All streets were paved with the same black gravel used for the main road, equally flat and smooth. The streets were astonishingly clean—whether in East or West, except in the Netherlands, I have never seen such a clean city. No garbage, no sewage, no human or animal excrement.**

On both sides of the streets were separate stone sidewalks planted with coconut palm saplings. The Australians seem to love coconut palms very much, planting this useful plant everywhere. Here we again saw things similar to the poles on the main road. But this time we easily identified their purpose—obviously streetlights. The iron lamp heads and glass shades confirmed our thoughts. It is said that every evening, someone is specially assigned to light the streetlamps. Lighting streetlamps at night to provide illumination obviously gives shops and pedestrians enough safety. However, their use of such an expensive practice seems to support the view that the Australians "live extravagantly."

Our carriage stopped in front of a beautiful red-brick building. It was a square house with a sloped roof covered with German-style tiles. The windows were tall and narrow. Of all the Australian houses I had seen in Lingao, it was the closest to European aesthetic views. According to the accompanying official, this was the Trading House, specially for receiving outside visitors. Outside merchants could also choose to stay here; there were fine food and rooms available.

We got out of the carriage under the guidance of the accompanying official. The Australians completely disregard pomp. Besides several accompanying officials and guards, there were no superfluous people, let alone splendid ceremonial guards. We were simply led into the Trading House and then brought to a small waiting hall.

Before entering the hall, our attendants and interpreters were all kept in the waiting hall. I objected to this to the guiding official because this way we would be unable to communicate. The other party replied in German: "Your interpreter who only speaks Cantonese is not needed."

His German was somewhat strange, but it was the most accurate German I had heard in all of Asia besides from Germans. His accent seemed to be from northern Germany.

But afterward, no matter how I tried to converse with him, he remained silent until we were brought into the hall to be received.

The hall was not large in area but was lavishly decorated. On the ceiling hung an exquisite glass chandelier with branches—but we noticed that the glass shades seemed to be completely sealed, and we couldn't see any traces of candles on them. Perhaps this was merely a decoration. In the center of the hall stood a magnificent Chinese-style screen, larger in size than any Chinese screens we had seen in India or Persia. On the walls were large paintings on paper depicting mountains, rivers, and flowers. The colors were bright. These paintings were all very large; some almost completely covered entire walls. Mr. Leibtrini believed these paintings showed obvious European techniques, including use of light, composition, and perspective. Thinking of the pamphlet Your Excellency gave me mentioning that Portuguese missionaries were active in Lingao, this was probably the work of some friars.

The floor of the hall was covered with luxurious Persian carpets. In front of the screen, many Chinese-style chairs and tea tables were neatly arranged in a semicircle. An Australian high official was waiting to receive us in front of the screen.

This Australian official was a so-called "Executive"—in status similar to our masters. The accompanying official reminded us: this was one of the nine most noble Senators in the entire Australian Senate, with full authority over trade matters.

This Executive was very young. Because the Australians don't wear beards at all, it was hard for us to tell their specific age. But I estimated his age would not exceed thirty. For a person of such young age to hold such a high position, perhaps it was inherited. His attire was very simple, no different from all the Australian officials we had seen along the way. If our accompanying official hadn't made the introduction, we wouldn't have been able to recognize such an important figure on the street.

Your Excellency, during the voyage I had read several accounts of China written by travelers and missionaries. Every one mentioned that Chinese officials love grand and magnificent displays; large numbers of retainers and ceremonial guards are essential equipment for every official. But among the Australians, we saw no such taste at all. As an Executive, he had neither ceremonial personnel nor many clerks and guards in attendance. He received us in the most plain manner. This made me think of our homeland—the Australians have similarities with us in many respects.***

The Executive invited us to sit in the chairs in front of the screen. He then expressed apologies through the accompanying official that there was no one locally who understood our language. If High German could not serve as the language for talks, he asked whether we could use French, English, Spanish, or Latin. I indicated that High German was a very convenient language for us.

Before the talks began, I presented the letter from the Batavia East Indies Council to the Lingao Australian Senate to the Executive to verify our identity. And I submitted the list of gifts to them. The other party expressed thanks. Afterward, we began relevant discussions on trade issues.

The Australians expressed great interest in all the various goods we had brought. They were willing to buy all the goods we had transported and were willing to conduct further negotiations to expand trade. I seized this opportunity to raise objections on the customs tariff issue. Your Excellency surely saw in my previous report that although they levied very low tariffs on most imported products, or even duty-free, they levied heavy taxes on the Company's main export commodity in the East Indies—spices. I objected to this and requested that we reach a unified rate with them: that except for duty-free goods, all goods we brought to Lingao to sell, regardless of variety, would be uniformly taxed at 1% customs duty. At the same time, we should be permitted to sell our goods freely in Lingao rather than have them entirely bought by the Australians. That is, permit goods to follow the market rather than being forced to trade at their prices—I believed such conditions were inappropriate.

The other party objected to this. He believed 1% customs duty was too low. And he completely rejected the concept of unified tariffs, proposing that customs duties must be levied according to the different conditions of each commodity. However, he agreed to adjust the tariff on spices and grant us tariff privileges on spice imports. As for the bulk-purchase policy, he also allowed us to be exempt from this policy and to sell freely according to market prices. Although we ultimately failed to get the other party to agree to the 1% unified tariff condition, getting the other party to accept these two points was, I believe, quite significant progress. I subsequently tried to reduce the export customs duties on Company goods to an appropriate rate.

*In early 17th century Europe, the roofs of many cities were still thatched. Some cities didn't switch to all tile until the late 18th century. Additionally, glass windows didn't become common until the 18th century.*

**The cities of the United Provinces, or the Dutch, were famous for their cleanliness in Europe. Additionally, Dutch dignitaries at that time were also known for their plainness—of course, by the standards of that time.*
