# Chapter 2 - Several Grand Finales

Chapter 2 Several Grand Finales

This is the "Lingao Qiming" Grand Finale that I hacked from the Blower's computer. Everyone just take a look, absolutely do not voice it out.

"Lingao Qiming" Grand Finale:

It is said that the Transmigrators finally succeeded in establishing a country and harmonizing the whole world. On this day, all Transmigrators rarely gathered at the Transmigration Palace, designed personally by Supervisor Ma in imitation of the Palace of the Soviets. The majestic Transmigration Palace was temporarily empty on top. It is said that because President Wen's waistline was underestimated, the copper statue was heavy in the front and light in the back, wide in the middle and narrow at the bottom, so it has now been melted down and reshaped.

However, this did not hinder the Transmigrators' celebration meeting. All non-Transmigrators left the venue automatically after setting up the dining tables, leaving only the Transmigrators in the empty hall. The dining tables were filled with all kinds of exquisite food that one could not even imagine, such as orangutan lips, panda paws, cheetah whips, giant softshell turtle skirts, a feast for the eyes. Various precious wines and waters sprayed out from the fountain in the center of the hall. It was truly a pool of wine and a forest of meat, a life of luxury and dissipation. The Transmigrators sang and danced, cheering for the perfect success of the Transmigration grand cause over the past ten years. Some people also thought of the comrades who died halfway, and could not help but cry aloud. The hall was very lively.

Amidst the laughter and cheerful voices, only Supervisor Ma on the rostrum seemed heavy-hearted. He only slightly touched the wine and food with his lips, and kept pressing his chest with his hand. The hard thing was still there, and his heart slowly relaxed. The Supervisor could not help but think of the task personally assigned by President Wen three months ago: come up with a plan for the distribution of Transmigrators' benefits. Although he didn't dare say it had to pass one hundred percent, the death order given by President Wen was that at least eighty percent of the Transmigrators must agree.

For these few months, Supervisor Ma did not know how many sleepless nights he had spent. His originally sparse hair did not have one left in a hundred. And how many people would pass this painstaking plan in his chest pocket when he took it out later, he really had no bottom in his heart.

While Ma Qianzhu was still heavy-hearted, with a loud bang, Xi Yazhou, who had jumped onto the dining table to dance the Cossack dance, fell headfirst. Before everyone could roar with laughter, they only heard the chaotic sound of tables, chairs, dishes, and chopsticks, and countless people fell to the ground one after another. Someone exclaimed "The wine and water are poisonous!", and the whole venue was instantly in chaos!

The Supervisor was shocked in his heart, and hurriedly activated his true qi, circulating the Sunflower Manual. But it was fine not to circulate it; once he circulated the kung fu, his internal organs and odd meridians and eight vessels instantly hurt as if cut by knives, and a mouthful of purple blood sprayed out. This poison was so domineering. In just the time of a breath, looking around, unexpectedly not a single person in the whole venue could stand up.

Only, only.
Only there was still one person standing proudly with hands behind his back on Supervisor Ma's left!

"How is it you?"
That person did not answer, but pressed his hand on the corner of the table. Instantly, a woo-woo sound rang out, and the floor in the hall actually slowly cracked open from the middle. Below was a bottomless large pit. As the floor retreated, the tables, chairs, and corpses of the Transmigrators also rolled down.

The Supervisor had deep internal strength after all, forcefully suppressing the poison from attacking into his heart meridians. He could still sit upright in the chair, only unable to move. Thinking that the Transmigration grand cause actually fell into this person's hands, he could not help but say hatefully: "I planted countless spies around you, President Wen, long ago. Why could you still commit such a big thing? I... I die with grievances..."

President Wen gave a long laugh, reached his hand under his neck and pulled. Instantly, a thin human skin mask appeared in his hand, revealing another rare fat face.

That fatty grinned hideously: "President Wen and I have never appeared at the same time. Could it be that you high people with eyes higher than the top never discovered this?"

Ma Qianzhu's face was like dead ash, and he sprayed another mouthful of fresh blood. Seeing the floor retreat to his own feet, with blurred consciousness, he could only shout: "Whatever! Whatever! To die in the Pit King's pit can be considered an explanation..."

Looking at the empty hall, the fatty let out a hair-raising wild laugh. He went forward and tore off the last two characters on the "Celebration Meeting" banner, revealing the word "Building" behind. Outside the door, came the uniform shout of "Thousands of autumns and ten thousand years, unite the whole globe".

The above is the work of "Eagle Descending from the Sky" (Idiot Crowd).
Below is YYYYY's supplement to this ending.

Too fast.

Learn from Yongzheng.
First, the poisonous wine from the turning-heart pot accompanied by poisonous pigeons. Xi Yazhou and other people were greedy and ate too much, so they were lost.

Among the remaining crowd, some were not poisoned, and some were lightly poisoned.
Then hidden experts, Master P? and others, relying on a pair of precious palms, vomited blood and injured the female pirate, but also died from poison.

Coming out of the building was poisonous smoke, and another batch was lost.

North Latitude and other special forces people broke the mechanisms and were lost.
.......

Altogether ten poisonous schemes.
Finally, the escapees were only Xiao Zishan and a few others (the author opened a golden finger), but the story is far from over, and the grievances are even less over.
The survivors gathered on the mountain to mourn the dead comrades. At this time, the dawn of daybreak slowly rose on the distant sea surface. It was Meng De who returned from executing a mission outside.
"Amsterdam, I will be back," Xiao Zishan said when leaving.
