# Chapter 2344 - Comprehensive Adjustment

The Wuzhou incident finally fell the curtain after a vigorous grand discussion. This was on one hand due to active secret activities of all sides; on the other hand, because the Southward Advance Faction jumped out very suitably at this juncture, the Senate's attention was quickly attracted away again.

Although Xie Erren was condemned by words and pens, made notorious. However the ending was fairly satisfactory (passable), only arranged to return to Propaganda Sector, responsible for "Material Review" work in Ministry of Truth (Office of Truth), counted as landing an idle job standing aside.

Organization and Pol-Sec departments once concentratedly fired upon, although also "criticized", actually didn't suffer substantive damage. After a round of tense consultation and collusion by all sides, agreed to a series of suggestions on Pol-Sec personnel changes and increasing local branches proposed by Ma Jia. The Senate immediately passed a series of emergency budget bills, appending budget for Pol-Sec Bureau and Bodyguard General Bureau. Bodyguard General Bureau which originally almost only had a plaque (name) also counted as implemented to reality. Although appending budget was expected thing, still made Finance Department frown tight.

However consequences caused by Wuzhou Incident were far-reaching. Xie Erren's failure although insignificant in the big picture, verified a certain opinion inside the Senate for a long time: The Senate didn't have enough resources to conduct Continental Strategy.

In front of such living "Tragedy", Senate public opinion changed from "Expanding Battle Results" to "Practicing Internal Skills Hard". Nowadays Yao Chaos in Guangdong were like raging fire, Rat Plague in Guangzhou hadn't ended yet, they had to face Guangxi with even more complex environment. Wanting to attack on all sides again, if saying militarily the Senate could still support, pressure on civil administration, materials and finance was already big to the degree of nearly collapsing. Cheng Dong proposed in reports to the Cabinet many times, due to excessive printing of Silver Yuan Coupons, actually already unable to practice unrestricted exchange of Silver Yuans within Hainan and Guangzhou Special City range.

To a certain extent, currently trade cutoff with Great Ming and plague restriction on commercial activities in Guangzhou actually saved the new currency, making the problem of insufficient Silver Yuan currency not exposed.

After repeated Consultation, the Senate convened an informal General Assembly in November 1635. Discussed the next step of Continental Strategy.

Although limited by many Senators transferred out and on business trips, Senators able to attend were less than half, however before the meeting General Office sent main topics to every Senator via telegram, letting them express relevant views on respective topics.

Probably because fire had passed at the hearing, and all sides had roughly acceptable results, so this General Assembly rarely didn't conduct fierce debate. All sides discussed the situation, finally reached a new Continental Strategy Plan.

Saying new plan didn't differ much from old plan, but clarified again, the endpoint of Continental Strategy Action was "Taking Liangguang Completely". After completing this strategic objective, will no longer launch new comprehensive offensive on the mainland region.

Not only so, the Senate also explicitly pointed out at the meeting, in future "Three to Five Years time", will drastically reduce Brigade-Level large scale military operations. Scale and frequency of military operations will reduce drastically. Scale of Fubo Army and Navy no longer expands. Key point enriching security warfare troops mainly composed of National Army.

Overall, the new strategy transformed from "Opening Frontiers and Expanding Territories" to "Deep Governance".

New Plan's classification of Core Zone, Pacification Zone and Security Zone and administration guideline remained unchanged, but Core Zone range expanded to Guangzhou Special City, Foshan Experimental Zone, Wuzhou City, Nanning City and Guilin City as five main Core Zones.

Except Foshan , other cities were all directly transformed from "Prefectures" of original Ming State. Except Attached County (Prefectural Seat), mostly existed problem of too large jurisdiction area. So Core Zone governance mostly concentrated only within range of Attached County namely Prefectural City, spreading to other jurisdiction counties depending on situation. That meant although Guangzhou Special City was Core Zone, actually practicing "Deep Governance" were only Nanhai, Panyu, Sanshui three counties. Other Core Governance Zones were also similar.

Outside these five Core Zones, important regional transportation hubs, commercial centers and newly built industrial-mining centers in Liangguang, would also be objects of "Deep Governance". These regions grasped "Better Few Than Many" in overall principle, "Jurisdiction area maximum not exceeding one county."

In cadre appointment, proportion of naturalized cadre configuration would reduce layer by layer according to Core Zone, Pacification Zone and Security Zone. Strength on institution and social reform also reduced successively. Increased identification and usage range of "Retained Personnel". Original local Ming State local officials surrendering, as long as official reputation and assessment were passable, all could be transferred to other places for employment. For some Difficult Governance, Complex Situation regions, original officials having relatively outstanding governance performance, after inspection could be retained in original post in original place.

Cleaning fields (Land Survey), pushing new tax system work would be limited to Core Zone. Pacification Zone and Security Zone collected according to past Ming State tax quota.

 regarding original social transformation, new plan's tune lowered a lot. Basically determined only enforce in Core Zone.

Wording for Pacification Zone and Security Zone was "Improvement", only explicitly conducting comprehensive transformation and gratification on "Prostitutes", "Beggars" and "Broker Houses". Clans rejected very much in the past, wording tune also dropped drastically. Explicitly mentioned, in Pacification Zone and Security Zone "Prohibit Clan interference in Justice and Administration, gradually eliminate Clan influence", deleting originally emphatically mentioned sentences of "Key Strike, Gradually Eliminate Clan Forces".

This practice without exception caused debate inside the Senate, but debate wasn't too fierce. Because in the past their understanding of Clan force and function was limited, too easy in solving local clans on Hainan Island, unavoidably generated thought of contempt. But reality of Guangdong in these few months gave them profound lesson. Clan force not only had very broad social foundation, acting vicariously for many social service works government couldn't take care of. More importantly, in many Han-Yao mixed habitation, security chaotic regions, Clan was also important social stabilizer.

Destroying Clan not only required consuming massive resources, bigger danger was the Senate now didn't have enough resources to fill vacancy left after eliminating Clan.

Ideal finally lost to reality. Wanting to stand firm in Liangguang. Had to tolerate Clan. Therefore except continuing to push old guidelines in Key Zones, other places all changed to use new policies.

Fortunately this adjustment except having impact sense on Senators, instead bad no influence on naturalized cadres. One, they mostly couldn't understand why the Senate was so anti-Clan; Two, Liangguang situation also made them have absolutely no time to launch such work.

Regarding the problem raised by Senators whether such comprehensive contraction would indulge local evil forces, new countermeasure was establishing specialized Special Search Task Force, selecting capable personnel from Armed Forces, Reconnaissance General Bureau, Pol-Sec, Intelligence and Civil Administration departments, conducting work under command of Senators. Core personnel of each team about one hundred people. Can dispatch local garrison and police to coordinate when necessary.

Such Special Search Teams would establish six, responsible for relevant regions respectively.

Special Search Task Force would conduct independent investigation work in Pacification Zone, Security Zone, conducting precision strikes on various evil forces with great local public grievance and harming locality seriously. One aspect effectively manifesting Senate authority, supporting local government administrative work; Two is winning people's hearts; Third naturally is also taking this opportunity to obtain spoils of war.

In military operation aspect, decided to conduct National Army Third Batch Mobilization, training new National Army Squadrons in Hong Kong. According to current loss status, squadrons of first two waves were predicted to be exhausted in security warfare operations of recent months. Those squadrons performing well, combat power strong would undergo replenishment and refitting; squadrons with too large loss, combat record not outstanding would disband on spot then replenish other squadrons. Finally achieving standard configuration of one Squadron per County, one Battalion (Da Dui) per Prefecture City. Additionally deploying Mobile Squadrons at transportation key points.

Newly organized squadrons no longer equip standard spears, all using Nanyang Rifles. Mobile Squadrons change to use Minié Rifles and Shotguns, enhancing firepower. All Mobile Squadrons participate in mountain warfare training. Simultaneously recruiting new soldiers massively from Guangdong Yao people and Lang people (Zhuang) to enrich troops.

Construction aspect, determined to prioritize construction of two major projects and their supporting facilities: One is Foshan Steel, Two is Danzhou Chemical. Simultaneously launching "Guangdong Agricultural Reform Plan". To fully exert Guangdong's agricultural production potential.

Guangzhou Urban Construction Renovation also obtained passage. Originally proposed Senate and Regime Organs move north to Guangzhou comprehensively, but opposed due to limited Senator living supporting facilities and some Senators staying in Lingao to work worrying about being marginalized. Finally reached compromise plan. Newly set up Guangzhou Base Camp (Dai Hon Ei) as General Organ for Continental Construction, Administration and Strategy. Simultaneously decided Central Reserve Bank, Taxation General Bureau, Customs General Bureau, Monopoly Bureau move to Guangzhou entirely. Other departments set up offices in Guangzhou.

Obviously, this plan's tune lowered a lot compared to previous plan. Various plan arrangements also became pragmatic. Responsibles of various departments originally more or less burnt in head and smashed in brow (overwhelmed) secretly breathed a sigh of relief. The only one frowning tight was Finance-Tax Department.

Regarding the proposal of Going South to Acquire Resources proposed by Southward Advance Faction, finally also obtained partial passage. Although new draft didn't obtain direct resource support from the Senate as envisioned by Southward Advance Faction, according to principle of Not Giving Resources Giving Policy, the Senate approved renaming Southeast Asia Company to Nanyang Company, as First Class National Policy Mixed Ownership Enterprise. Nanyang Company has relatively large autonomy in operation, can raise shares freely, and can organize trade, mining and colonization actions autonomously in Southeast Asia regions.

All properties owned by original Southeast Asia Company, all injected as capital to new company. According to equity distribution, State Owned Share 51%, Senate 5%, Senator Personal Shareholding 15%, remaining 39% shares will be used for newly established "Southeast Asia Development Co., Ltd.", its shares will be sold in form of public offering in name of this company.
