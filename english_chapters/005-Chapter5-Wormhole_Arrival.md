# Chapter 5 - Wormhole Arrival

Chapter 5 Wormhole Arrival

The protagonist in this story, or one of the protagonists, is named Xiao Zishan.

Xiao Zishan was born in the late 70s and is an ordinary person: ordinary family, ordinary appearance, very ordinary natural endowments, and not a person willing to strive for progress. So his studies were very average. Benefiting from the university enrollment expansion, he also became a university student.

After Xiao Zishan graduated, he stayed in several companies in the Pearl River Delta, fell for the tricks of black-hearted bosses, dreamed unrealistic dreams, and finally managed to find a job with decent pay in a foreign enterprise, working diligently for wages - this work lasted for almost six or seven years. In a blink of an eye, he was thirty, and he still lived in someone else's house. He had no entertainment usually, just loved history and liked to read some unpopular books. However, when the story happened, he could hardly remember the face of his ex-girlfriend - he still belonged to the group of people who wanted to celebrate 11.11.

On the night of the beginning of our story, the weather was very bad. The pitch-black sky was constantly flashing with lightning - such days had lasted for almost half a month. Sometimes there would be heavy rain after lightning, sometimes there would be rolling thunder. Rumors of a big earthquake had spread for a long time, and people slowly became accustomed to them. Yawning, Xiao Zishan got off the bus, eyelids swollen, legs sore and soft, hair disheveled, a sloppy style of the working poor. He hadn't been home for a night and a day. As a newly promoted regional manager, in order to welcome the inspection from superiors, he had to make reports in the office for a long time, especially the whereabouts of expense reimbursements one after another, which really gave him a headache.

To say that Xiao is a parasite in the enterprise is a huge injustice. Xiao Zishan had formally taken this position for less than three months. During the six or seven years in this company, he had been circling in the basic position of regional sales representative. Leaders at all levels above him were cut like leeks one crop after another, but he existed like a leek root.

Three months ago, the leaders changed shifts again, leaving behind a pile of unexplained reports and invoices as usual. Only this time, he was appointed as the regional manager.

If this position was given two years earlier... he would definitely be grateful to the company with tears and mucus, but at this moment - Xiao Zishan just wanted to say to the leaders above, whether former or current: Grass Mud Horse (Fuck your mother).

The company under the global economic crisis had appeared hemiplegic since last year. Familiar colleagues in the regional office also disappeared one after another. The remaining business seemed leisurely for him to do alone. This appointment at this time did not mention adjusting the salary that had not moved for many years after promotion, nor did it give any instructions for developing business. With his seven or eight years of professional experience, it was not difficult to understand - this was a precursor to preparing to revoke the regional office. He was just a stay-behind person. Wait until all affairs were handled, he would have to pack up and leave.

But the documents still had to be done... just to collect that salary unchanged for many years for a few more months.

Xiao Zishan sighed for the twentieth time. He carried a large travel bag. From the bag itself to the things in the bag, all were promotional gifts preserved in the office over the years: from kitchen aprons, undershirts, toothbrushes to ballpoint pens, everything. They were all crude small commodities. Except for a few things, he basically couldn't use them. But he still greedily took them back - ambition is short when people are poor - this saying was really appropriate for him.

The rental room was fairly clean and tidy. After taking a shower, his spirit became excited instead. He casually turned on the computer and went online.

Orson Welles said that lottery is the painkiller for the poor, so the internet is the source of happiness for people like Xiao Zishan. Whether it is online games or BBS, or the web novels he reads every day.

Before working, Xiao Zishan was considered half a literary youth. He read a lot of miscellaneous books without digesting them thoroughly, and also liked to play with writing, but his talent was limited, and he didn't make a living from words.

He also regularly visited several BBS. In fact, he was not a prominent figure in the forum, but the various miscellaneous information, theories and knowledge provided in the BBS, various debates, quarrels, colorful human nature, even the performance of certain hypocrites, were much more interesting than the workplace full of masks.

Going on BBS, check today's hot posts first as usual.

"I found a wormhole leading to the Ming Dynasty! Absolutely true!"

Seeing this title, Xiao Zishan couldn't help but laugh dumbly. In these years, do people become silly reading time-travel novels? Or are they dissatisfied with their own situation and eager to go to another world to start anew?

Looking again, he found the post was by President Wen. Speaking of which, President Wen was one of the "survival maniacs" Xiao Zishan admired on this BBS. Not to mention his extensive knowledge, the delicacy of his considerations on time travel and survival issues was rare. Regrettably, President Wen didn't write time-travel novels, otherwise Xiao Zishan would definitely follow his novels - of course only read pirated copies.

"It must be some new whimsical idea of President Wen again." Xiao Zishan clicked the post casually. With this click, his world changed accordingly.

To put it in a cliché, that is "the wheel of fate began to turn".

One week later.

"This is the wormhole?" Xiao Zishan looked cautiously at the luminous body in front of him. Strictly speaking, this was an irregular circle with slightly blue light. It was not much different from the wormhole in his imagination. The difference was that the light was not strong, and the size was much smaller, only as big as a mirror in the bathroom.

"It's very small." Wang Luobin said. Like Xiao Zishan, he was also one of the first batch of people who decided to come and see after communicating with President Wen.

"Applying certain pressure on the edge can expand it." Wen Desi sat on the lid of the flush toilet. It seemed a bit crowded with three people stuffed in the bathroom. "This hole opening can be expanded or contracted, as long as a certain force is applied symmetrically in the diameter direction. The expansion and contraction of the hole opening are synchronous in the two space-times." Wen Desi explained, "When the hole opening is shrunk to 210mm, the wormhole will close and cannot connect space-time."

"Can it really travel back and forth?" In Xiao Zishan's impression, time travel was one-way, basically either being hit by a car or struck by lightning. The gentlest was getting lost. The general characteristic was going without return.

"If I couldn't come back, I couldn't have posted, and you wouldn't be here." He said, "I estimate that the location after crossing should be consistent with the place where the crossing occurred."

"You should go buy lottery tickets, President Wen." Xiao Zishan muttered to himself, "Finding a wormhole in the bathroom has a lower probability than winning the jackpot."

"This doesn't count as a jackpot?" Wen Desi laughed with satisfaction, "Is there a lottery ticket that can win you a world?"

"President Wen, didn't you always say: Single person, two-way, low-profile time travel is the king's way." Wang Luobin remembered the discussion about time travel on the BBS back then.

"That's right." Wen Desi pointed at the wormhole, "Do you know what's behind that? It's a world!" He waved his arms excitedly, "Through it, I can possess an Earth, a universe!"

"You alone conquer the world?" Xiao Zishan expressed serious doubt.

"That's why I posted that post..." Wen Desi seemed unwilling, "Besides, the opposite side is not a pleasant space-time."

"What space-time?"

"Probably the Tianqi era. I found Tianqi Tongbao coins."

Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin both sucked in a breath of cold air - the new world President Wen found was an era where eunuchs ran rampant.
