# Chapter 125: Guangzhou Trip (Part 1)

Xiao Zishan returned from Guangzhou.

The Guangzhou trip wasn't for selling goods and earning silver—quite the opposite. They were a standard "Purchasing Delegation to Sheep City," carrying an extensive procurement list on which every department had enumerated its urgent needs. The largest single item was pig iron.

Hainan had China's best and largest high-grade iron ore deposits, but whether at Tiandu or Shilu, the transmigrators currently couldn't develop either. Moreover, Hainan as a coal and iron complex had a fatal problem: there was no coal.

An industrializing nation's rise often crucially depended on establishing coal and iron complexes. Britain becoming the first industrialized nation was largely due to abundant iron ore and coal deposits existing simultaneously. America had the Great Lakes—not just paired resources but also cheap water transport. Russia had the Urals; Germany, the Ruhr. The Committee had only understood this on paper—but upon actually attempting to build an industrial base in Lingao, they realized that without solving the steel issue, industrialization was just empty talk. They had brought complete equipment sets, machine tools, and measuring instruments; built power generation; and produced cement—yet they were stuck on steel. Without the most basic wire rod rebar, even ordinary reinforced concrete slabs, steel nails, or hammers were impossible. Although the ship held tons of steel ingots, they were all special steels they couldn't produce in the short term, so nobody dared touch them.

The Industrial Committee's main group leaders decided that since ore development was currently impossible, they would skip the blast furnace stage and start with steelmaking! Regardless of quality, they would produce the crude steel in the highest daily demand. Steelmaking required large quantities of pig iron, so they would try first to purchase it from Guangdong.

Pig iron could serve as steelmaking material and was useful in itself, as many bulky components could be cast from it. The Metallurgy Group's procurement list called for 50 tons of pig iron—supposedly the bare minimum. With their small converters—even running just the smallest one-ton unit, 50 tons wouldn't last a month.

On paper, this was entirely feasible. Ming-era Guangdong's pig iron production was staggering. Based on the Jiajing 13 (1534) Guangdong Provincial Administration's iron tax records, the estimated annual output was 6,127,500 *jin*—about 3,100 tons. To the modern perspective, 3,100 tons was a small mill's output for a few days—but in 1670, Russia's total steel production was only 2,700-some tons. The transmigrators' early steel industry, built on imported pig iron, had some foundation.

*(Note: Steel production figures are heavily debated. This is purely novelistic—don't take it literally.)*

But for Xiao Zishan, things weren't that simple. Though knowing nothing about steel, he knew economic history. In Ming-era Guangdong Province, probably no single ironworks had 50 ready tons to purchase. Most likely, he'd have to scrounge everywhere. After scrounging, how would he ship them out? Xiao Zishan vaguely recalled that pig iron was prohibited from export. Loading 50 tons onto a ship—what would the officials do if they found out? It was all headache-inducing.

Headaches or not, tasks had to be completed. Besides procurement, this expedition aimed to establish a Guangzhou intelligence network—penetrating Guangdong's wealthy merchant and even official circles. Therefore, the personnel were formidable. Besides himself as the overall commander, Xi Yazhou was originally scheduled to accompany them as a military affairs specialist, but his salt village mass mobilization work couldn't be interrupted. Bei Wei was pulled from the salt village instead. Xiao Zishan thought this was also fine—having a recon soldier as a bodyguard was reassuring anywhere. Bei Wei brought four of his best recon squad trainees—this Guangzhou trip would serve as their graduation assessment.

Also accompanying them were several personnel preparing to establish the Guangzhou forward station. Yan Maoda, formerly a jewelry company manager, specialized in luxury goods. His proposal to the Committee was to use the existing Guangzhou property to open a luxury goods trading house as a cover base. Such trading houses had several advantages: first, they required substantial capital, so large cash flows and personnel movements wouldn't arouse suspicion; second, the clientele were wealthy families' wives and daughters, providing easy access to "enemy" inner circles; third, the building could be openly fortified.

Lu Rong had just returned from Li minority territory and immediately joined the expedition. He fluently spoke multiple southern dialects, casually read classical Chinese texts like *Guwen Guanzhi* and *Wenxuan*, wrote passable brush calligraphy, was physically robust, and knew horsemanship and martial arts—making him suitable for covert deployment.

Another key figure was Guo Yi. His assignment stemmed from the fact that everyone's understanding of covert operations came from movies and novels—he was the only one with actual experience. One transfer order later, Guo Yi found himself promoted from Security Group errand boy to Forward Station Chief, traveling to Ming-era Guangzhou for espionage work. This reminded him of life's unpredictability: barely three months ago, in another timeline's Guangzhou, he'd been doing counter-espionage...

Besides a dozen-plus transmigrators, some locals were needed. Returning Bairren production team workers were either Lingao natives or Fujian seasonal migrants—many had never even visited the prefectural capital, let alone Guangzhou. The Gou Manor prisoners included Guangdong natives, but vetting wasn't complete, so they couldn't be rashly used. The breakthrough came from the salt village.

Salt Village Vice-Chairman Tan Guihuang (the Chairman was his cousin Tan Guiqiong) learned the short-hair masters needed reliable companions for Guangzhou and recommended the Leizhou salt merchant Liu Gang.

Liu Gang, due to salt trading, had close ties with the salt village. When Tan Guihuang crossed the strait to recruit salt merchants, Liu Gang was the first to come—even bringing urgently needed grain and cloth. Tan Guihuang felt this man was loyal and dependable. Moreover, though settled in Leizhou, he was a genuine Nanhai County native from Guangzhou Prefecture and frequently traded around Guangzhou. He knew the routes well. He was an ideal companion. When Tan Guihuang mentioned this, Liu Gang readily agreed—refusal wasn't an option. Word had spread: these short-hairs were the salt village's backers—they'd eliminated the salt field's overlord, Landlord Gou. Such power—no seasoned merchant dared offend them.

Transport would be by ship—the fastest and most convenient method. This expedition carried considerable cargo: beyond the necessary provisions, weapons, and silver, it also carried radio equipment, hand-crank generators, solar panels, and other gear for the intelligence station. Plus, there were various merchandise samples seeking Guangzhou buyers—the fencing the Gou Manor couldn't complete, they'd now handle.

However, the transmigrators' ships were too conspicuous. Whichever one they sailed would cause a sensation. It was better to stay low-key. Tan Guihuang was asked to purchase a "Lingao towing sail" from local fishing masters. This 22-meter, 78-ton vessel was a genuine large fishing boat—perfectly adequate for short-range Guangzhou trading.

*(Note: The Lingao towing sail is a famous traditional Hainan fishing boat, though its appearance was relatively recent.)*

With a ship, they needed sailors. Ordinary people couldn't handle this large sailing vessel. Among the transmigrators, such talent was scarce. Wu De, though a fisherman, had grown up on motorized boats. Finally, Lin Chuanqing volunteered as captain. This fisherman-turned-smuggler's guide could handle all maritime work. Several sailing enthusiasts from the North American contingent then became sailors.

The North American faction had found no positions since arriving. Qian Shuiting, being in survey statistics, was assigned to the Planning Committee working with numbers. Qian Shuixie and Zhou Weisen served in the Military Group, where daily guard duty drove them crazy. This was unlike Lin Shenhe, who after shifts could hang out at the Machinery Group developing weapons. Hearing the Guangzhou trip needed sailors, they all volunteered—partly for recreation. The group also schemed: they'd brought personal weapons and pulled Lin Shenhe along, planning to try piracy at sea.

Lin Chuanqing was no saint either. They hit it off—planning to act when opportunity arose.

There was one difficulty: piracy required skill. The Lingao towing sail was a hard-sail ship; these 21st-century sailing enthusiasts knew soft-sail techniques. Though trial runs had taught them the basics, proficiency was uncertain. After discussion, they approached Xiao Zishan: for easier operation and safety—after all, coastal Guangdong was unsafe—it was best to retrofit the ship to motor-sail. The North Americans knew Xiao Zishan was extremely cautious, especially regarding personal safety. This proposal was immediately approved. The Industrial Group was authorized to retrofit this hard-sail vessel—adding two 12 kW single-cylinder diesel engines from Changchai. They'd brought many of these—simple structure, easy maintenance, and extremely versatile. Except for aircraft engines, these could power almost anything.
