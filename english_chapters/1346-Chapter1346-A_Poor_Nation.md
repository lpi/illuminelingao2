# Chapter 1346 - A Poor Nation, An Impoverished People

After much deliberation, the Commerce Bureau concluded that besides the most-demanded Hongyi cannons, probably only armor could truly make Huang Taiji willing to sell his kidney.

According to Ming literati notes, blacksmith shops stretched for several *li* outside Shenyang city, all manufacturing armor and weapons for the military. Armor all had to pass arrow-shot testing; any penetration meant death for the craftsman who made it. Though the transmigrators doubted whether this practice was universal, Later Jin's strictness on weapon manufacturing quality was real.

Obviously, the industrial system under Council control, though primitive by modern or even early modern standards, possessed incomparable quality and cost advantages in the seventeenth century. Manufacturing armor with better protection than Manchu Qing's, lighter, and at lower cost was no problem.

Generally speaking, the armor the Council planned to export was a plate armor manufactured by stamping process, with articulated joints. Such armor could be made in ancient societies, but limited by material performance and processing methods, it required skilled craftsmen spending enormous labor hours, thus was expensive and limited in deployment.

The Council's industrial system had advantages in both materials and production. Continuous stamping technology enabled batch standardized manufacture of all component plates, requiring only simple hand assembly for finished products. And improved steel quality meant plate thickness needn't be excessive, making armor lighter—yet protective performance exceeded all current Ming-Qing armor.

Weapons trade had been a hugely profitable black-market business since ancient times. The Council had always wanted to be a seventeenth-century arms dealer. There'd been early consideration of exporting cannon factories to Li Luoyu, but that was killed by some transmigrators' objections against "exporting productivity and technology," so weapons export was limited to finished products—and only products with a generational disparity.

Standard spears, machetes, half-plate armor, and Nanyang-pattern percussion cap muskets were all products of this guiding philosophy. As for smoothbore cannons, there was considerable controversy, and they weren't yet on the exportable list.

Originally the Council had tried to use Li Luoyu as a white glove, but long-term observation led External Intelligence Bureau to this conclusion: though this man had made considerable dirty money smuggling with the Manchu Qing, selling military hardware was something he absolutely refused to do.

Everyone had their own feelings and lines. Li Luoyu was apparently that type. Though his smuggling for the Manchu Qing was essentially aiding the enemy, he needed something to comfort himself with—otherwise it would be hard to face his own "conscience."

Li Luoyu's non-cooperation meant the Council could only send Huang Hua personally. His mission was very dangerous—so dangerous that many transmigrators questioned whether he could even return, whether trade with Later Jin was worth a transmigrator taking such risk. But Huang Hua himself had stated repeatedly at hearings that this was his personal wish; he was willing to take this risk, even at the cost of his life.

"Besides, two countries at war still don't kill envoys. I'm a merchant bringing goods they desperately need—why would they kill me?" Huang Hua was full of confidence.

That said, External Intelligence Bureau remained very worried about his first mission. They'd considered having him go simply as a "merchant" leading a trading company to Shenyang. But considering that Later Jin's Manchu officials mostly came from crude backgrounds, priding themselves on violence and brutality, and because of past hard times, were extremely greedy—historically, when Korea's crown prince was held hostage in Shenyang, he was constantly extorted by Manchu officials and their bondservants, causing the Yi Dynasty no end of grief. Every time Manchu Qing delegations and trading companies went to Korea for trade, their behavior en route was no different from bandits, forcing the Yi Dynasty to exempt the five cities along the route to Anju from taxation as compensation—if not for Huang Taiji exercising some restraint as a far-sighted ruler, they'd have done anything without limits.

Even if Huang Taiji and Manchu Qing's high command recognized Huang Hua's importance, crude lower and middle officials and nobles might rashly kill and rob the trading company for its goods. Thus it was ultimately decided to conduct trade in an "official-to-official" mode rather than sending a trading company directly.

Since the new year, Huang Taiji had stayed in Shengjing handling state affairs. He hadn't gone on a hunt—yet hunting for the Manchu Qing regime wasn't merely entertainment for the upper class, or the more politically correct "military training." It was an important source of state revenue. The large quantities of meat and furs obtained through hunts were indispensable to Later Jin.

He was born in 1592, now in his prime. Though beginning to put on weight, his build was sturdy and he was full of vigor, with a ruddy complexion and clear, spirited eyes. His enterprise was entering its phase of flourishing prosperity.

When Huang Taiji had inherited the throne, the Later Jin regime had actually fallen into decline. Economically dependent mainly on plunder, with large-scale regression to slave plantation systems, plus the severe cold of the Little Ice Age, agricultural production had plummeted. Upper echelons were riven with factional strife; lower and middle ranks, unable to obtain satisfactory war booty distributions, with even fallen armored bannermen receiving only a few blood-stained garments stripped from corpses as compensation—all harbored resentment. Combat effectiveness had begun declining. Not to mention the Manchu-Han contradictions under Old Wild Boar Skin's rule had reached extreme heights, nearly executing even early Qing defector ironclads like Li Yongfang and Fan Wencheng—Han officials all walking on eggshells.

If not for the near-bug existence of Huang Taiji taking the throne, Manchu Qing's future in history books might well have been just a flash-in-the-pan local regime.

After years of dedicated governance, he had pulled the Later Jin regime back from the brink of collapse. Though the impoverished state of nation and people hadn't fundamentally improved, it was much better than when they'd had to kill people to reduce food consumers.

A few years back, his first raid into China proper had yielded rich returns—not only countless plunder and captives, relieving state finances and Banner soldiers' complaints, but also revealing the Southern Court's true colors. The Great Ming was nothing special! The thought of "restoring the Great Jin, watering horses at the Yellow River" had first entered his mind.

In the political infighting of Later Jin's upper echelons, he'd successfully eliminated the influence of heavyweight rivals like Amin and Manggūltai. Last year in the first month, he'd finally changed the old system where the Three Great Princes sat beside him equally, to having himself sit facing south alone while the other Three Great Princes sat to the side. Truly becoming the supreme ruler.

This moment was when Huang Taiji's life was entering its glorious phase—so whether in action or conversation, he showed complete confidence and ambition.

But there were still many problems facing him. Externally, though he'd seen through the Southern Court's paper-tiger nature, a centipede dies but doesn't stiffen; drinking horses at the Yellow River would take time. To the east, though the Dongjiang Army had weakened itself through infighting, it remained a thorn in his side; Korea continued secretly corresponding with the Southern Court. To the west, the Chahar Mongols hadn't yet fully submitted.

Internally, the state's poverty was always an inescapable shadow. Though they'd stopped pushing the estate system so hard and grain production had somewhat improved, producing more grain on this bitter cold land remained difficult. Grain prices stayed expensive. As the Khan of Heaven's Mandate, he could eat Liaoyang Green—an excellent dry rice grown in the estates outside Shengjing—at every meal. But ordinary princes and nobles could only enjoy it on holidays. Lesser commoners even ate barnyard millet as their staple. For this, they had to spend vast silver buying grain from Shanxi merchants at prices ten times or more what it cost inside the passes. The gold and silver plundered from inside the passes flowed right back into Shanxi merchants' hands.

Beyond grain, the country lacked almost every daily necessity; everything was expensive. Even salt and fermented sauce, the most basic food items, couldn't be reliably supplied: the Jurchens didn't know salt-making. Cut off from supplies inside the passes, they relied entirely on Korean merchants' sales—besides outrageous prices, supply was often interrupted. So that having access to salt and sauce was already upper-class.

Until the state's finances could be resolved and people's livelihood improved, his grand ambitions were just mirages. This had been troubling Huang Taiji lately.

Another incursion to plunder wasn't a bad option, but currently the situation wasn't stable. Besides external threats, though Manggūltai had been demoted from Great Prince to common prince rank, his house's power remained formidable, always posing a comeback threat...

Just as he was lost in thought, a memorial arrived from the Board of Revenue. He opened it to find a report on the recent trading mission to Uiju with Korea. Trading with Korea was one of Later Jin's most important economic sources—not only did Later Jin depend on Korea for many goods, but they also needed to re-export Korean goods to trade with Mongolia for good horses. So Huang Taiji paid close attention to every Korean trade mission, personally inquiring about each one.

But Korea was very cold toward trade with Later Jin. On one hand, the Yi Dynasty still considered the Great Ming as the legitimate court, maintaining the distinction between Chinese and barbarian, and was unwilling to ally with Later Jin. On the other hand, Later Jin in trade often acted the victor, bullying at every turn, forcing purchases and sales, buying cheap and selling dear, even demanding "credit." When they'd first traded with Korea in 1629, a Korean merchant had brought 3,000 *shi* of grain to sell—2,000 were "gifted," only 1,000 actually sold. So Korean merchants were all reluctant to trade with them.

Huang Taiji naturally knew about his subordinates' various "actions," but he turned a blind eye—this small court of Later Jin was simply too impoverished. They could only rely on their big fists to squeeze Korea, this soft persimmon.

A few days ago, the trading party he'd sent to Korea had just returned from Uiju, bringing 1,600 *jin* of ginseng, asking 16 *taels* per *jin*, but Korea only offered 9 *taels*—a difference of 11,200 *taels*. This price was far below his expectations. He'd hoped this silver could buy more goods.

Even more displeasing was that goods purchased from Korea were often substandard, short in weight. One bolt of cotton cloth was cut into two or three pieces and sold as separate bolts; one roll of paper had six or seven sheets removed—hard to detect without careful checking.
