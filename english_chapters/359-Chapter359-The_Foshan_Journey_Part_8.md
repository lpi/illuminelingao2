# Chapter 359 - The Foshan Journey (Part 8)

The interior was indeed even more impressive. The main hall was divided into front and back sections by a screen. In front was a spacious, magnificent parlor for receiving and entertaining customers, with tea tables shaped like flower petals, where a dozen or more customers were seated. Servants bustled in and out with tea and refreshments in constant rotation. The center featured several tall incense burners, from which sandalwood smoke rose in spiraling threads.

Behind the screen was the dispensary. A large signboard hung overhead: "Genuine Medicinals, Fair Prices, No Deception." A row of counters stretched from wall to wall, where half a dozen shop assistants in identical blue cotton jackets were weighing medicines and wrapping prescriptions. Two more sat at elevated seats with large brass cash boxes before them—the head clerks handling payments. Behind the counters, drawers and cabinets extended upward nearly to the ceiling, each labeled with the name of a medicine.

Compared to the few customers at Runshitang, this place was doing brisk business. Liu San counted: there were more than twenty customers in the hall, not including those bringing prescriptions for filling.

Yang Shixiang apparently enjoyed some status here. As soon as he stepped inside, someone went to report his arrival. Shortly, an elderly man came out to greet them—apparently a senior clerk. He led them through a side door and down a corridor to a small courtyard, where they entered a small reception room. Liu San looked around and saw that the furnishings were quite refined—clearly this was a place to receive important guests.

After a short wait, a middle-aged man wearing a round-collared silk robe strode in. He had a square face, thick eyebrows, and a manner that exuded authority—clearly someone accustomed to being in charge.

"Fifth Brother!" This was Yang Shiyi, the current owner of Yang Runkai Hall and Yang Shixiang's first cousin.

"Elder Brother!" Yang Shixiang rose and bowed formally.

After exchanging greetings and introductions, Yang Shiyi asked about their purpose. Yang Shixiang explained that he had come to purchase medicinal ingredients.

"What medicines do you need, Fifth Brother?"

"I'm making summer medicines—Plague-Repelling Powder and Zhuge Marching Powder. I need musk, ox gallstones, borneol, pearls, gold leaf, realgar..." Yang Shixiang listed the ingredients one by one.

Yang Shiyi's expression changed subtly as he listened. When Yang Shixiang finished, he said slowly: "Fifth Brother, these are all rare and expensive ingredients. With wars raging in Liaodong and the Jurchen barbarians causing trouble, many goods from beyond the passes can't get through. Prices have risen tremendously. Even our Yang Runkai Hall is feeling the pinch."

"I understand prices have risen. But Elder Brother, I've come prepared with silver."

"It's not just about silver." Yang Shiyi shook his head. "Right now, the most sought-after goods are being snatched up as soon as they arrive. Even if you have silver, you might not find what you need. Let me check the warehouse inventory—we might not have everything you need."

Liu San observed this exchange. Yang Shiyi's attitude was clearly evasive. Though he spoke of shortages, his expression suggested otherwise. It seemed like he was deliberately making things difficult for his cousin.

Yang Shixiang's face showed disappointment but no surprise—apparently this wasn't unexpected.

"Elder Brother, if the goods are truly unavailable, there's nothing to be done. But if they exist, I hope Elder Brother won't refuse family business."

"Of course, of course. We're family after all." Yang Shiyi nodded perfunctorily. "Let me have someone check the warehouse. You wait here; I'll send word shortly."

After Yang Shiyi left, Liu San asked quietly: "What's going on?"

Yang Shixiang sighed. "Elder Brother has always been this way. He looks down on our branch of the family and has never been willing to help. I expected this."

"But you brought enough silver this time..."

"Silver alone isn't enough to move him." Yang Shixiang shook his head bitterly. "In his eyes, our little Runshitang is barely worth noticing. Why would he bother helping us?"

Liu San thought for a moment, then reached into his robe and produced a Delong Bank note—a fifty-tael bill.

"Perhaps this will help change his mind."

Yang Shixiang looked at the strange piece of paper. "What is this?"

"A Delong Bank draft. It can be exchanged for silver at any Delong affiliate." Liu San explained the new banking system briefly. "I happen to know that Yang Runkai Hall is one of Delong's affiliates."

Yang Shixiang's eyes widened. "If this is true..."

"It's true. Why don't you present this to your elder brother? Perhaps his attitude will change."

Shortly after, Yang Shiyi returned. His expression was apologetic.

"Fifth Brother, I've checked the warehouse. I'm afraid we're quite short on several items—"

Yang Shixiang interrupted by producing the Delong Bank note. "Elder Brother, please take a look at this."

Yang Shiyi glanced at it casually, then froze. His eyes fixed on the note, and his entire demeanor changed.

"This is... a Delong Bank note?"

"Yes. I believe Yang Runkai Hall can honor it?"

"Of course, of course!" Yang Shiyi's voice had become noticeably warmer. "Fifth Brother, you should have said so earlier. Delong Bank's drafts are as good as silver—better, actually, for large transactions. Please, let me check the warehouse again. I'm sure we can find everything you need."

He hurried out, his attitude completely transformed.

Liu San and Yang Shixiang exchanged knowing looks. Money truly talked—especially when it came in a novel, impressive form.

When Yang Shiyi returned, he was all smiles. "Good news, Fifth Brother! We do have most of what you need in stock. A few items are running low, but I can procure them from other sources within a few days. Will you be staying in Foshan long?"

"A week or two."

"Excellent! I'll have everything ready for you. And Fifth Brother—" He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "If you have access to these Delong drafts, we should talk more. There may be opportunities for... deeper cooperation."

After the meeting, as they walked back through the grand pharmacy, Yang Shixiang marveled at the change.

"Remarkable. Just one slip of paper, and his entire attitude reversed."

"That's the power of credit and reputation," Liu San said. "Delong Bank has built trust rapidly. Anyone carrying their notes is automatically considered creditworthy. Your brother is a businessman—he knows an opportunity when he sees one."

"But what advantage does he gain from accepting these notes?"

"Affiliates earn fees on transactions. More importantly, he sees you differently now. You're no longer the poor relation from Lingao—you're someone with connections to a powerful new financial institution."

Yang Shixiang nodded slowly, beginning to understand. The transmigrators' influence extended far beyond their military might or their strange goods. Their financial innovations were reshaping how business was conducted throughout the region.
