# Chapter 2008 - Public Humiliation

Du Yibin looked at the few patients with slight disappointment. He had assumed that since they could work as prostitutes, they must have at least some good looks. But these few could only be described as plain-featured, even coarse.

The hair that had been shaved off during purification had grown back somewhat. They wore indigo-blue "reform clothing"—mostly old uniforms and work clothes retired from military units and factories, patched and dyed before being issued. This was also the standard attire at the "purification camps."

Du Yibin naturally knew that due to differences in nutrition levels and aesthetic standards in this time period, women who met modern standards of beauty were rare. But this level was too far below expectations.

Seeing an "Elder" arrive, the few patients made themselves scarce—they weren't yet used to the Council of Elders' etiquette and rules.

Lu Cheng asked if he wished to inspect the dormitories. Du Yibin shook his head. His intention was to look at the people; he didn't care about the "prostitute reform" work itself.

"Let's go take a look at the workshop then."

The workshop was set up in the back two longhouses. These two buildings had higher frameworks. Though the roofs were also covered with reed mats, they were quite "extravagantly" fitted with multiple skylights, making the interior well-lit. The walls had more windows than the dormitories, providing good ventilation and lighting. These windows were all fitted with glass—the most extravagant building material in these structures.

Du Yibin recalled that when he'd first gone to the farm to "settle down," the dormitories for the farm workers had been about this level. One year a typhoon hit and blew them all away.

The floor was compacted earth, with many bamboo-topped tables arranged on it. Piles of various cloth materials and cut garment pieces were stacked on them. Some female students were mending clothes, others were folding and packing—they all seemed busy.

As soon as Lu Cheng entered, a large, solidly-built female naturalized cadre immediately came over, her face beaming: "Director Lu... Director Lu... Deputy Director Mao... Oh my... And there's also... an Elder... gracing us with his presence, this is, this is, this is..."

She strained to think of some flattering phrase, but with her limited vocabulary, after struggling for a while she finally managed: "This illuminates the whole place!"

"Alright, alright," Du Yibin was particularly uncomfortable with this kind of fawning from naturalized citizens. "I'm just here to observe the female students' learning situation. No need to make a fuss." Seeing she was about to blow her whistle, he stopped her: "Don't have them stop work. I'm just looking. Nothing to say."

However, this commotion had already caused a small stir in the workshop. The female students curiously sized up this newly arrived young man. From the respectful demeanor of the cadres beside him, they could probably tell this must be a "big official"—most likely an "Elder." Prostitutes' ability to read expressions exceeded that of ordinary people.

"An official's come!"

"Probably an Australian Elder."

"Look at his clothes—so crisp and neat."

"He's a handsome one."

...

Seeing the students whispering among themselves and pointing, Du Yibin naturally knew they were discussing him. He could now understand a few sentences of Cantonese. He was young, and his daily life had been a two-point line between the farm and the computing center. His face was far thinner-skinned than other Elders. Back when he'd even gone to draw lots for a life secretary, he'd done it sneakily. Now, being stared at by several hundred pairs of female eyes, he felt uncomfortable all over. He forced himself to appear calm, cleared his throat, and said: "Give me a briefing."

"Yes." Lu Cheng said the Jiliang Institute had a total of four hundred and eighty students, all prostitutes rescued during the public morality rectification campaign. A portion were assigned by the Guangzhou Comprehensive Governance Office to work outside, doing various odd jobs around the city, returning at night. The rest worked inside the Jiliang Institute, washing and mending clothes and processing semi-finished products sent from the garment factory for outsourced work.

"This is the sewing workshop. Mainly for sewing buttons and shoulder loops on uniforms and work clothes. And sewing shoe uppers."

"Is there compensation?"

"Yes, they're on piece-rate. Settled monthly in circulation vouchers. Though basic living expenses are deducted first. This helps build their work consciousness."

Du Yibin thought this seemed rather stingy. He looked around at the students in the room. At first glance, he could barely distinguish their features or ages. They all seemed similar to the patients he'd seen outside. He couldn't say whether they were good-looking or plain, though their complexions seemed healthy enough.

"What about age distribution?"

"When they arrived, ages ranged from twelve to sixty. They've already been sorted—those under eighteen were transferred to the purification camp in Hong Kong. Those remaining here are mainly between eighteen and fifty, with the twenty-five to forty age group being the largest. Few are over fifty."

"There are still fifty and sixty-year-olds?!" Du Yibin was astonished. He found it hard to believe and hesitated: "Also... entertaining clients?"

"What choice do they have?" Lu Cheng, seeing his particularly surprised expression, thought this young Elder was rather naive. "Quite a few of those type were sent here. Some even had venereal diseases..."

"That's fucked up!" he cursed. "What's the venereal disease situation?"

"Very prevalent." Lu Cheng explained that because the prostitutes housed here were mostly lower-tier, servicing at least four or five clients daily—some even over a dozen—venereal and gynecological diseases were widespread.

"...After treatment, most have recovered. Some are still under treatment..."

"Those people need to be excluded—they can't be on the list."

Lu Cheng, not understanding what this cryptic instruction meant, just vaguely answered "Yes."

But he was quite satisfied with the age distribution. The eligible population was larger and younger than the "single women." Though one couldn't call their looks "beautiful," at least they didn't have the perpetually worried expressions of the "single women." It was just that these habits needed fixing—all this whispering back and forth, no discipline at all...

What had been whispered discussions in low voices now grew louder and louder, occasionally erupting in snickers. Some students near him ignored the glares of Lu Cheng and the others, even deliberately posing and preening at him, making Du Yibin extremely embarrassed.

...

"Look at that expression—he's green."

"Could he be a virgin?"

"Then doing business with him, wouldn't we have to give him a lucky fee instead..."

"I'd be willing to pay that lucky fee!"

"With your haggard looks, you think you can serve an Elder?"

"Hee, you don't know? The Australians love big tits best. My tits are the biggest. Here, feel them..."

...

The remarks grew not only louder but cruder. Lu Cheng had been frowning, and now her anger surged. She'd been stationed here for months and had taken plenty of grief from these women. She grabbed her whistle and blew hard, shouting at the crowd: "Silence!"

The crowd quieted somewhat. Lu Cheng addressed the self-proclaimed "biggest tits" student with a rebuke: "Bian Cuibao! What nonsense are you spouting again?! No discipline at all!"

But Bian Cuibao wouldn't back down: "I said my tits are big. What rule did I break?"

This was practically sophistry, but Lu Cheng couldn't immediately find fault with it.

"The Elder is speaking, and you're chattering down there?!"

"Director Lu, please be fair! Just now this Elder was only asking you questions. He didn't tell us to stop work and listen to instructions. We sisters are working—can't we joke around a bit when we're tired? Besides, how was I supposed to know he's an Elder? You didn't tell us."

Lu Cheng was momentarily speechless, because she indeed hadn't ordered everyone to stop work and listen, nor had she introduced Du Yibin's identity.

Bian Cuibao was sharp-tongued and bold by nature. She was quite famous among the students, frequently clashing verbally with Jiliang Institute cadres—a notorious "troublemaker."

Lu Cheng, furious beyond reason, shouted: "Bian Cuibao, come out here!"

At this shout, the entire workshop fell silent. Bian Cuibao's few die-hard friends all had their hearts in their throats. These past days, they'd figured out the mentality of the Jiliang Institute cadres. They knew the Australians valued the Jiliang Institute greatly and wouldn't easily "dismiss people." Talking back meant at most a caning, at worst a few days in the dark room.

Beatings they didn't fear at all—they'd been beaten three times daily before. Compared to the torture methods under the madams, the Australians' thin cane strokes really were just like scratching an itch. Being locked up with reduced rations wasn't pleasant, but at least they didn't have to work until their hands ached and eyes blurred.

But today there was an Australian here—a much, much bigger official than Lu Cheng!

Seeing that an Elder was present today, Bian Cuibao felt somewhat afraid. But she'd played the tough girl in front of her sisters so long that she didn't want to lose face. She steeled herself and came forward. Glancing over, she saw the young Elder showed no anger but rather looked at her with great interest. Her mood for mischief rose again, and she approached Lu Cheng with a cheeky grin.

"Look at yourself—truly shameless!" Lu Cheng scolded loudly. "This isn't a brothel! Put away that whorish manner of yours! Guards!" she called. "Take her away..."

Before she finished speaking, Bian Cuibao laughed: "Don't trouble anyone. It's just a caning, isn't it?" She yanked her pants down, flopped onto a table, stuck out her behind and said: "Go ahead."

The whole room erupted. The students below burst into uproarious laughter. Lu Weijia and Mao Xiuyu had apparently seen this behavior before and just turned their faces away, pretending not to notice. Lu Cheng, seeing this woman act so shamelessly, publicly humiliating her in front of an Elder—her face went deathly pale, feeling like she could stab this woman to death.

The female cadre supervising reacted quickly. She dashed forward in one stride, grabbed a piece of cloth and threw it over Bian Cuibao's body, shouting: "Are you all dead? Help out!"

Several activist students nearby snapped out of it and rushed over, pinning Bian Cuibao down firmly. One student squatted down and, under cover of the cloth, pulled her pants back up.

"Tie her up!" Lu Cheng's face was iron-grey. "Ten days in solitary confinement!"
