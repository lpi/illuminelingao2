# Chapter 621 - The Suppression Campaign Strategy

"The Fubo Army didn't inherit from a mature military system," He Ming seemed somewhat unsure how to express himself. "It's an army without tradition, without history. Lacking..." He paused to consider. "A soul."

"I think Young Wei is doing quite well with political education..."

"This isn't about political education. That's not what I mean." He Ming shook his head. "You've also been a soldier. You should understand what I mean. The Fubo Army's organizational model and tactics—including Wei Aiwen's political education—are all copied by us. No matter how well-trained, it's still just an 'armed force.' Only an army that has shed blood and fought real battles on the battlefield will have its own soul."

"You're worrying too much."

"Heh, all the capital that everyone accumulated bit by bit from nothing over three years has suddenly been placed in my hands. How can I not be afraid?" He Ming said.

Victory in this battle was a foregone conclusion—the technological and temporal advantages were so great. But if there was the slightest setback, public opinion in Parliament would turn against him. Wu De understood his thinking.

"The question is, when the fighting actually starts, can the road renovation be completed?"

"Of course it can't be finished. We'll extend the road as far as we can. Even extending it one more meter toward Qiongshan County reduces our logistical pressure. The ultimate purpose of building roads is for governance," He Ming said.

"If the enemy really takes as long as some predict—the Ming forces won't attack until October—this road might actually reach Qiongshan County city."

"The Ming forces might not come that late. We should still try to overestimate the enemy," He Ming said.

The Planning Institute evaluated the plan for road construction beyond their territory. According to estimates from the General Staff and Foreign Intelligence Bureau, Chengmai itself lacked the strength to resist cross-border road construction. Simply renovating the post road wouldn't disturb local people or conflict with their interests. On the contrary, the road construction team could expand influence through local employment of laborers and purchase of materials.

The officials in Chengmai County wouldn't welcome such activity, but they also wouldn't organize forces to attack—everyone knew that leading a few hundred village militia and garrison soldiers to attack the Australians was suicide. Chengmai's local officials would only report the emergency to superiors and otherwise turn a blind eye to the road construction—not unwilling, but unable to act.

If any local gentry were foolish enough to come making trouble, they could be directly eliminated as a demonstration of power.

The problem was construction materials and manpower, Wu De thought, having worked his abacus half the day in his office. From Lingao to Qiongshan was about one hundred kilometers. Even building to simple road standards, using only human labor without machinery, would take at least two years. Using mechanical equipment, at least six months. The war probably couldn't wait that long.

Of course, road construction was never just for warfare. Since they intended to actually control the entire island, this road had to be built sooner or later. Better to build it sooner. Only with roads built could they speak of control over the region. The road effect was particularly evident in Lingao. Wherever the transmigrator regime's roads reached, government orders flowed especially smoothly.

Today was the fifth day of the fifth month—Duanwu Festival—the day for dragon boat races on the Pearl River. Inside and outside the city, excitement abounded. In the Little Ice Age's Guangzhou, the weather during Duanwu was still cool enough for lined jackets.

The Governor-General's yamen in the city was heavily guarded. Governor Li Fengjie's grand sedan chair first entered the Governor-General's yamen through a side gate. Subsequently, many civil and military officials arrived one after another, including Regional Commander He Rubin, Provincial Inspector Gao Shunqing, the Guangdong Provincial Administration Commissioner, the Haibei Circuit Intendant, the Hainan Circuit Intendant, and the Guangzhou Prefect.

Behind the main hall of the Governor-General's yamen, past one courtyard, was the second hall. Besides the central great hall, the second hall also had side chambers—places for meetings and discussions.

Wang Zunde was in the western side chamber of the second hall, conferring secretly with Guangdong's principal civil and military officials about military matters. Suppressing the short-haired pirates at Bopu would require the strength of the entire province—this had already become consensus.

After all the principal officials had arrived, Wang Zunde presided over the meeting. Having made up his mind about military action, he'd already held multiple private meetings with provincial officials and roughly achieved consensus.

The Provincial Administration Commissioner had already agreed to advance twenty thousand taels of silver for the troops to repair weapons and ships and for marching expenses. The rest of the funding would be figured out later.

"Today we discuss the matter of suppressing the pirates—an urgent matter. The short-haired pirates have occupied Bopu, privately opened a trading port, built a city and fortress, and recruited local traitors as soldiers. Their power has grown great. I hear the short-haired pirates have iron ships and fast cannons, and their firearms are sharp. If this continues, they will certainly become a major threat to our entire Guangdong Province. I invite everyone to share their insights: how do we drive the short-haired pirates from Qiongzhou?"

Everyone looked at each other. They'd all heard more or less about the Australians in Lingao. As for the Australians' firearms and iron ships, everyone had heard the reputation. On the whole, except for Inspector Gao and Regional Commander He, no one was enthusiastic about coming to blows with the Australians.

The Australians hadn't done anything troublesome along the Guangdong coast. No killing, plundering, or arson. They conducted business properly. Their several establishments in Guangzhou city were also very well-behaved—never short on the customary fees for the three annual festivals and two seasonal greetings, and occasionally presenting some novel Australian items. As for Zhiming Tower, it was a favorite place where many had gone to enjoy "Australian secret pleasures."

Now to drive them out and suppress them—some actually felt a bit reluctant. Moreover, some believed Governor-General Wang was stirring up unnecessary conflict—the imperial forces might not be a match for the Australians. If things went wrong and they lost a battle, they might instead anger the Australians, who would then wreak havoc along the coast.

But since Governor-General Wang had made up his mind, naturally no one would contradict him. Some were already calculating other things—once the Australians were driven out, how to divide up the properties they'd leave behind.

After all, the Australians not only had three businesses in Guangzhou, but word was that many Australian goods were manufactured in Lingao. They'd also privately opened a trading port at Bopu. So how much Australian wealth must there be in Lingao!

After winning the battle, the Australians couldn't possibly take all their belongings when they fled. Everyone would benefit.

Gao Shunqing most strongly supported the Governor-General's decision. He'd always despised these overseas visitors. He'd originally wanted to drive out the Portuguese, let alone these Australians of unknown origin.

He cleared his throat and said: "These so-called Australians haven't been seen offering tribute in past years, nor are they Western or Eastern barbarians. Even the red-haired Dutch and the Portuguese don't know their origin. They peddle nothing but clever gadgets and toys, corrupting the hearts of gentry and commoners. Such creatures have secretly become a canker in the heart of our Guangdong Province!"

Everyone echoed in agreement. But no one had any idea how to actually drive out the Australians.

Regarding the specific situation of the Australians in Lingao, apart from a few dispatches sent by Qiongya Regional Vice Commander Tang Yunwen, everyone only knew scattered rumors: for example, that they claimed to be descendants of the Song people of Yashan; that the Australians were skilled craftsmen, and so forth. Even Vice Commander Tang's dispatches only said: the Australians had built gun emplacements at Bopu with giant cannons; they had iron fast ships that moved without sails or oars as if flying. Also, many "traitorous Fujian and Guangdong people" had joined as "false short-hairs" to serve as their vanguard.

Beyond this, no one knew how many people the short-haired pirates had in Lingao, how many cannons, how the great iron ships moved, and so on. No one even knew how many false short-hairs there were.

However, Wang Zunde had dispatches from the Fujian and Guangdong coasts. He knew that after Zhu Cailao's defeat and death, a batch of men and ships had defected to Lingao. Subsequently, scattered remnants from various pirate groups had also fled there. All told, there should be over ten thousand.

"The true and false short-hairs in Lingao total over ten thousand," He Rubin said. "They also have cannons and iron ships. Suppression won't be easy."

He Rubin was a military officer. Regarding operational strategy, he could only offer suggestions, not decisions. But since he was the one who would actually execute military operations, his views were also important.

Lü Yizhong quickly said: "The false short-hairs merely seek small profits from the short-haired pirates. If the Governor issues a proclamation explaining the dangers of following rebels, then when the imperial army moves, the false short-hairs will naturally scatter. They're no threat."

"Hmph, this matter may not be as easy as the Advisor suggests," He Rubin said. "Most of the false short-hairs are remnants of pirates like Zhu Cailao—men who've already staked their lives on the seas. Now they've joined forces with the short-haired pirates. The short-haired pirates can sail iron ships smashing through ten thousand miles of waves—they must be people skilled with boats. These two groups are in cahoots. If we can't destroy them in one blow and they scatter, our Guangdong waters will never have peace again!"

"The short-haired pirates aren't like ordinary pirates. Ordinary pirates only seek money. The Australians call themselves descendants of China. Having come to the Great Ming, they neither send envoys to pay court tribute nor submit petitions seeking incorporation. In one corner of Lingao they privately build city walls, recruit drifters—they clearly harbor disloyal intentions!" His tone was stern and severe, immediately putting a large political cap on the Australians.

"General Yinzhi."

He Rubin quickly stood up, hands clasped, and said: "I dare not, Your Excellency."

"You hold the court's hereditary commandery, and are listed among the provincial military officers. This Governor has always relied on you as Guangdong's Great Wall. For suppressing the short-haired pirates, what good strategy do you have?"

He Rubin respectfully bowed slightly and answered: "In this humble officer's view, suppression faces three difficulties."

"Which three?"

"False short-hairs and true short-hairs are indistinguishable. During the Jiajing era's wokou troubles, there were also true and false wokou. True wokou were only one or two in ten, yet they still ravaged the coasts for decades, becoming a major threat to the court. That's the first."

"Mm." Wang Zunde nodded.

"Second, the short-haired pirates in the Guangdong area have taken in drifters, bought and sold fairly, neither robbed merchants nor seized ships—quite effective at winning hearts. Once our troops move, traitorous people and commoners among the rebels will certainly inform them. Military secrets will be hard to keep."

"Good point."

"Third, the short-haired pirates have strong ships and sharp cannons, and their firearms are formidable. Our army cannot compare. In this humble officer's view, I fear they're even superior to the red-haired Dutch and the Portuguese."

Wang Zunde stroked his beard and smiled, asking: "What strategy does the General propose?"

"I dare not, Your Excellency." He became even more respectful. "Your Excellency's divine calculations surely include a strategy for pacifying the short-hairs. Please reveal your plan."

"At today's meeting, speak freely and withhold nothing."

"Yes."

He Rubin's strategy was no different from what Lü Yizhong had envisioned. The Australians had the advantage of ships and cannons. Sending just a few thousand men and a hundred or so ships to make a show of force wouldn't be enough to make them withdraw. Heavy forces were essential.

Deploy a land and sea army of twenty thousand, with at least six thousand combat troops. They must bring plenty of firearms, especially red-barbarian cannons.

"The enemy is skilled with boats and has gathered remnants of various pirate groups. Our forces absolutely must not engage them in naval battle on the open sea." He Rubin wasn't from a naval background, but he was very clear about the provincial navy's capabilities. Never mind the great iron ships and fast iron vessels—even fighting against the red-haired Dutch's great two-masted ships and fast boats, they'd be outmatched. Without using fireships, they simply couldn't oppose the enemy.

In his strategy, the Guangdong navy would only handle transport, ferrying participating troops in batches to Haikou Garrison, with the entire army concentrating at Qiongshan County.

"Although the Australians are powerful, they haven't yet been able to capture even one county seat. This shows they're not skilled at land warfare. If we advance with heavy land forces, we can achieve double the results."

According to He Rubin's estimate: most false short-hairs were remnants of pirates like Zhu Cailao. At sea, the imperial army might not be their match, but on land, when deploying in proper battle formation, they wouldn't dare engage head-on. They would surely retreat to defend Bopu. He would personally lead the main army overland to Bopu. The rebel-sympathizing commoners in Lingao would no longer dare supply the Bopu short-hairs with vegetables and meat. The army need only maintain a siege for several months to half a year, and they could force them to dismantle their fortress and leave.

Wang Zunde was quite satisfied with his plan. But according to custom, formulating strategy wasn't for military officers to decide. It wasn't his place to say whether it was good or bad—he just stroked his beard and smiled.

"Governor-General!" Li Fengjie said. "If we only send land forces for suppression, the short-haired pirates can still come and go freely by sea. Even if the traitorous people of Lingao can't supply vegetables and meat, there are too many greedy traitors in Fujian and Guangdong seeking profit. Things may not go as the General hopes."

"Do you have a good strategy?"

"Liu Laoxiang is a menace to our Guangdong. If we could follow Cao Lütai's strategy and offer him amnesty, using bandits to attack bandits—wouldn't that be a fine arrangement?"

The words were correct, but who would make contact with this "great pirate"? Liu Laoxiang had been harassing the Pearl River estuary. Imperial troops and local militia had skirmished with his small foraging parties many times but still didn't know where his main force was. The Portuguese had tried multiple times to destroy Liu Xiang without success—they even wanted to launch a joint suppression campaign with the Ming.

Pacifying such a great sea pirate couldn't be accomplished without a year or two of back-and-forth contact. The so-called strategy of using bandits to attack bandits was just empty talk.

Though Wang Zunde smiled, he actually disagreed.

"This matter needs further consideration. If he can be pacified, it would of course be wonderful." He said, "But who in our province is the Cao Lütai for this job?"

Yuegang Maritime Defense Vice Magistrate Cao Lütai was the principal handler for Xiong Wencan's pacification of Zheng Zhilong. All matters following Zheng Zhilong's submission were also handled by him. The strategy of using bandits to attack bandits was originally proposed by Cao Lütai. Wang Zunde felt there was no similarly bold and capable official in this province who also thoroughly understood "pirate affairs."

But Li Fengjie had his own calculations. Someone in his staff had made contact with Liu Laoxiang and was urging him to accept amnesty. From his advisors' mouths, he'd learned that although Liu Xiang's power had expanded quickly, he was extremely worried about Zheng Zhilong's expansion—once Zheng Zhilong destroyed Zhong Bin, he would certainly move eastward to Guangdong to destroy him.

Li Fengjie believed that since Liu Xiang had such thoughts, the possibility of pacifying him was quite good. So recently he'd been intensifying efforts on this matter. To avoid Wang Zunde's interference, he kept it secret.

His raising it now wasn't actually to use Liu Xiang, but merely to get Wang Zunde to take a position on pacifying Liu Xiang. Now that his goal was achieved, he said nothing more, just simply stating: "This humble official will definitely do his utmost."

Wang Zunde's suppression strategy was:

He Rubin would command the entire army, departing from Guangzhou with farewell rituals before heading to sea. They would cross the sea in batches to Qiongzhou Prefecture, concentrating at Haikou Garrison. Deploy three hundred naval vessels—the navy didn't have that many large ships, and there wasn't time to build them, so the shortfall would be filled by impressing civilian ships along the coast.

Mobilize a total force of fifteen thousand. The core would be He Rubin's garrison central battalion and household retainers, supplemented by portions of the Governor's and Governor-General's garrisons—a total of six thousand combat troops. Qiongya Vice Commander Tang Yunwen's forces would also be under his command. Thus the Ming punitive expedition would total twenty thousand by land and sea. Wang Zunde also planned to order the Hainan Circuit Intendant to mobilize militia from Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Lingao, along with any usable local garrison soldiers, to assist in the campaign. The provisions and pay for these forces would be handled by Qiongzhou Prefecture itself.

Once force concentration was complete, the land army would advance along the post road toward Lingao. When the land army had surrounded Bopu, the navy would act as circumstances warranted. Wang Zunde had no expectations for the provincial navy's combat capability, so he didn't specify their tasks.

The proposal to borrow Portuguese warships and cannons for assistance was strenuously opposed by Gao Shunqing. He'd originally wanted to submit a memorial to cut off trade with the Portuguese. If this borrowed-force strategy succeeded in driving out the short-hairs, the court would view the Portuguese as useful allies—how could his memorial be approved?

So even though he knew Portuguese large ships and heavy guns would be useful for suppressing the short-hairs, he still firmly opposed. Wang Zunde didn't want to argue with him, so he dropped the matter.

Since the imperial navy couldn't contend with them, Wang Zunde invoked the magic weapon of maritime prohibition. He immediately ordered Qiongya Vice Commander Tang Yunwen to lead the navy on patrol near Haikou, prohibiting all civilian vessels from entering the Qiongzhou Strait.

"Your Excellency, why not request troops from Guangxi?" After the meeting, Lü Yizhong was puzzled that his employer hadn't summoned Guangxi officials. Guangxi had some fierce and capable native soldiers. In past Li rebellions on Hainan, the court had transferred Miao, Yao, Dong, and other ethnic native soldiers from Guangxi to cross the sea and fight.

"This is Guangdong's affair. Guangdong's troops are better suited." Wang Zunde said nonchalantly. "Guangxi has poor land and impoverished people. Better to conscript less."

After a moment's thought, Lü Yizhong understood his meaning—"Guangdong affairs settled by Guangdong."

"Your Excellency is wise."

"Not at all." Wang Zunde nodded with dignified composure. Then he inquired of Lü Yizhong about the detailed situation of the short-haired pirates in Lingao. Lü Yizhong was essentially the Governor-General's "chief of staff"—all manner of news, dispatches, and documents first passed through his hands.

However, the dispatches received from Hainan in Guangzhou contained only fragmentary details—too little was known about the short-hairs' situation in Lingao. Wang Zunde immediately ordered people to post notices in Qiongzhou Prefecture seeking talented individuals, recruiting people who understood Lingao's pirate situation and were familiar with local waters and geography. He also ordered He Rubin to dispatch more spies to Lingao to investigate.

"There's one person I believe might be worth questioning."

"Oh? Who?"

"The Lingao County Magistrate—Wu Mingjin."

Lü Yizhong reminded him that Lingao County seat hadn't fallen. The county's officials were all alive and well. Regarding the short-hairs' situation, the county magistrate should know most clearly. Why not summon him to Guangzhou under the pretext of debriefing—the local situation and the short-hairs' internal affairs could all be learned with one interview.

Note:

He Rubin's original hereditary rank was Suzhou Guard Commandery. His courtesy name was "Yinzhi." Wang Zunde addressing him this way was a polite form.

Li Fengjie was the Governor, but Ming Dynasty governors had far lower status than in the Qing. Their rank wasn't clearly defined—generally they held the title of Vice Censor-in-Chief, only a fourth-rank civil official. He could address the Governor-General as "this humble official."
