# Chapter 2394: Financing (Part 25)

Cheng Dong hadn't participated in this entire financing process. First, he wasn't from a finance background but an accounting major, lacking sufficient depth of understanding in this area to speak much. Second, he also knew the water was too deep here. Whether it went well or poorly would easily cause controversy in the future. Better not to get involved.

The current plan, in his view, was moderate without going overboard—he felt this was fine. Anyway, the ultimate goal was fundraising. As long as it didn't increase the central bank's burden and didn't cause serious after-effects, it didn't matter how the Senate did it.

Cheng Dong said: "This thinking of not increasing understanding difficulty is very commendable. I personally am very opposed to designing overly complex financial products—there have been enough such lessons in the old spacetime."

This correct but useless statement indicated he had nothing more to ask.

Meng Xian then interjected: "I have two questions. First, how is this Southeast Asia Shipping thing designed? Second, I have no objection to your equity structure, but will this design be unfavorable for native big households' understanding? To what extent will it affect issuance? How have you considered this?"

Chu He answered: "Southeast Asia Shipping is a shell company established to handle the original Liu Xiang Group's shareholding. It has no business activities or actual business. Because the original Southeast Asia Company's assets and personnel were all transferred to Southeast Asia Operations. The Planning Committee side doesn't want the naturalized personnel from the original pirate group to have a stake in Southeast Ops, so they created this shell company. When the time comes, just pay dividends as before."

Meng Xian continued asking: "What about the equity ratio? How did 60:40 come about?"

Chu He replied: "The old pirate naturalized group's shareholding was 49% of the original Southeast Asia Company. We believe this ratio is too high in the new company. Although it's a shell company, considering future possibilities, after research, we decided to dilute the Liu Xiang Group's shareholding to 40% through virtual capital injection."

Meng Xian thought: Oh, made up by slapping one's head. He asked: "Won't there be backlash from the group's personnel? After all, the policy back then was to win over distant people."

Chu He had fully considered this question and now explained: "No. First, they don't understand. How many of these old pirates can read? Even fewer can understand financial statements and detect our methods. Second, treatment won't decrease. These people will still receive dividends as before. Our principle is their dividends will 'only increase, not decrease'—looking at past year dividends, this number was already low. At worst, maintain the status quo. Third, give them a way out. They're now employees of Southeast Asia Operations Company. Their daily work is no different from what they did before. It's just changed to another signboard. The only difference is the name changed on the annual dividend notice. If they want to get on the Senate's train for developing Southeast Asia, they can apply to purchase stocks."

Meichuan interjected at this point: "I don't think it will affect natives' understanding much. As long as we don't emphasize the existence of Southeast Asia Operations, just talk about Southeast Asia Holdings matters. By the time someone notices the difference, the stocks will have long been issued."

Ai Zhixin said: "Then why not call one Southeast Asia Development Holdings Company and the other Southeast Asia Development Operations Company. Or remove the word 'Operations' from the latter. This way outsiders will even more think they're the same thing. When they find out otherwise, they can't blame others."

Meng Xian thought: you say it so lightly, playing word games. To put it plainly, this is the Senate coming forward to deceive, then reneging. Essentially the same as saying a plate of shrimp is 9.9 yuan, then at checkout saying one shrimp is 9.9 yuan! Big households aren't fools—those who made big fortunes in Guangzhou city are all smart operators. They'll figure out your little tricks with some thought!

Meng Xian had been in banking in Guangzhou for many years and knew his clients like the back of his hand. These financial tricks were certainly very fresh for 17th-century people, but by no means incomprehensible. As long as they found enough information and accumulated time, they would quickly see through the mysteries. One must know the stock issuance underwriter was Delong. If the disputes with big households couldn't be resolved, he would be the first to have a headache.

Seeing Meng Xian frowning deeply, Zhou Wei said: "What opinions does Comrade Meng Xian have? Let's discuss further."

Meng Xian pursed his lips. "Mm... I don't have major objections, but I personally don't quite agree with this kind of word-play trickery. Actually, if you don't want big households to interfere with operations, just issue preferred stock. Preferred stock has no voting rights. Is a holding company necessary?"

Chu He thought: right now there's not even a Company Law. Can't the Senate run a company however it wants? Natives can't even tell whether the Senate's eating manner is ugly. There's no need to worry about big households. We're not doing a prospectus anyway. Why explain so clearly? Just say the Senate wants to recover Southeast Asia, do you support it or not?

Zhou Wei was even less inclined to bicker over this issue. He gave a few dry laughs and said perfunctorily: "These questions are very good, very good. We'll continue to revise. During implementation, we'll fully consider all parties' interests. In short, we can't make things difficult for everyone, hahaha, hahaha."

Fortunately, Meng Xian didn't continue pursuing "how to improve," and this matter was muddled through.

Dingding beside him asked: "This bond of ours has 10% annual interest. That's much lower than market rates, right? Can these 220,000 in bonds actually be issued?"

Chu He answered: "In terms of total volume, there's no problem. This time the Nanyang Company is raising a total of 300,000 yuan from the public. Back when the second countercampaign siege happened, Guangzhou's ransom was also 300,000 taels. This amount of money is just a drop in the bucket for Guangzhou merchants. In terms of interest, according to the finance sector Senators' investigation report—" Chu He nodded toward Ai Zhixin to indicate.

"The lending rate among big merchants in Guangzhou city generally fluctuates between 25% and 60%. Recently, because the plague just ended and the market is sluggish, interest rates are staying low, basically under 25%. Actual operations are probably less than 20%. Our first phase interest is 10%, not far from private rates, and shouldn't be hard to accept. Back when Wang Zunde borrowed from Gao Ju and them, the interest was also just 18%." Actually, the actual interest rate for that borrowing was around 25%, with 18% just being the nominal interest on paper, but Chu He didn't explain this detail to Dingding.

Dingding continued asking: "Then the 8% bonds issued later, and those with even lower interest, should have some difficulty?"

Zhou Wei already understood what Dingding meant by asking this, and said: "Naturally. The smooth issuance of bonds is inseparable from everyone's help. First, we need to make stocks attractive and create a wealth effect. Second, we need to borrow the propaganda sector's help to build up the Nanyang Company's buzz, amplify attractiveness, publicize the wealth effect, and attract big household attention. This naturally requires Senator Ding's great assistance."

Dingding pretended to be restrained and said: "We're not professionals at this."

Zhou Wei said: "No problem, no problem. When the time comes, we'll help do it together. Advertising fees and such are all negotiable."

At this time, Cheng Dong said again: "You just mentioned wanting to create a wealth effect. How do you plan to do this?"

"This needs to be done in coordination with the exchange. Right now there's only one stock on the market. The first two phases only issued a total of 30,000 shares. There's simply no active trading market. This is convenient for us to play the role of market maker. We'll publish bid and ask prices daily, collect buy and sell order slips from Senators, naturalized citizens, and big households, then settle at day's end. Match the declarations for transactions, then publish new bid and ask prices the next day. I believe through the propaganda sector's efforts, once Southeast Development is listed, buy orders should far exceed sell orders. This way we can guide the trend and push up the stock price. If not, it doesn't matter either. Anyway, declaration quantities and prices aren't transparent externally. We just need to artificially push it up. Even if those big households from the targeted issuance are blind and want to sell everything to us, we still have the bond issuance money to buy it all back. Besides, we can also control trading volume. We can push up the actual price while the trading volume isn't that much. In short, as long as we can pull the stock price up 20% in a short time, it's enough to support the second and third phase issuances." Ren Youzi explained.

Cheng Dong thought: your plan has the major shareholder itself being the market maker, not only manipulating but also doing fake transactions to manipulate the stock price. Such people are truly... worthy of being main members of the Guangzhou Exchange Preparatory Team. From his heart, he was happy to see harvesting big household leeks to support Senate construction. This was also one of the finance sector's service mottos. But as the finance department head, he also bore the responsibility of establishing good financial order and maintaining the Senate's credit. If the exchange stirred up public anger, he would also be held responsible.

So he thought and said: "The Nanyang Company, as Southeast Development's major shareholder, also being the market maker should be non-compliant."

"Correct, this is just a stopgap measure. In the future, the market maker portion of business will definitely be split off." Ren Youzi immediately stated his position.

This statement was still satisfactory to Cheng Dong. To be honest, right now the Senate itself was both athlete and referee, and profiting from it was a matter of course. But everything needed moderation.

Meng Xian said: "The scheme you mentioned of matching transactions at day's end is actually just one call auction per day. If your price only changes once a day, there's no need for a market maker."

"I'm just making a suggestion. It depends on how the Guangzhou Exchange's trading rules are specifically set in the future. If there are more people in the future, we can have two settlements a day, or multiple settlements. Real-time settlement isn't necessary. There simply aren't that many frequent transactions, and we can hardly process them either."

"This way is equivalent to T-day trading, with T+1 confirmation. Price and volume are also being manipulated. Isn't this forcing people to trade on the black market?" Cheng Dong continued asking.

Zhou Wei coughed: "The black market is unavoidable. The first two phases of bearer bonds and stocks we issued originally allowed big households to trade among themselves. Official channels being difficult to buy stocks will only push up black market prices. This also makes newly issued stocks more attractive."
