# Chapter 2011 - The List (II)

The list gradually took shape amid the gossip at the Jiliang Institute. The trio tried to gauge the Elder's intentions—the first batch would certainly be held to high standards to set a benchmark. So the selection was especially strict. Mao Weijia said: better to have fewer people than to have any problems.

Thus the candidate pool was drastically reduced. All sorts of rumors flew around inside the institute. Lu Cheng couldn't spare attention for all that. She worked day and night, interviewing each candidate individually to ensure everyone's situation was "fully understood."

In the end, only fifty people were selected from the Jiliang Institute. The list was duly posted on the bulletin board for "public notice," naturally provoking another round of private discussions—envy, blessings, and sour remarks filled the air.

Right around this time, the workshop's work efficiency suddenly improved dramatically. "Having hope" proved more effective than any amount of "ideological work." Before, cadres had only told them to "work hard" and "reform their thinking," but with no follow-up, naturally nobody was very motivated. Now suddenly there was a way out—even if they weren't picked in the first batch, as long as they worked hard, there'd be later rounds.

Troublemakers like Bian Cuibao suddenly found themselves isolated. Lu Cheng and the cadres kept hinting, sometimes openly, sometimes subtly, that inclusion on the list would consider "ideological issues." "Unqualified" students "wouldn't be considered," but as long as everyone "worked hard to progress," "the higher-ups would definitely notice." "Some people got confused in the past and followed along with troublemakers, but as long as they drew clear boundaries, the higher-ups would let bygones be bygones and give them chances"...

Among the masses, there were always such people who, for various reasons, became "troublemakers" who resisted authority. Though their small rebellions might secretly receive sympathy and support from the masses, even cheers when "too many to punish," once the masses discovered that abandoning them could bring greater benefits, the troublemakers' "popular support" would instantly collapse. Those who'd been "somebodies" at the Jiliang Institute suddenly became "discarded shoes" that nobody cared about. Even her close friends didn't dare speak to her openly anymore. The quick-thinking ones directly "drew clear boundaries." At the weekly "democratic life meetings," Bian Cuibao, the former "debate queen" whom nobody had dared to provoke, was now criticized into silence by several people. Even during work, she was frequently scolded by activists.

"Since the Elder proposed this plan, the Jiliang Institute's atmosphere has completely transformed." Lu Cheng was quite happy. This change was completely unexpected—both surprising and delightful.

While the shelter agonized over the list, Du Yibin didn't idle either after returning. He immediately went to the shipyard to see Wang Jun, to discuss the specific lists of naturalized citizens for matchmaking and the format of the matchmaking events.

"Things aren't easy," Wang Jun sighed when he saw him, producing a thick registry. "Too many monks, too little porridge."

The registry on the table was the master list and general information about disabled naturalized citizens that Wang Jun had obtained from Civil Affairs.

The Council of Elders' disability system was modeled on the old timeline's, divided into ten grades. This matchmaking activity would only address the marriage problems of personnel with moderate to severe disabilities at Grade 7 and above.

Du Yibin looked it over. The materials were quite complete—not only photos attached, but also detailed descriptions of specific disabilities, sequelae, rehabilitation plans, and approximate costs. There were also detailed records of the disabled personnel's current work situation, income and benefits, housing, and family circumstances. Civil Affairs had done thorough work.

Wang Jun said: "I originally thought there wouldn't be many, but now I see I was wrong. There are far too few [women]."

"More men than women—this won't be easy to divide up." Du Yibin started scratching his head.

Whether Wang Jun or Du Yibin, they had underestimated the number of single disabled naturalized citizens. Even counting all the activists from the Jiliang Institute, it probably wouldn't be enough.

"There's a second problem too. As soon as we submitted our proposal, memoranda came from various departments. Some people even want to treat us to dinner. If we were in Lingao right now, we'd probably have to schedule banquets at the Flying Cloud Club and South Sea Coffee House, attending at least four or five meals a day."

"Treat us to dinner?" Du Yibin didn't understand.

"Just trying to get us to tilt these single women toward their departments," Wang Jun smiled wryly.

Du Yibin thought about it: "We can't offend anyone. How about this: since we can't distribute enough, for both disabled and ordinary naturalized citizens, we'll stick to two principles. First, the woman's choice is voluntary. Second, men are prioritized by seniority and merit—whoever has longer service and greater achievements gets priority on the candidate list. Senior disabled naturalized citizens with major contributions have some influence in their units, can speak up for themselves, and have higher seniority pay. For the widows, that would be compensation."

As for the venue, naturally it would be Guangzhou—transporting all the students and single women back to Lingao would be too expensive. Besides, thanks to large-scale population imports, Lingao's own gender ratio had already trended toward normal. Since the mainland offensive began, over ten thousand cadres and soldiers had been dispatched from Lingao and other places. Among them were large numbers of bachelors. They'd left Lingao, that "little paradise on earth," to work in harsh conditions in the new territories. Giving them appropriate preference in marriage matters was only fair.

"As for the venue, Director Liu has been quite supportive. We can choose from any of the local halls and facilities. But there's an issue—there are very few disabled naturalized citizens in Guangzhou," Wang Jun said. "I don't think we should hold matchmaking events for them."

Disabled naturalized personnel were currently mostly assigned to work in Lingao, with some also placed in various Hainan counties. Only a small number of Grade 7 disabled naturalized citizens worked in Guangzhou. To hold a matchmaking event, just gathering these people would be extremely troublesome, not to mention the boat trip.

Du Yibin thought it made sense: "They have mobility difficulties—better not to trouble them. Let's use photos for mutual selection. Once matches are made, we'll just send the women over. The only worry is if the women change their minds."

"If they change their minds, there's nothing we can do. We can't force these things. At most they'll have earned a one-way boat ticket—their life-long matters will still need Council arrangement anyway. On balance, it's not a loss." Wang Jun said.

"For ordinary naturalized citizens, we'll send groups to the Jiliang Institute for face-to-face matchmaking. Consider it on-site education. Let the laggards know the Council of Elders keeps its word, and help transform the thinking of the other students," Du Yibin said. Wang Jun had no objections.

The two immediately divided the work and organized the relevant lists and materials. First they ranked the disabled naturalized citizen list by seniority from top to bottom, then Wang Jun's life secretary copied and organized the relevant materials.

For the specific matchmaking event format, Wang Jun had already drafted a proposal. Elder Du never liked worrying about such things. He glanced through it briefly and said: "For the upcoming matchmaking conference, you, Elder Wang, will be the lead. I'll just assist."

"You want me to be both the planner and the host?" Wang Jun asked, drinking his kvass.

"Of course. I'll just handle backstage and setup. I don't want to manage that much. It's settled—this was your idea anyway." Du Yibin drank his kvass too. "Just don't turn it into a dating variety show."

"Dating shows are entertainment—they're not real matchmaking."

"Fine, fine, fine. Hurry up and arrange things—I don't think we need to do meals. Just get some melon seeds and tea and such..."

"Money? The budget request still needs Director Wang's approval." The two found there were still plenty of trivial matters. Wang Jun paid out of pocket first, taking people to the tea shop to buy things, while Du Yibin went to chat with Director Wang—this budget had already been revised many times. If he still didn't approve, Du Yibin would post on the BBS and thoroughly roast him for "bureaucratic style."

Three days later, Du Yibin, having successfully obtained the budget that had been slashed seventeen or eighteen times, returned to the shelter. The trio presented the list and the problems they'd encountered to Du Yibin.

Du Yibin wasn't interested in the list—he didn't know a single person on it. But he read the list of issues multiple times.

Some of the items on this issues list he'd thought of, some Civil Affairs had arrangements for, but quite a few nobody had anticipated. No wonder Supervisor Ma said civil affairs work best embodied the word "troublesome." Indeed so. Most of these issues were trivial, yet they were genuinely related to these women's lives—not insignificant.

To solve them, sparing no cost, they could all be solved. But the Council of Elders' current fiscal situation didn't allow for lavish spending. Though theoretically this money came from the General Office Special Fund, Director Xiao and the finance bigwigs had gently reminded him: though the special fund was a separate line item, essentially it was still soup from the same pot—there wasn't a second pot.

So the actual allocated special funds were very limited. Liu Muzhou had reminded him multiple times in his memoranda to "calculate costs." For non-disabled naturalized citizens' marriages, "in principle" no subsidies would be provided. As for Director Liu's side, though he'd expressed "strong support," he'd also set conditions: Guangzhou city could only provide support in terms of venue and manpower. As for money—not a single fen.

So he had to be careful about what he promised now:

"Their concerns are understandable. The commitments I can make now aren't many. First, Civil Affairs has put forth guidelines that after marrying a disabled naturalized citizen, each family will be assigned independent housing, with floor area calculated based on family size. There will be certain discounts on purchases and mortgages. Second, families with severe disabilities or many dependents will receive varying amounts of home service vouchers each month based on disability level, for hiring domestic help with housework—mainly heavy labor. Disability allowances go without saying—disabled personnel already receive those. For moderate or lesser disabilities who can manage daily life, appropriate work will be arranged for them. Those who can't manage daily life won't be assigned work but will receive minimum living expenses instead."
