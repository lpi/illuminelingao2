# Chapter 203 - Fencing Stolen Goods

Thus, the Portuguese trade had been severely damaged. Several Japanese Kirishitans lamented that those who now controlled Japan's foreign trade were the "heretical" Dutch, who maintained a trading post in Hirado. True believers in the Catholic faith had instead been expelled. Although Portuguese-Japanese trade had recently recovered somewhat, only one ship per year made the voyage. The local church had also suffered heavy losses—the Jesuits in Macau had previously held the privilege of trading forty piculs of raw silk in the Portuguese-Japanese trade.

This information was quite useful to the transmigrators. However, further questioning yielded nothing more of value. The Japanese craftsmen, excited to meet these strange fellow believers who were neither Japanese nor quite Chinese nor Western, began talking exclusively about the Tokugawa Shogunate's persecution of the Kirishitans and the various martyrdoms and miracles of Japanese Christians. Bai Duoluo, whose practice of Catholicism wasn't particularly devout, had little interest in martyrdom. He was searching for an excuse to slip away when the Japanese craftsmen insisted he meet the local church's priest. Bai Duoluo thought this was something he should clear with the organization first, so he hurried to ask Wen Desi whether they should make contact with the local church, and if so, what their stance should be.

After consideration, Wen Desi decided they should make contact to see what the Catholic Church could offer them. Maintaining good relations for the time being couldn't hurt, and they might even receive some practical assistance. He agreed to let Bai Duoluo visit the local church. As for explaining their origins, he could simply follow the *Captive's Handbook*.

"Say as little as possible and listen more," Wen Desi instructed him. "If I remember correctly, the Catholic order here is mainly the Society of Jesus. These people are particularly adept at adapting when it comes to missionary work and can be very persuasive."

"I understand, Director Wen." Bai Duoluo left with the craftsmen.

The rest of the group continued wandering the streets. Gradually, they noticed fewer white people and the streets began to take on a more Chinese character. Upon inquiry, they learned this was De Street—Macau's Chinese quarter. The street was lined with shops displaying all manner of signboards. Zhang Xin observed that most dealt in raw silk and silk fabrics, though there were also many porcelain shops. Some establishments had refined storefronts yet sold no visible merchandise, with attendants in blue-collared jackets and small caps greeting customers at the door. As everyone was idly speculating and looking around, a young shop clerk suddenly emerged from one establishment and invited them inside for a chat.

Having the entire group enter would be both unnecessary and troublesome—such a large party moving together was far too conspicuous. Wen Desi had noticed several black men in livery silently following behind them, likely local security personnel. To avoid complications, he decided that only he and a few others would go inside to assess the situation while the rest split into groups of five or six to explore freely.

The streets in the Chinese quarter were already narrow, and the many shops lining them had erected various awnings that blocked out much of the limited sky. The lighting was poor, and stepping into the shop made it seem even darker, with a faint, subtle fragrance wafting through the air. After a moment, their vision adjusted. Passing through the entrance hall, they found themselves in a typical Chinese-style reception room—gray brick flooring, rosewood trim, and a pair of glass palace lanterns from Yiwu hanging in the center. Wen Desi had to smile when he saw them—clearly their products had already become status symbols.

As he was looking around, a well-dressed Chinese merchant emerged from a door behind the screen. He first made a bow and introduced himself as Huang Shunlong, the manager of the "Tailong" trading house. After exchanging courtesies and names, both parties took their seats. Huang Shunlong was quite direct, asking Wen Desi point-blank: "Are you merchants from Australia?"

"Indeed."

"They say Australian merchants have shorn hair and short jackets. Seeing you now, this proves true." Huang Shunlong seemed to smile slightly. "Manager Wen has come to Macau to do business, yes?" Then he added mysteriously, "Perhaps you have some goods that couldn't be disposed of in Guangzhou—"

Wen Desi and the others started. The goods that "couldn't be disposed of in Guangzhou" could only mean the loot they had seized from the Gou family in their black-on-black raid. Could this man have connections to Gou Er? Wang Ruixiang, who was in charge of security, had already reached for the grip of his Type 54 pistol.

Seeing the tension in Wen Desi's group, Huang Shunlong laughed heartily: "Though I've never left Macau, I have heard something of your origins. The moment you set foot on Macau's soil, I was already awaiting your arrival. My shop may be small, but its reputation is known across the four seas."

So those black men following them had been his—Wen Desi suddenly understood.

"What reputation?"

Huang Shunlong proudly produced a small golden box, used his fingernail to scoop out some tobacco powder, and sniffed it:

"Manager Wen is quite short of saltpeter in Linggao, isn't he?"

"We do feel the shortage," Wen Desi thought he would play along to see what the man wanted.

"Actually, Manager Gao is an amateur at this business," Huang Shunlong wiped his lips, the tobacco leaving a yellow butterfly-shaped stain beneath his nose. "When it comes to saltpeter and gunpowder, my goods are far superior to his."

So this was a man who dealt specifically in contraband. Wen Desi thought this could be a good thing. Relying solely on Gao Ju as their procurement agent meant excessive dependency, which was dangerous from a supply security standpoint. If they could establish another connection here, all the better.

As it turned out, "Tailong" specialized in overseas trade, with over a dozen small, fast vessels plying the waters along the Guangdong coast. They transported local silk, porcelain, medicinal materials, and handicrafts to Macau to sell to the Portuguese. However, he had another line of business—providing all manner of necessities to ships at sea. These "necessities" included timber and ironwork for ship repairs, provisions, and firearms and gunpowder. Naturally, this also meant his other trade was receiving stolen goods from pirates.

Of course, Macau was not a pirate port, and both fencing stolen goods and selling provisions to pirates were illegal. Beyond the authority of the Portuguese governor, Macau itself couldn't protect him from the *Great Ming Code*. However, Huang Shunlong had been running this business locally for many years, and the reason he remained safe was obvious—he had plenty of money. Additionally, he had married a Portuguese wife, which had ruined his reputation within his own clan and nearly gotten him expelled from it.

Such a person clearly suited the transmigrators' needs. Wen Desi produced a list of various trade goods seized from the Gou manor—useful items like ironware, cotton cloth, woolen fabric, leather, and copperware would naturally be kept, but the large quantities of porcelain, silk, and handicrafts that were of no use to them were all targets for quick disposal.

They negotiated a price: Huang Shunlong would purchase all the goods on the transmigrators' list for forty thousand piastres. The transmigrators would be responsible for delivering the goods to Macau, and both parties would settle in full. Additionally, Huang Shunlong would provide the transmigrators with an extra ten thousand catties of pig iron and one thousand catties of saltpeter.

"How would Manager Wen prefer to settle the account?" Huang Shunlong asked.

"What are the options?"

"If Manager Wen prefers cash, I'll need to make some preparations in advance—forty thousand piastres is no small sum, after all."

If the transmigrators didn't want cash, Huang Shunlong would pay with promissory notes from the Indian Brahmin merchants operating locally. These notes were valid throughout Southeast Asia, all the way to Goa and Madras on the Indian subcontinent. They could be redeemed for cash at any time and used directly as checks for large payments.

By Wen Desi's thinking, it would be better to accept the notes—they would be making regular purchases locally anyway, and lugging silver back and forth was inconvenient. But then he remembered that currency reform was about to be implemented in Linggao and would require large reserves of precious metals as backing. So they agreed on half in silver and half in notes.

The deal was struck. Huang Shunlong smiled like a fox, clearly having gotten the better end of the bargain. He then mentioned that Australian goods were quite remarkable and expressed hope for cooperation in this area. Wen Desi was secretly pleased—their products really were universally popular.

They dispatched someone back to the ship to bring samples of the transmigrator collective's limited self-produced goods for his inspection. These consisted mainly of various small glass items and the rice wine from the Guangzhou Dispatch Station. After examining them, he furrowed his brow before saying, "These items are good, but the market for them is limited."

Pointing at the various glass items, he said, "The Franks bring these glass trinkets on every ship—glass bowls, glass beads. Though they're not as fine as yours, they're enough to deceive the natives of the South Seas. As for the liquor, they mostly drink fruit wines. I'm afraid they might not be interested in this rice spirits—"

However, the hundred or so hawksbill turtle shells that the Fisheries Group had caught while fishing fetched a good price. Huang Shunlong said the Portuguese were very fond of these and would take as many as could be supplied.

Huang Shunlong knew something of their activities in Linggao and seemed to be probing the transmigrators' future intentions: Would Australia send more large ships? Did Australia intend to follow the Portuguese example and occupy Linggao as a trading base with the Ming Dynasty? If so, did the Australians plan to involve themselves in the trade here? These questions were obviously not just things he wanted to know—Wen Desi suddenly realized that Macau's Portuguese authorities were also very keen to find out.

Organizing his thoughts, he said that Australia had no ships coming for the time being, but they certainly intended to remain in Linggao. Huang Shunlong "kindly" warned them to be wary of Zheng Zhilong's movements—"One cannot tolerate another snoring beside one's bed." This man was ambitious, and having submitted to the authorities, sooner or later all the various sea lords of the Fujian and Guangdong waters would be attacked by him. It seemed Zheng Zhilong was quite resented. A flash of inspiration crossed Wen Desi's mind, but then he thought it absurd and shook his head.

When Wen Desi inquired about Liu Xiang and Zhu Cailao, Huang Shunlong said they both had agents in Macau, but neither they nor the main members of their gangs ever appeared in Macau in person. This place was still under the jurisdiction of Ming Dynasty law—if the government issued an arrest warrant, the Portuguese governor would have to comply and hand them over. If the Xiangshan County magistrate happened to be a man of principle, he might even personally lead men into the city to make arrests. Not even the governor could protect them then.

Wen Desi asked, "Is there a woman named Li Siya in this city?"
