# Chapter 1341 Sense of Strangeness

Dai Yan went back and forth, retrieving three food trays, and left again. It was a while before she returned with a mysterious look on her face.

"Mom, drink this!"

Mrs. Dai took the bottle her daughter handed over like a treasure. She shook it, looking at the bottle filled with white liquid. Suddenly realizing it was glass, her hand trembled, and she almost dropped it.

"Girl, what is this?"

"It's called milk. The cafeteria only started supplying it last month, and only we get to drink it in the morning. I was first in two subjects in the last monthly exam, so I got two reward coupons. I exchanged them for two bottles for you to taste!" Dai Yan spoke very fast, handing another bottle to her father like a treasure as she spoke.

Dai Dehou looked at the bottle in his hand and was instantly shocked. This was crystal glass!

The milk bottle in front of him was different from the colored glass bottles that were already being sold in large quantities on the market at low prices. It was a transparent crystal glass bottle, and the workmanship was extremely fine. It wouldn't be difficult to exchange it for one or two taels of silver on the market.

The Chiefs are truly generous. Dai Dehou felt grateful in his heart, and his hands trembled slightly as he hurriedly placed the bottle on the table.

Dai Yan was used to it. She took the bottle, skillfully untied the cotton string, opened the paper seal, and handed it back.

At his daughter's repeated waving and urging, Dai Dehou picked up the bottle and carefully took a sip. It had a faint sweetness at first, and then a strange aroma began to spread in his mouth.

"It tastes good, right? Mom, you drink too!" Dai Yan opened the other bottle and handed it to Mrs. Dai. She only looked satisfied after seeing her start to drink.

Mrs. Dai couldn't get used to the milk with its faint "fishy smell", but in order not to let down her daughter's kindness, she bit the bullet and drank it.

Dai Yan had a restless nature. She pushed the food trays in front of her parents, then picked up the food box Mrs. Dai had brought and opened it. Purfing her lips, she untied the cotton cloth wrapped around the food jar, lifted the lid, and placed the still-warm large yellow croaker in front of her.

"I told you last time not to bring food. The school treats us very well. Every meal has fish and meat, and we're not allowed not to finish it!"

Dai Dehou looked at the rattan woven food tray in front of him. Inside were several bowls made of coconut shells. Not only was there taro braised chicken chunks, but also a dish of pork slices stir-fried with red and green vegetables. In addition, there was a bowl of vegetable and egg drop soup. It was much more exquisite than what they ate at home.

The three of them started eating. Mrs. Dai picked up a piece of the green vegetable she had never seen before from beside the meat slices. She put it in her mouth and took a bite. Instantly, a pungent sensation spread in her mouth, and she could no longer care about etiquette, opening her mouth to exhale continuously.

"Hehe, this is a bit spicy, right? It's okay, just drink some milk." Dai Yan said with a grin, "I asked the teacher. These chili peppers are appetizing when eaten. They are from the Americas... hey, that's an island very, very far to our southwest. They produced them there, and the Chiefs brought them over to plant in Lingao."

Although chili peppers had long been sold in the market, they were relatively expensive, and dietary habits were different. Except for wealthy households and naturalized citizen cadres, ordinary people in Lingao rarely bought them to eat. Although Dai Dehou and Mrs. Dai had seen various round and pointed, red and green chili peppers in the vegetable and fruit direct sales stores opened by the Red Flower Society, they really hadn't eaten them usually.

Strange words kept popping out of his daughter's mouth. Dai Dehou had never heard of them. Seeing his daughter's promise, he was both proud and anxious for his son, Dai Yu.

No matter how promising the daughter is, she will eventually benefit outsiders. How much light can our family share in?

While they were burying their heads in their meal, suddenly Dai Yan whispered, "Look, that's a Chief's child."

Dai Dehou had long heard that there were "Little Senators"—they had come from Australia together with the Chiefs on the big iron ship back then. However, these children were very mysterious and were almost invisible in public occasions.

Currently, there were less than ten "Little Senators" studying at Fangcaodi, ranging from seven or eight to twelve or thirteen years old. A class was specially established in the Academy to receive multi-grade education—although it was called multi-grade education, it was actually not much different from one-on-one tutoring.

Their learning content was deeper than that of the accelerated class students, especially in the depth and breadth of natural and human sciences. In addition, everyone had to choose a common foreign language from the old space-time as an elective to ensure that the various foreign language materials in the Great Library could be effectively passed down.

However, inside the Academy, these students were not allowed to be called "Chiefs". Anyone in the school could only call them by their names. The students secretly called them "Those People".

Dai Dehou saw that the person who came in was a female student. Judging by her face shape, she was only about eleven or twelve years old, yet she was a head taller than most of the thirteen or fourteen-year-old boys here. She had a slender figure, wore a school uniform of the same style as other students, and had long hair tied with a pink ribbon. Her appearance was beautiful and her complexion was fair.

She came in, greeted a few familiar girls, and walked to the meal counter with light steps to get her food. Her gestures and smiles all exuded a temperament completely different from his own daughter, unpretentious and full of confidence, like a rising sun. The eyes of the whole venue immediately focused on her.

Truly a natural noble. Dai Dehou thought enviously. Since his own daughter came here to study, she had become more and more spiritual, but compared to her, there was nothing to see...

I wonder who this Senator's daughter will marry in the future...

Dai Dehou's wild thoughts were quickly interrupted by his wife's words: "Whose girl is this?"

"A Senator's family, of course. You wouldn't know even if I told you..."

This was a fact. The names of the Senators that Dai Dehou knew amounted to no more than ten, mostly known through broadcasts and newspapers.

"Then what rank is this girl..." Mrs. Dai now regarded the General Evaluation as a god.

"They don't participate in the General Evaluation. They are formidable. If they participated, we would all have to go wash feet for *Those People*..."

"Wash feet?"

"Mm... anyway, Mom, you wouldn't understand."

Dai Dehou looked at his daughter, who was smiling and pouting. Suddenly, he felt that his daughter had become a stranger. Where was the appearance of that Little San Niang of the past? Her manner of speaking and expression were very similar to the Senator's daughter just now...

Soon the meal was over. Dai Yan returned the clean food trays and milk bottles. After the meal, half an hour was left for parents and children to spend time together.

Seeing that Mrs. Dai and the daughter had finished talking, Dai Dehou considered it for a moment and still opened his mouth.

"Yan'er, has Chief Luo visited?"

The one who recommended his daughter to study here was Chief Luo, but Dai Dehou was not a naturalized citizen and didn't even know Chief Luo's full name now. He didn't understand what position he held or how much power he had. Naturally, he couldn't figure out what this Chief Luo meant regarding Yan'er. In fact, apart from the accidental encounter in East Gate Market back then, they had never met again. The matter of recommendation for the daughter was requested by his third brother taking him along, but that Chief was said to work in some restricted area. They hadn't personally met this mysterious Chief either, only entrusting a letter to be sent over.

"He comes every week! He brings me lots of delicious food and tells me to study hard!"

Mentioning Chief Luo, Dai Yan seemed to remember something. She mysteriously took out a few candies from her school uniform pocket and handed them to Mrs. Dai.

"Mom, take these back for little brother. These are milk candies given to me by the Chief. They aren't sold outside!"

Seeing his daughter was ignorant and he couldn't ask anything more, Dai Dehou didn't ask further.

The time for gathering was always short. Teacher Xu soon stood up to announce that the visitation session was about to end. The Spring Break was in a few days, and he hoped parents would pay attention to their children's safety issues. Then he said a few nonsense words about the Chiefs thanking the parents for their support and that they would cultivate their children into talents. Finally, he gave the students' report cards to the visiting parents one by one. This was the best thing to show off to the neighbors nowadays.

Dai Dehou and Mrs. Dai left the school. There was still two hours before his work started, but he had already asked for leave.

The two got on the train first. Dai Dehou was constantly thinking in his heart.

I wonder if Chief Luo has taken a fancy to our Yan'er? No matter how dear a daughter is, she has to marry anyway. Besides, being a concubine for Chief Luo would be her blessing. If she could climb up to Chief Luo, it would be great if his son could also come to this National School to study. Maybe the other party could also put in a word for their family's housing land.

Of course, he had no bottom in his heart. Nowadays, he had no house or property, and couldn't even afford a decent dowry. Besides, it was a bit early to marry off his daughter. He heard that Australia didn't have the custom of child brides, and the female Chiefs particularly hated this.

"Father, do you think if we go beg Chief Luo, would he recommend Yu'er for admission too?" Mrs. Dai flip-flopped through the report card and suddenly spoke up.

"Huh?" Dai Dehou hadn't come back to his senses yet. "How would I know..."

"How about writing a letter and letting Yan'er take it to Chief Luo when she returns to school after the break?"

"That's a good idea!"

Dai Dehou suddenly became energetic. He held Mrs. Dai's hand, feeling that the family's future had hope.

"President Zhang, this progress won't do."

Yang Yun and Zhang Xingpei had just returned to the command post from the Ma'袅 New District under construction, bringing along Dai Xiu, life secretaries, apprentices, and guards.

Although the plot of land adjacent to the highway had been leveled, most of the thirty buildings scattered within it were still digging foundations after three months of construction. Only a few buildings near the highway had been built up to two stories. According to this progress, Yang Yun's drafted new round of housing allocation plan was just a pie in the sky.

"If you want fast progress, either give me people or give me equipment. There are a lot of rocks underground here, and the explosives allocated to me are not enough."

Zhang Xingpei sat on a reclining chair, enjoying the hot towel face wash just brought by his life secretary, his tone revealing laziness.

His lofty ambitions when he took office had long been worn away by reality. The entire team of indigenous cadres for civil construction, plus most of the workers being crooked melons and cracked dates[1] or novices rejected by the General Construction Company. Although many temporary workers were organized to help, the progress remained sluggish and accidents were continuous.

Every day at work, Zhang Xingpei spent most of his energy cursing people, but he got tired of cursing too much.

"How about this, I'll add a thousand people to your workforce, but you must guarantee the construction period!"

"You still have surplus manpower over there?"

Zhang Xingpei was a bit puzzled. What Lingao lacked most currently was manpower. As the operation gradually spread out, every place needed it, especially technical manpower, which every department was fighting for.
