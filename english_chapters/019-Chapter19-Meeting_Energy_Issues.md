Chapter 19 Meeting - Energy Issues

"Then let's start with energy aspects first." Xiao Zishan turned his head to the Energy Group, "Energy is the key to everything. As long as we have electricity, we can use any tools from modern machines to computers - these superior equipments that comprehensively surpass the ancients. What does the Energy Group think about our power supply problem?"

The one who stood up to speak in the Energy Group was Chang Kaishen. As a temporary worker, he had worked in a subsidiary enterprise of a certain power group for five years. He belonged to the type of people who did the most work, took the least money, had no credit, and took the blame.

"Based on the situation we are going to face, it is more appropriate to adopt a power strategy mainly based on hydropower, supplemented by thermal power and wind power.

"Hydropower has many benefits, I won't explain much here. The biggest benefit for our team is that it doesn't need supplementary fuel, it's a one-time construction, and can be used almost indefinitely.

"Currently, rural small hydropower equipment is quite simple, installation difficulty is low, and project investment is also very small. Power generation uses diversion channels, and it can operate with a water head of 5-6 meters. This type of equipment technology is already very mature. Small and micro units have achieved serialized and standardized manufacturing in China, maintenance is convenient, and the price is also very low.

"At the same time, we also need thermal power. The prime mover of thermal power can use multiple methods. Diesel generators are convenient to use, do not need to be set up, and are not restricted by the environment. They will be used as the main power generation means adopted in the early stage of our landing."

At this time someone raised a hand: "Diesel will be used up one day, what to do then?"

"It's relatively easy to find substitute products for diesel engines. I remember peanut oil can also be used." Someone in the Energy Group said.

"Hehe, I don't know if peanut oil can be used, but diesel engines can be modified into gas engines." Chang Kaishen thought for a moment, "When I was in the countryside, I saw many small power stations using gas engines. It shouldn't be difficult."

"I think we can produce diesel in the future." Xiao Zishan said, "Continue."

"Okay," he continued, "Based on the attitude of not putting all eggs in one basket, medium and small power diesel generators, small hydropower and small wind turbines are all needed. In addition, we need to bring some medium power hydropower units so that we can expand the capacity of the units when we have sufficient engineering capabilities later. As for wind turbines, although there are problems of too small power and unstable power generation, the installation is simple, and they are more suitable as backup power sources for living areas, independent strongholds and systems."

He smiled: "Of course, electricity is not that simple. It also involves a series of problems such as transmission and distribution, and voltage transformation. This is relatively professional, so I won't explain it. The specific plan will take a quite long time to come up with."

The next topic was still answered by the Energy Group, that is, the substitution of petroleum products. The Transmigrators not only need generators, they also need to use motorcycles, cars and small boats. Whether gasoline or diesel, they cannot be stored for a long time. If fuel self-sufficiency cannot be achieved, there is no need to bring too much of these things.

"Hehe, I dare not agree with the meeting host's words," Luo Duo, who stood up to speak next in the Energy Group, had posted a large number of long posts about energy during online discussions, "But it is said that the host is a liberal arts student, understandable."

Xiao Zishan's face turned red instantly. His biggest grudge was "liberal arts student" becoming a contemptuous evaluation. He suppressed his grief and indignation, pretending to be calm.

"Actually, what we want to discuss is still a prime mover problem." Luo Duo obviously didn't feel the host's grudge, "Whether it's boats, cars, or motorcycles, they can all be driven using non-petroleum fuels. So the problem of petroleum substitutes is not a problem we urgently need to solve.

"Basically, prime movers using petroleum fuels can all be modified to be driven by gas engines. Of course, there will be a certain loss in power. However, at the end of World War II, Germans experimentally installed gas generators on armored personnel carriers and tanks, so the power aspect is also acceptable. The technology of gas generators is very simple and practical, and the difficulty of realization is very low.

"Then let's not forget the steam engine. How many years have gasoline engines and diesel engines been available? The steam engine is the engine of the Industrial Revolution."

"Is there a place to buy steam engines now? Don't say you plan to ask us to build them." Someone in the Mechanics Group spoke up.

"You guys doing mechanics, isn't it easy to make a steam engine? That's a 19th-century product!" Luo Duo asked back, "Our prime movers cannot always rely on reserves to run. One day they will be consumed."

"We really haven't made a steam engine," A small group whispered in the Mechanics Group, and Ma Qianzhu stood up, "Everyone understands the principle of the steam engine, and there are many ready-made design data. We have confidence to build it. The boiler is the main difficulty. It depends on what level our materials can reach. This depends on the level of the metallurgy department."

"Currently, the metallurgy department is also counted in the Industrial Group." Xiao Zishan explained, "I remember there are professionals in this field."

"Correct, we have a university student majoring in metallurgy." Several people laughed loudly, and a young boy smiled embarrassedly.

"Coordinate a plan within your group first. Please continue."

"That's all I can think of for now." Luo Duo seemed very excited, showing a bit of tired expression.

"Why not consider biodiesel?" Someone asked, "There have been quite a few reports on this recently, and many countries have entered the practical stage."

"Right, I remember there is a kind of kerosene tree in Hainan. The oil flowing out from cutting the bark can light lamps."

"It can only be used to light lamps, it is not real kerosene." Ma Qianzhu talked eloquently there, "Biodiesel is not a simple technology. Although there are many kinds of oil crops that can be used as raw materials, including oil tea, stinking tung oil, pistacia chinensis, bamboo tung, etc., the oil produced cannot be directly used as diesel. It must undergo a series of modification treatments. In addition, no matter what kerosene tree or other oil plants you have, having just a few trees or a small patch of forest is useless. generally, such planting bases must be over a hundred mu to form an effective supply."

"By the way, I want to point out one point. Oil naan must grow to a diameter at breast height of 40-50 centimeters to produce oil. Judging from current discoveries, in Hainan it is only produced in areas with better water temperature environments than Lingao and Danzhou, such as Sanya, Ledong, Dongfang, Changjiang, and Baisha." Someone in the Agricultural Group spoke up.

"We can boil pine root oil. The Japanese did this during World War II. They could refine aviation gasoline without any special equipment."

"That's right, but this cost-effectiveness ratio is too pitiful. The Japanese mobilized almost the whole people to refine a mere tens of thousands of barrels, and Hainan doesn't have so many pine roots for us to dig."

"What about alcohol?" The Biofuel Party continued their efforts.

"Can be used as a substitute, but the calorific value of alcohol is too low, and there is the problem of engine carbon deposition. It is not an ideal substitute."

"Regarding the substitution of petroleum products, I have another view." Another person stood out, "My name is Zhong Lishi, engaged in the design of oil shale dry distillation equipment. I once designed oil shale refining equipment for a refinery in Danzhou City, Hainan.

"The city has abundant oil shale reserves. Products dry distilled from oil shale can be further refined into various petroleum products. From this point of view, manufacturing gasoline and diesel is not a problem."

"Where is Danzhou?" Someone below whispered.

"Just to the west of Lingao. Very close."

"Then this resource is really good."

"I'll introduce briefly. Changpo oil shale has an oil content of 5.1%, associated with lignite. Changpo mine has two main ore bodies. Thicknesses are 6 meters and 44.5 meters respectively. Mining method is mainly open-pit mining.

"We can adopt Maoming-style furnace for processing. Processing capacity is 50 tons of ore per furnace per day, oil recovery rate 60%. Combined with Changpo oil shale's 5.1% oil content, each furnace can produce 1.5 tons of crude oil per day, not including by-products like gasoline and ammonia.

"This kind of furnace can be built without too many resources and manpower. putting into production a small factory with daily processing of 1600 tons, that is... 32 furnaces, plus 2 gas heating furnaces, 1 ventilation machine room, 2 scrubbers, 2 cooling towers, 2 chimneys - I have ready-made design drawings for these, and equipment manufacturing difficulty is not big. Such a factory can obtain 48 tons of crude oil a day, and can also obtain by-products such as gasoline, ammonia, gas, and phenol. All are very useful.

"The crude oil quality of oil shale is very good and can be refined into high-quality diesel. So I think diesel engines and gasoline engines can both operate normally, no need for any gas engines."

"Daily processing of 1600 tons!" Luo Duo jumped up, "Even if we all go to carry stones, it won't be enough!"

"For an oil shale refinery, this is already a very small scale," Zhong Lishi wore a profound smile of a senior intellectual, "In reality, trains and belt conveyors are used for transportation. The design output of the above oil factory is not as much as a set of devices in a certain shale oil factory in reality. The oil factory I served has several sets of refining devices with stronger capacity than this. The processing capacity of one of their furnaces is 200 tons.

"If you feel Changpo's oil yield is too low, the oil shale produced in Huangxian and Penglai, Shandong has the best quality, with oil content reaching 22%. If we still don't have oil exploitation capability within ten or twenty years, we can consider taking Shandong down first."

The crowd below whispered again. Several people in the Sports Group were looking through the map of China.

"Let this be included in the long-term plan by the Energy Group, depending on what level our manufacturing industry can reach." Wen Desi spoke up, "Let's continue." He looked at Xiao Zishan, who nodded.
