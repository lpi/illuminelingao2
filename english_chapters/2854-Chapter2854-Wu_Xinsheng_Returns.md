# Chapter 2854: Wu Xinsheng Returns

"You're a Section Chief now; what favor could you possibly need from us?" He Xiaoyue teased. She had seen in the *Internal Reference* that shortly after Wu Xinsheng went to the Nansha Mill to guide the work, he was formally appointed as the Deputy Section Chief of the Industry Section of Nansha County, in charge of textile promotion and training within the county.

"I lack everything except people," Wu Xinsheng said as he casually took off his hat and went to hang it on the hook behind the door. It didn't catch and slipped down. He hurriedly used the stump of his left arm to catch it.

In that moment, his left sleeve slid down, revealing a patch of scars on the stump.

He Xiaoyue instantly stiffened all over—yes, wasn't that the scar Zhou Suniang had mentioned?

Although she didn't know how Zhou Suniang knew, the fact that they were "old acquaintances" was beyond doubt!

He Xiaoyue became attentive and intentionally asked, "Section Chief Wu, is your trip to Nansha a homecoming in glory?"

"Oh?" Wu Xinsheng was somewhat surprised. "How did you know I am from Nansha?"

"Hee hee, it's a secret!" He Xiaoyue scrutinized Wu Xinsheng again. In a trance, she felt he seemed to bear some resemblance to Zhou Suniang. "Tell us, what exactly is the matter?"

"Like I said last time, I want to bring two girls over to learn lace making..."

"Didn't the Store Manager already agree to this? Let them come to work next Monday."

"Now I want to add one more person. A girl, preparing to learn clothing design."

"Adding a person is just adding a person," He Xiaoyue wondered. "We don't make the decisions anyway..."

Wu Xinsheng said, "The Store Manager said she needs to ask if you are willing to be the mentor."

He Xiaoyue hesitated. She didn't really want to take this on. She was already too busy with her own work, and now she had to mentor a newcomer from scratch. And this newcomer was a blank sheet of paper; starting from zero would definitely consume a lot of time.

"Willing! Willing!" Guo Xi'er jumped straight in. "Having another girl makes it livelier!"

"Haha, I knew you'd say that." Wu Xinsheng turned his eyes to He Xiaoyue, seemingly probing for her opinion.

"Since Xi'er has said so, I have no objection either." Seeing her active stance, He Xiaoyue couldn't refuse sternly. She looked at Guo Xi'er and said, "In that case, you have to be a good master."

"No problem, no problem," Guo Xi'er said enthusiastically. "I will definitely impart everything I know!"

"Good, good, good." Wu Xinsheng was also very happy. "I knew you were all warm-hearted good sisters..."

"Aye, aye, let's not talk about this." He Xiaoyue had developed a strong interest in the matter of Wu Xinsheng and Zhou Suniang. She immediately brewed a pot of tea for him, pulled him to sit down, and said they should "catch up." Although Guo Xi'er wasn't very smart about many things, she was very "savvy" in this regard. Knowing He Xiaoyue wanted to pump Wu Xinsheng for information, she quickly slipped out to bring in a mixed fruit platter used for guests.

Wu Xinsheng was somewhat baffled by their enthusiasm. When they worked together, their relationship was good but not intimate. Firstly, there wasn't much common language between general staff and designers, and secondly, Guo Xi'er's status was relatively sensitive. So usually, they kept a bit of distance.

But enthusiasm is always a good thing. Even though he was a "Section Chief," strictly speaking, there were plenty of things he needed their help with.

"Master Wu, you said you are from Nansha. Do you have any family left?"

"There's been no one left in the family for a long time," Wu Xinsheng said. "I only had a younger sister, who was sold by human traffickers."

"Have you never thought of finding her?"

"I have, but where can I look?" Wu Xinsheng smiled bitterly. "I only heard she was sold to a very faraway place. After I went to Nansha, I tried to find the trafficker, but surely enough, he was long gone from Nansha. Besides, after so many years, even if she's alive, her appearance has probably changed a lot."

He Xiaoyue felt a certain possibility growing stronger. She asked tentatively, "How many years younger is she than you?"

"About seven or eight years, maybe." Wu Xinsheng scratched his head hesitantly.

He Xiaoyue's eyes lit up. She examined Wu Xinsheng carefully again, staring until Wu Xinsheng felt creepy and asked uneasily, "What's wrong?"

"Nothing... nothing..." Knowing she had lost her composure, He Xiaoyue quickly shook her head. "By the way, didn't you have any tokens or keepsakes?"

"We were destitute; what keepsakes could there be..." At this point, Wu Xinsheng seemed to remember something. "Right, there was half a comb. When we were separated, I broke the comb Mom left us in half, one piece for each of us..." He seemed to fall into memory as he spoke. "It's been so many years, I almost forgot!"

"So, is the comb still there?"

"It should be there, I suppose." Wu Xinsheng frowned. "Before going to Nansha, I packed up the odds and ends I didn't use and deposited them at the Cadre Department's storage."

"Take it out and let us see..." Guo Xi'er blurted out. He Xiaoyue had intended to circle around to seeing the comb, but she hadn't expected this little girl to just say it outright.

"Half a broken comb, what's there to see?" Wu Xinsheng found it strange.

"Just want to see it, that's all."

Wu Xinsheng was very surprised and hesitated, "Alright, I'll look for it when I go to pick up my things in the next few days." Then he added, "About the girl we sent over..."

"Leave it to me, leave it to me," Guo Xi'er agreed repeatedly. "I'll teach her well!"

Seeing Guo Xi'er agreeing so unprincipledly and patting her chest in guarantee, He Xiaoyue hurriedly interjected: "What is the specific situation of this girl? Is she literate?"

"She is the sister of our Nansha Textile Mill's General Manager, named Chen Yue," Wu Xinsheng said. "Literate, and knows needlework and such."

"If she's literate, that's easier." He Xiaoyue felt slightly relieved. "How old?"

"Sixteen, I think." Wu Xinsheng said. "She's quite smart; she should be able to learn!"

"The Big Manager's sister... so she's a young lady!" Guo Xi'er flinched a little.

"Aye, she is the General Manager's sister, true, but she is very down-to-earth, not some pampered young lady." Wu Xinsheng said. "She's skilled at spinning, weaving, and needlework. Our General Manager Chen values this sister very much and wants her to have a promising future!"

"This brother is really nice!" Guo Xi'er said. Seeing the somewhat lonely expression on Wu Xinsheng's face next to her, she immediately added, "You're pretty good too!"

He Xiaoyue found her disjointed speech both annoying and funny. She quickly changed the subject to smooth things over. The three discussed the upcoming training until a shop assistant came to announce the arrival of another customer, and only then did they disperse.

After Wu Xinsheng left, they attended to customers and received guidance from Liu Shuixin. Time passed unknowingly until past six in the evening. By the time they tidied up the office, the sky outside was already turning dark.

Both were single and lived in the dormitory, with decent incomes. After work, they usually paired up to eat out and shop before returning to the dormitory to rest.

Stepping out, the moon was already climbing the inky sky. The straight streets were lined with brilliant lights on both sides. Pedestrians were bustling, orderly yet lively. Both felt as if it were a dream; the past dozen years had flown by like a revolving lantern, and the road of the New World was right beneath their feet.

Due to the population increase and the transfer of some industrial capacity, the demand for labor in Lingao was no longer as tight as before. Working hours had been shortened, increasing the leisure time of naturalized citizens, which indirectly stimulated commercial development. The original night market had extended from ten o'clock to midnight.

The two strolled leisurely into a medium-sized ready-to-wear shop. Naturally, they wouldn't buy these so-called "ready-made clothes" like ordinary naturalized citizens; they came here mainly to understand consumer preferences. Although the two weren't stunning beauties, their "Australian-style" attire, combined with the quiet and elegant temperament cultivated by working at Wanzi Pavilion, attracted countless gazes as soon as they entered.

"Ladies, is there anything you'd like to see?" A salesgirl immediately came up to greet them. He Xiaoyue just smiled and listened to her introduction, when suddenly she saw a familiar outfit—it was a simplified version of the "Drizzle on Duckweed." Although the fabric had been changed to cheaper civilian cloth and the effect was much inferior, the stylistic intent remained.

Seeing her gaze fall on this outfit: "Miss has truly good taste. This set is our shop's best-seller. They say the designer received guidance from the Weaver Girl in a dream to create this outfit. Some even say she is the reincarnation of the Weaver Girl..."

Guo Xi'er was already suppressing laughter. He Xiaoyue managed to remain calm and continued nodding.

Perhaps feeling these words weren't enough to move them, the salesgirl brought out her "killer weapon"—a newly released copy of *Lingao Spring*. This was a recently published fashion magazine.

"Miss, look, this outfit is the 'Headline New Style' of the latest issue!"

The two, who were about to burst out laughing, suddenly became extremely astonished. Guo Xi'er narrowed the magazine and flipped it open, momentarily speechless. *Lingao Spring* was the most authoritative fashion magazine published locally. The Headline New Style of every issue was carefully selected and voted on by relevant Senators. It had to be unique in design and meet certain sales requirements. It could be called a true fashion weather vane. In the past, this Headline New Style had always been monopolized by Senator designers. She could be considered a deserted record-breaker!

"What?! Really?" He Xiaoyue asked anxiously.

"Really!" Guo Xi'er said. "It's 'Drizzle on Duckweed'!" As she spoke, she shoved the magazine into He Xiaoyue's hands. "Look! Look!"

He Xiaoyue was flustered and nervous. In her urgency, her vision blurred, and she couldn't see anything clearly, asking repeatedly: "Where? Where?"

After finally calming down, she saw clearly—the Headline New Style really was it! The accompanying photo was a rendering of a female Senator wearing it. Although she didn't recognize the person, that figure and temperament were not something a naturalized citizen could possess.

He Xiaoyue looked and looked, and finally laughed aloud. Once she started laughing, she couldn't stop. She laughed until she trembled like a flower branch, her lower abdomen sore, almost unable to support herself, wanting to squat down.

Since escaping from the Chastity Court, she had had many happy moments, but she had never wanted to laugh like she did today. A joy from the bottom of her heart, like a volcanic eruption, surged violently from the depths of her soul.
