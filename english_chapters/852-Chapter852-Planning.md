# Chapter 852 - Planning

Guo Yi naturally wouldn't let him wriggle out of it so easily—he was counting on the government to serve as his demolition crew. Although there weren't many buildings outside the city that needed demolishing, land acquisition was still complex work. Many landlords, great households, and clan organizations would make the process too difficult if handled solely by the transmigrators themselves. Although Guangzhou was essentially already in the Elder Council's pocket, the time had not yet come for open and brazen political control.

"They're just country bumpkins—how worldly can they be?" Guo Yi wore a smile. "Besides, we're not stingy people unwilling to spend money. With government help, what matter can't be accomplished? Surely no one will be asked to work for nothing."

"Well, this, um..." Li Xijue really didn't dare commit to much—Australian affairs could be made into something major or minor. Nowadays, it had become a thorny matter that everyone in officialdom wanted to avoid. After thinking it over, he had no choice but to continue his delaying tactics:

"This matter is of great importance. Allow me to return and think it over carefully..."

Guo Yi gave a cold laugh, picked up his teacup, and took a sip.

"Such a trivial matter, and you still need to think it over?"

Li Xijue felt a chill—not because Guo Yi was radiating some powerful fighting aura, but because he recalled the "grand spectacle" of just a few months ago: transmigrator warships bombarding Humen, their forces arriving at Baie Tan, the burning of Wuyang Post Station. He had witnessed firsthand how government troops had collapsed at first contact, how the transmigrators' advance to the walls of Guangzhou had been like crushing rotten wood.

He was hardly trusted within the Governor-General's staff. If the negotiations went well, fine; but the slightest mishap would make him a ready-made scapegoat. If he offended the transmigrators and provoked some incident, the Governor might well simply hand him over to appease them.

Thinking thus, a desolate sense of having no support enveloped him. He could only nod: "I wonder what insight Master Guo might offer on this matter?"

"I have no particular insight, but I do have a proposal here." Guo Yi's expression softened again. "This matter will certainly not put you in a difficult position—not only will it not inconvenience you, but it will benefit everyone..."

On Huifu Street, a temporary "Grand World Project Team" was established. The project team was headed by Hong Shuiyin, the Hong Kong Trade Representative. He currently had nothing to do in Hong Kong—the Dutch ships wouldn't arrive for several months at least—so he was temporarily transferred here to lead the new project. The other key member was the future Grand World's "General Manager": Zhang Yikun.

The Grand World project had originally been proposed by Zhang Yikun. In the old time-space, Zhang Yikun had run a small business, and his commercial skills and public relations abilities were quite good. But in Lingao, there was little room for him to exercise these talents, so he had spent his time idling about in the Commerce Department. Li Mei already felt her own workload was too light; his situation was even worse. Being so idle, he'd been conscripted by Hu Qingbai to serve as a part-time teacher at Fangcaodi, instructing everything from arithmetic to language to natural science.

Getting the Guangzhou Grand World project approved had immediately boosted Zhang Yikun's standing. As the project's initiator and planner, and given his relevant expertise, he easily won the appointment as the Grand World's operations manager in the open recruitment held by the Organization Department.

At this moment, he was in a courtyard on Huifu Street, looking at the draft design for the future Grand World—Li Xiaolü had hand-drawn it just a few days ago. To ensure speedy construction, Mei Wan had specifically instructed Mei Lin and Li Xiaolü to remain in Guangzhou to support the Grand World project. To facilitate her work, Li Xiaolü was provided with a set of professional drafting tools and even special lighting—powered by a hand-cranked generator assigned to the Guangzhou Station.

The guiding design philosophy of the "Grand World" was essentially an armed trading post combined with a shopping mall. Li Xiaolü had no concept of what this peculiar hybrid should look like. Although in the old time-space she had spent all day every day doing drafting work, she had never drawn structural diagrams for a bastion, let alone one with commercial functions. Hong Shuiyin and the others had explained and sketched until she finally understood what they envisioned.

However, the draft she had produced was still quite far from their vision. At least the basic shape was there now. The drawing showed a "pentagonal building complex"—figuratively speaking, like the "Pentagon."

"Now we're getting somewhere!" Zhang Yikun nodded repeatedly. "But the internal structure..."

"We'll refine it gradually. It would be best if you could give me a clear functional and structural sketch. That way I can make a proper design." Li Xiaolü stretched. "Some concepts can't be designed—they conflict with building function and structure."

"Of course, of course. We'll defer primarily to your professional opinion." Zhang Yikun nodded repeatedly. He was very courteous to the female architect, not only because she was quite professionally capable, but also because of the rumor that she had an ambiguous relationship with someone on the Executive Committee. People had seen that someone enter and exit her apartment overnight.

"There's also the geological data," Li Xiaolü said. "Next, I need to design the building structure. You'll need to get me the geological data for the construction site as soon as possible."

"We'll send people to survey as soon as we confirm the site." Zhang Yikun looked at this somewhat listless woman and thought that although she was fair-skinned and delicate-looking, with a scholarly demeanor, she had no particularly impressive figure or features. She was also rather inactive, spending all day with a languid air. How had she caught the eye of someone on the Executive Committee?

There were multiple proposals for the Grand World's site, but the project team's basic requirement was that it be outside the city walls and backing onto the Pearl River.

Being outside the city meant being away from the government's core area of control, allowing greater freedom of action and making it easier for the authorities to turn a blind eye. Additionally, it meant more open land, making acquisition, demolition, and construction far more convenient than attempting urban renewal inside Guangzhou. The Guangzhou Station had learned this lesson: when building the facilities on Huifu Street and elsewhere, just getting construction materials into the city each day had been a headache. The roads were narrow and winding; all building materials had to be carried to the site by hand. The low efficiency of transporting building materials had significantly delayed the entire construction schedule.

However, the Grand World couldn't be too far from the city either—too far and it would be difficult to attract sufficient customers, while also increasing road construction costs. Thus, the proposal to build the Grand World in Huangpu was rejected—the distance from Huangpu to Guangzhou City, unless the Station also built a small railway to transport customers, would simply fail to draw clientele.

"No more than 5 kilometers from the city walls—under good road conditions, that's still an hour's walk. This would significantly reduce how often city residents visit our Grand World."

If a city resident left home, averaged half an hour to exit the city, then walked another hour, the round trip alone would take three hours. Spending too much time traveling would keep him from visiting the Grand World frequently. The group concluded that 2 to 3 kilometers was optimal.

Backing onto the Pearl River was primarily for convenient water intake and drainage. The Grand World's water consumption would be enormous—wells and small streams could not suffice. As for drainage, since ancient times, great rivers had served as natural drainage channels.

Building along the Pearl River would also facilitate cargo transport and the projection of deterrent force. If necessary, naval gunboats could anchor offshore, conveniently supporting the trading post's defense or covering an evacuation.

After discussion, they finally decided on a location about 2 kilometers east of the Great East Gate, then slightly south—roughly where the Dashatou used goods market or the Star & Light Electronics City would be in the old time-space. This area was alluvial land along the Pearl River, mostly unclaimed official land with minimal acquisition and demolition requirements. The area was also spacious enough to accommodate their ambitions.

"However, to build something as enormous as the Grand World, building materials will be a major problem. We can't rely on Lingao shipping them to us..." Mei Lin looked at the design drawing. Although it didn't fully match Zhang Yikun's vision, in terms of scale it followed the group's specifications exactly. Each side of this "Pentagon" was a full 200 meters long. The Grand World's perimeter was almost an entire kilometer.

A building complex with a one-kilometer perimeter would be practically a small city by the standards of this era. Mei Lin had worked as a project manager before and naturally understood the engineering volume and the quantity of building materials such a scale would require.

"Hasn't the Planning Commission agreed to establish building materials factories and light industrial enterprises right outside Guangzhou City?"

"That's why I say the scope of the land acquisition can't be too small. We need to factor in the construction land for supporting enterprises." Mei Lin said, "We can source bricks, tiles, and stone locally, but we'll absolutely have to build our own timber processing plant—traditional lumber processing is far too inefficient."

"Ideally we'd build our own brickworks too. Traditional brick firing couldn't supply anywhere near enough volume," said Hong Shuiyin. When he was doing construction in Hong Kong, he had initially purchased bricks and tiles from kilns in Kowloon and elsewhere. But he soon discovered that these purchases were unsuitable—the dimensions were too large, and the production volume too low. Procurement agents had soon traveled so far to secure adequate bricks and tiles that transportation costs exceeded the cost of the bricks themselves.

"But would it be appropriate to site those factories next to the Grand World?" Zhang Yikun raised a concern. Brick-making and timber processing were both highly polluting. Placing them next to a commercial center would severely impact the environment.

"We can find another location, and we don't even have to invest ourselves. Let local magnates invest. We'll contribute technology and equipment as our stake," said Hong Shuiyin. "With a guaranteed market, they'll definitely want to invest, right?"

"We need a cement plant," said Mei Lin. "Shipping cement from Lingao isn't practical. The same goes for lime production. All of that needs to be solved locally."

Building materials were low in value and high in transport cost. Even cement, which had relatively higher value, had a sales radius of no more than 500 kilometers in modern society.

Although local production of the raw materials for cement was limited in Guangzhou, the production sites weren't far away, and all were connected by the Pearl, East, and West Rivers. Transportation was convenient.

"And a timber processing plant and woodworks factory," said Hong Shuiyin. "In the near term, we can process lumber and produce woodwork for the Grand World project. Later, we can supply the Hong Kong shipyard. In the future, we can support the New Guangzhou project."
