# Chapter 592 - Wudaokou Financial Meeting

Another effect of visiting the church was to give him some peace of mind—he had originally suspected the Australians worshipped devils and drew extraordinary power from them. Now seeing such a magnificent church, cross, and priest, his suspicions vanished. He immediately attributed it to extraordinary wisdom and power bestowed by God. Finally, he could leave Lingao with a calm mind.

It was a calm and leisurely day. The Bairen Industrial District continued to spew smoke of various colors, and continuous wastewater poured into the Wenlan River from the treatment plant's drain. The temperature gradually rose, and the river water seemed greener than in previous years. Vaguely, it emitted a stench. Water in some diversion channels even stank, requiring people to clean it daily.

In a relatively remote block of East Gate Market—yes, East Gate Market had now formed blocks, not just a single street like in the past. Cross streets extending from the Central Avenue were opened one after another as the avenue extended. New blocks formed; land was enclosed by fences, stuck with signs marked with strange text. Some places were already starting construction of new houses; others lay idle, allowing commoners to plant vegetables.

At the intersection of Fifth Street, commonly known as Wudaokou (Five Way Intersection), stood a newly completed tea house. The first floor sold tea leaves, while the second and third floors were tea seating. This place was a new property opened by the Cooperative. As a mass consumer daily necessity, tea consumption in Lingao was increasing. Lingao did not produce tea locally; all was imported from Fujian. The Cooperative opened this tea house to sell tea not only to regulate people's livelihood but also to withdraw currency.

The Executive Committee and the Standing Committee had agreed that private capital could be appropriately introduced into many non-critical industries. This tea house had capital investment from several Tiandihui clients, accounting for 49% of total capital—these clients were now planting tea, an economic crop, in hilly areas under guidance to meet domestic demand.

The guest seats on the second and third floors were clean and furnished, attracting many tea guests. The types of tea guests were mostly local small landlords and merchants who had recently prospered, and indigenous employees of various increasingly expanding departments.

The most frequent customers of Wudaokou Tea House were Elders from the fiscal and financial systems. This place was very close to the newly opened Delung Bank Head Office. Many people often came here to chat and rest. Gradually, this place replaced the cold, square lounge in the original Financial Commission compound in Bairen City, which was full of primary industrial simple lines and a sense of concentration.

Tea leaves were imported from Fujian, then underwent simple sorting, re-processing and packaging by machinery at the Light Industry Ministry's tea factory. Most famous Fujian teas of this spacetime could be seen here. The most popular was Oolong tea, which had already appeared at this time.

This was a microcosm of the intersection between the diligent, simple, pioneering Celestial merchants and the new forces of Lingao. Fujian tea, Lingao-style packaging and service, cooperation between indigenous merchants and monopoly SOEs. It operated very naturally and smoothly. After Wudaokou Tea House opened, it gradually became a gathering spot for Elders in the fiscal and financial sector. Even indigenous upstarts coming here for tea knew the third floor wasn't a place for them.

Elders' leisure lives were generally not very interesting, and finance people faced reports and numbers daily—to adapt to a future fiscal system without computers, subordinate departments of the General Fiscal Directorate were pushing "Manual Accounting." This reversing behavior was to avoid a day when computers were gone and everyone lost the ability to aggregate reports. Current computer systems were only used for some relatively complex accounting.

Days of reading reports, using abacuses, hand-cranked calculators, and moving slide rules made everyone complain endlessly, not to mention everyone was assigned apprentices. Apprentices, rather than helping, increased workload, making everyone's burden heavier for a time.

The more boring it was, the more importance was attached to leisure and relaxation. Thus this place became a daily must-visit for many, not only for chatting and bullshitting, but sometimes even work meetings were held here.

Long-term gatherings led fiscal and financial Elders to gradually form several small cliques here. Mainly the "Accounting Clique," "Bank Clique," and "Fiscal Tax Clique." Cliques weren't completely distinct; personnel often overlapped. These small factions loosely united, forming a faction later called "Wudaokou" in the Senate. This system lacked the scale of the Law Club, nor the rigorous thinking and organization of legal professionals, and certainly not the Marxism-Leninism Institute's grand ambition to lead everything—various small factions stood like forests within the group, despising each other's financial, economic, and fiscal concepts, buying no one's account. So in the Second Congress, the Financial Group failed to usurp a larger slice of power. Naturally, they didn't achieve as much as the Law Club.

In the primary coal-iron complex, finance, or the fiscal department under the current system, was an indispensable but not the most important department. Everyone was well aware of the possibility of gaining greater power.

"We are a service unit." On this issue, the Fiscal-Financial Clique's thinking was very unified.

The fiscal, financial, and tax systems had just undergone comprehensive restructuring after the recent Second Plenary Session. The original Fiscal and Financial Committee was split and adjusted into multiple departments. The new system finally had a formal Ministry of Finance; the nondescript audit department Cheka finally gained formal status; the tax department, which had lacked clear status, was also established. Besides formally taking over the County Grain Collection Bureau, a compromise product of the old Ming system, a new Tax Bureau was also being organized.

The original Delung Grain Bank was split into two departments. One kept the old name—Delung Grain Bank, continuing to undertake grain purchase, storage, and sales business. Delung's original currency issuance and financial business parts were spun off to become independently Delung Bank, currently temporarily playing a three-in-one role of central bank, specialized bank, and commercial bank.

The new Fiscal Comptroller Cheng Dong never came to Wudaokou, but he supported subordinates discussing professional issues here. The tea house was an informal setting; conversation was relaxed, unlike the formality of discussing issues in formal meetings. Many things could be said openly. So this place gradually became an important venue for operational departments to discuss and formulate policies.

The third floor consisted entirely of private rooms, with thin bamboo curtains hanging at the doors and some green plants for decoration. Some rooms were tiny, accommodating only four or five people chatting; others were large enough for over twenty to gather for a meeting. An indigenous waiter guarded the stair entrance to prevent unaware natives from barging onto the third floor. Secondly, to look after thermos bottles and tea leaves.

It was working hours now; most private rooms were empty. Only one was full of guests, seven or eight people sitting around a round table, joking with each other. Exchanges mainly concerned system business issues, and then the maid welfare that seemed to be within reach. Occasional "you know what I mean" laughter drifted out.

Hot tea and plates of fruit were on the table. The skylight on the roof was open; smoke from several cigarettes and cigars rose slowly upwards. This scene of curling green smoke earned them the nickname "Immortal's Gathering" from natives.

"Heard the quality of maids after training is quite good, much better than when just landed." Cheka head Yi Fan felt a bit frustrated, inevitably showing some dissoluteness. "Really want to get one back early to train personally."

Established for months, Cheka hadn't caught a "big fish" yet. Yi Fan was very disappointed. His audit work progressed at a snail's pace due to lack of suitable people. Everything had to start from scratch. And competition for resources was fierce. Take the most basic accounting training class for auditing; it started on a large scale under his utmost advocacy, but trained accountants were mostly intercepted by various departments. The Executive Committee seemed to suddenly wake up—to have departments and enterprises keep accounts and perfect financial systems, they needed accountants.

So Yi Fan ultimately got less than ten people. Adding apprentices he personally led and civilian staff not needing accounting/audit knowledge, he barely scraped together a football team's worth of manpower.

With these ten-odd people, learning while doing. Yi Fan spent ten times more energy than doing it himself—these fledgling auditors made mistakes everywhere; every document required his personal review. Result: he still hadn't cleared up the accounts of enterprises under Wu Nanhai's agricultural committee. his famous saying "Drag the Elder out and shoot him" became a laughing stock.

Ji An ate a mango: "The good-looking ones have to be raffled by bid; this is deliberately squeezing our property dry."

"I don't care at all." Wu Di flicked cigarette ash; a complete ash flew beautifully into a glass cup full of butts. This man was about 30, medium build, well-proportioned, muscular, quite handsome, attracting attention in a crowd.

"What are indigenous maids? Not looking like much, short and small," Wu Di expressed disdain. "Never mind looks, open their mouths and there's zero common language with modern people. I'm not interested at all."

"Then why claim the maid welfare fund?"

"Everyone has it, why shouldn't I," Wu Di said indifferently. "Besides, buying one back to do housework isn't bad. This kind of life secretary is only good for that."

Transmigrators rarely brought wives or girlfriends. Only this Wu Di not only brought a young beautiful wife but also abducted his sister-in-law. This guy made no secret of his ambiguous relationship with his sister-in-law, sometimes entering and exiting with all three together, drawing sideways glances from everyone. Du Wen privately repeatedly used his wife and sister-in-law as typical examples of "automatically putting on male power shackles, reduced to male appendages."

"You are truly the typical satiated man not knowing the hungry man's hunger—" Every time Yi Fan saw him, he really wanted to audit his accounts to see if he could drag him out and shoot him, preventing him from monopolizing too many resources alone. However, the Credit Department of Delung Bank where Wu Di currently worked hadn't done many transactions yet. This idea had to be dispelled.

"Cough." Jin Zhijiao coughed beside them. As the only female present, she was very unadapted to such topics, and had some personal uneasiness—would Old Hu want a concubine too?

Yi Fan noticed her reaction and hurriedly stopped discussing this issue, diverting to others. Not that he respected women, but simply because Jin Zhijiao was currently a major general of his; he had to win her over well.

Jin Zhijiao was the wife of Hu Muye, an engineer in Lingao Telecom. Graduated in accounting, she was very good at statistics. She was now number two in Cheka.

"Any new policies recently?" Yi Fan asked casually, flicking ash.

Delung Bank Planning Department Director Chen Ce looked at him and stubbed out his cigarette.

"Do you really not know or fake not knowing? The General Office of the Executive Committee issued a document on monetary system reform, asking us to supplement a detailed plan based on the last report."

"That draft for comments?" Yi Fan said, "Isn't that the report you submitted last time?"

Chen Ce submitted a report to the first Executive Committee a few months ago regarding fiscal and financial system reform. In this report, besides demanding reform of the Fiscal and Financial Committee system and separation of finance and taxation, he also raised the issue of monetary reform.

"Correct, largely still the framework I proposed. But one can see the Executive Committee is completely clueless about how to reform the monetary system, wavering severely."

"Not bad. At least the current fiscal system reform has a huge relationship with your report. Delung separated—say, was the ultimate goal of your report to split Delung?"

In the grain bank era, power within Delung was mainly held by people from the Planning Committee system; financial and accounting personnel were basically workers below.

Once separated, grain bank business was spun off, the banking system established, and the group eating financial accounting rice immediately shook themselves up. A batch of people got into middle management posts.

"Hehe, can't say that; it's the general trend!" Chen Ce remained composed. "A grain bank doing finance is too ridiculous; the name doesn't fit the reality. Can you imagine the PRC Ministry of Grain issuing banknotes?"

So-called base money is the central bank's liability. The central bank buys Treasury bonds to issue currency. So the first step of fiscal reform Chen Ce proposed was to turn Delung Grain Bank into Delung Bank. This step was now realized. That was why he proposed monetary reform.

"Didn't the PRC Ministry of Grain issue food stamps for many years? But we are more thorough, directly combining two into one." Yi Fan commented.

"You studied finance too; you must be clearest about the faults of our so-called circulation notes."

"Correct, so when you proposed Cheng Dong use grain as the standard, I approved." Yi Fan said. Using rice as a general equivalent for fully convertible paper money was feasible in the initial start-up period. In an underdeveloped region like Lingao, only rice could provide sufficient, credible credit guarantee, and through foreign trade, rice price—currency value—could be relatively easily stabilized within an acceptable fluctuation range.

"The biggest problem with pure grain circulation notes is that they are actually grain bank exchange receipts. Restrictions are too rigid; other assets must first act as grain before converting to currency. This no longer matches current socio-economic development." Yi Fan summarized, "However, that it passed back then was key because your move catered to Director Ma, that 'Industrialism' fanatic." Yi Fan laughed, "I have a feeling Director Ma essentially lacks understanding of currency, but has strong hostility towards finance. And craves complete manipulation of the financial system."

"Director Ma is a planned economy fanatic." Wu Di lit a new cigarette and said, "He also came up with a new monetary system plan."

"Oh, I want to see that. didn't know Director Ma had interest in finance and fiscal matters too."

"It's very long," Wu Di said. "I can summarize his thinking for you."

"Listening with respectful attention."

"Director Ma's monetary system in short is to control world currency issuance rights by controlling trade channels," Wu Di said. "His theory is: as long as you monopolize the logistics industry, you can monopolize the definition of currency. The Pound and US Dollar became international currencies successively because they monopolized commodity circulation."

Saying so, he pulled a notebook from his pocket: "I'll read a passage of his original text—

...Buying things has 2 prerequisites: A. someone sells, B. there is a channel to buy. Having only farmers, you can't buy rice; having only factories, you can't buy clothes. Currency must be used, and the logistics industry must handle the transfer. So monopolizing logistics means monopolizing currency definition. Modern Pounds and Dollars became international currencies sequentially; the key point is these two countries mastered sea power. Mastering sea power has two meanings: one is owning a monopoly merchant fleet others can't compete with. So you do all bulk trade; naturally, you have the right to choose pricing. The other is owning the world's number one navy, able to stop any route's trade anytime without fearing retaliation. The US and UK followed this model. The US can ignore who extracts Middle East oil, who manufactures half the world's industrial goods—as long as these things are priced in dollars..."

"Of course, if this can be achieved, it's beneficial in the short term; see the old spacetime's US." Chen Ce said. "His abacus beats the same as the Americans, relying on international currency credit to accumulate infinite debt. Most over-issued currency spins in the world market."

"In this plan, he has a four-step scheme," Wu Di said. "Phase one, let this new currency—let's call it Australian Dollar—buy our materials. Now we have circulation notes, just replace them directly; Phase two, we require Australian Dollars to buy others' materials, exchangeable with gold and silver; Phase three, require gold and silver must be priced in Australian Dollars; Phase four, we require everything priced in Transmigration Currency."

"The Director is a 'planning omnipotent, materials first' believer; to him, finance is essentially heresy." Chen Ce said with a smile.
