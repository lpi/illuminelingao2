# Chapter 102 - Salt Field (1)

The preliminary investigation in Nan'an Dong was carried out for two days. Accompanied by Ao Ya Fu, the survey team's investigation went very smoothly. Fa Shilu and Cui Yunhong were responsible for agriculture, forestry, and mineral resources respectively, while Mu Min investigated the local social conditions. The products of Nan'an Dong were quite abundant:

First were various forest resources. There were large patches of forest land in the mountains. Although the primitive slash-and-burn farming techniques of the locals had destroyed quite a bit, the reserves were still quite rich; the perennial woody cotton forests that Fa Shilu had been dreaming of were also discovered—obviously, the locals used this kind of cotton for spinning and weaving. There were also many wild plantains, lychees, longans, and jackfruit trees on the mountains, which were supplementary food sources for the locals. There were many betel nut trees, but for the transmigrators, they were useless except as trade goods for re-export.

Second, a large number of native rice seeds were found in the rice paddies here. This was a very useful gene pool for those involved in breeding—as long as there were enough rice seeds, new improved varieties could be continuously bred through hybridization. Fa Shilu discovered seventeen different rice varieties just in the paddy fields near Nan'an Village, and obtained five Shanlan upland rice varieties on the hillside slash-and-burn fields, including indica, japonica, and glutinous rice varieties.

Hainan Island itself is a main distribution area of wild rice in China, and the genetic advantage of rice seed diversity is very obvious. Lingao in the 21st century was a major seed production base for hybrid rice in China—Fa Shilu looked at the various samples collected and would smile even in his dreams! The father of hybrid rice in China might just be him...

Sweet potatoes had not yet started to be planted here, and the Li people didn't even know about this new crop. However, they planted some other tuber crops, the most common being a species of the Araceae family. This was often used as medicinal material in other places. Fa Shilu was not a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, but he knew that the taro of Araceae was slightly toxic—could this thing be eaten as a staple food? But judging from the planting area, it was obviously one of the main crops. Another common one was sweet potato, also called hairy potato (Dioscorea esculenta).

Regarding coarse grains, he discovered millet. Fa Shilu never knew that millet was grown in Hainan. Among the coarse grains sent by the locals after the Battle of Bairen Beach was millet, which puzzled the entire Agricultural Committee for a while. After consulting the locals, they learned that this was finger millet, a common coarse grain in Hainan with a very short maturity period.

Besides grain, he also found patches of wild ramie. It seemed that the Li people did not care much about agriculture, basically letting things take their own course without any field management. Fruits, ramie, and cotton were all in a wild state, and they only gathered and utilized them without planned cultivation.

Pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks were all free-range on the hillsides, without pens or feeding. So they didn't look very robust, though the number of cattle was unexpectedly large, including both water buffalo and yellow cattle. However, he didn't study animal husbandry and didn't understand the breed issues, so he would send professionals to check later.

"I really feel it's a waste," Fa Shilu lamented, "The agricultural conditions here are very good, but the agricultural level is only slightly better than primitive society."

"Stop lamenting," Wen Desi patted his shoulder, "Just look at those paddy fields on both banks of the Wenlan River, how much better are they? Far worse than the farmers in our hometown."

The harvest on Cui Yunhong's side was not so inspiring. Relying on the map from another time and space, he found important products: lignite, buried very shallow and mineable. There were also some stone resources, such as limestone and perlite, with small-scale reserves. But the distance was long and the roads were bad, so the value was not great. The rarest find was a small-scale tungsten vein, but it had no utilization value for the transmigrators.

The Li people maintained a respectful distance from this group of strange Han people, watching them hold strange things, climbing trees one moment, going into the fields the next, and standing aside drawing for half a day... However, children obviously had the greatest curiosity about new things. From watching from a distance at first, to slowly approaching, and finally starting to fiddle with the transmigrators' tools and items, they slowly began to communicate. Of course, most people couldn't communicate with the children; only a little rock sugar could be used to represent friendliness—this was what Wen Desi had instructed to bring before departure. Mu Min had a natural fondness for these compatriots from another time and space. She could speak Hainanese, plus the power of sugar, by the second day, she had a group of little followers around her.

Seeing this group of naked children running around like mud monkeys, Mu Min suddenly had an idea. This idea eventually became the first school of the Transmigration State in the Li area.

Just as the work team to the Li area was vigorously engaging in goodwill activities, another team of transmigrators led by Wang Luobin was advancing towards the nearby Maniao Peninsula. The goal was to solve the salt problem once and for all.

Salt is an indispensable necessity for human survival and an important raw material for modern chemical industry. For the Transmigration regime, they also urgently needed a material that could be circulated and exchanged. In the ancient society with backward commodity economy, nothing was more suitable as an exchange item than table salt. Moreover, the salt industry here had been very developed since ancient times. Lingao faced the Qiongzhou Strait, with many harbor branches and large natural tidal flats. The sodium chloride concentration in seawater was very high, generally above 1.5-2 Baumé degrees. In the dry season, the temperature was high, the wind was strong, the sunshine was long, and the rainfall was low, making it a good place for sea salt production. Salt production began in the Tang Dynasty, using the boiling method at that time. Because of the superior natural environment, starting from the Yongle era, salt fields in Hainan successively adopted the sun-drying method for large-scale production. Yantian Village by the Xinying Bay in the south of the Yangpu Economic Development Zone in Hainan is the earliest existing sun-drying salt production point in our country, and also an ancient salt field that still preserves the primitive sun-drying salt production method intact. This salt field can still produce normally.

According to historical data mastered by the transmigrators: The salt field in Lingao during the Ming Dynasty was located on the Maniao Peninsula, 25 kilometers north of the county town, under the jurisdiction of a Salt Field Ambassador, subordinate to the Haibei Salt Distribution Commission. It could produce "one thousand four hundred and seventeen yin and two hundred and thirty jin" of salt annually. Calculated at three hundred jin per yin, this salt field produced more than 200 tons of salt per year, which was enough to meet the initial production and living needs of the transmigrators.

With such a rich resource, the Transmigration regime naturally wanted to take over it quickly. Wang Luobin's task was to inspect the salt drying technology of this time and space on the spot, and consider how to improve and increase production using modern technology—for modern chemical industry, 200 tons of salt was really too little.

The equipment of the salt affairs work team was better than that of the Li area work team. Because the mission involved transporting some salt back, the entire team was fully mechanized, dispatching five agricultural vehicles. The vehicles bumped along the dirt road for almost two hours. Pedestrians were rarely seen along the way. After entering the Maniao Peninsula area, there were even fewer signs of human habitation. Only broken walls and abandoned fields were seen on the road, as if a great war had happened here. The scattered salt on the road confirmed that they hadn't gone the wrong way.

Wang Luobin was puzzled: according to the action intelligence he received: based on historical records, this salt field had more than a thousand salt workers. Including their families, there should be at least five or six thousand people around the salt field, and there should be many salt villages. But along the way, there were ruins after ruins.

At noon, they found a semi-abandoned stone slab road. Following the stone slab road, they finally found a village with cooking smoke. The houses here were all piled up with volcanic rocks. The alleys were deep and secluded, but many houses had their doors tightly closed. Some had tall weeds in front of the doors, looking like no one had lived there for many years. There were also many collapsed houses scattered in the village, with grass growing on top.

There were only some old people, children, and women in the village, scantily clad and looking extremely impoverished. Seeing this group of strange people coming, they didn't hide, their expressions numb and indifferent. Xiong Buyou asked in the village for a long time before finding the village head's house.

The village head was surnamed Tan, a hereditary salt worker here, coming from a famous salt drying family in Hainan. Facing Xiong Buyou's request to buy salt, he ordered someone to open the salt granary: there were five or six hundred jin of salt inside. Such a small amount of salt surprised Wang Luobin. Upon asking, he learned: In the forty-fifth year of Wanli, an earthquake in Lingao destroyed many tidal flats of the salt field, and some places sank into the sea. The production capacity of Maniao Salt Field had never recovered to its initial level, but the commuted silver stipulated by the government had not decreased at all. Many salt workers fled. What made matters worse was that since the end of the Wanli era, pirates often came to the salt field to rob salt quotas. Salt workers were killed or fled. Now only more than two hundred salt workers remained in the village. The ancient method of salt drying was completely a labor-intensive industry. With fewer people, production was even harder to maintain. The annual commutation was always insufficient, and the government urged tax collection urgently, so the able-bodied men in the village usually hid. Fortunately, there was still much land in Maniao, and with irrigation from the Maniao River, the salt workers reclaimed some land to grow grain besides drying salt, which could still fill their bellies. It was just living in fear.

This situation gave Wang Luobin a big blow. Obviously, the production status of this salt field was extremely unideal. It seemed that the Executive Committee's original plan to control the salt field and buy the entire output had to be changed—the transmigrators not only had to control the salt field but also organize the resumption of production and expand output. For a moment, Wang Luobin felt like the land reform work team captain in the movies he watched as a child; everywhere was waiting to be rebuilt.

But organizing the resumption of production was not an easy task. Wang Luobin decided to go to the salt field to take a look first. After giving the numb-looking Tan Village Head a Mexican silver dollar, the village head, who looked uninterested in everything, finally agreed to take him to see the salt field.
