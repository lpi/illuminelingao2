# Chapter 1981 - Veggie Pancake, Two Skins

She indeed didn't quite understand what the Senate was all about. When she first arrived in Lingao, she often heard people mention "Chairman Wen." She thought that was probably the "Emperor" of the Australians. But later she heard that Australians were descendants of the Great Song—she knew about descendants of the Great Song; they must be surnamed Zhao. So Chairman Wen definitely wasn't the Emperor.

Later, during late-night talks in the training class dormitory, she heard partners say that this Chairman position was taken in turns; any Senator could sit there, regardless of gender.

In this light, if Chief Zhang let a child take her surname Zhang, Chief Wang naturally wouldn't dare to oppose it to the death. Nan Wan'er suddenly felt she had another layer of understanding of the Senate.

However, Zhang Xiaoqi didn't have such deep political understanding. In the old timeline, she and her husband had agreed that the second child would be surnamed Zhang. Unexpectedly, after transmigrating, she conceived twins. Amidst the joy, the couple decided that both children would be surnamed Zhang as agreed before. But when registering the children's "household registration" at that "College of Arms," Director Xiao tactfully and implicitly offered some suggestions. Because Wang Muqing was a "minor Senator" born in the old timeline and brought her own seat, the two of them still had two seats to pass on. Considering the social reality of the new timeline, it would be more appropriate for the two children to inherit one seat each, one surnamed Zhang and one surnamed Wang. Naming children involving political issues was unexpected for the Wang Qiyi couple. After discussing with a few close friends and Cheng Dong, the high-level leader closest to the core, they decided to follow Director Xiao's arrangement: the two children would take the surnames of the two people respectively.

"What's there to fake about this. I told Chief Ma and Chief Ji before, and they also said the Marriage Law clearly writes that children can take the father's surname or the mother's surname. It's not some matter of unalterable principle." Zhang Xiaoqi put down the child in her arms. "Niannian, you get down and walk too; you've tired your Auntie out. If you ask me, Wan'er, that Miss Dong mentioned by Chief Zheng lives very clearly, having her own ideas and goals. You served your master and fellow disciples before, and will serve a man, in-laws, and children after marrying in the second half of life. What's the meaning of this life? Right? ...We didn't go the wrong way, did we?"

"No, Sister, turning left ahead is the Dong Family Shop." Nan Wan'er didn't dare to answer such words. In her view, it didn't matter what "crazy talk" Senator Zhang said—she was a Senator, but she herself shouldn't blindly chime in. If things got serious, people like her would be the first to suffer.

When Zhang Xiaoqi and her group of four leisurely strolled to the Dong Family Shop, a queue had already formed in front of the pancake stall outside. The crowded flow of people, the small stall steaming with heat, the fragrant smell of burnt flour assailing the nose, the somewhat dilapidated eaves, and the noise around—all made her feel as if she had returned to the breakfast spot downstairs in the old timeline. Acting on impulse, she pulled Nan Wan'er to queue at the end of the line.

"Sister, there's room inside. I heard we can go sit and order directly; it's the same. Those queuing buy and leave." Nan Wan'er had done her homework with colleagues who arrived in Guangzhou earlier before coming.

"It's fine, it's fine. What I want is this feeling. I used to queue much longer than this for a few skewers. How about you take Niannian and the others to find a place first, and I'll queue."

"They definitely won't go; let me be with you." Nan Wan'er sometimes really couldn't understand the style of these Chiefs. Say they are formidable, they are truly formidable. Legend has it when they first arrived in Lingao, the county organized troops to attack; these Chiefs, men and women, old and young, all killed many people, yet managed a poor and remote small county in perfect order... truly capable of stabilizing the country with pen and sword. But usually, they look like they haven't been masters, liking to do things themselves not to mention, but also mixing with common people from time to time.

This sister of hers managed all the money in Hainan and Guangdong, yet let alone going out with a retinue of maids and servants, she hadn't even sat in a sedan chair a few times. Just regarding eating, Nan Wan'er remembered when serving masters on the mountain, there were always a few exquisite small dishes on ordinary days. If there was money at home or one was a "favorite," it was even more particular. Unlike Zhang Xiaoqi, who since Lingao liked to drill into various dilapidated small shops or even find food at roadside stalls. A few times, sitting around were all bare-chested men, making her dare not even lift her head. But for Zhang Xiaoqi, this was the favorite way of "foraging," just like in the old timeline. Of course, after quarreling with her husband several times and being intimidated by Minister Shi and others with various illustrated explanations, she reluctantly narrowed the foraging range a lot. After all, the concept of food hygiene couldn't be established in the masses' minds in three or five years; losing one's life for a bite was still very easy.

Zhang Xiaoqi sized up this unremarkable shop. This Dong mother and daughter were really capable! However, in Zhang Xiaoqi's view, the Dong Family Shop became popular mainly because it gathered the great achievements of various gossip from the old timeline. First, Miss Dong was alone, an unmarried maiden managing the shop herself; this was the first of its kind. Excluding the Australians' places, how many were there in the entire Great Ming? Note that back then Zhuo Wenjun selling wine still had Sima Xiangru accompanying her. Second, Miss Dong's cheap father was a Prefect. No matter what, opening a shop to do business with the title of a Prefect's daughter, probably anyone would want to come and see. Also, this Dong mother and daughter not only survived completely after the bandits broke the city and entered their home but also asked for their soft properties back! What were bandits? This wasn't picking food from a cat's mouth; this was snatching food from a tiger's mouth! This mother and daughter probably had quite some entanglements with Chief Wen Dao who kept his word in Guangzhou city. Finally, heard this Miss Dong wasn't restless, making eyes at that patrolman Li Ziyu. And Li Ziyu's father was an officer of the Usurper Ming army. How would Chief Wen Dao react knowing his forbidden meat was coveted by others?

These gossip-combined rumors, if before the Senate entered the city, would be enough to make the Dong mother and daughter commit suicide. But now Guangzhou had changed sky; female bandits wearing skirts showing legs ran everywhere. This bit of gossip had no great lethality.

However, Zhang Xiaoqi came to the Dong Family Shop today without a bit of gossip heart. As a foodie from Shandong, during these days in Lingao, she simply missed the heavy oil and salt taste of the past too much. Now having finally found a shop with Shandong flavor in Guangzhou, hearing those Shandong naturalized citizens and other Senators evaluate the taste as passable, how could she not go? Besides, Zheng Shangjie had mentioned long ago how unique this new timeline "Miss Dong" was, having some fame even in the Senator circle. Especially knowing she was actually named Dong Mingdang, the bad taste of certain male Senators obviously soared.

The action of Zhang Xiaoqi and Nan Wan'er queuing at the end caused a slight commotion in the line. The two followed regulations not wearing Finance and Tax Bureau uniforms but wore the most ordinary naturalized citizen cadre outfits. But the two obviously taller and fuller figures than others still attracted many gazes, especially the two porcelain-doll-like twin little girls obediently queuing behind their mother were even more conspicuous. Fortunately, Australian Song had established administration in Guangzhou for nearly a year. Guangzhou citizens, especially the naturalized citizens queuing here, already had basic rule common sense; at most they turned heads to look a few times without causing any trouble.

Dong Xiang took the brush handed by Lan'er and nimbly brushed the entire griddle surface. This was specifically instructed by Miss Dong, saying Australian Song stipulated that anything entering the mouth must be clean; there were special hygiene police checking on the streets. Due to the plague, Guangzhou actually advanced further than Lingao in public health management. When the water on the griddle dried slightly, Dong Xiang scooped with a ladle in his left hand into the multi-grain batter, poured the batter evenly on the griddle counter-clockwise, while holding a thin bamboo spreader in his right hand to spread the batter evenly. As soon as the pancake formed, he brushed on sauce, spread the shredded vegetables mixed and cut properly by Lan'er in the vegetable basin on top, and pressed lightly with the spreader to heat.

"Is this a Veggie Pancake? You guys know how to make this too?" Dong Xiang was just about to lift the pancake to fold when the person standing opposite asked suddenly. He looked up at this woman. She seemed about as tall as him; eyes were big but recessed like Red-haired people. No matter how he looked, she didn't look like a local woman. Could she be a Chief?

"Customer, you truly have good insight. This is the Veggie Pancake from my Miss's hometown." Compared to the honest and dull Dong Xiang, Lan'er, who served people since childhood, was much smarter. Although she hadn't determined the background of this woman with children, she could still tell from her demeanor and conversation that she wasn't an ordinary person.

"Oh, I thought you only made Pancake Rolls." Zhang Xiaoqi's eyes shone. Her eldest daughter hadn't mentioned there were Veggie Pancakes here when leaving. It seemed this Miss Dong had a very open mind.

"We also just started this month. Miss said this has many vegetables; small stomachs can treat it as a meal. Madam, how many skins do you want? Want to add eggs?"

"Two skins, one egg." Zhang Xiaoqi knew the ropes. Looking at the large porcelain plate filled with various shredded vegetables, she regrettably found the vegetable varieties in this timeline were still few. Especially the most important vegetable for her in Veggie Pancakes: potato, was missing.

Potatoes were currently only planted on Jeju Island. Out of Jeju Island, reaching Hainan was "Senate Special Supply." As for another vegetable Zhang Xiaoqi must put: carrot, it was also missing here.

Meats were more than the pancake stalls in the old timeline. Of course, things like ham sausage didn't exist, but essential pig head meat was plentiful, along with various braised offal. Could see they used a lot of brains.

She ordered three or four kinds of vegetables, didn't want meat, and instructed "Add more chili sauce!", making people around look sideways—chili itself hadn't been introduced to Great Ming for long, and places planting and eating it weren't many. As for Guangzhou's chili sauce, it was introduced by Australians single-handedly. Ordinary people were not yet used to it, let alone "add more."
