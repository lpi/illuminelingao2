# Chapter 123: Women's Cooperative

News of transmigrators conquering Gou Manor spread countywide within three days. Reactions from various quarters were extremely mixed. Gentry and major households were privately pleased that the universally-despised, tyrannical Gou Xunyi was finished—yet worried about short-hairs' growing power. But commoners within dozens of *li* had received relief—everyone grateful and delighted. Distant commoners heard enviously—rumors spreading everywhere. Commoners, having benefited, constantly came to secretly reveal other strongholds' details—some even volunteered as insiders, inviting attacks. Even small bandit-groups came proposing "shared prosperity." Travelers received everyone warmly, recorded information—as for attacks, they needed rest; not currently offering this service.

Within a hundred *li*, no major household failed to send congratulatory gifts—even Huang Family Village sent pigs, sheep, and cloth. Travelers let bygones be bygones—accepted everything. They generously rewarded envoys, having them spread word: Bairren Fortress had opened a new market; everyone was welcome to trade—guaranteed safety, no fees. Dongmen Chuiyu tirelessly toured envoy after envoy around East Gate Market—showing streets under construction, red-brick buildings rising...

Pirates opening markets for trade—truly novel! Lingao had few markets—entire county totaled fourteen. Even the county seat had only a simple County-Gate Market. Now Bairren Rapids had produced East Gate Market! Major households heard returnees' reports—the market-scene wasn't inferior to other places. Short-hairs themselves purchased heavily daily; recently, openly buying grain at high prices! Many large-stock grain-holders were tempted—joining grain-sales queues. Daily grain-arrivals made Cheng Dong stamp his feet in anguish—silver was flowing out in torrents!

After intense preparations, transmigrators' first business—a salt shop—opened amid crackling firecrackers. Since the merchant-hall wasn't built yet, this salt shop was just a simple bamboo-shack. Behind the counter: piled sacks of Ma'ao salt; sold in 50-gram units, wholesale and retail—prices one-third below market.

Initially, sales were negligible. But as traders spread word that East Gate Market had cheap salt, people from everywhere rushed to buy. Sales soared—especially small salt-peddlers, who flocked enthusiastically, buying by the basket. Previously, salt fields were monopolized by Landlord Gou—salt was hard to get. County official-salt was worse—bright salt turned muddy-yellow and sandy through official hands; prices were outrageous. Eventually, even the county yamen's cook came to buy—he didn't request invoices, though reimbursement was surely at official-salt prices.

Encouraged by the salt shop's success, transmigrators' second store opened. This one was unique—not "state-owned" but a joint-stock company. Ownership wasn't collective but shareholder-based.

This stock company was engineered by Li Mei from the Ming family of four. After settling in Bairren Fortress, this veteran of commercial battles grew restless. Daughter-in-law now worked in public security; her old husband donned his badgeless Type-87 navy uniform daily, serving as Military Group's naval advisor; son, though initially without official position, at least worked outside daily. She ended up helping Auntie Cao Shunhua at the cafeteria—unacceptable! A longtime businesswoman, she'd been planning to start some company—at minimum, open a shop.

Opening shops was child's play for the old-timespace Li Mei—she had capital and channels. But here, the family had nothing beyond luggage. Travelers themselves had no products to sell. Clever wives can't cook without rice. So she waited for opportunities. Li Mei firmly believed: opportunities for fortune existed in any timespace—you just had to seize them.

When transmigrators opened Li-minority trade relations and struck it rich at Gou Manor—when East Gate Market took shape—Li Mei knew: opportunity had arrived.

Planning Committee had brought countless spoils from Gou Manor—from porcelain and furniture to clothing. These items needed disposition—conversion to usable cash and grain. Here was her merchandise-source.

Next problem: how to turn source into store-inventory? She had no money. This didn't trouble her. After some whispering among women she'd met in the cafeteria, Li Mei returned to her simple-housing, dressed in her old business suit from deal-making days, switched to half-heeled pumps. Washed her face, carefully combed her hair—instantly transforming from cafeteria-auntie into businesswoman.

She headed straight to Committee headquarters—cornered Wen Desi—explained her shop idea.

"Open a shop?" Wen Desi was confused. "We're not mass-producing industrial goods yet. There's nothing to sell."

"There are goods—Gou Manor's seized items. Those clothes, daily-goods, ordinary furniture—mostly used. Can't be bulk-sold. I propose purchasing on the company's behalf—then retailing."

Wen Desi suddenly thought this woman somewhat unrealistic. Just selling secondhand goods? Her company purchasing—with what money? He knew Old Ming's wife had managed a trading company—probably substantial assets—but RMB wealth (whether brought or not) was worthless here.

"What do you purchase with? And company? I don't recall establishing any company."

"Company's right here." Li Mei produced a paper covered with writing. "This is the company-formation agreement. Technically, we should register with industry-commerce first—but Dongmen Chuiyu didn't know if he had authority for that. So I'm showing you."

Wen Desi looked: it declared these individuals voluntarily invested to establish "Hainan Women's Cooperative Corporation"—trade scope included: daily sundries, food-service, hardware, etc. Below: share-allocation ratios and signatures from a dozen-plus women—apparently almost all female transmigrators, including the usually-unassuming Auntie Cao.

"But what's your capital? Everyone's on the supply-system now—no money."

"Director Wen, I recall all registered transmigrators receive salaries—"

Wen Desi smiled bitterly—he'd forgotten this entirely. With nowhere to spend salaries, few remembered this income. But this accidentally-involved outsider remembered clearly.

"These shareholders invested using their accumulated voucher-income. Surely the Committee won't deny these RMB-equivalent vouchers have purchasing power—"

"Well—" Wen Desi naturally couldn't deny this; otherwise, everyone would immediately revolt. He struggled: "But we've only paid three months' wages. This amount as capital can't possibly purchase all this."

"We'll purchase a portion first—then use sales-proceeds for turnover." Seeing Director Wen's expression turning sour, Li Mei quickly added: "First batch uses vouchers for purchase. Future restocking from Committee would settle in vouchers, work-points, and gold/silver/copper together."

"Good—that works." Wen Desi finally relaxed. "But since you're selling to locals, you won't receive new vouchers."

"Actually, many items can be sold to comrades too. I know, I know—" she stopped Wen Desi before he spoke, "—our organization is currently supply-based. But non-necessities can absolutely be bought with vouchers—otherwise, what's the point of vouchers? Just days ago, I heard someone wanted to buy a console-table for their room. Surely the Committee won't issue that? Also, if more working capital is needed, I plan to issue company bonds—with Committee approval, of course."

"Bonds—we'll discuss later." Wen Desi thought: you're really planning a commercial Great-Leap. "Stock companies are a good idea. I personally agree. But the Committee must discuss before officially responding."

"One more thought." Li Mei added negotiating leverage. "This company could be public-private joint-venture. Committee could invest on behalf of all transmigrators—holding partial shares, say 20%."

"Hmm, that's not bad." Wen Desi began listening seriously.

"This portion's proceeds could fund everyone's dividends, welfare expenses—even future Committee administrative costs—" she spoke leisurely, watching Wen's expression, "—think about it: the supply-system is abnormal. Once established, salary-systems will come. Then everyone will care about income. Having extra cash to distribute—everyone would be pleased."

"But Committee can't issue more vouchers." Wen Desi frowned. "Vouchers are virtual currency—just adding numbers to everyone's accounts monthly. Value is hard to estimate. That's one issue. Another: Committee has no vouchers to invest."

"Value-calculation—we'll work it out. We have economists here; they should find solutions. As for Committee having no vouchers—that's no problem at all." Li Mei smiled cunningly, revealing her true purpose. "Invest with goods."

Wen Desi was startled: you're pulling an empty-handed wolf-catch! So Li Mei had nothing—completely air-versus-air. But he couldn't find grounds to refuse—she'd cornered Committee on voucher-value recognition.

The company-proposal quickly passed. Besides the public-private concept, Finance and Commerce supported it. Cheng Dong thought this could recover vouchers—everyone's long-accumulated massive voucher-balances suddenly entering circulation would cause severe inflation.

Du Wen was especially supportive—turns out this joint-venture company, besides 20% collective-transmigrator ownership, gave her constantly-advocated Women's Federation 5% shares (though it hadn't yet formed). The biggest beneficiary was Li Mei herself: despite having zero vouchers, as manager she received 12% shares—voted by the shareholders' general meeting.
