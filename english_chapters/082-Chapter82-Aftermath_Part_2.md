# Chapter 82: Aftermath (Part 2)

"They won't kill us, surely."

"Ah, my mother must be worried sick." Ma Peng started wiping tears.

Fu Bu'er felt uncomfortable. *You have an old mother—I have an entire household up and down!* His wife was one thing, but he didn't want to lose his concubines, especially his third concubine, brought from Guangzhou. Though a bit older, she was from a *courtesan house* background—knew how to dress elegantly, could sing ditties—far superior to local country girls. She'd captivated Master Fu.

Then he thought about his young sons and his unmarried daughter who couldn't hold up the household. If he couldn't get back, wouldn't his accumulated property be swallowed by his clansmen and uncles and brothers? Their covetous eyes had been on him for more than a day or two. The more he thought, the more he regretted. Seeing the guards weren't watching closely—only two young pirates—he fumbled on himself and found some loose silver, about two *liang* total. Fearing it wasn't enough, he also removed his gilded silver net-scarf ring—worth another two or three *qian*. He examined it a while, thinking over two *liang* of silver for one person's escape ought to be sufficient—these small fry probably didn't have big appetites.

Fu Bu'er mustered courage, trembling, sidling close to the young pirate with the bird-gun. He offered the silver. He knew some Cantonese, but the youth obviously didn't understand. He could only point to himself, then to outside, miming running.

But the youth showed no interest, gesturing with his bayoneted rifle. Terrified, Fu Bu'er fell silent, but didn't dare withdraw his silver-holding hand—*might as well give it up; after they search us it won't be mine anyway; might as well trade for some consideration.* But the youth didn't take the money—only indicated he should keep it, then pointed at his injured leg, then at the big tent. Fu Bu'er understood: wait here for treatment.

The medical team worked until evening before finishing all the wounded. Fu Bu'er's leg got over ten stitches. To the doctor, this man was lucky: the bullet had passed through muscle, not lodging in his body, not breaking bone or blood vessel. But to Fu Bu'er, it was a completely novel experience—first time learning that flesh could be sewn up like a tailor stitching clothes, though he screamed his lungs out during suturing.

Two-thirds of the thirty-odd severely wounded died while waiting. After examining the rest, doctors felt chances weren't good: no blood plasma, not enough qualified nurses—these people would likely not survive surgery.

"Let Military Group give them quick ends." Hippo knew that with resources extremely precious, they couldn't expend limited medical supplies on these people.

Shi Niaoren pondered a moment, then said: "Forget it—let's try desperate measures. They've lasted from noon 'til now—strong life force. We'll try."

"But there's no blood plasma—we'd need donors, blood typing..."

"Just use saline." Shi Niaoren decided. "No anesthetics either. Whether they survive depends on their luck."

"But... but..." The medical team was stunned. No anesthetics, no blood plasma—operating on these severely injured, blood-loss cases, some already unconscious—wasn't that basically killing them?

"Didn't I say desperate measures? Whether they live is fate." Shi Niaoren had an unspoken thought: *Rather than watching them die, better they die on the operating table—at least that soothes my conscience.* Another completely unspeakable thought: *good surgical practice for everyone.*

"Let's go." At his call, the exhausted medical team got busy again. But medical personnel were insufficient, especially nurses. Doctors had to assist doctors. Finally, even veterinarian Dr. Yang was summoned—he'd just finished examining the three captured horses' injuries and treating their diseases.

"Old Yang, can you operate on humans?"

"I can operate on horses..." Yang Baogui joked. "Wound cleaning, disinfection, suturing—give those to me, it's all similar. Oh, amputations I can also do."

"Let's go."

The evening post-battle review meeting, based on problems exposed during combat, identified five main issues:

**One: Insufficient military training, poor fighting spirit.** Most people weren't familiar with firearms; too much wasted shooting. At the slightest danger, they couldn't hold; even with defensive fortifications, routs occurred. In the open, who knows what would happen.

**Two: Extremely poor organization.** Besides Military Group members who could follow group leaders' orders to fight, the Military Group was essentially unable to command hastily-organized civilians. "Rabble," He Ming said at the review.

**Three: Protection.** Steel helmets plus stab-proof vests proved effective. But the battle exposed coverage gaps—limbs and face lacked protection. Further protective products needed development.

**Four: Strategy too passive.** They'd confined themselves to Bairren Rapids, not using their superiority in firepower, communications, and mobility to take initiative—resulting in passive defense.

**Five: Bairren Fortress defenses obviously insufficient—needed strengthening.**

But the meeting's focus was the next strategic direction.

The **Steady Faction** insisted on keeping the two-point-one-line as the main activity center, strengthening base defense. After creating facts on the ground, they'd focus on industrial and technological development, forming a complete urban and agricultural-industrial system. Using material abundance, superior living conditions, and advanced technology to create a "beacon effect"—attracting locals into trade and construction, ultimately achieving "peaceful evolution."

The **Aggressive Faction** mocked the Steady Faction as true "turtle tactics." With strength surpassing opponents by three centuries, yet fearing the enemy like tigers, cowering behind trenches and barbed wire, not daring to seize initiative. They reminded others: without proactive attacks to destroy the local Ming ruling center, Lingao's resources could never be used. And this ruling center would organize hostile activities again and again.

"Lingao County today can launch this two-pronged attack; tomorrow they might send raiders—they've done it before. We'll certainly venture farther from base in the future, collecting various materials. Every time with Military Group escorts?"

The Aggressive Faction listed advantages of occupying the county seat: first, capturing large amounts of manpower as labor; second, through seized tax registers, levying taxes and grain; also obtaining substantial treasury supplies...

These benefits swayed many. Though the Steady Faction cited historical records and reality as weapons—telling them there weren't many residents to capture for labor, that Ming-era Lingao County annals showed the prefecture had always been poor, and the treasury wouldn't have much.

At this point, Aggressive Faction representative Ma Qianzhu unexpectedly proposed tabling this issue, focusing on training and organization problems exposed in battle.

Training was indeed a blank: after landing, ten-plus days of daily labor—no time. Live-fire practice only once; five rounds per person had made the Planning Committee wince—500 people meant 2,500 rounds. The transmigrators' biggest loss in this battle was ammunition: in under an hour of fighting, nearly 3,000 rounds consumed—a significant number. Total stockpile: only one million rounds... If training and small battles used so much, how would they fight future battles? When could they produce metallic cartridges?

Organization problems obviously related directly to insufficient military training. Xiao Zishan proposed: professional groups had performed well in battle—obviously because they worked together daily and knew each other. Problems mainly came from daily ad-hoc "basic labor groups." These groups were originally fixed; in practice, they were redistributed daily by personnel—resulting in unfamiliarity and lack of trust among members. Fine for regular work; in emergencies, couldn't unite.

After discussion, the Committee reaffirmed the group system: all transmigrators except family units—singles to freely combine—forming fixed four-person groups, each electing a group leader, participating in labor together, housed together in the same dormitory. Through eating, living, and working together, they'd build friendship—like university dormmates who formed tight bonds.

Each group would be issued one SKS rifle as group equipment. This way, everyone could practice; it avoided issuing weapons only during wartime when unfamiliarity was dangerous, yet prevented one rifle per person which would mean uncontrolled firearms.

Using these groups as basic units, weekly time would be allocated for military training, improving coordination. Next, Beiwei introduced a new training plan: **"Hunting."**

"Each time, Military Group sends 5 people, plus 2–3 regular groups." He explained the plan in detail. "Breaking our current pattern of only operating along the Wenlan River, we push reconnaissance into various directions' depths, correcting maps, surveying resources—"

Groups would capture individuals or small groups of transmigrators, and when necessary, attack local armed personnel. Through combat, they'd temper the team—fighting while marching was closer to real combat than marching drills and target practice at base. They'd spread transmigrator authority to every county corner, letting commoners know of their arrival, spreading necessary terror.

This plan obviously reeked of blood. But the Moderate faction decided not to oppose it—after all, 21 wounded was reality. If they vetoed this, the Aggressive faction would inevitably reintroduce the proposal to attack the county seat. Given current emotions, moderates didn't think they'd win the vote. Finally, the Steady faction agreed to the "Hunting" plan as a compromise for the Aggressive faction dropping the county-seat attack proposal.
