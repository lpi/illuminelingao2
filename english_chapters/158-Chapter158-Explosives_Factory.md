# Chapter 158: Explosives Factory

While Li Di struggled with guncotton, Chemistry Group designed and built a large compound at a remote location near Wenlan River—far from buildings and habitations.

Within 200m radius around the compound, ground was cleared of all vegetation. Surface was repeatedly compacted yellow clay with lime and fine sand—even pebbles removed. Roads were brick-paved. Two barbed-wire fences surrounded everything—hung with wooden boards depicting fierce black skulls and large fire warning symbols.

This was Chemistry Group's explosives factory. Construction Group painstakingly achieved fire and impact prevention: entirely cement and brick structure. Roofs without wooden beams—all brick-arch construction. Entire building: no iron, no wood, no stone—preventing any sparks or combustion.

Per explosives enthusiasts' suggestions, production workshop floors weren't bricked—covered with river sand to absorb any spilled acids and bases or chemicals.

Building structure was peculiar. Central production workshop had north-south windows for ventilation, east-west doors. Immediately outside doors: man-deep trenches lined with fine sand. These were escape trenches—if uncontrollable chemical reactions occurred, escape via these. Premise: reactions fast enough, legs agile enough.

These escape trenches brought solemn atmosphere to Chemistry Group. Just as Mechanical Group dreamed of making guns and cannons, chemistry people rarely weren't fascinated by explosives. Many had secretly made various explosives in laboratories. But in these crude conditions—how much confidence? The heroic explosives zealots of Chemistry Group fell silent.

The group sat inside skull-decorated barbed wire, discussing explosives direction.

"Know what we're doing?" Ji Situi surveyed the group.

"Making explosives—we've waited months for this."

"Everyone prepare mentally for death or dismemberment!" Ji Situi said fiercely. "This isn't playing with black powder and flour anymore."

"You crow-mouth!" Ji Situi was pelted with mud clods—retreated to one side.

Besides Chemistry Group, Mechanical Group attended—plus Li Di, devastated by nitrocellulose failure, joining the explosives meeting. He remained frustrated.

"I just don't understand—why can't nitrocellulose work!"

"Chemistry is precise work. Not that simple." Ji Situi said. "Your process has problems—plus missing basic equipment."

"If we gather equipment—nitrocellulose is easy." Ye Yuming said. A minor bureaucrat who'd studied chemistry—knowledgeable about mining and blasting.

"If we could build large centrifuges..." Ji Situi thought: everyone knew this. Problem: besides lab's small centrifuge, where to find one.

Without centrifuges, nitrocellulose couldn't thoroughly remove free acid from cotton fibers. In actual use, nitrocellulose became extremely unstable. 19th-century Austrian military suffered badly.

"Still needs Industrial Department's help." Xu Yingjie said—extremely fascinated by chemicals, especially loved concocting chemical reagents. A hands-on experimental maniac.

"Difficult." Wang Luobin shook his head. "Our prime movers aren't adequate."

"How about nitroglycerin?" Li Yunxing suggested—recently transferred from Military Group to Artillery Group.

They had nitric acid; glycerin production wasn't difficult. Plus *Fengcheng*'s refrigerator could continuously supply cooling ice. Manufacturing should be feasible.

"I have a recipe." Ye Yuming was enthusiastic. "I've made it in laboratories—"

Everyone gasped—truly there were heaven-defying people. Nitroglycerin's manufacturing simplicity made it popular with 19th–20th-century terrorists and revolutionaries—but more died during manufacturing than from police.

Ye Yuming's formula was:

(1) Add distilled water to beaker;
(2) Prepare large quantity ice-salt mixture in water bath;
(3) Place beaker in bath, add concentrated nitric acid, cool below target temperature;
(4) Slowly add concentrated sulfuric acid, mix uniformly, cool to target temperature;
(5) Using dropper, slowly add glycerin—one drop per several seconds—monitoring temperature, keeping below target. Stop when visible glycerin layer forms on mixed-acid surface;
(6) Slowly stir for specified minutes, maintaining low temperature;
(7) Pour mixture into first beaker—nitroglycerin precipitates to bottom;
(8) Test nitroglycerin with litmus paper until non-acidic.

With sodium carbonate, stability could be enhanced.

"I'll make a small amount." Ye Yuming was confident. "Done it once or twice—relatively experienced. These materials aren't rare; equipment exists. If viable—scale up."

"This method will blow you sky-high." Xu Yingjie shook his head. "Laboratory glycerin is analytical grade. Our current glycerin is saponification-only—contains saturated fatty acid salts. They'll react with mixed acid first, releasing heat. Ice-salt mixture might not cool fast enough. Result: BOOM!"

"I didn't consider that."

Xu Yingjie said: "My priority ranking for explosives development: 1. Nitrocellulose—rifle and cannon effectiveness multiplier. Other explosives can't match it. 2. Synthetic ammonia—once our plant's completed, it's solved. 3. Picric acid—impact-resistant, can be fired via nitrocellulose, powerful explosive. Nitroglycerin is useless—only for bombs, grenades. Power doesn't obviously exceed picric acid; stability's too poor."

"Synthetic ammonia's no problem—factory completion solves it. Picric acid's too difficult." Ji Situi flatly rejected. "Phenol extraction processes—maybe in 10 years. Just the 13-atmosphere requirement makes it impossible."

"Coal tar can extract phenol—doesn't require benzene. Phenol is naturally coal coking by-product."

"This process's efficiency is poor. For picric acid—once coal coking factory operates, phenol's available. Low yield acceptable. Problem: Military Group can't wait." Ji Situi spread hands helplessly.

"Then only black powder." Xu Yingjie said. "If someone's fearless—try nitroglycerin."

Finally: whether nitroglycerin or picric acid—needed chemical factories operational. Currently certain production: still black powder. They were confident producing fine-grain black powder far exceeding this era's quality—including propellant and explosive grades. Even saltpeter supply wasn't too problematic. Without Guangzhou saltpeter, *dui-xiao* heap method could yield some. Per archives: 1959, one county built black powder factory for quarrying—without external saltpeter, just local saltpeter collection and *dui-xiao*, achieved 50 tons annual production. Controlling Lingao county, 20–30 tons black powder annually was achievable.

Lin Shenhe said: "Most urgent: safety and stability. Black powder substitution is fine. But we need percussion caps—without them, Industrial Department can only make flintlocks."

Percussion caps required mercury fulminate. Fulminate was primary explosive. Black powder shells and grenades could manage. But transmigrators' Minié rifles absolutely needed caps.

Fulminate process wasn't complex: dissolve mercury in nitric acid, mix with alcohol—final product.

Mercury wasn't easily obtained. Guangzhou Forward Station bought mercury and cinnabar—totaling only ~10kg after emptying all Guangzhou pharmacies. Chemistry Group considered silver fulminate—silver was more plentiful and non-toxic. But silver fulminate was more sensitive than mercury fulminate. Mercury fulminate was safer.

Fulminate needed high-purity alcohol. Alcohol production had no technical difficulty—but root crops weren't harvested yet. Making alcohol from rice was wasteful. Commerce Department arranged Lin Quan'an to buy strongest Qiongshan baijiu. Chemistry Group designed and built wood-tin distillation apparatus for double distillation. First pass: baijiu to crude alcohol. Second pass: 96% alcohol. Remaining ~3% residue was fusel oil—potential penicillin feedstock. Though penicillin was premature.

Xu Yingjie led trial production. This lover of nasty chemicals reviewed his chemistry manual countless times, memorized archives' process flow completely.

Pyrotechnics manufacturing was the most dangerous part of military chemistry. Even in modern factories, danger accompanied production—let alone these crude-equipment indigenous manufactures.

Fulminate itself was sensitive and dangerous—but in wet environments, reactions were relatively safe. Still, first-time pyrotechnics handlers were frightened. For safety, everyone evacuated the reaction laboratory. Only Xu Yingjie remained. Military Group offered bomb-disposal suit—but wearing it made work impossible. Had to decline.

First: place purified mercury in ceramic jar. Add nitric acid. Water-bath heat to specified temperature. Occasionally shake during heating. Mercury slowly dissolved. After ~40 minutes—green mercuric nitrate solution.

After mercuric nitrate production, preheat 96% alcohol. Then add mercuric nitrate to alcohol. Temperature control was critical. Xu Yingjie constantly watched thermometer.

Once alcohol was added—reaction began. Mercuric nitrate solution started boiling. After complete addition, slight shake. Temperature rise reached target—reaction successful. When temperature stabilized, white smoke billowed from reaction vessel. Xu Yingjie knew: production basically succeeded. No red smoke meant he could exit and wait.

He checked glass condenser—confirming normal operation. This device collected reaction gases. Reaction gases were toxic, flammable—plus condensation in reactor would affect fulminate yield and quality.

Chemistry Group watched distantly from compound gate. Seeing him emerge—everyone applauded. Xu Yingjie cooperatively posed.

Ninety minutes later, returning inside—reaction had completely stopped. Reactor bottom held layer of grayish granular material—like gray sand.

Xu Yingjie carefully collected wet fulminate. Wrapped in cloth. Used manual press to squeeze out water—getting moisture below 5%. Normally, fulminate needed warm-air drying in specialized rooms for 10–15 hours. No such conditions—only natural drying.
