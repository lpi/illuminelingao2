# Chapter 65: Bairren Rapids (Part 1)

"Xue, I have a very bad feeling..." Guo Yi told him everything he'd discovered. "I don't know how to explain any of this. If they staged this, it's Oscar-worthy."

"You're right. If they wanted us dead, doing it this way makes no sense. If they just wanted a show to convince us, the cost is too high."

Rain poured outside. The two sat in silence, watching water droplets run down the waterproof sheets into the rocks at their feet. Neither knew what to say. A sense of abandonment gripped them—as if they were the only people left in the world. Too much inexplicable had happened in twenty-four hours.

"Not staged." Salina, who'd seemed asleep, spoke up. She was awake now, sitting up against the stone.

"You should rest." Xue Ziliang immediately became gentlemanly. "Your organs seem to have taken a shock. Get more rest."

"I'm fine..." Salina's Chinese was somewhat clunky but fluent. "Guo, your suspicions make sense." She caught her breath. "When you examined the bodies—were there any underwear?"

Guo Yi thought: *I'm not a pervert—why would I strip men's pants in broad daylight?*

"Guo, ancient people didn't have underwear..." Salina seemed weak. "Especially the poor."

"That's not reliable, is it?" Guo Yi was deeply skeptical. Thinking back, he hadn't noticed any undergarments when searching—as for underwear specifically, he didn't know.

"If they were modern people in costume, the planners couldn't possibly have thought of the underwear issue." She paused briefly, then told Xue Ziliang: "When the rain stops, let's go back and look at the bodies."

"No," Xue Ziliang said. "If the enemy returns, we don't have strength for another fight. I'll go carry a body back."

"I'll go with you."

"No, you stay here. Salina can't resist right now." Xue Ziliang waved his hand. "I'll be right back." He wrapped himself in waterproof fabric and crawled out.

Suddenly, only Guo Yi and Salina remained in the cave. This was Guo Yi's first time so close to a Western woman—strong perfume mixed with blood, plus some other scent, something like an animal smell... the mingled aromas made him uncomfortable. Up close, white women like Salina weren't conventionally pretty—rough skin with some blemishes—but that full, curvaceous figure, those watery blue eyes, those long dark lashes... still made his heart race. In normal circumstances, he wouldn't dare—as an ordinary, non-leadership security officer, his sensitive work prevented close friendships with foreigners, unless it was an assignment. Now, stranded, his organizational discipline began crumbling... he wanted to chat her up...

"Guo, can you get me a backpack to lean on?" Salina spoke first. "I'm very tired."

"Oh," Xiao Guo started. "Sure." He dragged over a backpack and helped her lean against it, taking the opportunity to touch her shoulder—*so smooth and round*...

"Thank you." Salina closed her eyes briefly. "Guo, you're very dependable..."

Guo Yi actually blushed. "Dependable"—quite a word for these circumstances.

"If Ziliang hadn't saved me today, I'd have been beaten to death." Guo Yi quickly displayed Chinese traditional virtue—modesty.

"If Vinnie hadn't saved you, we couldn't have escaped either." Vinnie was Xue Ziliang's English name. Salina breathed again. "The current situation is very bad, very bad..."

As they talked, Xue Ziliang returned with a corpse, laying it on the stones. The rain had stopped. Salina forced herself up with a stick and came out to examine it together.

It was a young man's body—killed by gunshot. Seeing someone he'd killed laid out in front of him made Guo Yi uncomfortable. Death had distorted the features, but the face was clearly typical southern Han Chinese. Xue Ziliang dug out a pack of latex gloves from his backpack, handing one pair to each person. Salina drew a dagger from her waist as a makeshift dissection tool.

The deceased's hands were covered in calluses, upper arms well-muscled—clearly long-term manual labor. He wore straw sandals; removed, his soles showed thick calluses from habitual barefoot walking. The skin had many parasitic bite marks and scabies infection. Salina pried open the corpse's mouth and had Xue Ziliang shine a flashlight. The teeth were white but severely worn—from long-term consumption of grain with impurities.

Cutting open the clothes revealed no undergarments whatsoever. The fabric was coarse cotton, very roughly woven, dyed a blackish-blue. Xue Ziliang rubbed it for a while and said it was probably plant-dyed—uneven coloring, severe fading. It could not possibly be factory-made.

Examination complete, Xue Ziliang threw the body into the river. Salina removed her gloves, her complexion paler than before.

"I'm starting to believe what they said," she said. "This deceased absolutely doesn't look like someone living in modern society."

"Could they be some primitive tribe?"

"If so, only isolated tribes in Southeast Asian mountains still exist in the Asian region, but location and racial characteristics don't match," Salina said. "These tribes can't weave, let alone dye. Anyone capable of both isn't a primitive tribe."

"Is it really 1628?"

They discussed for a while without reaching any conclusion. That they'd arrived in ancient China—no one could believe. The only option was to keep moving, walk until they found inhabited areas. The truth would then become clear.

The fight made them pessimistic about the road ahead. After losing his Type-64 pistol, Guo Yi couldn't find it—and even if he did, he had no bullets. The ATF agents' weapons had all been confiscated by customs upon entry. Now they had nothing but three military daggers. The ambush was lucky—their attackers only had poles. With iron spears or more swords, today would have been much worse.

Guo Yi sharpened all three wooden poles and built a fire, slowly toasting the tips dry and hard. He'd learned this from *Revolutionary Struggle History of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet Area*—supposedly, soaking them in manure vats for a few days made them even better.

Xue Ziliang was caring for Salina, who was now sick, so they walked slower—giving the aching Guo Yi a chance to catch his breath. The farther they went, the louder the water sounds. The terrain here grew steep; rocky slopes appeared frequently. The group walked and climbed, turned a corner, and ahead was a vast stone beach. River water cascaded down nine rocky levels, thundering like thunder. The riverbed was strewn with boulders scattered in the water. In the river, a cluster of rock stacks over ten meters in diameter had cracked tops shaped like petals, pinkish—resembling lotus flowers blooming on the water. Some looked like old men playing chess; others like anglers fishing. Some, from water erosion, had stones in hollows constantly spinning and clacking.

"Nice scenery..." After the life-or-death struggle, the trio's spirits had lifted. As they walked, they suddenly spotted four luggage-laden people standing on the stone beach ahead—the Ming family.

While the agents had rested, the family behind had overtaken them. Seeing them approach, the two women showed wary, frightened expressions. Guo Yi figured they'd probably seen the bodies on the road.

The hot-tempered old man didn't even look at them. He squatted alone under a large boulder on the beach, head in hands, apparently deep in troubled thought.

Guo Yi looked over. The stone just had three palm-sized characters carved on it: "Bairren Rapids." What was there to study?

Seeing Xue Ziliang about to approach, the policewoman suddenly stepped back, looking guarded. Xue Ziliang was baffled.

The old lady held her daughter-in-law's hand, looking at their sharpened wooden poles, forcing a slight smile:

"It's nothing, nothing—as long as it's familiar faces..."

Guo Yi hurried forward and honestly described everything that had happened on the road. When he mentioned the attack by a dozen people, they clearly showed disbelief. Only when he produced his credentials did their suspicion lessen. The pretty policewoman named Mu Min examined his documents for a long time before returning them.

"Don't mind—fake police credentials are everywhere now." She plopped down on a rock, gesturing at the stone beside her. Her staring husband quickly sat down.

*Damn—so obedient.* Before Guo Yi could despise the husband, Mu Min began talking about internal system matters. Both were in the same system—different departments, but enough common ground. Through conversation, he learned this lady was impressive: three years in Public Order, five in Criminal Investigation, one in Political Affairs—a capable all-rounder. As they talked, Guo Yi noticed her wariness diminishing. He suddenly realized: *This woman is vetting my "background"*—even with 100% authentic credentials, only an insider could know system internals.

*Formidable!* Guo Yi secretly felt ashamed. The gap between people—how could it be so big?

Both having shown their cards, wariness diminished. Li Mei—the old lady—became warmer. Seeing Salina unwell and feverish, she dug out medicine from her luggage, plus preserved plums, ham sausages, crackers—all sorts of stuff—to share. The agent trio hadn't eaten since morning and had exercised strenuously—their stomachs were growling. Xue Ziliang, while wolfing down ham sausage, quietly told Guo Yi that these probably contained excess preservatives and were just oil and starch—extremely unhealthy...

"You're picky! If you're afraid of dying, don't eat!" Guo Yi was deeply annoyed with this ABC—not because the jerk kept acting like America was greatest, but because he kept hogging the job of supporting Salina, subtly unbalancing his equilibrium.
