# Chapter 1322 - Guiding Trends

Watching the once-flourishing Jasmine Pavilion Academy gradually sink back into obscurity, the study halls that had once resounded with reading voices becoming empty and desolate, with only a few people coming each day to read and attend lectures—in the past, whenever he lectured at Jasmine Pavilion, not only would the licentiates and student scholars enrolled at the academy attend without fail, but even scholars and gentry who weren't students at the academy would come in droves, filling the lecture hall to capacity.

These glorious scenes were now things of the past. Jasmine Pavilion Academy's appeal had particularly faded over the past year. Most students had withdrawn one after another; the few who still persisted showed restless expressions. The number attending Liu the Successful Candidate's lectures also dwindled—the local gentry and their sons especially rarely showed their faces. Some who came frequently did so merely to greet him and chat; they showed little interest in the lecture content.

Liu Dalin was deeply anxious—not because his own influence had declined, but because he felt that the "learning of the sages" in Lingao as a whole had entered a period of decay.

This decay was different from the past decay caused by economic hardship. Back then, even though the county couldn't pay out rice and money, leaving the licentiates barely scraping by and the student scholars in even worse straits, people still had the "heart for learning." Liu Dalin had heard Wang Ci speak more than once of how such-and-such a student scholar worked the fields during the day and read during rest breaks; how such-and-such a licentiate read while herding cattle or gathering firewood... these kinds of inspiring stories about studying. The grand scene when Jasmine Pavilion Academy was restored and reopened demonstrated the local scholars' great enthusiasm for learning.

Now, this spirit of eager learning had completely vanished. The scholars seemed like entirely different people—one and all urgently wanting to work and make money, build houses, marry wives, buy all manner of "Australian goods." They had cast the learning of the sages aside; their daily conversations were all about "Australian learning."

But he really couldn't blame the Australians. Not only had the Australians restored Jasmine Pavilion Academy, but even the desks, chairs, writing materials, and a considerable library of several hundred volumes of classics, histories, and philosophical works all came from Australian "donations."

Even the monthly stipend the students received while studying here came entirely from a "fund" established by the Australians.

On this matter, the Australians could claim a clear conscience—not only had they taken no action to suppress Confucianism, but they had provided a learning environment better than before, allowing many previously cold and hungry scholars to study in comfort and security. Providing vast quantities of books for free borrowing was a "lavish act" that local scholars in the past wouldn't have dared imagine.

Yet students kept leaving in a steady stream, abandoning the learning of the "sage's righteous path" to work for the Australians. Why was this?

Liu Dalin pondered this question for a long time. He realized that ultimately it was nothing more than human nature's "pursuit of profit." When it came down to it, Confucian scholars were people too, and couldn't escape the two characters "human desire." Throughout history, scholars had advanced through learning to become officials. Most who spoke of serving country and people were ultimately serving their own fame and fortune.

For Lingao's scholars, the path of "advance through learning to serve as officials" had always been rocky. In Liu Dalin's view, this path was virtually impassable in Lingao—not only impassable in Lingao, but the number throughout all of Qiongzhou Prefecture who could walk this path could be counted on one's fingers.

Still, this was at least a path for scholars to "leap over the dragon gate." Even if one couldn't become a Recommended Man or Metropolitan Graduate, obtaining a licentiate's credentials exempted one from two *shi* of grain and made one a person of status in the countryside... This was barely enough to keep people gritting their teeth and persevering on this path.

Now the Australians had provided an effortless path to "advance through learning to serve"—one didn't even need to excel at learning. Scholars merely needed to be able to read and write to secure a position with the Australians and live a respectable life. Even the most hopeless cases, those who got beaten with planks after every child's examination, were now teaching at Fangcao Di with quite the air of a respected educator.

Everything the Australians did revolved around the single character "profit." From establishing markets and attracting merchants right after landing, to later surveying and equalizing land taxes, establishing the Tiandihui to aid farmers... all these actions targeted people's profit-seeking nature. They could be called paragons of guiding trends to advantage.

Liu Dalin had developed a secret apprehension. He sensed that the Australians harbored terrifying hidden ambitions, yet he couldn't produce a shred of evidence to prove his suspicions. Because this group that put "profit" first and was most skilled at using benefits to guide the common people, did not themselves pursue profit. Setting aside their almost overly fastidious simplicity, their daily governance—from anyone's perspective—consisted of doing good deeds.

Eliminating bandits, providing work relief during disasters, rescuing refugees, building water conservancy works, constructing bridges and roads, encouraging industry and commerce, supporting agriculture and farming, establishing schools... all these consumed massive resources yet brought the court little revenue. If past local officials had earnestly accomplished even one or two such things during their tenure—even just one-tenth or one-hundredth of what the Australians did—it would have been enough to make the entire county's people weep with gratitude. Let alone the fact that since the Australians arrived, virtually everyone in the county—gentry, farmers, artisans, and merchants—had benefited from them in some way, with each day better than the last. Not only did the local common people prosper, but the Australians also took in large numbers of refugees, helping them settle here, establish farms and workshops, giving everyone work to do, food to eat, clothes to wear. Whether Lingao had now achieved "no one picks up dropped items on the road and doors can be left unlocked at night"—that might be overstating things. But that the common people had never had it so good—that was true.

Now the Australians weren't just doing this in Lingao; they were gradually expanding throughout Qiongzhou Prefecture—even affecting Leizhou across the straits.

Liu Dalin had read history. How could he not recognize this as a scheme for "royal hegemony"? In fact, rumors that the Australians intended to change dynasties had been circulating in the marketplaces for some time, and were even semi-openly discussed among the county's gentry.

Liu Dalin adopted a stance of non-participation and no-comment regarding such talk—in fact, his feelings toward the Australians were deeply conflicted. On one hand, everything the Australians did "benefited the people." On the other hand, as a Metropolitan Graduate of the Great Ming who felt he had "received deep imperial grace," he was unwilling to see the Australians someday challenge the Central Plains. Given the Ming's condition, once war began, wouldn't the Australians sweep everything before them like a hurricane! Even the petty Jurchen savages posed a great threat to the court; if replaced by these "cropped pirates," the consequences would be even more unpredictable. Whenever his thoughts reached this point, he refused to think further.

He suddenly sighed: "Ah! Teaching without discrimination, teaching without discrimination—how can we live up to it? How is it that these Australians have achieved it instead?"

Seeing Liu Dalin's tone was off, Huang Bingkun hastily said: "These cropped pirates are now wealthy and powerful, so naturally they pretend to refined culture and try to win hearts. But when it comes to poetry and prose, in all of Lingao County, Headmaster Liu still has no peer. The headmaster going to see the pirates' school is merely to broaden perspectives and gain some insight, nothing more."

Liu Dalin studied the Huang family's second young master who was still rambling on trying to persuade him. He wondered why this "anti-pirate faction" member had suddenly developed such intense interest in the Australians' school. Clearly he wanted to use Liu's credentials to "investigate" Fangcao Di—and Liu himself had precisely that intention as well.

In recent days, some of his fellow students from when he had studied abroad in Guangdong, or fellow examinees from the provincial examination, whether acquainted or not at the time, had all been writing to Liu Dalin. Ostensibly to "renew old ties," but more importantly to probe him about the origins and details of Lingao's Australians. Some asked if business could be done with them; some asked why they didn't respect the king's civilizing influence; some asked whether their fearsome firearms were real; still others commissioned Liu Dalin to purchase Australian curiosities and rarities. The variety was endless.

Having just recovered from serious illness, Liu Dalin read these letters and suddenly realized how pale and ignorant his understanding of the Australians was. This group that had once seemed like nothing more than overseas barbarians—and yet they had prompted so many scholars in Guangdong to write detailed inquiries. Kong Youde who had caused chaos in Shandong, the Jurchen savages outside the passes—neither had provoked such attention from scholars. Those were merely military men in rebellion. Clearly the Australians' influence in Guangdong was growing by the day.

Being stared at by Liu the Successful Candidate, Huang Bingkun's skin crawled. Just as he didn't know what to say, he suddenly saw Liu Dalin sit up straight in his wheelchair, grave as when lecturing at the county school, and say solemnly: "As I see those Australians, though their learning differs from ours, their minds have great depths. Moreover, they share the bloodline of the Huaxia; they are certainly not barbarians. I shall immediately go seek an audience with Director Wang and ask him to mediate so that we may visit the Australians' school—to increase our knowledge and broaden our horizons."

Huang Bingkun had finally persuaded Liu Dalin. The stone in his heart could finally settle. Fangcao Di was currently still mainly a boarding school; only immediate family members could make appointments to visit students. When Huang Ping had registered for enrollment, Huang Bingkun hadn't been listed among his family members. Moreover, the Huang family had a blood feud with the pirates over the killing of one of their sons. Even if the Huang family no longer harbored thoughts of revenge, the pirates would surely be on strict guard.

After leaving Liu Dalin's home, he returned to Jasmine Pavilion Academy to see if there were any licentiates he could bring along to make an impressive showing. But the academy was empty. The eastern and western study halls, where bunks had once been hard to come by, were now desolate—beds and desks bare and visible at a glance. Only a few bunks showed signs of occupancy.

As he stood there uncertainly, a hand suddenly clapped down heavily on his right shoulder. Huang Bingkun, absorbed in his thoughts, started and turned to see his comrade-in-arms the "Excrement Baron" Young Master Li—this Young Master Li hadn't come to the study hall in quite a while, having been busy frequenting the County Consultative Bureau. His sudden appearance at the academy was quite unexpected.

"Hey, Brother Huang, how have you been?"

"You! Startled me to death—what are you doing?!"

"Brother Huang, truly you are one who understands the times and becomes a hero."

"What do you mean? What's this about?"

"Don't pretend. Brother Huang, isn't your Huang Family Stockade about to join that Tiandihui?"

"What! What, what did you say?!"
