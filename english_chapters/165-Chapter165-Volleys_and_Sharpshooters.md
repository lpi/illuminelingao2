# Chapter 165: Volleys and Sharpshooters

After enduring all this—proven fully-adapted to military-life—shooting-training officially-began.

Firearms—even muzzle-loading rifles—were this-timespace's most-powerful infantry-weapons. Transmigrators had to ensure wielders were loyal-and-reliable.

Some couldn't-tolerate such-life—requesting-withdrawal. Such people were assigned as commune-laborers. But they had to repay double: settling-allowance, wages, meals. Until debt-cleared—couldn't leave commune. Beyond basic-rations—no payment.

As for runaways—transmigrators' powerful communications and night-vision made darkness/distance useless for deserters. Captured runaways without-exception went to quarries and brickworks as hard-labor.

However—situation exceeded Ma Qianzhu's expectations. Deserters and withdrawal-requesters totaled fewer-than-twenty. Vast-majority persevered.

Shooting-training was led by Li Yunxing—former-provincial shooting-team athlete. Most-qualified. For training, he requisitioned one-rifle and 100-rounds—shooting for a-week to master Minié-rifle characteristics.

Muzzle-loading rifled-accuracy was quite-good. These rifles were pre-transmigration manufacture—good-materials, fine-craftsmanship, calibrated. Li Yunxing quickly found his-groove.

Starting from basic holding/shouldering posture-correction, then stability-training while shouldering-aiming. Everything qualified—then shooting-practice.

Rifles' distribution-day caused great-excitement. These guns differed from any-firearms they'd-seen. Barrels' blued-color with subtle-luster. All-parts cleanly-finished—none of ironwork's usual-roughness. Gleaming three-edged bayonets in leather-sheaths. Leather ammunition-pouches with yellow-paper-wrapped cartridges. Small-golden copper-pieces called "percussion-caps."

Guns felt substantial-but-lighter than training-rifles. Every-dimension appropriately-sized. Those familiar with matchlocks, three-barrels, or other-firelocks found these rifles extraordinarily-handy—not awkward at-all.

First live-fire: rifles' dense-smoke, acrid-powder-smell, heavy-recoil—deeply-impressed first-time shooters. Lead-balls' penetration through thick-wood-targets made them gasp. Traditional-matchlocks fired iron-shot—thick wooden-doors could-block.

To boost weapon-confidence, Li Yunxing persuaded Ma Qianzhu to requisition one iron-armor from stores. On-site test-shot at 200m—clean through-and-through. Everyone stunned.

"Damn—iron-armor's useless now?" Lin Fu touched smoking-hole in breastplate. "Fighting's too-easy."

"We're invincible! Just stand-and-shoot—nobody can-charge." Soldiers howled-excitedly. Morale surged.

"Invincible's premature." Li Yunxing said. "But huge-advantage. Outrange, out-accuracy, faster-firing than enemies. Cavalry, archers—can't threaten us.

"But if enemy has massed-cavalry—shooting alone won't-work. Maximum-range 400m—cavalry crosses in under one-minute. How-many shots in one-minute?"

"Three-or-four?"

"If we're outnumbered—within one-minute, everyone fires three-four-shots—enemy not-routed—then what?"

Everyone fell-silent. One man—previously-quiet—spoke: "Use pikes to hold. Form-square. Pikemen outside protecting musketeers inside."

"Correct—that's one-method." Li Yunxing wasn't surprised—this wasn't exotic. Ming-era had similar-tactics: pikemen covering gunners, upgraded with war-wagons. "Any-better-ideas?"

"Triple-rank." The man continued. "Musketeers in three-rows, rotating-volleys. One-minute becomes more-than three-four shots—continuous."

"Excellent! Where'd you learn?" Li Yunxing was amazed. "Three-segment-fire" was considered transmigrator-secret-technique. Didn't expect Ming-people already-knew. Reconsidering: if Sengoku-Japan developed this-tactic, Ming wouldn't miss-it.

"I saw Capital-garrison drilling."

"Good eye. Name?"

Man snapped awkward-attention-fist-salute: "Huang Xiong, from North-Zhili Hejian."

"Good. Report to headquarters after-drill."

"Yes sir!"

Shooting-training was easier. Instilling weapon-maintenance was harder. Almost-nobody realized firearms needed-maintenance. After first-day's shooting-training—despite required-cleaning—surprise night-inspection found only a-few soldiers had complied.

Ancients didn't emphasize firearm-maintenance. Cannons got covered outdoors at-most. Matchlocks were low-quality—more likely self-wounding than enemy-killing. Soldiers disliked them—maintenance was unthinkable.

Muzzle-loaders used residue-heavy black-powder and paper-cartridges—demanding higher-maintenance. Li Yunxing had to enforce mandatory-maintenance after every-shooting-session—personally teaching each-soldier. Every-rifle inspected before-dismissal. Then delegating to squad-leaders—layered-inspection-system. Li Yunxing checked squad-leaders; squad-leaders checked every-soldier. Combined with harsh-punishments—cleaning-habit finally-established. Though earning complaints—"Chiefs" being unnecessary-fussy.

Ma Qianzhu repeatedly received spy-reports from planted-informants: "Cleaning-barrels is waste! Residue dumped-out is fine—still-fires without-cleaning."

Others said: these Australian-merchants are all "odd"—only knowing rigid-rules. Unlike locals who improvise.

Reading such soldier-psychology-reports, Ma Qianzhu recalled early-reform-era joint-venture Chinese-employees discussing foreign-managers. Remarkably-similar.

Tian Liang's shooting-results were middling-low. Li Yunxing's standard: 100m distance, 10-shots, 6-on-target was passing. Tian Liang's first-test: 3-hits. Third retest—barely-passed.

But some excelled. Ruan-brothers all scored "good" first-test. One former Gou-Manor militiaman—Yang Zeng—scored the-only "excellent": 10-for-10.

"Great shooting!" Li Yunxing excitedly patted his-shoulder.

"Thank you, Chief." Yang Zeng snapped standard-attention. "Was formerly a-hunter."

"Hunter? No-wonder your eyesight's good."

"No—I used similar-muskets before."

"Oh?" Li Yunxing was-interested.

"When I was guardsman for Gou-Master—no, Gou-Eldest—" He quickly self-corrected. "Sea-pirates once delivered cargo. Included dozens of such-guns." He gestured. "Not as-good as Chiefs' guns—fire-cord, heavier."

Li Yunxing recalled: Gou-Manor captured-weapons included foreign-items—some matchlocks. Per historical-experts—probably English.

"Those guns were far-better than manor's matchlocks—more-accurate. But guardsmen feared injuries from matchlocks—wouldn't-use. Gou-Eldest saw I-liked them—gave-one. I practiced shooting-birds. Got-familiar."

"Such accuracy—Gou-Eldest must've valued you?"

Yang Zeng's face showed embarrassment. After Gou-Manor capture, arriving at Bairren Fortress, repeated-interrogations, labor-reform period—having no-crimes and voluntarily-surrendering—he was assigned commune-work. He'd learned: these "bald-bandits" or "short-hairs" or "Australian-merchants" most-valued clean "historical-records." His Gou-guardsman-history was clearly a-stain.

"Reporting to Chief—" He spoke-carefully. "I was just ordinary Gou-Manor guardsman. Though accurate with-guns—Gou-Eldest didn't particularly-value me. He preferred sword-and-spear skills."

"However-good swords-and-spears—can they stop your gunshot?" Li Yunxing knew-nothing of his-thoughts—assumed he felt under-appreciated.

"Only with masters' guns—never dreamed guns could shoot so-far, so-accurate, so-fast." Yang Zeng grew-excited discussing firearms. "Foreign-guns were-good—but compared to these, far-inferior."

"Oh? Tell-me what's-different?"

"Benefits are-many. Best two-points in my-view: First—percussion-caps. Just-place and fire. No priming-powder—safe and-convenient. Second—paper-cartridges pre-measured. Easy-use, accurate-quantity. Before I poured-powder from-bag—guess-work. Sometimes too-much, sometimes too-little. Not like paper-cartridges—always-right."

Li Yunxing thought: this man was remarkable. Ordinary-soldiers mechanically-followed instructions. He had many-thoughts—rare-talent.

"10-for-10 at 100m. What about 200m? Try?"

"Chief's orders—I'll-obey!" Words plus chest-out-attention looked-incongruous.

Li Yunxing specially-issued J+-marked precision-Minié. 200m target: 1.5m-diameter circle. Yang Zeng focused-breathed—again 10-for-10.

Incredible! Li Yunxing was astonished. Minié-rifles—though rifled—couldn't match breech-loading metal-cartridge rifles' accuracy. Yang Zeng's matchlock-experience—one-month-training—hitting this-level meant exceptional-talent.

Target-moved to 300m. Yang Zeng missed 4. At 400m—still-hit 4. Remarkable-score. Several Military-Committee veterans applauded. Even with Type-56 SKS—this was-respectable.

"Excellent. You'll be sniper." Li Yunxing was-delighted his-unit produced such-talent.

"Thank-you Chief for promotion!" Yang Zeng didn't-know what "sniper" meant—but intuited it-benefited-him.

He and several excellent-shooters were-selected together—training as-snipers. Wei Aiwen decided forming a-skirmisher-platoon beyond infantry-companies for long-range precision-support.
