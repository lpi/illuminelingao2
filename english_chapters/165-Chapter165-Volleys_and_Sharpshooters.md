# Chapter 165: Volleys and Sharpshooters

After enduring all this and proving they were fully adapted to military life, shooting training officially began.

Firearms, even muzzle-loading rifles, were this era's most powerful infantry weapons. The transmigrators had to ensure that the wielders were loyal and reliable.

Some couldn't tolerate such a life and requested to withdraw. Such people were assigned as commune laborers. But they had to repay double: settlement allowance, wages, and meals. Until the debt was cleared, they couldn't leave the commune. Beyond basic rations, there was no payment.

As for runaways, the transmigrators' powerful communications and night vision made darkness and distance useless. Captured runaways, without exception, went to quarries and brickworks as hard labor.

However, the situation exceeded Ma Qianzhu's expectations. Deserters and withdrawal-requesters totaled fewer than twenty. The vast majority persevered.

Shooting training was led by Li Yunxing, a former provincial shooting team athlete. He was the most qualified. For training, he requisitioned one rifle and 100 rounds, spending a week shooting to master the Minié rifle's characteristics.

The accuracy of the muzzle-loading rifle was quite good. These rifles were pre-transmigration manufacture—made of good materials, with fine craftsmanship, and calibrated. Li Yunxing quickly found his groove.

He started with basic posture correction for holding and shouldering the rifle, followed by stability training while aiming. Once everyone qualified, shooting practice began.

The day the rifles were distributed caused great excitement. These guns differed from any firearms they had seen. The blued barrels had a subtle luster. All parts were cleanly finished—none had the usual roughness of ironwork. There were gleaming three-edged bayonets in leather sheaths, and leather ammunition pouches with yellow paper-wrapped cartridges. There were also small golden copper pieces called "percussion caps."

The guns felt substantial but lighter than training rifles. Every dimension was appropriately sized. Those familiar with matchlocks, three-barrels, or other firelocks found these rifles extraordinarily handy and not awkward at all.

During the first live-fire exercise, the rifles' dense smoke, acrid powder smell, and heavy recoil deeply impressed the first-time shooters. The penetration of the lead balls through thick wood targets made them gasp. Traditional matchlocks fired iron shot, which thick wooden doors could block.

To boost confidence in the weapon, Li Yunxing persuaded Ma Qianzhu to requisition one iron armor from stores. The on-site test shot at 200m went clean through. Everyone was stunned.

"Damn—is iron armor useless now?" Lin Fu touched the smoking hole in the breastplate. "Fighting is too easy."

"We're invincible! Just stand and shoot—nobody can charge." The soldiers howled excitedly. Morale surged.

"'Invincible' is premature," Li Yunxing said. "But we have a huge advantage. Outrange, out-accuracy, faster firing than enemies. Cavalry and archers can't threaten us."

"But if the enemy has massed cavalry—shooting alone won't work. Maximum range is 400m—cavalry crosses that in under one minute. How many shots can we fire in one minute?"

"Three or four?"

"If we're outnumbered, and within one minute everyone fires three or four shots but the enemy isn't routed—then what?"

Everyone fell silent. One man—previously quiet—spoke: "Use pikes to hold the line. Form a square. Pikemen on the outside protecting the musketeers inside."

"Correct—that's one method." Li Yunxing wasn't surprised—this wasn't exotic. The Ming era had similar tactics: pikemen covering gunners, often upgraded with war wagons. "Any better ideas?"

"Triple rank," the man continued. "Musketeers in three rows, rotating volleys. One minute becomes more than three or four shots—it becomes continuous."

"Excellent! Where did you learn that?" Li Yunxing was amazed. "Three-rank volley fire" was considered a transmigrator secret technique. He hadn't expected Ming people already knew it. Reconsidering: if Sengoku Japan developed this tactic, Ming wouldn't miss it.

"I saw the Capital garrison drilling."

"Good eye. Name?"

The man snapped an awkward attention fist-salute: "Huang Xiong, from North Zhili Hejian."

"Good. Report to headquarters after drill."

"Yes sir!"

Shooting training was easier. Instilling the habit of weapon maintenance was harder. Almost nobody realized firearms needed maintenance. After the first day's shooting training—despite the required cleaning—a surprise night inspection found only a few soldiers had complied.

The ancients didn't emphasize firearm maintenance. At most, cannons were covered when left outdoors. Matchlocks were low quality—more likely self-wounding than enemy-killing. Soldiers disliked them, so maintenance was unthinkable.

Muzzle-loaders used residue-heavy black powder and paper cartridges, demanding higher maintenance. Li Yunxing had to enforce mandatory maintenance after every shooting session, personally teaching each soldier. Every rifle was inspected before dismissal. Then delegating to squad leaders—a layered inspection system. Li Yunxing checked squad leaders; squad leaders checked every soldier. Combined with harsh punishments—the cleaning habit was finally established. Though it earned complaints—"The Chiefs" are being unnecessarily fussy.

Ma Qianzhu repeatedly received reports from planted informants: "Cleaning barrels is waste! Residue dumped out is fine—still fires without cleaning."

Others said: these Australian merchants are all "odd"—only knowing rigid rules. Unlike the locals, who improvised.

Reading such soldier psychology reports, Ma Qianzhu recalled early-reform-era joint-venture Chinese employees discussing foreign managers. It was remarkably similar.

Tian Liang's shooting results were below average. Li Yunxing's standard: 100m distance, 10 shots, 6 on-target was passing. Tian Liang's first test: 3 hits. Third retest—barely passed.

But some excelled. The Ruan brothers all scored "good" on the first test. One former Gou Manor militiaman—Yang Zeng—scored the only "excellent": 10-for-10.

"Great shooting!" Li Yunxing excitedly patted his shoulder.

"Thank you, Chief." Yang Zeng snapped to standard attention. "Was formerly a hunter."

"Hunter? No wonder your eyesight's good."

"No—I used similar muskets before."

"Oh?" Li Yunxing was interested.

"When I was a guardsman for the Gou Master—no, Gou Eldest—" He quickly self-corrected. "Sea pirates once delivered cargo. It included dozens of such guns." He gestured. "Not as good as Chiefs' guns—fire-cord, heavier."

Li Yunxing recalled: weapons captured from Gou Manor included foreign items—some matchlocks. Per historical experts, they were probably English.

"Those guns were far better than the manor's matchlocks—more accurate. But the guardsmen feared injuries from the matchlocks and wouldn't use them. Gou Eldest saw I liked them, so he gave me one. I practiced shooting birds. Got familiar."

"Such accuracy—Gou Eldest must have valued you?"

Yang Zeng's face showed embarrassment. After the capture of Gou Manor, his arrival at Bairren Fortress, repeated interrogations, and labor reform period—having no crimes and voluntarily surrendering—he was assigned commune work. He had learned that these "bald bandits" or "short-hairs" or "Australian merchants" most valued clean "historical records." His Gou guardsman history was clearly a stain.

"Reporting to Chief—" He spoke carefully. "I was just an ordinary Gou Manor guardsman. Though accurate with guns—Gou Eldest didn't particularly value me. He preferred sword and spear skills."

"However good swords and spears are—can they stop your gunshot?" Li Yunxing knew nothing of his thoughts—he assumed he felt under-appreciated.

"Only with masters' guns—never dreamed guns could shoot so far, so accurate, so fast." Yang Zeng grew excited discussing firearms. "Foreign guns were good—but compared to these, far inferior."

"Oh? Tell me what's different."

"There are many benefits. The two best points in my view are: First, the percussion caps. Just place and fire. No priming powder—it's safe and convenient. Second, the pre-measured paper cartridges. They are easy to use and have an accurate quantity. Before, I poured powder from a bag which was mostly guesswork. Sometimes it was too much, sometimes too little. It's not like the paper cartridges, which are always right."

Li Yunxing thought: this man was remarkable. Ordinary soldiers mechanically followed instructions. He had many thoughts—rare talent.

"10-for-10 at 100m. What about 200m? Try?"

"Chief's orders—I'll obey!" The words, combined with his chest-out attention stance, looked incongruous.

Li Yunxing specially issued a "J+" marked precision Minié rifle. 200m target: 1.5m-diameter circle. Yang Zeng focused, breathed—again 10-for-10.

Incredible! Li Yunxing was astonished. Minié rifles, though rifled, couldn't match the accuracy of breech-loading metal-cartridge rifles. Given Yang Zeng's matchlock experience and one month's training, hitting this level meant exceptional talent.

The target moved to 300m. Yang Zeng missed 4. At 400m—still hit 4. Remarkable score. Several Military Committee veterans applauded. Even with a Type-56 SKS, this would be respectable.

"Excellent. You'll be a sniper." Li Yunxing was delighted his unit produced such talent.

"Thank you Chief for promotion!" Yang Zeng didn't know what "sniper" meant—but he intuited it benefited him.

He and several excellent shooters were selected together—training as snipers. Wei Aiwen decided to form a skirmisher platoon outside the infantry companies to provide long-range precision support.
