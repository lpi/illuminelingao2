# Chapter 150: Casting Cannons (Part 3)

Now the Artillery Group faced another choice: solid-casting plus deep-drilling for barrel manufacture, or continuing hollow-casting.

"Next, let's try the drilling method? But first—need to make a drilling machine." Mechanical Group members were enthusiastic.

"The drilling method is trickier." Lin Shenhe thought. "Efficiency's also low. I'd suggest trying Rodman Casting."

"Center-cooling casting?" Wang Luobin asked.

"You know about it?" Lin Shenhe was surprised. "I thought few in China knew."

"Personal hobby, purely personal hobby." Wang Luobin thought: if I weren't in a water-product nation, not as free as you in decadent America, I'd have cast cannons already.

So-called Rodman Casting: internal-mold water-cooling method.

The principle was simple: pig iron's cooling rate during casting affects mechanical properties. Theoretically, faster cooling meant harder material. Ideal cannons should be hardest at the center (bore). But reality was opposite—cannon casting had slowest center cooling. Because: first, outer layers enclosed inner layers—outer couldn't cool before inner. Second, outer surface area exceeded inner. Whether radiation or convection—cooling rate was proportional to surface area. So outside cooled first. This made barrel density distribution non-ideal—greatly reducing barrel lifespan.

First to cool meant first to shrink. If the outer layer hardened while the inner layer remained hot—outer became harder than inner. The inner bore might deform, or cracks might form during inner cooling. This raised casting rejection rates, shortened barrel lifespan, sometimes affected firing performance.

During the 1860s American Civil War, U.S. Army Major Thomas Jackson Rodman invented this hollow-casting process: casting around cores, with water-cooling inside cores. This made bore interiors harden first. This was Rodman Casting. Outer metal cooling shrinkage pressed inward onto already-hardened inner layers. Thus, propellant explosions would be absorbed by the entire thick metal surrounding the bore—not expanding layer-by-layer outward. During the Civil War and following 20 years, this method produced most U.S. Navy heavy cast-iron cannons. Rodman Casting's greatest significance: dramatically reduced casting rejection rates, especially for heavy cannons.

From a cost perspective, Rodman Casting dramatically reduced rejections, lowering casting costs. Secondly, this process dramatically extended barrel lifespan, reducing operating costs.

Travelers' enemies and potential enemies controlled far greater manpower and resources. To defeat them, transmigrators must control all costs.

"This method's worth trying. But we'll need a water-containing hard-core—can't use clay molds anymore." Ji Wusheng considered casting issues.

"Let's use iron-mold casting. Apparently Chinese invented it first."

"Correct—Gong Zhenlin invented it. Quite a genius."

Gong Zhenlin was Jiaxing County deputy magistrate, Zhejiang—normally unrelated to the munitions industry. But he had a "naturally clever" reputation. During the Opium War, Governor-General Yu Qian transferred him to Ningbo military camp specifically for cannon casting.

At that time, Chinese cannon casting was extremely backward. The method was:

Using water-mixed clay to make molds, then casting metal layer-by-layer into pattern joints. Clay molds must be completely dried—otherwise, outside might appear dry while inside remained moist. Meeting molten metal, moisture would generate steam. Resulting cannons would have honeycombs; firing might burst barrels and injure personnel. Drying clay molds often took a month—rainy, snowy, or cold weather required 2–3 months. Moreover, each clay mold produced only one cannon—immediately discarded. Non-reusable.

From these descriptions, 1840s Chinese cannon smiths' techniques matched pre-1713 European casting methods the transmigrators had experimentally used. But simple processing techniques European smiths used 150 years earlier—like mold reinforcement ribs, mold firing, post-casting bore polishing—were completely unknown.

Craftsmen had no mold-making standards—dimensions and techniques existed only in memory. Cannon proportions weren't valued. These already-obsolete techniques were craftsmen's livelihoods—regarded as "secret methods." No technical exchange; no improvement. Disconnected from the era, yet multiple completely closed, mutually secret "schools" existed. Result: produced cannons were even inferior to Ming-era Red Barbarian Cannon copies.

Gong Zhenlin—facing urgent warfare, high cannon losses, enormous demand—couldn't wait one month per batch. After experimentation, he finally invented iron-mold cannon casting.

Iron-mold casting: using iron to make hard molds. When casting: first brush two-layer slurry inside each mold segment. First layer: fine rice-hull ash and fine sand-clay. Second layer: top-quality fine kiln coal mixed with water. Then assemble segments, clamp with iron hoops, heat thoroughly, connect segments end-to-end, finally pour molten metal. After sufficient liquid and cooling, immediately remove iron-mold segments like peeling bamboo shoots—gradually exposing the barrel. Remove the internal clay core—the bore interior naturally smooth.

Compared to traditional clay-mold casting, iron-mold advantages: produced barrels were high-quality with smooth interior and exterior—unlike clay molds causing air bubbles. No laborious clay-mold preparation and waiting—production was fast, weather-independent. Reusable molds meant fast production, high output, low cost. Greater significance: standardized manufacturing. Standardization produced batches of nearly identical external appearance and performance—crucial for cannons.

Colleagues praised: "Method extremely simple; usage extremely convenient. One worker achieves hundreds workers' benefit; one cannon saves tens-of-times cost. Casting produces immediately; no delays. Flawless; naturally smooth. Half effort, double results; endless utility. Pioneering untrodden paths; opening thousand-year methods. Its military benefit to nation—how could it be trivial!"

Gong Zhenlin's iron-mold casting preceded the West by 30 years—one of China's few modern-era world-leading technologies.

The Artillery Group continued bothering the Lumber Factory—first making wooden positive-molds. Then Ji Wusheng and Zhan Wuya together performed sand-casting to make iron negative-molds for cannon casting. Cores were also iron—hollow inside—with water-inlet and outlet pipes at the ends.

When molten metal was poured into molds, it began slowly cooling. Then inner-core water came into play—metal nearest the core cooled first, solidifying to steel, while outer metal cooled slower. Due to thermal expansion and contraction, when the entire casting cooled, outer slower-cooled portions tightly constricted inner earlier-cooled portions. This generated inward clamping force—enabling barrels to withstand greater chamber pressure. This internal-mold-controlled cooling achieved "barrel self-stressing" effect.

Self-stressed barrels had dramatically extended lifespan—also allowing greatly reduced barrel thickness, reducing weight, increasing mobility.

Rodman Casting's process was extremely simple. With molds ready, the Artillery Group quickly produced the first finished cannon. This cannon was far superior to clay-mold versions—especially requiring no barrel polishing. Bore smoothness greatly improved. Though still needing bore polishing—tool consumption was much reduced.

To verify cast cannons met technical parameters, the Artillery Group decided to test-fire at Bopu. Shells were cast cast-iron solid shot. Casting carefully controlled bore-gap tolerances. The Mechanical Group built two-wheeled carriages for these two cannons—plus ammunition limbers. Looked quite proper. Wang Luobin visited the farm—finally borrowing 4 horses. But on-site, a problem emerged: no suitable multi-horse harnesses. Road-running two-wheeled carts used single-horse—harnesses were directly bought from the original timespace. Nobody knew how to make harnesses. Finally resorting to the resource library again—finding the answer from a photograph.

Before harnesses were made, the impatient Navy heard cannons were finished—immediately sent a rowboat to transport. Two 6-pounders and carriages were lashed to empty-oil-drum rafts, tow-hauled by rowboat to Bopu Harbor.

Cannons were placed on open ground beside Bopu shipyard. Spectators streamed endlessly—especially Navy people, nearly all fondling these two black-iron cannons. Looking beautiful from every angle. One Navy man named Li Haiping simply proposed mounting cannons on ships immediately.

"Mount on ships? Look clearly—these are towed 6-pounder cannons. Genuine Army guns." Zhang Bailin, seeing beloved cannons about to be Navy-snatched, immediately jumped to object.

"Forget 'towed'—you got self-propelled? These little guns—Navy doesn't even want." Li Haiping looked unimpressed.

"What did you say?!" Zhang Bailin's hair stood on end—wanting to punch him, showing Army's strength.

"What's there to argue?" Wang Luobin hurried over to mediate. "Whether these cannons can even fire is still unknown. Why bicker!"
