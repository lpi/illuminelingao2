# Chapter 647 Night Raid

Under the cover of Light Infantry, the Medical Corps and militia cleaning the battlefield opened the stockade gate and walked out. They first collected and encoffined their own fallen soldiers in front of the earthen dike. Many Fubo Army dead who fell from the earthen dike had their heads cut off, and identity tags hung around their necks were lost; they could only be registered and encoffined one by one by checking names from cloth tags sewn on their clothes. Subsequently, they began to clear the corpses of government soldiers, including dragging out corpses fallen in the trench one by one with hook poles. The weather was already getting hot; dropping so many corpses on the ground would soon cause a plague once they rotted.

Seeing the Hair Bandits opening the stockade gate and coming out in large numbers, the Ming army thought they were launching a counterattack, so they ascended the stockade wall one after another preparing to fight. However, they saw the Hair Bandit infantry stopped and formed arrays after advancing three hundred paces from the stockade. Many people wearing white robes came out from behind, their heads and faces wrapped in white cloth hoods, holding long poles in their hands. They hooked corpses one by one, pulled them together, and then transported them by wheelbarrow to a deep ditch for burial—the Engineering Corps buried a row of explosives and soon blasted out a deep ditch to bury corpses.

Abandoned government soldier wounded were occasionally found among the piles of corpses. As long as they could still move, they were loaded onto wheelbarrows one by one and transported back to the stockade for treatment.

What made He Ming and the Senators regretful was that the government army actually didn't leave behind a single corpse of an officer of Chiliarch rank or above, not to mention wounded ones. Even their personal surname flags were not found much.

He Ming didn't require recovery of swords, spears, and military equipment scattered on the ground, but abandoned army flags were all collected without leaving a single one—these were markers of military merit.

"The Hair Bandits actually don't cut off heads!" The government soldiers watched the enemy's actions curiously; not only did they not cut off heads, but they also took the wounded back. In the army of that time, getting injured in battle meant danger of losing one's life, let alone being unable to walk due to heavy wounds. Generally, when cleaning the battlefield after victory, regardless of friend or foe, heavy wounded were usually finished off on the spot.

For safety, the Fubo Army's action of collecting corpses and cleaning the battlefield only advanced to a place more than two hundred meters from the earthen dike. This distance was also where most corpses were left.

Just as the Medical Corps was busy clearing the battlefield, lightning flashed in the originally thick cloud layer, and bursts of dull thunder rolled over. A rainstorm was coming.

There were often rainstorms after great battles, especially in such a season with abundant water vapor and dense cloud layers in June and July; large amounts of dust and gunpowder smoke provided sufficient condensation nuclei.

"Now the corpses will be soaked bloated," Ryan withdrew the Medical Corps which finished hastily, saying with a frown, "Once the sun comes out tomorrow, I feel scared just thinking about the smell on the battlefield."

"Make do for now; deal with it later." He Ming seemed to smell the corpse stench along the road when advancing to Lang Son back then. "Disinfectant must be sprinkled in the camp too."

Ryan took off his gown emitting heavy smells of disinfectant and blood, throwing it together with oilcloth boots into the brightly burning boiler, which was boiling water to supply the troops.

"Infantry 6th Battalion assumes guard duty, pay attention to rain protection! Other troops eat immediately then rest." He Ming ordered loudly, "Tell the Logistics Department to ensure every tent and shed is dry."

"Understood." Xie Shu saluted and trotted away. Roll call sounds rang on the square in the camp. Soon the 3rd and 5th Infantry Battalions reported their vacancies. Killed and wounded officers and NCOs had to be replenished immediately, promoting meritorious soldiers. Soldier vacancies were filled by militia. This way all units could go to the battlefield fully equipped and manned tomorrow.

With a burst of fierce rolling thunder, sparse bean-sized raindrops fell on the ground, kicking up the smell of soil and blood. A gust of cold wind blew, making everyone shiver. A heavy rain poured down, accompanied by roaring thunder. For a time, golden snakes danced wildly between heaven and earth. A white rain curtain shrouded the world. The crashing sound of rain made voices inaudible.

He Ming's orderly had brought rain gear long ago and draped it on him as soon as it rained. He Ming didn't rush back to headquarters but asked: "Do the wounded have shelter?"

"Rain sheds and big tents have already been set up for the wounded."

The thunder gradually faded, but the rain became heavier and heavier. people and objects became unclear ten steps away. He Ming still inspected everywhere once, only walking down to return to headquarters after seeing every place was arranged properly. He instructed to send an officer escorted by the Special Reconnaissance Team to visit the two lurking infantry battalions.

The 1st and 4th Battalions responsible for ambush were both in the wild. Seeing the rain was so heavy, He Ming feared they couldn't camp in the wild or might even encounter danger of flash floods.

"Tell them not only to pay attention to safety but also to concealment!" He Ming instructed the messenger, "Prevent enemy night raids."

However, both Battalion Commanders reported the current campsite was very safe; soldiers didn't encounter flooding and were resting.

The Chengmai gate tower was covered in gloomy clouds at this time. The fighting throughout the day showed that the Hair Bandits not only had sharp firearms but also extremely strong combat power. Although exact figures hadn't come out yet, total casualties exceeding two thousand were certain. This was already very serious for an army of more than twenty thousand. Morale in the entire Grand Camp was low. Many people feared being driven to fight Hair Bandits tomorrow and already harbored thoughts of fleeing. Only because of heavy rain and pitch-black darkness outside, large-scale flight didn't happen.

He Rubin ordered reliable troops to control roads and strategic passes while gathering generals for a meeting to comfort them, asking everyone not to be disheartened and wait for the decisive battle tomorrow. Zhao Ruyi also said some words asking generals to serve the country loyally. He also temporarily promoted a few generals, asking them to lead men and horses who lost their main generals. He also transferred those most heavily damaged units to station in the rear, replacing them with fresh men and horses on the front line.

He then ordered the beheading of a dozen routing soldiers captured by roving cavalry who attempted to flee to Qiongshan instead of returning to camp, displaying their heads to the whole camp. Following this awe of killing, he sent trusted private secretaries and generals to comfort the most unreliable transport troops and village braves, using both soft and hard tactics to demand they "work together with one heart." After handling all this, he returned to the big tent. Zhao Ruyi was sitting in the tent stroking his beard. He Rubin knew he looked calm but was actually very afraid inside.

"General Yinzhi, what are the odds of winning tomorrow's battle?" Zhao Ruyi asked.

"Only sixty or seventy percent!" He Rubin said, "Our army suffered a setback today; military morale wavered considerably. Hair Bandit morale is high..."

He didn't continue the rest of the words. People present were clear about the subtext: tomorrow's battle would likely result in more defeat than victory.

Zhao Ruyi coughed once and said: "Hair Bandit firearms are sharp and morale is high; our army absolutely cannot fight a wild field battle with them. In the student's opinion, it is better to dig deep trenches and build high walls to consume the Hair Bandits' sharpness."

He Rubin remained silent. This tactic was useful when dealing with ordinary enemies, or even against the Imperial Court's great enemy, the Eastern Barbarians (Manchus). The government army had many firearms and infantry; digging trenches and establishing stockades to defend firmly with firearms, as long as officers and soldiers were of one mind, they could generally hold. It was a good tactic.

But the Hair Bandits were different from any enemy the Ming army had fought. Even different from the Red-haired people who resembled Hair Bandits most. The enemy had cannons that shot farther and more accurately than them. Digging trenches to defend firmly would only lead to being slowly shelled by the enemy from a distance. The whole army's morale would collapse before the enemy attacked.

"Lord Zhao, Hair Bandit cannons are far superior to mine. If digging trenches to defend firmly, enemy cannons can reach me, but my cannons cannot reach the enemy. I am the fish and meat on the chopping block driven by others!"

Zhao Ruyi heard and found it indeed reasonable: "Only attacking again tomorrow, I fear..." He didn't continue, only sighed.

A private secretary said: "Your Excellency need not worry. No matter how far his cannons reach, he has to exit the stockade to deploy cannons. Enemy soldiers are few; relying only on sharp firearms, they may not dare to exit the stockade to deploy cannons."

At this time, Chang Qingyun interjected: "Your Excellency! The Hair Bandits frustrated our army slightly today; the soldiers must be lazy and generals arrogant, neglecting defense. Tonight heavy rain falls like pouring; enemy firearms absolutely cannot be used. Please send a brave general to recruit several hundred death-sworn soldiers with heavy gold, emulating the Snowy Night Raid on Caizhou; we will surely break the Hair Bandits greatly!"

He spoke decisively. He Rubin thought secretly: *A scholar's view!* In such heavy rain, sending several hundred people to grope in the dark was difficult enough, not to mention finding the direction accurately.

But Chang Qingyun's sentence "Heavy rain falls like pouring, firearms absolutely cannot be used" moved him. In his view, today's defeat was still due to the Hair Bandits' powerful firearms.

*It would be best if it rains tomorrow too.* He Rubin thought secretly.

Zhao Ruyi, however, took great interest in this proposal. Surrounding private secretaries and generals also thought there was a chance—they felt as long as Hair Bandits couldn't fire firearms, they were nothing special. Even if they couldn't break the bandits, making the enemy suffer a big loss and winning back a round was still possible.

"How is the rain outside?"

"Already turned slightly smaller." The junior officer who went out to check reported back.

He Rubin got up and stood on the city tower holding the railing to look. The Hair Bandit Grand Camp earthen dike a few *li* away was brightly lit with lanterns, obviously heavily guarded. Hoping to steal the camp was impossible. But if enemy firearms couldn't be used, fighting with white blades might offer a chance for a small victory.

*Now the rain is small.* He Rubin thought. *If sending men to raid the camp immediately succeeds, taking the opportunity to rout the Hair Bandit whole army would completely reverse the war situation. If the stockade cannot be broken, a small victory can also boost morale.*

So he immediately sent people to find other generals to discuss the camp raid. Everyone thought: after the failed attack today, the Hair Bandits would absolutely not expect the Ming army to raid the camp, let alone during heavy rain. Although moving in the rainy night was inconvenient, this danger was shared by friend and foe. If Hair Bandits couldn't use firearms, they could only fight a chaotic battle. The government soldiers' skill in white blade stabbing could be displayed. Perhaps routing the Hair Bandits was not impossible.

Immediately it was decided that five hundred men of He Rubin's Town Standard would be the vanguard to brave the rain and seize the ascent. Huezhou Regional Commander Yan Zungao would lead one thousand men to support. If the attack on the stockade went smoothly, fireworks would be the signal, and He Rubin would personally lead the main force to attack fiercely afterward.

Yan Zungao let everyone eat a full meal, then rolled up flags and silenced drums, moving quietly to the front camp. To facilitate movement in the muddy ground on a rainy day, the five hundred first ascenders took off their armor and didn't bring long spears, only carrying podao (curve-bladed sabers) and small shields. In addition, many light ladders were prepared. All soldiers' shoes were wrapped with straw ropes in several places to avoid slipping and being unable to apply force when climbing. After all units assembled, they set off immediately braving the rain. Town Standard Central Army Garrison Commander, Guerrilla Ye Zhengfang led elite soldiers in front. Yan Zungao led a few guerrillas leading one thousand men ready to support. He ordered everyone not to raise fire or make noise, running quickly towards the enemy camp silently in the rainy night.

He Rubin also quietly prepared two thousand men, ready to lead the main force to attack fiercely and break the stockade in one fell swoop once the night raid succeeded.

Ye Zhengfang led men and horses quietly for several *li*. Only the brushing sound of rain was heard in his ears. Although there were lights on the earthen dike, it was pitch black all around. He secretly rejoiced that the enemy's bright lights meant the enemy was in the light and our army in the dark, also pointing out the direction for the attacking team. Otherwise, finding the correct direction in the dark, lampless rainy field would be almost impossible.

Seeing the whole army had quietly groped to the bottom of the earthen dike and follow-up men and horses also came up, Ye Zhengfang couldn't help being overjoyed. During the day, thousands of men and horses left countless corpses to break through this distance. Now they actually groped to the bottom of the earthen dike without losing a single soldier. It seemed the Hair Bandits were indeed slack! He listened quietly for a moment; there was still no movement on the earthen dike, only the hissing sound of torches burning in the rain.

"Set up ladders!" He ordered in a low voice. More than a dozen scaling ladders were erected slowly, leaning against the earthen dike.

The surroundings suddenly became snow-bright. In an instant, the government soldiers thought the sky turned bright in a flash. Just in the instant of their astonishment, a loud voice reached their ears:

"Fire!"

Volley fire swept through the government soldiers preparing to raid the stockade between bastions in an instant. Intense light beams shone on the government soldiers under the earthen dike, making them dizzy and dazzled. The light of strong stage searchlights swept through the dense rain, making everything around become glaringly white. The stunned government soldiers couldn't even identify the direction to flee for a time, dying under volley fire one after another.

"Go!" Ye Zhengfang was still in shock, knowing the Hair Bandits had long taken precautions and daring not stay longer. With a gong sound, government soldiers competed to flee. The white light beams on the earthen dike followed the defeated soldiers closely. Government soldiers were in great chaos for a time, trampling each other in front of the trench, causing many casualties. Fortunately, Yan Zungao's unit behind hadn't crossed the trench yet. Seeing light columns shooting everywhere, they thought the Hair Bandits used some sorcery. Then guns roared. Yan Zungao knew the so-called "firearms are useless in rainy days" was not a truth for Hair Bandits.

Hair Bandit bird guns roared in the heavy rain, but government soldier bows and arrows were hard to use in rainy weather. The one thousand men and horses Yan Zungao brought could neither attack nor support/cover. Seeing white light columns shaking wildly, crossing the trench to shine into his men and horses, before he could order, a chaotic volley was fired, and government soldiers waiting to cross the trench fell in a batch instantly. Others dispersed in a hubbub immediately. Yan Zungao himself was also clustered by personal soldiers and fled.

Ye Zhengfang fought his way out in the chaos under the protection of personal soldiers and officers. He escaped across the trench with great difficulty. At this time, the volley fire on the earthen dike stopped, only hearing a voice like a huge roar shouting:

"People below listen! Drop swords and spears! Strip off clothes! Squat down with hands on heads! Otherwise, no one will be left!"

The chaotic government soldiers had long been dazzled by searchlights and scared out of their wits by volley fire. They hurriedly dropped weapons in hand one by one, squatting under the earthen dike with hands raised high, daring not look up.

An officer saw he was at the edge of the light column, so he moved a few steps quietly, attempting to hide in the darkness. A gunshot immediately rang out on the earthen dike, instantly killing him on the open ground. Seeing this, who else dared to move half an inch? Everyone dared not move anymore.

Three ladders were lowered from the earthen dike.

"Team of ten, climb up team by team. If there are wounded, bring them up without exception!"

Stripped stark naked, the government soldiers shivered all over from the heavy rain. A small officer shouted: "Make it convenient up there, lower a few more ladders. Brothers have no cover up and down; this rain is cold..."

"Sending troops and horses to serve the Court, paying attention to loyal service to the country. Not afraid of death, yet you are afraid of catching a cold?" Someone on the earthen dike answered with a laugh.

"Fart 'Loyal Service'! Daddy is here to eat rations and get paid," The small officer saw someone answering above, and his soldier ruffian nature acted up again, "Although everyone serves their own master and swords have no eyes, seeing that we are all wearing uniforms and eating rations, make an exception!"

"Easy to say! Brother has big guts, may I ask your great name?"

"Dare not, small surname is Jiang, humble name Yougong."

"Good, lowering two more ladders right now."

So the surrendered soldiers climbed up shivering in teams of ten along these five ladders. Infantry above supervised with loaded guns. Militia prepared bundles of ropes. Once captives came up, their right arms were tied; ten people tied in a string were then escorted down. Seeing the government soldiers naked, exposing balls and butts, looking miserable being drenched by heavy rain, soldiers and militia couldn't help laughing. The laughter became louder and louder, penetrating the rain curtain and reaching the government soldier Grand Camp. The government soldiers who suffered a setback during the day heard gunshots but didn't know why Hair Bandits laughed like this, and dared not ask, only discussing quietly in the dark. Many middle and low-ranking officers and soldiers realized this expedition against bandits was a complete failure; at least no chance of winning could be seen.

Teams strung in tens were escorted by bayonets team by team to settle in the POW camp in a corner of the stockade. Many bonfires were lit in bamboo sheds, but clothes were not issued, only letting captives warm themselves by the fire. Wounded were carried away for treatment after simple diagnosis—serious ones.

Jiang Yougong shivered while roasting by the fire. He saw the place detaining them was very simple, exactly a corner of the Grand Camp. Two sides were earthen dikes, the other two sides had ditches dug, filled with sharp bamboo spikes. Lights were bright on all four sides. Hair Bandit soldiers on enemy towers held bird guns with bayonets shining, looking murderous at a glance.

Dozens of pitch-black iron buckets were carried over, steaming hot, and stacks of wooden bowls were also brought.

"Come, everyone take a bowl, prepare to drink soup!" The cook knocked on the iron bucket, shouting loudly.
