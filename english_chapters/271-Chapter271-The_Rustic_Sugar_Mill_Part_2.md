# Chapter 271: The Rustic Sugar Mill (Part Two)

But the color of this sugar appeared very dark—even darker than the ordinary brown sugar commonly seen, nearly what one would call "black sugar."

The liquid draining from the earthenware vat was blackish in color. Wen Tong knew this was "molasses"—during the boiling process, as the granulated sugar continuously crystallized out, what remained was this dark mother liquor. This mother liquor still contained a considerable amount of sugar, but there was no economical means of separating it out. It wouldn't be until after the 1970s that the sugar content could be recovered. Before then, molasses was simply a by-product subject to comprehensive utilization. One of its most promising uses was in distilling spirits—rum, for instance, was made from molasses.

The workers said what dripped down was called "*shaoshui* sugar." It could be further boiled into a type of black granulated sugar or used for making food products, but it was no longer suitable for external sale.

Wen Tong shook his head. This kind of black sugar wasn't worth making; its economic value was too low. Better to just distill liquor. He asked:

"Does anyone here make white sugar or rock candy?"

The workers all shook their heads. Liao Dahua translated, explaining that in Xuwen, Haikang, and other places, no one made white sugar or rock candy. All the sugar mills produced this kind of raw brown sugar. Some also made brick sugar. The method was to boil the cane juice to a paste following the same process as raw brown sugar, then pour it into a large iron pan and stir frequently with a wooden stick. Once crystallized, it was poured into a square frame and cut into blocks with a knife—that made brick sugar. Brick sugar was packaged in large bamboo baskets wrapped in dry cane leaves, fifty blocks per basket.

Wen Tong recalled that the true method for making white sugar had emerged precisely in the late Ming Dynasty, using the technique of filtering with yellow mud water. Technically, it wasn't difficult. Why had no one in this area adopted it?

Wen Tong reviewed the entire sugar-making process in his mind. This sugar mill produced approximately 100 kilograms of raw brown sugar per day. The scale was pitifully small. Moreover, watching the operation just now, although the stoker leading the work was very familiar with the overall production flow, he clearly lacked experience in the actual operations. Whether it was the intensity of the fire, the timing for drawing off the sugar, or the quantity of lime to add, he seemed hesitant. The quality of the sugar produced was obviously not high. And because the stove's construction was crude, the fire was hard to regulate. Several pots of sugar syrup had been scorched. After adding lime, the sediment wasn't fully filtered before being poured out, resulting in a significant loss of sugar. There was still considerable room for improvement here.

While he was deep in thought, someone brought over several cane farmers from the vicinity. Wen Tong inquired about their situations one by one. These farmers' planting areas were all very small—the smallest only ten-odd *mu*, the largest just thirty or forty *mu*. According to them, each *mu* yielded a little over three *shi* of sugar. After growing and harvesting sugarcane, they brought it here for processing. The sugar mill used a sharecropping arrangement for toll processing: the mill took four parts, the cane farmer took six. In some places, farmers paid a fee for processing and kept all the product—when calculated, the costs were about the same either way.

As for where the finished sugar went, according to the farmers, whether it was the mill's own product or the farmers' share, most of it ended up being transported to Hai'an Street in Haikang, where it was purchased by sugar hongs. These hongs were mostly opened by merchants from Chaozhou and Guangzhou who had flocked here specifically to engage in the export of raw sugar. Pack after pack of sugar was loaded onto ships at Hai'an Port and shipped out.

"How much net profit do you make growing sugarcane like this?" Wen Tong was curious.

"About six or seven thousand *wen* per *mu*," one of the farmers said. "The taxes are quite heavy, but the returns are still decent. The trouble is the interest rate is high. After paying back principal and interest, there's barely anything left."

"Interest?" Wen Tong found this strange. Did growing sugarcane require taking on debt?

"Your Honor wouldn't know the hardships of us farmers." The cane farmer smiled bitterly. "Although growing sugarcane returns aren't small, it consumes a lot of water and fertilizer. Buying fertilizer alone is a major expense. If the sky doesn't send rain, we have to hire people to irrigate. When it's time to harvest the cane, we have to hire laborers again. Even the smallest plot costs at least four or five thousand *wen*. Country folk don't have ready cash, so we have to go borrow."

The loan interest was fifteen to twenty percent—seemingly not that high. But after the sugar was processed, it had to be split with the creditor. In this way, the profit was cut in half out of thin air. Both Wen Tong and Chang Shide felt this usury was truly ruthless.

"I understand." Wen Tong nodded. "I'm the new owner here, so I should give everyone some benefits. This crushing season, anyone who brings sugarcane to me for processing will only be charged three parts."

"Thank you, Shopkeeper, for your kindness!" The cane farmers were so grateful they nearly fell to their knees to kowtow. This was essentially waiving one part—every household would be able to keep considerably more money.

After sending everyone off, Wen Tong returned to the hall. Liao Dahua and the others followed closely behind.

"Manager Liao, you're the manager of the branch here. I've been taking up your time for days now. The Haikang branch—" Wen Tong felt apologetic.

"It's nothing, nothing," Liao Dahua quickly said. "The Haikang branch was opened precisely for Manager Guo's sake in the first place. Anything the old gentleman instructs, this humble one naturally devotes his full effort to." Although he was the manager of the Qiwei branch, he wasn't actually a martial escort. He was originally a bankrupt petty merchant. The Qiwei branch in Leizhou wasn't intended for escort work but to assist Manager Guo in commerce—someone like him was perfectly suited to run it.

"The old gentleman." Wen Tong thought Guo Yi really was quite full of himself these days. He said, "Right now there's no one here. We need to hire people to help. We need a foreman for the long-term laborers, and we need to hire a master sugar-boiler. These are pressing matters. We're strangers here with no local knowledge, so I'll have to trouble you."

Although he'd already identified many flaws in the process, technical improvements couldn't be accomplished in a day or two. They required not only equipment but also modifications to basic facilities. Right now, he simply didn't have time for that. With the crushing season about to begin, for the time being it was best to follow established practices and get sugar produced as quickly as possible.

"Easy, easy." Liao Dahua nodded repeatedly. "Leave it all to this humble one. I'll have it sorted within three days."

"Don't worry too much about wages. We need people right now. Also, if you can recruit long-term workers, or if anyone is selling themselves into service, select honest and reliable people and take them all in."

"Yes." He stepped forward and lowered his voice. "If there are suitable young women, should we buy a few to attend to Shopkeeper Wen and Master Chang's daily needs? Right now, Guangzhou only sent two rough maids. They're heavy-handed and clumsy—probably not good enough to serve you two properly."

"Good, good," Chang Shide quickly said. "Not too young, and not too skinny either."

Wen Tong gave him an awkward look. This guy was way too eager. It wasn't that he didn't have such thoughts himself—the Executive Committee had authorized them to recruit and employ indigenous people locally. But to be so eager to find women right after arriving would look bad if word got back.

"I think we should hold off on that," Wen Tong said. "We've just arrived in Leizhou. We still need to visit various places, which might take several weeks. Buying a maidservant for the journey would be troublesome. It's more convenient to have those two servant boys accompany us." The two servant boys standing nearby, upon hearing this, both blushed red and stood mute.

Liao Dahua paused, his eyes sweeping the room. Suddenly, it dawned on him:

"Yes, yes, this humble one spoke out of turn."

Neither of the two men understood what he had "suddenly realized," but there was too much to do now, so they didn't pursue it. By now, it was getting late. Liao Dahua and the others took their leave and withdrew. The escort guards he'd brought were all stationed around the estate for protection. Liao Dahua didn't dare let down his guard—Xuwen had the most chaotic public order in all of Leizhou Prefecture, with all manner of bandits running rampant. Sugarcane estates and sugar mills with relatively more property were all targets for robbery. Zhou Shizhai and Li Biao stayed in the outer room of their quarters, ready to respond at any moment.

That evening, the two maids sent from Guangzhou came to pay their respects. Though not the burly, stout type, they looked thin and wizened but were in fact quite strong. First, they brought over newly made bathing tubs—deep and large. Then, in an endless stream, they carried in bucket after bucket of hot water and lots of soap beans. After traveling for two days through dust and wind, a good bath was exactly what was needed. Wen Tong immediately stripped naked and soaked in the hot water for a long while before climbing out. He sat on a bamboo stool and lathered himself with soap beans. Although the soap beans didn't spread smoothly, where they did touch the skin felt slippery and rich, with a subtle fragrance—much better than the soap issued by the office in Lingao.

"Old Chang, help me lather up," Wen Tong said to Chang Shide, who was soaking in the hot water with his eyes closed, enjoying himself.

"Have Wen Xiu and his brother do it. Aren't they our manservants? That's exactly what they're for. Just let me enjoy a bit longer." Chang Shide soaked in the hot water with an expression of utter bliss.

Wen Tong thought that made sense—plus he could get a back scrub while he was at it. So he called out loudly. Wen Xiu answered from the next room and immediately came in. He had changed into a short shirt and trousers and was barefoot.

"Your Honor truly has a strong body," Wen Xiu said while vigorously scrubbing his back.

"Hmph, him, with that skinny frame, strong? Look at my pecs—I don't swing that demon-head sword for nothing." Chang Shide splashed noisily.

Wen Xiu didn't dare speak further. Wen Tong said, "Who taught you Mandarin?"

"It was Steward Sun."

Wen Tong and Chang Shide had been told before departure that Steward Sun was Sun Chang, one of the main indigenous staff of the Guangzhou Station.

"Young Guo must have quite a few people under him over there."

Wen Xiu hesitated for a moment, unsure whether this "Young Guo" in the master's mouth was the same Manager Guo they revered almost like a deity. After a moment's hesitation, he answered:

"Yes, several dozen people at least." Wen Xiu scrubbed him diligently and thoroughly. "Everyone follows Steward Sun in learning Mandarin. Manager Guo says it's all to prepare for the masters coming in the future—"

Chang Shide chuckled several times: "Young Guo really knows how to get things done. We just arrived in Leizhou and the servants are all ready. Otherwise, we wouldn't even have anyone to order around who speaks the language." He yawned. "Today was really boring. It reminded me of watching folk performances. By the way, have you got any improvement plans for sugar-making?"

"There are improvements to be made, but there's no time for major changes right now. We'll just make do for now." Wen Tong signaled, and Wen Xiu scooped clean water from a nearby bucket to rinse him off. The warm water washing over his body was very pleasant. "Tomorrow I'll go down to the fields for a look, and then we need to visit the other estates and sugar mills to see their situations."

"Come, scrub my back too!" Chang Shide climbed out. His body was much more robust than Wen Tong's. Although he was a bit fat, he exercised often, and since D-Day he had done plenty of physical labor—his chest, abdomen, and thighs were all well-muscled. Wen Xiu looked at his body with a mix of awe and envy, and said with an ingratiating smile:

"Your Honor truly has a fine physique." And he began scrubbing his back.

"I'm thinking there are too many sugar mills. Why not just consolidate and shut some down, run a collective integrated factory? Bring all the sugarcane here for unified processing. Easier to scale up, and utilizing the bagasse would be simpler too."

"I've thought of that, but farmers all like processing nearby. Who'd want to travel far and wide just to sell sugarcane? Too much hassle. And the roads here are terrible," Wen Tong said. "Let's see how the sugarcane estates are distributed. If they're too spread out, the sugar industry in Leizhou is going nowhere."

The problems he was thinking about were actually far more complex. He had gotten a general picture of Leizhou's sugar industry today; what to do next would require further investigation. As for improvements, it was far more than just processing equipment and production processes. In the sugar mill, he had already examined the sugarcane used for juicing—it was actually bamboo cane. This was a variety of sugarcane native to China. Though it was a specialized sugar-making variety, its sugar content was still lower than that of "*Kunlun* cane"—even though the latter was actually a variety grown for chewing. Even in Leizhou, this favored land for sugarcane, bamboo cane's sugar content was only about 9%, far below the 14% standard common to modern sugar-producing varieties. From this perspective, there was great potential for improving cane varieties. The Agricultural Committee preserved seedlings of several superior sugarcane varieties, all of which could be tried here. As for field management, there was undoubtedly even more room for improvement.

"True— ah, ah, oh, that feels good. You've got some massage skills." Chang Shide, being attended to so comfortably, couldn't help letting out groans.

"We humble servants have learned the full set of skills for serving our masters." Wen Xiu massaged his back ingratiatingly.

"What if we did rough processing at each location and then centralized the brown sugar here for final processing into white sugar?"

"I've thought about that too, but we'll need to see the situations at each place first."

After they finished bathing, the maids came again to dump out the dirty water and tidy up the room. They took away the clothes they'd changed out of to wash. Before long, dinner was laid out. There was even liquor—Xuwen's local "*Xuwen Ye*," a rustic brew made from jackfruit. At the table, Liao Dahua and Zhou Shizhai served as dining companions. Both men had a token drink. Wen Tong wasn't much of a drinker anyway, so basically all the liquor ended up being consumed by Chang Shide. Although not drunk, he was quite tipsy. Wen Tong had no choice but to call Wen Xiu to help the fellow back to his room. He had originally wanted to discuss some matters with him in the evening, but now it seemed he'd just have to go to bed as soon as it got dark.
