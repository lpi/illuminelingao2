# Chapter 181: The Battle of Bopu (Part 1)

A piercing shriek filled the night sky, jolting the sleeping camp awake. This was the first time they had been roused by such an alarm.

What was happening? The contrast between the daytime victory celebrations and midnight's piercing alarm was too stark, and many couldn't process it immediately.

Chen Haiyang's roar blared from the loudspeakers: "Enemy attack! Enemy attack!"

After receiving Xue Ziliang's report, the Navy had raised the alert level from yellow to orange. All combat personnel assembled at key positions while patrols checked potential infiltration points.

The gunshot elevated the alert from orange to red. Combat status!

"Beach under attack! All personnel assemble at the Port Office!"

The quiet camp immediately stirred. People in disheveled clothing poured from the dormitories and barracks.

Groups of two or three sprinted toward the beacon tower, their footsteps mingling with the blaring loudspeakers to create an atmosphere of unprecedented tension.

At the office entrance, Ma Qianzhu issued his final orders.

"...You eight, get up the tower and help man the guns. Wang Ruixiang, take fire extinguishers to the dock to prevent enemy arson. Lin Shenhe is responsible for getting artillery there as fast as possible, by any means necessary. Everyone else arms up under Wu De's command. Hold all key points. The port is under martial law. Also, notify Bairen and all stations to go on alert. Keep all radios open. Now, move!"

Upon receiving Bopu's attack alert, the Communications Center immediately shut down all non-military channels to ensure military communication needs were met. Xi Yazhou ordered the Training Battalion to assemble and stand by.

"Notify the garage to prepare vehicles! We need to be ready to transport reinforcements." Xi Yazhou was yelling into his radio when he heard a roaring engine from the direction of the garage. A farm truck packed with people was speeding away.

"Who the hell is that?!"

"Looks like Dugu? All in black gear. Must be the Commerce and Industry Enforcement Team!"

"Who authorized him to use vehicles?" Xi Yazhou was about to lose it. He hated unauthorized actions. In this darkness, though only 12 kilometers, if the enemy had set up something on the road—nobody could guarantee the three gun towers were impenetrable.

Dugu Qiuhun, upon hearing the attack news, had grabbed whoever he could find near East Gate. His enforcement team had scattered after dinner, impossible to reassemble quickly. He grabbed every male he saw, handed them a machete, and ordered assembly at the Commerce Bureau building. But most people had returned to dormitories. Around East Gate, including himself, only about ten.

He quickly retrieved his private stash from the Commerce Bureau warehouse. He'd begged Planning Committee for this equipment, which they'd given partly because it came through his channels.

A team in black stab-resistant vests stood in the Commerce Bureau courtyard. Dugu Qiuhun was similarly dressed: crew cut, prominent brow ridge, cold eyes.

"Comrades!" He addressed the dozen drowsy men with serious face. "Bopu is under enemy attack. That's our vital base and foundation. Now we go to defend the Sacred Ship, to defend the Great Transmigration!"

"We have guns in our dormitory. Let me get them..." Someone wanted weapons.

Per the post-First Anti-Encirclement defense plan, each dormitory had at least one weapon for training and emergency armament.

"No time!" Dugu Qiuhun's face was stern. "The Great Transmigration is in peril. Now, move! Let this spacetime see the name that once made men tremble!"

He turned toward the exit. Ten team members immediately followed. Their backs bore two large red characters.

He told Dongmen Chuiyu, who'd just stumbled out of bed dragging a pump-action shotgun: "Dongmen, this place is yours!"

"Don't worry." Dongmen was startled by Dugu's fanatically serious eyes. Had excitement driven him crazy?

Dongmen Chuiyu kicked and punched the hiding police officers awake, ordering them to ready sabers and shields for melee. Then Mu Min arrived hurriedly with a pistol. Ming Lang followed with an unhappy face—finally a night off with his wife, hoping for early rest, talk about life, discuss ideals and feelings...

"You lead the police on guard. I'll go to the roof to look." Dongmen climbed the Commerce Bureau roof, peering toward the beach. Unfortunately, he saw nothing. But he heard the situation ahead wasn't good. He muttered: "Bunch of know-it-alls. If they'd prepared per the battle plan, we wouldn't be this passive. Almost every enemy attack catches us off guard. One victory doesn't guarantee the next."

Moonlight through trees cast mottled shadows on the camp with extinguished bonfires. Deliberately muffled coughs came from lightless tents. Despite softened footsteps, patrol sounds echoed louder. Faint gunfire came from the beach.

Life's hard for little people, Tan Ming thought. Not just pulling guard duty—orange alert meant patrol duty with his brothers. In this pitch-black night, if they actually fought hand-to-hand, his legs might shake.

Then came soft crackling from the tree grove at the camp's corner—sounded like snapping branches. Tan Ming straightened, signaling his hidden brothers that something was wrong, then led four marines as quietly as possible toward the sound.

A curly-haired, high-nosed face suddenly appeared before him! The trees had grown a face!

"Damn!" He raised his gun and fired.

*BANG!* With the massive report, the pirate's half-uttered yell died in his throat. Tan Ming dove into the nearest fortification, clear of friendly fire lines. Behind him, gunfire erupted from both camp and trees. Bullets whistled through foliage, some kicking up dirt nearby. Pirates burst from the trees with wild cries, charging the camp. Three native subordinates scattered immediately—fresh conscripts were useless. One more lay face-up on the ground, hit by someone. Count it as pirate casualty.

Hands trembling, he loaded his pistol and fired at the pirate mob. Though he missed, he steadied considerably. Shoot, reload, shoot... Tracer rounds from the camp streaked red toward the pirates, giving Tan Ming a fireworks-show sensation.

The pirates' first infiltration of Lingao Point was quickly repulsed. Semiautomatic rifle fire was obviously more than they could handle. But this didn't relieve transmigrator pressure. Fire flashed from the bay—*Countess of Scarborough* had opened fire. Shells screamed, splashing at Lingao Point's edge, throwing up water columns.

"Quick, retreat!" Li Haiping's voice came over radio. He was camp commander.

Several transmigrators led marines sprinting away. The entire Lingao Point was within this big ship's range. Defending meant suicide.

In the muzzle flash, Aragonés watched with satisfaction as dozens of people fled. Landing pirates rushed from trees in pursuit. No matter how powerful those muskets, could they match 24-pounder cannons? Aragonés smugly ordered the rowboats forward. The ship maintained parallel orientation to Lingao Point, continuously belching flame and smoke.

In the chaos, a brilliant beam of light slashed down like a sword from the beacon tower. After sweeping the sea several times, it locked firmly onto the Spanish galleon.

*Countess of Scarborough* drifted slowly in the light beam, like an elegant noblewoman.

"Fire!" Li Di had no time to admire.

The tower's 12-pounder cannon roared. The shell splashed beside *Countess of Scarborough*. Then other completed emplacements and hastily positioned shore guns opened fire one after another.

"God! This is Devil's sorcery!" When the brilliant light grasped the Spanish galleon, Aragonés howled in despair. How could blazing light like Castile's hottest summer sun appear at midnight? Several sailors, trying to find the light source, were blinded, rolling in agony on the deck.

"Get the priest up here!" he bellowed.

The ship had no priest, of course. But an old soldier named González knew Bible passages and could draw crosses for healing—the ship's only religious "talent."

This Spanish "holy man" was summoned from below. Obviously, he lacked confidence in his faith. Trembling, he fished out a cross. Before he could begin recitation, a 12-pounder shell hit the deck. Shrapnel flew. Several sailors fell screaming. González vanished instantly.

As if to quell the fear, *Countess of Scarborough*'s guns all opened fire. Shells striking stone sprayed fragments dancing through air—more terrifying than cannonballs. The coastal positions on Lingao Point were abandoned. Though pirates had suffered heavily in the first fight, they now surged forward regardless of death.

"Distance 100 meters! Canister!" Lin Shenhe's shout came from the earthwork in darkness.

*BOOM!* Fire flashed. A 12-pounder mountain howitzer spewed a long tongue of flame and hundreds of iron balls. Recoil sent it jumping, tumbling off the earthwork. Pirates who'd reached the beach instantly lost half their number.

"Quick, get it back up!"

The improvised gun crew quickly righted the fallen howitzer, scrambling to push it back up. This gun's durability was genuine—completely undamaged.

"75 meters! Double canister!"

Searchlights on camp watchtowers all blazed on. Though these stage and decorative lights couldn't match antiaircraft searchlights, their brightness and range were terrifying enough. Pirates were dazzled. Double canister rounds firing continuously from earthworks swept through the crowd like death's net, reaping lives. Pirates routed again from Lingao Point. Some fled to shore and jumped in, hoping to reach boats. Others panicked into the nearby mangroves. Camp fire followed—leaves and branches flew as bullets and shells tore through.
