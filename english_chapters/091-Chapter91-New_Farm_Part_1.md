# Chapter 91: New Farm (Part 1)

Traveler meals since D-Day had been rice plus seafood. After a month of every imaginable seafood preparation, few remained interested. Even Wu De's original seafood rice—after two weeks, even he found it extremely boring. Though he'd later spearheaded food improvements—smoked fish, fish sauce, fish cakes—some required long maturation; others lacked necessary seasonings. They'd remembered to bring enough salt but had removed soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, cooking wine, and spices from reserves. Many thought these were low-tech products they could easily manufacture, grow, or purchase after crossing. They'd forgotten these things weren't immediately available—yet they needed to eat daily.

Result: whether smoked fish or fish cakes, all tasted weird, hard to get excited about. Sometimes the Cafeteria Office improved meals using reserve canned goods—but quantities were tiny relative to the population. One luncheon-meat can for two people would be sickening; one can for ten meant almost no one got any.

One day, Wu Nanhai furtively brought Wu De a smoked sausage. In another timespace, he wouldn't have glanced at this—now it seemed incredibly delicious. Though it lacked even pepper, just garlic. Wu Nanhai repeatedly urged secrecy, especially from Nick—this was horse-meat sausage made from his "Blue Lightning." The Australian racehorse's remains had been quietly embezzled as Agriculture Group's private stash. Nick's occasional pilgrimage to the racehorse's grave found it empty—even bones had been secretly collected. Wu Nanhai planned to make bone-meal fertilizer.

The dead horses dragged back after defeating the "First Counter-Encirclement"—after the *Lingao Express* started publishing, everyone called it that—became their first real meat improvement in over a month. The six pigs sent by local gentry became the cafeteria's rare delicacy.

But for Wu Nanhai's team, there was slight disappointment. These pigs were nothing like those from the other timespace—scrawny, with stiff bristles, somewhat wild-boar-like.

"Don't look down on them." Xiong Buyou, who'd driven the pigs over, gazed at the piglets while swallowing. "These are Lingao pigs—famous local specialty, always exported to Hong Kong. Know Lingao suckling pig? This breed—thin skin, small bones, tender meat, with a special aroma—"

His greedy wolf-like gaze roamed the piglets: "These are 13–14 *jin* each—perfect age. Roasted, they'll be plump and tender."

"No scheming. I was planning to raise piglets as breeding stock. Since you say this breed's so good, definitely keeping them."

"Slaughtering the big pigs?"

"Right—let everyone feast. I've consulted the Committee." Wu Nanhai eyed several pigs still obliviously rooting for food, unaware their end was near. "Originally wanted to kill two; Committee said if killing, kill all six big pigs. Rather than everyone getting just one small slice, let everyone eat their fill—call it a reward."

Wu Nanhai had already calculated uses for the gifts: 200 *jin* of low-alcohol rice wine—use as cooking wine or make into vinegar. The deer was a butchered carcass—make deer jerky. Easy method; though lacking spices, boiling in salt water then drying tasted decent, portable, long-lasting. Sadly the deer came pre-butchered—no hide or organs. One cow was a yellow cow female—insufficient draft power for southern paddies but useful as future beef/dairy local broodstock. Six big pigs were market-weight meat pigs—no use as breeders. Though fattening potential remained, without feed they'd lose weight; might as well slaughter.

For utilizing these pigs, many plans emerged: belly and ribs all became braised pork. Pig-head meat would be braised—though lacking spices for now, stored with premium cuts like loin and tenderloin in a refrigerator salvaged from the *Fengcheng*'s galley. Trotters and small ribs for soup; leg and shoulder meat for ground meat; all fat rendered for lard; cracklings for stir-fry; bones for broth. Brains and spinal cord separately extracted. Blood and edible organs all became delicacies. Inedible parts—pancreas, bladder, gallbladder, spleen—had other uses; frozen for now. Even skin would be fried into pork rinds. Wu Nanhai desperately wanted food complaints to pause for a few days. Truly inedible waste went to him for drying into feed powder.

This comprehensive utilization plan hit one big problem—no one knew how to slaughter pigs. For transmigrators, pigs meant red meat on market boards or in supermarket freezers. How to turn live pigs into pork became an unsolvable mystery.

Wu Nanhai summoned Yang Baogui. Having successfully butchered and sectioned several dead horses for the Cafeteria Office, everyone naturally assumed he could handle pig-slaughtering. But the veterinarian shook his head—taking a pig's life was easy, but slaughtering was skilled work. Done wrong, you'd ruin the meat. He cited the EU example: to implement animal humanitarianism, the EU had changed centuries-old slaughter methods to humane electrocution—now EU pork tasted terrible.

Finally Military Group veterans solved it: what military company didn't raise pigs? Come New Year's feast, their own mess squads organized slaughtering. Some had helped in mess halls. Several veterans rolled up sleeves, boiled big pots of water, and killed all the pigs efficiently.

Yang Baogui and Shi Niaoren formed an inspection team, performing on-site quarantine. These pigs were reasonably healthy—no serious parasitic infections—but they advised cooking all meat thoroughly.

That evening, the cafeteria cooked several huge pots of braised pork. Seasoned only with salt and soy sauce—very poor solid soy sauce—and cooking wine, the braised pork earned unanimous praise. Even weight-conscious women who usually avoided meat joined the clamoring. Wu Nanhai saw someone cry while eating.

"Meat is best." This was the unanimous conclusion of transmigrators who'd eaten nearly two months of seafood.

But those pots of braised pork exhausted the last soy sauce from the ship's galley. Wu Nanhai planned to find somewhere to buy soy sauce and seasonings—he had fermentation cultures. But the Agriculture Committee now had too much to do.

As the entire industrial center shifted toward Bairren Rapids, various supporting facilities were completed. The Agriculture Committee's equipment also needed moving to Bairren Fortress. Wu Nanhai traveled daily between locations, organizing and transporting goods. Though a Committee member, he rarely commandeered the Beijing 212—usually hitching rides on farm trucks between sites. After moving, only one Cafeteria Office person remained at Bopu guarding the canteen, plus Chen Haiyang—former navy, now fisherman—managing the Fishery Production Group. Chen Haiyang had submitted a report to the Committee: requesting to establish a navy around the Fishery Group's current ships and personnel, with fishing as sideline. Bopu camp could be managed by the navy; future maritime trade and shipbuilding could also be navy-managed.

*Navy!* Wu Nanhai thought. Eating problems still unsolved, and someone's already proposing a navy. Seeing his tent of over a month being dismantled made him sentimental. He tossed the nylon nets Wu De had given him onto the farm truck. Wu De the fisherman was now happily running his labor-reform squad, daily tormenting natives—work and brainwashing. Had he stayed in the Fishery Group, would Chen Haiyang have suddenly proposed a navy?

This farm truck had a long string of two-wheeled carts—militia's abandoned vehicles—hitched behind, loaded with Agriculture Group's belongings: small tools, irrigation equipment, sprayers, complete agricultural experimental equipment, veterinary instruments, seeds, cages of chickens, ducks, and rabbits... Farm trucks were becoming trains here. He didn't know much about vehicles, but surely this couldn't be right. During difficulties, they'd make do—hopefully the truck held up until everything was transported.

Yang Baogui waved a homemade whip, directing his six dogs running front and back, driving the newly formed marching column: several pigs, a pair of donkeys, three horses. These large animals didn't get vehicle rides—they'd walk to their new home. These breeding animals were precious; the Military Group sent seven or eight escorts.

"Old Yang, hard work." Wu Nanhai walked to his side. "Let's walk together." Livestock farming wasn't his specialty; he wanted to chat with the veterinarian.

"It's far—over ten kilometers. Can your body handle it?" Yang Baogui eyed his somewhat pudgy frame.

"What's that supposed to mean? I'm younger than you." This dark-skinned man with black-framed resin glasses looked at least 37 or 38.

"I'm a vet—a rural vet. Walking over ten kilometers daily is nothing. Though there are village-to-village roads now, there's always only one vehicle—and it's always driven by someone who's not making house calls." Yang Baogui shook his flat-topped crew cut. Wu Nanhai noticed his glasses arms were tied with string around his neck—just like himself. This shared trait greatly increased his fondness.
