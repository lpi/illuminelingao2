# Chapter 1284 Resolution

Ma Qianzhu asked: "How much information do we have on Black?"

"According to Rando, Black was temporarily found by Paul to help. Rando believes he has engaged in arms dealing and worked as a mercenary or terrorist." Xu Ke answered, "It is said that this person is very unfriendly."

"I'm done asking. Please continue." Ma Qianzhu said.

"According to the confession of the captives, when Mr. Paul first arrived, he offered to cooperate with the Zheng family to set up a munitions workshop on Gulangyu. For this purpose, he demonstrated several firearm samples to the Zheng family—the demonstration was confidential, and the captives didn't know what the heads of the Zheng family saw, but after this demonstration, the Zheng family's attitude towards him underwent earth-shaking changes. It was likely some kind of weapon with subversive effects."

"I have a question," Qian Shuiting raised an objection, "Just now, several pieces of equipment surpassing average level of this spacetime were displayed in the PPT. I think this is quite incredible. You know that we were able to build such a scale of industry because we were prepared in terms of manpower and materials. If Black is an individual, how can he have such great ability?"

"I have consulted several Senators in the Manufacturing Supervision Department on this issue, and the answer they gave me is this," Xu Ke took out a document and read: "judging solely from the photos of items and buildings currently submitted to us for study, the technical content contained has certain advantages compared to the 17th century, but the overall application level is very crude. The materials and technological means used in constructing these items did not exceed the level of the 1630s."

"Do you mean Black's technology is relatively primitive?"

"Yes, the Senators in the Manufacturing Supervision Department indeed meant this." Xu Ke said, "I asked them to evaluate the topic 'whether a single person can do this', and the answer given was: Yes. The premise is that there are enough manpower and material resources at his disposal. Please allow me to continue reading some paragraphs:"

"In terms of technical level alone, the technical details required to realize windmills and reverberatory furnaces are not complicated, but in terms of the craftsmanship and material level of this spacetime, it is bound to require more manpower and material resources."

"So, Mr. Black himself is also an engineering and technical expert?" Qian Shuiting found it a bit incredible. For a "redneck" like him, he was already considered someone with strong hands-on ability in the US, but asking their brothers to build a Kentucky rifle using modern equipment was fine, but building a reverberatory furnace was obviously beyond their ability.

"Very likely." Xu Ke nodded, "Although we haven't been able to capture products that reflect his true technical level yet. judging solely from the materials we grasp, the things he organized manpower and material resources to manufacture should be far inferior to products manufactured under our industrial system, but they should have exceeded the technical level that this spacetime should have."

"Figuratively speaking, he can manufacture usable flintlock guns, but cannot make Minié rifles. Is that what it means?"

"Regarding this issue, the Senators in the industrial sector said this. Please allow me to read another relevant document." Xu Ke read, "Just in terms of manufacturing individual weapons, tools or equipment, we believe that this traveler, with cost-no-object investment, may produce Minié rifles, but he does not have the ability to mass-produce them—the safety and durability of such Minié rifles would also have significant problems..."

"Synthesizing the above analysis, we can draw a conclusion: Black did not die in the storm. On the contrary, he survived and transformed into a Japanese Christian, Mr. Paul, who is now opposing us."

There was silence in the venue for a while. Wen Desi asked: "Where is Black now?"

"We failed to obtain direct intelligence from the Zheng family, so it is currently unknown." As Xu Ke said this, he looked at Jiang Shan, and Jiang Shan nodded slightly. "But we have a conjecture."

"Go on."

Xu Ke paused and took a sip of water from his teacup.

"Not long ago, during our Operation Hunger against the Manila galleons, we discovered some situations that were quite contrary to routine—the Spaniards purchased large quantities of certain goods in the Americas that they did not purchase or rarely purchased in the past. Combined with the signs that Spain is recruiting Chinese craftsmen on a large scale through Macau, we believe that Manila is likely doing the same thing as the Zheng clique."

"You mean, the Spaniards are improving their armaments?" Director of Military Affairs He Ming asked.

Jiang Shan answered: "At present, we haven't obtained accurate intelligence in this regard, but based on existing circumstances, this possibility is very high."

"Do we have people in Manila?" Qian Shuiting asked.

"Rando is on his way to Manila and will arrive soon." Jiang Shan replied.

"Why send him?" Qian Shuiting asked.

"After Operation Hunger ended, we discovered the abnormal situation of the cargo on the ship. We sent him to understand the situation, hoping to establish a spy network in Manila. Senator Rando has some understanding of the situation in Manila, and he is a European—the Spaniards control the Chinese very strictly, so we don't have many choices." Qian Shuiting didn't ask further.

At this time, Zhao Manxiong asked: "That is to say, even if Rando didn't apply, we could only send him?"

"Yes, he is the most suitable candidate."

"This is a major threat to the Senate. Obviously, some things not recorded in history are happening there. The Spaniards are improving their weapons—we don't know what they want to do. This is very dangerous. We have to figure it out and discuss a countermeasure as soon as possible." Wen Desi concluded.

"We can only wait for Rando's first report."

"But if Xu Ke's inference is correct, then Rando's situation is quite dangerous. Black and Rando know each other: all the disguises we made for Rando will be exposed. Therefore, I prepare to suspend the Manila operation and withdraw Rando. We will make plans after further ascertaining the situation."

"Ascertain further? Who will verify it if no one goes? This isn't the 21st century where there are other reconnaissance means. Here, there is no other way except dispatching intelligence agents."

Jiang Shan retorted, "But this will put Rando in danger. After all, Black knows him. A traveler arms dealer turned into some Count Vannuova in a flash, driving a modern-style yacht. Black cannot be a fool. He knows what this means. He will kill Rando, then hide deeper, and it will be hard to find him again."

"Then let Rando be more low-key and don't be some Count. He is not 007."

"The circle of Europeans in Manila is very small. A newcomer will attract attention no matter what." Jiang Shan utilized the professional specialty of the External Intelligence Bureau.

Chen Haiyang spoke for the first time, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's cub? Fighting a war is dangerous, and intelligence work also has dangers. We can't say we won't do it because there is danger."

"But this is no longer danger; it is simply sending him to verify death."

"How could that be? didn't we say that whether Black is alive and whether he is in Manila are just speculations? Maybe the facts are not like this. Or maybe he is not in Manila." Chen Haiyang said.

"But if Black is there, then we are sending Rando to die. The discovery in Xiamen this time is very important, and I understand everyone's worries. But this is not a reason to take unnecessary risks. Once Rando is exposed, he won't give us any chance to rescue him at all. We can train a batch of Filipino indigenous agents, who will be able to collect local intelligence better. There are many difficulties, but there will always be a way. Every Senator is our precious wealth..." Jiang Shan summarized with an impassioned tone.

"Rando and Black came on the same boat back then, right?" Zhao Manxiong suddenly spoke up.

The conference room suddenly quieted down, and the temperature seemed to drop a few degrees.

"After witnessing the strength of the Senate, I don't believe Rando would make such a stupid choice." Jiang Shan said.

Wen Desi said: "Then let him fully prove his loyalty."

"I reiterate once more: This is a very dangerous operation, and Rando is very likely to lose his life because of this."

"So Director Jiang, your opinion is still to suspend the operation?"

"Yes, suspend the operation temporarily. Make the next decision after obtaining more intelligence, otherwise it may alert the enemy." Jiang Shan insisted on his proposal.

Zhao Manxiong cleared his throat gently: "Everyone, it is meaningless for us to get entangled in this issue here. Rando has been gone for many days. He is taking an ordinary merchant ship and doesn't have a radio. Even if we cancel the operation, we can't notify him. Even if we send a messenger on the 901 to chase him, it will be hard to catch up with him.

"Secondly, Rando's situation has its particularity. Subjecting him to some tests by the Senate is an option worth considering. Now there is a Black in Manila giving us headaches; we should still grasp the main point first. I think Rando's operation should continue, but we should make proper preparations. As the saying goes, don't put all your eggs in one basket. For this, it is necessary to prepare a Plan B. Send a second team to Manila to support him, ensure Rando's operation can succeed, or rescue him in case of failure."

Everyone nodded in agreement, and Zhao Manxiong continued: "I suggest that the External Intelligence Bureau continue to cover this work. You can ask the Executive Committee to use the Special Reconnaissance Team and Navy forces to support him."

"I have no objection." Wen Desi said, "Does anyone else have different opinions?"

Jiang Shan asked: "What if Rando is really a traitor?"

Wen Desi was silent for a moment: "If Rando betrays, we should take him to the Senate's special tribunal to accept trial according to the law."

The attendees felt that although this plan was not perfect, at least it took all aspects into account. No one raised an objection.

Wen Desi finally said, "No matter what is found in Manila, Black and everything he brought must be purified."
