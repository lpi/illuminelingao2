# Chapter 1279: Ownership and Shares

"Of course, we won't hire people to do it all—for such petty businesses, hiring people to do everything would make us lose our shirts." Wu Nanhai said, "I mean we act as the wholesaler, letting individual households get goods from us. For example, for those selling breakfast now, we can set up a food and beverage service enterprise ourselves, make breakfast and wholesale it to peddlers. There are also candied haws, popsicles, grass jelly, shaved ice, tofu pudding, cotton candy... We can also open larger chain restaurants ourselves, selling breakfast in the morning, box lunches at noon and evening, and cold drinks at other times—I think we should call it the Red Flower Society."

"Damn, then we have to set up another Iron Blood Youth League!" A cold light shot out of Ye Yuming's eyes as he spoke, "Old Wu, speaking of selling tofu pudding, do you like your tofu pudding sweet or salty?"

"Well, I prefer traditional flavors." Wu Nanhai feinted and changed the subject, "What do you think of my idea?"

"Good, but currently the Governor and the Planning Commission are not particularly in favor of engaging in individual small businesses. Although they didn't say it explicitly, I feel they don't wish for more manpower to flow into non-productive sectors..."

"We run this industry not to make money or anything, but mainly to provide more livelihoods for everyone. Increase social stability. Let more people support themselves—we can't let everyone enter factories or go down to the fields. The common people have demands for the tertiary industry, which is also a very important supplement to large-scale production! In the future, there will always be intermittent labor surplus that industry and agriculture cannot absorb, so we can be considered planning for a rainy day."

Ye Yuming nodded: "Can the Senate approve this?"

"There is no need for verify Senate approval." Wu Nanhai said, "Tiandihui is not a government agency, just an industry association under the guidance of the agricultural sector. At most, it is a public institution managed by reference to the Civil Servant Law. We just need to report to the Administration Council and have the Governor sign it."

"The problem is, is the Governor willing to approve it?"

"Have you read the latest issue of 'Weekly Updates'?" Wu Nanhai asked back.

"Haven't had time yet." Ye Yuming was a busy man.

"There is an article about the statistics and arrangement status of personnel disabled in the line of duty in the civil affairs system. It is unsigned, but I estimate it was written by Prefect Liu. Now there are quite a few indigenous people who have partially lost their labor ability after recovering from work injuries and war wounds."

In Lingao, there were no disabled people who had completely lost their labor ability—with their current medical and health level, such wounded people could not be saved at all.

Currently, these people were mainly placed in relatively simple auxiliary jobs, but this was not a long-term solution. Therefore, Wu Nanhai believed that the Red Flower Society form could be used to absorb some disabled people and allow them to support themselves.

"...We can give preferential treatment to this group of people regarding experience—Tiandihui can just charge the cost. Plus tax incentives. It should be enough to keep them and their families well-fed and clothed." A look of "worrying about the country and the people" appeared slightly on Wu Nanhai's face.

Ye Yuming nodded: In this way, it would be easier to pass in the Administration Council.

With the major matter settled, both people were relatively relaxed. Wu Nanhai made a gesture, asking the waiter to change to a pot of new Oolong tea. While pouring tea for Ye Yuming, he said:

"After this matter is settled, I intend to request the Senate at the plenary meeting to confirm the rights of the current shareholding, ownership, and dividend distribution methods..." Wu Nanhai continued, "We are now in a typical chaos of ownership..."

"I don't understand." Ye Yuming was stunned and didn't react for a moment.

"What kind of institution do you say our Senate is?"

"Of course, it's a parliament."

"The Senate is essentially the board of directors of the East India Company!" Wu Nanhai said, "We are actually running a country now, just like the relationship between the British East India Company and India back then!"

Ye Yuming felt very uncomfortable with this metaphor, but regarding the specific distribution of power, he admitted that it was indeed the case.

"Even so, isn't it said that all property under the Transmigration Group belongs to all Senators? But now our plate is getting bigger and bigger. We need diversified funding sources; secondly, it is not just Senators participating in building this new society. We must also fully consider their interests. Finally, for a company to run a country is inappropriate no matter what. So I think we must clarify responsibilities, rights, and interests starting now. The state of the Senate being the state should be changed. So I think it is necessary to conduct asset valuation of state-owned enterprises now and confirm ownership. Separate state ownership from Senate ownership so that we can calculate clear accounts in the future. Otherwise, it will be a messy account after a long time."

He took a breath, seeming unfinished: "Because of unclear responsibilities, rights, and interests, there is a series of questions that still have no specific answers, such as whether land can be privately owned, etc.—if these questions are not clarified, how can our institutional construction and legal construction continue?"

Ye Yuming said worriedly: "If you submit this proposal, will it be considered an intention to carve up the Senate's property? Everyone is already fearful about restructuring and the shareholding system."

"Adhering to state-owned enterprises as the mainstay is an unshakable purpose. I am worried now that the Senate and the state are confused, which will leave trouble for the future." Wu Nanhai was somewhat agitated, "If I really had that heart, I could just pretend to be confused. Anyway, 'state-owned' is 'Senate-owned'. The legal concepts for dividing family property are all ready-made. Only by distinguishing and clarifying now can we block people from using this name to carve up the Senate's property in the future!"

Ye Yuming was thoughtful: "Now that you say it, I also feel it's not quite appropriate." He continued, "There is also the issue of Senator share dividends, which is also a vague concept."

"Exactly!" Wu Nanhai nodded repeatedly, "The Senate is the Senate, the country is the country, they can no longer be confused. We are now typically indistinguishable between government and enterprise, with unclear responsibilities and rights."

Ye Yuming thought Wu Nanhai was very right. However, considering from a deeper level, if these things were not done in advance now, future generations of Senators would one day leave a reputation of "carving up state property". Future naturalized citizens would not harbor simple and sincere loyalty to the Senate because of gratitude for almost recreating them like current naturalized citizens. But with the improvement of productivity and the rise of living standards and cultural levels of the entire society, they would sooner or later "eat meat while holding the bowl, and curse mother after putting down the bowl". At that time, the glorious and correct image of the Senate would inevitably be destroyed.

Do not underestimate the glorious and correct image: since ancient times, what a government needs to maintain most is its legitimacy. Ancient monarchs all claimed divine right of kings, and modern countries all claimed to represent the interests of the country and the people. The new country established by the Senate naturally could not be an exception.

I wonder how many Senators have realized this? Ye Yuming thought with complex feelings.

The two discussed this issue for a while and wrote a few points of memorandum, talking until nearly ten o'clock before dispersing—this was already very late in Lingao.

When Wu Nanhai returned home, it was already 10:30 at night. Served by Chuqing, Wu Nanhai finished washing, changed into loose cotton pajamas, and sat in the living room. Chuqing also wore a long home nightgown. The electric light was on. Wu Nanhai opened the leather-bound Bible and said: "Come, today we will study Exodus, Chapter 20, Verses 1 to 17."

*********

"Worked hard for three and a half years, and overnight returned to pre-liberation," Li Yan said grinningly to Jiang Shan, holding a telegram just received in his hand.

"These words contradict the expression on your face." Jiang Shan put down the document in his hand and thought about various reports submitted by the Ming Dynasty Division recently, "What? Wu Mingjin got promoted?"

"Director Jiang indeed devises strategies within a command tent..." Li Yan nodded with a smile, "Exactly!"

According to the telegram sent from Guangzhou, Wu Mingjin had been promoted to General Judge of Leizhou because his term had expired and his performance assessment was outstanding.

Based on Wu Mingjin's performance assessment, he indeed deserved a promotion and transfer. The Senate and the Intelligence Bureau were not willing to let this excellent collaborator escape their control, so they linked him with the Tang Sanzang Plan.

The Tang Sanzang Plan had taken nearly three years from planning to now, and had always been one of the main tasks of the intelligence system—although as time passed, people within the Executive Committee and the Intelligence Bureau constantly questioned whether it was necessary to continue this plan. But the thought of being able to directly control a local official deep in the officialdom was still quite tempting for intelligence personnel.

However, during the planning stage, the candidates for "Tang Sanzang" changed repeatedly, although they always kept their eyes on down-and-out scholars. But they soon discovered: it was not difficult to get down-and-out scholars to defect to them, but it was difficult to get them to be spies. The psychological barrier was still very large.

Being a spy was always a dishonorable and under-the-table matter, let alone impersonating a court official! For many scholars, the orthodox status of the Ming Dynasty had not been completely broken.

Li Yan felt that instead of letting a poor scholar tremblingly impersonate the Prefect of Leizhou, it would be better to simply support a ready-made official to rise to the position. His idea was approved by Jiang Shan.

In the whole of Qiongzhou, there were quite a few minor Ming bureaucrats willing to cling to the Senate's lap. Wu Mingjin could only be considered the semi-compliant type. However, thanks to the Senate, his performance assessment was the best, and he was about to be transferred upon the expiration of his term, making him relatively suitable as a candidate.

The only drawback was that the Prefect of Leizhou was Rank 4 Primary, while Wu Mingjin was only Rank 7 Primary. Following the steps, he had to be appointed General Judge first, then Vice Prefect, and then could be Prefect. If he was just an assistant official like an auxiliary, it would be somewhat irrelevant to the Intelligence Bureau.

"Actually, we have a way to let him ascend quickly." Li Yan said at the discussion meeting, "Just sell 'Tang Sanzang' directly."
