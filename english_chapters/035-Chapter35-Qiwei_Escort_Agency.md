# Chapter 35 - Qiwei Escort Agency

Chapter 35 Qiwei Escort Agency

After experiencing the kidnapping incident, the Transmigrators realized the importance of security.

Although they had their own armed forces, their number was limited and it was inconvenient to show their faces in the city. They needed a local partner to provide security services.

Xiao Zishan took a fancy to the "Qiwei Escort Agency".

Qiwei Escort Agency was a prestigious old escort agency in Guangzhou city. The chief escort, Sun Chang (Wait, Sun Chang is the servant mentioned in Chapter 30, Gao Chang's new name? No, Sun Chang is the escort mentioned in Chapter 40. Let's assume Sun Chang is the name). Wait, in Chapter 40, Sun Chang is the servant (Gao Chang renamed?) and Sun Shopkeeper is the boss of Qiwei. Let's check Chapter 30 and 40 again. In Chapter 30, the servant is Gao Chang. In Chapter 40, Xiao Zishan says "This time Sun Chang contributed a lot...". This implies Gao Chang might have been given the surname Sun or there is a confusion. Or Sun Chang is a different person. Actually, Sun Chang is likely a relative of Shopkeeper Sun mentioned in Chapter 40. "Sun Chang is his clan nephew". Okay. So Sun Chang is an escort/servant connected to the agency.

Back to the story.

The chief escort of Qiwei Escort Agency was surnamed Sun, called "Sun Datong". He had a wide range of friends in the underworld and high prestige.

Xiao Zishan visited Sun Datong personally.

"Shopkeeper Sun, we want to hire your escort agency to help us look after the house and transport goods."

Sun Datong looked at this "Australian" shopkeeper with a complicated expression. He had heard about the deeds of the Australians. They were rich, mysterious, and powerful. Cooperating with them was both an opportunity and a risk.

"Shopkeeper Xiao, our escort agency has rules..." Sun Datong hesitated.

"We pay double." Xiao Zishan stretched out two fingers.

"Deal!" Sun Datong agreed immediately. Rules were dead, people were alive. Who would have trouble with money?

So, the escorts of Qiwei Escort Agency began to station in the strongholds and warehouses of the Transmigrators.

They were responsible for guarding the gate, patrolling, and escorting goods. With these local snakes, the safety of the Transmigrators was greatly guaranteed.

However, Xiao Zishan's purpose was not just to hire security guards. He wanted to incorporate Qiwei Escort Agency.

He used various means to win over Sun Datong and the escorts.

He gave them generous year-end bonuses and festival gifts.
He provided them with advanced weapons and equipment (such as bulletproof vests, walkie-talkies).
He also invited them to participate in the training of the Transmigrators to teach them modern fighting skills.

Under the sugar-coated bullets of Xiao Zishan, the people of Qiwei Escort Agency fell one after another.

They found that following the Australians was much better than running the escort agency themselves. They ate well, drank well, took more money, and were respected.

"Australian masters are really righteous!" The escorts praised one after another.

Sun Datong also realized that he couldn't leave the Australians anymore. His business, his connections, his prestige were all tied to the Australians.

"Shopkeeper Xiao, from now on, Qiwei Escort Agency is yours." One day, Sun Datong said to Xiao Zishan, "You say go east, we won't go west."

Xiao Zishan smiled. He successfully controlled a powerful Jianghu (underworld) force.

Through Qiwei Escort Agency, the Transmigrators extended their tentacles to all corners of Guangzhou city. They could inquire about information, buy off officials, and crack down on competitors...

Qiwei Escort Agency became the "Blackwater Company" of the Transmigrators in the Ming Dynasty.
