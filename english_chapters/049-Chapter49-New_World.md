# Chapter 49 - New World

Chapter 49 New World

When the sky turned slightly bright, the people on the Fengcheng ship began to walk around. Everything last night, especially the spectacular scene of the wormhole disappearing, became an endless topic for everyone. Most people didn't see this scene in the cabins, but there were quite a few DVs and digital photos that captured the picture.

The Executive Committee had not yet ordered to weigh anchor and sail, but everyone immediately discovered the first unexpected problem in the plan. The breakfast problem for so many people could not be solved - the kitchen on the ship was prepared for a scale of 40 crew members, but now there were 400 people on the Fengcheng alone. What was more terrible was that washing also became a problem. Long queues formed in front of the toilets. Some people who couldn't wait simply risked stepping onto the swaying small boat deck and excreted directly into the sea and high air.

"Commissioner Ma, this won't do!" Bei Wei, who was appointed as the leader of the landing reconnaissance team, was furious. He ran to the poop deck and shouted at Ma Qianzhu, who had just taken office as the landing commander-in-chief, "So many people's excrement will attract sharks! Landing like this is too dangerous."

Ma Qianzhu said helplessly: "Then what can I do? There are only 10 positions in the ship's toilets, and now 400 people need to use them."

"If you don't care, it will be hard to handle if an accident happens later! Sharks aside, everyone is climbing on that swaying small boat deck. If one falls down, there's no need to even fish him up."

While talking, Aunt Tian, who managed the cafeteria, walked in with a helpless face:

"Commissioner Ma, what do you say we should do? Everyone says they want to drink some porridge. I see the kitchen on the ship can't make porridge for four hundred people. It's too late..."

Ma Qianzhu had just been educated by Bei Wei, and now someone brought up the porridge problem. Seeing that several loopholes appeared before the landing plan even started, he became impatient: "You find Xiao Zishan for this matter. Isn't he your leader!"

"But aren't you the landing commander-in-chief? Things on this ship are all under your control."

Isn't it all caused by yourself! Now asking me what to do? Ma Qianzhu cursed secretly in his heart, but it was inconvenient to flare up - Aunt Tian was over fifty, following the Transmigrators to open up a new world regardless of life and death - he had to deal with it perfunctorily first, kicking the ball back: "Boil as much as you have first, distribute in batches. Having some is better than having none... You discuss with Zishan again."

Not boiling porridge for everyone was originally nothing: everyone had prepared dry food for two days. As long as the fresh water supply was maintained, gnawing on those energy bars could also cope with it.

The problem was that as soon as Aunt Tian saw a kitchen on the ship, she actually started cooking breakfast according to old habits regardless of anything. Before dawn, Li Yuanyuan of the General Affairs Group brought freshly cooked porridge and steamed buns to the Executive Committee members in the ship building with several girls. Each person also had a small dish of bagged pickles and a few fried peanuts.

Now Ma Qianzhu knew it was trouble. The masses do not worry about scarcity but about inequality. Why do you leaders eat hot porridge and buns, while we masses have to gnaw energy bars that taste like expired mooncake fillings with cold water? At the beginning of this cause, differential treatment was created. Once people's hearts scatter, the team will be hard to lead. So at this moment, the Executive Committee drank porridge secretly, and no one approached the porthole. He touched the phone: "Engine room? Turn the desalination equipment to the maximum. Fully guarantee the fresh water supply!"

"Fully guarantee, who are you?!" An indignant voice came from the phone, "The desalination equipment only has this supply volume. Are you asking us to piss fresh water out?" Ma Qianzhu recognized this voice as Xiao Bailang's. He studied mechanical processing and knew equipment installation and management, so he was assigned to follow the ship to learn engineering for three months.

No respect for leaders! Ma Qianzhu cursed secretly. You sissy, see if I don't sell you to Thailand! Venting in his heart, he thought staying here was useless, so he simply followed Bei Wei down to the deck.

Dong Shiye sat on the deck leaning against his backpack. His legs were soft when he came down from the small boat deck. Between his legs was the sea. One look was enough to make him dizzy. Fortunately, the ship had almost no ups and downs, calm and tranquil. The waning moon on the horizon was slowly fading. Looking at the masses queuing by the toilet cursing three-character classics, he felt the risk was still worth it.

No place to wash hands. Fortunately, he was prepared for these problems. He took out a disinfectant wipe and wiped - toilet paper, disinfectant wipes, water purification tablets, he brought a lot of these. Relying entirely on the organization was unreliable. He didn't take out a cup to brush his teeth either - many people on both sides of the ship kept posing as if singing loudly, and white foam hung dirty streaks on both sides of the hull, which was spectacular. He only used dental floss and a piece of chewing gum to clean his teeth. Try not to open the packed backpack, this was his principle.

The porridge supplied by the Executive Committee made the order a bit chaotic for a time. Dong Shiye didn't join in the fun - 4 big pots each time, only enough for 40 people, one bowl each. The waiting time was too long. He didn't go to gnaw the unpalatable energy bars either. He brought the PLA individual special rations. Gnawing compressed dry food and drinking some water was enough. Drinking porridge would require finding water to wash the plate later. If not washed, the plate would become a culture medium for bacterial growth.

Looking out from the ship, the coastline that was pitch black yesterday was now clearly distinguishable. Lingao should be a very maturely developed county, but this strip of coast seemed uninhabited.

The beach not far outside the side was very narrow, covered with black gravel, not feeling like the blue sea and silver sand of Hainan in impression at all. Behind was a low broken cliff. Due to earthquakes, the rock fracture cliff was cut into many gaps of different sizes and shapes. In some places, there were several gentle slopes leading to the top of the broken cliff.

Looking west, less than one nautical mile from the Fengcheng, there was a cape protruding from the land. That was probably the river mouth of Bopu Harbor. The cape was covered with many mangroves leaning towards the water surface. These mangroves were lush and green, almost covering the entire coastal area and extending into the water. If a botanist came to this place, he would definitely jump up happily - such a complete mangrove ecosystem is rarely seen in 21st century Hainan.

Dong Shiye suddenly discovered a strange phenomenon, that is, among these coastal trees, there was not a single coconut tree most common in Hainan! This surprised this old backpacker very much. Coconut trees are relatively easy to survive, visible everywhere on tropical and subtropical islands and coasts. He didn't know that Lingao locally indeed didn't have coconut trees originally - the coconut trees in 21st century Lingao were introduced successively after the 1930s of the last century.

On the beach, large flocks of seabirds with harsh calls were taking off and landing. Most of them were various different seagulls, and also loons. Obviously, such dense bird flocks are rarely seen in the 21st century. This wild feeling made his mood a bit depressed - this was still a place where humans rarely set foot.

A burst of noise outside the starboard of Fengcheng. The first landing reconnaissance team led by Bei Wei, carrying rifles and machetes, climbed down the gangway under the gaze of comrades and boarded the motorboat.

The landing reconnaissance team consisted of military personnel, engineering surveying personnel, and geological personnel. Their task was to investigate the terrain, hydrological data, and possible villages and water sources of the port and the coast for several kilometers. Equipped with walkie-talkies, self-defense weapons, 25X8 binoculars, surveying tools, and a 3-megapixel DV.

In order to cope with possible accidents, everyone wore stab-proof suits, camouflage uniforms and steel helmets. The Executive Committee originally intended to equip them with riot suits, but Bei Wei rejected it - although this thing has first-class protection effect, it is really a bit strenuous to move around wearing it.

"Pay attention to safety!" Ma Qianzhu said to Bei Wei at the gangway.

"Rest assured." Bei Wei turned and got on the motorboat.

"Tu tu..." The engine sound broke the tranquility of thousands of years hundreds of years earlier than in reality. The motorboat cut through the waves and drove quickly towards the looming coastline.

Bei Wei was the captain of the landing team, fully responsible for the safety of the landing. The order given to him by the landing command was to focus on collecting data and avoid armed conflict with locals. If people could be contacted, try to inquire about the local situation. For this reason, Xiong Buyou was specially arranged into the reconnaissance team - logically, this otaku from a comic company shouldn't appear in such a first batch of reconnaissance team, but he could speak Lingao dialect and was the translator in the team.

Lingao dialect is an anomaly in Hainan dialects. In modern Hainan, only people in Lingao, Danzhou and part of Chengmai use it. It is not only extremely different from Mandarin, but also completely different from the mainstream dialect of Hainan, Qiongzhou dialect. It is generally believed that this language has homology with the Zhuang language in Guangxi.

The difference in language made Lingao always a maverick existence in Hainan, with less communication with the outside world, and the social environment was quite closed.

Xiong Buyou originally intended to wear the chain mail he brought at the cost of luggage weight, but this thing was sternly rejected by Bei Wei - too heavy, stab-proof vest is more practical.

Because the positioning relying on the map would have a large error - although the equipped map is the largest scale map and topographic map of Lingao County. But after all, four hundred years separated them. It is hard to say how much accuracy the topography has. It is purely better than nothing. Therefore, Bei Wei decided not to approach the coast for the time being, but head directly towards the most significant terrain marker here - Lingao Cape.
