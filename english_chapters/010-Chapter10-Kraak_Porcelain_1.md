Chapter 10 Kraak Porcelain (1)

This evening, the three people who completed the first space-time journey held the first work summary meeting. Meeting minutes were taken according to the formal meeting process. According to Wen Desi: We are creating history.

At the meeting, various problems in the crossing were summarized and induced. The conclusion was: overly despised the wisdom of the ancients, homework was not done enough, knew too little about the Ming Dynasty, and components of taking things for granted were the majority.

Overall, luck was good, and they found a reasonably suitable agent quite smoothly.

As for the next step of the trade plan, although the prices were unexpectedly low, after careful calculation, the profit was not as low as imagined.

One tael of silver in the Ming Dynasty was about 37.3 grams. Although the purchase price of silver in this space-time fluctuated, it was no more than around 3 yuan per gram (selling price 3.6-3.8 yuan, purchase price 2-2.6 yuan, taking a slightly higher price). One tael of silver could get 112 yuan RMB. Actually counting the "meltage" cost - many silver circulating in the Ming Dynasty was not of high purity and needed to be re-melted, the revenue was even lower.

If one powder box could sell for ten taels, that means about 1000 yuan could be obtained. Xiao Zishan brought more than 200 powder boxes. Just this item could earn two thousand taels of silver, amounting to two hundred thousand yuan. Even if they had to purchase these powder boxes, the current wholesale price was only a few yuan each, and the cost could be almost ignored.

"Actually we can resell once more." Xiao Zishan scribbled with a pen for a long time, "I remember the gold-silver exchange ratio in the late Ming was roughly in the range of one to ten. For these two thousand taels of silver, we ask to exchange for gold. We can get two hundred taels, totaling 7460 grams. Calculated at 150 yuan per gram, that is more than one million. More profitable than selling goods."

"But generally speaking, the gold stock in society is limited, and we can't exchange much." Wang Luobin felt it was a pity.

"Actually we can ask for another thing as payment, which is more valuable than gold." Wen Desi said.

"What thing?"

"Porcelain." Wen Desi pointed to the Christie's auction announcement in the newspaper, "Ming Dynasty porcelain, I don't need to say more..."

When the servant ran to the study with a pale face, Master Gao knew that the three from Australia came again. This time it was late at night, and like last time, they appeared out of thin air from the warehouse courtyard.

If they hadn't come during the day last time, and left in broad daylight, Master Gao would really suspect they were some ghosts or monsters.

"Master Gao, these are the goods."

Under the corridor of the study, four or five paper boxes moved by the servants from the warehouse courtyard were piled up. It was the first time he saw boxes for goods made of paper, and his heart couldn't help thumping wildly. Although he had secretly poured chicken blood on those few samples a few days ago, and checked again the next day finding these things were still intact and didn't turn into earth lumps or wooden puppets, only then did he feel at ease.

"Steward Yan, count and make a list." Master Gao ordered his subordinate.

"Yes, Master."

The steward led the servants to open the paper boxes. Each item was wrapped in that exquisite paper box, stacked neatly. Master Gao nodded. These Australian merchants acted really extravagantly - just this packaging probably cost a lot of money.

The three sat on chairs, watching the servants of the Gao residence count. Under the dim candlelight, Master Gao's Nanjing satin robe shimmered slightly. Xiao Zishan inexplicably thought of burial clothes, and got goosebumps.

Fortunately, they had prepared a special gift. When the counting was finished, both sides checked the numbers one by one. Wen Desi opened a box and took out a kerosene lamp. This thing took them a lot of time to buy from a craft shop, 120 yuan, the most expensive of all things. Wen Desi took out a can of kerosene from the box, poured it in, lit a flame with a candle at hand. Not long after, the lamp flame became increasingly bright, and the originally dim study suddenly shone with great light.

Master Gao and the servant steward were all dumbfounded. None of the things brought by the Australian maritime merchants these days left a deeper impression on them than this.

"This is a kerosene lamp, just a unique style."

"Truly a rare object!" Master Gao also walked up to it in a few steps. A ball of white light flame, dazzlingly bright, with a fully transparent glass lamp shade outside. He turned his head and asked, "Is this item produced in your honorable place? What is the value?"

Xiao Zishan couldn't help sighing at human's desire for light. The things they thought the ancients would be surprised at didn't cause big waves. Instead, this kerosene lamp which had been eliminated from modern society shocked them - simply because it was much brighter than candles and oil lamps. If Master Gao could see electric lights?! Xiao Zishan instantly filled with confidence for the future crossing plan.

"It is indeed produced in our country," Wen Desi smiled very like a profiteer, "Two hundred taels is enough."

"Rare object, rare object!" Master Gao fascinatiedly circled around this lamp looking again and again, and imitated Wen Desi to rotate the knob adjusting the flame size. Seeing the light could be bright or dim as one wished, he followed his heart's desire. He secretly marvelled in his heart. He knew that although this thing had a strange shape and an expensive glass shade, in reality it was things like lamp stands and oil platforms used by poor families. However, the light exceeded by more than ten times. It had neither oil smell nor smoke, and brightness could be adjusted. Could it be that the skilled craftsmen in Australia were all Lu Ban reborn?
Suddenly remembering something, he asked again: "The oil used in this lamp - um, kerosene, is it also produced in Australia?"

Xiao Zishan nodded. This Master Gao was really a smart person, seeing the key point at a glance.

"Exactly."

"Oil price?"

"Ten taels a bottle." One bottle is actually just one liter. At present, they didn't plan to engage in large-scale kerosene trade, so selling it expensive was fine, leaving some space for the future. (8.5 yuan/liter Shanghai lamp kerosene quotation)
"The lamp is a good lamp, but the oil..." Master Gao showed regret on his face.

"A bottle of oil can also burn for more than ten shichen (20+ hours). In a month, it's only ten or twenty taels of silver, not too expensive."

"If the oil could be cheaper, I could sell this item in large quantities..." Master Gao was unwilling.

Xiao Zishan just laughed it off and didn't pick up his conversation. Master Gao knew this group of Australian maritime merchants wouldn't let go. But getting this lamp for nothing, plus twelve bottles of kerosene as a gift, was considered a huge benefit. He thought, maybe vegetable oil could also be used, he would try it tomorrow.

At that moment, Xiao Zishan demonstrated the methods of disassembly, maintenance, and filling oil once. Gao Ju ordered a young servant to watch and learn, and do it a few times following the example. Seeing no mistakes, the price was verified according to the list.

The payment for goods was settled according to the price they negotiated, totaling more than three thousand taels of silver. Xiao Zishan requested one thousand five hundred taels to be converted into gold. Master Gao shook his head repeatedly, saying there was no place to exchange gold at night, and he himself only had fifty or sixty taels of gold in hand. Finally, sixty taels of gold replaced six hundred taels of silver.

Xiao Zishan proposed to buy porcelain again. This did not exceed Master Gao's expectation. Overseas merchants all liked to buy porcelain. It was not troublesome. There were plenty piled up in his warehouse. So he ordered people to fetch a few baskets of porcelain used for export.

Opening the straw rope package and taking out a few pieces to check, based on the few porcelain books Xiao Zishan had read in a rush, he identified that this was the so-called "Kraak porcelain", a representative export porcelain variety of the late Ming.

How much can this porcelain sell for now? An ordinary plate would not be less than a few thousand RMB. On December 10, 2005, 214 pieces of Kraak porcelain salvaged from the South China Sea by Swede Sten Sjostrand were auctioned at the China Guardian "Ming Wanli, Qing Disharu Shipwreck Ceramics" special session. Although the porcelain glaze was seriously corroded and even peeled off due to long-term immersion underwater, it still achieved a transaction rate of 92% and a total transaction volume of 2.727 million yuan. Among them, a Ming Wanli blue and white lotus petal-shaped open-panel flower and bird plate was auctioned for 55,000 yuan.

At this moment, brand new Kraak porcelain was right before their eyes in several full large baskets!
Buying these porcelains cost less than twenty taels of silver. Xiao Zishan and the others shouted cheap in their hearts, while Master Gao laughed secretly that these few maritime merchants didn't know the market. Both sides felt they had picked up a huge bargain.

Before leaving, Wen Desi left two hundred taels of silver, asking Master Gao to purchase a house nearby for their use. According to the plan, the exit of the wormhole in this space-time would be temporarily arranged there. Master Gao agreed to everything.

After the Australian maritime merchants left, Master Gao thought in the study alone for a long time, even chasing out the concubine who invited him to rest. Buying a house, with his ability, was naturally nothing, but the unidentified status of these people still worried him. After turning a few circles, he called the steward and ordered that the matter of Australian maritime merchants must not be leaked. He also asked him to list the servants, young servants and maids who knew about this matter and bring it in. If the news leaked, they would be strictly investigated and heavily punished.

Note: Knowledge of Kraak porcelain comes from Mr. Ma Weidu's book.
