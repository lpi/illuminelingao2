# Chapter 1481 - Provocation

"Fortunately, he didn't have a single ducat in Naples; otherwise, we'd have a respectable Prince of Naples here." The sarcastic young man's voice was low but just loud enough for those around him to hear, involuntarily eliciting a burst of laughter.

The Secretary pretended not to hear the snicker. He continued to discourse on his Italian experiences to a group of ladies admiring his Latin sonnets—just reaching the part about his audience with the Pope. Naturally, the Pope, like other dignitaries the Secretary claimed to have met, favored his "literary talent," granting him the honor of kissing his hand, which drew sighs of envy from the ladies.

"Respected Baroness," the Count spoke suddenly after a long silence: "I see a suit of armor on the wall. May I ask if this is an heirloom of yours?"

Everyone followed his gaze. On the wall at one end of the living room hung weapons used by the late Baron: long swords, halberds, scimitars, and various firearms, arranged in a semicircle. In the center, supported by a wooden stand, was a three-quarter cavalry armor. Carefully polished, it shone with silver light under the lamps.

"Ah, no. My late husband ordered that in Milan because he had to wear armor for the ceremony of joining the Order of the Leonza. The rest of the time, he would only wear it to attend banquets—"

"Then I make a special request," the Count spoke politely, but his face was expressionless, "Please bestow that suit of armor upon me."

Lucrezia nodded in astonishment. The Count pulled back his chair, stood up unhurriedly, his upper body perfectly straight. The onlookers at the dining table uttered whispers of surprise. especially some female guests, who screamed in fear when they saw the Count pull out a strange-shaped pistol flashing with blue-black glints from under his coat.

Deafening gunshots drowned out all noise. In an extremely short time, the Count fired four shots in succession. Finally, with a lift of his wrist, the helmet flew off in response to the shot, rolling onto the floor with a clang.

"Excuse me," Weiss said as the gunshots echoed in the living room for a long time and the white smoke gradually drifted away: "Who would be willing to check the hits?"

"Did you hear?" Baroness Ciarlo said to the black slave beside her, who was stunned like a wooden chicken. "Do as the Count instructed."

The black slave quickly returned to the dining table, picking up the helmet, and pointed out the bullet holes to the Baroness: .44 caliber bullets had pierced the iron visor, exiting from the upper back of the helmet neck, shooting straight through. The guests recovered from their shock and craned their necks. The black slave gestured to his own heart area, holding up four fingers. "There are four holes there," he said slowly. Everyone heard very clearly. Some eyes turned to the Count, others fixed on Esteban Sanabria. This guy's drunkenness had faded; his face was pale, sitting stiffly in his chair.

"I still have one bullet left in my chamber," the Count looked at the colony's number one tycoon. "A person accustomed to entrusting his life to a large piece of iron and a small pellet of lead is thoughtful in planning, cautious in speech, and decisive in action. Exactly the opposite of someone who lives by falsifying bonds and promissory notes and engaging in speculation."

Sanabria's teeth chattered loudly. Undoubtedly, he had no retreat. He tore off his glove and threw it at the Count's face, but his strength was misdirected; the glove flew over the dining table and landed in a soup tureen. The Count didn't mind at all; he bent down and fished out the dripping glove.

"I accept the challenge," the Count said. "Even as the insulted party, I allow you to choose the weapon. Pistol, carbine, dagger, long sword, saber, even a cannon—I will accept without objection. Did you hear clearly? Anything will do, even throwing stones. Although stupid and laughable, it counts for nothing to me; I will certainly win."

"Coward, bragging liar," Sanabria screamed wildly, looking deranged, eyes spitting fire, almost losing his reason. "My grandfather passed down a Saracen scimitar to me; I used it to chop off many heathens' heads. Tomorrow I will use it to chop off your head too!"

"Then tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, in the small woods in front of Santa Cruz village. By then we can see what kind of stuff flows in each other's veins." The Count sat back in his chair as if nothing had happened. "Madam, may we have the digestif now?"

"I have dueled with several noble lords in France..." The Secretary suddenly discovered another topic to add to his "masculinity," but a casual glance from the Count made him involuntarily swallow the rest of his words.

After the banquet ended, the rain had stopped. Guests dispersed, naturally not without discussing today's "entertainment"—needless to say, this matter would spread throughout Manila's high society tomorrow. Sanabria left in a daze. The Count kissed the hostess and the Mayor's wife—who kept wiping tears upon seeing he was to participate in a duel—before leaving, but he didn't take away the armor used as a target. The hostess returned to her room upstairs. Candles were extinguished one by one, and the grand living room, brilliant just moments ago, gradually dimmed.

When all guests had left, a figure emerged from the dark corridor and stepped into the living room. A hooded coarse black robe wrapped him, so even though he held a candlestick, others could hardly see his face. Servants busy cleaning the living room bypassed him one after another, as if he were a walking ghost.

The man in black walked to the shot-up armor, brought the candle close to examine it carefully, then searched on the ground for a moment but didn't find the scattered warheads as wished—perhaps swept away by servants. He took out a silver peso from his robe, about 38 millimeters in diameter, and placed it on the left side of the breastplate. The silver coin completely covered the four bullet holes. The man in black stared at Weiss Lando's shooting score. "Too accurate," he muttered softly to himself. "Either that guy's marksmanship is too excellent, or he must have some good stuff in his hands."

In the brightly lit grand living room, Lucrezia Ciarlo played the role of a dignified, cheerful, and generous noble lady very successfully. Once back in the bedroom, she fell into a gloomy and sensual mood, filling this largest room on the second floor with a similar atmosphere. A chandelier dimly lit the entire bedroom and the large bed hung with pink tulle curtains—the best Chinese tulle, like "a cloud of smoke"; the bed was spread with a sheet made of fine Indian cotton, dense and soft. The armchairs in the room were covered with velvet embroidered cushions, as soft as the bed. Incense burned in an exquisite small Japanese censer—neither light Japanese stick incense nor sandalwood favored by the Chinese, but incense sold only in Constantinople markets, used in Turkish harems to stimulate nerves and provoke lust.

Lucrezia lay in the large bathtub at one end of the room, eyes closed as if asleep. Two mixed-blood maids carefully added hot water to the tinned red copper tub, sprinkling dried gmelina and jasmine petals into the water.

Someone walked in. Although the girl's steps were light, her movement of pushing the door was more hurried than usual. The Baroness sensed it immediately. "Flora?" she called softly, eyes still closed.

"Madam," Flora said, "The Count sent someone to deliver this to you."

The Baroness opened her eyes and saw Flora holding a carved lacquer wooden box, the patterned lacquer surface glowing dark red under the dim candlelight. She wasn't in a hurry to open the box. "Did the Count hand it to you personally? Where is he now?"

"No, it was brought by one of his—attendants," Flora hesitated for a while before coming up with a word to describe the visitor.

"He has attendants too?" Madame Ciarlo seemed interested. "It seems he's a genuine nobleman?"

"Madam, I don't know how to describe that man. I couldn't tell if he was Chinese or East Indian, but the Count must have promoted him from butchers or bandits. Accustomed to killing work, the way he stared at people was like a knife stabbing into me. But he did come in the Count's carriage, and left in the Count's carriage. Absolutely no second carriage like that can be found here."

Lucrezia revealed a noncommittal smile, but when the box opened, she gasped in admiration. Inside lay a compact pistol. The finely carved gun body glowed with soft silver light; the handle was inlaid with shining mother-of-pearl. She had never seen a Derringer pistol, and this pistol with four barrels was so exquisite it was like a toy.

"This isn't the weapon that opened holes in your husband's armor," a gloomy male voice said in Portuguese.

Following the voice, a secret door inlaid in the paneling behind a tapestry opened quietly.

"Come in, Paul," Lucrezia greeted lazily. Flora placed the gun box on the low table by the tub, led the other two maids out of the bedroom, and closed the door.

Even if Weiss sat opposite Hale now, he couldn't possibly recognize at a glance this man who had once shared a ship with him. Survival on the Pratas Atoll, tossing about from Malacca to Zhongzuosuo then to Manila, the arduous march to conquer Baguio, endless battles, and the heavy work of establishing the arsenal had made him lose at least 20 pounds. Strong acid fumes blackened his teeth; acid left burn scars on his hand skin. His face became gaunt and weather-beaten, but a careful look revealed a certain fervent passion burning like fire in his eyes, fitting perfectly the image of a fanatic Paul Gaoshan had created for himself.
