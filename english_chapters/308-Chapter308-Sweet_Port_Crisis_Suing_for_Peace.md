# Chapter 308 - Sweet Port Crisis: Suing for Peace

This meant, naturally, that apart from a small faction closely aligned with Master Zhu, he represented the attitude of the majority of sugar firms.

Setting aside the truth of this statement, Feng Guangfeng's arrival at least indicated that the Haiyi Guild had begun to disintegrate internally. Some people were seeking their own way out.

"What is the purpose of your visit?"

Feng Guangfeng hesitated for a moment before revealing the secret discussions among the many sugar firms of the Haiyi Guild over the past few days.

Except for Master Zhu's Riyicheng, all other firms in the Haiyi Guild now believed it was time to make peace with Huanan. The immense strength Huanan had displayed in mobilizing capital and dealing with pirates made them clearly realize that Master Zhu's attempt to strangle Huanan was like a mantis trying to stop a chariot.

Therefore, they proposed: a truce. The Haiyi Guild would accept Huanan as a member, enjoying all treatment of the trade: hereafter, Huanan could acquire sugar in Leizhou as it pleased, provided it followed the guild's agreed pricing, without obstruction from other members; Huanan's sugar could be shipped out freely, with no interference from the guild.

In return, they hoped Huanan would lower its price to 1.8 taels, while the Haiyi Guild raised theirs to 2 taels. This would attract farmers who hadn't sold yet to Hai'an Street.

"This is unreasonable, I know," Feng Guangfeng said. "But these days, almost no guild members have received any sugar stocks. Huanan has acquired plenty this season and made big money. We beg you to show mercy and leave a path for your colleagues to survive!" He bowed deeply again.

Wen Tong thought these conditions were absurd—this was suing for peace? Offering a seat in the Haiyi Guild was a great concession? As for free acquisition and shipping, wasn't Huanan free now? Of course, this "freedom" had been won by the Transmigration Group's guns. The Great Ancestor's saying "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" truly pierced the essence of things.

"Boss Feng!" Wen Tong thought for a moment. "This is strange talk! The acquisition of sugar stocks is a matter of the Haiyi Guild lowering prices itself. What does it have to do with Huanan? If you want to buy sugar now, just raise the price back up. Huanan promises not to raise prices further, anyway."

"This—" Feng Guangfeng was speechless. The argument was well-founded and irrefutable. He, too, felt that asking Huanan to adjust prices was hard to justify.

"...Is joining the Haiyi Guild so rare a privilege?" Wen Tong laughed. "Isn't Huanan doing just fine so far? You've seen the end of those who tried crooked schemes. You people, naive! Truly too naive! To still harbor such thoughts at this stage!" He laughed loudly, displaying his "tyrant's aura." "If my employer didn't wish to be benevolent to the utmost, the Haiyi Guild would have been ashes long ago."

This laugh was hearty and unrestrained, sweeping away the gloom of months of anxiety. Even Zhou Shizhai, whose martial cultivation usually kept him "unmoved," smiled.

Had this been said half a month ago, Feng Guangfeng might have taken it for bluster. Now, his back was soaked in sweat.

"Yes, yes," Feng Guangfeng bowed again. "Regarding past events, we were blind, our hearts clouded by lard! We offered great offense! But we still ask the managers to facilitate this matter. The large and small members of the Haiyi Guild will be indebted!"

This was a dilemma. An outright refusal might unite them more closely, forcing them to follow Zhu An to the bitter end. It would also lose the perfect opportunity to absorb the Haiyi Guild. But agreeing would mean breaking faith with the Leizhou farmers.

This matter required caution. Wen Tong and Chen Tianxiong exchanged glances. Wen Tong said, "How about this: Boss Feng, please return for now. We need to discuss this before making a decision."

"Yes, then this lowly one awaits good news." Feng Guangfeng knew such a major matter wouldn't receive an immediate promise. Terms would likely be set, which was expected.

Chen Tianxiong nodded. "If we need to find you, where should we go?"

"Go to the Dachang Rice Shop and ask Boss Zhu to pass a message. He is my fellow townsman."

"Boss Zhu... isn't he from Qinzhou?" Chen Tianxiong asked deliberately. "I recall the owners and shopkeepers of the Haiyi Guild are mostly from Swatow and Canton."

"I am not from there." Feng Guangfeng didn't hide it, explaining how, as a clerk at Richangji, he was chosen by the owner to marry into the family and inherit the business.

Chen Tianxiong already knew this from investigations. Seeing him speak without evasion suggested Boss Feng was honest. This attitude was good.

"We need to take over this organization, the Haiyi Guild," Wen Tong said after seeing Feng Guangfeng out.

Several key figures of Huanan had gathered in the room. Mei Lin had returned to Lingao; Xiao Gui and Beiwei were uninterested in business matters and didn't attend. Chang Shide, fresh from Lingao, was present.

"Naturally. Otherwise, we could just wipe them out," Chen Tianxiong said. His thinking was more complex than Wen Tong's. Intelligence gathering had given him a good understanding of the Haiyi Guild's scale and capability. The twenty-one sugar firms had a minimum capital of over ten thousand taels each. Total capital exceeded five or six hundred thousand taels. If this money could be manipulated by the Transmigration Group, it would greatly benefit Huanan's next steps.

Manipulation didn't mean possession. That would be naked robbery. Merely joining the "Haiyi Guild" as a member wouldn't allow manipulation. Although Master Zhu controlled the guild to an extent, he only managed to facilitate communication and unity; business was still done individually.

"If we do it, we make it a holding company," Chang Shide said shockingly.

"Haha, we think alike." Wen Tong beamed. "Of course, we'll be Chairman and CEO."

"What CEO? This habit of abusing English abbreviations must change. It's called keeping pace with the times! Just say Chief Executive Officer," Chen Tianxiong said solemnly.

"Fine. But persuading this group to join a joint-stock company will be hard. Human hearts are complex."

"That's why now is the time," Chen Tianxiong said. "We ride the momentum of the great victory at Juhua Islet. While they're scared to death, we push it through in one go. Once they recover, we might not be able to control these sugar dogs!" He sipped his tea. "Complex hearts don't matter. The key is to hold onto the word 'profit'."

The Haiyi Guild united against Huanan for profit; now they sought peace and prepared to abandon Master Zhu for profit. As long as Huanan Corporation could provide enough profit, these merchants would gladly obey.

"However, execution is difficult. The key is finding someone among them who knows the trade and the world. Only then will our words move them. Otherwise, if they're all bumpkins, we'll just be shouting at the wind!"

"Someone with prestige, too," Wen Tong added. "Those who see clearly often hold no power. Those without power speak in vain."

This resonated with everyone. Their knowledge of the Haiyi Guild's internal affairs was limited. Xiao Zhanfeng had said some things, but being an outsider, he knew little.

Wen Tong asked, "How about Feng Guangfeng? He seems sincere."

"No good," Chen Tianxiong said. "He's a live-in son-in-law. The ancients looked down on such men most. And he's not a fellow townsman to most of the guild. Plus, he's a small player; his words carry no weight."

Everyone felt slightly disappointed. Then Chang Shide laughed: "I've got it! In any trade guild, while they claim to protect industry interests, it's always the few big firms taking advantage while the small firms suffer—"

"We recruit the small firms!" Chen Tianxiong reacted instantly.

They immediately summoned Liao Daxing and asked about the firms under the Haiyi Guild.

"Four big firms. The rest are small," Liao Daxing, having been a grain shop clerk for years, knew the basics.

"The biggest is naturally Master Zhu's Riyicheng," Liao Daxing said. Actually, Riyicheng wasn't originally the biggest. When Master Zhu inherited it, it was last among the big firms.

"...It prospered because he founded the Haiyi Guild. He unified the loose sand of Hai'an Street—and grabbed plenty of benefits for himself."

"There must be conflicts between big and small firms, right?"

"How could there not be! Take the public account. The Haiyi Guild collects a public fund for dealings with officials, pirates, and hiring guards. Originally, it was ten thousand taels a year, split with big firms paying one share and small firms half a share."

"...Later, it became twenty thousand taels a year—"

"The big firms say they pay, but actually don't, or pay less, right?"

"Yes, small firms whisper about it privately." Liao Daxing nodded. "Actually, only Riyicheng truly pays nothing. Big firms paying less is true. Besides, only Heaven knows the guild's expenses. It's all managed by Master Zhu's people."

"How do you know this so clearly?" Chen Tianxiong was intrigued.

"Not hard. Boss Feng and Boss Zhu are fellow townsmen and drink together often. I heard it. Boss Feng is quite a character!" Liao Daxing spoke of Feng Guangfeng with some admiration.

"Good person, skilled in business. Rare to find someone who isn't obsessed with money! Several small firms respect him and don't look down on him as a live-in son-in-law."

Knowing the guild's structure and maladies confirmed that recruiting small firms was viable. The question remained: how?
