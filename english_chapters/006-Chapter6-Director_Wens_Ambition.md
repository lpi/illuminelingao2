# Chapter 6: Director Wen's Ambition

Wen Desi gave a general account of his solo crossing. The alternate timespace he reached through his bathroom was beneath a certain hill, right alongside a small river. Judging by the degree of land development, this was a fairly prosperous agricultural region. The terrain and vegetation appeared to be southern China. Just as he was hesitating over whether to venture deeper and search for a village to investigate, something unexpected occurred:

A party of soldiers in ancient costume, led by a mounted officer, marched a dozen or so peasant-looking people to the riverbank. Then the killing began.

Though Wen Desi had seen some quite bloody photographs online, witnessing the scene in person from thirty meters away was incomparably shocking.

Finally the soldiers severed the heads, casually tossed some damaged weapons around the corpses, and then rode off in formation behind their officer.

"...It's a good thing I was wearing camouflage, or that could have gone badly." Even now, Wen Desi spoke with lingering fear. "The nearest ones were less than ten meters from me."

The alternate timespace left Wen Desi with two first impressions: the air was excellent, and one's life was precarious.

Wen Desi opened his laptop and showed them photos taken at the scene. The mutilated headless corpses, rendered in nine-megapixel single-lens-reflex clarity, were realistic enough to induce nausea.

"I also found some copper coins scattered around the area." Wen Desi produced a plastic bag containing a dozen or so coins. "There are several types. I had someone examine them—the most recent are Tianqi Tongbao."

"It could also be the Chongzhen reign."

"At least it's after Tianqi Year Two," said Xiao Zishan with considerable confidence. "Emperor Guangzong only reigned for a few months before he died. In Tianqi Year One they were still minting his father's Taichang Tongbao. They didn't start minting Tianqi-era coins until the second year. If you factor in the time needed for minting and circulation, you can estimate it's Tianqi Year Three or later."

"Still, that era estimate is a bit broad. Those two brothers reigned for over twenty years combined."

"I believe it should be Tianqi, or at most early Chongzhen. Chongzhen Tongbao was minted in large quantities everywhere and circulated widely—it wouldn't be possible to have only Tianqi coins."

With the era established, what did they actually intend to do?

A wormhole leading to an alternate timespace held monumental significance for the scientific community. But the three men in the bathroom were clearly not physicists—a Nobel Prize was not in the cards. If this were to be reported as major news, none of them worked in media; at best, they would be the principals in the story. Naturally, as the discoverer, Director Wen would receive brief mention in the news. Beyond that, all three harbored rather conspiratorial thoughts: given the potentially enormous consequences, the wormhole's existence might very well be entirely suppressed—just as Americans had long suspected there was an Area 51—and in that case, their prospects would be rather grim.

Apart from the wormhole's property owner—since ownerless objects belong to their discoverer, Wen Desi could be considered the wormhole's owner—the other two understood clearly that this was an opportunity. If Wen Desi truly intended to pursue some physics prize or to attempt his "solo, bidirectional, low-profile crossing," he would never have made that post.

How great was this opportunity? As Director Wen said: great enough to potentially possess an entire world—another dimension's seventeenth century.

At this thought, their breathing grew heavy.

After a brief discussion, there in Wen Desi's bathroom, the initial Executive Committee was established and immediately produced its first document. In the historical chronicle of New World discovery, this meeting would be called the "Bathroom Conference."

**The guiding principle passed by the conference:** *Build a New World!*

How would they create their new world? The ancients were not mindless NPCs—in wisdom they were no less than modern people. They lacked neither courage nor strength. As for environmental adaptability, pampered modern folk could not begin to compare. Though these three enjoyed reading time-travel and alternate-history novels, at least they knew they possessed no "aura of a true king."

The one advantage the transmigrators had over the people of that era was three hundred additional years of civilizational accumulation.

"Scale and standardization," said Wang Luobin, "are the keys to victory. An industrialized society is capable of defeating any ancient society."

Their vision: assemble a large group of transmigrators possessing modern technology and management expertise, carry modern industrial equipment and technical knowledge, cross together into that timespace, establish a base, complete basic industrialization, form a comprehensive industrial system, and from that starting point, dominate the globe.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. No matter how grand the goal, one must eat one bite at a time. After discussion, the group set two near-term objectives:

1. Recruit transmigrators.
2. Raise funds to purchase materials and equipment.

Wen Desi decided to first establish a Skype chat group for communication purposes. The original post, now extremely popular, would receive no further explanation—he simply added the group number and a backup email address, then locked the thread. Everyone agreed that from now on, it was best to avoid attracting attention.

As for funds, though these three had some savings, combined it came to less than one million yuan. One million RMB to complete industrialization—even the industrialization of the Industrial Revolution era—was too fantastical.

Of course, theoretically subsequent participants would also bring capital, but not by much more.

Utilizing the bidirectional crossing to exploit price differences between the two timespaces seemed the most realistic method for quickly raising funds.

Using modern products to reap enormous profits in an ancient era—this was the tried-and-true wealth-building technique in every time-travel novel. Everyone immediately thought of glass mirrors, glass cups, matches, wristwatches, and other trademark transmigrator treasures. Countless predecessors had relied on these to make their fortunes in alternate timespaces, digging up their first pot of gold and embarking on their road to hegemony.

Xiao Zishan contributed the large quantity of promotional giveaways he had accumulated over the years out of a fondness for small bargains:

Plastic powder compacts with mirrors, melamine bowls, spoons, and chopsticks, small fruit knives, plastic-cloth kitchen aprons, acrylic hat-scarf-and-gloves sets, glass mugs, plastic lunch boxes, towels... all told, three or four boxes of miscellaneous items. These cheap goods custom-made in Yiwu, uglily stamped with various company logos, now gleamed like gold in their eyes.

Venetian glass mirrors in the seventeenth century were luxury items even in Europe and nonexistent in Asia. From this perspective, mirrors represented a monopoly. Then there were the unbreakable bowls and plates, the transparent lunch boxes... even the empty purified-water bottles they had just drunk from—any of these were novelties unseen in that timespace. Theoretically, they could charge whatever they wanted: one hundred taels per compact, two thousand taels per cup, one hundred taels per bowl... hadn't countless transmigrator predecessors done exactly this?

All three felt their blood pressure rise, excited by the golden future before them. Wen Desi even began to feel a twinge of regret—perhaps risking a solo bidirectional crossing really could have unified the world.

"But if we just go over like this, the moment we reach the city gate, we'll be arrested as Japanese pirates and hauled off to the Maritime Defense Magistrate's office," Wang Luobin recalled a practical issue.

"Does Guangzhou have a Maritime Defense Magistrate's office?"

"I'm not sure, but the Maritime Trade Superintendency should be there."

"That's true—we're in strange clothing, and our accents are peculiar. Guangzhou isn't sparsely populated. And we have no travel permits..."

"Will they banish us to Liaodong?"

"It won't go that far, but if our strange clothes and suspicious behavior get us dragged before the yamen, we won't die but we'll certainly lose a layer of skin." Xiao Zishan recalled some memoirs by Portuguese who had visited Ming-era China. One unlucky Portuguese pirate had recorded his entire experience after being captured in great detail. Although he lavished praise on the Ming judicial system, calling it a perfect institution of justice, fairness, and transparency, he also declared without hesitation that for prisoners, it was cruel.

Thinking of the various tortures the Portuguese had suffered and witnessed, Xiao Zishan shuddered with fear.

"Maybe we should look up some Hanfu websites? I've seen a few that have done very careful research on Ming-era clothing codes."

"Clothing is one thing, but we can't learn the manners and behavior." Wang Luobin objected. "It would only be more suspicious."

"What if we pose as foreign merchants—we could claim to be sea traders from Borneo." Wen Desi proposed a new idea. "Maybe we could even pose as tribute envoys? Don't emperors all love having myriad nations pay homage?"

"Tribute trade had already stopped by that point. Besides, the court was probably preoccupied and not interested." Xiao Zishan thought for a moment. "As I recall, the Ming had very strict controls on foreigners. Apart from the Portuguese, foreign merchants could only trade in Macau—their ships weren't allowed into the Pearl River."

"The Portuguese could enter Guangzhou?"

"Yes, apparently every year Guangzhou held trade fairs where merchants from all over brought goods to exchange with the Portuguese."

"So the Canton Trade Fair has this long a history." Wang Luobin remarked with admiration.

The Canton Trade Fair, once China's main window for foreign trade, had its predecessor in the Ming Dynasty—though back then it was open only to Portuguese merchants. It was held twice a year, in summer and winter, at Haizhu Island—the present-day area around the Haizhu District Trade Union Federation.

"But none of us looks like a foreign friend. Were there overseas Chinese back then?"

"Maybe. Who knows."

"This is a headache. Looks like we'll need to consult some historical sources."

Suddenly Xiao Zishan slapped the table and laughed:

"We're so stupid! Why are we always thinking about how to get into Guangzhou? Aren't we *in* Guangzhou?"

Everyone's eyes lit up. Indeed—since the wormhole's entry and exit points were identical in both timespaces, as long as they crossed within the Ming-era boundaries of Guangzhou city, they would enter directly inside the city. And if any crisis arose, they could simply open the wormhole and escape back.

The crossing point they chose was Haopan Street, originally in the riverfront zone south of Guangzhou city. This area had been a commercially developed region since the Southern Song dynasty; commerce flourished even more in the early Ming. When the new city walls were expanded during the Jiajing reign, this commercial district along the Pearl River was included within them. From then on, Guangzhou's southern city wall stood directly on the banks of the Pearl River.

In the Ming, Haopan Street was where wealthy merchants from other provinces supposedly congregated—in fact, it was a gathering place for smugglers. These people colluded with fishermen on Youyu Islet at the mouth of the Pearl River, specializing in transporting goods from "barbarian ships"—smuggling, in other words. "Whenever a foreign ship arrived, they conspired with the wealthy merchants of Haopan Street from other provinces to load porcelain, silk wadding, private coinage, and gunpowder, departing fully loaded and returning fully loaded." Xiao Zishan strongly suspected that these so-called "wealthy merchants from other provinces" all had official backing, which was why their smuggling operations were so brazen.

Since they were all in the smuggling business, they surely wouldn't care where the newcomers were from. Profit was the merchant's nature. From this perspective, the merchants of Haopan Street seemed the most suitable people to contact.
