# Chapter 187: Building a Harmonious Lingao (Part 2)

Wu Mingjin chose the main hall for receiving them for two reasons: first, the hall was for trials, signifying the baldies weren't guests but criminals; second, to demonstrate his dealings with the baldies could withstand any scrutiny.

Seeing the baldy envoy was only in his early twenties, fair-skinned, slightly plump, with a calm demeanor, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly. Clearly a good family's son. Even without passing examinations, he could have been a prosperous commoner. Why join bandits?

Xiong Buyu was seeing the county magistrate for the first time. He studied him curiously. Besides noting a middle-aged scholar, nothing special. Looking around at the runners—all gaunt, appearing wretched. Their clothing was old beyond recognition. The yamen was pathetically shabby: pillars and beams with peeling paint, cobwebs everywhere, mold on walls, plaster falling in patches, floor tiles cracked and broken.

Xiong Buyu momentarily felt some goodwill toward this Ming county government—compared to the "White House," this yamen was the epitome of austerity. Actually, he didn't know this dilapidated state was an official-culture superstition of "never repairing yamens"—as long as it hadn't collapsed, magistrates would never spend money on repairs.

Wu Mingjin saw this man enter the hall without the trembling fear of common people. Somewhat disappointed. Seeing his arrogant lack of deference—not even bowing, let alone kneeling—anger rose. Just as he was about to thunder "How dare you not kneel before this official," to dampen his spirit, he glanced at his runners. Those who usually puffed out their chests with menacing voices were all humble-faced now, not daring to look at the two baldies. Seeing the dozen gray-clad, armed baldies outside, his rising anger immediately wilted by half. A servant brought tea and slipped him a note. Written by Secretary Wang, just one ink character: "Endure."

Xiong Buyu didn't waste words, handing over the letter drafted by Yu Eshui. Opening it, Wu Mingjin found crude prose, half-vernacular half-classical, with mediocre calligraphy—clearly written by an unlettered person. But the meaning was clear. First, it stated that yesterday Liu Xiang's bandit fleet and Westerners had attacked Bopu. They were defeated. Three enemy ships sunk. Over 500 pirates killed. The pirates had fled in panic.

So last night was pirates attacking—black eating black. Wu Mingjin had always dreaded frequent pirate incursions. Now that they'd retreated, he felt some relief. At least people weren't ravaged by them.

The second part said Australian merchants were Chinese descendants who'd emigrated to escape late-Song chaos. Now returning to China, they would never harm compatriots. Their maxim was "strike the strong, aid the weak, protect territory and people"—seeking only local peace with absolutely no intention of rebellion.

Hmph, whatever they say. Wu Mingjin skimmed further. The substantive content stated: pirates frequently raided Lingao, bandits were rampant, people suffered, county governance was difficult, Ming Dynasty's imperial grace didn't reach all people. Therefore, the transmigrators would organize Northern Lingao's villages into a joint-defense militia. They hoped Magistrate Wu would approve and support this.

Finally, the letter promised that once joint defense was established, local pirates and bandits would be completely eliminated. Moreover, the county's summer and autumn grain tax quotas would no longer be a problem.

Truly transparent ambitions! Wu Mingjin looked at the two envoys. Their arrogant expressions showed no sense of hierarchy. Wasn't this obvious? The baldies were using joint defense to control all villages' militia forces. Next, decrees would come from East Gate Market, not the yamen.

Seeing his silence, Xiong Buyu spoke:

"Magistrate Wu has long suffered pirate incursions. Here is a humble gift." He waved. Workers pushed in wheelbarrows loaded with wooden boxes and straw bags, placing them in the yamen courtyard. Everyone smelled something like dried fish. Wu Mingjin was secretly puzzled. He sent a runner to check. The runner opened a box and immediately recoiled. Everyone could see clearly—a salt-preserved human head inside.

Looking at the other boxes and bags, the contents were obvious. A chill ran down Wu Mingjin's back. Barely suppressing panic, he asked: "How dare you! Where did these heads come from?"

"Reporting to Your Honor: these are pirates who attacked our Lingao county yesterday. According to their confessions, they're men of Guangdong's great pirate chieftain Liu Xiang. Please verify."

Wu Mingjin saw so many heads and quickly summoned a coroner to examine them. Inspection revealed heads of red-haired foreigners and South Sea islanders, plus several wanted outlaws. The claim of pirates seemed genuine.

Killing so many pirates in one battle was unprecedented in county history—no, not just the county. In the past decade, even imperial troops hadn't achieved this. Wu Mingjin was secretly shocked. The pirates plaguing Fujian and Guangdong, rampaging for over a decade since Wanli's last years, had resisted the combined forces of two provinces and tens of thousands of troops. The court could only hold its nose and grant amnesty to the great pirate Zheng Zhilong to stabilize the coast...

"How do we know you didn't kill innocents for false credit!" Wu Mingjin suddenly barked.

"What did you say?!" Wu Mingjin spoke in official Mandarin, which Wang Ruixiang mostly understood. Hearing this, anger surged: only regular troops did such dastardly things. Truly judging a gentleman by petty standards.

Xiong Buyu said: "Your Honor errs. We hold no office and seek no official reward. Why would we fake achievements? These heads merely express our sincerity. We seek no court rewards. That our county could eliminate this fierce bandit gang is thanks to Your Honor's excellent moral instruction..."

This last bit was flattery. But he wasn't wrong. The baldies didn't need heads for career advancement—no need to kill innocents for credit.

So many pirate heads—if reported to the prefecture, this would be major merit! Wu Mingjin's previously dim mood suddenly brightened. Official ambition warmed. Involuntarily, his expression softened. He said gently:

"You are all extraordinary talents. Why not serve the court instead of becoming outlaws?"

Xiong Buyu silently laughed. If not for your decent reputation, Director would've stormed the city to "struggle" you by now. Our gradual peaceful evolution is already quite courteous.

After the transmigrator group had established themselves along the Bairren-Bopu line, the Executive Committee's next policy was encircling cities from rural areas. Through village joint defense, villages would be initially incorporated into the transmigrator administrative system, hollowing out Lingao county seat's governing role. The transmigrators would draw in and divide local farmers through agricultural technology cooperation, ultimately controlling the villages.

But implementing this strategy required making people believe Bairren Fortress wasn't a rebel gang. The yamen's attitude was crucial—especially Wu Mingjin's. If he insisted transmigrators were rebels and pirates, people would have many reservations about interacting with them.

"Here also are captured pirate banners, documents, tokens, and weapons. All submitted to the county." Xiong Buyu was very polite. This "generous gift" should move Wu Mingjin. In an era when fires raged everywhere, imperial troops repeatedly lost, General Yu was court-martialed, and Ming could only stabilize the coast by granting amnesty to the great pirate Zheng Zhilong—Lingao county defeating Liu Xiang's forces and killing 400 Chinese and foreign pirates would be a major bright spot.

Xiong Buyu saw his continued silence and made to leave. Wu Mingjin nodded slightly. "Court dismissed!"

Wang Ruixiang followed Xiong Buyu out of the yamen. The laborers at the wheelbarrows all looked pleased—the county had sent reward money plus twenty jars of wine and two whole roast pigs. Apparently as refreshment.

Back at Bairren Fortress, they reported everything to Wen Desi. Wang Ruixiang couldn't help asking: "That's it?"

"Watch. Within a few days, he'll almost certainly contact us." Wen Desi said. "Too many eyes and ears in the main hall. He couldn't say certain things."

"These damn officials and their twists and turns." Wang Ruixiang sighed.

"If he were as stubbornly righteous as Hai Rui, we'd have to use violent methods." Wen Desi said. "Fortunately, he's not. Much easier to handle. Just wait."

Sure enough, next evening at dusk, a furtive figure appeared at the Wenshui Bridge checkpoint. He told the sentry he wanted to meet "the baldies' big official." Checkpoint chief Luo Duo didn't dare delay, immediately calling the Executive Committee.

The visitor was brought to the quiet Security Team building. After questioning, they learned he was Zhang Youfu's servant, requesting the baldies' big official attend a banquet.

Wen Desi remembered—Zhang Youfu was the envoy the county had sent to negotiate after their failed encirclement months ago. His sudden meeting request was obviously on someone's behalf. He immediately agreed. The servant said Zhang Youfu's manor was just outside West Gate. Wen Desi decided to go personally. Zhang Youfu spoke several dialects including Cantonese—no communication difficulties.

After dark, two sedan chairs arrived at the manor. Wen Desi and Xi Yazhou went together. For safety, Bei Wei selected eight men from the Recon Team for escort. Besides personal weapons, Wen Desi was given a signal flare—if anything happened, fire it, and Bei Wei would bring rescue.

Wen Desi and Xi Yazhou, carried by Zhang Youfu's tenant farmers, swayed through pitch-dark fields. The leading lantern was dim as will-o'-the-wisp. Without the eight recon men, they'd have felt quite nervous.

The sedan chairs were old, stuffy, and poorly handled by inexperienced farmers. After half an hour of bouncing, they stopped. Emerging, they saw an ordinary farmhouse courtyard.

Someone was already waiting at the gate. Seeing them arrive, they quickly ushered them in, immediately closing the gate.

The courtyard was equally dark. Though lanterns hung under the veranda, everything was shadowy—wheelbarrows, hay stacks, millstones visible only vaguely.

Zhang Youfu, though called a landlord, was actually impoverished. His "manor" was just one large courtyard. He lived in five main rooms; farmhands and servants in wing rooms; animal sheds along the walls. But the walls were high, clearly brick-and-stone, with an iron-plated thick wooden gate. All for defense against bandits.
