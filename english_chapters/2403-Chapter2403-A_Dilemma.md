# Chapter 2403: A Dilemma

Chu He looked at him, face covered in pastry crumbs and surrounded by baskets of pastries piled on the floor, and didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He quickly shouted, "Won't you eat yourself to death! Why did you buy so much? How are you going to get back later?"

Zhang Yu quickly said, "My humble shop will deliver the goods to your residence in a moment. I wonder where the Chief is staying?"

"I'm staying at the guesthouse in the Great World. You can hand it to the service desk," Chu He said, then ordered the bill to be settled.

As a Senator, he naturally wouldn't carry much cash. Zhang's was not a shop in the Senate's special supply system, so naturally, they couldn't put it on the Senator's Black Card tab. Thus, Piao Zhixian carried a Delong checkbook and would fill it out on the spot for however much was used.

Zhang Yu took the abacus and the shipping list and personally calculated on the abacus. His abacus skills were already good, and at this moment he intentionally showed off. He flicked the beads like flowing clouds and moving water, chanting the product name, unit price, and quantity while calculating, without any stagnation. In no time, he cleared the accounts and sang them out.

Chu He filled in the numbers on the checkbook, then stamped it with his ring signet—this check could be exchanged for cash at any Delong branch or Delong-affiliated business.

"This is bearer-payable, don't lose it," Chu He laughed as he handed it over.

"Chief is joking. This single transaction of yours is worth a week's sales for my humble shop. How could I dare not keep it carefully," Zhang Yu said.

Watching Chu He's group leave, Zhang Yu looked at the mountains of pastry baskets and boxes in front of him and couldn't feel happy at all—if it were normal times, making such a big sale during a slow business period would have kept him happy for days. But right now, he only felt a heavy weight in his heart.

He had already stated his position in front of Senator Chu; his family could not decline participating in the Nanyang fundraising. More or less, they had to participate some amount.

But where would the money come from?

Zhang Yu didn't need to look at the ledger—he had long since worn it out flipping through it. Whether it was Zhang's Food or Zhang's Old Shop, the bottom of the accounts was crystal clear to him. Just two words: No money!

If he didn't participate in this Nanyang fundraising, not only would he be suspected of deceiving Senator Chu, but he also wouldn't be able to explain it to the Senate. No matter how much he emphasized his difficulties, in the eyes of the Senators, this would be "perfunctory attitude" or "non-cooperation." If elevated further, it would be "having disloyal intentions"...

Zhang Yu sweated profusely, thinking it over. This matter could only be discussed with his father.

The next evening, Zhang Yu returned home.

Since the Zhang family moved into their new residence, they followed the rules of big households, employing a gatekeeper and buying a few servants. As soon as the Young Master entered the main gate, the servant boy at the door repeatedly announced his arrival to the inside.

Zhang Yu rarely went home recently. Just as he entered the main hall, his mother was already waiting.

Usually, a reunion between mother and son who hadn't seen each other for many days would be a warm moment of maternal kindness and filial piety. However, Zhang Yu frowned tightly, entered the room, greeted her hastily, and sat down, his face full of worry.

Seeing his locked brows, Mother Zhang couldn't help stepping forward to ask him: "Yu'er, what's wrong? Are there difficulties in the business?"

Zhang Yu didn't answer, only asked: "Mother, where is Old Dad?"

"He just came back from the Great World shop and is resting in the inner room," his mother chattered. "He's old, yet he refuses to rest more and let the clerks do the work. He insists on staring at the stove. I told him: 'This small business of yours, why pay so much attention to it? A year of your work isn't worth a day of your son's business...'"

"Mom, please invite Old Dad out. I want to discuss something with him."

"Your Old Dad is already asleep..."

"I have urgent business."

Zhang Yu's mother was startled. Her son's expression and tone were very different from usual; evidently, something big had happened. She dared not neglect it and quickly got up to go to the back. After a short while, Zhang Yu's father came out from the back rubbing his eyes.

Although Zhang Yu's father had been sleeping in a daze, hearing his wife say their son had "urgent business to discuss" made him mostly awake. He hurriedly draped clothes over his shoulders and came to the main hall.

Between father and son, there was no time for pleasantries. Before the old father even sat down, he asked: "Yu'er, what urgent matter is there?"

Zhang Yu glanced at the courtyard outside. Zhang Yu's mother knew her son had confidential words to speak with his father, so she sent the maidservant waiting under the porch away.

Zhang Yu lowered his voice: "Dad, Mom, there is a matter I need to discuss with Dad. How much cash does the family still have?"

Mother Zhang exclaimed in surprise: "Yu'er, what are you doing that needs the family to take out money?"

Father Zhang didn't speak, pondering for a long time. Towards this son, he had gone from doubt to trust, and consistently until recently, to unease.

Trust went without saying. This walnut cake shop, which he had barely supported and was on the verge of bankruptcy, had been carried forward by his son's coincidental fortune, suddenly achieving a scale he hadn't dared to dream of—let alone him, even the ancestors in the underworld would probably drop their jaws in shock if they knew.

He himself hadn't expected that his son could really "bring glory to the ancestors"—after Zhang Yu turned ten, he had completely given up such hope, only praying that his son wouldn't be dissolute and ruin this small family property. To steadily guard the family business, carry on the lineage, and pass down the Zhang family and this small shop would be enough.

However, alongside trust in his son's ability, he also had a vague worry.

Nouveau riche often have no good end; this was the life experience Zhang's father had accumulated over many years. Bluntly put, his own son was just the young manager of a cake shop and originally not the material for doing big things or big business. By chance and coincidence, he had clung to noble people and soared straight to the Ninth Heaven, becoming the "Young Master Zhang" known to everyone inside and outside Guangzhou city. In the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce where big shots gathered, he was seemingly the number one person under Gao Ju. How many former high officials and dignitaries came to his cake shop to buy snacks not for a bite to eat, but just to leave an impression on his son.

Watching him build a tall building, watching him feast and sing, watching his building collapse. Zhang's father had seen such things more than once. Could his own son safely pass down this family property? He had always worried about this matter, and for this worry, he was always making some preparations.

Although his son had mentioned operational difficulties in the past, opening his mouth to ask for money today clearly meant something big had happened to the company!

After a long time, Father Zhang spoke: "Money, the family has some. But you must explain clearly, what do you intend to use this money for? Don't hide or Tuck it away. Even if it's a difficulty as big as the sky, say it. The family will try to think of a way if possible."

Zhang Yu then explained one by one: the report in the Federation's Weekly a few days ago about the southward colonization stock and bond issuance; Master Gao sending a message to ask roughly how much his family prepared to contribute; and Senator Chu's visit today.

"...Whether stocks or bonds, this money must be paid more or less. It's just that your son doesn't have a single coin of spare money on hand right now!"

Father Zhang and Mother Zhang were both startled and hurriedly asked: "Didn't you say the food company's business is huge? Losing orders because you can't make them in time..."

Zhang Yu smiled bitterly: "Orders are indeed too many to finish, but the daily expenses are also huge. The end of the year is approaching; just the flour, rice flour, sugar, and nuts owed to various brands is an incredible sum..."

The number he spoke made the old couple suck in a breath of cold air. Let alone themselves, even among the people they knew, no one had ever handled such a large sum of money!

"Does this money... still have to be paid?" Father Zhang asked urgently. He understood the terrible consequences of a broken capital chain. "Tell the truth!"

"It still has to be paid." Zhang Yu hurriedly comforted his father. "It's just that once this money is paid back, there will be no money left to buy Nanyang bonds!"

Mother Zhang wondered: "The Australians are so rich, why do they want to borrow money from big households? Weren't the machines in the factory bought with money borrowed from the Australians?"

Zhang Yu said: "Dad, this is one thing vs another. Our family borrowing money was borrowing from Delong Bank. This time it's the Nanyang Company borrowing from us."

Father Zhang said: "Isn't that all the Senate's?"

This time Zhang Yu couldn't explain it clearly either. He scratched his head and said: "Um... anyway, it's just borrowing money. I've already asked the Federation: whether stocks or bonds, it's one yuan per share. If it's stock, then dividends are distributed after three years, sharing however much profit there is. If buying bonds, the interest is 1 fen annual interest, with a term of 3 years, paying interest once a year."

"This interest isn't high, is it? We used to give 1 fen 5 interest a year for people depositing silver in the shop!" Mother Zhang said.

Father Zhang frowned and pondered for a long time: "High or low interest aside, Yu'er, must this money be borrowed?"

"The Federation secretary said it's entirely voluntary. That Senator Chu said the same. But..."

"I understand!" Father Zhang sighed heavily. "In your position, you can't *not* buy!"

"Yes." Zhang Yu nodded. "This little property of the family was supported by the Senate personally. Now that the Senate needs to use money and asks us to lend money, can we say the word 'no'? If outsiders knew, wouldn't the Senate lose all face..."

The old Zhang couple fell into silence. Their son's words made sense. Indeed, if they didn't buy this bond, the Senate wouldn't necessarily do anything to them, but in the future, they would no longer be the Senate's "own people."

They couldn't bear such consequences.

"I think this bond is no problem. Why would the Senate deceive us? To put it bluntly, we are tied together with the Senate; there is absolutely no logic in specifically pitting us first. Moreover, buying bonds gives the qualification to enter Nanyang Company stocks later. This Nanyang Company is for the Senate's specialized Nanyang trade. Dad, think about how many ships the Senate has? And they are invincible at sea. Won't the Nanyang trade be controlled by the Senate in the future? With the Senate's ability to make money, if we enter the Nanyang Company's stock later, how much money can we earn?" Zhang Yu tried his best to persuade.

Father Zhang said: "A'Yu, I trust the Senate. I can tell you the family's foundation. I secretly saved a sum of money, originally intended to buy sand fields over in Dongguan—the newly reclaimed sand fields there are very cheap, only three silver dollars a *mu*. I planned to buy a hundred *mu* as the family's root. Since you have an urgent use now, take it first."
