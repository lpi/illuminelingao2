# Chapter 178: Silhouettes on the Sea

The Executive Committee's weekly meeting was underway aboard *Fengcheng*. Originally held in the Executive Committee compound's conference room, now departments with adequate facilities took turns hosting. Currently the Agricultural Committee, Navy Department, Health Department, and Communications Center rotated. The latter had just completed a three-story communications building.

Committee members, department heads, and advisors had just enjoyed milk-and-honey ice cream topped with tropical fruit cubes—the honey and fruit brought back by the Long-Range Exploration Team.

Just as everyone was eating contentedly, someone burst through the door.

"Everyone! Ship's radar detected an approaching fleet!"

Chen reacted fastest. "Who's on radar watch?"

Two minutes later, the mobile connected to Le Lin.

"Report target position and count?"

"Uh, in the screen's lower right corner..."

"I don't mean that. Report bearing, distance, speed."

"Ah..." Le Lin was stunned. He'd never used radar, much less read targets from a radar screen. The other watch personnel were equally confused.

"Get Meng De!"

"He's not here—"

"Where is he?!" Chen Haiyang started to flare, then remembered today wasn't Meng De's shift. "I'm coming."

Everyone rushed over. The screen showed five or six blips, moving very slowly, not heading toward Bopu Harbor. The cargo ship's collision avoidance radar displayed intuitive planimetry. Referencing land reflection waves, Chen Haiyang roughly estimated: targets about six nautical miles east of the harbor.

"What kind of ships?"

"One's fairly large, hundred-ton class." Chen Haiyang studied the radar screen, then grabbed the radio to call Li Di on the tower, asking about sea observations.

"No moonlight, can't observe. Should I use the searchlight?"

"No, not yet." At six nautical miles, the searchlight wouldn't reach. He looked at Ming Qiu. "You think this could be infiltration?"

Ming Qiu nodded. "Moonless, starless night like this is exactly right for infiltration."

Transmigrator control over Bopu was limited. Whether tower observation posts or beach hidden sentries, there were always observation blind spots. Not to mention the extensive coastal mangroves—natural infiltration corridors.

"Send people with night vision equipment to search the beach."

"Bei Wei has a recon detachment stationed here. I'll call him immediately."

Ma Qianzhu saw they were handling things well. Nothing for him to add. He had a feeling: as Chief of Staff, he counted for little with the Navy. Ma Qianzhu found the Army officers in their uniform Year-One military dress more likable than these people wearing various national and era naval uniforms—not as much showy pretense. When ice cream was served earlier, he'd noticed sailors wearing white gloves. Always posing.

"Should we bring over an infantry platoon?" Ma Qianzhu suggested.

"Yes. We only have one Marine Company here, and they have to man ships. Not enough personnel." Chen Haiyang was straightforward. This at least reassured Ma Qianzhu—Army-Navy disputes hadn't reached the point of obstruction.

After waiting a while, radar showed the ships continuing at 2-3 knots, slowly sailing along the Leizhou Peninsula side, with no other unusual activity.

At night, the Navy couldn't send ships for inspection. They decided to intensify observation while adding hidden sentries at key locations.

After the meeting, Wu De declined the invitation to stay overnight on *Fengcheng*. He preferred the Bopu camp—ship berths were too small.

The Bopu camp now resembled a proper base. Tents had been replaced by rows of brick-and-tile buildings. Roads were leveled. Roadside biogas lamps illuminated the camp brightly—a facility even Bairren Fortress lacked. Bairren's biogas pool was larger, but the cafeteria consumed most of it. The beach's primitive natural bath had also disappeared. Though Wu De had long moved to Bairren Commune, his D-Day Indian-style tent near the Bopu infirmary had been preserved. Every Bopu visit, he'd clear weeds or clean the tent, staying several days—like a vacation. The environment was genuinely nice. Exit the woods and there's beach and reef, sheltered and sunny, mosquito-free.

Passing the still-lit Bopu infirmary—this medical tent had become a two-story brick-and-wood building—the path to his "villa" had been carefully paved with gravel. He smiled awkwardly. Being an official had its perks.

The "villa" was no longer an Indian tent but a more comfortable thatched cottage. Hand-built: wooden beams and pillars, woven bamboo lattice walls, exterior straw-mud plaster, interior bamboo-strip lining, earthen floor, thick new-straw roof emitting fresh fragrance. His rural grass-house skills hadn't atrophied. The seaside wall had a straw-roofed veranda with a brick fire pit. When tired of cafeteria food, he'd cook something wild here, also entertaining compatible friends. The table and bed inside were from the Women's Cooperative's confiscated-goods sale—sturdy and durable.

The cottage was immaculate, items sparse but organized. A porcelain vase stood incongruously on the table—worth at least 100,000 RMB in another spacetime—now stuffed with wildflowers. Wu De knew this was Chuyu's work. Since this girl first visited Bopu with him, she'd come every few days to tidy his villa.

Chuyu, since arriving at his side, acted completely devoted. She attended to his daily life with great care. Several times she'd lingered in his bedroom at night with flushed cheeks. But Wu De hadn't made any moves. Not that he was impervious to temptation. But Chuyu looked too young—he couldn't bring himself to. Besides, nobody else had a "domestic secretary" yet; being first with a woman would look bad.

Coming off the ship, he felt hungry. Ma Qianzhu said he wanted to come drink and chat. Might as well catch some seafood—he hadn't had any in a while. Wu De stretched, removed his jacket and hung it up. From under the bed, he pulled out a wooden chest, opening the lock. Besides sleeping bag and camping gear, it contained complete wilderness survival emergency supplies, all meticulously organized. At the bottom: a black canvas gun bag containing a Type-56 semiautomatic rifle and two boxes of ammunition. If anything happened, he could grab his pack and gun and survive independently. In these times, trust the organization—but trust yourself more.

From the chest, he took a kerosene lamp, a 2-meter cast net. Attach two sturdy poles with weighted stones, and it was ready. About to leave, he saw Ma Qianzhu strolling over, carrying a rattan basket.

"What's that?"

"Wine. Waiting for your midnight snack."

"Sure. Wait a bit."

He went to the bay with the net, wading waist-deep, stretched the net and drove the poles deep into the mud. He fetched stones from shore to weight the poles. Hung the lamp on one pole just waiting for crabs. This was a bandit net—mesh as fine as a sieve. Even great white sharks would be doomed; small fish trapped instantly, large fish tangled tighter. Best of all, nylon netting never rotted, requiring no maintenance.

Smoking a cigarette on the shore, then checking the net—already seven or eight crabs caught. He put on thick canvas gloves, extracted the crabs, strung fish and crabs on a willow twig, harvested some oysters from the bay, and returned to the villa.

Back at the veranda, he hung the lamp and added wood to the fire pit. Flames rose.

"No pot or oil and salt here. Just roasted crab."

He set up a metal roasting rack on stones. Crabs, split open, roasted shell-side-down. Oysters went directly on top. Soon several oysters popped open, steaming. A fresh fragrance wafted.

"Come, drink." Ma Qianzhu poured into enamel cups—local yellow wine, low alcohol, just average taste. Wu De could make wine and had brought wine yeast, but grain was still a strategic resource. Before the first transmigrator harvest, making wine was premature.

They mainly discussed Army-Navy disputes. Wu De was equally perceptive. Though no incidents yet and coordination was smooth, the warning signs were there.

"This is just the beginning," Wu De said slowly, drinking. "Right now army scale is small, resources are sufficient. Once we enter expansion phase, watch the drama."

"I also sense the military is becoming somewhat uncontrollable." Ma Qianzhu stared into the flames, speaking quietly. "Especially the Navy."

"Mm." Though his background made Wu De reluctant to criticize the Navy, he shared Ma Qianzhu's feeling.

"We have Internal Security now—" Wu De said.

"Only 20 people. Not much use. Must focus on power balance."

"Internal Affairs Department?"

"Mm." Ma Qianzhu casually tossed an oyster shell aside. "Without reining in the military, having a military government would be laughable!"

"Not that dramatic." Wu De tensed internally. He wasn't a democracy advocate, but military rule was obviously bad news.

"I'm thinking of talking more with Ming Qiu. He's a veteran, former Party member. He should have this awareness. With him supervising, the Navy's young hotheads won't get too out of hand."

"I agree!" Wu De concurred. "For the Army, you can talk to He Ming."

"Right. So I also hope you'll play a bigger role. You're ex-Navy too." Ma Qianzhu spoke earnestly.

So that's what you were leading to, Wu De thought. But that was his intention anyway. He readily agreed.

"Actually, don't be too paranoid. Everyone's quite decent. Though there are disputes, it's all for the collective, no selfish motives. In decades, this is the first time I've seen such a united group." Wu De said. "Today's battle went well. Army performed admirably. Captured many prisoners."

Ma Qianzhu snorted: "That's actually what I wanted to discuss." He picked up a crab leg, blew on it, and started nibbling. "This victory was strange."
