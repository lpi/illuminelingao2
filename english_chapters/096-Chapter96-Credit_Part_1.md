# Chapter 96: Credit (Part 1)

Receiving the call, Wu Nanhai quickly had the stove relit to cook. Hainan's autumn temperatures rarely dropped below 25–26°C, and days often reached nearly 30°C. To prevent spoilage, the Cafeteria Office only cooked to daily ration amounts with a slight surplus. The cafeteria had some night-shift food, but nowhere near enough for this demand. He urgently recalled resting staff. While cooking, he had Hu Yicheng tally the needed food.

A full pot of rice was made and immediately sent to the camp. Thirty servings disappeared instantly. Seeing that this paper could actually buy rice, no one bought porridge—everyone surged to buy rice. Hu Yicheng watched in disbelief as they wolfed down plain white rice—with no vegetables or anything else. He remembered childhood stories of poor people's struggles—protagonists who "ate rice with soy sauce" already seemed inhuman. Now these people had no soy sauce—not even a grain of salt.

Another fellow squeezed forward, thrusting his large wooden bowl before him, clutching a work-point voucher. His words were unclear, but obviously meant "one bowl of rice." Hu Yicheng shook his head and ladled another bowl—this guy seemed to be on his fourth. Quite the powerhouse.

Xiong Buyou edged nervously toward Wu De, whispering: "Old Wu, isn't this too much eating? Won't they burst?"

Wu De shook his head. "Don't worry—farmers can eat. Back home, old-timers often ate a *jin* per meal. Because their meals had no oil, their appetites were big."

As rice consumption slowed, more people bought salted fish—apparently wanting to treat themselves after filling up. Unfortunately, Wu Nanhai's cafeteria was out of salted fish.

"No more salted fish—sold out!" Hu Yicheng shouted. "Buy tomorrow—today's gone."

Hearing this, many looked disappointed. The earlier commotion gradually died down.

"Out of fish?" Wu De ran over to ask.

"Yes—the cafeteria's completely out. We need to get more from Bopu tomorrow." The Agriculture Committee had a seafood-processing plant there.

"Nothing at all?"

Hu Yicheng spread his hands: "Even borrowed the Military Group's night-shift food for you. I'll prepare more tomorrow—that salted fish isn't popular in the cafeteria anyway."

"The fish was killed once when caught, then killed again by your cooking," Xiong Buyou said solemnly.

Watching the dispersing crowd, Wu De instructed Lin Xing: "Tell everyone not to leave. Calculate how much they want—we'll fetch the goods immediately!"

Hu Yicheng rushed to say: "This won't work. It's almost dark—how can we go to Bopu now?!"

"I'll go personally." Wu De saw this as a perfect opportunity to establish credit. For both work-point vouchers and these "pirates" to truly gain locals' trust, they must keep their word—especially on small matters, where proper attitude mattered most.

"Too dangerous." Xiong Buyou tried to dissuade him. "In half an hour it'll be dark—the road has no streetlights. Unsafe."

"No problem. Use a vehicle." Wu De directly called Civil Affairs Commissioner Xiao Zishan, explained the situation, and requested a vehicle to Bopu. Per Military Group security regulations, from half an hour before dark until dawn, no person or vehicle could use the road.

"Fetch salted fish?!" Xiao Zishan asked incredulously. "Just for a bucket of salted fish?"

"Yes! Very important."

"Are you joking? Just have a passing vehicle bring it tomorrow—sending a special vehicle? It's almost dark; even in broad daylight this wouldn't be appropriate. Isn't this wasteful?"

"This isn't waste!" Wu De explained his reasoning in detail, analyzing the positive response this would generate.

"True, but even one night's delay won't collapse our credit. Stores run out of stock too—we don't need to go this far."

"Whether it's necessary, I know very well!" Wu De grew irritated. These bureaucrats didn't understand how hard winning hearts was. Salted fish tomorrow would be fine—but the effect wouldn't be as good as tonight. Trust took enormous effort to build; such opportunities shouldn't be missed.

"Alright then." Hearing his insistence, Xiao Zishan finally relented, assigning a Beijing 212. He added: since they were going, bring more things back—"Don't waste the trip."

The jeep drove toward Bopu in the evening sunset. Wu De drove personally, with Wu Nanhai beside him—he wanted to check the seafood plant's production.

In the car, Wu Nanhai requested some farmers be transferred from the Labor Group to the Agriculture Committee—not as collective workers, but as permanent Committee employees.

"Probably fine. I'll request approval from the Committee—if agreed, I'll assign you a few. They're all actively requesting to join."

"Can they farm?"

"Of course—Lingao commoners are basically farmers, except that Zhang Xingjiao."

"Actually, I'd prefer some children—I can train them myself." Wu Nanhai shifted his SKS—the cramped jeep made it awkward.

"No problem. Here's inside information." Wu De feigned mystery. "They're about to send people to Guangzhou."

Wu Nanhai was startled: "How do you know? I'm a Committee member."

"Don't forget I'm from Military Group." Wu De smirked. "Military Group people know everything now—they're notifying Xi Yazhou to select security personnel. And apparently he's going too."

"Beiwei would be better."

"Beiwei trains troops daily—he can't leave. And no one's more suitable for the military core." Wu De saw the first watchtower ahead; guards were signaling with lights. He flashed his headlights in response—their route had been communicated to all pillboxes along the way.

"He has business experience. We veterans never did commerce—that's his advantage. Plus he's very enthusiastic."

"Then I'd better prepare a shopping list." Wu Nanhai quickly pulled out a notebook and started writing.

"Don't rush—several key Committee members are still debating whether to go to Guangzhou. But it seems unavoidable now."

"That's extreme. Unavoidable?"

"Not extreme at all. Let me tell you more inside info." Wu De lowered his voice. "You know that Big White Mare?"

"Yes—some American agent, right?"

"She's now assigned to Public Security Group—teaching classes, training. A few days ago, someone almost—" Wu De smiled mysteriously.

"Almost what?" Wu Nanhai tensed. "Killed her?"

"There are five hundred young men here poisoned by Japanese AV, living boring lives in these 17th-century wilds. What do you think they'd try?"

Wu Nanhai suddenly understood—immediately feeling disbelief.

"How is that possible!"

"It was possible—but that woman has skills. He didn't succeed." Wu De sighed. "Now she's become the Committee's hot potato."

"Are they arresting anyone?"

"Of course not." Wu De shook his head. "Not worth antagonizing people over a foreigner. Ran Yao knew who did it by the next day."

"That's not right," Wu Nanhai said disapprovingly. "In any time-space, this is a literal crime! The Committee is enabling this—it's a dangerous precedent."

"Pursue it? Remember what was decided at the general assembly? 'Everyone is equal, but transmigrators are more equal than others.'"

"Right. So we should protect transmigrators' interests—blatantly assaulting a comrade, a woman—" Wu Nanhai suddenly stopped. *Was Salina a transmigrator?!*

"You've realized." Wu De spoke meaningfully. "Seven people are accidental stowaways—not transmigrators."

"We can absorb them. Why not? They're from the 21st century like us. Since they're here, they can only build with us."

"The problem is she's a foreigner. 'Those not of our kind will have different hearts'—many think this way."

"But—" Wu Nanhai found this reasoning weak. "Even if we can't trust her, there's no need to... that..."

Wu De chuckled: "Indeed excessive. After this incident, the Committee finally decided to send people to Guangzhou ASAP."

Wu Nanhai suddenly got goosebumps: "My god—to buy women?!"

Wu De smiled mysteriously, kept driving—essentially confirming.

"But I have zero interest in this timespace's women. If I want a woman, I'll raise her from a loli."

"For me, having a woman to cook and do laundry would be satisfying." Wu De sighed. "This doing my own laundry, eating cafeteria food—when will it end..."

Chatting, they quickly reached Bopu, grabbed several buckets of salted fish, strapped them to the vehicle, and headed back. Night had fallen; the road was pitch black. Driving with headlights wasn't too hard; pillbox lights along the way served as guiding beacons. They returned smoothly to camp.

The dispersed laborers were reassembled. A bucket of salted fish was opened. Wu De announced robustly: open supply—buy as much as you want. Workers hesitated; not many stepped forward. Some carefully wrapped remaining vouchers in rags, hiding them in clothing. Ma Peng was one—he thought, when there's a chance, he'd bring his family here for a good meal.
