# Chapter 2531: Taking Office

*Splash...* In the white mist-filled large bathhouse, naked bodies appeared indistinctly, with sounds of water and voices rising and falling. This was a newly built public bathhouse following the growing prosperity of East Gate Market. No one expected that the showering procedure of the Port Purification Camp would turn into a social fashion in Lingao.

Chen Wuren leaned against the tiled wall, counting the scars on his body one by one with his rough hands, letting the hot water from the showerhead wash over his body as if trying to wash away the misfortunes of a lifetime. He lost his father in childhood and his mother when he reached the age of binding hair. He lived a life of depending on others since he was young. The few *mu* of good fields in his family were almost snatched away by others; he only survived to adulthood relying on the relief of his clan. Although he was destitute, he believed he still had some chivalrous spirit. He hindered the eldest branch of the clan from "eating the extinct household" [seizing the property of a relative with no male heir] and was framed and presented with a lawsuit. It never rains but it pours; the Li family, under the pretext of reclaiming new floating sand flats to pay military rations, forcibly occupied his remaining land. His ancestors shared the same lineage as the famous Chen Zizhuang, but the connection was very distant. In a moment of crisis, he could only run around and plead, placing hope that the renowned Master Qiutao could help a bit, even if just for the sake of him surnamed Chen.

However, the doorman of the Chen residence drove him away like a beggar. He squatted and guarded near the Chen residence for half a month but never managed to encounter Chen Zizhuang. Later, he heard that the father and two sons were all away serving as officials. It happened that his youngest son caught smallpox and he had no money for treatment, so he could only watch helplessly as his son died with his whole body ulcerating. Since then, the couple and their daughter wandered the streets. When they had no food, he thought about selling his wife and daughter, but could never harden his heart.

Later, he met a group of strange people who said they were recruiting hands to reclaim wasteland in Qiongzhou, providing food and shelter. He took his wife and daughter to follow them to Lingao. Starting from farming, he learned to read with the Australians, later became a worker, and slowly got promoted. Life was getting better day by day. Just when he thought the rest of his life would be a broad road, he succeeded the unlucky former factory manager of the Ice Cream Factory... and then came the first large-scale collective food poisoning incident in Lingao under the rule of the Senate.

After being imprisoned, his heart was like dead ashes, believing his fate offended the Heavenly Sha star and this was his destiny. When his wife brought their daughter to visit him in prison, he persuaded her to remarry early and not wait any longer.

This imprisonment lasted four years.

Thinking of this, Chen Wuren sighed endlessly. Worldly affairs were truly impermanent; the day before he was a prisoner in the labor reform camp, and now he had escaped that cage.

The Chief was surnamed Zhang. His impression was: young and handsome. In his office, Chief Zhang looked out the window, his back to him, and asked, "Why do you think you suffered this disaster?"

Chen Wuren thought for a long time. With a thousand words, he didn't know where to start. After holding it in for half a day, a few words popped out of his mouth: "It's just fate."

"What a 'resignation to fate'!" Zhang Xiao shook his head and turned around. "Wuren, Wuren [Five Benevolences], you really are like your name. Mercy does not command soldiers, righteousness does not manage wealth. You, ah, your mistake lies in this 'Ren' [Benevolence]. Australian sages have a saying: 'Character determines destiny'..."

Chen Wuren lowered his head, quietly listening to the wise sayings of the Australian sages spoken by Zhang Xiao, daring not to breathe loudly.

"Do you still have family?" Zhang Xiao asked.

"Replying to the Chief, this humble one's parents died early, and I have no brothers or sisters. I persuaded my wife to remarry after the disaster. There is also a daughter; calculating, she should be fifteen years old, the age to be betrothed." Chen Wuren answered.

"Do you know why I fished you out?"

"I truly do not know!" Chen Wuren considered the ruler's might unpredictable and dared not speculate wildly.

"Mn," Zhang Xiao nodded. "You can be counted as an old cadre of the Senate. Do you know how many resources the Senate spends to train a cadre? Now is the time when the Senate needs people. You should be taking on more important work in a more effective post, not wasting time here."

"This humble one has no virtue and no ability and has let down the Senate's cultivation..." Chen Wuren answered hurriedly, his voice full of self-blame.

"Alright, you understand the Senate's rules; no need for 'Great Person' and 'Humble One'," Zhang Xiao interrupted him without waiting for him to finish. "I give you three days to handle personal affairs. Then follow me north to Guangzhou. If there are things to do or things to prepare, handle them properly yourself." After giving instructions, Zhang Xiao placed a Delong note and an exceptionally beautifully patterned boat ticket on the table.

"Your wife and child are still waiting for you at home; hurry back and see them."

There was light in Chen Wuren's eyes. In an instant, he burst into tears, knelt on the ground with a thud, and knocked his head. "Thank you, Chief, for the great grace. I will definitely live up to expectations, go through fire and water without hesitation. If the Chief tells me to go east, I will absolutely not go west!"

"Stop washing, stop washing! If you wash more, the skin will come off!" The bathhouse worker's impatient and rough roar pulled him back to reality from his memories, disliking that he had showered for too long and wasted hot water.

"Blind Zhang's fortune-telling is really accurate!" Chen Wuren thought. He just didn't know his whereabouts now; otherwise, he would definitely give him a big red packet.

Three days later, Bopu Military Port. The pier was crowded with people seeing others off.

As the steam whistle sounded "Woo woo," the Senate Special Ship "Nemesis" slowly left the port. The buildings and figures on the shore gradually became smaller and smaller. Although Zhang Xiao had traveled to Guangzhou on business from time to time in recent years, this was the first time he was leaving Lingao for a long time. He glanced at his old comrades, old workers, and students behind him, suddenly remembered something, ran quickly to the stern, cup his hands around his mouth like a trumpet, and shouted loudly: "Comrades, the scale of the penicillin and streptomycin production lines is sufficient; the focus is on reducing contamination during the fermentation process. Sweet wormwood must be harvested in July to be good. Sulfonamide is a basic variety; you must pay attention to energy saving and consumption reduction to lower costs. For chemical engineering basics, you must read BSL's *Transport Phenomena*. Our reaction engineering is still very weak; consider elementary reactions first to get the reactor running. For electrochemistry, reading Bard is enough. John Newman's book is on the third shelf of my bookshelf; read the starred chapters first..."

Halfway through shouting, Zhang Xiao's nose suddenly soured, and tears actually swirled in his eye sockets. He was choked with silent sobs for a moment, not knowing what to say. After a while, he shouted: "Goodbye! Comrades, I miss you!"

Lin Motian, who was traveling with him, silently patted Zhang Xiao's shoulder and handed him a tissue. "Seeing you usually calm, rational, and vigorous, I didn't expect you to be a man of emotion too."

"Carl Jung believed that everyone wears different personas, protecting both the self and society." Zhang Xiao defended himself intentionally or unintentionally.

"Your team is really interesting. Look at who you brought? Some fished out from labor camps, some dragged down due to epidemic prevention errors, some who caused medical accidents in hospitals. I see it's almost becoming a 'Suicide Squad.' Then raising the pirate flag, singing the 'Song of Pests,' and entering the city—I estimate all the snakes, insects, rats, and ants here will flee..." Lin Motian started to joke.

Zhang Xiao took out two books from his backpack and said seriously, "Zheng Mingjiang and I once went to various state-owned food factories for inspections. Man, Machine, Material, Method, Environment—the five items—the Ice Cream Factory was actually okay in horizontal comparison. Why did accidents happen frequently? You know the biggest risk point is still in 'Man.' Chen Wuren was nothing more than lax in supervising subordinates. And Wu Shuyi, who did quarantine in Guangzhou—do you know how much cargo clears customs every day in this Number One City South of the Sky? With our conditions, even if you, Old Lin, went personally, there would be a day when you slip up. Besides, Lei En personally recommended him; can I not give him face? There is no trash in the world, only misplaced resources. I say unceremoniously, these people belong to the qualified level within the Senate's cadre group."

Lin Motian nodded and glanced at the titles of the books in Zhang Xiao's hands: one was *The Dictator's Handbook*, the other *Research on Mulberry Dike Fish Pond Agriculture in Xiqiao*. "You really prepared to promote Mulberry Dike Fish Ponds?"

Seeing this, Zhang Xiao explained, "The general trend of the world is mighty; those who follow it prosper, those who go against it perish. The Mulberry Dike Fish Pond was an important agricultural form developed in the Pearl River Delta in the late Ming. For us to boost the rapid popularization of this advanced production method is to conform to the tide of the times. Not only must we do it, but we must also do it big. I also heard about Li Yao'er's matter. I only say this because it's just the two of us in private: her experiment in Xiangshan bodes ill."

"Oh?" Lin Motian was somewhat disbelieving. After all, Li Yao'er had practiced sericulture with Zhao Yingong in Hangzhou and had rich frontline experience, while Zhang Xiao was neither in agriculture nor had raised silkworms.

"I knew you wouldn't believe it." Zhang Xiao smiled. "What is our most precious thing? It's not the Minié rifle, nor the steam engine, but the historical experience ahead by four hundred years. The great stock market leek Isaac Newton once said: 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.' Innovation is certainly important, but ignoring the experience of predecessors and working behind closed doors might be counterproductive."

"You mean..."

"Correct, the answer is right here." Zhang Xiao shook the book in his hand. This was a collection of materials he copied from the Grand Library. Relying on his relationship with the Grand Library, he copied quite a few materials to take away this time.

"Where is the problem?"

"The emergence of a production form inevitably has its unique economic laws behind it, and these economic laws depend on the combination of labor, land, capital, policy, and other factors. Simply put, historically, the Mulberry Dike Fish Pond developed with Jiujiang in the south of Xiqiao Mountain as the first ring. The second ring still expanded centered on Jiujiang to the surroundings of Xiqiao Mountain. The center of the sericulture area in the third ring during the Daoguang reign moved south to Rongqi and Guizhou in Shunde, but still within the scope of Xiqiao. Moreover, this was only able to break through the original pattern under the continuous stimulation of international silk trade for over a hundred years, creating the craze of 'abandoning rice to plant mulberries, destroying fields to form ponds' in the Pearl River Delta. Jiancun Fort in Xiqiao, where Chen Qiyuan founded the Jichanglong Filature, was also a newly opened area in this wave of craze. According to the data from the land survey in the Wanli reign, Nanhai County had 48,000 *mu* of taxed fish ponds, while Xiangshan County only had 711 *mu*. That she ran to Xiangshan to do it can only be said to be abandoning the root to pursue the tip; the objective conditions are very poor."
