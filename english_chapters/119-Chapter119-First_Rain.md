# Chapter 119: First Rain

Gou Buli was quite clever—he followed up skillfully, putting on a pained expression:

"At that time, I was steaming *baozi* for Young Master Gou. Seeing him like that, I begged this steward—said: If the young master doesn't want the leftovers, can you give them to the tenant-farmers outside? Let everyone share some Gou family blessings. But who knew—who knew—" He adopted a look of aggrieved fury:

"This man actually said: their family name is 'Gou' *(meaning 'dog')*—so even their dogs are nobler than outside tenant-farmers!"

This drew a stir below. The crowd's anger was successfully aroused. In an age of scarcity, deliberately wasting food was a terrible crime. People shouted: "Kill this villain!" "Hang him alongside a dog—let them share blessings!"

The kinsman gasped desperately—couldn't make a sound—face turning crimson.

Gou Buli, seeing the effect, pressed the advantage, shouting at the half-old man: "What are you glaring at?! With short-hair masters as our blue-sky protectors, we common folk don't fear you villains! No more Gou family riding our heads, shitting and pissing on us!"

He rolled up his sleeves, stripped off his shirt—revealing old and new whip-marks covering his body: "Everyone—this year I roasted a sweet-potato in the kitchen. This fellow saw it—said I was stealing their horse-feed. I said: your horse-feed is all golden millet and beans—what coarse stuff? Where would I steal that? Just for that remark, he reported to Gou Xunyi. Beat me near to death, threw me in the dungeon. If the short-hair masters hadn't opened the dungeon-door, I'd have died in there for nothing—" Recalling dungeon torments, tears flowed appropriately.

By now the crowd below was weeping. Wu De, pleased by the effect, knew Gou Buli's account was part-truth, part-fiction. He whispered to Xi Yazhou: "Isn't this too hypocritical?"

Xi Yazhou shook his head: "Actually, the real stories are far worse. Look—the masses are crying. That's resonance. If the Gou family hadn't done evil and ruined people, would they cry? Right now, people still don't dare speak. Those who dare can't articulate well. Gou Buli may be fabricating, but he's bold and eloquent—stirs emotions, helps them break through their shackles."

Wu De felt uneasy. He was older than Xi Yazhou's generation—had witnessed political storms launched through mass movements. What consequences might mass movements have? He wasn't sure. Seeing Wu De's skeptical expression, Xi Yazhou said: "Great undertakings can't sweat small details. Mobilizing the masses is paramount. Let's keep watching."

Just then, someone approached, whispering: "A maidservant wants to see the person in charge."

Wu De was puzzled—why would a maidservant want to see him? He quickly spoke to Xi Yazhou, then went with several men.

Gou family male and female servants—excluding guards—numbered 100–200. Their backgrounds were complex—not easily sorted. Temporarily, they were detained separately by gender in two courtyards. Earlier, based on Zhang Xingjiao's list, some powerful servants had been taken to the struggle meeting.

The maidservant requesting the meeting was named Chuyu ("First Rain"). She'd been personal attendant to Gou Xunyi's most-favored Seventh Concubine. When the manor fell, Gou Xunyi's wives and concubines had all—forced or willing—hanged themselves. Some maids had also committed suicide in the chaos. This girl, unwilling to die for her usually harsh mistress—and having seen the short-hairs didn't harm women—lost all death-wish. Perceptive and quick-witted, knowing some Mandarin, she'd heard various rumors about these short-hairs. Seeing these young "pirates"—tall, strong, light-footed, confident without arrogance—utterly different from masters' pompous swagger or servants' timid cringing—she couldn't help feeling some admiration.

She considered her situation. Sold by fleeing famine-victims to this county—resold multiple times before landing as a Gou-family maid. Though Seventh Concubine's personal attendant, that mistress was impossibly demanding and harsh. Life beside her was daily torment. Alone in the world—no ties—she'd only hoped someday to marry a servant or tenant, live peacefully. But Gou-family maids never married—some were still unwed at forty or fifty. *(Note: This was "chained bondage"—keeping maids unmarried, in service until death. Common in many places since the Ming, apparently for economic reasons. Even then, considered inhumane.)*

Now the Gou family was finished. She needed to plan her future. These short-hairs professed righteousness—no looting or killing after taking the manor, respectful toward women. They'd even assigned a short-hair female supervisor with good heart and attention to detail. Servants weren't important—in a few days, most would probably be released to go home. She had no home. She needed an exit strategy. After thinking, she decided to offer her secret knowledge as tribute. Plan set, she approached Du Wen—on duty supervising—during a bathroom break, quietly requesting.

Du Wen had long planned the mass meeting—couldn't attend herself—frustrating. Now an "oppressed class-sister" volunteered to expose secrets—perfect! She was about to have her speak right there—but this First Rain stubbornly insisted on seeing "the person in charge."

"I am in charge." Du Wen tried.

"Big or small charges—you're definitely not the main charge!" The girl was unintimidated—quite feisty.

"Why not?!"

"Because you're a woman! What woman is ever main charge?!"

This left Du Wen speechless—mentally cursing "no consciousness, head full of patriarchal feudal thinking"—but helplessly summoned Wu De.

Chuyu, guided by Du Wen, entered the interview room. She knelt, kowtowed, head bowed: "This slave First Rain pays respects to Master."

Head lowered, Wu De couldn't see her face clearly—but her tall figure and composed manner already pleased him. After so long in this era, here was a rare woman matching modern aesthetics.

He asked with a smile: "You're the girl who wanted to see me?"

"Yes. This slave."

"What do you want to tell me?" Wu De picked up preliminary interrogation records—this girl was Seventh Concubine's personal maid. "You were Seventh Concubine's attendant. She's dead now—are you grieving?"

This question seemed dangerous. She replied carefully: "Years together as mistress and servant—this slave isn't made of grass and wood. How could I not feel sorry?"

She said "sorry"—not "grief"—indicating the distinction.

"You don't look that sad."

Chuyu kowtowed, answered with composure: "This slave served Seventh Concubine, running and sweeping diligently every day—repaying her kindness for food and shelter. Master-servant bonds end there."

In other words: my work matched my wages. Company's bankrupt now. Some sadness, sure. Regret? Not really.

Wu De nodded approvingly—privately praised her. Then said: "First Rain, lift your head."

She boldly raised her head—let Wu De see her features—also took the chance to observe him. She saw this manor-conquering short-hair master was middle-aged, regular features, heavy brows, piercing eyes, dark skin, strong and powerful. Her heart stirred. Fearing his direct gaze, she lowered her head again.

Wu De's first impression: roughly eighteen or nineteen—a teenager. In modern times, still in middle school. Yet her demeanor showed steady self-possession. He asked:

"What do you want to tell us?"

"Gou Xunyi's study has a secret vault. Have the masters discovered it?"

"Secret vault?" Wu De and Du Wen exclaimed together. They'd searched the entire compound—but hadn't found any study vault.

"Correct. In the inner study—behind the paneling is a hidden vault. It stores important correspondence, account-books, and valuables."

A major discovery! Wu De knew: gold and silver were secondary. This major pirate-den's secret letters and ledgers would reveal crucial details. Communication in this era was extremely closed-off—Guangdong news often took a month to reach the county. Local conditions could only be researched in history books.

He nodded: "How do you know this?"

"This slave was Seventh Concubine's personal maid. Master often summoned Seventh Concubine to the inner study for sleeping. This slave waited in the outer room. Occasionally—occasionally—" She blushed slightly—showing a maiden's bashfulness. Wu De, the middle-aged man, also felt stirred. Then he remembered: this child was old enough to be his daughter. Mustn't lose control. He nodded:

"Since you're willing to share such secrets, what do you want? Whatever valuables we recover, we'll reward you handsomely—then escort you home."

"This slave only asks Master to keep me as a servant. This slave has no family or kin. Even with gold and silver—where would I go? Please keep and use me!" She kowtowed again with calm dignity.

This embarrassed Wu De—a young girl volunteering as his maid. Such good fortune—first time in his life. Of course he couldn't agree. Ignoring hundreds of sexually-frustrated otaku, Du Wen beside him would probably iron-leg-kick him. Fortunately, they'd already planned for this: homeless servants would all be taken in.

"Very well. Sisters with nowhere to go—we'll naturally keep and employ you all. Rest easy! Lead us to open the vault."
