# Chapter 119 - First Rain

This Gou Buli was very clever. Instead of stopping, he followed the stick like a snake, pretending to look heartbroken and said: "At that time, I was steaming buns for Young Master Gou. Seeing him like this, I even begged this managing clan master, saying: If the young master doesn't eat, the leftovers can be awarded to the tenants outside, letting everyone share some of the Gou family's rain and dew. Who knew, who knew—" He put on a look of tearless grief and indignation:

"This person actually said, their family is surnamed 'Gou' (Dog), so even a dog is more noble than the tenants outside!"

These words caused a commotion below. The anger of the common people was indeed aroused. In an era of material scarcity, deliberately wasting food was a terrible crime. Someone shouted: "Beat this bad guy to death!" "Hang him with the dogs, share weal and woe together!"

This clan master panted anxiously but couldn't make a sound, his face turning red.

Seeing this scene, Gou Buli was very proud. Striking while the iron was hot, he roared at this half-old man: "What are you staring at me for! With such clear skies as the Short-haired Masters deciding for us small people, I'm not afraid of you villain! The days of your Gou family riding on our heads shitting and pissing are gone forever,"

Saying this, he pulled up his sleeves and took off his upper garment, revealing many new and old scars from torture: "Fellow villagers, this year I roasted a sweet potato under the kitchen to eat, but was seen by this old thing, who said I stole their family's horse feed. I said, your family's horse feed is all golden millet and beans, where is such coarse food, where would I steal it? Just for this sentence, he reported to Gou Xunyi, locked me in the earth prison and tortured me half to death. If the Short-haired Masters hadn't opened the prison door, I would have died in there in vain for these words—" Speaking of this, he probably also thought of the various sufferings of being locked in the earth prison, and shed tears at the right moment.

At this time, the audience below was already crying. Although Wu De was happy with such an effect, he knew that what Gou Buli said was half true and half false. He whispered to Xi Yazhou: "Is this too hypocritical?"

Xi Yazhou shook his head: "Actually, there are plenty of true stories much more miserable than this. Look, the masses are crying. This is resonance. If the Gou family hadn't done all kinds of bad things and harmed the common people miserably, would they cry? Now the common people still dare not talk about these. Those who dare to talk can't explain clearly. Although Gou Buli is making things up, he dares to speak and can speak. Mobilizing emotions helps them break through that shackle."

Wu De muttered in his heart. He was much older than people like Xi Yazhou and had seen many political storms started by mass movements with his own eyes. He wasn't sure what consequences mass movements would have. Seeing the disapproving look on Wu De's face, Xi Yazhou said: "Those who achieve great things don't stick to trifles. Mobilizing the masses is the most important thing right now. Let's continue listening."

Just as they were talking, suddenly someone came over and whispered: "A maid wants to see the manager."

Wu De was stunned, thinking why a maid wanted to see him for no reason. He hurriedly said a few words to Xi Yazhou and took a few people over.

The male and female servants of the Gou family, excluding the family guards, numbered one or two hundred. Their composition was relatively complex, and it was hard to screen them for a while, so they were temporarily detained separately by gender in two courtyards. Just now at the struggle meeting, a batch of evil servants who had power and influence on weekdays were taken away according to Zhang Xingjiao's list.

This maid who wanted to see him was named Chu Yu (First Rain). She was originally the personal maid of Gou Xunyi's most favored Seventh Concubine. When the stockade was broken, Gou Xunyi's wives and concubines either hanged themselves voluntarily or were forced to. Some maids also committed suicide in panic. This girl was unwilling to be buried with her usually harsh master. In addition, seeing that the short-hairs did not harm women after entering, she had no thought of death. She usually had a flexible and agile mind and could speak a few sentences of Mandarin. She knew more or less about the rumors of the short-hairs outside. Seeing these young "hair-shorn thieves" now, each tall and strong, with light footsteps, their gestures and conversation full of confidence, neither humble nor arrogant, completely different from the arrogant conceit of masters and young masters or the cautious humility of ordinary commoners and servants, she couldn't help but have some admiration in her heart.

She pondered in her heart. She was from a family fleeing famine from outside and was sold in this county. After being sold several times, she ended up as a maid in the Gou family. Although she was the personal maid of the Seventh Concubine, this Seventh Concubine was usually spoiled and extremely harsh to servants, beating and scolding them for the slightest dissatisfaction. Chu Yu felt like a year was a day by her side. She was all alone in this world with no attachments. She originally only hoped to be married to a servant or tenant in the future to live peacefully. Unexpectedly, the Gou family's maids never married. Some maids were forty or fifty years old and still unmarried, shattering her last hope. (Note: This is the so-called "Imprisoned Maids," where maids do not marry after growing up and serve until old age and death. Since the Ming Dynasty, many places had such customs, seemingly due to economic interests. Even at that time, it was considered inhumane.)

Now that the Gou family was broken, she had to think about her future. She thought these short-hairs always prided themselves on benevolence and righteousness. After breaking the stockade, they didn't loot or kill indiscriminately, and treated women very politely. They even specially assigned a female short-hair manager to guard them, who was not only kind-hearted but also attentive. Servants and maids like her were not important figures. Nine out of ten, they would be told to go home in a few days. She had no home to return to, so she had to find a way out for herself. After much thought, she decided to offer a secret she knew as a gift. Having made up her mind, she took the opportunity of going to the toilet to report quietly to Du Wen, who was responsible for guarding, in the corner of the courtyard.

Du Wen had been planning for the mass meeting for a long time but couldn't go to watch. She was feeling stifled when suddenly an "oppressed class sister" was willing to come and expose things. It really suited her taste. She was about to ask her to say it, but this Chu Yu stubbornly insisted on seeing the "manager" before speaking.

"I am the manager." Du Wen wouldn't give up.

"There are big and small managers. You are definitely not the big manager!" This girl was not afraid at all, showing quite a bold style.

"Why?!"

"Because you are a woman! Since when do women become big managers!"

These words choked Du Wen so much that her breath wasn't smooth, cursing inwardly "no awareness, a brain full of feudal male-superiority thoughts," but she had no choice but to send someone to call Wu De.

Chu Yu was led by Du Wen into the small conversation hall, knelt on both knees, kowtowed, and bowed her head saying: "Slave Chu Yu kowtows to the Master."

Because her head was lowered, Wu De didn't see her face clearly, but her tall figure and graceful demeanor already made him secretly satisfied. Being in this time and space for so long, this was a rare woman who relatively fit the aesthetic viewpoint of modern people.

He asked with a smile: "Are you the woman who wanted to see me?"

"Yes. It is this slave."

"What do you want with me?" Wu De said, picking up the preliminary interrogation record casually, knowing this woman was the Seventh Concubine's personal maid, "You were the Seventh Concubine's personal maid. She is dead now; are you sorrowful?"

To Chu Yu, these words contained dangerous elements, so she said with slight reserve:

"We were master and servant for many years. This slave is not grass or wood; how could there be no reason for pity." She didn't say sorrow, but pity, to show the difference.

"You don't look that sad?"

Chu Yu kowtowed and said gracefully: "This slave served the Seventh Concubine, running and cleaning with all my might every day, to repay the grace of food and shelter. The master-servant affection ends here."

The implication was that the work I did was worthy of the wages I received. Now that the company went bankrupt, a little sadness is inevitable, but deep grief is out of the question.

Wu De nodded in his heart, praising secretly, then said: "Chu Yu, raise your head."

Chu Yu raised her head boldly, letting Wu De see her appearance clearly. She also took the opportunity to size him up. She saw that this short-hair master who broke the stockade was in middle age, with regular features, a pair of thick eyebrows, piercing eyes, dark skin, and a strong body. Her heart moved involuntarily. Afraid of his direct gaze, she lowered her head again.

At first glance, Chu Yu looked like a girl of only eighteen or nineteen, probably still a high school student in modern times. But there was a calm and composed air between her eyebrows. He asked:

"What do you have to report to us?"

"There is a secret cabinet in Gou Xunyi's study. Have the masters found it?"

"Secret cabinet?" Wu De and Du Wen shouted in unison. They had searched everywhere in the Gou family residence, but this secret cabinet in the study hadn't been discovered.

"Yes, it's in the inner study. There is a secret cabinet behind the wainscoting there, storing important correspondence, account books, and valuables."

This was a major discovery! Wu De knew very well that gold, silver, and treasures were secondary. The secret correspondence and account books of this big harbor master colluding with pirates on the Guangdong ground would obviously let them know many details. News transmission in this time and space was very blocked. Things in Guangdong often took a month to reach the county, and they could only query various local situations from history books.

He nodded: "How do you know?"

"This slave was the Seventh Concubine's personal maid. Master Gou often summoned the Seventh Concubine to the inner study to sleep with him. This slave waited in the outer room as usual. Accidentally—accidentally—" As Chu Yu spoke, her face turned slightly red, showing the charming look of a girl just beginning to know love, making Wu De, a middle-aged man, also a bit unable to control himself. On second thought, this child was old enough to be his daughter; he shouldn't really be a beast. He nodded:

"Since you are willing to tell us such a secret, do you have any request? For the recovered property, we will reward you heavily and send people to escort you home."

"This slave only begs the Master to keep this slave by your side to serve. This slave has long had no relatives. Even with gold and silver, where can I go? Please, Master, take me in!" Chu Yu kowtowed again gracefully.

This made Wu De blush. It was really the first time in his life that a little girl volunteered to be his maid. Of course, this couldn't be agreed to. Not to mention a group of slightly sexually starved otakus wouldn't tolerate him, even Du Wen beside him would likely give him an iron leg kick. Fortunately, they had arrangements for this problem long ago: maids and servants with no home to return to would all be taken in.

"Easy to say. Sisters with nowhere to go, we will naturally take in and employ. Just be at ease! Take us to open the cabinet."
