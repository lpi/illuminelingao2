# Chapter 1331 - A Visit to Fangcao Di: The Return Journey

Seeing them all fall silent one by one, Transmigrator Dong knew this group hadn't yet let go of their pride. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly. Although traditional scholars had no value to the Council beyond their literacy, they still held symbolic value in influencing social attitudes. If these people could be transformed, it would have a positive effect on the Council's overall influence on society—and besides, there was indeed a shortage of educated people right now.

However, ideological transformation wasn't something that happened overnight. Transmigrator Dong had never held high hopes for their conversion anyway. For now, he just made some small talk to get past the moment.

Today was the Australian weekend, and local children could now be released from school to go home—since there was only one day off per week, it was especially precious. Outside the gates of Fangcao Di, a group of parents waited to pick up their children. Some families came with a great retinue of servants; some had specifically prepared sedan chairs; the wealthier ones even brought horse-drawn carriages.

Since Fangcao Di's educational philosophy was to eliminate students' family backgrounds, the school required students to wear uniforms uniformly, use standardized study and living supplies, and also had regulations for student pickup: only one person per student was allowed for pickup, and sedan chairs and carriages had to wait at least one hundred meters from the school gate.

Children from ordinary commoner and naturalized citizen families weren't so pampered—whether going to or from school, they walked on their own or rode the public horse-drawn carriages or small trains. Most of those who came to pick up children were from families at or above the middle class in the county, and quite a few recognized Liu Dalin and the others and came over one by one to pay their respects. Huang Bingkun noticed that many of these were children of prominent local families. Upon inquiring, he learned that among those attending were not only children of concubines but also quite a few eldest grandsons of the main line—the most important family members. It seemed the situation in the county had already changed dramatically, and he had truly been out of touch.

He watched as lines of students, led by their respective residence group monitors, filed out of the various teaching buildings in orderly fashion, marching neatly until they passed through the school gates before dispersing. The area in front of the school gates immediately dissolved into a noisy chaos. The children who had been strictly disciplined during school hours were now like monkeys released from cages—one and all jumping, chasing, chattering, and laughing. The entire area before Fangcao Di's main gate became a scene of clamor.

Huang Bingkun planned to go home together with Huang Ping, so they could chat more along the way—especially about that girl who had embraced Huang Ping. This was a major matter concerning propriety between men and women—what did it mean to openly embrace in public like that? As he calculated, if that boy Huang Ping truly liked her, they might as well arrange a betrothal. After all, he was already fifteen. Finding a wife in Lingao was a rather difficult business; if he was capable enough to arrange his own wife, it would save Huang Bingkun the trouble of arranging a marriage for Huang Ping—and it would also make it easier to keep him close.

Just as he was calculating, two children suddenly ran out from among those at the gate. The older boy was holding his younger sister's hand. Breaking away from their playmates, they trotted over to Liu Dalin's wheelchair and bowed respectfully: "Master, good day to you."

"Good, good." Liu Dalin chuckled, looking at the brother and sister standing before him. "No need for formalities, no need." Then he asked about their life and studies at school. He learned that in the recent annual selection evaluation, both siblings had risen several dozen places in their respective grade rankings and had now entered the selection group of the top three hundred.

This selection group was no small matter. At Fangcao Di, the top three hundred students in each grade's annual comprehensive evaluation became selection group members. Selection group members not only received scholarships but also had the opportunity to compete for further selection into the advanced track.

Once in the advanced track, as long as one wasn't eliminated by examinations, one was guaranteed admission to the Middle School Department as a full-scholarship student—a guaranteed future "elite." Not only did every student know this, but their parents were also very clear about the difference. Huang Bingkun had learned from Huang Ping that the school had such a system; he knew that many students, in order to compete for this grade selection group qualification, never went home on rest days and studied day and night.

Even with such devoted study, given that the average grade had several thousand students, getting into the top three hundred was clearly extremely difficult. Therefore, each grade comprehensive evaluation would stir up considerable emotional waves among the students. Huang Ping's grades were well beyond position one thousand; he had long since given up any such aspirations.

Who would have thought that the Liu family's two children would be so outstanding! Huang Bingkun couldn't help but feel admiration—truly a household of scholarly heritage!

Liu Dalin seemed to know what he was thinking and said with a smile: "These are the grandchildren of my household's Steward Zhao. Now that they've entered the Australians' school, they've both become promising—I hadn't expected they were both naturally suited to study."

"Ha ha, your household is one of scholarly heritage. Even the servants' children can be nurtured to such excellence." Wang Ci hastened to offer flattery.

This remark would have seemed like a compliment to the scholars, but unexpectedly, when the brother and sister heard it, instead of bowing in thanks, their faces showed expressions of displeasure.

Liu Dalin, being kind-hearted, quickly stepped in to smooth things over, changing the subject by asking Steward Zhao's grandson who had ranked first in this year's Senior Elementary first-year comprehensive evaluation.

"This year it's a girl," he said. "Her name is Dai Yan."

"It's a girl?!" Everyone's faces showed surprise. That Fangcao Di had female students was no longer shocking news to them, but for the top student among over a thousand Senior Elementary first-year students to be a girl—that was too subversive to their worldview.

In their view, the pirates' practice of having girls attend school on a large scale was merely a transplantation of some "overseas strange custom." For girls, it could even be considered a kind of favor. No one had imagined that the top scorer in the Senior Elementary first-year comprehensive evaluation would actually be a girl.

"That's Dai Yan!" Steward Zhao's grandson suddenly pointed behind them. "I saw her at the comprehensive evaluation conference! She's incredibly good at studying!"

Everyone turned to look and saw a teenage girl with the standard short hair worn by female students, dressed in Fangcao Di's dark blue uniform, walking alongside her weathered-looking father. The child's father wore heavily patched clothes of coarse local cloth, still kept his hair in a topknot, and was obviously not a naturalized citizen. He also gave off a strong, pungent smell of seafood—probably a fisherman or someone who worked the tidal flats.

The group had originally seen that the girl had fairly good features and reasonably fair skin, and assumed she was from some middle-class family. They had been about to greet her and make her acquaintance. Seeing that she was actually from a poor and ignorant common family, they immediately lost interest in making conversation.

Amid his mixed emotions, Huang Bingkun waited for Huang Ping—but Huang Ping didn't seem particularly grateful that the Second Young Master had personally waited to accompany him home. Instead, his face showed a constrained expression. When Huang Bingkun told him to bow to the members of the delegation, he wore an extremely reluctant expression. Seeing this, Huang Bingkun couldn't help but sigh inwardly—recalling how sharp and efficient Huang Ping used to be when accompanying him on social calls, presenting visiting cards and paying respects. It was as if he had become a different person.

Since Fangcao Di's scale was growing ever larger with more and more students enrolling, the Lingao city tram had been extended to Fangcao Di, connecting the county seat and Hundred Fathoms City. Since the members of the delegation lived in various places, they parted ways on the platform. Huang Bingkun volunteered to escort Liu Dalin home on the one hand, and on the other, he also needed to go to the public transfer station outside the county seat to catch the public carriage back to the Huang Family Stockade.

The platform was packed with students queuing up to take the train home. Seeing Liu Dalin's party approach, the students on the platform automatically made way for them, letting them move to the front.

Liu Dalin praised the children for being so considerate. One of them replied: "Our teachers taught us: respect the elderly and love the young, and help the disabled. Sir, since your legs aren't good, it's right to let you board first." Liu Dalin laughed heartily.

With a whistle from the steam engine, the iron train wheels began to roll, carrying a full car of passengers. Spouting black smoke, it traveled along the railway toward the direction of Lingao county seat. The delegation members had bought first-class tickets for the last car to avoid being crowded together with the former tenant farmers, hired hands, and such "workers" in the forward cars.

Everyone deferred to Liu Dalin as the senior member, letting him sit by the window where he could view the scenery along the way. Liu Dalin gazed out the window at the view alongside the tracks. In his trance, he could no longer remember what things had looked like before the Australians came. It seemed as though the smoking factories on the other side of the Wenlan River had existed since the dawn of creation. And there were the continuous stretches of good farmland; the rows of houses in the villages newly built by the Australians for their settlers...

The farmers working the fields and the lush growth of the crops indicated that this year would be another good harvest. A good harvest—before the Australians came, it seemed Lingao had never had a good harvest.

"How beautiful—what a pity—" Liu Dalin murmured.

"What does the Master find pitiful?" The question came from Steward Zhao's granddaughter from the Liu household.

What indeed? Liu Dalin suddenly realized he himself didn't know what was pitiful. Stroking the Zhao girl's head, after a long while he finally said: "This Lingao is truly beautiful. What a pity—my body is useless now. I'm of no use anymore."

Steward Zhao's granddaughter was very clever. She said: "What are you saying, Master? The instructor-teachers said that you are the first ever Metropolitan Graduate in Lingao's history. As long as you can come out and look around often, it's a tremendous benefit to the common people."

This surely contained an element of the girl's deliberate flattery, but Liu Dalin also knew the Australians truly thought this way: he was a well-known figure in the county. As long as he was frequently out and about, it was equivalent to endorsing and supporting the Australians' rule here—excellent material for winning popular support.

He said with a smile: "You overstate things, you overstate things."

Huang Bingkun sat in a seat at the back of the carriage, whispering privately with Huang Ping.

He asked Huang Ping who that girl was who had embraced him, how old she was, and what her family did. The moment Huang Ping heard this question, his face reddened, and he said evasively: "Why is the Young Master asking about this?"
