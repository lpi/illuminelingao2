# Chapter 292: Sweet Port Turbulence — Guangzhou

Ma Qianzhu asked, "Are there too many branches? How much manpower will be invested?"

"Not much," Yan Ming said. "Our plan is to use local indigenous people as much as possible, sending one or two people to operate is enough. Just appearing as merchants."

Of course, going deep into the heart of the Great Ming to set up branches required a lot of capital to operate. The transmigrators didn't have this strength yet. So the current plan was to open a bank in Guangzhou.

"People generally don't accept new things easily," Yan Ming elaborated on the thinking. "At the beginning, we can place it directly under the Guangzhou Station system. First absorb deposits through Purple Treasure Studio—this one already has relatively high credit, so attracting deposits will be easier. It probably won't take long for Violet Sincerity Trading to absorb deposits too. The deposits absorbed by these two will be allocated and used by the Guangzhou Bank. The financial dealings and capital flows of the various merchants under the Guangzhou Station will also be unified and handled by the bank in the future. Slowly build up credit."

This way, it was equivalent to taking back the financial power of the Guangzhou Station. The Executive Committee naturally understood the benefits. The business of the Zi Corporation in Guangzhou was getting better and better, the scope was expanding daily, and there were more and more local merchants dealing with them. Financial problems were very prominent. First, the Guangzhou Station simply filled out a requisition form and registered the purpose of expenditure to spend directly from Guangzhou's accounts; second, cash was completely collected and spent by themselves. Lack of supervision. Although there was a quarterly financial audit, it just checked the accounts in and out. As for various temporary expenses, they couldn't be verified at all.

"Unchecked power inevitably brings corruption." For the Executive Committee, the Guangzhou Station was now a large state-owned enterprise lacking supervision. In the past, when the situation was small, a little discrepancy didn't matter. But now that the situation was getting bigger and bigger, more attention had to be paid to this aspect. If the four people at the Guangzhou Station united to play tricks, the Finance Committee in Lingao would hardly detect it.

Thinking of the future where there would be more and more overseas agencies, Guangzhou Station was just one place now. In the future, when there were many places, wouldn't the threads get messier? Moreover, once an interest chain was formed in embezzling public funds, cleaning it up would be extremely complicated. In case someone came to lobby the Executive Committee, or used bribery to buy votes among the masses... it really made the gentlemen of the Executive Committee lose sleep just thinking about it.

Now that such a bank was established, all subordinate enterprises and dealing enterprises must open corporate accounts in the bank. Various special funds could also have separate accounts. Every capital flow had to be recorded, avoiding the malady of everything mixed in one big pot.

Thinking this way, running a bank indeed had many benefits. Not to mention things like remittance, at least internal control would be improved.

"Will this cause too many constraints on enterprises? Those in charge might be overly cautious."

"No," Cheng Dong explained. "Establishing a bank and requiring all transactions to be recorded is just part of a sound financial system. It has nothing to do with who uses money or how much money, let alone interfering with specific operations."

"The financial power of enterprises is still autonomous. This point will not change," Cheng Dong said.

"In that case, Lingao should actually open a branch too."

"Lingao currently has Delong Grain Trading House handling it. Just split a section out to operate concurrently. Including the various enterprises and institutions established now, we must gradually establish financial systems, open corporate accounts, and strive to complete the comprehensive bill-based and institutionalized financial work within the year."

So the proposal to open a bank was passed. To avoid too many brands being hard to manage, the plan was to call the one in Guangzhou "Delong Bank." In management, it would directly accept the command of the Financial and Monetary Committee.

"Is there a suitable person to dispatch?"

"Yes, Meng Xian will do."

Everyone knew Meng Xian. Not for his financial talents, but from the impression when he was a shooting instructor during New Army training. Remembered that he shot extremely accurately, worthy of coming from a sports school shooting background.

"He studied finance and accounting in the US. It's his profession."

Wen Desi thought for a moment: "But this person's image is not quite suitable."

This person was 180cm tall, weighed 90kg, with a full beard, curly hair, small eyes, and well-developed muscles. Standing on the street in Lingao, he was out of place with the surroundings. Sending him to Guangzhou, wouldn't he be even more conspicuous?

"It doesn't matter. I think his looks have a very exotic flavor. In a place like Guangzhou where people from all directions mix, it's actually a good cover." Cheng Dong strongly recommended. "And he can count as half an agent. Has a lot of firearms experience."

Such a conspicuous figure, no matter how good his marksmanship, could at most be an action operative. Intelligence gathering was obviously inappropriate. But since Cheng Dong strongly recommended him, everyone stopped objecting.

"Alright, this matter is settled then."

As for the suggestion to borrow funds at high interest in Guangzhou to throw into the Leizhou sugar market, the Executive Committee also approved it—although the risk was higher, it was a sure-profit business. Immediately telegraphed Guangzhou, permitting borrowing.

Receiving the message, Guangzhou immediately got busy. Everyone split up to act. Shen Fan was told to speed up absorbing deposits, taking in however much he could first. Guo Yi and others were busy with borrowing. Guo Yi had discussed with Zhang Xin and Yan Maoda earlier. Although there was no sure word from Lingao yet, the matter was urgent and they had to act with discretion. So they had already connected with families who might be able to lend funds. As soon as the approval telegram arrived, everyone started immediately.

But things didn't go as smoothly as expected. The reason was simple. The monsoon was coming, foreign ships would sail soon, and bulk export goods needed large amounts of silver. Now cash was tight in the whole city. Even for a big merchant like Gao Ju, money was tight now. After negotiation, Gao Ju promised only thirty thousand *liang* available for immediate transfer, and that was after having people check accounts repeatedly and delaying several payments to scrape together. Guo Yi knew that for the Leizhou matter, besides the fifty thousand transported, at least another hundred fifty thousand *liang* was needed to be sure of victory.

One hundred fifty thousand *liang* wasn't normally a big deal in Guangzhou city, but now a hero could be stumped by a single copper coin. Although Shen Fan offered the method of absorbing deposits, distant water couldn't save a nearby fire. Moreover, Violet Sincerity Trading always presented itself as having strong power. If it appeared too impatient in borrowing, it would inevitably "lose face." The few guys in Guangzhou had mixed in the business sea for months and had quite an understanding of traditional business circles—no matter what your real situation was, the necessary facade must be maintained, even if you had to borrow money to maintain it. Once you showed a bit of fatigue, things would immediately become difficult.

However, if today's matter could be settled, there might be a big turn for the better.

This sedan chair was specially ordered by Shen Fan for him recently, used for going out to visit guests. By reason, a commoner like him couldn't sit in a four-bearer sedan chair, but Guangzhou had been open as a port for a long time, and using items exceeding regulations was common. Four-bearer sedan chairs were everywhere on the streets. It wasn't a big deal anymore. The only slight restraint was not using green woolen cloth. The sedan chair was very exquisite, with glass windows transported from Lingao inlaid on three sides—transparent flat glass was quietly entering the lives of wealthy merchants and gentry in Guangzhou. Hung with colorful silk window curtains, copper-wrapped sedan poles polished shiny bright. Inside the sedan, covered bowls, fruits, snacks, and a water pipe were all prepared. If traveling a long way, one wouldn't worry about loneliness on the road, having plenty of pastimes. The inside of the sedan was very spacious; even sitting two people was more than enough.

Guo Yi was hesitant at first, feeling that sitting in this sedan chair was too flashy. But Shen Fan persuaded him that in the jewelry and curio business, if the proprietor wasn't lavish, people would look down on his status, and the shop would lose face too. So being a bit luxurious was proper.

Originally Guo Yi wanted to propose that the Lingao Carriage Manufacturing Plant produce a batch of high-class carriages to supply the Guangzhou market. But after seeing horse prices in the Guangzhou market, he knew this commodity would hardly have a market—horses were shockingly expensive. A few carriages could surely be sold, but not too many.

"Carriages, oh carriages. Having carts without horses won't do—" Guo Yi pondered. His body rose and fell with the rhythm of the sedan chair. It wasn't his first time sitting in a sedan chair, and he was used to this bumping feeling. He was thinking about how to persuade the few gold owners he was going to meet.

The bits and pieces of funds he could borrow in this fragmented way probably wouldn't exceed thirty thousand *liang*, still ten thousand short of the hundred fifty thousand figure. Where to find this hundred thousand *liang*? Guo Yi thought hard for a long time and discussed with everyone, but no one could come up with a concrete idea.

However, if today's matter went smoothly, there might be a turn for the better.

The sedan chair suddenly stopped. The attendant lifted the curtain and whispered, "Purple Clarity Pavilion is just ahead. Should we carry you in—"

"No need!" Guo Yi knew that Purple Clarity Pavilion was now the top entertainment venue in Guangzhou, with many dignitaries coming and going. Carrying the sedan in was too conspicuous. He wasn't here to show off. "Go through the back door."

The back door was quiet and also had a dedicated sedan hall. Guo Yi's sedan was carried directly in. The steward of Purple Clarity Pavilion was already waiting.

"Is the guest here?" His first words upon getting off the sedan showed the proprietor took this matter seriously. The steward busily answered, "Replying to Proprietor, they haven't all arrived yet."

"Lead me to see Pei—Miss." He hesitated slightly when using this title, then thought since he was appearing in a female guise anyway, he might as well accept it to avoid problems later.

PEPI's boudoir was set in a small courtyard in the rear building. Flowers and trees were sparse in the yard; it was a quiet place amidst the noise. Guo Yi was also entering this place for the first time. Entering the room, he saw no maids, but a handsome youth came to greet him and serve him to change clothes.

If it were a year ago, Guo Yi would definitely be uncomfortable all over and refuse to let others serve him. But he had been in Guangzhou for a long time, and his cover identity was a big proprietor. His daily life naturally differed from ordinary people. As the saying goes, environment alters character. Running around with old business expert Shen Fan, contacting people who were either rich or noble, he slowly cultivated the demeanor of a wealthy merchant. Even his Guangdong Mandarin slowly lost the 20th-century flavor. He began to slowly integrate into his role.

Calmly letting the servant boy help him change into casual clothes and wiping his face with a hot towel brought to him, he sat down in the large room. Someone brought clear tea and four plates of tea snacks.

Looking around, this room was luxurious enough. Full set of Guangdong rosewood furniture. In another spacetime, this set probably couldn't be bought for less than a million. The four walls hung many celebrity calligraphy and paintings, probably gifts from others. The most conspicuous was a floor-standing redwood clock, unique in Guangzhou city. The "internal organs" of this big clock were brought from another spacetime, only the casing was made by local craftsmen.

What wasn't quite coordinated was the kerosene lamp on the table. Although a beautiful lampshade was added, the style didn't match the room at all. As for the row of rattan-shelled thermoses on the Fujian lacquered low cabinet, it gave people a sense of time and space disorder.

The servant boy went to the curtain and said softly, "Proprietor Guo is here."

PEPI, under the alias Pei Lixiu, opened the curtain personally and walked out gracefully. Due to managing Purple Clarity Pavilion and having many affairs these days, she had thinned a lot, conforming more to the aesthetic taste of this spacetime. Lightly powdered face, eyebrows like paintings, eyes flowing with waves—she had a different kind of exotic charm.

Coming out, she curtsied first: "Lixiu greets the Proprietor."

This curtsy was a formal recognition that Guo Yi was her employer in public. Although it was acting, it was very necessary. Otherwise, a single woman of unknown origin opening such a grand restaurant would inevitably attract endless trouble.

Seeing the master arrive, the servant boy and maids naturally assumed they had intimate words to discuss. Without needing orders, they retreated.

Guo Yi didn't stand on ceremony and went straight to the topic, whispering, "Who are we meeting?"

"A few foppish young masters." Seeing no one around, Pei Lixiu put away the romantic and graceful manner and sat with legs crossed. "Exhausted me!"

"Watch your image!" Seeing Pei Lixiu reveal her true form, Guo Yi busily reminded her.

"It's fine. I'm not greeting guests here; they dare not come in!" Pei Lixiu stretched. "Got cigarettes?"

"Where would I find cigarettes for you? You have to be careful in this line of work; smelling of smoke is bad—"

"Humph, this line of work?" Pei Lixiu turned away. "Purple Clarity Pavilion is a clean, proper business. You actually say such hurtful words..."

*Sweat*. Guo Yi really couldn't take it, getting goosebumps all over instantly.

"Alright, I didn't say anything. I don't have cigarettes. Hurry and talk business."

"Mm." Pei Lixiu took out a linen handkerchief to wipe her eyes—this handkerchief was a new product from Lingao Textile Factory recently, woven from local linen mixed with high-count long-staple cotton. Light and breathable, the hand feel was much better than silk.

Luxury goods and consumer goods developed by Lingao were mostly sent to Guangzhou first, and many were prioritized for supply to Purple Clarity Pavilion to establish the brand. Once rich people liked them, the whole market would open up—in any era, rich people always lead the fashion consumption trend.
