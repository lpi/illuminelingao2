# Chapter 1992 - A Small Meeting of Recalling Bitterness

"Yes! Chief!"

"This set again!" Wang Qiyi was very unenthusiastic about this "Militarized Management." He could never understand some Senators' obsession with etiquettes like "heel clicking" and "nodding," always feeling uncomfortable. "I'm leaving first. You chat and get familiar."

Wang Qiyi left, but Zeng Juan's worries came. Obviously Wang Qiyi's instruction just now commanded him to manage things during tonight. He didn't understand why the Chief arranged this for him, a buck private who shouldn't be in turn regardless of seniority or background. Just because his seat was close to the Chief?

"Slurp slurp... Oh mom, suffocated me just now." Before Zeng Juan pondered carefully, a soup-drinking sound broke the silence in the office.

"Comfortable!" Xu Zhewei banged the empty bowl on the table, rolled up sleeves and wiped mouth. "Look at what? Never seen a man drink soup?"

"Haha... What kind of master [Lao Ye - also man/husband] are you!"

"Aiya, Brother Xu, how badly were you suffocated just now? Not to this extent right."

"Who says not to extent. I always drank soup like this. Today dining with Chief, I saw you all taking small bites. I don't know that, could only chew dry rice, didn't dare drink a mouthful of soup."

"Brother Xu looks like a straightforward person at first glance." Zeng Juan turned to ladle a spoon of soup from the soup bucket for Xu Zhewei.

"I'll do it myself... Team Leader Zeng too polite."

"It's nothing; this bucket is close to me. Hearing Brother Xu's accent, a Northerner?"

"Mm mm, I am from Shandong, Changyi County of Laizhou Prefecture." Xu Zhewei shoveled rice in bowl without lifting head, obviously hungry.

"Laizhou? That's three or four thousand li from this Guangzhou Prefecture right." Zeng Juan put down chopsticks somewhat surprised looking at Xu Zhewei. Thanks to reading Pirate Studies magazines well back then, he knew a bit about Chinese geography. Not only knew Laizhou was in Shandong, but also knew this was where Kong Youde rebelled. However, he wasn't surprised at this, but another question hidden in heart for long: Chiefs all came from Qiongzhou further south than Guangzhou, why were there so many Northerners especially Shandong people among cadres?

"Traveling all the way from Shandong must be not easy."

"Okay. Rode Senate's big ship. Although a bit seasick, didn't suffer much sin. Peacefully arrived in Qiongzhou."

"Riding ship?" Zeng Juan involuntarily widened eyes. Although Guangzhou had many foreign merchants, basically every family in this city had some connection with sea business, in most, no, should be everyone's eyes, running ships on sea was a business of nine deaths one life. Whether people or goods could be gone instantly. These Chiefs actually dared to use ships to pick people from Shandong to Qiongzhou, and picked so many! How much sin suffered along this way.

"Riding ship on sea fear many discomforts. Could elderly and children in family bear it?"

"Family? Long gone. Originally not wealthy family, hungry a meal full a meal. Once soldier chaos rose, starved starved, frozen frozen, remaining killed by rebel soldiers. Originally had a wife, fell behind running for life, also spoiled to death. Only I ran out alone." Xu Zhewei still shoveled rice without lifting head. "Grandma's really can't get used to this rice. Still mantou satisfying, gnawing one in each hand!"

Zeng Juan felt a bit embarrassed instantly. He remembered before the Senate liberated Guangzhou, he and partners debated this Shandong pacification strategy when strolling outside city, debating how to quell rebellion fastest. At that time according to Australian magazine report: Rebel Army and Great Ming Government Army see-sawed around Laizhou, both sides suffering heavy casualties. Four people stood on earth mound guiding country with vigor, very proud of their own strategies. Now a living Shandong person, a person whose family broken and barely escaped from rebel hands, made him feel pointing at rivers and mountains back then was too ridiculous.

"What?" Xu Zhewei put down bowl looking at Zeng Juan who didn't know how to answer. "Nothing! Dead cannot resurrect. That son of a bitch Kong Youde had head chopped by Senate, avenging us. I'll follow Senate for life... What did Chief Wei say? Fight across Yangtze River to liberate all China!"

"Hahaha..."

"Giggle giggle..."

"What are you laughing at?"

"Then you didn't go be a soldier, ran here to play abacus."

"Sister Chu, don't laugh. Not me boasting, with my physique I was mobilized to join army just entering factory." Xu Zhewei stuck chest unconsciously straightening clothes. "Who knew a Senator said playing abacus has more air [qi/strength?] than holding gun—they let me go to vocational school to learn finance and tax."

Actually Xu Zhewei's physical exam result was "Grade C." According to standard Grade A "Qualified for Enlistment," Grade B "Reserve Enlistment Qualified," Grade C was "Unsuitable for Queue Service." Not only unsuitable for queue service, even factory apprentice training didn't want him. Finally because he learned abacus for a few years, he entered accounting vocational class.

But he was young and looked very robust. Being brushed down by physical exam felt very losing face, so strictly claimed being mobilized to study.

"Sister Chu? You are Guangzhou local right, how come simply came to this Finance and Tax Bureau? I heard you have a daughter studying in Lingao?"

"Like you, fell into distress." Smile on Chu Xiaoran's face disappeared instantly, lowering head picking a kale chewing slowly.

To Chu Xiaoran, her pain wasn't displacement, nor death of husband and daughter, but over twenty years of kinship being like thin paper before money, a hole blown by a breath.

"Sister Chu, don't be sad. I shouldn't have shot off my mouth..." Seeing her expression, Xu Zhewei said hurriedly.

"Nothing, a bit of old matter in past. Stifled in heart for long, saying it out is nothing."

Her father was an old Tongsheng (child student/candidate). Family circumstance though not good, loved her very much, teaching her reading words since young. After marriage family was well-off, husband singing wife following. Though only gave birth to two daughters in ten-plus years of marriage, husband didn't mind. Family of four was harmonious. Who knew heaven didn't fulfill wish. Husband suddenly caught malignant cold, dragged taking medicine for over half year, finally let go and left. Meager family property sold empty, only a house left, yet fancied by mother-in-law and brother-in-law. Excuse she had no son and would definitely remarry in future, drove her mother and daughter out of house right after First Seven Days.

"...In-laws refused to keep me, originally nothing—expected. Unexpectedly satisfying returning to maiden home, my sister-in-law was also this ruthless. Let alone keeping, even a meal refused to give." Chu Xiaoran said, "Usually I thought maiden home was always a reliance. Whenever had things, never lacked a share for my brother and nephew. Whatever difficulty they had, always helped if could—Unexpectedly ended up in such a state!"

Chu Xiaoran had no one to turn to. Elder daughter suffered fright, body hot talking nonsense after few days walking. Plus lacking clothes and food, despite Chu Xiaoran crying dry tears, didn't keep her; died in inn. With this tossing, only bit of soft goods on body spent clean. Drove out of inn, reduced to beggar.

"...Speaking of suffering, that was truly bitter. Dead end wanting to beg—unexpectedly being beggar wife also needs money." Chu Xiaoran never willing to say this usually. "Big Bone doesn't let register without money. Without registration going out to beg would be beaten. Maybe kidnapped by flower-patter [kidnapper]... That was truly calling heaven no answer..."

Yao Yulan nodded sympathetically: "I know this." Like Chu Xiaoran, she also had experience of whole family falling into distress and displacement. Despair of dead end was deeply realized.

"...At that time my daughter hungry till eyelids barely opened. I was disheartened completely, simply found a grass rope binding myself and child together—seen whole family jumping into river several times, never expected turn to myself."

Yao Yulan wiped tears with handkerchief, thinking of past events of those years again. Especially being withdrawn marriage by fiancé, making her still full of resentment upon thinking till now.

"...Unexpectedly daughter awakened by water shock, shouting help, saying she didn't want to die—my heart softened and didn't die... Thinking again, since not even fearing death, still fear living? Thinking here I went back from water. Dragging daughter, seeing a big restaurant by roadside simply barged in. Beating me I didn't go, scolding me I didn't go... Finally a Fat Young Master had good heart, gave us mother and daughter a big bowl of meat rice, and instructed waiter to send us to Cihui Hall—Sigh, pity muddled at that time, didn't even ask benefactor's name!"

"Sister Chu, you are now returning home in glory too. This benefactor, might as well verify slowly." Zeng Juan was quite awkward in conversation, because those present were basically "Bitter Big Hate Deep," "Fell into Distress" saved by Senate. Although his family circumstance before exam wasn't good, far from words falling into distress. Thus having no resonance and feeling a kind of exclusion awkwardness. He wasn't like Huang Ping, serious Fangcaodi background. So wanted to integrate into group specially. Caught chance to interject at this moment: "Although his name unknown, since eating in that restaurant, must be regular customer—Waiters in restaurants are all human spirits, definitely know his name. We go ask when free, definitely will know..."

"This is a method!" Yao Yulan's gossip heart erupted. "I see do just so! Busy finished this matter we go find person for Sister Chu!"

"Right! That sister-in-law and in-laws of yours, must also fix them up properly! Let them Dog Eyes Look People Low!" Xu Zhewei was filled with righteous indignation. "If opening shop, investigate to death! If having real estate, check his Deed Tax! I don't believe they can be innocent [One Poor Two White]! Find an excuse, fine them to bankruptcy, then put inside to eat lawsuit!"

"Ai ai, this is passed, passed." Huang Ping didn't speak just now, shaking head at moment. "We must act according to law, cannot enforce law starting from venting private anger—Chiefs' good scriptures, we can't read askew."

Huang Ping's status was higher; everyone naturally inconvenient to refute him. Only saying if bumped into hand absolutely not spare, to vent anger for Sister Chu. Group spoke excitedly, Chu Xiaoran just ate rice silently alone.
