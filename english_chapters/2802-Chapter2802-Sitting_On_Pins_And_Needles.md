# Chapter 2802 Sitting On Pins And Needles

After the old man nearly fell, the old woman seemed to realize what had happened and began to sob. Her voice was small, yet it seemed to shake the quiet afternoon. She reached out with a trembling hand to support the old man, and together they picked up the bamboo basket sitting nearby. Tan Shuangxi wanted to help, but looking at the sight of the old couple supporting each other, his feet were nailed to the spot by something. The militia captain supported the old woman's arm and casually slung the bamboo basket onto his own shoulder. The old woman didn't refuse; she let go of the basket, took the old man's arm, leaned on his shoulder, and the two walked slowly out of the vegetable garden.

Zhang Laicai muttered, "Should we follow them?"

"Do you even need to ask? We haven't given them the things yet!"

The two followed with extreme reluctance. Tan Shuangxi had done this kind of thing once before with his platoon leader. In his words, going once meant losing all enthusiasm for at least three days.

Entering the house, the old man said gently, "Old woman, go pour some water for these two children." The old woman walked into the inner room with a hunched back.

Tan Shuangxi took out a kraft paper envelope from his satchel. He opened it in front of the old man and took out the items one by one: "Guo... Father Guo, this is Dapeng's death notification; this is the pension check; these are his medals and decorations; this is his cemetery certificate—Dapeng is currently buried in the military cemetery on the mainland; this is the list of his personal effects: a few old uniforms, a bedroll, and some odds and ends. The post office will send them to you in a few days. Check them yourself. If there's anything wrong, write a letter to this address—if you can't write, ask the village office to write it."

Finally, he took out a document: "Please put your thumbprint on this for us, sir, so we can go back and report the completion of our duty."

The old man was like a wooden figure, doing whatever he was told.

Tan Shuangxi handed the things to the old man. He didn't rush to look at them, but asked everyone to sit down. He sat on a bench himself, looking at the two Fubo Army NCOs, and said, "How was the fighting in the north?"

"The Ming army couldn't withstand a single blow," Tan Shuangxi said. "Fighting the regular troops took almost no effort; they surrendered at the mere sight of us. Later, that dog official Xiong Wencan incited bandit rebellions everywhere, so we had to chew on some hard bones. Quite a few brothers died fighting messy battles..." Tan Shuangxi knew the problem wasn't the fighting at all...

The old man remained silent, hunching his body. It was unclear if he was listening to Tan Shuangxi's combat report. Tan Shuangxi thought perhaps he hadn't heard anything at all.

The old woman brought out a few bowls of water, her eyes red. She must have had a cry in the room.

Tan Shuangxi held the bowl and drank some water. It was the cheapest kind of coconut shell bowl; refugees were issued one upon reception, counting as their first utensil. The outer shells of these bowls were already quite battered. No one spoke for a while.

The old woman looked at the old man for a moment, appearing to get some kind of permission, then turned to Tan Shuangxi and said, "Dapeng... how did he go?" The old woman spoke in a Shandong dialect. Tan Shuangxi didn't quite understand, but he guessed the meaning, and the militia captain whispered a translation for him.

"It had to come eventually," Tan Shuangxi thought to himself. He paused and said, "Ever since Xiong Wencan incited the bandit riots, there have been bandits everywhere. We were constantly marching, constantly rushing. Once, we went to suppress bandits and encountered an ambush. The bandits were in the roadside woods, attacking the column with firearms. The distance was too close, and a small stone hit Dapeng." Tan Shuangxi gestured at his chest and continued, "...The medic went up to save him, but he had already stopped breathing. It happened all at once..."

The old woman sat on the bench beside him, leaning her body against the old man, sobbing quietly. A neighbor woman, who had been called over, sat behind her, supporting her. The old man’s face was somewhat pale as he listened intently. He asked, "And then?"

"Then we wiped out that band of bandits, rescued over two hundred women and children who had been abducted, and seized a lot of looted goods," Zhang Laicai took over. "The next day, we sent people to return them all."

"That counts as worth it," the old man said.

Tan Shuangxi didn't know how to respond. Although there was no crying or screaming as he had imagined, he still felt he couldn't stay in this small hut any longer. He looked at Zhang Laicai. Even though Zhang Laicai was considered a "smooth talker" in the company, at this moment, he also looked like he was sitting on pins and needles. He just kept looking at Tan Shuangxi with pleading eyes, hoping he would end it quickly.

Ideally, they managed to take their leave. The old couple wanted to fulfill their duty as hosts and keep the two NCOs for dinner, but Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai practically begged to leave, leaving the village head and a few neighbors to keep the old couple company.

Just as they were about to reach the village entrance, a mournful wail suddenly came from the direction of the old couple's hut. Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai shuddered involuntarily and hurriedly quickened their pace, fleeing the village as if escaping.

Only after leaving the village did he let out a breath: "I dread this kind of thing the most," Tan Shuangxi said. "I feel like I have no face to see the families."

"What's the use of saying that? It's getting late. Let's rest in Fushan Town for the night."

Although Fushan Town was within Chengmai County, it was actually at the junction of the two counties. The indigenous people here were also "Lingao people" and spoke the same dialect. Due to geographical convenience and the presence of a Lingao Urban Rail station, commerce was relatively prosperous. The two arrived in Fushan and opened a room at the local military-designated hostel. With nothing to do, enjoying a drink in the evening was inevitable.

After a few cups of wine, Tan Shuangxi spoke the words he had held back all afternoon: "How are Guo Dapeng's parents going to live from now on?"

"There's the pension and the survivor's subsidy. Are you afraid the old couple won't be able to get by?" Zhang Laicai said. "Besides, they have a son and a daughter. Even if they aren't around, they send money back. Once their eldest son returns, things will naturally smooth out."

"Yes, there's still a son in the family, so they won't be bullied by others!" Tan Shuangxi took a sip. "If he really were an only son, it would all depend on whether the villagers have a conscience!"

"It depends on how the village arranges things. I think the village head is decent. Zhongxing is an immigrant village. His family has no ties here, which is actually a good thing. If they had a few relatives, they would be sharpening their knives right now." Zhang Laicai downed a full glass of beer and said with some emotion, then shouted loudly, "Waiter! Do you have any strong liquor?!"

The waiter hurried over, his face piled with smiles: "Yes! Yes! Yes! Xue Ziliang Brand Fruit Brandy, 45 degrees..."

"Bring a bottle!"

The waiter paused and advised, "A bottle is 750 milliliters. That's too much for two people. You can also buy it by the glass..."

"Fart! Do you think we can't afford to pay or what?!" Zhang Laicai slammed the table.

"No such meaning, no such meaning. The shop is grateful enough for your patronage."Seeing that these two soldiers were in a bad mood, the waiter dared not say more—many soldiers had patronized recently, and while they spent money like water, when they caused trouble, they smashed up the shop.

He turned back to the counter to place the order and fetch the wine, whispering to the apprentice, "Go outside and see where the patrolling military police are."

Tan Shuangxi knew this had probably triggered some past memory, so he didn't ask further. Actually, such things could be guessed. Thinking of this, he lost interest. He said:

"Ma'niao isn't far from here. Let's visit again when we have leave. There are several other soldiers from Zhongxing Village. It shouldn't be hard to lend a hand if something happens."

Lending a hand was secondary; having someone watching would make others wary.

"Yes, if people from the troops visit often, it will be somewhat better." Zhang Laicai poured himself half a glass of brandy, looking like he intended to get drunk.

"When Guo Dapeng died, were you right there? I saw you didn't tell the old man the truth."

"Drink a few sips less, too much gives you a headache." Although Tan Shuangxi said this, he poured himself half a glass too. throwing his head back, he poured all the liquor in the glass into his mouth. A line of fire rushed from his throat straight to his stomach, instantly making him dizzy. He had never liked strong liquor, but now he wished the wine were stronger, the kick harder, so that after a hangover he could forget everything about that day. But at this moment, the alcohol had the opposite effect, and the scene from that time floated up like a movie.

The moment the cannon shot landed, Tan Shuangxi had rushed to Guo Dapeng's side, dragging him by his clothes into a nearby ditch. Guo Dapeng had lost consciousness. His eyes were slightly open, his mouth gaped wide, gasping "Oh! Oh! Oh!" for air. Tan Shuangxi knew this was a chest wound causing a pneumothorax. If the wound wasn't blocked immediately, he would suffocate to death very quickly—this was learned in battlefield first aid training before setting out.

Tan Shuangxi quickly store open Guo Dapeng's clothes and the gear on his body, but there were too many equipment straps! Canteen, belt, ammo belt, primer box, grenade pouch, backpack... Time was tight, and Tan Shuangxi couldn't afford to undo his equipment one by one to find the wound. He could only rip open the buttons on his chest!

Fortunately, it was summer, and Guo Dapeng was only wearing a vest and a uniform jacket. Ripping open the buttons revealed the bullet hole in his right chest. The hole was small and round; it was likely a small stone, as bandit militia generally couldn't afford real lead shot. The small bullet hole sprayed black-red blood plasma outward with his strained breathing, dyeing the white linen vest completely red...

Tan Shuangxi tore open the first aid packet and pressed it directly onto the bullet hole without unfolding it, pressing hard with both hands, terrified that more air would escape from this hole. But Guo Dapeng's breathing did not improve; instead, it became weaker and weaker.

"Medic! Medic!" he shouted urgently. Gunfire and shouts of killing rang out all around. No one responded to his calls.

"It must have gone through! There's a wound on the back too!" A soldier beside him, holding his gun and keeping watch, reminded him. Tan Shuangxi looked down and saw the yellow earth and green turf soaked in blood. The blood had turned black, a large pool of black-red.
