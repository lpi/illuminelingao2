# Chapter 286 Sweet Port Turbulence – Transporting Silver

"And after we send the silver? According to Wen Tong's letter, he probably needs two hundred thousand *liang* to get through this crisis. Even if we borrow from the Gao family, and even if they're willing, that much cash can't be assembled immediately. The Guangzhou Station can ship fifty thousand right away; the other fifty thousand will still take time to raise."

"Is that right? Guangzhou's revenues have been good—and there's the payment from the Gao family..."

"Those are book figures. Nobody keeps that much cash sitting around—not the Gao family, not the Guangzhou Station. Large sums of cash... even if the Guangzhou Station immediately mobilizes local funds, it'll take at least seven or eight days."

"Send whatever we have first. It's better than sitting around." Ma Qianzhu said. "If fifty thousand *liang* gets there, that'll give them at least a few more weeks of cushion. A lot can happen in a few weeks."

"Tell Guangzhou to prepare the silver. We'll send a ship to pick it up."

"Will there be time?"

"Send the *Ascending Peace Island*. It has an engine—four days round trip should be enough." Ma Qianzhu said with some regret, "Too bad it's back in Lingao now. If it were in Guangzhou, that would be ideal!"

"Should we also buy rice in Guangzhou and ship it? Guangzhou rice is one *liang* three *qian*—there'd be a nice profit margin..."

"No, now is not the time," Yan Ming immediately vetoed this proposal. "The more critical the crisis, the more we have to show we have strength. Paying with rice might work normally. Right now, everything must be done in silver—give the rumor-mongers no opening. Otherwise, once confidence collapses, it will trigger an attack on South China."

"Alright. Let's do it that way."

"Also, dispatch a radio team and necessary personnel to Leizhou immediately. This is urgent." Ma Qianzhu said. "Now we need to maintain constant communication with Leizhou!"

"Actually, I think we should just mobilize the Special Reconnaissance Team. Bei Wei is already in Leizhou. Just go in and decapitate their leadership..."

"Don't need to go that far yet. It would make things blow up. They're not just commoners either. If they want to get serious, the South China Sugar Factory isn't necessarily their match—we still don't have the advantage in Leizhou." Wen Desi thought military intervention seemed inappropriate. Though the Special Reconnaissance Team could certainly smash this "Haiyi Hall" that Wen Tong reported on, these people might be future partners. The ideal approach was still to tame them through commercial means. Only then would they truly submit to the Transmigration Collective.

"Let's prepare for both possibilities." Ma Qianzhu lived up to his reputation as a hardliner. "Work for a peaceful resolution, but if that fails, we're not here to play commercial war games. A quick and direct solution is also an option."

That evening, Bopu Port.

Since morning, the seas had gradually grown rougher, reaching Force 5. Waves were high and crashing. By noon, conditions worsened. Not only the fishing boats working nearby, but even the Navy vessels that had been performing patrol and fishery protection—or perhaps more accurately, fishing protection racket—duties in the outer waters were ordered back to port. Inside Bopu Port, besides the vessels belonging to the Maritime Forces, a specially designated water area also accommodated quite a few fishing boats and passing vessels that had temporarily put in to weather the storm. Since a new lighthouse had been built on Bopu Point, and the Transmigration Collective had implemented scientific port construction and management, this had gradually become an important anchorage for transiting vessels.

In the afternoon, it began to rain. The torrential downpour seemed to herald the onset of Lingao's rainy season. The sky darkened rapidly, turning as gloomy as dusk. All the lights in the Bopu camp were switched on. Except for sentries still standing watch, there was no activity outside the buildings. Even the usually bustling shipyard slipways had fallen silent. Besides the steam and coal smoke rising from the boiler room, there was only the rumbling of steam engines driving the drainage pumps. Occasionally, a few figures in rain gear would dash from one building to another.

Through the pitch-black curtain of rain, a light suddenly tore through the murk along the road from Baireng direction. A Beijing 212 Jeep bounced along toward them. The vehicle stopped briefly at the guard post at the camp entrance.

"Pass!" The sentry was a local young man in his early twenties, wearing the Navy's blue uniform. Though not tall, months of military training had given him a distinctly soldierly bearing. Even wearing a straw rain cape and bamboo hat, he stood ramrod straight. The person in the car was pleased to see that he'd kept his rifle well-protected under the cape.

An ID was handed out. He took it and, like a machine, went through the "identity check" procedure that his instructors had drilled into his head. Finally, he returned the ID to the vehicle. He stood at attention and saluted:

"You may pass, People's Commissioner, Sir!"

The Jeep's wheels spun for a moment, then headed into the camp interior. The roads inside the camp had been roughly surfaced with coal slag and steel slag, leaving no puddles. The going was quick. Soon the vehicle arrived near a modified shipping container house by the dock.

Light shone from the building's windows. The person in the car jumped down nimbly and walked in with a few quick steps.

Everyone inside stood up when they saw him enter, snapping to attention with a sharp rustle. Everyone wore the First Year naval uniforms.

"Sit!" The newcomer was none other than Wu De. Having a People's Commissioner of his rank take charge was a last resort. The transmigrator naval veterans had either left with the expedition fleet or were needed to operate the fishing trawlers defending Bopu. With no suitable candidates left, Wu De had volunteered for this mission. After all, when it came to experience operating motor sailing vessels, no one had more than this former Navy officer and son of a fishing family.

Several nautical charts were spread on the table, along with the 24-hour weather forecast from the Lingao weather station—a modest operation, but reasonably accurate for short-term local forecasts.

"People's Commissioner! Maritime Forces, Bopu Port Master and Bopu Fortress Area..." Li Di stood up and was about to recite his full title.

"Forget the formalities—save that for when we have time. Let's talk about the mission." Wu De waved his hand. "Report! What's the status of the *Ascending Peace Island*?"

"Yes, sir." Li Di reported: "After receiving the mission order, we inspected the vessel. Ship condition normal, engine normal. To ensure safety, we've replaced all anchor cables and rigging. Fuel is topped off."

"Personnel?"

"Chief of Staff Ma's instructions are that we must ensure safety. So the Maritime Forces have decided to use all-transmigrator crew for this voyage, replacing the indigenous sailors and soldiers. Only, we're still short on personnel and were planning to pull some more..."

"No." Wu De immediately vetoed this. "This ship needs at least forty people between crew and guards. That's too many eggs in one basket. Also, the *Ascending Peace Island* runs this route regularly. The indigenous sailors know the hydrographic conditions along the way better than we do. Replacing experienced hands with inexperienced ones—isn't that asking for trouble?"

"Then what do we do? The ship's carrying a huge shipment of silver. If the indigenous crew gets tempted—"

"Then just don't let them know. Besides, are you telling me the Navy's been training these people all this time and built zero trust?"

"Well—" Li Di thought about it. Nobody from any department had said indigenous personnel could be one hundred percent trusted. On second thought, better to go with half and half—that way he'd have something to report to both Chief of Staff Ma and Commissioner Wu.

"Then we'll staff with half and half."

"Do it that way. And bring a few of the naval trainees on board." Wu De said. "Give them a lesson too—let them taste what the sea is like!"

"Report: the Navy's first intake of trainees all went with the expedition fleet for practical training. The current batch is only the second intake—they've only been recruited and trained for a few weeks. Going to sea now, they probably won't be much use."

"Doesn't matter. Maybe this voyage will tell us which ones will be useful and which ones are dead weight."

"Yes, sir!" Li Di immediately phoned the school: pull six of the older trainees from the second-year naval trainee squad.

"All transmigrator crew members are to be issued modern weapons," Wu De gave instructions. "One hundred rounds per person, plus two grenades."

They continued studying the charts and discussing the route... After over an hour of discussion, Wu De asked:

"What's the weather looking like?"

"Weather conditions aren't ideal." Li Di brought over the forecast. "Barometric pressure indicates the wind and rain over the Qiongzhou Strait will probably continue for 24 hours. Currently northwest winds at 20 knots, wave height 2.5 meters."

Wu De calculated—that was Sea State 4. For typical modern vessels, this was nothing, but for a motor sailing ship of only 70 tons displacement, these were significant seas. Going out meant taking some risk. But now, across the strait, the South China Sugar Factory was desperately waiting for silver...

"Get everything ready—prepare to set sail!"

"Maybe we should wait until tomorrow when the waves are smaller..." Li Di was startled. Just looking at the sea conditions outside the harbor made him shiver.

"No time to wait—we only have four days!" Wu De's voice was grave.

"Alright, I'll go prepare."

"Wait!" Wu De stopped him and addressed all the naval personnel in the room. "This mission may cost lives! Anyone who doesn't want to go, speak up now! As mission commander, I authorize him not to go! We'll replace him with indigenous personnel."

Some had been about to counsel against setting out in such conditions, but now no one could speak up—who'd be the coward in front of everyone? So someone steeled himself and stepped forward to pledge:

"For the great cause of transmigration, we absolutely obey orders! The Executive Committee points the way, and that's where we'll sail the ship!"

"Anyone afraid of dying wouldn't have joined the Navy!"

...

The atmosphere was properly rallied now. The transmigrators in the room competed to display their "military bearing." Seeing this, Wu De nodded: "Everyone go prepare immediately. Assemble at the dock at 16:00 hours sharp for departure. Dismissed!"

After everyone had left, Wu De organized his written luggage from the car, changed into his own Navy work uniform, sea boots, and nautical rain jacket. He checked his Type 54 pistol and carefully secured it in a waterproof holster.

For him, sea conditions weren't the greatest enemy—the real concern was the security of the silver once it was on board. Such a huge sum of silver couldn't be loaded unnoticed. If some group targeted this wealth and tried a hijacking at sea, with the *Ascending Peace Island*'s armament, they could handle two or three ships. Any more would be a struggle. Then they'd have no choice but to run at full speed. Don't let the diesel engine or propeller have any problems...

Through the window glass, he could see the lights of ships in the harbor flickering through the wind and rain. The tall crane also had position lights—lanterns marking the height in the air, as per the safety regulations from another spacetime. With a crane, shipbuilding would be faster and easier—too bad there still weren't enough people.

While he was lost in thought, someone called from the doorway: "Report!"

"What is it?" Wu De turned around and saw a sailor standing there.

"Is this... Commissioner Wu?"

"That's me."

"Um, there's a woman at the base gate who insists on seeing you," the sailor hesitated. "She says she's your maidservant."

"Chu Yu?!" Wu De was startled. This had to be Chu Yu. With the sky so dark and rain pouring down, she'd walked all the way from Baireng City to Bopu alone. That was over ten kilometers!

When he'd left, he'd told Chu Yu he was going to the mainland on business. The little woman had been reluctant to part, looking unhappy. He'd said a few words of reassurance and thought that was the end of it. He hadn't expected her to follow him.

Women—such a hassle! He muttered to himself, but he couldn't help feeling a warmth in his heart.

"So, sir, should we bring her over?" The sentry, seeing he recognized the woman, asked.

"No, she doesn't have a pass. She can't enter the base." Wu De thought for a moment. "Tell her to go back to the villa and wait for me."

"Yes, sir."

Though the mission was urgent, this incident made him handle his affairs more briskly. After finishing up, he checked his watch—already 15:00—and quickened his pace out of the naval base. Just as he exited the main gate, he heard a voice call "Master" through the rain. Startled, he looked back and saw a figure sheltering under an abandoned wooden guard post outside the base, wearing a rain cape. Who else could it be but Chu Yu?

"What are you doing! Why didn't you go to the villa?" Though touched, Wu De was also annoyed by womanly fussing. Ever since one night after the New Year when, unable to bear the loneliness, he'd taken Chu Yu to bed, she'd attended to him with ever-greater care—practically wanting to wash his feet for him. It was clear she'd devoted her life to him.

"I was afraid Master wouldn't go to the villa—that you'd just leave like this, and Chu Yu would miss you—"

"Nonsense." Wu De scolded. "Am I that kind of person?!"

"Yes, Master." The woman obediently lowered her head.

"Let's go—you must be soaked through?"

"It's nothing, Master." The woman briskly wiped the rain from her face. "The sentry here was very strict—wouldn't let me inside to take shelter from the rain..."

"This is a military zone. Come on!" He waved his hand. "Let's go to the villa to talk."
