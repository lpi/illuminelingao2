# Chapter 112 - Gou Family Stockade (2)

A guide was quickly found; he was a local peddler. Gou Family Stockade wasn't Mordor after all. Except for the few households of the Gou family who were fiends, most were ordinary people who also needed items like needles and thread on weekdays. Where there was demand, there was supply. Of course, doing business in Gou Family Stockade required some courage. With bad luck, being robbed by former professional criminals, now family guards, was normal, and getting beaten up was also possible. Lin Quan'an was one of the very few peddlers who dared to do business in Gou Family Stockade. The reason he was willing to go was simple: because almost no one dared to go, prices there were higher, and demand was stronger. This showed that Lin Quan'an was a man of great courage—he was also the first person to come to the free market in Bairen City to sell goods.

Although there was a plot for a free market in the urban planning of Bairen City early on, no one had come to trade. Lin Quan'an learned while traveling through villages that the short-haired pirates had let out word: anyone going to Bairen Beach to do business or work as temporary labor was welcome. Of course, these words had little effect for the time being, but they gave Lin Quan'an an idea. He specially found a few laborers who returned from Bairen Beach and asked in detail about the local situation, reaching a conclusion:

This group of short-hairs wouldn't leave in a short time. The reason was simple: they were desperately building houses, showing a strong intention to settle down locally.

Since they wanted to settle down, there would be many demands, and the business opportunities were huge.

Lin Quan'an decided to test the waters. Before going, he made full preparations.

His goods were a load of vegetables—being a vegetable peddler in Lingao had no future. The reason was simple: except for some demand in the county town, rural households all grew and ate their own vegetables in the fields; no one would spend money to buy them. But since this group of short-hairs came from the sea, vegetables couldn't be grown on ships. People could go without meat but not without vegetables—at least they would get constipation. Secondly, if the other party was unreasonable and predatory by nature, he would only lose a load of vegetables. As for whether the other party would capture him as free labor—since they could release so many captives back home, why bother capturing him alone?

He carried a load of vegetables all the way to the Bairen Free Market. There was no one else but him in the huge open space. While he was in fear, Wu Nanhai, who got the news, came out and bought all the vegetables without a second word to improve the cafeteria meals. Lin Quan'an was overjoyed. The short-hairs seemed to not only need vegetables but were also very generous—they didn't seem to treat copper coins as money, easily throwing two hundred wen to him without even counting—not the sandy-shell Guang coins that broke in half when dropped, but all shiny Wanli coins! Actually, even if Lin Quan'an brought a load of soil, this group of short-hairs would have bought it—this was called setting an example.

Over time, Lin Quan'an became the exclusive special vegetable supplier for the transmigrators, and recently began to be responsible for supplying live pigs, chickens, ducks, and poultry eggs. The supply volume was staggering—ancient people's intake of animal protein was very low. Livestock and poultry were rarely eaten usually. Unlike these five hundred otakus who ate meat every meal and had eggs every day as a standard. So the prices skyrocketed immediately. All nearby farmers were planning to raise more chickens, ducks, and pigs next year.

Lin Quan'an got rich. His carrying pole turned into a handcart. Just as he was preparing to hire assistants and get a cart, Short-hair Master Wu came to find him, asking him to be a guide to Gou Family Stockade.

With Lin Quan'an's wisdom, he certainly knew that the short-hairs going to Gou Family Stockade was typical of a weasel paying a New Year call to a chicken—harboring no good intentions. Although he liked making money, getting involved in matters between two big hooligans wouldn't have good results. He immediately declined, but this Master Wu intentionally or unintentionally mentioned that the cafeteria procurement prices were a bit high. When he settled the bill and left, he found many peers peering at the stockade gate—the power of example was indeed infinite.

To protect his monopoly supply status, Lin Quan'an had to take a risk. However, before setting off, he declared that he would do nothing but lead the way. Wu De agreed readily.

There was also an uninvited Student Wang Ruixiang in the team. Reconnaissance had nothing to do with his business originally. His self-proclaimed title was Chief Designer of "Wang's Weapon Design Bureau," but actually he was doing odd jobs in the machinery group. Student Wang forced his way in for two reasons: First, he painstakingly brought a large model airplane and a remote-controlled helicopter, which hadn't been useful yet; second, as a deeply hidden nationalist, he distrusted Xue ABC very much, always feeling this person's stance was problematic and defecting to the enemy was a matter of time. He had to monitor this dangerous element—if he dared to do anything betraying the people, betraying the party, no, betraying the Executive Committee, he would immediately feed him the climbing axe on his belt.

Xue Ziliang didn't expect this person to have such sinister intentions. Although he thought using model airplane reconnaissance for an enemy of Great Household Gou's level was a bit like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, it was good to try. So he agreed to let this axe gang member join the team.

This reconnaissance operation was a plainclothes reconnaissance. Those going changed into local cloth clothes and wore hair scarves. To cover their strange hairstyles, they all wore bamboo hats. The group carried back baskets. Besides weapons and reconnaissance equipment, the baskets also contained some small miscellaneous goods like needles and threads prepared by Lin Quan'an.

Before departure, everyone smeared dust on their faces to appear not so clean and fair—a big difference between transmigrators and locals was that their skin was generally fairer.

Five or six people dressed as common peddlers in the county slowly set off towards Gaosanling.

Bypassing the county town and walking for no more than ten li, they arrived at Dongchun Village at the foot of Piye Mountain. This was a thousand-year-old village, inhabited since the Han Dynasty. Now there were dozens of households in the village—the times were not peaceful, so even such a small village built an earthen wall more than a person's height. There was a tea shed by the roadside, serving rough tea and dry food for passersby. Hearing the guide say there were still more than ten li after entering the mountains, Xue Ziliang decided to rest here for a while and set off after everyone had gathered enough energy.

Fearing infectious diseases, the transmigrators never ate any food cooked by locals. The medical group repeatedly warned them that typhoid fever was extremely rampant here. Everyone drank water from their own bamboo canteens. Lin Quan'an didn't have so many taboos; he was used to this group of short-hairs' extreme obsession with cleanliness and didn't find it strange. Taking advantage of the break, he whispered the details to pay attention to later.

From here into the mountains, walking another ten li or so was the location of Gou Family Stockade. This road led directly to Gou Family Stockade. Few people walked on the road; apart from people in the stockade, there were merchants like him. The Gou family's village braves and family guards often patrolled this road. Encountering strangers, they would interrogate them. First, to guard against enemies; second, the mountain products here were all occupied by his family. Woodcutters gathering firewood, hunters hunting, and merchants logging all had to pay him money; private hunting and logging were not allowed.

He reminded the scouts that if there was anything special in the back baskets, it was best to find a place to hide it first. If they searched and found it, and took them to the stockade for interrogation, they would inevitably lose a layer of skin.

Xue Ziliang discussed with the team members and changed the team to a single file advance. Ye Mengyan served as the point man, Xue Ziliang was second responsible for cover, and others followed one by one. Lin Quan'an was kept in the third position by the murderous-looking Wang Ruixiang. Lin Quan'an was scared half to death seeing this group of short-hairs suddenly become murderous.

"Don't be afraid, just continue pointing the way!" Xue Ziliang showed his big white teeth to Lin Quan'an and smiled sinisterly. Wang Ruixiang beside him felt a thump in his heart, suddenly feeling that if he really wanted to chop this ABC, he probably wouldn't be his opponent.

"Attention, our task is to reconnaissance the enemy's defenses. If possible, capture a prisoner back." Xue Ziliang instructed, "Don't start any conflict unless necessary, but once fire is exchanged, be clean and quick!" He looked around at the young men beside him, "Don't use guns casually; use your knives!"

Several people felt a thump in their hearts. The business of killing people, doing it for the first time in their lives, was really a bit uncomfortable. However, they had been educated enough during training: fighting is life and death, no benevolence.

The group maintained formation and walked into the mountains. Piye Mountain is a famous mountain in Lingao, very close to the county town, and belongs to one of the local scenic spots. The word Piye originated from the name of Master Piye, a Brahman monk who crossed the sea in the Han Dynasty. The mountain has six ridges. Gaosanling is the second main peak in the mountain. There is a temple of Great God Gaosan Piye on the top of the ridge. The so-called Gaosanling is also named after the temple. There is also a lake in front of the temple, with clear water and a surface calm as a mirror, named "Pingjing Lake" (Flat Mirror Lake). It is truly picturesque with beautiful scenery. However, this group of people harbored thoughts of killing, arson, and looting money, so they had no mood to appreciate this elegance.

They didn't encounter any pedestrians along the way. Even if there were a few, they were villagers passing by in a hurry. The legendary professional criminals of the Gou family did not appear, saving them the trouble of killing in advance. The reconnaissance team bypassed a small hill and walked for seven or eight li. From a distance, they saw a small hill under the main peak, densely covered with houses. Lin Quan'an said that was Gou Family Stockade. The valley below the hillside was full of fields.

Arriving here, it was less than three or four li from the stockade. Xue Ziliang led the team to a forest.

Xue Ziliang observed the terrain with binoculars: The stockade was built against the mountain, surrounded by a high and thick earthen wall. The gate was wooden, and an enemy tower was built on the wall on each side of the gate. The road ended at the stockade. There was no moat, but many barriers like abatis were set up. Assaulting the city wall with infantry in the cold weapon era was still a bit difficult.

After marking the height of the city wall, towers, and sentry posts on the map, Xue Ziliang made up his mind to go in and take a look personally. No matter how much reconnaissance technology developed, field reconnaissance was always the most accurate source of intelligence.

He turned around and ordered Lin Quan'an to take him into the stockade. This order scared Lin Quan'an badly. Leading the way was one thing, but taking this tall and big short-haired evil star into Gou Family Stockade, if something happened, neither of the two major hooligan gangs in Lingao would spare him. Just as he was about to kneel and beg for mercy, Wang Ruixiang, who was guarding him, had already pulled out his axe. The shiny axe flashed before his eyes, asking him if he wanted to eat sliced noodles (be cut) or wonton noodles (be drowned)—indeed the true color of a pirate. He had to stand up obediently.

"Listen, I can speak Minnan dialect!" Xue Ziliang said, "Just say I am your fellow villager, here to help you."
