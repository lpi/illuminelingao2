# Chapter 73 - Wu De's New Mission (4)

"Ah De, isn't this going a bit too far?"

"You people, speak harsher than one another, but can't handle it when seeing people cry a few times?" Wu De said with a cold face to Yuan Qiushi, "Whoever cries, beat them hard, beat until they stop crying."

Little Yuan was indeed young and could lay a heavy hand; the stick went down with crackling sounds. Xiong Buyou roared: "No crying, all stand straight for me!"

Wu De knew that these five people couldn't even reach the level of tenant farmers or long-term laborers. They belonged to the lowest level of short-term laborers in the old Chinese countryside. A tenant farmer at least had a house, and some land that, although not his own, could still yield some harvest; a long-term laborer at least had a shed to shelter in and enough coarse grain to eat. These people were truly those with no tile over their heads and no land under their feet, poor people who didn't know where the next meal would come from after this one. A trace of sympathy floated in his heart. However, he quickly erased this sympathy. Sympathy is a luxury for transmigrators. They came to a space-time that did not belong to them, everything had to be paved with the flesh and blood of others. What does enslaving a few people count for right now?

The captives, after the round of beating just now, were already submissive, each lowering their eyebrows and eyes, not daring to lift their heads. Everyone knew clearly that this was the headman in charge of them. It seemed their small lives wouldn't be taken for the time being, so their future days would depend on this headman's personal likes and dislikes. These pirates weren't even afraid of the government's laws, let alone a few small commoners; killing a person was no different from crushing a fly.

"Meeting for the first time today. From now on, you belong to us Transmigrators." Wu De raised his voice, "Whatever I say, you must do! Work hard, and two meals and clothes won't be short for you. Otherwise..." He snorted coldly, "From tomorrow on, this Headman Xiong will no longer be aside to translate for you. When I speak, if you don't understand once, twice, I can forgive. If you still don't understand the third time, immediately drag out and behead! What's the use of keeping such waste?!" He spoke sternly and harshly, and Xiong Buyou also shouted hoarsely, probably wanting to accurately convey his spirit.

Language communication is the biggest obstacle between transmigrators and local laborers. Wu De naturally couldn't take the team's only translator with him all the time. When it comes to the effect of rapid learning, strictness and roughness are more effective than patient guidance.

Uneasy expressions appeared on the faces of the captives, but under his sweeping gaze, they all lowered their heads.

He Ma whispered beside him: "Is it really good to always threaten with killing? What if they can't learn, really kill them?"

Wu De gave him a dissatisfied look and sneered: "Then kill."

He Ma's neck suddenly felt a bit cold. He knew deeply to what extent human violent nature could be magnified in an environment without constraints.

"Roll call now. Those whose names are called must answer 'Present'! This is the first rule you must remember. One point late, forty rattan lashes; two points late, eighty; three points late, two hundred."

"Wang Tian!" Facing the list, Wu De called the first name.

"Ah?" The response came from a short guy, estimated to be only about 1.50 meters, looking about twenty years old.

"Say 'Present'!" Little Yuan cooperated tacitly, the lash stick already coming down.

Wang Tian, corrected by the stick, quickly corrected his mistake.

"Lin Xing!"

The person who responded had a loud voice, but the pronunciation was still unintelligible. This person looked taller and physically stronger. Although his head was lowered, Wu De still saw a trace of unruliness in him.

"I don't understand." Wu De decided to knock out his last bit of unruliness. With a wave of his hand, it was another round of indiscriminate beating until he shouted "Present" relatively correctly.

The power of example is infinite—the next three people could shout this word "Present" relatively accurately. After they had some semblance of order, Wu De led the team to start work. He acted as both guard and supervisor, delaying neither. The construction site actually didn't lack the work of these few people.

He intentionally arranged these people in a place slightly closer to the machinery. Watching engineering machinery work at such a close distance would be shocking even for modern people, let alone a few natives who had never been out of the county borders. When they discover that what the transmigrators possess is not only them, these grass-roots people, but also a huge power that no one can resist, they will become loyal, and sooner or later will be proud of the strength of the organization that enslaved them.

When seeing the excavator issuing a huge roar and turning the digging arm towards them, the few people were so scared that they turned and ran, until stopped by Wu De.

"Running for what? Work!"

The captives knelt on the ground begging bitterly. Although their gibberish couldn't be understood, Wu De still understood that they were afraid of that huge machine—thinking it was some kind of monster. Until Wu De pointed out to them that a pirate was also sitting in the transparent box, did they know this was operated by a person.

Excavators, bulldozers, and small dump trucks running back and forth on the construction site—the shock brought by mechanized construction is unparalleled. In comparison, digging shovel by shovel and carrying dustpan by dustpan themselves is simply not much different from ants.

With Wu De, this evil star, and Yuan Qiushi, a young thug with a vicious hand, beside them, no one dared to slack off. The captives worked very hard. After half a day of getting along, they found that although this Headman Wu had a face full of evil spirit, he was much better compared to the young man who took pleasure in beating them hard.

Working until the evening close, Wu De took them all to a separate shack. This was within the surveillance range of the lookout tower, and the camp surroundings were enclosed by barbed wire, so there was no need to worry about them escaping. He Ma was waiting there carrying a medical kit. According to the inspection situation at noon, he had to perform necessary treatment on these laborers. After forcing them to bathe again and boil their clothes, the few people were brought naked before He Ma. He Ma took a ladle and poured slightly hot water onto them, then scrubbed hard with a grass brush of unknown origin. The few people dared not even utter a sound, let alone scream.

"What are you doing?"

"Treating scabies infection. This is to brush open the infected parts for better medication." He Ma explained, using gauze to wipe a kind of ointment vigorously on the skin.

"Sulfur ointment. If President Wen hadn't reminded me, I would have forgotten this thing," He Ma said while wiping vigorously, "Few people in the 21st century get infected with scabies anymore."

"Also," He Ma started to apply other ointments to them, "Don't let them bathe for these few days, wait until this course of treatment is over."

"Is it hard to cure?"

"Very easy, but this thing spreads upon skin contact, very annoying." He Ma was fully equipped with protection himself.

"Do I need to apply some too?" Wu De was a bit worried. This thing seemed very itchy when it flared up; he had seen these people scratching desperately more than once today.

"No need, just bathing and changing clothes is enough. Try not to have skin contact with them. By the way, the straw they sleep on must be taken out and burned every day."

After finishing all this, He Ma took out a pile of small pills and told them to swallow. Although looking at these small white round pieces with suspicion, under Wu De's high-pressure posture, they all swallowed them.

"Pity I don't understand Traditional Chinese Medicine, nor do I recognize Chinese herbal medicine." He Ma shook his head, "I remember there are also prescriptions for deworming."

"Fu Youdi."

"Present!" After an afternoon of adjustment, everyone would react quickly to the roll call, and also understood a little bit of the meaning of the pirate headman's words—the price was scars all over their buttocks.

"You be the team leader." Wu De appointed him as the head for a simple reason—he was unworthy. This locally born and bred farmer was not strong, nor clever enough, and didn't speak very fluently. Being a team leader would definitely not convince the public. What he wanted was the effect of not convincing the public.

"Me?" Fu Youdi was still a bit confused.

"Yes, from now on you are responsible for collecting meals and leading work. If anything goes wrong, I'll hold only you accountable!"

Wu Nanhai originally gave rice according to the transmigrators' share, a standard of 4 liang of rice per person for the main meal, which was about enough for people engaged in heavy physical labor. But Wu De did not intend to let them eat their fill. In his view, eating one's fill should be a reward and cannot be given easily. So he told Wu Nanhai to cut half.

"Is that enough to eat..." Wu Nanhai said skeptically.

"It's better if it's not enough. People tend to think too much when they are full."

"Not really, I just want to doze off when I'm full..."

"That's you. Mix water for me, yes, mix more, make it into seafood porridge for me."

When Yuan Qiushi brought the porridge with a wooden bucket, the rice had become a bucket full of thin porridge. But even so, when the bucket lid was uncovered, the few captives were dumbfounded: snow-white rice porridge, with lots and lots of fish meat and shellfish meat floating, fragrant—although Lingao is coastal, how could ordinary commoners have the chance to eat fresh fish? At most, the master would steam a piece of stinky salted fish during the busy farming season. If they hadn't been scared by Wu De, they would have pounced on it long ago.

Distributed wooden bowls and chopsticks made by unknown persons to the captives, and the matter of distributing rice was the responsibility of the team leader he just appointed.

"Whoever dares to make trouble during the meal, not only will have nothing to eat for this meal, but also won't be given rice for the whole day tomorrow!" Wu De dropped these words fiercely and walked away on his own. He knew that even the most timid person, once supported by leadership, would become reckless, let alone regarding something like eating that concerns personal vital interests.
