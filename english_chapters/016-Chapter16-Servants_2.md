Chapter 16 Servants (2)

While establishing the management system, the Transmigrators did not forget the ideological education of the servants.

Wen Desi had instructed: "We want not only their bodies, but also their hearts. We want to train them into a group of loyal 'new people' who identify with our values."

This task fell on Lin Baiguang.

Lin Baiguang adopted a subtle method. He did not instill dry principles directly, but through storytelling and chatting, subtly influencing their thoughts.

During the breaks in the evening study class, Lin Baiguang would tell everyone stories about "Australia".

He described Australia as a fair, rich and civilized world. There, there was no emperor, everyone was equal; there was no hunger, everyone had food to eat; the law was strict, and no one dared to bully others.

"Master Lin, is there really such a good place?" The servants asked with wide eyes.

"Of course." Lin Baiguang said with a smile, "Our ancestors lived in such a world. Now we come back to build such a world here too."

"Build such a world here?" The servants felt incredible, but a seed of hope was planted in their hearts.

Who didn't want to live a good life? Who was willing to be a slave forever?

Besides depicting a beautiful vision, Lin Baiguang also intentionally or unintentionally instilled some concepts of "loyalty" and "obedience".

He told stories of faithful servants protecting their masters, emphasizing that only by following the master could one have a good end; betraying the master would lead to a miserable end.

This kind of "carrot and stick" ideological work was very effective. The servants' reverence and dependence on the "Australian masters" grew deeper and deeper. They began to regard themselves as part of the "Australian firm" and were proud of it.

Among them, Wang Si was the most receptive. He not only studied hard but also actively helped Lin Baiguang maintain order and report the ideological trends of other servants. He gradually became a small leader among the servants.

Lin Baiguang was very satisfied with this. He planned to cultivate Wang Si as his capable assistant.

In addition to buying ordinary servants, Guangzhou Station also accepted a special "servant".

Her name was "Li Huamei" (not the pirate Li Huamei later), a girl of fifteen or sixteen.

She was not bought from the market, but "picked up" by Guo Yi on the street.

That day, Guo Yi saw a group of hooligans bullying a girl on the street. The girl was dressed in rags but looked stubborn. She bit a hooligan's hand fiercely and refused to yield.

Guo Yi felt compassion and asked his accompanying security team members to drive away the hooligans and save the girl.

"Are you okay?" Guo Yi asked.

The girl looked at Guo Yi, her eyes full of vigilance: "Why did you save me?"

"Seeing injustice on the road." Guo Yi smiled, "Where is your home? I'll send you back."

"I have no home." The girl lowered her head, "My parents died, the house was occupied by my uncle, and I was driven out."

"Then where do you plan to go?"

"I don't know." The girl shook her head, "Wander to wherever I can."

Guo Yi thought for a moment: "If you have nowhere to go, come with me. Our firm is short of manpower. Can you do odd jobs?"

The girl looked at Guo Yi, seemingly assessing whether he was a bad person. Finally, she nodded: "I can. As long as you give me food."

So, Li Huamei followed Guo Yi back to the secret house.

Guo Yi originally thought she was just an ordinary poor girl, but soon found she was different.

She was very smart and learned things quickly. Moreover, she had a wild nature in her bones and was not afraid of hardship or dirty work.

Once, a mouse got into the kitchen. The other maids were screaming in fear, but Li Huamei picked up a stick and beat the mouse to death with one blow, then calmly threw it out.

"This girl is a bit interesting." Guo Yi commented.

He assigned Li Huamei to the logistics group to help organize the warehouse. Li Huamei managed the warehouse in an orderly manner. She remembered clearly where everything was placed and how much quantity there was.

"She is a talent for management." Guo Yi thought.

With the passage of time, the servants of Guangzhou Station had been completely integrated into the Transmigrators' system. They became an indispensable logistic force for the Transmigrators in the Ming Dynasty.

Some of them were responsible for purchasing, some for cooking, some for guarding, and some for gathering intelligence. They worked diligently at their respective posts to contribute to the Transmigrators' great cause.

And their fate also changed dramatically because of the encounter with the Transmigrators.

They were no longer struggling slaves at the bottom of society, but became the first batch of "naturalized citizens" of the new world.

In the future history, the names of some of them will shine together with the names of the Transmigrators.
