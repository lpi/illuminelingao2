# Chapter 2673: The Capital (Part 25)

Yangzhou was located at a vital point of the Grand Canal. The prosperous economy of north-south traffic gave birth to a flourishing entertainment industry. Whether it was government music bureaus or private brothels, business was booming everywhere, truly confirming the comment "Green towers everywhere, songs every night." Precisely because of this special location, Prefect Zhou Song had practiced the skill of welcoming and sending off guests to perfection. After handling official matters, Zhou Song invited Wang Yehao to go to the designated reception unit the next day—the Moon Plucking Tower by the Slender West Lake in the north of the city to drink and make merry.

Strictly speaking according to court laws, officials were strictly forbidden from visiting prostitutes. The prevalence of male homosexuality in the capital was largely an accidental product of this law. However, the Ming Dynasty had been established for many years, and the laws had long been lax. Thinking back to when the "Three Yangs" [Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, Yang Pu] joined hands to invite the famous courtesan Qi Yaxiu to serve wine, the Grand Secretary mocked her as "Mother Dog [Bitch] without manners." The famous courtesan was exceedingly clever and replied, "If I am a Mother Dog, the Lord is a Public Marquis [Male Monkey]." It became a beautiful tale for a time. In the Xuande reign, Censor Zhao Lun of Huguang was punished with exile to Liaodong just for "fornicating with a music woman." So everyone understood in their hearts that those impeached for such things were masters with no one above them and who looked for people indiscriminately below.

In front of monstrous power, a few "Thin Horses" really counted for nothing. So Wang Yehao focused on taking care of the feelings of the "Rough Stock" Mr. Zhou this time. After the formal meeting, Wang Yehao hinted obliquely to Prefect Zhou to arrange fewer literati to treat guests. As for the singing girls, there was no need to care too much about their singing voices; the priority was "beautiful appearance." To put it bluntly, it was directly going to a "meat market," and don't engage in too many peripheral programs. Prefect Zhou was quite surprised after understanding the demand. This Master Wang was also a *Jinshi* degree holder; how could he have the posture of a hungry ghost? But literati often had strange fetishes, so this little hobby was nothing. Prefect Zhou immediately expressed that he understood Master Wang's meaning and only found a local veteran of the pleasure quarters, Squad Leader Tian, to accompany them.

A Squad Leader [*Bazong*] in the Ming Dynasty was different from the Qing Dynasty; it was not a low-ranking position in the army. So although Squad Leader Tian couldn't be called extremely wealthy, he had some assets. He loved enjoyment, liked beauty, was good at social dancing [networking], and was a famous romantic figure in Yangzhou. His daughter, Tian Xiuying, had been selected as a side consort for Prince Xin, so he could be counted as a royal relative.

Actually, Wang Yehao had no elegant interest in appreciating Thin Horses; he purely wanted to please this Mr. Zhou. Recently, he trusted this "Immortal" more and more. In fact, he had seen many such immortals in the capital, all monks, Taoists, and warlocks who claimed to be able to communicate with spirits, invite gods, and foresee good and bad luck. But most of their rhetoric was ambiguous. If it wasn't a setup beforehand, it was forced interpretation afterwards. A "Prophet" like the Teacher, whose appearance had no air of immortality but whose predictions were accurate to the day, was truly an anomaly.

With Mr. Zhou, the court situation was like looking at a fire clearly. Vaguely, he had the feeling of holding the general trend in his grasp. Heaven is truly helping me! Wang Yehao was secretly smug. He had really picked up a treasure! Next, it would depend on whether his prophecy of the Nine Thousand Years' downfall could come true. If it really came true, entering the Grand Secretariat and becoming a Prime Minister, reaching the peak of officials, would be a matter in his palm!

But after all, he was an official who had cultivated for many years, so he still made two-handed preparations: continuing to perfunctorily deal with the Eunuch Party while secretly leaving a way out in advance. When he returned to Shaoxing this time and discussed building a Living Shrine for the Nine Thousand Years with Prefect Zhang Luwei, he cunningly avoided the step of putting pen to paper: the current situation was unclear, so the proposal for the Living Shrine could be agreed with, but no written evidence could be left behind. Asking for credit is easy, but clearing oneself is troublesome.

The person who joined the team inexplicably was exactly one of his escape routes. This person was named Jin Wenchi, a former advisor to Wei Dazhong, one of the "First Six Gentlemen" of the Donglin Party.

After Wei Dazhong was arrested and subsequently killed in the Imperial Prison, most people in his tent were persecuted by the Eunuch Party and went into hiding anonymously. Jin Wenchi was one of them. Although he was a *Xiucai* scholar, he dared not return to his native place to reveal his identity, only setting up a stall at the Anchang Ferry in Shaoxing to write for others.

Because of poverty and frustration, he was forced to get involved in a property dispute case, forging documents for someone. He was seen through, taken to the county, and subsequently his true identity was interrogated out.

Wei Dazhong was already dead, and Jin Wenchi couldn't be counted as a high-ranking "backbone." So Wang Yehao got this person into his hands with just a few words.

To the Eunuch Party, Jin Wenchi was of no great use. But to Wang Yehao, Jin's identity as "Wei Dazhong's advisor" was remarkable. Once heaven and earth overturned, it could serve as an idle chess move.

Therefore, although Jin Wenchi wore shackles along the way, he didn't suffer much. Arriving at the Yangzhou boundary, the shackles were simply opened, and he was treated with good food and drink. It was even more comfortable than usual. Arriving in Yangzhou, Wang Yehao took advantage of the stopover rest to win him over again.

Zhou Lezhi naturally didn't understand Master Wang's painstaking effort. He only heard from Wang Liang that the prisoner was an advisor the Master intended to recruit. Because he had a case on him, he had to wear shackles when on the road.

"If he is a prisoner, how can he be an advisor?"

"You are still tender!" Wang Liang sneered *chi*. "Guilty or not guilty, isn't it just a word from the Prefect? Who does the Prefect listen to? Doesn't he have to listen to our Master?"

That day when the lanterns were first lit, guests and hosts took their seats. Delicacies and jade liquids were spread out; rouges, powders, orioles, and swallows surrounded them. As the host, Prefect Zhou first introduced the attending guests to each other.

"This is Master Wang. Last year he toured Guangdong as Imperial Inspector, providing disaster relief and pacifying the people. His merit is high and labor is hard. Returning to the capital this time, he will surely rise high!"

"Long looked up to, long looked up to." A sturdy middle-aged man beside him cupped his hands and said.

"This is Master Tian, originally an Imperial Appointed Squad Leader, now idle at home. If we talk about the patrons of this Yangzhou romantic field, if Squad Leader Tian claims second, no one dares to claim first!" Prefect Zhou was obviously very familiar with him, so he spoke without scruples. "The second wife Squad Leader Tian took back then was Miss Xue, the top zither player of this Moon Plucking Tower. Such romantic fortune truly makes others envious! Originally, the daughter in the family also learned a good hand of zither, only she was selected as a Princess Consort and entered the capital a few years ago. We no longer have the ear fortune."

"Master Zhou is joking." The middle-aged man was quite open, having already picked a girl to hold in his arms.

As the saying goes, the speaker has no intent, but the listener has intent. Wang Yehao asked immediately after hearing the introduction, "General Tian, is the side consort of the Tian family that Prince Xin took in earlier your noble daughter?"

"Haha, it is exactly my little daughter Xiuying." Squad Leader Tian said happily. "That little girl also has a good fate. Her mother was originally best at zither arts. Originally teaching her some zither skills, just hoping some master would take a fancy to her. Unexpectedly, she was selected into Prince Xin's residence. This life can be considered free of worry about food and clothing."

Wang Yehao thought, *This is more than just worry-free food and clothing.* If Mr. Zhou's prophecy is true, this person sitting here will be the future Imperial Father-in-Law. If I don't flatter him now, when will I wait? "I have long heard that General Tian is heroic and chivalrous, comparable to Lord Mengchang. Seeing you today, your bearing is indeed extraordinary. Disrespect, disrespect."

Although Tian Hongyu counted as a royal relative when lined up, in reality, his daughter was just a side chamber concubine just married to a Prince who hadn't taken his fief yet, so few people came to "burn his cold stove." Wang Yehao's flattery today made him feel quite comfortable, his mood good, and his words became plentiful: "Where, where. Lord Mengchang had three thousand retainers; how can I compare? Raising three or five Thin Horses satisfies me."

"Speaking of the ways of raising Thin Horses, Squad Leader Tian is more astute than raising soldiers!" Prefect Zhou joked from the side.

"General Tian is truly a romantic famous scholar!" Wang Yehao continued to flatter.

"Speaking of raising soldiers, Tian truly dare not speak." After a few cups of wine, Tian Hongyu's interest rose. "Speaking of raising Thin Horses, Tian really has some insights."

"Lucky today, please enlighten us, General Tian."

"Easy to say, easy to say." Tian Hongyu drank the wine/water handed by the girl and continued, "This Thin Horse stresses seven words: Thin, Small, Sharp, Curved, Fragrant, Soft, Upright. They must enter the trade at six or seven years old. Any older and they are tainted with smoke and fire [common] *Qi*. No matter how they are disciplined, they can't become first-class goods."

He spoke vigorously, and the Zhou master and disciple listened entranced. Strictly speaking, this was the first time the two seriously visited a pleasure venue. The luxury and enjoyment of this brothel were simply beyond imagination for Zhou Lezhi, a poor boy from the countryside of Guangdong. In comparison, Mr. Zhou's eyes contained more curiosity than surprise.

The various things on the banquet table today also broadened his horizons. Huai-Yang cuisine had always been known for fresh ingredients and fine craftsmanship. Although specific dishes differed from later generations, the essence and pattern were connected. He wanted to taste the flavor, but no one moved their chopsticks. He had to continue sitting dryly and exchanging flattery.

At this moment, hearing Tian Hongyu's exposition, his desire for investigation was aroused again. He asked, "General Tian, forgive this little brother's shallow talent, could it be that these Thin Horses have ratings too?"

"That is of course; this brother doesn't know." Tian Hongyu knew at a glance that this person was a novice, so he put on the posture of an old senior and said, "These Thin Horses are divided into three grades. The lower grade practices needlework and cooking; non-wealthy households cannot keep them. The middle grade learns calculation, writing, and arts, keeping accounts and managing affairs; they can be called helpmeets. The upper grade learns poetry, songs, zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting, possessing a hundred kinds of attentiveness and a thousand kinds of amorphous sentiment; only they can be called Beauties."

Zhou Lezhi listened and felt fascinated unknowingly, thinking he probably wouldn't have the fortune to enjoy these "Thin Horse" girls in this life. However, the Teacher beside him felt these were not on point. With his own skills, even upper-grade Thin Horses couldn't chat with him at all. Talking about romance was not as practical as washing a wind bath directly.

However, after only two rounds of wine, his view was refreshed. The brothel was not simply serving people with color but more like a high-end entertainment center. The professional quality of the girls accompanying wine and singing songs was very high; they could serve any kind of guest comfortably. So no matter what nonsense the Teacher spoke or if he started talking about "What is Physics" after drinking a few more cups, the girls could seriously play the role of enthusiastic listeners, cheering from time to time, greatly satisfying his vanity.

The banquet lasted for nearly four hours. Driven by Tian Hongyu, the atmosphere was warm and harmonious, and both guests and hosts enjoyed themselves. Seeing they had played enough, Prefect Zhou said to Wang Yehao, "Master Wang, there is a courtesan queen in this Moon Plucking Tower called Miss Youqing. She leads the trend in coquettishness and is unmatched in beauty and art. Usually, she doesn't easily see people. Knowing the Master is visiting tonight, she is specially waiting in the pavilion. Why doesn't Master Wang go drink a cup of fragrant tea?"
