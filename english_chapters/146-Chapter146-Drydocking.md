# Chapter 146: Drydocking

Slipway and dock frame timber came from Bopu Lumber Yard. Besides mangrove-harvested coastal wood, there was considerable beam and pillar timber from Gou Manor demolitions—perfect for shipyard facilities.

Standard slipways used 30×30cm diameter American pine. None here—but ordinary wood substituted. However, 40m lengths were rare—requiring multi-piece splicing. Splicing wasn't difficult for Mechanical Department—but approval was slightly complicated. Any metal material use currently required Planning Committee approval.

For simplicity, the slipway used longitudinal layout. Electric winches easily overloaded and burned during drydocking—common even in professional shipyards. For their inexperienced crew, camel-type boiler driven capstans were safer.

After solving winches, the biggest issue was the "ground dragon." This was a massive horizontal pile buried underground. When capstans pulled ship hulls, the ground dragon—as anchor point—bore enormous tension.

Shipyard ground dragons used reinforced concrete or concrete-filled steel pipe. Historically, wooden ground dragons were common. Requirements were stringent: high strength, rot-resistant. Generally 30–50cm diameter hard wood, minimum 3m long. Requiring extensive dewatering and preservation.

Finally, Lumber Section's Wu Kuangming found suitable material in stockpiles: some Southeast Asian hardwood, nearly 50cm diameter, highly rot-resistant—could be used directly without treatment.

"This stuff could make coffins. Use it as your ground dragon." Wu Kuangming spoke reluctantly.

"What—you also want landlord gentry treatment?" Yan Quezhi teased.

"Heh—not that. But timber people know: coffin wood for wealthy families is the best—non-rotting in ground or water. Taking it away feels like cutting my flesh."

After all equipment was installed, drydocking preparation began. Drydocking was skilled and dangerous work—shipyards commonly had casualties during this process.

"Everyone listen!" Wu De addressed the assembled personnel. "Drydocking is dangerous. During work, constantly watch! Being hit by cables—you're dead!"

He explained various precautions—actually, Wu De himself only half-understood. But he'd at least witnessed and participated in fishing-boat drydocking in his village. Beyond that: just an ancient "Simple Ship Repair Manual" found in computers. Success depended entirely on Wu De's memory and the book's accuracy.

Everything removable was offloaded—even masts removed to lower center of gravity. Towing cables used steel wire from *Fengcheng*—lumber factory's self-made hemp ropes proved insufficient in tensile tests. The slipway was coated with lard—the only room-temperature-solid fat Wu De could obtain. So much lard being taken made Wu Nanhai heartbroken: how many pigs to get this much!

The drydocking site had fifteen-sixteen people. Though dangerous, Wu De didn't call commune members—this work required constant communication. Commune members' Mandarin—however good—was a different era's language. Misunderstandings or delays meant deaths.

"Start!"

Steam engine was already heated. At Wu De's command, winch began slowly turning. Ground dragon's chains tightened. Steel cables creaked against pulleys. Wooden ship strength was limited—cables were girdled around stern.

As capstan turned, steel cables fully tensioned with creaking sounds. Wu De worried: 80–90% of drydocking casualties involved snapped tow lines. Once broken, highly tensioned cables would whip out like lashes—striking nearby workers who'd be sent flying. Survival was pure luck.

Cables were from *Fengcheng*—theoretically fine for 100-ton wooden ships. Still, the sounds were frightening.

"Ship's moving forward!" Walkie-talkie transmitted observer's report. Two-thirds of drydocking crew were positioned around for observation—preventing any deviation.

As steam capstan wound, ship rocked, slowly moving from water toward shore. Ship bobbed considerably in waves—looking worrisome.

"Slow the winch—steady." Wu De constantly reminded via walkie-talkie. "Everyone watch the ship's direction. Align with slipway."

First approach was off-center—in shipyards, specialized workers handled this. For amateurs, first-try success was impossible.

"Don't panic—try again. Everyone check cables."

Every retry required cable inspection. Failing to dock just meant losing a ship—accidents killing people couldn't be undone.

After nearly 5 hours of repeated efforts—just aligning ship position had hoarsened everyone's throats—ship finally rested stable on the dock frame. Wu De skipped celebrations—immediately directing everyone to recover lard from slipway and scattered surroundings, storing in clay jars. Still needed for re-launching.

"Good heavens—this oil's turned pitch-black! Disgusting!" Navy people looked helpless.

"Somehow smells like fried food to me."

"That's friction heating. You have appetite?"

"This stuff can be reused? Didn't they say must be pure? There's sand now."

"Melt it down, filter again. Apparently Wu Nanhai specifically came to say if it can't be reused, return it to him."

"Cafeteria's going for gutter oil too!"

"Supposedly for soap making. But black soap—I'm not interested."

Repairs took under a week. All bullet holes were caulked; larger damage reinforced with new wood. Cleaned hull fouling; applied tung oil coating. Navy planned adding cannons—at least cannon positions. Originally, pirates mounted guns on deck—cutting ports in gunwales, covering with minimal protection shelters. Now Mechanical Group's weapon enthusiasts moved gun positions below deck—lowering center of gravity. Four positions per side. Future deck could mount 2–3 more. Downsides: insufficient freeboard—heavy weather would splash through gun ports. But with port shutters—non-combat problems weren't severe.

But no cannons. Ballista problems were fully exposed. Ballista's nature meant high-trajectory lobbing—creating aiming difficulties. Secondly, extremely slow firing rate: two gunners cranking both sides took over a minute to reset tension. Physical exhaustion was considerable. Finally, Ballista was far larger than cannons.

"What's strange about this?" Chen Haiyang said. "If Ballista was really as magical as some Mechanical Department people claimed—why did navies replace it with 'crude,' 'heavy,' 'dangerous' cannons? Obviously even worst cannons outperformed best Ballistae."

"We need real cannons! Even muzzle-loaders!" Meng De howled.

Meng De had earned recognition for sailing ship into port—briefly surrounded by flowers and applause. But the big ship couldn't move anymore. He'd devolved from spotlight captain to *Fengcheng* caretaker. Besides ship maintenance, his most important work was patrolling the bay with small boats.

Finally *Deng Yingzhou* appeared—showing possibility of returning to center stage. But lacking traditional sailship knowledge, Lin Chuanqing seized the captain position. *Deng Yingzhou* was now North America faction's domain—he had no interest serving under them. Conclusion: only building a fleet offered advancement. Now with a new ship, he tirelessly promoted his "fleet" plan: advocating steam-sail gunboat coastal fleet, demanding more Navy budget and personnel—even requesting multi-turret battleships. This call quickly gained hundreds of transmigrators' support—including many Industrial Department members.

Committee ordered Military Department's staff section to evaluate. After comprehensive analysis of local garrisons, pirates, equipment, and transportation: whether pirates or Ming military, large-scale attacks would primarily use sea transport. Land routes would follow coastline roads. Transmigrators couldn't immediately control Qiongzhou Strait's sea supremacy—but needed coastal mobility capability. With limited forces—mobility was especially crucial.
