# Chapter 394 - Rong Operation

Of course, leadership didn't summon him to hear difficulties, but to get things done. However, before getting things done, it never hurt to emphasize difficulties first—lest leadership always think things were easy.

Besides, what he said was factual. The transmigrator collective knew little about internal pirate affairs. Winning over defectors required inside connections; otherwise there was no starting point.

Currently the collective held a batch of pirate prisoners—some had been absorbed into the Army and Navy, some became commune laborers, others remained in labor camps doing hard labor. Lin Baiguang believed that even those considered "reliable" after joining the military hadn't been "revolutionary" long enough for high loyalty to the collective; their "revolutionary will" wasn't firm. Sending them back deep into enemy territory for life-and-death "infiltrate and extract" enemy work wasn't suitable.

"The viable approach is still exploiting existing connections for a quick strike."

Lin Baiguang's "existing connection" was Shi Shisi. This man wasn't Zhu Cailao's core subordinate. From interrogations, they knew pirate groups highly valued blood relationships—core members were almost all relatives. Even without blood ties, they were servants or adopted sons with strong personal dependency. Shi Shisi had none of these.

"Zhu Cailao's core people would be hard to pull over—and would have complications even if we did. So my idea is recruiting peripheral minor leaders like Shi Shisi. First, their small scale makes them easy to absorb; second, being mid-to-lower level, joining us wouldn't create status-drop feelings."

Such peripheral backbone had group attachment emotions but wouldn't die for the cause—like modern company employees who'd definitely jump ship when it was sinking. Relatively easier to recruit.

"What's your plan?"

"First let me understand Shi Shisi's specific situation." Lin Baiguang said. "I'd like the Executive Committee to make me negotiation representative. This gives me reason to directly contact Shi Shisi, talk extensively, understand his thinking, build rapport—preparing for next steps."

"That's no problem." The Executive Committee didn't actually intend negotiating with Zhu Cailao anyway; having Lin Baiguang stall was perfect.

So the next day Lin Baiguang became negotiation representative. He first invited Security Bureau Technical Division Chief Wufo to set up a "bugging room."

"This is easy." Wufo was a seemingly honest but scheming middle-aged man, an electronics engineer by training, with a passionate hobby for electronic surveillance. Now he could openly practice his trade—peeping into others' secrets kept him youthfully energized daily.

"The surveillance target is..." Ran Yao explained the mission.

"If the subject has no concept of recording, it's simple: equipment needn't be sophisticated—just simple microphone pickup with tape recording."

Wufo favored tape recorders because, compared to precision digital devices like recording pens and computers, recorders and tapes better suited the transmigrator collective's future production capacity and technical level.

So Shi Shisi was lodged in a luxurious commercial house room—the house's most premium room. Furnishings were naturally comfortable and luxurious; the room was equipped with microphone and camera. This was specially for entertaining indigenous VIPs. Since this time-space had no such things, concealment was simple. Beside this room was a small hidden chamber with a secret passage and staircase, containing recording equipment and a monitor. Two people could listen simultaneously.

Next, Lin Baiguang found someone from former Zhu Cailao gang members who'd "joined the revolution"—someone familiar with Shi Shisi—assigning him to accompany Shi Shisi for dining and sightseeing these days, catching up on old times.

"Your task is ensuring he eats well and has fun. Understand?" Lin Baiguang raised his eyelids at this naval-uniformed man. Suddenly summoned by the Political Security Bureau, sweat was beading on his forehead—everyone knew these colorfully-dressed people with blue collar insignia were the Australians' Embroidered Guard.

"Budget is 100 Circulation Vouchers daily. Don't be afraid to spend."

"Yes, Chief!" The man snapped to attention and saluted.

"Whatever he thinks or says, report to me every evening."

"Understood, Chief!"

"Dismissed!"

The man saluted and quickly retreated. Lin Baiguang then phoned Dugu Qiuhun, simultaneously sending an OA email—containing digital photos of Shi Shisi and the assigned companion. As East Gate Market police station chief, Dugu controlled informants and part-time contacts.

"Starting tomorrow, 24-hour surveillance on these two. Daily surveillance reports to me."

"Who are you?!" Dugu Qiuhun's tone was impatient.

"I'm Lin Baiguang from Political Security Bureau. Problem?"

"Oh, oh—Political Security Bureau. No problem, no problem."

"Political Security Bureau, what's so special!" Dugu Qiuhun sneered inwardly.

Shi Shisi was happily enjoying VIP treatment at East Gate Market. Born poor, though he'd made money as a pirate, he rarely had places to spend it. Occasional landings for revelry were already lucky. Arriving at this dazzling world of East Gate Market, his eyes couldn't take it all in. He wished he could experience everything he'd never seen or tasted. His companion obligingly spent freely. At night, when street biogas lamps and carbide lamps all lit up, Shi Shisi sat behind the tavern's large glass window, gazing at the glittering streets with an intoxicated expression.

Unfortunately, East Gate Market's nightlife richness was still extremely backward. Shi Shisi disdained the local streetwalker quality. Given brothels' potential instability, and general reluctance to become brothel owners, East Gate Market remained at a primitive level in this regard.

According to various reports, Shi Shisi was enchanted by East Gate Market and filled with curiosity about Australians—last time he'd been captured, he'd only felt fear. This second visit to Lingao showed earthshaking changes. Shi Shisi found everything fresh.

When conversation touched Zhu Cailao's situation, Shi Shisi didn't hide—revealing that the brothers were all tired of fighting. Piracy was ultimately for personal wealth and pleasure; easy targets were best. Constant life-and-death combat was pointless!

Shi Shisi couldn't help recalling the good old days over a decade ago, when following Zhu Cailao they'd dominated Fujian-Guangdong waters, trading and robbing freely. Useless Imperial forces couldn't touch them. Various factions occasionally clashed, but never to Zheng Zhilong's you-die-or-I-die extremes. Here Shi Shisi expressed extreme hatred for Zheng Zhilong—without this traitor, maritime heroes wouldn't struggle so hard.

Lin Baiguang let him enjoy himself for several days. After reviewing full surveillance reports and wiretap transcripts, he'd basically grasped this man's personality and temperament before officially engaging Shi Shisi.

Though a 17th-century pirate minor captain might not be intellectually inferior to a 21st-century civil servant, regarding relationship-building, drinking, and schmoozing skills, Shi Shisi was far outmatched by an officialdom veteran like Lin Baiguang—not to mention Lin Baiguang was an office director by background, a position always held by "capable people."

Besides engaging Shi Shisi, he didn't neglect the pirate sailors lodging at Bo-pu. He personally accompanied them to bathhouses and tea houses. Seeing their tattered clothing, he ordered several dozen sailor work uniforms from the garment factory—outer clothes and underwear. This low-cost gesture won many hearts.

Evenings, he hosted sailors at Half-the-Sky Restaurant, treating them to fine food and drink. These pirate sailors were poor fishermen or bankrupt farmer refugees—though risking lives for money in pirate gangs with reasonably comfortable lives, they were still the lowest bottom-rung people. First-time visitors receiving such warm hospitality were naturally deeply moved. Plus his expansive demeanor and eloquence—within two days, the pirate sailors were calling him "brother." Lin Baiguang had excellent memory; after a few drinks, he could call out everyone's name. He always believed: sometimes a chance encounter or small favor could prove decisive at critical moments.

After dinner, Lin Baiguang thoughtfully had Dugu Qiuhun summon all East Gate Market's prostitutes to service the sailors—expenses naturally came from Political Security Bureau operational funds.

Dugu Qiuhun complained loudly about his instructions, directly phoning Ma Qianzhu to grumble.

"No problem—if he wants prostitutes, get him prostitutes!" Ma Qianzhu said indifferently over the phone.

"Public-funded prostitution—that's unprecedented..."

"This is mission execution. Just do whatever he requests."

So Dugu Qiuhun reluctantly sent a policeman to arrange it.

Handling Shi Shisi naturally wasn't so simple. Fortunately, besides drinking and bathing, Lin Baiguang had 20th-century new weapons sufficient to handle this 17th-century bumpkin.

That evening, after Shi Shisi had eaten and drunk his fill, he was led to a windowless room in the commercial house. A projector hung from the ceiling; Toshiba's English logo was projected blue onto the white wall.

Before Shi Shisi understood what was happening, the wall suddenly brightened. He nearly screamed in fright—lifelike human figures had suddenly appeared on the wall!

"Stay calm."

Soon Shi Shisi relaxed, then tensed again—but this tension came from massive hormone release. "Yamete" and women's suggestive moans filled the room.

The power of Teacher Sora Aoi was infinite. Shi Shisi naturally couldn't resist, completely defeated. Lin Baiguang watched coldly; halfway through, Shi Shisi repeatedly tried reaching out to touch certain parts of Teacher Aoi. However, the colorful shifting mosaic between the woman's legs clearly puzzled him.

When one finished, Shi Shisi impatiently asked: "What... is this..." His expression was both terrified and dazed, drool still trailing from his mouth. He looked like a creepy uncle seeing porn magazines for the first time.

"This is an Australian secret show, called AV."

"AV?" Shi Shisi nodded repeatedly. "Good watching, good watching. Can I watch again?"

"Wouldn't that be repetitive?" So they showed him an uncensored version. This time Shi Shisi watched with blood boiling, barely containing himself. Lin Baiguang thoughtfully arranged a prostitute in his room.

After this, their friendship progressed by leaps and bounds, becoming completely candid. Shi Shisi had thought the Australians' place was "quite nice"; now he thought it was "excellent." He inquired several times about Australian plans for Lingao—whether they intended permanent residence, whether they planned expanding locally. Lin Baiguang judged that besides scouting for Zhu Cailao, this questioning also implied evaluating potential new employers. This greatly increased his confidence in recruiting Shi Shisi.

Several days later, he approached Ran Yao with his proposal.

"What? You want to go back with Shi Shisi to Zhu Cailao?"

"Correct." Lin Baiguang nodded. "I've talked with Shi Shisi and sounded him out—Shi Shisi is very worried about the future. His words suggest that if Zhu Cailao falls into desperate straits, he definitely won't die for his leader."

"If so, can't we just recruit him directly?"

"In my view, recruiting him is no problem—he greatly envies our conditions. But his strength is too small." Lin Baiguang said. "Shi Shisi only has seven ships, under 400 men. Directly recruiting just him is meaningless to us."

So he thought Shi Shisi was too small a fish. Ran Yao thought: the Executive Committee hadn't specified their expectations, but merely recruiting Shi Shisi clearly wasn't impressive enough.

"Your appetite's not small. What's your plan?"

"Zhu Cailao's group has quite a few peripheral backbone like Shi Shisi. But these people don't have Shi Shisi's direct impression of our strength, so when defecting to other groups, we won't be their first choice." Lin Baiguang explained his plan: when defecting to a new power, people know little about it and naturally have misgivings. If a representative is present to explain, effects are much better—like companies doing on-site recruiting.

Infiltrating enemy territory to turn them was traditional enemy work; Lin Baiguang thinking of it was unsurprising. But this required exceptional courage. Ran Yao rather admired his nerve.

"What identity would you use at Zhu Cailao's? Shi Shisi can't secretly bring you there."

"I've thought about it. I'll go openly as negotiation envoy. Please have the Executive Committee give me a detailed negotiation plan, completely authentic." Though they didn't actually intend negotiating, preparations had to seem genuine to lower the other side's guard.

"That's no problem." Ran Yao said. "But the enemy is a fleet. Once aboard Zhu Cailao's ship, how much room for maneuver will you have? Even if they dock for resupply, you can hardly wander from ship to ship."

Lin Baiguang said: Shi Shisi had revealed important intelligence—Zhu Cailao was currently at Nanri.

Nanri Island was Fujian Province's third-largest island, located at the junction of Xinghua Bay and Pinghai Bay. Besides the main island, it had over a hundred islets and reefs. The island was 73 nautical miles from Taiwan's Hsinchu, geographically excellent—a suitable shelter and anchorage on Taiwan trade routes. Surrounding deep-water channels included the famous Nanri Waterway, historically a maritime north-south traffic hub. Zhu Cailao occupying here was obviously to access Taiwan trade routes.

This place had an anti-Japanese naval base in early Ming, later abandoned but still under nearby Qingshan Patrol Inspector jurisdiction. But in this time-space, due to collapsed Ming maritime defenses, it had long become a contested target for various maritime groups. Currently, Zhu Cailao's people were there.

Zhu Cailao was now at Nanri. As envoy, he'd certainly be sent to Nanri Island for talks. Once on the island, though movement was restricted, there was at least room for activity. Besides, he didn't intend directly urging defection to Lingao—rather using personal interaction to build some degree of trust.

Lin Baiguang continued explaining his plan: through his envoy status, contact Zhu Cailao, pretend willingness to support him, haggle over specific terms—actually stalling for time. While lingering, through Shi Shisi, meet a batch of peripheral mid-to-lower-level leaders. When Zhu Cailao's Min'an attack failed and morale collapsed, then urge them to defect to Lingao.

"How is that possible? Your talks with Zhu Cailao won't last a month—three to five days at most. I've worked police long enough—there's a saying 'rogues have many tricks.' Underworld types are more suspicious the higher their level. Once he suspects you, you're dead! Even if he doesn't suspect you, when talks conclude and you're asked to leave, you can't just refuse to go?"

"We don't have much time anyway—only thirty days until Zhu Cailao's death. I'll find ways to stay. For this plan to succeed, I must be with his fleet when he falls."

"Not only fanciful but too dangerous." Ran Yao said. "Even if you understand pirates, you may not accurately grasp this rabble's emotions and psychology. Besides, won't Zhu Cailao have planted his own people in the fleet? If you start recruiting, never mind whether they believe you—you might be directly killed."

"That's why we act after the Min'an defeat." Lin Baiguang insisted on his plan. After Min'an's defeat, Zhu Cailao's fleet would be pursued by Zheng Zhilong and Ming forces, soon dying at Nanri. At that point, he couldn't effectively control all ships—at most his core followers. When morale was shattered during the rout, with everyone seeking their own way out, rallying them could very likely succeed.
