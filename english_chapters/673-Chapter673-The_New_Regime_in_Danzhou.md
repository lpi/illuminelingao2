# Chapter 673 - The New Regime in Danzhou

After touring the area, Liu Yixiao selected the Chaotian Temple inside the city as headquarters. The Western Detachment camped and built a stockade outside the city walls. Old cities in Hainan's prefectures and counties were mostly cramped and small, lacking infrastructure, with poor sanitary conditions—unsuitable for development. So the Civil Affairs People's Committee, following the Lingao model, planned to select new sites for new towns. These would first serve as administrative and military garrison centers, gradually attracting merchants, slowly forming new urban cores.

After the Danzhou Work Team settled in at Chaotian Temple, Liu Yixiao immediately summoned the Danzhou County Bailiff, Yin Chengshi, who had organized the surrender, to report.

"Your humble servant... humble servant... Yin Chengshi..." Along with the name announcement from the courtyard, a local attendant jogged up to deliver a *shou ben*, the personal dossier.

The *shou ben* was equivalent to a personal history—useful for understanding someone's basic situation. Liu Yixiao had learned about these in lectures and how to read them. He opened it and glanced through, then flipped open the *Conversion Handbook* beside him to convert the cyclical dates to CE, learning the man was already fifty-eight years old.

Yin Chengshi's registered residence was Beizhili. His degree was "Selected Tribute"—which explained why, at his age, he had ended up at the ends of the earth as a lowly county bailiff.

A fifty-eight-year-old, serving as a minor official in a wilderness far from home. Though he could scrape together some money, the price was potentially leaving his bones here at any moment. Quite miserable. No wonder petty officials like Sun Ruiwu felt no attachment to the Ming.

"Show Bailiff Yin in."

Yin Chengshi entered cautiously. Having sold himself over, he naturally had to demonstrate his sincerity to the maximum. A county bailiff was "below the flow"—his official robes had no rank patch—but he wore his freshly washed official robe neatly.

"Your humble servant Yin Chengshi pays respects to Your Honor." He said, smoothly kneeling to kowtow.

Liu Yixiao had grown accustomed to the kowtowing customs of this timeline's natives, but having such an old man kowtow to him still felt awkward. "Rise. We don't practice this."

"Yes, yes. Thank you, Your Honor." Yin Chengshi carefully stood and presented his gift list.

The gift list represented a joint offering from Danzhou's gentry and wealthy households: ten pigs, one hundred chickens, one hundred bolts of local cotton cloth, twenty bolts of silk, and fifty *shi* of unpolished rice.

Liu Yixiao nodded and had someone receive them. He examined this first Ming official to surrender proactively. Yin Chengshi looked ancient—like seventy or eighty—though his movements were still agile. Natives of this timeline looked decrepit once they passed fifty, but he hadn't expected quite this old.

Yin Chengshi cautiously glanced at his new superior. His state of mind was complicated. He didn't want to die as a Ming martyr, yet feared these new foreign rulers wouldn't value his allegiance, and even more feared they might suspect his surrender was a trap—which would mean immediate execution.

He had heard the Australians' reputation: not particularly bloodthirsty, but ruthless when they did kill.

"You're the only official left in the city?"

"Yes, Your Honor." Yin Chengshi felt slightly reassured when he asked about local affairs. If he was asking questions, he wouldn't kill casually.

Danzhou had originally had four officials, though the positions were chronically understaffed. After the prefect's suicide, only Yin remained alone. He himself had served as county bailiff in Danzhou for over five years and was very familiar with local conditions.

Liu Yixiao asked about local populations, taxes, and power structures. Yin Chengshi answered thoroughly, very familiar with local affairs, answering one question with ten. Liu Yixiao was quite satisfied. Technical competence aside, this level of familiarity with local administration surpassed most officials.

It seemed this was a useful man. Appropriately retaining local officials willing to serve was established policy set by Liu Muzhou—especially before sufficient new cadres were available to replace them. It could also serve as an example for officials elsewhere.

"You must have done quite well for yourself as county bailiff."

"Well, this... this..." Yin Chengshi's face contorted, fearing he was about to be squeezed for bribes. County bailiffs could indeed make a good profit. "Your humble servant did have some benefits, but dared not go too far..." He glanced at Liu Yixiao, wondering silently how heavy a gift would satisfy him. He did have a gift list in his sleeve. He hastily produced it.

"This is your humble servant's small token—a trifle—please accept it, Your Honor."

The most valuable item on the list was one hundred taels of silver, plus cloth and silk. For this backwater, being able to produce a hundred taels for a bribe meant this bailiff had been quite skilled at accumulating wealth.

"You're quite good at extracting money."

These words struck like a thunderbolt. Yin Chengshi immediately went weak—he thought these Australians were putting on a "righteous judge" act, planning to use his head to win popular support. He instantly kowtowed repeatedly, begging for mercy.

"I won't take your gift. At your age, coming here to be a petty official, isn't it all for a bit of money?" Liu Yixiao said magnanimously.

Actually, he was seething inside. Liu Yixiao despised corrupt officials and had an impulse to kill every one he encountered. But he understood that killing wouldn't solve the problem.

Right now, they needed people. He couldn't lose the help of this local official who understood the area so well.

"Yes, yes. Your humble servant deserves death..."

"Deserving death before the Ming—we don't care about that." Liu Yixiao said. "Our Ao-Song regime consistently takes a 'dialectical' approach. Your past crimes were caused by the Ming system; you too are a victim."

Yin Chengshi couldn't understand how he, a corrupt official, had become a "victim," but he agreed with whatever the Australians said, repeatedly saying "yes."

"...But now that you serve Ao-Song, there's no room for such behavior. Understand!"

"Your humble servant understands, understands!"

"Good. Take your gift back. I don't want it. I now appoint you General Liaison Officer for Danzhou and Deputy Director of the Danzhou Post-Disaster Management Bureau. All dealings with local natives will go through you. You must handle affairs properly—no extortion or troublemaking."

"Your humble servant absolutely would not dare," Yin Chengshi assumed an expression of deep remorse. "Your humble servant will absolutely reform and serve the Ao-Song Emperor with all his heart!"

"Gather all the runners and clerks who haven't fled from the yamen. I have things to do."

They brought out Danzhou Prefecture's official seal. Liu Yixiao ordered immediate posting of a public notice—telling citizens inside the city and in the surrounding countryside not to panic, to continue their occupations peacefully.

After gathering basic administrative personnel, Liu Yixiao ordered cases to be heard on-site in the Chaotian Temple courtyard. The Danzhou prefecture jail and the penal office's detention cells still held over a hundred people. These had to be quickly cleared out.

He had brought retained personnel from the former Lingao County yamen's penal office to help handle cases. They reviewed the detained prisoners. The Arbitration Court's Legal Research Office had conducted special research on how to clear cases and prisons after taking over local regimes, consulting Wang Zaomin and the retained penal staff as advisors, studying many procedural issues and abuses in depth, finally compiling a specialized manual for takeover personnel.

This manual detailed regulations for case processing and prisoner disposition after regime takeover. Generally, peasant revolts or dynastic changes that captured cities would "release all prisoners" as a display of "benevolent governance." But by modern standards, this approach was questionable.

No matter how dark a regime or corrupt its judiciary, prisons couldn't possibly contain only innocent, wrongly convicted people. There were inevitably genuine criminals among them, some even vicious ones.

Releasing everyone indiscriminately might feel satisfying momentarily, but resulted in chaos and created massive social instability. Even in the old timeline, such examples were not lacking.

With retained personnel's help, Liu Yixiao quickly sorted through the dossiers and prisoner situations.

Tax and rent defaulters—all released immediately. Those confirmed as actual criminals would, following Lingao's example, form a labor reform team, to be relocated within the city—prison conditions were atrocious and would only waste precious manpower.

Retrying cases where people claimed wrongful conviction wasn't difficult either. Almost all wrongful convictions couldn't fool insiders—sometimes couldn't even fool outsiders. The main obstacles to overturning verdicts were entangled interests and personal relationships. Now that heaven and earth had changed, those relationships no longer existed, making things easy to sort out.

In less than a day, they had cleared the most pressing prison administration issues. Ancients highly valued local officials' judicial capabilities, considering it an important metric for evaluating local officials' ability. The work team's immediate handling of this matter upon taking power earned image points.

As public sentiment in Danzhou gradually settled, Liu Yixiao knew his preliminary work was showing results. He summoned Yin Chengshi to prepare a list—Liu Yixiao was about to convene the "First Danzhou Political Consultative Conference."

"Every village must send representatives. Also, every wealthy household and gentry family in the county must send one person to attend the conference." Liu Yixiao instructed General Liaison Officer Yin Chengshi. "The Post-Disaster Bureau committee positions will be filled by the wealthy families. This is for the benefit of the local community. No absences permitted."

"Yes, your humble servant understands!" Yin Chengshi was very enthusiastic.

Through convening the Political Consultative Conference, they would first establish a "liaison officer" system at the grassroots village level. Through this system, they would ensure preliminary control over the grassroots and transmission of government orders.

Conscripting labor, requisitioning grain, assigning tasks—these weren't simple coercive extortion but the most effective methods for rapidly imparting governing will to the grassroots. Through these measures, they would quickly gain control of substantial population and resources for the work team's use.
