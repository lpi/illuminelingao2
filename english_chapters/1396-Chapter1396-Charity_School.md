# Chapter 1396 - Charity School

Wang Rong'er was an inside line in the villa that Gou Chengxuan handed over to Hao Yuan. Hao Yuan's instruction to her was simple: try to place Jia Le beside Xihua.

Xihua was the "Huang Gai" in the "bitter meat trick"; this was what Hao Yuan had already judged correctly. But from various intelligence gathered, Xihua still had the potential to be instigated to turn against her master. And Jia Le was the first move in his plan.

Jia Le was a little girl. Although loyal enough to him, the time was too short and her age too young to influence silently. Therefore, the task he assigned to Jia Le was only to try to lure Xihua to meet him. The work of instigating Xihua would be done by himself personally.

He was very sure that Zhao Yingong, now eager to trace the mastermind behind the scenes, would very likely instruct Xihua to swallow this fragrant bait regardless of everything.

"I am a newly arrived child; it will be very difficult, right?"

"It doesn't matter. You do as I instructed, and Xihua will definitely agree." Hao Yuan was confident.

"Okay, I listen to you, Uncle Hao." Jia Le nodded firmly, but she immediately became worried again, "Can it really work?"

"Definitely no problem."

Hao Yuan thought, actually Jia Le was transparent. Xihua probably already knew who she was, otherwise how could she easily agree to place her in the school? As soon as Jia Le opened her mouth, Zhao Yingong would also know immediately. But this didn't matter. As long as Jia Le pretended to persuade her, she would agree—otherwise, how could her bitter meat trick continue?

Jia Le was Jiang Gan, cooperating with Master Zhao to act out the bitter meat trick, but he, Hao Yuan, was not Cao Cao.

Jia Le didn't spend much effort getting into the villa—although Phoenix Mountain Villa didn't lack labor, Zhao Yingong, from his experience of later generations, still thought some benefits should be appropriately shared with local people, and it was not suitable to handle everything by himself. So he also hired some local people to work.

Phoenix Mountain Villa hired quite a few local commoners. The review wasn't strict either; having a shop or Paijia as guarantor was enough. All "hired laborers" had to stay overnight inside the villa—living in the dormitory of the refugee camp at the foot of the mountain. This was mainly for hygiene considerations. Hired laborers also had to undergo purification treatment. Although there was no need to shave heads, procedures like bathing and issuing clothes were the same. If going back and forth daily, it was very likely to bring parasites from outside into the camp in the camp.

However, these hired local workers could only serve in Cihui Hall at the foot of the mountain, couldn't go up the mountain, nor enter the "restricted area" at the foot of the mountain. Only a very few professional "skilled hands" and artisans could enter the restricted area to work with passes.

Jia Le signed on the employment contract and was taken in for purification—bathing and changing clothes. To prevent shocking public opinion, hired workers were not shaved here during purification.

After bathing, as usual, a full set of clothes from inside out was issued, even including replacements.

"These clothes are awarded to you by Master," the servant woman who brought her said, "After working for a full year, these clothes will be yours. If not working for full term and resigning, clothes money will be deducted from your wages."

"Understood, Mama."

"Remember to change and wash clothes frequently, bathe and wash hair often, and cut nails—Master hates unclean people most. Someone checks every day. If receiving bad rating three times, money will be deducted. You be careful!" The servant woman leading her in was a level-five servant who couldn't even go up the mountain, but was still very majestic in front of new hired workers.

"Yes, thank you Mama for reminding."

The area of Cihui Hall was very large. The servant woman led her through passageways. Jia Le saw that the walls of this refugee camp were mostly bamboo fences. Through gaps in fences, one could see rows of somewhat simple houses in the courtyard, some with bamboo strip walls, some with wooden plank walls, only wall foundations were brick and stone. But roofs were covered with tiles.

Although houses were simple, they didn't have the appearance of slums with sewage flowing across, garbage everywhere, and stink reaching sky. In an open space, many wooden stakes were driven, ropes pulled, rows of clothes and sheets hanging for drying, neat and tidy. People working and moving in courtyard were also dressed cleanly and neatly, actually a few degrees neater and cleaner than people in Nanxiawa. Although quite a few people were busy in courtyard, there was no sound of noise, fighting or joking, a scene of quietness, only rustling sound of wind blowing drying clothes.

"This is the poor relief station of Cihui Hall." Seeing she was very interested in this, the servant woman pointed and said, "This is South First Station. Going north there are Second Station, Third Station... divided into eight stations north and south."

"So many, are there people living in all?" Jia Le asked sincerely with doubt.

"Of course people living. One station is residence for one thousand people. Basically all full. You calculate how many people here!" Servant woman said somewhat proudly, "Not only these eight stations north and south, inside there are Qingjie Hall, Orphanage... nearly twenty thousand people relying on Master's kind heart to survive."

Although Jia Le had long been "educated" by Hao Yuan that Zhao Yingong was a "hypocritical" evil man, seeing order here organized, scene peaceful and auspicious with own eyes, couldn't help being somewhat doubtful.

Jia Le was led, walking straight to place near mountain foot. Here was another large courtyard, similarly rows of houses.

"Here is the Charity School of Cihui Hall. You serve here in future." Servant woman said, shouting towards inside, "Miss Xihua! Miss Xihua!"

"What matter?"

Door curtain lifted, from first room walked out a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl with clothes and hair perfectly in order, a face very serious. Jia Le knew this was probably Xihua, hurriedly dropped hands standing behind servant woman.

"Miss Xihua, this is Jia Le recommended by Sister-in-law Wang..." Servant woman smiling fully, bowing said.

Jia Le was very clever, immediately came up and blessed a blessing: "Sister ten thousand blessings."

Xihua nodded: "You are Jia Le?"

"Yes, receiving instruction. This servant is."

"Recognize characters?"

"Can read Three Character Classic, cannot write..."

"Considered not bad." Xihua nodded, "You live in East Sixth Room. Put down things and come to my place. Plenty of work for you to do."

From this day on, Jia Le served in Charity School of Cihui Hall. Although this Charity School nominally adopted traditional children's primers like Three Character Classic, Thousand Character Classic, actually it was conducted according to literacy education method of Lingao. Purpose was only to give refugee children a little basic reading writing calculating ability during waiting for transport stage, additionally teaching taken-in orphans a little "rules."

Jia Le's work was very miscellaneous, almost doing everything. So many children being taken in Cihui Hall made Jia Le very surprised: Every child looked full, dressed well, face and hands all clean, without any parasites and pustules common on poor children. That happy healthy complexion when they ran and played in open field during break, she had never seen in Nanxiawa.

The room for twenty people they lived in had all clean bunk beds, one bed per person, everyone had sleeping mat, pillow, and quilt. Jia Le lived for twelve years, had never had own pillow and quilt—she always shared one with sisters. As for pillow, that was something never existed.

Food was also surprisingly good. Children here had three meals a day, rice and miscellaneous grains enough to eat, vegetables every meal, meat once every five days. With this food, let alone Nanxiawa, even common people in whole Hangzhou City few could eat like this. No wonder Sister-in-law Wang said, refugee beggar children on street, as long as taken by Cihui Hall, that was going to heaven.

This was not one or two children, but several hundred! Jia Le secretly clicked tongue, how much money did this Master Zhao have! Although Cihui Hall had quite a few Benevolent Directors, everyone knew here was led by Master Zhao, obviously he paid most.

This made Jia Le somewhat confused instead. What did Master Zhao seek for doing such big good deed? Uncle Hao said, some evil people doing good were either seeking peace of mind, or confusing world people, not letting world people see clear their true face of doing evil. But, in Jia Le's limited cognition, such thing of throwing dust to blind eyes seemed not needing to be done so big—rich people wanting to do good accumulating virtue winning false reputation, methods of spending little money gaining big fame were plenty, why engage in charity hall such thing spending money all year round? Besides scale of this charity hall was so big! Although Jia Le had no economic mind, also knew expense here for a day was enough for ordinary common people to work for a lifetime.

Although full of doubts, Jia Le still worked diligently and thriftily in Charity School. She came with purpose originally, naturally doing things extra attentive. Although management mode of Cihui Hall strict, under Council of Elders' management system, "more work more pay" and "roughly guaranteeing fairness" these two points were guaranteed. As long as doing things diligently seriously, would not suffer loss. Therefore Jia Le's work enthusiasm was mobilized quickly. She was capable in doing things, also being small and sweet-mouthed, soon established good popularity here.

However, her crucial purpose, contacting Xihua was never quite successful. Xihua had many things, almost no free time allowing her to approach. At night rest time, she also had no excuse to go to her room to talk.

Uncle Hao clearly said: even if she didn't look for her, she would come to look for herself. How come no movement at all now?

While being anxious, this evening she handed over shift, ate dinner, fetched hot water just about to wash, suddenly came a servant woman, asking her to go see Xihua immediately.

"Yes, I come right away." Jia Le heart moved, heart instantly thumped thumped. Didn't know what matter Xihua suddenly called her for? Regardless what matter, this was a great opportunity to be alone with her. Thinking so hastily wiped face, then tided hair, checked clothes on body, went out of dormitory towards Xihua's dormitory.

Xihua lived in Steward Room small courtyard of Charity School. Steward Room was a separate courtyard, at night only Xihua and several steward servant women lived inside, very quiet. Xihua as side user beside Master, occupied rear wing room alone.
