# Chapter 2005 - Two Elders Concerned With Naturalized Marriage (II)

Guangzhou had a population of several hundred thousand—the largest city in southern China in the seventeenth century. There were certainly plenty of eligible women. Wang Jun calculated that there was absolutely no need to focus solely on "female prisoners" or "chaste widows"—how many of those were there anyway?

Then he hit another snag. Guangzhou certainly had quite a few eligible single women, but surely he couldn't matchmake them one by one himself? As for opening a matchmaking agency, there was no precedent in this time period. There were official matchmakers who sold off and arranged marriages—but since official matchmakers mostly dealt with minor female offenders, such occasions weren't common.

The marriage situation of Guangzhou's commoners was still basically "parental orders, matchmaker's words." Weddings ranged from extravagant to simple, but the process was essentially the same—even boat-dwelling Tanka people followed this pattern.

Wang Jun seriously considered the feasibility of opening a matchmaking agency in seventeenth-century Guangzhou and found the difficulty substantial. Moreover, it wasn't his area of expertise—he'd never been any kind of union activist, and he had poor relations with the "auntie matchmakers" at his company. He had no relevant knowledge. After racking his brains for a while, he couldn't figure out how to run a matchmaking agency.

Thinking about all this was giving him a headache. He couldn't help muttering: "Damn, this is even harder than all those blind dates back then!"

Yet this sentence immediately sparked his inspiration. He remembered being forced by his parents to attend blind dates, and how the matchmaking agency not only introduced individual matches but often organized "matchmaking parties," gathering men and women of similar conditions for barbecues, road trips, and so on. Quite a few people successfully hooked up during these events.

"This is the way!" Wang Jun felt like he'd discovered a new continent. Of course, road trips and outdoor barbecues couldn't be done in the seventeenth century, but other forms of matchmaking events could be organized.

After racking his brains for a while, he thought of holding a dance—but ballroom dancing had only been taught to girls at the Women's Liberal Arts Academy. Even among the Elders, not many knew how. Besides, men and women embracing each other and swaying around—while that would be fine in Lingao, it would be too shocking for the "feudal remnants" stronghold of Guangzhou. Just announcing such an event would probably scare off all the local single women.

Beyond that, he really couldn't think of any new format. He decided to just hold a simple "pass-the-flower" matchmaking event for "mutual selection"—he'd attended such matchmaking events himself, and similar ones had been held for naturalized citizens in Lingao. Though those who enjoyed such treatment were mostly officers and naturalized cadres and skilled workers.

With this in mind, he immediately wrote an "enthusiastic" letter to this Elder Du he'd never met, expressing his support for the idea and his willingness to discuss "solving naturalized citizens' marriage problems" together.

Meanwhile, Elder Du's "female prisoner plan" hadn't been approved, so he went directly to Liu Xiang—who, upon hearing he'd come about "naturalized citizen marriage" issues, immediately claimed to be busy and had Zhang Yunmi receive him instead.

Du Yibin hadn't expected to encounter Zhang Yunmi—he didn't actually know her. But after that "fierce concubine" case, the Zhang father and daughter had become famous throughout the Council of Elders, and Zhang Yunmi's appointment to a position in Guangzhou had been published in the government gazette.

Six years after the crossing, Du Yibin was nearly thirty, but essentially still the same college student he'd been. Thanks to the General Office's life secretary benefits and his parents' meticulous care following him through the crossing, he still had a college student's awkwardness when facing female Elders. Suddenly confronted by a young, beautiful, lively girl, his specific proposal introduction became rather stammering.

Zhang Yunmi listened to his proposal and flipped through the documents. She frowned.

"Promoting monogamy is one of the Council's New Life Movement provisions—how can we take the lead in violating it? Even if they're disabled veterans, special treatment is unacceptable. Besides, female prisoners may have committed crimes, but they're still women with the right to marital autonomy! Your proposal assigns them to people like objects—this contradicts the Council's advocacy of gender equality..."

"Um, actually it's fine, we don't need to do the two wives thing... um, the female prisoner thing is off, mainly hoping to find some women to marry disabled naturalized citizens to care for their lives, establish families, carry on the family line. So I was thinking whether among the women in Qingjie Hall..."

"Caring for their lives is fine, but why must they marry them?!" Zhang Yunmi couldn't understand. "Disabled naturalized citizens are certainly pitiful, and they have merit with the Council. But that's separate from emotions! Freedom of marriage, marital autonomy—isn't this what we preach daily? Now doing this organizational arrangement shows great disrespect for women. Just because we liberated Guangzhou and freed those poor chaste widows doesn't mean we're their benefactors who can casually interfere in their private lives."

Zhang Yunmi was young and influenced by popular twenty-first-century novels, retaining somewhat of a "love is supreme" mentality. She'd originally been quite resistant to the Council's "arranged marriages."

But her speech was all grand principles, leaving Du Yibin speechless. But he absolutely needed Guangzhou City Government's support for his plan—Cihuei Hall currently held several hundred homeless chaste widows collected from various Qingjie Halls and Widow Halls throughout Guangdong. Unfortunately, Zhang Yunmi was both city government secretary and deputy director of comprehensive governance, and since Liu Xiang wasn't willing to handle this matter, it had to go through her.

"Marital autonomy is correct, but our conditions aren't bad either. Five Oaks has already promised me: if she agrees to marry a disabled naturalized citizen, these disabled personnel will receive an additional 1.5x family allowance beyond their original wages..."

"This is mercenary marriage—not good at all." Zhang Yunmi shook her head even harder.

"This—"

Du Yibin was tongue-tied. He truly couldn't think of any other reason to persuade her. After a long while, he finally said: "These people became disabled for the Council. Some from workplace injuries, some from battlefield wounds... If we don't help solve their life-long matters, they'll never have families in their lives. They were all healthy people originally..."

This somewhat melancholic statement moved Zhang Yunmi somewhat. She wavered, saying: "I can't really make the decision on this either. After all, it's a woman's lifelong matter. It still needs to be voluntary. If they're willing to marry, I won't object—Director Liu won't object either."

Elder Du returned to the guesthouse somewhat disheartened. He didn't even go to the cafeteria for dinner, feeling like a failure. Lying in bed, he thought again about how to completely convince Song Yingsheng—this was his greatest "harvest" from going to Enping, even giving him a sense of having found a diamond in the rough.

Song Yingsheng wasn't a famous figure himself; he was only recorded in local gazetteers. But he was the elder brother of Song Yingxing, a contemporary figure rather highly rated within the Council of Elders.

Song Yingxing was then in his prime, serving as education officer at the Fenyi County Academy, devoted to his scholarly work. More than one Elder within the Council intended to recruit this Ming-era scientist, and even the Intelligence Bureau's Yangtze Special Task Force had conducted some related activities.

Though they hadn't recruited him yet, capturing his elder brother was still a gain. Du Yibin had specifically instructed the National Army captain sent to receive Enping: Song Yingsheng must be captured alive.

Song Yingsheng, though not famous, was quite resolute in character. He'd poisoned himself to death for the nation after the Southern Ming collapsed—his loyalty to the Ming was evident. So capturing him alive took some effort. Before storming the city, Du Yibin, through the External Intelligence Bureau's contacts in Enping, managed to capture him before he could commit suicide.

After his capture, Song Yingsheng was placed under soft confinement in the county yamen, enjoying "preferential treatment" that baffled him. Ordinarily, captured local officials of his rank would be sent to Guangzhou for screening, but he'd been kept in the county due to Du Yibin's special request.

Unfortunately, Du Yibin's persuasive skills were limited. Though he'd pulled out all the stops, and Song Yingsheng had shown no intention of "martyrdom" and was quite courteous to him, he still wouldn't "surrender to Song." This time Du Yibin had specifically brought him to Guangzhou to show him the "new atmosphere."

"This old man is really stubborn too!" he complained silently. Thinking about how everything had gone wrong since coming to the mainland, he couldn't help missing his parents and life secretary back in Lingao.

With nothing better to do, his gaze fell on the office desk, where some correspondence was piled. He looked through them one by one, and suddenly saw a "private memorandum" from an Elder he didn't recognize.

"Who's Wang Jun?" Du Yibin curiously opened the envelope.

Two days later, at the South Sea Coffee House's Great World branch, Du Yibin met Wang Jun.

After exchanging pleasantries, the two immediately launched into a heated discussion about "naturalized citizens' marriage problems." Du Yibin described the result of his meeting with Zhang Yunmi.

"This girl talks nothing but grand principles. I couldn't out-argue her," Du Yibin said somewhat dejectedly. "I'm not good with words."

Wang Jun thought: your proposal might have been fine in the past, but political correctness left over from the twenty-first century still has considerable influence in the Council of Elders. Many clauses in this proposal were simply brimming with "incorrectness."

"This proposal really needs to be rewritten," Wang Jun thought for a moment and said. "Gender equality is one of the Council's pillar policies. Writing things like 'distributing wives,' 'distributing two wives'—isn't that working against Council policy? And what would the female Elders think?"

"I understand that now. Tell me—how should we handle this?"

"I think we should write it this way: the proposal should address solving the marriage problems of naturalized cadres and workers in general, not specifically 'disabled naturalized workers.' This broadens the audience. Plus it avoids the disability issue—everyone actually understands that under normal circumstances, what healthy woman would want to marry a disabled man? It'll have to rely on spiritual and material incentives, plus some administrative pressure—you were eyeing female prisoners precisely because of this. The thinking isn't wrong, but these things are understood, not stated explicitly."
