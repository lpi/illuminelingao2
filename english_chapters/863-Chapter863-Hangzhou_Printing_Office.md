# Chapter 863 - Hangzhou Printing Office

Zhao Yingong's application report encountered no objections at the Planning Commission's project review. However, the supervising department—the External Intelligence Bureau—expressed reservations about his immediate entry into the silk industry. In Jiang Shan's view and others', this was too risky. The silk industry was a popular industrial sector at the time, one in which officials and gentry were deeply involved. For Zhao Yingong to immediately establish a modernized silk-reeling factory was a textbook case of inviting trouble.

"He's preparing to be a fat pig, just waiting for someone to slaughter him. We absolutely must stop him," Li Yan said to Jiang Shan in the conference room. "The moment a silk-reeling factory opens, it'll be just like when the Leizhou sugar factory launched—an earth-shaking spectacle. He says he'll only do reeling and not get involved in distribution or silk weaving—well, the Leizhou Station thought the same thing, and they were immediately targeted and attacked. If Leizhou wasn't right across the strait, with the Elder Council providing full support at rapid speed, they would've been wiped out!"

Jiang Shan agreed: "I think so too. But we can't be too hesitant about everything. He's eager to make money and establish himself—I understand. Right now, without money, he can't open up the situation."

"There are many ways to open up a situation. Besides, doesn't he have support from the land and sea routes? Wanyou is about to open a Hangzhou branch..."

"He doesn't have the authority to freely draw funds from Wanyou—you know the financial discipline. Obviously, he needs money right now." Jiang Shan said. At a recent inter-departmental meeting of the External Intelligence Bureau, they had coordinated financial matters for overseas-stationed elders, stipulating that any elder could not directly withdraw cash from the land and sea route businesses beyond their designated intelligence activity allowance. They could only temporarily borrow cash in necessary circumstances, and even then there was a quota.

This rule was designed to prevent overseas elders from fancying themselves "commercial geniuses" and privately engaging in "business operations." Wasting operational funds was one thing, but if their schemes failed and crashed enterprises instead—that would be embarrassing. So whether state-owned or joint-venture, the land and sea route enterprises were all centrally operated by the commercial departments. Unless an overseas elder was specifically designated to manage and operate land and sea route outlets, their role was only to provide a certain level of support to overseas stations.

"He can find other ways to make money, starting with low-capital industries," Li Yan said. "I suggest starting with the book business. Publishing."

Hangzhou's publishing industry was only "mid-tier" in the Ming Dynasty—far below Suzhou and Nanjing. There weren't many bookshops, and their influence wasn't particularly significant. Compared to the extremely lucrative silk industry, the book-carving trade was capital-intensive, slow to turn over, and not especially profitable—not an industry that officials and gentry were eager to enter. Li Yan believed that having Zhao Yingong first enter the book-carving industry was the optimal choice.

Jiang Shan said: "But Zhao Yingong's enthusiasm is very high. And his proposal immediately hit the G-spot of the Light Industry Department, the Foreign Trade Company, and the Agricultural Committee. These departments will probably express enthusiastic support. I'm afraid it'll be passed at the Elder Council committee meeting in one shot."

If passed by the Standing Committee, it would become a Planning Commission operational project. Even if the External Intelligence Bureau objected, it probably wouldn't have much effect.

He paced a few circles, then stopped and said: "No matter. The equipment for a modernized silk-reeling factory can't be completed overnight—it'll take at least half a year. We'll have the Agricultural Committee help the Hangzhou Station with silkworm eggs and mulberry cultivation improvement—that's the foundation of sericulture reform, and Zhao Yingong won't object."

Improving silkworm varieties and mulberry planting wouldn't attract much attention—far less impact than immediately setting up a new-method reeling factory. To people of this era, this was so-called "agricultural fundamentals"—gentry could personally manage such operations without anyone looking down on them; in fact, it was quite respectable.

"...This will take at least most of a year. By the time Zhao Yingong wants to build a reeling factory, the situation should have already changed. Building a reeling factory then won't be a problem." Jiang Shan was quite pleased with himself.

Li Yan thought this was just a "stalling" tactic, but he acknowledged the reasoning was sound. He also considered that Zhao Yingong's report mentioned two directions: a silk-reeling factory and a printing-publishing business. Given Hangzhou's manpower and resources, both couldn't be pursued simultaneously. Focusing on one project for now was entirely reasonable, and Zhao Yingong probably wouldn't object.

Li Yan first consulted with the Planning Commission, then also summoned Tan Ming, the printing factory director, and Zhou Dongtian from the publication guidance group. Several people held a meeting to discuss how to approach publishing in Hangzhou.

Wu De's opinion was that for now, there was no need to establish a printing operation in Hangzhou—they could simply ship books from Lingao for sale. Lingao's printing factory had already installed lithographic printing equipment and could print lithographic materials at considerable scale. Shipping a certain quantity of books to Hangzhou was feasible.

"...But I don't know how many books Hangzhou needs, or what types." Tan Ming wasn't sure. Although production capacity had increased, the printing factory's workload was very heavy—the massive volume of textbooks and instructional pamphlets made the factory extremely busy.

Zhou Dongtian said: "Looking at his application, Hangzhou will definitely need many varieties in small quantities. That'll be somewhat difficult for the printing factory."

Many varieties meant composing many different typesetting runs, with low print runs each time—quite uneconomical for a printing factory.

The final decision was: first ship a batch of existing books from Lingao to Hangzhou. Simultaneously, ship simple printing equipment to Hangzhou. Zhou Dongtian suggested sending two types. One was the simplest hand-cranked printing press. This press didn't require typesetting—it used paper or lead stereotype plates for printing.

Although many people think of "movable type printing" when modern printing is mentioned, true "movable type printing" actually wasn't widely used. Including modern phototypesetting, most modern printing technologies followed the principle of block printing—the only difference was that the speed and efficiency of making blocks had greatly improved compared to carving printing plates.

In the "movable type printing" era, book printing used movable type composition, then thick cardboard or thin lead plates were pressed onto the composed type to create "paper stereotypes" or "lead stereotypes." These stereotypes were then put on printing presses. After printing was complete, this method greatly reduced lead type wear. Moreover, paper and lead stereotypes could be preserved for considerable periods. If a book might be reprinted, stereotypes could be retrieved from storage and printed immediately, saving the trouble of re-composing with lead type. This essentially combined the advantages of both movable type and block printing.

Paper and lead stereotypes were lighter, smaller, and cheaper than heavy wooden printing blocks. They were the most common book printing technique before the spread of modern photographic plate-making technology. Zhao Yingong's planned Hangzhou printing office couldn't possibly train a new batch of specialized typesetters, so the simplest method was to duplicate the various paper and lead stereotypes currently stored at the Lingao printing factory and ship them over. Hangzhou only needed to prepare a few simple manual printing presses to meet their needs.

"I recommend the Albion type," Zhou Dongtian said. "This manual printing press has been considered the best manual press since its invention. Many print shops in the 20th century still used it. To this day, many printing enthusiasts revere this machine."

The Albion press was simple, lightweight in structure, yet had great printing force—a very suitable choice for Hangzhou's printing office. The drawback was the same as all platen presses: using flat-plate pressure meant printing efficiency couldn't match cylinder presses.

"Last time, we researched replicating this machine with the machinery factory people. We think we can improve it to increase production efficiency, including using water wheel or steam engine power. Also, we'd eliminate the spring."

The Albion press had a key spring component; after research, they had replaced this part with an alternative mechanism.

"But doing it this way, the typesetting work still falls to Lingao's printing factory. And most of our current stereotype stock isn't suitable for sale in Hangzhou anyway," Tan Ming said—the printing factory's typesetting work was already busy enough.

Lingao's printing office had accumulated over a thousand types of stereotypes, but most were technical and management pamphlets for internal Lingao use, various textbooks, and propaganda materials. Books suitable for sale in the Ming Dynasty were limited to small quantities of the Four Books and Five Classics, Qing dynasty annotations of the Thirteen Classics, some common classics, histories, philosophers, and collected works, plus Catholic Church and New Daoist religious pamphlets.

Zhou Dongtian said: "That can't be helped. We'll gradually build up the typesetting process locally later."

The other piece of equipment was a lithographic press. Lithography was essentially also a form of block printing, but used protective coatings and etching agents as materials. Lithography was suited for printing images and small-batch text materials—quite appropriate for the Hangzhou printing office's need for small quantities of many varieties.

Although these two types of equipment seemed simple, they still couldn't be replicated with 17th-century technology. There was no possibility of the "technology leak" that the Elder Council most feared.

Zhou Dongtian said: "I've applied before, wanting to visit the Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou area to observe the local woodblock printing industry. I'd also see if I could recruit some master woodblock craftsmen—the printing factory has great demand for block workers. This time I'd like to go to Hangzhou with the books and printing equipment, help Zhao Yingong get the printing office set up—after all, I'm a professional. I can also examine Jiangnan's printing industry and recruit a few craftsmen."

Zhou Dongtian had submitted this application to visit Jiangnan long ago. At the time, there was no base in Jiangnan, so the Planning Commission naturally couldn't approve it. Now that he was raising it again, his reasons seemed very sound. Wu De naturally wouldn't object. He turned his gaze to Li Yan.

"He hasn't received training—is there a problem sending him to Jiangnan?"

Li Yan said: "Escorting him to Jiangnan isn't a problem. We have contingency plans for elders making short-term trips to red zones."
