# Chapter 12: Taiwan or Hainan

Where should they cross over? This wasn't merely a matter of location—it determined their opening base.

A good start was half the battle. The transmigrators all loved strategy games and understood that securing a favorable starting position was key. For them, such a base needed to satisfy:

1. A solid agricultural foundation to guarantee food supply.
2. A sufficient population base for post-crossing industrialization.
3. Rich natural resources for industry.
4. A coastal location with ports—maritime trade being the era's easiest path to wealth.
5. Not in the core of Ming rule, to avoid concentrated suppression.
6. Not in contested territory. The Later Jin, the Chuang and Xian rebel forces—none were threats they could handle while still gaining a foothold.
7. Defensible, with natural barriers of mountains, rivers, and seas.

Clearly, places meeting all these conditions were scarce.

The question was posted on the forum for collective brainstorming. Proposals clustered around three locations: Taiwan, Hainan, and Australia.

Australia garnered tremendous support but was shot down first. Setting aside whether Australia itself was suitable, there was simply no way to transport several hundred transmigrators there.

Taiwan was hotly debated. Geographically and in terms of development potential, it seemed excellent. No Ming government apparatus on the island; though the Dutch and Spanish had built forts, each held only a corner—effectively a vacuum. However, Taiwan suffered severe tropical diseases, especially malaria, which hindered migration. In the late Ming, development was minimal and population sparse—no foundation for large-scale development.

Hainan was far superior. Development began in the Six Dynasties era; by the late Ming it had become a southern frontier prefecture with hundreds of thousands of registered households. In the tenth year of Yongle alone, the Han population numbered ninety thousand households and four hundred thousand people—ample human resources. In agriculture, by the forty-third year of Wanli, official and private fields totaled 4.1 million *mu*.

Even more valuable: its natural resources were abundant and comprehensive—ideal for industrialization. Eighty-eight mineral types, sixty-seven of proven industrial value. Gold, rich iron ore, titaniferous iron ore, and zircon were advantageous minerals.

The keys to pre-industrial development were coal and iron. Hainan possessed one of China's rare large-scale rich iron deposits—the Shilu Iron Mine, with ore averaging 51% iron content and reserves of 400 million tons. Most valuably, Shilu was virtually open-pit—strip the topsoil and mine without expensive tunnel systems.

As for coal, Hainan had only low-quality lignite. But across the Beibu Gulf lay Vietnam's Quang Ninh Hong Gai coalfield—open-pit reserves alone totaling 200 million tons, with tens of billions of tons of high-quality anthracite underground. The coalfield sat right at the shore—extremely convenient for maritime transport.

Coal and iron meant mass-produced steel. Steel meant mechanized industry and bulk manufacturing.

An ancient society might produce breathtaking art, but it could not compete with the tidal wave of mass-produced industrial goods.

Hainan's drawback was proximity to the mainland. Ming rule there was relatively tight—except for the inland Li aboriginal region, most of the island was "civilized territory" under imperial administration.

Such a long-registered prefecture was something the Ming government would not easily relinquish. They would spare no effort to subdue these ambitious outsiders—whether claiming to be from New Borneo, Australia, or another timespace.

From the start, the transmigrators would face punitive expeditions from local forces and Guangdong garrisons. They would have to repel these to gain a foothold.

Hainan also had long-standing Li-Han tensions. Since the Yuan dynasty, a Li uprising had occurred somewhere on the island roughly every three years. Less than thirty years before their 1627 crossing point—in the twenty-seventh year of Wanli (1599)—the Li leader Ma Shi of Ding'an had risen up, with Li people in Dan, Ya, and Lin responding. The Ming mobilized a hundred thousand troops to suppress it. Peaceful coexistence with the Li people was another problem.

Finally, pirate raids on Hainan had been rampant; many county towns lacked north-facing gates. In the late Ming, the South China Sea was an era when Chinese and foreign maritime traders and pirates displayed their abilities freely. Whether traders or pirates, when plunder beckoned, none would pass it up. Hainan, on major sea routes, had long suffered. The transmigrators, carrying countless modern tools and goods, would be a fat sheep every party coveted.

Viewed this way, although Hainan's foundation was better than Taiwan's, the pressures were also greater.

"Looking at it this way, let's choose Taiwan," someone proposed during the online meeting. "Taiwan has malaria, but we can bring quinine. We can also bring cinchona trees to plant there. As for population—there were so many refugees in the late Ming; using food and land as bait, transporting a few hundred thousand people shouldn't be a problem."

"Transport a few hundred thousand—you make it sound easy. With what?" someone challenged.

"Ships. We could cross over with a ten-thousand-ton freighter, loaded with supplies and people. Complete maritime hegemon—no need for cannons; whoever displeases us, we just ram them."

"Are you planning to fuel it with alcohol or charcoal?"

"We can build our own ships. Taiwan has plenty of quality timber."

"Fine, then tell me where you'll get sailors."

"We can train sailors ourselves; recruit foreign sailors from Macau as instructors."

"Ridiculous—were Zheng Chenggong's ships all crewed by foreigners? I can't stand you foreign-worshipping types."

"Can cinchona trees even grow in Taiwan?"

"By that logic, the Leizhou Peninsula can't grow rubber either—but they tried anyway."

"I'm talking about Taiwan—is the Leizhou Peninsula on the same latitude?!"

...

When the topic drifted to whether treasure ships were wooden ten-thousand-tonners, whether *qinghao* could prevent malaria, and thence to whether traditional Chinese medicine was pseudoscience, Wen Desi curbed the enthusiasm. Xiao Zishan asked to speak.

"I think Hainan is still more suitable." He had remained silent—he supported Hainan but hadn't rushed to declare it. He waited for the debate to clarify pros and cons, mentally prioritized the issues, and knew where to focus his remarks.

"Why is Hainan more suitable? Compare them against our criteria, and on several key issues, Taiwan falls short.

"First, agriculture. Taiwan's true agricultural development began when Zheng Chenggong recovered it—around the mid-to-late seventeenth century. Our target year is 1628. At that time, Taiwan had virtually no agriculture—just small amounts cleared by migrant villages. Hainan has at least 3.8 million *mu* of cultivated land and dozens of water-conservancy projects. Note that this acreage is only what's registered; land concealment in the Ming was considerable.

"On population: in 1628, Taiwan had very few Han migrants. The large-scale industrial and agricultural construction we plan requires substantial labor. Taiwan's population cannot meet that need, so from the start we'd have to import migrants. Recruiting refugees, organizing them to bring families thousands of *li* across prefectures and counties to reach the Fujian-Zhejiang coast before arranging sea transport—this is a complex, arduous task involving manpower, resources, and dealing with Ming officials at every level... Who among us has such experience?

"Even if we got enough refugees onto the island, the follow-up work would be difficult. These refugees are destitute—they need epidemic prevention, relief, resettlement, housing, seeds, farm tools... Where do all these come from? With our early-stage capabilities, handling this would be beyond us. Hainan has at least a four-hundred-thousand population base—sufficient for early-stage development."

The earlier debate had exhausted most enthusiasm, and some irrational remarks had generated distaste. Xiao Zishan's well-reasoned statement won over the majority. Hainan was confirmed through a vote.

In the late-Ming timespace, Hainan comprised Qiongzhou Prefecture, governing three subprefectures and ten counties: Qiongshan, Chengmai, Lingao, Ding'an, Wenchang, Lehui, Huitong, Changhua, Lingshui, and Gan'en; the subprefectures of Dan, Wan, and Ya.

Glancing at the *Historical Atlas of China*, one would see that Hainan's subprefectures and counties traced a complete circuit around the island's coast. Historically, Hainan had been Li in the south and Han in the north; from the Song dynasty on, it became Han on the outside, Li inside.

Among these jurisdictions, Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Lingao had the longest development histories—the island's primary Han settlement and agricultural zones, with half the Han population concentrated here.

Of the three, Qiongshan—seat of the prefectural government—had the best foundational conditions: nearly a quarter of the island's 3.83 million registered *mu*, with close to ninety thousand people registered for taxation.

But this was also the Ming's political and economic center, ordinarily garrisoned by substantial troops. It held symbolic significance; the fall of a frontier prefectural capital would trigger massive shock in the Ming court, not to mention military expeditions.

Chengmai was good, but bordered Qiongshan—too close to the administrative center.

Lingao became the best choice.

In the present timespace, Lingao was an obscure little county—far less famous than Haikou or Sanya. Economically backward, virtually no tourism. Unless one was an avid backpacker, most people didn't know Hainan had such a place. Searching online for "Lingao," most entries contained a single phrase from the PLA's Hainan Liberation Campaign sixty years earlier: *The PLA first landed at Lingao Point.* That's right—Lingao Point was in Lingao County, less than twelve kilometers from the county seat.

Though obscure, Lingao had a thousand years of history, traceable to the fifth year of Wude in the Tang dynasty. It was one of the earliest Han-settled areas, with long development. Though not as populous as Qiongshan, in the forty-fifth year of Wanli it still had twenty-five thousand registered people. The alluvial plains along the Wenlan River had been developed early, forming a certain agricultural foundation. With water-conservancy development, its potential was considerable. In the present dimension, Lingao was Hainan's land of fish and rice.

Finally, it was separated from Qiongzhou Prefecture by Chengmai—any disturbance wouldn't immediately bring direct pressure. Given ancient communication speeds and administrative efficiency, matters crossing subprefectures typically couldn't be resolved in less than a month—in Hainan, probably longer.

After this topic, others raised various questions, but Lingao as the initial base was no longer disputed. In Wen Desi's concluding remarks, everyone agreed this had been "a successful conference, a unifying conference, a victorious conference." In future New World history textbooks, it was called the "First Traversal Congress." Because there were so many delegates—and quite a few ultimately chose to remain in the Old World—the complete list of names could only be viewed at the "Old World Cathedral"—and theoretically, viewing was prohibited.
