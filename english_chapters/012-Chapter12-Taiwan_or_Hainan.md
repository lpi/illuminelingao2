# Chapter 12 - Taiwan or Hainan

Chapter 12 Taiwan or Hainan

In a private room of a tea house in Guangzhou city, the three were discussing the issue of the base.

"Where is the base chosen?" Xiao Zishan asked.

"This is a big problem." Wen Desi spread out a map of the Ming Dynasty - actually a modern map printed in traditional Chinese characters, "We have several choices."

"The first one, Taiwan." Wen Desi pointed to the big island on the map, "Taiwan is currently a land without an owner (referring to the Ming government's effective rule). The Dutch are in the south, and the Spanish are in the north, but their power is very weak. The vast central and eastern regions are still the territory of aboriginals. If we land there, we can avoid the direct sight of the Ming government and have enough development space."

"But Taiwan's natural conditions are not very good." Wang Luobin interjected, "Typhoons, earthquakes, malaria... and those headhunting aboriginals. Development is very difficult."

"And the Dutch and Spanish are not vegetarians." Xiao Zishan added, "Once they find our existence, they will definitely come to suppress us. With our current strength, we are probably not their opponents."

"That's right." Wen Desi nodded, "So Taiwan can only be a backup option. What about the second one? Luzon."

"Luzon?" Xiao Zishan shook his head, "That's the Spaniard's territory. And it's too far from the mainland, inconvenient for introducing immigrants."

"What about the third one? Jeju Island."

"Jeju Island is too small, and it is under the control of Joseon. Besides, the climate there is too cold, not suitable for agricultural development."

"Then there is only the last choice left." Wen Desi's finger moved to the south of the map and landed on a large island, "Hainan Island."

"Hainan Island?" Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin's eyes lit up.

"Yes, Hainan Island." Wen Desi analyzed, "First of all, it is close to the mainland, only separated by a strip of water from Leizhou Peninsula. It is very convenient to absorb immigrants and purchase materials. Secondly, although Hainan is nominally under the jurisdiction of the Ming Dynasty, the rule of the government is actually very weak, especially in the interior and the southern Li areas, it is basically a vacuum zone. We can completely establish a base there."

"Moreover," Wen Desi continued, "Hainan has rich resources. There is high-grade iron ore in Shilu, coal mines, salt fields, timber... and a vast plain suitable for growing grain. The climate is warm, crops can be harvested three times a year. It is simply a natural treasure house!"

"The most important thing is," Wen Desi lowered his voice, "Hainan's strategic location is extremely important. To the north, it can control the Qiongzhou Strait and choke the throat of the mainland and Nanyang. To the south, it can march into Southeast Asia and compete for maritime hegemony. It is an unsinkable aircraft carrier!"

"Sounds good." Wang Luobin was moved, "But, where exactly in Hainan should we choose?"

"I've thought about this too." Wen Desi pointed to a point in the northwest of Hainan Island, "Here, Lingao."

"Lingao?"

"Yes. Lingao County is located in the northwest of Hainan, facing the Beibu Gulf. There is a natural good harbor here - Bopu Harbor (now Xinying Harbor). The harbor is deep and wide, sheltered from wind and waves, suitable for berthing large ships. Moreover, the terrain near Lingao is flat, with the Wenlan River passing through it, providing sufficient water sources and arable land."

"More importantly," Wen Desi smiled slyly, "The magistrate of Lingao County is notorious for his incompetence. The local defense is lax, and there are almost no regular troops. We land there, basically facing no resistance."

"Just Lingao then!" Xiao Zishan slammed the table, "When do we start?"

"Don't worry." Wen Desi waved his hand, "Before the official landing, we need to do some preparatory work."

"First, we need to conduct on-the-spot reconnaissance of Lingao. We need to figure out the local terrain, hydrography, population, defense deployment, etc., to provide accurate intelligence support for the landing operation."

"Second, we need to accumulate more materials and funds. Landing is a money-burning operation. Without sufficient logistic support, we can't sustain it for a few days."

"Third, we need to recruit and train a pioneer team. This team must have combat effectiveness and construction capabilities, able to gain a foothold in the shortest time after landing and build a defensive position."

"I plan to lead the team to Lingao for reconnaissance personally." Wen Desi said, "Zishan, you stay in Guangzhou, responsible for liaison and material transfer. Luobin, you go back to modern times, responsible for recruiting people and purchasing equipment."

"No problem." The two agreed.

A few days later, Wen Desi, disguised as a merchant, boarded a sea ship bound for Hainan. Accompanying him were two hired local guides and several strong transmigrators acting as guards.

The sea voyage was not smooth. The sea conditions in the Ming Dynasty were complex, and pirates were rampant. Fortunately, the ship they took was relatively large and hung the flag of a powerful maritime merchant, so ordinary pirates dared not provoke it.

After three days and two nights of bumping, the ship finally arrived at Bopu Harbor in Lingao.

Standing on the bow, looking at the desolate coast in front of him, Wen Desi's heart was surging.

This is the place where dreams set sail!

He observed the terrain of the harbor carefully. Bopu Harbor was indeed a good harbor as recorded in the data. The harbor entrance was narrow and the inside was wide, shaped like a gourd. Inside the harbor, the waves were calm, and the water depth was enough for 10,000-ton giant ships to enter and exit. On the east side of the harbor was a slender peninsula - Lingao Cape, like a natural breakwater blocking the wind and waves from the sea. On the west side was a vast tidal flat, suitable for reclaiming land from the sea and building salt fields.

"Good place, really a good place!" Wen Desi praised repeatedly.

After landing, they found an inn in the nearby Bopu market to stay. Bopu market was not big, just a small market formed by a few streets. The residents were mostly fishermen and small merchants, living a poor and peaceful life.

In the next few days, Wen Desi and his party traveled all over the surrounding areas of Lingao. They measured the terrain, investigated the water sources, visited the villagers, and collected a large amount of first-hand data.

They found that although Lingao's natural conditions were superior, the level of development was extremely low. Most of the land was barren, and the water conservancy facilities were in disrepair. The farmers' farming methods were backward and the yield was low. Moreover, the place was deeply affected by bandits and pirates, and the people were struggling to live.

"This gives us an opportunity." Wen Desi recorded in his notebook, "The people here are eager for change and eager for a stable life. As long as we can bring them food and safety, they will support us."

During the reconnaissance, they also discovered an important target - the Bailaren (Hundred Fathoms) Beach on the Wenlan River.

Bailaren Beach was a section of rapids in the lower reaches of the Wenlan River, with a large drop and rapid water flow.

"This is an ideal site for a hydropower station!" Wen Desi said excitedly pointing to the rapids, "As long as a dam is built here and generator sets are installed, it can provide steady electricity for our base!"

"Moreover," he pointed to the high ground beside the river bank, "We can build a fortress here - Bailaren City. It guards the main channel of the Wenlan River and overlooks the entire Lingao Plain. It is a battleground for military strategists!"

With a full harvest and longing for the future, Wen Desi ended this reconnaissance trip.

When he returned to Guangzhou and told Xiao Zishan and others about the reconnaissance results, everyone was encouraged.

"The target is locked - Lingao!"
