# Chapter 828: Trade

Van der Lanthroon completed the handover procedures with the former Merchant of the *Magdeburg*. This ship had only arrived from the Netherlands a few months ago and was in quite good condition after refitting. Because this voyage was to a port of an unknown power, carrying certain risks, the personnel on board were reinforced. The ship was manned by one hundred and twenty sailors and forty soldiers. Originally equipped with only four cannons, four more were installed. Although the route to Hainan Island could only be considered a short voyage, the ship was still equipped with two military surgeons to look after the crew—though how useful they would be was hard to say; there was no voyage where a dozen or even dozens of bodies were not thrown into the sea. Of course, a priest was also indispensable on the ship to look after the sailors' souls.

Van der Lanthroon held a brief meeting with the Captain, Gonzalez, and Leibtrini. The task given by the Governor to Van der Lanthroon was to open trade with the Australians and simultaneously gather as much intelligence on them as possible. To achieve this goal, the first step was to choose suitable trade goods: if the Australians were not interested in the goods they brought, then neither trade relations nor intelligence gathering could be accomplished.

Van der Lanthroon felt this was very tricky. No one here had ever traded with the Australians, and no one knew what they liked or needed. Since the Australians were on the coast of China, they could certainly get ample supplies of Chinese goods: silk, raw silk, porcelain. And judging from their large exports of sugar, paper, and glass products, they had strong manufacturing capabilities themselves. Van der Lanthroon thought about it and decided that the only products in the entire East Indies they might be interested in were spices. Pepper, cinnamon, and cloves were among the few goods Chinese people were willing to import in large quantities from the Dutch.

If he couldn't find suitable bulk export goods, Van der Lanthroon would have to transport a large amount of silver to trade with the Australians, which was the trade situation the Company least wanted to see.

The Governor's secretary gave him a pamphlet about the basic situation of the Australians. Van der Lanthroon carefully studied the Australians' imports. The things they imported were diverse, but the largest bulk commodities were rice, timber, pig iron, various metals, and cotton products. Especially cotton products; the import figures were very large. Van der Lanthroon was shocked because, according to the pamphlet, just from one trader, they bought more cotton cloth and yarn from India than the total sales of various textiles to China since the East India Company began trading with China. In fact, the East India Company not only failed to sell many cotton products to the Chinese but instead imported a large amount of "Nanking cloth" from Chinese merchants every year for distribution.

Obviously, they have a great demand for textiles, Van der Lanthroon thought. However, he was afraid he couldn't help with cotton products; these were mostly distributed by the English. Batavia had no stock of cotton products unless a ship was sent to procure them from India—which was obviously too late time-wise.

As for pig iron and metals, they were even scarcer. Whether ironware, lead, or copper, they were either shipped from Europe or imported from China and Japan so far. They were already in quite short supply and could not be exported.

However, Batavia had a large amount of Dutch linen—this was a major bulk industrial export of the Netherlands. Because of its low price, it was actually dumped on the European market. At that time, someone described its price as so low that "even the poorest people could use it to make shirts." In addition, he planned to bring some high-quality woolens. Although woolens did not sell well in China, there were always people buying them as luxury goods.

After repeated consideration and studying the pamphlet over and over, Van der Lanthroon finally arranged a cargo list for the *Magdeburg*. The goods prepared for sale in Lingao included: a large amount of spices, Dutch linen, raw timber, and a small amount of high-quality woolens. Seeing from the pamphlet that the clothes worn by Australians were mostly blue and gray, he judged that the Australians lacked dyes other than indigo. So he added dyes like sappanwood to the cargo list. Finally, he loaded several hundred bags of local rice. Even Europeans in the East Indies had to rely on rice as a staple food.

Since no one among the Dutch had been to Hainan Island, but they knew the exact coordinates of Lingao, and the Dutch often went to Vietnam for trade, they were not completely ignorant of the local situation. Referencing nautical charts and gathered intelligence, Van der Lanthroon roughly knew that Lingao was in the Qiongzhou Strait. He only needed to follow the route to Vietnam, turn west after arriving in Vietnam, and enter the Qiongzhou Strait to find Lingao.

After the *Magdeburg* set sail, it passed through the Palembang Strait, sailed past Sumatra and the Philippine Islands, and after thirty-five days of sailing, arrived at Kimlan Bay. After replenishing food and fresh water locally, the *Magdeburg* turned its course to the northeast, preparing to cross the Gulf of Tonkin to find the entrance to the Qiongzhou Strait.

Because Li Siya provided the approximate coordinates of Lingao, the voyage was very smooth. The *Magdeburg* sailed past Bach Long Vi Island in early February 1631. The sailors on the ship spotted land—according to the charts in their hands, this should be Hainan Island.

The *Magdeburg* sailed carefully along the coast—so far, no European ship had ever entered the Qiongzhou Strait. After sailing along the coast for a few days, they finally discovered the narrow strait entrance. However, at this moment, the sailor looking out from the top of the mast issued a warning: "Ship approaching!"

"Battle stations!" The Captain immediately issued the order.

Hearing the news, Van der Lanthroon rushed out of the poop deck and immediately shouted loudly: "No shooting without orders!"

He was deeply afraid that the incoming ship was an Australian vessel. If an armed conflict occurred, it would have a bad influence on his mission.

Sure enough, from two compass points off the port bow, a single-masted sailing ship gradually appeared on the sea horizon.

Van der Lanthroon leaned his hands on the bow rail, staring at the Bermuda sloop coming at full speed with full sails. This kind of ship was very rare in East Asian waters. It was a typical European-style ship. The ship looked small, but its shape was very beautiful. It reminded him of those sloops he had seen along the Mediterranean coast and in the English Channel.

Flying at the top of the mast was a flag he did not recognize. He cast his gaze to the stern of the ship, where a blue and white flag was flying—exactly as described in the pamphlet; this was the Australian Navy!

"That ship is really strange," Gonzalez said. "A Bermuda sloop! Where did they get it? I've never seen anyone use this kind of ship in East Asia!"

The Merchant glanced at the officer speaking beside him. This was a Xibank—Van der Lanthroon hated all Spaniards. In the past, he had heard plenty about the various terrors and atrocities committed by the Spaniards during the War of Independence.

"Lower the pennant!" Van der Lanthroon ordered. This was a gesture of respect to the other party, indicating no malice. Of course, it was hard to say if the other party understood the meaning. However, Van der Lanthroon believed that since the Australians used a typical European-style ship, they probably understood nautical signals.

Sure enough, the other party responded with the same courtesy. And the sailing ship was gradually closing in.

Leibtrini also came out, holding his sketchbook. Swiftly sketching the sailing ship with a charcoal stick, he asked: "What do you think they want to do? They are waiting on our route. Do they want to contact us?" It was Leibtrini's first time in East Asia, and even more so his first long voyage.

"I don't know. Maybe they want to contact us. Maybe they want to attack us. Have everyone ready for alert immediately," Gonzalez said. "Their ship is small; altogether they have at most fifty men. Besides, our freeboard is much higher. Even in a boarding battle, we have the advantage. Have someone load all the swivel guns."

Van der Lanthroon ordered: "Do not lower sails, continue sailing." Boarding with a strange ship at sea was dangerous. It was not uncommon for large ships to be boarded and attacked by small ships, eventually being captured in hand-to-hand combat.

"...Ship inspection..." someone opposite was shouting.

"Oh, it sounds like Spanish? What are they saying?"

"Stop for inspection!" The shout from the small boat opposite became louder. Although it was Spanish, the accent was very strange.

"Strange, they are speaking Spanish!" Gonzalez frowned. "They want us to stop for inspection."

"We are clearly flying the Prince's Flag."

"Maybe they don't know the Prince." Gonzalez had no love for the Dutch, and naturally no affection for His Highness the Prince either.

"Oh! First time encountering such a thing!" The Spaniard laughed loudly. "How do you think we should handle this? My dear Merchant. Let them board for inspection on this vast sea?"

"Of course not, that's unsafe—besides, they might not necessarily be Australians," Van der Lanthroon said. "Continue sailing."

But the other party's sailing speed was very fast, and the ship was much more agile than theirs. Soon this sloop was sailing neck and neck with them. Now they could see the other party more clearly. This sloop looked very new; it must not have been launched long ago. There were cannons on the deck, already stripped of their covers. Some sailors wearing blue short jackets were running on the deck.

Everyone became tense. Gunners and musketeers lit their matches. Off-duty sailors of the "Prince's Squad" also armed themselves with cutlasses, axes, and daggers, ready to join the battle at any time.

At this moment, a figure appeared on the poop deck of the sloop. He put a cone-shaped cover over his mouth and shouted something loudly in Chinese.
