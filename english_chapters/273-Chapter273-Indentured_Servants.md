# Chapter 273: Indentured Servants

Thanks to the efforts of the Qiwei Escort Bureau personnel, the sugar-boiling masters and other sugar-making workers for the various mills were recruited. Although it was a bit late in the season to be hiring—the best masters had already been snapped up—the remaining ones ranged from old to young, and their skills weren't great. But at least each sugar mill made it in time for the crushing season. Wen Tong notified his five sugar mills that any outside sugarcane brought in for toll processing would only be charged three-tenths of the output as the processing fee. This was to attract small cane farmers without their own mills to come for processing and earn more raw brown sugar. At the same time, he had each mill buy up all kinds of sugar products they could get: raw brown sugar, slab sugar—even the leftover molasses from processing was welcome, all purchased together.

"Tell them we want the bagasse too!" Wen Tong shouted excitedly to Wen Xiu and Wen Qing, who were acting as messengers. The two brothers, being semi-literate and knowing Mandarin, had become Wen Tong's secretaries and couriers. They were constantly running around Leizhou delivering various orders. Their faces had darkened considerably from the sun. Every day, Wen Tong wrote letters to the sugar mill managers and estate managers he had just recruited, issuing all kinds of instructions. At the same time, he required these people to report to him regularly. To make message delivery convenient, Liao Dahua specially purchased several sedan chairs and kept a group of bearers on standby for transport.

As for the day laborers for the cane fields, Wen Tong quickly discovered he couldn't recruit enough people locally. During the sugarcane harvest season, day labor wages skyrocketed, and because they'd started late, the rural idle labor force had already been hired by other cane farmers and estates. Wen Tong had no choice but to wait for laborers to be sent from Guangzhou.

Guangzhou was preparing to send the first batch of two hundred people. Originally, he'd wanted even more. But the dilapidated buildings on the various estates and sugar mills simply couldn't house that many people. The few existing structures mostly needed repairs, and supporting facilities like kitchens and toilets still had to be built. Food and water all needed preparation. They even had to buy cooking pots for these people. Arranging food and lodging for so many people in the 17th century was very difficult—everything had to be done personally.

Fortunately, the Qiwei Escort Bureau's local branch was there to help. Purchasing supplies, hiring craftsmen for repairs, negotiating with the government—all of this was handled by Liao Dahua, which was a great help.

In Guangzhou, Zhang Xin tasked Sun Chang with organizing the first batch of migrants to Xuwen. Knowing from the dispatches that conditions in Leizhou were crude, and that the migrants would not only be harvesting sugarcane but also doing all kinds of odd jobs, Sun Chang selected only able-bodied adults without illnesses for the first batch. Moreover, he specifically chose those with families; single people were rejected outright. Zhang Xin didn't understand and asked why.

"This humble one has heard that conditions in Leizhou are quite harsh. If unattached people go there, at the first sign of trouble, they'll all scatter. Wouldn't all these days of effort and money be wasted? Those with families are more reliable," Sun Chang reported.

"You really think of everything." Zhang Xin admired this former household servant turned steward for being so thorough.

"It's not that this humble one is thorough. When I was at the Gao household before, though I was just a minor servant, I saw a lot of the hiring and recruiting they did. I'm familiar with all the various drawbacks."

Sun Chang also asked Guo Yi to personally visit the Governor-General's *yamen* to call on Advisor Lü Yizhong. For a hundred taels of silver, he bought one of Lü's visiting cards. Although several hundred able-bodied migrants could travel by ship to Leizhou, once they landed, they would inevitably pass through cities and villages. The authorities along the way would all ask questions. Having a visiting card would make things much easier. They then organized the first batch of migrants into a military-style formation—squads, platoons, and companies—with leaders appointed at each level. Everyone brought their own bedding, eating utensils, and five days' worth of emergency rations.

The route was to depart from Guangzhou by ship, disembark at Hai'an in Leizhou, then travel on foot to Xuwen. After reaching Xuwen, they would be dispersed to the nine sugarcane estates according to each person's situation.

The Qiwei Escort Bureau also made thorough preparations at its various branches and affiliated offices along the route within Leizhou. They sent waybills segment by segment, taking responsibility for handoffs. As soon as the migrant column entered the territory, someone was there to meet them and serve as a guide. Rest stations were set up along the way, providing boiled water and steamed buns. In some places that were too remote for rest stations, the cooking team would start fires, boil water, and prepare dry rations on their own. They didn't drink unboiled water along the way. Every night, accommodations were arranged—no sleeping in the open. This system of relay transport meant the migrants ate well, rested well, and didn't get lost. Under escort guard protection, and armed with the government's visiting card, and with the migrants themselves carrying bamboo staves and short swords for self-defense, no one dared to trouble them on this not-so-peaceful land of Leizhou. They arrived in Xuwen in less than two days, and everyone was in good physical condition. Not a single person fell sick or was injured on the road. After a brief rest upon arrival, they could be put to work immediately.

Wen Tong dispersed the two hundred-odd migrants and assigned them by squad to the various sugarcane estates. Though they lived in temporarily patched-up thatched huts, Leizhou's weather was warm enough that they wouldn't freeze. As soon as they arrived, the migrants threw themselves into the rush to harvest the sugarcane. Per Wen Tong's instructions, sufficient rice, vegetables, and meat were purchased from nearby villages to ensure the migrants got adequate food during the busy farming season. Harvesting sugarcane was extremely strenuous. If they weren't fed well, people would soon give up and run away.

After the first batch of migrants had settled in and worked for half a month, seeing that morale was fairly stable, Guangzhou began sending the second batch, which included the wives and children of the first batch. The women were sent mainly to meet the logistical needs of these migrants—helping with cooking, mending clothes, and so on.

In the end, about four hundred people were transported from Guangzhou, men and women, old and young. Wen Tong, Chang Shide, and Liao Dahua gradually dispersed and settled them across the various sugarcane estates to be used as long-term workers—though in truth, their status was that of indentured servants. Each person had signed a contract stating they owed Zishi Enterprise fifty taels of silver and thus had to work to pay off this debt. Guo Yi believed this model could somewhat curb the tendency of some vagrants to run away once they'd eaten their fill.

The refugee recruitment policy had worked quite well initially, especially when turnover to Lingao was relatively fast. Starving refugees were certainly willing to go to a new place where there was work and enough to eat. But as the transfer rate slowed and more and more people accumulated in the Guangzhou refugee camp, once they'd eaten a few good meals and recovered, and heard they were being sent to Qiongzhou, many who were attached to their homeland started thinking about escaping. They'd come to Guangzhou to avoid starving to death; now that they were full, and with spring approaching, people began drifting away. At first, the Guangzhou Station was completely helpless—there weren't enough personnel to watch these people, but the matter couldn't be delayed, or it would quickly become a trend. Guo Yi and the others reached a conclusion: carrots alone weren't enough—there had to be sticks.

To reduce the escape of the refugees they'd sheltered as much as possible, besides increasing various brainwashing measures and promoting the wonderful life that awaited in Qiongzhou, Guo Yi finally requested Executive Committee approval to implement an indentured servant system.

All sheltered refugees were required to sign contracts, taking on debt to pay for their food, clothing, lodging, and medical care in the refugee camp. For this, they had to serve Zishi Enterprise for at least seven years. Only after the term expired could they reclaim their indenture contracts.

According to the contract, during this period their meals were provided free, and they were also paid wages. After the term ended, no additional redemption fee was required.

With this contract, Guo Yi could legally use the government's power in Guangzhou to control them. The commoners' special fear of authorities would keep them from running away easily. Especially after he used Counselor Liang Cunhou's visiting card to report a case at the Nanhai County *yamen* and had a dozen escaped refugees arrested—each receiving forty to eighty strokes of the cane in the *yamen*—the escape phenomenon was brought under control. It completely crushed any thoughts of looking for opportunities to return home. Others gradually began to question whether going back to their hometowns to live on chaff and wild vegetables, farming and paying rent, had any meaning at all—if they had to farm and work anyway, wasn't it better to work for a master like Manager Guo? At least they got enough to eat and new clothes to wear.

After about a month of turmoil, the Transmigration Enterprise's sugar production business in Haikang and Xuwen counties finally got on a normal operating track. Although there were some vexing incidents along the way—like sugar being spoiled due to some sugar-boiling masters' poor skills—overall operations were quite stable. Raw brown sugar was being produced in a steady stream. Per Wen Tong's instructions, all raw brown sugar, molasses, and bagasse produced in the sugar mills was transported to the central sugarcane estate in Xuwen. Following his directions, Liao Dahua managed to buy some land to extend the estate's boundaries to the riverbank—if they couldn't get a steam engine or diesel engine for power, they would use a water-powered machine for crushing.

Wen Tong planned to build a demonstration sugarcane plantation here, complete with a sugar factory using new equipment. He named it the South China Demonstration Sugar Factory—in memory of the earliest modern sugar factory in Xuwen, the Huanan Sugar Factory. He also named the four other sugar mills after the shareholders who had made significant contributions to the modernization of China's sugar industry: Guoxin Factory, Qichong Factory, Zhi'an Factory, and Qiwen Factory. For now, these factories could only maintain their old production methods; technical improvements would come after the demonstration factory was running smoothly.

Thus, the South China Demonstration Sugarcane Estate became the place receiving the most migrants—nearly one hundred fifty men, women, and children had settled here. Since Chang Shide didn't understand sugarcane, he became the administrator of civil affairs. Going estate by estate, following Wu De's *Handbook for Civil Affairs Administration and Organization*, he registered households, established grassroots organizations, and selected respected elders from among the migrants to be village heads, with clever and articulate people as their deputies. Following the principle of universal military service, he established a militia—called "township braves" in local parlance—equipped with swords, spears, bows and arrows shipped from Lingao, and even matchlocks. Under the guidance of the escort guards, the militia drilled in their spare time. Wen Tong didn't expect them to be a musket brigade—he only wanted them to be able to defend themselves if bandits attacked. Though both Chang Shide and Wen Tong had deep doubts about the loyalty of these militia members, the local security situation left them no room for further consideration. Relying on a few escort guards to protect nine properties across two counties was simply far beyond the Qiwei Escort Bureau's capacity in Leizhou.

"Even if not for us, hopefully they'll do it for themselves," Chang Shide said. "At least now they have food and clothing, and their families are together. They should put in effort to protect their own homes."

"That requires them to see this as their home." Wen Tong was more pessimistic.

"The two shopkeepers worry too much," Liao Dahua offered reassurance. "There's food and shelter here, the weather is warm, and it's a good place with no frost to freeze them. And they've encountered good-hearted Australian masters like you. What more could these refugees hope for?"

"Hopefully so." Wen Tong looked at the grass huts going up one by one, staggered like an African village. "After this crushing season is over, we'll build new houses for all the estates. Standard Type B residences."

"That's a huge investment—" In Bopu, Chang Shide had seen the Type B buildings constructed for Baitu Village. They were practically fortress buildings, much larger in scale than the barracks-style Type A buildings.

"The sugar factory will be our cash cow in the future. To establish a solid foothold in Leizhou, we need some capacity for self-defense," Wen Tong said. Next, he would set about improving the processes and machinery—that was how he'd make the South China Sugar Factory live up to its name.

Wen Tong now had two directions for improvement. One was manufacturing white sugar. He knew several processes for making white sugar, but without equipment, he could only use the traditional method from *Tiangong Kaiwu*, using yellow clay as an adsorbent to make white sugar. The so-called yellow clay should be porous material like clay. From this perspective, it didn't necessarily have to be yellow clay—activated carbon, diatomaceous earth, and the like could all serve as adsorbents.

The second was increasing raw sugar output. There were many possible improvements here. The simplest method was to raise the juice extraction rate. Wen Tong had roughly tested that the extraction rate using the rustic sugar mill's wooden rollers, even after three pressings, didn't exceed 40%. The so-called bagasse still contained a large amount of juice—a huge waste. Modern sugar factories had extraction rates of at least 70%.

After much deliberation, he decided to start with making white sugar—after all, the profit margins were higher.

Wen Tong didn't attempt to try various random adsorbents. They couldn't yet produce activated carbon, and diatomaceous earth would have to be shipped from Lingao—neither was convenient. Clay and similar materials, while not everywhere, were easy enough to find locally. If it didn't work, he'd find another way.

Following the process description in *Tiangong Kaiwu*, Wen Tong first had the raw brown sugar melted, then poured into the *wa liu* molds with rice straw plugging the bottom. Once the brown sugar had completely solidified, he had the straw pulled out. Chang Shide had people bring in several loads of pure yellow clay from outside, dumped it into a water vat, and stirred vigorously until it became a muddy slurry. After letting it settle briefly, he used a ladle to scoop up the solution from the top layer and drizzled it, ladle by ladle, into the *wa liu*.

"This method is bizarre." Chang Shide was skeptical. Pouring muddy water over brown sugar would produce white sugar? It looked dirty enough.
