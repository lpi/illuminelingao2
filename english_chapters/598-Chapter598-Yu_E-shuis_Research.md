# Chapter 598 - Yu E-shui's Research

Jiang Shan was full of interest: "I think if we can occupy this Prefect position, we can try to transfer him to other posts in advance. Spend money to lobby and transfer him to the central departments in Nanjing or Beijing. Isn't it said that many in the Donglin Party are also very energetic in selling official posts, and things can be done with money?"

"Still the same sentence, who goes?" Chen Tianxiong shook his head, "Reasonably speaking, planting such a person is beneficial without harm, but we simply can't pick out such a person among the Elders."

"Is the danger very high?"

"The danger is based on the fact that no Elder has the ability to play a qualified Great Ming official. The cover will be blown immediately upon appearance. Leaving aside the most obvious accent and appearance issues, no Elder possesses the basic qualities of a Great Ming intellectual." Lin Baiguang shook his head with some regret, "This is not something that can be learned by a few months of cramming. This opportunity is actually quite good..."

"If it were the Great Qing, it would be fine. Donation agents run everywhere; any rotten person can be an official." Wang Ding said.

Lin Baiguang said, "I propose selecting a trustworthy indigenous person to impersonate the Prefect of Leizhou. This is the only possibility for the Tang Monk Plan to succeed."

"Are indigenous people trustworthy? Will they get confused by being an official and sell us out to seek a real official hat? I'm not afraid of anything else, just afraid the Elder remote-controlling behind him will suffer. Being far away, we won't even have time to rescue."

"Then his own crime would be big enough too." Lin Baiguang said, "I think we can still control him. As long as everyone uses their brains, there are still ways to think of. Yu E-shui was very interested in this matter back then. I suggest you might as well find him to talk."

"This matter is very difficult," Yu E-shui repeated his old tune, "The most ideal state is for us to find an Elder to be the Prefect, but I studied it. Even if we cultivate him from now, assuming this person is smart and studies hard, it can't be done without two or three years of effort."

He was responsible for historical data retrieval and compilation in the Grand Library, having little to do. In his spare time, he spent a lot of energy researching the feasibility of the Tang Monk Plan—rather than saying Yu E-shui really wanted to promote this plan, it was better to say it was purely a leisure-type research work, similar to past alternate history topics like "How a Modern Person Can Be an Official in Great Ming." The more he researched, the more interested he became, feeling like writing a thesis or doing a project in the past. Moreover, he had the biggest advantage, which was living in Great Ming. Although the imperial examination was not flourishing in Lingao, it had produced a *Jinshi*, several *Juren*, plus a batch of *Xiucai*. The imperial examination existed alive beside him; he didn't need to constantly guess what the books said or verify authenticity.

Besides flipping through historical materials, he also visited a batch of imperial examination figures in Lingao County, asking them for various knowledge about the imperial examination. Including several *Xiucai* and *Juren* in the county, Instructor Wang in the County School, and even Liu Dalin received him once—Liu Dalin didn't know his abacus, thinking this Australian young man was "hearted towards enlightenment" and intended to participate in the imperial examination, instantly praising him greatly. Not only did he talk big about his own imperial examination experiences, but he also explained many techniques for writing Eight-legged Essays and trial poems, and recommended several contemporary masters of "White Posts" (mock exam papers) for him to copy.

"During the Palace Exam, the characters on the scroll should be big, shiny, and round. A good hand of calligraphy beats a good article." Liu Dalin taught him earnestly, "The Palace Exam is said to be personally tested by the Emperor, but actually, it relies on the scrolls recommended by the Chief Examiner. The Emperor only marks the ranking with his brush. The Palace Exam decides ranking in an instant; who reads your article? The Chief Examiner recommends scrolls primarily by looking at calligraphy."

Finally, Liu Dalin took out a few collections of examination essays just bought from Guangzhou, talking about the changes in literary style in the recent imperial examinations and his views on the court's tendency in selecting scholars through essays.

Although this knowledge was useless for Yu E-shui's research, it made him admire extremely—sure enough, guessing and betting on topics existed since ancient times.

But this way, Yu E-shui basically despaired of the idea that a modern person could be an official of Great Ming.

"...Our impostor Prefect doesn't need to pass the imperial examination—this is slightly better, but at least he needs to understand the ways of the imperial examination. For example, the writing and judgment of Eight-legged Essays. If he doesn't understand this, he will expose himself when handling educational affairs in the prefecture; secondly, be able to write poetry." Yu E-shui said, "I don't know who among our five hundred plus people can write real ancient poetry, but as a person who came up through the imperial examination, it's normal not to have high poetry levels, but strange not to know at all—imperial examinations require writing trial poems besides Eight-legged Essays. If you can't write poetry and don't understand rhyme schemes, others will put a few question marks on how your scholarly honor came about!"

Everyone's heart sank straight down. What Eight-legged Essays, trial poems, these things were like heavenly scripts without needing to say.

"...Then I have to talk about the calligraphy issue." A strange smile floated on Yu E-shui's face, a look of an intellectual triumphant in posing a difficult problem, "Modern people have mostly formed the habit of using computers for word processing. Now writing with fountain pens and pencils is already crooked and twisted. Writing with a brush is probably inferior even to a young apprentice in a shop. Have to practice calligraphy—besides, anyone who has passed the imperial examination can write 'White Posts', this has to be practiced separately."

"Saying this, isn't there no hope at all?!" Wang Ding said.

Chen Tianxiong nodded with an expression of "it was originally so": "If not for these problems, how could it have stopped back then?"

"There are still many problems! There is also an accent. We generally are used to speaking Putonghua—this Putonghua is based on modern Beijing dialect, and modern Beijing dialect developed on the basis of Qing Dynasty Beijing dialect. How did Qing Dynasty Beijing dialect come about?" Yu E-shui gave a mysterious smile, "Mainly a mixture of Ming Dynasty Beijing indigenous people plus the Eight Banners and large numbers of Liaodong Han troops they brought into the Pass. The accent mixed from these three."

"You mean to say, our accent has common points with the Tartars?" Jiang Shan turned pale with fright.

"Strictly speaking, it is similar to the Liaodong Han troops," Yu E-shui said, "Of course, these two languages are not the same thing, the similarity may not be very high, but there are indeed similarities inside."

"I feel the accent problem can be changed, not too difficult." Lin Baiguang said, "I can speak Great Ming Mandarin now—similar to modern Nanjing dialect. If one has the heart to learn, it's not hard; three or four months are enough. Besides, the accent problem is not too big a loophole; neither Guangzhou nor Leizhou had leaks."

"The accent problem is relatively the easiest to solve. An official learning Mandarin can generally muddle through." Yu E-shui said, "But the first two points are difficult. Especially the first point."

"There are still two years. Crash training should be possible, right?"

"According to Liu Dalin and the local *Xiucai*, it takes about ten years for a person to reach the level of passing the *Xiucai* exam from starting education. Of course, passing depends on luck. The difficulty of passing the *Xiucai* exam is much harder than taking a Master's degree entrance exam." Yu E-shui said, "Although the impostor Prefect doesn't need to directly take the imperial examination, he needs to be familiar with the *Thirteen Classics* and reach a level of slight understanding of Eight-legged Essays and poetry. I'm afraid it will take three or four years of effort—premise is this person must be diligent enough and have interest in learning."

"To sum up, it is impossible for an Elder to be this impostor Prefect." Jiang Shan said, "Is that what you want to say?"

"I didn't say that. If someone is willing to study hard and is smart enough, maybe two years can do it. At least there are people in Lingao able to teach this knowledge." Yu E-shui said, "The impostor Prefect has an advantage, that is, origin and native place things are all ready-made, no need to make separately. And there are no photos in ancient times; impersonation is easy."

"There are many people smart enough, but I'm afraid there are none willing to study hard." Jiang Shan knew very well, asking this bunch of Elders to study some *Thirteen Classics*, Eight-legged Essays, and practice calligraphy diligently "burning oil at midnight and crowing at dawn" was worse than asking them to go to the countryside to be agricultural technicians. At least there, people would flatter them, and maybe they could hook up with a small landlord's daughter or something.

"Seems if we really want to implement the Tang Monk Plan, only indigenous people can be selected." Lin Baiguang knew that although Yu E-shui's high discourse had suspicions of showing off his research results, the reasoning was completely correct.

Jiang Shan said: "For an indigenous person to have this ability and be loyal, this candidate—" He showed a difficult expression.

"There is one person you can consider looking at." Yu E-shui said, "Zhang Xingjiao. You can transfer this person's file to see."

"Thanks." Jiang Shan said, "Our Foreign Intelligence Bureau intends to dispatch intelligence personnel to the mainland. In fact, many Elders are willing to do field duty, but after hearing you say this, I am a bit hesitant."

"I know," Yu E-shui nodded, "My suggestion is, dispatching Elders is fine, but best not to mix in the identity of officials, unless mixing in desolate remote military prefectures. Otherwise, once socializing with local gentry, it's easy to expose. Gentry generally connect to the province and the court. Even if not reporting, telling it as a joke or anecdote in ordinary family letters might bring trouble."

"So dispatched personnel should still follow the route of Guangzhou and Leizhou, being merchants and the like?"

"Merchants, monks, Taoists are all fine. Landlords can make do. Impersonating intellectuals, thoughts of wanting to copy Chairman Mao's poetry or Nalan Xingde's lyrics to be a literary poet hero should be discarded early—anyone with such thoughts cannot do field duty." Yu E-shui seemed to hate this deeply, "All phenomena of unauthorized infringement of ancient people's intellectual property rights must be severely cracked down! All use of such materials must be approved by the Grand Library! Otherwise, it is plagiarism!"

Everyone didn't know why Yu E-shui hated this so deeply, stunned for a moment.

No one knew that Yu E-shui had a not-so-small embarrassment when asking a certain *Xiucai* for imperial examination knowledge a few days ago. This *Xiucai* was a small family in the countryside, without too many strict etiquette rules, accidentally letting him see his daughter. Yu E-shui was quite moved. Yu E-shui took the opportunity to recite a lyric by Yuan Mei to show his "talent." The other party's performance was not "prostrating in admiration" nor "extremely appreciative," but showed great surprise—it turned out a transmigrator had already plagiarized this lyric of Yuan Zicai to pay court here long ago.

Thinking of this, Yu E-shui gnashed his teeth. Of course, this thought couldn't be told to others. He just kept writing intellectual property memos to remind the Executive Committee to strictly control ancient people's intellectual property rights, not allowing Elders to use them at will. All poetry, articles, and works since the late Ming must apply before use...

Jiang Shan joked: "Fortunately this is late Ming; only Qing Dynasty literati are left to plagiarize. Not many Qing Dynasty poets can be plagiarized..." He then coughed: "I think we have to organize a training class ourselves to train intelligence personnel. Including not only indigenous people but also Elders willing to do field duty."

"I very much agree with this idea." Yu E-shui said, "Especially Elders. Appearance, manners, living habits, and language differ too much from Great Ming indigenous people. Without certain training, rashly doing field duty easily leads to trouble. By then it won't be like Guangzhou and Leizhou stations, which are close at hand; if something happens, Lingao can start rescue activities in two or three days. Once on the mainland, if something happens, one can only rely on oneself. Don't mention the Northern Administrative Division (Jinyiwei) or Eastern Depot; even being locked in a county jail is enough for an Elder to shed a few layers of skin!"

"Researcher Yu, you grasp so much Ming social situation, how about working in the Foreign Intelligence Bureau? You are our Great Ming expert here." Jiang Shan said, thinking most bureau positions here were vacant. If Yu E-shui wanted to come, letting him be the Director of the Great Ming Division was qualified enough. In case he liked something easier, set up an Intelligence Personnel Training Center for him to be the director. As for rank, it could be solved by appointing him concurrently as Deputy Director of the Great Ming Division.

"Being a part-time consultant is no problem; won't do full-time." Yu E-shui refused flatly. He mixed comfortably in the Grand Library; apart from completing assigned tasks, his time was almost completely at his own disposal, just right for doing research work he was interested in. He was too lazy to come to such an entity-work yamen to bury his head in paperwork. "If there are any historical data problems, welcome to call anytime. I will definitely try my best to answer—this is also my job."

Failing to pull in this combat power, Jiang Shan felt slightly disappointed. Yu E-shui probably knew his thoughts and said: "I have a candidate. He really wants to work on the intelligence front. Are you interested?"

"Of course, I lack manpower right now—" Jiang Shan had half a sentence unsaid, especially lacking manpower willing to sit in the office.

"You will definitely be satisfied with this person," Yu E-shui said. "This person is very interested in intelligence work. In our place, he is responsible for literature retrieval and translation work, also helping the Ministry of Agriculture raise bacteria on the side. This person's favorite amateur activity is translating and researching various trap-making and IED materials, and he personally went to the Bopu shooting range to test several times. His planning in doing things is very strong."

"What's his name? I'll go to the Organization Department to transfer him."

"Name is Li Yan, Stem Cell Biology PhD," Yu E-shui said. "This person once wrote a memo on intelligence work. You can look if willing, but this memo should be targeting military intelligence, not quite right for your place."

"Oh, is it Memo K/BW/290322.77?"

"I don't remember the number." Yu E-shui shook his head, "I even wrote a comment disapproving of his idea—his stuff is just cloning the US military system—doing that would bankrupt us now... Maybe in the future."

Next, everyone discussed the next step of planting stations. Planting stations on the mainland for the intelligence system involved the future strategic layout of the Transmigration Group. Currently, no conclusion had been reached on this issue. However, eliminating Liu Xiang and Zheng Zhilong, finding opportunities to occupy important strategic locations along the mainland coast, and opening up mainland coastal communication lines had roughly formed a consensus.

"If we want to finish off Liu Xiang and Zheng Zhilong, we have to find ways to plant stations in Fujian. Only then can we effectively master Zheng Zhilong's movements." Yu E-shui said, "Zheng Zhilong's lair is in Anping. Now he has legal status and spares no effort in managing Anping. Anping has his large amount of property and clan. Another one is Zhongzuosuo. Ideally, establish intelligence stations in the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou area of Fujian to spy on Zheng Zhilong and Li Kuiqi's movements at all times."

As for Guangdong, everyone agreed no need to spend much more effort. Guangzhou and Leizhou stations were managed very well. Plus the industry coverage of Qiwie Escort Agency, no need to invest much manpower and material resources. Just smoothing the relationship between intelligence and trade is fine.

As for Macau, everyone thought a base should be set up here. Not only to collect Portuguese intelligence but also to get a lot of news about Zheng Zhilong—the relationship between the Portuguese and Zheng Zhilong was very close. This base could serve as both a window for foreign trade and for collecting intelligence, killing two birds with one stone.

"We should put the focus on Jiangnan—or call it the Yangtze River Delta region." Jiang Shan said, "Here will inevitably be the Group's second key target after occupying the Pearl River Delta."

Jiangnan's rich products, vast market, abundant labor force, and embryonic capitalist handicraft workshops were a more superior base than the Pearl River Delta of this spacetime. There had always been people in the Senate advocating "Take Jiangnan to Settle Under Heaven." The voice regarding Jiangnan as the main strategic target was constant.

"Regardless of when the Senate or Executive Committee prepares to take Jiangnan, we need to obtain resources and markets from Jiangnan, so planting stations here is absolutely necessary."

"Not only can it take care of commerce, but also collect various intelligence on the side. Killing many birds with one stone." Wang Ding's eyes shone as he spoke, "Whoever can go to Jiangnan to be the station head is simply a huge cushy job." He regretted thinking of his already shattered grand plan.

"I'm afraid all departments want to intervene in this place," Chen Tianxiong said. "Delung Bank also wants to stick a foot in Jiangnan to absorb deposits and engage in the financial industry."

Jiang Shan shook his head: "Delung Bank is best as a separate system, not mixed with intelligence and commerce departments. Made into a separate line."
