# Chapter 1379 - Changed Historical Facts

Cao Guangjiu took the calling card - and immediately trembled with shock, saying repeatedly: "Quick! Open the center gate, say I will personally go out to receive him!"

"The master who came said there's no need for such formalities. This lowly one dared to receive him into the flower hall..."

"Good, good," Cao Guangjiu waved his hand urgently, "You go ahead first. Tell him I dare not accept the card, and I'm coming out to see him right away." He then stomped his foot and scolded the maidservant: "Are you all dead? Get my clothes!"

An hour later, he saw off this visiting secretary - the name on the calling card was too great, and the person would never come to see him in person. But even just a secretary bringing the calling card was enough to give him face. Cao Guangjiu shut himself in his study for a long time. He couldn't quite fathom the other party's intentions.

He naturally knew the other party was using him as a pawn because they weren't convenient to act themselves. As long as there were sufficient benefits for himself, being used as a pawn by others didn't matter. The problem was, he didn't know what the other party actually wanted to do. This needed careful consideration, which was also why he hadn't dared to agree outright.

From the other party's words, he already knew that the owner of the calling card wanted to deal with the newly emerged Master Zhao. This principal certainly had a big enough background, but the Catholic gentry behind Master Zhao were also not to be trifled with. A Broken Boots Party member like himself caught in between might get his head bloodied.

But the benefits behind this truly made one's heart itch unbearably. This Broken Boots Party member couldn't help but swallow this fragrant bait.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel the pouch the other party had someone bring him. It was heavy. Cao Guangjiu gritted his teeth. A man dies for wealth as a bird dies for food. Master Zhao was just an outsider. No matter how much reputation he had, he still couldn't compare to the owner of the calling card who had deep roots. Himself leaning against a big tree was good for enjoying the shade. This opportunity must not be missed.

At this moment, Zhao Yingong was at the mountain villa arranging "leaf sales" work.

The smooth implementation of the spring silkworm plan and the official opening of the filature had given him full confidence. Especially during this cocoon and silk action, the local gentry and silk hong shopkeepers who had profited greatly from it had all expressed their "admiration" for him on various occasions. He had clearly become a "capable person" who was skilled at navigating complex situations. Naturally, there were also quite a few people who were envious, jealous and resentful because of this.

This year's leaf sales work was not on a large scale - he only needed to satisfy the silkworm raising needs of the three "core villages" and more than ten "peripheral villages" he planned to cooperate with, plus the silkworm farm Cihui Hall had set up itself. The sericulture households in these villages also had some of their own mulberry orchard land, able to be partly self-sufficient. Even if they further expanded the silkworm raising scale next year, the increase would be limited.

Therefore, from the beginning, he had not spent too many resources on controlling the mulberry leaf supply. He had no intention of directly controlling the mulberry orchards themselves - taxes in this area were heavy. Secondly, the cost of buying leaves on credit was small and convenient to use. Moreover, if he was going to raise summer and autumn silkworms, the price of leaves on credit would be pitifully low - originally mulberry leaves were only valuable during the spring season. For the remaining time, apart from pruning branches that could be used for weaving baskets, burning as firewood, and mulberries, there was no other benefit. So when his sent people went to various mulberry orchards to request leaves on credit for the summer and autumn seasons, the mulberry orchard owners all thought they were crazy.

The terms Zhao Yingong offered were very generous: at the price of one tael of silver per mu for contracted production - from now until the leaves fell in autumn, all mulberry leaves produced in the orchard would belong to Zhao Yingong. The Zhao family's people could come to pick mulberry leaves at any time. Picking mulberry leaves didn't require the orchard owner to do anything either, all done by Zhao family servants - for the current Zhao Yingong, labor was the least valuable input. Large quantities of free labor, use them or waste them.

For the mulberry orchard owners, although the income of only one tael per mu was very small, it was after all extra income. It was not without benefit to them. Therefore, the work of purchasing summer and autumn "leaves on credit" proceeded very smoothly. Zhao Yingong bought enough mulberry leaves for the summer and autumn seasons without spending much silver.

He originally wanted to buy up even next spring's leaf quota in one go, not only meeting his own needs but also throwing it out at the time to make a killing. However, he found that the capital required was really substantial. He had too many projects running simultaneously right now: the bookshop, printing and publishing, sericulture, raw silk, maritime trade... and there was this huge refugee camp. Each one required large amounts of capital to run. Cash flow mainly relied on money from the Merchants Bureau to maintain. The trick of eight pots and seven lids wasn't unique to the old time and space. His tricks might not escape others' notice.

Right now, it could only be considered a small operation. Although he still had many ideas, Zhao Yingong could only be temporarily satisfied. Bigger steps would have to wait for next year. Currently, he lacked sufficient strength, and the Council of Elders' influence was also not enough. In this society where those on top took all, one had to be very careful. There were still many things he needed to do right now.

"Jiying!"

He called out, and Jiying immediately appeared at the study door, quietly awaiting orders.

"Prepare a boat for me, going to Shanghai!"

For convenience of traveling around Jiangnan, he had long ago specially purchased a Wuxi fast boat. At one command, the boatmen took turns rowing day and night. In just a few days, they could reach major political and commercial centers of Jiangnan like Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing. Shanghai in particular was the most important commercial channel for the Council of Elders in the entire Jiangnan region. The Mountain-Sea Five Routes all had institutions established there. The Japan trade activities Zhao Yingong was about to begin also used Shanghai as the operations center.

The goods to be shipped to Japan were currently being gradually transported to Shanghai for assembly. Besides the raw silk, silk cloth, white sugar, Chinese medicinal materials, porcelain and other traditional export goods to Japan that Hangzhou Station had purchased from suppliers in Jiangnan, Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, there were also large quantities of daily necessities and hardware manufactured in Lingao.

Although 17th-century Japan had greatly developed agriculture and commerce, its handicraft industry was very backward. Traditional Japanese handicrafts, it must be said, were highly skillful, but very lopsided. For niche consumer goods, the level of refinement far exceeded the general standard, but for mass consumer goods, both quality and production capacity were severely insufficient. Historically, Japan had to rely on large-scale imports of Chinese-made daily necessities to ensure supply. Especially the scarcity of hardware far exceeded most people's imagination. Even the most commonly used hardware items like iron nails were often unavailable. The claim that to build the Great Buddha and temples they needed nails so they had to carry out "sword hunts" was not a ridiculous excuse from the perspective of people at that time.

And currently, in the Council of Elders' industrial system, the industrial products that could be mass-exported and dumped, apart from paper, were hardware. Besides mass exports to the Guangdong market, there were also exports to Jiangnan. This export to Japan naturally wouldn't be passed up either.

However, his rush to Shanghai wasn't for the Japan export matters. It was Shen Tingyang who had asked him to come discuss matters - the letter didn't specify the specific matter, only saying "the matter is urgent."

What exactly was so urgent that he had to be immediately called to discuss, and the location was even chosen as Shanghai! Shanghai was the future headquarters of the Merchants Bureau, the starting point for Japan trade and grain sea transport. Coming here to discuss obviously had to do with these two matters.

Zhao Yingong pondered this matter the whole way. He arrived in Shanghai and had just settled into the residence. Without caring about the dust of travel, he instructed someone to immediately go to the Shen family residence to deliver a letter, arranging to meet with Shen Tingyang.

That evening, the two met at Zhao Yingong's Shanghai residence.

Zhao Yingong had originally been very worried that Shen Tingyang was going to cause trouble over the ship-as-shares matter. Unexpectedly, the other party was actually beaming. As soon as they met, he cupped his hands in congratulations.

"Finally there are sensible people in the court!" Shen Tingyang was very excited.

"What?!" Zhao Yingong had originally known this definitely had nothing to do with Japan exports. His heart relaxed by more than half. He knew what the other party cared about most was abolishing canal transport for sea transport. Looking at this, could it be that the Ming court had really changed its nature? And contrary to history, had it advanced the experiment of sea transport for grain? He probed: "Could it be that the court has already agreed to abolish canal transport for sea transport?"

"Hahaha, younger brother jests!" Shen Tingyang laughed. "If the court acted with such decisiveness, how could things have come to today's state!"

Zhao Yingong laughed awkwardly and felt he should keep his mouth shut on this issue - after all, Shen Tingyang was a Jiangnan tycoon. He could say anything without worry. As an outsider like himself, it was better to behave.

Shen Tingyang also seemed to feel his criticism of court affairs was somewhat improper and immediately returned to the original topic:

"Abolishing canal transport for sea transport is such a major matter - how can it be achieved overnight? However, there is one thing right now. If done well, it will be the antecedent for future abolishment of canal transport for sea transport."

He told Zhao Yingong that after the Dengzhou Rebellion was suppressed, the entire system of transporting grain and military pay from Dengzhou to Liaodong had been completely destroyed. The grain, silver, and military equipment originally gathered in Dengzhou were also lost entirely. Requests for grain and pay from Guan-Ning and Dongjiang came flying in like snowflakes.

"...You probably also know the habits of these military gentlemen," Shen Tingyang said, apparently in very good spirits and thus very talkative. "Since the late Wanli era, the whole realm has been in turmoil with military operations everywhere. These military commanders have all become arrogant. Without grain and pay, they won't even move from their positions, let alone exert effort in battle. These years, the court has thrown in millions of cash and grain every year, just barely maintaining the situation."

After the Dengzhou Rebellion, the supply line to Dongjiang and Guan-Ning was suddenly cut off. Land transport took a long time and consumed even more manpower and materials. Therefore, both the Ministry of War and the Cabinet were anxious to find a new supply route.

"...So this time, the court has issued an edict to transport tribute grain directly from Jiangnan to Liaodong by sea!" Shen Tingyang appeared very happy.

"This matter is to be handled by Brother Wumei?"

"Exactly!" When Shen Tingyang spoke of this, he practically wanted to dance with joy. His excitement was beyond words. "I have already had someone submit a memorial, and also presented my 'Book on Sea Transport' and 'Map of Sea Transport.'"

Zhao Yingong vaguely remembered that this matter should have happened after Shen Tingyang became a Secretary in the Grand Secretariat. The current Shen Tingyang was still only a student at the Imperial Academy. It was still several years before he would become a Secretary. Obviously, something had changed.
