# Chapter 2419: Scabby Head

Originally her plan had been set: how to organize, how to mobilize everyone to pool shares, what equipment and consumables to add, how many silkworm seeds to advance on credit, how much mulberry tree area Nansha would increase this year, how to allocate the mulberry leaf resources of existing mulberry groves, how many women to mobilize to work in the factory...

But this young man's words had created a crack in her plan. If there was insufficient grain and the people were strapped, wouldn't this plan be just flowers in a mirror, the moon in water?

Thinking again, she had indeed not inquired about Nansha's economic situation in the several months she'd been here, relying entirely on Chen Xuan's words. At the time, she had also considered that she wasn't coming to Nansha to be an administrative official and more positioned herself in the role of "technical promotion," avoiding too much interference in local administration.

She had heard somewhat about Chen Xuan's reputation. But to speak honestly, her only handle in Nansha right now was Chen Xuan; without Chen Xuan, she couldn't move an inch.

Suddenly Li Yao'er became alert again. She had heard Chen Xuan say that this Chen Lin was originally the son of Fenshenghe's manager, and Chen Lin's father had long controlled the village politics and clan power here. He treated the factory and Nansha as belonging to his family. He probably wasn't too happy about the Chief running a cooperative and held a grudge against Chen Xuan.

Could this young man be deliberately being alarmist? Shaking her determination, ruining Chen Xuan's reputation?

Two different opinions collided and spun back and forth in her mind. For a moment, Li Yao'er didn't know how to judge.

Right now everything was going smoothly for her in Nansha, all thanks to Chen Xuan's capable work. But this Chen Lin was obviously much more useful than Chen Xuan in terms of technical promotion.

Which of these two should she trust?

After pondering for a moment, she thought it was still too early to draw conclusions now. Setting aside for the moment which of this uncle and nephew was right or wrong, at least currently neither of them had harmed the Senate's enterprise, and both were beneficial to her work in Nansha.

Thinking of this, Li Yao'er said: "What you've said I'm not too clear about. It seems the situation in the village is quite difficult."

Chen Lin's heart relaxed slightly and said: "The Chief is here to do great enterprises. It's just that great enterprises also need to be done within one's means."

"It's good that you told me about these situations. In the future, if there are situations like this, you should come and tell me often. That way I can be well-informed." Having said this, Li Yao'er smiled subtly.

Chen Lin heard the meaning in her words—she faintly wanted him to serve as eyes and ears. He responded with a "yes." At this moment his heart completely settled down—it seemed the Chief didn't trust Second Uncle. He could still make something of himself in Nansha!

Li Yao'er then called over the several naturalized citizens in the factory and introduced them to him. She hadn't brought many naturalized citizens to Nansha—including the one squad of guards, only fifteen people in total.

"This is Guard Captain An Zaiduan," Li Yao'er introduced.

The man called An Zaiduan was short and sturdily built, strong and powerful. But when he spoke, his Chinese had a strange tone—he was actually Korean.

Although he was a guard, his left hand wasn't very agile. Li Yao'er said this was from an injury received in battle, leaving some disability.

"...Originally he was to be discharged, but he didn't want to, so he came to be my guard."

An Zaiduan looked Chen Lin up and down with suspicious eyes for a long time, making his whole body crawl.

"This is my student, Shen Su. She specializes in sericulture and silk weaving," Li Yao'er said. "She doesn't know much about the local situation. You two should cooperate and communicate more in the future."

Chen Lin had seen quite a few female False Short-hair cadres in Guangzhou and wasn't surprised by any of this.

After the introductions, Li Yao'er said:

"From now on, you should come to the factory every day. At seven in the morning, a steam whistle will be sounded here, and you come to the factory to work. There are many things waiting for us to do."

After leaving the factory, Chen Xuan had been uneasy in mind, not knowing whether recommending his nephew to the Australian woman was blessing or curse. After Chen Lin returned, although he appeared very obedient, the more he was like this, the less reassured Chen Xuan felt.

He understood clearly in his heart that when it came to running the silk factory, Chen Lin had real ability. If he gained that Li Yao'er's trust and then made trouble behind his back with malicious slander...

Chen Xuan knew his own situation too well—without the Australians backing him, he couldn't stay in Nansha for even one minute. If he lost the Australians' trust, let alone being Nansha Village's Baojia, even whether he could stay alive would be hard to say!

But if he couldn't handle the silk factory, sooner or later he would also lose power—in these days he had completely figured out Li Yao'er's psychology. Nothing was more important to her than her plan for raising silkworms and reeling silk.

It was precisely because of this woman that he had no choice but to recommend his nephew. If any problems arose, that would really be lifting a stone to smash his own foot!

He returned to the Ancestral Hall, restless and anxious. He had a pile of matters at hand, but had no mind to deal with them.

Just as he was at a loss, suddenly a voice came from outside:

"Master Xuan! Master Xuan!"

Such a neither-here-nor-there form of address naturally wasn't from his clansmen. He knew from the voice—Scabby Head had come.

This Scabby Head had only drifted to the village begging for food a few months ago. He spoke a half-baked Mandarin. Although his clothes were ragged, covering the front but not the behind, and he had several bald patches on his head, he was very clever. Chen Xuan was just recruiting troops and buying horses at the time. Seeing he was young with good bones and had no connection whatsoever to the local area, he recruited him into his militia.

This Scabby Head claimed to have been a household servant of a big family in the past. After his master met with disaster, he drifted out. Sure enough, his skills at serving and flattering were first-rate. Chen Xuan was a local ruffian whose wife and daughter had both run off—when had he ever tasted being served like a master? In two or three moves, he came to rely on Scabby Head as a trusted confidant.

"What are you yelling about! Come in and talk!" Chen Xuan was originally in a bad mood. Being called by him, he spoke without good temper.

Scabby Head came into the room and first gave a respectful arch of hands and bow, saying: "Master Xuan."

This Scabby Head was exactly Lai Xiao who had jumped ship before the plague broke out. When Lai Xiao jumped from the transport ship into the Pearl River, it was stormy weather. Although he had some swimming ability, he nearly drowned. He could only hug a piece of driftwood and go with the flow. Only after struggling ashore did he rest on the riverbank for half a day before getting up to flee.

Upon inquiring, he found he had already drifted into Shunde County. Lai Xiao heard that Guangzhou had a plague and had already sealed the city. Only then did he understand why he was being escorted out of the city at the time. He was so scared his soul flew and his spirit scattered. He kept walking south, only wanting to get as far from Guangzhou as possible.

This walking took him to Xiangshan.

Xiangshan was already at the Pearl River estuary. Among the counties under Guangzhou Prefecture in the Ming Dynasty, it counted as relatively remote. Lai Xiao sometimes begged, sometimes helped people with odd jobs, and drifted all the way to Nansha Village. He was taken in by Chen Xuan and settled down under a hidden name.

He naturally didn't dare call himself Lai anymore and changed to his father's surname Chou. The name didn't need changing—after all, names like "Da" (Big), "Xiao" (Small), "Yi" (One), "Er" (Two) were the most common.

After this ordeal, Lai Xiao had long since worn away any thoughts of revenge. Lai Da's death had also gradually faded for him. As for his former masters, the Gou family father and son, he now didn't even want to think about them—when he was a beggar in Guangzhou back then, he had dimly spotted traces of them, but had never thought of going to seek them out. He just wanted to find a place to settle down quietly, live a few days of normal life, instead of being on the run every day, in constant fear.

This remote place of Nansha had no wealthy households or strongmen worth ransacking, and the reach of the Real Short-hairs didn't extend here. So he earnestly took up the role of Nansha Village militia and Chen Xuan's servant here.

However, Heaven seemed to be playing a joke on him. Not long after, Australians actually came to this Nansha Village. Not only did Australians come, but it was also an authentic Real Short-hair woman; not only did a Real Short-hair come, she also wanted to station here!

Lai Xiao almost broke down. Were the Australians not going to let him go?

He had a mind to flee again, but was reluctant to give up his current comfortable life—right now he was Chen Xuan's "trusted confidant" and was somebody in the village. Besides, even if he ran, where could he run to? The Australians had launched military campaigns; reportedly both Guangs had been taken by them. Even if he could get away, how would he make a living in the future?

In the end, he chose to stay in Nansha. Fortunately, the Real Short-hair who came was a woman and probably had never seen him—to speak honestly, very few Senators and naturalized citizens knew Lai Xiao personally. Unless he returned to Lingao, the possibility of being recognized was extremely small.

Sure enough, Li Yao'er had been in Nansha for several months now, and everything had been safe and sound. Lai Xiao's heart had gradually settled down, and naturally his thoughts were no longer on this.

As soon as news of Chen Lin's return spread, Chen Xuan called him to the Ancestral Hall to ask how to respond.

Although Lai Xiao was young, he had followed Master Gou since childhood. From what he heard and saw, his heart was the most vicious. He immediately advised: "Quietly do away with him."

Unfortunately, Chen Xuan shook his head repeatedly. Killing wasn't a problem, but Chen Lin was after all his own nephew—he couldn't bring himself to do it. Besides, this kind of thing couldn't be done flawlessly. If it leaked out in the future, his reputation in Nansha would be completely ruined.

Since Chen Xuan wasn't willing to take this dark step, they could only strictly monitor the nephew's movements. This task naturally fell to Lai Xiao.

Lai Xiao specially gathered a few informants from the militia and the village. After giving them some small favors, he instructed them to watch Chen Lin closely—see whose families he contacted frequently and what he said.

Today he had come specially to report. Entering the room and seeing Master Xuan's expression wasn't good, he became cautious and said in a low voice: "Master Xuan, you ordered us to find out the news, and it's all been found out..."

"Oh? What news?" Chen Xuan's spirits lifted and he asked.

"Last night he was at Chen Ji's house. He chatted with Old Fifth Chen's family very late; the firelight didn't go out until nearly the third watch."

"What did they chat about?"

"This wasn't heard clearly—can't get too close. Still, it definitely wasn't anything good. There's another thing: someone said after Young Master Lin returned, he went to the graveyard. He and Miss Yue stayed in the graveyard for a long time. During that time, there was also crying."
