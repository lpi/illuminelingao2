# Chapter 28 - Gao Ju's Troubles

Chapter 28 Gao Ju's Troubles

Gao Qing was sweating, and Master Gao was also sweating.

Don't misunderstand. Although Master Gao was middle-aged and inevitably a bit chubby, he was still a very robust man. He was not the kind of dough-faced rich man who needed tonics to cope with concubines due to weakness.

Horses might not be able to run on his arms, but he had faced dozens of swords and muskets without changing his expression. Such a figure was breaking out in cold sweat on a not-so-hot late spring afternoon.

A month ago, he received a letter from Eunuch Yang, saying that he had sent his adopted son - Yang Tianliang to Guangzhou to discuss important matters with him. Gao Ju really couldn't be sure what this important matter was, and his heart was beating like a drum.

Giving half of the profit to this eunuch for nothing made him feel painful every time, but over the years, relying on Eunuch Yang's protection, he had come through with fright but no danger. Therefore, for the annual interest and dividend, he sent every single copper coin to the capital or deposited it into the pawnshop in Guangzhou according to his instructions.

Every year he sent lychees in summer and precious delicacies in winter, never daring to neglect this great eunuch for a day. Why did he suddenly send a Little Eunuch Yang to discuss some important matter with him?

Important matter? Gao Ju smiled bitterly. He was just a merchant. What important matter could be discussed with such a master in the palace? It was nothing more than asking him to take out a large sum of money for "temporary use" or "service". And the amount must be huge, otherwise it would be just a matter of a letter, why send an "adopted son" all the way here - it seems Eunuch Yang is in a hurry! He sighed. The windfall that fell from the sky a few months ago had to be spit out again.

Losing some money was not what he feared most. Since the Nine Thousand Years gained power in the Tianqi years, things in the palace had become increasingly unfathomable. His backer, Eunuch Yang, came from Gao Shiming's sect. This Eunuch Gao resigned automatically in the first year of Tianqi to protect himself. Eunuch Yang was also a marginalized figure in the palace now.

What if the Nine Thousand Years doesn't like Eunuch Yang? Gao Ju couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. He didn't like Eunuch Yang at all - but the relationship of mutual use over so many years had tied them together - like two grasshoppers on a rope. If Eunuch Yang is finished today, the agents of the Eastern Depot will knock on his door tomorrow, and the disaster of family ruin and extermination will arrive immediately.

This time, don't let it be for this matter? Gao Ju started sweating again and couldn't help shouting:
"Fan me!"

The maid serving in the study hurriedly waved the silk fan gently beside him. The breeze was sent gently, mixed with a wisp of the scent of powder and female body. Usually, no matter how irritable the mood was, it could be calmed down. But not this time. He only felt hot all over, suddenly sat up from the couch, and cursed:
"All of you get out!"

The maids and young servants in the room were all startled, and hurriedly retreated with their necks shrunk and waists bent.

Just endured for a moment, he heard someone report:
"Steward Yan is here."

"Call him in."

Steward Yan came to report that Gao Qing just came to report that the Australian maritime merchants had arrived.

"Already arrived?" Gao Ju rolled his eyes. This was considered good news. It gave him some euphoric feeling more or less. After all, seeing money coming is always pleasant. Recently, they no longer wanted porcelain, but wanted various precious medicinal materials and spices, and also purchased various hardwoods and sandalwood. This puzzled Gao Ju: Things are not hard to buy, there are plenty in Guangzhou city - the problem is that nine out of ten of these goods are produced in the Western Ocean (Western Ocean of Zheng He's voyages, not the later meaning). Any foreign maritime merchant transports them. Why ask him to buy them on their behalf? This made him feel increasingly strange about the background of this group of maritime merchants.

This Gao Qing is also a waste. He served there for more than two months and found out nothing. But he didn't expect this dull man to find out anything originally.

At present, he couldn't care about so much. He snorted and asked:
"How is the collection of goods? Are there any new goods?"

"Replying to Master, no new goods. The subordinates are counting the numbers."

"Good, invite them over to talk."

"The Australian masters also brought a... um, merchant guest over," Steward Yan didn't know how to address the extra person this time, nor did he know whether he was a servant partner or an equal merchant.

"Invite them together."

"This subordinate understands," Steward Yan took a step forward and whispered, "The new person this time seems to be a martial arts practitioner. Master, should we?"

"Hmm." Gao Ju pondered for a moment and felt it was unnecessary, but Steward Yan's consideration was also loyal to protect the master, so he ordered, "You pass the word, ask Instructor Zhao to take a few guards to serve in the courtyard. Do not show themselves."

"Yes, this subordinate understands." Seeing no other instructions, Steward Yan was about to retreat.

"Wait, the person sent to Shaozhou hasn't sent back news yet?"

"No. Little Eunuch Yang only left the capital on the second day of the third month. Probably he hasn't reached the boundary of Nan'an Prefecture yet. He will arrive in about ten days."

"Tell the private secretaries to find and open all letters related to Eunuch Yang, check Little Eunuch Yang's background, how old he is, which year he was adopted, what hobbies he has, find everything for me."

"Yes, Master."

"Has any new court gazette come?"

"The private secretaries didn't say, probably not. In April, there was only an urgent selection gazette. It was all news about official appointments, so it wasn't presented..."

"What bastard words, send someone to fetch it quickly!" This urgent selection gazette is different from ordinary residence gazettes. It is the list of officials appointed and supplemented by the Ministry of Personnel. Although there are no high officials of regions, but a falling leaf reveals autumn. The position changes of small officials might also show some wind direction of the court.

After finishing the instructions, he drank a few more mouthfuls of tea to calm his mind. Then he got up and went to the outer study to meet the guests.

Bei Wei passed through the wormhole for the first time. Right now in this Ming person's house, it felt like a dream.

Being a scout was a long time ago. No matter what he did after retiring, he still tried hard to maintain the skills learned in the past. His participation in the time travel trade this time focused on a simple staff travel for future underground activities in Guangzhou.

Master Gao was their collaborator, but only a collaborator. Since it was purely profit-driven cooperation, he could betray the Transmigrators at any time. This must be guarded against.

If other forces intervene and harm Master Gao for their own purposes, causing their cooperation to be unsustainable, preparations must be made in advance for the purpose of protecting the collaborator and this channel.

From leaving the back door of the Guangzhou branch to entering the Gao residence, Bei Wei walked with a peculiar stiff pace, each step being a standard eighty centimeters. His carry-on bag contained a portable video camera, automatically filming the environment he walked through. More reliable than this were his eyes and brain: recording every door, every courtyard, where it turned, where there was a door...

Unrelated servants in the mansion were sent away by Steward Yan. The strange behavior of this new Australian still made the few servants leading the way and escorting whisper. But they also envied that strong physique - ordinary servants probably couldn't pass three moves under his hands.

Both host and guests were exchanging pleasantries at the moment. To avoid unnecessary social intercourse, it was decided before departure: Bei Wei was in the capacity of a guard brought by Australian maritime merchants, so he just sat upright behind President Wen, hands on knees, motionless. eyes were scanning all directions.

Although called the outer study, it was actually a complete small courtyard. This hall was not small either. Bei Wei scanned with his eyes and knew there were eleven Ming people in the hall: that Master Gao, a leading steward, a guard, two serving maids, two young servants, and four servants in the four corners of the hall.

The four servants had well-proportioned figures, small and sturdy. Without asking, they were Gao family's guards. Their shirts were slightly loose, probably hiding guys like iron rulers inside.

This was just a part. From entering this courtyard, Bei Wei discovered that behind the rockery and trees in the courtyard, there were four other guards standing inconspicuously.

The real expert was probably the guard standing behind Master Gao, controlling the door leading to the side wing room. Dressed in blue arrow-sleeved clothes, standing silently with hands down, but there was a faintly revealed sharpness on his body.

Don't know how powerful these Ming Dynasty martial arts masters are. Bei Wei's heart itched. If there was a chance to fight with them, he wouldn't miss it. He was very interested in traditional Chinese martial arts. The fighting learned in the army was mainly modern combat, and he didn't dabble much in traditional martial arts. He had also observed some martial arts performances, but always felt unsatisfied: there were too many flowery fists and embroidered legs, and real combat techniques were not shown.

Master Gao and Wen Desi continued their business sutra. Both were a bit absent-minded. One was thinking about Eunuch Yang's matter, and the other was considering the expansion of the Guangzhou branch.

Wen Desi's main purpose this time was to expand this Guangzhou branch.

The foundation laid currently was good, but still too closed. All their external exchanges were conducted through Gao Ju. This situation was unfavorable for future trade and intelligence work. One idea of the Executive Committee was to "go out" as much as possible and develop more agents - not only merchants like Master Gao, but also officials, scholars, and ordinary people.

Of course, it couldn't be done at this time. Their appearance was strange, and their speech was peculiar. Going out would be destined to be onlookers. However, the family of servants Gao Ju gave them gave them another opportunity. As long as they could win the hearts of Gao Qing's family, the road ahead would become wider and wider.

The talk ended quickly. The cargo lists of both sides were handed over, and this transaction was considered done. Goods and silver would naturally be transported by someone, without them worrying. Master Gao was eager to go to the study to read the data organized by the private secretaries, and had no intention to keep them for dinner politely, so he ordered someone to send a table of banquet over.
