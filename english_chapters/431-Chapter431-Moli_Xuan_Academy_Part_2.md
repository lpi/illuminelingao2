# Chapter 431 Moli Xuan Academy (Part 2)

Although Liu Dalin couldn't walk and had to be carried by two family members, he still toured the library up and down, with feelings of emotion overflowing. He was a Lingao native and the only *jinshi* since the county was established in the Tang dynasty. He had always valued the county's cultural atmosphere. However, Lingao had always had few people and a poor county. Maintaining a few academies and charitable schools was already fraught with difficulties, let alone undertaking something as expensive as building a book collection. In ancient times, the seeds of scholarship had to be cultivated with money—the flourishing literary tradition in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions during the Ming and Qing, producing so many *jinshi* and top scholars, was no coincidence, nor simply "blessed with talented people." It was determined by the local economic level.

Though this library wasn't large in scale, it was rare that the Australians had such intentions for Lingao! In his view, the Australians' donation of this library was far more significant than their bandit suppression and road building in the county—it belonged to a "hundred-year plan." This couldn't help but raise questions in his mind about the Crossing Group's purpose again.

During this time, Xiong Buyou and his subordinates were constantly observing the expressions and behavior of the attendees.

Among them, several were on the Political Security Bureau's blacklist, including Huang Shoutong's second son—he was a proper stipend student in the county. This young scholar in his thirties, with dark skin and developed muscles, didn't say a word throughout the ribbon-cutting and tour, but his eyes kept darting around. He appeared very alert.

Looking at his complexion and muscles, and the large hands with bulging veins that occasionally showed, Xiong Buyou knew this person was definitely not a frail scholar. This man had done farm work, been on battlefields, and killed people. He had a resolute will and knowledge. Xiong Buyou felt he rather admired him: if all the scholars of the Great Ming were like this, rather than indulging in empty talk about metaphysics all day, perhaps Chinese modern history wouldn't have entered a period of regression.

Most people were completely in a relaxed, "just passing through" state, walking around and chatting animatedly. Under the large tree in Moli Xuan, Xiong Buyou had set up a long table covered with a tablecloth. In reception style, the trays on the table were filled with glass cups. Four Western-style small barrels contained different flavors of kvass: mint, citrus, jackfruit, and green tea. Beside them were large insulated containers filled with crushed ice, with tongs available for anyone to use.

Besides kvass, ordinary tea was also prepared. Tea cups filled with tea leaves were arranged neatly, with several rattan-covered thermos bottles lined up in a row. Anyone who needed tea could immediately make some.

Xiong Buyou had also requested a group of students from the National School specifically for service work. Hu Qingbai had originally planned to send some pretty girls, but Xiong Buyou thought it better not to let girls appear, to avoid leaving any bad impression on these pedantic scholars. So all who came were rather proper-looking boys.

The scholars were curious about the reception format, and the brand-new flavors of iced drinks made them flock to them. A long line immediately formed in front of the table providing kvass. In comparison, the hot tea side was rather deserted. Even so, some people took a strong interest in the thermos bottles.

Thermos bottles weren't like mirrors, which were optional items. Ancient people found it difficult to use hot water. Although there were tea coasters for insulation and "soup pots" on stove tops, whenever hot water was needed, it had to be freshly boiled. Slightly wealthier households always kept a "wind stove" with a smoldering fire at home. The so-called wind stove was a small charcoal-burning stove. Taking advantage of charcoal's characteristic of strong heat output, one could open the stove door at any time to boil water. Ordinary households, unable to afford the charcoal for wind stoves, had to make do with lukewarm water.

During the late 19th to early 20th century, very few modern industrial products could be sold in rural China. The only truly successful ones were matches and kerosene lamps—and then thermos bottles. The latter was at least promoted in rural areas of more prosperous regions.

From this, one could see that this item could still open up a certain market in the Great Ming.

From Xiong Buyou's observations, the scholars' impression of the Crossing Group was "with interest." There was also "envy." Some were serious in attitude, but none showed obvious hostility. At the opening ceremony, *Jinshi* Liu's attitude had softened. It seemed there was hope for winning him over! However, *Jinshi* Liu's attitude was still quite clear. Throughout the entire ceremony, apart from briefly responding to greetings from local officials and scholars, he only nodded slightly in acknowledgment of Xiong Buyou's greeting. Not a single word was exchanged.

*This old man still has some misgivings about us,* Xiong Buyou thought. *But we have plenty of sugar-coated bullets here.*

On this side, Wu Mingjin saw that the county's provincial graduates and *xiucai* had almost all arrived, and it seemed no one had "joined the bandits," which was a relief. He pulled Wang Ci aside and asked in a low voice: had the Short Hairs made any moves to recruit the county's scholars? This time with the renovation of Moli Xuan, had the Short Hairs put forward any conditions, such as requiring the county's scholars to do something?

Wang Ci hurriedly said that the other party's renovation of Moli Xuan and the county school was unconditional; no requirements for scholars to come do anything had been raised. Wu Mingjin looked skeptical and questioned him repeatedly, making Wang Ci quite unhappy. Finally, he let out a cold laugh and said: "The scholars are all outside. This subordinate will call them in right now. Your Honor can ask them yourself!"

Wu Mingjin gave an awkward laugh and said in a low voice: "Sir, there's no need for anger. This is also for prevention. Scholars are not like country bumpkins—those are just ignorant common folk. If scholars join the bandits, the consequences are endless."

"This subordinate knows. We absolutely cannot let them succeed," Wang Ci said firmly. "But in this subordinate's view, the Australians have done nothing improper. They have actually brought many benefits to the county..."

"Hmm," Wu Mingjin nodded, closing his eyes without speaking. After a long while, he opened his eyes and said, "That's precisely what makes one uneasy."

If they had just come to burn, kill, and plunder, they would be nothing more than ordinary bandits. Doing good deeds everywhere like this was buying people's hearts. What did ordinary bandits need to buy people's hearts for? Their ambitions were not small.

Wang Ci didn't think as far ahead as Wu Mingjin. For him, solving the immediate problems was good enough. As for who solved them, he didn't much care.

After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, a banquet was held by the Crossing Group. The banquet wasn't lavish, but it allowed many poor *tongsheng* and poor *xiucai* who hadn't seen meat for ages to eat until their mouths were greasy. A few whose stomachs had been vegetarian for too long, having just drunk a bellyful of iced kvass and then eaten fish and meat, couldn't take it and started running to the toilet before the banquet even ended. Wang Ci cried out that this was a disgrace to scholars.

Although there was this small incident, the overall atmosphere at the banquet was harmonious and joyful, with the friendship between the Great Ming and Australia blossoming. At the banquet, Xiong Buyou gave an enthusiastic speech, expressing that the Australian Group would make greater contributions to Lingao's educational cause. At the same time, he announced that the expenses for Moli Xuan Academy would be supported by them, including teachers' salaries and students' living allowances. This would be disbursed through an organization called a "foundation."

The natives didn't know what a foundation was, but the Australians' willingness to sponsor Moli Xuan Academy won everyone's unanimous praise. In the warm atmosphere, the attending gentry also made donations of three or five *liang* each, actually collecting thirty *liang* of silver. Xiong Buyou struck while the iron was hot and proposed on the spot at the banquet to hire Liu Dalin as the Academy Head of Moli Xuan Academy. This proposal received unanimous approval from the attendees—in Lingao, when it came to examination rank and literary reputation, who was stronger than Liu Dalin?

Liu Dalin was somewhat caught off guard, but in such a situation, he couldn't publicly refuse. Fortunately, Moli Xuan Academy had existed since ancient times, and taking the position of Academy Head couldn't possibly be construed as accepting a puppet position. So he said a few polite words about his physical disability and feared he might disappoint everyone, that he could only do his best, and accepted.

Liu Dalin's position as Academy Head was of course only nominal. With his physical disability, coming to inspect and give lectures every few days would already be quite good. An Academy Head not only had to lecture but was also responsible for the academy's specific affairs, equivalent to a modern school principal. Given Liu Dalin's physical condition, this was very difficult to do. So Wang Ci was additionally appointed as Deputy Academy Head, specifically responsible for the academy's affairs. Moli Xuan Academy was different from other academies—from the beginning, it was heavily official in character, so having the County Educational Director manage it was also justified.

Wang Ci also hired several provincial graduates and *xiucai* from the county who were learned and upright as professors of the academy. Thus, the basic structure was established.

Moli Xuan Academy had a quota of forty students, divided into four study halls. The new Moli Xuan Academy didn't accept degree-holding students—Lingao, unlike places with flourishing literary traditions, had very few *xiucai* in the county. One county school was more than enough. It mainly recruited *tongsheng*.

To enroll, one must either have *tongsheng* qualification or be recommended by the Crossing Group. This point was specifically proposed by Xiong Buyou. Their sponsorship of the county's traditional Confucian education wasn't just to please local intellectuals; it also had the intention of cultivating their own scholars. Especially for sending intelligence agents to the Mainland in the future—using a scholar's identity as cover would more easily allow infiltration into the upper levels of society. To disguise oneself as a scholar, the Transmigrators' terrible handwriting wouldn't do. For example, the Leizhou plan was already on the agenda. Without specialized training, trying to impersonate a prefecture or county official would be an impossible mission.

Every enrolled student received a living allowance. This allowance wasn't in kind like rice, charcoal, or lamp oil, but in Circulation Vouchers—issued at a standard of 30 Yuan per person per month. Additionally, bedding and fabric for making clothes were provided once a year. Furthermore, study supplies like brushes, ink, paper, inkstones, and books were also provided free of charge. The treatment was quite generous.

Academy students lived in dormitories and were provided with unified meals—the meals were provided by the Women's Cooperative Restaurant at the East Gate Market, at the same standard as the National School students. Students could rest one day every six days. This rest system wasn't invented by the Transmigrators; in the Ming dynasty, some academies already had one day off every five days.
