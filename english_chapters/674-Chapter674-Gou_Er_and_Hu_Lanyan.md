# Chapter 674 - Gou Er and Hu Lanyan

Especially control over population: without local collaborators, effective governance couldn't be established. Unless foreign invaders could bring sufficient settlers, they could only rely on local people willing to submit—to build government institutions, military forces, and police.

Liu Yixiao immediately threw himself into busy work. He spent every day meeting and talking with people, especially the household servants and private secretaries of gentry and wealthy families who came into the city to test the waters. Given their reputation in Lingao and Chengmai, no one now dared directly confront the transmigrator regime, and even passive resistance of the "ignore them" variety had vanished. The wealthy families only wanted to know: what price would they have to pay to maintain the status quo?

The price was substantial but not unbearable. Besides, according to merchants who had come from Lingao, life there was quite comfortable now. Markets thrived, and public order was secure. Bandits were either executed or forced to build roads—no one dared cause trouble.

The wealthy families figured if that was the case, matters like labor conscription and grain requisition could be managed. As for "land surveying"—though some muttered privately, everyone felt this was the new dynasty's law, something to cope with for now. In time it would naturally slacken. Old-timers said when the Hongwu Emperor ascended the throne, corrupt officials were mowed down like leeks. But once the Emperor passed, officials were just as corrupt again. As long as they could preserve their lives and property now, they could make long-term plans later.

In this atmosphere, every last gentry family, wealthy household, and village in Danzhou sent representatives to the "First Danzhou Political Consultative Conference" held at Chaotian Temple.

At this conference, the Danzhou Post-Disaster Management Bureau was established. Liu Yixiao appointed himself Director-General; Yin Chengshi was made Executive Secretary. Over a dozen of Danzhou's most prestigious degree-holding gentry were designated as committee members. All villages were required to send liaison officers to regular county meetings to receive orders.

Liu Yixiao's work expanded rapidly. He needed no experimentation, no discussion. He had Lingao's complete set of experiences to draw on, intelligence materials from the Political Security Bureau's network, and tremendous help from the native cadres he had brought—as people of this timeline, they understood it better than the transmigrators.

Hu Lanyan stretched his arms. The rain outside was tapering off. He opened the eyelid that had drooped since childhood eye disease had ulcerated it. Outside the shelter, the fire doused by rain was smoking. A wave of damp chill made him shiver.

"Damn it." Hu Lanyan cursed, scratching himself all over. Around him, more than a dozen of his trusted men lay sprawled, snoring like dead pigs.

He stood up. This was deep in the mountains. Except for occasional Li hunters nearby, no one came here. His relations with the Li weren't bad—Hu Lanyan never robbed or killed Li people in his territory. The Li were quite vicious when seeking vengeance. Maintaining peaceful relations helped him survive peacefully in this area.

This was a spur of Baoshe Ridge, over twenty kilometers northeast of the prefectural city. Twenty kilometers in modern times was less than half an hour by car, but in this timeline, it was already an extremely remote part of the county—high mountains, dense forests, Li activity, very few Han settlers, most of whom clustered in fortified villages.

This was Hu Lanyan's new main camp. When Lingao started its bandit suppression, this bandit chief had initially been unconcerned. But as bandit gangs were eliminated one by one, more and more scattered bandits fled to him. Hu Lanyan knew he couldn't stay, so he consulted with Gou Xunli: if Lingao was no longer safe, they should find a new base in Danzhou.

After Gou Xunli joined Luo Maoshan, he became Hu Lanyan's advisor. He was Hu Lanyan's sworn brother, had a head full of schemes, and could read and write—an absolute asset among bandits. He quickly rose to second-in-command.

Gou Xunli dreamed day and night of the mixed-blood "wanton woman" sending someone with instructions, so he could fiercely strike back at the "bald bandits" for revenge. But months passed with no word from Macao. He didn't dare go to the county seat or East Gate Market—he was too well-known, and many in the county would recognize him. So he just bided his time in the bandit lair, waiting for the day he could be part of the "Returned Homeland Corps."

News that the bald bandits were launching bandit suppression had already secretly alarmed Gou Xunli. More than anyone, he understood the bald bandits' power. Now that Hu Lanyan proposed moving, there was no objection—as long as they kept their lives, there was always a chance to rise again. But he understood bandit rules: though it looked like endless wilderness, every inch was someone's territory. The arrival of outside bandits would inevitably mean turf war.

Outside bandits usually lost such wars unless they were very strong—the saying was "even a mighty dragon can't suppress the local snake." Hu Lanyan wasn't worried because he was from Danzhou himself, and more than half his men were Danzhou natives—specifically, fellow villagers from neighboring villages. Now their gang had swelled to over two hundred with the absorption of scattered bandits. With local kinship and clan support, seizing this territory was no problem.

So he led his men, provisions, and valuables, abandoned the old stockade, and set off for Danzhou. Along the way, they routed a bandit gang that tried to ambush them for plunder, killed its chief, absorbed his men, and picked up many more scattered bandits. By the time they reached Danzhou, they numbered over three hundred—a formidable force.

With numbers and local kinship and clan backing, Hu Lanyan quickly crushed and eliminated the bandits entrenched on Baoshe Ridge, becoming the local lord.

Although Hu Lanyan's force was strong, more men meant greater expenses. He sent some locals who didn't want to continue as active bandits home to be "home-based bandits"—meaning they would be called up for raids and share the spoils when there was action, but otherwise farmed at home. He himself stayed in the mountains with over a hundred core bandits, occasionally finding opportunities to come down and pull a job.

But a few days ago, scouts reported: a force of bald bandits had occupied Danzhou city. This worried Hu Lanyan greatly. The Australians were particularly enthusiastic about bandit suppression. If they did the same in Danzhou, he would have to flee to Changhua—that place was all sand, and the people were dirt poor. Going there meant he couldn't even feed his men.

Hu Lanyan yawned, picked up a bamboo dipper, scooped water from a rain-filled vat outside the shelter, rinsed his mouth, and splashed some on his face. He kicked the "sentry" sleeping soundly at the shelter entrance:

"You, stop playing dead. Go fetch Advisor Gou!"

Gou Xunli lived in another shelter nearby. He had one all to himself—not just a special privilege but a practical necessity. His shelter was piled with the gang's various account books and rosters.

Gou Xunli was resting with eyes closed. He had once had some followers, but after things went badly in Guangzhou and money gradually ran out, the people had all left. Now he was well and truly alone. Though he kept encouraging himself, since the imperial army's crushing defeat at Chengmai, his flame of hope had grown dim.

Gou Xunli's only hope now was that his son was safe—he had heard nothing of his son for a long time. He had sent people to Qiongshan to inquire, but they reported that Gou Chengxuan had left there long ago.

"Brother, tell me—what should we do?" Hu Lanyan took a cooked taro from a subordinate, shook some salt from a bamboo tube, and began eating heartily.

"For now, we can only endure." Gou Xunli smiled bitterly and peeled a taro for himself. Eating their fill in the mountains wasn't a problem—grain and salt extorted from wealthy families and farmers were plentiful. They even had cloth, silver, and valuables. But good food was hard to get—they had to hunt for fresh meat.

"If they come to suppress us, though..."

"The bald bandits haven't established themselves yet. They won't come suppressing bandits." Gou Xunli said. "We needn't worry. Their usual pattern is to first give the local people some benefits—build roads, construct markets, train militia. Only when all that's in place will they come for bandits. That takes at least half a year to a year."

"Half a year, a year, fine—even without operations, we can get by without doing business. But what then?"

Gou Xunli didn't know what then either. A sense of despair, of having no way out, settled over him. The bald bandits probably intended to sweep the entire island.

He sighed. "The imperial army was too useless..."

When the imperial forces had massed at Qiongshan preparing to punish the bald bandits, he and Hu Lanyan had been excited for a while. Gou Xunli had suggested that once the imperial army reached Lingao's borders, they could raise five or six hundred men in Danzhou and go offer their services. Not only would they easily get pardoned, but a rank like *bazong* was certainly attainable. And they could plunder handsomely along the way.

They never expected the imperial army to be defeated so quickly and completely. Even now, both still sighed when the subject came up.

Gou Xunli pondered silently for a long while. Finally he said fiercely: "We can hide for a while but not forever. In my view, we must hit them hard—let them know what we're made of!"

Hu Lanyan was astonished. "Brother! Have you gone mad? You know better than anyone how fearsome these bald bandits are. It would be great luck if they don't come looking for us—why would we go poke the tiger's whiskers!"

Besides, according to scout reports, the bald bandits in Danzhou numbered nearly a thousand. All the bandit gangs in Danzhou territory combined didn't add up to a thousand.

"Big brother," Gou Xunli said, "the bald bandits have powerful firearms and refined tactics—we're no match for them in a frontal fight. But their thousand men can't stay together all day. Eventually they'll have to send small parties 'to the villages.'"
