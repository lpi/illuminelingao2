# Chapter 190: New Year's Eve Movie

The streets reeked with a peculiar stench. Obviously, there was no sewage system. Wastewater mixed and flowed along the streets. Pigs and dogs wandered freely, scavenging for food. Flies buzzed everywhere. Seeing this, transmigrators who'd been eager to occupy the county seat cooled considerably.

"I'd rather live in tents than this dump." Old Tiger You had always been a hardliner, frequently questioning the Executive Committee's policy of not occupying the county seat. Now, after seeing it, he thought: whoever wants it can have it. He definitely wasn't going to be part of the Lingao occupation army.

The 17th-century ancient city tour fad faded by evening. Dinner was cafeteria gathering. Though nothing fancy, the New Year's Eve dishes had enough fat content. Fish-and-shrimp-weary masses finally got sufficient meat, plus specially issued dumplings from flour stores—flour had become extremely scarce. Wheat wasn't grown locally, so flour couldn't be bought. Southerners mocked Northerners' "dumpling complex": "Never eaten anything good, treat dumplings like treasure." Northerners countered: "If you don't want them, leave them for us hicks." But though Southerners weren't interested in making dumplings, they still contained meat. That right, they firmly refused to surrender.

New Year's Eve afternoon, except security and key departments, all offices closed. Xiao Zishan was still in his office preparing post-holiday assembly materials. Only after a while did he notice it had gotten dark, lights coming on outside. Feeling tired, he stepped outside, walked around the Executive Committee courtyard, rubbing his face, occasionally greeting passing people. The wired speakers were playing holiday songs on repeat—now "God of Wealth Knocks on Your Door," now "Congratulations, Congratulations, Congratulations"—a bit tacky, but with festive flavor. The music was occasionally interrupted by a cloying female voice:

"Li Haiping wishes all Navy comrades and friends a New Year where all hopes are fulfilled, all dreams come true, all waiting bears fruit, all efforts are rewarded. Sincere wishes for abundant blessings, continuous joy, all things complete, sweet smiles."

"Wu Nanhai wishes all Agricultural Department staff..."

"Industrial Department Machinery Division wishes Metallurgy Division all personnel..."

Besides interdepartmental greetings, many were personal. Xiao Zishan smiled. Then his PHS phone chirped twice—an advertisement: "To celebrate New Year, Lingao Telecom launches Spring Festival greeting service and ringtone downloads—" Damn, when did we get a Lingao Telecom?! Communications Department people had big ideas.

Xiao Zishan was tired yet unusually excited. He felt Bairren Fortress had never been this bright—just like his mood. Today, all normally power-saving lights had been fully turned on. So though there were no "lanterns and decorations," it still felt festive. Almost like celebrating New Year in the 21st century—except everyone wore single-layer clothing, lacking winter atmosphere.

Just as he was enjoying the ambiance, Xi Yazhou walked in, clutching a paper. Seeing him still there, his eyes lit up with delight: "Zishan! Looking for you! Afraid you'd left for the day."

"We don't have leaving or not leaving." Xiao Zishan knew he was probably about the movie projection business.

"Found the projector!" Xi Yazhou exclaimed excitedly.

The Executive Committee had discussed enriching cultural life a few days ago. Especially showing movies. Cultural life had been lacking lately. "Bread, wine, and circus"—Xiao Zishan fully agreed with this notion. A leader's stupidest move was deliberately depriving people of entertainment—the harder the times, the more cultural life was needed.

Actually, various departments had been internally showing films for months. Initially for work: Construction Engineering showed "Rural Small Hydropower Construction," Military showed training films, Agricultural showed "Golden Soil" and such. But following society's general development patterns, lofty beginnings often acquired other elements. Gradually, besides "work films," "welfare films" appeared: from TV series and imported blockbusters to adult films. This phenomenon caused complaints from ordinary members not in specialty departments: with daily electricity rationed and most personal laptops unusable, certain departments projecting movies was naked privilege.

This discontent had recently become significant, with complaints flooding the Executive Committee. But the commissioners couldn't get tough on this issue—they themselves often watched movies in various departments.

Moreover, these film-showing departments were the most important ones. On that basis alone, they couldn't ban it and hurt technical personnel's morale. After discussion, the conclusion was: rather than everyone quarreling, hold regular public screenings. Everyone suffered not from scarcity but inequality.

The transmigrators' most common projection equipment was projectors connected to computers. This had been used for departmental screenings recently. But projector bulbs had short lifespans and were fragile; one bulb had already burned out. At this rate, all spare bulbs would soon fail.

After searching, Xi Yazhou had finally found the forgotten 16mm small projector and matching speakers, screen, and power equipment in Planning Committee's mountain of warehouse materials. Also several boxes of old film reels. Plus two 16mm movie cameras and portable developing equipment. He'd conspired with buddies to steal these from his father's factory before transmigration.

"No more using precious projectors. Those are valuable." He excited waved the yellowed paper in his hand. "This is the reel box inventory. Take a look and decide what to show."

"Great!" Xiao Zishan was pleased. 16mm projectors were essentially pure mechanical-electric, relatively easy to repair. Some parts could be manufactured with their future industrial capacity, extending operational life. In their cultural development plans, movie screenings would be important for cultural promotion. Long-range plans included mass-producing such equipment.

"*South-North War*, *Joy at the Door*, *Our Niu Baisui*, *Valter Defends Sarajevo*, *New Look of the Motherland 1979 Issue 3*, *Agricultural Knowledge 1981 Issue 5*—" Xiao Zishan looked a long time. All 1950s-80s domestic films and old foreign films. Many were familiar to their age group—enough for a nostalgic film festival.

"Just these?" Xiao Zishan set down the inventory, disappointed. "Who wants to watch this stuff?"

"Don't be ungrateful. Where would you get new films? Expecting blockbusters from this?"

"It'll work for now. What about later? Watch them over and over? They'll spit on you!"

"So what do you suggest?" Xi Yazhou deflated. He knew these were indeed too old.

"Start with the projector. We'll figure something out later." Xiao Zishan thought. "I recall celluloid isn't hard to make. Once we can mass-produce film stock, we'll transfer content to film."

"Only option."

They discussed New Year's Eve screening content. Xiao Zishan pulled up the resource inventory. Considering everyone's preferences and the holiday atmosphere, they selected three different films.

Luo Duo was strolling in the square. Today was New Year's Eve. He hadn't joined the "Lingao Day Tour." Since landing, with his powerful human-database functionality, he'd successfully joined the Intelligence Data Team. His role was essentially librarian—registering and searching various materials. This job initially felt important—many team leaders and commissioners asked him to search data and even consulted him for advice. But prolonged desk work eventually became tedious. So he'd applied to join the militia, patrolling and standing guard when off duty as a break. Actually, his real goal was transferring to the upcoming Intelligence Department during the post-holiday organizational restructuring—ever since watching *Seventeen Moments of Spring*, he'd been fascinated. Besides day-and-night studying relevant materials, he believed his militia service record would add weight to his future job transfer.

"Attention, attention," a man's voice came over the loudspeaker. "Tonight at 7 PM, Bairren Cinema screens a New Year's Eve special. No tickets required for entry. Contains top-tier intense content. Not suitable for children. Not suitable for new girlfriends. Suitable for girlfriends you're trying to seduce and wives—"

The loudspeaker suddenly carried angry roaring: "What nonsense are you spouting!" Then chaotic sounds, then everything cut to "Congratulations, Congratulations, Congratulations" again.

This interlude startled him—someone's prank, probably. But he'd heard about the movie screening. As for whether adult films would be shown, he wasn't interested—in the Intelligence Data Team, computer usage wasn't rationed. He could watch as many movies as he wanted. But watching too many adult films was empty: no matter how many actresses, how lewdly they moaned, however angelic their faces and devilish their bodies, they were still just phantom images. How could they compare to real women? Luo Duo couldn't help recalling his ex-girlfriends.

He was calculating how to get himself a "domestic secretary" after the New Year distribution. Inside information said: women bought from Guangzhou and trained in "Nursing School," except for a few becoming professional nurses, would mostly be graduating. After that, they'd be assigned as "domestic secretaries." Naturally, not everyone would get one. But Luo Duo had already spotted a girl named "Guo Fu" among them.
