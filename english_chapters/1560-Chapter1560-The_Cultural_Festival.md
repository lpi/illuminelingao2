# Chapter 1560 - The Cultural Festival

Zhuo Yifan started, then quickly regained his composure. He smiled. "Miss has keen eyes—truly befitting one in public service…"

"Hmph," Lian Nishang said. "What keen eyes? You're obviously lying. What poor physician dresses as finely as you? What poor physician has such accomplished martial skills? 'Poor writing, rich fighting,' as they say—without a hundred *qing* of good land, your family couldn't have supported such training."

Zhuo Yifan knew there was no concealing this. She was in public service; if she wanted to check his background, it would be easy. So he smiled. "To be honest, my family does have a modest estate. But the realm is in turmoil these days; I had no choice but to come to Lingao for refuge."

Lian Nishang sneered. "You wealthy landlords are all the same. In times of peace, you squeeze the poor harder than anyone. The moment there's trouble, you're the first to slip away."

Zhuo Yifan bristled inwardly. His family had recently written that they were raising a militia and wanted him to recommend some sect brothers as instructors. If the topic were public-spirited service, who but the gentry and landlords contributed money and effort for local defense? What could a bunch of disorganized peasants possibly accomplish? They were plenty eager when it came to "eating the rich" or rebellion.

But he held his tongue and merely said, "As I said, my family's estate is modest at best. Raising a militia to protect the locality is beyond our means…"

"A militia is just another tool to oppress the poor…" Lian Nishang's cold smile lingered.

Zhuo Yifan flared with anger: *What grudge does she hold against the propertied?* He turned away briefly to calm himself, then said, "Organizing a militia is the business of gentry and landlords. I wouldn't presume to involve myself. In these troubled times, keeping my own family safe is satisfaction enough." He changed the subject. "Your swordplay is quite good too. You must have trained under a proper master."

With formal training came a lineage; they would share the kinship of the martial community. Zhuo Yifan sensed that this young woman's radical words likely sprang from a respectable family that had suffered some great misfortune. Left unsupervised, she had fallen into Shorthair hands and been corrupted. If he could learn of her masters and old connections, he might, through the bonds of jianghu fellowship, gradually guide her back to the light.

"I did take a master and study for a time," Lian Nishang said absently. "But I was young; I didn't learn much. My family…" She broke off. "Why speak of that? Where are you staying? I'll wager it's the Qiong'an Inn."

Zhuo Yifan smiled. "Nothing escapes you. Indeed, that's where I am."

"Hmph. You landlords and moneybags—every one of you who comes to Lingao winds up there. Full of dissolute young masters! Bah!" Perhaps recalling the Bai Siwen affair, she made a chopping gesture. "If I had my way, I'd kill the lot—cleanse the place! Otherwise they'll corrupt the local morals!"

*Truly a wild, seditious creature!* Zhuo Yifan cursed inwardly. Yet looking at her dainty, pretty face, his heart softened again: *Fair maid, why have you turned to banditry?* He would have to instruct her carefully and lead her back from error. He was planning how to broach the subject when she continued, "Just a few days ago, I arrested one—an eldest son of a wealthy family, staying at Qiong'an Inn."

"So it was you who arrested Young Master Bai…" Zhuo Yifan feigned surprise, hoping to draw her out.

"'Young Master Bai'? You address such a person as 'young master'? Disgusting." Lian Nishang made an exaggerated retching motion. "Harassing women in broad daylight wasn't enough—he had to pick on a student from the Arts and Sciences Academy. Now he'll really suffer."

This was the "Arts and Sciences Academy" again. Zhuo Yifan had already heard it mentioned several times. He now knew that both Lian Nishang and the "personal secretary" from earlier were graduates of this wretched "academy." Presumably it was a school for the Shorthairs' favored servants—all its students must be people the True Shorthairs trusted and relied upon…

"Are you going to intercede for him?" Lian Nishang's bright eyes flashed at him.

Zhuo Yifan smiled. "Young Master Bai doesn't understand the local rules. As they say, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans.' If he insisted on behaving according to Great Ming customs, a bit of hard luck here was inevitable. Better now than later."

"That's more like it." Lian Nishang nodded. "You have some sense after all—not like those who know nothing of others' suffering, only their own clan's comfort."

Zhuo Yifan had been about to say something about the propriety between men and women, but realized that at this very moment, the two of them sitting together and "discussing principles" was itself a breach of that propriety. He swallowed his words. "What exactly is this 'Arts and Sciences Academy'?"

Lian Nishang gave him a sidelong glance. "Why do you ask?"

"Just curious. You've mentioned it several times." Zhuo Yifan said. "If it's inconvenient, never mind. Forget I asked."

"There's nothing secret about it—it's just a school for women. Nothing special," Lian Nishang said. "When I arrived in Lingao, I enrolled there. The 'Young Master Bai' who harassed that girl picked on one of my juniors." She glanced at the sunlight through the window. "It's getting late. Let me change; wait for me a moment."

Zhuo Yifan thought: *This time, Young Master Bai is truly in for a rough time. The women of the Arts and Sciences Academy are—*

Lian Nishang changed her clothes, and they left the room together. The gymnasium was now bustling with young men and women in blue or black cloth outfits, hurrying about. Cardboard boxes littered the floor. At the north end of the hall, a stage had been erected. A few youths were perched on ladders, hanging a red silk banner across the wall. White characters on a red field—read from left to right as was the Shorthair custom: "Fourth Annual Campus Cultural Festival."

The characters, though in the vulgar script, were all legible to Zhuo Yifan—but strung together, they made no sense. Especially "Cultural Festival"—utterly nonsensical. He asked, "What does this mean?"

"Fangcaodi and the Arts and Sciences Academy are jointly hosting a cultural festival—everyone gets together for fun, performances, singing, and so on."

Zhuo Yifan understood. "Rather like a temple fair or folk procession? No wonder they call it a 'festival.'"

"Exactly. You're a real scholar." Lian Nishang nodded with a smile. "It's quite a lively affair. With such a large venue here, everyone can come and watch the performances."

Zhuo Yifan nodded deeply: *This is a golden opportunity!* He smiled. "It seems I've arrived at a propitious time."

Lian Nishang rolled her eyes. "Someone with your old-fashioned notions shouldn't bother coming. You'll just complain non-stop about 'moral degradation' and 'offenses against decency' and 'scholars trampled underfoot'—wringing your hands the whole time…"

As she spoke, her nose wrinkled in a way that was suddenly very charming. Zhuo Yifan felt his heart flutter. Before he knew it, he said, "Though I haven't been here long, I'm no stick-in-the-mud—at most a bit surprised…"

"Whether you are or you aren't—that's how Lingao is. What does it matter?" Lian Nishang shrugged. "How the gentry and landlords and scholars view the Yuan Laoyuan—the Chiefs couldn't care less…"

She broke off mid-sentence and waved at someone in the crowd. A young woman emerged, jogging toward them. She wore a white cross-collared blouse with a red ribbon loosely draped at her neck, and a pleated plaid skirt. Zhuo Yifan's heart stirred—*that skirt is far too short!* Yet she was dressed identically to the girl Bai Siwen had harassed. She must be another Arts and Sciences Academy student.

"Elder Sister Lian, you're here too?" The girl looked at Zhuo Yifan, then lowered her voice just enough that he could still hear: "Who's he?"

Lian Nishang shot Zhuo Yifan a glance. "A young master from the Great Ming. He knows some martial arts; I brought him here to spar."

Zhuo Yifan found the girl's bare legs blindingly bright. He performed a proper bow. "This humble one is Zhuo Yifan."

"How polite—and so handsome. Definitely from a wealthy family." The girl gave Lian Nishang a meaningful look, then returned a half-curtsy. "I'm Zuo Yamei."

Lian Nishang introduced her briefly. "She's my colleague—also a police officer."

If Zhuo Yifan had not already encountered those delicate household-registration officers and had Lian Nishang herself before him, he would never have believed such a charming, pretty young woman was "in public service." But after so many strange sights in Lingao, he had grown numb.

Yet these "police officers" held high status under the Shorthairs—nothing like the despised runners of the Great Ming. They were the "pillars of the state" to the Yuan Laoyuan. For the "pillars of the state" to dress so shamelessly—the Shorthairs truly had singular tastes!

Lian Nishang asked, "Why aren't you on duty? Today isn't your day off."

Zuo Yamei smiled. "Our Pleated Skirt Club is performing at this cultural festival. The Chief gave us leave to rehearse. This year's a big event—the Fangcaodi Drama Society is debuting a new play."

"A new play?!" Lian Nishang's interest was piqued.

"That's right—just rehearsed. Supposed to be very good. Some of our juniors from the Arts and Sciences Academy are also in it." Zuo Yamei added, "Several Chiefs from the Pleated Skirt Club are very supportive—they've even told us to audition for small parts."

"You really should try for a leading role…"

"This time students from the Learning Academy are also participating. How could a lead role come to us?"

"True. But I doubt they'd care much about that sort of thing."

…

The two chattered on about the performance, leaving Zhuo Yifan standing off to the side. He was secretly elated: *This so-called 'Cultural Festival' sounds like a grand affair. Many True Shorthairs will attend. If we can strike here, we might deal the Shorthairs a heavy blow!*

Instantly his mind raced through countless calculations. *First things first: I must earn Lian Nishang's trust!* Large as this gymnasium was, entry on the day would surely be restricted to those the Shorthairs trusted. Clearly, Lian Nishang had a favorable impression of him—but his image as a dashing Great Ming gentleman still left her somewhat wary.
