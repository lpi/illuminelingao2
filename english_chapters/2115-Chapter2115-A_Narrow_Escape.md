# Chapter 2115 - A Narrow Escape

Many of the household guards wore armor—whether iron or padded cotton, once in the water it was incredibly heavy. In the chaos, many who fell in couldn't climb out again; dragged down by their armor, they sank to the bottom. A full day of combat had left them utterly exhausted. Even struggling grew weaker; breathlessness began, then hallucinations. Memories flashed through their minds: being taught martial arts by father at six, the first military muster at sixteen, marriage, the birth of children, the Battle of Chengmai...

Consciousness faded, slipping away. Dimly one might feel someone desperately pulling upward—but that sensation too dissolved into nothing, and then everything went black.

Jiang Suo reached the opposite bank and collapsed on the beach, gasping as he had never gasped in his life. His lungs heaved uncontrollably; the taste of blood filled his mouth. He looked back and saw Song Ming lying face-down on the shallows like a corpse, half his body still in the water, absolutely still. Jiang Suo had seen Song Ming fall in; without thinking, he had thrown away his rifle and dived in to save him. No matter how good a swimmer—honed in the fishing village—stripping off armor underwater was no easy feat. He had barely managed to drag Song Ming to shore, and now he had no strength left. He wanted to pull Song Ming fully onto the bank and press the water out of him, but his whole body was limp and weak.

He had survived after all. Though the pontoon bridge was broken, most of the surviving Bangshan garrison had escaped across the river. Many had braved the artillery and musket fire to swim across; now they sprawled on the stony beach, panting. Even with shells and bullets screaming overhead, no one could move.

But the number of survivors was pitifully small. His personally trained household guards wore no armor. Looking around the beach, he counted perhaps twenty or thirty survivors. Jiang Suo felt a wave of desolation: ten survivors out of a hundred. Why did so many have to die?

Hair-Bandit shells continued to arc across the river, exploding on the beach. The soldiers who had been sprawled on the stones scrambled to their feet and fled toward the city.

He tried to call to someone—anyone—to help carry Song Ming. But the soldiers streaming past ignored him completely. Dressed in nothing but a common soldier's tunic, without even a hint of rank, who would listen to him? Only when a few of Song Ming's household guards—survivors who had been searching the beach—finally found him did Jiang Suo remember what Master Yi had once told him: "On the battlefield, you still need a few personal guards you can count on."

Night fell, and the guns went silent. Before dark, Zhu Quanxing had led the 3rd Battalion to occupy Beishan east of the city, then moved north to confront the Ming forces. Except for sporadic exchanges of fire, the advance had been smooth; all objectives for the day had been achieved.

After Bangshan was secured, only a small garrison remained. Engineers worked through the night to improve the roads so artillery could be brought up at dawn. The Gui River was now firmly under the 1st Combined Brigade's control.

Now, except for some sentries, most Fubo soldiers had fallen asleep. Zhu Mingxia had just finished inspecting the units south of the city and had specifically climbed Bangshan.

The battle report for Bangshan had reached his desk half an hour earlier. Total Fubo Army and attached labor casualties: nineteen killed, sixty-seven wounded. Over two hundred Ming bodies found; over four hundred prisoners taken. By that casualty ratio, it was an overwhelming victory—and that didn't even count Ming losses from the shelling of the pontoon bridge.

The captured-weapons report held little interest for him: assorted Ming firearms, fit only for the General Affairs Bureau's smelter. Bangshan also hadn't yielded much stored grain.

In sum: they had cracked a tough nut, but there wasn't much meat.

Still, the Ming tactics on Bangshan demanded serious attention. Zhu Mingxia and Xu Ke had personally climbed the hill, examined the Ming-built works, and inspected the abandoned weapons. They had interrogated several prisoners and convened a brief meeting with participating officers and soldiers to gather firsthand impressions.

From the battlefield evidence, the Ming garrison had clearly been of two types. One was the traditional Ming soldier—some armored, some not. The other wore no armor at all; their tunics were cut shorter and more fitted. They carried canvas ammunition pouches similar to Fubo Army issue, along with percussion caps and paper cartridges. Nearby were always discarded Nanyang rifles.

This must be the "new army" that the intelligence had mentioned—the one trained by the "spy."

Xu Ke was still on the hilltop, photographing and sketching the position with his assistants. Military Intelligence was collecting all relevant information, especially the Nanyang rifles. Every rifle abandoned on the field—damaged or not—was recovered. Broken ones were pieced together to estimate how many Nanyang rifles the enemy had fielded. From serial numbers, they could roughly trace manufacturing dates and sales records.

The export of Nanyang rifles had always been controversial within the Council of Elders. Whether Quark's sales to Southeast Asian potentates or the sales in Shandong to various Ming forces, both had sparked debate. After all, guns once sold didn't care whose side you were on. But the trade was enormously profitable, the market voracious. Debates came and went; sales never stopped. In Shandong, the exports even had firm backing from the Huaxia Society, who argued that since the Council was doing business with the Manchus, they had to "balance the trade" on the Ming side.

Zhu Mingxia wasn't particularly interested in the Nanyang rifles. Export numbers were significant, but ammunition constraints meant no hostile force could field them in large numbers. They posed no real strategic threat.

What interested him more were the period firearms. Captured Ming weapons were plentiful. Over a hundred blunderbusses alone—徐光启's "divine weapon" costing nine taels in labor, and Xiong Wencan had laid out serious money! The battle showed the Ming had fully exploited their available firearms: heavy matchlocks and *Falangjis* of all sizes had been extensively deployed—especially light *Falangjis*, practically indistinguishable from heavy matchlocks. The birdshot muskets and three-eyed handguns so common at Chengmai and the Pearl River estuary were conspicuously absent. Clearly, Ming commanders had recognized those weapons' shortcomings: birdshot lacked power; hand-cannons lacked range and accuracy. They were now experimenting with heavier matchlocks—longer range, greater lethality. Though cumbersome for mobile warfare, that mattered less in positional defense. These weapons had effectively delayed and disrupted the Fubo Army's assault.

The Red Barbarian cannons that the Ming had once revered as divine were nowhere to be seen. Instead, crouching-tiger mortars with their close-range area effect were plentiful, positioned at the ends of communication trenches to seal them off. The commander had clearly thought through the tactical utility of each weapon type.

The enemy was learning fast!

Zhu Mingxia stood on Bangshan's summit, gazing at Wuzhou city, thinking these thoughts.

From the bastion layout to the trench construction, from using lobbed arrows to slow the Fubo advance to the in-trench fighting, from pushing artillery to close range to the active use of newer firearms—all of it revealed that the enemy was beginning to understand the Fubo Army's operational methods and was groping for countermeasures.

From the turntable gun mounts in the Little Three Gorges to the fire-ships to the Bangshan position, all reflected technical and tactical innovation within the Ming forces. The experimentation was still clumsy—partly limited by their technological level, partly perhaps by institutional shortcomings. But clearly the enemy was trying to learn how to fight them. The soldiers who had blundered blindly into battle at Chengmai and the Pearl River estuary were gone.
