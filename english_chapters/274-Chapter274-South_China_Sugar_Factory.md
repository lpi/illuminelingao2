# Chapter 274 South China Sugar Factory

"It should be real. Many sugar industry books say so." Wen Tong was also quite nervous. Never mind himself—even the senior members of his family who had worked in the sugar industry their whole lives had only ever worked in modern factories and never seen this traditional method.

Yet the effect that followed was indeed like magic. After pouring the yellow clay water and waiting a moment, they looked at the sugar in the *wa liu*—it had indeed turned snow-white. Of course, this "snow-white" was relative. Compared to the refined white sugar from another spacetime, its color was still slightly dull and yellowish. It didn't quite reach the "exceptionally pure" level described in the books.

The top of the *wa liu* held the whitest sugar, while the bottom had a slight yellow-brown tint. Both could be considered white sugar, though the former commanded a higher price.

Wen Tong shook his head. He knew very well why the sugar treated with yellow clay water wasn't especially white: the sugar liquid hadn't gone through a centrifuge, so there was still a lot of molasses residue. He wondered if the machinery factory could manufacture a centrifuge.

The output efficiency of this process wasn't high either. The sugar in the *wa liu* was actually stratified—the whitest at the top, getting darker toward the bottom. The sugar at the very bottom of the *wa liu* was quite dark. He weighed it: of the ten kilograms of sugar from one *wa liu*, only about 60% could be considered "white sugar." The rest was yellow or brown sugar. The process was cumbersome and the yield rate was low. In ancient times, such a process could still turn a profit, but once modern sugar enterprises appeared, rustic sugar mills went bankrupt one after another due to cost factors.

What they'd produced so far was only large, irregularly-shaped chunks of sugar. To truly make fine powdered white sugar like "sugar frost," they needed an additional "recrystallization" step. The white sugar had to be melted again and slowly boiled over low heat. Fine sugar powder would gradually crystallize on the surface of the pot. It had to be scraped off promptly with a bamboo scraper to prevent scorching and discoloration. This process was similar to boiling salt. In factories, specialized evaporation-crystallization tanks were used. Wen Tong had to experiment himself. Chang Shide helped tend the fire, and Wen Xiu and Wen Qing assisted. To avoid disrupting the normal production of the sugar mill, Wen Tong had a small sugar mill building constructed on the sugarcane estate to serve as a sugar-making laboratory. The four of them crowded into this temporary structure, surrounded by smoke and flames. Wen Tong was checking the heat one moment and watching the pot the next, growing so dizzy he nearly fell into the sugar pot and caused a tragedy.

Reality proved that a person strong in theory might not excel in practice, especially in such primitive, crude conditions. With a furnace burning sugarcane leaves and bagasse, the heat was simply not something that could be controlled by someone accustomed to adjusting a gas stove with the turn of a knob. After one fuel addition, the flames surged and the sugar on the pot's surface immediately scorched and discolored.

"This won't do. There's no way to control the temperature in this furnace. The heat is too hard to regulate." Wen Tong said dejectedly. In rustic sugar mills, the fire-tender's wages were second only to the sugar-boiling master. He wasn't being paid for nothing.

To regulate the heat uniformly, they couldn't use this kind of firewood stove. They needed fuel that burned steadily and released heat evenly—various gas fuels, charcoal, or coal briquettes could all achieve this. Or, like in factories, they could use steam heating. But none of these were available in Xuwen.

Wen Tong racked his brain for half a day and finally thought of the water bath method. By heating the vessel containing the white sugar liquid indirectly through a water bath, the heating temperature became even and there was no problem of scorching or discoloration. After several days of experimentation, he finally harvested his first batch of five kilograms of fine white sugar.

With white sugar, making rock candy was a simple matter. The traditional rock candy process required melting white sugar and adding chicken or duck egg whites as a clarifying agent. Wen Tong felt this was too costly. The so-called egg whites were just protein after all. He decided to use soy milk as a substitute. Wen Tong simply had a mill built on the estate and instructed a migrant who had previously made tofu to produce tofu daily, both to meet the workers' needs and to have soy milk readily available.

After clarifying with soy milk, freshly cut bamboo was split into strips of various sizes and placed in the sugar liquid. The sugar liquid would crystallize around the bamboo strips, slowly forming large pieces of rock candy. When harvesting, they only had to smash the rock candy and pull out the bamboo strips. This method had been in use since the Song Dynasty.

"The look is quite nice—" This rock candy, though not as pure as the single-crystal rock candy of later generations, was quite pure nonetheless. Selling it should make it a hot commodity.

The next step was to scale up white sugar production. Wen Tong had people order the pots and vessels for water bath processing. Meanwhile, he hired craftsmen to build a new sugar-making workshop by the river specifically for refining white sugar. To ensure the cleanliness and quality of the white sugar, high standards were implemented in the construction of the building.

The white sugar workshop was built according to modern factory specifications. Though wooden beams and columns were used, the entire building was brick and tile, with no thatch or sugarcane leaves covering the roof. The windows were large for good lighting—to avoid attracting too much attention, they were covered with paper rather than the planned glass. The workshop floor was paved with square bricks and had covered drainage ditches with grates for easy cleaning. Fifteen sugar-boiling stations were arranged in a row, which was space-saving and convenient for operation. The fire-stoking and ventilation openings were all set outside under a covered veranda—this allowed operation during rain and also prevented the indoor air and floors from being polluted by having fire openings inside.

All the equipment was newly made. Wen Tong also had several wells dug by the river, avoiding the more polluted river water for direct use. He spent lavishly to build a warehouse also entirely of brick and tile, specifically for storing sugar products. In addition to white sugar and brown sugar, there was a lot of molasses. Liao Dahua had many large vats custom-made at a local pottery workshop specifically to store this stuff—though he had no idea what Shopkeeper Wen planned to do with it.

The workers in the new sugar factory were all selected from among the migrants. Wen Tong personally trained them in all the operational procedures and established a complete set of production rules and regulations.

"Wen Qing!" Wen Tong said. "From now on, all management of the South China Sugar Factory is entirely your responsibility!"

In truth, both Wen Tong and Chang Shide were worried about entrusting such work to a servant. But they had no choice. Apart from these two servant boys, very few of the migrants were literate.

"Yes, thank you for your patronage, Master!" Wen Qing gave a deep bow. "This humble one will do my utmost!"

"I have a complete set of production rules and procedures here. You must supervise them to carry everything out exactly according to the system. No private modifications are allowed. If the workers have any ideas, you can relay them to me on their behalf, and I'll naturally consider them."

"Yes, Master!"

"Even if I walk into the workshop and see a single grain of sugar on the floor, I'll hold you accountable!" Wen Tong assumed the posture of a stern master.

Wen Qing looked at him uneasily. How had this usually affable master suddenly become so severe?

"Yes, this humble one understands. I won't break a single rule."

"Go on then. Take your workers and learn the regulations. Everyone must have them memorized within three days. Anyone who can't recite them won't get meat on the weekend."

"Then they'll memorize them even if it kills them." Wen Qing laughed.

"Hmph," Wen Tong's face finally showed a hint of a smile. Of the two servant boys, he preferred Wen Qing. Though he was a bit lacking in anticipating his master's needs, he seemed more reliable as a person. "You need to study hard yourself too. Have you been reading the book I gave you every day?"

The book Wen Tong had given him was a *Training Manual for Indigenous Industrial and Commercial Management Cadres*, jointly compiled by Wu De's Civil Affairs Committee and the Intelligence Archive Committee. It was based on several months of accumulated experience, combined with ancient and modern industrial and commercial management systems. It covered basic management models, how to calculate workloads, wage and benefit calculations, welfare standards, guidance on handling accidents and emergencies, and more. Like the *Handbook for Civil Affairs Administration and Organization*, it was part of the *Indigenous Work Series*, currently still in the "Request for Comments" edition stage.

"This humble one studies it hard every night. There are some parts I don't understand—I'll need to ask the Master for instruction."

"Anything you don't understand, you can come ask at any time in the evening." Wen Tong said earnestly. "You're a servant by birth. Though you know a few characters, how would those workers readily obey you? Only by having real skills will you have authority. You can't rely solely on the master's power to suppress them."

"Yes! This humble one thanks the Master for his teaching."

After sending Wen Qing off, Wen Xiu came over with a tea tray:

"Master has worked hard. Please have some tea." After learning that neither of these shopkeepers was interested in "the southern wind," and seeing that the relatively honest-looking Wen Qing had recently been favored, Wen Xiu knew he had to change his approach. He put away the coquettish manner that used to slip out constantly, and appeared much more dignified.

"Mm. Where is Master Chang?"

"He went to Hai'an Street."

Hai'an Street was Leizhou's sugar export port. Though not a county seat, it was more prosperous than the county capital Haikang. There were over thirty sugar trading houses on the street alone. The first time Wen Tong visited, he was truly impressed by its grandeur—after seeing enough poverty and desolation in Lingao, arriving at such a flourishing Great Ming commercial center was a shock no less intense than a Lingao villager visiting Dongmen Market.

Even a small place like Hai'an Street was this bustling and prosperous. What level of flourishing would Suzhou, Yangzhou, or Guangzhou—those great trade hubs—reach?

Wen Tong was somewhat surprised. Though Hai'an Street was only about ten kilometers away, they usually informed each other before going far. Had he snuck off to find women? Wen Tong immediately thought: Hai'an Street, with its gathering of merchants and thriving markets, was always a good place for brothels to do business.

"So he did go hunting for wild game!" Wen Tong gnashed his teeth: Old Chang, you're really not much of a brother. You could at least have told me about something like this and we could have gone to have fun together. Now he'd gone off with Liao Dahua, and Wen Tong didn't dare go out casually anymore. He could only fume silently and went to teach the worker training class: teaching them three hundred basic simplified characters, simple math, and statistics. Once the sugar factory's scale expanded, these workers could be promoted to management positions.

While Wen Tong was gnashing his teeth in abandonment, cursing at a particularly dim worker-student, Chang Shide was being accompanied by Liao Dahua as they strolled through Hai'an Street. Their destination: the slave market.

Chang Shide had originally planned to go straight to a brothel to take care of his needs. As for the threat of sexually transmitted diseases, he was prepared—he'd stuffed several boxes of Durex in his luggage. But after being introduced by Liao Dahua to several so-called high-end brothels and asking about the pricing, he became reluctant. These brothels had decent facilities and the women were passable even by modern standards. But there were too many pretentious rituals—first hosting tea, then listening to music and drinking wine, and even after all this, they couldn't get to work immediately. They had to come back two or three times before they could get near the bed. This was way too much trouble. Even "high-end clubs" in another spacetime didn't have procedures this complicated.

What Chang Shide didn't know was that high-end brothels in this spacetime also served a social function. Dignitaries, gentlemen, wealthy merchants, and tycoons came here primarily for socializing and to satisfy their cultural needs. The higher the class of courtesan, the more she sat and discussed philosophy rather than performing bedroom techniques.

Seeing that the Master didn't seem interested in this, Liao Dahua guessed what he was thinking. These sea merchants, having drifted on the ocean for so long, naturally couldn't wait for all this foreplay. So he led him toward the back alleys—where there were more practical "private establishments."

However, after observing the makeup of the women soliciting customers at the doors and catching the smell drifting from a distance, Chang Shide once again concluded that if he wanted women in this world, it was best to raise them himself. Though Liao Dahua specifically recommended several places where the women were supposedly particularly skilled in the arts of love, Chang Shide declined, saying he'd rather keep a few of his own.

Liao Dahua knew these women didn't meet his standards. Thinking that Australians all seemed to have a hygiene obsession and probably found prostitutes unclean, and hearing that he wanted to keep his own, he led him to the slave market.

The so-called slave market was just an open lot. A few slave traders sat in nearby thatched sheds drinking tea and chatting. These were the ones selling higher-end merchandise. If anyone showed interest, they would take the customer to a nearby room to look at the goods—mostly young women, though there were also boys who could serve as catamites. The prices were naturally not small. Others were actually selling themselves, with grass tags stuck in their hair, at low prices.

Chang Shide walked around. He looked at plenty of the slave traders' goods and the self-sellers. He felt none of them suited him. The traders' merchandise was naturally cleaned up and presentable, and the looks were passable, but the asking prices were way too high. Even eleven- or twelve-year-old girls cost fifty taels. Chang Shide had no interest in raising lolis, nor in lolis themselves. Besides, he didn't have that much silver—though he'd accumulated tens of thousands of work points.

Seeing the displeasure on Master Chang's face, Liao Dahua knew none of them were to his liking. Unable to figure out his thoughts, he just followed along.

After another circuit, suddenly a new stall appeared. Several runners from the yamen stood there, and five or six women of various ages sat or knelt on the ground. The oldest was over thirty, the youngest only twelve or thirteen. Though they were disheveled and dirty with dark skin, their nutritional condition looked fairly good. Strangely, no one was going over to ask. He had Liao Dahua go inquire.
