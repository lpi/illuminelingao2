# Chapter 1661 - The Little Three Gorges

Suo Pu was secretly delighted. Guangdong had never been able to achieve grain self-sufficiency. He had originally planned to procure grain from Guangxi, but he had no idea how much could actually be shipped. Now it seemed that not only could Guangxi export grain, but in substantial quantities as well. As for salt, it was already a key pillar of the Council of Elders' economy. Once Guangdong was occupied, all its salt fields would fall into the Council's hands. There would be no shortage of supply.

He nodded involuntarily and uttered a single "Good." His excitement was palpable.

Chen Hongyi saw the faint smile on his face and sensed his evident pleasure, though he had no idea which remark had pleased the man. He simply smiled along.

Suo Pu then asked many more questions about shipping. His manner was amiable, and the conversation flowed easily. Chen Hongyi spoke freely of everything he knew. They talked until deep into the night. When the watchman's drum on the tower struck the third watch, Suo Pu finally realized how late it had grown and had Lin Ming escort Manager Chen off the boat.

As Chen Hongyi was leaving, he couldn't help asking Lin Ming: "Who is that lord?"

Lin Ming didn't answer, only said: "Old Chen, you've won the grand prize." With that, he smiled and said no more.

Chen Hongyi shivered, went home, and lay awake for half the night—the word "Crown Prince" even flashed through his mind.

The next morning, the boat continued upstream, entering Zhaoqing Prefecture territory. Here the river surface was still relatively wide. Though rowing against the current with oars and sculls, catching the wind when it came, they could manage to make progress. After several days, mountains began to rise on both banks, the current grew swift, and navigation became increasingly difficult. From time to time, they had to resort to pulling the boat by rope to make headway.

This day, the boat entered Antelope Gorge—the location of the so-called "Little Three Gorges of the West River." This was also the crucial passage between Zhaoqing and Sanshui. From here onward, travelers left the broad Pearl River Delta behind and entered the mountainous region of western Guangdong.

At the entrance to Antelope Gorge, there were mountain temples on both the north and south banks. The two temples stood facing each other across the river, and monks would call to one another across the water, their voices echoing through the gorge—quite a charming scene.

When night fell, fishing boats would moor in the river forks for the night. There was a refined pleasure in the river wind, the fishing lanterns, and the midnight temple bells. This was why, through the ages, literary figures traveling to and from Zhaoqing considered it a must-see destination.

The strategic importance of this location made it a chokepoint for entering the Pearl River Delta. During the Qing dynasty, a customs station had been established here. The Guangxi warlords had also built artillery batteries here to command the river.

If the Ming forces of Guangdong or Guangxi wished to prevent the Fubo Army from advancing west into Guangxi, the Little Three Gorges of Zhaoqing would inevitably be their chosen defensive line. But what means could they employ? If they used artillery, placing Red Barbarian cannons on both banks could indeed blockade the river—but it couldn't withstand the Fubo Army's bombardment and marine landing assaults. As for sinking boats to obstruct the waterway, the water here was too deep for that.

Among the Little Three Gorges of the West River, Antelope Gorge had the highest mountains and deepest waters. It was formed by Antelope Mountain and Lanke Mountain flanking the West River. Lanke Mountain's main peak, Lanke Summit, rose to an elevation of 904 meters, with ridge upon ridge and strange, jagged rocks. Antelope Mountain's main peak, Dragon Gate Summit, reached 615 meters, its steep slopes pressing right against the riverbank. The undulating green mountain ranges wound their way down into the gorge, renowned as the most precipitous, extraordinary, majestic, and beautiful among the Three Banyan Gorge and Dading Gorge.

The moment the boat entered the gorge, the river surface suddenly narrowed—from nearly a thousand meters to barely over three hundred. The current was fierce, and the passage extremely perilous. Suo Pu watched the boat crawl along at a snail's pace. He observed the trackers climbing the mountains to haul the tow ropes, their backs bent nearly parallel to the ground, step by step clutching at trees, inching along the plank path on the sheer cliffs. He couldn't help feeling anxious: this stretch of Antelope Gorge was less than ten kilometers by water, yet traveling upstream would take three days.

Because they were an "official boat," over a dozen civilian vessels had joined them for the upstream journey. Due to their heavy loads, the civilian boats moved even more slowly—Suo Pu estimated they would need at least four or five days to complete the passage.

"Who would have thought that such a vital transportation route would have virtually no road construction? What exactly do the local authorities and people do for a living?" Kang Mingsi said, watching the trackers struggle along the tow path with their bodies nearly horizontal to the ground.

"You're being unfair to them," Suo Pu said, watching the trackers on the rocky shoals straining forward as they chanted their work songs. "The plank roads through the West River's Three Gorges only began in the Ming dynasty. Originally, there were no roads at all here. It was only through several Ming-era projects to carve paths and build bridges that something barely passable was created. Before that, the trackers could only haul ropes along the cliff faces halfway up the mountains..."

Kang Mingsi was astounded. Hauling ropes on terrain like this? Just climbing up without falling would be an achievement...

"This was a project led by Chen Yilong of Gaoyao and was only completed in the late Wanli era," Lin Ming hastened to add. "It's called the 'Gorge Mountain Dry Road.' It was extremely difficult to build. Ordinarily, only trackers use it."

Kang Mingsi gazed at the crude paths and bridges appearing intermittently among the sheer cliffs. His understanding of "the low level of productivity in ancient societies" became far more direct.

"The water here is very deep. A three-thousand-ton steamship could reach Zhaoqing without any difficulty," Suo Pu said. "It's just that the shoals downstream would all need to be dredged."

"The engineering scale would be enormous," Kang Mingsi said. Though he wasn't an engineer, as a combat logistics staff officer he had considerable ability to assess workloads. "The army couldn't handle it alone. The Executive Committee would have to organize the manpower and resources..."

"Of course. That's why we need to make more use of local shipping resources. They know the waterways well," Suo Pu said. "The only problem is how slow the upstream travel is..."

"If only we had diesel engines—we could convert the local boats to motor-sail vessels," Kang Mingsi said. "Those small steam engines we have now are just too slow, and they need their own coal supply..."

Suo Pu nodded. The power issue was indeed hampering their grand "shallow-water fleet" construction. Even the steam-powered *sanfa* boats, whose manufacturing and operation they had fully mastered, were really only practical for short trips. On longer voyages, coal and boiler water became major headaches—especially for extended travel through Guangdong's vast network of inland waterways.

The inland fleet plans that the Industrial Sector had proposed looked beautiful on paper, but in reality, he suspected that apart from the shallow-water tugboats and gunboats, the other schemes might not be viable—power was the Achilles' heel.

With the slow upstream progress, there was nothing to do but wait patiently. This region was utterly different from the rich, densely populated Pearl River Delta—here there were towering mountains, peaks and ridges, and dense forests. At night, when they could no longer travel upstream, they had to moor and wait. From time to time, they could hear gibbons hooting and tigers roaring on both banks. One night, they even heard an extremely harrowing scream for help—absolutely chilling.

River pirates were extremely numerous here. Small bands of pirates in little boats lurked among the riverbanks and forks. They occasionally saw boats that had been plundered along the way. Suo Pu ordered heightened vigilance.

Though they were an "official boat" and flew the Qiwei banner, unfamiliar pirates still eyed them from time to time. Fortunately, these pirates were too weak and isolated, and seeing their tight security and not knowing the true strength aboard the official boat, they dared not attack rashly.

Both banks were mountainous, and upstream boats had to be hauled slowly by trackers—no wonder this was a hunting ground for pirates. On the Yangtze, the most pirate-infested stretch was similarly the Three Gorges waterway from Yichang to Chongqing.

It seemed the situation in Guangdong would be rather troublesome. The social conditions they would face here were a hundred times more complex than on Hainan Island. Take these endless mountains on both banks of the Little Three Gorges—even in the twenty-first century, they could serve as "wilderness camping" destinations. Not to mention the seventeenth century, when development was even more limited, and apparently there were still South China tigers in these mountains...

At last they traveled without incident. The salt boat labored upstream, finally entering Dading Gorge. Here the gorge opened up, the river widened, and the current slowed. They were now approaching Zhaoqing Prefecture City, where water patrol boats were active, and the waterway was considerably more peaceful. The boat dropped anchor at the Zhaoqing Prefecture dock to purchase some fresh vegetables.

"We'll rest in Zhaoqing for a few days," Suo Pu ordered. The grueling passage through Antelope Gorge had exhausted both the boatmen and the escorts. Ahead lay Three Banyan Gorge—though not as precipitous as Antelope Gorge, it was fifty-five kilometers long. Both the complex hydrology and the social environment would require ample energy to navigate. Moreover, they needed time to gather intelligence on the Ming forces in Zhaoqing.

Zhaoqing was the seat of the Ming Governor-General of Liang-Guang. The current Governor-General was none other than the famous pacifier Xiong Wencai. However, because the Council of Elders' Navy had raided Xiamen and killed Zheng Zhilong, effectively destroying the Zheng network, and had subsequently forced Liu Xiang's group to retreat to the Chaoshan region where they eventually surrendered under internal and external pressure, Xiong Wencai's achievement of "pacifying Zheng Zhilong and tranquilizing the coastal region" was far less illustrious than it had been in history. Of course, this didn't stop him from claiming credit for the destruction of the Liu Xiang group, which had caused a minor dispute with the Fujian Governor Zou Weilian. In the end, the credit in the official reports was divided sixty-forty.

Given his usual style, the Executive Committee was surprised that he hadn't sent an envoy to "pacify" them. Originally, everyone had thought this was inevitable. There had even been quite heated discussions in the Council of Elders about whether to "accept pacification" and, if so, what terms to demand. But no pacification envoy ever appeared—greatly exceeding the expectations of both the Executive Committee and the Transmigrators.

The External Intelligence Bureau's informant in the Governor-General's Yamen was too low-ranking to access Xiong Wencai's inner circle and could not understand his decision-making process. However, judging from his governance over the past three years, his main focus seemed to be "cleaning up the mess" left by the Guangdong military.

The Chengmai Campaign and the subsequent Pearl River Estuary Campaign had nearly destroyed all of Guangdong's Ming field forces. Apart from the hopelessly corrupt garrison troops, the main fighting force—the battalion soldiers—had been virtually annihilated. Guangdong was left with only the Southern Guangdong Vice-Commander and the Anti-Yao Task Force's troops still intact. Xiong Wencai had recruited refugees, conscripted new soldiers, and rebuilt the naval forces that had been wiped out in the Pearl River estuary... In short, all his work had been consistent with a Governor-General's proper duties.

The External Intelligence Bureau speculated that Xiong Wencai would not discuss pacification with the Council of Elders until he had reorganized Guangdong's defenses—after all, even pacification required leverage.

"What a pity, Governor Xiong—this achievement won't be yours," Suo Pu thought to himself as he sat in the forward cabin, gazing out at the dark river.

Suo Pu knew that Zhaoqing had few troops. The only forces that could be called an "army" were the Governor-General's Central Army Battalion and a small naval patrol on the West River. For the well-equipped Marines and river gunboats, this was no obstacle at all.

*Note: In fact, the Governor-General of Liang-Guang was stationed in Guangzhou at this time. Throughout the Ming dynasty, the Governor-General had been based in Zhaoqing except for a few years in the early-to-mid Chongzhen reign when he was in Guangzhou. For the purposes of the plot, he is depicted here as still being in Zhaoqing.*
