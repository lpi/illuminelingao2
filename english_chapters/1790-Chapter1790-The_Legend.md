# Chapter 1790 - The Legend

The large amount of blood left at the dump site also proved this. Not only that, the remaining bloodstains proved the time between the murder and the dumping was very short.

A person's blood volume is limited; head decapitation leads to massive blood loss immediately. To transport it immediately and still leave behind much blood at the dump site indicated the victim had been beheaded very recently, and the distance from the crime scene to the dump site was extremely short. The murder scene should be within a very small radius centered on the mouth of East Branch Alley 7.

The patrolmen who discovered the corpse were moving from south to north, heading towards the culprit, so the scene should be on the road segment north of East Branch Alley 7.

Following this line of thought, he looked north. Apart from West Branch Alley 11 which he had just searched, the section directly north was ordinary. Besides a few shops on both sides, it was all residential facades. The residents in this area were mostly middle-class, with neat facades. Since it was late May or early June, households had their main doors wide open, with only the slatted outer gates closed. Just looking at it, he couldn't see anything suspicious.

Li Zhenguo walked another round along the probable corpse transport route he deduced, hoping to find more blood traces—since massive bloodstains were found at the dump site, it meant the wrapping wasn't waterproof. Blood surely would have dripped during transport, and not in small amounts.

However, this walk yielded none of the discoveries he anticipated. This deviated too far from his deduction. He decided to conduct house-to-house visits in this section himself to see if there were any suspicious circumstances. He instructed Li Ziyu to fetch the Tithing Head of this section.

This man was surnamed Xie, in his forties, a small merchant. His business was small—in his own words, "trade where water doesn't cover the instep." Superficially he dealt in seedlings, but actually, he trafficked tobacco: buying from farmers and reselling. Since the Chongzhen Emperor ascended the throne, this trade had become illegal; strictly speaking, getting caught meant losing one's head. Shopkeeper Xie dared to do this naturally because he had confidence. He had broad associations and friendships with people of all walks of life, so his business had always been peaceful.

After the Senatorial Council entered the city, theoretically, tobacco became a monopoly good. However, the Monopoly Bureau currently had no power to control tobacco supply and distribution. Small merchants like him who connected urban and rural areas were actually important suppliers for the bureau's cigarette enterprises. So his life was quite comfortable.

Li Ziyu said this was easy; no need to go to his house. He drank tea every morning; finding him at his usual tea house would work.

As the patrolman of this precinct, he often interacted with Baojia heads and team leaders and knew their habits well. Fortunately, the tea house Shopkeeper Xie frequented was on this very street, saving the trouble of opening gates.

The tea house Shopkeeper Xie frequented was small but had two floors. Many tea guests sat in the ground floor hall. Li Ziyu went in for a round but didn't see him. A waiter came over to greet him: "Officer Li! What brings you here? Tea or official business?"

To facilitate work, the three of them had changed into plain clothes at the station. But the waiter still recognized Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui.

Li Ziyu said, "Official business. Shopkeeper Xie didn't come today?"

The waiter said Shopkeeper Xie indeed hadn't arrived yet—he had been called to the police station early in the morning, presumably for official business. "Would the three of you like to find a seat and have some tea and dim sum first?"

The waiter said Shopkeeper Xie usually sat upstairs. The three went up together and chose a table in a corner. They ordered a pot of tea. Li Zhenguo had been running around all night and was starving. Seeing the two patrolmen also looking exhausted, he immediately said, "Let's have tea too. Fill our stomachs first."

Li Ziyu was used to consumption and enjoyment in the past, but recently, being short of money, he hadn't had morning tea in a long time. However, the other party was a superior from the Municipal Bureau. According to officialdom rules, not actively offering to treat was very rude. Now that the other party proposed it, Li Ziyu would eventually have to rush to pay the bill to be "sensible"—but he had no money.

Zhao Gui chuckled foolishly. "Good, good. I'm hungry." This made Li Ziyu want to kick him.

Seeing Li Ziyu's expression change, Li Zhenguo knew he had misunderstood. He laughed, "I'm treating for this tea! Consider it a token of our acquaintance; I'll need your help in official matters later."

Li Ziyu hurriedly said, "Master Li... what are you saying? You came here to handle a case; how can there be a reason for you to treat..."

Li Zhenguo was of bodyguard origin and judged people accurately. He could see Li Ziyu was a young master from a propertied family, spoiled growing up. Becoming a patrolman was likely a last resort after family misfortune. This gave them some common ground. He felt a bit closer and said pleasantly, "You're a new patrolman, right? No need to learn Old Gao's ways—he can't change. Just call me Comrade. What's treating you to tea? You're new and haven't been graded yet; how can someone without wages treat? I at least have some salary; treating you to tea once isn't hard."

Since he said so, Li Ziyu relaxed. Li Zhenguo ordered several baskets of dim sum. The three ate and waited for Shopkeeper Xie, incidentally listening to the tea guests' chat. This was called "Listening to Leaks"—a primary method for gaining information, whether for constables solving cases or bodyguards finding kidnap victims.

The tea guests upstairs were almost entirely chatting about the headless corpse found last night, but they revealed no new information.

Li Zhenguo finished his preserved egg porridge and was considering going to Team Leader Xie's house to see if he returned, when footsteps sounded on the stairs. A sturdy man in his thirties rushed up like the wind. Judging by his clothes, he was a manual laborer with decent family circumstances. He was looking for a suitable seat when a guest at a window table called out: "Old Cui, sit here! Tea is ready, just add a bowl."

Evidently, this Old Cui was very popular among the tea guests, likely because he had many rumors. As soon as he sat down, a tablemate poured tea into his bowl and asked, "Old Cui. Where have you been running lately? Haven't seen you for days. Any news to tell us?"

"News? Isn't the biggest news the headless corpse found on the street last night?"

"They say headless, but they haven't found the body yet. Two corpse-handlers fished in the river for half a day and caught nothing!"

"I think the patrolmen were possessed..."

Mentioning possession and supernatural things easily sparked conversation. People discussed animatedly: some said possessed, some said ghost-walls (getting lost in circles), others said someone used sorcery to move the corpse.

At this moment, the waiter brought pig's blood porridge and fried crisp crackers. Old Cui picked up a cracker and said, "Speaking of ghosts and hauntings, East Alley 7 is the most fitting place on Scissors Lane. It would be abnormal if it *didn't* have ghosts."

An old man said, "Old Cui, you're talking nonsense (乱噏廿四). East Alley 7 is just a backstreet alley; what's strange about it? I've lived on this street all my life and never heard of ghosts there."

The tea guests were all old residents and knew the old man spoke the truth, so they accused Old Cui of bragging.

Old Cui wasn't rushed. He slowly ate his cracker, then said, "Do you know that alley is the back alley for which house?"

Everyone paused, thinking. The old man suddenly slapped the table, "Could it be Zhenbo Garden?"

Old Cui didn't speak, just nodded while drinking porridge. The table of guests erupted in discussion.

When Li Ziyu was assigned to the station, he had roughly toured the precinct. He knew the place and had heard the story. Zhenbo Garden was originally a "Golden House" built by a wealthy city merchant. It was specifically to house a famous courtesan he redeemed from Jiangnan at a high price. After a few years, the merchant inevitably favored the new and tired of the old, visiting less often. When going out, the courtesan met a scholar and fell in love at first sight, carrying on a secret affair. Over time, they planned to elope.

There is no wall in the world that doesn't leak wind. Hearing of this, the merchant calmly arranged a "catch." The scholar usually entered and left through the small back garden door with a maid's help. That night, amidst wind and rain, he was seized as soon as he entered. Under clubs and fists, he immediately confessed the affair.

The merchant executed family law that night, beating the two maids who delivered messages to death with staves. He planned to send the scholar to the officials at dawn, strip him of his degree, and humiliate him thoroughly. Unexpectedly, the guards were lax that night; the couple found a chance to escape and committed suicide together in the garden for love. From then on, legend had it the house became a haunted mansion. It was said the ghosts of the couple and the two beaten maids frequently haunted the garden. The merchant reportedly died from the vengeful spirits claiming his life. Afterward, no one dared live there.

Terrified, the merchant's family sold the garden at a low price to the adjacent Shaanxi-Shanxi Guild Hall.

When Li Ziyu started work, fifty or sixty years had passed. Although no one had seen the ghosts of Zhenbo Garden, the reputation of the haunted house remained loud. Ordinary people wouldn't step inside without reason.

Li Ziyu wasn't exactly a materialist, but ghosts and gods had no value for solving cases. Besides, the blood on the ground was real. As for Li Zhenguo, he was a bodyguard. Bodyguards often walked night roads and wild places; guarding courtyards and sitting in shops meant night activity. He had seen many strange things, but upheld the belief "A straight body doesn't fear a slanted shadow" and "A body of righteousness suppresses a hundred evils." He wasn't impressed by Old Cui's talk.

Hearing their chaotic discussion of old stories with no fresh content, Li Zhenguo was a bit disappointed. Suddenly he heard someone say: "Whether Zhenbo Garden is haunted is hard to say, but it's true that Widow Wang's house was haunted yesterday."
