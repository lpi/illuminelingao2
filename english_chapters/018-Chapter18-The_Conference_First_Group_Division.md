# Chapter 18: The Conference — First Group Division

From the start, Xiao Zishan had focused on the small coastal cities. After half a month of scouting, he finally leased a maritime militia training base in a certain county.

The base the Crossing Company rented was a training camp from the era of "all-people soldiers." After the military downsizing, it had sat empty for a long time. Located in hilly terrain with only a small training harbor for sea access, it was nearly surrounded by mountains—inconvenient and off the beaten path. The sole road, poorly maintained due to lack of importance, was in rough shape.

The location was remote, with few passersby—easy to stay under the radar. The barracks, warehouses, and drill grounds were somewhat dilapidated but basically complete. The county People's Armed Forces Department, finding no takers for such a poor site, asked for minimal rent. The only condition was that they continue employing the two retired custodians, which Xiao Zishan readily agreed to. The two took turns staying in the gatehouse week by week; apart from minding the gate and sweeping up, they bothered with nothing else.

First, they hired a cleaning company to scour the base inside and out, then a renovation company to fix broken windows, clogged pipes, and the like. Since the site was still a reserve barracks under the Armed Forces Department, the facilities were reasonably complete. Once cleaned up and supplemented with a few things, it was ready for occupancy.

On a certain day, the Crossing Company relocated here. As for the Guangzhou office, Wen Desi kept it—after all, the company's registered address was there.

With a base established, the first cadre of key personnel began reporting in. These were individuals whom Wen Desi had personally selected after prolonged contact with the pool of recruits. Most were specialists in various fields.

Many arrived full of doubt; quite a few assumed outright that this was a scam.

When they beheld stacks of RMB, Ming-dynasty porcelain, and that strangely glimmering wormhole, they realized it was real.

Some fled immediately—unable to accept it. This was too insane.

Some pondered for a few days, then left.

Some erupted with irrepressible excitement, throwing themselves fervently into the cause.

Some took it in stride—simply registered, settled in, and joined the work.

In this way, the team required by a crossing organization was preliminarily assembled.

For convenience of management and division of labor, the Committee decided to convene all personnel currently on-site for a plenary meeting to restructure the crossing organization.

What form of government to adopt after the crossing remained undiscussable for now—not all participants had arrived, and it was inappropriate to establish a power structure before a full assembly could debate it. Thus the meeting's purpose was limited to setting up an administrative framework.

The meeting was held in the base's large conference room—spacious enough to accommodate the nearly fifty attendees. The tables and chairs were old but serviceable. Xiao Zishan found a stack of porcelain teacups in a cabinet, sparing them even disposable paper cups. The only addition was a whiteboard.

Xiao Zishan produced a voice recorder and tested it.

"I propose we take minutes by hand." A young woman stood up. "Transcribing from audio is miserable. I type fast with Wubi input—I can do it."

"And you are?"

Lately, dozens of unfamiliar faces had appeared; Xiao Zishan couldn't keep track. This woman was thin and small, not particularly pretty, but clearly limber—an athletic type.

"I'm Li Yiwo's girlfriend. My name is Li Yuanyuan. I used to be a secretary—taking meeting minutes is a piece of cake."

Xiao Zishan knew Li Yiwo—also trained in machining, a fanatical firearms enthusiast, a gun-buddy of Zhan Wuya's, the type who wouldn't fart all day. Xiao Zishan suspected his only reason for wanting to cross was to make guns without restriction.

This young woman had followed him here. "I'll follow you to the ends of the earth" apparently wasn't just talk. The thought made Xiao Zishan feel a twinge of sourness.

"All right—but let's keep the recorder on too."

Li Yuanyuan brought over a netbook, casually typed in the date and time, then turned to Xiao Zishan.

"Please begin."

Xiao Zishan cleared his throat.

"Although we all know each other, this is our first time gathering. Let me first announce the meeting rules.

"This meeting will discuss each agenda item in order. We may not stray off-topic before moving to the next item.

"The meeting may run long. If a discussion topic is outside your field or not of interest to you, you may leave. Exits are permitted after each agenda item concludes and before the next begins, or during breaks announced by the moderator.

"After each agenda item concludes, the moderator will ring a bell once, then wait three minutes before starting the new topic. Anyone wishing to re-enter must do so during this interval.

"To speak, raise your hand and wait for the moderator's permission.

"Remarks must address the matter at hand and not comment on other speakers.

"That's all." Xiao Zishan surveyed the seated transmigrators, nodded with a genial smile. "Now let's ask Director Wen to first brief us on the current status of crossing preparations."

Director Wen stood up and coughed. A roomful of faces stared at him.

"Regarding the current state of the crossing, I'll start with an introduction."

He gave a simple overview of the wormhole's current condition, the crossing-trade situation, contacts with Ming-era people, and profits earned. The moment he finished, someone requested the floor.

"My name is Jin Keshou. I suggest Director Wen stop selling porcelain. I know a bit about the antiques world: it's quite insular and everyone knows everyone. Selling a few pieces now is fine, but if we keep offloading steadily, within days the whole province—even the whole country's circle—will know. That's very bad for our secrecy. We could end up alerting the cultural-relics authorities."

Wen Desi leaned forward, paying close attention—he didn't know much about the antiques world. "Then what do you suggest?"

"Medicinal materials." Jin Keshou said. "Many precious traditional Chinese medicines are extremely scarce now, with very high prices. For example: rhinoceros horn, natural ox bezoar, musk."

"Rhino horn is out—we'd definitely attract the Industry and Commerce Bureau," someone objected. "But rare spices might be worth considering."

"Good, suggestion accepted. We'll try it on the next trade run."

"The next agenda item is industry. Let's start with energy..." Xiao Zishan was saying when he noticed Ma Qianzhu raising his hand. "Yes?"

"Should we first establish the administrative structure and divide into specialized groups? That would make discussion more convenient."

"Mm, I agree," said Wang Luobin. "Otherwise there's no order."

"Then first, the Agriculture Group." A sturdy man rose. "I'm Wu Nanhai, graduate of ** Agricultural University. Food is the foundation of the nation—feeding ourselves is our top priority."

"Good. Agriculture Group." Xiao Zishan wrote the first group on the whiteboard.

"Industry Group!" "Transportation Group!" "Geology Department!" "Railway Ministry!" "Highway Bureau!" "Crossing Mobile!" "Aviation Committee!" "Military Group!" "Army Department!" "Navy Department!" "Urban Management!" "Cheka!" "Development and Reform Commission!"...

Seeing the group-naming devolve into trolling, Xiao Zishan had to rein in their surging enthusiasm:

"All right, all right. The groups are mainly for preparing the crossing. How to set up institutions after we establish a base is another matter. Let's not overcomplicate things." He smiled. "We haven't even crossed yet—no point playing the promotion ladder game."

Everyone laughed. After a while, they settled on the following groups:

**Industry, Agriculture, Construction, Energy, Communications, Athletics, IT, Intelligence & Documentation**—eight professional groups. In addition, two support groups were established: **General Affairs** and **Procurement**. General Affairs handled coordination, personnel contact, registration, and daily operations for all transmigrators and the organization. Procurement was responsible for acquiring equipment and supplies according to the shopping lists.

Each group elected its own leader; the group leaders formed a Provisional Executive Committee. They would hold a coordination meeting once a week to align operations between departments, with ad-hoc meetings as needed.

Wen Desi was unsurprisingly elected Chairman of the Executive Committee. Zhan Wuya initially nominated Wang Luobin for Industry Group leader, but Wang Luobin declined, saying he wasn't professional enough in machining. In the end, Zhan Wuya took the position.

Nobody wanted the General Affairs leadership. It was all eating, lodging, sanitation, personnel—tedious work. In an ordinary enterprise, there would at least be perks. But they were crossing in a year—any cash they saved would be so much wastepaper, all going back to the organization anyway.

Xiao Zishan gave Wen Desi a hint; Wen Desi then nominated him, and he secured the General Affairs leadership.

Xiao Zishan's reasoning was simple: he had no specialized skill. During this preparation phase, technicians would inevitably gain prominence and speaking rights. Using this position to keep himself in the management layer was optimal. By the next reorganization, he would have sufficient political seniority.

However, to avoid suspicion, Xiao Zishan proposed that the Committee also establish a directly-subordinate Accounting Section to handle income, disbursement, and auditing of funds.

Once the groups were finalized, the room immediately filled with the clatter of chairs being dragged as everyone—without being told—sat down by group. The new group leaders surveyed their left and right, already feeling like leaders.

By contrast, General Affairs' roster was essentially an "army of wives." The first batch of arrivals were all technical cadres, so those under the General Affairs banner were the girlfriends and wives these cadres had brought—plus one mother, the mother of a certain female technician. As they say, a parent's love knows no bounds...

Xiao Zishan began to dread how he would get along with this army of wives. Even worse: they were all "other men's women." He silently reminded himself to be very careful to avoid scandal.
