# Chapter 18: The Conference — First Group Division

From the start, Xiao Zishan had focused on small coastal cities. After half a month of scouting, he finally leased a maritime militia training base in a certain county.

The base was a training camp from the "all-people soldiers" era. After military downsizing, it had sat empty for years. Located in hilly terrain with only a small training harbor for sea access, it was nearly surrounded by mountains—inconvenient and off the beaten path. The sole road, poorly maintained, was in rough shape.

The location was remote, with few passersby—easy to stay under the radar. The barracks, warehouses, and drill grounds were somewhat dilapidated but basically complete. The county People's Armed Forces Department, finding no takers, asked for minimal rent. The only condition was continuing to employ the two retired custodians, which Xiao Zishan readily agreed to. The two took turns staying in the gatehouse week by week; apart from minding the gate and sweeping up, they bothered with nothing else.

First, they hired a cleaning company to scour the base, then a renovation company to fix broken windows and clogged pipes. Since the site was still a reserve barracks, the facilities were reasonably complete. Once cleaned up, it was ready for occupancy.

On a certain day, the Crossing Company relocated here. Wen Desi kept the Guangzhou office—after all, the company's registered address was there.

With a base established, the first cadre of key personnel began reporting in. These were individuals Wen Desi had personally selected after prolonged contact. Most were specialists in various fields.

Many arrived full of doubt; quite a few assumed this was a scam.

When they beheld stacks of RMB, Ming-dynasty porcelain, and that strangely glimmering wormhole, they realized it was real.

Some fled immediately—unable to accept it. Too insane.

Some pondered a few days, then left.

Some erupted with irrepressible excitement, throwing themselves into the cause.

Some took it in stride—registered, settled in, and joined the work.

In this way, the team was preliminarily assembled.

For convenience of management, the Committee decided to convene all personnel for a plenary meeting to restructure the organization.

What form of government to adopt after the crossing remained undiscussable—not all participants had arrived, and establishing a power structure before a full assembly could debate it was inappropriate. The meeting's purpose was limited to setting up an administrative framework.

The meeting was held in the base's conference room—spacious enough for the nearly fifty attendees. The tables and chairs were old but serviceable. Xiao Zishan found porcelain teacups in a cabinet, sparing them disposable paper cups. The only addition was a whiteboard.

Xiao Zishan produced a voice recorder and tested it.

"I propose we take minutes by hand." A young woman stood up. "Transcribing from audio is miserable. I type fast with Wubi—I can do it."

"And you are?"

Lately, dozens of unfamiliar faces had appeared; Xiao Zishan couldn't keep track. This woman was thin and small, not particularly pretty, but clearly limber—an athletic type.

"I'm Li Yiwo's girlfriend. Li Yuanyuan. I used to be a secretary—meeting minutes are a piece of cake."

Xiao Zishan knew Li Yiwo—trained in machining, a fanatical firearms enthusiast, a gun-buddy of Zhan Wuya's, the type who wouldn't fart all day. Xiao Zishan suspected his only reason for wanting to cross was to make guns without restriction.

This young woman had followed him here. "I'll follow you to the ends of the earth" apparently wasn't just talk. The thought made Xiao Zishan feel a twinge of sourness.

"All right—but let's keep the recorder on too."

Li Yuanyuan brought over a netbook, typed in the date and time, then turned to him.

"Please begin."

Xiao Zishan cleared his throat.

"Although we know each other, this is our first gathering. Let me announce the meeting rules.

"We'll discuss each agenda item in order. No straying off-topic before moving to the next.

"The meeting may run long. If a topic is outside your field or not of interest, you may leave. Exits are permitted after each item concludes and before the next begins, or during announced breaks.

"After each item concludes, the moderator will ring a bell, then wait three minutes. Anyone wishing to re-enter must do so during this interval.

"To speak, raise your hand and wait for permission.

"Remarks must address the matter at hand, not comment on other speakers.

"That's all." Xiao Zishan surveyed the transmigrators and nodded. "Now let's ask Director Wen to brief us on crossing preparations."

Director Wen stood and coughed. A roomful of faces stared at him.

"Regarding the current state of the crossing, I'll start with an introduction."

He gave a simple overview of the wormhole's condition, the crossing-trade situation, contacts with Ming-era people, and profits earned. The moment he finished, someone requested the floor.

"I'm Jin Keshou. I suggest Director Wen stop selling porcelain. The antiques world is quite insular—everyone knows everyone. Selling a few pieces is fine, but if we keep offloading steadily, within days the whole province will know. Very bad for secrecy. We could alert the cultural-relics authorities."

Wen Desi leaned forward—he didn't know much about antiques. "Then what do you suggest?"

"Medicinal materials." Jin Keshou said. "Many precious traditional Chinese medicines are extremely scarce now, with high prices. Rhinoceros horn, natural ox bezoar, musk."

"Rhino horn is out—we'd attract the Industry and Commerce Bureau," someone objected. "But rare spices might work."

"Good, accepted. We'll try it next run."

"The next agenda item is industry. Let's start with energy..." Xiao Zishan was saying when Ma Qianzhu raised his hand. "Yes?"

"Should we first establish the administrative structure and divide into groups? That would make discussion more convenient."

"I agree," said Wang Luobin. "Otherwise there's no order."

"Then first, the Agriculture Group." A sturdy man rose. "I'm Wu Nanhai, graduate of ** Agricultural University. Food is the foundation of the nation—feeding ourselves is our top priority."

"Good. Agriculture Group." Xiao Zishan wrote it on the whiteboard.

"Industry Group!" "Transportation Group!" "Geology Department!" "Railway Ministry!" "Highway Bureau!" "Crossing Mobile!" "Aviation Committee!" "Military Group!" "Army Department!" "Navy Department!" "Urban Management!" "Cheka!" "Development and Reform Commission!"...

Seeing the naming devolve into trolling, Xiao Zishan had to rein in their enthusiasm:

"All right. The groups are for preparing the crossing. How to set up institutions after we establish a base is another matter. Let's not overcomplicate things." He smiled. "We haven't crossed yet—no point playing the promotion ladder game."

Everyone laughed. After a while, they settled on:

**Industry, Agriculture, Construction, Energy, Communications, Athletics, IT, Intelligence & Documentation**—eight professional groups. In addition, two support groups: **General Affairs** and **Procurement**. General Affairs handled coordination, personnel contact, registration, and daily operations. Procurement acquired equipment and supplies according to the shopping lists.

Each group elected its leader; the leaders formed a Provisional Executive Committee. They would meet weekly to align operations, with ad-hoc meetings as needed.

Wen Desi was unsurprisingly elected Chairman. Zhan Wuya initially nominated Wang Luobin for Industry Group leader, but Wang declined, saying he wasn't professional enough. Zhan Wuya took the position.

Nobody wanted General Affairs. It was all eating, lodging, sanitation, personnel—tedious work. In an ordinary enterprise, there would be perks. But they were crossing in a year—any saved cash would be wastepaper.

Xiao Zishan gave Wen Desi a hint; Wen Desi nominated him, and he secured the leadership.

Xiao Zishan's reasoning was simple: he had no specialized skill. During preparation, technicians would inevitably gain prominence. Using this position to keep himself in the management layer was optimal. By the next reorganization, he would have sufficient seniority.

However, to avoid suspicion, he proposed that the Committee also establish a directly-subordinate Accounting Section to handle income, disbursement, and auditing.

Once groups were finalized, the room filled with clattering chairs as everyone sat down by group. The new leaders surveyed their left and right, already feeling like leaders.

By contrast, General Affairs' roster was essentially an "army of wives." The first batch were all technical cadres, so those under General Affairs were the girlfriends and wives these cadres had brought—plus one mother, the mother of a female technician. A parent's love knows no bounds...

Xiao Zishan began to dread how he would get along with this army of wives. Even worse: they were all "other men's women." He silently reminded himself to be careful to avoid scandal.
