# Chapter 1350 - Trade Agreement

Watching the charging wild game and the warriors on galloping horses, listening to the thunderous hoofbeats and shouts, even though the prey wasn't humans, Huang Hua was still infected by the atmosphere of the battlefield. The scene of thousands chasing game was blood-stirring—truly a display of martial power! In the audience, he couldn't help but marvel at the might of the Eight Banners troops. The Manchu Qing cavalry were well-mounted and well-armored, their ferocity in "combat" evident even in a hunt. Their horsemanship was superb, turning on a dime in the chase, drawing their bows left and right with incredible accuracy.

Huang Taiji sat high on his horse, flanked by numerous Beiles, ministers, and Bayara guards, pointing and commenting on the hunt. Occasionally he even drew his own strong bow to shoot, hitting several large beasts to the cheers of the crowd.

Suddenly, a large wild boar burst out of the thicket, panicking at the encirclement and charging straight towards the Khan's yellow umbrella. The Bayara guards immediately moved to intercept, arrows flying like rain, but the beast, though bristling with arrows, charged madly and knocked over several guards. Before the others could surround it, it broke through the inner cordon and rushed towards Huang Taiji.

The crowd cried out in alarm. Huang Taiji, however, remained calm, drawing his sword to prepare for the charge.

"Fire!"

A clear command rang out. *Bang! Bang!* Two gunshots cracked in succession. The wild boar, mid-charge, suddenly stumbled as if hit by an invisible hammer, crashed to the ground, convulsed a few times, and breathed its last.

Smoke drifted from the muzzles of the revolvers held by two of Huang Hua's guards just outside the inner circle. They holstered their weapons with fluid precision, their faces expressionless.

The sudden gunshots had startled many horses, but Huang Taiji's mount was a battle-hardened steed that didn't flinch. He stared at the dead boar, then at the guards who had fired, a strange light in his eyes.

"Good weapons! Good men!" Huang Taiji praised loudly. "Reward them!"

This small episode served as a more effective demonstration than any words. The power and rapid fire of the revolvers, and the discipline of Huang Hua's guards, left a deep impression on the Manchu nobles.

The next day, negotiations began in earnest with officials from the Board of Revenue.

The location for trade was set at Duozhi Island in the Yalu River near Zhenjiang Fort. This was a compromise—Later Jin didn't want the "Great Australians" to penetrate deep into their territory, and Huang Hua needed a location accessible by ship. Duozhi Island was uninhabited and secure enough for both sides.

Trade would occur twice a year, once in spring and once in autumn.

The "Great Australia" side presented a detailed list of available goods: salt, sugar, cloth, ironware, tea, medicines, and of course, the highly coveted armor.

The Later Jin side provided their list: mostly furs (sable, fox, etc.), ginseng, pearls, deer antlers, and fungus. And, crucially, the agreed-upon "living mouths" and horses.

The toughest negotiation was over pricing.

The Later Jin officials were astute bargainers. For the armor, Huang Hua quoted 60 taels of silver for a standard infantry set and 150 taels for a refined officer's set. The Later Jin officials tried to slash the price, arguing their furs were undervalued.

"Your furs are indeed fine," Huang Hua countered, "but our armor saves lives. Can a piece of sable skin stop an arrow? Can a pearl deflect a blade?"

After rounds of haggling, the armor price was settled at 50 taels for standard and 130 for officer's sets—still a massive profit margin for the industrial production back in Lingao. The price for horses and "living mouths" was also pegged to fair market rates, with a slight premium since the Council was the buyer in need.

Specifically regarding the "living mouths," Huang Hua insisted on a mix of men and women, young and healthy. Huang Taiji had agreed in principle, viewing it as a way to get rid of the old and weak or rebellious captives, but Huang Hua's specifications ensured they wouldn't just dump useless mouths on them. The price was set at 10 taels per healthy adult male, 8 for a female, with adjustments for age and skills.

For the basic commodities like salt and cloth, prices were set slightly below the exorbitant black market rates Later Jin was currently paying to Shanxi merchants, making the deal attractive to them while still guaranteeing high profits for the Council.

One specific item Huang Hua pushed was iron pots. To the Mongols and Manchus, iron pots were strategic goods, heavily restricted by the Ming. The Council could mass-produce cast iron pots cheaply. Huang Hua proposed using these, along with tea and salt, to trade for horses from the Mongol tribes under Later Jin's influence. This was a win-win: Later Jin got the strategic supplies they needed to placate their Mongol allies, and the Council got the horses.

The final agreement was drafted in both Chinese and Manchu. It was a purely commercial treaty on the surface, but its implications were strategic.

Before leaving, Huang Hua presented a special gift to Huang Taiji privately: a high-quality, orchestrally-tuned music box and a set of exquisite glass mirrors for his harem. Huang Taiji was visibly pleased, promising that as long as the trade continued smoothly, "Great Australia" would be the most favored guest of Great Jin.

With the treaty signed, Huang Hua's mission was accomplished. He looked back at the imposing shape of Shenyang—or Shengjing—knowing that he had just opened a door that would change the history of Northeast Asia. The "Great Australia" influence had officially landed on the banks of the Yalu.
