# Chapter 17: The Old Worker

"Zishan, I see you've got the makings of a landlord." Wen Desi chuckled. "Some people have the air of a true king; you have the presence of a landed gentleman."

"Maybe it runs in my family. My dream has always been to have a big estate—plant vegetables, raise chickens, put up a grape trellis, set a rattan chair underneath, and slowly sip tea from a pot..."

"Sounds delightful. But couldn't you do that now?" Wen Desi drawled. "We've made a lot of money. That little dream of yours is nothing."

"Too bad the wormhole won't last forever." Xiao Zishan stretched his limbs. "This time I felt distinct energy fluctuations."

"If only it were Doraemon's Anywhere Door." Director Wen laughed.

Xiao Zishan grinned: "I wasn't finished. There would also be several cool beauties at my side, fanning me and peeling lychees. One mature woman, one imperious elder-sister type, one little *loli*..." He thought for a moment. "Actually, that loli Gao Lujie is fine stock."

"That girl," Wen Desi lounged on the sofa, peeling a lychee, "is definitely not Gao Qing's daughter."

"Mm, significant DNA discrepancy." Xiao Zishan began cataloging the stacks of bowls and porcelain. After each crossing, he was in charge of inventorying trade goods and proceeds. Engineer Wang had returned to his little machinery factory—his enthusiasm for work lately was astounding, to the point where Director Wen and Xiao Zishan were surprised. Not only did he work overtime every day, he came back still brimming with excitement.

"Her appearance has none of her father's features. There's slight resemblance to her brother. And that height."

"So Director Wen has taken a fancy to this long-legged little *loli*?"

"Even if I have, I'll have to set it aside. There's too much real work to do. Let's see what needs doing."

"Recruitment, of course."

After completing the third crossing-trade, they now controlled over twenty million yuan in cash. The conditions for material preparation had been met.

To recruit, the first task was selecting an appropriate staging point—a dedicated facility to receive those who would report in. Guangzhou was clearly not suitable. In Wen Desi's view, the location should be relatively remote, close to the future crossing point, with sufficient living facilities to accommodate several hundred people for food and lodging, plus a large outdoor space—ideally a drill ground.

"What do we need a drill ground for?" Xiao Zishan was puzzled.

"Physical exercise." Wen Desi glanced at his own arms and Xiao Zishan's belly. "At the very least, if we have to run for our lives, we should be able to outrun the natives of the Ming."

They split up three ways. Since Xiao Zishan had worked in sales and was familiar with the large and small coastal cities of Guangdong, scouting for a base fell to him. Wang Luobin would continue working at his machinery factory. Wen Desi would remain in Guangzhou to prepare for the next crossing-trade, manage the online discussion board, and identify professional talent. The first list of invitees had already been drafted.

The fourth person to join the committee did not come from the internet—somewhat unexpectedly.

That evening, Wen Desi had just finished checking the discussion board and was considering whom to contact next when Wang Luobin walked in, wearing an oil-stained work uniform. He plopped unceremoniously onto the sofa, face beaming with excitement.

"Engineer Wang, you've been coming to work beaming every day. What's the good news?" Wen Desi was curious.

"Director Wen, I want you to meet someone."

"Who?" Wen Desi was surprised. Wang was normally taciturn and not very sociable; he wasn't local either. Why would he suddenly want to introduce someone?

"My boss." Seeing Wen Desi's confusion, he added: "The boss of the factory where I work. Surname Zhan."

"Hm?"

"I told him about the crossing—"

"What?!" Wen Desi nearly jumped up.

"Old Wen, don't get excited, don't get excited," Wang Luobin said. "His name is Zhan Wuya. He's a technician, very skilled—lathe, planing, milling, drilling—he knows it all..."

"All right, all right, get to the point. He didn't think you were mentally ill or a con artist?"

"No—in fact, he wants to join."

"Join?" Wen Desi's mind didn't quite register. He repeated: "He wants to go too?"

"Right. That day when we were working together on a hand-cranked Gatling gun—"

"What?!" This time Wen Desi really did jump up. "Engineer Wang!!"

He quickly lowered his voice—even though the room's soundproofing was excellent.

"Are you insane! Manufacturing illegal guns is a prison sentence!"

"It's fine—we'll have to make guns anyway once we're in the Ming. Might as well practice." Wang Luobin looked utterly nonchalant. "We're machinists. Making a couple of guns is nothing. Someone's even knocked off a Japanese Type 92 infantry gun."

"Forget the Type 92 for now—what's the deal with this boss of yours?"

"He's very impressed with your approach. Says to leave machining to him. He's planning to bring his whole factory over."

Zhan Wuya was not the grimy old worker Wen Desi had imagined. He appeared to be just over thirty, wearing a T-shirt, his hair neatly combed. Only his large, rough-skinned hands revealed his occupation.

Because of his work, Director Wen often dealt with small external-processing shops like this. The two quickly launched into a deep discussion of machining technology, and their common ground rapidly broke down barriers. Before long, they were chatting freely.

"Director Wen, let me put it this way: in the machining trade, there's nothing we can't make." Zhan Wuya's speech was full of working-class pride. "Take my little factory—I won't claim we can make tanks, but mortars and machine guns are a piece of cake. When I was at trade school..."

He launched into a five-minute account of how he had built a mortar for his graduation project. Then he and Wang Luobin dove into discussing gun-making—it later emerged that the reason Wang Luobin and Boss Zhan had bonded so quickly was that both were fanatical firearms enthusiasts. Wen Desi hastily cut off their animated discussion before anyone overhearing might think they were an illegal-weapons gang in the making.

Zhan Wuya introduced his factory's main equipment: two shearing machines, one 80-ton bending machine, one 63-ton punch and one 5-ton punch, two lathes, one planer, one radial drilling press, three bench drills, one cutter, five arc welders, one spot welder, one band saw, one overhead crane, one grinder, two grinding wheels, one oxy-fuel welding set, one air compressor, and one paint-baking facility.

"Actually, if you're willing to rough it, the Big Three machines are sufficient." Zhan Wuya said. "When I was a student, I liked reading memoirs of the old defense-industry workers. Those were real masters—a lathe and a vise, and they could make guns, artillery, machine tools." He thought for a moment. "But materials are critical. Without good materials, whatever you make will be compromised—some things can't even be machined. Especially: you must have the right steel."

Wang Luobin said: "We plan to build a metallurgical industry—iron smelting, steelmaking."

"That's beyond my expertise. If you can solve the materials problem, machine tools can manufacture all kinds of specialized equipment. The biggest advantage is that they can self-replicate; production capacity can keep expanding, absorbing wear and tear. Sustainable development, you might say."

"Indeed—no matter how much you stockpile, eventually you'll run out."

"Right. But some things you still have to bring in quantity—like cutting tools, which are usually alloy steel or sintered ceramic. We won't be able to make those at first. Same with grinding wheels; they need special materials and sintering techniques. Also, lubricants—I don't know if substitutes will work, and there are quite a few types..."

"We can solve these problems one by one." Wen Desi was invigorated. "Old Zhan, why don't you take charge of industrial preparation?"

"No problem!" Zhan Wuya had never felt so fired up. Since leaving the factory to start his own business, he had struggled for nearly a decade. Though he had built a small operation, life had become dull and tedious—always scrambling to satisfy clients. Now, before his eyes appeared an unprecedented new world. His fighting spirit surged; he was determined to make a great splash in this new world.

The Crossing Committee's Industrial Group was founded that day. It came to be known, as a matter of habit, as "the Industry Sector." A few days later, another member of the Industry Sector reported in—none other than Ma Qianzhu, who would later fiercely contest with Zhan Wuya for the title of "Father of Crossing Industry" in their respective memoirs.

Ma Qianzhu had actually frequented the same forum as Xiao Zishan and the others; they vaguely recognized each other's handles. At first, however, he hadn't joined the wormhole discussion. He had been absorbed in another thread, devoted to his all-mechanical calculating-center system—christened "Gear Model 5"—an exercise in alternate-history design. Initially, he had assumed Director Wen's wormhole was speculative fiction like his mechanical computer. When he discovered these people were actually preparing to go to the Ming dynasty, he hurried to have an acquaintance sign him up. His motivation was hardly surprising: only by creating a pristine new world—free of microchips, where he himself was among the elite—could he realize his dream: a luxury mechanical computing center covering 6,000 *mu*, with 80,000 horsepower, performing 20,000 calculations per second. The thought of this colossal machine made his soul tremble.

In sum, Ma Qianzhu's tastes ran to steampunk. Keywords: *rivets, steam, steel*. Forests of smokestacks, the roar of boilers, black smoke from burning coal, great clouds of steam billowing from boilers, the thunderous clang of steel on steel, giant steam-turbine locomotives racing across the land, multi-turret hard-shell airships kept aloft by countless helium-filled compartments—*this* was his ideal world.

Upon receiving Wen Desi's phone invitation, he packed his bags without hesitation, quit his job drawing terrifyingly detailed highway-design diagrams, and set out by train for Guangdong.

His destination was not Guangzhou, but a county-level city he had never heard of. After getting off the train, he still had to transfer to a long-distance bus. This place was the staging base Xiao Zishan had found. Here the transmigrators would groom their horses and sharpen their weapons, preparing to set off on a one-way journey to conquer a parallel world.
