# Chapter 95 - Employment System (2)

Wu De held a mass meeting. At the meeting, Fu Youdi and his henchmen were fiercely criticized by the masses. All his problems were brought to the table for criticism. Even his picking feet before eating and snoring while sleeping were exposed. Wu De allowed the masses to participate universally in this meeting, enhancing their sense of ownership. Engaging in so-called "organized rebellion", fully satisfying their pleasure of turning over, and showing his wisdom.

Fu Youdi was announced to be removed from all posts at the meeting, and "reform through labor under the supervision of the masses" together with his henchmen. However, when the masses attempted to punch and kick him, and some even suggested beheading him for public display, Wu De stopped everyone—after all, Fu Youdi had worked hard for the transmigrators. His end couldn't be too bad, otherwise who would be willing to sell themselves to seek patronage in the future.

Then, the problems of the other two team leaders were also exposed, including deducting food, being lazy themselves, etc. The restless two people stood up consciously and knelt before Wu De to apologize.

"Your problems are big," Wu De put on a face of an upright magistrate, "But your work achievements in the previous period are obvious to all, so these problems will not be pursued."

"Thank Master for magnanimity." The two people were grateful to tears.

"Continue to work well in the future." After Wu De said this, he reorganized the entire captive labor team, renaming it the Production Team. The captain was Lin Xing, Wang Tian was the vice-captain, and the clerk was Zhang Xingjiao. Below, it was still divided into four production small teams. The captain of each team adopted an election system. Wu De stipulated that all management positions must learn to speak Mandarin, so the two team leaders who were criticized could be re-employed. Of course, they would restrain themselves a lot in the future. Others also mostly had the idea of learning to speak the language of "Chiefs" well.

The new labor system adopted the work point system. Completing the basic workload per person per day gets 1 work point. For management personnel and technical types of work, the basic workload is 1.2 work points. The part exceeding labor is increased proportionally. For particularly arduous, dangerous, or difficult work, work points are increased as appropriate.

Wu De explained the meaning of work points clearly in front of a rough blackboard with the simultaneous translation of Lin Xing and Xiong Buyou.

"What is the use of this work point?" He said, "Work points can now be exchanged for extra food. Equivalent to money. Want to eat more fish? Buy with work points. Want to eat more rice? Same." He paused, "In the future, you can also use this work point to buy more things, such as those farm tools and tools. As long as work points are enough, they can be sold to you..."

At this time, someone raised his hand timidly. It was Ma Peng: "Then can I buy rice for my mother to eat?" Probably afraid Wu De thought he wanted to escape, "I can bring my mother here to eat..."

Everyone laughed in an uproar: "Lost your mind? What use do Masters have for your old mother."

"Of course you can." Wu De seized this opportunity to preach his new policy, "This is the money you earned. How to use it is your freedom. In the future, we will launch more things that can be bought with work points."

Someone whispered and whispered below. Everyone was obviously interested in getting paid for work. Someone asked: "Then do we have to pay work points to eat the rice we eat every day now?"

"No need. I said before, it is exchanged for extra food." Wu De explained that food supply was still based on two meals, one dry and one thin.

"Master Wu said in the past that those who work well can turn into 'employees'. Do 'employees' also earn work points?"

"Yes." Wu De explained the difference between the two. The work point income of employees would be higher than theirs. For the same work, they get 1 work point, employees get 1.2 work points—explaining what a decimal point is was very difficult, worrying Xiong Buyou to death. Finally, he used two fruits: one fruit represents 1.0, the other cut into 10 slices, take out 2 slices, counting as 0.2. Such an intuitive education method finally made it clear.

Employees enjoy three meals of two dry and one thin for free, housing provided, and in the future, giving some private plots can also be considered—such conditions made many people jealous. However, the concern that being an employee means following bandits made most people have no hope for this bright future.

Wu De knew their concerns, so he didn't say too much. Over-enthusiastic propaganda would be counterproductive. Chinese farmers are the most realistic and also the most suspicious. Without tangible benefits, they will not easily board your pirate ship.

Sure enough, everyone was skeptical about this work point system. Some also thought it was deceptive. Asking captives to work and giving money, where is such a good thing in the world. But since then, Zhang Xingjiao was responsible for assigning work and recording points every day. After a week—they already knew "Chiefs" calculated days in units of seven days a week—everyone received varying amounts of work point coupons, ranging from seven points to ten points. This work point coupon had four different denominations: one fen, one li, two li, and five li.

Given that work point coupons were actually a disguised currency, the issuance of work point coupons was evaluated by the economic professionals of the Planning Committee. After discussion, it was considered no problem. Work point coupons are actually a grain-standard internal circulation coupon. Can only be exchanged for food in the two canteens of transmigrators. The scope of issuance and use is very small. As long as transmigrators have enough grain in hand, maintaining its basic credit is no problem.

Moreover, the value of the work point coupon itself is negligible. One work point can be exchanged for a bowl of dry rice (100 grams of rice), a bowl of porridge costs half a work point (50 grams of rice), and a salted fish costs two work points.

The work points earned every day can actually only improve food to a limited extent. The consumption of transmigrators' food reserves is negligible. Furthermore, as Wu Nanhai said: "If half a year after landing, we still don't even have the agricultural ability to feed laborers, it's better to commit mass suicide for a quick end."

As the first attempt to issue currency, for prudence, a financial working group was established by the Planning Committee to make a series of regulations on the issuance, printing, circulation, and storage of work point coupons. Work point coupons were printed by lithography in the printing room. The paper was brought card paper. The size was about the size of an RMB one jiao banknote; one li, two li, and five li were the same size as the old version of one fen RMB. The pattern was printed directly with black ink without color registration. The front was the majestic appearance of the Executive Committee Building, the back was the ship shadow of Fengcheng wheel, and the pattern was coconut trees. Only the denomination part used different colored inks to show the difference. Each work point coupon had a unique Arabic numeral serial number.

Xi Yazhou volunteered to inscribe "Transmigration Central Bank" for this new banknote, but Financial Group Leader Cheng Dong thought this thing was just a rough token coupon, similar to canteen meal tickets. There was no bank at all right now. It was better to retain its true color as a token coupon for the time being, and not misuse the name of a bank to avoid leaving any sequelae in the future.

Finally, the fancy paper that reached Wu De's hand only had the three words "Work Point Coupon" simply inscribed, and the issuing unit was "Bairen Production Team". Because the printing was very crude and the paper was not very suitable, the effect was a bit similar to the rough hell money sold outside the cemetery during the Qingming Festival, but in terms of technical content, no one in Daming could imitate it.

There was a beautiful black seal script stamp on this thing. Looking carefully, it was exactly his name stamp. Making Wu De laugh and cry, what does this mean?

Cheng Dong said doing this appeared more formal and also made the work point coupon look more solemn, equivalent to using Wu De as a guarantee of credit—after all, those laborers didn't recognize any Executive Committee members.

"If there is nothing on it, wouldn't it become real fancy paper, military scrip of the Great Japanese Empire?"

After the work point coupons were printed, they were all handed over to the Financial Group. Every week, Wu De collected them personally based on the score sheet. Because making payroll is delicate work, a person like Wu De without accounting experience couldn't handle it, so he only needed to take the weekly score sheet over, and people from the Financial Group who had done personnel payroll would summarize the payroll and issue work point coupons according to the amount.

For the laborers of the production team, this was a fresh thing. Copper coins, everyone used; silver, could also be seen; gold, heard of. Sometimes without money, used home-grown vegetables, chickens, ducks, and coarse cloth to exchange for salt and general merchandise. Buying things with paper pieces was unheard of.

Paper money was issued in the Ming Dynasty. However, this currency once vigorously promoted by the government had long died under the joint manipulation of emperors and bureaucrats with no financial common sense. Such a remote place had been a world of copper coins and silver many years ago. Although there were exchange vouchers similar to later silver drafts, ordinary people could not access them at all.

After getting it, everyone looked at me, I looked at you, no one believed this thing could be exchanged for food. Thinking if I rashly went to exchange for rice: Chief Wu said it could be used, what if Chief Wu in the canteen said it couldn't be used? Even the government often said east in this yamen and west in that yamen. Chief Wu was fair and looked prosperous, a very amiable person, but taking a fancy paper to buy things, maybe he would get angry—immortals fight, small people suffer, too many such things.

Finally, under everyone's instigation, and after getting the guarantee that if Chief Wu wanted to beat people, Lin Xing would go ask Wu De to save people, Ma Peng took out a five-li ticket trembling and handed it over, buying a bowl of porridge. As a result, the person delivering food accepted it very happily and added a bowl for him.

People around saw Ma Peng got the porridge, watched him slurp it down, then looked at the person delivering food over there who didn't look like coming over to punish Ma Peng. After being dazed for a while, everyone swarmed up, scrambling to take out work point coupons, buying rice, buying salted fish. Hu Yicheng from the Food Office delivering food was caught off guard and soon sold out all remaining things—no one expected such a buying frenzy to appear suddenly, so not much extra food was prepared—those who didn't buy looked at him eagerly. Around was a sound of loud chewing. Greedy eyes seemed to swallow him too. He hurriedly made a call to Wu Nanhai.
