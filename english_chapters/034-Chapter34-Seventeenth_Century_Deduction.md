# Chapter 34: Seventeenth-Century Deduction

"You have an acquaintance at the Qiwei Escort Bureau?" Xiao Zishan immediately followed up.

"Yes," Sun Chang replied frankly. "The bureau's manager and guards are all from my home region." It turned out that the Qiwei Escort Bureau was staffed entirely by Jiangxi natives; their escort routes ran only from Guangzhou to Nanchang in Jiangxi. Many of the bureau's guards were Sun Chang's former martial-arts brothers from the same school.

Whether to involve the escort bureau was not something Xiao Zishan dared decide alone—after all, the matter was grave. After a moment's hesitation, he said they would discuss it later, and instructed Sun Chang to keep all front and back gates securely closed.

Meanwhile, the Executive Committee received the news and immediately convened an emergency meeting. *Someone had dared to kidnap a transmigrator!* If this could be tolerated, what could not? Everyone wanted to teach them a lesson. Besides bringing in Ran Yao, the former police officer, they also gathered several mystery enthusiasts steeped in Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie. Xi Yazhou simply brought out a few hidden five-shot shotguns. Someone proposed making some grenades to "give the natives a taste." Others were ready to make sulfuric-acid bombs. Amid the uproar, Ma Qianzhu stepped forward and said:

"We can't send that many people."

"Why not?!" Engineer Wang was furious; seeing opposition, he immediately challenged.

"Going over in such numbers won't help—it'll just add to the chaos." Ma Qianzhu said. "That's Ming-era Guangzhou. We don't know the place at all. What's the use of sending so many people? We don't even have a map. Even if someone tells you where Director Wen is being held, could you find it?"

Everyone looked at each other. Apparently, no one had thought of this.

"Ming-era problems need Ming-era people to solve. What this really requires is intelligence. Once we know Director Wen's whereabouts, we can handle it—whether by armed rescue or paying ransom. Neither is a problem. But if a noisy crowd goes over, it won't be easy for Zishan and Engineer Wang to explain to their local partners, will it?"

"Pay ransom? How can you suggest that!" Someone was already indignant. "We're not going to wimp out! Never!" This drew a murmur of agreement. Though the transmigrators often said things like "Don't underestimate the ancients' wisdom" and "The ancients were quite formidable," inwardly they were full of modern superiority. The idea of "civilized modern people" compromising with "ignorant backward ancients"—just thinking about it wounded their pride.

"If we can resolve this quickly and safely, compromise isn't a bad option." Ma Qianzhu held his ground. "Armed rescue: first, we have no intelligence; second, it might endanger Director Wen's safety. Finally," he reminded everyone, "our goal isn't to have a showdown with the Ming-era underworld."

Seeing everyone's emotions slightly calmer, he continued: "We'll prepare for both. Ran Yao should still go—check the scene. I believe his criminal-investigation skills will suffice. This isn't some locked-room mystery, so the detective-fiction buffs don't need to go."

Several mystery enthusiasts voiced feeble protests.

"If we need an armed solution, we already have Beiwei over there. I propose the Athletics Group send two more people to assist—more would just get in the way."

Lin Shenhe pushed his way forward: "I'll go too. Give me that Emei small-caliber rifle. I've shot sniper rifles in America—virtually never miss within 500 meters."

"Fine, you go too."

"That's enough then." Seeing others still eager, Ma Qianzhu cut them off with a wave. To Engineer Wang he said: "Tell Zishan—try to leverage Ming-era people's capabilities. Don't put too much faith in force."

"Understood."

With the discussion concluded, everyone busied themselves packing gear. Ran Yao brought his camera and criminal-investigation notebook. He had fingerprint-collection tools too, but those were useless—the Ming had no fingerprint database. The Athletics Group brought three five-shot shotguns. Ammunition was short, and there was no time to reload new rounds—each gun got only ten shells. They also brought reconnaissance equipment: night-vision goggles, radio beacons. Bugs couldn't be obtained on short notice, but voice recorders, microphones, and cameras could be scrounged. As for walkie-talkies, smoke canisters, tear-gas grenades, gas masks, and various odds and ends—useful or not—they filled two large backpacks.

Ran Yao accompanied Xiao Zishan and Sun Chang in inspecting Director Wen's room and the entire compound, drawing several diagrams. Sun Chang was even more astonished that within a few hours, several more Australians had appeared—more surprising than learning Master Wen had been kidnapped. He watched this new Australian say nothing, just quietly prowl around the rooms and courtyard—now climbing a ladder, now lying on the ground peering through a small magnifying glass, occasionally scribbling with a pen-like thing in a notebook. He thought this must be an Australian constable—though he wondered how the Australian constable had arrived so fast.

After over an hour of investigation, Ran Yao had largely pieced together the crime.

"This was a multi-person coordinated operation." In the room, he briefed the grim-faced rescue team. The large square table stood on end, temporarily serving as a blackboard. Its black-lacquered rosewood surface was being defaced with chalk.

"This is the route the criminals used to enter." He drew a floor plan on the table. "The courtyard wall here is quite tall—about 7 to 8 meters. A human pyramid wouldn't work. They must have used a grappling hook. There are obvious hook-grip marks on the wall coping, and many fallen tiles."

"There really is such a thing as a grappling hook?"

"Yes. I've seen some records—there were still burglary cases using such tools well into the 1940s and '50s.

"After the criminals entered, they first used knockout incense on the servants in the outer courtyard, then entered and drugged each of our four colleagues in turn—proceeding from east to west. They waited some time outside, then calmly searched each room.

"They then broke the padlock on the crossing-point room and attempted to pry open the steel grating. There are at least three to four pry marks on the bars. From the abrasion patterns, the tool was probably a crude blade or similar long, narrow iron implement.

"Finally, they carried away the unconscious Director Wen, going directly out through the back courtyard gate.

"Though the traces aren't entirely clear, from footprints extracted from the muddy ground and wall-friction marks, there are at least three different-sized sets of footprints. Outside the courtyard wall, there's another set. So we estimate at least four people. The criminals' heights range from 1.55 to 1.60 meters. They had specialized climbing tools, weapons, and narcotic substances—professional criminals.

"One rather peculiar phenomenon: among the four sets of footprints, one is barefoot. Though barefoot walking was common among ancients, this is Guangzhou city, not some remote backwater. This could be a breakthrough point."

"You mean social groups accustomed to going barefoot?"

"Right. It shows at least one of the criminals is habitually barefoot. It's unlikely to be one person's quirk—it should be a habit shared by a social group."

"Who could that be?" Everyone was puzzled.

"I'm not a historian." Ran Yao said helplessly. Honestly, in the modern world this case would be trivially easy. The traces left by this gang were like walking around without pants under modern forensic techniques. Unfortunately, this was seventeenth-century Ming—no fingerprint databases, no criminal records to check. He was also completely ignorant of this ancient city's social conditions. Standard investigative methods were useless here.

Everyone was rather disappointed. They had expected a professional investigator to make short work of these petty criminals. Apparently not. Modern criminal investigation relies heavily on long-accumulated intelligence and archives.

"Anything else you can tell? Like motive. Was it premeditated or opportunistic?" Xiao Zishan pressed.

"Premeditated. Reconstructing the crime: the criminals had detailed knowledge of the compound. There are over twenty rooms big and small here, yet knockout incense was only used in occupied rooms. On the windows of empty rooms, I found no dosing holes.

"The reason they used knockout incense is obviously they knew you have strong defensive capabilities. Otherwise, they wouldn't have succeeded so easily—Director Wen always carries pepper spray wherever he goes.

"Also, as Beiwei mentioned, a few days ago you had an intrusion attempt. That was probably the criminals casing the place.

"As for motive—that's puzzling." Ran Yao stroked his chin. "From the list of stolen items, they clearly came for valuables. But kidnapping Director Wen alone suggests targeted abduction."

"Do they know Director Wen's identity as an Australian sea merchant?"

"I'm certain they do." Ran Yao pointed at the stolen-items list. "This gang was interested not just in silver but in your 'Australian goods.' They didn't take many Ming-era valuables. Instead, they took your shoes, socks, ballpoint pens—modern trinkets. They clearly came prepared."

"You mean...?"

"This isn't simple theft or kidnapping." Ran Yao shook his head. "I think kidnapping Director Wen may not be for ransom purposes."

Everyone conferred quietly and agreed to use Ming-era people's resources to gather intelligence. Xiao Zishan called Sun Chang: "Bring the manager of the Qiwei Escort Bureau here."
