# Chapter 1385 - Three Men in a Slum

Zhao Yingong saw off Wu Zhixiang, returned to his study, and checked again if there was any latest news - what he was most concerned about right now was the Merchants Bureau cargo ships heading north.

The twenty Merchants Bureau sand boats, besides 50,000 shi of grain, were also loaded with large amounts of cargo. Liaodong lacked everything, especially cotton cloth and cotton. To survive in this bitter cold place, besides grain, one needed sufficient winter clothing. Historially, the Ming court had to transport large amounts of cloth and cotton to various Liaodong guards every year. Therefore, these sand boats were loaded with large amounts of such cold-weather clothing.

For this grain and pay transport heading north, according to rules, transport fees were fully reimbursed by the Ministry of Revenue. And with the status of "official ships," they didn't have to pay various taxes when entering any port or waterway. Not taking the opportunity to engage in some "official smuggling" would simply be wasting this great opportunity.

Carrying private cargo had always been the main revenue item for canal boats. Transporting grain and pay by sea naturally also had to make a profit.

Besides cotton clothes and cloth, there were also large quantities of "Mongolian goods" like iron woks and tea bricks. Trading with various Mongolian tribes, buying horses was an important business for the Guan-Ning Army. The purchased Mongolian horses were not only used to replenish cavalry but also resold in large quantities inside the pass to make money. These commodities, once transported there, would have no trouble selling.

However, going to sea in summer also carried great risks. The threat of typhoons was significant, and sand boat sailors were unfamiliar with the coastal route to Liaodong. So this time Zhao Yingong didn't send his own navigators and core sailors as he did for trade with Japan, but fully used the original sand boat sailors. He only sent a few trusted aides to accompany the ships.

However, ancient navigation lacked both weather and sea condition forecasts and accurate charts. Sea ships going to sea often faced great risks, and shipwrecks were very frequent. When Zhao Yingong researched historical data on Liaodong sea transport, records of ships destroyed and people killed by storms were too numerous to count. As for the term "drifting loss," it was ubiquitous. This made him have great doubts about the safety of this coastal shipping - even more worried than about trade with Japan. For this reason, pigeon trainers were sent on the ships, releasing a pigeon every three days to report voyage progress and sailing conditions.

The news that came back put him somewhat at ease. Although the ships had waited out the wind several times, they had been gradually heading north without any ships damaged or run aground. The journey seemed smooth.

The next piece of news concerned the "Rice Riots" involving the four prefectures of Northern Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu. Zhao Yingong was greatly shocked - he had known about the incident in Lin'an County a few days ago but didn't pay it much mind at the time. In his view, such things were not surprising. Peasant uprisings, peasant riots and the like - when had they ever ceased? Looting a rice shop was bluntly just like eating from rich households in famine years, basically nothing significant. The government probably wouldn't bother to pursue it seriously either.

But this matter actually expanded rapidly to so many prefectures and counties within a few days! Out of a modern person's "political sensitivity," Zhao Yingong immediately thought that someone might be manipulating this behind the scenes - or at least someone was networking.

Zhao Yingong knew very well that the recent skyrocketing rice prices were directly related to the Merchants Bureau's massive rice purchases. If someone wanted to trace the source, the Merchants Bureau could not escape blame.

Massive purchasing and shipping out of grain during famine years and disaster months... Thinking of this, Zhao Yingong's blood almost ran cold - this charge was solid. If someone really used this to incite the common people from behind, with one man initiating chaos and ten thousand responding, the consequences would be unimaginable. He personally would probably end up with his reputation ruined, fleeing in panic.

"Quick! Send messages to all places, I want to know the detailed situation of the Rice Riots!"

Outside Hangzhou city, there was a place called Nanxiawa (South Lower Depression). It was a "lower corner," or in modern terms, a slum.

This was a place where improved migrant fleeing famine concentrated. Whenever disasters occurred elsewhere, disaster victims would swarm from all directions to the provincial capital, supporting the old and carrying the young, just to scrape a meal. Some died here and became roadside corpses, some survived the famine and went back, and some settled down here. The place Nanxiawa was full of water puddles, low-lying. Whenever the Fuchun River rose, this place would waterlog. It could neither be farmed nor built on. So it became a piece of unclaimed wasteland.

Fleeing common people settled on this wasteland, building shacks with various scavenged waste materials. Gradually it became a shantytown found in any city. This place was low-lying to begin with; sewage was hard to drain. When it rained, water accumulated immediately, mixing with various garbage to become a stinking desolate mud pit.

Except for poor people who had no choice but to shelter here, anyone passing by would cover their nose and hurry past.

Among these densely packed shacks, near a graveyard, there was a shack where three men were currently sitting, drinking strong wine around a small broken table missing a leg. The missing table leg was propped up with broken bricks. On the table was a large bowl of river snails as a side dish - in Jiangnan, this was the cheapest meat dish. By rivers and lakes, one didn't even need to buy it; taking a bowl to grope along the bank could get a bowlful.

Although it wasn't dark yet, the room was very dim. An oil lamp had already been lit on the table. The shack was built from a mixture of broken bricks, small stones, rotten wood planks, rice straw, and mud. There were no proper windows, only a window hole opened in the wall, set with a piece of broken translucent shell discarded by someone. The roof made of bamboo strips and rice straw was very low; if a slightly taller person stood up, their head would almost touch the top.

Although the house was low, small, and crude, the owner kept it very clean within possible limits. Bricks supported a bamboo bed board rarely seen here. On the bed was spread a broken kang mat, which though torn, was wiped clean. A broken bamboo hat hung on the wall. Against the wall, a wooden board serving as a table was propped up, on which were placed paper, ink, brush, and inkstone - although they were cheap goods used by accountants, they showed the owner here was a literate "scholar."

On the table were several dirty, dented pewter wine warmers, and three chipped and cracked bowls serving as wine cups. The air was filled with the smell of dregs from low-quality yellow wine.

Nasty alcohol fumes, the sweat smell of three men, plus a table full of snail shells - if someone broke into the room at this moment, they would definitely think the men were drinking happily. And these three people were precisely using this false appearance to hold a meeting.

Hao Yuan, who had stood out in the Rice Riots a few days ago, was prominently among them. He wore a small jacket full of patches, playing with the "wine bowl" in his hand.

Of the other two people present, one was precisely the Broken Boots Party member Cao Guangjiu. He was dressed like a down-and-out scholar. The other had a face full of scars, looking very ferocious - precisely Gou Chengxuan who had escaped from Lingao back then.

After Gou Chengxuan escaped from the routed army on Hainan Island, he fled back to Guangzhou through untold hardships. He didn't dare show his face - such a major defeat would inevitably implicate many people. A person of unknown identity like him escaping from the chaotic army would very likely be beheaded as a bandit spy. Therefore, he dared not reveal his identity in Guangzhou. Although he still had twenty or thirty taels of silver on him, he dared not show his wealth, simply living by begging.

A chance opportunity allowed him to meet Lin Ming in Guangzhou, who was searching for his sister-in-law. Gou Chengxuan's familiarity with Lingao and the bandits made this clueless Brocade Guard treat him like a treasure. After talking with him for several nights in a row, learning many important things, Lin Ming told Gou Chengxuan to go back to Lingao to gather information and gave him some silver. Gou Chengxuan, who was already scared out of his wits, how could he dare go? So using the opportunity of sneaking back to Lingao, he quietly fled.

Gou Chengxuan had a guilty conscience - the consequences of offending someone from the Brocade Guard were severe. He dared not stay in Guangzhou any longer. Seeing that Guangdong had become a place of trouble, he simply fled north all the way to Jiangnan.

His luck was not bad. Shortly after arriving in Jiangnan, relying on his knowledge of the bandits and Australian goods, he was taken in by a wealthy household as a retainer, living a life without worry about food and clothing.

Gou Chengxuan never knew why the master took him in, until recently when he learned that the master had noticed the bandits very early on.

A year ago, Gou Chengxuan was ordered to go to Hangzhou to investigate Master Zhao's background. When he first saw Wanbi Bookshop and Phoenix Mountain Villa, he knew the bandits' black hands had finally extended to Jiangnan.

Gou Chengxuan's first reaction was to flee for his life, but thinking that the world was now in chaos, this Jiangnan was at least a place with royal law. It was also thousands of li away from Hainan. Even if this Master Zhao possessed three heads and six arms, wouldn't he have to obediently be a submissive subject of the court?

Although his master had strong interest in the bandits, it could be seen he didn't approve of Master Zhao's various actions. Clearly, the master and the bandits were not on the same side. Under the master's protection, not only could he be safe and sound, perhaps he could even have a chance for revenge - Gou Chengxuan knew that for the Ming to destroy the bandits was probably impossible, but finding an opportunity to kill a few bandits personally and make them suffer a big loss was still possible.

Regrettably, the bandits consistently used the tactic of colluding with officialdom and gentry in the Ming Dynasty - this bandit surnamed Zhao used some Australian bewildering art to charm the local Hangzhou gentry into confusion. It was said he also built relationships with Fushe scholars. Now he was decently considered a person with face in the local area. Let alone himself being unable to move him, even the master was somewhat apprehensive. He only told him to watch Master Zhao's movements at all times.

Information on the sericulture improvement, loan issuance, and even manipulation of silk prices conducted by Zhao Yingong in Hangzhou was all delivered to his hands by special personnel for him to summarize and organize.

Gou Chengxuan was very familiar with these tactics - all were carbon copies of what had been done in Lingao back then. This Bandit Zhao had such guts, actually burrowing under the court's eyelids to "transform Xia with Yi."

However, his master never expressed anything regarding the news and comments he collected and organized. Just when Gou Chengxuan began to feel hope was slim for his revenge plan, the master finally sent him out.

His mission was to maintain contact with this person named Hao Yuan and convey the master's decree. As for this Cao Guangjiu, he was also a person the master wanted him to maintain contact with.
