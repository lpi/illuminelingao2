Chapter 4 Lingao Qiming Romance Version Prologue
Author: Can't find it, it's a Tieba work
Verse says:

Peaks and ridges gather, waves and billows are angry,
The road to Tongguan is inside and outside the mountains and rivers.

Looking at the Western Capital, hesitating in mind.

Sad passing the places of Qin and Han, ten thousand palace rooms have all turned to earth.

Prosperity, the people suffer; Demise, the people suffer.

It was the time when the Yuan Emperor was muddled, the world was in turmoil, the people had no way to live, officials were cruel and exploitative, taxes and corvee labor in spring and autumn, wars were continuous, refugees rose everywhere, and there were bandit rebellions in all lands of China, breeding evil cults, too many to list. Moreover, there were natural disasters and years of hardship, strange phenomena of all kinds, unheard of before. White rainbows pierced the sun, winter thunder was like drums, snakes and dragons came out and black rain fell, wolves and bei appeared and locusts flew. Floods in the south and droughts in the north, living beings were plunged into misery, the miserable sights in the human world, how could they be covered. Great famine in Guanzhong, people's livelihood was boiling. Mr. Yunzhuang was appointed as the Deputy Censor-in-Chief of the Shaanxi Branch Secretariat, managing the Northwest. Since Mr. arrived at the official post, he never stayed in the yamen, but rode a carriage around. Whenever he met the hungry, he gave food, scattering all his family wealth, not enough for one in ten thousand. Seeing chickens and dogs were not heard, human smoke was cut off, and learning that among the people there were those who killed sons to serve mothers, and exchanged children to eat, he couldn't help but be greatly moved and sorrowful, and wrote this verse.

The voice and color in the verse were magnificent and stern, and the mood was hard to fulfill. It happened to be heard by a strange person. Since this strange person cultivated the Dao in the Tang Dynasty, the rise and fall of the red dust, the Central Plains gradually becoming waste, could hardly get onto his heart anymore. Hearing the lyrics and tune, his heart was wan. He couldn't help but use that King Wen's divination to deduce the destiny. After ten days, his brows turned to joy, and he laughed loudly: "Stop, stop, stop, it seems I worried too much. The great change of the world is just within ten years."

The strange person's disciple asked: "What does Master mean?" The strange person said: "You have cultivated with me for several years. I just divined and knew that you have another destiny. You just pack your bags and rush to Jiangnan." The disciple asked in confusion: "Go to Jiangnan for what?" The strange person said: "You just don't ask. The abolition and establishment of the world is right before eyes. You are in Jiangnan, naturally there will be a grass-roots emperor looking for you. That grass-roots emperor is the future founding lord. His surname will control the national fortune of China. Your destiny is in it. Go, go!"

Within years, the current situation was rotten, beacon fires rose everywhere, worse than before. There was a hero, determined and brave, fighting south and north, sitting on elite soldiers like the sea, fierce generals like clouds, and further assisted by strategists and strange people. In the vertical and horizontal, he swept the universe. Emperors of past dynasties, born humble, none reached him. Establishing the capital in Nanjing, with the national title Great Ming, the illustrious three-hundred-year foundation was thus laid down.

The general trend of the world, long unity must divide. Since that grass-roots emperor left, the descendants of generations were mostly unworthy. Before a hundred years, the world already had a declining trend. That strange person shook his head and said: "National fortune is like this, what can be done, what can be done." Another hundred years passed, the strange person observed the celestial phenomena at night, seeing purple qi scattering east, Mars chaotic, Venus emitting light; seeing again the Life Palace in the south lost, Venus broken; seeing again Purple Wei rushing north, stars dim, Greedy Wolf holding up the sky, Vermilion Bird crossing the mansion. The pattern conflicted, unseen in a thousand years. The strange person was fearful inside, his mind haggard. Not having peered into the Heavenly Dao, he feared and said: "The Heavenly Palace is chaotic, unheard of. Within five hundred years, there must be a drastic change. I'm afraid at that time, it will not be my fortune. Cultivating truth and ascending to immortality must be before that."

Since then, the strange person did not ask about worldly affairs, dismissed the disciples, and concentrated on cultivating the Dao. Before sixty years, fearing that situation of drastic change again, he calmed down to deduce the destiny. In a moment, he unfolded his brows and said: "It turns out the Central Plains changes masters, another chaos of Five Hu and Meng Yuan. Purple Wei Star is prosperous, coming from the east. The national fortune of this dynasty will tolerate me for another two or three hundred years."

While pondering, suddenly the stars lost light in an instant, the universe was dark. Suddenly the stars burned, the sky dome was incinerated. Again saw purple qi dissipating, sometimes gathering, like a precious sword. Heavenly Chief and Earth Palace all cracked open; Civil Song and Military Song, sometimes vanished without a trace, sometimes were brilliant all over the sky; Heavenly Noble and Heavenly Longevity, sometimes silent annihilation, sometimes expanding and exploding; all constellations on the sides, like boiling water splashing snow, or like wind blowing willow catkins, disappeared without a trace. In the chaos, General Stars and Emperor Stars, more than five hundred shone and flew, burning people's eyes and ears. Where the Heavenly Palace was, it was like the scorching sun in the sky. Under the whole sky, there was no place to hide shadow anymore. Even that extremely east and extremely west place was also dazzlingly bright. Various constellations and heavenly dippers since ancient times were all swallowed. All patterns were broken. There was that strange person terrified, body trembling. For a time, liver and gall both split, scared out of wits. Pinching his fingers again to look at that celestial phenomenon and deduce the fate number, it was exactly as before, no difference. The strange person was still in shock, saying to himself: "So that changing situation is right before eyes. I'm afraid the land of Divine Province will be overturned from now on. The Dao of ancient times is overturned here. From now on, there will be no method for us to cultivate the body, nor a place for our generation to establish ourselves. If I stay here again, I fear there will be heavenly punishment." After saying that, this strange person achieved the Dao and left.
