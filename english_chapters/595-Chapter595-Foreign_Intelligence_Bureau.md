# Chapter 595 - Foreign Intelligence Bureau

After a week of investigation, two other candidates were quickly eliminated. One's consumption records showed he drank rum in cafes every day, often finishing his daily quota, and according to people around him, he would talk loudly and critique current affairs whenever he drank. He had also been drunk and disorderly several times. Such a person was immediately dropped. The other candidate had relatively balanced indices but had no management experience. When Ming Lang interviewed him, he found that this person's entire concept of intelligence came from thrillers like *007*, full of fantasy colors.

The remaining candidate was Jiang Shan. His personal file was very long. Dai Xie, the representative of the Central State Council, snorted after reading his materials: "This is simply a standard version of an elite." Dai Xie was Ma Qianzhu's old subordinate in the Planning Committee. When the Planning Committee was transformed into the Planning Agency, he was transferred to the Central State Council.

The profile was prominent: Jiang Shan, 33 years old, Master of Psychology (Social Psychology), Master of Business Administration (Enterprise Management), Bachelor of Medicine (Bio-engineering). Born into a Traditional Chinese Medicine family (knew a bit about pulse diagnosis and prescribing), had two years of marketing experience at IBM, six years of engineering/business/planning/investment work experience in a central power enterprise, served as project manager for large-scale single-unit wind power projects... came from an airborne troop family, familiar with light weapons shooting and fighting techniques.

"I think he is relatively suitable," Ming Lang said. "Being this director mainly involves intelligence analysis and administrative management levels. From his professional and career status, he has development potential."

His secret appraisal showed this person was gentle but tough, outwardly soft but inwardly steely, with calm and meticulous thinking. Roughly speaking, he was a suitable leadership candidate.

As for financial records, they were also very clean. Records showed this person almost never went to cafes to drink. Monthly circulation coupons were only used to buy some extra meals in the cafeteria. He didn't smoke at all.

Masses reported this person was very willing to communicate with others but never commented on current affairs.

"Comrade Jiang Shan is here." The female clerk reported to him. Then he saw the man he had seen countless times in photos walk in. 178cm tall, 63kg weight. This person's body shape was very proportionate, broad shoulders and long legs, a typical athlete's physique, very healthy. His hair was cut extremely short. He looked capable and vigorous.

Ming Lang thought, if not for his round baby face making him look overly delicate, he could completely become a model of a "Pure Chinese" under the "New Chinese Order."

"Hello, Comrade Ming Lang!" The comer greeted him briskly with a refreshing smile that made people feel comfortable. This person was wearing a neatly ironed training uniform with not a speck of mud on it, even emitting a smell of disinfectant—he was currently working in the Ministry of Health laboratory, a member of the vaccine research and development team.

"Hello, please sit." He bowed slightly in his seat.

"The air here is really nice." Jiang Shan looked around the office with a look of sincere praise.

"Not at all, not at all. Offices are wherever they are assigned," Ming Lang said.

He coughed once: "Entrusted by the Executive Committee and the Senate, I announce to you—" He put down the document in his hand, "I won't read the official jargon. I hereby notify you that you are now the Deputy Director of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau—but actually the Executive Deputy Director."

"Thank the Executive Committee and the Senate for their trust in me," a look of innocent excitement appeared on his face. "Of course, I also want to thank you..."

"No, this matter has nothing to do with me," Ming Lang hurriedly denied. "We handled it according to organizational procedures."

"Yes, yes." Jiang Shan said another bunch of flattering words, unconsciously pulling the relationship between the two much closer. It could be seen that this person had put some effort into Ming Lang—he had inquired about his family situation clearly.

"You flatter me, you flatter me." Ming Lang nodded, smiling politely, thinking: I've seen plenty of people like you. Seeming extremely easy to get along with, but actually having deep "internal kung fu." Belonging to those easy to know but hard to know deeply. "Of course, there is still a 7-day publicity period for your appointment. But since the appointment has been passed by the Senate, the publicity is basically just a formality."

A few hours later, Jiang Shan arrived at his office. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau was a very shabby institution—the past so-called Intelligence Committee was actually just a joint conference institution, with personnel sent regularly from various external-facing ports to participate in exchange and consolidation. Most administrative work was undertaken by the General Bureau of Political Security. Now that a separate department was established, personnel from other institutions were all withdrawn. Jiang Shan became a commander without soldiers.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau didn't even have its own independent large compound; he only got a two-story small building. The room was piled with file boxes transferred from other departments, sealed with strips. The most classified parts hadn't been sent yet, requiring him to retrieve them from various departments later.

Jiang Shan engaged an office. He believed that as the Executive Deputy Director, he had this power. The office was chosen at the end of the second-floor corridor. The location was ideal, just that the area was slightly large. He thought he could partition a meeting room out of it, which would be enough to convene personnel for meetings.

There was only a standard desk and a chair in this office. This was standard configuration. If he needed "upgraded configuration," he had to write a list himself and apply to the General Office.

No rush to acquire equipment now, Jiang Shan thought. The General Office would help him solve furniture like tables and chairs in the office. He first had to consider manpower and organizational structure. As the famous saying goes: "Work is mainly about personnel arrangement."

Jiang Shan had never done intelligence work, but everyone here started from scratch, from nothing to something. Moreover, there was a powerful database for him to reference. The configuration wouldn't be worse than this spacetime anyway.

He sorted his thoughts and spread a sheet of white paper on the table. To do a thing, the first thing is to know where one's goal and positioning are. The intelligence department belongs to the power department, an important component of a regime, but its status within the "important" government departments can be big or small.

Leaving aside giants like the CIA, Red Army General Staff Intelligence Directorate, MI5, etc., where is the positioning of the Lingao regime's foreign intelligence agency? Or rather, where are the future "enemies"?

Jiang Shan knew very well that intelligence work has no friends. It is not rare for "friends" to plant spies on each other in this line of business. Needless to say, the French, who are double-dealing, even the Americans' die-hard ally, the most loyal British servant, would not give up planting intelligence personnel in the United States.

Who are the enemies of the Transmigration Group? He first drew a flag on the white paper and wrote "Ming" on it. This was Great Ming. Then he drew several iron anchors, marked with arrows writing "Liu," "Zheng," "Li." The third drawn was a head dragging a pigtail—this was Later Jin. Next, he drew patterns of several three-masted ships, drawing different flags: British, Spanish, and Dutch. Thinking for a moment, he finally drew a minority-style headdress, representing the local Li and Miao people.

First is Great Ming. Undoubtedly, although Great Ming's national power is weak, in terms of territory, population, and economic strength, it is still the number one opponent of the Transmigration Group, and the most dangerous opponent. If Great Ming were to get serious and deal with the Lingao regime with the importance used to deal with Later Jin, they would face a huge crisis.

Fortunately, Great Ming's internal strife is extremely severe. Its energy is mainly consumed in internal friction. Plus the tragic financial situation, unless Chongzhen pays direct attention to the Hainan battlefield, they won't face too big a challenge.

Since Great Ming is the Transmigration Group's main source of population and materials, and also the key target of the Transmigration Group's invasion, Great Ming is obviously the key intelligence work target of the Transmigration Group. He drew a "1" on Great Ming.

Intelligence work on Great Ming already has considerable foundation, especially the work of Guangzhou Station and Leizhou Station. Guangzhou Station mastered the central activities of the entire Guangdong province, while Leizhou Station provided the possibility of early warning for large-scale land and sea attacks launched by Great Ming against Lingao.

Unfortunately, behind the Guangzhou and Leizhou stations, there are also figures from the commercial department. Looking at the Executive Committee's meaning, these two stations will still focus on trade as their main work in the future, not intelligence work.

However, their existence provides a very good foundation for intelligence work. Guangzhou Station's infiltration into the Guangdong center has been fruitful, and through controlling Qiwie Escort Agency, it has gradually penetrated into many areas of Guangdong and neighboring provinces. With their support, the infiltration of intelligence personnel can go deeper.

Later Jin. They currently form no interest relationship with the Transmigration Group. After Li Luoyou's visit, Later Jin might become a trade partner of the Transmigration Group, but only that. Later Jin is viewed as a border trouble by Great Ming, but not worth mentioning to Lingao. This regime is poor in state and people, merely a bandit-style local small regime built on extreme internal oppression and external reliance on robbery. In the near future, it cannot threaten the Transmigration Group. In the complete future, eliminating it is but a lifting of a hand for the Transmigration Group. Intelligence activities on Later Jin can be placed last. He wrote a "5".

The pirate maritime merchants along the South China coast represented by "Liu," "Zheng," and "Li" are now reaching the peak of their power. Zheng Zhilong has great wealth and power, being the biggest threat to the Transmigration Group at sea. Fortunately, Li Kuiqi restrains him; he won't threaten the Transmigration Group temporarily, only counting as a potential threat.

Liu Xiang is the most direct maritime threat to the Transmigration Group. Moreover, he colluded with the Spaniards and already moved against Lingao, suffering a loss. It is not an exaggeration to say he holds a grudge.

Jiang Shan drew a "2" on the character "Liu".

Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and British. These four are the main foreign forces on the East Asian and Southeast Asian seas. The British have the smallest power in Southeast Asia, only possessing factories in India and Siam, with weak strength, and have already formed trade links with the Transmigration Group. Temporarily not a work focus.

Spaniards and Portuguese are under the flag of one king, but share the same bed with different dreams, each having their own plans. Their power on the Chinese coast is neither large nor do they have much ambition. Just wanting to keep their own power. They won't pose too big a threat to the Transmigration Group. And the Transmigration Group temporarily doesn't want to capture Macau or Manila either. Of these two places, the former is Europe's gateway to China, the latter is a transit station for silver import. The Senate believes it's better to let them continue to exist for now.

Jiang Shan believed the Dutch were the most dangerous among these four major foreign forces. Not only because the Dutch had the strongest power in Southeast Asia, but also because they were the most active and aggressive. If the Spaniards' plan to conquer China was just babble, then the Dutch had truly considered this issue. He knew that in 1622 the Dutch launched an expedition against the Chinese coast, genuinely harboring the goal of occupying colonies on the Chinese coast. Only later finding China too huge and difficult to achieve this goal did they retreat from Penghu and went to Taiwan.

As for the local Li and Miao people on the island, Jiang Shan placed them last: their strength is limited, and there are already two counterpart departments responsible. Whether the Religious Affairs Office or the Li and Miao Affairs Office, they have done a lot of work on Li and Miao people. No need for him to stick a foot in again, at most doing some intelligence consolidation and analysis work is fine.

After sorting out the priority, he began to write the organizational structure—this was to be reported to the Organization Department for review tomorrow. Jiang Shan considered again and again, deciding to first establish the Intelligence Analysis Division—intelligence work is first analyzing open intelligence. This point is no different between the 21st century and the 17th century. Most intelligence can be obtained from public channels. The Transmigration Group doesn't need to know the Emperor's comments on memorials. Under ancient productivity conditions, any measure of the government can be quickly seen from the operation of bureaucracy.

The plan he finally submitted set up a total of five divisions: First Division is the Domestic Division, specifically responsible for the Great Ming government; Second Division—Overseas Division, targeting Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and British forces, adding more later if necessary; Third Division responsible for unclassified various forces, currently mainly targeting pirates and maritime merchants along the Chinese coast, also including future Li Zicheng and other forces; Intelligence Analysis Division, specifically responsible for analyzing and consolidating collected intelligence; Support Division, responsible for providing various support for intelligence activities.

Additionally establish an office, responsible for all administrative, personnel, and archive work, as well as coordination work. Considering the existence of cross-organization institutions like Guangzhou and Leizhou, cross-department coordination work will definitely be very heavy.

His organizational plan was quickly approved, except for the Support Division. The Executive Committee believed the Foreign Intelligence Bureau could rely on the support of other departments to conduct activities. For example, in Great Ming it could rely on the Ministry of Commerce; if force was needed, Special Reconnaissance Team could be deployed. Jiang Shan knew there was no need to argue on this issue. In the past, there were too many Elders without positions; now there were obviously too few.

He recruited the first Elder. This person was named Wang Ding. Seemingly to contrast with him, this person was 30 years old, about 1.6 meters tall, with a common face that couldn't be found if thrown into a crowd, but Jiang Shan felt this person had advantages for intelligence work—first, he didn't like to talk; second, his appearance didn't attract attention.

Moreover, he had worked as a handyman in a certain powerful department. Even if he hadn't eaten pork, he had seen pigs run. He spoke logically about intelligence analysis and had his own insights.

Wang Ding couldn't make a name for himself in Lingao. Seeing Chang Shide mixing wind and water after being dispatched externally, he moved the thought of becoming an expatriate intelligence officer.

"I think you better stay in the agency as the Chief of the Intelligence Analysis Division," Jiang Shan said to him.

"But I prefer to go abroad, to places like Jiangnan to serve the organization..." Wang Ding had this intention for a long time. Set up a small business as an intelligence station in Jiangnan, then do some silk and tea business—he only knew these about Jiangnan specialties. The Qinhuai Eight Beauties had too high a price to dare asking, but getting a few Suzhou and Hangzhou beauties as concubines was still possible.

"Hehe," Jiang Shan ruthlessly broke his sweet dream, "Do you think the Executive Committee people don't know your little abacus? Look, people who can be dispatched to Jiangnan must be those who can shoulder both making money and intelligence. Do you think they will choose you?"

Of course not; this was something not even to think about. Wang Ding still had this bit of self-knowledge.

"If you firmly request dispatch, getting you to Shaanxi or Liaodong is more likely."

"Forget it, I'll just be this division chief." Wang Ding immediately stopped insisting on his dispatch request. He scratched his head, "I also did intelligence analysis back then; count as half a professional."

"That's right. Honestly speaking: what's good about being dispatched? Breaking away from the core is not a good thing."

"Alright, alright, I firmly obey the organization's arrangement." Wang Ding said, "Tell me, what is the first thing our team does?"

"Of course, finding people to be division chiefs and office director, otherwise we can't operate." Jiang Shan said, "But this is for later. Let's first talk about how to carry out intelligence work."

"I manage intelligence analysis..."

"Come on, our place isn't the CIA with clearly separated rules and regulations. Right now my staff officer is only you." He took out a silver cigarette case, "Smoke one?"

"Good." Wang Ding saw at a glance this wasn't Lingao local produce tobacco, but old spacetime cigarettes. Cigarettes brought privately were basically consumed completely after two years. Only recently some American cigarettes were distributed after salvaging a shipwreck.

But looking closely, it was actually a "Chunghwa". He was startled. The preciousness of a Chunghwa cigarette was far above condoms.

"You still have Chunghwa?"

"Yes, I brought some stock, preserved quite well. You smoke." Jiang Shan said, taking a box of matches and lighting it for him.

Wang Ding was caught off guard, hurriedly took a puff from the fire, then slowly inhaled deeply and exhaled.

"Too awesome, the real taste of old spacetime." Wang Ding said with a look of nostalgia.

"Alright, tell me your views." Jiang Shan put the cigarette case back in his pocket—actually he didn't smoke at all. Bringing cigarettes was nothing more than for public relations use.

"Our intelligence work, at the current stage, is inevitably an appendage of trade activities. I think we should have a clear understanding of this." Wang Ding said, "On this point, we must first correct our position."
