# Chapter 311 - Sweet Port Crisis: Special Ops Equipment

"How did the fire start earlier?" Chang Shide asked Ma Sanqiang again.

"Reporting to the owner: it was the little ones being careless with candles, causing the owner to worry," Ma Sanqiang replied respectfully.

"Be careful in the future. Clean up the fire scene, and be careful!"

"Yes," Ma Sanqiang responded, turned around, and shouted loudly, "Everyone be careful with fire in the future, don't let it catch fire again!"

"How badly is the child hurt?"

"Not lightly," Ma Sanqiang looked worried. "We've already sent someone to fetch a doctor."

"Go to the accounting room and draw twenty taels of silver for expenses. Hire a better doctor." Chang Shide turned and walked away.

"Thank you, Owner!" Ma Sanqiang called out loudly from behind.

Liao Daxing caught up a few steps and whispered, "Owner, you must think thrice about this matter." He warned, "This kind of thing can't be covered up! Zhao Jijiao's group are not people to mess with. If they suffer a loss, they will definitely come to provoke trouble. Dealing with a lawsuit then will be a troublesome matter."

"Mm." Chang Shide didn't explain much.

"People like them aren't afraid of beatings or killing; even the yamen can't do anything about them. But their skill in causing trouble is number one under heaven. Why forge this grudge with them?"

"Forge a grudge?" Chang Shide gave a profound smile. "It won't happen. No grudge will be forged." Saying this, he walked inside on his own.

That was the inner courtyard; no one except the owners' confidants could enter. Liao Daxing sighed and hurried off to discuss countermeasures with his cousin Liao Diahua.

Chang Shide stood in the courtyard for a moment, breathing in the sugary, slightly choking air of the sugar refinery. A moment later, one of Beiwei's indigenous team members quietly approached.

"Chief Bei asks you, now that the situation has been interrogated out, what do you plan to do with the person? Send him back to Lingao or—"

"Dispose of him immediately," Chang Shide said. "I'm heading over now."

Outside Xuwen County in April, the polluted air discharged from chimneys, carrying the scent of sugarcane, pervaded the streets outside the city. Behind the high walls, machines roared incessantly through the night.

This place was originally vast wasteland and farmland, with a dirt "official road" winding past the South Gate. Since the South China factory was built here, a large number of migrant workers had moved in, coupled with the endless stream of cane farmers coming to sell sugar every day, causing the area to suddenly flourish. At first, there were simple straw sheds selling tea and dry rations. After the market improved, merchants saw the opportunity and began buying land and building houses here, and various shops opened one after another. Outside the South Gate, a small district had formed.

The cane farmers changed their selling location, which also changed the direction of cash flow. The business of the merchants on Hai'an Street was not as good as before.

A night watchman carrying a lantern walked lonely through a narrow alley.

"The weather is dry, beware of fire—"

The sound of his clapper faded away with his voice.

"The watchman is gone, alert lifted!" In the darkness, several figures appeared from street corners, ditches, and behind vegetable garden fences.

They moved agilely, jumping out from their respective hiding spots. These men wore black hoods, black narrow-sleeved clothes in a short style, and all carried strange bundles on their backs. In their hands, they held short, thick stick-like weapons, raised to their shoulders, level with their eyes, assuming strange postures—some kneeling, some prone, forming a unique circular formation.

"Clear!"

"Kee-lear!"

"Kuh-lee-er!"

"Klee-ar!"

These few people whispered to each other in accents ranging from south to north.

The leader took out a strange object, placed it over his eyes to look at the street intersection; the other side of the object displayed a ghostly red glow.

"No heat signatures in the patrol zone, all clear."

"Move out!"

Faster than words could describe, the leader leaped, crossed the street in two or three steps, looked left and right under the high walls of the factory, meowed three long and one short times, then searched along the wall. Two others followed close behind, observed from under the wall, and signaled to the opposite side alley.

A few seconds later, people filed out of the alley and gathered together.

The leader raised his hand, waved left, then right, sometimes making an octopus shape, sometimes a chopping motion. He postured like a mime, while the surrounding men stared intently at his hands, nodding continuously. Finally, he waved downwards. Everyone stood up and split into three groups to act.

One group carrying large backpacks ran quickly to the small door at the base of the wall; another group scattered to keep watch. The third group threw grappling hooks to catch the top of the wall. The leader climbed up the wall in two or three moves. The top of the wall was embedded with dense broken porcelain shards, but these were useless against him. He squatted on the wall and observed for a moment longer. Confirming there were no people or dogs in the courtyard, he signaled everyone to proceed.

The rest quickly vaulted over the wall and swiftly opened a small door in the wall to let the others in. The leader looked at his watch and nodded in satisfaction. Just as they were about to advance further into the courtyard, two high-power flashlights lit up simultaneously.

"Alright, drop your weapons!" A voice came from under the eaves of the courtyard.

"You guys are too slow," the leader lowered the steel crossbow in his hand. "I'm already in the courtyard—"

"We knew you were coming when you ran out of the street intersection," Beiwei turned off the flashlight and walked out from the shadows. "'Clear' could have been shouted a bit louder."

The leader didn't blush at all, brazenly saying, "Training the team, you know, having some modern awareness."

"Formalism kills people," Beiwei said. "Come in."

The visitor was named Chen Sigen, dressed in standard Special Recon Team gear, tall and strong, with a back like a tiger and waist like a bear—a standard muscle man. He was a Doctor of Nutrition and had been a fitness coach. In the corrupt United States, he had become a firearms and free fighting enthusiast. Because of his specialty, he was absorbed by the military department as an instructor. Chen Sigen worshipped special forces all his life, so he often pestered Xue Ziliang and Beiwei to discuss "special tactics" and the like, and actively trained with the team. Relying on his extraordinary physical fitness and some foundation in shooting and fighting, he managed to earn a half-baked title of "Special Forces Soldier"—though Beiwei never admitted the Transmigration Group had any "Special Forces"; he only called himself a "Recon Soldier."

This time, he brought ten soldiers to reinforce Beiwei—the Executive Committee considered that Beiwei had only brought three or four men to Leizhou. The South China factory now had plenty of sugar and silver; if any situation arose requiring handling, the hastily formed militia would be useless.

These soldiers included Special Recon Team cadets and sharp soldiers draftees from various units for rotation training. They were the most elite soldiers of the indigenous troops.

"Let the soldiers shower and rest." Beiwei looked at everyone, covered in dirt and salt stains. "Tell Wen Qing to ask the kitchen to give them something to eat."

"How did you get here?" Chang Shide asked.

"By boat," Chen Sigen said nonchalantly. "After dark, we chose a desolate place, did an armed swim for 100 meters to shore. Then we walked about ten kilometers in the dark to find this place. Carrying gear, in the dark, with no road—this result isn't bad, right?"

Beiwei could only smile bitterly. It was completely dark after 7 PM, and now it was nearly 11 PM. Taking almost four hours to walk ten kilometers, even for night marching in mountains, wasn't a great figure.

"Of course, the speed was a bit slow," Chen Sigen said. "But we also brought a non-combatant."

As he spoke, a black-clad man came in panting like a bull. It was Xu Yingjie from the Industrial and Energy Committee. Running in the wild in the dark was a first for him. And for safety, he carried the box containing secret equipment himself—it didn't feel like much at first, but later became dead heavy.

Both men went to shower before returning to Beiwei's command post. Beiwei lit another candle laid out, and invited Chen Tianxiong over. Chang Shide sent A-Luo to bring a lot of food. Chen Sigen and Xu Yingjie were starving and wolfed down the simple food.

"How is the situation?" Chen Sigen asked.

Chen Tianxiong said, "We'll make a move very soon. You came just in time. I was worried Beiwei had too few men."

"We could only spare ten men," Chen Sigen said. "But Xu Yingjie brought you a lot of new equipment."

"Oh? What good stuff?"

"Old Xu!" Chen Sigen called out. "Show your treasures to everyone!"

Xu Yingjie grinned: "Don't look at my treasures, look at this." He opened two rattan suitcases placed under the table to show everyone.

"This is the latest emergency equipment kit designed by the Weaponry Group of the Industrial and Energy Committee." Speaking of this, Xu Yingjie turned his head and asked with a smile, "Chen Tianxiong, you've read 'The Deer and the Cauldron', right? You know Duke Wei's life-saving three-piece set?"

"The Invulnerable Silkworm Vest, the dagger that slices iron like mud, and the 'Holding Sand Shooting Shadows'?" Chen Tianxiong said, "If you don't count Shuang'er... Except for the messy hidden weapons, I've already prepared a set for myself. Has the Industrial Committee developed stab-proof vests?"

Xu Yingjie picked up an 18cm long tube from the box and said, "Since you already have a stab-proof vest, I won't introduce the chainmail. This is the sleeve arrow developed by the Weaponry Group. You must have heard of it. It holds 6 steel needles internally, can penetrate 2mm iron plate within 10 meters, powered by gunpowder. Very quiet."

"Gunpowder powered, do you light it with a fuse?"

"There is a small revolving igniter. Press it once to fire one shot. However, there is a delay after pressing, about two seconds..."

"No need to cock or recoil or anything?"

"Of course not, otherwise wouldn't it just be a pistol?" Xu Yingjie said. "The Weaponry Group developed this weapon with the premise of producing special ops equipment with minimal modern industrial requirements."

Chen Tianxiong's interest grew. He turned it over and over for a while and asked, "Where is the bullet casing?"

Chang Shide spoke up: "It's just like a Roman candle firework: ammo is loaded sequentially in a tube, separated by clay cakes."

"Old Chang, you know about this?"

"This idea was Wang Ruixiang's, right? He talked about it everywhere in Lingao; everyone in the New Army knows."

"Isn't that just an iron tube fire lance?" Chen Tianxiong said. "Putting it in my sleeve, I'd be afraid of blowing my arm off."

"It won't. The safety is very good. According to our tests, its success rate is as high as 87.53%!" He added, "Even if it explodes, it'll at most scorch some skin..."

"Alright, alright, stop blowing smoke. I definitely won't use this thing," Chen Tianxiong refused sternly.

Beiwei couldn't help saying, "Even if you guys aren't willing to make Derringers, at least make some flintlock pistols. What counts as this?"

Xu Yingjie didn't mind. He took out another bag and poured out several oval balls the size of pigeon eggs, wrapped in various colored papers. "This white one is a smoke bomb, yellow is sulfur, blue is tear gas, and red is the most dangerous—a small high-explosive grenade, exclusive to Intelligence and Special Recon teams! The power is relatively small, but definitely easier to use than the No. 1, 2, and 3 grenades equipping the New Army. Tear the outer package before use, light the black surface part with an open flame. It has a 5-second delay. This thing has a drawback: it must be kept dry. The packaging must remain intact. So," he pulled out a bamboo tube, "this is a dedicated storage container. Each tube holds three, and the lid gaps are sealed with wax."

"This is a bit like ninja equipment," Chen Tianxiong commented. "Just that lighting it is troublesome. Better than nothing."

"The real killer weapon is here!" Xu Yingjie took out a small rattan box from the backpack, carefully opened it. Inside were two porcelain bottles packed in pairs, surrounded by rice straw.

"Molotov cocktails." Xu Yingjie picked one up gently, saying with some pride, "I whipped this up. The main component is extracted from coal tar, similar to gasoline. It also has your factory's contribution—sugar added." Sugar was always one of the common ingredients in Molotov cocktail recipes.

The mouth of the porcelain bottle was stopped very tightly and sealed with wax.

"I added white phosphorus to this incendiary bomb. It catches fire when it smashes. No need to light a cloth strip beforehand. But be extremely careful normally! If it breaks, it's a disaster," he urged.

Finally, he took out a wine-bottle-shaped object from the box and said, "This is an epoch-making product, the ancestor of the RPG, a handheld shotgun cannon. Hardwood structure, 30-meter range, can create a kill zone of 5 meters radius, similar to a modern shotgun effect. Disposable. This is a brand new idea from the Weaponry Group! Impressive, right?"

"Japanese ninjas have a weapon called a 'hand cannon' (handheld ozutsu), which is about the same as yours."

"Is that so? We'll just exterminate the ninjas later," Xu Yingjie said nonchalantly.

"Is the structural strength of the shotgun cannon sufficient?"

Xu Yingjie nodded and said: "You can rest assured about this. It has enough strength for one shot."

Besides these, there were a dozen pyrotechnic signalers and illumination rockets. Though small, they were very useful. Seeing these things, Chen Tianxiong, besides lamenting everyone's creativity, could see that Lingao's industrial capability had stepped up another level. Many things required chemical products. It seemed the Industrial and Energy Committee was very diligent; engineering men were indeed pragmatic.
