# Chapter 90: Peace Negotiations (Part 2)

The Committee discussed the remaining two issues. Most felt not disturbing commoners was already their principle—agreeing or not made little difference. The main dispute was the second point: whether to release prisoners. Wu De and the Building Group firmly opposed—the former had just organized them, things were running smoothly; the latter's construction workload was heavy, and losing labor teams would severely impact efficiency.

Others also didn't want to give up these people. Finally, they decided to release only small landlords, rich peasants, and similar. They currently lacked sufficient incentive to attract such people's allegiance. Other prisoners would remain, to quickly build native auxiliary forces.

With this decision, Wu De worked overnight reviewing all prisoners, compiling a list of about a dozen releasable names—all major households or rich peasants. Keeping them was useless; better to release them for tangible benefits.

They also discussed various terms, setting negotiation conditions. Next day, Zhang Xingfu brought simple eight-item gifts—ostensibly thanking them for allowing body retrieval, actually to probe their intentions.

Xi Yazhou presented three demands:

1. Travelers may trade with locals anywhere in the county, freely exchanging any goods. Government and others must not obstruct.

2. Travelers may freely hire workers within the county.

3. Travelers shall have freedom of movement within the county.

He also stated that regardless of whether the county agreed to these three points, as a gesture of sincerity, they would release some people. He provided a preliminary release list for review and additions. If they wanted to take people immediately, release could happen now. Otherwise, bring sedans and animals tomorrow to receive them.

Zhang Xingfu naturally couldn't decide this himself. He copied the release list and conditions to take back.

Magistrate Wu Mingjin, receiving these conditions, was uncertain. Some matters were manageable, but some were significant—especially free trade. He vaguely felt this resembled conditions the "red-haired people" (Dutch) had demanded years ago when sending ships requesting open ports and trade. Were these people connected? He hurried to consult Secretary Wang.

Secretary Wang pondered, drank a pot of strong tea, then decided, whispering: "Your Honor, just agree."

Wu Mingjin shook his head: "I have two concerns. First, if they imitate the old Franks' trick, refusing to leave, using Bairren as city and Bopu as port—this place becomes a second Macao. The court absolutely won't permit it. Second, though hiring is free, when they eventually sail away, won't that be a sin of separating families?"

Secretary Wang smiled: "Your Honor worries too much. The urgent matter is appeasing the gentry and collecting autumn grain. After half a year or a year, work some connections in the provincial capital, get a transfer—whether it becomes Macao won't concern you then. As for separating families—hiring is voluntary. Those who serve such foreign barbarians, if taken overseas—that's their own doing."

Wu Mingjin thought it over. This was the only way. He summoned Zhang Xingfu, saying these matters could be agreed with the shaven-heads but must leave no written evidence. Zhang Xingfu understood. He then gathered family heads awaiting ransoms, asking them to prepare gratitude gifts.

These clans with captured members had been frantically seeking intermediaries, willing to pay silver for redemption—some prepared to bankrupt themselves for loved ones' lives. But this pirate group's origins were unclear; they couldn't establish contact. Now hearing ransoms weren't needed, people would be released tomorrow—asking any family to contribute an extra *liang* of silver was like flaying their skin. Each competed to claim poverty, describing themselves as raised on bitter herbs. Discussing past midnight, still no resolution. Zhang Xingfu grew angry, finally dropping pretenses, threatening: if they couldn't agree on a suitable amount, he wouldn't go to Bairren Rapids tomorrow. "Whoever wants their people can go themselves!" He made to storm off.

Nobody let him leave—all blocked him. County Vice-Magistrate Wu Ya joined in, pretending to mediate—good cop, bad cop. Finally, they agreed: six hundred *liang* silver, one hundred bolts Qiong-cloth, four pigs, one cow. Another thirty *liang* as Zhang Xingfu's commission. Silver and cloth were apportioned by household wealth. Everyone was satisfied with the total—ransoming would've cost three or four times more. After agreeing on figures, they worried whether Chief Xi would be satisfied. They decided Zhang Xingfu should go tomorrow, present the figures—if Xi Yazhou agreed, then send silver and cloth to receive people.

Next day, Zhang Xingfu brought sedans and animals to meet Xi Yazhou. He made many appeals about the families' hardships, then named the silver and cloth amounts. Xi Yazhou showed no displeasure at the low figure—even said appreciative words. Without waiting for county delivery, he directly released all small landlords and rich peasants.

This gesture further improved gentry's regard for them. Even ordinary commoners, learning of this, felt these pirates were righteous people. Hearing they never burned, killed, or plundered—the bolder ones left the city to return home. Fields still had work waiting. Within days, refugees in the county seat completely dispersed. From originally opening only the south gate for two or three hours, all three gates now opened. The month-long tension gradually faded. Days later, pedestrians reappeared on roads; farmers worked fields near Bairren Rapids.

"Peace is truly beautiful." Xiao Zishan stood on the watchtower, speaking rapturously.

"Peace is temporary," Beiwei said grimly behind him. His Hunting plan, after two adjustments, had been ready to launch—but this truce forced its suspension. These days, he drilled Ye Mengyan and the young men clamoring to be special forces with Monday-Sunday intensity. Daily, screams echoed from the training ground.

ATF's Xue Ziliang, painfully driving bulldozers, had also awakened to how to change his fate. He noticed Beiwei's training sessions and slipped to the training ground after work. Initially, Beiwei ignored him. But after Xue offered several very professional opinions during training, the two began exchanging views. Xue took the opportunity to demonstrate his skills—several beautiful tactical moves and excellent marksmanship made this former recon platoon leader take notice. Then he revealed his background: before joining ATF, he'd served in the US Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance and fought in the Iraq War.

"You see, I'm also a veteran." Xue Ziliang looked at Beiwei with lonely, affectionate eyes. Thus, the hearts of these two former reconnaissance soldiers—Chinese and American—resonated with understanding. Their expressions held such manly fortitude and tenderness that rumors of "Brokeback Mountain" spread among special-forces trainees that very day.

Subsequently, their training-ground exchanges intensified. Between peers—especially mutually respectful peers—there was much to discuss. Though the Military Group had many specialties, including armor and naval personnel, Beiwei was the only recon specialist. Apart from talking shop with former infantry officers like He Ming and Xi Yazhou, he had no one else. Now with Xue Ziliang, they had plenty to discuss—special operations, tactics, military issues—conversations deepened daily. Naturally, rumors spread faster.

Beiwei himself remained oblivious. When He Ming, as senior comrade, tactfully suggested that as a key Military Group leader, he should watch his private life's image—he was puzzled. How could someone who never gave women a second glance have lifestyle rumors? He even disapproved of Xi Yazhou being too friendly with women!

Only when the rumor finally reached his ears did he realize "private life issues" weren't limited to male-female relations. Face turning from red to blue to white, he stormed out. Xi Yazhou quickly followed with others, fearing he'd do something rash in the heat of the moment. After investigation, Beiwei announced in the special-forces training squad: each trainee would do two hundred extra push-ups after daily training—continuing until rumors about him and Xue Ziliang disappeared.

But this didn't affect his friendship with Xue Ziliang. Xue, with a Chinese-American's innate insight into human dynamics, had found his survival path in this once-alien environment.

For most transmigrators, the biggest change from local relations appeared on dining tables. When Wu Nanhai proudly wrote "Braised Pork" on the cafeteria's daily-specials blackboard, the newly-built counter was nearly knocked down by the rush.
