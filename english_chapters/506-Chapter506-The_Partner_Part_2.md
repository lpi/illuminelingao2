# Chapter 506 - The Partner Part 2

He explained that he had already identified a site for the coal mine, and as for buyers—there was no need to worry; the coal would not be sold locally but shipped elsewhere. The Hai family would have no involvement in the mine's management; they need only collect their share of the profits.

Seeing Lin's confidence, Hai Shuzu raised no further objections. Though many misgivings remained, the present circumstances allowed him no leisure for careful deliberation. On the spot, they drew up an agreement to jointly operate a coal mine.

In name, Hai Shuzu would be the principal investor, while Lin Baiguang's people would handle actual operations. The two parties agreed to settle accounts at year's end before distributing profits.

As for Hai Shuzu's current debts, Lin Baiguang expressed willingness to advance funds so he could settle them.

"This sum I will certainly repay," Hai Shuzu said quickly.

"No rush." Lin Baiguang knew the man was very proud. Having already accepted so much assistance, he was reluctant to take more of Lin's money. "Consider it an advance against your dividends. We can deduct it when we settle at the end of the year."

"At what rate of interest?"

"Ah, ah—that is far too formal." Lin Baiguang laughed. "I'm no moneylender; what would I want with interest? Let's hear no more of this."

Thus the Haikou Coal Mine project's letter of intent was signed. Time was of the essence. Lin Baiguang immediately cabled the Executive Committee, reporting that he had concluded a mining partnership with Hai Shuzu and requesting funds and specialized personnel to be dispatched to Qiongshan. When Ma Qianzhu saw that a long-planned scheme was finally taking shape, he promptly approved five thousand taels as start-up expenses and ordered the Long-Range Exploration Team to organize capable members and bring detailed documentation to Qiongshan for survey work. They already possessed extensive records on the location of coal deposits in the Haikou region; all that remained was to identify the most suitable extraction sites.

With silver in hand, Lin Baiguang sprang into action. First, he disbursed a portion to Hai Shuzu for settling losses with the shareholders. In actual terms, the aggregate shareholders' losses were not enormous—a little over one thousand taels. All claims were paid in full, and the troublemaking investors were finally pacified.

As for the household servants who had joined in the disturbances, after their debts were cleared each received an additional five taels and was politely shown the door. Hai Shuzu at last vented some of his resentment.

The families of the small peddlers who had died aboard the ship were also given modest sums—five or ten taels as condolence money. This was not, strictly speaking, the Hai family's responsibility; the relatives had created scenes merely in hopes of extracting a few taels for burial expenses. Now that silver had been given, further agitation risked trouble with the authorities. They, too, dispersed.

The entire Hai household regarded Lin Baiguang as a benefactor who had virtually restored them to life. Overcome with gratitude, Hai Shuzu offered to become sworn brothers.

For a man of Hai Shuzu's pedigree to propose sworn brotherhood with a newly arrived grain-shop proprietor from elsewhere was an extraordinary honor. Lin Baiguang understood that sworn brotherhood in ancient times carried profound obligations—effectively, Hai Shuzu had placed one foot aboard the transmigrated collective's "pirate ship."

Members of the Long-Range Exploration Team, now dressed in Ming attire—though still striking conspicuous figures—were escorted each day by Hai household servants, setting out early and returning late. Before long, they had identified several mining sites in Qiongshan County and marked out approximate land requirements. Hai Shuzu instructed his men to ascertain who owned the land.

"It shouldn't cost much—it's all wasteland," Hai Shuzu told Lin Baiguang. "If it's ownerless, we file at the county yamen, spend a little to purchase it, and that's that. If it has an owner, it will take a few more days' effort."

"No hurry—only let no word of this leak out."

"I understand." Hai Shuzu nodded. If people learned they intended to open a coal mine, landowners would sit back and drive up prices. "The servants I sent are hereditary household members—utterly trustworthy. Besides, I told them nothing." He hesitated a moment. "There is something that has been stuck in my throat for a while…"

"Please speak freely, elder brother."

It turned out Hai Shuzu had been fretting over appearances. How could a man who had been on the verge of fleeing his creditors suddenly pay off all his debts and even open a coal mine? What would people say? If anyone suspected him of engaging in some illicit scheme to obtain dirty money, he could not bear it.

Lin Baiguang thought: there really are people so fastidiously fearful of gossip. Self-discipline surely need not go this far. After a moment's reflection, he said:

"I understand you have a large ship that has yet to return?"

"Indeed—were it not for that ship, how could I have fallen to such a state! Come, let us drain this cup first." With his formerly bleak future suddenly bright, Hai Shuzu's mood had improved considerably. He directed the kitchen to prepare a few small dishes and decant a pot of home-brewed liquor.

Lin Baiguang was secretly pleased. Willingness to share a drink indicated affection—a sign their genuine rapport had deepened another step. He emptied his cup first to show sincerity. Though only country-brewed spirits, the liquor was unadulterated and quite mellow.

Hai Shuzu also drained his cup, then recounted the whole story from beginning to end. Lin Baiguang already knew it, of course. After listening, he feigned thoughtful deliberation before saying, "So now the ship is with the Australians in Lingao?"

"Exactly. They've even sent word inviting me to retrieve it. I wanted to go—perhaps I could recoup some losses." Hai Shuzu smiled bitterly. "But my mother and wife feared I would never return, so the matter has been delayed."

"In Guangzhou, I too have heard of the Australians. Though visitors from overseas, they are by and large a group of businessmen who play by the rules."

"So I've argued—since they've already secured the ship and its cargo, why would they bother taking me hostage? Besides, given the Australians' wealth, why would they care about my meager estate?" Hai Shuzu shook his head.

The phrase "given the Australians' wealth" gave Lin Baiguang a start. A reputation for riches was not a good omen. He quickly probed, "What makes you say the Australians are so wealthy?"

"How could you not know, living in Guangzhou? Australian goods are now famous far and wide—even this backwater of Qiongzhou has heard of them. A single small crystal mirror alone would be worth nearly half my family's fortune." Hai Shuzu spoke animatedly. "If not for my mother and wife's exhortations, I'd truly like to visit Lingao and see with my own eyes what these Australians look like, producing so many ingenious novelties." He sighed wistfully.

It appeared this man was not only upright but also deeply devoted to his family. Lin Baiguang's confidence that the transmigrated collective could firmly secure him grew. After all, the collective would soon need certain politically respectable banners.

"I happen to know several merchants who trade with the Australians—they're on very good terms with them. If it's inconvenient for you to go, I'll have someone handle it. Getting the ship back should pose no problem." Now that a connection had been established, there was no need for Hai Shuzu to come in person. They would simply release the ship directly.

In truth, even if the ship returned, factoring in cargo losses and indemnities, the shortfall could hardly be covered. Yet the ship's return at least provided a plausible story, sparing Hai Shuzu from suspicion that his money came from shady sources. Hai Shuzu was clever enough to catch on immediately. He understood that Lin Baiguang was helping him save face before the public—and quite possibly he would have to spend still more to reclaim the vessel. He said hurriedly:

"The costs you incur in retrieving the ship should be recorded as well; we can settle it together when dividends are distributed."

"What cost? If anything, we might even turn a small profit." Lin Baiguang reflected that the only pity was Hai Shuzu had not come to Lingao himself to witness the "new society" and "new order" firsthand. The propaganda value of the "admiralty court" precedent would be much diminished.

"Not at all—if the ship can be brought back safe and sound, that would already be an extraordinary blessing. Once it returns, I'll sell it immediately. I'm finished with this accursed maritime trade for good." Hai Shuzu still trembled at the memory.

Lin Baiguang instructed Chen Tong to return to Lingao once. Hai Shuzu assigned Hai Ji to accompany him. Among the household members who could read and were both reliable and reasonably young, only Hai Ji qualified.

Although the ideal scenario—Hai Shuzu himself arriving—had failed to materialize, the man known as "Ma Jia" at least had a representative to deal with. He processed the case according to the procedures he had drafted, item by item, issuing each document in meticulous order.

The case of Hai Shuzu's five-masted ship was a major one, involving not only the vessel but a multitude of goods and assets—some total losses, some partial, less a twenty-percent salvage fee. The assembled documents made up a volume as thick as a book.

Hai Ji was brought to the Admiralty Court to hear Ma Jia read the judgment. His heart pounded with anxiety. How much ransom would they demand before releasing the ship? Although Mister Lin had guaranteed the outcome and even sent Manager Chen along to assist, Hai Ji remained uneasy.

Ma Jia's torrent of technical jargon immediately overwhelmed him. Still, he managed to grasp a few key points: first, one-fifth of the ship and cargo's total value would be collected as a "ransom"—Hai Ji's mental framework had no category for "salvage fee"; second, the ransom could be offset by goods from the ship at appraised value; third, the Australians were prepared to purchase the cargo at market prices.

Hai Ji nodded to everything, of course. Though these Australians looked more or less like Ming subjects aside from their hair and clothing, in his mind they remained a pirate-like band. How could he dare utter a single "no"? He signed where told to sign and affixed his thumbprint where required. In the end, he received a stack of documents and 1,174 taels and four *qian* of silver—high-quality, full-weight ingots, packed in a specially made small chest.

"This is the proceeds from your ship's cargo after conversion. Please verify the amount," Chen Tong explained. "The salvage fee—one-fifth of ship and cargo—has already been deducted, along with storage fees for the interim. Here is the itemized statement."

Hai Ji stood there dumbfounded. The Australians were actually giving them silver! This exceeded all his expectations.

"The prices are based on Guangzhou market rates—don't think it too little," Chen Tong said with a smile.

"Not at all, not at all!" Hai Ji, as if waking from a dream, stammered, "I wouldn't dare!"

"Now for the ship," Chen Tong said. "Come with me."

*Note: I made an error—the Changchang Coal Mine near Haikou was actually in Ding'an County historically, over 120 *li* inland from Haikou. Development would pose major difficulties for the transmigrated collective. Here, we assume that in this novel's timeline, small coal deposits near Haikou are exploitable.*
