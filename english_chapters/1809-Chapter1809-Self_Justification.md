# Chapter 1809 - Self-Justification

Zhang Yunmi had her own ideas about work. Those ideas had never been about being someone's secretary—the secretarial work she'd been doing was only temporary, filling a personnel gap due to Liu Xiang's lack of suitable candidates.

Now the proposal in her hands was a cadre training school project. It would mainly recruit literate young people from Guangzhou, training them with some basic Council of Elders ideological and political concepts to address the immediate shortage of grassroots cadres.

"This is similar to the accelerated training classes in Lingao?" Zhang Yunmi asked.

"Similar in nature. But the training content will be simplified. No advanced courses at all—just basic public administration and policy education. Mostly preparing them for basic clerical work. If they show promise, they can be admitted to the National Academy for further advancement."

Zhang Yunmi asked several more questions, gaining a clearer understanding. This cadre training school would not only recruit students externally but also provide short-term training for existing staff—many of the current clerks and minor officials who had surrendered lacked systematic training. Cramming some Council of Elders ideology and administrative common sense into their heads could only help.

The position Liu Xiang wanted Zhang Yunmi to take was essentially school principal.

"So this work, would it count as 'practical'?" Liu Xiang asked.

"It does. Thank you, my lord." Zhang Yunmi showed a smile, but then frowned again: "But about this matter—given my background, would there be... some awkwardness?"

Liu Xiang knew what she meant. Zhang Yunmi was Lin Zhanbing's niece. Lin Zhanbing had been an Elder of the "reactionary" faction who had died in battle during the Guangzhou incident—neither martyr nor hero, a politically ambiguous death. Zhang Yunmi naturally fell under the shadow of this history.

"Your uncle's matter is your uncle's matter. You were barely connected to it. And I'm having you run a training school, not do intelligence work. There's nothing awkward about it."

Zhang Yunmi nodded. She had in fact already made up her mind, and was asking merely out of caution.

After Zhang Yunmi left with the document, Liu Xiang turned his attention to another matter: the "wind and dust industry rectification" that Lu Cheng had mentioned earlier.

This rectification work was led by Lu Cheng, but Liu Xiang had considerable involvement in the planning stages. Though the work seemed unseemly—and had indeed drawn criticism from some Elders as "beneath the Council's dignity" or "a waste of administrative resources"—Liu Xiang believed it was quite necessary.

The reason was simple: control. The pleasure quarters represented an enormous gray economy. Money changed hands, information circulated, and all manner of transactions occurred behind closed doors. Under Ming rule, powerful locals and yamen runners had maintained a kind of equilibrium with the brothel operators—corrupt, but stable. Now the Council of Elders had upset that balance. If they didn't move quickly to establish their own control mechanisms, chaos would fill the vacuum.

Beyond control, there was revenue. Vice taxation had been a significant income source in the Song dynasty. The Ming had largely abandoned it through incompetence. The Council of Elders intended to restore—and systematize—this revenue stream.

And there was the matter of public health. Venereal diseases spread through the pleasure quarters with abandon. The Ming had no concept of prevention or treatment. The Council of Elders had both the medical knowledge and the administrative capacity to address this—but only if they could actually get the women registered and examined.

Finally—and this was the part Liu Xiang found most compelling—there was the women themselves. Not all prostitutes were voluntary. Many had been kidnapped, tricked, or sold by desperate families. The registration system would provide opportunities to identify these victims and offer them alternatives.

"It's rather like dealing with organized crime," Liu Xiang had explained to a skeptical Ai Zhixin during the earlier meeting. "You can't just ignore it and hope it goes away. You have to engage with the reality as it exists."

"And make money from it?" Ai Zhixin had asked, not disapprovingly.

"And make money from it. And gain control. And improve conditions. All at once—that's the Council of Elders approach."

This afternoon, Ding Ding from the Propaganda Department arrived to discuss messaging around the rectification campaign.

"We need to explain this properly to the public," Liu Xiang said. "Not just announce it, but explain why."

"The current draft emphasizes order and taxation—"

"Too dry. People won't understand or care about taxation policy. What they'll see is the government taking over the brothels. We need to explain this is about protecting women, preventing disease, and eliminating exploitation by local strongmen."

"Protecting... prostitutes?"

"Protecting *people*. Many of whom were forced into this work against their will. The registration system is the first step toward giving them options."

Ding Ding looked skeptical but noted this down. Liu Xiang continued:

"The problem with our current propaganda is that it's all self-congratulation. 'The Council of Elders has achieved this' and 'The Council of Elders has accomplished that.' That's fine for internal morale, but it doesn't resonate with ordinary people. We need to explain our reasoning. Why are we doing this? What problem are we solving? How will it benefit regular citizens?"

"A more explanatory approach."

"Exactly. People aren't stupid. When they understand *why* we're doing something, they're more likely to cooperate. Just telling them *that* we're doing something makes us seem arbitrary and authoritarian."

"Even when the policy is objectively good?"

"*Especially* when the policy is objectively good. If we can't explain why our good policy is good, people will assume it's actually bad and we're hiding something."

This was a constant frustration for Liu Xiang. The Council of Elders had genuinely beneficial policies—public health, education, economic development—but the propaganda apparatus kept framing everything as "the great Council of Elders bestows blessings upon the grateful masses." This tone was both condescending and unconvincing.

"I'll revise the draft," Ding Ding said. "But I should mention—Director Qiu has his own ideas about messaging style."

"Director Qiu can have his ideas. I'm the one responsible for Guangzhou. Tell him if he has concerns, he can discuss them with me directly."

After Ding Ding left, Liu Xiang returned to his paperwork with a slight headache. Managing Guangzhou was exhausting enough without also having to manage the managers.
