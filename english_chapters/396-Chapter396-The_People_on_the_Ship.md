# Chapter 396 - The People on the Ship

"So they're from the same time-space."

"Nine out of ten." Lin Chuanqing lit a cigarette. Everyone fell into silent contemplation. Where did this ship come from? How did it cross time-space to arrive here? Was it wormhole disturbance, or was this sea area itself a wormhole—17th century above, 21st century below? Had others crossed over? Were they alive or dead? If alive, where were they now? How would they view this group of ambitious adventurers? Friendly or hostile...

A string of question marks swirled in everyone's minds, unanswerable.

After discussion, they decided to make more dives while daylight remained, thoroughly searching the ship.

Subsequently Zhou Weisen, Lin Chuanqing, and Gao Xiaosong took turns diving—Gao Xiaosong knew some snorkeling. They surveyed around the wreck, diving into the cabin. Except for locked compartments and the complex engine room terrain, Zhou Weisen had inspected nearly everything, retrieving more items.

During these dives they found human remains, fallen on the reef plate far from the wreck. Had sharks not torn the oilcloth wrapped around the body, they wouldn't have noticed. The corpse had been completely destroyed by sharks and marine life. Octopi and crabs were still feasting on it.

To uncover the truth, despite the nauseating task, they retrieved the remains.

Though some muscle and skin remained, the face was completely unrecognizable. But from remaining hair color, this was a Caucasian. The person was wrapped in marine oilcloth, feet weighted with two heavy dumbbells. Apparently a sea burial. This person was likely one of the shipwreck's passengers.

"Should we bring the remains back?"

"Absolutely—this is important evidence."

So they rewrapped the remains. Fortunately marine life had done most of the cleaning. After transport, examining the remains would be the Health Department's job.

They continued expanding the search around the wreck but found no more human remains. The reef plate's edges had some very deep trenches they couldn't search. One thing was certain: survivors had left after burying the dead at sea. Zhou Weisen noticed one of two sampans on deck was missing; some cabin equipment showed signs of removal. Combined with no large-scale oil leakage, the ship was apparently scuttled after exhausting fuel. Why they did this was unknown.

"The ship had at least one person, at most eight." Lin Chuanqing deduced.

Gao Xiaosong said: "A sampan holds at most eight?"

"Yes, and I think there were only two or three people when abandoning ship—otherwise it's hard to explain not taking more useful supplies. In an emergency, shouldn't you take as much as possible? If it were me, I'd take both sampans. Two people per sampan could carry much more."

"Clearly another group arrived in this time-space, likely Americans." Gao Xiaosong summarized. "We must heighten vigilance. They scuttled the ship clearly not wanting discovery. The upright positioning probably facilitates future salvage."

"Could be time-travel management bureau people."

"The time-travel management bureau would be American-run? At least it'd be a UN organization."

Whether the arrivals were time-travel bureau or random entrants like the Ming family in the Qiongzhou Strait, others from their time-space had arrived. What they intended, how the transmigrator collective would handle them—that wasn't for Gao Xiaosong's group to consider.

However, everyone agreed: this ship should be salvaged. Repaired, it would be a decent vessel.

Bai Guoshi said: "This ship's displacement is about 100 tons—no worse than the Navy's 8154 fishing trawlers. The hull's intact. Restoration shouldn't be difficult. Plus the ship has many useful materials. Soaking in seawater too long would ruin them."

After returning to Lingao, the survey team submitted two reports and attended two briefings. One was for the weekly gazette—per Xiao Zishan's suggestion, the Executive Committee now issued an internal government gazette weekly, reporting the week's major events and departmental operations. A demonstration of "open governance."

The gazette report covered the Dongsha Island survey. The other was their shipwreck report—currently top secret, known only to the involved parties and key Executive Committee leadership.

Ma Qianzhu soon received another report. This one was personally delivered by Ran Yao—a surveillance report on Zhou Weisen and Lin Chuanqing written by a survey team transmigrator. The report clearly stated: they showed no abnormalities throughout the survey.

Ran Yao waited as Ma Qianzhu read, then fell into contemplation for several minutes before reminding: "Director! Finished reading?"

"Hmm? Finished." Ma Qianzhu showed a relaxed expression. "This is best!"

"Yes, I personally also believe the North American members are above suspicion."

Ma Qianzhu nodded, held the report to a gas lamp and lit it, watching it turn to ash. Ran Yao relaxed—he'd planned to retrieve and destroy that paper.

Subsequently a secret meeting was held with the survey team. Bai Guoshi's proposal for complete salvage was rejected. Though the repaired ship would be extremely useful, regarding salvage, Wang Luobin saw no difficulty—since the hull structure was well-preserved and water was shallow, the Industrial Committee could definitely raise it completely.

But once the ship was raised and towed to Bo-pu, the secret of an "unplanned" ship arriving in this time-space couldn't be hidden from anyone. After careful consideration, the Executive Committee decided to maintain secrecy.

"We'll salvage useful materials and equipment from the ship in batches." Ma Qianzhu said. "According to the survey report, many abandoned items inside will be wasted soaking too long."

"Food, medicine, tools, small equipment—all useful to us."

"Might even fish out crates of heroin, cocaine, or marijuana."

"Too bad these things are useless to us—if only it were an arms smuggling ship."

If it were an arms smuggling ship, it would certainly have large quantities of weapons and ammunition. Though they didn't feel short on small arms, having an AK-47 or similar automatic weapon would be quite exciting.

"Finding portable anti-aircraft missiles would be depressing."

"Hahaha." Laughter filled the meeting room.

"Aren't you celebrating too early?" Wen Desi said slowly. "What about the people on the ship? Don't forget this key issue."

"Not a big problem." Ran Yao said. "The survey team believes so few people were aboard that they could only take one sampan. They didn't take many useful supplies—obviously lacking manpower. A few isolated transmigrators, even if not drowned, won't make big waves."

"Could other ships have been together?"

"Extremely unlikely—otherwise, abandoning so many things on the wreck would be too wasteful. Even if they didn't know they were in another time-space, during maritime emergencies, more food and medicine is always better."

"I'm not worried they'll become a force—we five hundred, thoroughly prepared, have only achieved this small situation. They with just a few people can do even less. The key concern is them joining an opponent. Then our cards would be completely exposed. That's most critical." Wen Desi was very concerned about this.

"Nothing we can do—completely beyond our control. We can only order heightened vigilance. Anyone suspicious should be captured or immediately—killed—" Ma Qianzhu said gravely.

Just then, Shi Niaoren arrived at the meeting room with an autopsy report.

"The body found by the survey team near the wreck, after our examination: male, age between 35 and 40, Caucasian; retrieved hair remnants are brown. Height 1.87 meters, extremely developed musculature; estimated weight around 100 kilograms."

"A big man—"

"Correct. The following should be more interesting." Shi Niaoren said. "Based on skeletal and remains analysis, this person suffered multiple injuries during life, including gunshot wounds..."

"Shot to death?"

"No—the gunshot wounds are old. Based on bone healing, it happened many years ago."

...

In summary: the deceased was a prime-aged man, tall and muscular, with multiple past injuries. Shi Niaoren believed: this was probably a soldier.

"At least someone who dealt with danger." Ran Yao said. "Should be military or law enforcement."

"The time-travel management bureau would also be law enforcement."

"Let's drop the bad jokes."

Ran Yao suddenly remembered something.

"Does everyone remember an incident reported by our observation post outside the county seat during the days after D-Day?"

"What?"

"Among Ming troops heading to reinforce the county, they were escorting a European prisoner."

"Don't remember. Was there such a thing?" Everyone pricked up their ears.

"Of course." Ran Yao said. "Li Jun and Wei Aiwen witnessed it. Their report should be in the archives."

"Get it immediately!"

This report contained scant information about the matter—merely noting a European-looking prisoner in the column. No details whatsoever.

"This happened! Is the person still in Lingao county prison?" Wen Desi exclaimed after reading.

"Haven't asked—"

"Have Xiong Buyou immediately go to town and investigate. Is this European still in Lingao? Did he bring anything? What did he say? Where is he now..."

"Director Wen, don't get so excited." Wu De counseled. "You're forgetting—the timeline doesn't match."

According to Ran Yao, the European was sighted just days after D-Day. This location was far from Dongsha Islands. Even if the European-looking person came from the ship, he couldn't possibly have arrived at Lingao to be captured that quickly.

"Time-space disturbances are unpredictable!"

At Wen Desi's insistence, Xiong Buyou—currently teaching Mandarin at the Citizen Academy while also learning dialects—was suddenly assigned this task, momentarily confused about what was happening. He didn't recall any European in the county!

Xiong Buyou now worked for the Foreign Commerce Committee, specifically liaising with Lingao County Yamen. Recently he'd been diligently studying Ming-era county administration procedures, preparing to "take over tax collection" when the time came, and eventually the yamen itself. For this purpose, he'd been frequently contacting various yamen personnel, occasionally dispensing small favors. After several months, he knew everyone well.

For this matter, he directly approached the county yamen's jailer. The jailer confirmed: indeed, when they arrived, a Westerner had been escorted in by a patrol deputy—found at the coast, they said. After arrival, he'd been jailed in the county yamen.

"Is he still there?"

"Long gone—sent directly to the prefectural capital. Probably a redhead from Macau who fell overboard in a shipwreck."

"Did he have any belongings or clothes?"

"What could survive falling into patrol deputy hands?" The jailer sneered. "Besides, being fished from the sea, he likely didn't even have intact clothing, let alone possessions."

As for his origins—Lingao County had no interpreters. The redhead couldn't speak Chinese, so naturally there were no interrogation records.

Xiong Buyou's investigation disappointed the Executive Committee—this person probably wasn't a sailor from the wreck.

The shipwreck salvage plan was approved. Lin Chuanqing's group remained in charge. For salvage safety, the Executive Committee dispatched a fishing trawler for the mission. The ship also carried necessary salvage materials and equipment. All crew were carefully selected, guaranteed absolutely reliable and tight-lipped.

Fu Buer emerged from the Heaven and Earth Society office building in a daze, mind still not quite processing—had he done the right thing or wrong?

Because he'd only declared fifty *mu* when registering, he'd been classified as "middle peasant" during customer segmentation. At the promotion meeting, watching neighboring village landlords with even less land sign service contracts—the Society's Australians would visit villages with seeds and farming assistance—he'd only received a voucher for ten chicks, some kind of contracted poultry farming. This alarmed him—chickens, he had dozens already in his yard! Did he need to borrow chicks like some poor barbarian? Australian seeds were what mattered.

He rushed to ask the Society clerk.

"That's correct," the clerk said. "You only have fifty *mu*—just a middle peasant. The seeds you want are for planting technology services, currently only available to grain households owning over 100 *mu* who personally manage cultivation."

Fu Buer didn't understand "middle peasant," but understood that his land area was insufficient. Momentarily speechless, he stammered that he actually had a hundred *mu*, not just fifty—actually he owned two hundred *mu*.

"Then bring your deed first—talk is cheap."

Fu Buer returned home to another tongue-lashing from his wife, accusing him of being blinded by lamp oil, determined to jump into fire pits. Being some representative wasn't enough—now he wanted to give his land away to the Shorn Bandits for free. This quarrel actually steeled his resolve to gamble—he brought his deeds to the Society for verification.

"Two hundred twenty-seven *mu*." The clerk verified the deeds. "All self-farmed? None leased out?"

"All cultivated by myself with household servants and hired hands." Fu Buer answered.

"Good, just sign this contract."

Fu Buer was illiterate, so the clerk read it aloud. Essentially a contract specifying rights and obligations. Seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides from the Society were all charged by quantity, plus technical service fees. This fee and that fee—Fu Buer wanted to back out. Finally hearing that the first year was promotional—except for seeds and service fees, everything else was waived—he relaxed and signed. Thinking: once I get seeds the first year, I won't participate in this Heaven and Earth Society nonsense again.

Also joining the Society was county notable Zhang Youfu. Zhang Youfu was now a Civil Affairs Committee consultant, receiving monthly consultant stipends. By traditional classification, Zhang Youfu was a collaborator lackey, specifically advising the Civil Affairs Committee when dealing with locals. Wu De watched him closely, giving him no real title, not letting him act independently, lest this man pull "fox borrowing tiger's might" stunts and misbehave—damaging the transmigrator collective's reputation.

Zhang Youfu didn't own much land and had no enthusiasm for farming. He'd been recruited to the Society by Wu De—he didn't care. Anyway, he always left farming to hired hands. If Australians wanted to run some Heaven and Earth Society helping with farming, fine.

Besides them, various local medium and small landlords and rich peasants joined. Most owned between 100 and 300 *mu*. Unsurprisingly, most county landlords were suspicious—many inquired about buying seeds, but upon hearing Society membership was required for technical services, they retreated. The first batch of planting service customers totaled only eleven households. One of them was unexpected—the county academy's educational officer.

No one expected the academy's educational officer, an old pedant, to do something so bold. Actually, he was desperate and had no choice.

County Educational Officer Wang Ci was an old *xiucai*, holding this "impoverished post" for many years. Ming-era Lingao's education was relatively developed for Hainan—besides the county academy, there were two private "study halls." The famous Moli Pavilion study hall by Wenlan River dated to the Song Dynasty. Rural private schools were also common. But the county academy's condition was quite poor.
