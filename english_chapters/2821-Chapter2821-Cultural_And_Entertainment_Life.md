# Chapter 2821 Cultural And Entertainment Life

At this moment, all that glory was still on paper. Even those close to the Senators couldn't predict the future prosperity of this place. To them, the present prosperity and wealth were already unprecedented.

Under the arcade, eating ice cream, enjoying a rare holiday—this relaxed and joyful feeling stuck clearly in Zahra's memory even many years later. Especially the sensation when she first put ice cream in her mouth. Unlike the simple freshness of a popsicle, this soft new thing had a rich milky fragrance and melted instantly on the tongue. The coolness mixed with sweet fragrance made her almost immediately addicted. Her first thought was to bring Shanshan-jie and the children here to eat together. The only annoyance was the occasional dripping meltwater, forcing her to twist her body to dodge it several times.

The two girls enjoyed their first-ever ice cream while following the map, turning into Baihui Street. In the Senate-approved East Gate Market plan, Baihui Street was positioned as a "concentrated exhibition and gathering area for new cultural arts and lifestyle." Hence, there were many things here that even local residents found incredibly novel. For example, the "Central Experimental Theater" on Baihui Street, directly facing the new Cooperative General Society building.

As the name suggested, this was the dedicated theater for the Senate's most important professional arts troupe, the "Central Experimental Art Troupe." The building was similar to the Data Center, in the so-called typical "Chinese-yet-new" style, designed by Mei Wancao, General Manager of Lingao Construction and Director of the Central Architectural Design Research Institute. Clear-water blue bricks filled the spaces between soaring wrought-iron framework, but the eaves adopted quite traditional flying bracket structures. Half of the architectural community criticized it as "neither fish nor fowl," while the other half praised it highly.

Debates aside, the theater was ultimately built. The entire building was about four or five stories high. At the front were three consecutive seven-step staircases, each landing five or six meters wide, finally converging at a height about one and a half stories above the surrounding buildings. Here, a row of wide floor-to-ceiling doors allowed audiences to enter and exit.

Unlike the Data Center's austere simplicity, on the street-facing front wall of the Central Experimental Theater, four huge colorful billboards faced each other. The first showed a silhouette of an orchestra against a background of flowers and moon, with giant text announcing a folk music concert called "Full Moon and Flowers" at month's end. Next came the twice-daily news documentary *Guangdong and Guangxi Under the Morning Star* and the once-daily "traditional opera" *Overflowing Joy*.

The westernmost billboard was slightly unnerving: against a forest of trees with hanging corpses, silhouettes of a man and woman strode resolutely toward the Morning Star suspended in the sky. The text below announced that an all-new stage play version of *The Trial* would begin weekend performances starting next month.

Zahra had never seen a performance here. Looking at these shows made her heart itch. She hoped someday to have enough leisure time to come see a show. After all, as maids, their entertainment mostly followed the Senators' hobbies, and the Senators' abundant otaku tendencies made entertainment either too indecent or dull as dishwater.

Since the Experimental Art Troupe included folk music, symphony, drama, opera, and other art forms, the Senators' planning required multiple specialized theaters—quite a spectacular undertaking. But limited by current financial and material resources, only Phase One was now completed and operational. Besides necessary rehearsal rooms and functional spaces, the core was a medium-sized theater with fewer than six hundred seats, usable for stage plays or instrumental performances, also serving as a backup venue for Senate plenary sessions. For this purpose, the Planning Commission generously approved installation of a sound system brought from the old timeline.

Since the reserved land for future Phases Two and Three was very large and currently covered with lush greenery, the Experimental Theater looked like it had a large garden. Even after subsequent construction was completed and the theater was officially named the "Imperial Theater," this remained a famous downtown garden, attracting countless tourists and audiences.

Across the road from the big garden, where the girls were walking, was a structure with three visible floors and four actual. The front had a portico design like old-timeline hotels, large enough to accommodate two or three carriages. Through the bright glass doors, one could see the full-height lobby inside, with the atrium extending from floor to ceiling on the third floor. From a thick main beam at the third-floor ceiling hung multiple chandeliers and a huge painting of sixteen girls in plaid skirts.

On the side of this building hung a large vertical sign: "Checkered Skirt Club East Gate Theater." Yes, this was the new home base of the Checkered Skirt Club gentlemen. Since quite a few Senators had reservations about the ACG culture it represented, the Checkered Skirt Club ultimately lost out to the classic arts line represented by the Central Experimental Art Troupe, and its application to build a dedicated theater was rejected by the Senate. Just as the Senators faced difficult choices, an unexpected benefactor arrived: Ziming House.

The so-called "Checkered Skirt Club East Gate Theater" was actually the former Ziming House Lingao branch.

With the coming into operation of the Heyuan Street entertainment district, according to National Police unified planning, all businesses involving romantic services had to relocate there. This regulation put considerable pressure on the Ziming House branch originally located on the commercial district's main road. Considering the need to maintain Bairen Town's overall image, the Commercial Department was willing to cooperate positively. They had originally considered keeping this prime location while stripping out the relevant services. But the problem was: what would attract customers to a Ziming House without its core business? Though the well-received dining and other legitimate services could continue, the appeal after stripping out core services was clearly insufficient, and separation would greatly impact the brand.

After much deliberation, the Commercial Department decided to relocate Ziming House entirely. Just then, the Checkered Skirt Club's application was rejected. Senator Wu Ciren, as an important member of the club's Senator group and working for the National Police, knew of Ziming House's relocation dilemma and got ideas about the property. Thus, the Commercial Department seeking new growth points and the club gentlemen urgently looking for a venue connected. Both sides hit it off, agreeing to jointly hold shares and transform the vacated Ziming House into this timeline's first IDOL theater.

The specific method was for the original Checkered Skirt Club Senators to take the lead, officially registering a commercial performance company with the Planning Commission, then jointly investing with Ziming House Entertainment Ltd. to formally establish an entertainment agency. The Checkered Skirt Club became the first performing group under this agency.

Since the original Ziming House design already included performance functions, the renovation went quite smoothly. The original spa pool area was expanded into a stage, with part converted into an orchestra pit. The lobby was fitted with tiered seating custom-made by the woodworking factory, providing about 150 seats and 60 standing spots. The massage rooms on the surrounding gallery walkway were converted into private boxes, where one could watch performances while dining—not only giving the gentlemen prime viewing spots but also available for priority use by former Ziming House members.

An amusing incident occurred here: when widening the original small stage, two pillars couldn't be removed due to structural limitations. The Checkered Skirt Senators didn't mind, instead seeing it as representing a certain karmic fortune, just like the old timeline. They decided to imitate the old timeline by organizing a fan club called the "Pillar Society." Due to pronunciation issues, it was often misheard as "Pearl Society," leading to the Checkered Skirt Club's best-selling merchandise becoming bracelets of sixteen glass beads.

The original Ziming House design included ground-source air conditioning and ventilation, making this theater the first air-conditioned theater in this timeline—much to the gentlemen's excitement. But compared to the old timeline, stage lighting became a major problem. The gentlemen begged high and low, promising countless favors allegedly including certain services, finally obtaining assistance from Senators in the Mechanical and Optical departments. Using combinations of multiple electric lights plus lenses, though incomparable to old-timeline LEDs and disco balls, they achieved quite stunning effects. Sonya didn't know that her master, Senator Lin, had played a major role in this design and had accepted related hospitality multiple times.

The original Ziming House dining portion was also adjusted. The formal dining section was removed, replaced by sales of snacks like cold drinks, sweets, pastries, and light fare. Adjacent to the performance venue, a café and this timeline's first dedicated dessert shop were added. Due to the novel concept and fine preparation, these unexpectedly received praise and recognition from various sectors and former members. The ice cream the girls had just eaten was actually a new cold drink originally developed at the commission of the new dessert shop. Only when the results proved good did it enter wider retail channels.

Meanwhile, with the continuous introduction of foreign maids, the gentlemen also got ideas in this direction. Though the Checkered Skirt Club's audience was currently limited, rumors said an all-foreign official rival team was already in closed training. This series of changes only increased the club's popularity, achieving the new management team's original goals. Of course, fans of Australian erotic arts needn't be sad. In the industrial zone near Heyuan Street, a new Ziming House flagship store would soon rise from the ground.
