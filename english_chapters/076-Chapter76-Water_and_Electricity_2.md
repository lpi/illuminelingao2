# Chapter 76 - Water and Electricity (2)

He didn't have a very deep impression of Zhuo Tianmin. Remembered he had a son, and once came to the Executive Committee to find Xiao Zishan, asking him to approve a note for Wu Nanhai to give him an egg—for his son to eat—eggs were currently the most scarce thing, only three or four a day, generally only supplied to the sick.

He looked about thirty-five or thirty-six years old, wearing training clothes covered with stone powder and mud, pointing at that newly built pressure pool, not looking at anyone, saying: "...According to the design drawing: the floor of the intake chamber should be higher than the floor of the forechamber. But now it's built to be the same height."

People from the engineering team surrounded him, all silent. Mei Wan was a bit impatient: "It's just a difference of a few centimeters, what's the big deal? If everything has to strictly follow the design drawing, this would be a jerry-built project."

"That was a substitute measure due to lack of materials, nothing could be done about it," Zhuo Tianmin heard him say this, anger coming from nowhere, "This pressure pool didn't use any less cement, stone, and yellow sand. Why not do it according to the drawing?"

"The people in the engineering team didn't understand the drawing, didn't pay attention..." Bing Feng tried to smooth things over.

"This makes even less sense. The ones working are green hands, not professional workers, the responsibility is not on them, this is true. We all eat the rice of engineering construction, are you embarrassed to say such a low-level mistake?" People around were whispering.

Several professionals blushed. Mei Wan couldn't refute him either, so he had to say: "Then what do you say we should do?"

"Smash it and redo it according to the drawing dimensions."

"Not only wasting materials, but also delaying the construction period!" Mei Wan almost jumped up, "Besides, you are not from a hydropower background either. Do you know why the pool needs to be made with different heights front and back? Things on the drawing may not necessarily be right. There are many such cases."

"I indeed don't know, but precisely because we don't understand, we can't be ambiguous about the drawing at all."

At this time, someone discovered Wang Luobin and said: "Committeeman Wang is here!"

Hearing Wang Luobin came, Zhuo Tianmin turned around and looked. Wang Luobin was indeed standing in the crowd. He nodded politely to Wang Luobin and stopped talking.

"Engineer Zhuo, please continue."

"I've said everything I wanted to say, and I indeed don't understand hydropower construction either. Committeeman Wang, you decide." Zhuo Tianmin said coldly. He wanted to see how much level this committee member of the Executive Committee actually had. Everyone's eyes were focused on Wang Luobin.

Wang Luobin walked around the pool once, and measured the depth of various parts with a rod ruler. After checking, he asked Zhuo Tianmin for opinion: "Engineer Zhuo, what do you think is best?"

Zhuo Tianmin said: "Not constructing according to the drawing means the quality is unqualified. fooling around is okay, just afraid there will be problems later."

Wang Luobin turned to ask Mei Wan: "What do you think?"

Mei Wan thought for a while and said: "There is indeed a discrepancy with the drawing, but now materials are scarce, and we have to catch up with the date. I think we can make do with it! Change it later when conditions allow."

This proposal was approved by some of the Architecture Team personnel.

Wang Luobin nodded and said: "If reworking, some cement and steel bars will be wasted, and the time for power generation and grid connection will be delayed, but this matter cannot be made do with."

He pointed to the pool: "The width and depth of the forebay pressure pool must be larger than the channel, so as to slow down the flow speed after the water enters the forebay, so that the sediment in the water will settle down. This is the first step. The bottom of the intake chamber being higher than the forechamber is to prevent the sediment that has already settled from rushing into the pressure water pipe. Ensure the safe operation of the turbine."

Mei Wan knew that he had misunderstood the Executive Committee's meaning on this matter again. The experience of building roads made him think that the Executive Committee mainly looked at engineering speed, so this time he insisted on progress priority. Seeing the people of the construction team staring at him with big eyes and small eyes, he waved his hand grumpily:
"Stop looking, quickly smash the problematic parts, rework!"

The construction team jumped into the pool and smashed the places to be reworked with eight-pound hammers. Concrete blocks peeled off and fell. Wang Luobin felt a pang of distress. Cement, this thing, who knows when it can be made. The long-range reconnaissance team was sent out precisely to find various resources. Now they have been gone for almost a week. Although there is radio contact every day, the resource exploration situation has not been reported back...

Zhuo Tianmin stood aside watching Wang Luobin, seeming to know Wang Luobin only today. Usually, his impression of these committee members was amiable and slick. Xiao Zishan was typical of this kind, never saying a word that makes you unhappy, but you can't distinguish his attitude towards a certain matter. Even if acting as a decision-maker in some disputes, he would use a set of rhetoric to make everyone feel not losing face—he admired such people very much, but at the same time looked down on them, feeling that this is a survival method that people without professional skills would engage in.

How could he not know that after speaking up several times in the Architecture Engineering Group, he had become Mei Wan's taboo? But he didn't care at all—didn't he bring his son here just to leave that hypocritical and empty living environment? If he arrived in another space-time and still had to continue doing that set, then why did he come?

The wind was strong. Trees with soft branches shook vigorously. The vegetation at Bairen Beach was maintained better than other places. The woods on the continuous low hills nearby were dense, and waves of tree rustling came with the wind. The wind suddenly became stronger, and the weather also turned gloomy, looking like it was going to rain. After the reworked parts were smashed, Mei Wan immediately reorganized the forces and personally led the engineering team to rush repairs. The work of pouring concrete had to be completed before the rain. Wang Luobin also assisted in cleaning up the debris on the construction site. He pondered while working. Just as President Wen talked with him in private, things in the group were not as simple as imagined. From the perspective of his organization and arrangement of construction these days, obviously there were already cracks inside the Architecture Team.

After re-pouring the concrete, installation of the water turbine began immediately. The installation requirements for the water turbine are relatively high; leveling is required, and it is best to hoist it in place at one time. Mei Wan transferred that truck crane. After an afternoon of tossing, the water turbine was finally hoisted in place. Because there were no bricks and tiles available for the generator room, a shed was temporarily built as a cover.

The engineering team braved the drizzle to clean up the crushed stones and garbage on the construction site, installed the diversion channel gate, and finally completely dug open the earth and stone at the intake. The curved wooden gate played its role; water did not rush in. Now just wait for the concrete to dry completely to generate electricity.

This small hydropower station with a head of 20 meters and a water flow of two cubic meters per second can provide 200KW of electricity for the base. The future long-term plan is to reach a power generation capacity of 1000KW with 5 units.

Because two generators will generate electricity simultaneously soon, the original simple mode of pulling wires for power supply has to be changed. Chang Kaien planned to establish a new power grid system. The system was purchased as a complete set. This power grid will use 110 kV high-voltage transmission, while power consumption will use industrial 380 volts and civilian 220 volts. These are all ready-made voltage standards in this space-time, and also meet the power consumption needs of various mechanical equipment they brought.

For safety reasons, Mei Wan originally intended to install the transmission lines of the power grid underground, but there were no suitable corrosion-resistant cable conduits, so overhead transmission with electric poles continued to be adopted. Fortunately, the total length of the line from the hydropower area to the main urban area was only 100 meters, completely within the line of sight. If necessary, a city wall can be used to connect the two areas, but there is no such need for the time being.

With electricity, the next project is the water supply system. The water quality of the Wenlan River is mainly polluted by wastewater and waste from upstream county residential areas and farmland, so the organic content is relatively high, with many algae, but the sediment content is small. For such water quality, simply relying on traditional sediment precipitation and disinfection methods is not enough. Algae will bring an unpleasant smell, which cannot be covered even by the smell of chlorine. When the blue-green algae outbreak occurred in the Wuxi section of Taihu Lake, the water quality from the waterworks was completely qualified in physical and chemical standards, but the smell could never be eliminated.

As a professional in water supply and drainage, Tian Jiujiu, after inspecting the hydrological terrain, decided to adopt an infiltration intake—river water enters the reservoir through the infiltration of riverside soil. Water obtained in this form is usually not polluted and does not require much treatment.

The simplest mode is to dig infiltration wells. However, Tian Jiujiu considered that the number of people to be supplied was large, and modern people's living habits also consumed a large amount of water. So the slightly more complex infiltration gallery water supply system was adopted.

First, at a place 15 meters along the river, parallel to the river bank, a water collection pipe trench is excavated. The excavation depth of the water collection trench should be 1 meter lower than the lowest water level line. Inside the pipe trench is a filter bed composed of multiple layers of sand, gravel, and small crushed stones of different specifications. A water collection pipe is buried in the middle of the filter bed. This kind of pipe is generally made of perforated PVC plastic pipes with a diameter of 50-100mm in modern times. Tian Jiujiu didn't have this kind of PVC plastic pipe, so concrete pipes were used. 200mm diameter round logs were used as inner molds, and cast in place after mixing gravel, fine sand, and cement. This kind of pipe does not need to be too dense, but requires loose and porous, and the pipe joints do not need to be sealed—so that groundwater entering the water collection trench can infiltrate into the pipe. The entire pipe trench is covered with soil of no less than 30mm thickness.

Finally, at the north end of the pipe trench, at the lowest terrain, a clear water well is built with concrete mortar masonry. The clear water infiltrated into the water collection pipe eventually flows here to settle. The Architecture Engineering Group made a reinforced concrete cover for this well. The settled clear water is pumped into the elevated water tower. The base of the water tower is built with stones and cement mortar, on which a ten-ton water tank removed from the ship is installed. The outside of the water tank is coated with a layer of cement mortar for waterproofing and rust prevention. An ozone generator is installed outside the water tower. This device uses a high-frequency electronic device to generate ozone for sterilization. Ozone sterilization effect is not worse than chlorine, and does not require complex electrolysis devices and pipelines, nor does it cause much harm to the human body. Before the electrolysis salt device is launched, this thing can last for a long time.

To guard against typhoons, the entire high tower water tank is firmly braced on the ground with thick marine cables. The main water transmission pipeline leading to the main urban area is made of PVC material. Because the Architecture Team's grand underground municipal hidden ditch project has not yet started, this water transmission pipeline is temporarily buried in a shallow trench.
