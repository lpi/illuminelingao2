# Chapter 129 - Human Market (1)

Except for Xiao Zishan, none of the people present had engaged in trans-temporal trading activities. Seeing this so-called "Crystal Rosy Jade Mirror," which was clearly just a plastic-framed oval mirror made in Wenzhou sold in piles at the small commodity market—the best quality one costing no more than ten yuan—selling for one hundred and fifty taels here!

Guo Yi and others saw someone buying a glass mirror with so much silver for the first time. They were so shocked that their mouths opened and eyes stared, and they couldn't help shaking their heads. They couldn't accept it for a moment. Xiao Zishan whispered: "How about it? Have confidence now? Guangzhou is different from other areas; it is the richest city in East Asia in this time and space."

Yan Maoda nodded and said with emotion: "Really didn't expect Guangzhou to be so prosperous in this era. I also have confidence in opening a jewelry company here."

A shop assistant came over to greet them. Yan Maoda wanted to test the market, so he asked him to bring out pearls—the transmigrators brought a large number of freshwater cultured pearls from another time and space—the assistant took out several trays of pearls from the cabinet. The largest was about an inch in diameter, and the smallest was like pomegranate seeds. Most were round, and some were oval. Even with limited light in the room, the brilliance of the pearls in the tray could still be felt.

Small ones cost ten or twenty taels each, and the largest one surprisingly asked for four thousand taels. Yan Maoda knew a little about the history of pearls in the jewelry industry in the past and knew that past dynasties valued pearls very much. Moreover, these were all natural pearls, very rare. But he was still shocked that a big pearl could sell for four thousand taels.

However, the most peculiar one was a tray of slightly oval purple pearls. Yan Maoda looked carefully for a long time. The assistant said this came from the West. Because the color was rare, even one of this size had to sell for two hundred taels.

After going out, they walked into a nearby alley where there were fewer people. Yan Maoda said: "We can make a fortune just by selling those one hundred kilograms of freshwater pearls."

"They don't seem as good-looking as that one," Lu Rong said.

Yan Maoda said, "The pearl color is indeed not as good. But that's no big deal. The problem is that tray of purple pearls. That stuff is seawater pearls from Australia. I really didn't expect Guangzhou to have them."

"Probably collected from over there? Going from Southeast Asia to Australia is not too difficult."

"Probably. This shows someone has been to Australia, at least to its offshore islands."

"Developing Australia is actually not bad..."

Talking and laughing all the way, looking at the scenery. Lu Rong was very interested in the snacks on the street, but afraid of problems after eating, he had to endure his drooling all the way. The street scenery ahead gradually became desolate, and wasteland appeared occasionally by the roadside, but there were still human voices. Liu Gang stopped and said: "Ahead is a human market. Nothing good to see, all scenes of separation of flesh and blood, very miserable. Gentlemen, let's walk somewhere else."

Xiao Zishan hesitated. Before coming to Guangzhou, the Executive Committee had privately discussed buying people. The local labor force in Lingao was limited, and originally, some immigrants needed to be supplemented from outside. But the current problem was not this, but the "physiological needs" gradually exposed by many transmigrators.

This problem of physiological needs was originally human nature, food and sex. For a long time after D-Day, everyone had a heavy workload every day and was also guarding against possible attacks with fear, physically and mentally exhausted, so naturally, no one caused trouble. These days, the situation gradually stabilized, and there was more leisure time, but a lack of entertainment activities. More than five hundred people were mostly young men in their prime, inevitably thinking about food and sex. The problem was that only a dozen people had wives and girlfriends. Most people relied on watching AV to vent. AV stuff was more like adding fuel to the fire than venting. So under the excellent social situation, some discordant things inevitably occurred: such as peeping at girls bathing, secretly taking candid photos, etc., happened repeatedly. The most serious was an incident where someone attempted to rape Salina at night—of course, they seriously underestimated the strength of this ATF big horse (foreign woman) agent. Salina was not hurt except for a little fright, but one of the three people who attempted the attack entered the hospital.

Ran Yao quickly found the culprits. Out of consideration for maintaining stability, this matter was covered up. The three offenders were sent far away to work at the Bopu camp to avoid conflict if seen by Salina.

The matter was considered resolved, but the Executive Committee also saw signs of danger from this incident. There was more than one woman in the camp besides Salina, but single women were few and far between. In other words, the transmigration group itself could not solve the needs of male-female interaction internally. If this continued, once a rape incident occurred again, or there was an adultery problem, the Executive Committee would not only face a crying woman but also a furious cuckolded husband. How to handle it? What would be the result after handling? These were things they dared not imagine.

If someone had a little awareness—like the three in the Salina incident, finally knowing that a comrade's wife couldn't be touched, and changed to raping women in surrounding villages? Rape is the thing common people hate most. To win people's hearts back then, from the Red Army to the PLA era, raping women was punishable by shooting. Would they have to shoot the rapists too? It seemed to violate the Executive Committee's tenet of "everyone is equal, some are more equal than others."

Even if not raping, going whoring—not to mention whether there were brothels in Lingao County Town, getting infected with venereal diseases in brothels would be another trouble—the 17th-18th century was exactly the era when syphilis was introduced to China's coastal areas on a large scale. If unfortunately "hit by a dart," the health group would have to waste the already limited penicillin for treatment.

In short, not solving physiological problems posed a great hidden danger!

Of course, some people also proposed solutions. For example, Xiao Zishan proposed prioritizing the construction of cultural and sports facilities, showing movies every night, organizing sports competitions, etc. But these were measures like boiling soup to stop boiling (ineffective measures), with limited effect. So someone proposed a bolder idea: set up a brothel, strictly enforce hygiene measures, and prevent the transmission of venereal diseases. The Executive Committee would issue a "Happy Coupon" every month, and expenses beyond that would be self-paid.

This proposal was obviously the most efficient in solving the problem, but most people in the Executive Committee still couldn't shed their face—how could civilized people of the 21st century open such ignorant, backward, and cruel things as brothels! As for measures like issuing whoring coupons, they felt even more intolerable. (Note: It seems many cities in Germany have issued free whoring coupons in recent years. Very awkward, German people are happy enough.)

After secret consultations and soliciting some opinions, the Executive Committee decided that delay leads to trouble. Buy some women from the mainland as soon as possible and distribute them to single young men in the name of "maids." Of course, in name, they only handle housework, but in reality, they can do whatever they want.

However, this decision was opposed by some people, and Xiao Zishan also opposed it. The reason was simple: he was in charge of internal affairs. If this measure of disguised wife distribution was adopted, the result would be the collapse of the current collective dormitory system—young men with such "maids" would definitely not be willing to share a room with others anymore. This meant he had to expand housing.

After several nights of discussion, debate, and hearings, the "maid" plan was finally passed. Thus, Xiao Zishan's trip to Guangzhou had an additional task: buying women.

A task that sounded very romantic was actually not easy to handle. Buying and selling people usually required finding specialized human traffickers (renya), but the goods in their hands were expensive. He asked Gao Ju: an average-looking twelve or thirteen-year-old girl would cost seven or eight taels. If she looked good and was smart and clever, it would be at least twenty taels. Of course, there were better ones: girls raised like "thin horses" in Yangzhou, the price had no bottom, ranging from seventy or eighty taels to hundreds of taels.

Moreover, human traffickers often controlled the "source of goods." Girls fleeing famine from other places or selling themselves due to poverty and helplessness would fall into the hands of these traffickers nine out of ten. It was difficult for outsiders to intervene unless there was a large-scale famine and a large influx of refugees, making it possible to buy directly.

Now hearing Liu Gang say there was a human market ahead, he thought it would be good to take a look. Even if he couldn't buy suitable women, buying some children would be good. Wu Nanhai specifically mentioned that cultivating the transmigrators' own talents should start with children. Only in this way could their worldview be thoroughly transformed, and brand new knowledge and concepts instilled.

"Let's go and see. I want to buy some family members for use." Xiao Zishan said and walked forward again.

Of course, this was not really a professional human market. It was actually just a large piece of wasteland where refugees fleeing famine from various places gathered. There was a collapsed small temple on the wasteland, and even a few desolate graves. Shacks were set up everywhere in disorder. Refugees fleeing from various places in Guangdong and Guangxi, and even Jiangxi and Fujian, looked like living ghosts, sitting or lying with dull faces. Some could still move slowly leaning on begging sticks, some were cooking leftover rice and vegetables begged from who knows where, emitting a sour smell of swill... The atmosphere was foul, emitting a strange smell that was neither moldy nor burnt. Against the collapsed temple wall lay a row of stiff corpses, all covered with rotten straw mats, with only pairs of withered and cracked feet exposed. Ashes of some paper money still remained... If it were three or four months ago, just this scene would have shocked them, but now they were accustomed to death being as common as daily meals in this time and space.

There were local militia suppressing the place, and a porridge shed, showing a little relief from the local government. However, there were also some well-dressed figures coming in and out—all here to buy people.
