Chapter 36 Response

The cooperation with Qiwei Escort Agency allowed the Transmigrators to gain a firm foothold in Guangzhou. However, the crisis was not completely resolved.

The Zheng family was still staring covetously, and the spies of the Oriole Society were still active. The court's attention to them was also increasing.

"We must keep a low profile." Wen Desi emphasized at a meeting, "We can't let people think we are a threat."

So, the Transmigrators began to adjust their strategies.

They reduced the scale of selling "strange goods" such as glass and mirrors to avoid impacting the local market excessively.
They began to purchase large quantities of local specialties of the Ming Dynasty, such as raw silk, tea, porcelain, etc., to export to modern times or Southeast Asia. This model of "buy more and sell less" was welcomed by the local government and merchants.
They also actively participated in public welfare undertakings, building bridges and paving roads, providing porridge and medicine, establishing a good image of "benevolent merchants".

Xiao Zishan also specially visited some local gentry and literati, presented them with "Australian specialties" (books, stationery, etc.), and discussed poetry and literature with them.

"Australians are also people of culture!" The literati praised one after another.

Through these measures, the Transmigrators successfully dispelled the hostility of many people and integrated into the local society.

However, keeping a low profile did not mean being weak.

Secretly, the military expansion of the Transmigrators never stopped.

The PLA in Lingao had expanded to a scale of one regiment. They were equipped with SKS rifles and Napoleon cannons, undergoing rigorous training day and night.

The shipyard in Bopu Harbor was also built. The first batch of armed fishing boats were launched for sea trials.

The Intelligence Bureau's network covered the entire Guangdong and Fujian provinces. Any movement could not escape their eyes.

"We are accumulating strength." Wen Desi looked at the busy construction site and said, "Once the time is ripe, we will soar into the sky!"

And this time was not far away.

Because history was rolling forward according to its trajectory.

In the north, the iron cavalry of the Later Jin was eyeing covetously.
In the northwest, the uprising of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong was surging.
Inside the court, the struggle between the Eunuch Party and the Donglin Party was in full swing.

The doomsday of the Great Ming Dynasty was approaching. And the dawn of the new world was rising in the hands of the Transmigrators.
