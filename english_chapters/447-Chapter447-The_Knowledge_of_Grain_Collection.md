# Chapter 447 The Knowledge of Grain Collection

In the following few minutes, he slandered Chen Minggang continuously—strictly speaking, it wasn't slander, just telling the truth. It could be seen that this Revenue Section clerk had not been getting along well with Private Secretary Wang in recent years.

Wang Zhaomin didn't know his words were being recorded—of course, he didn't have this awareness—the Political Security Bureau was extremely interested in such materials where natives exposed each other. Sometimes a few words or a sentence could bring out a lot of useful information.

After listening seriously for a good while, Wu De spoke in a very difficult tone: "What Private Secretary Wang says might be true, but we are unfamiliar with the lay of the land in Lingao. Without relying on such people, I'm afraid we can't stay on..."

Wang Zhaomin thought, *If not for so many "traitors" helping you work and fight, you definitely couldn't stay.* But these words could only be said in his belly. *However, these Hair Bandits are truly cunning; the meaning of these words is obviously wanting me to state terms first.*

Wang Zhaomin proposed the terms discussed with Wu Mingjin: When starting the autumn grain collection, the Transmigrators would proactively pay grain and tax to the county yamen in the name of Bairen Village. The taxpaying area would be five hundred *mu* of paddy fields. Regardless of fertile or lean fields, the flat rate would be three *dou* five *sheng* of brown rice, plus nine *li* of Liao Supplies. Poll money would be three hundred *wen* per person, collected based on the approximately fifty people registered in Bairen Village's household registration.

In return, Wang Zhaomin promised that for every *shi* of the quota autumn grain, an additional one *dou* two *sheng* five *he* of "wastage rice" would be levied. This income would be entirely handed over to the Crossing Group. It would amount to about one thousand *shi* of grain. As for the "Reasonable Burden" collected by the Crossing Group themselves, the county yamen would not interfere; they could collect however they wished—actually, even if they wanted to interfere, they couldn't.

Wu De calculated. According to these conditions, deducting the taxes paid, their actual income would be around seven or eight hundred *shi* of rice. It belonged to net income obtained without spending any thought basically.

However, this differed from their goal: The Crossing Group didn't value this bit of rice now—not counting Lingao's warehouses, just in the granaries in Vietnam, they still had seven or eight thousand *shi* of brown rice not yet shipped. Purchasing another few thousand *shi* was a trivial matter.

The Crossing Group intended to use this as an opportunity to break the Ming dynasty's taxation system, which had been chaotic and riddled with abuses for hundreds of years, and establish an efficient and orderly tax collection system, thereby infiltrating and controlling Lingao's county administration. In other words, they prepared to use Lingao as a test field under the new administrative management system. For this goal, the Crossing Group was prepared to pay a huge price. How could they be dismissed by a mere one thousand *shi* of rice?

Wu De didn't answer but asked: "Private Secretary Wang, we really know nothing about the tricks of this autumn grain collection. Can you explain them to us?"

Wang Zhaomin said: "What's hard about this? Only, speaking of the tricks and abuses within, three days and three nights wouldn't be enough to finish."

"Please enlighten us!"

Anyway, being idle, and seeing this Chief Wu's meaning, there wasn't a feeling of rejecting people a thousand miles away. There was probably still room to talk. To win the trust of the Australians, Wang Zhaomin picked some of the various abuses and tricks in grain collection to tell Wu De.

"Actually, I am originally from a legal background," Wang Zhaomin said. "However, I also learned money and grain management. I can handle the money and grain affairs of an average small county."

Generally, when a magistrate took office, the Legal Secretary and the Money and Grain Secretary were the most important. The former assisted the magistrate in trying criminal cases. The latter specifically assisted the employer in handling money and grain reporting, land and poll tax, doorplate registers, land measurement, opening granaries for relief, and miscellaneous tax collection. Their specialty was not only being well-versed in the various tricks of this field but also being skilled in accounting.

Wang Zhaomin's profession was legal affairs, but his skills weren't refined, so he never found good employers—mostly *juren* lords or "associate *jinshi*" circling in remote small counties. Small counties had small populations and naturally fewer lawsuits. Hiring two private secretaries was a bit wasteful, so he also learned money and grain management. Although not extremely proficient, one person holding two posts not only gave him an extra income but also saved the employer one person's expense, making everyone happy.

The skill of a Money and Grain Secretary, besides the abacus, lay in understanding the situation and being good at dealing with clerks. This was because for the quota money and grain and land-poll tax, the Board of Revenue only asked for the total number, not the details. Who locally had how much land, located where, and how much tax was levied? Only the Revenue Section clerk in the county yamen knew clearly. What they relied on was a secret book passed down from generation to generation called the "Fish Scale Register." Without this book, even with sky-high abilities, one couldn't collect money and grain.

The Fish Scale Register was originally public property, drawn and revised under government auspices. But over a long time, the county archives were either destroyed or lost, their whereabouts long unknown. The "public registers" revised by the government instead became the private property of the clerks. Whether it was the Magistrate or the Money and Grain Secretary, to smoothly handle the official business of the two annual summer and autumn taxes, they were often held hostage by the clerks.

Generally speaking, after a magistrate took office, the Money and Grain Secretary had to negotiate terms and haggle with the Revenue Section clerk to form a tacit understanding, colluding to take what each needed. However, between Wang Zhaomin and Chen Minggang, there had always been some friction. The reason was that Lingao was very remote, far from the emperor, so the clerk's fear of officials was much less.

Because the "Revenue Clerk" had the Fish Scale Register, not only could official business go smoothly, but he himself could also make a fortune from it. For many years, the collection of money, grain, and land-poll tax had been a muddled account. Those who paid money and grain might not receive the "grain receipt" from the government, while those who didn't pay held improper receipts. Some had no standing room but had to pay grain tax; some possessed a thousand *qing* of fertile fields but didn't need to pay a single grain of rice. Anyway, as long as the "superiors" got the full quota amount, they simply didn't care about the mismatching names.

As for the tricks involved, there were many names. Wang Zhaomin mentioned "proxy registration" and "property gone, tax remains." Wu De already knew the latter from Zhang Xingjiao's case, and he also knew a bit about "proxy registration."

"Speaking of court exemptions, haven't there always been fixed quotas?" Wu De "sold" a bit of the knowledge he had heard, lest Wang Zhaomin really think they knew nothing and talk nonsense.

Wang Zhaomin was indeed startled, thinking Chen Minggang probably said this, and explained: "The court's exemptions originally had fixed quotas." This quota was set during the Hongwu reign. Roughly, a first-rank capital official could exempt 30 *shi*, second-rank 24 *shi*, and so on. Exemptions for external officials were half that of capital officials. As for Students of the Imperial College, *juren*, and *xiucai*, customarily they could exempt 2 *shi*. Aside from the tax-exempt share, all other self-purchased land had to be reported for tax payment.

"In reality? Those who can exempt two *shi* exempt dozens. When Grand Secretary Zhang measured the land during his administration, he first checked his own family's land. The quota exemption was over eighty *shi*, but the actual exemption was nearly nine hundred *shi*."

Wu De listened very carefully. He guessed "Grand Secretary Zhang" referred to Zhang Juzheng. Yu Eshu had specifically mentioned in his lecture on Ming dynasty land tax systems that Zhang Juzheng conducted land measurements during his tenure—it wasn't too distant from the present.

"Besides the court's exemptions," Wang Zhaomin smiled bitterly, "there is another class of people who also have so-called 'proxy registration'." Every county had a group of tricky, domineering, and hard-to-deal-with "special characters," either powerful landlords/gentry or rural rascals. They had to be appeased. Even if the weight was insufficient or the rice quality poor, it had to be accepted without fail. Sometimes they were even given "grain receipts"—proof of tax payment—falsely, to buy peace in the area. Many commoners and small households would "cast their land" under them to pay less tax. This was one aspect.

The second was that some people would ask them to "contract payment." Over time, so-called "Tax Farming Households" (*Baohu*) formed. These Tax Farmers were either "grain runners" in collusion with officials or local powerful figures who could coerce officials. If small households entrusted them to "contract payment," although the "floating collection" part was unavoidable, it was much cheaper than paying by themselves.

"The two Gou brothers you eliminated were originally the two biggest Tax Farmers in the county." Wang Zhaomin said. "However, if they didn't collude with Chen Minggang and serve as 'grain runners,' they couldn't have become Tax Farmers."

Wu De nodded. This "Tax Farmer" did have the meaning of a "tax contract" person.

"Tax Farmers" naturally didn't work for free. Customarily they fleeced from the middle. The audacious ones among "Tax Farmers" simply collected grain but didn't pay it, delaying endlessly, just waiting for the court to finally "pardon" the arrears. This situation was rampant in the Jiangnan region during the late Ming and early Qing.

If someone paid less, someone else had to pay more. The county's taxes still had to come from the county people. Plus various exploitation costs and the benefits for county officials, all fell on the heads of the small people. This was called "Wastage and Heaping," also known as "Floating Collection."

"Wastage and Heaping" wasn't "arbitrary charging"; it was stipulated clearly in the Great Ming tax system. In some places, the additional wastage rice and "heaped" rice per *shi* was as much as 7 *dou* 6 *sheng*, exceeding half the principal quota. This extra income was the largest and most reliable "gray income" for local officials. It was much safer than black money from perverting justice and the like.

"Wastage and Heaping" was nominally to pay for transport and loss of tax grain, but actually, there was no standard, with great arbitrariness. Wang Zhaomin daring to propose an additional levy of 1 *dou* 2 *sheng* for the Crossing Group was precisely exploiting this loophole.

Wang Zhaomin was vague about the "Floating Collection" part, only saying it was used to pay for transport and loss of tax grain. Of course, he didn't want the Australians to understand this income too clearly.

Wu De thought: *No wonder Luo Duo said back then that Lingao County's true tax burden was over 15,000 shi. Looking at it this way, it's completely possible.*

"What is the customary wastage rice per *shi* in this county?"

Wang Zhaomin was startled and hurriedly said: "This, the Noble Group only needs to pay the principal quota; floating collections are all exempted."

Wu De thought, *It doesn't matter if you don't say; we can find out ourselves.*

"The Liao Supplies surcharge must be very difficult for the county, right?" Wu De asked.

"Difficult." Wang Zhaomin was worrying about this matter and nodded involuntarily.

"Where does the difficulty lie?!" Wu De seized this question and wouldn't let go.

Wang Zhaomin hesitated and said: "Silver is expensive."
