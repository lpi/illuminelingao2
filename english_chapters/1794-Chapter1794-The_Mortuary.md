# Chapter 1794 - The Mortuary

Wu Xiang looked at the surrounding environment. someone had flipped over the wall from the adjacent Zhenbo Garden into the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall! He first climbed the big tree in Zhenbo Garden, then easily flipped over this courtyard wall which was more than *zhang* high. When coming down the wall, he used the protruding lintel of the small door as a step. That was why half a footprint was left.

Li Zhenguo said: "No wonder we turned South Scissors Alley upside down and didn't find the murderer! It turns out he escaped from here long ago!"

But Wu Xiang said: "This doesn't make sense. If you say he flipped over the wall from here into the guild hall and escaped, then who locked the back door lock? If you say there was another murderer locking the door outside, then why did someone have to escape and someone stay behind, and why kill Wang Xiuzhu? This doesn't make sense."

Old Qi said: "It doesn't matter, it's possible to lock the door from the inside too."

This was inconceivable to the three policemen. Wu Xiang had seen locks embedded in door panels by Australians which indeed could lock the door from both directions, but how could a padlock be locked from the outside while the person goes inside? Could it be flipping over the wall?

"You'll know when you get there." Old Qi said, "There is a door on the door."

Wu Xiang didn't care if there was a door on the door or no door, saying: "Open this door first."

Old Qi dared not disobey, used the key to open the door. Pushing the door open to look, inside was a not-so-large courtyard. Although the courtyard had not been repaired for many years, overgrown with weeds and with peeling paint, the elegance of the fine workmanship of the past could still be seen amidst the dilapidated and scattered appearance.

The courtyard was not big. Old Qi led them through a moon gate and entered the garden. The garden was so desolate it was out of shape, not only covered with wild grass and miscellaneous trees, but most of the buildings and rockeries in the garden had also collapsed. Only a small path was barely passable.

The sun was high in the sky. If on the street, one would probably still be sweating. As soon as entering this garden, although the wind was still and trees motionless, one felt a chill attacking, penetrating the skin and bones. Rotting leaves and grass on the ground were an inch deep. The trees in the garden were all old trees over fifty or sixty years old, their shade covering the sun like a canopy. The flower trees originally planted in vats had shattered the flower vats, covering the mossy green ground with strange black trunks blooming with gorgeous flowers, indescribably eerie.

Old Qi dared not look around, only leading the way in front—he said he hadn't come over from the guild hall side for several months.

"This place, as soon as it gets dark, even robbers dare not cross—it's unclean."

Wu Xiang was in no mood to listen to his chatter. He had already seen many traces of human disturbance on the small path: trampled wild grass, fallen branches... Obviously, someone had passed through here recently.

Crossing the desolate garden and arriving beside a courtyard wall, Old Qi said: "This is it."

The courtyard gate had long rotted and fallen off. Passing through, they saw the courtyard covered in dead leaves. The mortuary seemed to be converted from the original flower hall. The roofs of the wing rooms on both sides had half collapsed, the roof tiles covered with wild grass. Under the slanting setting sun, groups of bats flew around in midair. The peeling broken wooden lattice doors were half covered and half closed, creaking when blown by the wind.

Although everyone was bold, seeing such a scene, their hearts inevitably beat like drums, forcing themselves to push the door and enter.

Stepping into the main hall, they saw seven or eight black lacquered coffins parked inside, resting on long benches, covered in spider webs and dust. In front of the coffins were wooden spirit tablets, each written with the name of the deceased. Some were old, the writing already blurred. A strange smell assaulted the nose in the room, gloomy and deposited, but there was no smell of rot: coffins were customarily packed with limestone paper packets, fastidious families also used fragrant wood ashes and fine scraps, and the outside was coated with layer after layer of lacquer seven or eight times over linen cloth, airtight.

"The door in the back wall is behind this courtyard." Old Qi didn't want to stay here long, so he wanted to lead them to the back.

However, Li Zhenguo stopped him: "Don't go. Something's wrong." As he spoke, he pointed to the ground.

On the dusty ground, chaotic footprints were clearly left, leading all the way to the side of a coffin.

Old Qi screamed and instantly fainted. This startled the police. Li Ziyu hurriedly helped him up and pinched his philtrum, finally waking him up with great difficulty. Li Zhenguo said: "Old Qi, what are you scared of? This clearly shows someone has been in here!"

Wu Xiang nodded and said: "Go take a look."

They carefully avoided the footprint traces on the ground and came to the side of the coffin. Wu Xiang circled the coffin a few times and immediately discovered cracks between the coffin lid and the coffin body. There were obvious wear marks on the lacquer surface in several places—someone had opened the coffin!

Calling Old Qi over to look, Old Qi turned pale with fright at a glance. The wooden nails on the coffin lid were broken, obviously having been pried open.

This was a terribly big matter. Although the coffin had not been buried yet, privately opening a coffin was equivalent to robbing a grave. In the past, that was a felony. If the bereaved family had some influence, they would definitely not let it go.

If a fuss was made, he, the miscellaneous worker managing the mortuary, was afraid he would lose this job! He was so anxious he almost cried. Anxiously said: "This, how can this be! This key has never left my person for a moment!"

Wu Xiang comforted him: "Old Qi, don't worry. The plan for now is only to open this coffin and take a look, then decide—rest assured: as long as you cooperate with our work, the police will definitely prove your innocence!"

Old Qi had already lost his wits, now hurriedly said: "Whatever the officers decide."

"Old Li, Little Li, lend a hand together, let's open the coffin." Wu Xiang said, "Old Qi, you come help too."

Although Old Qi was unwilling in his heart, seeing as things had come to this, he could only listen to the police.

Four people exerted force together, only hearing a few "creak creak" sounds, the coffin lid had been lifted. Several people looked inside intently, Old Qi screamed "Mother!" again and rolled his eyes back.

This time the three policemen couldn't care about him. Inside the coffin was actually an object wrapped in oilcloth—resembling a human shape. It was spotted with bloodstains. Li Ziyu couldn't help shouting: "It's this!"

That's right, inside the coffin was exactly that headless corpse he and Zhao Gui found during the rainy night patrol last night, which later disappeared!

Now the truth was revealed. That headless corpse that flew away without wings was moved into the mortuary by the murderer while they went back to find people, and hidden in the coffin.

The coffins in the mortuary were all used by relatively wealthy people, large in size, putting in two corpses was no problem at all. Unless the coffins in the mortuary were to be transported or buried, no one would ask about them for years. Even if exposed one day, with the passage of time, it would truly become a cold case.

Although opening a coffin to hide a corpse made quite some noise, Zhenbo Garden had always been known as a "haunted house". Even if there were noises or anomalies late at night, ordinary people wouldn't dare come over to investigate what happened.

Li Zhenguo was secretly surprised in his heart. This murderer was really not simple! This person could move a headless corpse in the pitch-black rainy night, quietly enter the "haunted house" deserted for a long time, calmly open the coffin to hide the corpse, then quietly leave to hide in Widow Wang's home. In the morning finding the police patrol net searching, then without hesitation kill Widow Wang who might be his accomplice, calmly arrange a suicide scene, then use the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall as a passage to quietly escape from the dragnet set by the police. Can be called bold and knowledgeable.

Since the corpse had been found, Wu Xiang immediately sent Li Ziyu to the Municipal Bureau to notify, at the same time asking the Municipal Bureau to send police and coroners over. To conduct a comprehensive on-site investigation of Zhenbo Garden and Wang Xiuzhu's home.

As for how the murderer locked the back door and entered Zhenbo Garden, it was not difficult at all. It turned out that on one door leaf of the back door of Zhenbo Garden, a small door was cut, with another small door bolt on it. A person could bow their head and enter. As long as the small door was opened in advance, one could return to the garden after locking the door from the outside, then bolt the small door. It didn't affect opening the lock from the outside.

Investigators not only found the headless corpse in the coffin, but also found the discarded knife—a butcher knife used for cutting pork. There was a shop mark on the knife handle, exactly the "Fuchangyu" Pig Hong in Scissors Alley. After the forensic personnel compared the traces on the corpse's wounds, they believed this was the knife used to chop off the head.

Although the local police station didn't receive a report, a pig hong losing a knife wasn't a big matter, so it was normal not to report it. To be safe, Li Zhenguo still sent Zhao Gui to inquire if a butcher knife had been lost.

Zhao Gui came back very quickly, saying the hong did lose a butcher knife a few days ago. Because the value wasn't great, they didn't make a noise about it.

A total of two sets of footprints were extracted from the ground of the mortuary. One set belonged to the same person as the footprint found on the small door of the rear sandwich wall. The other set, judging from the size, should be a woman's footprints. After comparison, they belonged to Wang Xiuzhu's footprints—visible that Wang Xiuzhu was also one of the participants in the murder case.

Investigators discovered fresh bloodstains covered by mud in the wing room of Wang Xiuzhu's home, and found tiny blood spots splattered on the wall and wooden door, confirming this was the scene of the crime and beheading. They also dug out unburnt fragments of silk fabric from the stove hearth. Two unburnt shoe soles were also found.

It was already the early morning of the second day after the crime when the on-site investigation ended. Wu Xiang led Li Zhenguo and others back to the Municipal Bureau and immediately held a case analysis meeting.

Based on further on-site investigation, they preliminarily deduced the crime process: The murderer and Wang Xiuzhu conspired to kill the victim at Wang Xiuzhu's home and chopped off the victim's head. They stripped off the victim's clothes and stuffed them into the stove hearth to burn. Then they used knockout incense to stun Old Qi, stole the carrying pole and oilcloth, wrapped the corpse with oilcloth and carried it to the back door of Zhenbo Garden which the murderer had scouted beforehand.

Unfortunately, during transport, they saw the patrol police carrying lanterns on patrol, panic-stricken they dropped the corpse and fled. However, the police left after finding the corpse, giving them an opportunity. The murderer returned according to the original plan, used the key left by Wang Xiuzhu's late husband to open the back door, and transported the corpse into the mortuary to hide according to the original plan.

Then they returned to the Wang house. The next morning finding the street blocked and police fully investigating, the murderer believed time was of the essence and must flee as soon as possible. Before fleeing, to silence her, he killed Wang Xiuzhu and arranged it as "suicide". Then found the key, passed through the back door of Zhenbo Garden, and quietly escaped via the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall.
