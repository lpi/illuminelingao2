Chapter 21 Meeting - Women's Detachment

"The topic is about textiles," Xiao Zishan said, "The next speaker is from the General Affairs Group."

A girl in her early twenties stood up. She looked a bit shy and her voice was not loud.

"My name is Du Wen. I'm a fashion design major... I was dragged here by my boyfriend..."

There was a burst of friendly laughter from below.

"About textiles, I think we should focus on cotton spinning," Du Wen said, "Cotton cloth is the most basic clothing material and also a strategic material. In the Ming Dynasty, cotton planting was already very common, but the spinning technology was relatively backward. We can introduce modern textile machinery to improve efficiency and quality."

"What kind of machinery?"

"For example, the Jenny spinning jenny, the flying shuttle loom... These are classic equipment from the early days of the Industrial Revolution. They have simple structures and are easy to manufacture and maintain. Moreover, they are powered by manpower or hydraulic power and do not rely on electricity."

"What about chemical fibers?" Someone asked, "Nylon, polyester..."

"That requires the support of the chemical industry," Du Wen shook her head, "With our current conditions, it's difficult to achieve. However, we can try to make some artificial fibers, such as viscose fiber. The raw materials are wood pulp or cotton linters, and the process is relatively simple."

"Also," Du Wen added, "We should bring some sewing machines. Treadle sewing machines. They are much faster than hand sewing."

"Agreed!" The crowd nodded. Sewing machines were indeed good things.

"Besides clothing, there are also shoes and hats, bedding..." Du Wen listed a long list of daily necessities.

The list from the General Affairs Group was the longest and most miscellaneous. From toilet paper to sanitary napkins, from soap to toothpaste, from pots and pans to needles and threads... almost covering every aspect of life.

"These things seem trivial, but they are related to everyone's quality of life," Xiao Zishan concluded, "We are going to live, not to survive. We can't treat ourselves badly."

"Especially for female comrades," he emphasized, "We must ensure the supply of their special supplies. This is related to the stability and harmony of the team."

"Long live the leader!" The female comrades in the General Affairs Group cheered.

Next was the medical and health issue.

"I am Shi Yishi, a surgeon," A man wearing glasses stood up, "I represent the Medical Group."

"Our goal is to establish a modern medical system. This includes hospitals, pharmaceutical factories, health schools..."

"Wait, pharmaceutical factories?" Someone interrupted, "Can we make medicines?"

"Of course," Shi Yishi said confidently, "Many basic medicines, such as aspirin, sulfonamides, penicillin... their principles and processes are not complicated. As long as there are raw materials and equipment, we can produce them."

"Especially penicillin," he emphasized, "This is a life-saving drug. In that era without antibiotics, a small inflammation could kill people. With penicillin, we have a talisman."

"Also, vaccines. Smallpox, cholera, plague... these infectious diseases were rampant in ancient times. We must prepare vaccines in advance."

"What about traditional Chinese medicine?" Someone asked.

"Traditional Chinese medicine is also a treasure house," Shi Yishi said, "We can use local herbal resources to develop Chinese patent medicines. This can save costs and is also easy for the locals to accept."

"In short," Shi Yishi concluded, "We want to let everyone enjoy modern medical services in the Ming Dynasty. We want to increase the average life expectancy from 30 to 70!"

"Well said!" Applause broke out.

Finally, the topic of education.

"Education is the foundation of a century-long plan," A middle-aged man stood up. He was a middle school teacher named "Hu Qingbai", "We want to cultivate our own talents."

"We need to build schools, from primary school to university. We need to compile textbooks to spread modern scientific knowledge and values."

"We want to implement compulsory education so that every child can read books."

"We also need to run adult education classes to wipe out illiteracy and teach skills."

"This is a huge project," Hu Qingbai sighed, "But it is very meaningful. We are sowing the seeds of civilization."

The meeting lasted for a whole day. Every group put forward their own plans and needs.

Although there were disputes and ridicule, everyone's goal was the same: to build a new world in the Ming Dynasty.

As night fell, the meeting finally ended.

Xiao Zishan dragged his exhausted body back to the dormitory. He lay on the bed, his mind full of today's scenes.

He knew that this was just the beginning. The real challenge was yet to come.

But he was full of confidence. Because he saw a group of energetic, knowledgeable and dream-filled people.

With them, what miracles could not be created?
