# Chapter 112: Gou Family Manor (Part 2)

A guide was quickly found: a local peddler. Gou Manor wasn't Mordor—aside from the Gou family's demon-like households, most were ordinary people needing needles, thread, and sundries. Where there was demand, there was supply. Of course, trading in Gou Manor required courage—bad luck meant getting robbed by former professional criminals turned household guards, maybe even beaten. Lin Quan'an was among the rare peddlers willing to trade at Gou Manor. His willingness was simple: with almost no competitors, prices were higher and demand stronger. This showed Lin Quan'an was quite brave—he'd also been the first to sell at Bairren Fortress's free market.

Bairren Fortress's urban planning had long included a free-market plot, but no one had come to trade. Lin Quan'an, while peddling village-to-village, learned the short-haired pirates had announced: anyone wanting to trade or work at Bairren Rapids was welcome. This didn't have an immediate effect, but Lin Quan'an got ideas. He specifically sought out returned laborers, questioning them thoroughly about conditions there. Conclusion:

These short-hairs wouldn't leave anytime soon. Simple reason: they were frantically building houses—clearly planning to settle permanently.

Permanent settlement meant many needs—tremendous business opportunities.

Lin Quan'an decided to test the waters. Beforehand, he prepared carefully.

His goods: a load of vegetables. Being a vegetable peddler in Lingao was unpromising—beyond county-seat demand, every rural household grew their own. No one bought vegetables. But these short-hairs came by sea, and you couldn't grow vegetables on ships. People could skip meat but not vegetables—at minimum, they'd get constipated. Second, if they were unreasonable robbers, he'd only lose vegetables. As for forced labor—if they'd released so many prisoners, why would they grab him?

He carried his vegetables all the way to Bairren Free Market. The vast open space was empty except for him. While anxiously waiting, Wu Nanhai came out upon hearing the news—without a word, he bought the entire load to improve cafeteria fare. Lin Quan'an was overjoyed. These short-hairs not only needed vegetables but were generous—seemingly not treating copper coins as money. They casually tossed him 200 *wen*—didn't even count. Not worthless sand-cast coins that shattered when dropped—all bright Wanli-reign coins! Actually, even if Lin Quan'an had brought a load of dirt, they'd have bought it—this was about setting an example.

Gradually, Lin Quan'an became the transmigrators' exclusive vegetable supplier, recently also supplying live pigs, chickens, ducks, and eggs. Demand was staggeringly high—ancients consumed little animal protein. Livestock and poultry were rarely eaten. Unlike these 500 otaku who ate meat every meal, with daily egg allowances. Prices immediately soared. All nearby farmers planned to raise more chickens, ducks, and pigs next year.

Lin Quan'an had prospered. His carrying-pole became a pushcart; he was about to hire helpers and get a cart-and-horse when Lord Wu came seeking him—wanting him to guide them to Gou Manor.

With Lin Quan'an's intelligence, he knew short-hairs going to Gou Manor meant "weasel paying respects to chickens—no good intentions." Though he liked money, getting mixed up between two gangster groups wouldn't end well. He immediately declined. But Lord Wu hinted that cafeteria purchasing prices seemed a bit high. When Lin Quan'an tried to settle accounts and leave, he discovered many competitors hovering at the gate—the power of example was indeed limitless.

To protect his monopoly, Lin Quan'an had to take the risk. But before departure, he declared: he'd only guide, nothing else. Wu De readily agreed.

The team included the uninvited Wang Ruixiang. Reconnaissance had nothing to do with his specialty—his self-proclaimed title was "Wang Weapons Design Bureau" Chief Designer, actually just an errand boy in the Machinery Group. His insistence on joining had two reasons: first, he'd lugged a large model airplane and a remote-control helicopter across—still unused; second, as a deeply hidden nationalist, he distrusted this "ABC" Xue, believing his loyalty was questionable—defection inevitable. He had to monitor this dangerous element—if any betrayal occurred, his climbing axe would settle things.

Xue Ziliang didn't realize such malicious intentions. Though using model aircraft for reconnaissance against opponents of Landlord Gou's level seemed like overkill, trying wouldn't hurt. He agreed to let this axe-wielder join.

This reconnaissance was undercover. Everyone changed into local cloth clothing, wearing head-kerchiefs. To hide their unusual haircuts, they wore conical hats. Carrying baskets with weapons and equipment plus Lin Quan'an's trade goods—needles, thread, sundries.

Before departure, everyone rubbed dirt on their faces—looking less clean and pale. The travelers differed notably from locals in their generally paler skin.

Five or six people, disguised as common peddlers, slowly headed toward Gaoshan Ridge.

Bypassing the county seat, after barely ten *li*, they reached Dongchun Village at Piye Mountain's foot. This thousand-year-old village had been settled since the Han Dynasty. A few dozen households remained—unsafe times meant even this small village had built a man-high earth wall. A roadside tea stall sold rough tea and dry provisions. Hearing from the guide that over ten *li* of mountain road lay ahead, Xue Ziliang decided to rest briefly—everyone would gather strength before continuing.

Fearing infectious diseases, transmigrators never consumed locally prepared food. The Medical Group had repeatedly warned: typhoid was extremely prevalent here. Everyone drank from their own bamboo canteens. Lin Quan'an, having no such concerns, was used to these short-hairs' obsessive cleanliness—not surprised. While resting, he quietly explained upcoming details.

From here into the mountains, another ten-plus *li* to Gou Manor. This road led directly there—few travelers besides residents and peddlers like himself. Gou family militia patrolled constantly, questioning strangers—partly guarding against enemies, partly because they'd monopolized all mountain products. Woodcutters, hunters, timber merchants—all had to pay them. No unauthorized harvesting or hunting.

He warned the scouts: if the baskets contained anything unusual, they'd better hide it now. If guards found anything during searches and took them to the manor for questioning—that wouldn't end well.

Xue Ziliang conferred with teammates. They reorganized into single-file: Ye Mengyan as point man, Xue Ziliang second for cover, others following sequentially. Lin Quan'an was kept third by the menacing Wang Ruixiang. Seeing these short-hairs suddenly turn murderous, Lin Quan'an was terrified.

"Don't worry—just keep guiding!" Xue Ziliang flashed his gleaming white teeth in a sinister smile. Beside him, Wang Ruixiang felt a start—realizing if he actually tried to chop this ABC, he probably wouldn't be a match.

"Listen up: our mission is reconnaissance of enemy defenses. If possible, capture a prisoner. No unnecessary conflicts—but if firefights occur, be clean and efficient!" He surveyed these young men. "Don't use guns casually—use your knives!"

Everyone felt a jolt. Killing—first time for this business. Somewhat unsettling. But training had drilled into them: war was life-or-death. No room for mercy.

In formation, they headed into the mountains. Piye Mountain was Lingao's famous peak—close to the county seat, a local scenic spot. "Piye" came from a Han Dynasty Brahmin monk's name. The mountain had six ridges; Gaoshan Ridge was the second-highest peak, with a temple to Gaoshan's Piye deity. The so-called Gaoshan Ridge derived from this temple. Before the temple lay serene "Mirror Lake"—clear water, calm as glass. Picturesque scenery. But this group had murder and plunder on their minds—no mood for sightseeing.

They encountered few passersby—just hurrying villagers. The legendary Gou family professional criminals didn't appear. Saved them the trouble of killing early. The recon team rounded a small mountain, walked seven or eight *li*. In the distance, below the main peak, they saw a small hill covered with dense buildings. Lin Quan'an said that was Gou Manor. The valley below contained fields.

Three or four *li* from the manor, Xue Ziliang led the team into a grove.

Through binoculars, he observed the terrain: the manor was built against the mountain, surrounded by tall, sturdy earthen walls. The wooden gate was flanked by watchtowers on each wall section. The road ended at the manor. No moat, but many barriers like chevaux-de-frise. Cold-weapon infantry assaulting walls would find it somewhat difficult.

After noting wall height, tower positions, and sentry locations on his map, Xue Ziliang decided to personally enter for a look. No matter how reconnaissance technology advanced, on-site reconnaissance remained the most reliable intelligence source.

He turned, ordering Lin Quan'an to take him inside. This command terrified the peddler. Guiding was one thing—taking this hulking short-hair killer into Gou Manor... if anything happened, both major Lingao gangster groups wouldn't spare him. He was about to kneel and beg when the axe-wielding Wang Ruixiang drew his hatchet—gleaming blade flashed before his face, asking if he preferred "plank-chopped noodles" or "wonton noodles." True pirate nature. He meekly stood up.

"Listen—I can speak Hokkien!" Xue Ziliang said. "Tell them I'm your fellow townsman, helping you out."
