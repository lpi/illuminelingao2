# Chapter 100 - Work in Li Area (3)

According to the plan prepared in advance, after entering the mountains, everyone changed their gun carrying posture to alert state, and sent scouts ahead to investigate. The mountain terrain was not precipitous. Along the way, small patches of land in the mountains could be seen, planted with rice about to be harvested. There were also traces of planting on relatively gentle slopes—the green forest was like a carpet losing hair, revealing patches of yellow from time to time—this was the slash-and-burn agriculture planted by Li people—a primitive agricultural method close to slash-and-burn. Scattered one or two village stockades could be seen on distant hillsides. Because time was ample, they were not in a hurry to travel, watching the mountain scenery while walking. Although it was autumn, Hainan was like summer in all four seasons, still with blooming mountain flowers and lush vegetation. The scenery was particularly beautiful. Compared with the desolate scene of smoke and wild grass outside the mountains, it had a different flavor. Walking up a mountain top, everyone stood and looked around. Wen Desi couldn't help praising:

"Really a good place."

"The scenery is much better than both banks of the Wenlan River." Everyone said so, wiping sweat and pointing at the surrounding scenery.

"What is this?" On a small hillside not far away, there was a patch of extremely tall and straight trees. Among these lush trees, they were very conspicuously leafless.

"This is Kapok." Wen Desi said. As a person living in Guangzhou, it was impossible not to know the plant that is the city flower of Guangzhou.

"Kapok, I know! The flowers are very beautiful. I saw many when I went to Panzhihua." Mu Min said.

"Hehe, correct. The place Panzhihua is named after Kapok (Panzhihua is another name for Kapok)."

"Why do these trees all lose leaves? Trees in the south generally don't shed leaves, right."

"It is originally a deciduous tree," Fa Shilu explained, "Because its place of origin basically has dry and wet seasons. Before entering the dry season, it will shed all leaves to save water." Although he was an agronomist, he also worked on plant protection. He knew this aspect relatively well.

"This tree is very useful," Fa Shilu continued, "It is a very good fiber raw material."

"Good is good, but can't spin cloth."

The fiber of Kapok is much shorter than that of cotton, not very suitable as textile raw material. However, it grows fast, the material is light and soft, the fiber is short and fine and soft, without twist, with a hollowness of up to 86% or more, not easily soaked by water, strong pressure resistance, strong warmth retention, naturally antibacterial, not moth-eaten or moldy, can fill pillows and life jackets.

Transmigrators had found quite a few Kapok trees scattered along the Wenlan River, but this was the first time seeing such a forest. If developed, it should have great potential.

"President Wen, I want to collect some samples." Fa Shilu asked for instructions.

"Engineer Fa, talk to Captain Lu about this—" Wen Desi said, "I am just a team member, with no command power."

"Okay, okay, I forgot again." The agronomist smiled embarrassedly. The title of Chairman on Wen Desi's head always made him forget this.

"Old Fa, you said this Kapok can't spin yarn, why did I hear that Li people's cotton spinning technology was always leading in ancient times? Even Huang Daopo learned spinning from Li people in Hainan." Accompanying him to collect samples was Cui Yunhong, carrying many equipment on his back: laptop, transient electromagnetic instrument, bolt detector, ultrasonic detector... even a small hand-cranked generator of African poverty alleviation version—no way, who told these things all need electricity. Taking advantage of collecting samples, he also did some geological exploration work by the way.

"Not all Kapok cannot be spun." Fa Shilu carefully avoided the thorns on the tree trunk, pulling a tape measure, "Some Kapok varieties are possible, but the quality cannot compare with herbaceous cotton. Also, some so-called Kapok is actually Sea Island cotton."

"Sea Island cotton?"

"This is a kind of long-staple cotton with very high quality. Originating from Central and South America. Because it was once widely distributed along the southeast coast of the United States and nearby islands, it is called Sea Island cotton." Fa Shilu explained, "There is a similar long-staple cotton on Hainan Island, very close to this American Sea Island cotton."

"I've seen cotton, very short and small like grass, planted once a year. How can it be like Kapok?"

"Hehe, because cotton can be annual or perennial." Fa Shilu knew that most people in the original space-time couldn't distinguish the five grains, and many mistook wheat seedlings for chives. Having seen cotton was already not bad, "Cotton can grow into perennial woody plants in natural environment. Maybe because like Kapok, the seed coat has cotton wool, so it was mistakenly called Kapok. The raw material for Li people on Hainan Island to spin cloth should be this kind of perennial woody cotton." He continued, "I have seen some scattered cotton trees like this. Quite common on the island. Our department is considering how to deal with the cotton problem."

"Is this Kapok?"

"It's ordinary Kapok." Fa Shilu was a bit regretful. If it were a forest of Sea Island cotton, they would be rich: this kind of long-staple cotton can not only be used as worsted raw material to spin worsted high-count cotton cloth with texture and feel comparable to silk, but also indispensable raw material for tire cord in the future tire industry.

"Can be used to make guncotton." Zhang Berlin, who was guarding them aside, interrupted, "Making guncotton just needs fiber."

"Can't say that—" Fa Shilu was just speaking, suddenly saw two or three people coming from a distance. Their dress and attire showed they were not Han people at a glance. Knowing they were Li people, he hurriedly packed up things and retreated to the main team.

Two local soldiers came over and asked loudly from a distance. They both wore cloth shirts, but the lower body was wrapped with cloth strips like briefs, a bit like Japanese loincloths (this was a kind of clothing often worn by Li men in the past). A hook knife hung at the waist—this was carried by every Li man in the past, serving as both a production tool and a weapon—carrying crossbows and arrows on the back. Lu Rong spoke with them in Qiongzhou dialect for a while, knowing that this was already within the boundary of a Dong, and the Dong Lord lived in the place named Nanancun (that South Village) ahead (this village is purely fictional).

While talking here, the captives behind became agitated. Ignoring the heavy salt bags on their bodies, they all rushed over. The two sides met, excitedly hugging and crying—it turned out that these two local soldiers were from their village. Early this morning, a hunter reported that a team with strange appearance came. Their number was small, not official troops. Nor were they single or small groups of Han merchants. The Dong Lord was also the Tusi (native official) manager appointed by the Ming government, with the obligation to maintain local security, so he sent people over to investigate.

From the conversation, it was known that five of the thirty Li soldiers sent by this Dong escaped back. Now the Li area was saying that a powerful pirate team came from the sea with powerful firearms. Small merchants from the Han area added oil and vinegar to dramatize the Battle of Bairen Beach. Now almost everyone knows how terrifying the transmigrators are.

Knowing that the comers were the "pirates" with the power of ghosts and gods, the two local soldiers showed looks of fear. Lu Rong hurriedly explained that they were not pirates, but merchants. Fighting with the official army at Bairen Beach was also compelled. Coming to the Li area this time, first was to return these eight captives, second was to do business. Saying this, Lu Rong opened a salt bag—snow-white refined salt shone in the sunlight. The power of salt was indeed very huge. After licking a mouthful to confirm it was really salt, the two local soldiers ran away as if flying.

Lu Rong ordered everyone to wait in place. If the information obtained by the Public Security Group from the Li captives was accurate, the power of salt was enough. Although so, everyone was still a bit nervous, deeply afraid that the other party might come for revenge. With the firepower of more than twenty SKS rifles, even one or two hundred people would not be a problem, but once conflict started, it would be difficult to deal with the aftermath. If there were a few more casualties on their side, it would be an irreparable loss.

Not long after, more than ten local soldiers came again, clustering around a middle-aged man. He dressed much more exquisitely than the nearly half-naked local soldiers, looking like traditional Li brocade, with pheasant feather decoration on his head, seeming to be a headman or the like. According to captives, this was an "Ao Ya" (Note: Meaning "Old Man" in Li language. Before liberation, ordinary Li masses used this to address the upper-level headmen of Li ethnic group) in their Dong, a big figure second only to Master Tusi.

This "Ao Ya" could speak very good Qiongzhou dialect. He came over alone to the open space between the two sides, and first chopped the hook knife into the ground.

"What does this mean?" Lu Rong was a bit nervous.

"Seems to mean no hostility." Wen Desi remembered watching an Amazon rainforest adventure movie in the past. When the expedition team encountered natives in the forest, they also put the machete on the ground first to show friendship, "Just do the same." (Note: This is purely made up)

So Lu Rong also walked out and put the machete on the ground. Not only was he extremely nervous himself, everyone in the team was sweating for him—he was only more than fifty meters away from those local soldiers. If a crossbow arrow was fired, and unfortunately hit a place without stab-resistant clothing protection, the Upas tree poison on the crossbow arrow would seal the throat upon seeing blood (deadly poison).

The two sides stood there and talked for more than ten minutes. Then he came back, saying somewhat helplessly: "He refuses to let us go to the village. They are willing to buy the salt. He is willing to use things we want as ransom for the captives."

Wen Desi thought what's the use of going back just like this. But the captain was Lu Rong. Intervening in decision-making seemed to violate the command power policy formulated by the Executive Committee.

So he still asked tentatively: "Talk again? Giving some gifts is fine—"

"Gifts!" Lu Rong laughed, "Resigned for more than a year, forgot the content of the profession." So he went back again, and the two talked for a while. After a while, Lu Rong came back beaming with joy:

"Done. He promised to take us to outside the village, but we can't enter the village. Can only trade outside the village. But he promised to let us see the Dong Lord."

The price of this conversion was a small fruit knife. Although the fruit knife was not made of high-grade steel like tool steel, it was steel knife anyway, completely incomparable with the rough iron sheet hook knife in their hands.

It seems that commercial bribery works everywhere.
