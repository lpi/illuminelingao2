# Chapter 74 - Bairen City

In the following days, Fu Youdi rapidly completed the process of completely transforming from an honest farmer into a small bully. In his simple peasant consciousness, it was a matter of course to take a cut when handling things.

At first, it was just getting a bit more dry and meat for himself when distributing food. Then the task of leading the work and assigning jobs was also handed over to him. Wu De only told them how much work to do every day, and didn't ask how they did it. So he distributed all the work to the other four people, just putting on a show himself. At first, some people were unwilling and also slackened off. Fu Youdi didn't dare to control them yet, but when it came to mealtime, the power of food control was demonstrated—Fu Youdi would scoop only the soup on the surface for those who refused to work. Wang Tian, because he was a local native like him, and the two could talk relatively well, became an object of preferential treatment, working less and eating more. The other three became victims, working more and eating less, so a small conflict broke out during dinner one day. Lin Xing took the lead in resisting and beat Fu Youdi into a faceplant. Wu De did not interfere with the rights and wrongs in it, but whipped everyone involved in the fight with fifty rattan lashes. Lin Xing, who started it, got one hundred.

Undoubtedly, while the buttocks of these five captives were burning that day, the hatred between them was also burning. Fu Youdi completely tore his face; he began to dare to shout at Lin Xing, and deducting food became unscrupulous. The contradiction became deeper and deeper—according to Wu De's observation, the five people were divided into three factions: Fu Youdi reeled in Wang Tian, Lin Xing attempted to resist, and they both attempted to reel in the two people who were just passing by in the middle. Wu De sometimes deliberately created contradictions among them, sometimes saying work was ineffective, sometimes using the excuse that cleaning work was not done well to lower the food standard. When someone's mistake caused everyone to starve, mutual accusations deepened the contradiction between them.

The smarter and bolder Lin Xing plucked up the courage to complain directly to him about Fu Youdi's problems, although his Mandarin was stuttering and sometimes failed to convey the meaning. So Wu De took the opportunity to punish Fu Youdi, who was starting to gain weight—to let him know some limits; and intentionally or unintentionally showed a look of protecting Lin Xing. The captives who were miserably exploited by Fu Youdi were grateful for Wu De's sharp eyes, and also knew that it was because Lin Xing made a report that this happened, so even the laziest person began to actively learn Mandarin.

"Ah De, you are really something! Gave them all magic potions?" Xiong Buyou found that his students suddenly became diligent, not rushing to sleep after dinner at night, but coming to him for make-up lessons to learn to speak.

Wu De chuckled; this situation was not out of his expectation at all. In terms of human nature, there is no essential difference between the 17th century and the 21st century.

Wu De's new mission was just a small episode in daily work. Although this matter seemed significant in later generations, few people cared about it at that time. All attention revolved around the progress of the road construction project.

Except for a small amount of leveling and shaping using manpower, the entire line adopted mechanized construction. The Architecture Team was also becoming more and more familiar with how to organize construction. By D+6, which was the seventh day of the ninth lunar month in the first year of the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty, or October 3, 1628, in the Gregorian calendar, the 12-kilometer simple highway from Bopu to Bairen Beach was fully connected, one day later than the Executive Committee's requirement—although it was flat land from Bairen Beach to Bopu, there was actually a slight slope, and the highway was not a straight line, but slightly curved.

The defensive fortifications along the highway continued to be retained. In the future, they would be expanded and reinforced into small fortresses, serving as the cornerstones for road protection.

As for Bairen Beach itself, it will become the first city of the transmigrators in this space-time. The Executive Committee's [plans] for this base...

The Architecture Team had already given this new city a simple and apt name: "Bairen City".

"A bit of a Wuxia novel flavor." Mei Wan stood high-spirited on the cliff of Bairen Beach. This is the location of the rolling dam of the Bairen Beach Hydropower Station in the 21st century, with a drop of about 16 meters from the generator room. The Wenlan River takes a sharp turn here, and nine levels of rocks formed the slope waterfall of Bairen Beach. The water flow was turbulent, sounding like thunder; this is the so-called "Sound of Bairen Beach", which can be heard for more than twenty li around.

"City Lord of Bairen!" Yan Quezhi waved the measuring rod in his hand, striking a pose. Several people also gestured a few moves of fist and foot.

"Is the planning map out?"

"Out." Li Xiaolü pulled out a 1:1000 planning map. Regarding how to plan this so-called "base inheriting the seeds of 21st-century civilization", from the Architecture Team itself to various departments of the Executive Committee, all put forward their own views and suggestions. Li Xiaolü summarized them and decided to design according to the planning ideas of the socialist new countryside in the late 70s. At that time, there was a special planning design map specifically for villages and towns at the level of "commune resident", which considered administrative, educational, and small industrial enterprises, as well as agricultural production buildings. It is a new type of rural residential model combining urban and rural areas and taking into account industry, agriculture, and sidelines.

The plan for Bairen City is for the entire city to unfold along both banks of the Wenlan River, with the main urban area and the hydropower area set on the east bank of the Wenlan River, and the heavy industry area on the west bank.

The hydropower area will build a power station, a water treatment plant, and in the future will also set up a small inland river wharf and warehouse.

The main city is about 100 meters away from the hydropower area by the river bank. The groundwater level in this plot is lower, the soil bearing capacity is also very good, and the entire ground has a slope of about 4% from south to north, which can effectively drain rainwater by relying on the natural slope.

At the southernmost part of the main urban area is the water supply station. Because of the slope, tap water does not need pressurization, and water supply for the whole city can be achieved using a simple water tower.

The main urban area is planned into the following zones according to different uses:
Administrative Zone, in the middle section of the main urban area, arranging various government agencies in sequence along the north-south main road.

Cultural, Educational and Health Zone, to the east of the Administrative Zone, planned to have schools, health clinics, libraries, simple stadiums, and clubs.

Residential Zone, located in the northeast area of the main urban area, occupying the largest area—simple housing dormitories do not need to occupy such a large area, but considering that more than 500 people will organize their own families in the future, and the family size may be very large, so the housing base is reserved sufficiently first.

Industrial Products Storage Zone, storing materials, equipment, and machines transported from the 21st-century space-time, including arms. This area will have a separate wall.

Agricultural Zone, including agricultural product processing plants, granaries, veterinary stations, vegetable greenhouses, livestock pens, and a biogas digester.

Industrial Zone, various machinery, parts manufacturing, and equipment factories.

The main urban area plans zones completely according to functions. The residential zone is separated from the industrial zone, maximizing comfort and safety.

Since the heavy industry area has heavy pollution, and considering that Lingao is dominated by northeast winds, the heavy industry area is set on the west bank of the Wenlan River in the downwind area, including the planned steel plant, chemical plant, and those industries with serious pollution, such as the paper mill.

Outside the east gate of the main urban area, an open commercial trade zone will also be established for exchanging agricultural products, local specialties, and small commodities with local natives.

The grand Bairen City planning map won the unanimous approval of the Executive Committee. Almost simultaneously, some people began to compete for the position of their departments on the future "Chang'an Avenue". Who's ministry building could be closer to the Executive Committee Building almost caused some enthusiastic members to come to blows, until Wen Desi repeatedly explained that there were no ministry buildings at all in the current plan, nor was there such a thing as an Executive Committee Building; there was only a foundation marker for an administrative institution in the plan. Needless to say, everyone would be working in shared offices for a few years.

To start construction, it was no longer realistic to use the ship's auxiliary engine to supply power like on the beach. The Executive Committee had multiple choices, including diesel generator sets, wind turbine generator sets, and solar power stations. But these things each had pros and cons. Wind power in the inland area is limited; the power of a wind turbine is only 300 watts, almost useless except for lighting. Solar power generation is also very limited. Out of consideration for saving diesel, diesel generators are only used for emergency.

A tractor transported a strange-looking thing on a trailer from the beach base: black cast iron texture, with a chimney and flywheel, exposed pipes, various valves, pressure gauges... looked very steampunk. Everyone gathered around curiously.

"Locomobile." Ma Qianzhu answered everyone's questions simply and clearly. This thing is a power machine that uses a boiler to carry a steam engine. Its structure is simple, operation convenient, maintenance easy, and it can be both mobile and fixed. High usage efficiency, good operation reliability, can work continuously for a long time. The uses are also particularly extensive, from drainage, irrigation, rice milling, flour milling, oil pressing to driving generators for power generation or directly serving as power for various industrial machines. In this respect, it is very much like the single-cylinder diesel engine in modern rural areas. In comparison, its disadvantage is that it is much clumsier than a diesel engine, but clumsiness is not a problem for transmigrators. The key is that the boiler is not picky about food; it can use any fuel from wood, straw to low-quality coal, saving precious diesel.

Currently, locomobiles still have a certain market even when diesel engines are very popular. The Executive Committee purchased a total of 6 locomobiles, of which 2 are Czech-made single-胆 fire-tube horizontal compound condensing locomobiles, with a flywheel speed of 1000 rpm and a maximum power of 290 horsepower (213.15KW), which can generate more than 200 kWh of electricity per hour when driving a generator. This kind of locomobile is fixed and must work on level ground. The other 4 are 100-horsepower mobile units, which can be towed by cars, tractors, or even horses.
