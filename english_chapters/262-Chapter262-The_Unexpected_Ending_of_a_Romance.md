# Chapter 262 The Unexpected Ending of a Romance

"Whistling arrow!"

Everyone was startled—someone was attacking!

The exploration team had long prepared for road ambushes. Immediately, those with guns drew them, and those without pulled out their machetes, quickly forming a circle. Shopkeeper Wang, who was leading the way, was so scared that he dodged behind them.

"Quick, hold the cows! Don't let them get startled!" Xiong Buyou shouted while pulling a Derringer pistol from his pocket and putting on a percussion cap.

At a river bend ahead, twenty young men appeared. Judging by their dress, they were all Meifu Li people. Each held a hook knife, and some carried crossbows, looking ready for a fight as they blocked the path.

"Someone is blocking the road ahead!" Huang Zhuazi shouted. "All hands on alert!" He immediately blew his whistle.

"It's Li people!"

"No way?" Mu Min also rushed up from the rear. "We Li people never engage in highway robbery."

"Hmph, I'm afraid they're not here for money or goods, but for this 'treasure'." Huang Zhuazi glanced at Bida behind them. The woman, who had looked lifeless before, now seemed restless.

"Don't panic!" Mu Min shouted, calming the team members who were drawing their guns. "They aren't ambushing us; there's room for negotiation."

"I think they are mostly here for Bida," Cui Yunhong whispered. "What should we do?"

Mu Min thought, *Could it be Bida's boyfriend, the Zhen Huan that Li Benqing mentioned? This man is actually affectionate and righteous.* This stirred up her feminine sentimentality again. Thinking of her own husband who had zero romantic sense, she felt a pang of bitterness.

"If it's really that Zhen Huan, just give Bida back to him," she said.

"How can we do that? We promised to take her away—"

While they were discussing, a few people walked over from the opposite side. One of them had handsome features, and his clothes were obviously better than the others. He wore pheasant feathers on his head and indeed looked quite majestic. He stopped about fifty paces from the group and began to shout.

This time Xiong Buyou understood: he was speaking Hainan dialect. Although the tone was a bit off, it was generally understandable.

"Damn, it really is that Zhen Huan!" Xiong Buyou said. "He wants us to hand over Bida."

"What should we do?" Everyone's eyes fixed on Cui Yunhong and Mu Min. The former was the captain, and the latter was the person in charge of Li and Miao affairs.

"Hmph, daring to block the road with a few broken knives. Let me open your eyes." Huang Zhuazi muttered as he cocked the hammer of his Remington shotgun.

"No, hold your fire," Cui Yunhong quickly stopped him.

"There are only twenty of them; a volley of gunfire will finish it."

"We are strangers in a strange land here. Although we would definitely win if we fought, if we anger them and they chase us relentlessly, harassing and attacking us all the way, we might not be able to return to Changhua Fort peacefully even with guns."

"Mn, that makes sense." Huang Zhuazi thought about it and agreed.

Xiong Buyou said, "Besides, these people are all from the Zhen Dui Stockade. If we really kill a few, how can we cooperate in the future?"

Mu Min said, "Let her go. Bida is useless to us anyway. We only took her to save her life. Now since Zhen Huan is so affectionate and righteous, why should we insist on keeping her?"

Seeing no objection, Xiong Buyou walked out of the ranks unarmed and shouted in Hainan dialect, "As long as you move aside, we will release her after we pass."

Zhen Huan nodded and said, "You send a hostage over first. After you pass, we will release the hostage. Only then can I trust you!"

Hearing this, Xiong Buyou was furious. Since D-Day, the Transmigration Group had only ever imposed unequal treaties on others; when had they ever been threatened? Seeing that he was less than 30 meters away, a murderous intent rose in his heart, and he gripped the Derringer in his pocket. At this distance, one shot could leave Zhen Huan dead on the spot. Even if the opponents shot arrows, at a distance of seventy or eighty meters, they might not hit him. Then, combined with his brothers' shotguns, they could simply kill everyone.

Knowing what Xiong Buyou was thinking, Mu Min quickly shouted in Mandarin, "Don't act rashly! It will be hard to end if a fight starts." She turned to Cui Yunhong, "I'll go as a hostage so he clears the way."

Before Cui Yunhong could respond, Bida, who had been squatting on the ground, suddenly stood up. She shouted something in Li language, then spoke rapidly and urgently to Guide Wang. Guide Wang said to Mu Min, "She says she is willing to go and talk to Zhen Huan and ask him to clear the way."

Mu Min nodded, thinking this might make things easier. She said, "Tell her that once they clear the way and we pass, we will naturally let her go."

Hearing Guide Wang's words, a strange expression appeared on Bida's face. She shook her head and spoke again.

"She says she is willing to go with the *Bahas*."

Mu Min was startled. For a moment, she thought the guide had translated wrong, but seeing her determined demeanor, it wasn't nonsense. So she untied the rope and let her walk out.

Seeing that they had released the person, the opposite side showed joy, and the crowd behind cheered, waving their bows, crossbows, and knives.

Cui Yunhong watched Bida walk up to Zhen Huan. Zhen Huan tried to take her hand, but she pushed him away. The man seemed somewhat surprised, and the two began to mutter to each other. As Zhen Huan grew increasingly impatient, waving his arms continuously and occasionally shouting and shoving her, Bida remained motionless, only lowering her head and speaking softly, shaking her head from time to time. Her attitude was extremely resolute.

This pantomime played out between the two groups for a full ten minutes, long enough for the cows to start grazing. Zhen Huan showed an extremely violent expression. Finally, he turned around abruptly and walked away directly. Within a few minutes, the Li people on the river beach were completely gone, leaving only Bida standing there alone. Suddenly, she squatted down and burst into loud tears. The exploration team was stunned.

"What kind of drama is this?" Xiong Buyou muttered to himself.

Mu Min sighed, "Let's keep going."

Half a month after their departure, the exploration team returned to Changhua County seat. After bidding farewell to Shopkeeper Wang outside the city, the group returned to Changhua Fort. Li Haiping had been working on basic construction in the fort for more than half a month. The fort had begun to take shape, and cannons were mounted on the gun emplacements—to avoid provoking the local government, the cannons were concealed inside houses and would only be pulled out when needed.

Seeing the exploration team return fully loaded, Li Haiping was both happy and worried. The fort couldn't keep ten cows—these cows were of unknown breed, exceptionally large water buffaloes that looked almost half the size of elephants. He immediately ordered the marines to build a simple cattle pen outside the fort and assigned a few marines who had experience raising cattle to be in charge of herding. As for the traded goods and received gifts, no one was much interested; they were piled directly in the warehouse waiting for ships to come and pick them up.

A group of people idled in the fort. Apart from taking baths in the river branches by the Changhua River daily, they drank tea and chatted under the kapok tree outside the fort. During this time, they also did some basic construction: erecting a bamboo woven wall at one end of the river branch for the use of Mu Min and Bida. The exploration team's encounter at Zhen Dui Stockade became the most talked-about topic—initially just speculating on the truth, but gradually it evolved into entertainment. This Shanzhai version of a palace revenge drama became incredibly complex under the daily relentless gossip. Slowly, people even asked to sign up as background characters in it.

The heroine of this event, Bida, remained silent. Although she actively helped with various chores in the fort: cooking, washing clothes, sweeping, and feeding the cows. Since no one in Changhua Fort understood the Meifu Li language, Mu Min could never communicate with her.

As for what use the Zhen Dui Stockade would be to the transmigrators in recent years, no one could say for sure. Soap beans were indeed a good resource, but not urgently needed by the Transmigration Group. They were quite useful in Changhua Fort, though; everyone from top to bottom used them for bathing and washing clothes daily, finding the scent fresh and pleasant and the cleaning effective.

The Changhua County seat had now become their only place for recreation. The city was small, and after their many visits, almost everyone in the city recognized them, even though they found their hairstyles strange. They also became familiar with the bailiffs guarding the city gate. It turned out that the county didn't even have a magistrate, only a vice-magistrate acting in the role. As for the Battalion Commander of the local Wei-Suo, he simply lived on his farm outside the city. The few government offices were deserted and dilapidated; no wonder they hadn't realized those small tiled houses were government offices the few times they walked past.

Shopkeeper Qian of the Guangzhou warehouse had effectively become their agent in Changhua County. Through Shopkeeper Qian's connections, the transmigrators in Changhua Fort could buy fresh vegetables, poultry, and grain directly from the farm of the Commander outside the city. The Commander and his subordinates clearly didn't feel there was anything improper about doing business with these people of unknown origin, especially when the goods they offered were white sugar and distilled spirits—items severely lacking locally. Xiong Buyou also bought dozens of sheep from the farm, partly for their own consumption and partly to send back to Lingao along with the cattle.

The 15W radio received telegrams from the fleet and the Lingao main station every day. Sometimes they would receive telegrams from the Guangzhou Station, with all sides reporting safety. From the telegrams, they learned that the exploration fleet had already arrived at Yulin Harbor and was conducting an inspection of another important target of this expedition: the Tiandu Iron Mine.

Yulin Harbor was the best port in Hainan. Moreover, it was less than twelve kilometers from the high-grade Tiandu iron ore field, making it far superior to Shilu in terms of mining difficulty.

If they sailed directly from Lingao to Yazhou, the coastal route would take only four days. The exploration fleet departing from Changhua only needed two days. Because they stopped occasionally to go ashore for inspections, each time taking half a day to a day, and specifically inspected the Yinggehai Salt Field in Le'an, Yazhou, en route. The Yinggehai Salt Field would be the largest salt field in Hainan and the largest sea salt field in southern China in the future. The seawater concentration here reached 3.5 degrees Baumé, making it one of the saltiest sea areas in the world after the Red Sea, known as the "Bitter Sea." At this time, it was still a desolate coastal salt marsh area, uninhabited. Ming Qiu, who knew the development history of Hainan well, told everyone that the preparation for Yinggehai Salt Field began in 1955, and it entered a stage of great development in 1958 with the arrival of more than 5,600 professional soldiers.

Ideally, the massive amount of sea salt was the best raw material base for the chemical industry. Everyone from Wang Luobin onwards looked greedily at this barren tidal flat. Hainan Island was truly a treasure island.

The fleet conducted on-site exploration at Yinggehai and then continued. On the sixth day after departing from Changhua, the lookout on the *Zhenhai* noticed that the ship was sailing in a huge bay. The white sand on the beach, the swaying coconut trees, and the blue seawater all indicated that they were close to Sanya.

"This is Sanya Bay." Chen Haiyang checked the latitude and longitude measurements of the naval cadets. "We are not far from Yulin."

Sanya Bay at this time looked even more beautiful and primitive than in later generations. There were some scattered villages at the foot of the mountains, and grid-like salt fields along the coast.

After another few hours of sailing, the lookout at the top of the mast finally saw the iconic 213-meter-high small hill on the Luhuitou Peninsula.

Arriving at Luhuitou meant arriving at Yulin Harbor. The Luhuitou Naval Port would be an important base for the South Sea Fleet in the future. Standing on the deck, Ming Qiu saw the familiar scenery before him and was filled with emotions, recalling the days and nights of combat readiness here in 1974. He couldn't help but mutter the Vietnamese words he had rush-learned back then:

"*Ya di!* (Halt!), *Lao song kong ye!* (Drop your guns and we won't kill!), *Zhong dui kuan hong du bian!* (We treat captives leniently!)."

"Master Ming," Mont walked over curiously, "What are you saying?"

"Vietnamese." The temperature here was very high, exceeding thirty degrees Celsius on the deck. Many people were shirtless or wearing undershirts, but Ming Qiu was still dressed in his Type 87 naval summer uniform, impeccably neat. Standing on the deck, he made many otakus who self-proclaimed to be future admirals of a transmigrator nation feel ashamed.

"In the spring of 1974," Ming Qiu said, pointing to the distant Luhuitou, "our troops were stationed there, participating in pre-war mobilization preparing to attack the Crescent Group of the Paracel Islands. At that time, the Yankees couldn't fight in Vietnam anymore and started to withdraw. That ungrateful North Vietnam was taking the opportunity to move south, and South Vietnam was about to finish. To avoid unnecessary trouble after the war, the chiefs issued an order to recover the Paracels. I was just a soldier then—"

"You participated in the recovery of the Paracels?" Mont was filled with reverence.

"Actually, no." Ming Qiu shook his head. "I was on standby here in Sanya the whole time. In the autumn of '74, our detachment was transferred to Lingshui to participate in anti-landing exercises. We even filmed a movie."

Mont wanted to learn more about the events of that year from him, but Chen Haiyang had already ordered the sails lowered, preparing to enter Yulin Harbor. He had to quickly return to his post.

Yulin Harbor was far superior to the adjacent Sanya Bay. Sanya Bay had an overly open water surface and was subject to fierce storms. Therefore, ships bound for the South Seas often anchored here temporarily for shelter. As the fleet sailed past the Luhuitou Cape, they saw quite a few ships scattered in the bay. Some had tall masts, obviously merchant ships trading with Southeast Asia.
