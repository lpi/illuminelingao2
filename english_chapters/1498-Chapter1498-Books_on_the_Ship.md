# Chapter 1498 - Books on the Ship

The route from Guangzhou to Xiamen was one they were accustomed to traveling. The traditional route sailed along the coastline; as long as care was taken to avoid reefs and grounding, there would be no danger.

Therefore, once the entire ship was on the shipping lane, except for the helmsmen responsible for watching the compass and reciting course directions who maintained vigilance observing sea surface and coastline conditions at all times, everyone else had a lazy appearance. Working sailors also had relaxed looks. *Dongshanju* used soft sails, which indeed was somewhat unaccustomed initially for Chinese sailors used to operating simple hard sails. Fortunately, soft sail usage wasn't some amazing secret technique; many European ships sailing in East Asia and Southeast Asia hired Malays and Chinese as sailors. Finding people who knew wasn't hard; veterans leading novices, sailing a few voyages made them familiar. Among them, inevitably a few accidents happened when climbing masts to tie yards, killing or injuring some sailors, but in this spacetime human life wasn't rare; this didn't count as a thing.

For merchant ships sailing along the coast, weather was fine, wind direction favorable; except for sailors on duty, others were happy to be relaxed, each having their own way to kill time. Sailor fellows either gathered in the bottom hold studying dice points and domino permutations, or drank a couple of mouthfuls then caught lice and chatted on deck; some simply slept soundly. As for Big Boss and Second Boss, one was grabbing poor Manager Liu playing Xiangqi, the other was holding a book reading with great joy.

"Huamin, what book is that? You reading so seriously?" Liu Deshan moved the Chariot 2 to bottom, smiled looking at Manager Liu who was frowning in deep thought, turned head to ask.

"Oh, it's a book bought in a Wanbi Bookstore opened by Australians when passing Hangzhou last time."

"I've seen books printed by Australians; indeed consistently beautifully printed. But Huamin didn't you give up thoughts of imperial exams? Why picking up these eight-legged essays again now?"

Chen Huamin scratched his head embarrassedly, laughing: "This isn't classics or history, just a leisure book, a Vernacular novel."

"Vernacular novel? *Three Kingdoms*? *Water Margin*? Or *Golden Lotus*?"

"None, it's a vernacular novel written by Kun people, a volume very highly praised among Jiangnan scholars recently."

"Oh?! What is it about?" Hearing it was written by Australians, Chen Huamin got interested, no longer paying attention to Manager Liu staring blankly at the chessboard.

"Don't know who wrote this book; everyone says it came from Australian hands. Title is *Old Affairs of Guardian Huang Resisting Kin*. Tells about a xiucai surnamed Huang named Shi from Tianjin Wei of our dynasty, don't know how returned to early Southern Song, worshipped under Marshal Yue's door, and was bestowed courtesy name 'Qubing' [Remove Illness/Invade like Huo Qubing] by Yue Wumu. Then Huang Shi helped Marshal Yue organize army and military, defeating invading Jin soldiers greatly several times. And after Marshal Yue was harmed unjustly, he contended with treacherous court officials on one hand, while supporting Southern Song state alone on the other, finally a story of rebuilding Huaxia land."

"Sounds very exciting! Just how can this modern man go to past era? Unavoidably illogical."

"Speaking of it, it's just a story like Dream under Pagoda Tree. Just that although writing is simple, this story can move soul. I am now reading the section 'Marshal Shi alone enters Yanyun to behead slave chief,' truly soul-stirring, leaping onto paper ah! As if there really was such a great hero striving to keep my Han family river and mountains from loss. No wonder among Jiangnan scholars, evaluation of this book and this marshal is 'One body fights across three thousand li, one sword blocks one million soldiers.'" Chen Huamin spoke excitedly, stood up posing holding sword pointing straight, as if he himself was the great general in the book leading elite soldiers and fierce generals to sweep Tartar slave barbarians out of Central Plain.

But then, Chen Huamin sat down gloomily, murmuring: "If my Great Ming really had a figure like Marshal Huang, how could we be beaten to walls of Beijing by Jianzhou slaves, like entering empty territory!"

"Huamin!"

A soft shout pulled Chen Huamin's thoughts back.

"Sorry sorry! Too absorbed in the play, unconsciously lost mind."

"No harm, just listening to the intro makes blood boil, as if personally on scene—also fits shadowing Liaodong war situation. Not strange Huamin would get lost here."

"Exactly, although Liaodong is thousand li away from here, fate of a country concerns common people of world. Nowadays hearing northern situation gets worse day by day. Truly afraid one day Great Ming will repeat disastrous track of Great Song!"

Liu Deshan as an ordinary merchant wasn't particularly concerned about Liaodong situation, hearing Chen Huamin speak so seriously felt somewhat disapproving: "Eastern Barbarians certainly can hit under Capital city walls, but anyhow Liaodong and Capital still have hundreds of thousands of great army. Slave chief country small soldiers few, even if subordinate slave soldiers are iron all over, how many nails can they hit? Can't ruin the big picture."

Chen Huamin shook head: "Cousin, you and I are both people who read a few years of books, but on world general trend, insight is truly shallow." Saying this, he took out a book from his carry-on book box.

This book format was different from *Old Affairs of Guardian Huang Resisting Kin*, twice as large, but much thinner. Also that Australian left-opening binding, cover had picture, a warrior in full armor riding a black horse, standing in ice and snow. Although only black and white two colors, don't know what unique secret technique engraver and printer had, portrayed warrior, horse and background landscape lifelike, making people feel on scene.

Header was however five Song typeface characters "War History Research," below still a line of small characters: Liaodong War Situation Special Issue. Cover also listed subheadings: *Heavy Snow Full on Bow and Sword—Beginning and End of Great Ming Managing Liaodong*, *Impact of Denglai Rebellion on Liaodong Situation*, *Analysis of Eight Banners System*, *Beginning and End of Huangtaiji Ascending Throne*...

Liu Deshan didn't linger in Guangzhou as often as Chen Huamin, not very familiar with Australian things, but looking at this book's binding, title and sentence style, at a glance it was printed by Australians. He originally didn't care much about military matters, but this cover and title were too attractive, he still took it to flip through a few pages.

Once flipping, it made one fondle admiringly. Don't look at Australians writing articles all using vernacular, but for people like Liu Deshan who didn't read much books, it wasn't difficult to read. Articles were popular and easy to understand, analysis from shallow to deep, explaining one by one very clearly, also quite interesting, even merchants like Liu Deshan felt interested reading. He didn't love reading war management matters, flipped directly to "Palace Secret News" type *Beginning and End of Huangtaiji Ascending Throne*, reading with relish. Ignoring Manager Liu beside him staring eyes big and small still waiting for him to place piece, until finishing reading did he raise head, saying: "Truly satisfying! I think even the Court probably may not know enemy situation so detailedly!"

Chen Huamin nodded: "Exactly! So-called know self know enemy, hundred battles no danger. I see in Court nowadays, regarding Eastern Barbarians internal situation, afraid just blind men touching elephant. How can they know as clearly as Australians? Let alone discussion and commentary in this article, I see although there are many officials in this Court, few can be found having such insight." He sighed, "Australians are not my Great Ming commoners, yet care much about Liaodong war situation, truly rare."

Liu Deshan sighed: "If Australians were willing to serve Court, even one hundred Eastern Barbarians would be extinguished. Zheng family so terrible, in one day vanished in smoke and fire!"

Chen Huamin sneered: "Australians have such ability, how would they be willing to serve Court? I see them sooner or later—"

Manager Liu paled with shock; although this was on own ship, speaking such words was still greatly improper. Not speaking of government, even if Australians knew they might not like it, hurriedly said: "Young Master speak cautiously! Speak cautiously!"

Chen Huamin then stopped talking: Manager Liu was trusted family servant, naturally for his own good. But thinking Australians really wanted to change dynasty, actually nothing bad—at least under their rule, everyone's days passed quite well.

Liu Deshan said: "Old nesting under this deck, stifling tight, let's go on deck to catch breeze."

Three people got on deck, Chen Huamin asked loudly: "Little Wang, where has ship sailed to now?"

"Reply to Captain, just entered Xiamen boundary, sailing further not far is Xiamen."

At this moment, lookout voice came from mast top: "Ship discovered ahead, approaching at high speed!"

Two people together with Wang Chengti immediately ran to bow, each taking out a single-tube telescope to look.

Looking for a while, Wang Chengti said: "It's triangular sail fast ship, also flying blue background star flag, Australian!"

Chen Huamin put down telescope: "Mn, looking at ship type should be patrol fast clipper. Looks like Australians have formally designated this sea area as their territory."

Voice came from mast again: "Opponent signals, want us to stop ship for inspection."

"Do as usual"

"Yes." Wang Chengti turned head shouting: "Lower all sails, raise Lingao navigation flag."

"Don't lie down, get up quick, dead kid! That one over there, more strength, didn't eat full rice?!"

After *Dongshanju* stopped steadily, patrol triangular sail ship came alongside. Officer on ship led several sailors boarding, first checked ship's Lingao registration documents, checked cargo manifest, finally told people to open cargo hold cover, inspected carefully for a while, finally asked: "Your ship carries this much salt, preparing to go to Xiamen for sale?"

Liu Deshan was very clever, immediately answered: "This is to transport to Shanghai to sell..."

"Have salt license?"

This hit his death spot. Liu Deshan hemmed and hawed for a while, had to make excuse this was "private salt."

"Jiangnan private salt always comes from north, when did it smuggle from Guangdong? Aren't you afraid of losing capital?" Officer sneered, "Don't lie: this salt you prepare to sell in Xiamen."

Liu Deshan swallowed saliva; denying and bribing both didn't work here with Australians, he had to smile apologetically: "You Sir are wise: this salt is indeed prepared to transport to Xiamen Island to sell. Little man eyes covered by copper coin turning somersault, momentarily ghost confused heart, wanted to earn a few small coins..."
