# Chapter 147: Steelmaking

Though transmigrators' modern fishing-boats had absolute-advantages in reconnaissance, protection, speed, and mobility—firepower was pathetically-weak. If instead of three pirate-ships, thirty had come—lone Fishing-1 probably wouldn't fare well. Fujian-Guangdong's major pirate-lords each had at least 300–400 ships. For entire Bopu Harbor: transmigrators' activity-range and facilities had far exceeded Bopu-camp boundaries. 200+ transmigrators and commune-members were scattered across vast-spaces—almost completely undefended.

Conclusion: besides naval-equipment upgrades, Bopu Harbor fortification also needed attention. Staff-recommendations included: building gun-emplacements; batch-producing at least 1800-level cannons; producing and stockpiling ammunition; establishing coastal-patrol fleet. This fleet would mainly comprise steam-sail-ships—conserving fishing-boats' major-overhaul lifespan. Travelers couldn't perform such overhauls for 5–10 years. Even simple hull-painting was impossible—not lacking materials, but unable to achieve modern anti-rust/toxic hull-paint effectiveness.

Cannon-production was assigned to Industrial-Department's Mechanical-Group. For weapon-enthusiasts, this was pure-adrenaline. After frustrating days making trivial-hardware—even mechanical-crossbows were all-wood—finally they could make real-cannons! Everyone was energized. Mechanical-plant's sheds saw endless streams of artillery-enthusiasts—proposals varied wildly. Designs mainly concentrated on three types: 12-pounder mountain-howitzer; nimble multi-purpose Type-92 infantry-gun; all-rounder mortars. Various personal-favorites added different-functions and improvements.

Cannon-making required massive steel. *Deng Yingzhou* had already shipped two batches of pig-iron ingots and small quantities of wrought-iron from Guangzhou—totaling 50 tons. Also 20 tons of urgently-needed coal. Roughly sufficient for initial-scale steelmaking.

Travelers used converter-steelmaking. In 21st-century timespace, small-converters were nationally-mandated obsolete-industries. Here, they were genuinely advanced. This industry was headquartered at Bopu Harbor District.

Choosing Bopu: Lingao's steel-combine was entirely import-dependent—ships bringing bulk-coal and iron-ore could be used immediately nearby. Current steelmaking-workshop was just a large brick-pillar shed. Hardened ground-floor held 4 small-converters and 1 cupola-furnace in a row.

Metallurgy-head Ji Wusheng had been a steelworker. Though he'd never personally done small-converter steelmaking—he understood principles. Since D-Day, he'd produced several steel-heats—proving wood-charcoal and local pig-iron products could make steel. Downside: difficulty controlling material-ratios meant random steel-grades per heat. Also, metallurgy's energy-consumption was enormous—just two blast-fans during steelmaking shut down all neighboring power-users.

Based on analyzed pig-iron composition, Metallurgy-Group used converter side-blowing: adding wrought-iron proportionally. Ratio: approximately 76% pig-iron, 24% wrought-iron, plus minimal sand. Sand created acidic-slag—absorbing phosphorus from pig-iron.

After discovering local refractory-materials, Metallurgy-Group built a cupola-furnace. This round smelting-furnace wasn't large—but far more complex than converters. Converters required 1380°C iron-liquid from cupolas. This temperature was unreachable by ordinary fuels—before regenerators, human-achievable maximum was 1250°C.

Reaching this temperature required replacing cold-blast with hot-blast—the "regenerator." Hot-blast was invented by Englishman Neilson—applied at Glasgow ironworks in 1829.

Metallurgy-Group's regenerator was roughly 1850-British-level—using cast-iron-pipe hot-blast stoves. Cold-blast from blower-main was branched to each heating-furnace, passing through arched cast-iron pipes over fires to heat-exchanger opposite-side pipes, then into cupola tuyeres. Entire apparatus was sealed in thick brick-and-refractory arched heating-furnace—preserving and reflecting maximum-heat. Direct-heated blast reached 300°C—sufficient to melt lead. But this temperature still dissatisfied Metallurgy-Group. Additional measure: waste-gas heating. Ceramic-pipes drew cupola-exhaust from top, entering regenerator from above, exiting through bottom waste-outlet.

Coal/coke cupolas produced substantial gas. For centuries, this gas was simply vented from furnace-tops. Nighttime burning-flames were spectacular—but severely-wasteful and polluting. In 1832, a Baden German ironworks first piped gas to regenerators for heating. Multiple techniques ultimately raised hot-blast above 500°C.

Without regenerators, iron/steel smelting was still possible—but production-efficiency was incomparable. Per British calculations, early regenerators raising blast to 300+°C tripled iron-output per fuel-unit versus cold-blast.

High-temperature hot-blast damaged cupola tuyeres—protection was required. Travelers' technical-level could overcome this. They easily copied the Scottish-tuyere invented by Condie at Scottish ironworks: a wrought-iron coiled-tube fitted into cast-iron conical-tube, ends extending beyond cone-base. Water entered from one extending-pipe-end, circled to tuyere's narrow-end. Water circulated through coil, exiting through opposite extending-pipe.

With this cupola, Metallurgy-Group successfully produced steel in several small-scale heats. Next step: coking.

Travelers initially used charcoal—but coke remained ideal-fuel. Coal-coking's significance wasn't just high-quality fuel for iron/steel—coking by-products were crucial chemical-industry feedstocks. So they'd brought complete coal-coking equipment. Besides coking, by-products could produce 20+ important chemicals: gasoline, diesel, asphalt, phenol, toluene, crude-benzene, sulfuric-acid, various solvent-oils, lubricants, paraffin. Once coal-coking enterprise went operational, transmigrators' chemical-capabilities would leap qualitatively.

However, like all complete-systems, installation was extremely-difficult. Despite manufacturer-training, abundant drawings, manuals, and specialized-equipment—in amateur-installers' hands, progress was slow. This system was continuous-operation—couldn't stop-and-start. Single-batch required 100+ tons coal. Travelers' total coal-reserves were just 20 tons. So Metallurgy-Group could only use simple indigenous-coking.

Indigenous-coking had many methods. Simplest: open-pile method—2–4 tons coal piled semi-circular on ground, 3–4m base-diameter, straw-covered for ignition, 4–5 days to coke. Yield only 50%. This method was used during Great-Leap era—causing severe waste and pollution. Travelers could ignore environmental-issues—but coal-tar was important chemical-feedstock; couldn't be wasted.

Luo Duo again found an improved-method in computer-resources: Kailuan-style round-furnace coking. Kailuan furnaces had three sizes—batch-loading 55 to 260 tons. 55-ton furnace had best cost-efficiency—suiting transmigrators' limited-coal early-stage.

Construction-materials were simple: besides some sheet-iron components, basics were brick and fire-brick. Entire coking-process took ~12 days; yield 75%. This furnace could utilize coking-generated gas for heating—while recovering some coal-tar. Water-cooled-and-recovered tar was collected in clay-jars for future chemical-feedstock.

Finally, coke and pig-iron were ready. Ji Wusheng assembled steelworkers. These recently-converted transmigrators wore asbestos-suits and gloves, specialized-caps and photochromic-goggles. He reminded everyone of key-points: first, wind-volume adjustment must be gradual—no sudden-changes; second, iron-liquid poured into furnace mustn't exceed tuyere-level—otherwise blocking tuyeres; finally, iron-liquid volume per-pour mustn't exceed one-sixth of converter-chamber.

Both blowers started simultaneously—one blowing cupola, gradually raising temperature above 1300°C. Pig-iron ingots completely melted. Ji Wusheng then directed workers to add 0.4% baking-soda for desulfurization. Meanwhile, converter was preheating. Per requirements, entire converter needed 1000°C preheating—reducing temperature-loss when iron-liquid entered.

When optical-pyrometer showed cupola iron-liquid reaching 1380°C, iron was poured into converter for blowing. Blower-pressure maintained 0.07–0.12 atmospheres. Iron-liquid continuously heated under high-temperature hot-blast. Ji Wusheng watched furnace-flames intently. Iron-sparks continuously burst; flame-color progressed red-yellow → yellow-white → white → brilliant-white. This indicated steadily-rising furnace-temperature.

Blowing continued ~10 minutes. Star-shaped carbon-sparks intensified; brilliant-white flames lengthened from short. Carbon-combustion peaked.

When Ji Wusheng saw flames shortening and carbon-sparks thinning, he knew residual-carbon approached steel-content. He rocked the furnace once or twice with tilting-levers—checking for more carbon-sparks. Seeing no sudden-increase—he ordered wind-shutoff.

Subsequently, workers removed furnace-lids and blast-pipes, began slag-skimming and removal, finally pouring. Mold-sand was 90% yellow-sand, 5% clay, 5% white-mud. After casting—steel-ingots. Whether high/medium/low-carbon, Ji Wusheng couldn't yet control. Each heat required testing to determine steel-type.
