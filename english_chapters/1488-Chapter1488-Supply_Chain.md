# Chapter 1488 - Supply Chain

Like a bomb exploding in the conference room, the audience first maintained silence, then quickly stirred up a chaotic buzz of discussion.

"Comrade Wu Mu," someone asked: "Such a serious case, could it be done by naturalized citizens alone? Could there be Senators—"

"No Senator is involved in this case. In fact, it's impossible," Wu Mu answered categorically. "All criminals have been arrested." His gaze swept over everyone in the conference room, "I feel suspecting comrades on this issue is very, very, very inappropriate."

"Delete this dialogue from the meeting minutes." Jiang Shan raised his eyelids and said, "Rather than suspecting pointlessly who did it, better consider how to prevent it—I believe comrades of the Political Security Bureau have concrete measures. Now let's return to the question about Hale."

"Another point must be pointed out. Everyone should know that after Technology Department review, some of our self-produced instruments are listed in the Foreign Commerce Commission's export product catalog, such as balances, microscopes, gauges, sextants, quadrants, levels, slide rules, vernier calipers, vacuum pumps, etc. Because prototypes of such instruments have mostly appeared in Europe. Due to high pricing, plus our products all using metric units, sales volume isn't large. All purchasing clients are on record. But whether these instruments fall into Hale's hands after changing hands several times, no one can say for sure."

"Since not many can be sold anyway, why export? What exactly is the Ministry of Colonization and Trade thinking?!"

"I see this person Sikade has problems; his tendency to go rogue is very serious!"

"Before Operation Engine, he repeatedly proposed appeasing the Zheng clique and opposed using force. His motives are suspicious!"

"Must thoroughly investigate capitulationist tendencies to the end! I suggest launching a loyalty investigation on him!"

"Loyalty investigation my ass! Investigate his economic problems directly."

The discussion grew even noisier. Wu Mu saw Navy Chief of Staff Li Di gesticulating to neighbors right and left, expressing that the Ministry of Colonization and Trade, even the entire Executive Committee's "treasonous crimes," must be settled.

"Unless a decision is made to conduct a targeted trade blockade, transit trade is very hard to control," Jiang Shan spoke only after the decibel level in the venue dropped slightly. "Direct trade with the Philippines conducted by the Southeast Asia Company basically sells traditional goods. Shipped to Manila are raw silk, silk fabrics, porcelain, sugar, fruit products, and tea. Of course, our specialties also include salt, distilled spirits, and glass products. These goods are roughly the same as those traditionally shipped by Chinese merchants to the Philippines, squeezing their market to a considerable extent. They had to settle for second best, turning to ship heavy goods like copper, iron, and hardware. Exactly catching up with Spaniards purchasing metal materials in large quantities after Hale arrived in Manila, even taking out shining silver to buy iron woks and copper cash, and of course crucial mercury."

"Of course, Philippine authorities don't wish for only one supplier. So Portuguese transported large amounts of Indian iron from Goa, plus tin from Malacca and copper from Burma. Portuguese competition plus low profit in selling copper and iron bulk goods caused foreign merchants from Fujian and Guangdong to swarm to Hong Kong, Sanya, Kaohsiung, and all trade ports under our control. What can they do there? Naturally, buy our products in bulk to ship to Manila for sale. Leaving aside whether it's possible, at least previously when Hale's presence wasn't completely confirmed, implementing a trade blockade made no sense. After all, trade with the Philippines is our main channel to obtain many important commodities and large amounts of precious metal hard currency. Navy comrades often express the need for large amounts of Manila hemp to make sails, cables, and anchor ropes."

Li Di looked a bit embarrassed. Of course, not long after, he started vigorously advocating "Great White Fleet strikes straight at Manila Bay, kill all white skins and rob resources."

"Let's look at Lando's report. Intelligence he obtained from Manila port authorities indicates Spanish colonial authorities are deliberately guiding Chinese merchants to ship and sell certain specially needed 'Australian goods.' For instance, in the last two months, they imported 263 cases of soap."

"Comrade Lando's influence isn't small," someone joked. "Unwashed white skins are actually driven by him to buy soap."

"Spaniards couldn't use that much soap even bathing daily. Mechanical industry sector comrades pointed out strong soap water can serve as cooling lubricant for industrial drills and various turning tools and punch press work. Additionally, around the same time, Manila imported over 600 cases of Australian matches. I'm afraid absolutely not just for lighting cigars. Comrades here all serve in troops and powerful organs, having more or less some military industry background, so you should know that for Hale, those aren't matches at all, but red phosphorus and potassium chlorate. The quantity may not count as too much, but at least it saves him quite a bit of precious mercury fulminate in detonators and friction primers."

"Truly a smart enough bastard!"

"Why do we export soap? Is our own soap already abundant enough to supply openly?"

"Of course not. Our industrial sector mainly uses soapberry powder in similar applications. Effect is about the same, corrosiveness relatively small. In comparison, soap export added value is high, beneficial for us to import more goods from the Philippines."

"Not only these. The latest intelligence is that Manila authorities are very interested in various grain products we produce, especially favoring the flagship product of Tianchu Food Company's Jeju Branch—dried potato vermicelli. They have already purchased over a ton."

"To improve meals? Or is the Jap cooking up some strange scheme again?"

"To improve meals they could buy Lingao rice vermicelli produced by Tianchu Lingao Branch, worthy of being called cheap and good. But the Jap obviously isn't stupid—mixed in it is sweet potato flour, fiber content too high. By comparison, Jeju potato vermicelli, except for a small amount of alum as additive, is almost pure starch. According to intelligence we grasped before, Hale is trial-producing nitro-starch explosives and has experimentally produced a small amount of finished product. If he can obtain a stable starch source without painstakingly planting tubers and corn and refining starch himself, undoubtedly it makes him take another step on the road to mass-producing high explosives."

Bursts of exclamation, cursing, and complaints erupted in the conference room. "I don't understand," General Staff representative Dongmen Chuiyu said: "Three acids and two alkalis, manufacturing explosives and mercury fulminate requires at least two. Where can Hale get them? Ordering from Comrade Ji Tuisi?"

"News from Portuguese merchants in Macau: someone once ordered quite a few strangely styled lead pipes, lead sheets, and lead tanks aimed at Goa foundries. After the order was completed, they were all delivered to Manila. Inferring from this, Hale used these things to assemble a small lead chamber for manufacturing sulfuric acid. Maybe Hale even modified wine bottles and glass bowls we sold into chemical experiment equipment. Raw material is possibly sulfur produced in the Taipei area. Recently, contact between Manila and garrisons in Danshui and Keelung in northern Taiwan is quite frequent. On average, one ship sails to the two places monthly to transport supplies and bring back goods. This figure is too high—in past years only one or two ships a year. Intelligence shows a noteworthy matter: Spaniards on Taiwan Island recently changed their traditional policy, no longer paying tobacco and spices instead of sulfur as in-kind remuneration to Chinese migrant workers building cities for them. This may be under instructions from the Philippine Governor. All sulfur undoubtedly went to Manila. Additionally, they are reinforcing the Danshui castle, transporting new cannons and companies, obviously. Spaniards won't spare using force to guarantee Taiwan's sulfur supply."

"As for nitric acid, it should be manufactured using the saltpeter method. Spaniards ship Indian saltpeter by the shipload from Goa. As a return, Philippine Governor Juan Salamanca even withdrew the petition demanding a ban on Portuguese trading in Manila. However," Jiang Shan continued: "Comrade Lando managed to create some obstacles for the Spaniards. He provoked a duel according to European customs, killing the chief Spanish contractor procuring Indian goods for Philippine authorities. Now Manila's saltpeter import volume already shows a downward trend."

"Sounds very impressive. Why doesn't he simply finish off Hale together?"

"I hold skepticism regarding his ability to manufacture mass-produced nitric acid." Xu Yingjie said, "Whether mercury fulminate or nitro-starch, concentrated nitric acid is needed. The process to manufacture concentrated nitric acid is very complex. Merely having saltpeter and concentrated sulfuric acid won't make it."

Even Lingao's chemical sector spent great effort to make 97% concentrated nitric acid. The principle of nitric acid concentration is simple, but the realization process is quite complex.

"Then where does his mercury fulminate come from? Samples retrieved by Lando were analyzed by you, conclusion report also issued by your chemical sector."

"First, mercury fulminate doesn't require concentrated nitric acid; what's needed is nitric acid of relatively high purity. These are two different things. The key is that nitric acid produced by heating sulfuric acid and saltpeter together contains relatively many impurities—I'm very interested in what method he uses to remove impurities and increase purity. What's certain is that when using this nitric acid to make mercury fulminate or nitro-starch, he inevitably runs huge risks. That he hasn't been blown to death yet makes me feel very surprised..."

"I'm afraid it's just not him who gets blown to death."

"Not afraid of dead people, not afraid of spending money, small-scale manufacturing should be possible; large quantity definitely won't do. As for nitro-starch, I feel under the same premise he can also manufacture it."

"In summary," Dongmen Chuiyu concluded: "The munitions industry Hale runs in Manila actually relies heavily on external raw material supply, as well as instruments, equipment, and upstream products obtained from us. Without these, he can't make it work."

"No matter how genius Hale is, he is just one person. Building a self-sufficient, mutually supporting industrial system from scratch is completely a fairy tale."
