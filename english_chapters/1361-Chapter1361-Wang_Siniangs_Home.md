# Chapter 1361 - Wang Siniang's Home

The Phoenix Mountain Estate General Management Office was a complex of buildings resembling a small town with only a single street. It was located not far from the Phoenix Mountain Estate residence and several servant housing areas, convenient for comings and goings. Lining both sides of the flagstone street were workshops, warehouses, and shops, as well as the estate's operational core: the General Management Office building.

This building was a two-story brick-and-timber structure with arcades, perched atop high stone steps. On either side of the main door stood bulletin boards plastered with various "notices." However, most of the estate's tenants and servants were illiterate, so they walked past without a glance.

The Phoenix Mountain Estate General Management Office operated according to a modern agricultural enterprise model. Phoenix Mountain Estate itself was a large enterprise integrating agriculture, industry, and commerce. From the very beginning, Zhao Yingong had transplanted the entire management system used by enterprises under the Agricultural Committee. He had also brought in a small number of "politically reliable" naturalized cadres to serve as the backbone of the General Management Office, while gradually promoting capable and trustworthy individuals from among the local servants to serve as mid-level managers.

Although nominally under the Hangzhou Station's management, Phoenix Mountain Estate's production and operations often followed instructions directly from the Agricultural Committee and the Ministry of Light Industry. Though Zhao Yingong had final decision-making authority over specific operations, he rarely directly interfered in the estate's production matters—in truth, he couldn't manage everything anyway.

As a "foreman," Wang Siniang's only interaction with the General Management Office was coming here each day to collect work orders and turn in tally tokens after work. Beyond that, at the end of each month she came here to collect her wages and purchase daily necessities.

Along the Management Office street stood one large shop: a three-bay, two-story building. It resembled the comprehensive stores that the Cooperative had opened in Kaohsiung—and indeed, it was a branch operated by the Commercial Department's General Cooperative. It sold all manner of daily goods. The second floor doubled as a small restaurant. The customers, naturally, were all of Phoenix Mountain Estate's servants. Currently, servants registered at Phoenix Mountain Estate, together with their families, had expanded to six or seven hundred people—a small town in its own right.

To ensure personnel stability and control, Zhao Yingong employed no long-term or short-term hired laborers except for a few essential specialists. Aside from a few highly technical positions, all work was done by "dead-contract" bondservants selected from among the refugees taken in. As for rough labor and seasonal short-term work, those were filled by refugees awaiting transfer at the riverside refugee camp.

Phoenix Mountain Estate was a closed economic system. Everyone registered at the estate, regardless of age or sex, received monthly wages for their labor—but these wages came not in silver or copper cash, but in Delong Bank circulation vouchers.

Delong Bank also had a sub-branch on the Management Office street, specifically responsible for wage disbursement and also offering savings services. Its primary function was to handle capital allocation and turnover for the Hangzhou Station, ensuring every sum was under effective supervision.

At first, the servants were somewhat unaccustomed to receiving circulation vouchers, but seeing that the store carried abundant, high-quality goods at fair prices, they accepted the arrangement. Though Phoenix Mountain was just outside the city, it was quite far from the commercial district. Having such a shop nearby was much more convenient.

The monthly wages paid to servants circulated through the commercial street and returned to the Hangzhou Station's accounts. This effectively reduced silver usage while indirectly bolstering the circulation vouchers—preparation for the next step of introducing the vouchers into the Hangzhou market.

Neither Zhao Yingong nor the Planning Commission were heartless capitalists. The prices of goods on the commercial street were not only reasonable but actually somewhat cheaper than outside. However, since the Cooperative's local supplies came at wholesale prices, and many items were produced by the estate itself or shipped from Lingao at internal transfer prices, actual profit margins were still quite handsome. Estate residents could also apply to exchange circulation vouchers for silver or copper cash at a set rate and within certain limits, enabling them to spend outside. But since most daily necessities were available on the estate at prices lower than outside, there was little incentive to make such exchanges.

It was now around five-thirty in the afternoon. The street was bustling with people—some shopping, others preparing to start the night shift. There was almost a sense of liveliness. "Street lamps" lined the road—actually iron fire-baskets already piled with firewood, waiting to be lit at dusk.

Wang Siniang arrived at the "Tally Office" under the eaves of the General Management Office. Its doors stood wide open. Inside, seven or eight clerks clattered away at their abacuses. Foremen who had finished their shifts were queuing up with their tally books to record their work. The daily tally slips would be consolidated as the basis for month-end wage payments. She handed over the day's tea-picking tally tokens. The clerk already had the delivery receipt from the tea factory; once the two matched, he stamped "Verified" on the work slip receipt and handed it back—the foreman kept this receipt as verification in case of any disputes when wages were issued.

Wang Siniang was attractive and clever, with a wide circle of acquaintances who would chat with her wherever she went. The moment she entered the Tally Office, someone greeted her and immediately took her tally slip. Several lecherous clerks took the opportunity to flirt with some off-color remarks. One even tried to grab her arm while handing back the receipt.

"Looking for trouble! This old lady has a man, you know." Wang Siniang laughed and slapped away the wandering hand. "You haven't given me anything worthwhile, and you want to eat my tofu?"

Laughter erupted inside. One clerk said: "There *is* something worthwhile, Fourth Auntie! The master just sent word—you don't have to work tonight. After dinner, go to the inner residence to see him. He has instructions."

Wang Siniang started. For no apparent reason, why was she being summoned to the inner residence at night? Before she could gather her wits, all manner of teasing comments came flooding toward her.

"Fourth Auntie, with your beauty, perhaps the master has taken a liking to you."

"Indeed, Fourth Auntie, you're like a fresh flower..."

"Your mama's the flower beauty!" Wang Siniang cursed back a few times, carefully tucking the receipt from the counter into a small leather-bound "record book" she carried.

Since she didn't have to work tonight, she hurried outside, found another woman from her team, gave her a few instructions, and rushed home.

Their whole family belonged to the "outer yard"—servants engaged exclusively in production and operations who weren't permitted to enter the inner residence. Thus, they didn't enjoy the privilege of free meals from the communal kitchen that inner-yard servants received; they had to cook for themselves.

Outer-yard servants were provided one or two meals by the estate depending on their shift times. Those working past two in the afternoon were entitled to an afternoon snack to prevent hunger from affecting work efficiency.

When not on shift, they were entirely responsible for their own meals. Because of the long working hours, estate servants often bought ready-made food directly on the Management Office commercial street. Besides the slightly upscale Cooperative tavern, the street also had a food stall—not a restaurant with seating, just a place selling ready-made dishes—essentially a boxed-meal shop.

Walking inside, the floor and walls were all tiled, gleaming brightly under the newly lit gas lamps. Display cases with glass covers were lined with lacquered platters holding various prepared dishes. Most were vegetable dishes and "small meat" items—like minced pork vermicelli casserole, steamed fish, and the like. These were served with soup, rice, mixed-grain congee, noodles, steamed buns, and various pickles.

Customers could take the food home to reheat or eat directly—very convenient. And the food was clean and well-prepared, so the place was quite popular and did brisk business. Wang Siniang's family was large, and with both husband and wife working, cooking at home was impossible. So every day she bought prepared meals here to feed the whole family.

Regular customers could borrow tin meal boxes for free—tin was easy to work with, easy to clean, and being a base metal, was commonly used for tableware in ancient societies, from palaces down to small taverns.

Wang Siniang bought some vegetables and some braised snails—the cheapest of the "small meat" items. In the platter next to it, scallion-roasted crucian carp were piled high, each palm-sized, fragrant and tempting. Wang Siniang hesitated, then bought three. Her family had many mouths to feed; just filling stomachs ate up a major portion of their monthly income. She had to be frugal. Fortunately, households with children under sixteen got a twenty-percent discount on meat dishes.

The master was quite caring toward "little ones." Families with children received four *jin* of rice free per child each month. School children also got a free meal at the charity school—rice in unlimited quantities, with dishes of both meat and vegetables.

As the saying went, "A half-grown son eats his father to death." Though Wang Siniang's children were all girls, they were at that hungry age. With these benefits, the household budget wasn't quite so tight.

Hangzhou was a land of fish and rice; aquatic products like fish, shrimp, and snails were still affordable. Meat, however, was expensive. Any "small meat" dish with actual meat was pricey. As for "large meat" items, very few could afford those.

She hurried home with the food. Her three daughters had already returned from school and were gathered around the square table doing homework. Though Wang Siniang was illiterate, she had seen clerks and scholars write with brushes held vertically. Yet her daughters used wooden charcoal pencils, writing at an angle. She didn't understand the difference, but the fact that her daughters could now read and write was enough to make her happy. How many landlords' and grain merchants' daughters were still illiterate?

Her eldest daughter was already fifteen and had grown considerably—a development that rather displeased Wang Siniang. The girl was now as tall as her. If this continued, she wouldn't be able to wear her mother's old clothes and would need new ones made. Though older sister's hand-me-downs could go to the younger ones, the two little ones were growing just as fast.

"Every one of them acts like they've eaten baking powder," Wang Siniang often muttered lately. She didn't realize that over these past two years, their animal protein intake had far exceeded what it had been, causing them to develop much better than average.

A fifteen-year-old girl should be getting ready for marriage in the old days. Once married, the household burden would lighten somewhat. But now that they were bondservants, the children's marriages required the master's word and approval. She had once tentatively asked Steward Cai about it, but he had told her not to think about it.

"The master doesn't like the girls in the household marrying young. Put this matter on hold for now."

Why didn't he like girls marrying young? Fifteen wasn't that young. Wang Siniang reasoned that perhaps the master wanted to select a few girls to serve at his side? So she had tentatively asked whether the inner residence needed to select maids for service. Again she came up empty. Steward Cai said the inner residence currently had no female relatives; the master didn't need many maids to attend him. The girls should just continue studying at the charity school.

Wang Siniang wouldn't give up. She probed several more times, even hinting that if her eldest daughter could be placed in the inner residence, she would surely express her gratitude. But Steward Cai, since becoming steward, had become impervious to such approaches. He didn't give her a single useful word. He only said, "Let the children study well." Pressed further, he added only: "Those who study well will surely benefit in the future."

What benefit could come from a girl studying well? Wang Siniang didn't understand at all. But watching her eldest grow day by day, she couldn't help worrying—she herself had already been Shen's bride at fifteen! If this kept dragging on, what would become of the girl?

Though she thought this, she kept such words to herself most of the time.

"Eldest! Clear off the table. We're eating soon. Second, come help me light the stove. Third, go play somewhere. Don't get in the way!"

As she spoke to her daughters, Wang Siniang placed the food on the stove to reheat. The stove burned firewood from mountain pruning, allocated monthly by the Management Office to each household on a per-person basis. While she was tending the fire, her husband Shen Da returned.

He had spent the whole day working in the mulberry orchards on the mountain, his feet caked with yellow mud. He scooped water from the vat by the door, washed his feet clean, changed into house slippers, and came inside.

Seeing his wife had come home early, Shen Da showed no surprise—he had already heard at the Tally Office.

Shen Da wore a dark expression, and Wang Siniang and the children didn't dare provoke him. The family ate dinner in silence around the table. Only after the daughters began cleaning up the dishes did Shen Da speak, saying that the master had inspected the mulberry orchards today and wanted to double the orchard area.

He lit the water pipe the master had previously gifted him and drew on it with bubbling sounds: "...Not just expanding the area—apparently they're bringing in someone to teach us how to plant mulberry. Dense planting, they call it. Our family has been planting mulberry and harvesting leaves since Grandfather's generation—and now we need someone to teach us? Really!"

"They'll be from Guangdong again, I suppose." Wang Siniang brewed a cup of tea dust for the head of household—this was the sweepings from the tea storage crates cleared out in early spring, sold cheaply to the estate's servants as a kind of benefit. Though unattractive, it actually contained quite a lot of fine tea leaves.

"Probably. The new mulberry trees this time, same as last year, were saplings unloaded from ships. I don't see anything special about them. No matter how good Guangdong mulberry is, it can't compare to our local Lake mulberry. I don't know why the master likes it so much."

"Fellow countrymen and old friends—there's always some personal connection," said Wang Siniang, well-versed in social niceties and shrewder than her husband. "Look at this estate. Besides Steward Cai, everyone of any importance around the master was brought from Guangdong."

"True enough." Shen Da blew a smoke ring. "Watching people arrive from Guangdong by ship, wave after wave, to work at the estate—it's very strange. It's as if the master doesn't trust the craftsmen here. For anything significant, he has to bring people over from Guangdong."

A ship had docked at the pier below the mountain yesterday—the person coming to guide mulberry planting must have arrived. Wang Siniang suddenly realized that tonight's summons to the inner residence might be related to this matter. But she didn't know how to plant mulberry; she only knew silkworm-rearing. Could they really be starting sericulture this year?

As she was speculating, Shen Da's expression turned hesitant. He took several drags on his pipe before speaking: "I heard the master is summoning you to the inner residence tonight for questioning?"

His expression wasn't pleasant. Wang Siniang understood perfectly. Being suddenly called to the inner residence for no apparent reason—and at night, no less. She was reasonably attractive; any man would have to think it over.

She said: "Yes, I've been summoned." She hastened to add: "I think the master is going to raise silkworms this year. He probably wants to ask about the details. When we first joined the household, he asked a lot of questions about sericulture and silk-reeling."

"How is that possible? There are scattered mulberry trees up on the mountain, sure, but the proper orchards were only planted last year. We can't harvest leaves this year. Without mulberry leaves, how do you raise silkworms?" Shen Da's expression was skeptical.

Without their own mulberry orchards, they would have to buy leaves to raise silkworms—a very risky proposition for sericulturists. Especially after the silkworms reached their third instar, they consumed enormous quantities of leaves every day. Market leaves weren't just expensive; supply was tight. If they couldn't secure leaves, they'd have to abandon the silkworms—all that hard work for nothing. So sericulture households always maintained at least some orchard of their own as a base, supplementing as needed from the market.

With Phoenix Mountain Estate's situation—relying on scattered wild mulberry trees on the mountain—there was no way to achieve sericulture at scale. That she was suddenly being summoned to the inner residence... explaining it by sericulture was hard for him to believe.

"Hard to say. I think our master is someone who can do things ordinary people can't." Wang Siniang said, "Mark my words—there will definitely be sericulture this year."

Seeing her husband's expression still uneasy, she hastened to add: "We've been part of this household for nearly two years now. Everyone can see what kind of person the master is. Even if something were to happen, I can handle it! Don't worry."

Shen Da let out a heavy breath, as if wanting to say something. His lips moved, but in the end, he said nothing.
