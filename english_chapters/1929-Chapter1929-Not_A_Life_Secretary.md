## Chapter 1929 - Not A Life Secretary

During a casual chat, Dr. Zhong said that USB ports had no technical content and could completely be produced locally. Feng Nuo dismantled several damaged ports and felt Dr. Zhong was right. Almost all damage was due to frequent use causing wear and oxidation of the copper electrodes and mechanical destruction of the plastic tongue. Damage to chips and cables was rare. As for the port itself, perhaps they could try manufacturing it themselves, using wood or something similar as insulation material.

But Feng Nuo wasn't confident whether such an "austerity" version of a USB port would actually work. Some work still required professional help.

He drew a so-called "design blueprint" of his own on paper. Feng Nuo hadn't actually studied related design, so this so-called blueprint was drawn based on the USB port he had disassembled, pondering what materials and processing methods should be used to obtain these parts.

Near noon, Feng Nuo's student, Feng Shan, walked into the room, carrying two lunches in her hand.

When the first two batches of life secretaries were distributed, Feng Nuo, who had high requirements for looks, went to draw lots for an A-class maid but unfortunately never won one. Later, when he was called to substitute a class at Fangcaodi, he took a fancy to a little girl in the class—Feng Shan.

In class, Feng Nuo assigned an expository essay, asking students to freely write an expository text based on the curriculum content they learned in school. Yes, Feng Nuo was actually substituting for a Chinese class. Given his professional background, substituting for Chinese was the most realistic option. However, he found this girl's Chinese was really not that good. Seeing the title "The Chicken and Rabbit in the Same Cage Problem," he frowned. This was a top student in the "fast track group." Feng Nuo felt very strange, but upon closer reading, he found the content written by the little girl was actually quite good—the problem was explained clearly, and the solution method was standard.

He couldn't help but look at the girl a few more times. Though she had a thin frame and a somewhat pale face, her features were delicate, her eyes lively, and her smile gentle. The phrase "Her artful smile is captivating, her beautiful eyes look with longing" rose in Feng Nuo's mind, and he felt some strange switch flip in his heart.

A few days later, Feng Nuo seemingly casually mentioned this girl to Yuan Ziguang and learned that her math grades were extremely striking. She had not only completed most of the junior high school math content from the old timeline but could also teach the entire curriculum to the regular senior elementary classes. Although Yuan Ziguang didn't show anything unusual when mentioning this girl, Feng Nuo sharply smelled a scent similar to his own from his expression and tone.

The little girl looked about eleven or twelve at the time, but Feng Nuo knew that girls in the new timeline had poor nutrition, so he estimated she should be about 15. He decided to act quickly to avoid being beaten to the punch. Initially, Feng Nuo planned to take the roundabout route of "sponsorship" to get close, but later thinking of President Wen's teachings, he steeled his heart and brazenly went to cozy up to her. It didn't take much effort to trick the little girl into secretly giving her heart to him: how many girls at Fangcaodi could resist an Elder's goodwill?

But Feng Nuo was soon dumbfounded. He checked the student register at Fangcaodi and found this girl really was only 12! She was a refugee bought from human traffickers in Guangzhou in the first two batches and was also one of the earliest students of the National School. Perhaps due to good nutrition at Fangcaodi in the first two years, she had grown relatively large.

...Not good. Feng Nuo felt very uneasy. He had taken a fancy to a 12-year-old girl. If this news got out, he would become a "shameless beast," "subhuman worse than dogs and pigs." Although many Elders harbored "Hikaru Genji" ideas, he hadn't heard of anyone daring to do it openly.

The key was that the General Office would never approve transferring this little girl to be a life secretary, not even to the Maid School.

After thinking it over, Feng Nuo had to brace himself and discuss this matter with Hu Qingbai. Old Hu was popular and presumably had some connections; maybe there were even "case studies" or secrets for reference.

After listening to him hesitantly explain the whole story, Hu Qingbai grinned and said, "Your guess isn't wrong. I do know... precedents of a few National School female students transferring to the Maid School. But you really are... setting a new low."

Feng Nuo nodded like a chicken pecking rice, squeezing out a few awkward smiles, looking all ears. But Hu Qingbai didn't reveal more details about the "precedents," only saying, "The age is indeed a bit young, but that's not a huge problem. The Maid School has girls her age. But according to the rules, the allocation standard for life secretaries is at least 16 full years of age. Even if she transfers, you'd have to wait four years before allocation."

"I'm not in a hurry for that..." Feng Nuo quickly cleared himself.

"There's another point. She's currently a student in the fast track group. Originally, female students at Fangcaodi aren't allowed to flow into the Maid School, let alone elites from the fast track group—the few precedents were older students with relatively poor grades. Even then, they had to transfer to the vocational training department first and become administrative trainees..."

Seeing him speaking in circles without giving a straight answer, Feng Nuo felt a bit impatient inside, but since this matter wasn't very glorious to speak of, he had to endure and listen to him finish.

"I think you should just register directly with the General Office, but don't transfer her to the Maid School. First, that violates the system; second, it's a waste of talent—" He sighed again, "This girl is a math whiz and was originally on a full scholarship." There was a hint of regret in his voice. " Given her grades and learning ability, going to high school won't be a problem. Maybe later she'll be one of our first college students..."

Feng Nuo hurriedly guaranteed that it would absolutely not affect the girl's studies. She didn't need to go to the Maid School, didn't need to perform maid duties, and could continue living in the dorms and eating in the cafeteria, everything the same as before. But he needed a guarantee that this girl wouldn't be "snatched away" by other Elders.

"...Don't mention college student; even graduate student is no problem," Feng Nuo patted his chest and guaranteed. "I absolutely won't delay her future because of my own preferences."

"You, ah, are too impatient." Hu Qingbai smiled. "Alright. How about this: You go register at the General Office first: you will cover her tuition—to go a step further, just take her as your student—after all, you are in a technical profession, efficient and legal. At the same time, declare that you guarantee this girl's studies at Fangcaodi and future work won't be affected."

Feng Nuo nodded in agreement.

"We will also issue a situational explanation here, verifying that the girl..." He paused, weighing his words, "...is willing."

The General Office didn't make things difficult for Feng Nuo, and the matter was settled. The girl's other life was almost unaffected, except her name was changed by Feng Nuo to "Feng Shan." She continued attending school at Fangcaodi. When she had no classes, Feng Shan would come to the Computing Center to help clean and inspect equipment, learning computer and network knowledge. However, Feng Nuo could see she had no interest in hardware but was interested in some mathematical theories related to computer applications. For this reason, Feng Nuo started giving her private lessons, sporadically lecturing on some knowledge of higher mathematics.

She was now 16 years old. Not only had she entered middle school, but she also undertook some math teaching tasks for senior elementary classes and even began participating in the planning of the Senate's math education system—although it was basically copying the math education of the old timeline, students' acceptance capacity had to be considered, and Feng Shan served as an upper limit value. Combined with her part-time job at the Computing Center, she was very busy—at least busier than Feng Nuo.

In situations like today, Feng Nuo would have her bring food back from the Fangcaodi cafeteria for the two of them to eat.

"Teacher, time to eat."

Hearing Feng Shan call him Teacher, Feng Nuo always felt a sense of guilt. After all, teacher-student romance carried the color of forbidden love. But if she changed to a formal "Chief," it sounded really distant to him.

Feng Shan laid out the lunch boxes on the table—having lived a collective life at Fangcaodi for a long time, Feng Shan naturally couldn't cook, nor was she as "understanding" and "considerate" as the students of the Maid School. Although she roughly knew what would happen to her in the future, she still held a respectful distance of a student towards Feng Nuo, which made Feng Nuo somewhat unhappy.

What the two discussed at the dinner table was almost entirely academic problems. Growing up in Fangcaodi, Feng Shan had no entertainment activities and no hobbies to speak of; the only thing she could talk to Feng Nuo about was her studies. Such table conversations either ended with a heated discussion of a math problem or concluded with an awkward silence having nothing to say.

This girl is really not cute... Feng Nuo secretly complained in his heart.

After lunch, Feng Shan went to the General Affairs Office of the General Manufacturing Plant to collect replacement desiccant, while Feng Nuo began his routine inspection of equipment operation.

After Xu Laowu became the director of the Data Center a few years ago, he put great effort into infrastructure, which greatly reduced Feng Nuo's maintenance workload. Originally, every summer and typhoon season was a time of fear and trembling for Feng Nuo: high temperatures, heavy rain, and typhoons worsened the situation for the data center housed in containers and elevated factory buildings. Every year before summer, he had to spend great effort on various protective constructions.

This month the Computing Center was in a shutdown state, while the Data Center was running. No major inspection was needed today; Feng Nuo just checked the health status indicator lights of every hard drive on the cabinets one by one, and that was it. Yesterday he had just replaced a hard drive whose indicator light had turned yellow. Although post-detection showed it could still be used in a pinch, Feng Nuo sincerely hoped there wouldn't be any more problems today—the spare hard drives in his hand were left over from canceling a RAID group, and there weren't many left.

For the yellow-light hard drive, he routinely ran a disk detection program to check the damage. Generally, hard drive problems were bad sectors, so he would have to shield the bad sectors or perform a low-level format based on the damage to extend the hard drive's lifespan as much as possible.
