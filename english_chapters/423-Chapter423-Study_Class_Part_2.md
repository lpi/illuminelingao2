# Chapter 423 Study Class (Part 2)

Those who wanted to keep their ships could continue to command the fleet. They would join the newly formed joint-venture franchise company under the Foreign Business Committee—the Southeast Asian Company—specializing in overseas trade. The leaders would contribute their ships as shares. Each 100-ton ship counted as one share. Ships over 100 tons were calculated proportionally. Ships under 100 tons were not accepted.

Ships joining the Southeast Asian Company, in addition to conducting overseas trading activities, would also have to complete transportation, combat, and patrol tasks assigned by the Naval Department—the Southeast Asian Company was under the dual leadership of the Foreign Business Committee and the Naval Department. However, in terms of rank, the company's management could participate in the expanded meetings of the Executive Committee.

After this policy was announced, everyone found it acceptable. Although after supplementing personnel and unifying logistics, their private control over the fleet had been greatly reduced, being able to maintain control of the fleet still made many people feel more comfortable psychologically.

Most people chose to join the Southeast Asian Company. Since they would be going into the open sea, small vessels were useless, so they might as well hand them all over and exchange them for some silver. Shi Shisi was different from the others. He firmly demanded to hand over all his ships to the organization and didn't want a single cent. He only asked to be a minor official like a "Qianzong" in the Naval Department. Wei Aiwen found this strange—why did this pirate leader suddenly become so enlightened? Could he really think that we could march to Beijing and let him become a founding hero?

Lin Dan also handed over his ships without hesitation. He likewise didn't want silver, but had a condition: the Crossing Group must do its best to help him find his family's whereabouts.

"However much silver is due, that's how much we'll give. That's credibility." Wei Aiwen said. "As for finding your family, we will do our utmost—aren't we one family now?"

Fatty Hu simply and straightforwardly handed over all five of his ships. He requested not to go to sea anymore—he wanted to run a farm.

"Before I became a pirate, I was good at farming. If those damn Yang Six and Yang Seven hadn't burned down my manor, I wouldn't have done this business."

"If you hadn't done this business, you might have lost everything a long time ago." Lin Dan said. "A country bumpkin rich man like you is just a piece of fat meat."

After a round of registration and allocation, five of the eleven leaders who brought ships, big or small, were willing to hand over all their ships. Among them, Hu Wumei—also known as Fatty Hu, whose elders gave him such a feminine name because having descendants was difficult—indicated that he was unwilling to continue eating this bowl of rice on the sea and wanted to take the silver and buy some land and houses to settle down.

"You don't need to buy land and houses. The house is assigned to you by us. How about this: you work as a farm supervisor for us." Wu De, who was on the side, nodded. "There's a school endowment manor outside the county town. There are several hundred *mu* of land there that need a manager. You can take your wife, children, and relatives to live there. You can also bring a few of your personal soldiers with you."

"Alright, managing a farm is my old trade." Hu Wumei was fairly satisfied with this arrangement. "I also want to buy some land. Is that okay?"

Wu De nodded: "Of course, but we have policies for buying land. You'll have to wait a bit—anyway, silver in your pocket is still silver, it won't lose value!"

"Good, good." Hu Wumei was very satisfied with this arrangement.

Shi Shisi, Lin Dan, Li Guangfa, and others were willing to directly join the Australian Group's "Navy."

The other six people joined the Southeast Asian Company. They also handed over some small ships, keeping only the large ones. On average, each person still had three to five large ships.

Yan Ming brought people from the Delong Grain Shop to handle the ship purchase on-site. The units of measurement for ancient Chinese ships were rather complicated: some used materials, some calculated by size, and some calculated by tonnage. The price Yan Ming calculated used the shipbuilding prices of various sizes of ships along the Guangdong and Fujian coasts collected by the Guangzhou Station as the basic reference point, then assessed the ships' materials, condition, and accessories for pricing. Overall, the prices were generous. Actually, these ships had been adrift at sea for two or three years without repairs and were generally in poor condition.

The prices were all paid in silver, handed in full to the leaders. This was also a way to build trust with them. Yan Ming estimated that, judging by the current consumption situation in Lingao, these people would soon become tired of the inconvenient-to-use silver.

After the formalities were completed, each leader designated a few trusted subordinates to handle the ship transfer procedures. After the Planning Commission personnel opened the seals, the cannons, ammunition, grain, materials, and personal luggage on each ship were all moved down one by one. Personal items were generally returned to each person after disinfection. As for the cannons, grain, weapons, and other items, they were all registered and turned over to the public by the Planning Commission. Regardless of whether these ships were purchased or not, the shipyard would conduct comprehensive repairs and modifications to all of them so they could carry out missions in the autumn.

After the arrangements were made, a two-month leave was announced for everyone to settle their families and handle private affairs. Subsequently, the doctors from the Health Department also conducted physical examinations for the leaders and their families—several people were immediately sent to the STD clinic. The remaining people, after going through the "purification" process, received the keys to their respective homes.

This batch of residences specially for the pirate leaders was located in the upscale residential area of the Bopu Commune. This was the first batch of pilot high-end residential areas constructed. Each row had twelve row houses, with a total of three rows built. Except for Hu Wumei, who went to the farm, and Lin Dan, all the other nine households moved in. Lin Dan, being alone, felt it was lonely to live in such a big house by himself and requested to live in the Navy barracks. Chen Haiyang assigned him an officer's dormitory at the Bopu Naval Base.

The interior decoration, furniture, furnishings, and daily necessities were all complete. Wu De instructed that it should embody the four major standards of "tidy, clean, comfortable, and respectable." Flowers and trees were also planted in the front and back yards, making the pirate families, who were used to the cramped environment at sea, feel very comfortable and pleasant. And the faucet that automatically produced water with just a push of the lever caused a sensation.

The Crossing Group also arranged a gatekeeper for each household, basically old men, who watched the gate, cleaned, and handled receiving visitors. Wearing brand-new blue clothes and sitting at the gate, they looked quite impressive. In reality, they were all part-time informants receiving stipends from the General Administration of Political Security.

When the families moved, Dingding, the head of Publicity, as usual, called the band to play music while setting off firecrackers, striving to create a festive atmosphere. Then, congratulatory gifts for the housewarming were sent in the names of Wei Aiwen, Chen Haiyang, Wu De, and Lin Baiguang respectively. Finally, gifts were presented in the name of the Executive Committee.

The leaders, for the moment, couldn't figure out the system of the Australians. Some thought this "Executive Committee" was probably the name of the Australian Emperor. Others, who were a bit more literate, knew it was the name of an institution like the "Cabinet." Regardless, it was a rare favor. So when the gifts arrived, everyone still knelt down and kowtowed to express gratitude, then respectfully placed the gifts in the center of the main hall. This made Wei Aiwen, who came to congratulate them, not know whether to laugh or cry.

The gifts sent were all very simple, no gold, silver, jewelry, antiques, or calligraphy and paintings, just daily necessities: firewood, rice, oil, salt, cloth, silk, and the like. Although not valuable, for newcomers who had just arrived and didn't even know where to buy things, it was a very thoughtful gesture.

Finally, the cafeteria sent a housewarming banquet. Wei Aiwen, Chen Haiyang, and others personally accompanied them, and the atmosphere was very warm. The various preferential treatments given after landing made everyone very grateful.

Then there were "study sessions" held every few days. The study content was nothing more than watching movies and attending classes, plus the "tours" that the Communist Party had used repeatedly when conducting "thought reform." The only regret was that the Crossing Group didn't have that many industrial and mining enterprises for them to see, and most of these enterprises were rather modest in scale. However, the semi-modern production capacity demonstrated by even the limited few factories was enough to shock people from the medieval era.

Wei Aiwen assigned each leader a student from the Political Department training class. Nominally, they served as translators so they could understand the content of the lectures. In essence, they conducted one-on-one infiltration-style propaganda.

They also observed the Army and Navy drills, artillery target practice, and infantry formation exercises. But apart from the powerful force when the artillery fired, these things didn't make as deep an impression on them as the factories did. They were purely watching for fun—most leaders knew very little about military affairs. Even their naval tactics were unremarkable, basically following the flags to charge, using cannons at long range, firing fire rockets at close range, and finally boarding for melee combat.

Besides tours and movies, there were also lectures. Although most of them were illiterate, literacy campaigns were not conducted at this stage—these people were all accustomed to being unrestrained and didn't understand the importance of knowledge enough. It wouldn't work to have them sit properly like students in a class. So the lectures were in the form of symposiums, focused on ideological indoctrination. Besides Wei Aiwen himself, Lin Baiguang, Wu De, Chen Haiyang, and others took turns coming. The symposiums were generally held in the pavilions of the farms, with tea, snacks, and fruits. Eating and drinking, then chatting. In such chats, the Crossing Group's viewpoints were slowly instilled, and from time to time, questions were answered, from popular science topics like why iron ships can float on water to whether the "Australians" were going to rebel and seize the world—regarding the question of whether they were going to rebel, Wei Aiwen always smiled mysteriously and didn't answer.

This kind of equal and trusting conversation method gave the leaders a very good impression—almost all of them came from poor backgrounds and were used to the brutality of the government. Although there was some "democratic" atmosphere in the pirate group, under the family-style management system, as outsiders with different surnames, they could only keep their complaints about the various injustices within the group in their hearts. Now, with everyone talking openly and speaking freely, there was a feeling of exhilaration. Many couldn't help but vent their dissatisfaction with Zhu Cailao. Wei Aiwen listened and nodded, thinking that at the Quarantine Camp, the sailors were probably also venting their dissatisfaction with this group of people.
