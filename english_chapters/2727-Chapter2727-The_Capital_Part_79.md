# Chapter 2727: The Capital (Part 79)

"How generous was he normally?"

"He was quite generous at first. Altogether, he spent two thousand strings of cash at my madam's place." Ruijie seemed somewhat proud. "Then when he wanted to take me as his mistress, he spent another thousand-plus strings." She sighed. "But after that, he became stingy! The monthly allowance was only six taels. And he counted every household expense to the last fen! It was hard to keep even a spare bit of silver."

Min Zhanlian laughed inwardly, thinking: Once she was in hand, why would he be generous? He asked again, "For a fortune-teller, isn't it strange he had so much money?"

"Listen to you, sir." Ruijie, seeing his gentle words and handsome face, grew a bit bolder. With a coy smile, she said, "In our musician's household, as long as it's real gold and silver, who cares whether it came by strangely or not."

Min Zhanlian asked more about Liu Sha's usual activities. Ruijie didn't know much—only that he came to Tongzhou once or twice a month, staying three or four days each time. This time, he'd just stayed a bit longer.

As for the people he usually met, they were a mix of officials and "people on the circuit." Given his profession and activities, that wasn't surprising. However, their conversations were very secretive, mostly in the study in the front courtyard. He never talked business in front of her.

"That old thing acts all mysterious all day long, speaking in hushed tones," Ruijie said indignantly.

Min Zhanlian focused his questioning on the previous day's murder. But Ruijie didn't know much. She only knew the visitor came at dusk. The two talked in the study for a while, then somehow moved to the back courtyard. She was told to wait in the west wing. Later, she heard a commotion in the main building. When she rushed over, the visitor was already dead, and Liu Sha was wounded.

Ruijie was scared out of her wits, but Liu Sha remained calm. He first had her help him to the side room to bandage his wounds, then took out silver to reward everyone and had them clean up the traces and hide the body.

With a murder case on their hands, even though Liu Sha was the killer, if it went to court, the cohabitating servants and Ruijie couldn't escape either. Losing money was one thing, but just enduring the repeated court torture was terrifying. If they encountered a brutal official, they might all be prosecuted as accomplices and exiled to the frontier. Since they were all in the same boat and Liu Sha was offering silver, the three had no objections.

But the blood splattered on the walls couldn't be washed off. So they had Ruijie go out to buy lime to paint the walls while also preventing the corpse from rotting and smelling. Once Liu Sha's wounds recovered a bit, they would bury the body.

"Did the visitor bring any items? Like letters or documents?"

"He only carried a travel bag. I opened it for the master—inside were just a change of clothes and some scattered silver and copper coins. He did have a document case on him, but the master ordered it thrown into the brazier and burned."

"What about his belongings?"

"All burned. Nothing left."

Min Zhanlian felt a twinge of disappointment, but on second thought, since this person was surnamed Wang, he should be someone from Wang Yehao's household.

Just then, Little Five came to report: The study had been searched, but nothing important was found.

"Just ordinary correspondence and fortune-telling books and such. We're sorting and packing them. Would the squad leader like to take a look?"

"In a moment." Min Zhanlian had just spoken when Ruijie suddenly said, "Master! This slave has some news. But after telling you, might this slave receive a little reward?"

"Oh? What news?" Min Zhanlian was intrigued.

"The east wing in this courtyard—normally we're not allowed to enter. It's locked up tight. But once, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw him with a lamp on in the east wing. Could there be some secret there?"

They had already opened the east wing earlier. Three rooms: one main, two inner—the south room was a heated sleeping alcove, the north room a small study. Nothing special. Since there were almost no signs of use and the door was still locked, they'd assumed it was used as a guest room. So the team members hadn't searched it as a priority.

Now that Ruijie mentioned it, it piqued his interest. He said, "That's useful news. Whether we find anything or not, you'll get your reward. Think some more—if there's anything else about this old thing, come tell me."

So the squad specifically searched the east wing again. This time, they really did find quite a lot. The usual hiding spots under the bed and in the ceiling were empty, and there were no false walls, but the furniture had been tampered with. The bed, desk, and cabinets all had secret compartments hiding money and documents.

"Squad Leader, look at this. The old fox trusts Delong quite a bit." A team member handed him a stack of Delong banknotes found in the search. Min Zhanlian flipped through them. A rough estimate put them at two or three thousand taels—mostly bearer notes in fixed denominations issued by Delong: ten taels, fifty taels, and one hundred taels. They could be exchanged for silver at Delong or corresponding affiliate exchange houses. Most convenient for gifts and bribes. Huge quantities had been issued in the capital.

The silver wasn't unusual, but in one secret compartment, they found a set of five books in a case. All written on fine cotton paper in small, neat calligraphy—dense but clear characters. The title was *Overview of Australia*.

This wasn't unusual in itself. Ever since the Australians reached the walls of Guangzhou, there had been *Record of Short-Hair Affairs*. As the Senate's power grew and its fame in the Great Ming increased, literati became increasingly interested in this new "barbarian." The Short-Hairs were different from the Eastern Barbarians or Mongols—who mostly affected only the frontier. The Short-Hairs had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of society. Besides the massive influx of "Australian goods," there were also "Australian pictures," "Australian illustrated magazines," and "Australian story books"… Despite repeated bans by the authorities, they couldn't stop the widespread circulation, especially the story books being printed and sold in large numbers. Among the common folk, Short-Hairs, Short-Hair affairs, and Short-Hair goods were popular topics of conversation. Thus, various notebooks focusing on the "Short-Hairs" had proliferated—some written by those who had been to Lingao; some compiled from hearsay and rumors; and some wildly fabricated and sensational. Min Zhanlian had seen such books during his studies at the "farm."

It was perfectly normal for Liu Sha to have such a book. Min Zhanlian casually flipped through a few pages, but his expression turned grave.

Little Five asked curiously, "What's wrong? Is there something unusual about this notebook?"

"It's extremely important." Min Zhanlian took a deep breath. "This book needs to be sent to the contact point and forwarded to Guangzhou as soon as possible."

But the most important secret compartment was behind a brick in the corner of the wall. If not for a veteran lone-wolf thief on the team who noticed the brick's edges were somewhat smooth, they might have missed it even after several more searches.

Inside was a bundle of letters. He read a few. None had sender or recipient names—only seals. But from the content, he could roughly guess who the other party was. Several mentioned palace affairs and frequently referred to "adoptive father." These were probably Yang Tianliang's letters.

He immediately sorted out all the letters with the same seal, arranged them by date, and read through them one by one. The earliest letters dated back four or five years. The contents were mostly instructions for tasks Yang Tianliang assigned, as well as replies to Liu Sha's requests for Eunuch Yang's help. It seemed that from that time, Liu Sha and his master Wang Yehao had already been colluding with Eunuch Yang.

But none of this was related to the Leng Ningyun case. It wasn't until two letters from about half a year ago that something caught Min Zhanlian's attention. The first letter said he had, as Liu Sha requested, secured the position of Managing Eunuch at Nanyuan for Eunuch Cao.

"Eunuch Cao" was Cao Sheng of Zhangjiawan's relative. Now the managing eunuch of Nanyuan. Unexpectedly, this managing eunuch position had been arranged through Liu Sha via Little Eunuch Yang! Even stranger, this letter didn't mention money at all! In all previous letters where favors were requested, money was always mentioned. Sometimes there were even complaints that the payment was too little—barely enough to "tribute to the adoptive father," leaving almost nothing for himself.

Had Little Eunuch Yang changed his nature?

Reading further, the correspondence became increasingly frequent. Letters that used to come every few months now came every five or six days. Several urged him to raise funds. From the tone, it seemed he was desperate to curry favor with some important figure and needed to procure a very expensive piece of Australian merchandise. He specifically mentioned that Leng Ningyun was a "miserly wretch" who not only refused to offer it as a tribute but would only give an 80% discount on the price. Thus, he "deserved to die" and "brought it on himself." He also told Liu Sha that "opportunity knocks but once"—this was a perfect chance to "offer flowers to Buddha."

Min Zhanlian thought: This doesn't add up. Three or four months ago, Leng Ningyun was perfectly fine, serving as Delong's chief manager. How could there be talk of "deserved to die" or "brought it on himself"? Could Little Eunuch Yang have foreseen it? And this "opportunity knocks but once"—could that refer to Wang Yehao's plan to kidnap Leng Ningyun?

It seemed Little Eunuch Yang was not only involved in the kidnapping but deeply embedded.

The next letters mentioned that Nanyuan currently housed over ten thousand scattered castrated men, among whom were several capable and strong men of bandit background. But selecting suitable ones would take time. Crucially, there needed to be sufficient money and provisions. Liu Sha was to "find a way to procure them."

Moreover, from these letters, Liu Sha hadn't given an honest confession. He was deeply connected to the eunuchs of Nanyuan. He was likely organizing armed forces among the castrated men of Nanyuan. Liu Xiaobian and the several eunuchs were probably part of this armed group. Going to the scene was probably to assess Heliansheng's strength.

He continued reading. The later letters became sparse in content, using mostly code words and substitute terms. But Min Zhanlian could roughly guess they discussed arrangements after the kidnapping. The letters mentioned how to deal with Wang Yehao. Regarding Liu Sha's worry that Heliansheng's estate in Haidian was too heavily fortified to attack by force, the reply said there were "arrangements in place."

Turning to the next letter, he read a few lines, then suddenly his eyes went wide. He stared intently at the paper, reading it several times. A smile spread across his face as he murmured to himself, "Good, good. Got you now."
