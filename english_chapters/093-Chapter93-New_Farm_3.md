# Chapter 91 - New Farm (1)

"Alright, let's take stock of our assets first." At the first plenary meeting of the Agricultural Committee, Wu Nanhai proposed.

The Agricultural Committee originally had an account book, but after more than fifty days of coming ashore, the numbers and types had changed somewhat, so a revision was needed.

In terms of seeds, they had 100 kg of hybrid rice seeds. This transmigration super weapon was actually not as magical as in legends. It was essentially a "mule" in the plant kingdom, with many advantages but unable to reproduce. Wu Nanhai brought these seeds to achieve a bumper harvest in the first year and stabilize the grain reserve. With grain, there is everything.

Other various rice seeds were 50 kg each type, totaling 1000 kg, including high-yield and lodging-resistant rice seeds adapted to local water and soil such as Guangguichao and Shuanggui, which were widely planted in Lingao in the 1960s and 1970s.

As a high-yield crop to be focused on for future promotion, there were 100 kg of sweet potatoes. Hainan in 1628 should already have sweet potato planting; these were high-quality seed potatoes. 100 kg of potatoes were also brought. The water and soil conditions in Lingao were not very suitable for growing potatoes, but this crop could be used as both vegetables and grain and feed. It would have great prospects when promoted to the mainland in the future. There were also 20 kg of kudzu vines and 20 kg of high-quality alfalfa seeds.

Corn, wheat, and barley seeds were 100 kg each. In addition, there were various beans: soybeans, mung beans, adzuki beans, black beans, etc., 10 kg each.

Vegetable seeds: green peppers, tomatoes, cabbage, green vegetables, carrots, pumpkins, cucumbers, onions, various scallions, garlic, etc., 1 kg each.

Spices could be easily obtained in Southeast Asia through maritime trade at that time, so only red pepper and Sichuan pepper seeds were brought, 10 varieties, totaling 10 kg.

Before boarding the ship, he also bought several large bags of fruit seeds suitable for growth in Hainan, 1 kg per pack, locally.

Finally, he didn't forget the small hobby of tobacco. 10 kg of tobacco seeds would bring him a monopoly position in the future tobacco planting industry. Wu Nanhai had already calculated that once tobacco was grown, he would produce cigarettes himself.

All seeds had formal packaging and should have a shelf life of 2 years. Some varieties were not suitable for local planting and were prepared for regions further north, so vacuum packaging capable of long-term preservation for 7-8 years was selected.

"These are the seeds." Ye Yuming introduced, "There are also some seedlings that need to be transplanted to the nursery as soon as possible."

There were quite a few seedlings brought: 50 coconut seedlings, 50 rubber seedlings, 20 coffee seedlings, 20 cocoa seedlings, 20 coca seedlings, 50 cinchona seedlings, 5 poppy seedlings, as well as some timber trees, fast-growing trees, and fruit tree seedlings, and culture stems of sugarcane and bananas. These plants were very useful to them, but the difficulty of management and planting was not small. Wu Nanhai remembered the teacher of tropical crops major saying in class that the educated youth farms in Yunnan specially cultivated cinchona seedlings back then, and the germination rate was as low as less than 5%. Cinchona seeds were even known to be as expensive as gold. Quinine is a specific medicine for treating malaria. Without this, the transmigrators' colonial plans of going north to Taiwan and south to Southeast Asia would all fail. Therefore, besides seedlings, some seeds were also brought as backup.

In terms of livestock and poultry, there were currently 6 pigs, namely two pairs of Landrace pigs and a pair of Northeast Min pigs. Landrace pigs are lean meat type pigs introduced from Denmark, used as the paternal line for hybridization; Northeast Min pigs are local breeds in the Northeast region, tolerant to coarse feed, high litter size, used as the maternal line for hybridization. Moreover, the fat deposition rate of this pig is particularly high, facilitating the acquisition of animal fat. Now they had 4 more local piglets.

On the Agricultural Committee's horse power list, only a pair of Tieling draft horses were brought. This kind of horse was a relatively scarce draft horse in ancient China. The two racehorses brought by Nick were originally not within their management scope, but after "Blue Lightning" died, the sad Nick also put "A Lan Chi" under the Agricultural Committee for feeding. At first, Wu Nanhai was extremely reluctant because the various care requirements proposed by Nick annoyed him endlessly: feeding five times a day, drinking warm water... until Yang Baogui said this old racehorse still had some value—it was a mare.

"If it were a stallion, it would definitely be gelded when racehorse training started at two or three years old. Now it would be useless." Yang Baogui was relatively satisfied with this horse.

"How old is it?"

"Thirteen or fourteen years old," Yang Baogui flipped through his notebook, "I haven't checked their teeth yet. Horses can live to thirty. This horse is not good for racing anymore, but can make do as a broodmare."

The 3 captured local horses, identified by Yang Baogui, were all Dian horses (Yunnan horses), about seven or eight years old, 2 of which were geldings. These three horses could be used directly for labor.

"It would be best to get some more horses." Wu Nanhai looked at the various small agricultural machinery unloaded in the yard but not yet organized. They had small walking tractors, and also large and medium tractors currently occupied by the engineering department, but in the long run, there must be some draft animals for traction. Before the resources for mechanization run out, enter the era of mules and horses as soon as possible. Not only to meet their own needs, but also to meet the needs of farmers adopting new agricultural methods.

"There are too many places where horses are needed, but this place in Hainan is not suitable for raising horses." Yang Baogui shook his head, "The climate is a bit hot, and the rainy season is too humid. Horses are super delicate."

"How about breeding some mules?" Ye Yuming proposed, "Isn't there a pair of donkeys?"

"Please, I don't plan to go now..."

"?" Ye Yuming looked confused. Even Wu Nanhai, a standard good man who was usually very serious, laughed lewdly:
"Right!" Wu Nanhai recalled the teacher talking about horse mating in the animal husbandry class back then. This course made post-80s girls blush.

"What?" Yang Baogui asked Wu Nanhai with a smile.

"Nothing, I just took this class and watched yellow videos (porn) for horses a few times."

"Put aside the matter of breeding mules for now. The breeding season for horses starts in March. Moreover, this animal is very neurotic. Tossed them too much recently, let them rest well and fatten up first, adapt to the environment."

Besides these big guys, there were also inconspicuous but very useful small animals: 2 pairs of rabbits (one pair for fur and one for meat), 4 roosters of different breeds (half meat chickens and half layer chickens) and 20 hens, 2 pairs of ducks, 2 pairs of turkeys, 10 carrier pigeons—also Nick's private property. Finally, a calico cat brought by an unknown girl, now seemingly forgotten, still wearing a beautiful bow tie on its neck.

Besides these living things, there were also animals in some cellular states: a liquid nitrogen storage tank storing goat, sheep, fine breed beef cattle, and dairy cow [embryos/semen]. This tank was currently still stored in the cold storage on the ship. However, they didn't have liquid nitrogen production technology and must find suitable local maternal lines as soon as possible.

After checking the property, the new farmers from the 21st century leveled the land and built simple poultry sheds. The free-range yard paved with sand was surrounded by dense fences woven with bamboo, planted with loofah, hyacinth bean, and gourd, which could shade chickens and ducks and harvest vegetables at the same time, killing two birds with one stone.

However, these chickens, ducks, and poultry looked obviously sluggish and had low appetite after a long journey. Always disturbing these animals was indeed a problem. Hope the vast world and fresh air here can help them recover as soon as possible. Brothers are still waiting to eat eggs.

Wu Nanhai built grape trellises on the aisle of the yard, planted fruit trees in the open spaces on both sides, opened up a few ridges of garden plots under the trees, and planted various herbs and medicinal materials.

"You are turning the yard upside down!" Huang Dashan walked over pushing his two-wheeled cart. He had just been transferred to the Agricultural Committee through the Human Resources Group. His luggage was on the handcart.

"Hehe, in a while, this place will be fragrant with flowers and fruits." Wu Nanhai looked proudly at those messy frames tied with bamboo poles and ropes. He glanced at the newcomer wearing thick glasses:
"You are?"

"I am Huang Dashan, this is my transfer order." Huang Dashan took out a small piece of paper from his pocket.

"Welcome, welcome!" Wu Nanhai remembered that this person had applied to come to the Agricultural Committee several times. The reason for application was that he was good at cultivating edible fungi and brought many strains and culture media, "Are you engaged in fungi cultivation?"

"No," Huang Dashan smiled harmlessly, "My profession is a biochemical laboratory technician, specializing in live animal bacteria/virus culture. However, cultivating mushroom strains is purely a sideline to subsidize income."

"Then do the sideline as the main business." Wu Nanhai was very satisfied with this new combat power, "Where do you think your mushroom shed is suitable to be set up?"

"Just cultivate under the fruit trees. Under the grape trellis is originally the most suitable place." Huang Dashan looked around, "Plant oyster mushrooms that are easy to survive first. This is easy to plant and has high yield. No need to build a shed. Later when conditions allow, build a few dedicated cultivation sheds. I brought quite a few strains. But give me a room as a laboratory. I brought common equipment for biochemical laboratories." He added another sentence, "Best be a relatively independent house, far away from other organisms..."

"En?" Wu Nanhai didn't understand his meaning, but still nodded.

Yang Baogui was assigned a room as a veterinary clinic, plus a bedroom. He had been tirelessly hiding in his tent, staying in the simple room. The large and small boxes he brought hard all the way finally had a stable place, containing a full set of animal medical equipment and information books. Wu Nanhai prepared to vacate a room specifically for storing brought agricultural books, planting manuals, and various teaching video discs as a dedicated agricultural technology library.
