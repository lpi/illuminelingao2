# Chapter 122: Commercial Planning

East Gate Market's plan started from the outer moat of Bairren Fortress's east gate, extending 300 meters westward—constructing a main street named "East Gate Street." Cross-streets every 100 meters on each side—creating a one-vertical, two-horizontal layout. Plots of varying sizes along the streets could be sold to merchants for self-built shops. Travelers would also construct shop-fronts along East Gate Street for merchant rentals.

"This plan is enormous. Never mind the construction-resource consumption—does Lingao have enough merchants to rent your shop-fronts? You're not expecting vegetable-peddlers to rent, are you?"

"Lingao's economy is minuscule—basically subsistence. Isn't this market exaggerated?" Cheng Dong expressed concern.

Dongmen Chuiyu was confident: "This is long-term planning. We'll start with Phase One."

Phase One included: 100 meters of street with accompanying drainage; a mule-and-horse inn—common along old highways and major markets. Inns had large courtyards for tethering animals and parking carts; warehouses for temporary goods-storage; kitchens with cooking facilities but no meals—guests cooked themselves. Lodging was mainly dormitories, with some private rooms. Common stopovers for small-to-medium traveling merchants.

A restaurant—he added that transmigrators' contact with locals was increasing. They needed an outside dining-and-meeting place. Normally it could also serve wealthy merchants.

Across from the Administration building, a merchant hall would be built. This borrowed from British East India Company trading-posts: a high-walled compound containing trading offices, cargo warehouses and storage-yards, plus guest-rooms, dining-rooms, and meeting-rooms for important merchants.

Originally, running water to East Gate Market was planned—but long-distance water-supply was still difficult. Changed to: dig several wells, one public—free drinking-water for people and animals. Finally: public toilets—locals doing business here defecating everywhere had become very troublesome.

Even landscaping was considered—mind you, Bairren Fortress itself had no landscaping yet. East Gate Street would have tree-lined sidewalks; species to be selected by Agricultural Department. Wu Nanhai immediately said he'd research it.

For security, Dugu Qiuhun saw no concerns. Major structures were brick-and-stone; doors and windows iron-plated. The merchant-hall's wall-corners would each have a watchtower. Even if attacked, breaching would take time—Bairren Fortress's earthwork-wall blockhouses and watchtowers were right there. For petty disturbances like theft, he requested ten sets each of stab-vests, stab-gloves, and batons—forming the "East Gate Market Comprehensive Enforcement Squad" from current staff—"guaranteeing nobody causes trouble here."

"We can provide those." Wen Desi said. "But how do you plan to attract investment?"

"Let me explain the overall strategy—it's big and complex. May I?"

Given permission, Dongmen Chuiyu picked up his file-folder. This commercial plan was mainly developed with Yan Maoda and Zhang Xin. Yan Maoda, a jewelry-company manager, had gone to Guangzhou with Xiao Zishan. Zhang Xin was a small-shipyard's sales-section chief. In commercial ability, Dongmen Chuiyu could only bow in admiration. But those two had no interest in local commerce—didn't bother competing with Dongmen. Cooperation was pleasant.

East Gate Market's current prosperity relied on transmigrators' large-scale procurement. With 500-plus high-consuming modern people, huge purchasing-volume attracted many traders. But market development supported only by bulk institutional-purchasing was limited. How to bring the whole county—even neighboring counties—here to trade and consume? Their first proposal: build roads.

Bairren Fortress's location was ideal—precisely midway between the county seat and Bopu Bay (the gateway port). Centered on the county's most developed, most populated Wenlan River banks—geographically well-connected. The Bairren–Bopu highway was complete; the county-seat extension was under construction. Soon, the county seat and Bopu Port would be fully connected. Mainland merchants could conveniently reach the county seat; river-bank residents could easily access the county.

However, the highway was east-of-river—west-bank residents couldn't enjoy convenient transport. Dongmen Chuiyu proposed: build a footbridge upstream of Bairren Hydroelectric Station—linking north-south traffic. Then nearby commoners wouldn't need to detour via the Wenlan River Bridge at the South Gate.

As long as traffic continuously flowed through Bairren Fortress, East Gate Market—the highway's only market—would become a personnel-and-goods hub. Commerce would naturally flourish.

Wen Desi endorsed the bridge proposal. Now with west-bank industrial-zone operations, transmigrators' own personnel and material transport was inconvenient. Building a bridge benefited both purposes.

Dongmen Chuiyu noted commoners currently didn't dare use the highway—with blockhouses and vehicles running on it. Everyone was intimidated.

"That's easily solved." Wen Desi frowned. "But people here have no traffic-rules concept. Will our vehicles run people over?"

"Unlikely. We have few vehicles—only dispatched for important matters. Currently: fastest are bicycles; largest are four-wheeled wagons. Safety issues are minimal."

Second proposal: attract outside merchants. Commercial Department had clearly learned from Intelligence: Lingao wasn't a good market. Its economic structure wasn't just subsistence—it was particularly backward subsistence. Economic capacity and purchasing-power couldn't compare to Jiangnan or Guangdong—not even average northern densely-populated regions. The standard transmigrator quick-fortune method—mass-selling "clever crafts" modern goods (mirrors, glass cups, lighters)—wouldn't work here. They could only sell to the mainland. Ideally: merchants coming to purchase, not them delivering goods.

Besides future industrial products, Lingao itself had many exportable local specialties. Historical research showed Ming-era major exports: cattle, salt, rattan (red and white), and betel-nut. Rattan and betel-nut mostly came from Li-minority areas—processed locally, then exported to the mainland. Most profitable commodities.

Yet historically, except for salt shipped from Bopu and Ma'ao ports, most exports went to the prefectural capital, shipping from Shenying Port. If exports could shift to Bopu Port, well-connected East Gate Market would become the collection-point for mainland-merchant purchasing.

"We can't control betel-nut trade yet—but we already control salt production. I propose fully monopolizing salt production and sales—making the East Gate Market salt-shop Lingao's salt wholesale-headquarters. Complete control of wholesale. Merchants wanting salt must come to Bairren Fortress." Dongmen Chuiyu's eyes gleamed—monopoly, oh monopoly! How much money comes from you!

Other suggestions: abolish Bopu Port's "water-tax" and berthing-fees to attract coastal trading-ships. Provide good business environments—tax exemptions, warehousing-and-transport services. Dongmen Chuiyu even proposed using the Guangzhou outpost for Hainan–Guangzhou commercial wireless-telegraph service—daily Guangzhou-Macau market-price bulletins.

With these benefits, mainland merchants would naturally shift local-product purchasing and processing centers to Lingao. Accompanying permanent and transient population-inflow would obviously stimulate the economy. When transmigrators eventually produced modern industrial goods, they could use these merchants' channels for mainland sales and material-procurement—avoiding doing everything themselves.

This commercial plan was approved. Construction Engineering Group groaned—their tasks were overwhelming: county-road just completed; Damei Village's nearly 200 relocated households needed housing; Bairren Fortress itself had ongoing projects. Now: East Gate Market development added. Brick kilns and cement kilns ran day-and-night. Labor shortages everywhere. Ma Qianzhu, coordinating everything, was overwhelmed.

He summoned Wu Nanhai, face grim: "Nanhai, your workload is increasing. From now on: prepare 800 additional meals daily—supplying Damei Village migrants. Engineering urgently needs this labor force."

This notification made Wu Nanhai gasp: he'd previously provided at most 700 daily meals. Adding 800 more suddenly—a Great-Leap-style leap. Never mind anything else—even kitchen equipment wasn't sufficient.

"Planning Committee just brought Gou Manor spoils—kitchen and daily-use items. Go pick what you need." Ma Qianzhu, seated behind a huanghuali-wood table, scribbled a note, stamped his personal seal, and handed it over—no official seals yet; documents were validated by Committee-members' and group-leaders' signatures or personal stamps.

"We don't farm—just cooking is overwhelming!" Wu Nanhai exploded—recently, constant cooking-duty left no time for his beloved agriculture.

"Select whoever you need. Pick women from Damei Village migrants to help. Must be reliable—no Gou-family connections whatsoever. Also: locals can't handle our food—keep cooking areas separate. Understand?"

"How would I know who has Gou-family connections?"

"Security is conducting individual vetting. As materials come out batch-by-batch, you select batch-by-batch."
