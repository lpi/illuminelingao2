# Chapter 122 - Commercial Planning

The planning of East Gate Market started from the moat outside the East Gate of Bairen City, extending three hundred meters westward to build a main street—named East Gate Street. A cross street would be built every one hundred meters on both sides of the street, forming a layout of one longitudinal and two transverse streets. Plots of different sizes were demarcated on both sides of the street, which could be sold to merchants to build their own houses. The transmigrators would also build some storefront houses on both sides of East Gate Street for merchants to rent and operate.

"Your plan is so big. Leaving aside how much construction engineering resources it will occupy, are there so many merchants in Lingao to rent your storefront houses? Don't tell me vegetable peddlers will come to rent too?"

"Lingao's economic scale is very small, basically a natural economy. Is this market a bit exaggerated?" Cheng Dong expressed concern.

Dongmen Chuiyu had a well-thought-out plan: "This is a long-term plan. We intend to do the first phase of the project first."

The first phase of the project included building a one-hundred-meter street and supporting sewers, and building a mule and horse inn. This was a common type of inn on ancient official roads and large markets. The inn had a large courtyard for tethering mules and horses and parking vehicles; there was a warehouse where traveling merchants could temporarily store goods; there was a kitchen with convenient water and fire, but no meals were provided, so merchants had to cook for themselves. Accommodation was mainly communal sleeping platforms, with some single rooms. It was a place where small and medium traveling merchants often stayed.

A restaurant—he added that the transmigrators currently had more and more interactions with locals and needed a place outside the city to meet, talk, and eat. Usually, it could also serve wealthy traveling merchants.

Opposite the management office building, a factory (trading station) would be built. The factory borrowed some models from the British East India Company's factories: a building surrounded by high walls, containing trading firms; warehouses and open spaces for storing goods; and guest rooms, dining rooms, and conference rooms for important traveling merchants.

Originally, it was planned to pipe tap water to East Gate Market, but long-distance water supply was still difficult. It was changed to digging several water wells, one of which was a public well providing free drinking water for people and livestock. Finally, public toilets would be built—the problem of locals doing business in East Gate Market defecating and urinating everywhere these days had given everyone a headache.

Even greening issues were considered—knowing that even Bairen City had no greening projects yet. Street trees would be planted on both sides of East Gate Street. As for the tree species, the agricultural department was asked to choose. Wu Nanhai immediately expressed he would study it.

As for safety, Dugu Qiuhun thought there was no need to worry. The main buildings of the market were of brick and stone structure, with doors and windows wrapped in iron sheets. Four towers were also planned to be built at the four corners of the factory wall. Even if someone attacked, they couldn't rush in for a while. The blockhouses and watchtowers on the earthen ramparts of Bairen City were close at hand. As for security issues like small-scale riots and robberies, he applied for the allocation of ten sets each of stab-resistant vests, stab-resistant gloves, and batons, forming the "East Gate Market Comprehensive Management Law Enforcement Team" with existing staff—"Guaranteed not to let anyone be arrogant here," Dugu Qiuhun vowed solemnly.

"These can be given to you." Wen Desi said, "But what method are you going to use to attract investment?"

"I want to talk about the overall idea. It's quite big and complex. How about it?"

After getting everyone's permission, Dongmen Chuiyu picked up the folder on the table. This commercial plan was mainly discussed by him, Yan Maoda, and Zhang Xin. Yan Maoda was a jewelry company manager currently accompanying Xiao Zishan to Guangzhou. Zhang Xin was the sales section chief of a small shipyard. When it came to business ability, Dongmen Chuiyu could only bow down. However, neither of these two aspired to engage in local commerce, so they didn't bother to fight with Dongmen, and the cooperation was quite pleasant.

The current prosperity of East Gate Market was built on the large-scale procurement of the transmigrators. The huge consumption volume of more than five hundred high-consumption modern people attracted many people to do business here. But market development supported only by such large-scale group procurement was limited. How to make people from the whole county, and even neighboring counties, come to this place for business and consumption? The first plan they proposed was: building roads.

The location of Bairen City was ideal. It was exactly in the middle section of the road from the county town to the gateway port of the county, Bopu Bay. It was located in the center of both banks of the Wenlan River, where the county's economy was most developed and population most dense, with accessible geographical location in all directions. Currently, the road from Bairen City to Bopu had been completed, and the road extending to Lingao County Town was also under construction. Before long, the county town and Bopu Port would be fully connected. Not only could merchants from the mainland reach the county town conveniently and quickly, but residents living on both banks of the Wenlan River could also reach the county town conveniently and quickly through this road.

However, the road was located east of the river, and the common people west of the river could hardly enjoy convenient transportation. Dongmen Chuiyu proposed building a temporary bridge upstream of the Bairen Hydropower Station to connect north-south traffic. In this way, nearby common people crossing the river would not need to detour to the Wenshui Bridge in front of the south gate of the county town.

As long as there was a constant flow of people passing through Bairen City, East Gate Market, the only market on the road, would form a distribution center for personnel and materials, and commerce would naturally prosper.

Wen Desi agreed with the proposal to build a bridge. Now that the industrial zone west of the river had started construction, it was very inconvenient for the transmigrators' own personnel and materials to go back and forth. Building a bridge was indeed a good thing killing two birds with one stone.

Dongmen Chuiyu said that common people basically dared not walk on the current road, with blockhouses and cars running. Everyone was relatively afraid.

"This is not a problem, easily solved." Wen Desi frowned, "However, common people in this time and space have no concept of traffic rules. Will our cars hit people running on the road?"

"Won't happen. We only have a few cars, and they don't move unless it's a big matter. Now the fastest on the road are bicycles, and the biggest are four-wheeled horse carriages. Safety is not a big problem."

The second plan was to attract foreign merchants. The commercial department got a very clear message from the Intelligence and Information Group: Lingao was not a good market. Its economic structure was not only a natural economy but a particularly backward natural economy. Needless to say compared with the Jiangnan and Guangdong regions of the Ming Dynasty, the total economic volume and purchasing power were not even at the level of ordinary densely populated areas in the north. Trying to sell large quantities of "ingenious and frivolous skills" modern goods like mirrors, glass cups, and lighters here by relying on the traditional transmigration get-rich-quick method wouldn't work. Things could only be sold to the mainland. The best state was for merchants to come and purchase, rather than transporting and selling by themselves.

Besides future industrial products, Lingao itself also had many local specialties for export. After checking historical data, it was known that the bulk export materials locally in the Ming Dynasty were cattle, table salt, red and white rattan, and betel nuts. Red and white rattan and betel nuts were mostly imported from the Li Dong areas, processed, and then exported to the mainland, being the most profitable goods.

However, for a long time, except for table salt being exported by ship from Bopu and Maniao in the county, most exported goods were transported to the prefectural city and exported from Shenying Port. If export goods could be changed to export from Bopu, East Gate Market with superior transportation conditions would become a distribution center for mainland merchants to sit and acquire local products.

"We can't control the betel nut trade now, but we have controlled the production of table salt. I suggest completely controlling the production and sales of salt, making the salt shop in East Gate Market the general wholesale store for Lingao table salt. Completely control the wholesale link of table salt. Merchants must come to Bairen City to buy salt." Dongmen Chuiyu's eyes shone as he spoke—monopoly, oh monopoly, how much money comes from you!

Other suggestions included exempting Bopu Port from "extraction" (bribes/fees) and berthing taxes to attract coastal trading merchant ships to enter the port. Providing a good business environment, such as tax exemption, warehousing and freight services. Dongmen Chuiyu even proposed utilizing the stronghold in Guangzhou to launch Hainan-Guangzhou commercial wireless telegraph services, reporting Guangzhou and Macau market conditions daily.

With these benefits, merchants from the mainland would naturally move the acquisition and processing centers of local products to Lingao. Following this would be the inflow of many permanent and migrant populations, and the stimulating effect on the economy would be obvious. In the future, after the transmigrators produced modern industrial products themselves, they could use their channels to sell goods and purchase materials from the mainland, avoiding having to do everything themselves.

This set of commercial plans was approved. The architectural engineering group complained incessantly. Their tasks were heavy: the road to the county town was just completed; nearly two hundred households moved from Damei Village needed resettlement housing; Bairen City itself still had many projects underway. Now there was an additional East Gate Market development project. Brick kilns and cement kilns operated day and night. Labor was lacking everywhere. Ma Qianzhu, responsible for central coordination, was overwhelmed.

At this moment, he called Wu Nanhai over and said with a gloomy face: "Nanhai, your task has increased again. In the future, you have to prepare meals for eight hundred more people every day—supplying the villagers moved from Damei Village. The engineering projects urgently need this batch of labor."

This notice scared Wu Nanhai into sucking in a breath of cold air: he had provided meals for at most seven hundred people a day. Now increasing by eight hundred out of thin air, wasn't this a satellite-launching style Great Leap Forward? Not to mention other things, just the kitchen equipment wasn't enough.

"The Planning Committee just transported back a batch of spoils from Damei Village, all kitchen and daily necessities of the Gou family. Go pick some." Ma Qianzhu sat behind a rosewood long table, scribbled a note, stamped his private seal, and handed it to him—currently, there was no official seal, and various documents were based on the signatures or private seals of committee members and professional group leaders.

"If we don't farm, we won't even have time just to cook!" Wu Nanhai exploded because he had been busy being a cook recently and didn't have time to engage in his beloved agriculture.

"As for people, you just pick. Some women among the people moved from Damei Village can help. Mainly want reliable ones; anyone with connections to the Gou family is absolutely not wanted. By the way, our food cannot pass through the hands of locals. It's best to separate the cooking places, understand?"

"How do I know who has relations with the Gou family?"

"The Public Security Group is conducting political reviews on them one by one. When a batch of materials comes out, you select a batch."
