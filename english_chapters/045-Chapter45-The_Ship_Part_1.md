# Chapter 45: The Ship (Part 1)

Over the past few days, Guo Yi had been running everywhere. The more he learned, the less he understood.

What he'd expected to be a brief two-to-three-day trip had extended. He reported to his supervisor that he needed to stay longer. From the phone conversation's tone, Guo Yi sensed his boss thought he was being a busybody, or perhaps suspected he was using this as an excuse for paid tourism. But developments had become increasingly intriguing.

First, he noticed that people arrived almost daily—not many, but from all over, speaking various dialects. Most were young and male. They weren't the typical workers for labor-intensive enterprises common in this area. Each carried substantial luggage.

Second, while visiting local businesses the company had contacted, he discovered something unusual.

At various specialized wholesale markets in the area, sales of certain goods had surged over the past three months. A preliminary compilation showed notable increases in: various foods, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, tools, water pumps, electric motors, small power machinery, various grades of high-quality carbon steel and alloy steel materials, electrolytic copper and other metal materials, measuring instruments, clothing, shoes, and socks.

Connecting this to the Crossing Company's nationwide procurement, Guo Yi unhesitatingly concluded these purchases were also theirs. Apparently, they'd divided procurement into two parts: ordinary, simple items locally; technically sophisticated or regionally price-sensitive items directly from elsewhere.

Guo Yi had given up hypothesizing what they planned to do. He decided to visit the company directly.

He took a motorcycle taxi to the base. The training facility looked quite old—mostly 1960s–70s buildings. A central office building was slightly newer but still over a decade old. He saw no signs of construction by the company, though he knew Crossing Trade had purchased considerable construction equipment. The base gate stood open. Two old men sat in the guardhouse chatting and smoking. Everything looked as normal as could be. Guo Yi worried that flashing credentials and entering directly might alert them. So he climbed a nearby hill and observed through binoculars.

On the parade ground, he could see groups in grass-green training uniforms doing formation drills. His view suddenly paused. He clearly saw several ranks holding short bamboo sticks; someone had a military drum. Though too far to hear, these people were obviously marching in drum-beat rhythm. Now the formation expanded into a line, now a column, suddenly a square. Then the front row crouched with sticks angled upward while the rear stood with sticks level—a strange posture.

What were they doing? Guo Yi had been through military training in high school, college, and work orientation. He couldn't recall any of this in formation drills.

He frantically adjusted the focus. These people went through a complete set of movements: manipulating the bamboo sticks, reaching to their chests to grab something, bringing it to their mouths as if biting, then fiddling with the stick's top end... The more he watched, the more confused he became—except for the sticks, they had nothing in their hands!

"Strange," he muttered. He couldn't decipher these hieroglyphic-like movements. He panned the binoculars elsewhere. By a sandpit, a group was practicing unarmed combat. The instructor-like figure in the center was obviously field-army trained—Guo Yi's workplace had many former military personnel. That refined-through-a-thousand-battles bearing of a professional soldier was recognizable even from a distance.

He adjusted to maximum magnification. On the dock, many iron drums and steel angles were piled; some people were welding something, sparks flying. On the dock were also two small rowboats on cradles.

"What on earth is this company up to..."

After wandering around for most of the day, Guo Yi returned to the city, disappointed. Apart from ever-growing puzzlement, he'd gained nothing.

That evening, Guo Yi left his hotel and wandered the streets, finding a small eatery where he drank two beers. He felt thoroughly frustrated. He never doubted his intelligence. In all his years of work, he'd handled many cases—usually figuring things out quickly. But this case still had him lost in fog.

"Better just go back," Guo Yi thought. Holing up here wasn't solving anything. It had already been four days. The investigation couldn't continue indefinitely. From the materials gathered, this company was suspicious—but hadn't done anything harmful to social stability and unity. Their massive procurement was their freedom. Whether it was money laundering or something else, relevant departments could look into it.

---

Guo Yi's investigation reached the Executive Committee through Zhong Lishi and several local contacts' social activities. But the fact that news leaked at all showed no one took it seriously. Xiao Zishan was somewhat worried. They'd come this far—practically at the goal line. No one wanted to end up like the men's national football team. After breakfast, he hurried to find Wen Desi.

"I don't think it's anything." After considering, Wen Desi said. "Let him investigate all he wants. We haven't broken any laws. He won't find anything."

"Still, let's hurry. The longer we wait, the more things can go wrong."

"Have all expected arrivals been confirmed?"

"All confirmed. Nineteen more will arrive by Thursday. I've also confirmed those not coming."

"Then we'll hold the general meeting next Friday."

"Are the related proposals ready?"

"The various teams have been discussing and proposing suggestions these past few days. Morale is quite high."

Just then, the office door opened. Wang Luobin walked in, looking travel-worn. In the Executive Committee, he currently handled project approval, review, and procurement for material preparations—frequently traveling around. For the past three months, he'd been focused on the ship problem.

During their crossing trade, the transmigrators had discovered: the wormhole's energy gradually dissipated as it stayed open. The longer it was open, the more energy it consumed.

Small crossing trades involved at most a few truckloads. But for the main crossing operation, several thousand tons of material had to pass through the wormhole. Using a truck convoy to transport materials and personnel was clearly unfeasible—the crossing time would be too long; they might exhaust the last energy before finishing.

The only way to pass through the wormhole in a short time while transporting large quantities was by ship—the biggest ship possible. The transmigrators' shopping list kept growing. Without a large vessel, there was no way to get hundreds of people and thousands of tons of equipment and materials into the seventeenth century all at once.

Beyond transport itself, a modern cargo ship was a microcosm of modern industrial society: main and auxiliary engines, high- and low-pressure piping, pumps, cables, electronic communications and observation equipment, desalination systems, small machine-repair workshops, medical facilities... With a ship, before any land base was built, they'd have a complete modern world. The transmigrators could draw on electricity and machine-tool support from this modern base. The greatest benefit: it could sustain basic modern living conditions for a considerable time, preventing these spoiled modern people from suffering mental breakdowns due to suddenly harsh conditions.

Finally, there was the considerable military utility. A huge iron ship would create awe-inspiring pressure. Its steel hull feared no cannonballs or incendiary weapons. Even if brave souls tried to board and fight hand-to-hand, they'd have to climb freeboards towering like city walls.

Without mounting any weapons, just ramming at full speed would be enough to terrify any warship of that era. Smaller vessels would sink on impact; larger ones couldn't withstand a steel bow's collision. And they couldn't escape—even very old ships could easily reach 11–14 knots. Except for certain fast clippers in favorable wind, most vessels would be helpless victims.

A glorious multi-turret ironclad battleship! With such a ship, wouldn't they be masters of the ocean?

Behind glorious dreams often lurked terrible reality, and reality arrived courtesy of a maritime-university graduate.

At that moment, Meng De appeared.

Meng De learned about the chat group only after the second batch of core members had reported in. He happened upon information on a BBS he frequented: a spacetime portal had actually appeared, and people were secretly gathering comrades to change history in the early Chongzhen era. After confirming the information's authenticity, Meng De resolutely decided to join—dreaming of becoming a true history-changer.

He was the only maritime-university graduate among this group of transmigrators, with work experience involving ships.

His education and work history immediately caught the Executive Committee's attention. Though they suspected his ship-handling skills might be half-baked, no one else understood large cargo ships.

The maritime university and wormhole energy—two completely unrelated factors—destined him to be one of those with his own chapter in the history of the crossing.

At a specially convened ship-problem meeting, he was hired as a consultant. For this young man only a few years out of school, it was the first time he felt truly valued.

"Director Wen, this isn't easy," Meng De said after hearing the Committee's plan. "Crew—we don't have a crew."

"How many people do we need?"

"For older ships under 5,000 tons, usually 40 people. Over 10,000 tons, more than 50." Meng De spread his hands. "Even newer ships with unmanned engine rooms need over 20. These are all technical positions—transmigrators can't fill them."

Chinese merchant ships, if not carrying passengers, were generally divided into Deck Department and Engine Department. The Deck Department alone had: captain, first/second/third mate, chief radio officer, radio officer, cargo officer, tallyman, bosun, assistant bosun, able seaman, ordinary seaman, chief cook, second cook, third cook, stewards, etc.

The critical Engine Department had: chief engineer, first/second/third engineer, electrician, chief mechanic, head fireman, mechanics, assistant mechanics, coppersmith, electrician, oilers, firemen, etc.

"If we want to use this ship long-term, even if not fully staffed, we'd need at least half. Especially for the Engine Department."

The Executive Committee looked at each other. A ship was this complicated? Well, damn. Having one maritime professional join was already lucky—expecting a whole crew of sailors?

"What if we're just crossing over?"

"Still very difficult, though we'd need somewhat fewer people." Meng De proposed his suggestion: establish a freight-forwarding office at a port on the Leizhou Peninsula and rent a warehouse. All needed materials would be delivered there for loading. They'd rent a coastal bulk carrier with the destination set as Bopu Port on Hainan. Some transmigrators could disguise themselves as backpackers hitching a ride—common on coastal freighters. The rest would travel ahead on several fishing boats to the rendezvous point. When the ship approached port, the transmigrators would seize control, detain the crew, pilot the ship through the gate, and beach it on Hainan Island.

"The Qiongzhou Strait is very narrow. I personally believe my ship-handling ability is up to it. For engine and basic deck crew, I suggest the Committee send some people to train—but this ship basically won't be usable afterward."
