# Chapter 281 Sweet Port Turbulence – Rice Prices and Sugar Prices

"Not now." Chang Shide said. "Explaining would take too much time. First, let's print them some kind of passbook to record the amounts. That way the cane farmers have something to hold onto, and it'll be easier to gather them for a meeting later."

Wen Tong said with a smile: "Good idea. Where'd you come up with that?"

"You know those people who sell health products? They hook people in with free health checkups. If you don't give them some little benefits, who's going to come listen to your spiel?"

"But how should we print this passbook? It has to be reusable, with space to write on." Wen Tong hesitated. "Should we ask Lingao for help?"

Liao Daxing said: "This isn't hard to do. It's just making a little booklet for the cane farmers. Any paper shop can do it."

"?" The transmigrators all looked at Liao Daxing in unison. Chang Shide asked: "They have passbooks here too?"

Liao Daxing was a bit confused, and said: "Yes, every shop has them." He pulled a booklet from his sleeve and handed it over. Wen Tong unfolded it and saw that inside, in neat small script, were recorded transaction dates and amounts, with both parties' personal seals stamped on top.

"This is the booklet from the grain trader that delivers our food."

"Good, we'll use this kind." Wen Tong said happily. "Let's order three thousand to start."

Liao Daxing was startled. Three thousand right off the bat—every paper shop in all of Leizhou could be turned upside down and they still wouldn't have that many. He quickly said: "There's no such supply. In my humble opinion, this kind of booklet is too large. Since it won't be used all that often, we should just have some custom-made right away. A smaller size will work fine—it'll be faster to make and cheaper too."

So the matter was settled. The group then discussed various arrangements for opening day. What gave Wen Tong a headache was the matter of gathering silver. He had long since learned that this area exported over two hundred thousand *shi* of sugar each year. He estimated that most of the sugar would still be purchased by the trading houses of Haiyi Hall, and their side could probably buy about twenty thousand *shi*. That would require roughly fifty thousand *liang* of silver. When the Guangzhou Station had arranged for Qiwei Escort Agency to set up in Leizhou, they had deposited ten thousand *liang* of cash locally. Wen Tong had brought another three thousand when he came to Leizhou. But this money had been nearly all spent on infrastructure, settling migrants, and cultivating relations with officials. The only funds available were the ten thousand *liang* in Guangzhou.

That amount was far too short. The Guangzhou Station was certainly willing to provide full support—they said they could allocate a hundred thousand *liang* at any time—but the Great Ming had no remittance institutions. Silver had to be physically transported over a thousand *li*, which felt extremely unsafe.

After racking their brains for a while without finding a suitable solution, one day Chang Shide took Liao Daxing to stroll around the county seat to clear their minds. This was his only hobby besides training his female slaves: wearing a silk *zhiduo* robe, striding proudly down the dusty, dirt streets. His unusual height, build, and fair skin made people step aside in awe—the feeling of being a big shot was quite nice. While strolling, Chang Shide quickly noticed a phenomenon: prices in Xuwen were very high!

In the past, when Liao Dahua had purchased grain for the migrants, he'd reported expenses of two *liang* per *shi*. Chang Shide had once suspected Liao Dahua was skimming a profit in the middle, but after several months, he discovered that while grain prices fluctuated, they had never dropped below two *liang*, and were in fact trending upward. Even though Lingao was just across the Qiongzhou Strait, Lingao's grain prices had never exceeded one *liang* five *qian* even at their highest.

Besides grain, everything here was more expensive than in Lingao—from firewood, ironware, and cloth to ordinary household jars and pots. This was even more obvious during their two rounds of construction projects. Moreover, copper coins were rarely used here; most transactions were in silver. For small payments, a type of specially minted silver pellet was used. This phenomenon greatly interested Chang Shide. Though he hadn't studied economics, he understood basic economic principles—clearly, silver was more devalued here than in Lingao.

"Manager Liao," Chang Shide asked Liao Daxing, "why is the price of rice so high in Xuwen?"

"You've asked the right person." This topic hit Liao Daxing right in his sweet spot. "I used to work in the grain trade. It's not just Xuwen—even Haikang has terrifyingly high rice prices! Only Suixi is a bit better. The reason is simple: growing sugarcane is more profitable. Everyone converts their paddy fields to sugarcane, and when there's not enough food, it has to be shipped in from elsewhere. Naturally, prices go up."

"I see." Chang Shide nodded.

"That's exactly how it is!" Liao Daxing said. "Sugarcane is very demanding—it needs lots of water, lots of fertilizer, lots of labor. Once you plant sugarcane, nobody has the capacity to also work paddy fields anymore."

"Where does the grain from outside come from?"

"It's shipped by sea, mostly from the north. Sea travel is unpredictable—pirates, storms, shipwrecks and losses can be huge. Since it's hard to ship here, naturally it's expensive."

Seeing that Chang Shide hadn't said anything, Liao Daxing licked his lips and smiled: "Actually, I have another thought, though I'm not sure if it's right—"

"Let's hear it."

"In my humble opinion, the key is that Leizhou has too much silver—"

Chang Shide stopped walking and glanced at him, feeling quite surprised—he had assumed people of this era wouldn't understand this principle and would equate precious metals directly with wealth itself.

"That makes sense!" Chang Shide immediately looked at this former grain-house clerk with new respect.

"Yes," Liao Daxing saw that the master looked quite approving and quickly elaborated. "Leizhou exports over two hundred thousand *shi* of sugar every year, bringing in four or five hundred thousand *liang* of silver. With so much silver around, naturally all goods become expensive."

"Yes, things are expensive here, but sugar is something everyone wants." Chang Shide mused. He seemed to dimly see a solution taking shape.

"Manager Liao, how are the cane farmers' returns these days?"

"Not bad, I suppose. Whatever the case, it's much better than growing rice!"

"Mm." Chang Shide asked another question: "Do any ships from here go to Champa?"

"What for, going to Champa?" Liao Daxing felt this was odd. "Nobody here does overseas trade."

The outline of a plan was gradually becoming clear in Chang Shide's mind. Somewhat excitedly, he clapped Liao Daxing on the shoulder: "Let's go. Back we go."

That evening, unable to wait for the slow method of sending messages via carrier pigeon through Guangzhou, he wrote a secret letter directly and instructed the Qiwei Escort Agency to dispatch someone to Lingao by ship first thing the next morning. This matter required the Foreign Affairs Ministry's cooperation.

Chang Shide's plan was simple:

Since silver wasn't worth much in Leizhou, using cash to purchase raw sugar wasn't a worthwhile business strategy.

Leizhou had too much silver, making everything expensive. Using a commodity that everyone needed and that already commanded a high price to exchange for raw sugar would be a smarter deal. That commodity was rice.

If rice was shipped the traditional way from northern Guangdong, the sea voyage was too long and the risks were too great.

So his thinking was: ship sugar from Leizhou to Vietnam and sell it there. Vietnam didn't grow sugarcane, so sugar prices would be very high. On the other hand, Vietnamese rice was famously cheap. The rice obtained in exchange for sugar could then be paid to cane farmers at Leizhou's rice prices as payment for their sugar. This essentially meant earning double profits.

But this involved the issue of trading with Vietnam. Chang Shide didn't understand Vietnamese trade regulations, didn't know the sea conditions along the Vietnamese coast, and didn't know local rice and sugar prices. Rashly organizing ships to go to Vietnam would obviously be risky.

The Foreign Affairs Ministry didn't dare delay upon receiving this letter and immediately reported to the Executive Committee. In no time, all departments were in motion. The Intelligence Committee quickly announced that this plan was feasible: the Portuguese had once transported Chinese sugar to Vietnam and sold it at eight *liang* per *shi*! This was double the English purchase price in Guangzhou! The huge profits of maritime trade made everyone restless. Demands were made for the Executive Committee to immediately open the door to Vietnamese trade.

"The time has come. Vietnam's abundant resources can no longer be left slumbering." Zealots agitated at the enlarged Executive Committee meeting. "Let's turn it into our raw materials base and market!"

"Armed expedition!"

"Where cannons lead, trade follows!"

"Let us install a few cannons on Vietnam's coastline and thereby enslave an entire nation!"

"It would be best to establish the Vietnam trade route as soon as possible." Ma Qianzhu wasn't particularly interested in sugar-for-rice trading, but he'd been coveting Hongji's coal for ages.

Thus the plan to open trade with Vietnam was finalized. Considering that Vietnam's political situation at this time was rather chaotic—with the Northern and Southern Courts facing off, and the Dutch and Portuguese lurking in the background, plus the Jesuits having a hand in things—the various conflicting interests were complex. In the end, they decided to enter in a relatively low-profile manner.

The trading situation between Vietnam's Northern and Southern Courts and China was as follows: entering a Northern Court port required an annual fee of one thousand *liang*. The Southern Court had opened one city specifically for Chinese trade. The Transmigration Collective chose to enter northern Lê dynasty territory, which had not only rice but also coal, and was relatively closer to both Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula.

The ship the Executive Committee dispatched to Vietnam was the *Great Whale*, the same transport ship that had previously come to Leizhou. Though the attempt to use it as a container ship had failed, its wide hull and large cargo capacity were still obvious advantages. Its shallow draft was well-suited to the typically shallow waters and poorly equipped docks of this era. As for its slightly slower speed, that wasn't too big a problem either—the sailing voyage to Vietnam's Hongji area wouldn't take more than two days.

The *Great Whale* came to Leizhou and loaded a thousand *shi* of raw brown sugar at Hai'an port. To ensure the ship's safety, it temporarily carried four 12-pound howitzers and one infantry platoon—serving both as bodyguards and as laborers. The person commanding this operation was none other than Chang Shide himself.

As for the essential translator, neither Lingao nor Leizhou could solve this problem—though they were close by, no one had ever gone to Vietnam to do business. Guo Yi had originally tried to find one among the sea merchants in Guangzhou, but the clannish, closed nature of the sea merchant community made such recruitment completely ineffective. In the end, they thought of the Jesuits in Macau. This organization had many tentacles and went everywhere. Zhang Xin rushed to Macau and found Father Louis.

With Father Louis's help, Zhang Xin recruited a down-on-his-luck former petty pirate leader named Zhang Dabala in Macau. This man was a dark, fat fellow with a large scar on his face, which earned him the nickname—as for his real name, even he himself could barely remember it. He had originally been under Yang Liu and Yang Qi. After the Two Yangs' defeat, Zhang Dabala, who had saved up a tidy sum, fled to Macau—the old pirate, who'd suffered many serious wounds and whose scars ached every rainy day, was starting to feel his age and wanted to retire comfortably. But he got swindled in Macau and lost everything. Having spent his years as a pirate and knowing no trade, he soon ended up on the streets, surviving on Jesuit charity. Eventually, for the sake of two bowls of thin rice porridge a day, he got baptized and joined the church—now he was a fellow believer.

Though Zhang Dabala was past his fighting days, he was still a weathered old sea dog familiar with the sea routes throughout Southeast Asia. He also spoke several languages, including Vietnamese and Malay.

Zhang Xin saw at once that he was a suitable candidate. He hired him on the spot, making clear that he wouldn't need to risk his life—just interpret. Twelve Spanish dollars a month. Zhang Dabala, who'd been sipping thin gruel until he was sick of it, immediately boarded their pirate ship.

Just before the *Great Whale* departed from the Hai'an Street dock, Chang Shide gave instructions to Wen Tong: "Old Wen, this trip will take at least ten days or so. The buildings are pretty much done now—don't wait any longer. You go ahead and arrange sugar purchasing here. We have ten thousand *liang* of silver to work with. That should be enough to hold until I get back."

"Good." Wen Tong gripped his hand firmly. What a great comrade—not only coming up with such a good idea but also volunteering to go to unfamiliar Vietnam to conduct trade and open new frontiers. Then he turned and saw A-Xiu carrying a basket, waiting to board. He thought this fellow was really hopeless.

Chang Shide shamelessly commandeered a private cabin and had A-Xiu set it up as a cozy little nest. Then he lounged comfortably, waiting for the ship to arrive at Ha Long.

The ship sailed for two days at sea. Finally—

They got lost!

"Where are we?"

"Should be Ha Long Bay, I think." Le Lin held a sextant and mumbled uncertainly—he was the ship's temporary captain.

"What do you mean 'should be'?!" Bei Kai finally exploded amid his seasickness misery. He'd been selected for the Vietnam trade delegation purely because he looked Vietnamese. Since yesterday, the *Great Whale* had entered a relatively calm bay. The bay was dotted with various small islands, somewhat scenic. But they had no idea which way to sail to reach Hongji.

Le Lin's latitude and longitude calculations had been wildly inconsistent, with errors so large that no one trusted his measurements. Some had been grumbling that they should have hired a local helmsman rather than letting this amateur navigate.

"You take the helm." Chang Shide finally kicked Le Lin aside and called Zhang Dabala over to pilot the ship.
