# Chapter 114: Gou Family Manor (Part 4)

That evening, the Military Group held a brief staff meeting based on reconnaissance and interrogation results. Wu De presided—he was the operation's commander. In 21st-century terms: Gou Manor Demolition Project Manager.

Wu De intended forcible demolition, naturally needing manpower. Coincidentally or deliberately, the Military Group's key leaders were all absent from Bairren Fortress. The only remaining Army-branch leader was He Ming. He Ming was an old soldier—known for obedience and strong principles. Coordinating with Navy-branch Wu De was relatively easy.

Attendees included Military Group personnel and representatives from various professional committees. Gou Manor would be their first spoils of war. Though just a small tyrant's stronghold, it was prelude to future captures of larger county seats, prefectures, even the capital. How to pacify residents after occupation, how to inventory confiscated property, how to conduct propaganda—all needed preparation.

Based on available intelligence, Gou Manor's defenses were unremarkable even by contemporary standards. Direct military breakthrough wasn't difficult. The Military Group proposed the simplest, safest plan: use rifles to clear wall defenders, then have armored construction machinery ram the gate. No wooden gate—even iron-plated—could withstand a multi-hundred-horsepower bulldozer. But this was somewhat extravagant. Engineering vehicles traveling from Bairren Fortress to Gou Manor—terrain was flat, no problem for tracked vehicles—but the distance was considerable. Besides fuel consumption, machinery work hours were significant.

Simpler alternative: assault teams using ladders or human pyramids to scale walls, seize the gate, then open it. But post-scaling, they'd likely face militia counterattacks—possibly close combat. Most Military Group members didn't fear bayonet fighting—but any casualties would be irreplaceable losses.

"We can't always play it completely safe." He Ming said. "Soldiers are forged in battle—not coddled like this." He lit a crumpled cigarette.

"Gate isn't a problem." Ji Situi spoke for the Chemistry Group. "We've manufactured some explosives—can blast the gate open. If needed, grenades too."

"Explosives?" Everyone was surprised. To avoid complications, no explosives or pyrotechnics had been purchased during preparations. Where did explosives come from?

"Is it black powder?" Someone recalled they'd captured about a hundred *jin* from the militia.

"Not that primitive." Ji Situi smiled proudly. These two months, the Chemistry Group—lacking essential raw materials and energy—had mostly done infrastructure: installing production equipment. Now installations were nearly complete, and these highly capable enthusiasts immediately began developing that crossing essential—explosives.

Explosives required a chemical industry foundation. Currently, the Chemistry Group had equipment and technology but lacked production materials—especially coal and salt. Basic "three acids, two alkalis" production hadn't started. Fortunately, the Chemistry Group had anticipated military needs. When purchasing chemicals, they'd specially ordered ammonium nitrate fertilizer—not for Wu Nanhai's use. Using this fertilizer, they'd now produced an upgrade: ammonium nitrate explosives.

Anyone knowing explosives knew: ammonium nitrate itself was a low-power explosive. The Chemistry Group wasn't satisfied using fertilizer directly as explosives—first, it didn't show their expertise; second, it wasted limited resources. Upgrading ammonium nitrate to ammonium nitrate explosives meant adding other components. Several formulas existed—some added high explosives, some added combustibles. Ammonium nitrate explosives were mostly used in demolition work, also for landmines and grenades. During WWII, the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army bought ammonium nitrate from occupied areas for processing into explosives. Benefits: decent power, low sensitivity—bullets, fire, or vibration wouldn't detonate it.

The Chemistry Group's product was ammonium-sawdust explosive—sawdust added. This stuff was everywhere at Bopu's sawmill—no trouble at all. With simple equipment, they'd produced about 50 kg—not daring to make more. This stuff absorbed moisture easily, becoming useless when damp. Hainan's humidity was high year-round.

*(Note: Ingredient ratios and manufacturing procedures won't be written here. National celebrations approaching—everyone please avoid discussing sensitive topics.)*

For detonators, the Chemistry Group couldn't produce mercury fulminate without mercury—but black powder was a good booster. The Bairren Rapids battle's captured black powder, though poor quality, worked with larger quantities. For reliable ignition, the Chemistry Group had reprocessed this powder—granulating it into paper packets sealed with wood-tar pitch for moisture-proofing.

"Let's make a 'No-Conscience Cannon'! Simple to make, powerful." Zhang Bailin was excited. Sending explosive charges seemed insufficient—better to shell Gou Manor.

"Completely unnecessary." He Ming shook his head repeatedly. "Mortar-launched charges have insufficient range and no accuracy. Who knows where they'd land?"

"Mm, too much collateral damage. If they land in residential areas, massive casualties. We're targeting Landlord Gou—ordinary people should be protected as much as possible." Wu Nanhai firmly opposed.

Zhang Bailin raised a sharp question: "Then who'll deliver the explosive charges? Enemy has bows, arrows, and cannons at range; rolling logs, stones, lime pots, and hot excrement up close."

He Ming laughed: "Fifty SKS rifles suppressing the wall—that's enough firepower."

"But enemies can hide behind battlements!"

"You don't know M43 round power?" Sniper Lin Shenhe smiled. "Within 100 meters, these can definitely penetrate those brick battlements."

Fifty 20-round-magazine SKS-D semi-automatics firing continuously—firepower rivaling machine guns. Even invincible Iron Man couldn't stay—let alone throw rolling logs. 

"Still not satisfied without artillery." Zhang Bailin wouldn't give up.

The gate-breaking plan was settled: Military Group provides suppressing fire on the wall; explosive charges blast the gate; everyone assaults into the manor.

"After entering the manor, things aren't finished." He Ming pointed at the map. "The manor interior itself has nothing special—just ordinary civilian housing. We just need to hold intersections, patrol the walls, prevent escapes—this is crucial! The key is the Gou family compound. Once outer walls fall, all their forces will retreat inside for a last stand. So after entering, first priority: quickly seize roads to the compound's front and rear gates—prevent scattered retreaters from entering. The fewer who get inside, the easier to finish them."

Wu De said: "Interrogation revealed Gou Manor has over 200 militia and guards—mostly mainland fugitives with murder warrants. These people, cornered, will fight desperately—causing us much trouble."

"Is the inner compound very strong?"

"We've drawn a diagram from prisoner statements." Wu De posted it on the blackboard. "Through the main gate, there's an east-west cross street. Along it, seven rows of compounds—some with five courtyards, some with three. Main and side courtyards house Gou family members. Plus many annexes, servant quarters, and storage yards. All compounds have their own walls. But once we're inside the manor, the Gou family becomes turtles in a jar—nowhere to escape. He'll probably offer heavy rewards for guards to fight to the death. His kinsmen will likely fight desperately too. The compound has several wells; ample stores of grain and charcoal. If they truly fight to the death, we'll have to assault with manpower."

"Attacking the compound isn't hard—rifles and explosives together, we'll take it quickly."

"The most valuable things in Gou Manor are all in the inner compound. Destroying it defeats our purpose." Wu De repeatedly emphasized their objective. "Plus, if they grow desperate and set fires—all gold, silver, and grain would be lost."

"Wonder how much treasure the Gou family has." Someone was already daydreaming.

"Haven't you heard? The Gou family also hosts pirates. Loot from sea raids must be enormous. We're about to get rich!"

"Most useful now isn't treasure—it's grain!" Wu Nanhai was more anxious than anyone—he knew the food reserve situation better than anyone.

"Grain or treasure, once we take it, it's ours." Wu De smiled. "But speed is essential. Scouts killed Gou Second's men today. Even if the Gou family are pigs, they'll know someone's coming for them. They might move or hide assets. I propose starting tomorrow—surround the manor first."

"After taking the manor, there'll certainly be lots of loot. We few can't carry it all. Vehicles—with no good roads locally—need human labor to haul it out. That means mobilizing the masses."

"Right—I'd almost forgotten." Wu De remembered. "The salt villagers are ready-made. Xi Yazhou's doing great work there. Have the work team mobilize all villagers—fighting we can't count on them yet, but sentry duty and hauling stuff they can do."

Everyone discussed troop numbers, siege equipment and supplies, medical support arrangements, propaganda proclamations, and civilian relief procedures—deliberating until nearly midnight before settling everything.
