# Chapter 392 - Breaking Free

"Surrender and live!" As marines shouted, soon people staggered out from below deck and cargo piles, one by one kneeling dejectedly on deck, awaiting judgment. Ruan Xiaowu ordered them all bound and sent ashore for transport to Lingao for interrogation.

Then they searched below deck and found many bound people—the ship's sailors, merchants, and such. Ruan Xiaowu didn't bother distinguishing; he ordered them all sent to Lingao too. These unfortunates trembled, not knowing which new band of heroes had captured them.

Ruan Xiaowu led men to search one level deeper. The hold below deck was packed with cargo. Apparently pirates hadn't had time to steal much—besides, their main targets were valuables; heavy goods like porcelain didn't interest them. Though ransacked, most items remained.

"So many good things." Several marines whispered. From enlistment day one, "all captured goods belong to the collective; no hiding spoils; no looting civilian property" had been constantly drilled as discipline; they knew violations brought terrible consequences. But even so, with vast wealth before them, people naturally grew tempted. Yet the young cadet's face was impenetrable, impartial; soldiers dared think no further. This was officer leadership by example.

"Seal all hatch entries." Ruan Xiaowu ordered, then arranged for corpse and scattered cargo collection, awaiting reinforcement personnel to take over.

Chen Haiyang was delighted receiving the report. Recent maritime suppression had been charity work without profit—just battered small boats and ragged prisoners. Now hearing they'd found such a windfall—a four-to-five-hundred-ton Guangdong ship fully loaded with cargo—he even dispatched the rarely-used Type 67 landing craft, delivering a marine company and three cannons to guard against anyone trying to seize this prize.

Wen Desi, hearing about the large ship, couldn't focus on his pile of administrative work. Using the excuse of helping refloat the ship, he organized a work team and departed with the vessel. Naturally the landing craft also carried Planning Committee personnel—there to register and receive spoils. Planning Committee people were now called "omnipresent vultures." This "vulture" was a young man named Sun Xiao. He wore black native-cloth work clothes with a red armband bearing an archaic-script "Planning" character. He carried the Planning Committee's personnel-issue native-cloth satchel—larger than Army and Navy satchels, able to hold more ledgers and loose-leaf paper. Embroidered on it in red: "Planning Committee Exclusive."

"Five-masted ship!" When the Guangdong ship appeared in Wen Desi's view, he couldn't help slapping the armrest. This was his first time seeing such a large Chinese sea vessel in person. Where would such ships appear in Lingao waters! This prize was enormous.

Zhan Wuya was also startled by such a large wooden ship: "At least 300 tons!"

"Underestimate. This ship's displacement is 500 to 600 tons." Wen Desi had researched this extensively.

"Traditional Chinese wooden ships could be built this large?"

"The mythical ten-thousand-ton wooden ships some boast about couldn't be built. Among common Chinese sea vessels, Spanish records mention 800-ton sailing ships coming to Manila for trade. Five-to-six-hundred-ton ships aren't rare."

The landing craft rendezvoused with Patrol Boat 101 beside the sandbar. Yue Lin had been waiting anxiously. Seeing Director Wen had personally come, he hurried to report.

"No rush—first tell me about patrol boat issues." This was his patrol boat design's first combat. Wen Desi wanted front-line personnel's direct feedback.

"Very good."

"Very good?" Wen Desi thought this feedback was rather simple, though at least indicating no overall problems.

"Any issues?"

"Well—" Yue Lin couldn't immediately think of specifics; the after-action review hadn't been held yet.

"The machine gun gets too hot. After less than ten drums, the wooden stock nearly caught fire."

"That shouldn't happen." Wen Desi thought troops' Minié rifles could fire fifteen or twenty consecutive rounds without overheating. One barrel overheating after ten rounds?

"Absolutely true. Also, tremendous vibration, no accuracy, chaotic trajectory. Power's decent though."

"Possible." Zhan Wuya examined the "typewriter." Two shooters were disassembling cooled barrels one by one, cleaning each. Paper cartridges' major problem was heavy barrel residue.

"Bundled barrels with no cooling devices, directly fixed together, make cooling even harder."

"Submit a report to Industrial Committee Weapons Group when you're back. See about adding heat sinks or something." Wen Desi wasn't particularly interested in multi-barrel guns. In his view, using stockpiled spring components to produce a Maxim machine gun was child's play—this retro-style contraption existed only because mass-producing metal cartridges remained unsolved.

"How's the rigging?"

"Turning is agile. Director Wen, your design is excellent." Yue Lin had learned to flatter leadership.

Patrol Boat 101 had performed well overall in combat—hull and deck equipment sustained no major damage; casualties were minimal. Of course combat intensity was light; after all, pirates lacked determination for a fight to the death. But this matched its design intent.

As for the prize, Yue Lin said the entire ship had been searched—living and dead all removed.

"...Prisoners transported away, corpses thrown overboard. The ship still has lots of cargo; no ship to unload at the moment. Perhaps wait for the ship to float and sail it directly?"

"Cargo must be unloaded, or the ship won't float." Wen Desi checked his watch, then the sea. High tide now—the sandbar completely submerged—but the ship remained grounded, motionless. Obviously without unloading, tidal power alone was hopeless.

"Let's circle the ship."

Several people rowed a sampan around the large ship. The bow was grounded on the sandbar, deeply embedded—apparently the panicked helmsman had rammed it straight on.

"Looks deeply stuck. Won't float without external force." Wen Desi assessed.

Meng De said: "It's not that simple. The bow, struck with such force, must have damage. See how it's listing? Must pump and repair compartments first."

He scanned the sea, then the slightly tilted hull: "Currently we have two options to free it: wait for the next highest tide and use ships to tow it off the shallows; or use flotation barrels to lift it."

"We have plenty of iron barrels, but they're all in use by various departments. Need to ask everyone to empty them." Zhan Wuya hesitated—actually the Industrial Committee's departments were the main users.

"Go with option one. Leaving it here invites trouble." Wen Desi worried looking at this fortune.

"How badly is the ship damaged?" Sun Xiao asked. Planning Committee people always fussed over costs and outputs—perhaps from their mostly accounting backgrounds.

"I think it's not too badly damaged. Rigging is total loss, but all masts remain. Patch up the sails—don't need them perfect, just functional. Though slower, it can still move. If too slow, have Landing Craft 67 tow it."

"That's a lot of work." Zhan Wuya looked at the enormous hull.

"No problem. Get me Chen Haiyang on the radio."

Chen Haiyang, hearing the ship had valuable cargo, immediately agreed to send additional ships and sailors to lighter cargo. Necessary equipment and technicians would also come aboard.

Highest tide would come at night. Wen Desi decided to prepare first. Marines from the landing craft climbed aboard, quickly assembling a hoist crane on deck, then lifting cannons, ammunition, and related supplies aboard. Wen Desi and others also boarded.

The deck had already been cleared by Ruan Xiaowu's detail. Marines mounted cannons on the stern castle, also erecting a tent on deck as temporary command post for Wen Desi's group.

After reinforcement ships arrived, over a hundred marines worked five hours to unload the hold, crane cargo to waiting sailing ships below to lighten the hull. The ship held not only abundant common export goods—porcelain, silk, medicinal herbs—but also cheap bulk items like coarse pottery, ironware, and tinware. Transport ships made several trips to offload two-thirds of cargo. Remaining cargo Wen Desi planned to use during refloating.

While inspecting the hull, Meng De found two seams with cracks on the left side near the wales. Fortunately the ship listed slightly starboard, keeping the opening above waterline. Spare shipbuilding materials were aboard; Meng De had shipyard workers seal the gaps on-site.

Inspecting hull and bilge, Meng De found it hadn't sustained serious grounding damage. The bottom had taken water, but not deeply. Just the bow was embedded deeply in sand—only extractable at highest tide.

After internal inspection, Meng De swam to the bottom to feel for the exact gap location and whether the keel was damaged.

"There's a gap below. Not large." Meng De emerged from standing water in the bilge, gasping heavily. "Must pump dry before patching. We'll pump immediately when tide falls."

So the pump was hoisted from a sailing ship. This manually-operated pump was worked in rotation by marines, quickly draining the water. Several shipyard workers immediately began repairs—they had to finish before the rising tide.

Eventually all gaps were patched. Then came rigging cleanup. The five masts remained intact; only the rigging had been destroyed in the fierce boarding battle. They salvaged one usable sail, patching it with remaining sail fragments and materials.

All that remained was figuring out how to free the ship. Unfortunately strait tides didn't rise very high...

Wen Desi ordered marines to move remaining cargo—ironware, coarse pottery, spare provisions—all to the stern, weighting it to help tip the bow out of the sand.

Finally, steel cables were attached to the ship, the other ends secured to Landing Craft 67. At high tide, using seawater's buoyancy plus landing craft towing, they'd pull the ship off the shallows.

By the time these tasks finished, it was midnight. Everyone was exhausted. Wind was slackening; several former military men observed cloud colors and formations, detecting strengthening wind ahead.

"That's good. We'll raise sails and borrow some wind power." Meng De said. "Let's rest now. Heavy work ahead."

Sleeping directly on deck was impossible—wind was picking up and, adding insult to injury, rain began falling. Everyone had to spend the night in the ransacked stern castle—pirates had thoroughly rifled through these quarters intended for ship's officers. Everyone lay fully clothed on cabin floors. Yue Lin's flotilla took night watch.

In the small hours, dozing Wen Desi suddenly felt the ship shift.

"High tide's here! Everyone up!"

They watched long, low waves roll in one after another. The sandbar gradually disappeared. Refloating time was approaching. Anxiety filled every heart; everyone was overly tense. No one spoke; all awaited orders.

Wen Desi had now descended to the landing craft, intently observing tidal patterns. He glanced uneasily at the two taut, stretched steel cables.

"Raise sails!" Wen Desi called to Meng De on the big ship's deck via walkie-talkie. "Watch the windward face!"

The hastily-patched sail rose on the mainmast. "Hardtop sails raise fast"—before Wen Desi finished the thought, four o'clock arrived—tide at maximum height. This was the instant between rising and falling. Must act now—no more delay!

"Full power!" Wen Desi shouted.

Landing Craft 67's engines immediately pushed output to maximum. Control panel rows of indicator lights flashed wildly.

Aboard the large ship, the sail shuddered in strong wind, making tearing sounds. Meng De noticed the patched areas already showing cracks. Hopefully they'd hold until the ship floated.

Wind's force, tide's action, plus landing craft towing. The large ship's hull seemed to move slightly, emitting creaking sounds.

"Ship's moving." Meng De, wearing a rain jacket, sheltered the walkie-talkie against his chest and shouted.

"Good—tell everyone be careful." Wen Desi's voice came through the walkie-talkie mixed with the engine's tremendous roar. Meng De couldn't help peering at the landing craft's lights in the distance, bobbing amid the waves.

Water rose more powerfully, swelling the hull, pushing outward. People felt the hull shuddering several times, seemingly about to float.

Wind blew harder. Meng De heard mast creaking and rigging shrieking. Rain blinded him.

"Ship's floating! More power!" he shouted into the walkie-talkie.

"Already overloaded—"

Suddenly a gust struck. The hull lurched violently; the sail emitted a sharp scream.

"No!" Meng De knew the sail had torn. Indeed, a huge black shadow crashed down upon him, immediately knocking him unconscious.

But in that instant, the ship had borrowed that force to float free, rocking violently on the water. The taut steel cables emitted terrifying whistles. For a moment, Wen Desi's legs went weak aboard the landing craft.

The ship finally stabilized in the wind and rain, then under landing craft towing left the sandbar. By daybreak, the flotilla returned to Bo-pu. When this unprecedented Chinese five-masted sailing ship was towed into harbor, transmigrators ashore erupted in excitement. Many came to gawk.

Meng De was sent to Bo-pu's clinic. Suspecting fractures, they rushed him by vehicle to Bairren General Hospital for X-rays. After consultation, Hippo announced Meng De's life wasn't in danger: two broken ribs plus mild concussion. The safety helmet had saved him—otherwise his skull wouldn't have survived. After examination, Zhang Ziyi gave him a sedative injection; he slept.

"Now I've lost a key captain and instructor." Chen Haiyang lamented heavy losses. Meng De would be out for months.

"No problem—you gained a big ship." Wen Desi said. "Repair and modify it, and it could become a capital sailing ship."

Complete cargo inventory took 48 hours. Seeing the thick ledgers Sun Xiao brought, Ma Qianzhu felt they'd hit a windfall. Cargo was not only voluminous but varied—especially daily necessities, very helpful for Lingao's current consumer goods shortage.

But this cargo was strangely organized: not sorted and stacked by category, but different merchandise mixed together in piles, with various bamboo tags bearing names attached. This seemed to be different merchants' goods.

"Besides the shipowner, apparently multiple merchants rented cargo space." Ma Qianzhu saw the name tags piled on the desk.

"If they're still alive, confiscating their cargo seems wrong." Sun Xiao said.

Ma Qianzhu was unconcerned: "Probably all dead. Ownerless property belongs to the finder."

But facts proved Ma Qianzhu had celebrated too soon. Just as he was using a calculator against mountains of departmental requisition forms to calculate allocation, Ran Yao slipped in.

"Director Ma, there's a complication."

"What?"

"During prisoner interrogation, we discovered quite a few of the ship's merchants are still alive."

"Really!" Ma Qianzhu involuntarily paused his pen. A thought suddenly flashed through his mind. He deliberately placed the pen on a jade penholder, saying: "Hard to say—nine out of ten are probably pirates impersonating merchants..."

"No—we found a passenger manifest on the ship, with customer names, cargo quantities, and types. Cross-verification confirmed accuracy."

According to Political Security Bureau investigation, this ship had been built by a Hai-surnamed gentry from Qiongshan County. Besides his own cargo, the ship carried thirty-eight merchants, each with their own goods.
