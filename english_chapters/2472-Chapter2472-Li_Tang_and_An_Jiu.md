# Chapter 2472 - Li Tang and An Jiu

This marked the beginning of the discussion process for formal implementation details. Hosted by Chen Xiaobing, both sides began to proceed with specific implementation.

This batch of "capacity diffusion" private bidding projects adopted a "one-on-one" model. That is, each project had an enterprise under the Senate for counterpart implementation.

The specific factory site was set in Nansha. Chen Ding and Chen Lin planned to take this opportunity to borrow the Australians' power to squeeze the annoying Chen Xuan out of the power center of Nansha.

Wu Yijun stated that he had purchased several hundred *mu* of sand fields (alluvial fields) in Nansha, which could be used to grow cotton. The Chen family uncle and nephew also patted their chests, saying Nansha was the world of the Chen clan; whether growing cotton, opening factories, or repairing water channels, there would be no obstacles.

"Our Chen Lin is also the eldest grandson of the eldest branch of the clan; the future clan leader will definitely be him. Selecting the factory site in Nansha is foolproof."

How would Li Shan know the little schemes in their hearts? Hearing them speak extravagantly, and hearing it was in Xiangshan County—exactly the county where Li Yao'er went to improve silk—he felt the conditions were suitable and approved this site selection.

Both sides also agreed on the relevant schedule, including worker training, civil construction technical guidance, and the arrival time of relevant infrastructure personnel, among a series of details. Finally, a "Memorandum of Nansha Cotton Mill Cooperation Agreement" was initialed.

According to this agreement, the cotton mill would enter the preparatory stage in March, followed by the start of civil construction and equipment installation, striving to start operation (*kaiche*) in the autumn of 1637. Specifically, the Chen family uncle and nephew had to complete the preparation work for infrastructure land in Nansha in March.

Chen Ding took the opportunity to propose that he hoped an Elder or a high-level naturalized cadre would be present to boost morale.

"This will be handed over to Chen Xiaobing." Li Shan understood these people's thoughts. It was true that the Chen family was very powerful in Nansha, but the clan internally might not be a monolithic block. Whether Chen Lin, this young man, could hold the fort then was also hard to say. Thinking of various troubles caused locally during the Westernization Movement in the late Qing Dynasty, their request was also very reasonable. He immediately stated his position.

"...He is your counterpart cadre; you can go through him for relevant affairs. As for us, we will also go to your place to have a look every now and then."

"Thank you, Chief." The Chen family uncle and nephew looked at each other; now let's see if Chen Xuan still dares to be rampant!

"In addition, we have selected the technical cadres for counterpart aid to you. Since you are here today, imply meet them and get to know each other."

Not long after, four young men and women came in from outside. All wore uniform "Cadre Suits." One of them was the girl who served them tea just now.

As soon as this girl came in, she pulled the sleeve of another girl. The two looked towards the Chen family uncle and nephew and immediately looked at each other and laughed.

The Chen family uncle and nephew realized almost simultaneously: Aren't these two girls the ones who took the same ship as them to Lingao!

Because they were wearing student uniforms at that time, but now changed into "Cadre Suits," they didn't recognize them for a moment. Meeting here at this time, the uncle and nephew coincided in thinking of the evaluation "Old Pervert," and both felt somewhat awkward.

"Let me introduce." Li Shan didn't know they had such a past story and introduced, "These are all students studying at the Textile School. This year is their last academic year, so they are arranged to intern in your factory." Saying that, he introduced again, "These are the future shareholders and general manager of Nansha Textile Factory."

He introduced them one by one. Only then did Chen Lin know that these two girls, one was named Li Tang (Pear Sugar/Li Tang) and the other An Jiu (Safety Nine/An Jiu). There was also an older one named Li Guo (Pear Fruit). The only boy looked tall and sturdy, with a face full of transverse flesh, which was really rare locally.

The three girls studied textile engineering majors, while the boy was a mechanical major. The group formed by these four people was the future "Resident Support Group" of Nansha Textile Factory.

At this time, someone suddenly came over and whispered a few words in Li Shan's ear. Li Shan frowned: "There is still such a thing?" After speaking, his gaze fell on Chen Lin's face.

Chen Lin shivered with fright, thinking: *Is the matter of me being falsely accused of molesting women brought up again? Could it be that woman went to the police station?*

Li Shan didn't ask anything. After a simple introduction, he called An Jiu out. After a while, he also called Li Tang out. Even so, Chen Lin still felt uneasy.

After a long time, Li Shan reappeared. He said somewhat apologetically: "Delayed everyone quite a lot of time. It's getting late. Rest here for tonight; we will send you back tomorrow. Elder Zou and I will host a banquet to entertain you in a while. If everyone has any questions, you can speak freely at the table."

This was also proper etiquette. The visiting group immediately expressed agreement. Waiters brought tea and refreshments to them here. Several people walked all afternoon, stomachs feeling empty originally, so they tasted these Australian refreshments immediately.

Chen Lin had just put his heart down when Chen Xiaobing walked in from outside, saying the Chief invited him to go once.

"Invite me?"

"Yes, invite you to go there. Says he has words to ask you."

"Okay, I'm coming right now." Chen Lin thought *what must come cannot be avoided*. He had to brace himself and follow Chen Xiaobing out, coming to a small room nearby.

An Jiu and Li Tang, whom he met just now, were also there. Chen Lin was stunned; if it was that case, what did it have to do with the two of them?

"Chief..."

Li Shan nodded at him, asked him to sit down, and asked:

"The afternoon before yesterday, did you go to a silk and cloth shop named Ruihexiang in Bopu?"

*So it is this matter!* Chen Lin thought. He asked himself and found no fault in this matter, so he said immediately: "There was such a thing. I even bought fabric length there..."

"Later, someone came to this shop to cause trouble; was there such a thing?"

"Yes, yes." Chen Lin nodded repeatedly.

"Tell me about the situation."

Chen Lin immediately recounted the events of Advisor Xia coming to demand 'Fifth Mistress', arguing with the assistant, then beating the assistant, and Manager An calling the police one by one.

"...At that time, the police asked if I was willing to be a witness, and I said no problem."

"You are quite righteous." Li Shan laughed.

"Dare not, dare not. This matter was originally Advisor Xia making trouble out of nothing." Chen Lin said.

"So you don't know Manager An?"

"We met for the first time the day before yesterday, but we chatted very congenially." Chen Lin suddenly remembered something, "He even gave me a calling card." Saying that, he went to fumble at his waist.

"No need, we trust what you said." Li Shan was quite satisfied, "A nice young man!"

Chen Lin wondered *what play is this again?*

"Li Tang," he greeted one of the girls, "Organize what Comrade Chen Lin just said into a document and ask him to sign. Send it out by express mail early tomorrow morning."

"Okay."

He explained to Chen Lin again, saying he just received a summons from the Security Court, asking him to attend court to testify tomorrow.

"I think you definitely can't go back tomorrow, so I ask you to make a written testimony and mail it over; that will be it."

*So it's like this.* Chen Lin breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly said: "Many thanks for Chief's understanding."

"Thank me for what. Although this case is small, it doesn't concern you after all; being willing to come out to testify is already remarkable." Li Shan said and glanced at An Jiu, "Won't you thank this Young Brother Chen?"

"Thank you, Comrade Chen Lin." An Jiu bowed generously.

"Huh?" Chen Lin was confused, "This, thank me for what..."

Li Tang burst out laughing, and Li Shan laughed along. Li Tang laughed: "You are really a silly goose... An Jiu is Manager An's daughter."

"Ah, ah..." Chen Lin realized then, they both had the surname An, "So that's how it is!"

"Can't blame you for not thinking of it. Manager An rarely tells people about his daughter studying in the Textile School." Li Shan restrained his smile and said seriously: "But you guys were too outrageous this time. If caught on the spot, it would be a huge storm!"

"Didn't get caught, right?" Li Tang pursed her lips, "Even if caught by them, Chief, you would help us, right? After all, this is a good deed."

Chen Lin understood in a few moments that Advisor Xia coming to inquire about crimes was not speaking nonsense. These two little wenches in front of him indeed abducted someone else's concubine.

"Even a good deed can't be done like this. How did the school teach you? Doing things must be reasonable and legal." Li Shan sighed, "I have already greeted the police about this matter; consider it settled. Can't fool around in the future!"

"Chief, we were not fooling around..." Li Tang was obviously still unconvinced, "Fifth Aunt was tortured too miserably. She was controlled by the family and couldn't run away herself. If we didn't help her, she would have sought death sooner or later..."

"You guys just read books and feel you've grown capable!" Seeing Li Tang still being stubborn, Li Shan couldn't help getting angry, "You doing this is fine because this is Lingao! Under the Senate's rule! And you are students of the Senate! If you mess around like this outside, you won't even know how you got sold!"

Seeing the Chief angry, the two girls dared not speak anymore and lowered their heads. Chen Lin felt somewhat awkward. He vaguely felt that the relationship between this Li Tang and the Chief was unusual. It was somewhat inconvenient for him to stay longer. Just as he wanted to find an excuse to get up and leave, he suddenly heard Li Shan say: "Since she's saved, how do you plan to handle it?"

"This, we haven't thought it through either." An Jiu said somewhat ashamed, "Just thought of saving her first..."

Li Tang said: "I think since she's saved, the Senate can always give her a good home."

Li Shan laughed helplessly: "You guys really don't use your brains! She is a wealthy family's concubine in her thirties, been a concubine for fifteen or sixteen years, can't carry on shoulders or lift with hands, can't do labor, and passed the golden period of learning. You tell me, what to let her do?"

"Arrange for her to marry!" Li Tang said with great interest as if suddenly discovering something, "I heard many local cadres and workers don't have wives..."

"En, that is a good method." Li Shan nodded with a bitter smile, not knowing if it counted as praise.
