# Chapter 67 - Exercise Exercise

Chapter 67 Exercise Exercise

With the establishment of the Bailaren Base, the defense line of the Transmigrators was extended.

In order to test the defense capability, the Executive Committee decided to hold a large-scale military exercise.

"Red Army vs Blue Army." Xi Yazhou announced the exercise plan.

The Red Army was the main force of the PLA, responsible for defending the base.
The Blue Army was composed of the Special Operations Team and some militia, simulating the enemy's sneak attack.

"The exercise begins!"

"Enemy attack!" The siren sounded.

The Blue Army launched a fierce attack on the base from multiple directions.

They used camouflage to sneak close to the defense line, cut the barbed wire, and threw smoke grenades.

"Bang! Bang!" (Blank ammunition)

The Red Army reacted quickly. They relied on fortifications to fight back.

Machine guns swept across, blocking the Blue Army's charge route.
Mortars fired, suppressing the Blue Army's fire points.

However, the Blue Army was very cunning. They sent a small team to detour to the rear of the base and attempted to blow up the power station.

"Stop them!"

The reserve team of the Red Army arrived in time and engaged in close combat with the Blue Army small team.

"Kill!"

Both sides fought together (using rubber knives and bayonets).

In the end, the Red Army wiped out the Blue Army small team and successfully defended the power station.

The exercise ended. The Red Army won.

"Good job!" Xi Yazhou commented, "However, some problems were also exposed."

"For example, the coordination between units is not tacit enough, and the communication is not smooth enough."

"We must strengthen training and improve actual combat capabilities."

Through this exercise, the soldiers of the Transmigrators accumulated valuable combat experience. They became more confident and calm.

At the same time, this exercise also demonstrated the military strength of the Transmigrators to the surrounding forces.

Those gentry and bandits who were watching secretly were shocked by the "battle".

"Too scary! Their fire sticks (guns) can shoot continuously!"
"Their cannons can hit so far!"

They completely dispelled the idea of confrontation and chose to submit or wait and see.
