# Chapter 2606: An Imperfect Ending

Yuan Shuzhi's successful escape was a pleasant surprise for Lu Cheng. She had originally lost hope for Yuan Shuzhi, but unexpectedly, he not only ran out but also brought the approximate location of the farm estate.

Although Yuan Shuzhi only knew roughly how much time had passed when he was sent to and taken out of the farm estate and wasn't clear about the direction and path, he still remembered the general direction of his escape route last night.

Lu Cheng immediately dispatched a squadron of the Agricultural Reclamation backbone force and fast-squad bailiffs familiar with the local situation. Under his guidance, they first found the wild tea stall, and then tracked along the escape route. In less than half a day, they found the ruined temple. At this moment, it had been burned into ruins.

Clearing the ruins, they found more than ten charred corpses underneath. Obviously, these were the people who were dismissed by Steward Gao along with Yuan Shuzhi yesterday. After losing their vigilance, most people probably chose to spend the night in the ruined temple and were subsequently killed. As for those who chose to leave overnight, they likely lost their lives halfway.

Since the ruined temple was found, finding the farm estate was not difficult. The mountains seemed boundless, but actually, there were only a few passable roads, especially for sedan chairs.

After a search, the backbone squadron and the retained fast-squad bailiffs found the farm estate where Yuan Shuzhi had stayed that night. Naturally, the farm estate had long been empty, with only a few tenant families and more than ten house guards responsible for protecting the estate still there. Lu Cheng interrogated them on the spot. The tenants said that this was indeed Master Quan's farm estate and originally many people lived there, but starting from a few days ago, the people inside left one after another. As for where they went, the tenants naturally didn't know, only crying out their innocence, saying they were just honest tenants cultivating Master Quan's mountain fields and guarding the estate, having never done anything illegal.

As for the house guards, nothing substantial was asked out of them either. They only said that Steward Gao was the last to leave the estate, and when he left, he instructed them to "guard it strictly."

"How many days have they been gone?"

"The Daoist and the Master have been gone for three or four days. Steward Gao left yesterday."

Searching the estate naturally yielded nothing. Large amounts of paper ash were piled up in the kitchen and ash shed, obviously left by burning account books and similar material evidence. However, in the estate's warehouse, there were many drugs remaining, including a large amount of "Lushi Powder" and many "Australian drugs" in original packaging. After identification by members of the investigation team with medical backgrounds, most were antibiotics and painkillers.

In addition, they also found about ten thousand silver dollars and silver dollar coupons—after appraisal, they were all counterfeit. The silver dollars were cast with Zhuti silver, and the silver dollar coupons were modified from grain circulation coupons.

Although the harvest was bountiful, Lu Cheng was dissatisfied with such an outcome. Now, they clearly knew that the fake medicine group was colluding with the Huidaomen group and intended to rebel. But after working on the case for so long, they neither caught the mastermind nor obtained detailed relevant intelligence. This was really impossible to explain to the Senators.

She pondered for a long time at the farm estate, reading Yuan Shuzhi's report and the tenants' confessions back and forth several times. She felt that since Quan Youde and Daoist Wood Stone stayed here for a long time and asked Yuan Shuzhi to do accounts for more than a week, this place was obviously one of their important strongholds. Their silencing and burning of account books last night was a preventive action for retreat, but they definitely didn't expect Yuan Shuzhi to escape the silencing and immediately bring people to find this place. The large amount of drugs and counterfeit money left here showed that they hadn't formally abandoned this stronghold, but just took preventive measures.

But this place obviously couldn't be used as a "trap" to lure the enemy anymore. They must have realized the stronghold was unsafe, which was why they evacuated. There might be hidden sentries watching near the farm estate. The cracking of the farm estate could no longer be kept secret.

Even if it couldn't be used as a trap, there should be other important things left here.

Immediately, Lu Cheng instructed the National Army to conduct a broader search inside and outside the farm estate, "digging three feet into the ground" to see if there were any important things left.

This search indeed found other items. A large number of account books were found inside a double wall in a courtyard. After Yuan Shuzhi checked them, there were two sets of account books: one illegal set of daily records, and one set organized according to the "Australian bookkeeping method."

"I didn't write the account books, but I indeed organized them. They must have specially copied a set." Yuan Shuzhi gave an affirmative answer immediately after looking at them.

Where the original copies he organized went was self-evident; they must have been handed over to Stone Elder.

Besides that, there were preserved correspondences, basically all letters related to the fake medicine business, numbering fully over a thousand. Picking a few at random, one could tell that this fake medicine business wasn't limited to Guangdong and surrounding provinces, but also reached Nan Zhili and the Capital. In some places, the order price of Lushi Powder actually went as high as fifty taels of silver a bottle. Such huge profits were staggering.

The relevant reports were quickly transmitted to Guangzhou. Neither Zheng Mingjiang nor Wu Mu showed much happiness.

From the perspective of the case alone, the drug leakage case was considered solved. It was just that this "solving" wasn't perfect. Although the source was dug out, on the distributor side, the mastermind escaped. Moreover, Hao Long's side didn't find out anything about the hormone leakage either.

The identity of this mysterious Southeast Asian man was identified through the pharmaceutical factory's experimental archives: this person was indeed a slave imported by Quark Qiong from Southeast Asia—it was not known at the time that he was a eunuch. After arriving in Lingao, this person was assigned to work in a relevant labor brigade in Sanya. Later, he was recruited as a drug test subject. The condition for recruitment was to restore his free status after the experiment ended, allowing him to return to his country or settle and choose a job freely under the Senate's rule.

After the hormone experiment ended, according to the agreement, this person obtained the status of a free citizen. At first, the test center kept in touch with him, asking him to have regular physical examinations to check for sequelae of the drug, but about half a year later, the test center lost contact. He disappeared from his temporary residence.

Losing contact with test subjects after experiments ended wasn't a rare thing, so the test center didn't take it seriously, just simply marking and archiving it.

Where this person went after losing contact, how he obtained the testosterone gel, and whether he had any connection with the fake medicine case, all of this was currently completely unknown. It could only be considered a cold case. Hao Long stated that he would absolutely not give up and would definitely "investigate to the end." But Zheng Mingjiang was already somewhat discouraged.

As for Wu Mu, he was naturally dissatisfied too. From the clues currently mastered, the fake medicine case, the counterfeit currency case, and the "rebellion" of Liang Cunhou and others were all done by the same gang.

Although they had discovered more and more clues, they hadn't caught a single important figure. Not even Quan Youde, an agent selling fake medicine, was caught, which was inevitably disheartening.

From the current situation, whether stealing drugs to sell fake medicine or making counterfeit currency to distribute, the purpose was very clear: to obtain a large amount of money to support the future "riot."

Judging from the seized account books, the profit from fake medicine was shockingly high. Stone Elder, a man with such pursuits, surely wouldn't bury so much money underground waiting for it to be confiscated later, but spend it to "do big things." Like the counterfeit currency case, going to great lengths to create counterfeit currency wasn't simply to "disturb the economy" but to use counterfeit currency as "riot funds"!

Wu Mu shuddered at the thought of how big a wave would be set off by such a massive amount of wealth converging on one goal.

Just from Yuan Shuzhi's report, the gathered Huidaomen forces already numbered more than twenty thousand—this was certainly not all. Even the men controlled by Liang Cunhou's martial team might not be all there was.

Wu Mu knew this was different from Xiong Wencan's "indulging soldiers to become bandits" at the beginning of the mainland campaign. This was a rigorously organized and fully prepared riot, likely to erupt simultaneously in multiple places across the province. Once it erupted, the newly established grassroots organizations and cadres in various counties would inevitably suffer severe damage...

*We must clear up the case before the riot,* Wu Mu thought. *Strive to destroy them in the embryonic stage, wiping them out cleanly without leaving future trouble.*

With matters in Guangzhou temporarily concluded, Zheng Mingjiang had to rush back to Lingao to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the establishment of the Drug Administration Office. Just as the thalidomide incident in the old timeline, which caused blood and tears for tens of thousands of families, made the FDA grow from a small office into a huge federal agency, the drug administration work in this timeline was inevitably a thorny road full of blood and tears. Physical health and inner conscience were vulnerable in the face of greed.

Before Zheng Mingjiang left, Zheng Xiaoyu suddenly visited her, saying he came to "report on work."

As one of the heroes who cracked the case, Zheng Mingjiang naturally received him. She heard him say that his academic performance in senior primary school was good, but the financial pressure of raising younger siblings made him give up the chance to go to middle school and apply for the medical vocational class to start working early. Now he hoped to continue advanced studies in the medical field and hoped Chief Zheng could give him this opportunity.

After hearing this, Zheng Mingjiang expressed that he should go ahead and study, and if he had any financial difficulties, he could come directly to her.

Supporting naturalized students and cadres who aspired to study medicine and pharmacy was something Zheng Mingjiang had done countless times. However, to her surprise, this time Zheng Xiaoyu actually knelt down and kowtowed directly, stating that Zheng Mingjiang's kindness was like "rebirth parents" and hoping to take her as his mentor and become her disciple.

Zheng Mingjiang was stunned, so much so that she forgot to say the phrase "The Senate doesn't practice this."

This incident brought her a huge shock, so much so that she had an inexplicable feeling when she saw Zheng Xiaoyu at the opening ceremony of the new semester.

"Do you see that advanced student?" She specifically pointed out Zheng Xiaoyu, who was taking the oath, to Shi Niaoren. "I have a feeling that he will become a very outstanding person in the future. But where his excellence will take him, I really dare not conclude."
