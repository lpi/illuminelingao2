# Chapter 25: The Weapons Issue

"Choosing weapons depends first on our environment and the enemies we'll face." Xi Yazhou paused, perhaps organizing his thoughts. "We have three main opponents: Chinese armed forces whose mainstay is masses of simple firearms mixed with cold weapons—represented by the Ming army, including late-Ming bandits like Li Chuang, whose core troops are mostly defectors and deserters from Ming forces with essentially the same equipment and tactics; Manchu Qing armies whose mainstay is cavalry with some firearms; and Chinese and foreign pirates, heavily armed with various firearms, extremely active along China's coast.

"Not only are we few in number, but we're mostly people without combat experience. Psychologically, we may not be as tough as these ancients. So our weapons must adhere to two principles:

"First, sufficient range to engage and suppress the enemy's charge at the greatest possible distance, and to strike enemy artillery crews and commanders. During the Napoleonic Wars, 8- and 12-pounder field guns had effective ranges of only about 900 meters; seventeenth-century levels were even lower—perhaps 400 meters at most. Rifles should have at least that range.

"Our first two opponents both use cavalry as their striking force, so weapons must be capable of instantly projecting large amounts of ammunition to suppress cavalry charges. Machine guns would be ideal, but that seems impossible for now. From what I've heard, the North American Branch probably can't obtain machine guns or automatic rifles either."

"Then why doesn't the SKS qualify? It seems to meet all the criteria: 400-meter effective range, 10-round magazine, maximum rate of 40 rounds per minute. Performance isn't outstanding, but it's simple and almost everyone has handled one."

"I have no love for the M43 cartridge in 7.62×39." Xi Yazhou chuckled. "This rifle round uses corrosive primers, which corrode the barrel badly and require frequent cleaning. Hainan's environment is harsh to begin with; most people here have neither military experience nor knowledge of firearms. They'll probably rust their guns solid from not cleaning them. The guns will be scrap in no time."

"If someone can't even clean a gun, should they be a soldier? That's a flimsy argument."

Xi Yazhou ignored the objection. "Corrosive primers also corrode casings badly. This significantly affects cartridge reloading."

"That's worth considering. Reloading is our only way to replenish ammunition in the early period."

"Warsaw Pact weapons are designed with 'good enough' as the starting point. In other words, they could make weapons better, but cost is the priority. A durable weapon that consumes too many resources doesn't fit their military doctrine.

"In this timespace, that's fine—if a gun breaks, just replace it. But we have no way to replenish modern weapons, so we must consider full-service life."

"Are you saying the SKS has too short a lifespan?"

"Correct. Not just the SKS, but AK-type weapons too." He stretched his numb legs. "Also, the SKS is a standard semi-automatic rifle. *Standard* semi-automatic." Xi Yazhou emphasized the word. "That means it cannot become an automatic rifle."

The room went silent for a moment, then understanding dawned. Those who had dismissed his remarks now perked up.

Right—the U.S. civilian gun market had no automatic weapons, but those semi-automatic civilian AKs and ARs based on military automatic rifles could all be converted to full-auto. Of course, U.S. law strictly prohibited this—a serious felony. But the FBI had no jurisdiction in the Ming!

AK-47, M-16—these all-too-familiar names immediately filled the conference room. Everyone fantasized about wielding an AK or M16.

"Then let's bulk-buy civilian AKs!" Shi Niaoren grew excited. "Plenty came on the market after 2004. Our machining capability is good enough for conversion."

"Why AK? I want an M16!"

"You don't know anything—that's called the AR-15."

"Convert it and it becomes an M16."

"Heh, I'll say it again: I don't like the M43 round." Xi Yazhou was satisfied with the effect of his speech. "Similarly, I don't recommend small-caliber rifles like the M16. It's not just stopping power—it's also about power at maximum range. Also, small-caliber rifle rounds have higher manufacturing requirements. I recommend semi-automatic rifles chambered in 7.62mm NATO: civilian versions of the M-14, FN-FAL, and similar. Once converted to automatic, the urgent need for machine guns is reduced."

"M-14? I hear the accuracy is excellent, but it's overpowered and heavy."

"Isn't this gun a bit complicated? American guns all seem to have complex structures and difficult maintenance."

The firearms debate continued for half an hour, leaving Shi Niaoren frustrated. Seeing no resolution, he proposed they talk directly with Xiao Rui online. After all, Xiao Rui knew the American gun market better and had seen more of the oddities in civilian firearms—unlike the mainland crowd, who only knew at most that the AR-15 was the semi-auto civilian version of the M16.

The result was that Xiao Rui proposed a different gun online: the Saiga-308 rifle, which no one had heard of. This was a Russian civilian semi-automatic rifle chambered in 7.62mm NATO.

An AK that could fire 5.56 wasn't unusual—even Norinco had exported Type 56 assault rifles in 5.56. But an AK-lineage semi-automatic using American full-power rifle cartridges was fairly rare.

The Saiga-308 was developed by the Izhevsk factory, the primary manufacturer of Kalashnikov firearms, specifically for international AK enthusiasts as a sporting and hunting rifle. Externally, it retained almost all AK features; internal parts were mostly from the AKM and AK-74. The muzzle used a flash suppressor designed specifically for the SVDS sniper rifle; side rails could mount various Soviet and Russian optical sights. The Saiga-308 had good accuracy: at 100 meters, 10-shot groups had a dispersion radius of only 40–45mm. Reliability was also higher than standard AKs. To address the excessive recoil of the 7.62mm NATO round, a special buffer pad was installed on the stock, working well enough that even first-time adult male shooters had no problems.

"This gun has good performance, adequate power, and long effective range. Empty weight is 3.6kg; standard magazine is 8 rounds, but 20-round magazines and high-capacity drums are available." Shi Niaoren relayed Xiao Rui's proposal. "The price is reasonable—$500 per unit; bulk purchases get discounts. You could also buy the M1A—the civilian M-14—but that's much more expensive, over $1,000 on the market."

"So Xiao Rui recommends the Saiga-308?"

"He didn't say that." Shi Niaoren was a shrewd professional. Weapon selection was a matter of state importance. Get it right and it was just a reasonable suggestion; get it wrong and any future problems were on you. Even if leadership could understand, the masses wouldn't. "It's just a suggestion for everyone. The final decision is up to the Executive Committee."

This kicked the ball back to the Committee. Everyone was discussing inconclusively. Compared to the amateur enthusiasts' passionate debate, the Athletics Group—except for Xi Yazhou—showed no interest whatsoever. In their view, the Type 56 semi was good enough; why drag in all this strange stuff?

"What about bolt-action rifles?" Director Wen remembered seeing a gun show during a U.S. trip—countless antique rifles of all types: Mauser, Springfield, Mosin-Nagant... everything. And very cheap. Such rifles with long bayonets, soldiers in black peaked caps and red-and-yellow wool uniforms advancing in lines—*that* would be impressive.

But he knew asking the transmigrators to do that was impossible, so he kept this little fancy to himself.

The 7.62 NATO vs. 7.62 Warsaw debate produced no resolution at this meeting. Six different proposals emerged:

1. SKS semi-automatic.
2. M1A (M-14) semi-automatic.
3. Saiga-308.
4. Civilian semi-auto versions of AK-47/74 or M16, for later conversion to full-auto. Whether AK or M16 had differing opinions.
5. A combination of one high-power long-range rifle and one intermediate-power or small-caliber rifle.
6. Bolt-action rifles.

Clearly every proposal had supporters, and every proposal had pros and cons. Just as the discussion was heading in an unfriendly direction, Wen Desi deftly redirected to personal self-defense weapons.

The Athletics Group had originally prepared daggers as the personal defense solution, but with the North American Branch as a golden finger, they could afford to be extravagant. Handguns were very mainstream in the American civilian market with many models to choose from. However, to simplify equipment and facilitate repair and parts interchange, they could only choose one type.

Using 9mm Parabellum was uncontroversial—it was the mainstream handgun cartridge. As for the pistol itself, most favored the M9—because it looked cool and was well-known; Brother Ma's dashing image was unforgettable for this generation. The M1911 also had supporters, though it was slightly heavy and didn't appeal to most petty bourgeoisie. PPK, S&W revolvers, and Glock all had fans.

For usability, lightness, and ease of maintenance, the Committee originally preferred the S&W 9mm revolver. It had all the disadvantages of revolvers: gas leakage, short range, limited ammunition, slow reloading. But from the Committee's view, this was for self-defense at twenty or thirty meters—outstanding performance wasn't needed; simplicity and durability were key.

The problem was the Athletics Group clearly disliked this weapon. The PLA had no tradition of using revolvers; everyone felt uncertain about them. And revolvers obviously weren't cool enough—they made most transmigrators think of the firepower-deficient Royal Hong Kong Police. The final compromise was that both the M9 and S&W M337 went on the procurement list.
