# Chapter 1672 - Senator Marriage and Inheritance Law (III)

**Section 9**

The group discussion on the "Senator Marriage and Inheritance Law" quickly descended into fierce bickering. Regarding appointing the eldest versus appointing the worthy, how to technically ensure inheritance met the Senator's own wishes while fully accommodating family development and the "Millennium Prosperity" of the Senate, all parties quoted classics and scriptures at length.

Ma Jia stood there in a daze. His group was remarkably close to the Great Library group, and ringing in his ears was Senator Cheng's voice: "concubine-mothers," "mistresses," "poisoning," "murder," "slander," "patricide," "Jingnan Campaign," "Fourth Prince," "Xuanwu Gate"... such words drifted over constantly. Over there was Wu Nanhai's high-pitched voice: "History proves that the Manchu Qing's secret storage system for heir designation is a very advanced inheritance system..." Ma Jia sighed with slight melancholy: he knew it would be like this. What everyone cared about most was actually their own DNA.

In the view of the legal professionals drafting this law, both the organizational structure and the inheritance law contained major hidden dangers—he wasn't worried about accusations of "dictatorship." In the eyes of the legal circle, the Senate's biggest problem was not "dictatorship" but the super-national premise of "Senator Sanctity."

As long as this binding spell existed, the Senate's system was destined to have hidden dangers. In his view, the Senate wasn't the worst political system, but it was one of them. Of course, "Senator Sanctity" was the political correctness of the Senate. This rule could only be modified slightly; it couldn't be denied from the root. Otherwise, his political future as the head of the legal sector would be finished. Although it wasn't finished yet, it was precarious—the ultimate abolition of the Arbitration Tribunal in the discussion of organizational structure seemed to foreshadow the unpopularity of their group.

"You hate law so much, yet don't you know that any country established for over a century has built a mature system and implemented the 'Rule of Law'!" Ma Jia secretly grumbled in his heart.

"Executive Ma, the Executive Committee group discussion is about to start..." An Xi appeared beside him, looking somewhat fearful. With the abolition of the Arbitration Tribunal, his position as Director of the Arbitration Tribunal Office would cease to exist. With his level and ability, being a judge in the Supreme Court was obviously not enough. The Supreme Court naturally needed administrative odd-jobbers, but the status would be far less than before...

The new Supreme Court would be far inferior to the original Arbitration Tribunal: even the staunchest proponents of separation of powers in the Senate wouldn't want an American version of the Supreme Court—where a few Senators could casually rule whether something was unconstitutional; that would be too undemocratic. So nine out of ten, it would be the TG (Communist Party) High Court model.

An Xi was like this; was he himself any different? Ma Jia looked up at the sky and sighed deeply: Those who know me say my heart is worried; those who don't know me ask what I seek.

The Executive Committee's group discussion had already begun. Sitting here, besides Executive Committee members, was Wang Luobin, who had returned from Sanya. After Ma Jia entered and greeted everyone, he looked at the gentlemen present. Except for Engineer Zhan frowning, everyone else was expressionless, or calm as a chrysanthemum, or smiling... Truly, each had a heart as dangerous as mountains and rivers, and a chest as deep as a city fortress. Power indeed trained people!

When he entered, Ma Qianzhu was speaking: "...I have no opinion on the inheritance law, as long as everyone thinks it's suitable—the premise is to ensure the stability of the Senate, especially the stability and unity among the next generation of Senators..."

Ma Jia sat down next to Wang Luobin. Wang Luobin had stayed in Sanya for a few years, engaging in construction and swimming for fitness every day, becoming a dark and robust hunk. Ma Jia knew he had just had his fourth child.

"Engineer Wang, what do you plan to do?" Ma Jia asked in a whisper.

"Me? Just let the eldest son inherit. Save worry and effort," Wang Luobin said. "Having a bunch of princes and princesses fighting for it is too annoying."

While the two were secretly having a small meeting, someone suddenly passed a small note from outside. Several people circulated it immediately: Senator You Laohu (Tiger You) and ten other Senators had just jointly proposed a motion requiring the immediate drafting and deliberation of the "Senator Retirement Regulations," explicitly demanding that Senators who reached the age of sixty, upon their own request, need not participate in specific work anymore but continue to enjoy all Senatorial treatment and power until death.

Si Kaide frowned: "Thinking of retiring already? It's too early, isn't it?"

"This is nothing..." Xiao Zishan laughed it off, "People always get old, haha... haha..."

Ma Jia glanced at everyone. Everyone knew what the proposal by You Laohu and others meant, but no one knew how to broach the subject.

Wen Desi smiled and said: "What retirement regulation? This is Xiang Zhuang performing sword dance (intent lies elsewhere). Some comrades are very dissatisfied with this inheritance law. Comrade Ma Jia."

Ma Jia nodded: "Chairman Wen, you are right. Actually, I myself am not very satisfied with this bill. But the clauses are not formulated based on my personal likes and dislikes; they also consider the public opinion of the Senate."

"I think this public opinion is unreliable," Wen Desi said. "Everyone knows what this clause is about in their hearts. I won't say much. Just to prevent a certain Senator's family from having four votes, people forget that there are other Senator families with three votes. First of all, this feels unfair. Besides, there are still a few unmarried female Senators in our Senate. Director, you have several coming and going at your place; this is the rhythm of having three votes immediately..."

"Chairman Wen, I must declare again here, I have a purely working relationship with Comrades Du Wen and Tang Tang..." Ma Qianzhu said.

"Any single male Senator, as long as he marries a female Senator, immediately becomes a double-vote family. This power is formidable—should we also issue a regulation prohibiting intermarriage between male and female Senators? Otherwise, it's unfair to other Senators who marry naturalized citizens! I have said many times that our Senate has a tendency to manage heaven, manage earth, and manage reproductive organs. People are fine Senators; you don't let them pass it to their own grandchildren but insist they adopt an unrelated stranger as an heir. Who can accept this? Little kids can have their own heirs, but old men and women are not allowed to have heirs; which country's crooked logic is this?"

"This issue was discussed in the past. The conclusion then was that elderly Senators already have children, so giving them another seat is inappropriate." Ma Jia explained, "When we formulated the inheritance law, Senators holding this view in the Senate were also the majority..."

"Comrade Ma Jia, I know the situation you speak of. But as a bill involving Senators' vital interests, shouldn't we provide more choices to Senators?"

"So this is a draft," Ma Jia said. "Senators can freely propose various views and amendments. Ultimately, it still has to be decided by vote. I can declare one point first: my colleagues in the Law Society and I do not approve of any discriminatory policies."

"The problem is, if elderly Senators are given free inheritance rights, is it unfair to other single Senators?"

"No, I think we still place too much weight on 'family' and forget that they are first and foremost Senators." Ma Qianzhu said, "We should talk less about 'family' and more about 'individual.' After all, as Senators, they are individuals. Every Senator strives for our great cause. Just because they are a member of a certain family to suspect and restrict them is very undesirable. Conversely, it will strengthen the 'clan' concept among Senators, which is undesirable."

Zhan Wuya also spoke: "Our old comrades still value traditional morality very much. They have played a good exemplary role in the Senate. Once this regulation comes out, let's not talk about female Senators—they don't have the capacity anymore. But male reproductive ability can be maintained until very old. People were originally content to live out their old age peacefully. If you do this, even if he himself has no such intention, the younger generation will probably try their best to instigate him to get a Life Secretary or something... Isn't this destroying people's families!"

Si Kaide also chimed in: "If one really uses their brain, there are plenty of ways to circumvent this regulation. Besides, adopting children is not good either; it effectively becomes a form of marriage alliance."

"Old comrades, let's not say much about Elders Ming and his wife," Ma Qianzhu said. "Even ordinary auntie Senators have done a lot for our great cause. Although they were all humble tasks—cooking, washing, and cleaning for everyone when everything was waiting to be rebuilt. Now many of our comrades don't trust the natives and suspect naturalized citizens, so the children are helped by them. Based on this alone, we shouldn't restrict their rights... People get old just hoping for descendants in the long run. I propose to modify the inheritance law draft to reassure people and also demonstrate the principle that all Senators are equal..."

No one present raised objections anymore. Ma Jia asked: "What about this Senator Retirement Regulation?"

"It can be added too. Retirement is also human nature. But this still depends on personal will. As long as they can exert residual heat, we won't enforce retirement." Wen Desi said, "Administrative positions can have a position age limit to avoid eighty or ninety-year-olds still serving as Executive Committee members. Let's not do the 'Long Live' stuff..."

The "Senator Marriage and Inheritance Law" was finally passed in a quite harmonious atmosphere. The inheritance of elderly Senators' seats removed blood restrictions; elderly Senators could adopt anyone as their heir for the seat and property. The only restriction was that the adopted child must take the inheriting Senator's original surname. As for whether Senator inheritance should be by primogeniture or merit, arguments continued without resolution, so it was finally decided that each family would decide for themselves. However, a "full black box" approach was adopted technically: both the inheritance mode selected by the Senator (primogeniture or merit) and the specific list of heirs were top-secret documents, kept by the Heraldry Court. After the Senator's death, the General Office, under the supervision of Senate representatives, would retrieve the document from the Heraldry Court and read the heir list publicly to complete the process. If there was no specific heir list, this group would select an heir according to the "inheritance principles" left in advance. As for the Senator Retirement Regulation, it was also passed in passing—everyone knew this was just a matter of attitude.
