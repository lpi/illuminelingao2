# Chapter 2295: Top Favorite Chang Qingyun

"What you said is right; then invite him here to remove fire." Liu Youwang patted belly pretending magnanimity, "I have a new selected little girl in this opera troupe, growing truly lovely; I just have large quantity as great person, letting him enjoy first is fine."

"Just getting a woman has what use," Jiang Yougong complained, "He didn't sleep few women in recent months either."

"Then want how?"

"Have to give him some benefits..." Jiang Yougong said.

Zhu Si recently actually hinted him many times; he knew this Sanheui matter, wanted to take some benefits out. Jiang Yougong however unwilling also had to show filial respect.

"Okay," Liu Youwang full heart unwilling, but also knew was matter of no method, resolutely said, "You say getting how much silver?"

"At least getting fifty taels."

"One hundred taels; this Battalion Commander Zhu’s appetite truly not small," Liu Youwang secretly heart aching, "I am not unwilling to give, but right now we lack exactly silver..."

These months wealth and goods rolling coming, these pair of life-risking brothers however worried. What got in camp were all supplies like grain, salt, cloth; weight big, also inconvenient to carry. Must turn into gold silver then worked. Jiang Yougong and Liu Youwang both were outsiders, didn't have this road; saying giving to "Corrupt Elements" inside camp to encash, truth to tell they didn't have this guts either.

"...You also know, these things now all piled in warehouse; silver only has dozens taels; you opening mouth is one hundred taels; giving all to him is not enough; can't give dozens *dan* rice right?"

Jiang Yougong pondered secretly; this indeed was a problem. He thought said: "Do you have usable people in hand?"

"Where I have people! Taking some retained yamen dog legs actually have, I also dare not provoke them."

"How about that Chang Qingyun? I see him is a very capable person..."

"Old Chang ah," Liu Youwang scratched scalp, "Speaking of which he is still a Juren; but he is also outsider, not local; afraid hasn't how big roads either."

"This is hard to say; this Chang Qingyun often goes to Wuzhou handling affairs, maybe has road. Moreover he is not retained, is just a captive. Through him safest—really having what problem, directly just..." Jiang Yougong made a beheading action.

"Then good, I ask him just is!"

"This matter must grasp tight," Jiang Yougong said, "Wait grain boat fleet comes, he will have no free time. Who knows what demon moth this brat wants to make!"

"Won't be; he and you anyhow were Court's robes comrades in past..."

"Robes comrades so what? Stabbing knife behind back is more agile." Jiang Yougong said resentfully; probably also suffered enough from original "Robes Comrades."

Liu Youwang called people calling Chang Qingyun over.

Chang Qingyun at this moment was watching several actors explaining plays teaching singing to selected young girls at back. These girls mostly were good family background; some were girls of official families. Now forced coming out learning opera, also having to serve people with color (sex); all were full heart unwilling. However in this camp Liu Youwang was Heavenly King Old Father; not willing to agree either seeking death, or being tortured to death; in short was a dead road. So mostly could only submit under obscene might.

Few people teaching opera, mostly were members of family troupes kept by officials in past; also had members of Jianghu troupes. They were also trembling with fear. Liu Youwang this baleful star wasn't good to serve. Don't say disobeying him; sometimes singing opera one line not fitting his wish, bafflingly would suffer a sound beating.

Only this Chang Qingyun, by Liu Youwang side like fish getting water. Therefore people of whole camp none not cursing him behind back "Not getting good death," thinking out this idea of making opera troupe.

But on bright surface, he was already number one favorite by Liu Youwang side now. Even those past retained personnel seeing him also had to bend waist bow back calling him one sound: "Mr. Chang."

Chang Qingyun looked like sitting idly aside listening opera enjoying, actually inside heart was calculating nervously. Passing own manipulation, right now camp already had momentum of civil anger boiling; as long as someone willing to come out raising arm a shout, inevitably could lift up great waves. Then cooperating outside men and horses’ attack, this Sanheui definitely would have big chaos.

Just at that time how to eradicate 3rd Squadron’s heads in one stroke, he still had no assurance.

Although set a strategy of poisoning in food, but Chang Qingyun himself also knew, poisoning not hard; hard was how to poison these people over at key moment; poisoning happened early, Xie Hair could send other people to replace, let alone having to investigate reason; if waiting until that day to move hand, Australians inevitably ordering whole army martial law around grain arrival time; also couldn't call them all to camp in name of watching opera.

Just thinking wildly, suddenly someone came calling him, saying Camp Manager Liu called him go.

Liu Youwang called him over he naturally dared not neglect; immediately arrived in yard he lived.

Liu Youwang exchanged conventional greetings with him for a few sentences; first asked matter of preparing small kitchen.

This matter originally was Chang Qingyun raising; hearing him ask up, hurriedly answered: "Cooks I all found well; some are official cooks in Governor-General Yamen, Administration Commissioner Yamen; some are famous cooks in Wuzhou local restaurants originally; all have a hand of good skill. Just..."

"Just what?"

"These few cooks having in our camp, that naturally need not say, Old Master one sentence matter! Just have so two are in Wuzhou..."

"Then what?"

"Those in camp, able to serve Old Master that is their fortune; happy not enough in time. But wanting those in city, then have to be same as hiring people, have to give wage, also have to have entering leaving plate."

"I thought what difficulty; hiring is fine. Retained people in this camp have one two hundred; more few of them also counts nothing. Wage well, just give according to outside market situation!"

"Yes, yes, also entering leaving waist plate."

"These all easy; you found well people, wanting how many pieces tell me one sound is fine," Liu Youwang said, "But these people you found, skill must pass pass; don't make same level as cooking squad in troops." Saying he then mentioned matter of encashing materials.

"...This matter do you have people can handle?"

Chang Qingyun secretly surprised; didn't expect this Liu Youwang surprisingly would give this matter to himself! But turning thought understood—this Wuzhou he person place unfamiliar; simply nowhere to find people. Self was a captive again; completely could pinch hold.

"People actually have." Chang Qingyun carefully said, "Just he behaving also cautious..."

"Alright alright, you don't drag text anymore. I don't care which road tortoise king eight egg you find, as long as can help me change these things into silver then okay—gold also fine, don't want copper coins." Liu Youwang said impatiently.

"Yes, yes, this Student definitely exert force." Chang Qingyun immediately made an appearance of reverence and fear, "Just don't know how many things, want to sell how much silver money?"

"Things all in back warehouse; at that time naturally will take you to see. Rough rice about three hundred some *dan*, also salt and cloth. You find a suitable place help me dispose," Saying he stared big a pair of bull eyes, revealing fierce light, "What price these things sell in market I am clear, you don't think deceiving me!"

"Student dare not!" Chang Qingyun put out terrified face, "Student in this Sanheui all have to rely on Great Ren, how dare do such seeking self dead road thing."

"Hahaha, you know is good!" Liu Youwang laughed loudly; thinking a Juren Old Master so respectful tame to self, heart very complacent; even happier than going up certain Magistrate family’s young miss last night—after all that little chick cried and wept all time, didn't have this Juren Old Master knowing interest.

"Old Chang, you indeed are a wonderful person." Liu Youwang patted his shoulder, "Handle this trip errand for me well; can't lack your benefit! Do you have what request? Want woman I also reward one to you! You sleeping alone, too deserted, probably can't endure either? I look you not counting old, don't say you already no good..."

Chang Qingyun really couldn't bear his this kind "Intimacy," but dared not disobey him certainly; only could dry laugh saying: "Old Master’s kindness Student accepts in heart. But right now Student since wants to do things for Old Master, some things not suitable too publicity, avoiding provoking people red eye..."

"En, you say is also. " Liu Youwang sat down carelessly, "Entering leaving waist plate I won't give to you separately; anyway you also have. These days you just go out often running for me, solve this matter for me as soon as possible!"

"Student comply with order," Chang Qingyun machine move (had an idea), remembered something, again said, "Student still has one matter to beg."

"You say."

"Still ask Old Master bestow another piece of waist plate—after finding people, people also want to inspect goods; can't rely on Student's one sentence empty mouth white word coming taking silver out..."

"This matter easy; you go to document desk, just say I said: give you another piece of waist plate."

Chang Qingyun thanked, just about to leave, Liu Youwang called him to stop again:

"How is that matter of preparing head face opera clothes you said last time? Can't always clear singing like this right?"

Costumes head faces and even musical instruments needed by opera troupe, naturally didn't have in camp. Musical instruments still okay to say; searching in Wuzhou city always could find a few Clear Tones Small Troupes; flute huqin gong drum guys roughly could cope. Only this opera clothes head face not easy to find—only opera troupe prepared.

Originally at big dock like Wuzhou always had a few opera troupe performing; government offices and big family homes also had several family troupes. However a war fire turmoil, these opera troupes all scattered partners. Guys scattered exhausted even more. Chang Qingyun ran several trips, didn't find complete set of Opera Chests; only got some scattered opera clothes head faces and musical instruments; no complete set stuff.

Without these opera troupe couldn't perform complete play; only could clear sing; at most acting a few fold plays. Liu Youwang did women much; naturally also hoped seeing a few proper operas to relieve boredom; conveniently growing face before others.

"This allow Student find again. Find again!" Chang Qingyun hurriedly said.

"That must be fast ah."

"Yes, yes, Student saves." Chang Qingyun perfunctorily on mouth, heart thinking this matter wanted to contact Yi Haoran as soon as possible!
