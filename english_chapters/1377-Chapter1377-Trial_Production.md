# Chapter 1377 - Trial Production

The boiler workers arrived that evening. Early the next morning, the chimney by the river was already billowing black smoke. Zhao Yingong didn't understand the technology, but he had been watching the trial operation of the boiler on site.

This wasn't the first trial operation. Last time, the people from the Mechanical Division had already come to debug it to an operable state, but a month had passed since then. Whether it could start up successfully on the first try remained to be tested.

Fortunately, apart from the boiler, the other things in this system were not complicated - nothing more than pipelines and water pumps. Except for some difficulties firing up the boiler, which took half a day of fiddling, the whole system ran without problems.

"Let's start trial production," Zhao Yingong said.

The first batch of trained female workers walked into the workshop timidly and sat down at their workstations. The workshop began to operate. During the entire trial run, only fifty machines were operated - this was also the maximum number of people Li Yao'er could personally attend to.

These female workers were all refugees selected from Cihui Hall, unmarried and childless women aged sixteen to twenty. The silk reeling work itself was very labor-intensive and required high concentration, making young women most suitable. During the Industrial Revolution in the old time and space, most silk reeling workers were child laborers aged ten to teen years, and their labor productivity was no worse than adults. Based on the consideration of protecting the health of young children and preventing them from aging prematurely and wasting manpower, the Planning Commission limited the working age of the filature to sixteen.

She planned to first concentrate her efforts on this batch of workers, and after their skills matured, use them as core workers to train new workers.

No one in the Council of Elders knew how to reel silk. Fortunately, the Jichang Long equipment was not high-tech. The silk reeling technique was no different from the traditional "pot-beating" method, so no special training was needed in this regard. Li Yao'er mainly trained them to use the foot-pedal machine and the hot and cold water taps.

The pot-beating work was not complicated. It was still cooking cocoons in boiling water. Then after the female worker found the silk end from the cocoon body, she would hook it onto a wooden silk reel, step on a small iron lever with her foot, and drive the axle of the reel to make it rotate and wind the silk into finished product.

Traditional silk reeling was entirely a sideline handicraft of farmers: cooking cocoons over charcoal fire and then reeling out the silk. After the raw silk was made, it was sold to silk hongs, which then twisted it into dry warp.

The production equipment and technology of Cihui Hall Filature were not only much better than ordinary farmers', but the processing methods were also more advanced than silk hongs. Multiple processing steps that originally required silk hongs to subcontract to many craftsmen were completed in one stop within the filature.

Although some minor malfunctions occurred on the first day of operation, the overall operation was passable - the workers had been trained beforehand and were not unfamiliar with using the machines. It was just that the overall coordination was still somewhat lacking. Some support and auxiliary work couldn't keep up in time. The quality of the silk produced was also not as good as Li Yao'er had imagined.

However, these were all caused by initial unfamiliarity. Li Yao'er felt the problem wasn't serious: with more practice, they would naturally become skilled. The urgent matter at hand was to establish the management system - this was her weak point.

She shared this concern with Zhao Yingong.

"We have the Great Library, and a whole bunch of people doing management..."

The management system was compiled by the Great Library on commission from the Planning Commission, covering all aspects of the entire enterprise's production and operation.

The workers in Cihui Hall, except for a few naturalized citizen workers transferred from Lingao to maintain equipment, were all indentured servants selected from refugees in Cihui Hall.

This wasn't because Zhao Yingong felt slave labor was more useful. But under the conditions at that time, it was completely unrealistic to hire urban poor or rural female workers to work. There weren't many cases of women leaving home to work in the first place. Unless they lived very close and could commute daily, families were even less willing to let them stay overnight elsewhere. Only using indentured servants who had absolutely no personal freedom was easier.

The main types of work at Cihui Hall Filature were: silk reeling, peeling cocoon skins, entering the bushel and tying water knots, distributing cocoons, and picking flowers and tightening threads. All of these used piece-rate compensation, except for distributing cocoons which was paid monthly wages. Since distributing cocoons required no skill, only physical strength, all women assigned to this type of work were rather clumsy but strong. All day long, they delivered cocoons to each female worker's silk reeling position as needed.

At the end of each day, the silk reeling female workers would take off their day's finished products and put them on the pot of the steam pipe, cover them well with a large oilcloth, and then they could go back to the refugee camp to rest. The factory's odd-job workers would then collect the silk and put it in the silk baking room to bake again, then pick flowers and tighten threads. After twisting the silk, it was then packaged - very exquisitely. Zhao Yingong decided to sell his raw silk as a premium product.

Besides these workers who directly handled raw silk, there were also more than thirty people including cocoon baking workers, foremen, silk twisting workers, patrol workers, odd-job workers, and machine maintenance workers. All of these people were paid according to the monthly salary system - regardless of which type of worker, all wages paid were in circulation notes. Since the vast majority of workers were indentured servants from the refugee camp, wages were extremely low - in Zhao Yingong's view, they were only symbolic. It was just that the food supply was three meals a day, and the quality and quantity were better than in the refugee camp. The key was that receiving compensation - even if low to a purely symbolic degree - was enough to stimulate workers' work enthusiasm. Zhao Yingong planned to also set up sales points in the refugee camp, additionally selling some food items, so that indentured servant workers could use their wages to buy more food for themselves or their families to improve their lives. Moreover, through artificially separating worker grades, setting wage levels, and additionally distributing bonuses, all could serve as effective stimuli. This was much stronger than simple slave labor.

The filature's working hours temporarily adopted two shifts with rotation. However, Zhao Yingong and Li Yao'er planned to change to three shifts after the number of workers increased - human resources were more abundant here than in Lingao, and wage and welfare expenditures were lower. There was no need to adopt a two-shift system. Moreover, the silk reeling workstation faced boiling water and steam for long periods, and the labor intensity was high, so people tired easily. With production involving boiling water and steam, fatigue production was prone to work-related accidents. Furthermore, Hangzhou Station had originally planned to use this place as a training base for silk industry workers. Increasing shifts was conducive to training more workers and stockpiling workers for future industrial expansion.

After a week of continuous operation, Li Yao'er evaluated the female workers' work efficiency: skilled operators could reel about one hundred grams of silk per day; those unfamiliar could produce eighty to ninety grams per day. This speed was still not satisfactory. According to the materials provided by the Great Library, skilled female workers on this kind of production equipment could produce over one hundred fifty grams of raw silk per day, while unskilled workers could also produce one hundred grams.

However, even so, the production efficiency was already astonishing. So much so that Zhao Yingong quickly discovered that if he couldn't quickly revolutionize the habit of silkworm farmers reeling their own silk to sell raw silk, his factory would fall into a situation of having no cocoons to reel in the future, only able to operate intermittently each year.

How did they change from selling raw silk to selling cocoons in the late Qing and early Republic period? It was simply the natural selection after filatures sprung up everywhere and raw silk had no market. Unfortunately, his filature was limited in scale, and the current situation didn't allow him to go all out. He was virtually surrounded by wolves, with everyone as his enemy.

"When will there ever be an Opium... no, a Raw Silk War?" Zhao Yingong reclined on the xiangfei couch and lit a cigar.

After the silkworm season ended, Jixian Village sank into a pall of gloom. This sorrow not only shrouded this place but also extended to all local silkworm-raising households, affecting even the sericulture regions of Jiaxing, Huzhou, Suzhou and other places beyond Hangzhou: upon hearing the news of the plummeting cocoon and silk prices in Hangzhou, silk hongs everywhere also simultaneously drove down purchase prices together. The silk and cocoon prices throughout all of Jiangnan plummeted. Making the silk hongs earn to their hearts' content. In contrast, large numbers of sericulture households went bankrupt because they couldn't repay their usurious loans.

The villagers of Jixian Village had not yet gone bankrupt - because Master Zhao was benevolent. Although every household in the village owed him debts at one percent monthly interest, they were temporarily not being pressed for repayment. This was much better than people in other villages who were pressed for debt repayment right after the silkworm season. Each household could at least temporarily not consider how to repay or flee from debts and put their energy into spring planting.

But temporarily not considering it didn't mean the debts were gone. The fact that the Wang Siniang family never mentioned this matter instead made every household feel uneasy.

In earlier years, as long as the weather cooperated, you had your own land, and no one in the family was sick or in trouble, by the end of the year after various expenses, you could always save a few coins, and repaying debts was hopeful. But in recent years, there had never been favorable weather for farming, and the taxes demanded by the yamen were heavy. Getting through the year safely was already extremely fortunate - where could one still talk about saving money to repay debts!

Shen Kaibao had said several times while idly chatting at the village entrance: Don't be fooled by Master Zhao not collecting debts now. When he does collect, he'll definitely be harsher than anyone - the villagers were still going to the Wang Siniang family to borrow rice and money every two or three days. They were simply seeking their own death.

"When the time comes, the land will be gone, the house will be gone, and the whole family will have to become servants for this Master Zhao!" Every time Old Man Shen said this, he would spit viciously on the ground to emphasize his point.

But seeing clearly didn't mean one could escape because of it. His family needed to farm, needed to eat. If they didn't borrow, where would the money come from? Now even wanting to sell the mulberry orchard for money was impossible - it had already been mortgaged to Master Cao. He knew the loans Master Zhao extended were sweet bait, but weren't the loans extended by other masters also bait? In the end, weren't they all eyeing his land? Who cared about the life or death of farming people!

He knew his family had already borrowed money and rice from the Wang Siniang family several times one after another. He just pretended not to know. His heart seemed to have hardened. It was already like this anyway. If they really couldn't make it, they might as well sell the house and land and the whole family go seek a livelihood near Songjiang - he heard they were building houses and repairing docks over there recently, needing quite a few laborers. Daqing and Sanqing were both young men. Although he was old, he could still do work. Perhaps selling labor could still earn a living.
