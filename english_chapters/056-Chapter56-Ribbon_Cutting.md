# Chapter 56 - Ribbon Cutting

Chapter 56 Ribbon Cutting

After a month of intense construction, the first phase of the Bopu Base project was finally completed.

In order to celebrate this milestone victory, the Executive Committee decided to hold a grand "Ribbon Cutting Ceremony".

On this day, the base was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and red flags fluttered.

All Transmigrators put on new uniforms and lined up on the playground.

Local villagers were also invited to watch the ceremony. They looked at everything in front of them with curiosity and awe.

Wen Desi, wearing a tunic suit, walked onto the rostrum with vigorous steps.

"Comrades! Fellow folks!"

His voice spread throughout the audience through the loudspeaker.

"Today is a great day! We have built a new home on this barren land with our own hands!"

"This is just the beginning! In the future, we will build more factories, schools, hospitals... We will let everyone live a good life!"

"Hurrah! Hurrah!" The crowd cheered.

Then, the ribbon cutting ceremony began.

Wen Desi and several local village elders cut the red ribbon together.

"Crack! Crack! Crack!" Firecrackers sounded in unison, and colorful scraps of paper flew.

The villagers were also infected by this festive atmosphere and applauded.

"These Australians are really capable!" An old village elder praised, "Following them, we will have good days."

After the ceremony, there was a grand banquet.

The Cooking Squad showed their skills and made a table of sumptuous dishes. Braised pork, sweet and sour fish, Mapo tofu... full of color, flavor and taste.

The Transmigrators and villagers sat together, drinking and eating meat, talking and laughing.

At this moment, there was no distinction between ancient and modern, no distinction between master and servant, only the joy of sharing.

"Come! Cheers to the new life!"

"Cheers!"

The crisp sound of clinking glasses echoed over Bopu Harbor for a long time.
