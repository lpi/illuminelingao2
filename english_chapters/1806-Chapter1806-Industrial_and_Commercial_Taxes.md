# Chapter 1806: Industrial and Commercial Taxes

There was even a problem where the collected tax revenue could not offset the cost of collection, leading some places to simply abolish commercial taxes and make up the shortfall by over-collecting land taxes. Although commercial taxes in Guangzhou had not been abolished, they were in a moribund state. Replacing them were local commercial taxes.

After the Japanese pirate raids were quelled, the Fujian and Guangdong Provincial Administration Commissions established Tax Bureaus independent of the original Ministry of Revenue commercial tax system. Tax stations were set up at bridges and ferry crossings, with rates determined locally. The revenue was used to pay for military provisions and local defense. Since this silver did not have to be turned over to the Ministry of Revenue, local government offices were quite keen on collecting it. However, even with this enthusiasm, Ai Zhixin found the levied amount negligible, hardly commensurate with the status of a commercially prosperous metropolis like Guangzhou. In particular, when he saw that a market town under Guangzhou Prefecture had a commercial tax revenue of only a paltry 170 taels, he knew the corruption within was extraordinarily large. Because that town paid 450 taels of silver annually to the Senate as "Reasonable Burden".

However, Ai Zhixin did not intend to use this as a breakthrough point for increasing tax revenue. Commercial taxes were essentially *lijin* (transit duties); although easy to collect and generating significant amounts, they hindered the circulation of goods. His sights were set on the store tax (*mentan shui*), property deed tax, and wine and vinegar tax.

The store tax was a commercial tax collected by the local government from permanent shops in market towns. Because ancient society lacked a perfect accounting system, and the government did not calculate the capital and profit of shops when taxing, it was basically a quota tax. As for whether the quota was high or low, it depended entirely on luck. Some highly profitable industries—such as pawnshops—paid a tax of only 45 taels a year, while small street-side shops might also have to pay a few taels of silver.

Guangzhou's store tax was collected by the guilds of various trades. Shops that had not formed guilds had their taxes collected by brookers designated by the government—it goes without saying how much trickery was involved in this.

Ai Zhixin looked at the total store tax revenue for the entire Guangzhou Prefecture and its two attached counties. It yielded about ten thousand taels annually—a decent figure, but far short of his expectations.

The real estate deed tax was levied at 3% of the sale or mortgage price. However, this tax had not been collected in many places for years, and the counties and prefectures under Qiongzhou Prefecture had no record of collecting it at all. Ai Zhixin discovered that Guangzhou Prefecture not only had been collecting it continuously, but the revenue was quite high. Nanhai and Panyu counties alone collected as much as 2,000 taels annually in deed tax. This was likely due to the commercial prosperity of the big city, where real estate prices were higher and transactions more frequent.

As for the wine and vinegar tax, this was a tax continued from the Song Dynasty by the Ming. The liquor and vinegar monopoly was a major revenue source for the government in the Song Dynasty. However, the Ming Dynasty's management level of industry and commerce was extremely low and could not effectively control the production and circulation of wine and vinegar, so this tax was basically nominal.

"The tax burden of the Great Ming is not too heavy, but too light," Ai Zhixin said at the Finance Work Conference in the Wudaokou New Area. "The potential has not been tapped remotely. Whatever bragging there is about the Great Ming's GDP, when it comes to the efficiency of fiscal exploitation, the Great Ming is a standard backward country. Let alone comparing it with European countries, in East Asia, it is not even as good as Japan."

In Ai Zhixin's view, the Ming government's tax collection generally suffered from the problem of extremely low efficiency. The losses in the collection process were huge, with serious embezzlement, skimming, and leakage. Although it was said that a large number of unpaid "runners" were conscripted to handle matters, the actual hidden personnel costs were astonishingly high.

It was not easy to build their own tax collection team, especially one that maintained efficiency while also ensuring rough "integrity"—even in the 21st century, in modern tax agencies with institutional guarantees and countless rules and internal control audit methods, there were still people from poor backgrounds who ended up driving BMWs and living in villas.

It was basically impossible to form a team that Ai Zhixin would find acceptable using the Senate's current education and administrative system. Furthermore, direct taxation had many problems: first, it consumed manpower. In the past, before the agricultural tax was abolished, the administrative personnel costs consumed in collecting agricultural tax often offset the tax revenue collected; second, it easily intensified social contradictions, as there were plenty of examples of taxes triggering conflicts and even riots in history, both Chinese and foreign. Finally, modern taxation is built on modern financial systems, while merchants of the Great Ming still used the four-pillar balancing method, and smaller shops simply kept a running account.

To implement the new tax law, the accounting system had to be changed. Merchants had to get used to not keeping cash overnight, and be forced to use bank instruments for transactions instead of direct cash... This was not something that could be achieved overnight. But collecting taxes was imminent.

If a simple method were adopted, it would be the "Reasonable Burden" they practiced in the past. That is, the Senate would propose a total "burden" amount, and then the taxpayers would hold a meeting to evaluate and report their own shares. This collection method had the least resistance. Now that the Federation of Industry and Commerce had been established in Guangzhou, adopting this method would easily yield results. But Ai Zhixin believed this was an expedient measure taken when they lacked political organization in the past.

If such a method were adopted, the various tax rates set by the tax agency would be meaningless. Because either the collected tax amount would be lower than the tax rate, directly conceding profits to the businesses; or it would be higher than the tax rate, turning the tax into an "apportionment," increasing the burden on taxpayers.

The biggest problem was: once such a practice was adopted, it would inevitably have to go through the Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade guilds, tantamount to letting these organizations handle taxation power, which could easily lead to unfair tax distribution and legalized tax evasion.

Ai Zhixin believed that although the shops in Guangzhou did not have a modern accounting system, most shops used the four-pillar balancing method, and their business conditions could be audited through account books. Moreover, in the Ming Dynasty, whether official or private, bookkeeping and accounting were basically done according to this accounting method. Many people understood it, and many ready-made "accountants" could be found for temporary use.

Using these characteristics, he decided to adopt the model of "self-reporting and payment, with heavy penalties for evasion." Businesses would report taxes themselves, and the tax department would periodically conduct random checks on the revenue and profit of various shops...

Ai Zhixin was flipping through the materials when several soldiers came in carrying dozens of hardcover notebooks. A clerk reported: "Chief, this is the 'Compilation of Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Households' that Chief Lin asked me to transfer to you—please sign for it."

These booklets were compiled by the City Government based on the list submitted by the Federation of Industry and Commerce and materials collected by the City Works Department—listing all "permanent shops with fixed storefronts," from great maritime merchants like Gao Ju down to corner grocery stores... everything was included. It listed in considerable detail the address, business scope, business status, owner's name, and employment situation of the shops. Apart from the materials accumulated by the City Works Department in the past, the collection of these materials relied entirely on a series of administrative works since entering the city: census registration, nailing house numbers, business registration... Without this early work, Ai Zhixin probably couldn't have played any new tricks other than relying on the Federation of Industry and Commerce to apportion "Reasonable Burden."

Ai Zhixin had already made a basic plan in his briefcase. Roughly speaking, he prepared to levy three major categories: property tax, circulation tax, and stamp duty.

The first category was property tax. The objects of taxation were agricultural land property, commercial land property, large residential land property, as well as commercial ships, industrial and mining related properties. Specifically, regarding tax types, he prepared to levy: real estate tax, urban land use tax, vehicle and vessel license tax, vehicle and vessel purchase tax, deed tax, inheritance tax, and slave tax.

The second was circulation tax. The reason for taxation was to maintain the order of the commodity market. Business tax was not divided into specific details; generally speaking, as long as business behavior occurred and business income was obtained, it was all included in the scope of taxation—naturally with certain exemption quotas and scopes. The most important of these was collecting from the circulation link of the newly established wholesale markets in Guangzhou.

The third was stamp duty. Deed replacement and contract transactions required the legal recognition and protection of the Senate. The objects of taxation included ship departure permits, land deeds, house deeds, business licenses, equity certificates—all kinds of certificates that needed the maintenance of the Senate's authority.

Finally, there were local administrative surcharges, levied on top of the circulation tax. Ai Zhixin discussed with Liu Xiang and decided to levy four items: city cleaning fee, local security fee, urban construction fee, and education fee. These four taxes would be used by the Guangzhou local government. The remaining tax types were all national taxes, with a portion returned based on the actual situation after collection.

Regarding customs duties, anchorage dues, and tonnage dues, since this area was not his responsibility, he had not made a plan for the time being. As for the salt and tobacco monopoly, he had no special ideas for now. Because according to the monopoly practices of the old timeline, a complete set of teams was required. He couldn't even perfect the tax agency now, so naturally, there was no talk of setting up a monopoly system. So he still adopted the method used in Lingao: a one-time tax payment at the wholesale source link, and then distribution by distributors. With regard to the monopoly on tobacco leaves and saltworks, this matter was complicated and required resources that he, as the Director of the Tax Bureau, could not command.

Ai Zhixin skimmed a few pages of the booklet and basically had an idea in his mind. At this moment, the City Government sent a messenger: Mayor Liu invited him to a meeting.

"What meeting?" Ai Zhixin had just entered the city and had a pile of things on his hands. He hadn't even warmed his seat before being called to a meeting. If it had nothing to do with fiscal and tax work, he would respectfully decline.

"It's a meeting regarding the rectification of the customs industry."

"Tell Mayor Liu that I have too many things on hand and won't be attending..." Ai Zhixin frowned and said. He thought to himself that this Liu Xiang was putting on the airs of an official now, trying to make up the numbers for a meeting.

"Mayor Liu said this meeting concerns you." Liu Xiang probably knew he wouldn't want to go and specifically instructed the messenger, "The tax issues of the customs industry in Guangzhou will be discussed at the rectification meeting..."

Ai Zhixin immediately changed his mind: "I'll go right away."
