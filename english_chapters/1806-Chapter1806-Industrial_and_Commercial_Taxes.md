# Chapter 1806 - Industrial and Commercial Taxes

There even arose problems where the tax collected couldn't cover the cost of collection. As a result, some localities simply abolished commercial tax collection altogether, making up the shortfall through overcharges on land tax. Guangzhou's commercial tax hadn't been abolished, but it was barely alive. In its place was the local commercial tax.

After the suppression of the Japanese pirates, the Fujian and Guangdong Provincial Administrations had established tax collection bureaus independent of the original Ministry of Revenue commercial tax system, setting up tax checkpoints at bridges and ferry crossings. Rates were set locally, and revenues funded military pay and local defense—since these funds didn't go to the Ministry of Revenue, local authorities were quite enthusiastic about collection. However, even with this enthusiasm, the collection volume struck Ai Zhixin as negligible—completely out of proportion to Guangzhou's status as a prosperous commercial metropolis. Particularly when he noted that one market town under Guangzhou Prefecture collected a mere 170 taels in commercial taxes annually, he knew the "creative accounting" involved was extraordinary—that very same town had been paying 450 taels in "Reasonable Burden" to the Council of Elders each year.

Nevertheless, Ai Zhixin had no intention of using this as the starting point for increasing tax revenue. Commercial tax was essentially a transit levy. Though convenient to collect and substantial in amount, it impeded the circulation of goods. His attention was focused instead on shop taxes, real estate contract taxes, and liquor-vinegar taxes.

Shop tax was a commercial levy collected by local governments from permanent shops in market towns. Since ancient society had no comprehensive accounting systems, and authorities didn't track shop capital or profits when levying taxes, this was essentially a flat-rate tax. Whether the rates were set high or low depended entirely on luck. Some highly profitable industries—such as pawnshops—paid a mere 45 taels annually, while small roadside shops might also pay several taels a year.

In Guangzhou, shop tax was collected by each trade's guild. Shops not organized into guilds had taxes handled by officially designated brokers—with all the "creativity" such arrangements implied going without saying.

Ai Zhixin examined the total shop tax revenue for the entire one-prefecture-two-county Guangzhou jurisdiction. Annual receipts came to roughly ten thousand-plus taels—a respectable figure, but far below his expectations.

Real estate contract tax was levied at 3% of the sale or lease price. However, in many localities this tax had gone uncollected for years; the subordinate prefectures and counties of Qiongzhou didn't even have collection records. Ai Zhixin discovered that Guangzhou Prefecture not only maintained continuous collection but earned quite substantial revenue from it—Nanhai and Panyu counties alone collected over 2,000 taels annually in contract taxes. This was likely due to the prosperity of the major city, with higher real estate prices and more frequent transactions.

As for liquor-vinegar tax, this was a Ming continuation of a Song dynasty levy. The liquor and vinegar monopoly had been a major government revenue source in the Song. However, the Ming's extremely low capacity for managing industry and commerce meant it couldn't effectively control liquor and vinegar production and distribution, so this tax existed in name only.

"The Great Ming's tax burden isn't too heavy—it's too light," Ai Zhixin had declared at a Wudaokou meeting on new-territory fiscal work. "The potential is far from fully exploited. And they boast about how impressive Ming GDP was—when it comes to fiscal extraction efficiency, the Ming was already a standard backward country. Never mind comparison with European nations; in East Asia it lagged even Japan."

In Ai Zhixin's view, Ming government tax collection universally suffered from extremely low efficiency. Collection processes involved enormous waste, with rampant leakage and loss. Though ostensibly using unpaid "yamen runners" to handle affairs, the actual hidden personnel costs were staggering.

Building his own tax collection force wouldn't be easy—especially since this force had to maintain efficiency while also achieving reasonable "integrity." Even in the 21st century, with institutional safeguards and countless regulations and internal audit mechanisms, modern tax agencies still had people rising from humble origins to drive BMWs and live in mansions.

Assembling a team that would satisfy Ai Zhixin using the Council of Elders' current educational and administrative systems was essentially impossible. Moreover, direct taxation presented numerous problems: first, the manpower consumption—before agricultural tax was abolished, the administrative costs of collection often offset the tax revenue itself; second, it easily inflamed social tensions, with tax-related conflicts and even riots being common throughout history worldwide; and finally, modern taxation was built on modern accounting systems, while Ming businesses still used the Four-Column accounting method—smaller shops often kept no more than a running ledger.

To implement new tax laws required reforming accounting systems, requiring merchants to stop holding cash overnight, forcing them to use bank instruments for transactions rather than direct cash... None of this could happen overnight. Yet tax collection was urgently needed.

The simple approach would be the "Reasonable Burden" system they had previously implemented—with the Council of Elders proposing a total "burden," then having taxpayers meet and discuss, each self-reporting their share. This collection method faced minimal resistance. Now that Guangzhou had established the General Chamber of Industry and Commerce, this approach would easily produce results. But Ai Zhixin considered this merely a convenience measure from when they lacked proper governmental organization.

If they adopted such an approach, the various tax rates the tax authority had established would become meaningless—either collections would fall below the rates, directly surrendering interests to commercial households, or exceed them, transforming taxation into "assessments" that increased taxpayer burdens.

The biggest problem was: once such methods were adopted, they would inevitably work through the General Chamber and the various trade guilds, effectively giving these organizations control over taxation powers. This would easily lead to unfair tax distribution and legal tax evasion.

Ai Zhixin believed that although Guangzhou's shops lacked modern accounting systems, most used the Four-Column clearing method and kept account books that could be audited. Moreover, whether officially or privately, Ming-era bookkeeping and calculation basically followed this accounting system. Many people understood it, and plenty of ready-made "accountants" could be temporarily utilized.

Leveraging these characteristics, he decided to adopt a "self-report, actual payment, light tax, heavy penalties" model. Commercial households would file their own tax returns, and the tax department would conduct periodic random inspections of shop revenues and profits...

As Ai Zhixin was reviewing materials, several soldiers carried in dozens of hardcover ledger books. A clerk reported: "Director, these are the 'Guangzhou Commercial Household Data Compilations' that Director Lin instructed me to transfer to you—please sign for receipt."

These books had been compiled by the municipal government from lists submitted by the General Chamber and materials collected by the City Engineering Department—listing every "permanent shop with a fixed storefront," from major maritime traders like Gao Ju down to grocery stalls in back alleys... every one included. They contained quite detailed listings of shop addresses, business scopes, operating conditions, shopkeeper names, and employment situations. Beyond the City Engineering Department's previously accumulated data, these materials had been gathered through the various administrative activities since entering the city: household registration, door numbering, commercial registration... Without this groundwork, Ai Zhixin would have had no option beyond using the General Chamber to apportion "Reasonable Burden."

Ai Zhixin's briefcase already contained a basic plan. Generally speaking, he intended to levy three major categories: property taxes, transaction taxes, and stamp duties.

The first category was property taxes, targeting agricultural land property, commercial land property, large residential property, as well as ships, mines, and related property. Specifically, he planned to collect: real estate tax, urban land use tax, vehicle and vessel license tax, vehicle and vessel purchase tax, contract tax, inheritance tax, and servant tax.

Second was transaction tax, justified as maintaining commercial market order. Business tax would not distinguish specific categories—generally speaking, any business activity generating operating revenue would fall within the taxable scope—naturally with certain exemption thresholds and ranges. Most importantly, this would be collected at the circulation stage from the newly established Guangzhou wholesale markets.

Third was stamp duty: land deed replacements and contract transactions required Council of Elders legal recognition and protection. Taxable items included vessel departure permits, land deed certificates, property deed certificates, business licenses, equity certificates—all certificates requiring the Council of Elders' authority to maintain.

Finally came local administrative surcharges, attached to the transaction tax collection stage. After discussion with Liu Xiang, Ai Zhixin decided to establish four items: urban sanitation fees, local security fees, urban construction fees, and education fees. These four taxes would be used by the Guangzhou local government. All other tax categories would be national taxes, with portions remitted based on actual circumstances.

As for customs duties, berthing fees, and tonnage taxes at the maritime customs—since these weren't his responsibility, he had made no plans for them yet. As for salt and tobacco monopolies, he temporarily had no particular ideas. The monopoly operations of the old timeline required an entire organizational apparatus; he couldn't even fully staff the tax authority yet, let alone a monopoly system. So they continued using the Lingao approach: one-time taxation at the wholesale source, then distribution by retailers. As for monopolizing tobacco leaves and salt fields—that was complicated, requiring resources beyond what he as tax bureau director could command.

Ai Zhixin scanned through a few pages of the ledgers and had a general sense of the situation. At that moment, a messenger arrived from the municipal government: Mayor Liu was requesting his presence at a meeting.

"What meeting?" Ai Zhixin had just entered the city. With matters piling up and his seat barely warm, he had to attend meetings. If it wasn't related to fiscal work, he would respectfully decline.

"It's a meeting about the sex trade rectification."

"Tell Mayor Liu I have too much on my hands and won't be attending..." Ai Zhixin frowned. He thought Liu Xiang must have developed official airs, padding meeting attendance for show.

"Mayor Liu said this meeting concerns you," the messenger reported—Liu Xiang had apparently anticipated his reluctance and specifically instructed the messenger. "The rectification meeting will discuss Guangzhou's vice tax issues..."

Ai Zhixin immediately changed his mind: "I'll be right there."
