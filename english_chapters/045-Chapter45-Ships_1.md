Chapter 45 Ships (1)

"Ships are our lifeline." At a navy meeting, Li Di (leader of the Navy Group) emphasized.

"We are on an island. Without ships, we are dead crabs trapped on the beach."

"Currently we have one Fengcheng cargo ship, four modified fishing boats, and several landing craft. This is far from enough."

"We need more ships! Bigger, faster, stronger warships!"

"But we can't build warships now." Wang Luobin spread his hands, "The shipyard hasn't been built yet, and there is no steel."

"Then buy!" Li Di said, "Buy from the Ming people, buy from the foreigners!"

"Ming people's ships are too backward. Junks are slow and have poor wind resistance." Someone retorted.

"We can modify them." Li Di said, "Install steam engines, install propellers, install cannons. Turn junks into gunboats!"

"This is a way." Wang Luobin nodded, "But the steam engine hasn't been produced yet."

"We can use sails first." Li Di pointed to the map, "Guangzhou, Macao, Fujian... These places have large shipyards. We can order ships there."

"I suggest ordering a batch of 'Guang boats' (Guangzhou ships) and 'Fu boats' (Fujian ships)." Li Di analyzed, "Guang boats are made of ironwood, sturdy and durable, suitable for ocean voyages. Fu boats have sharp bottoms and wide upper parts, flexible manipulation, suitable for coastal combat."

"Also, we can try to buy some Western sailing ships."

"Western sailing ships?"

"Yes. Galley ships, Galley galleons... These ships are fast and have strong firepower. They are the main force of the Western navies."

"But will foreigners sell them to us?"

"As long as we have money, they will sell anything." Li Di smiled confidently.

So, a ship purchasing plan was approved.

Xiao Zishan took a huge sum of money and went to Guangzhou and Macao again.

In Guangzhou, he ordered ten large Guang boats from a famous shipyard.
In Macao, he contacted the Portuguese and expressed his intention to buy ships.

The Portuguese were very vigilant against these "Australians" at first, but looking at the shining silver, their vigilance quickly melted.

"Welcome, welcome!" The Portuguese Governor greeted Xiao Zishan warmly, "What do you want to buy? Spices? Ivory? Or slaves?"

"I want to buy ships." Xiao Zishan pointed to the warships in the harbor, "Those."

The Governor was stunned: "Warships? These are non-sale items."

"Double the price."

"This... I need to ask the King for instructions."

"Triple."

"Deal!" The Governor slammed the table, "You can pick whichever you like!"

In this way, the Transmigrators bought two old Portuguese warships. although they were second-hand goods eliminated, they were still advanced weapons in the East Asian waters.

Xiao Zishan named them "Lingao" and "Bopu".

With these two warships, the Transmigrators' navy finally had a bit of confidence.

They drove the warships back to Bopu Harbor and conducted modification and training.

They installed more cannons on the ships and trained a group of navy soldiers.

"Target ahead, fire!"

"Boom! Boom!"

Shells exploded on the sea surface, splashing high water columns.

"Long live the Navy!" The soldiers cheered.
