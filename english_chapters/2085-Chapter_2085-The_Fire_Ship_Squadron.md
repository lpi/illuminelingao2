# Chapter 2085 - The Fire-Ship Squadron

Surrounding this massive vessel were inner-river gunboats converted from large and small landing craft. Though these converted gunboats were far less impressive than those on the drawing boards, the open rotating turrets mounting 30mm Hotchkiss five-barrel autocannons and 13mm "typewriters" were terrifying enough in this time and space.

Bringing up the rear were two 621-class paddlewheel tugboats converted into armed gunboats. One had an exposed gun platform amidships mounting a 130mm muzzle-loading rifled cannon; the other carried two 30mm Hotchkiss five-barrel autocannon turrets and four 13mm "typewriter" turrets.

One river gunboat, sixteen armed large landing craft, two armed tugboats—this was roughly two-thirds of the Western Detachment's strength.

Schneider periodically raised his binoculars to scan the river. Ahead of the *Zhujiang*, several large landing craft on reconnaissance duty bucked their way through the churning current. Antelope Gorge's entrance was a full 1,000 meters wide; once inside the canyon, the river gradually narrowed, with the tightest point only 300 meters across. In this constricted mountain valley, the river roared and surged. Even the *Zhujiang*, nearly three hundred tons, pitched violently.

Fortunately, these channels ran 48 to 75 meters deep. Not just the river gunboats with their 1.5-meter drafts—even a ten-thousand-ton battleship could enter without running aground.

Antelope Gorge was five kilometers long. For non-motorized vessels, upstream passage here meant hauling on towlines; spending a full day to get through was not unusual. But now the inland flotilla could transit in one hour.

For Schneider, the greatest danger wasn't so much the Ming naval forces as the armed large landing craft themselves: displacing only thirty tons, with relatively weak engines, they'd have poor maneuverability in the rapids and could easily be swept onto rocks or run aground. Just yesterday, one armed landing craft had lost control during the reconnaissance escort mission and struck a reef—three drowned, one missing.

That was the first casualty on the Pearl River Squadron's Western Detachment's record, and Schneider couldn't help feeling a loss of face. The Western Detachment commander's post was his first assignment after promotion to Lieutenant Commander in the Navy, and his first independent command of a regional detachment. This first time commanding a zone operation meant coordinating with the First Brigade's operations—and the First Brigade was commanded by an Elder.

Before, he had been merely a naval officer under Elder commanders. Even as a flotilla leader or captain of a 901-class warship, at operational conferences he could only listen to the Elders speak, offering his own "advice" only when asked.

This time was quite different. At the joint Army-Navy conference, Elder Zhu had spoken in an entirely consultative tone, not simply issuing orders. Despite the vast gap in their ranks, they were equals in the command hierarchy.

Such an opportunity to shine—who else but him! Amid his satisfaction, Schneider also felt the weight of responsibility. Winning battles was no longer remarkable for them; winning cleanly and decisively mattered more.

"Maintain speed," he ordered. "All ships stay alert!"

Intelligence indicated the Ming had assembled over a hundred requisitioned civilian vessels at the junction of Dading Gorge and Antelope Gorge, all loaded with firewood, tung oil, and gunpowder. If the Ming sent these fire-ships drifting downstream, it would indeed pose a serious threat to the detachment—the river was simply too narrow here.

"Two o'clock, movement on the towpath—Ming soldiers spotted!" At the lookout's report, Schneider raised his binoculars. Sure enough, on the narrow towpath threading through the mountainside, several Ming soldiers were staring in their direction. Suddenly, as if receiving an order, two of them turned and scrambled up the slope while one remained watching the river.

On the hilltop, a plume of black smoke shot skyward—a beacon fire warning Zhaoqing that the Australian warships had closed in.

"Sound battle stations! All ships prepare for combat!"

As urgent steam whistles shrieked, every man aboard *Zhujiang* rushed from the cabins to their posts. The entire fleet continued upstream at four knots' cruising speed.

Antelope Gorge was only five kilometers long; at the fleet's speed, about one hour to traverse. Once they entered Dading Gorge, the river widened and the current slowed—perfect conditions for the fleet to unleash maximum firepower.

The Ming forces dug in at Zhaoqing were now at a disadvantage. To resist the Fubo Army, they could only rely on Antelope Gorge—the most favorable ground of time and place!

Less than four kilometers away, at the mouth of Dading Gorge, Naval Patrol Lieutenant Cao Bajiao felt chills running down his spine. During his years in Zhaoqing, he had been a tyrant of the West River: he'd killed river pirates, robbed merchants, wiped out entire families. Neither the Naval Battalion commander nor even Xiong Wenchan himself bothered to pretend not to notice.

Only a few months ago, fighting over a woman at Zhaoqing's docks, he'd run headlong into the Australians and lost several dozen of his brothers. Cao Bajiao knew Australian firearms were fearsome—he just hadn't imagined they were *this* fearsome!

So his cousin had been telling the truth! Cao Bajiao thought of his kinsman Cao Xiangjiao, who had followed General He on the campaign against the Australians. After the defeat, he'd come back with tales that made the Australians sound like gods—Cao Bajiao had assumed his cousin was exaggerating to cover up his own failure in battle.

That clever cousin had found himself a new assignment after returning and transferred to Nanjing—the little bastard had sharp instincts! Cao Bajiao cursed inwardly.

And himself? Stuck commanding fire-ships, leading the vanguard to his death!

"Captain, the smoke signal's gone up on the hill," a bodyguard reported.

"I'm not blind!" Cao Bajiao snapped irritably.

"Commander Wu has sent someone to hurry us along..." the bodyguard reminded cautiously.

"One more word out of you and you're on the lead fire-ship!"

That shut the bodyguard up. Cao Bajiao surveyed the hundred-odd fire-ships before him—all civilian vessels forcibly requisitioned from the West River over the past month-plus, now piled high with dry kindling and gunpowder. Drift them downstream into that narrow gorge, and no matter how good the Australians' weapons, they couldn't possibly sink every oncoming fire-ship. Some would surely reach their targets and set something ablaze. Not a bad plan—credit to that legal secretary surnamed Chang; he wasn't a complete fool.

But even the best plan needed someone to execute it. And that thankless task had fallen squarely on Cao Bajiao—who else? He was one of the patrol lieutenants. As for the other lieutenant, his connections outranked Cao Bajiao's, so naturally *he* was "following behind in support" with the naval vessels.

"Support, my ass!" Cao Bajiao cursed again. The gorge currents ran deep and swift; even strong swimmers, once in the water, would be swept away and drowned. After lighting the fires and leaping overboard, swimming upstream through several *li* of rapids to reach the "support" ships was pure fantasy—besides, whether Lieutenant Huang would actually "support" him afterward was highly questionable. He and Huang had long been at odds, feuding over how to divide the "tribute" from boat operators and pirates.

If he jumped off his ship, Huang would probably be the first to shove him under with a pole. That would be considered "brotherhood."

These hundred-odd vessels were crewed mostly by water-fighters temporarily recruited from the Tanka boat-dwellers. The entire patrol's authorized strength was only 240 men—meaning most of the enlisted men didn't have to go aboard and die. But he, the patrol lieutenant, had to lead his handful of bodyguards into the jaws of death. This made Cao Bajiao particularly sour.

Just then, another messenger came running from headquarters, shouting: "Why haven't the fire-ships launched yet? The Admiral orders: any further delay, and you'll be beheaded on the spot!"

Stick your head out—get the knife. Pull it back—still get the knife. Needless to say, on the distant Kuixing Tower, Xiong Wenchan was watching this very spot. Though the arrogant soldiers and brutal officers didn't usually take the Governor seriously, with the great enemy at hand, he was still the court's envoy commanding two provinces' armies. Executing a petty patrol lieutenant was just a single word. Left with no choice, Cao Bajiao gave the order: "All ships weigh anchor! Launch!"

Over a hundred vessels of various sizes drifted with the current, slowly heading toward the gorge mouth. At first the current was gentle, but where the gorge narrowed, some ships began ramming together as the water pushed them toward the center.

Fortunately, most of the crews were Tanka folk who had lived their lives on the water—highly experienced at handling boats. They quickly brought the vessels under control and headed downstream together.

On Kuixing Tower, Xiong Wenchan lowered his Australian telescope and nodded slightly.

Though the fire-ship squadron had delayed, it had finally launched. This was an auspicious sign—morale could still be rallied. Between him and the Australian pirates, there might yet be a battle to fight.
