# Chapter 2199 - Li Sanjiu's Abacus

The squad quietly climbed up the small hillock. This place was less than thirty meters from the camp, able to overlook part of the camp. Zhen Huan hid behind a pile of thatch, raising his telescope to carefully observe the situation inside the camp.

Bonfires were burning one after another inside the camp. Yao people slept on the ground around the fire pits. Some dozed with weapons in arms by the fire pits—probably night watch personnel. On the periphery of the camp, there were armed Yao people guarding, looking relatively alert. There were also patrol teams holding torches patrolling along the edge of the bonfires.

How large the range of bonfires was roughly indicated how large the camp was. Zhen Huan quietly counted the bonfires inside the camp. Within the visual range of his telescope, there were about thirty bonfires. About fifteen or sixteen Yao people rested beside each bonfire. Thirty piles meant four hundred and fifty people.

"Quite a lot of people." A scout whispered.

"Too few." Zhen Huan shook his head. "According to the Intelligence Bureau, if Eight Row Yao draw one soldier from every three men, they can mobilize at least over a thousand people to fight. We need to find out if this is their main camp, or if there are other camps."

Zhen Huan took the reconnaissance team to walk a circle along the camp marked by bonfires, counting about fifty bonfires. That is to say, there were about seven hundred Yao people on Yanxi Mountain.

Plus the troops they stationed around Lianzhou to monitor city gates and roads, the estimate of over a thousand Yao armed men under Lianzhou City was roughly accurate.

"Let's go. We'll go check other locations."

Coming down from Yanxi Mountain, they went to several locations where Yao armed forces might be stationed along the Lianzhou city wall, discovering three or four places in succession. Just when they were about to end the reconnaissance, they were discovered by patrolling Yao people. Bursts of shouting ensued. A dozen crossbow arrows flew towards their direction with whooshing sounds.

"Don't panic. Keep bodies low and run slowly." Zhen Huan knew the other side had poor vision at night and dared not chase too far out of the bonfire circle. As long as his side didn't expose obvious signs of movement, they couldn't find the target and could only shoot blindly.

They moved towards the outside lightly using the cover of grass and trees. Sure enough, the enemy dared not pursue too far, only shouting beside the bonfires and shooting a few arrows from time to time.

Suddenly bugle sounds rang out in the camp. Zhen Huan knew this was them assembling large units preparing to start searching. He checked that his side had disengaged from the bonfire periphery by nearly 200 meters, then ordered: "Run fast!"

Several people straightened up and ran. The Yao people behind made a noise; a chaotic crowd all followed out. However, the Yao people's physical quality was not as strong as Zhen Huan and his men who were long experienced in battle; their physical strength and endurance were far inferior. It was hard to judge directions in the night. After a burst of noise, the reconnaissance team easily threw off the pursuing Yao people, ran back to the north of the city, found the hidden small boat, and rowed back to the opposite bank.

The Eight Row Yao camp on the North Mountain was in chaos; leaders of various routes were panic-stricken. Because no one expected the Australian troops would arrive so quickly! The Yao people's combat power was limited. Every riot took the opportunity of emptiness in troop strength of various prefectures and counties. Once the official army came to suppress in force, they could only retreat to deep mountains and deal with them relying on terrain.

The Australians attacked Guangdong; the Anti-Yao Colonel and troops of other places were all withdrawn, giving the Yao people a great opportunity to riot and go down the mountain to loot. According to the speculation of most leaders, the Australian main force far away in Zhaoqing and other places would take at least a month to reach Lianzhou—not to mention the dangerous roads along the way, just the bandits rising everywhere were enough for them to suffer. No one expected them to come so fast!

Li Sanjiu, the Palm Matter Head of Majian Yao, although slightly surprised by the Australians' speed, was not unexpected. Yesterday at noon, Majian Yao citizens guarding Longjin Gate and Jichuan Gate discovered this group of strange troops on the opposite bank: grey cloth military uniforms, no armor, all holding bird guns. Li Sanjiu knew it was Australian soldiers coming as soon as he heard it.

Different from most Yao people who stayed in big mountain gullies all their lives, Li Sanjiu was a person who had seen the world. Although he was a Yao person, he grew up in a *Lang* (Zhuang) stockade. Most *Lang* people in Guangdong were transferred from Guangxi by the Great Ming government to suppress Yao. These *Lang* stockades were often distributed along the periphery of Yao areas and traffic routes. *Lang* people sometimes acted alone and sometimes cooperated with government troops to launch clearing suppression against Yao areas. It was said that Li Sanjiu's father and mother died during a certain government troop stockade-breaking. The young Li Sanjiu was spared his life and brought back to the stockade.

Li Sanjiu mixed quite well among *Lang* people. At seventeen, because of his outstanding martial arts, he became a personal soldier under a *Lang* small Tusi (native chieftain). He followed the Tusi to fight many battles: went to Guangxi, went to Guizhou, and also went to the two Hu provinces (Hunan/Hubei). He was even sent to Guangzhou to handle errands.

After the Great Ming's rule in Guangdong collapsed, the troops of the Central Route Defense withdrew to Guangxi. Many *Lang* stockades also abandoned their stockades immediately to move back to Guangxi. Li Sanjiu didn't run with the Tusi—he knew he wasn't a *Lang* person and had no "roots" in Guangxi. So he took a few brothers to defect to Majian Yao.

With his background and resume, he was naturally a rare "talent" in Majian Yao. Before long he became the Palm Matter Head of Majian Row.

This Palm Matter Head was actually not an official position. Most Yao people internally basically still had a primitive social commune system. There was no distinction between nobles and commoners, nor fixed hereditary headmen or Tusi. Eight Row Yao internally practiced the Yao Elder system. The Tianchang Gong served as the head of the whole Yao Row for a one-year term; heads of various surnames in the Yao Row were called Headman Gong, acting as assistants to Tianchang Gong; Enlightened Reason Elders equivalent to deliberative elders; Palm Temple Gong and Incense Burning Gong responsible for religious sacrifices; Water Release Gong responsible for agriculture; and the Palm Matter Head temporarily set up during wartime responsible for leading clansmen to fight war. Yao Elders successfully performed their own duties, generally undertaken by elders with relatively high prestige in the clan, but not absolutely.

Li Sanjiu, who was just in his early thirties, was such an exception, acting as the representative figure of the young faction inside Eight Row Yao. Don't look at Li Sanjiu growing up in a *Lang* stockade and active as a government soldier after acting as an adult; he was knowledgeable and experienced in hundreds of battles, which made him brave and resourceful. Soon he gathered a group of restless young people inside Majian Yao, forming a very strong force, so much so that he gradually hollowed out the Tianchang Gong of Majian Row, becoming the de facto leader of Majian Row.

The Australians sending troops to beat Guangdong was a once-in-a-thousand-years good opportunity for Eight Row Yao. The Great Ming government cared about killing with Australians and would surely have no time to deal with them. And for Li Sanjiu, this was an excellent opportunity to realize his personal ambition—he had no interest in being a temporary Palm Matter Head. Even manipulating Majian Row behind scenes didn't have much meaning: how much population and wealth could one Yao Row have! His true ambition was to become a "local emperor" like the Tusi or Tu-Prefect he had seen when suppressing riots in Guizhou back then, enjoying various things, having majestic prestige, having the power of life and death over the subjects below, and even passing it to descendants for generations of riches and honor.

So when Eight Row Yao internally plotted a riot, Li Sanjiu expressed support very firmly. After the riot started, he was also the most active. Because he was rich in military talent, he soon usurped the actual command power of the Eight Row Yao riot team. He first sent people pretending to enter Lianshan City to sell mountain goods, breaking Lianshan City from inside and outside; colluded with Baimang Stockade's Yao able-bodied men, coercing Yonghua Township Yao people to break Yangshan City; non-stop looted Sanjiang Market, and besieged Lianzhou City.

Since ancient times, there was the situation of Hunan eating Guangdong salt. Lianzhou happened to be on the trade route of Hunan-Guangdong salt trade. Salt produced along the coast went up the river, disembarking at Lianzhou, then transshipped by land to the Huguang area. And goods going south from the two Hu provinces also had many transshipping in Lianzhou. So inside Lianzhou City there were many salt merchants and warehouses. Li Sanjiu deliberately put Lianzhou City at the last, even not blocking roads, just to let Lianzhou City trap more traveling merchants and wealth.

According to Li Sanjiu's calculation, the best result was naturally Lianzhou City surrendering to him. He would occupy the three cities of Lianyang without bloodshed, connecting the territory into one piece. Then he would hand a surrender letter to the Australians, expressing willingness to submit to "Great Song." Letting the newcoming Australians acknowledge this situation, he could take the opportunity to become a Native Subprefect, acting as the local emperor of Lianyang Three Cities for generations.

In his view this was quite possible. He knew a little about this Great Song of Australians coming from unknown places. Few people, few soldiers; they relied on nothing more than sturdy ships and sharp cannons. Sending an army on an expedition to Guangdong—the most essential place of Guangdong was Guangzhou Prefecture. Occupying there would mean endless glory and wealth. Why bore into mountain gullies to fight with these "people outside civilization"? Besides, outside of Guangzhou, there were still Great Ming troops in Guangxi, Hunan... and so on. Behind them, bandits were making chaos again. No matter how sturdy the ships and sharp the cannons of Great Song were, they needed many soldiers to fill in. So nine out of ten they would push the boat with the current and pinch their nose to acknowledge the account. As long as he managed these three places of Lianyang well, using this as a source of wealth, integrating Lianyang Yao people, condensing into a large group, then spending some more children and jade and silk to bribe the Hair thieves, it wouldn't be a problem to be a peaceful Native Subprefect for a dozen years. As for further later, no one could say clearly. Anyway, even if Great Ming fought back, they would have to acknowledge the account. Those Tusi in Guizhou had passed down for more than ten generations!

If Lianzhou refused to surrender, he would break the city with full force and loot greatly inside the city—those salt merchants were very fat. Occupying Lianzhou, he could also discuss conditions with Australians. If the discussion failed, he wouldn't modify, at most retreating back to the mountains with Lianzhou's war trophies.

Although Yao people lacked sieging equipment and weapons, there were few defenders in Lianzhou City, and even less stored grain—large numbers of commoners fled into the city. Now grain in the city was about to run out; commoners already had grain cut off, and people's hearts floated. As long as grain was cut off for a long time, the city would inevitably become chaotic without fighting.

As for himself, Li Sanjiu didn't worry. He had already looted and extorted a large amount of grain from surroundings, enough to support all men and horses for more than two months.

Now the Australians came with godly speed, somewhat disrupting his plan. This made Li Sanjiu have to reconsider his plan completely. He had dealt with the government and *Lang* people, only never with Australians. But since they called themselves Great Song, they were probably also descendants of Han people. Using the attitude dealing with Great Ming to deal with them would roughly not go wrong.
