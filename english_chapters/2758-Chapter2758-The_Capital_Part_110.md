# Chapter 2758: The Capital (Part 110)

"He is in the Capital; that is all." Liu Sha said, "Master Wang regards him as a gem and is most careful."

"Because he can foresee the future?"

"Yes. He secretly possesses a 'Heavenly Book.' Master Wang specially asked someone to steal it out and copy a volume, but it was all symbols that no one could understand."

Xu Ke was not surprised about foreseeing the future; this was a necessary skill for transmigrators. As for this "Heavenly Book," it was likely a chronicle of historical events written in code or something similar, used as a memo for this Daoist Furnace Stone.

Xu Ke asked many more questions revolving around this Zhou Lezhi, but what Liu Sha knew was limited. Especially regarding this person's current whereabouts, he could not provide useful intelligence. Xu Ke felt slightly disappointed.

He suppressed his urgent desire to catch Zhou Lezhi and continued to interrogate patiently.

The next focus was Liu Sha's activities in Guangdong. As "Daoist Wood-Stone," Liu Sha was very active in Guangdong, leaving his traces in many matters. However, no matter how many cases were solved back then, now that the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had finally caught this big fish, they naturally would not let him go.

Liu Sha did not hide anything either, recounting one by one his various activities in Guangdong, from the earliest Riot in Lingao incident to the recent Fake Medicine Case. Xu Ke was more moved the more he listened. The Riot in Lingao and the Witchcraft Case were one thing; he had read all the case files in detail back then. Only this Fake Medicine Case—the details had always been confusing. Now from Liu Sha, he roughly knew that this case was also handled by Zhou Lezhi single-handedly, and huge profits were made by trafficking "Kun medicine" and remanufacturing it.

Xu Ke listened with heart-stopping shock. He didn't expect there to be such a drama! This Zhou Lezhi was truly evil enough; he knew the loopholes of the Senate, this grassroots troupe, like the back of his hand. No wonder many people in the Senate always suspected that the Fake Medicine Case was manipulated by a Senator-level mole—they did it too professionally!

This Wang Yehao was historically just an ordinary high-ranking bureaucrat in the late Ming Dynasty. That he could unleash such great energy relied entirely on Zhou Lezhi's assistance. No wonder Liu Sha said he was "regarded as a gem."

He suddenly realized that he had also picked up a treasure. The things this Liu Sha could provide were far more than the kidnapping case. Especially the inside story of the Stone Elder group; it was simply a priceless treasure.

However, these old matters involved a wide range and were boundless to talk about. For the moment, his task was to clarify the organizational structure and personnel composition of the Stone Elder group, and at the same time figure out what exactly was going on with the discord between Eunuch Yang and his son, which both Min Zhanlian and Leng Ningyun had mentioned in their reports, so as to re-evaluate their cooperation value. If necessary, sanctions would also be imposed on them.

"What is the matter with the discord between Eunuch Yang and his son? Was Little Eunuch Yang involved in the kidnapping?"

"The father and son have been at odds for many days." Liu Sha immediately recounted the story of the discord between Eunuch Yang and his son. "This time, the information about Delong having one hundred thousand taels of silver was provided by him..."

"How did he know you were going to kidnap Leng Ningyun?"

"He didn't know. It's just that usually he is quite familiar with Eunuch Cao, and Eunuch Cao is a relative of Cao Sheng."

"Is Cao Sheng your friend again?"

"Yes, we often cooperate and do some business."

"Also business of 'inviting the God of Wealth'?"

Liu Sha chuckled and tacitly admitted deeply.

Little Eunuch Yang connected with Liu Sha through the line of Cao Sheng.

"Later, Eunuch Yang and Master Wang also established a relationship. So they began to interact openly and aboveboard. It's just that neither Master Wang nor Eunuch Yang knew that we had known each other long ago."

"Why did Master Wang establish a relationship with Eunuch Yang?" Xu Ke was quite puzzled. Although Eunuch Yang was a "person of real power" in the palace, he was not in a vital department, and his influence before the Emperor was also small.

"For the trafficking of Kun goods."

Because of his relationship with Leng Ningyun, Eunuch Yang could order large quantities of rare "Australian goods" directly from Lingao. Apart from using them for bribery, Eunuch Yang couldn't use these Australian goods himself, nor did he have channels to sell them.

"...Master Wang fancied this point, so he fawned on Eunuch Yang. Every month he could get Australian goods from Eunuch Yang. Selling them out meant earning big money..."

Xu Ke didn't know whether to laugh or cry. No wonder Leng Ningyun's business of "Australian Rare Goods" had been so good in recent years! He originally thought the consumption ability of the eunuch group in the palace was super strong, but expectedly the real big distributor was Stone Elder! For a moment, he felt this world was simply an absurd play.

"Master Wang saved quite a lot, right?"

"I am not clear about exactly how much he earned," Liu Sha sneered. "It has nothing to do with me anyway."

It seemed he didn't get much benefit. Xu Ke thought and deliberately said: "Presumably Yang Tianliang didn't get any benefit either."

"He has long been dissatisfied with this adoptive father. The big money is managed by Eunuch Yang. Without an errand, he can't get a single coin and can only make some extra income."

"Including 'inviting the God of Wealth' with you?"

"Yes."

To tell the truth, Xu Ke was still quite surprised by their cooperation in "inviting the God of Wealth." Not to mention someone like Liu Sha, who was inherently a *jianghu* hero and a hawk and dog kept by the Imperial Court, having no sense of right and wrong or honor. Although this Yang Tianliang was a eunuch, he was also an "official" with rank. Embezzlement and bribery were not rare, but conspiring to kidnap was somewhat shocking.

"Which Gods of Wealth did you invite?" Xu Ke's gossip heart rose.

"That's a lot." Liu Sha chuckled, "Could it be that Your Honor also wants to invite the God of Wealth?"

"Naturally. We even want to invite the Emperor, the biggest God of Wealth in the world."

"Presumably Sir also knows that the Capital has the most rich people. High officials and dignitaries, nobles and powerful eunuchs, giant merchants... countless. However, we can't afford to provoke most of these people. So the Gods of Wealth we invited were people with money but no power."

There were many such people in the Capital. For example, the warehouse keepers of the Ministry of Revenue's silver vault, the clerks of various yamen, the eunuchs guarding warehouses... Don't look at them as inconspicuous petty officials and lowly servants; the oil and water profits were huge. Especially for the warehouse keepers guarding various official warehouses in the Capital, openly stealing inventory materials to resell was already an open secret. The warehouse keepers of the fattest Ministry of Revenue silver vault had family properties of tens of thousands of taels.

"Ministry of Revenue warehouse keepers? The ones who stuff silver in their rectums?"

"So Sir also knows about this."

"I have heard of it for a long time."

But the God of Wealth invited by Liu Sha and Little Eunuch Yang was not the Ministry of Revenue warehouse keeper—because it was common knowledge that they were rich, and too many people inside and outside the Capital stared at them, so the warehouse keepers had a very strong awareness of prevention. Usually, they went on duty in groups and hired bodyguards for protection. At home, they were also heavily guarded and rarely went out a step.

Liu Sha and Little Eunuch Yang took a unique path, specializing in inviting eunuch Gods of Wealth.

Within the Imperial City of the Capital, there were also multiple warehouses. The most famous were the ten Royal Warehouses located at what was called Xishiku in the old spacetime. Named Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Chengyun, Guangying, Guanghui, Guangji, and Zangfa Warehouses. Each warehouse stored materials paid as tribute from various places, exclusively for Royal use.

The "Jia Warehouse" stored medicinal materials; the "Yi Warehouse" mainly stored various papers and padded jackets worn by soldiers; the "Bing Warehouse" stored raw silk floss and silk strings from the south and cotton from the north; the "Ding Warehouse" stored raw lacquer, tung oil, white hemp, yellow wax, cowhide, deer skin, fish glue, raw and wrought iron, etc.; the "Wu Warehouse" mainly stored armor, bows, arrows, knives, and other weapons; the "Chengyun Warehouse" mainly stored yellow and white raw silk; the "Guangying Warehouse" mainly stored various colored plain cooked silks, Hangzhou gauze, and blue fine cotton cloth; the "Guanghui Warehouse" mainly stored colored woven handkerchiefs, combs, brushes, coin strings, yarn spindles, etc.; the "Guangji Warehouse" mainly stored gunpowder; the "Zangfa Warehouse" stored confiscated items.

Each of the ten warehouses was large in scale, with ridges connecting to beams. The stored goods were piled up like mountains and seas. Some warehouses had not been opened for many years, and the stored goods had rotted and deteriorated. Over the years, the inventory of materials had long become a confused account.

Naturally, such a state opened wide the door for theft by custodians. The warehouse managers, assistant managers, clerks, and warehouse keepers naturally would not give up such an opportunity to get rich. Eunuchs serving as managers and assistants engaged in reselling inventory materials on a large scale.

Eunuchs' greed for money far exceeded that of ordinary people. Being rootless and without descendants, they could only rely on money. Regardless of status, they all regarded accumulation as capability. Even ordinary eunuchs had to try to accumulate silver to provide for their old age after leaving the palace. Eunuchs serving as managers and assistants naturally would not give up such a great opportunity. Therefore, every term would earn a pot full to overflowing.

These eunuchs were mostly not powerful eunuchs, so kidnapping them didn't require worrying about someone investigating afterward.

Yang Tianliang spotted the "business opportunity" in this and specialized in providing intelligence to Liu Sha. Liu Sha then organized manpower to look for them according to the map/clues. One kidnapping was accurate every time, and they could get a lot of silver each time. The two split the profit "fifty-fifty."

This business went very smoothly, and they made tens of thousands of silver before and after.

"It's just that after inviting too many later, this gang of eunuchs also took precautions. This business was not done much..." Liu Sha said, "Little Eunuch Yang also said that doing this was not a long-term plan. He wanted to find a stepping stone for promotion. Otherwise, following his adoptive father like this, he couldn't see a future."

Yang Tianliang was already a man in his thirties. If he continued to muddle along like this, relying on his adoptive father's status in the palace, the possibility of becoming a manager or steward of the Twenty-Four Yamen was not high. The Emperor was still young, and there should be no accidents in being Emperor for another twenty years, which also meant that the eunuchs from the Prince of Xin's mansion would hold power for at least twenty years.

Even if a new Emperor ascended the throne in the future, people like Eunuch Yang and his son would have long become has-beens who could not be more outdated.

"...Never mind Eunuch Yang; he is a person half buried in the earth. Little Eunuch Yang still has half a lifetime to live."

To seek a way out, heavy bribes were needed.

"He sought many channels and spent a lot of silver. Finally, he got through the channel of Wang Zhixin, the Director of Ceremonial (*Sili Jian*) and Brush-holding Eunuch. This Eunuch Wang promised him that as long as he brought twenty thousand taels of silver, he would guarantee him a post as a supervisors in the Directorate of Imperial Horses (*Yumajian*), and after one term, guarantee him a post as a Grand Defender Eunuch (*Zhenshou Taijian*)."
