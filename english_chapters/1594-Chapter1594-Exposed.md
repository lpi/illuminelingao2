# Chapter 1594 - Exposed

"Attention, students of Fangcaodi Academy..." The voice continued to float over the square, "All units, by class, face the gymnasium gate. Assemble and line up from right to left. Students of each class, stand in formation by class and count off!"

As this order was conveyed, the scattered students in the square immediately ran toward the front of the gymnasium. The police also began to drive away ordinary naturalized citizens. A large open space was instantly cleared at the entrance of the gymnasium.

"Junior Primary Year One, Class One—" A student stood in position, raising one hand high and holding the other flat.

"Junior Primary Year One, Class Two!"

"Junior Primary Year One, Class Three!"

...

"Senior Primary Year One, Class Four!"

...

With the shouts rising one after another, students trotted all the way to their respective classes. In less than three minutes, more than ten queues of varying lengths had formed at the entrance of the gymnasium. Although the students coming to the gymnasium today were not organized by the school, and the monitors of each class had not arrived completely, they still quickly assembled and lined up according to the organization and command order of their daily formation training.

Zhou Zhongjun and Nan Wan'er didn't react at all at first and felt panic-stricken. Zhou Zhongjun reacted extremely quickly. Seeing students around her running toward the front of the gymnasium, she hurriedly called out and ran along. The several female disciples with them subconsciously followed.

"Why are you following!" Zhou Zhongjun said anxiously, "Quick, disperse!"

In this pause, the Detective Team and the Political Security Bureau agents who were on secret duty in the square had already noticed this group of "female students." A detective member signaled slightly, and five or six members and agents surrounded them. They immediately intercepted Zhou Zhongjun and the others.

"Political Security Bureau!" The leader showed his ID. "Show your IDs!"

Although the leader did not show his weapon, several people around him had already revealed their firearms. Five or six muskets of various lengths surrounded them.

"Didn't, didn't bring them!" Zhou Zhongjun cried out inwardly. Where would she get any ID? Seeing that she was about to be exposed, she secretly clasped the Emei dagger in her sleeve, feigning composure and retorted: "We came out to play today, why should we bring IDs?"

"Oh." The detective looked at the other people. "You don't have them either?"

Nan Wan'er and the others had to shake their heads.

"Are you all students of Fangcaodi?"

Zhou Zhongjun knew she must not panic at this time, so she bit the bullet and said: "Right! We are all from the Senior Primary section."

She had heard a few sentences just now and used them in her desperation.

The leader looked them up and down, his gaze lingering on Nan Wan'er for a long time, and then said very politely: "Fellow students, since you are students of Fangcaodi, you should have some basic knowledge." After speaking, he signaled for Zhou Zhongjun, who was leading, to step forward.

Zhou Zhongjun smiled sweetly at the officer, calmed her heart, secretly observed the surroundings, and prepared to strike at any time.

The leader took out a small booklet from his satchel, which read "National Education and Science Popularization Question Bank," flipped a few pages casually, and read clearly: "May I ask, what is three cubed? How do you interpret the Senate's governing concept of 'Sole Representation'?"

How would Zhou Zhongjun know these things? She secretly gritted her teeth and forced a smile: "I... I forgot..." Her fingers gripping the Emei dagger secretly exerted force.

The officer shouted: "Hands up! Put them behind your head! Kneel down!"

Zhou Zhongjun looked out of the corner of her eye. Several female warriors were already pointed at by a circle of black muzzles. Nan Wan'er raised her hands high and knelt down slowly.

Zhou Zhongjun had the heart to resist, but surrounded by firearms, she completely lost the initiative. Acting rashly would mean being blasted into scum. She clenched her teeth, unwilling in her heart. Thinking that she and her fellow apprentices had penetrated deep into this devil's den and were about to strike and achieve great fame and deeds, only to be seen through by the thieves so inexplicably... Unwillingness, regret, and annoyance mixed in her heart, and tears actually welled up.

"Quickly!" The leader didn't allow her to lament too much and roared, "Kneel down! Hands behind your head!"

Zhou Zhongjun had no choice but to put her hands behind her head. Just as she was about to kneel, a signal cannon shot suddenly sounded in the distance, followed by two more consecutive shots. Her heart leaped. *This is the signal to launch the attack! Could it be that Martial Uncle Miejing and the others have already started?*

The crowd nearby did indeed become restless. *There's a chance!* Just as she was about to jump up, there was instantly another crisp cracking sound. Zhou Zhongjun received a solid blow from a baton on her back, stumbled, and fell onto her knees.

"Kneel properly! Hands behind your head!" A black muzzle pointed at her head. The expected scene of attacks launching from all sides upon the signal cannon fire actually did not happen!

Zhou Zhongjun placed her hands behind her head with hatred. A man walked over with a swagger, running his hands down along her arms and ribs. She couldn't help but let out an "Ah" and her body trembled.

"Emei dagger!" The man pulled the weapon out of her sleeve and threw it on the ground, then fished out a dagger from her waist. Zhou Zhongjun bit her lip tightly and endured it. Unexpectedly, after finding the weapons, the man didn't finish. His two hands went all the way down, actually touching her hips. This kind of extraordinary shame and humiliation almost made Zhou Zhongjun faint.

After searching them one by one, they tied the group's hands firmly and linked them with a rope, escorting them out. During the process, neither the naturalized citizens nor the indigenous people just watched from a distance. No one came up to watch the excitement—watching excitement under the rule of the Senate was very dangerous. Especially watching the police handle a case; getting hit by a baton or eating pepper spray was light punishment, getting shot was possible if things went wrong.

At the intersection outside the stadium, more than ten male and female experts led by Abbess Miejing were on standby. They did not shave their hair or change their clothes like the others, but were all dressed as ordinary indigenous commoners.

Abbess Miejing was by the street at this moment. After sneaking out of the inn, she threw away her disguise and resumed her nun attire. Wearing a bamboo hat and monk robes, holding prayer beads and an alms bowl in her hands, she transformed into a nun begging along the street. Her sword was hidden in her walking stick.

The other ten or so fellow Taoists were also disguised and scattered on both sides of the street. They were ready to intercept and kill the bandit reinforcements once the incident occurred.

This place was not far from the gymnasium. She could hear the broadcast from the loudspeaker, but she didn't know the meaning of the broadcast. She just felt secretly surprised: *Who has such internal power to speak words out of thin air so loudly? Could there be a hidden master here?*

She was worried about Zhou Zhongjun and the other disciples in front of the gymnasium, very concerned about whether they could retreat safely after a strike—naturally, with her years of experience in the Jianghu, to carve a bloody path under the eyes of so many bandit soldiers and constables, many people would inevitably die.

Thinking of this, she couldn't help but feel anxious secretly. The strength of Mt. Heng itself was not great. In recent years, the world had been unstable. More and more tenant farmers under the sect ran away, rent collection became increasingly difficult, and various bandits and official bandits constantly harassed the local area. The economy became more difficult day by day. That was why she accepted Stone Old Man's summons to come to Lingao—they urgently needed a big backer in the imperial court while alleviating their financial plight.

This time, more than half of the sect's young and middle-aged disciples were dispatched. If the losses were too heavy and the sect's strength was greatly reduced, it would be hard to say whether they could maintain their current status in the martial arts world in the future...

Suddenly, the signal of the signal cannon came from the square. Miejing's heart shivered: *It started!*

However, after three signal cannon shots, another crisp explosion was heard. The gymnasium side did not become chaotic—if a fight had started over there, the square and the surrounding area would have fallen into chaos, and there would be crowds fleeing in all directions on the streets. But now there was nothing.

Although the crowd on the street looked a little panicked, there was no large-scale panic. Some shopkeepers stood at the door to look, and some people quickened their pace, but no one closed their shops or ran away.

"What's going on?" Miejing couldn't see the situation at the gymnasium, and there were no bandit reinforcements here either. For a moment, everyone didn't know what to do. Should they draw their swords immediately and rush out to create chaos to support Zhou Zhongjun and the others, or continue to wait here to intercept the bandit reinforcements?

Her own people opposite her exchanged glances with her several times, seemingly asking for intentions. Miejing frowned tightly and was thinking when someone suddenly greeted her from behind: "Old/Venerable Nun!"

Miejing looked back hurriedly, only to find it was a constable of the thieves. Her heart tightened, and she quickly put her palms together: "This poor nun pays her respects."

The constable looked Miejing up and down: "You nun, your face is unfamiliar. Are you new to the local area?"

Miejing quickly said: "Yes, this poor nun arrived here not long ago."

"Do you have an ordination certificate?"

"This poor nun does not..." Miejing's attitude was very calm. Ordination certificates were very rare in the Ming Dynasty. Thanks to Zhu Yuanzhang's extremely strict religious policy, most monks and nuns in the Ming Dynasty did not have ordination certificates. Even in the Mt. Heng Sect, there were very few nuns with ordination certificates. So saying no was not strange at all.

"Then do you have a local Religious Practitioner Registration Certificate?"

Miejing naturally didn't know what a "Religious Practitioner Registration Certificate" was. She thought this thief constable was just like his counterparts in the Ming Dynasty, looking for an excuse to extort money. She immediately smiled apologetically, "This poor nun is new here and doesn't know the local rules. I hope Brother Constable can make an exception..." As she spoke, she crumpled a few circulation notes in her hand and tried to stuff them into his hand.

"No, no," unexpectedly, the other party didn't buy it at all. "Without a registration certificate, you are begging illegally. Come with me to the police station!"

Miejing didn't expect this. In an instant, she couldn't judge whether there was really such a rule or if the other party had already seen through her and was finding an excuse to arrest her.

The few companions around were also overwhelmed for a moment. While they were hesitating, the policeman became impatient: "Let's go, let's go." Saying this, he was about to come up and pull Miejing.

Miejing understood instantly in her heart: *I am carrying a long sword and hidden weapons, which are standard 'lethal weapons'. There is absolutely no reason I can fool my way through once I enter the 'police station'.* She let out a long whistle, struck the policeman with a backhand palm, and the long sword in her walking stick was unsheathed.
