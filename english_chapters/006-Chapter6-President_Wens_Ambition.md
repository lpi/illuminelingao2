# Chapter 6 - President Wen's Ambition

Chapter 6 President Wen's Ambition

For a time, the people in the Gao residence were panicked. It was okay during the day, but once it was night, this warehouse became a place everyone avoided. In these days, the celestial phenomena were also strange. In the evening, thunder always rolled, but no rain was seen, and the sky often turned a weird purple. Master Gao also always had a bad face, and he was too lazy to visit even the most favored concubine on ordinary days.

Master Gao was not afraid of ghosts, but this warehouse in the backyard concerned his life and family property. The hundreds of merchants, big and small, on Haopan Street all made their fortune by trading with foreigners. Now he had turned the goods and silver obtained from the Portuguese last winter into raw silk, silk and satin, and porcelain that the Portuguese liked, and also prepared a lot of saltpeter and ironware that the imperial court explicitly prohibited from exporting. If there really was any mishap, wouldn't it cost him his life? Losing his life was a small matter, but half of his huge property belonged to Eunuch Yang in the palace. Although Eunuch Yang was not as prominent as the Nine Thousand Years, it was not difficult for him to wipe out his whole family.

This night the dogs were quite quiet and didn't bark anymore. Master Gao had a good sleep. Because he had been restless these days, he had been sleeping alone in the inner study. Just after the fifth watch, he got up. Served by the maids, he brushed his teeth with green salt and washed up. He was squinting his eyes to look at the half-bright and half-dark sky color, speculating how the weather would be, and whether he should go to the courtyard to have some fun...

A burst of wild dog barking came from the backyard again. Master Gao couldn't help being startled. The refreshing mood of waking up early was completely destroyed. He slammed the cup heavily and was about to call someone to inquire when he saw the head of his nursing home guards rushing straight into the courtyard, rolling and crawling. Master Gao's face changed greatly. This was the inner study, where male servants were not allowed to enter without summons. The head rushing in so exasperatedly, it was known without asking that something big had happened.

"Master, Master, warehouse yard... inside the yard... came... came..."

"What's the hurry, speak slowly." Master Gao had been trading with foreigners and smuggling for many years, and had long developed a state of mind of not being chaotic in the face of danger. He was only flustered for a moment and then calmed down.

"Backyard, backyard, three Japanese came!"

Hearing that there were three more Japanese in the backyard, although Master Gao didn't quite understand how these Japanese got in, as long as they were humans, it was easy to talk. So he breathed a sigh of relief and said: "A few Japanese scared you like this! Tie them up and lock them in the woodshed first." He waved his sleeve with extraordinary bearing, but his brain turned a few corners.

Could it be the people sent by Boss Wang on Youyu Island? Has a foreign ship anchored now? Gao Ju knew that the Portuguese had many Japanese servants, but now was not the time for ships to arrive. Besides, as his partner, Boss Wang wouldn't send a few Japanese over without greeting him in advance, let alone sneaking them into his backyard secretly.

"Master, these Japanese... are really strange!" The head hurriedly reported, "We subordinates dare not act rashly."

"Rice bucket! Waste!" Master Gao was furious, but felt a little afraid in his heart. Although he was a guest residing here from another province, he had heard a lot about the cruel nature of Japanese pirates plundering the coast in early years. The reason why Haopan Street was now enclosed in the city was also because Japanese pirates were rampant back then. These three people sneaked into his backyard unknowingly in the middle of the night, I'm afraid... Master Gao remembered hearing from maritime merchants who traded with Japan that there were some strange warriors in Japan who were used to invisibility and hiding tracks, killing people invisibly...

Thinking of this, he was terrified in his heart. The original idea of asking the family guards to catch them first faded away. He hurriedly asked: "Where are these three... people now?"

"We subordinates surrounded the backyard with bows, arrows and firelocks," the head glanced at Master Gao's face, "Looking at their appearance, it seems they have no malicious intent..."

"Bastard!" What are they doing running to his backyard without malicious intent? Are they here to buy soy sauce?
"Master, these people have no weapons. This is thrown to this subordinate by the one leading them." The head hurriedly handed over a small box from his bosom, "He also said a lot of words, this subordinate didn't understand very well."

Master Gao took the paper box half-believing and half-doubting, but was startled. This box felt extremely smooth in hand, as if coated with a layer of glaze, but the raw edge made him immediately discover that this was a paper box.

He thought in his heart: Indeed strange. He carefully opened the box, inside was a small oval flat box. The material was neither jade nor porcelain, also like that paper box as if having a layer of porcelain glaze. The color was an incomparably delicate pink never seen on porcelain. It felt very light in hand. Master Gao sold foreign goods all year round and was well-informed, but he couldn't tell what it was made of. It looked similar to the powder box used by women. He tried to lift it, and the lid opened readily like a shell. Seeing a bright patch inside, he looked intently and couldn't help but look like dead ash!
