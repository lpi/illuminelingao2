# Chapter 69 - Road Construction (2)

Chapter 69 Road Construction (2)

After changing the road construction plan, the overall progress was much faster. Wang Luobin also kept his word. Through the personnel database, the Executive Committee mobilized all people with experience in driving tractors, construction machinery and heavy trucks. Bai Yu, a former tanker who planned to modify tractors into tanks and agricultural vehicles into infantry fighting vehicles and become the father of the armored corps of the Time Travel Army, was once again subjected to indiscriminate conscription and enriched into the engineering team.

Mei Wan went to the front personally, patrolling the construction site, and incidentally teaching these new road construction workers some tool usage methods and earthwork operations - pitiful to say, most city otaku couldn't even handle shovels smoothly. Asking them to shovel soil, dig a ditch, or rake the ground flat, none could do it decently.

He taught for a while, and looked at the mechanical construction situation. Although the people driving construction machinery were not very skilled, they could do it more or less - fortunately, the Executive Committee arranged people to learn before the crossing.

Fortunately, there were construction machines. Mei Wan rejoiced secretly. Otherwise, it was hard to imagine what kind of work this group of so-called construction team members would do. Patrolling around, he suddenly saw someone working with style. He had been a project manager on construction sites for many years, and could tell a raw hand from a skilled hand at a glance. The young man looked sturdy, just a bit lazy in working, moving slowly. Mei Wan walked over and said:
"Doing not bad, been on construction sites?"

"Been there. I've done a lot of jobs." The young man rested, "You are Manager Mei, right?" Mei Wan used to be a project manager of an engineering team, so everyone called him that.

"Right, it's me. You know me?" Mei Wan was a bit surprised. He didn't know this person.

"Recognizing leaders as soon as possible is our basic ability as migrant workers," the young man laughed, "Seeing the leader coming, have to work hard quickly..."

Mei Wan laughed loudly, "What's your name?"

"Tan Ming. Everyone calls me Fat Ming." Tan Ming said and started working again, "I not only worked on construction sites, but also worked as security guard, oil worker, online game level grinder, printing worker..."

"How did a printing worker come here?"

"Didn't make a name for myself at this age. Now the economic situation is bad, and unemployed again. Thought anyway can't make a name, simply change a place to try."

Mei Wan turned around and returned to the tent. He was fairly satisfied with the overall progress. Construction captain Bing Feng turned into the tent and reported to him that the Cooking Squad just sent a 1-ton water tank of drinking water, and salt was also allocated.

"Still no safety helmets?" Mei Wan asked.

"Commissioner Wang said just now that people were sent to cut willow branches in the morning, and now they are trial-producing."

"Okay, not wearing them now is not a big problem. Not much hoisting work." He thought for a moment, "By the way, there is a guy named Tan Ming in the team. He worked on construction sites before and is very familiar with the work. You arrange him to be a team leader first, see how capable he is. If okay, train him to be a construction foreman later."

"Okay, I'll arrange it right away." Bing Feng was about to go out, but Mei Wan stopped him, "You should watch more on such things yourself in the future. Train suitable people. You are a structural engineer and a deputy leader. How can you always be a foreman on the construction site? Isn't it a waste."

Bing Feng was a bit confused, didn't understand the meaning of these words, responded randomly and went out.

Mei Wan lit a cigarette, his mind a bit chaotic. Logically, his mind should be on this highway, but the scene at the meeting yesterday kept reappearing in his mind. Didn't expect Zhuo Tianmin, this consistently low-profile person, to actually play this hand on the spot. This is trying to stand out. Mei Wan thought a bit bitterly: Zhuo Tianmin's architect and consultant qualification certificates probably aroused great interest from the Executive Committee...

For a time, he felt surrounded by crisis. Originally, he was very satisfied with this team of the Construction Engineering Group. Bing Feng, the deputy leader, was a structural engineer, with a relatively narrow profession; Little Yan was a jack of all trades, broad but not specialized; Li Xiaolü although had a high professional level, was a woman, and looked uninterested in everything.

But now it's different. Although he considered himself to have rich experience in the management and coordination of civil engineering, in terms of professional standards, he was obviously not this man's opponent.

While thinking wildly, the walkie-talkie reported that the roadbed work of 3 kilometers in Section 1 had been completed, and the road surface paving team was about to enter the site. But the road surface material hadn't been determined yet. Mei Wan put a notebook in his pocket, picked up a small shovel, and went out of the tent. Along the ditch for borrowing soil, he constantly shoveled up a shovel of soil, looked with his eyes, and pinched and rubbed with his hands. Then he noted something in the small notebook. He walked meter by meter like this. Making Yan Quezhi, who was measuring the hydrological data of the Wenlan River, baffled.

"Manager Mei, what are you looking for?"

"Looking at soil quality." Mei Wan crumbled the soil in his hand casually, "Looking for soil suitable for paving road surface."

"Can't use so much soil dug out? Wasn't the roadbed filled like this?"

"Soil requirements for roadbed are simpler than road surface." Mei Wan explained that soil can be divided into clay, sandy soil and silty soil according to particle size. Soil in nature is generally a mixture of the three. According to different contents, it can be subdivided into nine types, each having different characteristics for building road surfaces. Some are very suitable, some are completely unusable, and some need modification treatment.

"Simple highway is dirt road surface. Compared with common hardened road surface, it has many shortcomings, such as large amount of dust, small bearing capacity of road surface, softening of road surface in rainy days, forming puddles and mud..." He said, "So selecting and processing road surface soil is a very important link. If done well, such problems will be smaller and fewer."

"For example, this sandy soil. Here along the river, there is a lot of sandy soil." Saying this, he shoveled up a shovel of soil, "The characteristic of this soil is almost all sand grains, small cohesiveness, loose and unshaped when dry, and cannot be kneaded when wet. Using this soil to pave the road surface, it is easy to form deep ruts when driving in sunny and dry weather. In rainy days, it has weak cohesiveness. The advantage is that the road surface dries easily. It can only be used to pave the road surface after mixing with a certain amount of clay for modification."

"What about this kind?" Yan Quezhi was very interested in this question. Seeing different mud over there, he hurried to pinch a little over, "According to this statement, this mixture of clay and sandy soil is most suitable for paving roads."

"Theoretically it is so, but practically it is not that simple. Various soils being a little more or less have different characteristics." Mei Wan looked at the mud in his hand while talking, and rubbed it again. The mud became thin and short soil strips, "This kind you brought is fine sandy loam. It has both clay and relatively more fine sand, so it has some cohesiveness. This kind of soil is relatively suitable for building road surfaces."

"Then use this kind of soil?"

"The sandy loam I want to find," Mei Wan clapped his hands, "Is similar to this, but the sand grains should be coarser. If paving road with this soil, after compaction, it can maintain a certain density, not easy to loosen, less dust when driving, not sticking to wheels in rainy days, dries fast after rain, and easy to maintain the flatness of the road surface."

"How can that be seen? Sand is fine or coarse, can eyes tell?" Yan Quezhi looked at the mud in his hand for a long time.

"Can be seen if looked carefully." Mei Wan continued to guide him, "Simple identification method is to rub with hands. Like the fine sandy loam you gave me, can be rubbed into thin and short soil strips with hands, but sandy loam cannot be rubbed out."

"So it is." Yan Quezhi simply admired him prostrate at this moment, "Professional enough!"

"Hehe," Mei Wan laughed proudly, "Where where." Thinking in his heart that old textbooks are indeed very powerful.

Before long, Mei Wan and Yan Quezhi found a borrowing site for sandy loam. Of course, if such ideal material couldn't be found, Mei Wan could also do modification treatment according to soil conditions, but that would require an extra process and much greater labor intensity.

The paving work of the road surface was commanded by Mei Wan personally. Because the traffic volume on the simple highway was not large, there was no need to build a very thick road surface. A thickness of 15 cm with 2-3 times of compaction by road roller was basically completed. The middle of the road surface bulged slightly to facilitate drainage.

To improve the strength of the road surface, the engineering team mixed a part of pebbles into the road surface soil. Because suitable stones were limited, the effect could not be compared with real gravel road surfaces. In other words, it's best not to drive on rainy days.

"As soon as possible, as soon as possible, produce such a thing as soon as possible." Mei Wan looked at the completed road section, threw the cigarette butt on the ground, and stepped on it fiercely.

Just after the first watch, the courtyard of the county yamen appeared very quiet. Only two runners on duty carried small white paper lanterns, walking around the courtyard every once in a while, beating the watches with wooden clappers.

In the courtyard, more than ten militia were sitting or lying. If it were usual times, this important government office would not tolerate this group of muddy-legged barbarians being so presumptuous. But now the city defense was tight, and these more than ten militia had just fought with pirates yesterday, so the yamen runners turned a blind eye and didn't disturb them.

The one who brought the militia was Huang Shoutong, the head household of Namei Village. He was about fifty years old, with a burly figure and vigorous energy. His short beard was somewhat grizzled. His eyebrows were broad and forehead wide. His eyes opened and closed flashing like lightning. He was a big grain household in this county. His ancestors followed the conquest in the early years of the dynasty and settled in Lingao. Ancestors passed several Xiucai examinations and changed to civilian household registration, so the clan flourished. He was generous and righteous, having high prestige in the village and clan.

Lingao had always been harassed by pirates, and the local area was not peaceful. Since the Jiajing years when defending against Japanese pirates, his ancestors built earth stockades and trained militia in Namei Village. It was a famous "hard ground" in Lingao. In his generation, led by Namei Village, the neighboring six villages had a village pact for joint protection, able to dispatch five or six hundred militia at any time. In these years, the place was not peaceful. Every time troops were sent to suppress bandits or defend the county seat, Huang Shoutong brought militia to participate, contributing a lot, and was greatly praised by Wu Mingjin.

Huang Shoutong was a commoner, but had a son who was a Xiucai studying in the county school. This time when inviting gentry to the meeting, he arranged defense in various villages himself, only letting his son in the county school participate, and sent more than ten militia carrying a cart of grain, rice and vegetables into the city to assist in defense. Now this old man suddenly brought people to visit. Wu Mingjin felt both surprised and happy. After host and guest sat down in the flower hall and exchanged a few pleasantries, Wu Mingjin saw that this old man's hair net was changed to white, and his eyes were red. He was greatly surprised. He knew Huang Great Household's parents had both passed away. Could it be that his old wife also recently died of illness?
Seeing the magistrate full of surprise, Huang Shoutong told him: One of his sons died in action when attacking pirates yesterday.
