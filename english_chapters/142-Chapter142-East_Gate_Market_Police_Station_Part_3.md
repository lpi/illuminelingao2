# Chapter 142: East Gate Market Police Station (Part 3)

Before arriving, Zhou Shizhai thought these people, like Guangzhou's foreign merchants, just wanted protection for mansions and treasures.

But upon landing, he knew this was completely wrong. Bopu's giant ship, smooth roads, four-wheeled horseless carts... Unexpected things kept coming. Seeing Bairren Fortress's massive construction scale, he felt genuinely panicked for the first time.

Were they really just sea merchants? Zhou Shizhai now clearly understood: this place needed no escort to protect their property. Just the ships anchored in Bopu Harbor—what force in these waters could match?

So why summon him?

He and his two disciples were temporarily housed in East Gate Industrial-Commercial Bureau's small building. Rooms weren't large—even cramped. But comfortably furnished—though furniture was obviously cobbled together. He had one room; two disciples shared another. That evening, merchant leaders—one named Dongmen, one Dugu, plus a woman—hosted dinner. Food was simple but practical: fish, meat, vegetables. Leaders were courteous. Through conversation, he learned this was a newly-opened market; with increased traffic, things had gotten chaotic.

"—Though we've recruited some police, we understand nothing about Ming's underworld environment." Dongmen Chuiyu courteously offered a toast. "Please guide us, Master Zhou!"

"Will do my utmost!" Zhou Shizhai drained his cup. "Just—may I ask the masters—and, ah, the lady?"

Mu Min waved dismissively: "No 'masters' or 'ladies.' Just call us 'comrades.'"

"We're definitely not comrades! Get that straight!" Dugu jumped up.

"I meant 'comrade' in the original sense. Don't pollute it with garbage colonial culture!" Mu Min was righteously indignant.

Zhou Shizhai could see: this woman was clearly the local boss. Long overseas—even adopting barbarian ways. Slightly disdainful.

"May I ask, comrades," Zhou Shizhai said, "exactly what do you want this market to become?"

What style? Everyone exchanged glances. Obviously, the more prosperous and bustling the better.

Zhou Shizhai shook his head: "This market's masters are you sea merchants, right? I don't understand making markets prosperous—but once prosperous, various characters naturally come seeking shares. How do you plan to coexist?"

"How can others sleep soundly beside one's bed!" Dugu Qiuhun said decisively.

Zhou Shizhai was silent, then: "Comrades, East Gate Market is currently a wild market—few shops. Even attracting petty thieves isn't concerning. Once prosperous—various factions arriving all have major backers. Just street beggars will have connections reaching heaven. One misstep—your place gets turned upside-down..."

Mu Min smiled faintly: "Master Zhou, we understand all this. But our first advantage here: no entanglements. Nobody's 'our people.' Power flows from gun barrels. Whoever's connections—if they cause trouble—" She made a slashing gesture murderously.

Zhou Shizhai nodded: "Understood. Will serve with full effort!"

East Gate Market's merchants suddenly noticed: at the main crossroads, a screen wall was being built. Craftsmen chiseled something on one wall—this was the new *Treatment Regulations*. Basically combining *Public Security Management Punishment Regulations* with *Ming Code*—main difference: detention, paddling, exile all became labor reform, minimum one year. Labor reform needed no judicial process—station chief's document sufficed. Excellent for suppressing security crimes. Various departments welcomed this free labor policy. Some democrats questioned: punishment without trial violated judicial fairness. But fairness for natives clearly concerned few transmigrators.

Before the screen wall: three-tier semicircular platform—the public sentencing stage. Public trials and sentencing were proletarian dictatorship's most effective deterrence. This tradition could continue. Dugu Qiuhun eagerly wanted a guillotine at the crossroads—but death sentences belonged to state judicial authority. Transmigrators openly usurping court authority seemed premature. Besides, this was just a market.

Alongside the screen wall appeared strange-looking people: rattan helmets, short-hair-style black button-front stand-collar jackets, wooden buttons, wide leather belts, white puttees, straw sandals. Short horizontal-handled clubs at their rears. Sleeve patches with shield-shaped embroidery—incomprehensible patterns—only a few characters readable: top "Security," bottom "East Gate."

"Damn—these are exactly like Annam constables!" Dugu Qiuhun, seeing delivered uniforms and equipment, let out a despairing wail. His designed police uniform was handsome: peaked caps, black turndown-collar tunics, leather Sam Browne belts, riding breeches, boots, plus chest badges—somehow feeling familiar already.

"Commissioner Xiao—my submitted uniform design wasn't like this! How can such rustic looks intimidate criminals?" Dugu phoned Xiao Zishan.

"Didn't you just want police looking like SS? Unacceptable!"

"Pre-plagiarizing Hitler's ideas should be fine? It's 1628—Hitler's still atoms!"

"Riding boots, Sam Browne? In Hainan? Too wasteful. Resources are tight—economize. Red Guard members just wore armbands for revolution—never heard of needing full uniforms for fighting."

The hard faction suffered its first heavy blow. But other hard factions also seriously questioned Xiao Zishan's aesthetics.

The police squad's first East Gate appearance attracted massive crowds. Though nobody knew what "police" meant, commoners quickly guessed: short-hairs' "fast squad"! But these fast squads differed from yamen runners: first, uniform movements—regularly patrolling streets. East Gate Market wasn't large—you'd see them frequently. Second, broad jurisdiction—"street dogs" managing everything. Even littering, trade disputes slightly loud—they'd immediately intervene.

These ten police were the "uniform squad." Beyond them, Zhou Shizhai led his two disciples plus two to three recruited laborers as "plainclothes squad"—scattered daily, covertly monitoring situations.

Dongmen Chuiyu originally proposed merchant group defense—organizing shop assistants for night patrols. But here, traveling merchants dominated; settled shopkeepers were few. Only a handful of storefronts—couldn't organize anyone. However, traditional security methods were still applied.

Inns enforced guest registration. Daily, innkeepers reported to station—any suspicious circumstances.

Ma Peng's mother even contributed to East Gate security: as simplified group defense, she and several elderly laborer wives were assigned to set up stalls throughout the market as covert sentries. Welfare Society Li Mei's several clerks also joined this "group defense"—for extra grain. As Mu Min's mother-in-law, Li Mei enthusiastically supported this plan—expenses came from Welfare Society.

With everything in place, the 1628 Security Crackdown jointly conducted by Industrial-Commercial Bureau and Police Station officially commenced. Not just police squad and enforcement team—Military Group, Security Group, and Bairren Commune Militia all participated. First establishing perimeter blockades, then teams—based on plainclothes squad's prior reconnaissance—conducted large-scale dragnet arrests. Mu Min required: action fast and quiet, minimal disturbance to uninvolved persons.

From Industrial-Commercial Bureau's rooftop, a massive voice broadcast continuously in various dialects and Mandarin:

"Citizens listen: this market is arresting criminals. We won't release a single criminal; we won't wrongly arrest a single good person... Everyone remain in place... No resistance—violators shot without question..."

Squads wearing Year-One rattan helmets, wielding Year-One batons or bayonet-mounted rifles—under loudspeaker's blaring—patrolled the market, arresting by name lists and photos. Those resisting or fleeing were beaten bloody. Several self-proclaimed agile fighters—after downing several police—were finally bayoneted to death. Arrestees were all bound with rope, forced to squat before station—no looking up, no talking. Newly minted police recruits happily strutted their authority over them.

Mainly arrested: various petty thieves—pickpockets, burglars, con men, fences. After brief public sentencing, all received one-year labor reform. Wu De led several armed soldiers marching them away—Bairren Beach quarry needed convict labor.

Gambling severely impacted security—station first banned gambling. All East Gate gambling stalls were shut down, money confiscated, operators expelled. Before expulsion, per procedure: recorded confessions, fingerprints, signed guarantees, photographed with placards—creating case files.

"Come gambling again—won't be so cheap next time! Scram!" Dugu Qiuhun, one foot on a stool, snarled viciously. Operators were already terrified—camera flash made them think they'd been hexed.

Throughout, loudspeakers continuously broadcast *Notice on Rectifying East Gate Market Security Environment*: besides banned gambling, related small pawnshops and usury lenders were also ordered to leave. Those continuing faced severe punishment. Prostitutes must register at station within deadline—unregistered ones expelled...

Prostitution survived. Market prostitutes were mostly itinerant or nearby "half-door" (covert) types. Theft from clients occurred—but considering Lingao's extreme gender imbalance, this industry was tolerable. After discussion with Civil Affairs and Medical departments: prostitute licenses would be issued. All prostitutes must register for licenses. Unlicensed prostitution: first-offense expulsion; second-offense labor reform. Civil Affairs originally wanted monthly health checks by Medical—but Medical lacked personnel, equipment, and drugs. Temporarily not implemented.

The entire operation proceeded methodically—impressing Zhou Shizhai. These "Australian comrades" might not understand underworld—but their methods far exceeded yamen offices. Not just clean efficient action—everything prepared. Punishments balanced severity and leniency. Compared to dark, corrupt, cruel yamens—incomparable.

Such a small East Gate Market done this well—what if they governed all Lingao? All Guangzhou? Zhou Shizhai shook his head. Too absurd.
