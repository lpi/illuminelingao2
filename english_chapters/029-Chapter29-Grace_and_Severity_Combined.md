# Chapter 29 - Grace and Severity Combined

Chapter 29 Grace and Severity Combined

The remaining time of this day was very fulfilling for the four people who came. The banquet sent by Master Gao served "Big Four Pieces", twelve dishes.

The dishes were not quite the same as modern Cantonese cuisine, but won in natural ingredients and careful cooking, sweet, fresh, and rich. Especially a thick soup of Xishi tongue (clam), which made the few people nod repeatedly.

Bei Wei thought being a leader was good. Where could ordinary people enjoy such an opportunity for corruption in the Ming Dynasty? Just thinking, Gao Qing's wife Gao Xian brought the reheated main dish from the kitchen. It was a plate full of meat balls the size of pigeon eggs, immersed in shallow clear soup, tender and crystal clear, sprinkled with green chopped onions.

Wen Desi picked up a spoon first and sent one into his mouth. One bite, freshness filled the mouth, and the aftertaste also carried a slight numbness and spiciness of Sichuan pepper. President Wen was also a figure who mixed in social circles in this space-time. Although not a small banquet every three days and a big banquet every five days, his dining experience was one of the best among the Transmigrators. But he couldn't taste what this bite was made of. It felt like both chicken and aquatic products. He asked:
"What is this?"

"This is Land and Water Treasure." Gao Xian said softly, "It is made by mixing yellow catfish meat, large icefish, chicken, frog, and white shrimp. Does Master like it?"

"Good, really good taste."

"Hmm, indeed not bad."

"Landlords live a decadent life." Engineer Wang said with a face full of envy, obviously an expression of wanting to be decadent but unable to.

"Even making a meatball is so showy!" Bei Wei curled his lips.

"Almost every one of these dishes has Sichuan pepper, destroying the originally good taste a bit." Wen Desi shook his head, seeming to feel it a pity, "The ingredients are so fresh and purely natural..."

"This seems to be a cooking habit of the Ming Dynasty. In the export trade of spices from Southeast Asia, the Great Ming is also an important market."

"This entrepot trade can be done."

While talking, Gao Xian brought six small plates again, all some smoked and cured snacks, things to help with wine. She came over to heat the wine, but saw the jar of Jinhua wine sent with the banquet untouched. She hesitated and asked:

"Masters don't use wine?"

"No wine." Because they were afraid that drinking would mess things up, they didn't touch a drop of alcohol in the Ming Dynasty space-time.

"Since Masters don't want to use wine, how about the floral water distilled by this servant, mixed with water?"

"Floral water, toilet water (Hua Lu Shui)?" Everyone was stunned.

"Yes, all distilled by this servant. Currently only two kinds: rice leaf and perilla. If Masters don't dislike it, please try it first."

Bringing it out to look, it turned out to be essential oil liquid distilled from plant leaves and flowers. The distilled liquor technology in the Ming Dynasty was already mature. Besides making shochu, small distillation steamers were also an important use for making floral water.

Mixed with clear water to drink, it indeed had a unique fresh and elegant taste.

Xiao Zishan had doubts in his heart. This Gao Xian was obviously a tenant farmer's wife and a rough servant in the Gao family, but she knew how to make floral water and understood cooking recipes... He couldn't help but look carefully at this woman. He found that her movements and gestures had a certain style, unlike her husband who was clumsy.

Intending to investigate, he stopped her and asked: "Sister-in-law Gao, you have served in the mansion, right?"

But he saw Gao Xian tremble and whisper: "Yes, this servant has always been in the Gao residence..."

"No way, you were a rough servant in the Gao residence, how did you know the recipe of this Land and Water Treasure? And where did you learn to make floral water?"

Gao Xian became more flustered and stammered: "All... all taught by sisters... Master laughed at me..."

"How old are you?"

"This servant is thirty years old."

Xiao Zishan looked at her face, which although had become dark, still faintly showed the charm of her girlhood. Associating with Gao Colgate's appearance, and then thinking of the age difference between this couple, he understood eighty to ninety percent in his heart, but there was no need to expose it at this moment.

Pondering for a moment, he looked outside the hall. There was no one else. Gao Qing was probably working in the backyard. So he said:
"In these days, does Gao Qing often go to Master Gao?"

"..." Gao Xian was startled, but didn't speak. Xiao Zishan knew he was right: Master Gao must often ask Gao Qing for news about them.

"That Steward Yan also comes often, right." Xiao Zishan asked slowly.

"Never came... only occasionally..."

"Did he never come, or occasionally?!"

"Yes... came occasionally, just acquaintances moving around..." Gao Xian lied bravely. Under this wave of questioning, she was already panicked. Master Xiao's words implied that he knew everything, including her past. This, how is this possible? While hesitating, she saw Xiao Zishan's face gradually darken. Knowing it was bad, she knelt down in front of the table with a thump:

"This servant deserves to die, shouldn't have deceived Master..."

Bei Wei was once a revolutionary soldier under the red flag. How could he stand such things? Just about to speak, he was held back by Wen Desi. Although Xiao Zishan's questioning was sudden, it was also part of their plan to win hearts.

"He came quite a few times, right? I'm afraid he has also gone in to see the yard we live in."

"No, no." Gao Xian was so scared that her face changed color.

"He also promised you that if one day we go back to Australia, he will take you back to the Gao family, right?!"

Gao Xian trembled all over - Masters knew everything! She couldn't help but secretly resent her man for having no opinion. Every time he was coaxed and threatened by Steward Yan, he agreed to take him to search. Although nothing was found, this was the crime of betraying the master!
"This servant deserves to die, it's all because this servant's man is bad..." Frightened by Xiao Zishan's words, Gao Xian prostrated on the ground to plead guilty, and told everything about Steward Yan's coming and what he said during their absence.

"This servant's man has soft ears and a live heart, mistakenly listening to other's nonsense," Gao Xian spoke with a crying tone, "Beg Master to spare him from family law considering his old age and leg ailment. This servant is willing to suffer double compensation."

Everyone heard it and it was not much different from the prior estimation. Seeing her begging bitterly for her husband, they couldn't help feeling compassionate inside. Not arriving in the old society, one really doesn't know the sweetness of the new society.

Xiao Zishan intentionally waited for a long time before deliberately sighing deeply:
"Sister-in-law Gao, since your whole family was assigned to our name, have we done anything sorry to you?"

"Killing this servant. Masters' benevolence, this servant's whole family is endlessly grateful."

"Your family didn't have enough food, we gave monthly rice. Children grew up and had no spending money, we gave monthly money. Not asking for gratitude and repayment. Only hoping to have a stable place to rest after traveling ten thousand miles here. But don't want to be seen clearly by people."

Gao Xian didn't answer, only kowtowed repeatedly while sobbing.

"Get up."

"This servant dare not. Please Master use family law heavily on this servant to enforce family rules."

Xiao Zishan thought this woman really had sets of words. It seemed she was indeed not an ordinary farmer's wife.

"No rules, no square circle. Although you and Gao Qing were wrong in this matter, we didn't set rules beforehand, so those who don't know are not guilty. Get up."

"Thank Master for grace." Gao Xian heard that Master's tone had changed, estimating that he wouldn't drive them away. She was not afraid of being beaten, but afraid of angering the master and being driven away. Even if Master Gao was willing to take them in, they wouldn't have good days in the future.

"Do you understand future matters?"

"Yes, this servant knows."

"I know you are not from a small family origin. You are much better than Gao Qing in seeing things and understanding reason. Teach him well in the future, know when to advance and retreat!"

"This servant knows, knows." Gao Xian nodded repeatedly.

"As long as you work diligently and serve the master loyally, whether we return to Australia in the future or not, we won't let you have no result. behave yourself."

"This servant thanks..." Gao Xian wanted to kneel down to thank again, but Xiao Zishan stopped her - the prestige of landlord master is better shown less in front of everyone, "Go call Gao Di."

When Gao Xian went out, Xiao Zishan turned his head and said to everyone: "How is my acting?" He was eager to reverse the atmosphere in the hall. He didn't want to leave an impression of domineering. Acting, yes, just acting.

Wen Desi opened his mouth wide: "Zishan, were your ancestors really poor peasants?"

"Of course."

"You are simply a Golden Horse Best Actor." Engineer Wang also praised.

"Scaring the woman like that. Too much." Bei Wei couldn't bear it a bit.

"It is too much, but grace and severity must be combined. This degree is minimum." Xiao Zishan nodded, "We are surrounded by eyes. Without reversing such a situation, work cannot be carried out in the future."

Wen Desi said: "Giving them benefits in the past was 'Grace', now is the time to show 'Severity'."

"Yes," Xiao Zishan explained. Since they couldn't dig out these "eyes" now, they could only turn the "eyes" around.

"Is this enough?"

"Just the beginning. Loyalty, this kind of thing, cannot be established by just a few words. Collecting younger brothers is difficult."

To gain loyalty, first is to have power - no one will be loyal to a weak individual or organization; second is to have interests. Only with interests will there be motivation to strive. In the past, they had already given interests, next they had to show their power. Reaching a certain degree, success will follow naturally.

"I see time travel predecessors were very easy. With a few words, younger brothers bowed their heads and worshipped."

"We don't have aura of tyranny, do we?"

"You have it, I don't want it..."

The atmosphere on the dinner table became active again. Xiao Zishan secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Actually, he was not very sure about this conversation, but he used the woman's fear of the past.

Talking for a while, Gao Di came. Although small, he was very clever. Seeing his mother's eyes were red, he knew something happened, so he hurriedly brought the account book to pay respect.

Wen Desi asked about the family situation casually, and looked at the account book - this account book was just a running account, and the income and expenditure in the house were simple. He understood it in no time, so he praised a few sentences. Seeing his uneasy look gradually fading, he asked:
"Did people from the Gao family come often recently?"

"Often!" The boy didn't hide it at all, nodding vigorously, "That Yan Little Hat comes often, whispering to dad every time."

"Yan Little Hat?" Wen Desi was stunned, then realized he meant Steward Yan - he often wore a Six-Harmony Unity small hat.

"What did they say?"

Gao Di hesitated slightly. Xiao Zishan said: "Just say it."

"It seems that Yan Little Hat always asks for news about Masters," Gao Di said, "But dad doesn't allow me to listen to them talking nearby."

"Do people from the Gao family treat you well?"

"Well?" Gao Di didn't understand this question very well, "Don't know if it's good. I... haven't served in the Gao family. Several gentlemen in the accounting room treated me okay. There are also a few children, we often play together."

"Are they all servants of the Gao family?"

"Yes, some are born in the house, some are like me."

"Are there anyone among those children who are especially good with you?"

"Quite a few. Little Li, Little Qian, the Wang brothers..."

"Good, come to the study later and make a list." Wen Desi instructed.
