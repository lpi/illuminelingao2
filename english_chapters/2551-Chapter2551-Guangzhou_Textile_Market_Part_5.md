# Chapter 2551: Guangzhou Textile Market (Part 5)

"This, is complicated to explain," An Jiu smiled beautifully, and Chen Lin's mind couldn't help but sway. "This involves issues of shares and equity. Simply put, each company's business scope is limited, so many companies were registered, but generally speaking, they all belong to one boss!"

An Jiu knew that telling them about cross-holding, subsidiary/grandson companies, actual controllers, legal persons, proxy holding, and the like would be very hard to understand. After all, these rules evolved only when capitalism was quite mature. The Senate brought this set of advanced corporate systems, and many people still hadn't understood it thoroughly.

"Then what is the main business of this Penglai Company?" Wu Yijun knew An Jiu wouldn't bring him here for no reason. Although he didn't know what medicine she was selling in her gourd, he couldn't be too dull and follow her guidance blindly, lest she look down on him.

"Miss An, since you could come to Nansha to guide textiles, presumably this company also focuses on cotton textiles..." Chen Lin said.

"Quite the opposite, our company doesn't do cloth; we are just porters for cloth merchants." An Jiu replied.

"Oh? Like brokers [Yaren]?" Wu Yijun naturally associated it with this. Besides workshop owners who had their own workshops, those operating cloth businesses included putting-out merchants and brokers who collected intermediary commissions. Sometimes the boundaries between these three were not so clear. Sometimes brokers were also putting-out merchants selling cloth, or even held all three identities.

"Mr. Wu's association is very interesting; no wonder you would think so. However, the Senate does not set up Broker Houses [Yahang] in the production and circulation fields, so naturally there are no brokers. Legal market trade is free." An Jiu explained.

"Then it is?" Wu Yijun couldn't quite understand. Even if this Australian-Song established a Light Textile City, wasn't it something like a workshop market? There should be Official Brokers inside collecting intermediary commissions, matchmaking buyers and sellers, and managing the market. generally speaking, it was quite like brokers.

"Let's put it this way: you produce cloth for sale, or merchants traffic cloth from the interior or overseas; you always have to entrust people to deliver goods or purchase. If you have channels, of course, you can solve it yourself, but some places require large ships to go to, and you are unfamiliar with the roads in some places... As long as you are unable to transport yourself, you can find us to transport, for example, delivering goods to Nanyang or Taisi [Europe]."

Wu Yijun nodded slightly; he roughly understood a bit.

"Unlike Broker Houses, we mark prices clearly and do not collect taxes on behalf of the government. Moreover, this industry is not monopolized. It's not that you must use our routes or ships to transport to a certain place; other companies can also provide the same service. For example, there are two next door to us. If customers feel the price is unreasonable, finding them is also fine, but I have to do a little advertisement for myself: our company's cost-performance ratio is the most affordable." An Jiu laughed again after explaining.

"Companies next door? Are they Red Hairs?" Chen Lin asked. He saw before entering just now that two shops next door were already open, with many peculiar-dressed Red Hairs at the door.

"The people you saw, accurately speaking, are Dutchmen. In this row of merchant guilds, there are offices of the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company. Their work is mainly purchasing and selling goods here. But they also have a business which is shipping. You can find them to transport goods to any location overseas—as long as they have trading posts there."

"So it is." Wu Yijun said, "I remember in the past, Franks came to Guangzhou the most. Now they seem silent."

"The Portuguese will come too. Guarding that place in Macau, they are almost unable to do business." An Jiu laughed, "Compared to the British and Dutch, the Portuguese are not so enterprising, and their actions are much slower."

"Does the Senate really want to allow all these barbarians to come do business?" Wu Yijun was relatively surprised. He knew the Australians effectively carved out a piece of Huangpu Port as a berthing place for merchants of various countries and allowed them to buy land to build houses and set up warehouses. Now they even wanted to give them permanent merchant guilds here!

"Why not? As long as they pay taxes legally and abide by the Senate's laws and regulations, isn't providing them convenience for business a due meaning?" Saying this, she laughed, "You are all in cotton textiles; maybe later you will have to rely on them to transport cotton to you."

"Hmm?! They have cotton?"

"Of course they have," An Jiu nodded, "But it's not produced in their own countries, but trafficking from India."

"How does Miss know this?" Chen Lin was very concerned about cotton matters and asked hurriedly.

"Since you engage in the cotton textile industry, how can you not understand the market at all? On this Guangzhou ground, besides Songjiang cloth, whose cloth is the most numerous?"

"Indian cloth." Chen Lin then discovered he was dizzy. Since there was so much Indian cotton cloth on the market, the local place undoubtedly had large-scale cotton production.

"This is great! Another channel for raw materials in the future."

The two lingered in Penglai Company for a long time, chatting about many topics. Compared to Chen Lin, Wu Yijun cared more about "business," asking quite a few questions about the future commercial trend of Guangzhou and textile products. An Jiu had no taboos; knowing what to say, she said it. The two chatted very happily. Chen Lin, however, was secretly ashamed in his heart. An Jiu was in Nansha for several months, yet he actually scrupled about some "defense between men and women" and hadn't talked deeply with her seriously a few times. Wasting a good opportunity to ask for advice in vain!

This talk lasted until noon. The two then remembered the appointment with Dong Jizhong in the afternoon and took their leave immediately. An Jiu was neither polite nor kept them for a meal, only saying if they wanted to look around the market in the afternoon, they could go to the Living Zone to have a simple meal; shops were already open there.

The Living Zone was not yet completed, but most storefronts had started business. The main business here was "Public Canteen" type cheap restaurants. Customers currently were mostly workers laboring on construction sites; business wasn't bad. Chen and Wu were "Long Gown Party," naturally couldn't mix with the "Short Jacket Gang" to eat. Fortunately, the place Dong Jizhong invited them to meet was a local tea house, exactly taking the opportunity of waiting for people to eat lunch first.

Entering the tea house, upon mentioning the three words "Dong Jizhong," a waiter came over to greet, saying Master Dong already booked a private room, asking the two to go in and sit first.

Just as they sat down, waiters sent various exquisite tea snacks like flowing water, and sent various famous teas for them to choose. Chen Lin thought secretly: *This Master Dong is indeed a Master's temperament!*

The waiter entertained attentively: "Master Dong said, please don't stand on ceremony, just eat first. He has to accompany the Old Matriarch to have lunch at home before coming over. Afraid of slighting the two of you..."

Since it was so, the two ate and drank for a while first. Waiting for about another hour, seeing it was already past noon, Dong Jizhong finally arrived.

Dong and Wu were old acquaintances, naturally no need for excessive politeness. It was Chen Lin's first time meeting this "General's family's First Master," so his cousin-uncle made the introduction. Dong Jizhong knew the young man before him was the actual manager of the Nansha factory and was quite surprised. Because Nansha had his family's shares, his words were quite polite.

Both sides took seats. The waiter came over to clear the scattered table, sent delicate tea snacks again, and brewed two pots of new tea. Only then did they enter the main topic.

"Ah Lin, this Master Dong is not an outsider. Just tell the process of building the factory in Nansha and the current situation."

Chen Lin knew this Master Dong's family was effectively the cousin-uncle's main investor; bluntly speaking, actually the major shareholder of Nansha. He composed himself, starting from his visit to Lingao, all the way to the recent trial production situation, telling it thoroughly once.

Chen Lin's enunciation was clear and logical. Although he spoke for about more than an hour from beginning to end, Dong Jizhong listened entranced, without any feeling of boredom.

Listening until the end, hearing that Nansha was about to stop production because cotton stock was insufficient, Dong Jizhong frowned slightly and asked:

"Is the cotton stored not enough?"

"Stored quite enough, but didn't expect the Australians' machines to be so fast." Chen Lin said, "A machine's daily volume equals the volume of several hundred people! Cotton consumption increases day by day; can't collect any around Nansha anymore." Chen Lin told Dong Jizhong the general idea of the dilemma he faced.

"Heard Master Dong has cotton here, so specially came to beg, can you share a part with Nansha?"

Dong Jizhong nodded: "So it is!" He gently tapped his palm with his fan, "This matter was originally a due obligation. Only looking at now, it is not very easy to handle. You probably also know, Guangzhou's cotton price has risen again and again recently. Although my family hoarded quite a bit of cotton, if we release goods to you now, the accountant at home will probably go make noise in front of the elders again, saying I sold too quickly..." Speaking of this, he smiled bitterly, "My mother fears most that I get cheated in business, even opposing my hoarding of cotton with all her might."

"Since the Old Madam isn't willing for you to hoard cotton, Master, what's improper about selling at a high position now to settle the bag for peace?" Wu Yijun was a bit strange.

"Hehe, this you don't know. To fear that I'd be duped, my mother specially sent an old manager to watch me. This old manager is quite good at management. Just that this way, I can't be the master of anything. Must pass his agreement..." He smiled helplessly, "I have to go back and talk to him about this matter first!"

Chen Lin was somewhat disappointed, but with his status, it was inconvenient to persuade. Wu Yijun spoke again: "Master! Although cotton market price is rising with the water now, it has reached an absurd level. At this moment, if there is any sign of trouble, once this cotton market falls, let alone disdaining selling cheaply, afraid by then it can only be sold as firewood! Now the market is so good, this old manager should understand."

"This you don't know," Dong Jizhong said, "You probably don't know yet, my father and brother both sent letters, saying harvests in cotton areas of Shandong and Henan are not good; cotton areas in Jianghuai region also suffered disasters. Even Songjiang here doesn't have enough to use. Australians purchased in large quantities during this period, so Northern Cotton prices naturally rose. The old manager's meaning is, this cotton still has room to rise."
