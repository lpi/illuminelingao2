# Chapter 1395 - Back Door

Seeing off Gou Chengxuan, Hao Yuan was just tidying up things on the table when the straw curtain was lifted. The girl from next door came in again--delivering today's dinner.

Hao Yuan living alone naturally didn't act as cook. Fortunately the girl's family next door did snack business, water and fire convenient, so he contracted meals to them. Three meals a day, considered small luxury.

Girl smiled: "Uncle Hao doing big business again. Eat meal first."

Speaking she put tray on table. Inside were two bowls of dishes, plus a small rice bucket. Steaming hot.

Dishes were a bowl of vegetables, plus a saltwater shrimp--probably fished from Qiantang River.

Although Hao Yuan was diligent and thrifty, he was absolutely not too mean on eating. One rice one dish per meal, with some aquatic product supplement every now and then. In Nanxiawa considered quite good food.

"Where do I have any big business," Hao Yuan smiled.

"You stop deceiving me. Really taking me as child?" Girl already had short hair stubble on scalp shaved for treating ringworm, only a few places hair stubble was both short and sparse.

"I never looked at you as child." Hao Yuan smiled, sat down. Girl opened rice bucket, helped him fill a bowl full of rice.

"Uncle Hao, my mother said, how about measure less rice daily in future, having half left every meal." Girl said.

"Not wasting anyway."

"Precisely because not wasting my mother said want you to measure less rice: You boarded at my home, already paid money. Taking advantage of leftover rice again, how justifiable?"

"Isn't boarder taking this advantage heavenly principle and earthly righteousness?" Hao Yuan ate rice minding himself.

"Taking your advantage, my whole family feels uneasy." Girl said, "This Nanxiawa, everyone benefits from your light. My family taking your advantage again, will be struck by thunder and lightning."

"Speaking so heavily." Hao Yuan smiled, picked a shrimp putting in mouth, "Your mother cooking fish and shrimp really has special skill!"

"Homely skill." Little girl supported cheek, watching Hao Yuan wolfing down meal, "Uncle Hao, you really don't look like rich family young master..."

"When did Uncle Hao say was rich family young master?"

"Don't care about this. You said giving me new name."

Little girl like all poor family girls at that time, had no formal name. Her family surnamed Jia, she ranked third, usually called Sanniang. Hao Yuan recently gave school names one by one to children studying at his place.

"You just be called Jia Le." Hao Yuan said, "Changle is your Jia family's chorus name. You take a Le (Joy) character, joyous and happy." Speaking, dipping water from tea cup, wrote two characters "Jia Le" on table surface.

"Great, thank you Uncle Hao!" Jia Le clapped hands happily. She tilted head looking at two characters on table again: "These two characters so unfamiliar..."

"You practice ten times daily, practice for a month won't be unfamiliar."

"Good! I definitely practice my name well!"

"Matter Uncle Hao told you last time, your parents agreed?"

"I originally wanted to tell you: Parents have no objection. We whole family's lives were saved by Uncle Hao. Now dispatching me to do such small thing, I definitely will do my best—besides going in eating white rice for free not counted still getting money. Heard money and grain given in Villa is much."

"Hehe, words said so." Hao Yuan stopped bowl and chopsticks, "But Villa is not a benevolent place. After you go in, aside from risking danger, usually it's like sitting in prison, frequently blamed, unavoidable beating and punishment often."

"I fear none of these—not that delicate. I don't care about beating and anger either. We aren't enjoying fortune outside either. Besides this is for Uncle Hao you."

Hao Yuan laughed. Jia Le probably felt these words inappropriate herself too, face instantly dyed red, bashful said, "I know, Uncle Hao told me, this is not for who, for everyone."

"This is right." Hao Yuan said, "I know, you and your parents are willing to go only remembering my benefits. But do you still remember words I told you?"

"Remember." Jia Le thought, "Not talking personal gratitude and grudges, want to work for poor people, want to vent anger for poor people."

"Since you are going to Villa, I might as well tell you clearly. You going to work for Uncle Hao this time, is to vent anger for this Hangzhou's common people, vent anger for everyone in Nanxiawa—Do you remember Uncle Hao told you: why Zeng Aqing family living behind committed suicide?"

"Remember." Jia Le face serious, eye rims slightly red—After accident she also ran to watch excitement. When seeing little boy of Zeng family who always chased her calling sister to play carried out, she ran home crying loudly, "Because silk price fell—all Master Zhao playing tricks in between."

"Master Zhao for own profit, didn't hesitate to harm millions of common people. Nanxiawa only has one Zeng Aqing, but out of Nanxiawa, don't know how many families broken and people died." Hao Yuan said seriously, "We want to seek justice for them."

"Uncle Hao, I understand!" Jia Le nodded solemnly, "Whatever you want me to do I do. Although I am a girl, at critical moment absolutely won't have soft feet."

"Now I don't want you to do anything. You just mix into Phoenix Mountain Villa first. Matters later, I will send people to tell you." He said standing up, walked to door listening to outside, then returned to table side, lowered voice said: "You listen well..."

Since beaten, Xihua moved inconveniently for a time, could only lie in bed resting. Next day several people came to visit successively. There were those having good relationship with her usually, also Yanhe and others out of classmate friendship. Xihua followed Zhao Yingong's instruction, kept wooden face not talking much to all, putting on look of heart-broken. People visiting her knew she was always arrogant, didn't mind.

Huang Xiang came to see her only at dusk next day—her status humble, dared not snatch this lead. Seeing Xihua lying on bed, unknowingly already shed tears, putting basket brought along on table.

"Miss Xihua, you suffered." She said one sentence, probably touched own feelings, tears gushing out uncontrollably, couldn't say a word following.

"It's Sister-in-law Huang, you sit." Xihua seeing acquaintances coming whole day, yet not half person revealing tone, secretly anxious somewhat. Seeing finally came one usually having general relationship with herself, couldn't help lifting spirit. She did things extremely seriously. Originally applied medicine yesterday, body not so painful anymore, this moment put on look of painful unbearable again.

"Yesterday was all me implicating you, causing you docked one month money and rice..."

"You must not say so." Huang Xiang wiping tears said, "Suffering we endure in filature, considered top share in Villa too. Except Miss Xihua you, hasn't been second person with face speaking for us. Just for this, let alone getting one month money and rice less, even taking sixty boards for you I am willing."

She wiped corner of eyes with sleeve, took out several items from basket: "This is bought by female workers in our factory pooling money, not some good items—can't take out any good things."

"I know you people, all heavy family burden, went only coveting high monthly money given by filature. How can I accept your things? Absolutely cannot."

"You not accepting, we feel even more uneasy inside." Huang Xiang said, "Yesterday Steward Cai already said, factory changing to three shifts, every shift two shichen less. Everyone says it was Miss Xihua risking life to exchange back. You are our benefactor..."

She rambled many grateful words. Xihua's mood was very complicated: She came out to speak for filature female workers only out of momentary indignation, didn't expect they would be so grateful with tears.

Although she declined repeatedly, still couldn't twist Huang Xiang's persistence, had to accept things.

Huang Xiang seeing her accepting things, only then proposed saying own family had a local distant relative, life difficult, planning to let daughter enter Villa to serve. Because child age small, and unwilling to sell body completely, according to rules in Villa, those entering to serve without selling body counted as hired workers, could only be miscellaneous labor or something in Cihui Hall, running errands. So wanted to ask Xihua a favor, getting a place able to learn something.

Xihua heart shocked, thought could this Huang Xiang be the spy?!

Her face color changed slightly, Huang Xiang already perceived. She forced smile: "I also know this matter hard to do..."

"Not hard to do." Xihua already figured out at this moment, right now anyone could be spy, only following nature could pull out fox tail. Immediately smiled bitterly, "Sister-in-law Huang, myself am still waiting punishment body, don't know how Master will dispose after getting up. If still doing original errand, then move that girl to my side as school miscellaneous labor. Following me, at least can learn recognizing a few characters, can also learn some needlework craft."

Huang Xiang happily blessed a blessing: "Master treats you nothing to say! You get well tomorrow, inevitably still same as before."

Xihua asked: "What is that girl called?"

"Replying to Miss: She surnames Jia, ranks third. You just call her Little Sanniang."

Huang Xiang returned to dormitory quarters. She had a man, so allocated a separate room in Villa. In room, a woman was waiting for her. Woman waiting for her called Wang Rong'er, was servant woman in Villa.

"Sister-in-law Huang, how was it?" Seeing Huang Xiang coming, she asked urgently.

"All settled." Huang Xiang picked up teapot on table, poured a full bowl of coarse tea, drank down gulp gulp, "Miss Xihua agreed to transfer your family niece to her school."

"That is really thank you so much!" Wang Rong'er brows raised with joy, blessed several blessings in row, took out several Circulation Notes from waist stuffing into her hand, "Sister-in-law Huang is capable."

"Isn't it relying on Miss Xihua's blessing!" Huang Xiang "smilingly accepted" several Circulation Notes, thinking although docked one month money and rice this time, finally Master reduced filature working hours, Miss Xihua also looked at herself differently, could be called fortune out of misfortune.
