# Chapter 555 - Shipwreck Treasure

"Nothing strange about it. Yugoslavia has a famous reputation for light weapons manufacturing," Lin Chuanqing said. "Besides, after Yugoslavia dissolved, a lot of weapons leaked out illegally. Arms dealers trafficking this stuff is hardly surprising."

"This gun is rather odd—" Gao Xiaosong picked up a submachine gun with a short body and a folding metal stock.

"This is the VZ68," Lin Chuanqing said, picking one up and getting a feel for it. "The 9mm version of the Czech VZ61. Commonly called the Scorpion submachine gun."

Gao Xiaosong found the gun truly ugly. It looked like an enlarged handgun. He tried holding it and shouldering it, then shook his head: "It feels good in the hand, but very hard to shoulder—the body's too short to aim properly. Wonder how it compares to the Type 85 submachine gun?"

As a Coast Guard officer, Gao Xiaosong had used both the Type 85 submachine gun and the Type 56C short assault rifle; he wasn't particularly fond of either. But as the captain of a coast guard unit that frequently took ships out on coastal patrol, he very much hoped to be equipped with a weapon that had fierce firepower for rapid suppression, yet with a compact body—rather than the current SKS rifle or short-barreled Minié rifle.

"Much better, of course. The VZ61 series is very famous internationally." Lin Chuanqing smiled. "The VZ61 dates back to 1951. Production continued into the 21st century. You could say it's been battle-proven."

"That's good then." Gao Xiaosong was somewhat reluctant to put the gun down, handling it fondly for quite some time before finally setting it back.

"That's right, this weapons mix really does have the look of arms dealers." Lin Chuanqing surveyed the weapons spread on the ground. "Mostly Eastern European goods."

Subsequent surprises kept coming. They found light rocket launchers and machine guns. The machine guns were M240s—unlike the Eastern European mass-market goods, these were genuine current US military-issue equipment. Everyone's eyes practically turned green with envy. The atmosphere at the crate-opening scene was electric; everyone wanted to see for themselves. Gao Xiaosong had to repeatedly remind people not to leave their posts without authorization.

After opening crates and counting and recording each item, the ship's total haul was: 25 M77B1 automatic rifles, 4 M240 machine guns, 36 CZ99 handguns, 12 VZ68 submachine guns, 4,000 rounds of 9mm Parabellum, 25,000 rounds of NATO 7.62mm, 120 hand grenades, 25 M72 LAW 66mm single-use rocket launchers, plus numerous gun parts and plastic explosives.

"This was just a small-time dealer," Lin Chuanqing said. "Given this ship's tonnage, it could have carried ten times as much ordnance. Looks like an amateur doing it on the side."

Once the initial fervor subsided, everyone realized there wasn't much to celebrate. The automatic weapons were too few. If they hadn't had the weapons procured through the North American Branch, this would indeed have been a tremendous windfall of timely aid. But they didn't lack weapons—they had more than enough handguns and SKS rifles for everyone with some to spare. What good were 25 automatic rifles, 12 submachine guns, and 4 machine guns? As for the single-use rocket launchers, there were no tanks in this era to shoot at. Their numbers were too few and their range too short to use as artillery—completely useless. The most valuable find was merely another batch of supplementary ammunition.

The everyday items found on the ship proved more useful. More cargo was subsequently discovered: many large waterlogged bundles were removed from compartments—they had been immovable underwater. Opened now, they proved to be "Made in China" athletic wear and sneakers, mostly from Zhejiang and Guangdong. There was even a batch of counterfeits—everything from ladies' handbags to men's leather wallets and briefcases. After soaking in fresh water to remove salt and some maintenance, they could probably still be used. In a concealed hidden compartment, they found 200,000 American cigarettes, 40 cases of Scotch whisky, and several hundred assorted pornographic magazines, all sealed tight in specialty packing crates and waterproof cloth. Despite soaking in seawater this long, nothing was damaged—this smuggler seemed to sell everything.

"The clothing and shoes were for cover, earning a little pocket money on the side," Lin Chuanqing explained, having done gray-area work himself and knowing something about the trade. "Cigarettes, liquor, and magazines can be used for bribes or sold for good money."

The shipowner's identity was now beyond doubt, but how many people had been on the ship, where the others besides the one who had already died had gone, and how they had come to this timeline—all remained mysteries.

The search of the vessel indicated that at least five people had once been aboard. This conclusion was drawn from the bedding and personal effects in the crew quarters.

"One thing puzzles me," Gao Xiaosong said. "Most personal effects were left behind on the ship, and most were very useful items. Even if one person died, the others abandoning ship would have taken his things—after all, these are exactly what you need most in a shipwreck at sea."

"Same issue as the lifeboat question from last time. Very likely there were few people when they abandoned ship—maybe only one or two," Lin Chuanqing said.

The fishing vessel had carried two lifeboats; one was already gone, and the other remained on the vessel. It was beautifully made and in perfect condition—except that its emergency kit had already been taken. All other accessories were complete; nothing was missing.

The most critical question was: had the departed people taken weapons with them?

From ordinary logic, survivors couldn't possibly not take weapons for self-defense. But the ordnance on the ship had clearly been untouched—all crates and packaging were intact, showing no signs of being opened or used.

Unless they had taken entire crates of weapons, but Lin Chuanqing thought that unlikely:

"These people should have had personal sidearms—enough for self-defense. The weapons in the hold were their merchandise. They wouldn't use them unless absolutely necessary."

The search on board confirmed this speculation. They found some shell casings and ammunition packaging, and even a half-used opened box of 9mm handgun cartridges.

......

After hearing Gao Xiaosong's report, Yi Fan asked, "Where's the ship now?"

"The ship is currently docked at a secret location undergoing maintenance," Gao Xiaosong said. "Without authorization, I temporarily cannot disclose the location."

"Who can authorize it?"

"The Executive Committee," Gao Xiaosong said.

"The first matter we need to decide is whether Matter A should be disclosed to all transmigrators," said Ma Jia, who was chairing the meeting. He himself had only learned of it during the Executive Committee meeting. "The second is what countermeasures should be taken."

"Shouldn't this be decided by the Executive Committee?" Chen Haiyang asked.

"The Executive Committee wants the Security Council to assess this issue. Based on the assessment results, the Executive Committee will then consider whether to disseminate it to all transmigrators," Ma Jia said.

After brief discussion, everyone agreed this matter should be conveyed to all transmigrators—to prevent transmigrators from encountering other travelers while uninformed and being caught off guard. After being informed, everyone would at least have some vigilance.

No one knew what weapons those who had left had taken: whether they carried machine guns, grenades, or other heavy weapons. Though they had abandoned ship, they couldn't possibly have left without taking some weapons. No matter how impressive Minié rifles were in this era, they couldn't match modern automatic rifles.

Ran Yao said: "There are only 500-plus transmigrators. Matters affecting the collective and individual interests like this should be communicated to everyone!"

As for countermeasures, the Eight-Person Conference agreed that the Executive Committee's previously established principle of "welcoming those willing to come to the light, and resolutely eliminating those who refuse" was feasible. However, for specific implementation, they recommended:

If the other party had already established their own power base with a certain scale, they should be directly struck without warning and completely annihilated.

If the other party consisted only of individual or small numbers operating alone, they should be directly captured and then "persuaded" to join. Anyone resisting arrest or refusing to join should be eliminated.

Once armed conflict occurred with these people, prisoners would no longer be accepted—all would be annihilated. Their family members and associates in this timeline should all be exterminated. All their possessions should be confiscated or destroyed. No trace should remain in this timeline.

Yi Fan even proposed that since other transmigrators had been discovered, the possibility of others having arrived in this timeline couldn't be ruled out. A dedicated "witch-hunting squad" organization should be specifically established to gather intelligence on other transmigrators while conducting hunting and extermination operations against them.

"We don't have the resources for this now, and the only ones we can confirm are just this one group. Setting up a dedicated organization is too wasteful," Ma Jia objected. "I think we should just notify all departments of this possibility, raise everyone's vigilance, and have them report any suspicious circumstances promptly."

Thus "Matter A" was published on the OA system to all transmigrators. The discovery of traces of other transmigrators in this timeline was nothing short of a depth charge. For a time, the Executive Committee and various departments' phones were nearly blown up, with everyone asking for detailed information and what countermeasures would be taken. The General Affairs Office replied that the detailed account would be published on the BBS.

After the event summary was published, it drew criticism from Shan Liang and others: such a major matter with enormous implications for the transmigrator collective and every transmigrator—why hadn't it been promptly reported? Why had it been concealed for months? The Executive Committee had clearly severely disregarded the masses' "right to know."

Others then joined this chorus of questioning. But the General Affairs Office's response was simple: this incident had occurred during the First Executive Committee's administration. The Second Executive Committee had published the incident immediately upon taking office, so claims of disregarding the "right to know" were unfounded.

Clearly, Shan Liang's target for criticism had vanished—this was a cunning technical maneuver, unreasonable but legal. The Second Executive Committee had no vulnerability on this issue. Everyone wasn't particularly interested in this topic anyway—transmigrators were more interested in the supplies and equipment, especially weapons, obtained from the ship.
