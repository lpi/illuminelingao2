# Chapter 342 - Acids and Bases (I)

On second thought, he understood: "You want to use radiation for sterilization?"

"Alcohol sterilization and moist heat methods both have drawbacks. It would be great if we could use radiation sterilization."

"That won't work. I can't make the call, and the Planning Committee definitely won't agree either. There are also radiation shielding issues with the X-ray machine, so forget it." Shi Niaoren said, "If you really need it, transport the items to the hospital radiology room to do it."

Ji Situi looked at the chemical industrial zone in front of him, which had already taken shape with forest-like towers and crisscrossing pipes, feeling a great sense of satisfaction for a moment. This most critical facility of the Transmigration Group was finally taking form. Although the construction of the Bopu Chemical Industrial Zone started from the time when indigenous cement and bricks could be mass-produced, limited by various shortages of manpower and material resources, the entire project had maintained a state of steady flow and slow construction. The countless equipment installation difficulties encountered during the period really drove this person in charge of chemical engineering crazy—he had worked in chemical plants, but working in a chemical plant and installing a chemical plant were quite different.

Looking at the various towers erected and installed with great difficulty before his eyes—Synthesis Tower, Ammonia Distillation Tower, Ethanol Rectification Tower, Ammonia Washing Tower, Absorption Tower, Decarbonization Tower, Debenzolization Tower, Rectification Tower, Synthetic Ammonia Carbonization Combined Tower, Synthetic Ammonia Saturated Hot Water Tower, Shift Gas Desulfurization Tower, Saturated Hot Water Tower... These large and small towers and the pipes connecting them added up to over three hundred tons. Just unloading them, transporting them here, and installing them one by one could be called a great miracle—spending countless manpower, racking brains, even costing a few lives and several injuries, and finally using all kinds of methods from documentaries on how Egyptians built pyramids and Celts built Stonehenge. Fortunately, there were quite a few capable people in various aspects, with experience in chemical plant architecture and construction; otherwise, relying on him alone would definitely have driven him mad.

Of course, this set of equipment was nothing in the 21st century: an 800-ton Synthetic Ammonia and Combined Soda Ash Manufacturing System and a Coal Coking Chemical System. Manufacturers felt strange when customizing and purchasing the equipment—in terms of output, current small county chemical plants produced more than them. Their power lay in the powerful combined manufacturing capability of products. The simplest example: the synthetic ammonia industry, besides producing ammonia water and further producing nitric acid, could also use ammonia water as a raw material to react with salt to produce soda ash, as well as many by-products. It could be said that with the synthetic ammonia industry, the transmigrators would permanently occupy the top of the food chain in this timeline. No one could confront a ruling group controlling high explosives and high-efficiency chemical fertilizers.

Ji Situi watched with surging emotions, but finally sighed: Lack of coal!

Coal was not only the production raw material for these two systems but also necessary for supporting facilities. The large amount of steam, hot water, and electricity required for production all relied on coal to provide. It seemed unreliable for that large boiler of the Bopu Thermal Power Plant under construction to continue burning wood to produce steam like a locomobile.

The shortage of coal, like a tightening spell, hovered over his head deeply. Once operating, the quantity of coal required by the entire chemical zone far exceeded the amount currently transportable from Guangdong. And this coal also had to burden the steel plant, cement plant, and increasing numbers of boilers with growing appetites—huge productivity was limited by the bottleneck of transportation.

Once chemical industrial enterprises started up for production, they generally wouldn't stop operation without special circumstances like maintenance. Given the current coal shortage status, it would be awkward to wait for rice to cook without ingredients once operation started.

The rumbling machine sounds from the shipyard not far away and the huge steel rolling sounds constantly emitted from the steel plant slightly soothed his uneasy mood. An epoch-making ship was under construction; this was the first iron-ribbed wooden-hulled ship designed and manufactured by the transmigrators themselves—the complexity in craftsmanship of building all-wooden sailing ships made the mechanical department lose confidence. The scarcity of large timber for keels and ribs, the cumbersomeness of timber processing, the heavy deadweight, weak strength, and low payload ratio of wooden structures made Wen Desi determined to try building hybrid-powered large iron-ribbed wooden-hulled ships earlier than planned, to use for carrying the urgently needed bulk cargo.

The keel laying for this ship began after the expedition team returned from circumnavigating the island. To satisfy the demand for production of ship materials, the steel plant was manufacturing and installing a steam hammer. This was the largest industrial equipment built by the Transmigration Group in history. All elite soldiers and strong generals of the Industrial and Energy Committee slept in the factory, working 24 hours a day.

It was estimated that the ship's effective payload could reach one thousand two hundred tons, far exceeding all current ships. The huge hull plus powerful hybrid power was enough to enable it to shake off most maritime threats.

But the demand for Three Acids and Two Alkalis was already very urgent; large shipments of coal couldn't be waited for. The finished products brought from the other timeline were about to run out, and the small amount of sulfuric acid dry-distilled from raw materials like green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) was really too little—simply not even enough to fill teeth gaps. Places needing sulfuric acid and caustic soda were increasing, forcing Ji Situi to settle for second best and decide to launch two sets of simple chemical equipment before the coal supply stabilized—fortunately, raw materials for these two processes didn't require coal, and equipment requirements were easier.

One was the indigenous method of electrolytic salt to produce caustic soda, and the other was the Pyrite Contact Process to produce sulfuric acid. These both belonged to backward processes that should be eliminated, with high waste and serious pollution. Fortunately, the construction requirement level was extremely low, and barbaric production regardless of consequences could make do. In the future, after the combined chemical plant started production, this small plant could also serve as a supplement. Moreover, the expedition fleet transported back almost a full 20 tons of pyrite from Wanning. Making sulfuric acid would be enough to use for quite a while.

This Contact Process Sulfuric Acid Plant manufactured by Ji Situi was located at the downwind edge of the industrial zone, very far from residential areas and farmland. The full set of design drawings and construction techniques were found in the Grand Library. Its crudeness and terror level of disregarding safety made Ji Situi suck in a breath of cold air—he only knew there were indigenous methods to make sulfuric acid in this world, but didn't expect it could be indigenous to such a terrifying extent. No wonder the teeth of the Eighth Route Army ordnance workers back then were eroded by acid fumes.

The overall construction was not difficult, even could be said to be simple. The acid tower was made using large glazed ceramic water vats. The instructions in the book used ceramic vats. Transmigrators could already mass-produce this thing now. Because of its wide use and corrosion resistance, orders were extremely numerous. Xiao Bailang had summed up enough experience from countless failures; making water vats was not only proficient but also highly efficient—he used mechanized mold release methods to manufacture vat embryos, and the firing level also made local workers bow down—transmigrators possessed industrial thermometers and combustion control means; as long as the temperature at each stage in production was clear, kiln temperature rise and fall could be precisely mastered. This quantitative ability was far more accurate than workers using personal feelings of eyes and skin temperature.

However, Ji Situi didn't plan to custom-make water vats; water vats were helpless substitutes. Since substituting, might as well substitute with higher technical content. Why make the unnecessary move of knocking out the bottom of the water vat and finding something to seal the interface between vats to prevent acid mist leakage—given he had practically no particularly good acid-resistant sealing materials in hand, indigenous sealing would definitely leak—he still wanted to continue eating with his own teeth for the rest of his life. So what he wanted Xiao Bailang to make was a complete ceramic reaction vat, diameter 700mm, height 3.65 meters. This almost drove Xiao Bailang crazy—this difficulty was too high. Super-large ceramic items were very hard to fire.

After tossing and turning with his men for several days, Xiao Bailang finally produced a compromise product. The entire reaction cylinder was composed of two parts, but to strengthen sealing, the connecting parts were sleeved jointed, and the sealing effect was quite good. Sealing with some acid-resistant material would make do.

Then he ordered a batch of cast iron pipes from the metallurgy department. The lump ore furnace for burning pyrite was built with refractory bricks, containing four combustion furnaces inside, each with a hearth of 0.3 square meters. Grate bars and furnace doors were all made of cast iron to facilitate easy sealing without leakage. Above the furnace, a cyclone dust collector was built with refractory materials. For the combustion and dust removal needs of the entire furnace, Ji Situi got a small 2-horsepower blower; this amount of electricity was not a problem in Bopu Industrial Zone.

Pyrite was first crushed into fine particles in the ore crusher, then put into the lump ore furnace for roasting. The exiting furnace gas passed through the cyclone dust collector built of refractory bricks and entered the First Converter. The gas in the First Converter was cooled by cast iron pipes and sent into the Second Converter to continue reacting.

The original plan for the First and Second Converters was to use water vats; Ji Situi decided to switch to iron sheet oil drums. Converters and dust collectors both needed insulation; Ji Situi had no ready-made insulation materials available, so he built outer frames with bricks around these three objects and filled the surrounding gaps with plant ash. Iron catalyst was placed in each of these two converters for catalysis.

After coming out of the converter, the gas was cooled by cast iron pipes and sent into the Absorption Tower by a hand pump to be showered with acid, then recovered after cooling to become finished acid. Concentration 98%.

The Acid Tower was Xiao Bailang's three-section combined ceramic vat. Xiao Bailang mastered tolerance quite well; it was easily assembled in place after hoisting. The interior of the acid tower was filled with stacked broken tile vat pieces. The external sealing material used was made of water glass mixed with porcelain powder—for this, many porcelains were smashed and ground into powder. Fortunately, there was only one place to seal; piling up more would do. This material had a characteristic that it would harden and increase in strength after meeting acid. It was considered a relatively easy-to-use acid-resistant sealing material.

Wind along the coast of Lingao was relatively strong, with one or two typhoons annually; the outside of the entire acid tower was fixed on four sides with brick-built pillars.

After the core equipment was settled, other water cooling and recovery devices were easily handled. Most transmission pipelines used ceramic pipes, some used cast iron pipes, but for valves alone, Ji Situi didn't scrimp and save, but used real chemical industry specialized valves. He personally checked every seal. After checking without errors, Ji Situi ordered preparation for ignition production.

Ji Situi selected several cautious people from the laborers to be operators. First, they took three days of safety production classes. However, for the first few days of production, Ji Situi decided only transmigrators would do it themselves, with indigenous operators watching and learning from the side—he didn't trust these farmers who hadn't put down hoes for many days. If a major casualty accident happened, the miserable state of chemical burns would cast a huge shadow on future workers.

For this epoch-making industrial progress, Ji Situi led a group of chemistry enthusiasts and laborers under him to bustle for a whole day. Collected a large amount of dry firewood, and allocated a lot of coal from the Planning Committee. The quality of Wanning pyrite unloaded from the ship was quite good; after testing, the average sulfur content was over 50%. These ores were first sent to the ore dressing plant for dressing, then crushed into small pieces. Stevedores used manual derricks to move baskets of ore onto a long train of flatbed cars on the rails. Then two workers climbed onto the front diesel tractor. The driver watched a tall tower hundreds of meters away; when the red flag turned to a yellow flag, a worker started the diesel engine. Once the green flag rose, the entire train moved, slowly driving towards the sulfuric acid plant.

While Ji Situi organized manpower to build the sulfuric acid plant, the rail transport hosted by Lingao General Construction Company also extended here quickly. Now, rail connections between various factories, warehouses, and docks within the two industrial zones of Bairen and Bopu had been completed respectively—flatbed trucks pulled by diesel tractors ran fully loaded with various raw materials and finished products, emitting muffled horn sounds from time to time.

After the last train of pyrite sand arrived, several small hills had piled up behind Ji Situi. Firewood, coal, pyrite, and plenty of lime.

He asked indigenous workers to light firewood at the ash outlets of the four hearths of the lump ore furnace to start the warming process. The entire process would last about 48 hours, so Ji Situi took time to go to Xiao Bailang's place again—this time he ordered sulfuric acid jars.

"The jars are made." Xiao Bailang pointed to a row of jars on the clearing. These jars were all glazed with bean-green glaze, with ears on both sides, shaped like small wine jars, only the jar body was very straight.

"According to your request, each 25-liter capacity, added threads, plus threaded lids. Really rare!" Xiao Bailang smacked his lips, "Pottery jars using threaded lids."

"These are jars for holding concentrated sulfuric acid; won't do if not sealed tight."

These pottery jars dedicated to holding concentrated sulfuric acid could be tightened with threaded lids—actually, this alone couldn't guarantee sealing. According to the traditional method, asbestos rope dipped in water glass was wrapped around the jar mouth before tightening the lid. But transmigrators didn't have much water glass, let alone asbestos rope. Water glass could be manufactured later; asbestos probably couldn't be obtained without trade. Fortunately, nature provided another natural corrosion-resistant material: raw lacquer.
