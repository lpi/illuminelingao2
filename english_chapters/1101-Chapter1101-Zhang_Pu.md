# Chapter 1101 - Zhang Pu

"With your current reputation in the Society, as long as you review some examination essays, you're certain to place well in the current examination." He said with a smile. Zhang Dai knew that Zhao Yingong's *xiucai* credentials were dubiously obtained—he could tell from their usual conversations that although this Master Zhao possessed broad learning, his knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics was decidedly threadbare.

"It's precisely the examination essays that I can't manage..."

Zhang Dai smiled and lowered his voice. "Since we're both men of the same circle, what need is there for such deceitful trifles? As long as the writing is coherent, that will suffice!"

Zhao Yingong had long heard of the Revival Society's manipulation of the civil examinations—this was practically an open secret among the literati of Jiangnan. Ever since the grand Jinling Assembly, the Revival Society's influence had grown immense. With the deliberate support of Donglin-aligned officials at every level, joining the Revival Society had become a shortcut to examination success. By the time of Zhang Pu's death, when the Society's power was at its zenith, they could not only determine who would pass but even pre-arrange the placement rankings.

Many of those celebrated for their moral integrity in the late Ming showed no compunction about such matters. Even Wen Zhenmeng—widely esteemed for his uprightness, so respected by the Emperor that he served as Imperial Lecturer and Grand Secretary—had accepted Zhang Pu's requests for patronage, secretly arranging the rankings of Revival Society candidates. Quite clearly, Zhao Yingong believed the Donglin loyalists were willing to do this primarily because they were influenced by the mentality of "competition for power."

In the court, mere moral integrity was insufficient to maintain one's footing—let alone implement one's political agenda; self-preservation itself became difficult. From the bitter factional struggles of the Tianqi era, Donglin and the Revival Society had learned this lesson well: to reform governance, one first needed sufficient "allies" in both the central court and the provinces. And manipulating the civil examinations was the most expedient way to achieve this. The Revival Society's core members were scholars; for them, producing examination essays that met the passing standard was hardly a challenge.

A thought stirred in Zhao Yingong's mind. He had long been somewhat dissatisfied with his mere *xiucai* status—in social dealings, he always felt slightly inferior to others, especially those *juren* or retired *jinshi*. Though they treated him courteously, once they learned he was merely a "blue-gowned scholar," a hint of condescension invariably crept into their manner.

However, such arrangements probably required silver, and Zhao Yingong had not yet joined the Revival Society. From a professional standpoint, his joining the Society would be inappropriate.

Zhao Yingong said, "I'm not yet a member of the Revival Society..."

Zhang Dai nodded thoughtfully. He knew Zhao Yingong's "true scholarship"—if he really were to join the Society, the "Two Zhangs" would never approve—that would truly become a joke.

But his eyes lit up, and he said, "No matter. Master Zhao can become a 'Society Friend.'" He snapped his fan shut with a flourish. "A Society Friend such as yourself is already famous throughout Jiangnan. Having Tianru help you ascend a further rung would hardly be inappropriate."

Chatting as they went, the two made swift passage to Taicang.

Taicang was a directly-administered prefecture, carved from portions of Kunshan, Jiading, and Changshu counties during the Hongzhi era. Situated along the Yangtze River, its land was mostly sandy and elevated, so cotton was the predominant crop.

From the Qing dynasty onward, Taicang had been a prosperous region—even during the three difficult years of famine, many local peasants still had commercial grain to eat, all thanks to cotton. But in the late Ming, the peculiar fiscal system turned this cotton-producing region into a poverty-stricken area. The reason was that the locality produced very little grain, yet annual taxes had to be paid in kind. Local people were forced to sell their cotton and purchase grain from elsewhere to meet their obligations. If external grain was cheap, the burden remained bearable; once imported grain prices surged, the burden became crushing.

In the past two years, Jiangnan's cotton textile industry had been in severe decline, and Taicang's cotton cultivation had suffered greatly in turn. The villages along the route appeared quite desolate.

The boat arrived at Zhang Pu's riverside landing. The house was new, not an old family residence. The flagpole before the gate, inscribed with "Metropolitan Graduate" (*jinshi jidi*), was freshly erected, the lacquer still gleaming, exuding an air of celebration.

Zhao Yingong knew that although Zhang Pu was born a typical "second-generation heir" to both wealth and officialdom, his early life had been marked by hardship. His uncle had served as Minister of Works in Nanjing, and his father was one of Taicang's most prominent landlords. Yet among ten brothers, he was the sole offspring of a concubine—disdained not only by his clan but even by his uncle's household servants, who showed open contempt for his father as well. After his father's death, the fifteen-year-old Zhang Pu and his mother were forced to leave the Zhang household, surviving on what his mother earned from spinning yarn to pay for his studies.

From Zhang Pu's personal history alone—the journey from a despised concubine's son in a wealthy household to the literary leader renowned throughout the realm—this story was not only a model of success teaching but would make a compelling novel.

Zhao Yingong instructed Cai Shi to present their visiting cards while he and Zhang Dai waited ashore. He knew that after Zhang Pu had been selected as a *shujishi*, his brilliant performance at the Hanlin Academy had displeased Wen Tiren. Under the pretext of caring for relatives, Zhang Pu had taken leave and returned home, remaining in seclusion ever since, never returning to the court until his death.

Nevertheless, his influence had only swelled during his years at home, at one point reaching such heights that through the Revival Society's forces at court, he could effectively sway the political situation.

Zhao Yingong reflected that Zhang Pu's approach was essentially to manipulate court politics from behind the scenes—after all, as officials, he and Zhang Cai were too young and lacked the seniority to implement their political agenda directly. They had to work through senior officials of established reputation: Zhou Yanru was his choice.

Approaching him from the angle of supporting Zhou Yanru against Wen Tiren would likely succeed with seventy to eighty percent probability.

"My master invites the two gentlemen to meet in his study." A doorman who had been waiting at the gate bowed and spoke, then led them through the entrance hall. Turning right from the courtyard, they passed through a small door, wound along covered corridors, and after some time arrived at a secluded courtyard. Within stood a three-bay study with a central hall flanked by two smaller chambers. Along the walls grew various flowers and trees. In the western corner was a small pond, surrounded by glazed-tile railings, with two strangely shaped stone mountains rising from the water amid dense bamboo.

Zhao Yingong had no mind for close inspection. He hastily adjusted his cap and robes, and after a servant announced them, he bowed his head with hands clasped before him, stepping lightly through the doorway where a servant held up the curtain.

Hanlin Academy *shujishi* Zhang Pu was already waiting for him inside.

---

Zhang Pu was quite young, only thirty years old—the same age as Zhao Yingong. He already wore three strands of a thin beard, giving him a mature air. Zhao Yingong observed carefully and judged from his demeanor and expression that he was a rather magnanimous person, yet the occasional gleam of intensity in his eyes revealed an iron will and decisive nature—he was by no means a simple, ineffectual good man.

It was said that in Zhang Pu's youth, two arrogant household slaves of his uncle—Chen Peng and Guo Kun—had bullied his father and repeatedly insulted him for his lowly birth. Zhang Pu had written his vow of revenge in blood. Later, after his success in the examinations, he had Lu Zhenfei arrest the two slaves and bring them to Chongming County, where the magistrate secretly had them executed.

Seeing the two enter, Zhang Pu came forward with a smile. Both parties exchanged bows in greeting, and Zhang Dai introduced Zhao Yingong to Zhang Pu. After another round of courtesies, they settled in.

"Today I've come to call on Master Tianru—I'll be frank. I have a favor to ask," Zhao Yingong said directly.

"I've already gathered a sense of it," Zhang Pu said, gazing at him with a compelling intensity. As a literary leader capable of influencing court politics from behind the scenes, he had presence. "Could it be concerning Sun Huodong?"

"Indeed." Zhao Yingong was secretly startled—though he had discussed his intentions with Zhang Dai, the man had no interest in such matters and would not have sent someone ahead to inform Zhang Pu. That Zhang Pu had guessed his purpose upon meeting him clearly showed that he maintained his own intelligence network.

"That's correct—it is about Sun Huodong." Zhao Yingong nodded.

Zhang Pu said nothing for a moment, seeming to ponder something. Finally he spoke: "What makes you believe I possess the ability to help Sun Huodong?"

"You personally may not, but the Revival Society and Donglin can." Zhao Yingong spoke with absolute certainty. This too was a form of flattery, expressing the sentiment: "Who else but you for this great task?"

Zhang Pu said, "Sun Huodong has marriage ties to Grand Secretary Xu's son. Why not seek Grand Secretary Xu's assistance?"

"For that very reason, Grand Secretary Xu is not in a position to speak on his behalf," Zhao Yingong replied.

Another silence. Zhao Yingong knew that though Zhang Pu lived in Taicang, he was thoroughly informed about court affairs. He must now be weighing the merits and risks. After a moment's thought, he spoke with utmost sincerity:

"In court politics, Sun Huodong is but a minor chess piece. Those now pursuing Sun Huodong—are they not actually aiming at Grand Secretary Zhou?" He paused to let the impression sink in. "If Sun Huodong falls, Grand Secretary Zhou himself may not long remain at court!"

What would move Zhang Pu was precisely the matter of Zhou Yanru's position. How vital Zhou Yanru was to the current Donglin and Revival Society—Zhang Pu himself must weigh this carefully.

"What leads you to such a conclusion?" The other fixed his gaze on him.

Zhao Yingong had done his research on this question. He had one advantage: historical materials from later centuries concerning the entanglements between Zhou Yanru, Wen Tiren, and the Donglin faction were plentiful, with abundant primary sources from all sides. His command of the complete picture and its nuances might even exceed that of contemporaries. Thus he began with the Qian Longxi case, traced events through to the recent attacks by the censor Xue Guoguan—acting under instruction—against Zhou Yanru for allegedly arranging Wu Weiye's first-rank placement when he served as examiner. Not only were his materials from all sides thoroughly documented, but his analysis was cogent and orderly. The web of interests and conflicts between the various factions was laid out with crystal clarity.

Zhang Pu listened attentively throughout, his eyes occasionally revealing surprise. Only when Zhao Yingong concluded his dissertation did he speak: "I had no idea you understood court affairs so thoroughly, despite residing in Guangzhou!"

Zhao Yingong could only respond with a wry smile: this subject was too sensitive.

Zhang Pu stood and paced a few steps, then turned and asked, "Do you truly believe that if Sun Huodong falls, Grand Secretary Zhou cannot remain long either?"

"Yes!" Zhao Yingong replied crisply. "The relationship between Sun Huodong and Grand Secretary Zhou is known throughout the realm. In this Dengzhou upheaval, if Sun Huodong cannot redeem himself through meritorious service, how can Grand Secretary Zhou maintain his position?" He immediately added, "Once Grand Secretary Zhou is gone, Grand Secretary Xu is already elderly and infirm. Which of the remaining Grand Secretaries could be a match for Secretary Wen?"
