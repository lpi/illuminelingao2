# Chapter 143: The Navy

The Navy Department, strictly speaking, wasn't yet a Committee-recognized organization. Officially, it was listed as Fisheries-Production Group and Bopu Harbor District—under Agriculture-Department and Civil-Affairs respectively. Officially: one handled fishing/maritime-transport; the other managed Bopu Camp affairs, including ship-maintenance.

But after some former-naval-personnel and navy-enthusiasts' private lobbying, these departments were trending toward merger. Though Committee officially took a "no-comment" stance—anyone with Committee-positions knew merger was inevitable.

Unlike land-grabbing, building-constructing departments, Navy-people disdained brick-and-wood red-buildings. They wanted a Baroque-style Naval-Headquarters. Until that could be built, *Fengcheng* became this unofficial-Navy's office.

*Fengcheng* had completed its historical-mission since anchoring on D-Day. Until transmigrators re-established petroleum-industry, it could only remain moored. The ship was carefully maintained—housing modern navigation-equipment: radar, compass, marine-chronometers... crucially important for transmigrators' future naval-power. In worst-case scenarios, it could still serve as escape-route.

Usable furniture, equipment, materials, and tools were gradually offloaded for land-use. Unused compartments were sealed and locked. Large ships were complex-worlds—with insufficient personnel, no blind-spots could remain.

For Navy Department, this ship's comfort and convenience were land-unmatched. Generators, though restricted to basic-needs, amply supplied office and living-power. Ship's powerful-radio could easily contact all vessels at sea. Comfortable cabins, private-bathrooms, well-equipped kitchens. Unlike land-dwellers eating salt-fish, smoked-fish, dried-fish daily—the ship had refrigerators. Ship's galley served fresh-fish—even sashimi was effortless. Ice-production was continuous. Fruit-shaved-ice was trivial; brought powdered-milk even made ice-cream. Allegedly, navy-favoring Wen-Director frequently inspected *Fengcheng*—praising ice-cream and sashimi endlessly.

Unofficial-Navy's main-task remained fishing. Bopu originally had fishermen; after transmigrators occupied it, they fled. But this was Lingao's traditional fishing-ground. Losing it meant near-bankruptcy for fishermen. Finally, fishing-bosses negotiated with transmigrators—willing to pay fishing-product tribute for access. Travelers agreed: this reduced fishing-boat usage, saving diesel and motor-hours. Agreement reached: catches in Bopu vicinity split 2:8. Fishermen's share—transmigrators had priority-purchase at market-prices. Payment could be goods, grain, merchandise, or silver. Meanwhile, transmigrators' boats could still independently fish.

Soon, this fishing-hegemony extended to all fishing-boats in these waters. Compliant boats received red-triangle flags from Bopu as identification. For enforcement, Navy daily dispatched one fishing-boat patrolling fishing-zones—catching fish while supervising. First: ensuring no boats hid catches or transferred at sea. Second: expelling unflagged-boats.

"We've become fishing-tyrants now." Chen Haiyang stood on "Fishing-1's" deck, surveying surrounding working-boats, recalling childhood picture-books' fishing-tyrant images. His young heart had developed extreme revulsion and hatred for such unjust-systems—also kindling vague admiration for the Liberation-Army. Perhaps this was his original-motivation for becoming a naval-officer.

Now he was maintaining this unjust-system—moreover, he was one of its architects. World was sometimes strange like this.

"So what if we're fishing-tyrants? Catch-yields keep climbing. Wu Nanhai shut up! At this rate—Navy recognition is just a matter of time." Li Di stood excitedly beside him—no guilt whatsoever. This electronics-engineer-turned-fatty had stubbornly wormed into Navy-Department, self-proclaiming "Naval-Engineer," daily hammering mysteriously in a shed, showing nobody—though everyone knew: a small steam-engine inside. A kit bought from overseas—but this machine still hadn't operated properly since landing.

Chen Haiyang didn't continue this topic. Since D-Day, regardless of political-orientation, pragmatism dominated among transmigrators. What benefited transmigrators was good—right-and-wrong depended largely on which-side you sat.

Distantly, a large fishing-boat was unfurling sails, heading west. This was *Deng Yingzhou*—on its third shipping-run. Since first Guangzhou-trip, this ship had barely stopped—bringing back massive Industrial-Department-needed materials. Fishing-1 protected it in Bopu-vicinity—beyond that, they were on their own. Chen Haiyang sighed: material-lacking navies—however modern—had limited-effect.

"Attention! 3 nautical-miles ahead—three large fishing-boats spotted—no flags!" Lookout Le Lin suddenly shouted. A Hong-Konger, fanatical military-enthusiast especially loving navy. Since joining, he daily wore civilian-version US-Navy uniform.

"Hard-starboard, heading 120. Ahead-two, close in." Chen Haiyang issued orders. Fishing-1, previously at slow-ahead, turned bow toward the boats.

Such inspections occurred multiple times daily before. As unflagged-boats got catches confiscated, unflagged-fishing nearly disappeared. Three appearing at once made Chen Haiyang suspicious:

"Sound battle-stations! Prepare boarding-inspection!"

As ship's-bells rang, thirty-plus crew rapidly took positions, donning steel-helmets, fire-retardant combat-suits—this era's Chinese coastal-warfare commonly used arson. Weapons readied. Fishing-1 had no heavy-weapons like cannons. Basic-firepower was SKS-rifle volleys by crew. Recently improved: though Industrial-Department lacked metals, wood, bamboo, rattan, and hides were plentiful. Plus Lin Shenhe—claimed to have played with every weapon except nukes—joining. Soon, from references, they'd replicated several Ballistae.

Ballista was ancient-Rome's most successful large-crossbow—world's most famous mechanical-crossbow. Strictly speaking, not a crossbow—propulsion came not from bow-body but from twisted-torsion springs on both sides. Ballista's nickname: "Shield-Piercer"—its giant-bolts easily penetrated any known shield or armor. A qualified Ballista had 500m killing-range; within 200m could penetrate 2-inch uniform wooden-boards. At its peak, Roman legions had 50+ Ballistae each.

Transmigration-Navy's mechanical-crossbows structurally resembled ancient-Roman Ballistae—perhaps inferior. Best Roman Ballistae used extensive steel and bronze—unlike stingy transmigrators. So transmigration-version was heavier. Slightly-advanced: it had 360° rotating-platform with low protective-parapet, providing shooters some basic-protection.

Fishing-1 mounted two such crossbows—fore and aft decks. Navy's sea-trials showed: at 500m, hitting anything was pure luck. At 200m, accuracy improved significantly.

Fortunately, this era's Chinese coastal-vessels weren't much better-armed. As long as transmigration-Navy didn't foolishly try dominating seas with crossbows—for coastal anti-piracy and intimidating merchant/fishing-boats, they sufficed. After all, they had better ammunition than Romans.

"Prepare Round-2!" Gunnery-officer ordered.

"Round-2 ready!" A large-firecracker-like thing was loaded onto the Ballista.

Seeing Fishing-1 approach, three boats hurriedly turned sails—apparently fleeing. Ship's loudspeaker played pre-recorded multi-dialect and Mandarin recording: ordering immediate sail-drop, accepting inspection.

After broadcast, boats' sails indeed dropped. People scurried chaotically between decks and cabins.

"Prepare boarding."

This was routine. Boarding-teams donned life-vests—each with pistol and machete—lined at ship's-rail awaiting orders.

"Board." On command, five team-members leaped over the rail, landing on the opposite-deck. Before steadying themselves—cannon-thunder erupted.
