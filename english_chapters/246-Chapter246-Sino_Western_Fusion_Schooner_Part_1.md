# Chapter 246: The Hybrid Schooner (Part 1)

The assessment results were in. Fifteen or sixteen men with shipbuilding skills, including the clan head, were retained at Bopu as shipyard staff. They were to live in the newly constructed Baitu Village with their families. However, Wu De rejected their request to live together as a clan; instead, he enforced strict regulations: all adult married men must establish their own households and register their residency separately.

Wu De further refined the regulations: within each household registration, a maximum of three generations were allowed. The first two generations were restricted to one couple each. When the third generation married, they had to establish a separate household. Married brothers were strictly prohibited from remaining in the same household.

The separated small households were then distributed into various standard residential buildings, with a maximum of two families from the same clan allowed per building.

The remaining Lin clan members were relocated to the Bairen Commune residential area, scattered in a similar fashion, and assigned as general laborers. In this way, the Lin family, once one of the two ruling families of Baitu Village, was effectively dismantled. Clan Head Lin Xianming lost his former prestige and could only work as a regular staff member at the shipyard. Every household owed the Transmigration Group sixty taels of silver for housing—a sum many Lin clan members could actually afford, but none dared to reveal their wealth for fear that the "Short-haired thieves" would confiscate it.

While the older Lin clan members, having witnessed the brutality of government officials, were submissive to Lingao's power, the younger generation, who had grown up in the lawless environment of Baitu Village, harbored considerable resentment. This was especially true for those from the core branches who had enjoyed high status since childhood; they held a deep grudge over their lost prestige. Most unacceptable to them was the fact that members of side branches—who usually held low status in the clan—became salaried shipyard staff simply because they worked harder and possessed better skills.

Lin Gonglao naturally missed out on the staff ranks. Since he was unmarried, he remained under his father's household registration, but his status was reduced to that of a "commune member," forcing him to do odd jobs every day to earn work points.

Staff members received monthly salaries and high income; commune members worked as coolies, doing hard, tiring labor. He couldn't stand the disparity.

A cousin who usually hung out with him spoke up, "Big Brother, say something—what exactly is Uncle thinking? Is our Lin family just going to scatter like this?!"

"What else can we do?" A young man squatting on the ground with a drooping head muttered. "They are capable—"

Lin Gonglao's brother, Lin Gongxun, kicked him fiercely. "You scum of the Lin family! Coward! I doubt if you are even a seed of the Lin family! How can you say such things?"

"But—" The beaten man seemed used to being a punching bag and dared not resist, only muttering, "Isn't it true we can't beat them?"

"Bullshit! Don't they just have better weapons, some bird guns? In hand-to-hand combat, I can beat seven or eight of these softies alone!" Lin Gongxun said aggressively, stealing a glance at a sentry not far away. The crowd seemed unsatisfied; seeing the surrounding sentries and short-haired "cadres" not interfering, they cursed even more vigorously.

"Exactly, Big Brother and Second Brother's kung fu isn't for show."

"Winning by relying on firearms doesn't count as being a hero!"

"Without firearms, one-on-one, we'd beat them until they look for their teeth on the ground!"

"One-on-one is bullying them. I don't dare say too many, but I can take three."

"Look at their shabby appearance; their clothes can't even cover their asses."

"Our Lin family's heroes are all red-blooded men!"

"The Lin family doesn't have a coward like you! Must be a bastard!"

...

It started quietly, then grew louder. It seemed everyone's anger was being vented on the unlucky defeatist. Filthy language mixed with punches and kicks landed on him, and the man hurriedly scrambled away.

At this time, a nephew of Lin Gonglao named Lin Guangding squeezed over and whispered, "Uncle Gonglao, tell everyone to stop cursing. Walls have ears."

This was meant with good intentions, but Lin Gonglao scolded him, "You are also a wretch! A gutless coward. The Aussies are all overseas barbarians. I'll curse them to their faces; they don't understand." Saying this, he loudly shouted seven or eight obscenities in the Minnan dialect at a "True Kun" in the distance. Sure enough, the other party looked at him without any reaction, and the surrounding Lin clan descendants cheered.

"Good! Brother Gonglao is indeed formidable!"

"The Aussies are all wretches! Dare not even fart."

"The Aussies dare not offend our Lin family; shipbuilding depends on Great Uncle!"

Lin Guangding wanted to remonstrate further. "Uhh, Uncle Gonglao, among the long-term workers working for them, there are people from our place—"

"Hmph, what's there to fear from a few traitors?" Lin Gonglao suddenly felt powerful and fearless. "I can crush them with one finger."

While he was bragging, Lin Xianming rushed over and scolded in a low voice, "Are you seeking death! What nonsense are you spouting?" He carefully looked around. "Think our Lin family hasn't been exterminated enough?"

Lin Gonglao obviously wasn't convinced and wanted to raise his voice to argue.

"Shut up! Everyone disperse and go back!" Lin Xianming dragged his son to a desolate spot.

"Speak less of such boundless big talk in the future!" Lin Xianming instructed in a hushed tone. "This group of Short-haired thieves is formidable."

"Dad, sooner or later they will be wiped out by the surrounding sea lords. Even if the sea lords can't wipe them out, if we send someone to report to the officials, the Imperial Court will suppress them. Once the grand army arrives—"

Speaking of this, he received a heavy knuckle rap on his head. "Imperial Court? What does the Imperial Court have to do with us! Without the Imperial Court, we were living just fine guarding our ancestral graves in Fujian!" Lin Xianming softened his tone. "The... Short-hairs are passable too. They provide houses, pay wages, and don't make us work for free. We common folks, whoever becomes the Emperor, we have to pay grain and taxes. Having food, clothes, and shelter is enough. Don't cause trouble for me!"

Seeing his son finally fall silent, Lin Xianming added, "How old are you? Not knowing the height of the sky and the depth of the earth! Since when has the government ever been good? Just go work honestly. When the time comes, I'll find a way to get you into the shipyard as a staff member. The Short-hairs still value your father quite a bit."

Lin Gonglao muttered a few sentences. His thoughts were different from his father's. Lin Xianming only sought to lead the clan to live peacefully in troubled times. Lin Gonglao, however, still possessed a young man's desire for power, constantly missing the good days when the Lin family was the local tyrant in Baitu and he, as the village head's son, could order people around.

In contrast, the Lu family's backlash was much smaller. Firstly, their population was smaller, and Lu Youtian was a pragmatist who had no doubts about the transmigrators' policies. He immediately had his clansmen register separately; even his unmarried son, Lu Shouyong, registered a separate household. His only request was to keep his son, an apprentice blacksmith who hadn't finished his training, by his side to continue teaching him the craft. He saw the Lin family's fate; all unskilled Lin descendants were counted as basic labor. It seemed clear that without a craft, one would suffer under the Short-hairs.

Since the Lu family males were all blacksmiths, they were divided into two batches after assessment according to technical skill. Most were assigned to Bairen City to become workers in the machinery factory, while a few remained at Bopu as shipyard ironworkers. Because Lu Youtian was sensible and the Lu family had fewer people, no descendants were relegated to basic labor to earn work points. Those with skills too poor to be staff entered the apprentice team, distributed in the shipyard and machinery factory, learning to be the fitters and metallurgists of the new era.

Lu Youtian stayed in Bopu and became the master craftsman of the shipyard's ironwork workshop. Shipbuilding required a large number of iron parts. Since Wen Desi couldn't yet figure out all the specific crafts of European-style shipbuilding, many Chinese shipbuilding techniques and methods were continued during construction.

Before the New Year, Wen Desi led several mechanical professionals to draw a complete lines plan and structural drawings for the new ship. Although rough, it provided a basis for construction.

Shortly after the first day of the New Year, the shipyard laid the keel under Wen Desi's guidance. The keel was placed on the keel blocks in the dry dock, and the stem and stern posts were inlaid at both ends. This was an arduous task, completed only with the help of the Construction Company's truck crane. At this time, Wen Desi realized he hadn't installed hoisting equipment for the dock, so he rushed to build several indigenous derricks.

Then the floor timbers were placed transversely on the keel, and the keelson was placed on top of them, running along the length of the keel. The keelson, floor timbers, and keel were bolted together. The floor timbers were straight except for the ends, where the timber began to curve upward. The futtocks were closely connected to the floor timbers—these were the curved ribs that formed the sides of the sailboat. Bending the ship timber to the design angle without damaging its structural integrity cost Wu Kuangming a lot of brain cells. Fortunately, with the steam boiler, this process became fast and effective.

All ribs were installed very compactly, double-layered in the middle part of the ship and near the masts where stress would be highest. Heavy thick planks (clamps) were arranged horizontally on the inner side of the ribs to support the ends of the deck beams. The mast partners had reinforcement plates made of sturdy ironwood, inserted vertically between deck beams and fastened with bolts to support the mast, while the heel of the mast stood on the keelson. This frame was further clamped together with the vertical timbers behind the main beam, the through-beam timbers, and the horizontal timbers.

During construction, scaffolding was erected around the hull to facilitate the shipwrights' work. The outer planks were fixed to the ship's ribs with bolts. To prevent leakage, a large amount of kapok was used as caulking—this natural fiber was almost water-impermeable and had great buoyancy. All seams were sealed with a mixture of tung oil, hemp fibers, and oyster shell ash according to the traditional Chinese caulking method. A layer of wood tar was also applied to both the inner and outer hulls.

The internal structure followed Chinese design principles, installing watertight bulkheads. Since this ship wasn't built as a dedicated warship and wasn't intended to be equipped with a heavy broadside battery, a full lower gun deck was unnecessary.
