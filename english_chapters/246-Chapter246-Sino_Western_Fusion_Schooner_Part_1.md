# Chapter 246 - Sino-Western Ancient-Modern Fusion Two-Masted Schooner (Part 1)

The assessment result was that fifteen or sixteen males with shipbuilding skills, including the clan head, stayed at Bopu as shipyard staff and lived in the newly built Baitu Village with their families. This group of shipyard staff could not live together in the name of a big clan; Wu De rejected their request to live together: all adult married men must set up their own households and register their residency separately.

Wu De further refined the regulations: within each household registration, a maximum of three generations were allowed to exist. The first two generations were each allowed one couple. When the third generation married, they had to set up a separate household. Married brothers were prohibited from remaining in the same household.

The split small households were then mixed into various standard residential buildings, with a maximum of two families from the same clan allowed per standard residential building.

The remaining Lin clan members were all moved to Bopu. After being scattered in the same way, they lived separately in the residential area of the Bairen Commune and were used as basic labor. In this way, the Lin family, one of the two ruling families of Baitu Village, was completely dismantled. Clan Head Lin Xianming also lost his original prestige and could now only go to work at the shipyard—every household of theirs owed the Transmigration Group sixty taels of silver for housing purchase. In fact, many Lin clan members could afford this money, but none dared to reveal their wealth, fearing these "short-haired thieves" would rob them.

If the older Lin clan members were submissive to Lingao's strong power, the Transmigration Group, because they had seen the brutality of the government offices, then the young descendants who grew up in the lawless zone of Baitu Village had considerable objections. Especially those from the close branches who had been in the upper stratum of the village since childhood; they held a grudge over their lost prestige. The most unacceptable thing was: side branches who usually had low status in the clan became shipyard staff because they worked more and were skilled.

Lin Gonglao naturally missed out on the ranks of the staff, but since he hadn't married yet, he could stay under his father's household registration. However, his status became a "commune member" who had to go out every day to do odd jobs to earn work points.

Staff members received monthly salaries and had high income; commune members just worked as coolies every day, doing hard and tiring work. He couldn't stand this alone.

A cousin who usually hung out with him spoke up: "Big Brother, say something—what exactly does Uncle think? Is our Lin family just going to scatter like this?!"

"What else can we do?" A guy squatting on the ground with a drooping head said, "They are capable—"

Lin Gonglao's brother, Lin Gongxun, kicked him fiercely: "You scum of the Lin family! Coward! I doubt if you are a seed of the Lin family! How can you say such things?"

"But—" The guy who got beaten seemed to be a punching bag and dared not resist, only muttering, "Isn't it true we can't beat them?"

"Bullshit! Don't they just have better weapons, some fowling pieces? In hand-to-hand combat, I can beat seven or eight of these pussies alone!" The beater said aggressively, stealing a glance at the sentry not far away. The crowd seemed unsatisfied; seeing the surrounding sentries and short-haired "cadres" not interfering, they cursed even more vigorously.

"Exactly, Big Brother and Second Brother's kung fu isn't for show."

"Winning by relying on firearms doesn't count as being a hero!"

"Without firearms, one-on-one, we'd beat them until they look for their teeth on the ground!"

"One-on-one is bullying them. I don't dare say too many, but I can take three."

"Look at their shabby appearance; their clothes can't even cover their asses."

"Our Lin family's heroes are all bloody men!"

"The Lin family doesn't have a coward like you! Must be a bastard!"

...

It started quietly, then got louder and louder. It seemed everyone's anger was vented on this unlucky guy. Filthy language mixed with punches and kicks landed on him, and this person hurriedly "rolled out" scrambling.

At this time, a nephew of Lin Gonglao named Lin Guangding squeezed over and whispered: "Uncle Gonglao, tell everyone to stop cursing. Beware that walls have ears."

This was originally out of good intentions, but Lin Gonglao scolded: "You are also a wretch! A balls-less thing. The Aussies are all overseas barbarians. I'll curse them to their faces; they don't understand." Saying this, he loudly shouted seven or eight obscenities in Minnan dialect at a "True Australian" in the distance. Sure enough, the other party looked at him without any reaction, and the surrounding Lin clan descendants cheered.

"Good! Brother Gonglao is indeed formidable!"

"The Aussies are all wretches! Dare not even fart."

"The Aussies dare not offend our Lin family; shipbuilding depends on Great Uncle!"

Lin Guangding wanted to remonstrate further: "Uhh, Uncle Gonglao, among the long-term workers working for them, there are people from our place—"

"Hmph, what's there to fear from a few traitors?" Lin Gonglao suddenly felt he was very powerful and feared nothing. "I can crush them with one finger."

While he was bragging, Lin Xianming rushed over and scolded in a low voice: "Are you seeking death! What nonsense are you spouting?" He carefully looked around. "Think our Lin family hasn't been exterminated enough?"

Lin Gonglao obviously wasn't quite convinced and wanted to raise his voice to say something.

"Shut up! Everyone disperse and go back!" Saying this, he dragged his son to a desolate place.

"Speak less of such boundless big talk in the future!" Lin Xianming instructed in a low voice. "This group of short-haired thieves is formidable."

"Dad, sooner or later they will be wiped out by the surrounding sea lords. Even if the sea lords can't wipe them out, if we send someone to report to the officials, the Imperial Court will also suppress them. Once the grand army arrives—"

Speaking of this, he received a heavy knuckle rap on his head: "Imperial Court? What does the Imperial Court have to do with us! Without the Imperial Court, we were living just fine guarding our ancestral graves in Fujian!" Lin Xianming softened his tone as he spoke, "The... Short-hairs are passable too. They give houses to live in, give wages, and don't make us work for free. We common folks, whoever becomes the Emperor, we have to pay grain and taxes. Having food, clothes, and shelter is enough. Don't you cause trouble for me!"

Seeing his son finally stop talking, Lin Xianming said: "How old are you? Not knowing the height of the sky and the depth of the earth! Since when is the government any good? Just go work for me honestly. When the time comes, I'll naturally find a way to get you into the shipyard as a staff member. The Short-hairs still value your father quite a bit."

Lin Gonglao muttered a few sentences. His thoughts were different from his father's. Lin Xianming only sought to lead the clan to live peacefully in troubled times. Lin Gonglao still had a young man's desire for power, constantly missing the good days when the Lin family was the local tyrant in Baitu and he, as the village head's son, ordered people around.

In contrast, the Lu family's backlash was much smaller. Firstly, their population was smaller, and Lu Youtian was a very pragmatic person who had no doubts about the Transmigrators' policies. He immediately had his clansmen register separately; even his unmarried son Lu Shouyong registered a separate household. His request was simple: keep his son, an apprentice blacksmith who hadn't finished his apprenticeship, by his side to continue teaching him the craft—he saw the Lin family's fate; all unskilled Lin descendants were counted as basic labor. It seemed that without a craft, one would definitely suffer under the Short-hairs.

Since the Lu family males were all blacksmiths, after assessment, they were divided into two batches according to technical level. Most were assigned to Bairen City to become workers in the machinery factory, and a few remained at Bopu as shipyard ironworkers. Because Lu Youtian was sensible and the Lu family had fewer people, no descendants were relegated to basic labor to earn work points. Those with skills too poor to be staff entered the apprentice team, distributed in the shipyard and machinery factory, learning to be fitters and metallurgists of the new era.

Lu Youtian stayed in Bopu and became the foreman craftsman of the shipyard's ironwork workshop. Shipbuilding required a large number of iron parts. Since Wen Desi couldn't yet figure out all the specific crafts of European-style shipbuilding, many Chinese shipbuilding techniques and methods were still continued during construction.

Before the New Year, Wen Desi led several mechanical professionals to draw a complete lines plan and structural drawings for various parts of this ship. Although very rough, it at least counted as a basis for shipbuilding.

Shortly after the first day of the New Year, the shipyard laid the keel under Wen Desi's guidance. The keel was placed on the keel blocks in the dry dock, and the stem and stern posts were inlaid at both ends of the keel. This was a very arduous task, completed only with the help of the Construction Company's truck crane. At this time, Wen Desi realized he hadn't installed hoisting equipment for the dock, so he rushed to build several indigenous derricks.

Then the floor timbers (bottom ribs) were placed transversely on the keel, and the keelson was placed on the floor timbers along the keel. The keelson, floor timbers, and keel were connected to each other with bolts. The floor timbers were straight except for the ends. The timber at the ends began to curve, that is, rise upward. The futtocks were closely connected to the floor timbers. These were curved or arched ribs that formed the curved sides of the sailboat. Bending the ship timber to the design angle without damaging its strength cost Wu Kuangming a lot of brain cells. Fortunately, with the boiler, this process became fast and effective.

All ribs were installed very compactly, and they were double-layered in the middle part of the ship and near the masts—these areas would be subjected to huge stresses. Heavy thick planks (clamps) were arranged horizontally on the inner side of the ribs to support the ends of the deck beams. The mast partners had reinforcement plates made of sturdy ironwood, inserted vertically between deck beams and fastened with bolts to support the mast, while the heel of the mast stood on the keelson. This frame was further clamped together with the vertical timbers behind the main beam, the through-beam timbers, and the horizontal timbers behind the beam.

During the construction process, scaffolding was erected around the hull to facilitate the shipwrights' work. The outer planks were fixed to the ship's ribs with bolts. To prevent water leakage, a large amount of kapok was used as caulking—this natural fiber was almost impermeable to water and had great buoyancy. All seams were sealed with a mixture of tung oil, hemp fibers, and oyster shell ash according to the Chinese caulking method. A layer of wood tar was also applied to the inner and outer hulls of the ship.

The internal structure of the ship followed the Chinese ship structure, installing watertight bulkhead compartments—since this ship wasn't built as a warship and wasn't intended to be equipped with many cannons, a flush lower deck was unnecessary.
