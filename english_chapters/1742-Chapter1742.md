# Chapter 1742:

Around the first watch, silence had already fallen over Guangzhou City. Since the "Australian Army" entered the city, the night curfew, which had been somewhat loose, was tightened again. The notices posted all over the city by the Australian Yamen explicitly stipulated that after the beating of the watch, no one was allowed to walk on the streets at night unless they held a road pass.

As soon as the sun set, the Detective Brigade, led by several "Australian Police," patrolled everywhere, urging the "street watchmen" to close the street gates. Residents and shops on both sides of the main streets also received orders from the tithing heads to hang lanterns outside their doors after dark. The lights were dim, swaying under the eaves. Under the weak light, large printed notices for reassuring the people posted on the walls at each street intersection could be seen.

Gallows that the citizens of Guangzhou had never seen before were erected at the main road intersections in the city, with several corpses hanging on them, swaying slowly in the weak light of the lanterns. Paper signs were hung around their necks, with crimes like "Robber" and "Thief" written in ink. Criminals caught were hung up without even passing the night.

For the citizens of Guangzhou, these few days were uneasy. However, since entering the city, the Fubo Army had strict discipline and committed no crimes against the people, leaving a deep impression on them. By the second day after the city was broken, the market had largely recovered.

However, following the traditional concept of going out less and showing face less in times of turmoil, every household turned off lights and slept as soon as the watch was beaten. In this silent dark night, a lamp was still lit in a side courtyard deep in a residence in the west of the city.

Bamboo curtains covered the windows and doors tightly, revealing only a little dim light, but the hall was brightly lit. A middle-aged man leaned on a purple sandalwood couch in the room. He looked very wealthy. Being at home in the inner residence, he dressed very casually, wearing a Daoist robe made of Western cloth, a mesh gauze on his head, and a pair of purple silk-bordered Chenqiao straw sandals. Leaning on a large Nanjing satin bolster, holding a Xiangfei bamboo pipe with a Han jade mouthpiece in his hand, he smoked silently. The blue-white smoke drifted ethereally, just like his thoughts, swaying and not knowing where to go.

Two maids, one standing behind him and one kneeling in front of him, gently massaged his legs and shoulders. However, this did not seem to make him feel comfortable. On the Japanese lacquer small table in front of him, various exquisite "snacks" were placed, but they looked untouched. The Hangzhou pre-Qingming tea in the teacup, which cost several taels of silver for one tael, was completely cold.

A man dressed like a private adviser sat diagonally opposite, looking at him with some fear. It was really the first time he encountered his own employer being "at his wits' end."

On the table between them lay a notice. The paper and ink of the notice were still new, showing it hadn't been posted long. The vulgar Song typeface on it indicated its origin: the Australians who had recently entered the city.

"Master, the night is deep. Tomorrow..." The adviser probably felt too much time had passed and couldn't help breaking the silence in the room.

The middle-aged man called "Master" was none other than Mo Rongxin, the manager of Wenlan Academy.

The notice was sent by Shi Tidi, the accounting adviser of his academy. Although Shi Tidi was the accounting adviser of Wenlan Academy, he was actually Mo Rongxin's private man. Mo Rongxin usually didn't go to the academy. All the academy's property revenue and expenditure were handled by this Advisor Shi. Naturally, besides Master Mo, he was the one most concerned about the income and expenditure of Wenlan Academy's properties—not only did he have a remuneration of one hundred and twenty taels of silver every year, but various false accounts and kickbacks could also net him five or six hundred taels a year. This was a very large sum of money!

Today, the shopkeepers of more than ten shops on Chengxuan Street who rented Wenlan Academy's frontage came to find him, bringing this notice: The Australians had posted notices everywhere, ordering the demolition of sheds on Chengxuan Street within twelve hours.

Calling them sheds, what these families built were long no longer "sheds." They were almost "houses." Not to mention that building them cost a lot of money, if demolished, the shop space would be much smaller. Besides being inconvenient for business, many tools and goods would have to find another place to be stored. The shopkeepers had no ideas, so they came to the landlord to ask for a solution.

Shi Tidi naturally had no ideas either. In the past, if there was something difficult, he could take the employer's card to the county or prefecture yamen to have a "chat" with the clerks or advisers, and spend some silver to solve it. Now that the officials had changed, the set of procedures he was familiar with was all gone. He didn't even know where the yamen door opened. In panic, he had to come to Mo Rongxin to think of a way.

"What can we do? No way to do anything!" Mo Rongxin puffed out a mouthful of smoke, put the dry pipe aside, and turned sideways to get up. The maid beside him hurriedly supported his arm, using all her strength to help him up.

Mo Rongxin picked up the cold tea and took a big gulp, sighing: "Now the Australians have just entered the city, and this Official Liu is a new official taking office. You want to block what they want to do? That's seeking death! You go tell them, those who want to hang themselves can go by themselves tomorrow, I'm not going to be their cushion!"

Shi Tidi gave two dry laughs and said: "Master is right. But Wenlan Academy has quite a few shops on Chengxuan Street. If the sheds are all demolished, the loss will not be small. If there is a way to mediate, they are willing to spend some money to deal with it."

"They are willing, but I am not," Mo Rongxin said. "Now the hair-thieves are worrying about having no one jump out to be the cushion so they can kill someone to establish authority. Whoever wants to earn this glory can go!"

Shi Tidi wasn't reconciled to letting the opportunity to take benefits slip away, and continued to instigate: "Master, should we discuss this matter with Master Gao of Guan Di Temple?"

This was the most powerful "trump card" in Mo Rongxin's hand. In several major crises, he relied on the Guan Di Temple people to come forward and settle them. Although he bore the ugly name of "beggar's relative by marriage" for this, the benefits were considerable.

"You think it's easy!" Mo Rongxin said, "The hair-thieves aren't fools. Once the Guan Di Temple people come out, they will immediately think we are playing tricks. If they can't deal with the Guan Di Temple people, isn't it a piece of cake to deal with us?"

"So..." Shi Tidi was somewhat disappointed—seeing that this sum of "gratitude money" couldn't be obtained.

"You go tell the shopkeepers: Don't blindly look for connections. Just honestly demolish it yourselves, at least you can recover some capital. If those black-hearted runners start tomorrow, guaranteed not even a brick will be left. It's getting late, you rest here tonight and go early tomorrow morning. Go."

Seeing the employer issuing the eviction order, Shi Tidi had to stand up to take his leave. Mo Rongxin suddenly thought of something and asked: "How is the academy recently?"

"These days the heavy-hair thieves entered the city, the Headmaster, students, etc., haven't come to the academy. The students living in the academy are also quiet."

"You watch the head cook closely. Don't let him just know how to eat and take for himself, making the academy's meals like pig feed. Starting tomorrow, the meals must have meat every day—not just boiling some bones and chicken racks to count as meat, but whole chickens, ducks, and fish! Rice must be enough! Do you understand?!"

"Yes, yes." Shi Tidi was startled. He also had a share in the deduction of food expenses.

"Don't lose the big for the small. Are those sour scholars easy to deal with? Messing around like this, they have long been full of complaints." Mo Rongxin calmly fanned himself, deciding to "enlighten" him properly today, "Now that the Australians act as the Emperor, we must guard against them seizing the opportunity to make trouble. At that time, I won't know anything..."

Shi Tidi hurriedly said: "Student understands. I will arrange it when I go back tomorrow."

In another courtyard of the same residence, Mo Rongxin's fifth daughter-in-law, Gao Huichun, was sitting alone in her room doing embroidery. She was a young woman in her twenties and had been married into the Mo family for five years. Before dinner tonight, she heard the maid come to report that the Fifth Master had something to do tonight and would rest in the outer study, asking her not to wait for him to go to bed. Although she showed no expression at the time, she was very unhappy in her heart. She knew her husband was resting in a maid's room again.

Officials and wealthy people all had several concubines. Even her father, the beggar chief commanding the beggars, had several concubines. Her father not only had more than ten women around him but also often went to flower boats to seek pleasure, not returning all night.

When she was betrothed to the Mo family, although she was happy to marry into a "scholarly family," she was somewhat unhappy when she heard that her future husband already had a tongfang maid (maid sharing the bed).

At the beginning of the marriage, they were quite affectionate. However, as time went by, especially after she failed to give birth to an heir, her husband's affection gradually waned, and the days he stayed in her room became fewer and fewer. If it weren't for her father-in-law forcing his son to come to her room every few days because of her father's face, fearing that the young couple falling out would be detrimental to the relationship between the two sides, it would be considered good if he came two or three days a month.

Not returning tonight, she understood in her heart: He used the excuse of having something to do to spend a spring night with the maid he recently hooked up with.

In this so-called "scholarly family," the father-in-law Mo Rongxin himself was a greedy and lustful person, keeping four or five thirteen-year-old maids around him for pleasure all year round; the sons were no less than their father, each with groups of wives and concubines, and they still visited brothels and flower boats... Although her husband was the fifth son born of a concubine and had no status in the family, he also got several maids in his room.

As the legitimate wife, she refused to reveal her "pettiness" about this matter before the maids "got close," but a different kind of pain lingered in her heart that she couldn't get rid of, thinking: "It's really bitter to be a woman. Such things happen before one is old and beauty fades!" Talking with the maids and listening to the blind girl singing did not reduce the pain in her heart.

The watch had already been beaten outside. She put down the embroidery in her hand, listening to the desolate sound of the watch clapper outside, thinking of her own encounter, and then thinking of the various encounters in this big family over the past five years. It was truly a mixture of all flavors. Her eyes soured uncontrollably, and she almost shed tears.

But she didn't dare to let out a sigh, and even swallowed the sobbing sound, lest the maids close to her hear it and create more trouble.
