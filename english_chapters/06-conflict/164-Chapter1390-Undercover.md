# Chapter 1390 - Undercover

However, Zhao Tong's inquiries were not entirely fruitless. He learned from Canal Gang personnel that those recently active in Hangzhou spreading rumors and placards were mostly members of "brawling societies" from Hangzhou and nearby prefectures and counties.

"Brawling societies" had no conflict of interest with Zhao Yingong; their participation was clearly because someone paid to hire them.

Zhao Tong suggested pursuing investigation deeply through this opening.

"Pity we are not a yamen here, otherwise detaining a few leaders from inside and interrogating strictly would definitely yield news of the mastermind behind scenes." Zhao Tong said with some regret.

Secretly kidnapping people and setting up private court for interrogation was of course possible, but right now was an eventful autumn. One's every move was probably monitored by someone in the dark. Once rashly kidnapping opponent's members leaked, it would instead become opponent's excuse.

Taking a step back, even if opponent didn't know or didn't care about members' safety, ordinary members kidnapped might not necessarily be able to tell any useful news.

However, brawling societies were definitely a breakthrough point. Zhao Yingong considered again and again, suddenly thinking of Zhuang Haoren.

Zhuang Haoren was now head of "Wulong Society." Zhao Yingong thought, Wulong Society's relationship with Phoenix Mountain Villa was still kept secret. Now except Zhuang Haoren himself and very few naturalized citizen backbones of Hangzhou Station, no one knew this brawling society was actually raised by him, Zhao Yingong. Zhao Yingong had also used Wulong Society many times, but superficially it was a relationship of hiring with money, not subordination.

"You go see him, ask him to find ways through brawling society connections to mix into enemy group, try to investigate mastermind behind scenes!"

Zhao Yingong's method was simple: since couldn't pull out, could only hit in. Wulong Society as one of brawling societies active in Hangzhou, scale neither big nor small, having its own "territory" as well as considerable basic personnel. In several Hangzhou Prefecture brawls it showed impressive "combat power."

If opponent wanted to take further big actions, they would inevitably recruit more people—especially "brawling societies" with certain organization and combat power, which were opponent's first choice. Wulong Society would most likely fall into their selection range. Zhuang Haoren's current public identity was Wulong Society leader. Opponent would definitely pull him into partnership.

Zhao Tong shook his head: "Chief, this is inappropriate."

"Oh? Why."

"You are asking him to go undercover," Zhao Tong said, "Since ancient times, undercover people not only risk danger personally, once secret leaked, bound to die violently—leaving this aside; even if able to retire safely, will still be regarded as heartless and unrighteous person in future, equivalent to ruined reputation. Those sent undercover, if not caught by handle forcing obedience, must have received kindness thick as heaven and earth. Zhuang Haoren occupies neither. You send him undercover, he will definitely perfunctory with snake. Definitely unwilling to exert death effort."

Zhao Tong had another layer unspoken: Zhuang Haoren wasn't naturalized citizen, just peripheral member of Hangzhou Station, hadn't passed Political Security Bureau's reliability assessment. Asking him to go fighting and killing, executing simple work was fine, but such matter involving life and death survival of Hangzhou Station couldn't be done by non-naturalized citizen.

Zhao Yingong considered again and again, asking: "Zhao Tong, do you think enemy has planted spies here with us?"

This question was of grave importance. Although Sun Wangcai was general manager cum security captain in this villa, Zhao Tong was specifically responsible for internal security work. He considered a minute before answering: "Chief, saying not a single one, that's impossible. But inside villa residence, I dare guarantee not a single one."

Zhao Yingong nodded. People able to enter villa's residence part were either naturalized citizens or orphans Zhao Yingong took in. Even Cai Shi and other local servants very useful before Zhao Yingong—their backgrounds had been investigated clearly by Hangzhou Station Security Department people—still couldn't enter inner residence. When Zhao Yingong wanted to see them, it was always coming to outer study.

Attempts to plant spies in villa and bookshop had been discovered many times by Hangzhou Station Security Department: Some were brazen, directly gifting handsome servant boys or beautiful maids or recommending pure guests secretaries; some were carried out secretly, attempting to mix into villa and bookshop through means like "selling oneself," "responding to recruitment."

"Is Xihua doing well in refugee camp?" Zhao Yingong suddenly asked.

Xihua was one of the six older children above twelve whom Zhao Yingong took in earliest and personally taught and nurtured. She was fifteen this year. Because she was capable and decisive in doing things, she was specially assigned to do general affairs work in "Orphan Hall" of Cihui Hall.

Zhao Tong was startled, reporting back: "Handling affairs capability good, acting fairly too. Just—"

"Just what?"

"A bit proud and arrogant. Can't rub sand in eyes, temper also a bit violently, often making people embarrassed to face."

"Hehe, so to speak, popularity not good?"

"Yes—" Although Zhao Tong somewhat knew Chief's meaning, he didn't know why suddenly talking about this girl's character problem. These matters he had listed in the report materials of the Ten Man Group submitted up.

"Chief wants her to go undercover..."

"Exactly this intention."

Xihua was quite suitable. Although temper violent, she was bold yet cautious, organized in doing things. Most importantly: she was saved by Zhao Yingong from human trafficker's hands—otherwise sold to brothel—so-called received great kindness.

"But she works in refugee camp, how to go enemy side undercover? Moreover she is a girl, even if opponent trusts her, impossible to let her walk around everywhere inquiring news..."

"Now our adversary's most concerned thing should be what I am doing, thinking."

"Chief wants Xihua to be double agent?!" Zhao Tong received training in Political Security Bureau training class, learned quite a few professional "New Terms."

"Correct." Zhao Yingong nodded, "We want to know what enemy wants to do, enemy definitely also wants to know what we prepare to do. If there is good opportunity, definitely won't miss."

"Chief wise."

"Less bootlicking!" Zhao Yingong said seriously, "You go arrange."

A few days later, it was exactly "Visiting Day." Cihui Hall had a "Visiting Day" every month or so. Letting nominal Benevolent Directors of Cihui Hall and local gentry, scholars come to Cihui Hall to visit.

First was to let gentry who donated money see where their money went; second was also to remove suspicion. Many "religious cases" in late 19th century were stirred up by rumors because populace didn't understand church's charity cause and church held identity of foreign masters unwilling to communicate.

Such visits had many people coming at start, but recently few came—gentry's freshness had passed. Moreover right now was height of summer, scorching sun like fire. So this time only seven or eight people came, among whom one was Wu Zhixiang—he was desperately building relationship with Zhao Yingong recently.

Saying visiting Cihui Hall, actually the masters plugged noses walking looking at flowers in refugee camp down mountain—said to be many people big smell, inevitably also coal smoke smell blowing from riverside. Before seeing half the places, several masters already showed look of boredom. Cai Shi was used to serving people, best at observing words and expressions, immediately ordered sedan chair bearers to bring litter, carrying several masters one by one up Phoenix Mountain.

Mountain breeze blowing, several people instantly felt cool all over. Now was midsummer season, mountain forest dense, plus Zhao Yingong's years of greening improvement, scenery along way was pleasant.

About one li outside Villa gate, there was a patch of woods, in which a camphor tree was over hundred years old, gracefully like canopy. Zhao Yingong had ordered people to arrange a table of banquet under tree here. Incense driving away mosquitoes lit around. Just as they sat down, maids served iced towels and iced plum syrup.

"Didn't expect Master Wu to know enjoyment so well! Actually getting himself a fairy land of happiness!" Wu Zhixiang took iced towel, wiped his face refreshingly several times, drank several mouthfuls of thick hanging cup, sweet and sour palatable iced plum syrup, only feeling saliva generating under tongue, wind generating under two armpits, whole body cool for a while.

Sitting at banquet, feeling cool breeze blowing gently, looking down at Qiantang River below mountain, scenery was magnificent, mind and chest opened wide.

"I walked past this Phoenix Mountain in past too. Didn't expect a barren mountain improved by Master Zhao to such appearance. No wonder everyone says Master Zhao's learning of practical application for ordering world is deepest." Fushe member Wen Huai also echoed.

Others followed with compliments; Zhao Yingong inevitably was polite too. Immediately ordered wine and dishes served.

Because it was midsummer, everyone's appetite was poor. Dishes served all took light flavor. Dishes though many, not greasy. Many fresh fruits were also served, among which quite a few were southern fruits transported with ice preservation from Lingao. Either only heard of never seen real thing, or never had in country in this time-space. Once brought out opened everyone's eyes, praising in unison.

A maid brought a large white porcelain plate, piled full inside were fresh lychees still carrying water drops. Not only fruit skin still red, even leaves on stem were still verdant dripping, seemingly just picked.

"Master Zhao's fresh lychees here are also a Jiangnan unique." Wen Huai busily peeled one throwing in mouth, hand peeling another already, "Even Brother Zongzi has admired fame for long time."

Zhang Dai's life enjoyment was famous in Jiangnan, but this kind of industrial age enjoyment of iced fresh fruits was unobtainable no matter how much money spent at that time. Fresh lychees, except in production areas of Guangdong and Sichuan, couldn't be eaten no matter how rich or powerful you were. Even dried lychees were rare. Ming and Qing emperors noble as nine-five supreme, lychees they could eat were just fresh lychees dipped in honey then sent to Beijing; taste already different from fresh ones.

Although Zhao Yingong here had no gas cold storage to make ice, ice transport ships came from Lingao—ships departing from Lingao going north to Jiangnan, bottom holds all used artificial ice preserved in large amounts of sawdust as ballast. Specially supplied for Hangzhou Station self-use and sale. Naturally transporting iced fresh fruits was no problem.
