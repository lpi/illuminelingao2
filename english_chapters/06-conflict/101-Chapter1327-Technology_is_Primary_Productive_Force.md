# Chapter 1327 - A Visit to Fangcao Di: Technology is the Primary Productive Force

What impressed the delegation most was this: the full-time transmigrators at Fangcao Di were one and all busy from morning till night, with hardly a moment of leisure. Of course, if one looked closely, each and every transmigrator teacher—looking at students, especially female students—had somewhat bloodshot eyes.

"With the pirates being so wealthy, they still teach tirelessly—admirable indeed. We could never match them." Liu Dalin remarked to Wang Ci. This spirit of teaching and nurturing—anyone who saw it had to admire it.

"It's just that what the pir—Australians teach is entirely contrary to the sages' righteous path. As the saying goes: when the Way is crooked, the more knowledge one has, the more reactionary one becomes!" Wang Ci applied a phrase he had picked up from sitting in on classes these past days.

Liu the Successful Candidate stroked his beard, eyes closed, pondering for a moment before saying: "Although what the Australians teach is not the books of the sages, it follows the Way of the sages nonetheless. An ancient sage of Australia once said: 'All roads lead to Chang'an.' We too should not be rigidly bound by antiquity—look at this Lingao, this Qiongzhou! The common people live in peace and contentment—is this not a rare era of good governance?"

Wang Ci was unconvinced in his heart. Indeed, the Australians' arts of governing the people and managing finances were unparalleled in the world. Even if the sages were reborn, they could probably do no better. But he always felt this was too heretical: was it enough to claim one was implementing the sages' teachings just because the common people received practical benefits? If the Australians didn't use the sages' teachings to educate and govern the masses, then what use were the gentry and scholars?

A chill rose in Director Wang's heart. He ceased arguing and walked away alone, as if his soul had departed.

At the delegation's repeated insistence, they were finally granted permission to enter the library. Fangcao Di's library was limited in scale—after all, there weren't that many books that students at the elementary level could read. And the Council and Fangcao Di's educators cultivated students in a purely "materialistic" manner—meaning the knowledge they learned, read, and mastered was all oriented toward practical principles. Stories, fairy tales, and such—which occupied a large portion of children's literature—were all prohibited from publication except for a select few with "educational significance." This meant the types of books that could be collected in this library were limited. Roughly speaking, aside from textbooks, political propaganda readers, and various dictionaries, there was a large quantity of popular science books.

Even so, the scale of twenty thousand volumes left the delegation dumbstruck. In this era when printing and publishing were very backward, and books were few in variety and expensive in price, having several hundred or several thousand volumes made one a book collector. Over ten thousand books—only government offices and the imperial family could possess that. For the Australians to equip such a school with so many books in just a few years—this alone was enough to make them prostrate in awe.

In Hu Qingbai and Principal Zhang's view, this really wasn't anything special. For a nationally certified model high school with forty-two teaching classes, per-student book holdings had to meet fifty volumes; even for ordinary middle schools, at least ten volumes per student was the minimum standard. As a complete school from elementary through middle school, Fangcao Di had two hundred residence groups and six thousand students. Even by the lowest standard, it should have sixty thousand volumes—Lingao's printing industry was still far from impressive.

When he saw an entire great hall with densely packed shelves filled with books, Liu Dalin was speechless for a long time: all the books on the entire island of Hainan probably didn't add up to what was in this room. The delegation lingered here for a long time, flipping through book after book on the shelves. But they never looked at any for long before shaking their heads and putting them down—aside from a few, they found most books incomprehensible. Then looking at the students bent over reading in the reading room, Director Wang suddenly felt as if he were an illiterate peasant: so there was this much learning in the world, and what he knew was so little!

The pirates' "clever tricks and frivolous skills" that he had once disdained were creating miracle after miracle in Lingao, yet he knew nothing about any of it. He couldn't even understand the books placed before him. No wonder the Australians paid them no attention and took no precautions, allowing them to wander freely and observe at will. Thinking of this, Wang Ci painfully put down the book, unable to continue reading.

Huang Bingkun searched through many books in the library but was similarly disappointed—until he came across a large multi-volume work called *One Hundred Thousand Whys*, which he treasured like a gem. Of course, there was still much in this book that he couldn't understand, but some chapters he could comprehend.

Reading through it, he discovered that the content spanned everything from astronomy above to geography below, encompassing every conceivable field of knowledge. Most remarkably, though the language was simple and brief, it could explain all manner of things in accessible terms. Even he, who knew nothing of "Australian learning," could understand some of it. His heart leaped with joy: wasn't this the Australians' secret scripture?! With this, the pirates' secrets would be laid bare for all to see! At this point, Young Master Huang's breathing grew rapid. He wished he had a bag to hide these dozens of volumes and smuggle them out.

However, the several male and female academic affairs staff kept their eyes fixed on them throughout. Huang Bingkun watched for opportunities for a long time but was never able to successfully steal any books. He could only put them down in frustration, scheming about how to find another way to steal them.

Just as he was scheming, he noticed some students reading books while copying into small notebooks. His heart leaped with joy—since copying was allowed here, he could simply have Huang Ping come copy the books. If one person wasn't enough, at worst he could send two more boys to attend school.

That day at dinner time, Wang Ci was queuing up for food at the cafeteria and as usual got a portion for Liu Dalin the Successful Candidate. The delegation's meals were free, but the food was at the same level as that of the students and faculty—no special treatment.

The two sat down to eat. "Master Liu, these past few days have truly broadened my horizons and benefited me greatly. These Australians are truly extraordinary people."

"The Australians are indeed talented and intelligent." Liu the Successful Candidate knew Director Wang had something to say, so he offered a perfunctory response and waited for him to continue.

"Wealth and goods are the Australians' foundation! Consider, sir: this school—magnificent buildings; that library—books numbering not merely in the hundreds or thousands. Take these meals: every meal has both meat and vegetables, with ample refined rice. Our court could never accomplish this. I'm not afraid to admit to you: last year when the Australians hosted me, the ingredients were truly delicacies from mountain and sea. I, your student, nearly swallowed my tongue, ha ha."

"Do you truly think, sir, that the Australians can achieve all this merely because they are wealthy?"

"Headmaster, there are many ears here. Why don't we continue this conversation back in our dormitory?" Wang Ci saw that Liu Dalin was about to open up and feared being overheard in the cafeteria. This place was different from others—everyone here was an Australian student. If any word was misspoken, the only Successful Candidate in the history of Lingao County might be doomed beyond redemption.

But Liu Dalin waved his hand: "Oh, ho ho, no matter, no matter. This place is precisely noisy with voices, so the Australians' secret eavesdropping methods cannot be employed."

Director Wang said: "If wealth and goods are not the Australians' foundation, why do they work tirelessly, taking the accumulation of wealth as their mission? Not only do they accumulate wealth, but they are also very austere in their personal consumption..."

"Accumulating wealth is for national use." Liu Dalin spoke slowly and deliberately. "From ancient times to the present, when courts have collected taxes, promoted industry and commerce, and opened up all avenues of revenue, it has been precisely for ample national resources. What the Australians do is no different. But their foundation lies elsewhere."

"Please enlighten me, sir."

"Consider, sir: Lingao has been a county since the Tang Dynasty—that's eight or nine hundred years now. During these centuries, aside from acquiring some more fields and registered households, how much has the Ming differed from the Tang? Sir, you have also read the *Qiongtai Gazetteer* and this county's local records, so you naturally know."

"Indeed, after all, this county is a small frontier district, and with the Li people causing trouble, maintaining the current situation has been no easy matter."

"Precisely. From when the Tang established the county until now, only this modest situation has been maintained and developed. So why is it that once the Australians arrived, there has been this unprecedented great transformation?"

Wang Ci had never thought carefully about this question. The deepest impression the Australians had made on him was "lavish extravagance" and "knowing how to make money." Many things they could accomplish mainly because they could make money—like magicians, they could pull out endless streams of money and grain to sustain things.

"That's naturally because the Australians can make money." Wang Ci said. "Many beneficial policies for the county—it's not that the county wouldn't implement them, but simply that lacking money and grain, they were impossible to do."

"Ha ha," Liu Dalin gave a meaningful slight smile. "Let's not discuss that. Since they can make money—why can they make more money than others? Isn't this still Lingao County?"

This question left Director Wang dumbfounded. He had always felt the pirates were particularly good at making money, but he had never thought about why.

After pondering for a moment, he replied: "The Australians have various secret techniques..."

"Exactly!" Liu Dalin slapped the table and clapped in approval. "What Brother Wang says is correct. The Australians can make more money than others precisely because they have secret techniques that others lack." He continued: "Local farmers here—one able-bodied man with one ox can tend no more than twenty *mu* of land, and the harvest adds up to barely over a hundred *jin* per *mu* per year. Look at how the Australians farm—one person with horses, cattle, and those unknown iron contraptions can tend a hundred or more *mu*, yielding one to two thousand *jin* per *mu* per year. That is the difference."

Wang Ci's understanding suddenly became clear. He nodded: "What the headmaster says is true. Not only in farming—the Australians do everything better and produce more than the local people..."

"Correct," Liu Dalin said. "Rather than saying the Australians are good at making money, it would be better to say they can produce more grain and cloth. Moreover, they have secret methods for building ships and paving roads. Road-building is fast, ship-building is large-scale. When goods are scarce, they can be transported in from far away; when goods are abundant, they can be sold to distant places. Adjusting surplus and shortage, plenty and scarcity—there is neither grain so cheap it harms farmers, nor prices so high all things become dear. Operating this way, how could the Australians not become wealthy!"

"What the headmaster says is true!" Wang Ci nodded excitedly again and again. Liu the Successful Candidate's analysis, though simple, was extremely clear. He too had thought about this before, but never so thoroughly. Indeed, the Australians could stir up this unprecedented great transformation here precisely because they possessed all manner of "secret arts" and had "productive power" far beyond what local people could approach, didn't they?
