# Chapter 1296 Sending Off

Once a batch of ships finished unloading, the empty ships would sail to the quarantine anchorage, and all the sailors would go ashore to accept "purification" as well. Then the second batch of ships would come over to unload. All ships not yet scheduled for unloading dropped anchor and waited to be summoned.

The *Dafa* speedboat emitted black smoke as it shuttled among the ships, its loudspeakers constantly broadcasting the "Letter to All Military Personnel of Dengzhou, Laizhou, and Dongjiang".

Under the dark muzzles of the cannons, no matter how much of a tiger-wolf army they were that terrified the soldiers and civilians of Shandong, now they could only submit to capture and be at the mercy of others. Although they still had swords and spears in hand, and quite a few cannons and muskets on their ships, it was all not worth mentioning under the gun muzzles of the opponent before them.

The soldiers trapped on the ships, because of their complete powerlessness in the face of the situation, actually relaxed their nerves. Some people even fell sound asleep on the deck.

Li Jiucheng and the others were not reconciled to having everything taken away just like this. As soldiers in chaotic times, the army was their capital. Soldiers in chaotic times considered whoever had milk to be their mother; as long as they were willing to pay provisions, they didn't care who they sold their lives to.

The problem was, regardless of whether Manor Lord Lu was "Great Song" or something else, he had absolutely no intention of recruiting them. If the other party really wanted to recruit them, he should have sent an envoy to negotiate with him by now.

But the other party's current style made it clear that they were disarming and annexing his troops.

Disarming and annexing didn't matter to the soldiers, of course—as long as provisions were issued, selling their lives to anyone was the same thing. But for these generals who commanded troops with self-importance, it was simply a complete disaster. The other party treated them as nothing. From this, it could be inferred that their end would be "idle retirement" at best, or directly severed in two at worst.

They absolutely could not sit and wait for death! In order to control the ships, Li Jiucheng's trusted generals were distributed on various ships. He only kept a Central Army Guerrilla General by his side. Fortunately, the people on the ship were all his personal soldiers and family retainers, with complete armor. With one order, they were all warriors willing to go through fire and water for him.

Immediately, he called the Central Army and several trusted generals to discuss. When it was their turn for the ship to dock, they would not follow the command to approach the pier—once on the pier, with iron net towers on all four sides, it would be like fish entering a net—but instead directly charge onto the sandy beach near the pier.

Li Jiucheng had already seen clearly through his telescope that the number of enemy troops on the shore was small, at most no more than four thousand. Moreover, none of them wore armor, and some didn't even have firearms, only using long spears. Even with sturdy ships and sharp cannons, in a flurry, they might not necessarily be the opponents of his battle-hardened desperadoes. Once the beaching was successful, the rebel troops on the ships that were going ashore would inevitably riot along with it—compared to the uncertain future of being disarmed and slaughtered at will, his group of subordinates would be more willing to let go and fight for their lives.

Regardless of where this place actually was, or who the people on the island were, or how many people would die in the riot, he had twenty thousand people after all. Even if half were lost, as long as he could control the remaining army, whatever he did would be easy to discuss.

"Everyone fight to the death, let the fish die and the net break!" Li Jiucheng encouraged his subordinates, "There is plenty of silver on the ship. After fighting this battle, brothers can take whatever they want! Don't let it go to outsiders for nothing!"

"We are willing to die for the General!" The crowd responded with a boom. Subsequently, he ordered the sailors on the ship to be summoned, gave them heavy rewards of silver, and demanded they prepare to beach the ship according to orders.

"As long as we rush onto the beachhead, fifty taels per person! Otherwise, don't blame our brothers for our swords and unexpected eyes!" Li Jiucheng said viciously.

The sailors naturally dared not say the word "no".

Finally, it was the turn for their group of ships to dock. All ships had already lowered their sails and were propelled by large sculls, slowly approaching the pier. Just when the ships were very close to the pier, the sculls on one of the ships suddenly increased their frequency, and several extra sculls were put down from the ship. The ship's speed suddenly increased, the rudder turned sharply to one side, and it charged directly towards the sandy beach outside the iron wire net!

The warships of the Second Fleet had been monitoring from the side all along to maintain surveillance. They had already received orders that if any ship was found to have abnormal movements, they could open fire after one warning. A Special Service Boat closest to Li Jiucheng's flagship immediately fired a cannon to warn. Seeing the other party remain unmoved, two Special Service Boats on the warning line opened fire simultaneously. At this time, the distance was less than three hundred meters. One shell landed on the beach, kicking up a water column full of sand. The other solidly pierced the side of the flagship, penetrating the hull from one side, killing twenty-five people, and then breaking through the hull on the other side and falling into the sea.

Under the push of inertia and the tide, Li Jiucheng's flagship charged stiffly onto the beach. Li Jiucheng, fully armored and holding a large saber, immediately roared and jumped down from the ship. The surviving family retainers and personal soldiers behind him also howled and jumped down from both sides of the ship's railing. Although the tonnage of their ship was on the small side, and the distance from the bulwark to the beach after running aground was not high, jumping onto the beach wearing armor still caused many people to be injured or fall into quicksand.

In this moment of chaos, the artillery on the shore had already opened fire. Hail-like grape shot sprayed towards the grounded ship, followed by the covering fire of typewriters. The Special Service Boats on the warning line opened fire one after another, with grenades and incendiary bombs falling towards the beach.

Li Jiucheng's flagship instantly fell into a hell of rain and fire. Bullets fell like rain, black smoke billowed. In just a few minutes, the flagship was already shattered. The beach was full of burning wood chips and mutilated human bodies everywhere.

Feng Zongze picked up a handkerchief and blocked his nose—the sea breeze blew a smell of roasted meat over. Calculating what kind of meat this was, he couldn't help but feel a burst of nausea.

"Send the Jeju Island Advance Column over to search. Don't leave a single one. Cut off all heads and hang them on wooden poles!"

The Jeju Island Advance Column was entirely made up of Shandong refugees rescued during the Dengzhou mutiny. Each one hated the rebel army to the bone, and they would absolutely not go easy during the search.

The clean and efficient suppression caused the last bit of thought of rioting in the rebel generals to vanish completely. In the end, the rebel army was completely disarmed.

More than two hundred major rebel generals above the rank of squad leader were screened out after being disarmed. Except for a few generals from the Lu Army and Southern Army who originally came from the Dengzhou Garrison, the rest were escorted to the Jeju drill ground. More than ten thousand rebel prisoners were already lined up in square formations under the coercion of typewriters, Minié rifles, and the long spears of the White Horse Detachment.

Kong Youde was different from the other rebel generals. He was escorted alone into the martial arts hall of the drill ground. Watching the Koreans wearing large hats carrying trays of wine and white rice to the generals gathered on the drill ground, he knew that his life had come to an end here.

Of the generals on the drill ground, some were ashen-faced and paralyzed on the ground; some closed their eyes and said nothing, just waiting to stretch out their necks for execution; some begged bitterly; and some flew into a rage and struggled desperately.

From following his father to riot in Tieling and resist the Eastern Barbarians, to joining the army in Guangning, stepping up step by step to be a Guerrilla General; following Commander Mao to Dongjiang after the Guangning Garrison was withdrawn; the internal strife in Dongjiang after Commander Mao was beheaded; defecting to Dengzhou under Sun Yuanhua's command; reinforcing Dalinghe, and raising troops with Li Jiucheng at Wuqiao... It seemed as if scenes of his life were flashing before his eyes one by one. A thousand flavors and ten thousand kinds of sorrow surged into his heart, and he couldn't help but feel short of breath for a moment.

As a soldier, he had the awareness of death at any time. However, at this moment, he felt a trace of unwillingness. What kind of person was this Master Lu? Why did he set up layers of traps to put him and the old Dongjiang subordinates to death?

At this time, several Japanese-looking guards escorted a young man with short hair and short clothes in. Behind him, there were people carrying wine and food.

The comer poured a full cup of wine and presented it with both hands. His attitude was very polite. Kong Youde had long since placed life and death out of consideration, took the wine, and drank it in one gulp. He asked:

"Who is this gentleman?"

"I am the Prefect of Jeju Prefecture of the Great Song, Feng Zongze." Feng Zongze said, "I specially came to see the General off."

Kong Youde didn't know where this Great Song popped out from, but there was no doubt that this person was in the same gang as Master Lu.

He asked in a loud voice: "What enmity do Kong and the old people of Dongjiang have with your esteemed group?"

Feng Zongze said gravely: "We have no enmity with the General. Today I came to offer the General a cup of send-off wine. I respect the General for raising troops to oppose the Barbarians when you were young, and then following Commander Mao to struggle bitterly in the ice and snow of the Liao Sea, guarding a foot of land in Liaodong for the Great Ming."

Kong Youde didn't know what intention the other party had by bringing up old matters, but this was indeed a "glorious history" he was proud of.

"Since it is so, why put Kong and the Dongjiang officers and soldiers to death?"

Feng Zongze said: "It is not that we want to put the General to death. We greatly respect the General's majestic prestige and the earnest heart of loyalty to the Great Ming in the past. It is really that the hundreds of thousands of skeletons under Dengzhou City cannot agree." He raised his hand and pointed to the soldiers of the Peace Preservation Army Jeju Advance Column lined up in the distance: "These people are all refugees transported by Master Lu from Dengzhou. They also want to ask you: They have no enmity with you and the Dongjiang officers and soldiers, why did you slaughter their families and fellow villagers?!"

Since rising up in arms, Kong Youde had long since trained a heart of iron and stone in war. He believed in "a general's success is built on ten thousand withered bones" and never thought about the fate of those villages he ordered to be slaughtered for grain, provisions, and forced conscription. In the view of these old Ming soldiers who had already become semi-warlords, these were all matters of course. Not to mention that the soldiers didn't care, even those civil officials who came to supervise the army and command, whose mouths were full of "benevolence and righteousness", "the sovereign is light, the people are important", and "people as the foundation", often turned a blind eye to this—this was a chaotic world. Without money and grain, they still had to rely on warriors licking blood from their blade tips and fighting for their lives with swords and spears. What did killing a few commoners and robbing some money and grain count for?

"Could it be that you are a group of benevolent and righteous gentlemen?" Kong Youde asked back with a sneer.

"Since returning to the Divine Land, my Senate has taken loving and protecting the people as its purpose. Our swords never stain with the blood of the innocent! Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon can testify!" Feng Zongze said with a face full of righteousness. Speaking, he took out a document and began to read the verdict sent by the Tribunal.

Kong Youde couldn't understand much of the article which was half classical and half vernacular, and mixed with many "New Words", but he understood the final "death penalty". He slowly stood up and said calmly: "The winner becomes king and the loser becomes a bandit. Since I have fallen into your hands, I am at your disposal. Why say more!"

Feng Zongze didn't say much either, and ordered: "Send General Kong on his way!"

Kong Youde didn't wait for people to urge him, striding towards the door. Suddenly he asked: "Who are you? What exactly do you want to do?"

"The Senate," Feng Zongze said, "is to recreate the Divine Land."
