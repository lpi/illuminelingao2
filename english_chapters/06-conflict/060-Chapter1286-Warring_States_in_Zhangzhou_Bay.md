# Chapter 1286 Warring States in Zhangzhou Bay

The Jinjiang County School, usually very quiet, was now extremely noisy after sheltering hundreds of people from the Zheng clan. The voices of adults and the crying and playing of children filled the air. In the halls, blue smoke from cooking fires emerged from time to time.

The relatives of the Zheng clan, shopkeepers, and generals of the Zheng Group who were lucky enough to escape with Zheng Zhiguan had been staying here since they fled into Jinjiang County seat. The Zheng Group had great influence in Jinjiang and Nan'an counties, and many people had purchased properties. Therefore, those with wealth and power quickly went to stay with relatives and friends or went to live in their own manors. The people in the county school gradually dispersed. However, the distant relatives of the side branches, the families of mid-to-lower-level personnel, scattered servants, clerks, and personal soldiers who fled from Anping City to make a living had nowhere to go. They waited bitterly here for the day to return to Anping.

In the hall of the rear courtyard of this county school, a hundred or so people gathered in the main hall, side rooms, and courtyard. There were many dark-skinned black soldiers, and quite a few Japanese samurai carrying tachi.

After Tong Tailang and his men escaped from Kinmen Island with Zheng Sen, they didn't dare to stay long on the shore. After all, Tong Tailang was a foreigner and was not very familiar with the coastal geography, so he took Zheng Sen and fled to Jinjiang County seat, where he had been many times and knew the route best.

Along the way, Tong Tailang took in quite a few stragglers and fled all the way to Jinjiang. Many Zheng clan members who escaped from Jinmen, Xiamen, and Anping had already gathered in Jinjiang County seat.

However, Zheng Zhiguan, who had the highest status in the city, seemed to have no interest in the heir of the Zheng family. He didn't even come for a formal visit, but just sent servants to deliver some money, rice, and clothes, and then there was no more news.

Except for Zheng Zhiguan, the Zheng Group seemed to have forgotten them, and no one ever came to ask about Tong Tailang and his group. Such indifference shocked Tong Tailang: The head of the family was dead, and the young master left behind was the natural heir. Why did no one come to support him? He initially thought that others didn't know that Zheng Sen had already escaped from the tiger's mouth, so he sent people everywhere to look for the escaped members of the Eighteen芝, especially the "Ichimon-shu" (closer relatives/clan members) of the Zheng clan, but so far, not a single person had come.

The stragglers gathered in the county school all regarded the young master as a life-saving straw—they were all lower-class people with little savings. Once the Zheng family was finished, they would become unemployed and helpless people. Of course, they all hoped that the young master could inherit the position of the head of the family, so that they could at least have the sentiment of "sharing weal and woe".

Although Tong Tailang didn't know much about the internal power struggle of the Zheng Group, he also knew that after the commander-in-chief Zheng Zhilong was gone, it would be very difficult to gather the Zheng family members together.

Formally speaking, there was no problem for Zheng Sen, the eldest son of Zheng Zhilong, to inherit his father's position. But Zheng Sen was only seven years old this year, and discerning people knew that he could not possibly have the ability to govern the Zheng family through the crisis.

If Zheng Sen took the position, there must be a strong assistant to control the situation.

Reasonably speaking, this was a good opportunity to control the emperor and command the vassals. In both China and Japan, there were plenty of examples of powerful ministers assisting young masters to usurp power and tyrannize. Zheng Sen should have been a sought-after hot potato, but unexpectedly, no one cared about him at all.

Even Zheng Zhilong's brothers didn't show any intention of assisting this nephew. Only Zheng Zhifeng sent someone to deliver money and rice, saying that Anping, Jinmen, and Xiamen were all reduced to rubble and could not be settled for the time being, so they could only wrong them to continue living in the county school. Then there was no further text. Tong Tailang was a foreigner after all, and he was helpless about this.

In these days, only Matos, who had escaped death, came here with the remnants of the black guard, dozens of people, but this person of heavy Portuguese descent couldn't come up with any suggestions either.

Now the only person Tong Tailang could discuss with was Qian Taichong.

This Qian Taichong was originally an ordinary clerk advisor under a certain Zheng Zhipeng. It was said that he was originally from Guangdong and was recommended to come here to make a living. Now that his master died in battle, he became an unemployed vagrant.

Tong Tailang felt that Qian Taichong was a very mysterious person. Although he was a scholar, he had dark skin, a sturdy build, and calluses on his hands and feet, looking like someone from a hard-working background. Once Tong Tailang saw him fetching water to take a bath and noticed that he had quite a few scars on his body, seeming to have been on the battlefield.

But Qian Taichong almost never talked about his past, often sitting alone in a daze. It wasn't until a few days ago, when Tong Tailang wanted to hire a messenger to go to Zheng Zhifeng as a lobbyist, that he had interactions with Qian Taichong.

Tong Tailang believed that Zheng Zhifeng was Zheng Sen's uncle and one of the powerful figures in the Zheng family. It was most appropriate for him to come forward to assist the young master. Therefore, he had always wanted to persuade him. But he was a Japanese warrior after all, and it was really difficult to be a lobbyist, so he set his eyes on this taciturn scholar.

Qian Taichong took the travel expenses and went without saying a word. He returned a few days later—except for bringing back a few hundred taels of silver, he still achieved nothing.

"He is unwilling to send someone to welcome the young master?!" Tong Tailang was extremely disappointed.

"He only said that Kinmen Island is currently in ruins, and there are many corpses that haven't been cleared and buried. If the young master moves there, daily life will be very inconvenient. He asked the young master to rest in Jinjiang for a while longer."

"Bastard!" Tong Tailang cursed, " The Master's bones are not yet cold, and they treat the young master like this!"

Tong Tailang was angry for a reason, because yesterday he sent a messenger to Zheng Zhiguan, asking him to clean up a manor of the Zheng family in Jinjiang County so that Zheng Sen and his party could move in—it was very inconvenient for hundreds of people to live in the county school.

Unexpectedly, Zheng Zhiguan, who had already taken over all the Zheng clan's manors in Jinjiang County, rejected it on the grounds that "the *Kun* thief banditry has not been cleared, and it is unsafe to live outside the city".

"It seems we can only look for the Zheng Lian and Zheng Cai brothers..." Tong Tailang was at his wits' end.

"Isn't looking for them asking the tiger for its skin?" Qian Taichong said.

Tong Tailang was stunned. Until now, this scholar hadn't expressed any specific views. Now that he was willing to speak his mind, Tong Tailang's spirit rose and he hurriedly said: "What is your brilliant opinion, Sir?"

"I don't have a brilliant opinion, but even his own uncles are unwilling to come forward, let alone them who are outsiders." Qian Taichong said a bit desolately, "The two Zheng brothers were originally independent forces. Later, they defected to the General's command, originally borrowing the General's power. Now that the General is dead and they have occupied Xiamen Island, they probably intend to do their own business. Why would they want to support the young master?"

Tong Tailang felt deeply disappointed.

"Xiamen Island has become the world of brothers Zheng Lian and Zheng Cai, right?!"

"In Zhangzhou Bay now, there are the Seven Heroes of the Warring States." Qian Taichong said disdainfully, "Everyone is calculating for themselves, only having nothing to do with the young master."

While Zheng Sen and others sat idly in the Jinjiang County School, the members of the Eighteen芝 who had not died in battle or been captured were launching a fierce scramble over the corpse of the Zheng Group.

The strongest Zheng Zhifeng seized Kinmen Island, Zheng Zhibao occupied Little Kinmen Island, and brothers Zheng Lian and Zheng Cai occupied Xiamen Island. Although Zheng Zhiguan moved very fast when escaping from Anping, upon hearing that the *Kun* thieves had withdrawn from Anping, he immediately armed the tenants on his manor, and with his own personal soldiers and family servants, he "recovered" Anping with great fanfare.

The rest of the Zheng family's generals either defected to a certain force or occupied a small island in Zhangzhou Bay. Those who were weak and couldn't figure out the direction leaned on the shore or entered the Jiulong River and Shijing River to watch for changes. The huge Zheng Group seemed to be falling apart.

Although the Zheng Group had been built up in Zheng Zhilong's hands, its internal cohesion was still very weak, basically maintained by Zheng Zhilong's personal prestige. Now that the Zheng Group had suffered unprecedented heavy damage, and the leader and a large number of backbones had died in battle, the shortcoming of weak cohesion was immediately exposed.

On this sea where having ships and men made one a king, the title of Zheng Zhilong's legitimate son was of little use. He had no direct strength under his name. Once Zheng Zhilong died, the remaining army, ships, and property were quickly divided up by the survivors in the group's high level. Except for Zheng Zhilong's personal guards, the Black Guard and the Japanese Guard, no one took him seriously.

As for the generals and shopkeepers, they were weak and could only seek refuge with one side. It was even more impossible to entrust their future to a seven-year-old child.

"It's a pity I have no soldiers." Although Tong Tailang only experienced the tail end of the Warring States chaotic times, he knew the importance of military force well. But in this disastrous defeat, the Black Guard and the Japanese Guard suffered heavy losses. Those killed, captured, and scattered were almost completely lost.

"Those gathered here now are probably all willing to follow the young master." Qian Taichong suddenly said.

"How many people can that be," Tong Tailang said, "Together with Matos's subordinates, there are less than two hundred people in total." Tong Tailang suddenly understood Qian Taichong's meaning and asked:

"You mean..."

"It doesn't matter if there are few people. As long as they dare to fight, they are better than a disorderly mob." A look of spirit flashed in Qian Taichong's eyes, "Besides, we may not necessarily need to fight."

Although the Zheng Group was virtually split, at least they were still of the same clan and race. The current situation would not yet lead to a situation of internecine fighting among the same clan, but various forms of struggle revolving around leadership would be inevitable. At such a moment, the number of personal soldiers was indeed a key issue, but definitely not the main issue.

Tong Tailang realized that this scholar had a clear plan and was a "strategist". He was currently lacking someone who could come up with ideas, so he hurriedly said: "Mr. Qian, please teach me!"

Qian Taichong smiled: "General Tong, you are from Japan. Why do you want to protect the young master to ascend the throne? What does the survival of the Zheng family have to do with you?"

"This is the General's dying entrustment." Tong Tailang said loudly, "We were forced to leave Japan. In these years, we have been serving under the General, lived without worry about food and clothing, and lived a well-off life. Knowing gratitude and seeking to repay it, shouldn't we do so?"

"Hehe, well said!" Qian Taichong nodded, "Then I will help you."
