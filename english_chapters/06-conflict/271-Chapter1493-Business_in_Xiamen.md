# Chapter 1493 - Business in Xiamen

The cargo had already been fully loaded. Chen Huamin was on the verge of ordering the sea sacrifice and departure when a line of porters suddenly came rushing along the pier, all pushing Gale-style two-wheeled handcarts sold from Lingao, piled high with straw sacks. They were heading straight for the *Dongshanju's* berth.

"What is all this?" Chen Huamin wondered—every item the *Dongshanju* was meant to carry had been loaded without omission; provisions like food and water were already stowed—when he spotted Liu Deshan at the rear of the line, following breathlessly behind.

The porters arrived alongside the ship. Liu Deshan stepped ahead to board first, ignoring pleasantries entirely as he directed sailors to open the cargo hold covers in preparation for loading.

"Cousin! What is this?" Chen Huamin was utterly baffled. "Our goods are already fully loaded!"

"Stack them carefully—carefully now." Liu Deshan gestured the porters forward while explaining. "This is salt. Cargo I just procured."

"Salt? To whom will you sell it? We're heading for the Nan Zhili region—without a salt license, how will the government permit import..."

"Hehe—who said anything about selling to the government?" Liu Deshan drew a towel from his pocket and mopped his brow. "This is bound for Xiamen! That's Zheng family territory—what salt license would we need? I received intelligence that salt prices in Fujian are very high. We ship this salt there and—not to overstate things—the expenses for the entire round trip should be covered."

"Cousin, isn't this somewhat... improper?" Chen Huamin knew Fujian had always been a salt-importing region, but his family had purchased an Australian navigation flag. Running straight off to Australian enemies' territory to peddle salt—setting aside what the Australians might think, would the Zheng family even tolerate it?

"Rest easy. I've made thorough inquiries. Everyone in Weitou Bay said the same: regardless of whose ship it is, as long as goods can be transported there, safety is guaranteed without exception—ship and cargo alike. Fair trade. No need to purchase command flags. I've heard that not only are salt and grain prices extremely high there, but a considerable quantity of foreign goods has accumulated awaiting export, and the prices are very low. We transport them back to Guangzhou and sell to Master Qin—another profit in the making!"

"Well..." Though Chen Huamin felt his cousin's commercial instincts were sound, something still seemed amiss. Yet he could not immediately articulate an objection—the ship's cargo hold wasn't quite full; sailing meant incurring voyage expenses regardless, so naturally loading additional goods made sense.

"If that's settled, then let us prepare to sail."

As he spoke, a burly fellow with solid, sun-darkened muscles approached—a Han sword at his waist, a wooden tag reading "Deputy Captain" hanging beside it, and a face full of thick beard. He clasped his fists to Chen Huamin: "Captain, the auspicious hour has arrived!"

Chen Huamin grumbled under his breath: "Little Wang! How many times have I told you? Call me 'Ship Captain' now!" Then, straightening his cap and long gown with due solemnity, he picked up three sticks of incense from the altar table, lit them, and bowed respectfully three times while intoning: "May Lord Mazu bless us sea-plowing folk to sail out smoothly, free from disaster and pain, and return home safely! Chen Huamin, Liu Deshan, and all crew present offer this with reverence!" After presenting the incense, Chen Huamin arranged the fruits upon the altar table, carved a piece from the roast pig with a small knife, and placed it before the altar. Finally he filled three small porcelain cups with wine.

Chen took the first cup, raised his hand, and sprinkled it toward the sky, calling out: "Respect to Heaven! Weigh anchor!"

Deputy Captain Wang echoed loudly: "Aye! Weigh anchor!" The Anchor Master standing by the hawsehole shouted toward the capstan: "Weigh—anchor—!"

Instantly the anchor hands threw their weight against the capstan, hauling the iron anchor to the surface while bellowing their chanty: "Weigh anchor lo—goods—turn—like—wheels—! Gold—ten—thousand—taels—!"

Chen Huamin took the second cup, waved his hand, and sprinkled it toward the sea: "Respect to the Sea! Cast off!"

"Aye! Cast off!" The Cable Master followed with his own shout: "Cast—off—!"

Cable workers untied the lines secured to shore while answering with their chanty: "Cast off lo—smooth—smooth—prosper—prosper—! All—way—peace—safe!"

He took the third cup and sprinkled it across the bow deck: "Respect to the Gods! Hoist sail!"

"Aye! Hoist sail!" The Sail Master called down to the mast: "Hoist—sail—!"

Sailors hauled swiftly on the halyards, raising cloth sails on all three masts while responding in unison: "Hoist sail lo—one—sail—wind—smooth—! Sea—no—raise—waves—!"

Chen Huamin watched the sails reach their peaks, filling taut with the sea breeze. He drew a deep breath, swept his arm toward the open sea beyond the harbor, and commanded: "New course—!"

The *Dongshanju* exited the Pearl River Estuary, crossed Humen, passed through Lingdingyang, and turned due east at Tonggu Banks. She entered Tuen Mun, then circled Ma Wan before entering Hong Kong Channel.

Just a few years earlier, Hong Kong had still been a desolate backwater, scarcely known, scattered with only a handful of tiny fishing villages. Apart from inland river boats arriving during fixed seasons to purchase incense wood, only the occasional seagoing vessel passed through.

Later, when the Imperial Navy was disbanded, several nearby islands became water forts for various maritime "heroes," and merchant ships grew even scarcer. Most preferred taking a longer detour through Hong Kong's outer channel.

Now, however, the entire Penny's Bay channel bustled with activity. The Australians had regulated both the inland and open-sea channels from Hong Kong Island to Guangzhou, exterminated the water bandits, installed navigation lights, erected lighthouses, and marked hidden reefs and shoals one by one—greatly increasing navigation safety.

Most vessels here flew Australian colors. These ships—whether small boats or great vessels—sailed far faster than the *Dongshanju*, maneuvering with remarkable agility. Time and again a ship would overtake the *Dongshanju* as it sailed east, or come racing head-on and veer away at the last moment, leaving behind bursts of good-natured laughter.

Slower local craft also appeared among them—Guangzhou ships, Fujian ships. The Australian-owned fleet lacked sufficient capacity; many freight contracts were sublet to local shipowners. These vessels sailed so sluggishly that the *Dongshanju* sometimes had to steer around their wakes.

Such complex navigation conditions forced Deputy Captain Wang Chengti to remain posted at the bow, constantly monitoring conditions and issuing commands to the helmsman and sternsman, weaving past ships approaching from every direction.

Along both shores of the harbor lay various warships and merchant vessels; freshly constructed wharves, warehouses, boat sheds, and cranes abounded. Here and there an Australian-style stone house or imposing stone building stood out conspicuously. Most striking among them was a large fortress near Central Pier, looming tall with Australian flags snapping from its corner towers. Chen Huamin had visited it to complete navigation formalities and remembered it vividly.

"Look—that's where the *Dongshanju* was built!" Following Chen Huamin's pointing finger, Liu Deshan saw that the beach east of Hong Kong Island had been transformed into an enormous shipbuilding yard. Wooden hulls in varying stages of completion stood in rows; workers swarmed across every vessel, laboring to finish their work.

"When I first laid eyes on this ship back then, I knew at once she was for me—whether her sleek lines or her sturdy body and prow, everything matched my vision perfectly, as though she'd been built specially for me. Such a ship simply had to be mine. And at the time she was nothing but a bare hull—didn't even have masts yet!" Chen Huamin reminisced while gently stroking the wooden handrail of the gunwale.

"The funny thing is, because this ship type differed so dramatically from traditional Guangzhou or Fujian vessels, no merchant dared take the risk of purchasing her—she sat idle on the slipway for half a year. When I saw her and decided immediately to buy, I hadn't brought enough silver with me—such frustration!"

"I remember! The moment you returned, you demanded four-fifths of the silver in our treasury. I was terrified something terrible had happened—that was nearly our entire year's profit!"

"'To do a good job, an artisan must first sharpen his tools'! Besides, with our new ship, two more voyages will earn it all back." Chen Huamin smiled, then grew serious. "Moreover, many great sea merchants operate several vessels, yet their combined profit doesn't equal what a single foreign ship earns in one voyage. Foreign ships carry larger cargoes, mount great cannons for protection, achieve higher speeds, and can freely enter and exit the deep ocean. That's why foreign ships keep growing larger—while we've fallen behind. We must learn shipbuilding from foreigners. I've heard the Australians build ships even more formidably than Europeans—using iron to construct ship ribs. For the life of me, I cannot fathom it: if ribs are made of iron, all that extra weight—how can the ship sail fast?"

"Fortunately, business at this shipyard appears to be thriving. More and more merchants are recognizing the importance of proper ships." Liu Deshan said. "As for iron ribs—I hear only their warships use iron ribs. But last time I sailed past the shipyard, I saw the patrol ships they build all use iron frames, yet they maneuver agilely and swiftly. Truly incredible!"

"Australian merchant ships are said to use iron ribs as well." Chen Huamin pointed to a massive T800 hull resting on the beachhead. "Pity that ship is too large—transshipment at port would be too inconvenient. Otherwise I'd love to try something new."

"Hehe—Cousin, you truly do love the new and loathe the old. The *Dongshanju's* been in your hands only a few days, and already you're eyeing another ship."

"We make our living on the sea—a ship is our money-making tool. Naturally we must acquire the best vessels we can. I've heard Westerners say that a carefully built great ship, properly maintained, can serve for a hundred years. Here with us, it's as though we're building disposable kindling boats."

"Cousin, now you're sounding like a bookworm. Your family has traded at sea for generations—surely you know that maintaining a ship costs money every single day? Figure it up honestly, and it's really no better value than building a new one for every voyage."

"That's the old business principle," Chen Huamin said with spirit. "I believe the future of sea trade will look nothing like our fathers' and grandfathers' days. Ships are changing, rules upon the sea are starting to change—and therefore business principles must change as well."

As the two conversed, the *Dongshanju* had already passed briskly through Hong Kong Channel and was turning northeast to continue her voyage.

Exiting Lei Yue Mun, crossing the Ninepin Group, passing Mirs Bay, turning east-northeast—sailing straight for Xiamen.
