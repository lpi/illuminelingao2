# Chapter 1637 - A Peaceful and Prosperous Age

He was not a student of this school, and his unfamiliar face quickly drew attention. Before long, someone drifted over to make conversation.

The local scholars initially displayed the reserved courtesy befitting educated men, cupping their hands in formal greeting. Then a stout scholar asked with lazy curiosity: "Where does the gentleman hail from?"

"This humble student comes from Lingao County, Qiongzhou Prefecture," Huang Binkun answered cautiously.

His voice was low, but it ignited immediate interest throughout the room. In an instant, Huang Binkun found himself surrounded so tightly that not a drop of water could have slipped through. His hands were seized by three different people, arms draped over his shoulders from all sides, and eager faces with shining eyes pressed close.

"Brother Huang, are the Australian ships truly made of iron?"

"Hey, Brother Huang—is it true that the Australians command the power of ghosts and gods to make carts and ships move on their own?"

"Master Huang, how might one trade in Australian goods?"

"Mr. Huang, my family also deals in foreign wares. Could you perhaps put in a word with the Chiefs?"

Huang Binkun was flustered by this sudden enthusiasm. As soon as these scholars swarmed him, he grasped just how deeply the Hair-bandits' influence had penetrated. He understood at once that before this crowd, he could show no aversion to the Hair-bandits—quite the opposite, he needed to appear well-connected with the Australians.

As for which scholars among them still possessed integrity, Second Master Huang would have to discover in due time. For the moment, he put on a gracious smile and returned bows in every direction.

Though merely a *xiucai* from a small county, he remained a local tycoon back home. He had accompanied his father through all manner of situations since childhood and felt no timidity in social gatherings. Amidst a chaotic chorus of "Elder Brother" and "Younger Brother," he blended in seamlessly.

Just as the noise reached its peak—*Ahem!*—a sharp cough cut through from behind the crowd.

"What a cacophony! What sort of decorum is this? An insult to refinement, truly an insult!" At the sound, everyone scattered to clear a path. Huang Binkun observed a scholar in his thirties approaching. His attire differed little from ordinary scholars, but his bearing was more dignified, a faint arrogance etched between his brows. At a glance, he was clearly the scion of a wealthy family.

"This is Young Master Liang Cunhou of the County School," the stout scholar whispered in Huang Binkun's ear. "He's descended from officials and runs several businesses. His family is the most prosperous here."

*So this is the leader among the scholars,* Huang Binkun surmised.

"Brother hails from Lingao?"

"Precisely."

"Good, good, good." Young Master Liang said "good" three times in succession. "Truly, hearing a hundred times cannot compare to seeing once!"

Huang Binkun wondered silently. He was no notable figure—where did this come from?

He watched Young Master Liang turn to address the room: "Brothers, please observe. Does Second Master Huang not resemble an Australian?"

Voices of agreement rose around them: "Brother Liang has eyes like torches!" "Absolutely the resemblance." "Except he hasn't shaved his head..."

Huang Binkun panicked. "I am not a Hair—Australian—I am an authentic Lingao native."

Seeing his alarm, Young Master Liang could not suppress a smile. "Second Master Huang, do not panic. It is merely that your appearance and bearing are truly identical to the True Hair-Bandits!"

Huang Binkun could not fathom how he had suddenly become identical to "True Hair-Bandits."

"Though you cannot be considered tall, you are sturdy and hale," Young Master Liang observed slowly. "Though your demeanor and speech reveal at once your gentry origins, your skin is dark and your hands rough. Observing your expression—neither humble nor arrogant—there floats a heroic spirit between your brows, with a hint of self-assured arrogance..."

"Brother Liang describes it wonderfully..."

"Indeed, that is precisely the impression!"

"Brother Huang must be deeply versed in 'Hair-Bandit Studies'..."

Huang Binkun was caught between laughter and tears, unable to respond. In what way did he resemble the Hair-bandits? Could it be that after five years under their rule, even his spirit and energy had transformed?

Judging by Young Master Liang's demeanor, he was quite "appreciative" of the Hair-bandits. Naturally, Huang Binkun could not spoil their enthusiasm. He had to murmur assent and offer modest disclaimers, professing his "shallow knowledge" and familiarity with only "a thing or two" about the Australians.

"Even knowing a thing or two surpasses us, who gaze at flowers through fog and profess love for dragons like Lord Ye," someone lamented.

"Indeed, when speaking of Australians, we know only the Purple Treasure Studio..."

"That is merely viewing a leopard through a tube. The Purple Treasure Studio represents nothing more than the Australians' sensual amusements. How much do we truly understand of their ingenious engineering and financial management techniques?"

At that moment, a young scholar pushed through the crowd. Judging by his attire, he was quite wealthy. He said: "Sir, having lived in Lingao for so long, Australian customs must be as clear to you as reading your own palm. Nowadays the realm is in turmoil, with refugees rising everywhere. Everyone seeks a new path for governing the country. I hope you will not be stingy with your insights. You must be weary from your long journey—please rest for a day first. Tomorrow at noon, I shall host a banquet at my family's restaurant, Yuyuan Tower, to wash away the dust of travel for Mr. Huang and all the assembled brothers." He concluded with a formal bow.

Hearing there was a free feast in the offing, everyone voiced enthusiastic agreement.

The stout *xiucai* whispered another introduction: this was Young Master Lin Zunxiu. His family operated several restaurants in Guangzhou City and owned extensive real estate. He was naturally generous and cultivated a wide circle of friends.

While merriment filled this gathering, someone outside was shouting something about "Hair-bandits" and "fields filled with the slaughtered." The words were indistinct. The stout scholar dismissed it casually—merely some scholars discontented with the Australians, not worth a second thought.

Huang Binkun harbored the intention to seek out these "loyal and righteous men," but observing that pro-Hair-bandit scholars formed the majority here—and that Young Master Liang was someone he absolutely could not afford to offend—he held his tongue and resolved to watch how matters unfolded.

---

The following day, Huang Binkun arrived punctually for the banquet. The venue was a riverside restaurant by the Pearl River: Zhanxiang Tower. Not only was the architecture magnificent, but a portion extended over the water in the style of a pavilion. In summer, one could drink wine while facing the breeze as river currents flowed beneath the floorboards—a sensation akin to becoming an immortal.

From this restaurant, one could view the famed Haizhu Stone, ensuring a constant stream of banquets. Huang Binkun had contemplated coming here himself to seek opportunities. Though the staff had not turned him away, approaching the private rooms of high officials and nobility had proven utterly impossible.

Unexpectedly, after just one visit to the County School, everything had aligned so smoothly!

The staff escorted Huang Binkun to the hall, where a group of scholars already waited. To his mild disappointment, Young Master Liang was not among them. Upon reflection, given his status, he would likely make a fashionably late entrance.

"Young Master Huang graces us with your presence! Truly this brings radiance to our humble establishment. Come, come, come—please enter." Young Master Lin, born to a merchant family, was thoroughly adept at social occasions. Huang Binkun returned the bow with cupped hands. After a flurry of pleasantries, everyone happily clasped hands and entered together. Before them stood a large glass panel serving as a screen. The windows, too, were all fitted with glass. In Guangzhou, this was considered lavish spending indeed—but to Huang Binkun, it was hardly impressive. Not only were Lingao's streets lined with glass windows, but even his own home had replaced all its windows with glass over a year ago.

The staff led them through a moon gate. Small private rooms lined both sides of the corridor, each bearing evocative names: "Inviting Immortals," "Joyous Travel," and so forth. Lin Zunxiu took Huang Binkun by the arm and guided everyone to the outermost chamber: the Chrysanthemum Viewing Hall. This was the restaurant's famous "Water Pavilion." Windows opened on three sides, with Xiangfei bamboo curtains hung to block the sun. The river breeze blew gently, refreshing all present.

Two large tables had been arranged in the hall, cold dishes and fruit platters already set out. Young Master Lin greeted everyone. The scholars, evidently accustomed to dining at the wealthy Young Master Lin's expense, showed little ceremony—calling each other "brother" and taking their seats.

Lin Zunxiu invited Huang Binkun to the seat of honor, then introduced the assembled scholars. Most hailed from minor wealthy families in Guangzhou City, either managing their own family businesses or with fathers and brothers serving as petty officials. The most enthusiastic stout *xiucai* from the previous day, for example, was surnamed Shi. His family manufactured and sold bamboo and rattan furniture, earning him the nickname Chair Shi.

The first round of wine had scarcely been offered when Lin Zunxiu rose to his feet. Gesturing toward the layers of masts and sails crowding the water, he turned and asked Huang Binkun: "Young Master Huang, is this scenery worth viewing?"

"The great port of the Southern Kingdom—its reputation is well-deserved," Huang Binkun replied appropriately.

"How does it compare to Lingao?"

This placed Huang Binkun in a predicament. In terms of city scale and population, Lingao County under Australian occupation was far inferior to the Great Ming's Guangzhou Prefecture. Yet when it came to "civilization"—a word constantly upon the Hair-bandits' lips—Guangzhou Prefecture lagged far behind.

"Each possesses its own merits," Huang Binkun offered. "Difficult to rank one above the other."

Scholar Shi laughed heartily. "Brother Huang's words are rather slippery..."

Huang Binkun felt somewhat abashed. "This younger brother speaks honestly. Lingao's prosperity differs from that of Guangzhou Prefecture..."

"How does it differ?" Young Master Lin pressed eagerly.

*How indeed?* Huang Binkun pondered. The most significant difference was that in Lingao, the entire environment made one feel at ease. The ground was clean, the streets orderly, and the common people appeared neat and spirited—one saw no beggars sprawled on the ground, no filthy coolies everywhere.

"Is Lingao extraordinarily wealthy?" someone asked urgently.

"Not necessarily so," Huang Binkun organized his thoughts. "Speaking of Lingao's prosperity, it is far inferior to Guangzhou. However, the phrase 'living and working in peace and contentment' is entirely deserved."

Everyone appeared somewhat disappointed—in their view, Guangzhou City equally deserved the description "living and working in peace and contentment."

"What makes it so 'peaceful and content'?" A voice came from outside the door.

It was Young Master Liang, arriving at last.

As the backbone of this group of scholars, his entrance inevitably prompted another round of pleasantries. Once seated, Liang Cunhou inquired again how Lingao achieved such "peace and contentment."

Huang Binkun gathered his thoughts and said: "As the saying goes: the elderly are cared for, the young are educated, the impoverished have something to rely on, those in difficulty receive assistance, and widowers, widows, orphans, the childless, and the disabled are all supported."

These sentences all came from the *Book of Rites*. Who among those present had not read them until the pages wore thin? Though these were the words of ancient sages, no one took them seriously in practice.

"Is that not the rule of the sages?" someone said skeptically. "Presumably there is also no one picking up lost items on the road and no need to lock doors at night."

"That is not quite the case. But the difference is negligible," Huang Binkun replied.

This drew even more murmuring sounds of doubt. Young Master Liang showed no concern, and simply asked: "Is this truly so?"
