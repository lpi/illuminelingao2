# Chapter 1381 - Grain and Silver

In the logistical supply history of the Guan-Ning Army, there was a phenomenon that once caught Zhao Yingong's attention: the Guan-Ning Army's obsession with cash.

As an armed group with over a hundred thousand soldiers and civilians, grain was the bulk of the supply. However, in specific transport and replenishment, the phenomenon of transporting cash equivalent instead of grain was common, showing a phenomenon of valuing silver over grain.

Transporting less grain and more silver had the greatest benefit of reducing transport costs. Transporting silver was much cheaper than transporting grain of equal value. After silver arrived, purchasing grain locally, from a modern person's perspective, would enliven the local market and stimulate local economic development.

But applied to the Guan-Ning Army, this was simply a terrible idea.

The Guan-Ning Army was located in the bitter cold Liaodong. After the Ming lost Shenyang, what they actually held was just a corridor of fortresses from Jinzhou to Shanhai Pass. Although military households continued to farm, in the harsh climate environment of Liaodong with a frost-free period of less than two months, their own grain self-sufficiency rate was very low. They relied on grain supply from inside the pass.

Under these circumstances, transporting large amounts of silver for local procurement was tantamount to artificially creating inflation. Since Liaodong fundamentally couldn't supply enough grain, they could only rely on grain transported in by merchants from inside the pass as a supplement. Grain from inside the pass traveled thousands of li, crossing mountains and rivers, exploited at every level along the way to Liaodong. High transport costs and losses all had to be added to the grain price.

Originally, the local money stock was too high, and grain transported in at great capital cost couldn't meet needs. Thus, Guan-Ning Garrison fell into a kind of inflation, with prices as high as over ten taels per shi, or even over twenty taels.

Such exorbitant prices were extremely heavy for local ordinary soldiers, military households, and commoners. Although nominally each regular soldier had a monthly pay of three or four taels of silver, in reality, except for a few elite family retainers and personal guards, most people rarely received pay on time and in full. Even if all the silver they got was used to buy grain, it was hard to make ends meet, barely maintaining survival.

But this inflation was the best environment for military commanders who controlled resource distribution to make a fortune. Through embezzling military pay and grain sales, Guan-Ning generals accumulated wealth unimaginable to their predecessors.

Zhao Yingong believed: to solve the problem, one still had to work on grain.

"In my view, we still need to transport rice there. Grain prices in the Liaodong area are extremely high. If 50,000 shi of rice is transported there, even if bought at three taels per shi, it can sell for at least double the profit! After delivery, deducting expenses will leave more than enough."

Shen Tingyang's eyes lit up, then he shook his head: "How can there be room for such leisurely action! Not to mention that raising 50,000 shi of grain requires great effort, transporting it to Liaodong and finding someone to buy these 50,000 shi of grain is also not an easy matter—"

Even at a price of six taels of silver per shi, the total price of this batch of grain would be 300,000 taels. Shen Tingyang really couldn't imagine anyone being able to cough up such a huge sum to buy it.

If sold piecemeal, any delay in shipping schedule would be disastrous - although this was a trial run and the deadline was set very loosely, if dragged on too long, Guan-Ning generals might use this as an excuse to deliberately make difficulties and extort extra benefits.

"This matter is not difficult. This younger brother guarantees someone can afford to buy it." Zhao Yingong was very certain.

Shen Tingyang looked at him with skeptical eyes. Although everyone knew this Zhao Yingong had a mysterious background, not only having a strong "bandit" color but also likely having powerful patrons in Guangdong behind him, it was suspicious that he could be so confident about Liaodong's commercial situation which everyone regarded with fear.

But Zhao Yingong was so confident, and he wasn't a man who liked to talk big - after the last trade with Japan, Zhao Yingong's credit in the Jiangnan business circle could be said to be as heavy as nine tripods. He wouldn't deceive him with big talk.

Shen Tingyang thought for a moment and immediately said: "Since this is the case, I'll have to trouble worthy younger brother. For this transport undertaking, my intention is for the Merchants Bureau to come forward and do it."

Zhao Yingong immediately understood his meaning: the Shen family had plenty of large ships of their own. Going to Liaodong didn't require many sand boats, so there was no need to let the joint venture Merchants Bureau do it. Shen Tingyang was testing him - if Zhao Yingong was speaking false big words, he absolutely wouldn't dare risk the Merchants Bureau, his "own daughter." If he dared to take it, it meant he had sufficient confidence in this method.

Zhao Yingong showed a look of "surprise" and hurriedly expressed that this was inappropriate.

"There is absolutely no such reasoning," Zhao Yingong shook his head repeatedly, "This is Brother Shen's enterprise."

"What are you saying? The Merchants Bureau also has this elder brother's shares."

"Since this is the case, I will obey." Zhao Yingong declined no further. He intended to cut into this transaction anyway.

Seeing he didn't decline, Shen Tingyang knew he definitely wasn't bragging and couldn't help but put half his heart at ease: "It's just that raising 50,000 shi of grain is not easy in a short time."

The key here was to find a large grain merchant who could supply such a massive amount of grain. The grain quality didn't need to be good because what was being exchanged was silver, and the grain was to be sold on the market - in current Liaodong, as long as it was grain, there was no worry about selling it.

Finding a grain merchant who could provide 50,000 shi of grain wasn't easy. The scope of grain circulation in this era was very small. Although some grain distribution markets had formed, their radiation range was limited.

Moreover, last year various parts of Southern Zhili had suffered disasters of different scales, and grain output had decreased significantly. After paying tribute grain, the remaining grain reserves in the localities were limited. Raising 50,000 shi of grain would require finding many grain hongs.

Buying such large quantities of grain frequently would inevitably cause prices to rise significantly - current market prices were already going up. And it was difficult to buy all the grain in one place, requiring long-term transshipment. Shen Tingyang estimated that even if he acquired grain from merchants across Southern Zhili through his commercial network, the average cost per shi upon arrival in Shanghai for shipment would probably exceed three taels.

"No need to rush on this." Zhao Yingong said unhurriedly, "I will also help think of a way for grain. It's just that this cash equivalent silver must be obtained as soon as possible. This matter still requires Brother Jiming to run around."

This cash equivalent silver wasn't so easy to get. Where there were procedures, there were costs. Zhao Yingong understood this principle very well - even in the democratic and rule-of-law old time and space, settling accounts between Party B and Party A in commercial cooperation required some sweeteners, let alone in this era where customary fees were directly on the table.

"This is as it should be."

Zhao Yingong immediately got busy. The wholesale merchant in Liaodong was ready-made: Li Luoyou's Liaohai Hong had both strength and a sales network. It would be no problem for his trading hong to buy these 50,000 shi of grain.

Although the price sold to Li Luoyou couldn't be too high, a price of six taels per shi was still no problem. He didn't need to pay all 300,000 taels in silver either. Paying just 100,000 taels would be enough to hand over to Guan-Ning Garrison - according to intelligence from the External Intelligence Bureau, Liaohai Hong's working capital used in Liaodong was constantly around three to four hundred thousand taels. Paying 100,000 taels cash was no problem. The remaining funds could be offset using drafts to withdraw money at various branches inside the pass or directly purchase goods according to their remittance agreement with Li Luoyou.

In Liaodong, grain was the most sought-after commodity with the biggest profit. Whether sold to the Guan-Ning Army, Dongjiang Army, or the Manchus, it could fetch a high price. This depended on the choice of Liaohai Hong's Liaodong chief manager and was none of his, Zhao Yingong's, business.

Letting Liaohai Hong be the wholesaler involved another consideration of Zhao Yingong's. On the ground in Liaodong, neither the Council of Elders nor Shen Tingyang had many connections. If they directly transported 50,000 shi of grain to Liaodong and rashly sold it, leaving aside how few merchants in Liaodong had the strength, the grain might all be seized by soldiers and they wouldn't get a single coin - merchants engaged in Liaodong business from the Dengzhou-Laizhou area who went bankrupt because of this were not few.

Li Luoyou had operated in Liaodong for many years, had deep roots, and colluded deeply with local military families and officials. With his Liaohai Hong coming forward, naturally there were no such concerns - frankly speaking, only a powerful figure like him dared to do business on that ground and still make big money.

The remaining issue was the critical one: where would the husked rice come from? Jiangnan's grain was in a shortage phase. Large households with grain would definitely hold back sales waiting for high prices. Grain prices would only fall after summer grain came on the market - Shen Tingyang obviously couldn't wait.

Zhao Yingong's confidence wasn't as sufficient as when he guaranteed Shen Tingyang. He originally planned to transport Siamese husked rice from Lingao. Lingao's Siamese husked rice had sufficient price advantage. Even transported to Shanghai, the CIF price per shi wouldn't exceed one tael. But the arrival of Siamese rice was still limited by insufficient transport capacity, plus the influx of large numbers of immigrants - up to now, Lingao's grain was still a Tier 1 controlled material with import/export and distribution directly controlled by the Planning Commission. To transfer 50,000 shi from Lingao in one go, even if it could earn back several times the profit, the Planning Commission probably wouldn't approve. Although he had already written a report to the Planning Commission, he himself felt there was little hope.

As for Taiwan and Jeju, although agriculture had seen certain development, they had to bear large refugee transfer work. Except for Jeju Island barely being self-sufficient, Taiwan's grain still needed to be transferred from Lingao. Counting on them to transfer grain out was impossible. Moreover, the grain reserves in these two places were largely relief rations and potatoes, which probably couldn't be realized into cash in Liaodong.

It seemed grain had to be sought from other places. Zhao Yingong considered several locations. The Joseon Kingdom was a poor wretch; taking out a few thousand shi of grain would make the Joseon court complain endlessly. Buying grain from them was too unrealistic. Although Japan's grain production was quite considerable by the standards of the time, what could be sold externally was very limited - grain was never their export product.

Zhao Yingong thought back and forth but couldn't come up with any brilliant plan.
