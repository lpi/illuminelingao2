# Chapter 1448 - Interrogation on the Sentry Post

Mu Min took the document, which listed the identified food items: dairy products, mutton, bananas, nougat, mangoes... alcohol content was also detected.

Although Mu Min didn't know the weekly menu of the Maid School, she was very clear that several items involved were "special supply foods" only enjoyed by Elders—of course, as long as they were willing to spend money, naturalized citizens and indigenous people in Lingao could also buy them from cooperative stores. But a student in the Maid School with only a meager allowance could not possibly purchase these foods.

"So, Lin Xiaoya's last meal was eaten with a certain Elder."

"Bingo!" Su Wan unconsciously blurted out one of Cheng Yongxin's catchphrases, causing Mu Min to give her a surprised look.

"Most Elders eat quite simply on normal days, not particularly lavishly. From the stomach content list, you can see this meal was rich in variety, with many high-end foods, and even alcoholic beverages—a bit like a sumptuous feast before rolling in the sheets on deflowering day."

Mu Min now fully understood why Su Wan had been so hesitant and wrote two autopsy reports. Even knowing nothing about her current investigation materials, just from the existing autopsy materials, one could know that an Elder could not escape involvement in this matter.

Since the matter involved an Elder, her cautious attitude was understandable.

"Can you give me your second report?"

"Of course, as long as you want it. I can sign it and give it to you immediately. But before that, I want to hear your investigation results—today is September 12th, more than ten days since the incident. I've always wanted to know who exactly killed this poor girl and why. You only came to question my autopsy report now, probably because you already had a plan in mind."

"Since you are so cautious and specially made two reports, why are you suddenly interested in the truth?"

"Just as you said: finding out the truth is the most important." Su Wan smiled strangely.

"Alright." Mu Min nodded, "I wasn't at the scene on the day the body was found. I only received the order to return to Lingao that night—"

*** *** ***

On September 1st, all senior Elder police officers were conducting police administration research in other places to pave the way for the next step of police administration promotion. After receiving the call from the Executive Committee, Ran Yao immediately assigned Mu Min, who was researching in Qiongshan, to rush back to Lingao to take charge of the investigation of this case.

Mu Min rushed back to Lingao overnight and studied the file materials of the on-site investigation that day. The on-site investigation data was really too sketchy. Although it was her proud disciple Wu Xiang who went to investigate that day, she still knew how much weight this young man carried.

In addition, as a naturalized police officer, there were too many inconveniences in investigating such a case. Some necessary procedures were not done. Mu Min decided: without delay, go to the scene for investigation as soon as dawn breaks.

However, she had been on a business trip to Chengmai and Qiongshan for police administration research and hadn't returned to Lingao for more than half a month. Returning this time and immediately receiving a new task, it seemed the case couldn't be closed without seven or eight days. Better tell her husband first.

She picked up her Little Smart phone and dialed Ming Lang's number.

After the call, she took a nap. After daybreak, she asked for an official carriage and came to the Elder residential area in Bairen City.

The road leading to the Elder residential area was shaded by green trees, and the road surface was paved particularly smoothly. The carriage driving on the road felt almost no bumps. Dense woods lined both sides of the road, and tall and short trees formed a thick hedge, completely blocking the view from the outside.

Mu Min knew that the 200 meters on both sides of the road were such woods, and these woods were strictly guarded, allowing no "unrelated personnel" to enter.

The carriage arrived at the entrance of the Elder residential area, and a red and white barrier blocked the road. A guard walked towards her, wearing an army uniform, wearing the rank of corporal, carrying a five-shot shotgun on his shoulder. Another guard stood aside, with two revolvers crossed on his body, carefully placing his hand on the gun handle. A black police dog, as a supplementary force for the two guards, lay lazily on the side.

The guard didn't recognize her. As a member of the powerful organs, she rarely went home, so naturally, she didn't remember the guards' faces. Moreover, the guards here were dispatched by the Lingao Garrison Battalion, not belonging to any existing powerful organ in Lingao, only administratively subordinate to the Army.

The guard held a loose-leaf binder in his hand. Mu Min handed over her ID and the authorization document from the Arbitration Tribunal. The guard looked carefully for a long time, looked at her face again, then handed back the ID and saluted.

"Thank you, Chief!"

Mu Min took the ID, got out of the carriage, looked around at the situation, and asked: "What is the standard inspection procedure here?"

"Every vehicle and every person must be checked. Check ID. If the person coming is a naturalized citizen, their special pass to enter the dormitory area must also be checked. If carrying items, the items must be checked."

"Check vehicles?"

"The personal vehicles of Elders and life secretaries are not checked unless there is an order from the General Affairs Office. All other vehicles must be checked."

"Tell me, what procedures and documents do naturalized citizens need to enter and exit here? Which naturalized citizens can get permission?"

"Yes, Chief!" The guard dared not neglect; the visitor was not only an Elder but also a senior officer of the National Police. Yesterday a murder case happened here—this was a major security incident, and the arrival of this female Chief in black uniform must be related to this.

"There are four types of naturalized citizens who can enter the dormitory area. The first type is the Chiefs' life secretaries; they can freely enter and exit the dormitory area with their own work IDs. The second type is the long-term service personnel of the dormitory area: including guards, secretaries, washerwomen, cleaners, gardeners, etc. They hold special passes issued by the General Affairs Office and enter and exit the dormitory area daily according to time slots; they are not allowed to enter or exit outside the time slots. The third type is temporary guests of Elders, issued short-term passes by the Elders themselves, generally valid for no more than 24 hours. The holder must be led by the Elder personally or the Elder's life secretary to enter and exit, 1-2 persons each time. Maximum no more than 3 persons. Finally, temporary entry and exit personnel, including messengers of the General Affairs Office, delivery workers, coachmen, etc. They enter and exit the dormitory area with their own IDs and one-time dispatch passes. The dispatch pass is valid for the day."

Mu Min thought to herself, the system regulations were quite rigorous.

"Do you have entry and exit registration records?"

"Yes."

"Bring it to me. I want to see if a girl named Lin Xiaoya entered the dormitory area on August 31st."

The guard walked back to the sentry box. After a while, he came back with a thick register.

"Yes, there was indeed a person named Lin Xiaoya who entered the dormitory area on August 31st. She came in using an Elder's temporary guest pass." He flipped to that page and pointed to an entry with his finger, "It was 16:20 in the afternoon."

"Were you on duty then?"

"Yes. I was on duty. I work the day shift from 6 am to 6 pm."

"Which Elder's guest was Lin Xiaoya?"

"The pass was issued by Elder Yang Xinwu." The guard said, turned around and walked in, bringing back a card—an Elder's temporary guest pass. The pass had no photo, using fingerprint registration. It recorded the temporary guest's name, age, occupation, physical characteristics, and validity period. At the bottom was stamped with the Elder's name seal; it couldn't be wrong, this was the Elder's name seal uniformly carved by the General Affairs Office.

"Did Elder Yang bring her in personally?"

"No, it was Chief Yang's secretary Yang Jihong who brought her in. Look, this is the accompanying person's signature." The guard pointed to the registration column, and indeed, that name was scrawled in the accompanying person column.

Mu Min nodded:

"When did Lin Xiaoya leave here?"

"At 22:10 that night."

"How was the original record written?"

"Here," the guard pointed, "Still sent off by Elder Yang's life secretary, sent out using a carriage from here."

"Did you see her leave?"

"I was not on duty. I went off duty at 18:00 in the evening."

"Aren't outgoing vehicles checked?"

"Vehicles of Elders and life secretaries are not checked upon entry or exit."

"Are there records of Elder Yang and his life secretary entering and exiting recently?"

"No, except for registering Chiefs and life secretaries entering and exiting during the night curfew, we don't record entries and exits at other times."

"From what time to what time is the night curfew?"

"From June to September, it is from 5 am to 7 pm. Other times from 6 am to 6 pm."

"I understand." Mu Min said, "I want to confiscate the register and this pass as physical evidence."

"Certainly, but you must issue a receipt from the Arbitration Tribunal. Otherwise, I cannot hand them over to anyone."

"No problem. Little Wu!"

Mu Min called out, and Wu Xiang jumped off the carriage to handle the procedures for seizing physical evidence.

A burst of bird calls startled Mu Min. She looked past the guard and saw the artificial lake hidden in the shade of trees. A flock of water birds was foraging on the lake surface, calling out from time to time. Two small boats were docked at the pier.

"What is the situation by the lake shore? Is anyone guarding it?"

The guard nodded: "Patrol boats circle the lake once every hour. And there are watchtowers by the lake."

Armed guards, patrol teams, police dogs—it would probably be very difficult for an outsider to infiltrate, kill someone, and then escape calmly. The breakthrough point of the case obviously lay with this Elder Yang whom she didn't know.

She took out a business card and handed it to the corporal: "Come to the address on this card tomorrow to give a statement. Understand? Also the sentry on night shift yesterday, what is his name?"

The corporal said the name, somewhat fearful: "Chief, we executed completely according to regulations..."

"Don't worry, it doesn't matter once you explain clearly." Mu Min comforted him.

"Yes, Chief."

Wu Xiang completed the physical evidence procedures, and Mu Min got back on the carriage and entered the dormitory area.
