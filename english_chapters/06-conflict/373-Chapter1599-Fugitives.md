# Chapter 1599 - Fugitives

"What's strange?"

"In our operation this time, I always felt that we were being watched everywhere, as if the Hair Thieves all knew us." He recounted what he saw and heard near the gymnasium. "If they recognized me, that would be one thing, but they could even recognize the minor disciples. It's really strange!"

"Are you saying there are spies among us?!" Sima Qiudao said in surprise.

Zhuo Yifan shook his head slowly: "I can't be sure, I just feel there's something fishy going on..."

"If we can go back—" Sima Qiudao stopped halfway. Obviously, right now even escaping from here was fraught with grim possibilities, let alone talking about "going back."

"If you were alone, you could still escape. Bringing me along, I'm afraid it won't work." Zhuo Yifan shook his head and said, "After dark, you should escape quickly. Go to Nanbao. I don't know how Old Huang is doing there..."

As he spoke, he fell into a coma again.

Wu Mu held the phone. Okamoto's angry voice came from the receiver. The call from the person in charge of the Art Troupe from the sentry post at the South Gate of Bairen City was more of an interrogation than a notification. But at this moment, he didn't care about these things.

"It's best that you are all fine. Confirmed three killed? One bandit escaped? Please calm down before speaking... Alright... Pass the phone to Deputy Director Dongfang."

Okamoto said grumpily: "No need, I've finished what I have to say. Now our Art Troupe can only hide in the city. Catching terrorists is your task, Director Wu." After speaking, he hung up the phone.

Wu Mu cranked the handle twice again and connected to Mu Min, asking about the latest updated list—the people arrested and bodies found so far were under the management of the National Police—the latest feedback was that there were very few people on the list whose whereabouts were unknown.

This list was compiled by the task force through continuous monitoring and tracking of suspects. It included both "suspicious elements" who came across the sea and local indigenous people and naturalized citizens who frequently contacted them. The task force managed to take photos of everyone on this list and included them as key surveillance targets.

Wu Mu originally expected more important figures to appear on this list, but his expectations were completely dashed: the list did have a few more people than a few days ago, but they were either insignificant or unlikely to be "violent terrorists."

However, he couldn't let his guard down completely. Who knew if there were bigger fish lurking underwater that hadn't shown up? Judging from the feedback from various places today, whether it was the Political Security Bureau, the police, or the Garrison Battalion, their performance was not nearly as optimistic as he had estimated before.

"The search warrant has been issued. All naturalized citizen security personnel in Lingao, including the National Army and the Public Security Army, will be dispatched to participate in the search." Mu Min meant to comfort him a bit on the phone, "I have ordered the Japanese and Korean Public Security Armies to be responsible for searching key areas. They won't slack off. The dog team has also been sent out. You can rest assured, not a single one will get away."

"Alright. I estimate that the ones who slipped through the net are the main leaders. That Young Master Zhuo is definitely a big shot." Wu Mu said with a frown, "This person must be caught. What about the female police officer who was with him?"

"I have already ordered the arrest of Lian Nishang. Zuo Yami, Li Yongxun, and several others were arrested together. Everyone on the list within the police system has been arrested."

"Good. Take care."

Only a few tens of minutes had passed since Qian Duoduo dialed Dongmen Chuiyu's phone, but the stormy waves set off in this short time made the heart of every Senator in the Lingao area tense. Wu Mu and Mu Min both understood that hundreds of pairs of eyes were staring at the Political Security Bureau and the Police Headquarters. Every step taken next might be on thorns.

Fortunately, no Senator had been harmed so far. It could only be said that their luck was good—yes, consistently good.

Wu Mu put down the phone and dialed Liu Fuqing. He instructed him to immediately send someone to the Art Troupe and the crime scene to investigate and write a report on the relevant situation.

"You immediately arrest the naturalized citizen musicians of the orchestra, and the Garrison Battalion soldiers responsible for protecting the orchestra. Yes! Not a single one left, arrest them all—even if they need to be sent to the hospital, you must send a staff member to follow them!"

Wu Mu put down the phone, gasped for breath, and dialed another call to the Interrogation Division, telling them to "empty all interrogation rooms, cancel leave, and enter working status."

Sima Qiudao and Zhuo Yifan hid until dark. Seeing the nearby search teams gradually decrease, they crawled out of the vegetation. Sima Qiudao carried clothes and a pair of scissors with him. In the bushes, he quickly cut both of their hair short and changed into naturalized citizen clothes.

"Your wound can't be delayed for long. We have to hurry to Nanbao to find Old Huang!" Sima Qiudao said. As long as they reached Nanbao, it would be somewhat easier to run into the Li area.

Zhuo Yifan nodded in agreement, but felt somewhat lost in his heart. Thinking that I, Zhuo Yifan, am also from a famous and upright sect, wielding a sword to travel the Jianghu, now I have ended up like a thief, having to cut my hair and change my clothes to survive—what the ancients called cutting the beard and robe was probably like this.

"Can you walk?"

Zhuo Yifan rested for most of the day and ate some dry food Sima Qiudao brought with him. His energy and spirit had recovered somewhat. He got up and walked a few steps, and it was fine. It was just that the wound hurt in bursts. With slight movement, he almost fell to the ground.

"This is the Hair Thieves' secret medicine. Take it first. It's very effective." Sima Qiudao took out the painkillers bought at the East Gate Market pharmacy and fed him one. He then helped him undo the bandage to change the dressing.

"The Hair Thieves' medicine is indeed effective!" Sima Qiudao said with some surprise. When he treated Zhuo Yifan's wound, he fed him sulfa tablets purchased from East Gate Market and applied anti-inflammatory powder to the wound. It seemed the situation was pretty good now.

Fortunately, he was prepared beforehand! Sima Qiudao had served in the army and knew deeply that being injured was more terrible than dying in battle. Often, after suffering torture, one still couldn't escape death. While hiding, he had heard that the Hair Thieves' medicine was very effective, so he bought several kinds of medicine from the pharmacy, and even the bandages were bought from the pharmacy in advance.

He tore open another packet of anti-inflammatory powder, sprinkled it on the wound, and bandaged it again. After waiting for a while for the ingredients in the painkiller to take effect, the two quietly left the riverbank and headed south. They dared not take the main road and could only take remote small paths. Fortunately, this was not the urban area. Although there were some residential points nearby, due to the major event that just happened, every household on the street had their windows closed tightly, and there was basically no one around.

Walking and stopping along the way, after much trouble, the two had escaped the range of East Gate Market. Both Sima Qiudao and Zhuo Yifan had the ability to identify directions by watching the stars and walking at night. They walked through wild fields and crossed woods all the way. Thanks to the Hair Thieves' medicine, Zhuo Yifan could barely move forward. Sima Qiudao estimated the time; arriving at Nanbao before dawn should not be a problem.

At this moment, in a naturalized citizen dormitory in Nanbao District, the lights were dim. In the vagueness, the creaking of furniture and a woman's moans could be heard:

"Ah, ah, Brother Huang, harder, yes, I like this strength." The woman lying prone on the bed wore only close-fitting undergarments, her brows slightly furrowed, making ecstatic sounds from time to time. A middle-aged man was concentrating on massaging her, sweating profusely from exhaustion.

"Xiu'er, you can really take force. Ordinary men might not be able to withstand my massage." The one massaging the woman was Huang Zhen, the shopkeeper of the Huang Family Medicine Shop.

"Done." After finishing, Huang Zhen sat on the stool, drank a big mouthful of tea, and lit a post-coital cigarette. You Xiu had already brought washing water to wipe his sweat.

"Being pressed by Brother Huang like this, my whole body feels comfortable, and all forty-eight thousand pores are comfortable..."

She snuggled against his chest like a little bird.

"You cried out so loudly, what if the child heard it?"

You Xiu had three children. The older ones boarded at Fangcaodi, and the youngest one stayed with her, sleeping in the bedroom separated by a wall.

"He sleeps very soundly. back then when I carried him to flee, he could sleep even when encountering wind and waves at sea." You Xiu whispered, "I originally thought he was too small to survive. It's really the Bodhisattva's blessing, letting us mother and children escape to such a good place."

Huang Zhen looked at this woman in front of him. Looking at her appearance, how could one imagine her panic-stricken appearance when fleeing? She was said to be a woman in her early forties, but her body was maintained even better than a thirty-year-old woman from a poor family. The various wonders in bed were even more indescribable to outsiders.

Thinking of the time when he had an affair with her, there were unavoidable circumstances, but humans are not grass or trees; how can familiarity not breed affection? In the past, she was also very considerate to him, so much so that Zhou Zhongjun and others laughed at him for having "a fool's luck."

Huang Zhen was nearly fifty. The heroic ambition of a knight-errant wandering the Jianghu for many years had long been worn away. This time he came to Lingao to lurk and opened a medical clinic. The business was good, and he had such a lovely companion as You Xiu. Over time, he actually longed to settle down like this deep inside. Sometimes, he even thought, how good it would be if they never took action and just lurked in Lingao like this... But these good days ended today! Thinking of this, Huang Zhen felt very sad. He was sad about losing this kind of life, and even more worried about You Xiu's future. His own affair would definitely implicate her. Hearing that the Hair Thieves were always ruthless in dealing with traitors, sigh, he really harmed her. Not only harmed her, but also harmed her family...

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel extremely melancholy. Originally, he shouldn't have come here, but thinking that he didn't know if he could retire successfully after the uprising, and even if he could escape, it would be difficult to see her again in the future, he unconsciously came to her residence.

You Xiu's face was slightly flushed, and her body squeezed against his chest, obviously moved by spring desires. Huang Zhen originally didn't have such a mood, but thinking that this would be a permanent separation from now on, he couldn't bear to refuse. One hand had already climbed onto her breast, gently massaging.

You Xiu made "mm-mm" sounds again and whispered: "Brother Huang, I... I..."

"Hm?" Seeing her stop talking, looking shy, Huang Zhen asked, "What is it?"

"I... I... seem to be pregnant..."
