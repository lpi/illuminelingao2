# Chapter 1595 - Annihilation

Miejing twisted her long sword into a flower and stabbed straight at the policeman. Instantly, she pierced the policeman's chest through, blood splattering everywhere.

She committed murder in the street, and the whole street instantly fell into chaos. Pedestrians and vendors scattered to hide, and the shop assistants who were originally watching the excitement at the shop doors disappeared at once.

Whistles suddenly sounded sharply. Several plainclothes indigenous people and naturalized citizens nearby drew their pistols and batons and rushed toward her.

"Die!" Since Miejing had already made her move, she threw aside any thoughts of luck and attacked with full force, shouting, "What are you dazing for? Shoulder to shoulder, charge!"

The disciples and fellow martial artists around her drew their weapons one after another. Several plainclothes police were caught off guard. In the close-quarters combat, several people were stabbed and cut down. Some people also opened fire hastily. Both sides suffered casualties, and the scene instantly filled with smoke and chaos.

Miejing's new opponent had good skills. He didn't panic in the haste, jumped back a step, dodging Miejing's killing move, but the net scarf on his head was swept off by the wind of the sword.

"Good swordsmanship, good skills. So you are from the Mt. Heng Sect! Let me, Jiang Jieshi of the Forest-Penetrating Northern Legs, meet you!"

The plainclothes policeman took a deep breath, his imposing manner surged, his eyes piercing. A short stick had already slid out of his sleeve, and with a shake in the wind, it turned into three sections. He swung it toward Miejing's lower body. For a moment, sand and stones flew. Miejing was startled, secretly thinking that there were such figures among the thieves! He must be a scum of the martial arts world!

With profound martial arts skills and seasoned experience, she leaped up, twisting more than a dozen sword flowers and stabbing toward the opponent, forcing Jiang Jieshi to retreat again and again. While waving the baton to defend, he picked up the whistle on his chest and blew it hard a few times.

On this side, the heroes had the advantage of numbers and soon slaughtered the few plainclothes police. Although several people on their side were also killed, the morale of the remaining people was greatly boosted: *The firearms of the thieves are just so-so. As long as we fight close, they are definitely not our match.*

Someone got carried away with killing and shouted: "Kill the thieves..." Suddenly, with a loud *bang*, a plume of thick smoke sprayed out from a window along the street. More than a dozen lead pellets sprayed solidly on him. Seven or eight blood holes instantly appeared on his body from head to toe. He fell to the ground, hands and feet twitching, obviously not going to survive.

"Senior Brother!" Hearing a mournful cry, a young girl rushed out from the heroes and threw herself onto the corpse, crying bitterly.

"Junior Sister Lanhui, stop crying. It's important to kill the thieves and avenge Junior Brother!" Another young disciple stood beside her with a sword, speaking righteously, "The dead cannot be brought back to life! Junior Sister, restrain your grief, wait for Senior Brother to kill a few more thieves—"

Before the voice fell, there was another explosion. Half of his skull instantly flew up mixed with blood and brain matter. Blood and brain matter sprayed all over Junior Sister Lanhui's face and body, causing her to scream and faint limply.

Miejing secretly cursed these disciples of small sects for being useless. In this instant, she attacked continuously and fast, forcing Jiang Jieshi into a flurry. His police uniform was also cut in many places, blood flowing straight down, and he seemed unable to hold on.

However, at this moment, whistles rose one after another on the street. The pedestrians on the street had disappeared, and hurried footsteps were everywhere. In a moment, police officers in black uniforms appeared at both ends of the street.

"It's a trap!" Miejing was horrified. *This situation shows the thieves were prepared and set a trap for us to drill into!* In the moment she was distracted, Jiang Jieshi rolled three or four *zhang* away. Ignoring his sorry state, he turned and ran.

"Where are you running, dog thief!" Someone wanted to chase after him.

Miejing shouted: "Don't chase. The thieves have powerful forces, let's go first!"

"Drop your weapons! Put your hands behind your head and kneel! Otherwise, kill without mercy!" With the deafening shouting, the police on both sides of the street gradually approached. In the front were those holding rattan shields and wearing rattan helmets, with long and short batons configured alternately. Behind them were all police double-barreled shotguns. They advanced slowly with the drumbeats. Their steps were uniform, pressing over like a wall.

The heroes turned pale. They were best at single combat and small group melees. If facing such a large formation of strong soldiers, they would definitely not get any advantage, let alone the powerful firearms of the thieves, which had killed and wounded several of their people in an instant. If they fought hard, they would likely be wiped out.

"Up onto the roofs!" Abbess Miejing waved her sword, "Where there is life, there is hope! Quick, go!"

Pan Jiexin was holding binoculars observing the situation on the street from the roof of a nearby high-rise building. This place was close to the gymnasium, so the command headquarters deployed heavy troops, including not only police and agents but also riot squads. The Special Reconnaissance Team also deployed marksmen everywhere along the street.

Honestly speaking, the reaction and coordination of the police, agents, and Special Reconnaissance Team today made him not very satisfied. He always felt a beat slower.

"This professional level, this tactical quality..." Pan Jiexin couldn't help but complain secretly.

There were two places he was dissatisfied with: First, the on-site command of the deployed plainclothes police force made obvious mistakes. The other side had more than twenty people, but their side only had a dozen people responsible for monitoring nearby. Most people were waiting further away. As a result, the first action of the arrest team encountered resistance, and their reinforcement was weak. Not only did they fail to catch anyone, but they were also wiped out themselves.

Secondly, the support personnel watching on the roofs and in the shops reacted too slowly. By the time they reacted, the arrest team and the enemy had already entered a melee, and they could not fire in time to support.

Fortunately, they still held the advantage overall and turned it around instantly. It looked like the enemy was about to retreat.

"This is too rookie, completely different from what I imagined." Pan Jiexin muttered while watching. This time, the object of his complaint became the heroes.

It was nothing that the heroes had no power to fight back under firearms; the weapon gap itself was too large. But what was with them climbing the eaves one by one right now? Shouldn't they jump up to the roof with a single leap? Why did they have to grab the eaves first and then turn over onto the roof one by one—if this was Qinggong, parkour tracers had much better Qinggong than them...

Of course, even from a modern perspective, their movements could be called agile, and their muscle strength was very strong. The problem was that this didn't match the impression of "flying over eaves and walking on walls" that Pan Jiexin got from Wuxia novels at all.

Thick smoke erupted from the roofs and windows on both sides of the street from time to time. Gunshots rose one after another. The heroes attempting to climb the roofs were shot and fell to the ground one after another. Someone wanted to rush into a shop to clear out the musketeers but took a face full of buckshot and fell dead on the spot.

"This has no ornamental value at all. The fight between Jiang Jieshi and the old nun was still somewhat worth watching..." Pan Jiexin shook his head and put down the binoculars. He had no interest in watching anymore.

Seeing that they couldn't get on the roof, and lead pellets were still shot from the shops on both sides from time to time, the surviving heroes were forced to hide behind goods stalls on the street and dared not show their heads. However, they were still constantly killed by snipers on the roof, lying dead on the street one by one. Seeing the police human walls on both sides slowly pressing over, with musketeers everywhere in the shops and on the roofs firing deadly bullets from time to time, even lying still meant death... It was truly no way to heaven and no door to earth. Seeing the street full of corpses, the original group of more than twenty people had lost majority, leaving only five or six people gathered around Abbess Miejing. The drumbeats sounded, seeming to beat on their hearts.

Suddenly, the drumbeats and gunshots stopped.

The electric loudspeaker over here shouted again: "People inside, listen! We give you five minutes! Drop your weapons, hold your hands high one by one, and stand in the middle of the street!"

"Abbess..."

"Say no more!" Miejing said, "Things have come to this, we can only seek life in death. Everyone charge together, if one gets out, that's one!" She said righteously, "Even if we can't kill our way out, we must kill to our heart's content! Leave behind a heroic name!" Saying this, she held her sword and was about to rush forward.

But her arm was pulled. She looked back and saw the few survivors all looking ashen, completely devoid of the morning's heroic spirit. A few of them even had malicious looks in their eyes. Miejing was furious: "What do you want to do?!"

One of them said: "Abbess, if you want to go to your death, we won't stop you. But we still want to live. Once you rush out, the thieves will fire randomly, and none of us will survive..."

Lanhui, who had just been revived, also said with tears: "Abbess, as long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood. I think, we, we... better..."

Before the word "surrender" could be spoken, the electric loudspeaker shouted again: "Time's up! If you don't come out, we will open fire!" The shotguns behind the rattan shields were all leveled with a swish. The black muzzles were all aimed at the few people in the center of the street.

Miejing sneered, leaped up, rushed to the center of the street, and charged toward the shield wall waving her sword.

Mu Min had already received the phone call. The terrorists disguised as female students had been captured in the square. At the same time, another group of terrorists was eliminated on the street near the stadium.

"...Also captured in the square were three females and one male. Another male was killed by the sniper of the Special Reconnaissance Team while releasing the signal cannon, and one male was killed resisting arrest. They were all wearing naturalized citizen clothing. Weapons were found on the suspects and the dead; some also carried flying darts." Zhou Shizhai reported on the phone, "Now the Public Security Army and uniformed police have sealed off the entire square and are checking IDs one by one."

"...A total of ten terrorists eliminated on the street were killed, and six others were captured. Four of our police officers sacrificed their lives, and one was seriously injured."

"Very good. What about the whereabouts of the people on the list sent by the Political Security Bureau?"

"We are currently comparing the corpses and captives. It seems that the number of people caught does not match the number of people on the list. About half are still missing."

Mu Min cranked the phone once, then twice more: "Connect to Wu Mu's office!"

Wu Mu was in his office, silently looking at the latest telephone record sent by the communicator. The arrest at Qiongan Inn had ended. The group of enemies remaining at the inn attempted arson but failed, and were all killed while attempting to break out.

The action of another group of enemies preparing to carry out sabotage activities in East Gate Market was also eliminated in time. Most of them have been annihilated now, and only a few were taken prisoner.
