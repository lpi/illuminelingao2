# Chapter 1294 Arrangements for the Finale

"Did Zhu Dadian and Xie Sanbin ask for grain?"

"Report, no." Huang Ande replied, "Xie Sanbin didn't speak. Zhu Dadian gave me one hundred and fifty taels of silver, fifty taels for me and one hundred taels for the soldiers of the cavalry company. I have handed it all in."

"Very correct." Lu Wenyuan nodded, "We fight for the Senate, for the common people of the world, not for a few coins." He already knew about this matter. It seemed that the discipline education in these years had not been in vain.

"Serve the Senate and the People!" Huang Ande stood at attention.

"You have worked hard this time. Go back and have a good rest." Lu Wenyuan said, "The Senate sent us frozen lamp meat, radishes and Chinese cabbage. I have already instructed the kitchen to make a lamb hot pot for you tonight."

"Thank you, Chief." Huang Ande saluted and withdrew.

"It seems that my clansman is quite sensible." Zhu Mingxia, who had remained silent, said with a smile.

"Now Old Zhu's biggest problem is how to explain to the Emperor." Lu Wenyuan said, "Now his arrogance is not so rampant anymore. At present, the troops of the Shandong Field Headquarters still need to be reorganized, and he has to rely more on Sun Yuanhua." He was somewhat jubilant, "This was originally his credit, but unexpectedly he has to share it with Old Sun. Our presence in Shandong is also guaranteed."

Zhu Mingxia said: "Next is how to deal with Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde."

The strategic situation of the rebels had not been broken. This was what Zhu Mingxia had estimated long ago. Under such weather conditions, it was already due to their cavalry advantage that the rebels, lacking winter clothes, could pursue for dozens of li in the snow. Even so, the rebels' losses in the pursuit were alarming: reconnaissance cavalry following behind reported that frozen corpses of rebel men and horses could be seen everywhere along the way.

The rebels could neither capture Laizhou nor dare to fight in places like Pingdu and Qixia while the main force of the government army still existed—this meant giving up Dengzhou, the only port where they could get reinforcements and escape.

"I think they will inevitably take boats to sea and flee to Dongjiang after spring starts, just like in history." Lu Wenyuan said, "Dengzhou is already a dead end. Unless we intervene, they can't break the game."

Of course, they didn't need to intervene. The "vitality" of the rebels had gradually declined, and there was no need to collect population through the rebels anymore. And through a series of operations, they had also created a "fait accompli" in Dengzhou. The next step was how to extract maximum benefits from the destruction of the rebels.

There were more than 100,000 rebels and coerced civilians in Dengzhou City. A considerable part of these people were local commoners. According to historical data, Dengzhou City had already begun to "lack food". By the end of the year, it would even fall to the point of "killing people for food and boiling people for candles". According to recent reports from intelligence personnel, although a large amount of government army baggage and forage had been captured, the rebels had already begun to slaughter cattle and horses for food.

Moreover, historically, when Kong Youde fled, he carried out a comprehensive massacre and looting of the whole city, "killing, robbing, raping and defiling, extremely cruel". So the three discussed and put the recovery of Dengzhou on the agenda to avoid excessive loss of population and livestock in the city.

Recovering Dengzhou and eliminating the rebels was not difficult militarily. The main considerations were political factors and the impact on the future development of the situation.

The most critical issue was whether to let Kong Youde go to defect to the Manchus. Historically, after Kong Youde and others fled Dengzhou, they drifted among the islands in Bohai Bay for several months seeking a way out. Obviously, they had hesitated greatly about whether to defect to the Manchus. During this period, they also requested amnesty several times, hoping to continue maintaining a small situation between the Ming, Qing and Joseon. In the end, surrendering to the Manchus contained elements of "having no alternative".

However, Kong Youde's defection to the Manchus caused a great change in the strategic balance between Ming and Qing. The Ming troops who surrendered to the Qing with Kong Youde were all well-trained musketeers and artisans casting cannons. From then on, the Manchus' ability to manufacture and use firearms rose to a significant level. So much so that in the subsequent course of the war, the advantage of using artillery gradually shifted to the Manchu side.

The Senate Standing Committee held several discussions on this issue, during which hearings were also held for Senators from the Great Library and the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Finally, it was decided not to let Kong Youde's unit surrender to the Manchus, but to eliminate them directly.

Although the Han Chauvinist Faction cheered for this, with an enthusiasm second only to the large-scale use of Southeast Asian slaves for mining, for the Executive Committee, this decision was entirely based on comprehensive interest considerations.

If Kong Youde were allowed to flee, he would inevitably drift on the islands in Bohai Bay for several months seeking a way out as in history. There were Dongjiang troops on almost all of these islands. They either confronted the rebels or joined the rebels to fight the government army and Korean army. A large number of personnel died. When Kong Youde fled from Dengzhou, he took away 12,000 soldiers and civilians, but less than 10,000 remained when he surrendered to the Qing. Not only his own unit, but the strength of Dongjiang Town on the islands of Liaodong was greatly reduced afterwards, eventually leading to the fall of Lushun and the death of Huang Long in battle, which meant that the hundreds of thousands of people in Dongjiang were all lost to the Manchus for nothing. This was very uneconomical for the Senate.

A minor reason: After Kong Youde defected to the Manchus, the Senate's monopoly status as an arms dealer would be threatened, and the Senate's influence on the Manchus would also decline.

"We need to move faster so that the Ming army can take Dengzhou before the Lunar New Year's Eve." Lu Wenyuan said ambitiously, "At the beginning of the New Year, letting Chongzhen get good news will make his mood much better."

"It's a bit difficult to help the Ming army capture Dengzhou." Zhu Mingxia smiled, "It would be about right if I commanded the Northbound Detachment alone."

The Ming army was now newly defeated and gasping for breath, so they probably wouldn't have much interest in besieging Dengzhou again. Besides, if they really came, the Northbound Detachment, with completely different training, tactics and equipment, couldn't cooperate with them in battle. At that time, which unit would fight for merit might instead disrupt the rhythm of the offensive; finally, the Ming army's discipline was extremely bad. Historically, after the Sichuan troops entered the Water City, they looted women and property while fighting, and were driven out by the rebel counterattack. After Dengzhou City was broken, various government armies carried out a comprehensive looting of Dengzhou. The population in the city was massacred and looted completely. Dengzhou became a ruin and the city was not gradually restored until the ninth year of Chongzhen.

"We'll do it alone. After finishing it, we'll hand it over to Sun Yuanhua and Zhu Dadian—it's a pity that Sun Yuanhua can't take all the credit." Lu Wenyuan now had a lot of affection for this Governor, "As for the property and population in the city, naturally they were killed and looted by the rebels..."

While discussing how to attack Dengzhou, suddenly someone reported: Kong Youde sent an envoy asking to meet the Manor Lord in person.

"Just right, delivered to the door." Manor Lord Lu laughed, "Alright, let's hear what they want to do first—Old Chen, you should still be the one to appear."

Chen Sigen and Kong Youde held a second secret talk on Dazhushan Island. Kong Youde proposed: Willing to exchange the population in the city for grain.

There were still more than 100,000 people in the city now, among whom were a large number of coerced and looted civilians. Kong Youde and others discussed that keeping these people in the city would consume grain, and keeping them in the city would bring many unstable factors. It was better to hand them all over to Manor Lord Lu—anyway, what he liked most was population.

With enough stored grain, it would not be difficult to persist until next spring. Otherwise, they wouldn't survive the winter and would fall to the point of eating human flesh—although the soldiers in troubled times had long become hard-hearted and eating human flesh was nothing difficult, everyone would still rather eat grain if there was grain.

After discussion, the three agreed to accept Kong Youde's proposal—since they had already set taking the population of Dengzhou as a goal, feeding this population was their obligation. Moreover, starting supplying now would save more manpower than supplying after many people starved to death or were eaten.

At that moment, the plan of exchanging population for grain was agreed upon, still executed at the previous price for exchanging refugees. However, the grain used to exchange for refugees this time was all potatoes from Jeju Island. Because fresh potatoes were not easy to store, in addition to supplying Jeju locally, a large amount was transported to Qimu Island to feed refugees.

Both sides agreed that the exchanged population would be transported by rebel navy ships to Changshan Island—which was currently held by the rebels as an important stronghold to ensure the sea route. Then Qimu Island would dispatch ships to transport the population away. The potatoes used to exchange for the population would also be delivered here.

Based on this agreement, Zhu Mingxia proposed a battle plan.

"We exchange population first to reduce the population in the city to a lower number," Zhu Mingxia said, "They will inevitably leave the core troops. I estimate that including dependents and artisans, there shoudl be thirty or forty thousand people. They won't hand over this part of people to us. When they stop the action of exchanging population for grain, we will launch a joint amphibious attack with the Navy to directly occupy Changshan Island and control the Miaodao Archipelago."

The Miaodao Archipelago was close at hand to Dengzhou and was the maritime gateway to Dengzhou. The rebels had long deployed garrison troops here. Historically, when Zhu Dadian besieged Dengzhou, he specially sent troops to attack Changshan Island, but was defeated by Kong Youde, and ultimately failed to block the rebels in Dengzhou.

"Once we take the Miaodao Archipelago, the rebels' door to escape by sea will be closed. Kong Youde and the others know that they are no match for us at all at sea, and will inevitably seek terms with us. At that time, we will make it a condition that he hand over Dengzhou City and the treasures, allowing him to take his direct line troops and all firearms to board ships and leave Dengzhou."

"Then why not just directly occupy Changshan Island? Just save the trouble of exchanging population." Chen Sigen did not understand, "Besides, didn't we say we can't let the rebels run away?"

Lu Wenyuan understood Zhu Mingxia's calculation: "Once they go out to sea, they will have no room for choice."

"Exactly. This way we can minimize the loss of population." Zhu Mingxia said, "We have to consider that they might refuse this condition and defend Dengzhou to the death. At that time, wouldn't all these people be wasted inside?"
