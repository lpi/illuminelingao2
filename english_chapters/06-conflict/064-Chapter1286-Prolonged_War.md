# Chapter 1286 Prolonged War

He now served as Zheng Sen's counselor and frequently needed to come forward to conduct negotiations. An official title would make such dealings far more convenient—others would not dare to slight him.

"Your reasoning is sound." Zou Weilian stroked his beard and nodded. "Yet you are only a licentiate. There is no precedent in this dynasty for a licentiate to enter officialdom directly."

"With border affairs pressing, the Imperial Court has recently reopened contributions to the Imperial College. This student has already dispatched someone to handle the matter."

The so-called "Contribution to the Imperial College"—*Li Jian*—dated back to the Tumu Crisis, when the Ming Dynasty ordered licentiates throughout the realm to contribute grain or horses in exchange for the qualification of *Jiansheng*, an Imperial College Student. It was, in essence, purchasing status with money and grain. The standing of such Jiansheng was low; society looked down upon them. Nevertheless, once one became an Imperial College Student, precedent allowed the possibility of official appointment. Especially in the disordered final decades of the Ming, systemic decay had opened convenient doors for all manner of irregular arrangements. If Qian Taichong obtained Jiansheng status, and Zou Weilian was willing to assist, securing a minor official position or nominal title would present no difficulty.

Zou Weilian smiled faintly. "I had not expected Mr. Qian to be so thorough in his calculations."

Qian Taichong trembled, hurriedly gathering his robe to kneel. "This student would not presume! It is merely a passing thought—how would I dare display cleverness before Your Excellency? It is truly an expedient born of necessity, all in service to the Imperial Court and the nation, and for the long-term stability of Fujian. I beg Your Excellency to discern my sincerity!"

"There is no need for such ceremony." Zou Weilian raised a hand. "I understand your intentions completely. Serve the Imperial Court faithfully, and a promising future surely awaits you." He considered for a moment. "Once your Contribution status is processed, I shall add your name to the Merit List for the Great Victory at Xiamen."

"Thank you, Your Excellency, for your kindness!"

Qian Taichong returned from Fuzhou in haste and gathered his assembled subordinates—including capable figures from among Zheng Zhiguan's former retainers. He delegated the arrangements for Zheng Zhilong's funeral, item by item. His aim was to hold a grand funeral that would proclaim Zheng Sen's status as Zheng Zhilong's legitimate son and head of the Zheng Group.

"This is a masterful stroke—beautifully executed!" Jiang Shan commented from his office after reading the freshly delivered report. "The Zheng family generals will be driven to distraction. Refusing to attend marks them as disloyal, unfilial, and unrighteous. Attending acknowledges Zheng Sen as the leader of the Zheng Group." He looked up at Wang Ding, Section Chief of the Analysis Section. "Who is this Qian Taichong beside Zheng Sen?"

"He was a former advisor to Shi Bangyao, the Left Administration Vice Commissioner of Guangdong and Intendant of Hainan Circuit. He was captured during the Battle of Chengmai and spent over two years laboring for us. Released only this spring." Wang Ding retrieved a paper file. "Here are the materials I pulled on him."

"Who would have thought he possessed such talents?" Jiang Shan flipped through the pages. "This will make the Zheng family's little drama considerably more compelling."

Li Yan coughed. "Should the Zheng clan actually be reunited under his direction—to our disadvantage—perhaps we ought to eliminate him directly."

Jiang Shan waved dismissively. "It matters little. This drama only improves with someone stirring the pot. We are curious to see just how much ability such a schemer possesses to turn the tide."

Wang Ding added, "Judging from the current situation, even if this Qian Taichong manages to reunify the Zheng remnants, it would be extremely difficult to restore the conditions of Zheng Zhilong's dominance over Fujian's waters."

"Precisely." Jiang Shan withdrew a cigar, struck a match, lit it, and drew deeply. "The colonization and trade departments are planning to launch two commercial campaigns designed to extinguish the Zheng family's remaining vitality entirely."

"Are you referring to the trade monopoly plan against Japan and the Philippines discussed at the recent Senate Standing Committee meeting?"

"Indeed." Jiang Shan exhaled. "The Zheng family's wealth did not fall from the sky. If we can sever those two trade routes, they are finished. Let alone Qian Taichong—even if Zhuge Liang and Liu Bowen were reincarnated as Zheng Sen's strategists, turning the tide would remain beyond their reach."

The Zheng Group, having lost most of its fleets and a vast amount of capital, was now like a gravely wounded patient who had barely survived the shock of massive hemorrhage. Even with recovery, long-term nutritional support would be required to rebuild. The trade war against the Philippines and Japan would serve to pinch off these two infusion tubes—tubes critical to the Zheng Group's very survival.

"As for the chaos in Zhangzhou Bay, I expect Zheng Zhifeng and the Zheng Lian brothers will not submit to *Damu*—Zheng Sen—so easily. There remains an excellent drama of dragons and tigers contending to observe. We need only watch quietly."

"How shall we handle the Zheng family dependents already transported to Hong Kong?" Wang Ding inquired. "Among them are quite a few family members of important figures."

"On that matter, the Executive Committee has already responded and approved our proposal to demand ransom. We will circulate lists to Xiamen and other locations, allowing them to ransom individuals by name." Jiang Shan paused. "The Executive Committee also instructed us to formulate a detailed ransom price list based on the roster—to maximize benefits."

"Isn't it somewhat a pity...?"

"Not at all. What use would keeping these people serve? Send them to labor? That would be the true waste." Li Yan smiled.

"Next, let us discuss operations in Dengzhou."

A bitter wind cut through the air, and snowflakes drifted down in endless curtains. Lu Wenyuan stood atop the watchtower of the stockade on Qimu Island, drawing his thick cotton coat tighter. Flakes as large as palms fell in chaotic spirals, covering the earth before him with a thin white shroud.

The winter of 1632 was brutally cold. Though the tenth lunar month had only just begun, Eastern Jiaodong had already received its first snow. Lu Wenyuan knew from the historical meteorological data provided by the Great Library that this would be a harsh winter—even Lingao would see heavy snow.

Yet compared with the previous winter, the most critical period on Qimu Island had passed. "Manor Lord Lu" had become something of a local power on the Jiaodong Peninsula. Capitalizing on the Dengzhou Rebellion, the "village braves" under his command had occupied the Zhaoyuan region, established more than a dozen stockades, controlled tens of thousands of people, and transformed into a semi-independent force.

Not only did government officials treat him with notable deference, but even the rebels dared not provoke him. Troops marching under the Qimu Island banner traveled unimpeded throughout the region.

Manor Lord Lu took considerable pride in these achievements. Except for a brief pause during the summer typhoon season, Qimu Island had spent the entirety of 1632 taking in and transporting refugees. Over 180,000 had been received; more than 100,000 had been shipped out. Vast stretches across the Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong now lay barren, nearly devoid of human presence. The common folk had either been killed or captured by the rebels, or they had fled to Longkou and Zhaoyuan—most of whom had since been dispatched to Hainan, Jeju, and Taiwan to become indentured servants under Senate authority.

Yet this great upheaval in Dengzhou was gradually approaching its end. In the eighth lunar month of the fifth year of Chongzhen, Zhu Dadian had led the forces of the Shandong Field Headquarters to defeat the rebels at Shahe, then pursued them relentlessly to Laizhou. After crushing the elite cavalry commanded by Kong Youde, Laizhou City was formally relieved.

On the twelfth day of the ninth lunar month in the fifth year of Chongzhen, the government troops of the Shandong Field Headquarters pressed their advantage, attacking Huang County. At Beima Town, they engaged the rebels, who had turned out in full force—claiming an army of 100,000, including 10,000 cavalry. In the end, the rebels were routed: 13,000 killed, 800 captured, and countless drowned after falling into the sea. The government recovered Huang County seat, and Jin Guoqi and others drove straight on to Dengzhou, establishing camps outside the west gate.

As a "local notable," Lu Wenyuan—having earned merit defending Laizhou and "protecting the territory and pacifying the people" within Huang County's borders—was personally received after the battle by Zhu Dadian, Xie Sanbin, and Gao Qiqian upon recommendation from Sun Yuanhua and other civil and military officials who had defended the city. They promised to reward him according to merit in the official commendation lists.

Lu Wenyuan composed his expression into profound gratitude, shedding tears as he kowtowed to these worthies—all the while cursing inwardly. Once official matters concluded, he paid private "visits" to these gentlemen in turn, presenting each with generous gifts. The most lavish he reserved for Zhu Dadian.

Because Dengzhou had held out for eight months, the Imperial Court rewarded and compensated the officials, generals, and gentry who had distinguished themselves in the defense. Sun Yuanhua received no reward, but was permitted to avoid being stripped of his post and arrested for interrogation—he would continue to serve at the front with the demoted status of Dengzhou-Laizhou Governor bearing a record of guilt. Manor Lord Lu obtained the qualification to "enter the Imperial College for study"—that is, he became a *Jiansheng*, the status equivalent of a Juren. Even Feng Zongze was awarded the military rank of "Small Banner."

What now concerned Zhu Dadian and his colleagues above all was capturing Dengzhou and finally ending the rebellion. But for Lu Wenyuan, this matter could not conclude too quickly. If these tens of thousands of government troops crushed Kong Youde in one vigorous sweep, and then turned their attention to the tens of thousands under his banner—men and grain aplenty at Zhaoyuan and Longkou—what ideas might the officers, flush with victory and momentum, conceive?

Just days ago, Xie Sanbin had sent a messenger with a letter requesting that Lu Wenyuan prepare one thousand shi of grain and three thousand laborers for service with the army.

*Hmph. Do you take me for a fat pig presenting itself to the butcher?* Lu Wenyuan thought darkly. He immediately instructed the messenger to return with an agreeable reply: though he himself faced difficulties, he would never be lax in serving the Imperial Court. He only required a few days to prepare.

Gazing at the increasingly dense curtain of heavy snow, he recalled the telegram he had received days ago. The Operation Engine Command had approved his proposal to prolong the Dengzhou Rebellion: let the rebels deal the government troops one more heavy blow. Let the government forces win a pyrrhic victory—supported just enough by Lu Wenyuan's aid to avoid collapse while suffering grievous losses. Ideally, they would lose several more civil and military officials in the process. That way, both in strength and in morale, the government army would no longer entertain ideas of encroaching upon him. His goal of establishing an autonomous Zhaoyuan would be achieved.

*With heavy snow flying, grain must be the army's center of gravity.* Lu Wenyuan mused. *If the grain is lost, the government forces presently massed beneath Dengzhou's walls will collapse without a fight...*

Xie Sanbin currently sat in Huang County supervising the grain supply. The provisions were transported from Qingzhou, with Yang Jin, the Intendant of Qingzhou Circuit, responsible for transshipment. Defenders at Zhuqiao and Huangshanguan provided relay support. If the rebels launched a surprise attack and breached either Zhuqiao or Huangshanguan, the grain convoys could be severed.
