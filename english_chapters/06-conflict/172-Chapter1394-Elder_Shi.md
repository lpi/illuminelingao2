# Chapter 1394 - Elder Shi

"If it's such a poor place, how can there be a teaching gentleman?" Zhao Yingong asked sharply.

"In my view, either someone is lying, or this teaching gentleman is extremely suspicious—very likely an important figure behind the scenes. Jia Le was introduced through him."

Zhao Yingong's mind raced. Should he apprehend this teaching gentleman? He quickly rejected the idea. Jia Le was insignificant; her superior would not be someone important either.

Tracing up from one link to the next could uncover the black hand behind the scenes.

"Can you keep watch on this teaching gentleman?"

"Difficult. We have no connections whatsoever in Nanxiawa. Sending people in to gain trust is extremely challenging..."

"Spend money, kidnap—whatever you do, establish a connection as quickly as possible." Zhao Yingong spoke without hesitation. "I want to know his name, what he looks like, what he does in Nanxiawa, who he contacts. Investigate thoroughly and report back as soon as possible."

"Understood. I'll go at once."

Zhao Yingong watched Zhao Tong leave, then exhaled heavily. For reasons he could not articulate, he felt profoundly uneasy. An imminent sense of crisis hung over him constantly.

Danger lurking in the shadows—he had considered it before. But this tension of approaching catastrophe was unprecedented.

*I must drag this rat into the light!* he thought viciously. *Break him into ten thousand pieces!* If only he had a few Special Reconnaissance Team operatives at his disposal.

Cao Guangjiu sat respectfully in the private room of a brothel. He had visited such establishments before, though always as an accompanying guest—expenses here were considerable.

Though called a "private room," it was actually a small courtyard. The courtyard was modest yet featured a layout of spring-fed water flowing past ornamental rocks. A plantain tree stood in one corner, its leaves lush and dripping, reflected in the pebble paving as if the stones had just been sprinkled with water—the effect was refreshingly cool.

The tea on the table had already gone cold. Together with the six kinds of dried fruit and snacks arranged in a six-compartment carved lacquer fruit plate, none had been touched. Beyond the wall, the faint sound of sandalwood clappers and singing drifted in, somehow emphasizing the loneliness within this courtyard.

The curtain lifted, and a middle-aged scholar entered, lightly fanning himself with a folding fan. Cao Guangjiu hurried to rise and pay his respects. "Elder Shi..."

Secretly he felt disappointed. He had assumed that arranging a meeting in such a place meant the Master himself might see him. Yet once again, it was only a shiye—one of the Master's household retainers.

"Brother Jiu is too polite. Let us sit and talk."

"Yes.Many thanks, Elder Shi."

The scholar called Elder Shi was in no hurry to speak. First he lifted his tea cup and drank a few mouthfuls, then sampled some dried fruit and snacks. Cao Guangjiu was secretly anxious but dared not say a word more, only sitting in respectful attendance.

After a long while, Elder Shi asked, "How is the matter progressing?"

"By the Master's blessing, very smoothly." Cao Guangjiu immediately recounted his and Gou Chengxuan's recent activities. "...Placards and nursery rhymes have already spread. Recently, Phoenix Mountain Villa has tightened its guard. Zhao Yingong seldom ventures out—he must already be frightened."

Then he reported Hao Yuan's plan of sending people to turn Master Zhao's "Big Maid" within the Villa. This news piqued Elder Shi's interest.

"Can it be done?"

"Hao Yuan seems confident."

"Heh." Elder Shi smiled and nodded but did not pursue the matter further. He pondered a moment and asked, "What do you think of this Hao Yuan?"

"His thinking is meticulous, his actions ruthless. He is absolutely no ordinary person."

"Brother Jiu, you are also a local strongman of some standing—is that all you can see?" There was mockery in Elder Shi's tone.

"Elder Shi flatters me." Cao Guangjiu hastened to rouse himself. "Then forgive me for being presumptuous..."

"Speak freely."

"Hao Yuan's shrewdness and capability go without saying. But in my view, this person possesses a rare gift of perception. When observing events or reading people, his insights are penetrating. Most crucially, no matter where he is or with whom he associates, within three words or two phrases he can make people feel favorably disposed to him—willing to be commanded by him. He uses no money, no coercion; yet people trust him. He has been in Nanxiawa only a few months, yet already directs the common folk there like limbs responding to the mind."

"You make him sound almost magical. Does he practice sorcery?"

"Absolutely not." Cao Guangjiu was emphatic. "He burns no incense, worships no gods, and has never performed any kind of ritual. I once took an opportunity to search his belongings—nothing unusual. No scriptures, no ritual implements. He has never treated illness or prescribed medicine to anyone in Nanxiawa."

"This is strange." Elder Shi stroked his beard. "Could it be through good deeds?"

"Exactly. But he has very little money. Apart from the silver given by the Master, I've seen no other source of income. Even if he gives everything away for good deeds, it's quite limited. Additionally, he opened a charity school in Nanxiawa." Cao Guangjiu said. "This person possesses an innate ability to bewitch hearts: a few words and he speaks directly into people's souls, reasonable and comfortable. He makes them convinced, orally and in their hearts."

Elder Shi listened without revealing any expression. Then he asked, "So you're saying Hao Yuan is 'absolutely not a thing to remain in a pond'?"

Cao Guangjiu's face shifted instantly. He was experienced enough to recognize the implications in Elder Shi's phrase. He dared not respond directly, and after a long pause, mumbled: "Surely not to that extent..."

"Brother Jiu, could it be that you too have been won over by him?" Elder Shi smiled and shook his head. "The matter of this Hao Yuan—my Master has also had people investigate his words and deeds separately. Setting aside everything else, simply his qualities alone—not greedy for money, not afraid of hardship, not fearing death, not bowing to power—beloved by the common people... Brother Jiu has also read the old books. Surely you recognize what kind of person this is?"

"Yes, yes." Sweat had already begun to flow down Cao Guangjiu's forehead.

"Hao Yuan's ambition is not small. He is not yet successful. If ever he becomes successful—what would a Zhao Yingong even count for?"

"Yes. The Master is wise." Cao Guangjiu secretly felt relief. It seemed the Master intended to dispose of Hao Yuan after using him. Fortunately, he had spoken truthfully just now and had not covered for him before Elder Shi. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"And Gou Chengxuan?" Elder Shi suddenly shifted the topic.

"He's very capable. Though young, he is remarkably composed. He handles affairs effectively—clearly someone who has seen a great deal." Cao Guangjiu spoke while feeling a chill at the back of his neck. Who knew whether someone was asking Gou Chengxuan the same questions about him?

"And—?"

Cao Guangjiu understood. If he did not offer something "essential," Elder Shi would never be satisfied.

"He seems to harbor an immense hatred—especially toward Zhao Yingong. I don't know whether there is a personal grudge." Cao Guangjiu spoke carefully. This Gou Chengxuan was no easy person to deal with either. His Broken Boot Party had sharp eyes for reading people. From his first meeting with Gou Chengxuan, Cao Guangjiu had recognized that this man had suffered great disaster and tremendous bitterness, forging an extremely resolute mind. These bare-sticks from Guangdong, unafraid of killing and beatings, were inevitably a hundred times more vicious than Cao Guangjiu's Broken Boot Party, which had families and property to protect.

"Were it not so, would my Master employ him?" Elder Shi smiled with evident satisfaction.

"Yes, yes." Cao Guangjiu forced several hollow laughs, hoping this terrifying topic would end. With what he knew, he was deeply aware of how formidable both Hao Yuan and Gou Chengxuan were. He had no wish to misspeak and offend either.

"You are also a man with family and property. As long as you work honestly and handle matters well, my Master will certainly reward you generously."

"I dare not accept such thanks." Cao Guangjiu assumed the lowest possible posture. "I only beg for the Master's cultivation!"

"Easily done." Elder Shi nodded, picked up his tea cup to moisten his throat again, and then asked about preparations for the attack on Phoenix Mountain Villa scheduled for the fifteenth of the seventh month.

Cao Guangjiu reported that manpower had already been arranged. He had contacted more than ten Fighting Society heads to use their men, put down deposits, and was only waiting for the fifteenth to move in concert.

During the period of secrecy, he had revealed neither the target nor the plan for joint action—all to prevent leaks.

"...I can probably recruit seven or eight hundred men. These are veterans of brawling and fighting. They'll be sufficient."

Phoenix Mountain Villa had a population of at least twenty or thirty thousand, but most were refugees—unorganized, untrained, without weapons; they posed no threat. What truly needed to be dealt with was the Villa's few hundred family soldiers.

To this day, Cao Guangjiu still did not know the exact number of family soldiers in the Villa. Based on reports from several peripheral informants, he estimated three or four hundred at most.

"Enough people?"

"Enough. These few hundred are the core. Besides them, we'll inevitably need to incite and coerce a batch more. Otherwise, the commotion won't be big enough and we won't stir up sufficient scale."

Besides Fighting Society members, Cao Guangjiu also planned to contact Zhang Guangtian and mobilize a batch of Buddhists to "Defend the Way and Break the Demons" when the time came. Furthermore, poor people incited by the placards could be lured to the Villa gate.

As he spoke, Cao Guangjiu hesitated briefly, then continued: "Only—we're a bit short on silver—"

"Hasn't the Master already allocated five hundred taels for this operation?" Elder Shi's expression showed displeasure, as though suspecting Cao Guangjiu's appetite was too large. "Giving five mace as a deposit to each of these few hundred Fighting Society men should be enough?"

Cao Guangjiu was naturally padding accounts and skimming, but raising the silver matter now was not for his own pocket.

"Elder Shi, you do not know. The Villa has family soldiers, and Zhao Yingong is also part of the gentry. In the Fighting Society's view, that's a tough nut to crack. They'll have to risk casualties. If the Fighting Society men don't receive a generous reward at the time, and they create trouble by refusing to advance, it will be very troublesome."

"Then what do you propose?"

"Please convey to the Master: before battle, a heavy reward is needed. At least one tael per man."

"So the Fighting Society is just like government soldiers, after all." The scholar smiled. "Wanting settling-in allowance before the fight, then wanting battle-bonus when they actually move."

"I wouldn't dare say that." Cao Guangjiu hurried to explain. "Elder Shi, you don't know the Fighting Society's rules. These men's black eyes only recognize white silver. Without money to embolden them, they absolutely refuse to act."

"Very well, as you wish. Silver will be prepared then." Elder Shi snapped his fan shut with a clack, smiling. "Once Phoenix Mountain Villa is broken, will there be any shortage of money to take? These people—truly rat-eyed, seeing only what's an inch away!"

"Thank you, Elder Shi, for understanding the situation below! In addition, please convey to the Master: we need to prepare a few lives."

"Lives?"
