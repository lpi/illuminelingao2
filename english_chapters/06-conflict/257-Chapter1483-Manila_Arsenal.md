# Chapter 1483 - Manila Arsenal

Manila's ordinary white citizens and merchants initially disliked the new munitions factory standing in the suburbs. Besides the fact that the Governor had invested money scraped from monopoly laws and special taxes into this project that brought them no benefit, there were reasons stemming from the factory itself. For colonial residents far from Europe, the factory was a frightening novelty. No other place in the entire Philippines had concentrated so many machines and furnaces. The banging of metal and the ceaseless drilling, planing, and chiseling of various tools created continuous noise, causing complaints even from Spaniards in Manila city nearly ten kilometers away, as they could no longer recover their past tranquility of dozing all day. Moreover, the large number of recruited pagan Chinese and local natives gathering around the factory caused Spaniards all sorts of illusory anxieties; people often mentioned "the threat of thousands of savage workers."

Recently, another terrifying rumor circulated in the colonial European circles: that the fanatical priest Paul was manufacturing a terrible new explosive in the factory, so powerful that a small bag could level the entire city. This wasn't purely rumor; dull explosions, like thunder on the horizon, were often heard from the direction of the arsenal. Some people also claimed to see oxcarts carrying severed limbs and shredded flesh leaving the factory at night for secret burial in the wilderness.

Aisui Saburo leaned lazily against a crude sentry shed made of scrap wood and straw, facing the main road leading to the factory workshops, completely oblivious to the fate of possibly being blown to dust at any moment. This former ashigaru leader had come to Luzon partly out of faith and partly with the delusion of making a fortune overseas. Unfortunately, after Lord Ukon and Lord Naito died of illness successively, the Southern Barbarian Governor's regard for Japanese immigrants gradually declined. After years of living hand to mouth, Aisui Saburo's dream of getting rich had long vanished like smoke. However, being a soldier and sentry for the Southern Barbarian Governor was much more comfortable than bending over in the fields. He calculated that he could eat his fill at every meal. Although the Southern Barbarians weren't very generous, only issuing some rice and dried fish as salary, combined with taro and vegetables his Tagalog wife grew around the house, it was no problem to scrape by feeding a family of four. If he could rotate to a juicy job like guarding a tax checkpoint next time, maybe he could scrape scrounge a few small coins to drink a few cups of tuba wine made from coconut sap in a small restaurant opened by Chinese in the Parian and enjoy a plate of roast pork. The taste of rich, fragrant pork seemed to linger on his tongue. Aisui Saburo leaned against the sentry shed's wooden pillar, falling into happy meditation, smiling with mouth half-open, saliva flowing like a small river down his face blackened by the tropical sun.

"Hey," Aisui Saburo startled awake by a loud greeting and saw Captain Kuroshima Jubei standing before him. This ronin from Owari was said to have fled to Manila after killing someone in Hoi An port, Cochinchina. "Aisui-kun, show some dignity. Letting your mind wander while on sentry duty again?" Jubei pointed forward: "A carriage is coming."

If in Madrid or Seville, people wouldn't bother giving a second glance to this plain, even crude, two-wheeled carriage. Pulled by a listless, stunted Chinese pony, the unpainted log carriage body had nothing but an oilcloth canopy. But in the Philippines where horses were more expensive than humans, the factory area was filled with oxcarts transporting timber and iron parts. A carriage, even the crudest one, was a symbol of nobility.

Aisui Saburo walked up to meet the carriage, arquebus held to his chest, but the hammer wasn't cocked to the ready position—better not startle the noble in the carriage, he thought. The new arquebuses made by the Southern Barbarians were very neat, eliminating the troublesome and dangerous slow match. Bite open the paper cartridge made of abaca paper, stuff it into the barrel, place a small round copper cap on the touchhole, pull the hammer back, and pull the trigger to fire the bullet.

Aisui Saburo, familiar with Japanese-style matchlocks, was quite unused to this new gadget when he first got it. He had many accidental discharges on the drill ground, provoking the Southern Barbarian officers' rage and receiving quite a few "bin-ta" (slaps) from the captain.

Although this new invention had outstanding performance, few people used this new weapon because the arsenal could produce very few small copper caps. Production was intermittent and supply unstable; only a few newly formed Japanese companies were equipped with small quantities. For the local Spanish garrison, clumsy matchlocks remained their main weapon.

Unexpectedly, what emerged from under the canopy wasn't some Southern Barbarian lord, but an "Indio." Although he wore a hip-length silk openwork "Barong" like a native squire and carried a short cane to show off style like the Southern Barbarians, the white-edged wrinkles scraped by sea wind on his face, the dark brown sunspots covering his exposed skin, and the agility with which he jumped off the carriage—anyone could recognize this was an old hand making a living on the sea.

"What is this old sea dog barking about?" Aisui Saburo felt puzzled. In his days making a living in the Philippines, he had long learned Tagalog and Pampangan, spoke passable Spanish, and could barely understand Hokkien and Cantonese. What this Filipino sailor spoke was similar to several languages he knew but not completely intelligible.

The sailor seemed impatient with the chicken-talking-to-duck communication. He reached out and pulled out a paper, waving it ceaselessly at the Japanese soldier. Although Aisui Saburo didn't recognize many Latin letters, the Manila city coat of arms printed on the paper and the bright red Governor's seal stamped in sealing wax swaying before his eyes for a long time finally made him understand. He looked at Captain Kuroshima who had walked far away, then at the carriage only nobles could ride, and finally lowered his gun and waved his hand. The carriage swayed as it drove into the factory area. Aisui Saburo returned to the sentry shed, soon falling back into his daydream about roast pork.

Fernando Marcos leaned back in the seat under the canopy. After wasting so much breath on those Japanese, he felt it was strenuous to say even one more word. Nothing was more tiring than exhausting one's tongue explaining who one was and what one could do to people of this world.

In another spacetime, Marcos's career as a sailor on various ships engaged in illegal trades had lasted over 20 years. He once thought he was a born lucky guy. Whether the smuggling ship he piloted was detained by the Korean Coast Guard, or the smuggling vessel he was on encountered a Russian Border Guard armed patrol ship and was shot up with smoking fire, nearly sending him to meet the Dragon King, at least he preserved his life in the end. But he never dreamed fate would play a big joke in such a refreshingly new way, throwing him and everyone on the *Mackerel* to a strange world he still hadn't completely figured out. When the lifeboat they were in was overturned by wind and waves and they fell into the sea, Marcos almost thought he was done for. Fortunately, after soaking in seawater with the *Mackerel*'s engineer Aquino for most of the day, just as they were about to lose consciousness, they were rescued by an Anhai ship bound for Zhongzuosuo. Zheng Zhilong and his men initially regarded these two Filipinos dressed strangely and unable to explain their origins as Dutch spies, then later as accomplices of the hair-shaven thieves. These two unlucky guys were thrown into a water dungeon. After various tortures were applied in turn, everyone's final conclusion was that they were just two half-crazy guys full of gibberish, posing no danger but of no great use either.

If Fernando Marcos had heard of the idiom "Dragon-Slaying Skill," he would have deeply understood that this Chinese allusion was a vivid portrayal of his situation. There was no GPS or Loran navigation station in Zheng's territory for him to use, nor diesel engines or other power equipment needing Aquino's care and repair. They knew nothing about the work on 17th-century Chinese junks, not even qualifying as sailors. These two unlucky guys of no value to the Zheng family were forced into being the lowest, humblest slave laborers, doing coolie work under the overseer's whip. Occasionally, someone would use their anuses to experience "exotic flavor." The inhuman torture continued for years. Aquino grew weaker by the day and finally died of malaria. If not for being discovered and redeemed to Manila by Hale while building a cannon foundry in Zhongzuosuo, Marcos would inevitably have followed in his footsteps before long: collapsing dead for this or that reason, a stone tied to the corpse, and thrown into the sea for fish and shrimp to gnaw into white bones.

The squeaking sound of water wheels turning and the noise of metal colliding and hammering with various blunt instruments grew closer, pulling Marcos out of the terrified fantasy of his future. The wooden workshop doors were open. In the open space near the gate wall were lined up the factory's products and semi-finished products. Marcos poked his head out from under the canopy to look: a row of cannon barrels flashing with green glints lay there. These were bronze cannons recently removed from various fortress batteries and galleons in Manila. After grinding and washing, their bores were milled again by water-powered milling machines, then rifled by rifling machines.

Not far away was a row of bronze cannons mounted on two-wheeled carriages, not yet dismantled. These were field guns of the Spanish garrison, which would also undergo similar modification.

Although the level of national education in 20th-century Philippines was limited, and Marcos hadn't manipulated guns in his illegal career, he understood the concept that rifled weapons shot more accurately and farther than smoothbore weapons.

Under a bamboo shed further away lay some brand-new cannons. Black, thick as soda bottles, were cast iron heavy guns to equip fortresses. Smaller blue-gray ones were copper-cast field guns, few in number, looking sparse. Several workers were performing heavy grinding and washing work around the gun bodies.
