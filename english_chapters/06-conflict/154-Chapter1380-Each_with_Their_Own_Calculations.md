# Chapter 1380 - Each with Their Own Calculations

It seemed the Council of Elders' actions were changing the course of history more and more. It was just that historically, the matter of switching to sea transport had always encountered great resistance, yet this time it had proceeded so smoothly. Obviously, some factors he didn't know about had played a role.

Shen Tingyang was very talkative, visibly in high spirits now that the ambitions and proposals he had held for years finally had a chance to be tried. From his words, Zhao Yingong generally learned that this direct transport of grain and pay from Jiangnan to Liaodong was a proposal from Minister of War Xiong Mingyu - this Minister Xiong, due to the Council of Elders' intervention, had appeared decisive and capable during the entire Dengzhou suppression. Therefore, his standing in the emperor's mind was still acceptable. Although he had received a disciplinary measure, he hadn't lost his official position and been dismissed as in the old time and space. He continued to muddle through in the increasingly difficult position of Minister of War.

As for why Xiong Mingyu, this consistently wishy-washy slippery bureaucrat, would suddenly propose such a bold suggestion, Zhao Yingong found it unsurprising - he was now anxious to restore "imperial favor." He could only take risks and make moves to demonstrate his "talent" and make the emperor recognize that he was still "useful." The Dengzhou Incident had caused consequences that could not be remedied simply by "suppression." Sun Yuanhua, who was busy with the aftermath in Dengzhou, was working himself half to death, but still bore the "dismissed from office" disciplinary measure to this day - Chongzhen would not easily forgive these main responsible parties.

However, the reason Xiong Mingyu could make such a bold proposal was obviously because someone had given him great confidence. This person was probably not as simple as obviously-positioned Grand Secretaries like Zhou Yanru or Xu Guangqi. It must have been the result of behind-the-scenes maneuvering by someone extremely powerful in the court.

Could it be Zhang Pu the "Heavenly Master"? Zhao Yingong felt this was most likely. Ever since he personally went to Taicang last time to promote the proposition of abolishing canal transport for sea transport, he had felt at the time that this Mr. Zhang was very interested in it - the Fushe Society largely represented the interests of groups centered on the gentry and landlords of Southern Zhili, and the canal transport had always been a burden they complained most about. Therefore, they had the most motivation.

Xiong Mingyu's memorial had received support from all sides. Because Shen Tingyang had long been working on this matter in the capital, Xiong Mingyu had recommended him and also presented his "Book on Sea Transport" and "Map of Sea Transport." After court deliberation, the emperor and ministers all felt it was worth a try to relieve Liaodong's urgent need. So they conferred upon him the nominal title of Secretary of the Grand Secretariat and full authority to handle this matter.

"If this matter succeeds, there is also the possibility of switching tribute grain to sea transport in the future!"

As long as grain could be transported directly from Jiangnan to Liaodong this time, it would prove that sea transport was reliable and cheap. Then discussing sea transport for the white grain from Taicang, or even expanding to abolishing canal transport for sea transport, could all be implemented step by step in a gradual and orderly manner.

Zhao Yingong knew things weren't that simple. The force of habit and obstruction by vested interest groups meant any reform would encounter great resistance. Historically, Shen Tingyang's sea transport experiment had achieved complete success, yet canal transport still used the inefficient Grand Canal.

However, since history had already changed somewhat due to their arrival, this change would inevitably trigger a chain of reactions - the butterfly effect wasn't just empty talk.

Zhao Yingong appropriately showed a look of "elation and encouragement," saying a few agreeable words, just waiting for the other party to speak up. Shen Tingyang had specifically invited him to come discuss. There must naturally be specific cooperation to negotiate.

However, Shen Tingyang's pleased expression didn't last long. It soon became grave. "To tell the truth, the reason this elder brother specifically invited worthy younger brother to Shanghai is to discuss some important matters."

"If there's anywhere I can be of use, I will certainly serve." Zhao Yingong nodded repeatedly, his expression very solemn - what followed was the crux of the matter. Shen Tingyang must have felt there were certain matters that were difficult to handle, which was why he had specifically come to find him.

Since he came to find him, needless to say, the Merchants Bureau had to be involved in this deal. If he could use this opportunity to bring the coastal shipping routes under the Merchants Bureau's control, his company would be a legitimate "Ming Dynasty official ship." In coastal areas, that would really mean smuggling and illicit trade, doing anything with full justification. Thinking of this, Zhao Yingong couldn't help but feel a bit excited.

Only then did Shen Tingyang get to the detailed issues of this grain and pay transport.

This time, the grain and pay being transported to Liaodong for supplying Guan-Ning Garrison was 50,000 shi of husked rice. This transport volume was not a heavy burden for Shen Tingyang's sea transport capacity. A brand-new large sand boat had a carrying capacity of about 4,000 shi. Using thirteen or fourteen large sand boats could meet the demand. The Shen family had as many as one or two hundred sand boats, many of which were already sailing the Northern Sea route. Completing the grain transport mission was more than sufficient.

But things were often not as simple as they appeared. After Shen Tingyang had gained Xiong Mingyu's support and submitted his memorial, although he quickly obtained the edict for trial grain and pay transport, the subsequent issues made him feel very thorny.

This 50,000 shi of grain was to be allocated from Jiangnan - the amount would be deducted from this year's tribute grain.

This was originally a method convenient for both public and private interests. But when Shen Tingyang went to the Provincial Administration Commission to handle the matter, he hit a wall.

The Provincial Administration Commission refused to allocate grain, saying that many prefectures and counties in Southern Zhili had suffered floods and droughts last year, resulting in insufficient reserves everywhere. Spring also urgently required large amounts of seed grain. The provincial treasury really had no grain to allocate, and so on.

"This elder brother originally thought this was merely the customary practice of asking for bribes. Unexpectedly, the official in charge was impervious to persuasion. No matter who went to intercede, he wouldn't even accept bribes. He just said there was no grain and insisted on disbursing cash equivalent instead."

"Cash equivalent?" Zhao Yingong was startled. Cash equivalent, as the name implied, meant not disbursing grain but rather disbursing silver according to grain prices. This was very common in the Ming and Qing. Because silver was easier to transport than grain and easier to use, for distant regions with poor transportation conditions, the cost of paying cash equivalent in silver was much lower than transporting grain.

Cash conversion involved issues like silver purity, melting losses, and other tricks. It had no fewer opportunities for corruption than transporting husked rice. Most crucially, after embezzlement, it eliminated the step of converting to cash. Therefore, it was very popular among officials.

"...As you know, this is currently the so-called hungry months of May and June. The grain price outside is three mace per dou. One shi of rice, even buying wholesale from grain merchants, costs over two taels of silver per shi. And grain prices are currently rising, so it might not even stop there."

Zhao Yingong now understood: most likely the Provincial Administration Commission's cash equivalent was based on the "official price." He asked: "How much does the official price give?"

"One tael and two mace." Shen Tingyang smiled bitterly. "One tael and two mace can only buy six or seven dou of rice wholesale. To gather 50,000 shi of rice would require putting in at least 40,000 taels of silver."

The Provincial Administration Commission's cash equivalent price was based on one tael and two mace, but when actually claiming reimbursement from the Ministry of Revenue, it was at the rate of two taels per shi. Back and forth, this 40,000 taels became the handling personnel's benefit!

Compared to this 40,000 taels, a mere few hundred taels of "customary fees" and "bribes" counted for nothing. No wonder they used such high-sounding reasons.

Zhao Yingong silently cursed officials for being shameless, really being excessively greedy.

"What is to be done? Surely Brother Jiming cannot use his own silver to handle this."

"Exactly." Shen Tingyang said resentfully, "This elder brother is also half a businessman. There are all kinds of strange business methods under heaven, but only loss-making business cannot be done. This time transporting grain and pay for Guan-Ning, although this elder brother's intention is to repay the court, I cannot take my own family's money to plug those corrupt officials' dog holes."

In ordinary times, since the Shen family was a shipping dynasty, they also had commercial networks. It didn't matter which waterway grain wharf it was. As long as there was cheap grain, they could buy in bulk. Not only would they not lose money, they might even make a small profit.

But this time, what Shen Tingyang encountered was an even more troublesome matter. It turned out that the secretaries of Guan-Ning Garrison responsible for coordinating grain and pay transport in the capital had already secretly let it be known that Guan-Ning would absolutely not accept "rotten and spoiled old granary rice." They specified that they wanted cash equivalent silver.

"Wouldn't this problem be easily solved?" Zhao Yingong didn't understand. Since the Guan-Ning army wanted silver, directly transporting 60,000 taels of silver would be convenient and would avoid the hassle of price differences.

Shen Tingyang smiled bitterly and shook his head: "Worthy younger brother, you still know too little about the tricks of officialdom. The Ministry of Revenue's reimbursement is two taels of silver per shi. How could the Guan-Ning army be willing to accept cash equivalent silver at one tael and two mace?"

No matter how they calculated, Shen Tingyang, who was handling this sea transport, would lose money. This was still only the loss on the "main item." The various other "expenses" and "entertainment fees" all added up were also not a small sum. In the past, by "floating loss" of a portion, these expenses could be offset with some left over. But this time, the gap in the main item was really too large, and Shen Tingyang also felt at a loss.

"Moreover, for this sea transport, many grandees in the court have exerted great effort, and they must all be properly shown appreciation." Shen Tingyang thought of this enormous subsequent expense and couldn't help but knit his brows.

These personnel expenses absolutely could not be skimped on. Otherwise, he feared he couldn't even get the cash equivalent silver for sea transport on time - when yamen wanted to make things difficult for people, their methods came one after another, and they would never let you catch them making a mistake. Without grandees in the court speaking up, he couldn't even pass the first hurdle.

Originally, according to his thinking, this sea transport of grain and pay was serving the court. Even if he couldn't make money for the time being, it didn't matter. As long as expenses could break even, that would be fine. If canal transport could be abolished for sea transport in the future, there would be immense benefits for both country and self. The immediate small profit could well be set aside.

Unexpectedly, as soon as the edict for this sea transport of grain and pay came out, he found himself suddenly standing at the center of the storm. All parties seemed to think he had obtained an immense fat position and were all eyeing him hungrily to devour him.

"Unexpectedly, wanting to get things done is so difficult!" When Shen Tingyang said this, he couldn't help but heave a long sigh. "I wonder if worthy younger brother has any good strategy?"

While he was speaking, Zhao Yingong had already thought of several ideas. He recalled the materials from the "Compendium of Ming Political and Social Conditions" given to him by the External Intelligence Bureau, as well as the various commercial intelligence collected by Mountain-Sea Five Routes over the past year or more. He already had a countermeasure in mind.

He coughed lightly: "In my humble opinion, this matter is not impossible to accomplish..."

Shen Tingyang seemed to have been waiting for precisely these words from him. His gaze became solemn as he watched him: "Please enlighten me, worthy younger brother!"
