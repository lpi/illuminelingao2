# Chapter 1279 Surfacing

"On D-Day, while the 1st Marine Expeditionary Detachment was clearing Zhongzuosuo City, they discovered two Lingao-manufactured naval guns mounted on the city wall. After verifying the inscriptions, we confirmed these cannons came from Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64—the vessel that went missing from the Navy some time ago."

The screen displayed two smoothbore cannons lying amid broken bricks and sandbags. The gun mounts were damaged, but the cannons themselves remained intact. Cast inscriptions, emblems, and dates were clearly visible.

Photographs of both cannons appeared—full views and close-ups from multiple angles, showing gun bodies and the wrecked mounts. Only Lingao's artillery foundry could manufacture cannons of this type.

Then came a dozen additional images: ammunition, fuses, and the supporting tools found near the guns.

"Very complete," Wen Desi observed.

"Yes. Upon my order, the Planning Academy's Special Search Team conducted a carpet search around the artillery position and recovered the ammunition and equipment supporting these cannons. All of it was standard issue from Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64."

"Wait..." Wen Desi raised a hand as an image of a shrapnel fuse appeared. "They were also using this type of fuse?"

"Correct. According to reports from Shi Zhiqi and the marines, they came under fire from these two cannons during the assault—including shrapnel shells."

A low murmur of discussion rippled through the room. This particular fuse represented 19th-century technology. In this time-space, it was a unique capability of Lingao. Apart from the Fubo Army's naval and land artillery, absolutely no other armed force could employ such fuses correctly.

"So there are people trained by us within Zheng Zhilong's ranks?"

"We have no definitive evidence of that yet." Xu Ke's voice remained measured. "However, the Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 incident was indeed the work of the Zheng clique. I will address this point as my final item."

"Very well. Please continue."

"Yes." Xu Ke clicked the mouse. The weapons workshop on Gulangyu materialized on the screen.

"This is a weapons workshop newly constructed by the Zheng clique that we discovered on Gulangyu—primarily designed for casting cannons." He displayed photos and surveying materials of the various facilities and appliances, one by one.

"We submitted photos and surveying data for the entire workshop to several Senators in the Manufacturing Supervision Department who possess deep expertise in cannon casting and production organization. Their conclusion: this is a very well-designed cannon casting workshop. The design concepts underlying some of its facilities not only surpass the East Asian standards of this era but exceed current European best practices as well."

Xu Ke advanced to the next group of photos.

"This is one of two facilities the Manufacturing Supervision Department flagged as most suspicious: the reverberatory furnace."

Most attendees knew what a reverberatory furnace was. The principle was simple enough, and construction difficulty was not prohibitive. After Japan's forced opening by the Black Ships and before the Meiji Restoration, the Shogunate had engaged in a brief Westernization Movement that included building reverberatory furnaces under European guidance for cannon casting. Though those cannons remained smoothbore, the pig iron from secondary smelting in the higher-temperature reverberatory furnace was purer, yielding improved quality.

"The Senators in the metallurgy and casting sectors confirmed that the furnaces in these photos are reverberatory furnaces designed for secondary smelting of pig iron. The Great Library's Science and Technology Group has verified that reverberatory furnaces of this structure have not yet appeared in this time-space. Therefore, it is impossible that some European technician helped Zheng Zhilong build them."

Another stir ran through the audience.

"The second item remains incomplete." Xu Ke clicked to a photo of a structure resembling a square watchtower—the one he had observed in the cannon yard—along with various bamboo and wooden accessories found nearby.

"After review by Senators from the mechanical and construction sectors, they unanimously agreed this is an unfinished windmill. No bearings or transmission systems that would have been installed inside were found nearby, suggesting it had not yet been completed. The Senator from the construction company noted that judging solely from the building's structure, this windmill closely resembles those we currently deploy for water lifting and drainage."

"Zheng Zhilong certainly didn't build this to grind flour or pump water." Someone below cracked a joke. Xu Ke allowed himself a small smile.

"The Senator from the mechanical sector analyzed two possibilities for the windmill's purpose. One: to power a boring machine for cannons. Two: to grind gunpowder. Perhaps both. Regardless, this is clearly an effort to improve work efficiency."

Xu Ke then detailed the workshop's facilities, material stockpiles, and craftsman recruitment—with particular emphasis on the crucibles.

Using crucibles served one purpose: obtaining high-quality steel. Yet in cannon casting, neither China nor the West had required steel before the mid-19th century. Moreover, the yield from crucible smelting was too meager. It sufficed for manufacturing small quantities of swords or tools but proved uneconomical for cannons.

If the goal were high-quality swords, that was beneath notice for the Zheng Zhilong clique, who controlled the trade route to Japan's legendary blade-smiths. The possibility of sword manufacture could be ruled out.

"...From the on-site investigation and captive confessions, we learned this workshop is nearing completion. Judging from the large quantities of cannon-casting materials already stockpiled and the many craftsmen recruited in advance, the Zheng Zhilong clique holds very high expectations for this cannon factory. This may relate to their plans for refreshing naval equipment." He clicked forward. "In the shipyard on the beach near the cannon works, we found several large Fujian ships under construction—improved designs—and two are approaching completion. We are considering towing them back to Hong Kong for further examination. These are the photographs."

"There are ribs, there are decks, and this unusual length-to-width ratio—I estimate roughly four to one." Wen Desi studied the images. "This ship is an improved version of the Fujian junk. The deck and ribs have been modified to accommodate cannon installation."

"Yes." Xu Ke nodded. "The Navy's experts concur."

"So, up to this point, aside from the shipyard, this munitions workshop has not yet begun production?"

"Correct. There are no traces of production activity in the workshop—despite assessments indicating they could have commenced operations. According to captive testimony, they were awaiting 'foreign cannons.' After analysis, we believe the captives' term refers to 'sample cannons.' In Jinmen and Xiamen, we found cannons manufactured by various nations—British, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish castings—ranging from one-pound to twenty-four-pound calibers. Furthermore, they also possessed the two guns from our ship." He paused. "Obviously, they do not lack foreign cannons."

Finally, Xu Ke turned to the issue of Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64.

"According to our interrogation of captured prisoners, we obtained the following intelligence: The patrol boat was brought back by Zheng Zhilong's brother, Zheng Zhifeng, and others some time ago. It underwent repairs at the dock. Simultaneously, the cannons and some equipment on the ship were dismantled."

A portrait of a young man appeared on screen, labeled: **Zheng Zhifeng**.

"We failed to capture Zheng Zhifeng. Among the high-ranking captives we did take, knowledge of this matter was limited. Nevertheless, we gained something valuable: several staff members confessed that Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 was hijacked by someone the Zheng family hired at great expense, then handed over to them."

A fleeting commotion stirred in the conference room before subsiding.

"...To ascertain the specifics, our bureau conducted investigations in Jinmen, Xiamen, Anping, and other locations. Regrettably, Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 was not found, nor was the remaining equipment—including the typewriter and equipped ammunition. They appear to have vanished.

"Considering that capturing Harbor Patrol Boat No. 64 nearly intact is not something ordinary pirates could accomplish, we are intensely curious about who did it. Though we failed to apprehend Zheng Zhifeng himself, we captured many of his staff, personal soldiers, and household servants. Through further interrogation, we learned this was the work of a Japanese Christian named Paul. Moreover, this individual also promised to supply the Zheng family with firearms, including cannons, claiming they are 'not much inferior to Lingao's.'"

The faces around the room grew more solemn.

"Since Zheng Zhilong kept the details of his contact with Mr. Paul secret, his staff could provide no additional information. But through interrogation of Zheng Zhifeng's entourage, we obtained a portrait of Mr. Paul."

A portrait appeared: the face of a typical East Asian man, approximately thirty-five to forty years old, in his prime.

"Those present may not necessarily recognize this person. But presumably, everyone knows Rando."

Xu Ke paused. He felt reluctant to mention a colleague in this context, yet understood his duty all too well.

"When Senator Rando first arrived in Lingao, the Political Security General Bureau interrogated him extensively. At that time, he described how his small boat encountered a storm while crossing time-space. Aboard were two Filipino crew members, a German chief mate, and a Japanese man."

A photograph of a white man's naked corpse appeared on screen.

"This is the German chief mate, who died from a head injury sustained when he hit the console. His name was Paul." Xu Ke paused deliberately, allowing the attendees to organize their thoughts. "The two Filipino crew members went missing during the storm—presumably swept into the waves. Paul died. The Japanese man was named Black, and he climbed onto the lifeboat with Rando. Later, waves overturned the lifeboat, and they were separated. Rando never encountered him again."

A portrait appeared: an East Asian man of approximately thirty years, with short hair, no beard, a sturdy build, a relatively fair complexion, and a smooth forehead.

"This is the portrait of Black, drawn based on Rando's description at the time." Xu Ke superimposed it with the previous portrait. The contours and features aligned remarkably well. "As you can see, the two images match closely."
