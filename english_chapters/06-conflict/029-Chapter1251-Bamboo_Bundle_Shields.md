# Chapter 1251 - Bamboo Bundle Shields

The First Expeditionary Force completed assembly on the beach.

Three Marine companies were numerically thin, but the firepower they possessed was the strongest in this time and space: Hall rifles, typewriters, and Trial Year 32 Battalion Guns with friction recoil absorption devices—although only three guns, their range far exceeded the 12-pound mountain howitzers commonly equipped in the past. They possessed ultra-long range and a rate of fire unbearable for all armies in this era. According to staff estimates, most armies of this time couldn't withstand more than a few shots before fleeing in panic.

Shi Zhiqi was high-spirited. The term "First Expeditionary Force" sounded much grander than "Marine 1st Battalion"—and much more "American." The Marines' uniforms had been recently changed, completely breaking away from the Fubo Army's past Type 65 style. They now wore a knockoff version of the USMC combat utility uniform. Of course, the Lingao version MCCUU had no camouflage nor special fabrics—just the common cotton or cotton-linen blend of Lingao uniforms, dyed the most rustic dark blue with indigo. The cap was also the iconic octagonal cap.

Lingao couldn't equip Marines with modern combat boots, so they still used integrated canvas gaiters, equipped with Army general-purpose webbing.

Shi Zhiqi jumped down from the small boat. Clenching a pipe in his teeth, a saber at his waist, and a leather riding crop in hand, he looked every inch the commanding officer. Glancing at the assembled Marine detachment—each man spirited, back straight, quite in the style of Imperial Marines—he couldn't help but swell with ambition. He waved the riding crop, blew a few smoke rings, and shouted:

"Lads, fuck'em!"

"Yes! Comrade Lieutenant Colonel," all Marines shouted back. "Fuck'em! Serve the Senate and the People!"

He waved his riding crop downward: "All units, move out!"

Three companies advanced in three columns, the fire support detachment composed of cannons and typewriters following behind. According to plan, the First Expeditionary Force was to wait for heavy artillery to land before advancing. But the fleet transporting artillery had failed to arrive in time. Speed is precious in war. To prevent Zheng Zhilong and his treasure from escaping, and also to prevent the enemy from setting fire to the city in despair, Shi Zhiqi decided to advance on the walled city immediately, striving to rout the enemy in one decisive blow.

Zhongzuo Garrison's walls rose less than six meters, built of traditional Chinese brick-encased stone. Being only a Wei-Suo city, the walls weren't thick. Not only was its anti-artillery capability weak, but defensive works like towers on the walls were also few. Shi Zhiqi felt he could take it even without relying on heavy artillery—besides, he still had three battalion guns and a platoon of assault engineers available. Just deliver explosives directly to blow open the gate.

Shi Zhiqi didn't believe Zheng Zhilong's pirate troops were willing to fight him bayonet to bayonet in the city—probably only the Japanese Guard with severe *chuunibyou* flare-ups would be willing to send themselves to their deaths.

However, Xu Ke, responsible for collecting and analyzing Zheng consortium intelligence, thought this possibility unlikely. The Japanese Guard and Black Guard were bluntly Zheng Zhilong's "foreign house guards"—death warriors fed full with silver, Zheng Zhilong's last capital. Once the walled city fell, the general trend would be irreversible; Zheng Zhilong still had to rely on his guards to cover his escape. How could he bear to leave them in the city for street fighting with Marines, burning jade and stone together?

"Marine Songbook Page 2, 'Song of Marine Warriors'! Sing in unison!" Sergeants ordered loudly.

The Marines' iron-hobnailed canvas leather-soled combat boots trampled Xiamen's beach, kicking up clouds of dust. The soldiers sang loudly in unison:

*I am the Marine Corps, I am a killing weapon,*
*Between flashes of red light letting your blood splash,*
*Don't doubt, this is my turf.*

*When you rush in I am smiling,*
*Because victory belongs to me, I am a first-class killer, bringing death.*

*Fire of tempering long ignited, shoulder to shoulder with me, you will never be alone,*
*First to charge, last to leave, warriors go with no return I know.*

*Devouring fear, when enemies enter sight,*
*Aim with hand, pull trigger with will, kill with cold heart.*

*I am a ghost advancing,*
*I am a warrior singing.*

*Loving war and fighting, turning enemy country to scorched earth,*
*Wading through seas of blood, swearing to exterminate all.*

The lyrics sometimes weren't quite in rhythm, but hundreds of sturdy men opening their throats to sing in unison, accompanied by their heavy footsteps, set the very air vibrating.

Shi Zhiqi strode with his head held high at the front of 2nd Company. The First Expeditionary Force flag fluttered behind him. His personal Senator flag banner paraded alongside, embroidered not only with his family crest but also medals he had been awarded and the locations where he had commanded Marines to victory.

"What are these Kun singing?" Zheng Zhilong heard the singing carried vaguely by wind from afar and asked.

"Reporting to General, I can't hear clearly. Nothing more than some battle songs. Very vulgar."

Zheng Zhilong picked up his binoculars and looked again toward where the singing came from. Three columns of blue-clad soldiers were advancing on the beach toward his position. Flags were few, soldiers' ranks strictly orderly, steps uniform—obviously an elite army.

But looking at the scale of the troops, at most five hundred men. No dust clouds of large troop movements were visible behind them, nor large herds of oxen and horses in their rear train—obviously not towing heavy artillery. Zheng Zhilong felt slightly relieved: if only five hundred had come, his forces could still fight them.

Kun came from afar; how many troops could they transport? Just eat this group first; follow-up troops would just be adding oil. Eat one group as they came. Zheng Zhilong's confidence surged. He laughed: "It's true Hair Rebel ships are sturdy and their guns sharp, but pity they don't know the art of war. Daring to attack with so few men—isn't it just sending themselves to death for nothing?"

The commanders also felt these Kun were too arrogant, and felt slightly relieved. The younger ones with hotter blood, initially stunned by Hair Rebel cannon fire, now recovered their wits. Feeling the enemy's land forces were few and carried no cannons, they rubbed their palms one by one, preparing to give the Kun a good lesson.

"General, this general is willing to be vanguard! Dampen their sharpness!" One person stepped forward from among the commanders; it was Lin Cha. Lin Cha was a great general under Zheng Zhilong, brave and skilled in battle. Zheng Zhilong had once requested merit for him from the Imperial Court.

"Your men are too few, and infantry. Fall back for now, don't be impatient!" Zheng Zhilong shook his head. The opponent was an all-firearm unit. Others might not understand, but he kept two all-firearm guard units himself and was very familiar with firearm lethality. Lin Cha had only three or four hundred men; they would be beaten to slag by Kun before having time to swing swords and spears.

"General, this general has a tactic that can fight the Kun," Lin Cha pressed, unwilling to give up.

"Speak."

"I previously talked with General Tō, discussing the fierceness of firearms—unrivaled. Even brave generals in heavy armor can hardly escape death once hit by iron guns. Fighting against musketeers, one can only advance bravely, fighting with flesh and blood bodies. But General Tō said that in Japan, there is an implement that can overcome iron guns."

General Tō was Tōtarō—he wasn't willing to say his surname; the Chinese naturally took Tō as his surname.

"Go on." Zheng Zhilong became interested.

"Yes!" Lin Cha said hurriedly. "I heard from General Tō that this object is called a Bamboo Bundle Shield. By bundling multiple short green bamboos into a bundle, iron gun bullets cannot penetrate..."

Zheng Zhilong thought for a moment, then shook his head: "This bamboo bundled together would be big and heavy—it cannot be held with one hand. How would soldiers hold weapons to fight?"

"We can divide into three teams. One team holding Bamboo Bundle Shields in front to block bullets. One team behind, all using bows and arrows. The last team, shield and sword hands. First release a volley of arrows, then the shield and sword hands leap forward while trampling bodies, breaking the enemy with broadsword and rattan shield!" Lin Cha had come prepared; he had studied this problem long ago and trained his subordinates on site.

Zheng Zhilong turned his gaze to Tōtarō: "Is it really feasible?"

"Reporting to my Lord, the Bamboo Bundle Shield is indeed feasible. Iron guns cannot shoot through," Tōtarō confirmed. In Japan, whenever attacking castles, many vanguard soldiers carried this kind of Bamboo Bundle Shield to resist iron gun bullets.

Zheng Zhilong was moved: "But in such haste, where would we find these bamboos? And organizing teams to coordinate drill is not a matter of one morning or evening."

"Reporting to General, this humble officer has already prepared one thousand Bamboo Bundle Shields. My subordinate soldiers have also practiced the formation. I only request that the General let me fight!"

"Good!" Zheng Zhilong nodded. "Rare that you have the heart! Since so, you will lead the vanguard!" Saying this, he shouted: "Bring wine! I drink to send General Lin off!"

After drinking the send-off wine, Zheng Zhilong ordered his men to reward Lin Cha's subordinates five silver dollars each as encouragement for the vanguard. Lin Cha took his men to reorganize troops; his subordinates numbered only four hundred. Zheng Zhilong, fearing insufficient strength, ordered a subordinate general named Lin Sheng to take his own three hundred men to coordinate in battle.

Shi Zhiqi was leading troops forward when scouts ahead returned to report that a team of seven or eight hundred men had come out to meet them.

"1st Company, 2nd Company deploy into double column line! 3rd Company as reserve!"

Marine companies no longer had drummers and fifers, only buglers. Following Shi Zhiqi's command, the bugler's horn sounded. 1st and 2nd Companies deployed while marching, spreading into a double column line—1st Company on the left, 2nd Company on the right.

"Halt! Dress ranks!"

Shi Zhiqi led the direct-controlled squad at the junction of the two companies. Behind him were the cannons already beginning to unlimber and the 3rd Company acting as reserve.

In terms of Marine weapons, they could totally have adopted skirmish line combat mode. But the changeover time had been short; corresponding tactical training hadn't kept up. Thus they continued using line infantry tactics. Shi Zhiqi felt that against enemies of this era, line infantry tactics worked well enough—they could fully unleash firepower.

Shi Zhiqi raised his binoculars to look and felt strangely puzzled. These seven or eight hundred men—every one in the front rank held up a gigantic firewood bundle? On second thought, he understood: these were meant to block bullets.

"Damn, this is too funny," Shi Zhiqi muttered, putting down his binoculars. He drew his command saber:

"All units, prepare for battle!"

Bugles blew rapidly.
