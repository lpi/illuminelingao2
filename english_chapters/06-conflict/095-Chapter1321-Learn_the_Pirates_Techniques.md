# Chapter 1321 - "Learn the Pirate's Techniques to Defeat the Pirates"

Ultimately, Old Squire Huang agreed to his second son's proposal and sent Huang Bingkun's personal servant and study companion Huang Ping to attend Fangcao Di. Huang Ping was a distant relative of the Huang family who had followed Huang Bingkun since childhood—a reliable person.

In the first few months after Huang Ping began attending Fangcao Di, every two weeks—the interval the Australians called "two weeks"—Huang Ping would return to the Huang Family Stockade to rest for a day. Upon returning, he would report to Young Master Huang everything he had seen and heard at the school, and would hand over textbooks and supplementary materials to Huang Bingkun. Huang Bingkun immediately arranged for people to copy them in shifts.

Each time he returned, Huang Ping was like a happy little bird, chirping away endlessly. Wherever Huang Bingkun happened to be, he would rush back to hear Huang Ping talk about his experiences at Fangcao Di the moment the servant returned.

Huang Bingkun always listened very attentively to the servant. This once taciturn youth had gradually become talkative since going to Fangcao Di, returning each time with endless topics to share: his course content, the school environment, his classmates and teachers.

After Huang Ping finally finished speaking, Huang Bingkun would always praise him a few times and remind him not to forget "the words of the sages" and absolutely not to "let the pirates bewitch his mind." Huang Ping would always assent repeatedly, then go to reunite with his parents.

Huang Ping's parents farmed land in the Huang Family Stockade. Since their son had started school, each time they encountered Young Master Huang, their faces always bore simple smiles as they thanked him profusely for "the young master's great kindness." This made Huang Bingkun feel quite pleased—he was both gathering intelligence on the pirates' secrets and winning people's hearts.

Huang Bingkun spent a great deal of time studying the copied textbooks and supplementary materials, hoping to find the secret methods for making cannons, muskets, and great iron ships. Unfortunately, though the pirates' textbooks used Chinese characters, the mathematics and natural science courses extensively employed letters to represent things, so Young Master Huang couldn't understand them either. Moreover, although Huang Ping had been fourteen when he enrolled, he could only start from the first grade of the Junior Elementary Department. The three courses of Fangcao Di's Junior Elementary first grade—mathematics, language, and natural science—none of them touched on the "techniques" that Huang Bingkun most wanted to know about.

As for mathematics, while he hadn't systematically studied it, he had some familiarity with traditional arithmetic like "chickens and rabbits in a cage" problems and abacus calculation. After studying it for a while, though there were many incomprehensible symbols and numbers, at least the word problems and mathematical theorems were written in Chinese, so he could roughly understand about seventy or eighty percent.

The mathematical theorems were, for Huang Bingkun, the type where he understood every character individually but couldn't comprehend their meaning when connected together. The word problems, however, he mostly understood: they were all topics used in daily life, from measuring fields and calculating yields to digging ponds and building houses to trade and commerce—all very practical.

Learning this would indeed be a useful skill, Huang Bingkun thought. When Huang Ping returned in the future, he could be put to some use, perhaps as a steward or something.

Useful as it was, Huang Bingkun couldn't solve a single problem. He stared blankly at the problems in the mathematics book for half a day. He wanted to ask Huang Ping for guidance but couldn't bring himself to lose face that way. After thinking about it, since this field-measuring and commerce stuff had nothing to do with how the pirates made firearms and cannons, not understanding it didn't matter.

So he picked up the natural science book instead. Huang Ping had said this course was the study of investigating things—essentially teaching the principles of transformations of all things between heaven and earth. It was actually elementary physics, chemistry, and biology, illustrated with pictures and text. Huang Bingkun read several pages and found it quite interesting. One chapter in particular was specifically about buoyancy, using ships as examples: Why could ships float on water? Huang Bingkun immediately perked up and read carefully.

When he read: "...The buoyant force acting on an object in water equals the weight of water displaced by the object. The larger the ship and the deeper it sits in the water, the greater the weight of water it displaces, and thus the greater the buoyant force it receives—naturally meaning it can carry more cargo." He couldn't help muttering, "Complete nonsense!"

In Huang Bingkun's view, ships could float on water because they were made of wood. Wood could float on water, so ships could also float on water.

However, the Australians' iron ships had severely shaken this conviction, so when he said "complete nonsense," there wasn't much conviction behind it. He had a feeling that even though he didn't fully understand, the Australians were making sense. As for the transformation between the three states of matter, which he basically understood, the examples given—water turning to ice, water turning to steam—were things he often saw.

He flipped back and forth through the natural science book for a long time, almost unable to put it down—although he had someone copy the book, the diagrams couldn't be reproduced. He heard from Huang Ping that this book was also sold at bookstores in East Gate Market, which gave him the notion to go buy a few copies himself.

He flipped through the language textbook. Apart from the pinyin letters that he neither approved of nor understood, he wasn't particularly opposed to the content. The first-grade textbook focused on character recognition, with simple sentences and short passages. The sentences were all in Australian vernacular. They were interspersed with simple principles, mostly things the Australians repeatedly advocated—such as maintaining hygiene, being polite, and so on—nothing more than material for educating the masses. Though the language was crude, the intentions were proper.

Having obtained three textbooks and heard many anecdotes about Fangcao Di from Huang Ping, Huang Bingkun felt he had gained considerably. He became even more convinced that this move of his was brilliant. He decided to use the materials Huang Ping collected plus his own daily observations to write a *Record of Essential Information on the Pirates*. Someday when the opportunity arose, he would present it to the imperial court.

But things gradually began to change. The introduction of public ox-carts in Lingao, while providing convenience, also shortened travel times within the county. From Fangcao Di to the Huang Family Stockade, the journey used to require setting out at dawn and not arriving until dusk. With ox-carts, leaving in the early morning meant arriving at the Huang Family Stockade in time for lunch. Yet Huang Ping's visits home became less and less frequent—from every half month to every twenty days, then once a month. After advancing to Junior Elementary second grade, aside from coming home for festivals, he would simply send a letter to report he was safe and stopped coming back entirely.

Although he couldn't understand the content of the pirates' textbooks himself, what made Huang Bingkun even more uneasy was that Huang Ping—who came from the Huang Family Stockade, his former servant—seemed to be gradually slipping from his control.

As for Huang Bingkun's proposal to visit Fangcao Di and have a look, Jasmine Pavilion's headmaster Liu Dalin had always been noncommittal. Ever since the Australians had cured his illness and provided over a year of rehabilitation, not only had his overall health improved greatly, but he could gradually walk without his wheelchair, able to move slowly with a cane and someone's support.

By rights, this was cause for celebration. After all, Liu Dalin wasn't yet forty—still in the prime of life. In the past, chronic illness had prevented him from accomplishing much; many times he could only lend his name to projects without actual involvement. Now that his health had improved, it was time for great achievements. Many local gentry and scholars therefore invited him to serve at the County Consultative Bureau and "serve his hometown"—the Australians had always shown respect to this Successful Candidate Liu, and if he could represent everyone on many matters, it would benefit all.

However, Liu the Successful Candidate seemed like a changed person. He spoke less, and declined the invitation to join the County Consultative Bureau. Every day he would only go to Jasmine Pavilion to lecture; once lectures ended, he would go straight home, refusing all visitors. It was said he read very little. He seemed to be weighed down with worries.

The students at Jasmine Pavilion were also dwindling by the day. The grand spectacle when it had been renovated and reopened, with student scholars from all over the county flocking to enroll, was already gone. Aside from a few people, most of the student scholars had figured things out: rather than struggling here studying hard, receiving only a few dozen yuan in monthly stipend barely enough to support themselves, with their ability to read and write they could find work with the Australians. Even becoming a tutor at a Purification Camp to teach refugees the *Thousand Character Classic* and *Hundred Family Surnames* would be no problem for supporting a family. As for passing the examination to become a licentiate—what use was becoming a licentiate in Lingao? The Australians had instituted universal taxation, so the licentiate's benefit of exemption from two *shi* of grain tax was long gone. Meeting officials without kneeling, not being beaten with planks—these held no meaning with the Australians. No one had to kneel when meeting Australians, and the Australians didn't go around beating people's backsides at every turn like court officials did.

Moreover, civil examinations had never flourished in Lingao. Apart from licentiates, which had a fixed quota per county and thus offered some hope, Recommended Men and Metropolitan Graduates were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. From when the county was established in the Tang Dynasty through the Ming, only Liu Dalin had passed the metropolitan examination; there were only about a dozen Recommended Men. Those who did become licentiates had little prospect of becoming Recommended Men, let alone student scholars who weren't even licentiates yet.
