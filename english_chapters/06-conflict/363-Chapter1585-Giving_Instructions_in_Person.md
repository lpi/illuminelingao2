# Chapter 1585 - Giving Instructions in Person

"Then how do you intend to handle this?"

"The specific plan will be communicated to all Senators once it's finalized. For now, you may inform the Senators involved of this news," Wu Mu said over the phone. "Tonight. We'll invite you to a meeting as well."

"Understood." Though Wu Ciren remained unsatisfied with this vague response, Wu Mu had already hung up. Further questions would yield nothing. Better to simply wait for the evening meeting.

Returning to the rehearsal hall, Wu Ciren—his expression grave—called Yuan Ziguang, Dongmen Chuiyu, and the others to a corner for a "small meeting." Fortunately, most members were clustered around Liu Shuixin and failed to notice the tense atmosphere. Only the two young Senators, Zhang Yunmi and Lin Ziqi, cast surprised glances. Dongmen Chuiyu shook his head to signal "everything's fine."

"The situation I just heard from Wu Mu's phone call is as follows. What do you think?" Wu Ciren relayed the news and solicited opinions from his fellow enthusiasts.

"This... this is too... I mean... Even if Zuo Yami really went to watch a rehearsal with someone, that doesn't prove anything, does it? She's a reliable element the Senate has cultivated for years! Unless... unless..." Yuan Ziguang, the old educator, clearly could not fathom that "enemy agents" would ever intersect with idol group activities. He stammered, nearly incoherent.

*If Zuo Yami truly has problems, the Education Department will be disgraced.* He thought. *At least she came from the Maid Training Class!*

How could Dongmen Chuiyu know the turmoil in Yuan's stomach? He said: "I don't think we need to be overly anxious. Various forces infiltrating Lingao has been going on for ages. Grassroots police officers can't be expected to identify everyone. It's enough for us few to know this information. If Little Zhang and Teacher Liu hear about it, their mood will certainly suffer, and program quality will be affected. Better not to tell them. As for the rest—we have the army, the police, the Political Security Bureau. Are we really afraid they can't secure the venue?"

"That all makes sense, but this is our essence saved up over years. Lose even one, and I can't afford it!" Yuan Ziguang was agitated enough to jump. Several Senators had reserved positions in this idol group. If one actually died, he—the Education Department's direct person in charge—would be verbally crucified a hundred times over. Suddenly he understood why Xiao Zishan had wanted to restructure the Maid Training Class. *That damn thing was shedding a burden!*

"I don't think we need to worry prematurely. Everything will become clear after tonight's meeting. As a precaution, I'll arrange a car to take Teacher Liu and Little Zhang home later. As for Zuo Yami—she belongs to the Household Registration Section. It's really not my place to intervene. Let's wait for the Political Security Bureau to reach a conclusion." Wu Ciren made the final call.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Before Lin Ziqi could rise to answer, it swung open. Guards entered, followed by the food delivery team from the Commercial Officer Restaurant, filing in with stacked food boxes.

Dongmen Chuiyu clapped his hands and called out: "Dinner time! Everyone line up to get your meals!"

The gentlemen of the Checkered Skirt Club had always been generous with their dream idol group, ordering the highest-grade "bento." The imported Japanese lacquer boxes alone were worth a small fortune. Opening one revealed colorful dishes arranged with exquisite precision—fully modeled on the high-end Japanese bento style of later generations. Not only were there delicacies from land and sea, but pickles and fruits as well.

The girls, accustomed to cafeteria fare, had never seen such luxurious "bentos." They collected them one by one and went to eat. Without discussion, Zhang Yunmi naturally took the lead; Lin Aili and Zuo Yami followed in standing-position order. Apart from a few chairs in the rehearsal hall, there was no additional seating. The girls consciously left the chairs for the Senators and sat on the floor to eat.

Dongmen and the others naturally would not compete with the girls for seats. Three chairs were left for Liu Shuixin, Zhang Yunmi, and Lin Ziqi.

"Damn, the gap already exists, huh." Zhang Berlin muttered while wolfing down his bento.

"Without a gap, there's no motivation." Dongmen Chuiyu replied. "At least we haven't prepared the small cucumber set meal yet."

"What is your assessment?" Zhao Manxiong's gentle, steady voice came through the phone.

Wu Mu suppressed the excitement of cracking a major case: "Continue monitoring. Once we have more leads, we catch them all in one net." He added: "The investigators share this view."

"I think you need to proceed with caution on this matter." Zhao Manxiong coughed lightly. "If even one Senator is attacked by the enemy—regardless of whether actual harm is caused—your position as Director will become precarious. Yang Cao and the others can be dealt with: I can transfer them elsewhere and promote them later. But if you fall, returning to this position will be very difficult..."

"I'm psychologically prepared." Wu Mu said. "Hidden dangers must be thoroughly eliminated. I don't concern myself with personal gains and losses."

"Then I agree with your plan." Zhao Manxiong said. "Have you notified the relevant Senators about the briefing meeting?"

"Tonight." Wu Mu said. "To be frank, I question whether this is appropriate. Shouldn't such matters be kept absolutely confidential?"

"You cannot view this matter purely through a professional lens. You must have political awareness." Zhao Manxiong spoke unhurriedly. "In political security work, the first requirement is maintaining correct political views..."

"I understand your meaning." Wu Mu said.

"Close the net in a timely manner. Don't let the fish drag you in..."

Wu Mu set down the phone. It was already seven in the evening. The office was silent. He opened the curtains, gazed at the lights of East Gate Market, drew a deep breath, and after a moment picked up the phone again: "Have Yang Cao, Liu Fuqing, and Ke Yun come to my office."

After dinner, the Checkered Skirt Club members continued rehearsing late into the night. Only when Liu Shuixin nodded to indicate the quality was essentially acceptable did she dismiss them.

Lin Ziqi was young and had grown excessively sleepy. She fell asleep in the carriage on the way home. In the end, Zhang Yunmi helped her into the house and stayed overnight at her best friend's home.

Meanwhile, a meeting was underway in the Political Security Bureau building in Bairen City: the "Project Sun Umbrella" Cross-Department Coordination Briefing.

The venue was a small, closed conference room. Several Senators sat around a round table. Wu Mu presided personally. Behind him sat a confidential secretary serving as stenographer.

Because this was a briefing, besides work-related Senators—Li Yayang, Commander of the Lingao Garrison, and Mu Min, Director of General Affairs for the National Police—several Senators directly connected to the matter also attended: Dongmen Chuiyu, Wu Ciren, Yuan Ziguang, Zhang Berlin... Even Dongfang Ke and Nan Gonghao, who typically lived as recluses and loved sleeping in, had been summoned.

After briefing everyone on the relevant situation and reiterating that the meeting's contents must remain confidential, Wu Mu invited the attendees to share their views and suggestions.

Dongfang Ke spoke first. He reiterated his earlier observations and emphasized at the conclusion: he hoped both the Garrison Battalion and the Political Security Bureau would strengthen security forces to protect Art Troupe performances, especially the Senators who lacked the ability to protect themselves.

Li Yayang said: "The Executive Committee has approved your previous request regarding enhanced Cultural Festival security. However—pardon my bluntness—Comrade Dongfang should not place excessive hope in our Garrison Battalion. Garrison soldiers function primarily as a deterrent. Potential enemies will be scared away from heavily guarded targets, but they won't leave—they'll simply look for places with relatively weaker defenses to carry out sabotage. Therefore, I believe Director Wu should bring the Political Security Bureau's full capabilities to bear: prevent trouble before it starts, and root out the Senate's enemies in advance. Only then can the safe and smooth conduct of Cultural Festival activities be guaranteed."

Wu Mu answered: "Yes, we have conducted relevant work. Particularly regarding the situation Comrade Dongfang reported, we have implemented targeted control measures. We will strengthen security at key areas over the coming days. During your Folk Orchestra and Checkered Skirt Club's movements to and from performance and rehearsal venues, I will assign staff to escort you. I hope the responsible Senators will cooperate."

Wu Ciren interjected: "We'll cooperate, of course. After receiving notification last night, I immediately organized our club's Senator comrades to discuss. But we unanimously agreed that we cannot treat our member Zuo Yami as a suspect for now. After all, she's had no opportunity to engage in conspiracy or sabotage!"

Dongfang Ke complained, his face stony: "Indeed—associating with martial artists of unknown origin certainly poses no instability risk whatsoever!"

Wu Ciren was struck speechless. Wu Mu smoothed things over: "Very well—we have conducted a detailed investigation regarding Zuo Yami's situation, and relevant leads are being followed up. I won't say more here. By the way, Dongfang—will there be a dress rehearsal before the official performance?"

"Yes, the day before. All performing units, including the Fangcaodi Drama Club, must enter the venue and run through the entire performance. Will you clear the venue?"

"No—we will conduct more efficient work. By the way, the General Office has dispatched additional official carriages and guards in response to the recent security situation. You should stop riding your bicycle alone. Pay attention to safety—travel by carriage and don't leave the sight of your escort."

Dongfang Ke nodded noncommittally.

"Regarding security work, everyone needn't worry excessively." Mu Min said. "Our Detective Team of General Affairs Section Ten has been fully mobilized, implementing man-to-man coverage of exposed suspicious elements. They're all professionals with considerable experience. Additionally, personnel from Section Nine of General Affairs will join the operation. Furthermore, we're mobilizing plainclothes police from the Public Security Division. Ran Yao has also submitted a request to the General Staff for assistance. More Public Security Army personnel will be transferred to serve as guards, which will release more Garrison Battalion forces for more important personal protection duties."

The meeting lasted until midnight. After Wu Mu adjourned the session, he remained busy—immediately summoning Yang Cao to his office for a lengthy, detailed personal briefing.
