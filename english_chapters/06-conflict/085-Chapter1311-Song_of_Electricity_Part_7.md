# Chapter 1311 - Song of Electricity (Part 7)

"It wasn't until 1844 that the first industrial DC generator appeared—specifically designed for electroplating. Not until 1873 were generators and motors connected in series. Before that, generators produced electricity stored in batteries, which then powered motors. As for the excitation method changing from permanent magnets to self-excitation by electric current—that was a 1867 paper by Siemens. And the modern armature—the drum type—was designed by Alteneck of Siemens in 1872. Compensating windings and laminated iron cores for motors didn't appear until 1885. And the universal three-phase synchronous generation mode only appeared in 1887."

Faraday's "multimedia" presentation sparked everyone's interest. While the assembled had varying degrees of fragmentary knowledge on these topics, few understood them so comprehensively.

"The reason I'm saying all this is that we absolutely don't need to follow the original technology tree step by step again. For instance, the motor we successfully trial-produced was manufactured according to blueprints we brought—specifically, the Y-series three-phase squirrel-cage asynchronous motor from the old-timeline national standards. This motor series can basically meet most of our workshops' current prime mover requirements—after all, a 10-ton electric crane only needs a 15 kW motor."

He then discussed the types, functions, and principles of power equipment, followed by a general explanation of transmission and distribution principles—presented in an accessible manner. The transmigrators present all worked in science and technology and could understand without needing too many details.

"...To get back to the point, there's a misconception that everything electrical should be managed by the Power sector. But actually, the power industry, as the name implies, is like the machinery industry: the machinery industry manufactures machinery; the power industry produces power. That is, power stations are ours, but manufacturing generators isn't. In fact, generator manufacturing is a subcategory of the machinery industry. I'll digress here—our mechanical sector has a tendency to wallow in crude, steampunk culture. We've got over a hundred transmigrators in those village-level machinery shops using themselves as fitters day after day. What the hell is that about? I think on mature production lines we have to liberate the transmigrators and deploy them where transmigrators are actually needed. When we were trying to build an electric motor, we couldn't get heaven or earth to respond. When we wanted to find a machinery transmigrator to help, they all rolled their eyes at us. I'm not doing this to build my own empire—I'm doing this for everyone's future and tomorrow..."

"Ahem ahem ahem." Qian Liushi sensed things were going sideways and quickly coughed a warning. Faraday glared at Qian Liushi. "Fine, say any more and feelings will get hurt. The Executive Committee and Planning Commission have approved establishing a project team for power equipment production and development, temporarily led by me and Qian Liushi. I hope colleagues with more professional mechanical expertise will join this project team and help us make our power equipment bigger and better, so we can enter the age of electrification as soon as possible."

"Alright, let's pause Faraday's introduction there. I'll continue the discussion." Qian Liushi was afraid Faraday would put his foot in his mouth again with a few more words, so he quickly cut in. "Actually, the Planning Commission has long wanted to switch the prime movers in our factories from steam engines to electric motors. But because silicon steel and various insulation and sealing materials have been delayed for so long, these plans have remained purely verbal."

"Now let's do it this way: first look at demand, then see what we can provide. The current projects requiring electricity are as follows—please add anything I've missed. The most important work currently is satisfying the mandatory electrical projects of industrial enterprises: electrolysis and electroplating. Electrolysis in particular has high power consumption and significantly impacts the non-ferrous metals and chemical industries. We'll start by addressing this area of demand."

After this primer, the meeting more or less got on track. After discussion, the transmigrators from the industrial sector formulated a rough plan for power equipment manufacturing and the direction of power development.

First, produce silicon steel. At the steel plant's current level, they could only manufacture hot-rolled silicon steel sheets. Then through continuous testing of the hysteresis curves of various grades of silicon steel, they would sort out approximate grades for use in motors and transformers.

With a stable and reliable silicon steel supply, the next step was to build a specialized motor workshop. Besides producing Y-series motors, they could mass-produce low-speed air-cooled permanent magnet generators under 100 KW—these wouldn't need brushes. These generators could be driven by steam engines, or by diesel engines if available in the future, or even by water turbines at small hydroelectric stations. Terminal voltage would be 400 V. For this low-voltage class of motors, mica sheets and mica paper were more than adequate for insulation. This series of generators was relatively lightweight and could be used at combat logistics centers, command posts, or construction sites. The combination of generators and motors would greatly improve efficiency over steam engines—provided Lingao's industrial system could supply diesel engines and the required fuel at scale. Otherwise, using gas power would discount the advantages.

As for transmission and distribution, the consensus among transmigrators from the mechanical and chemical sectors was that there were too many technical hurdles to overcome and too many missing links in the industrial chain. Currently, aside from barely being able to domestically produce various makeshift wires and cables, transformers, circuit breakers, and so forth were all difficult to manufacture. As for secondary electrical equipment like ammeters and voltmeters—those posed difficulties that couldn't be overcome in the short term. Therefore, they recommended mainly expanding capacity through self-supply power stations. These self-contained power plants would be installed at chemical and smelting enterprises requiring large amounts of electricity, using steam engines to drive batches of low-speed air-cooled permanent magnet generators for on-site power generation and consumption.

The Power Work Conference "came to a victorious close." After the meeting, Chang Kaishen hosted a banquet at the Farm Teahouse for Liu Tangmu, Faraday, Qian Liushi, and other "backbone technical personnel," toasting their "hard work and perseverance." He also invited Zhong Lishi. Over these years, Faraday and the others had been able to achieve some results in no small part due to the quiet support of Dr. Zhong as People's Committee Member for Science and Technology. Otherwise, Faraday would probably have long since jumped ship to the steel plant to work in materials science.

Dr. Zhong rarely attended social gatherings among transmigrators, but he readily accepted this invitation. Minister Chang knew that Dr. Zhong generally wouldn't refuse any occasion with fine cuisine, so he generously spent his circulation vouchers to prepare quite a few "premium" dishes typically served to guests.

Though the teahouse catered to transmigrators, the chefs weren't red-case master chefs. Wu Nanhai had no intention of making the teahouse function as a restaurant, so the naturalized cooks trained there specialized in pastries, desserts, and light meals. When actual banquets were required, master chefs were brought in from the Commercial House Restaurant to do the cooking.

The master chefs at the Commercial House Restaurant had all been personally trained by several transmigrator "foodies" who knew how to eat well and cook. Among their specialties, the Nanbao roast duck recipe had been taught by Zhong Lishi himself. They were skilled at preparing various dishes that quite suited transmigrator palates.

The banquet was set by the waterside window in the teahouse's annex building. Lingao's low latitude meant that by not yet March, the weather was already warm with flowers blooming. The tall windows stood open as a warm breeze gently wafted through.

The table was laden with dishes featuring local Lingao characteristics: four hot dishes—braised spicy sea snail eyeballs, steamed crab with roe, stir-fried sipunculid worms, and pork belly with dried radish; two main courses—salt-and-pepper pig's trotters and roast Nanbao duck; vegetables were garlic-sautéed Duowen water spinach and scallion-braised baby taro; accompanied by two pastries—oil-fried shrimp and chive cakes and Lingao fried sesame balls.

The drinks were rice beer and Leizhou rum made by the Farm Cooperative, naturally accompanied by kvass, that "national beverage."

This banquet was considered "luxurious" even in 1633, when transmigrator living standards had improved substantially. Especially the pig's trotters with their tender meat and slightly medicinal aroma, and the diced pork belly, made several attendees secretly swallow their saliva.

The host and guests raised and exchanged glasses, eating and drinking heartily. During the feast, Chang Kaishen toasted frequently, and soon everyone's faces were flushed.

Dr. Zhong, already somewhat tipsy, knew he shouldn't drink any more and steered the conversation to the topic of academic journals.

"Your work on the electric motor was excellent!" Zhong Lishi said. "Record all the experimental data from this project. Later, everyone should summarize their respective parts, compile them together, and publish in the Core."

What Dr. Zhong called "the Core" was the first academic journal of this timeline, *Nature and Science*, organized by the Science and Technology Department and published by the Grand Library. Dr. Zhong Lishi served as editor-in-chief, with the most professionally qualified people from the mechanical, metallurgical, chemical, and other departments, as well as specialists in electrical engineering, materials, precision instruments, and biology, serving as editors and reviewers. The journal basically covered the latest work achievements and production results of the industrial departments, with emphasis on transmigrators' exploration and practice of "replicating" and "recreating" modern industry under existing conditions.

The publication of *Nature and Science* had to some extent replaced the science and technology section of the old internal forum. That section had gradually fallen fallow as the First Five-Year Plan deepened, various departments' work became increasingly separate, and everyone was busy with work by day and "homework" by night.

Many transmigrators were familiar with core journals from before D-Day. Though writing papers was annoying, a positive compensation system—particularly the foreign maiden auctions that made everyone increasingly value circulation vouchers—had made submissions fairly enthusiastic. The magazine was published monthly and distributed free to every transmigrator. As a supplement to information, it enabled professionals across different fields to stay current on other departments' work and quickly apply the latest technological developments. Besides one copy per transmigrator, additional copies were printed for the Grand Library, schools, and various enterprise professional reference rooms for naturalized technical personnel to read. Therefore, submission guidelines explicitly stated that papers must not contain words like "old timeline" and absolutely must not mention old-timeline technology history.
