# Chapter 1242 - Operation Overlord

Since they were equipped with Hall rifles, it would inevitably affect tactical application. The Army had spent great effort establishing its current system: organization, logistics, and training were all centered around the Minié rifle. A large-scale switch to the Hall would entail significant risk.

By comparison, the Marines—small in scale, frequently executing small-unit combat missions, and focusing on skirmisher combat—were more suitable to serve as an experimental unit. Moreover, the Hall rifle's faster rate of fire was also well-suited to the Marines' tactical mode of skirmishing and precision shooting.

The two hit it off immediately. Shi Zhiqi's plan for new organization and new equipment was approved, using a small-scale experimental unit to test the equipment. Utilizing personnel from the original Hong Kong Detachment, a 1st Expeditionary Force consisting of only three companies was reorganized as the test unit.

In the command room of Zuooying Mission, a large-scale sand table model of Weitou Bay had been built. Including Anping, Xiamen Island, Gulangyu, and Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands.

There had been some debate on how to wage war against the Zhengs, but ultimately it was decided to adopt the strategy of "striking directly at the heart," using the main force to strike a heavy blow against Zheng Zhilong's lair at Anping Town. To sweep away the Zheng family's power in these places in one stroke. If possible, to take the opportunity to capture or kill the main leaders of the Zheng family, eradicating their power once and for all.

Years ago, the Qing army's surprise attack on Xiamen, though failing to destroy Zheng Chenggong's military power once and for all, plundered the grain and silver the Zheng family had accumulated over many years, severely hitting Zheng Chenggong's economic power and greatly sapping his vitality.

Now was the Zheng family's startup phase, far less wealthy than in Zheng Chenggong's era. If a powerful joint amphibious strike could plunder their savings and destroy their fleet, even failing to capture the main Zheng leaders would be enough to cripple Zheng Zhilong.

This plan was approved before summer, and troop movements were conducted accordingly. Based on integrated intelligence, the General Staff and Navy proposed late September as suitable for launching this offensive. By late September, the typhoon season would basically be over, the strait calm and suitable for troop transport. Secondly, Zheng family ships going to Japan all departed in June and generally returned around September. This would maximize the chance of catching the Zheng family's main Japan trade ships, dealing a heavy blow to their maritime power.

However, the Intelligence Bureau also reminded the General Staff and Navy that the recovery speed of Zheng Zhilong's maritime power was extremely fast. It took less than a year to build large trading ships quickly along the Fujian coast; a large sea vessel could be launched in at most seven or eight months. Although the quality was poor, sailing to Japan or the Nanyang was no problem. In the history of the old timeline, Zheng Zhilong suffered multiple defeats with heavy ship losses, but each time he was able to rebuild his fleet very quickly—this was related to Xiong Wencan's support and his strong roots in the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou regions.

Now Xiong Wencan had been transferred to Guangdong. The new governor Zou Weilian, though relying somewhat on Zheng Zhilong for coastal defense, trusted Zheng far less than Xiong Wencan did—Zheng Zhilong's power was growing, acting independently in many matters and not fully obeying the governor's dispatch. So the relationship between them was far less "harmonious" than in the Xiong Wencan era.

The Intelligence Bureau analyzed that to shake the Zheng family's prestige in the Zhang-Quan region and simultaneously make Governor Zou Weilian doubt Zheng's ability—many officials in Fujian had viewed appeasing Zheng Zhilong with helplessness, believing him "usable but not trustworthy"—making his strength difficult to recover in the short term, they must implement a heavy strike, thoroughly destroying Anping, Xiamen, Gulangyu, and Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands. Even better if the main leaders could be killed.

Finally, the General Staff formulated the operational plan: launch a joint Army-Navy landing operation on September 20. The First Fleet main force would break into Weitou Bay, destroying all ships anchored in the bay in one stroke, while the Marines and Army would land and occupy Anping, Xiamen Island, Gulangyu, and Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands.

After occupying these areas, they would conduct a comprehensive mop-up of the forts, stockades, and walled cities on the islands, destroying them one by one. Population, grain, and wealth would be entirely plundered, walled cities burned. Making Weitou Bay a "scorched earth," losing its foreign trade capability. Both the Grand Library and Intelligence Bureau believed it was difficult to completely eliminate the Zheng family in one campaign; they must destroy its economic and material foundation to the greatest extent, then coordinate with subsequent trade blockades and military strikes to finally eliminate the Zheng family.

In this plan, the Army and Navy would only conduct destruction operations against Anping, Xiamen Island, Gulangyu, and Greater and Lesser Kinmen regions, not occupy them. The General Staff considered that direct occupation of these areas would inevitably require large-scale dispersion of forces for garrison duty. Moreover, for Fujian officialdom, the occupation of Xiamen and Kinmen would equate to a direct threat to the Zhang-Quan region, inevitably causing a major backlash. Fujian officialdom would desperately support Zheng Zhilong's counterattack.

Conversely, if they only struck the Zheng family hard, the bureaucrats and gentry of Fujian, who already disliked the Zheng Zhilong family, might instead rise up against him together.

For trade, the Fujian coast wasn't an indispensable place: Colonial and Trade Department ships could depart from Shanghai, Guangzhou, or Kaohsiung to any trade location. From the perspective of acquiring Ming trade goods, Fujian's commodities were not irreplaceable either.

This plan was named "Overlord" by Dongmen Chuiyu with bad taste—once the campaign was achieved, the Senate would truly become the overlord of the entire East Asian seas.

The anticipated troop strength to be used was the entire First Fleet of the Navy, several squadrons of Coast Guard patrol boats transferred from Lingao, several naval fire support squadrons, the Marine Corps 1st Expeditionary Force and the Army's 1st Infantry Battalion in full, two artillery batteries, and one heavy artillery battery. Plus two Special Reconnaissance detachments.

In the command room of Zuooying Mission, Dongmen Chuiyu was pointing at the sand table with a baton, explaining the operation plan.

"The first objective of this offensive operation is Kinmen Island." Dongmen Chuiyu pointed at the sand table. "Kinmen Island is the throat of Xiamen, located right at the junction of Xiamen Bay and Weitou Bay. It is not only the key to Xiamen but also the screen for the Jiulong River estuary, playing a vital role in Zhangzhou's maritime security—for Zheng Zhilong specifically, Kinmen Island is also an important maritime screen for Anping. For Zheng Zhilong, once Kinmen is lost, Anping will be hard to preserve. So this is a strategic town he must defend."

Kinmen's land was barren with no surface runoff, a water-deficient area with a very harsh natural environment. It couldn't support a large population, but the Kinmen islands had many harbor ports, with over 30 piers capable of berthing ships—17 on Greater Kinmen and 6 on Lesser Kinmen. It was a good place to anchor ships, so Kinmen Island had always been one of the Zheng fleet's main anchorages. Zheng Chenggong's invasion of Taiwan also launched from here.

The second objective was Xiamen Island. Xiamen Island was 18 nautical miles from Kinmen Island, sitting east and west of Kinmen relative to Anping. If Anping was the Zheng family's lair, then Xiamen Island was the grand trading post for Zheng family business operations. Countless goods and wealth were stockpiled here for turnover. Later, the Zheng brothers built luxurious mansions on the island one after another, moving there. When Qing general Ma Degong successfully raided Xiamen, it was said he plundered 900,000 taels of silver and 100,000 shi of grain in one go. Considering Ma Degong fled before establishing a foothold and didn't conduct a thorough search, plus he inevitably pocketed a portion himself, probably even Zheng Zhilong wasn't clear on exactly how much the Zheng family had stockpiled on Xiamen Island.

"Now declaring the campaign schedule."

September 20th is D-Day. D-3, the fleet sets sail, assembling at Penghu, establishing a forward base on Magong Island (Penghu). Stockpiling food and water. D-2, Special Reconnaissance Teams first land on Anping, Greater Kinmen, and Xiamen Island, establishing guidance points on predetermined beaches. D-1 early morning, set sail for Kinmen Island.

Kinmen Island is about 80 nautical miles from Penghu. Steam ships at 8 knots would take about ten hours. To accommodate the majority of sailing ships, the fleet's average speed could only be maintained at 3-4 knots; the entire crossing would take over 25 hours. So departure is set for 4:00 AM. This way the fleet will arrive on the morning of D-Day, breaking into Liaoluo Bay on the rising tide.

"According to reports from Special Recon teams and reconnaissance ships, part of Zheng Zhilong's fleet is anchored in Liaoluo Bay, part at Gulangyu. There are also some anchored at Anping." Dongmen Chuiyu pointed to the ship models on the sand table.

Anchored in Liaoluo Bay was the Zheng "fleet," with larger ships, including several European-type vessels, mostly equipped with Red Barbarian Cannons allocated by Xiong Wencan from Guangdong. Although Liaoluo Bay faced the open sea with larger waves, the beach was steep and waters deep with sandy bottom, an ideal anchorage for large deep-draft vessels. It was also convenient for intercepting enemy fleets attempting to attack Xiamen Bay and Weitou Bay.

At Anping and Gulangyu, ordinary trading ships predominated, though a significant portion of these ships were also armed. Especially near Gulangyu, Zheng Zhilong also had a portion of fire ships—obviously, the enemy knew fire ships could only be most effective in narrow waters.

According to the plan, the fleet would first attack all ships anchored in Liaoluo Bay, then concentrate fire to bombard Kinmen, destroying Kinmen Island's defenses. Marines would land to execute attack-occupy-destroy operations.

The Zheng family had several forts and stockades on Kinmen Island, guarded by several thousand men. Multiple artillery batteries were also established. But compared to the Humen-Pearl River defenses the Navy breached back then, Kinmen Island's defenses were far inferior. The Zheng family's defense of Kinmen still relied basically on the maritime fleet rather than land batteries.

After occupying Greater and Lesser Kinmen, command posts and transfer stations would be deployed on Kinmen Island. Attacks would be launched against Xiamen Island and Anping respectively. The plan involved carrying large numbers of Daihatsu, Chuhatsu, and Shohatsu landing craft to ferry landing troops within the bay, overcoming the disadvantage that the First Fleet had many large, deep-draft ships unsuited for landing operations.
