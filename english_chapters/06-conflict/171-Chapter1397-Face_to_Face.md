# Chapter 1397 - Face to Face

Jia Le stood at the door of the rear wing room, taking a few deep breaths to calm her pounding heart. She remembered Hao Yuan telling her that Xihua's attitude would likely be very complex, and she might even know she was sent to persuade her.

"Don't be afraid at any time. Remember what I told you: Whatever she asks, you just say it."

Can this really work? Jia Le doubted secretly. However, she completely trusted "Uncle Hao." Once slightly calmer, she lifted the door curtain and said loudly:

"Servant Jia Le is here."

"Come in."

"Yes." She quickly lifted the curtain and walked in.

The rear wing room wasn't big, and the furnishings were simple. Xihua was sitting on a Kang bed, holding an account book in her hand. The Kang table was piled with various books and registers.

"Sit down." Xihua's hair was wet, seemingly just bathed, but her clothes were the same as during the day, not a single thread out of place.

"This servant dares not." Jia Le said carefully.

"Oh." Xihua lifted her eyelids, sweeping over Jia Le's whole body, making her shudder involuntarily.

Although young, she had always been Zhao Yingong's "side user." From the establishment of the villa until now, she had been a "housekeeper" level personnel, holding the power of reward and punishment. Moreover, she was meticulous in her conduct, naturally developing an imposing manner. Even servant women decades older than her would feel weak in the knees when swept by her glance.

Xihua put down the account book, picked up the covered bowl, and sipped the tea lightly: "where are you from?"

"This servant is a local, home is in Nanxiawa. Not far from here." Jia Le said carefully.

"What does your family do?"

"Selling dim sum."

"How are you literate? Did you study?"

Jia Le became extra careful: "Which rank of person is this servant, how dare say studied. Neighbors have children attending private school, this servant learned haphazardly following them."

"Are there children studying in such a place as Nanxiawa? You take me for an outsider?" Xihua sneered, "Which private school did they attend? Who is the teacher? How much is the tuition every year?"

These questions came one after another, all merciless refutations: Nanxiawa, that place, was a dwelling place for the poorest common people in Hangzhou. It was impossible to have a private school—children in Nanxiawa never studied. People struggling on the starvation line every moment couldn't possibly have such thoughts.

"Replying to Sister, there is a scholar living in Nanxiawa now, who opened a charity school himself, teaching children to read, asking for no tuition. This servant dares not lie about this matter."

"There is still such a righteous person in this world?!" Xihua sneered.

"Replying to Sister, Sister also suffered hardship and disaster back then, saved by Master Zhao to escape difficulty. Why can't this gentleman be a righteous person? Could it be only rich and powerful people can be righteous people?"

Xihua was startled. In the villa, except for Zhao Yingong, no one spoke so "bluntly" in front of her. Even Fenghua, who was "under one person," spoke politely to her. Moreover, these words were tight and seamless, without loopholes, actually hard to refute.

She put down the tea cup, silently sized up Jia Le a few times, said: "You are indeed sharp-tongued."

"Dare not." Jia Le stepped back, blessed a blessing, "Ask Sister to forgive sin."

"So what if you are eloquent." Xihua said faintly, "Don't think I don't know who Wang Rong'er is. She is a traitor living off one while helping another. Soft-boned stuff, a few whips will make her say everything..."

Jia Le felt afraid in her heart. Although Hao Yuan had told her: Her identity was likely known to the other party long ago, being exposed face to face like this was still like a thunder strike, almost making her unable to stand firm.

Gangs frequently fought and killed people in secret near Nanxiawa. Catching a traitor, beating half dead, putting in a sack and throwing directly into the river. Jia Le heard this more than once.

Although this Master Zhao wasn't a city fox or society rat, with his power, secretly killing such a little girl like her was really easier than crushing an ant.

"You'd better tell honestly, who asked you to come, asked you to do what." Xihua said slowly, "Here everything is negotiable. As long as you speak honestly, guarantee you safe and sound. If dishonest, I hand you over to Steward Office, boards and finger squeezers are not something a child like you can bear."

These words struck soul directly. If not for Hao Yuan doing homework for her, Jia Le would have been scared to wet pants, kneeling on ground begging for mercy long ago.

Besides, she now had another kind of courage: She was doing things for poor people, to avenge poor people. So not panicked at all in heart. Instead calmed down.

"She is bluffing," she thought, "Uncle Hao was right: biting dogs don't bark. If she really wants to torture me, why talk nonsense to me?" Thinking here she calmed down instead.

"Outside knows Phoenix Mountain Villa Master Zhao does great good deeds, unexpectedly inside has act of setting up private court." She said with sarcasm, "This servant naturally can't bear boards in Steward Office. Although grew up in poor family since young, also beaten by parents. But haven't received bamboo boards..."

Xihua knew her words carried thorns, intending to provoke her. Didn't move expression, said calmly: "Master beating servant is not shameful. He is unhappy in heart, venting anger on me is deserved."

"Sister speaks rightly." Jia Le was young after all, seeing her completely unprovoked, felt somewhat at a loss unknowingly. But she remembered Hao Yuan's words firmly: moving is worse than being still. When not knowing what to do, wait for others to move first.

"So speaking, you are unwilling to say who let you come?" Xihua stretched legs, said leisurely.

Jia Le had a sudden inspiration, hurriedly pasted up kneeling on knees, began pounding legs for her, smiled: "What words Sister says, if Sister asks, does this servant dare not say. Just that after saying will Sister report to Master to arrest people?"

"Is it your turn to ask this matter?"

"Yes, this servant talked too much." Jia Le lowered head, "Speaking of person sending me, also wants to see Sister very much."

Xihua's mouth corner raised slightly: "What is good to see about me."

"That person said: Sister is a marvelous woman."

"Hehe." Xihua couldn't help laughing out sound, "A meal of boards beat out a marvelous woman, this beating was worth it!"

"What words Sister says," Jia Le knew she was already moved. According to Hao Yuan's instruction, neither hasty nor impetuous, said slowly, "Sister suffered this time, it was out of righteousness—not small benevolence small righteousness, but great benevolence great righteousness..."

Xihua was startled: "He really said so?" This was too strange, actually exactly same as what Master said!

Jia Le knew words already entered port, nodded affirmatively: "Exactly!"

Xihua's mood was somewhat messy. She paused for quite a while, then said: "You go back first."

"Yes." Jia Le knew matter was already half done, whispered, "Sister don't call people to arrest me, this servant body weak, can't bear family law torture..."

"Too much talk." Xihua leaned body backwards, "You just go."

"Thank Sister for grace." She stood up, quietly blessed another blessing, retreated out.

Zhao Yingong finished listening to Xihua's report in a small room, silenced for a long time. The other side sending such a little girl surprised him somewhat. This made his originally simple plan have some flaws.

In his original plan, the opponent would inevitably send a heavyweight figure to infiltrate the villa to persuade Xihua to act as an insider—maybe would promise heavy profit. Then as long as letting Xihua maintain contact casually while dealing with them, then sending people to watch this person, it would be easy to find the black hand behind scenes by following the vine to get the melon.

Zhao Yingong believed the black hand wanting to deal with him this time was absolutely not a small force. From Rice Riot starting, to various nursery rhymes, placards, all showed opponent's financial power and execution power were very strong. If couldn't take this opportunity to eliminate it, future trouble would be endless—Heaven knew how many years later Council of Elders' army would land in Shanghai.

However the opponent only sent a twelve-year-old girl—of course in this spacetime, twelve-year-old girl wasn't considered small, but this was after all only a child, absolutely wouldn't be some important figure.

Did opponent have other plot? Or thought Xihua's value not big, not worth sending important figure to instigate? Zhao Yingong originally had plan in mind, this moment had feeling of losing direction.

If torturing Jia Le now, naturally could ask something out, but value wouldn't be too big.

"You just agree to meet her first." Zhao Yingong said, "See how she arranges."

"Yes, servant knows."

"I see, matter is not so simple." Zhao Yingong was somewhat worried, "Enemy seems to have smelled something. You don't agree too readily. This gang is old foxes, definitely will test if you truly defect. You go first, rest well. I will send people to watch Jia Le."

After Xihua retreated, Zhao Yingong called Zhao Tong in again.

"How is investigation of Jia Le's background?"

"Didn't expect really not easy to investigate!" Zhao Tong frowned slightly, "She herself reported home in Nanxiawa. That ghost place is famously poor lower corner locally. Ordinarily absolutely no outsiders go in! People inside know each other. Outsiders whether disguised as peddlers, beggars or traveling doctors, can't hide from people. Several people I sent didn't even have chance to talk to people!

"Later found out her father sold lotus root starch balls by West Lake, sent people to watch outside. Seeing people selling lotus root starch balls coming out then stared, only then found her father. Sending people to inquire among vendors by West Lake again, finally knew Jia Le is indeed his daughter—originally called Little Sanniang. Their family indeed lives in Nanxiawa. Family situation is exactly same as she wrote in resume."

"So speaking, she is indeed just an ordinary poor family child."

"Yes, absolutely correct."

"Then who told her to study? Where did this school name come from?"

"Said to be a teaching gentleman in Nanxiawa."

"Teaching gentleman?" Zhao Yingong's brows frowned.
