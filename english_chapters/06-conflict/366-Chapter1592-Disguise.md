# Chapter 1592 - Disguise

Given Li Yongxun's position, leaving a signature on these documents wasn't unusual, but this was a bit too coincidental. Liu Fuqing decided to personally visit the National Police Headquarters to investigate the case of "illegal solicitation" and see if there were any other clues.

Before leaving, he assigned a task to Ke Yun: "Secretly arrest Li Yongxun immediately."

"Are you dressed yet?" Sima Qiudao asked impatiently in a low voice once again from the outer room.

A few days ago, he had instructed the female warriors he led to leave the inn separately and quietly assemble in this small courtyard he had rented at a high price.

To change their disguise, the Qiongan Inn was too conspicuous. This small courtyard was located in Lingao's "rich residential area" and was very secluded. It was exactly the right place for disguising.

Zhou Zhongjun's voice came from the east wing again: "Almost ready."

This sentence had been repeated several times, and almost an hour bad passed. Although the girls in the east wing were rustling and whispering endlessly, the clothes were still not changed.

However, it was inconvenient for him to rush them. To avoid suspicion, a man leading these female disciples in action—most of them were eighteen or nineteen years old, in the prime of their youth, and disciples of various sects—if any gossip were to arise, his reputation for half a lifetime would be ruined. Therefore, he kept a straight face and didn't say a word.

At this moment, Sima Qiudao sat dryly in the central hall, looking as if his "heart was as still as water," but inside he was agitated and restless by the chirping voices of the women: The sun was already high in the sky. If they didn't set off, it might be too late.

Sima Qiudao had already shaved his head at a barbershop and bought clothes at a clothing store. He dressed himself as a "Fake Aussie" commonly seen locally. In order to imitate the style of those "cadres," he specially bought a "fountain pen" and inserted it into his chest pocket.

Looking at his "Chinese-style jacket," he only felt very awkward: his head felt cool. He had never worn such short clothes—it wasn't that he hadn't worn "short attire," but he was completely unaccustomed to the Aussie clothes with hems that only just passed the waist. And these pants were a bit too "fitting."

"Oh my, no, no, it's too short..."

"I can't wear this, I'm going to tell the Abbess!"

"Sister Zhongjun, how do I wear this bra?"

...

Sima Qiudao gasped for a breath of coarse air: These thieves! Their rebellion is truly unconventional! If you want to rebel, just rebel. Why create these shameless patterns!

In order to get the "Fake Aussie female student" uniforms, Sima Qiudao and his female disciples had run their legs off these days. Uniforms were nowhere to be bought, and attacking female students in secret to strip their clothes was difficult to initiate: Fake Aussie female students were rarely seen on the streets.

Seeing the day approaching, Sima Qiudao decided not to plan on "female student uniforms" anymore. He directly asked Zhou Zhongjun, who was most familiar with "Fake Aussie women's clothing," to act and buy a lot of women's clothing from East Gate Market—even if they couldn't pretend to be female students, pretending to be "female Fake Aussies" was better than nothing.

Unexpectedly, in the end, it was Stone Old Man who had a way. Sima Qiudao successfully obtained three sets of Fangcaodi female student uniforms.

Getting these three sets of old uniforms was a huge relief for everyone. However, looking closely, these old uniforms only had tops and skirts, and were very worn. The matching shoes and socks were completely missing.

"Shoes and socks are easy," Zhou Zhongjun, who had always worn "Song style" clothes, was very familiar with Lingao's clothing stores. "The leather shoes they wear are not sold outside, but I heard they usually wear black cloth shoes too. Such black cloth shoes are everywhere, and white socks are easy to find."

But there were only three sets of uniforms, so it was impossible for all female disciples to change their outfits. Only three people could get close to the Real Aussies. After thinking again and again, Sima Qiudao decided to let the three young female disciples with the best skills disguise themselves as female students, while the others would coordinate nearby.

Although this group of female disciples were not the main force of the assassination—Zhuo Yifan and others were—Sima Qiudao estimated that the others probably wouldn't even have the chance to get close to the Real Aussies. In the end, it might depend on the desperate strike of these girls to salvage some face...

Fortunately, their status was very low. Even if they died, it wouldn't be a big loss to the various sects. If they could assassinate a few Real Aussies, it would be somewhat justifiable.

In the east wing, seven or eight women were chirping and talking. The glass windows of the room were tightly covered with curtains, making the originally bright room dim. A large full-length mirror specially bought stood against the wall. The bed and table were cluttered with various clothes.

Zhou Zhongjun was wearing a female student uniform, and her hair had been trimmed. She looked quite the part. However, the other female disciples were not as easygoing as her. Of the other two designated female disciples with the best martial arts skills, one was "resolutely refusing" at first, unwilling to wear the student uniform because it was "corrupting public morals." It wasn't because the skirt was too short—that wasn't considered a big problem anymore—but because the matching bra she bought made her chest look too high and full when worn, which could be called "lewd."

Zhou Zhongjun had no choice but to let her wrap herself with cloth strips according to the old rules, which finally allowed her to change into the uniform. Although Nan Wan'er didn't make a fuss, she was blushing all the time because the clothes didn't fit well. After putting them on, she kept pulling the skirt down, almost pulling it off.

As for the other female disciples, they either complained that the skirt was too short or that their arms were exposed, or that the neckline was too big... Some were unwilling to wear socks and insisted on wearing trousers under their skirts. Others disliked the pattern of the clothes, saying they were too plain and "taboo" to wear...

After tossing and turning for nearly an hour, Zhou Zhongjun finally appeased everyone, and they all changed into "Song style" women's clothing.

Sima Qiudao glanced hurriedly at the transformed female warriors, only to see them all acting coyly, looking as if they wished they could find a crack in the ground to crawl into. The heroic spirit of the Jianghu daughters of the past was gone. He couldn't help but sigh secretly in his heart: The thieves have corrupted the morals and harmed people to this extent!

He said a few simple words, telling them not to care too much about their clothes, so as not to reveal flaws to the thieves.

"In the past, Yu Rang painted his body to look like a leper and swallowed charcoal to make himself mute in order to assassinate Zhao Xiangzi, rendering his appearance unrecognizable and begging in the market. He did it only to avenge the feud of his master's single surname. Today, our uprising is to save the people of the world!"

After saying these words, he ordered the distribution of weapons.

The weapons were all short weapons that were easy to hide on the body, either short swords or Emei daggers. Everyone was equipped with two or three flying darts. In order to achieve a one-hit kill effect, all weapons were tempered with poison.

"Groups of two or three, set off separately!" Sima Qiudao said in a deep voice.

The sluice gate slowly opened. Qian Duoduo gently pulled the rudder. The *Xiaocang* glided lightly across the water surface and entered the Wenlan River.

It wasn't a tailwind right now, but this wasn't difficult for the female sailing team who could already operate the sails proficiently. They skillfully shifted the direction of the sails. The *Xiaocang*, freshly painted with white oil paint, nimby avoided a train of barges belching black smoke on the river surface and headed toward East Gate Market.

The small boat sailed on the surface of the Wenlan River. The regulated Wenlan River surface was wide. The girls gazed at the scenery on both banks. The breeze blew, making them feel refreshed and happy.

Qian Duoduo and Zhong Xiaoying wore striped naval shirts and canvas shorts, working barefoot. Sonia refused to dress so "coolly," but she was also in working attire. Only Lin Ziqi and Zhang Yunmi were dressed up. Lin Ziqi wore the full set of the Learning Institute uniform according to the "dress code," while Zhang Yunmi had already put on her performance costume.

"How about it? Taking a boat like this is also very nice, right?" Qian Duoduo said proudly.

"But we made a big detour for no reason," Lin Ziqi said. This idea came from Qian Duoduo: Everyone would gather at the Feiyun Club and then take the *Xiaocang* to the gymnasium for the rehearsal.

Today was the day of the official rehearsal. Although it was called a rehearsal, it was actually a very formal performance. All performers had to go through the normal performance process, only without the transitions, intermission, and leadership speeches. The three days of programs were run through in one day.

Scheduling the rehearsal day on a rest day was also considered. The rest day allowed more students and young naturalized citizens to observe. During the formal performance, the audience was allocated according to industries and ratios, and the seats reserved for teenagers were limited. The target of the new culture popularization was focused on young people.

"Is it appropriate for us to go to the gymnasium like this?" Zhang Yunmi sat in the cabin. "Uncle Dongmen said we should take a carriage, and there would be guards escorting the carriage."

Lin Ziqi and Zhang Yunmi originally intended to follow Dongmen Chuiyu's instructions and take a carriage escorted by security personnel. But Qian Duoduo encouraged them to take a boat from the club to the gymnasium.

"Don't worry. The water surface is very safe today. Didn't the guard who escorted you to the club today say so? The water is actually safer than the land—any movement by the rebels is clear at a glance."

Lin Ziqi asked, "Speaking of which, why didn't you let the guard take the boat together? having him would guarantee some safety, right? Besides, he needs to participate in the rehearsal himself, killing two birds with one stone."

Zhang Yunmi also said, "I think we could have let him take the boat together. This is too unreasonable. He looked quite disappointed."

"Our *Xiaocang* has an all-female crew. How can we have a man on board?" Qian Duoduo shook her head like a rattle drum. "Besides, with me as a guard, you're still not assured? His level might not be better than mine."

Lin Ziqi laughed: "You're bragging again."

Qian Duoduo got anxious: "Has he fired more shots than me? Humph, and those two black powder revolvers he carries, I won't even roast them..."

"Alright, our safety depends entirely on you. Don't drop the ball," Lin Ziqi said helplessly. "Uncle Dongmen said that there are enemies active in Lingao now."
