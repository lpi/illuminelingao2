# Chapter 1569 - Family Matters

"How old could her little brother be? Just one year old. What could possibly be the problem?" Lin Ziqi asked curiously. "No little weewee? Mentally disabled? Or already knows to lift his sister's skirt?"

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Lin Fatian said disapprovingly. "I'm not going to tell you anymore."

"I'm sorry, Dad, please continue. Stopping halfway is going to kill me."

"Last time we were drinking together, he got drunk and started lamenting his troubles: there's been some family strife lately." Lin Fatian hesitated a moment, drained the beer in front of him in one gulp. "His wife... Life Secretary, has been quite unsettled."

Zhang Yunmi's father had been an unsuccessful man in the old spacetime—the type who'd tried many jobs without making headway in any. He knew a little of everything but was mediocre at all of it. His wife had abandoned them when Zhang Yunmi was very young, divorcing him and leaving. Before deciding to join the crossing, he'd been working as a network administrator at a smallish company.

As one might imagine, such a profession garnered little attention after the crossing. Zhang Yunmi's father had always been a "basic laborer." Even as ordinary Senators successively earned promotions over the years, he remained merely an obscure mid-level cadre in the Planning Commission: Director of the Data Division. He managed the Planning Commission's computer database and the newly built massive card index system.

"...As you know, Uncle Zhang is a man without much ambition. He feels his current life is pretty good. Living arrangements are handled by the General Affairs Office, Zhang Yunmi has grown up, and his Life Secretary has given him two kids in a row—he has a son now, living a flourishing little life."

"That sounds great. How is Uncle Zhang's Life Secretary 'unsettled'? Won't let him in bed? Or is she putting a green hat on Uncle Zhang?"

"Where did you learn to talk like this?" Lin Fatian said disapprovingly.

"Please. Your daughter is seventeen, not seven..."

Lin Fatian looked at his daughter. Indeed, from any angle, she was already a woman. But the image that surfaced in his mind was still the child who had clutched his hand tightly on the deck all those years ago.

He sighed inwardly, his feelings complicated as he glanced at Menglan busy in the kitchen. He raised his beer and took another long gulp before saying slowly:

"Originally things were fine, but after his Life Secretary gave birth to a daughter, she changed. How to put it—" he hesitated, searching for the right words, "—she's become a bit difficult..."

"Difficult how?" Lin Ziqi's mind instantly raced through countless melodramatic plotlines from romance novels.

"Old Zhang didn't go into details, but basically, she's been very unkind to his daughter..."

"What? She dares to mistreat Zhang Yunmi? She's asking for death!" Lin Ziqi's eyes widened in shock, the image of Xueyi from *Romance in the Rain* surfacing in her mind.

"It's not that extreme, but there's been cold remarks and passive-aggressive behavior with housework. Every time Zhang Yunmi comes home, she doesn't even cook. Old Zhang ends up ordering takeout. He says it started when she gave birth to her daughter and worsened after she had the son. When Old Zhang says a few words about it, she claims she's got two kids to look after now, the younger one just weaned—how can she manage everything?"

"Then get an hourly domestic maid. Doesn't the General Affairs Office have such services?" Lin Ziqi thought about Zhang Yunmi's usual manner—she didn't seem like someone being mistreated, just not particularly eager to go home.

"They did. But Old Zhang says his wife—Life Secretary—has been acting strange. Every time Zhang Yunmi comes home, there's nothing but cold looks. Even if Old Zhang shows a bit more concern for Yunmi, it leads to trouble. Either she finds some excuse to beat her own daughter, or she picks a quarrel about wanting to kill herself... It's given Old Zhang no peace."

"She's got such nerve?" Lin Ziqi was utterly puzzled. In her understanding, Life Secretaries were loyal to the Senators heart and soul. The Senators' grace to them was "higher than mountains, deeper than seas." From her daily interactions with Menglan and other maids, Lin Ziqi knew they placed great importance on hierarchical distinctions, completely regarding themselves as servants.

It was hard to imagine a "slave girl" acting this way toward her master. Without the Senator, this Life Secretary would be nothing. "Uncle Zhang is a Senator, and she's just a concubine... uh, Life Secretary. Isn't she afraid Uncle Zhang will fire her in a fit of rage? The Arts and Sciences College is full of Life Secretaries-in-waiting who haven't gotten posts yet."

"Fire her? Then what about the children? One's three, one's one. Without a mother, even with an hourly maid, they can't be properly looked after." Lin Fatian smiled bitterly. "What can Old Zhang do besides swallow his anger?"

"That's true." Lin Ziqi understood a bit now. Life Secretaries who had borne children weren't merely Life Secretaries anymore—they were mothers of Senators' children. The children were their greatest asset. "Holding the children hostage—that's shameless!" she said indignantly.

"Who's saying otherwise."

"But what's she after by making such a fuss?" Lin Ziqi suddenly wondered. Why not live a perfectly good life instead of stirring up the household until chickens fly and dogs jump? There had to be some scheme.

"From what Old Zhang says, it seems she wants Yunmi to marry off early..."

"What's the point of that?" Lin Ziqi was dismissive. "First of all, it's none of her business. Second, Yunmi hardly ever stays at home anyway—she's not in the way. Besides, she'll be eighteen soon. The General Affairs Office will naturally assign her an apartment. She'll move out without being pushed. What's the point of making such a fuss?"

"You don't understand." Lin Fatian's frown deepened for his drinking buddy, his voice gloomy. "What this woman's scheming is that once Yunmi is married off, there'll be no one to compete with her son for the family property."

Lin Ziqi's face flushed with anger. "Bah, shameless! What right does she have to covet family property? A Life Secretary is at most a live-in mistress—she gives birth to a son and starts thinking about property? Uncle Zhang must be blind!"

"Why else do you think Old Zhang regrets it? He said while drinking that if he'd known, he never would have wanted a Life Secretary at all. He could have just lived peacefully with his daughter! Housework can be done by hourly maids anyway."

"You men talk a good game," Lin Ziqi scoffed. "He's even younger than you, Dad, isn't he? I absolutely don't believe he could endure going without a woman. I heard Uncle Zhang was quite the fighter during the Maid Revolution—charging up to the Executive Committee gates, just short of hitting Ma Supervisor with a brick."

Lin Fatian really didn't know what to say about his daughter. He frowned and drank another half cup of beer, then smacked his lips. "Old Zhang's in a bind right now, so stop making sarcastic remarks."

"He can't hear my sarcastic remarks anyway. Besides, I'm not wrong." Lin Ziqi said, "Doesn't the General Affairs Office handle this? Aren't all Life Secretaries managed by the General Affairs Office?"

"How can the General Affairs Office handle this? It's a family matter!" Lin Fatian emphasized the words "family matter." "As the saying goes, even an upright official finds it hard to settle a family dispute. Besides, what can the General Affairs Office do? She hasn't done anything wrong. At most they could throw this woman out—but Old Zhang can't agree to that either. Troubled as things are, they're still a family. Once it goes to the authorities, everything becomes official business. Old Zhang can't bear to see his two children motherless!"

"In the end, it's just that Uncle Zhang is too soft." Lin Ziqi said disdainfully. "If he just toughened up, would that woman dare be so arrogant? It's outrageous—Yunmi is a Senator! If Menglan acted like this, I'd whip her into submission first!"

Before she'd finished speaking, something clattered to the floor in the kitchen. Lin Ziqi turned her head impatiently. "What happened?!"

"Nothing... my hand slipped, something fell."

Lin Ziqi sneered. "If you're *care-ful*, nothing will happen!"

"Yes, Young Miss," Menglan replied tremulously.

Lin Fatian said disapprovingly: "Don't get carried away. Why are you taking it out on Menglan?"

Ziqi's face contorted briefly—her eyes blinking as if tears were about to fall. She covered her face and choked out: "I don't even have a little brother yet, and you already think I'm a nuisance..."

Lin Fatian panicked. "Xiaoqi, don't cry! Dad doesn't want a son! You'll always be Dad's darling daughter..."

Lin Ziqi suddenly dropped her hands and made a face. "Just kidding! Dad, don't worry. Even if that day comes, I won't put you in a difficult position."

"Don't say that..." Lin Fatian's expression was conflicted. "Dad won't let you suffer—"

"Suffer? I won't." Lin Ziqi said lightly. "I know how to handle it. I'll definitely never let you end up in Uncle Zhang's situation." Then she sneered again. "Menglan, bring out the chicken soup."

That evening, Menglan served with extra care, not even daring to sit in Lin Ziqi's presence. This made Lin Fatian shake his head repeatedly. After all, he was a modern person raised under the red flag, harboring "simple feelings for the working people." He found this kind of "lording over others" behavior quite distasteful. Compared to his daughter, who'd grown up watching palace intrigue dramas and romance novels, he was even less suited to this "hierarchical" situation.

But family dynamics were like this—if the east wind doesn't prevail over the west wind, then the west wind prevails over the east. Otherwise, the family couldn't function. So he was helpless.

Lin Ziqi read for a while before yawning and getting up to change into her nightgown. Though the environment here was beautiful with fresh air, there was no network connection like in the Senator apartment complex, nor various modern entertainment facilities. Entertainment options were extremely scarce. Already a bit tired, and with the "excursion" tomorrow, she went to bed early.

The next morning, she rose early. Lin Fatian wasn't up yet, but Menglan was already awake, and steaming hot breakfast sat on the table. After Lin Ziqi finished eating, Menglan handed her the canvas bag.

"Everything's packed," she said respectfully.

What to bring for an excursion—Lin Ziqi had already given instructions the night before. She took the bag. "I won't be back for lunch. Just save me dinner—no need to wait for me."

"Yes, Young Miss."

"Dad's off today too, so you can have a nice day together, just the two of you." Lin Ziqi smiled suddenly as she put on her woven sandals.

Menglan's face flushed red, and she didn't dare say a word.

Lin Ziqi left the farm and found the Dongfeng carriage sent by the General Affairs Office already waiting at the designated exit. Since the route to Lingao Point Park wasn't entirely within the Green Zone, and Lin Ziqi was a "minor Senator," regulations required a security escort. So the previous evening, Menglan had reported Lin Ziqi's itinerary to the General Affairs Office service point at the residential area entrance.

"Good morning, Miss." The Guard Company soldier standing by the carriage step saluted. His handsome face and dashing bearing made Lin Ziqi look at him several times.

"Good morning." She lifted the hem of her skirt and stepped onto the footboard.

The soldier steadied her arm at just the right moment. "Please be careful getting in," he reminded politely.

"Thank you." Lin Ziqi smiled graciously, quite enjoying this small gesture of attention.

The interior of the Dongfeng carriage was clean and comfortable. The General Affairs Office Service Division had cleaned and redecorated the vehicle as soon as they received the itinerary the previous night: seat cushions, back cushions, and curtains all freshly washed and changed. Fresh flowers had been placed in the vase, a faint floral fragrance perfuming the air. The cabinet had been stocked with fresh bottled mineral water; the ice bucket held chilled kvass and soda.

The carriage began rolling forward to the clip-clop of hooves. Without her having to give any instructions, the driver would naturally deliver her to her destination on time, following the route on the itinerary.

The carriage trembled slightly with the turning of wheels on the smooth road. Lin Ziqi gazed out the window. The weather was fine, and after the rain a few days ago, the air was fresh—neither cold nor hot. Perfect for an outing.

*Thank you for bringing me here, Dad.* Ziqi whispered to herself.

Though this spacetime had no Mercedes, no BMW, no Rolls-Royce—she was riding in a mere two-wheeled carriage—those who could ride in such a carriage in this spacetime were more noble and more powerful than those who could afford luxury cars in the other world.

Although Lin Ziqi had loved watching palace intrigue dramas since childhood and was obsessed with prince-and-princess Cinderella stories, she also knew very well that in the original spacetime, unless she had extraordinarily good luck, her future would inevitably be marrying a man of similar family background, the two of them scrimping and saving to pay off the mortgage, driving an "economy family car" to work—and worrying about parking problems...

Now, she was a genuine "princess," riding in a carriage with guards escorting her, with a respectful Life Secretary attending to her at home. What did those so-called "fashionable lifestyles" in magazines amount to? What did buying an island amount to? Someday, she would claim Tahiti Island all for herself. Queen of Tahiti? Too ordinary. Queen Consort of Tahiti? That would require a king. How about just "Mistress"? That sounded a bit off...

The carriage took her all the way to the Flying Cloud Club at Lingao Point Park. Moored at the pier in the bay was the *Feiyun*, all sails set. Though this ship had been in this spacetime for nearly six years and made several long voyages, it remained in excellent condition—clearly, the Qian family had put great effort into maintaining it.

On the beach, the coconut grove planted on D-Day had already achieved a modest scale. Beneath the trees stood three elevated thatched huts—the location of the Flying Cloud Club. Lin Ziqi and her classmates from the Academy had come here more than once for bonfire parties and barbecues. She had also joined children from the Selection Group for gatherings here, even singing a few songs—drawing ardent gazes from some of the older primary school boys...

But now, behind these three huts, sat a new boat cradle with a beautiful small boat resting on it. The boat wasn't large—at most five or six meters long—fitted with a very tall mast. Since there was no suitable paint for coating, it retained its natural wood color, looking very pretty against the blue sea and silver sand.

Qian Duoduo was wearing a sailor's striped shirt and canvas shorts, a stiff straw hat on her head, barefoot, carrying a tin bucket. She squatted by the boat cradle, daubing something on the hull. Seeing Lin Ziqi arrive, she set down her brush and came running over excitedly.

"Look! How do you like this boat?" She proudly waved her hand, showing off her new toy.

"This boat is really beautiful," Lin Ziqi said sincerely. Though she knew nothing about boats, this light, pretty hull with its streamlined body and straight mast immediately gave her an impression of well-proportioned beauty.

"Too bad we can't make white paint—otherwise, painted white, it would look just like a white swan!" Qian Duoduo said dreamily. Actually, by Lin Ziqi's reckoning, the boat was already beautiful enough—natural wood colored, covered with lovely grain patterns.

This boat had been designed and built by Qian Shuiting according to blueprints for a type of small family boat common in America. Stores there sold ready-made plans and kits that could be assembled in one's backyard or garage. Normally they were kept on trailer frames. Lengths ranged from 17 to 21 feet. The Qian brothers had collected quite a few blueprints and specialized reference books in electronic format when they crossed over, and had even brought a set of specialized tools.

The small boat they had built together was 17 feet (5.18 meters) long and 7 feet 4 inches (2.26 meters) wide. Though it looked small, a well-built boat of this type could not only sail along the coast but, with the right equipment, was even capable of ocean crossings.

"What kind of wood is this? The grain is beautiful." Lin Ziqi studied it closely.

"The deck is teak," Qian Duoduo said. "The planking is fir. As for the keel, that's Philippine mahogany. The lumber mill has so much good wood, it's almost overwhelming."

Lin Ziqi kept nodding, though in truth she couldn't tell one wood from another. She was just thinking about how no wonder Qian Duoduo's father could be Speaker. They said he could hunt in the mountains, shoot on plains, and build boats at sea, and was even a double master's degree holder... Her own father was nothing compared to him.

Truly, comparing people could make you die of envy.

"How long did it take to build?" Lin Ziqi carefully stroked the hull. "Did your father build it all by himself?"

"Just over a year, I guess. My dad and I built it together. Uncle Zhou and Second Uncle helped when they came back to Lingao. I said over a year, but really we only worked on it during holidays. Who has time otherwise?"

"You're really amazing," Lin Ziqi said sincerely. "That's so impressive."
