# Chapter 1535 - Rooting Out Spies

"True, it's logically consistent. But Comrade Wu Mu, your logic is missing a key link." Zhao Manxiong shook his head. "Who exactly told them Daoist Zhang has a 'Life-Bound Divine Talisman'? We all know very well that Daoist Fu has no such thing."

"Since they're a folk religious sect, isn't it normal for them to fabricate supernatural nonsense?"

"That's for their followers. The higher-ups know the truth. They might cook up such a thing to fool believers—to justify their own incompetence and failures—but would they actually fool themselves into sending people to destroy something that doesn't exist?"

"You mean these people are just pawns, and the real mastermind hasn't shown himself?" Wu Mu had worked at the Political Security Bureau for years; he could at least make this connection.

"That's one possibility." Zhao Manxiong nodded. "But I'm more inclined to think someone, for some purpose, tipped off the Southern Infinite Sect about Zhang Yingchen's so-called 'weak point'—tempting a sect already suffocating under New Daoism's pressure to stake everything on one throw."

"What would be the point? Just to create trouble for us?"

"Comrade Wu Mu, your skepticism has merit. If someone can persuade the Southern Infinite Sect's leadership to send people to Lingao on a suicide mission, that person is no nobody—they must hold considerable authority and wealth in Ming social strata. Since they can mobilize such resources, why waste them on a scheme to burn down Yunji Temple—something that's ultimately inconsequential to us?"

Yunji Temple had only completed its first phase; it was hardly "magnificent and grand." Even burned to the ground, it would cause no real damage to Lingao—just wasted materials and labor. Only a religious sect like the Southern Infinite Sect would obsess over the temple's supposed "mystical power."

*Yes*, Wu Mu thought—there were so many worthwhile targets to sabotage in Lingao. Even setting a fire in East Gate Market would be more effective than burning down the remote Yunji Temple.

He recalled the entire Umbrella Case and ventured, "They're a smokescreen."

Zhao Manxiong nodded and stubbed his cigar in a blue-and-white porcelain brush washer. "Very likely. Do you remember the battle when pirates raided Bopu at night after D-Day?"

"Of course." Wu Mu nodded. "You mean the real mastermind still hasn't revealed himself, and the Southern Infinite Sect is just a smokescreen to lull us?"

"Yes. That's a strong possibility. And we're probably facing a heavyweight figure from within the Ming system."

"The Ming court?"

Zhao Manxiong smiled. "Comrade Wu Mu, the current Ming court as a governing entity is already inadequate even as a medieval regime. So I don't think it's them."

Wu Mu was still trying to follow. "You mean..."

"Let me put it this way: it's certain people within the Ming court—people who wield great power and resources. Do you understand?"

"You mean 'using public authority for private ends'?"

"Your phrasing is precise and accurate." Zhao Manxiong nodded.

"But what benefit would they gain from moving against the Yuan Elder Court?" Wu Mu still couldn't figure it out. The Yuan Elder Court was now a colossus whose bulk and teeth could no longer be hidden. This wasn't like back when Consort Tian's family tried to seize Ziming Tower—the Yuan Elder Court's strength had not yet been truly witnessed. To imagine anyone now trying to snatch something from the Yuan Elder Court was like pulling a tiger's tooth.

"That we don't know." Zhao Manxiong shook his head. "First, we need to know who they are. I estimate the enemy has already embedded spies in Lingao—not just among natives, but naturalized citizens, and possibly even within the naturalized-citizen ranks of our enforcement agencies."

These words sounded light, but the implication that enemies might be embedded in enforcement agencies left Wu Mu incredulous.

The Yuan Elder Court's enforcement agencies had all been built following the structures and systems of the 20th century's most successful such organizations. Though hodgepodge knock-offs with obvious limitations due to personnel quality, in this timeline they were practically trans-era existences.

To say enemies might be embedded among natives or ordinary naturalized citizens was plausible; after all, the Political Security Bureau couldn't be infallible. But to suggest that enforcement agencies, with their strict recruitment and monitoring, harbored "enemies"—Wu Mu couldn't help feeling the Deputy Director's imagination was a bit wild.

"You think it's impossible?" Zhao Manxiong seemed to sense his thoughts.

"Frankly, I find it hard to believe."

"You're honest." Zhao Manxiong nodded. "In a sense, you're right. But we must consider that people learn. What they lack compared to us is the accumulation of systems and knowledge—not intelligence. Furthermore, many of our systemic advantages cannot actually be implemented."

Wu Mu conceded this point. Even the Political Security Bureau, which was picky about personnel and invested heavily in training, had staff of mediocre caliber. Many were doing work beyond their capabilities. Without Yuanlao cadres personally handling quality control, who knows how many blunders would result.

"So..."

"Have you carefully read the case files for the Umbrella Case?"

"Yes."

"From entering Lingao to going underground, the Southern Infinite Sect's people proceeded step by step, methodically. Their cover identities were well-chosen: some shaved their heads to become naturalized citizens, others posed as natives... they had every document needed. Even naturalized citizens couldn't navigate all that—without someone from an enforcement agency guiding them, they could never have gotten this far." Zhao Manxiong looked worried. "There are definitely spies inside the enforcement agencies."

"I understand. Arresting people isn't the priority—the key is rooting out the spies."

"Exactly. Ultimate masterminds, final bosses—none of that matters to us. Even if it's Chongzhen, Hong Taiji, or some shogun or viceroy, to the Yuan Elder Court they're just paper tigers; their destruction is only a matter of time. But spies embedded within us..."

"Good. I'll contact Comrade Zhou Botao immediately and have him continue the Umbrella Case."

"No, let him wrap up the Umbrella Case. What comes next we'll call the 'Parasol Case'—have him pick a few elite investigators and handle it secretly."

---

Political Security Bureau Investigation Division Chief Zhou Botao sat in a chair, carefully considering the directive Deputy Director Zhao had conveyed through Wu Mu half an hour ago about establishing the Parasol Case Team.

Understanding Deputy Director Zhao's intention wasn't hard. But rooting out spies from within the enforcement agencies was tricky. In Lingao, enforcement agencies weren't just the Political Security Bureau.

Setting aside organizations that existed only on paper, the Yuan Elder Court's main enforcement agencies numbered three and a half: the National Police, the Political Security Bureau, the Inspectorate, and the Lingao Security Command—the last being essentially the Lingao Garrison Battalion's headquarters.

The Inspectorate could be set aside. Their main business was anti-corruption; currently they only had headquarters staff, and not many. Though they had enforcement authority, they were really a hybrid of ICAC and audit bureau. The department was highly specialized, and most staff spent their time on office work. Zhou Botao thought spies were unlikely there.

In Zhou Botao's view, the chance of a mole inside the Political Security Bureau was minimal. The Bureau had strict internal controls and comprehensive systems. Zhou Botao didn't think natives of this timeline could pull it off.

The largest and most important enforcement agency under the Yuan Elder Court was the National Police, with branches all over Hainan Island and numerous personnel. Though the Political Security Bureau seemed more "intimidating" and nearly omnipresent, once outside Lingao, its field agents depended entirely on the National Police to operate. Even in Lingao, many activities required National Police support.

But precisely because of its massive structure and large staff, entry standards weren't strict. The Yuan Elder Court's police system had expanded rapidly in recent years; infiltrating it to lie low wouldn't be hard.

If any enforcement agency was most likely to harbor embedded spies, it was the National Police, Zhou Botao thought. Moreover, in recent "controlled-use personnel" routine internal monitoring reports, suspicious individuals had already been identified within the National Police.

The problem was that the relationship between the Political Security Bureau and the National Police was somewhat delicate. Though cooperation had been smooth so far, targeted investigation of "spies" might provoke backlash from National Police leadership—many Yuanlao already felt the Security Bureau was overreaching.

Though the directive was to investigate secretly, they first needed to secure understanding from National Police leadership. In other words, they needed hard evidence that spies existed within their ranks.

Zhou Botao picked up Li Yongxun's case file from the table. Indeed, Li Yongxun had problems, but having problems didn't prove guilt.

Li Yongxun had been flagged because a public-order activist had reported to the police station that strange symbols had appeared on a wall on a certain street in East Gate Market.

The police had initially assumed these were marks left by thieves hoping to strike it rich in Lingao—they often used symbols to communicate. An officer familiar with underworld cant was sent to investigate.

But when the investigating officer arrived, he found he didn't recognize these symbols. He copied them and brought them back. Every officer in the Public Order Division with underworld experience and knowledge of various cants was called in to identify them. They even brought a few veteran thieves from the labor camp to try. Nothing.

So the lead was passed to the Political Security Bureau. After a covert investigation, the Bureau discovered the symbols had been updated, confirming someone was using codes to communicate. A surveillance post was set up on the second floor of a shop across the street to secretly monitor the location.
