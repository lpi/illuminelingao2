# Chapter 1300 Leniency and Severity

"It's good that you know." Wang Ruixiang said, "You have been a soldier of the Senate for several years, you should know that the Senate stresses clear distinction between right and wrong the most. You and your subordinates have seriously violated discipline, and this matter must be dealt with seriously!"

"Yes, I am a bastard!" Huang Xiong hung his head, fearing to speak.

Wang Ruixiang scolded Huang Xiong harshly. Seeing that the other party dared not quibble and his attitude was fairly correct, his anger subsided by half. Originally, this matter was not too big: regarding soldiers messing with women, as long as both parties were willing, the Senate generally did not want to interfere too much. This was mainly considering that most officers and soldiers of the Imperial Army were currently unmarried, and there had been almost no opportunity for retirement in recent years. Long-term near-ascetic service was bound to cause sexual frustration.

Regarding the establishment of facilities such as camp followers' brothels, small-scale discussions had been held multiple times within the Senate. However, due to fierce opposition from many Senators, it had never been put on the agenda. Nevertheless, the needs of the military in this regard could not be ignored forever—they had to be given an outlet to vent their desires.

This incident, rather than being angry at them for promiscuously messing with women, was more about being annoyed at them for messing with women without distinguishing priorities while performing duties in a combat zone. This was not only disregarding discipline, but the paralysis and carelessness revealed therein was a very dangerous signal: openly keeping women who had not undergone purification and political censorship by their side, entering and leaving military vital areas like the command post, could easily leak secrets. If it were a woman with ulterior motives, she could easily obtain a lot of intelligence. Taking it to the extreme, she could even assassinate officers, steal pistols, and then assassinate Senators.

Wang Ruixiang said slowly: "I know you live a bitter life in this ice and snow. Not to mention the soldiers, you are a man in your thirties, and an officer, yet you don't even have a family..."

Huang Xiong originally thought Wang Ruixiang's next sentence would be: "Drag him out and shoot him!" Unexpectedly, the Chief mentioned his suffering first. Amidst the fear, he couldn't help being moved. His eyes felt hot and his nose twitched a few times.

"However, discipline is discipline. As the chief officer of the detachment, you didn't stop your subordinates' major disciplinary violations, and even took the lead in messing with women yourself!" Wang Ruixiang changed the subject and returned to the theme of "violation of discipline", "What else do you have to say?!"

"Report to the Chief: None!" Huang Xiong's back was straight as a ramrod, saying tremblingly.

"Ideally, tell the truth: Did you embezzle relief rations to spend on women?"

Huang Xiong hurriedly shook his head: "Report to the Chief, I, Huang Xiong, guarantee with my head, no!" He argued that the amount of relief rations cooked daily was fixed, and he absolutely dared not embezzle it privately.

"What about what you spent on the women? They originally didn't have a ration share. Stranded here, if not pinching grain from the mouths of the refugees outside, what did you use to feed them?!"

"This..." Huang Xiong lowered his head, "At the beginning, when hooking up... indeed we gave them an extra half bowl or a bowl—this indeed happened. We all have an extra subsidy of relief rations. Everyone used this to support the women—as for embezzlement, everyone didn't have the guts either, knowing the discipline..." He raised his head, with an expression of utmost sincerity, "This, if I, Huang Xiong, have half a word of lie, may I be struck by lightning!"

"No need to swear and make vows. The people I brought will take inventory and reconcile the accounts immediately. Tell your quartermaster to handle the handover instantly!" Wang Ruixiang said, "As for what you said about using your own rations to support women, we also have ways to find out clearly: whether there is such a thing, you know best yourself."

Wang Ruixiang ordered the brought guard team to take over the warehouse, and then began counting and checking accounts. By evening, the results came out. Various inventory accounts checked out correctly. Suspicion of embezzling relief rations could be ruled out. However, the matter of diverting rations for extra refugees could not be found out just by checking accounts. This relied on further provision of information by members of the Committee of Ten.

However, neither the Senate nor the military intended to delve too deeply into this matter: the personal issues of the Imperial Army officers and soldiers indeed should be put on the agenda. Otherwise, similar incidents would only continue to occur. The fact that Senators chose and bought maidservants for themselves was not a secret in Lingao. Soldiers risked their lives but could not settle down and start a career. If they were too harsh on this, it would cause alienation.

As long as no embezzlement or the like was involved, the problem of using one's own rations to seduce women would not be more serious than US and Soviet soldiers using military rations and nylon stockings to wantonly seduce German and Japanese women during World War II.

Now that no embezzlement of relief rations could be found, the seriousness of the problem was halved. But necessary punishment was still needed. Although privately keeping extra refugees was not yet serious enough to be "infringing on Senate property", this matter was still a typical case of using public office for private gain.

"Bring your woman here." Wang Ruixiang said.

"Yes!" Huang Xiong hurriedly ran out, and after a while brought in a young woman.

She was wearing an old winter coat of the Imperial Army. Although it had many patches, it was mended and tidied up cleanly and neatly. Wrapped around her thin body, she appeared very small. A small face with a pointed chin gave Wang Ruixiang the illusion of looking at a little girl.

"Kowtow... to the Chief..." Huang Xiong couldn't think of what greeting to ask her to perform for a moment—Chiefs didn't like kowtowing. Instead, the woman performed a curtsy generously.

"How old?"

"Replying to the Chief: The maidservant is sixteen years old." Wang Ruixiang thought she looked about twelve! But the girl spoke with a Shandong accent, which made him feel very intimate. Looking again, her wrists and fingers were very slender, and her skin was white and delicate, obviously not a daughter of a poor family. Looking down further to see a pair of bound feet, he understood a bit.

"A daughter of a grain-tax household, I presume."

"Yes, yes." Clumsy-tongued Huang Xiong hurriedly cut in: he saw Wang Ruixiang looking at the woman's bound feet and knew that the Chiefs were most taboo about this. He hurriedly explained: "This, originally wanted to unbind the feet, but she won't be able to walk after unbinding..."

Wang Ruixiang ignored Huang Xiong and asked: "What is your name?"

"The maidservant is called Wang Bao'er."

"How did you fall into this state?"

"The family suffered a flood... and then bandits passed trough... The whole family had to flee. Hearing that there was a way to live here, only then defected here..."

"Any relatives left?"

"None left..." Tears already gleamed in the girl's eyes, "...On the road... all died... completely..."

"You are a daughter of a grain-tax household, presumably literate."

"Yes, studied for a few years with father when young."

"Oh, still a scholarly family." The corners of Wang Ruixiang's mouth smiled slightly, "Does father have an academic title?"

"Dare not, father only read a few books and recognized a few characters."

Although the words were modest, in this timeline, finishing the Thirteen Classics made one an intellectual. Being able to say acted as read a few books, the tone was not small either.

"Are you truly willing to follow this Huang Xiong?"

"Naturally sincere." Wang Bao'er blinked a few times, forcing a smile, "Being able to follow Soldier Lord Huang is already a huge blessing for the slave maid..."

Looking at her aggrieved expression, he also knew that she didn't feel it was any "huge blessing" in her heart. How could a daughter of such a humble family look up to a martial man like Huang Xiong. It was just that in the chaotic world, human life was as cheap as paper. She, a weak woman, was just drifting with the tide to have a way to survive.

But this was none of his business. Looking at the bright side, this was also a manifestation of the superiority of the Senate breaking the old order and establishing a new society. He thought, you feel aggrieved now, later when Huang Xiong rises to prominence, you will feel that your luck is bursting.

Wang Ruixiang smiled and said: "Seeing that you are a woman from a good family, tidying up this place in perfect order. In the future, managing household affairs, you will definitely be a good wife—Huang Xiong, you have good fortune."

Huang Xiong was overjoyed, knowing that the Chief had approved their matter. He hurriedly stood at attention and saluted: "Thank you, Chief, for fulfilling us!"

"Don't be in a hurry to thank yet. You seriously violated discipline this time, the punishment you deserve is absolutely unavoidable! And your subordinates, punished just the same!" Wang Ruixiang said seriously.

"Yes, Chief!"

"Blow the bugle, assemble!"

"Yes!" Huang Xiong saluted and ran out.

The detachment was quickly assembled. Wang Ruixiang subsequently announced the preliminary handling decision of this serious disciplinary violation incident in front of the detachment: "Huang Xiong is dismissed on the spot, and the entire detachment is transferred to Jeju Island for rectification and training."

However, as a sign of leniency: he announced that all refugee women who had established cohabitation relationships with soldiers could be transported away with this refugee ship—after receiving purification, they would be sent back to Lingao for settlement. Those willing to marry soldiers would make up the procedures after the Northbound Detachment returned to Lingao. Those unwilling to marry soldiers would have their cohabitation relationship dissolved without exception and be treated as ordinary refugees.

Once the order was announced, the soldiers who were originally harboring apprehensive hearts felt relieved. Originally, this matter was just seizing a loophole to enjoy pleasure in time and vent sexual desire. However, having been with these women for a long time, they inevitably developed feelings over time and gradually felt inseparable. At this moment, although they were to be transferred to Jeju Island for "rectification and training", the Chief also acknowledged their marital relationship. Thus, as soon as the "dismiss" command came out, everyone immediately let out a small cheer.

"Don't be happy too early. Now your detachment is responsible for loading the relief rations onto the carts." Wang Ruixiang said, "Reflect well on the mistakes you made with sweat!"

Huang Xiong's detachment went to load the carts cheerfully. Instead, it aroused a little envy from the detachment that came to replace them. Wang Ruixiang called the detachment leader over:

"I know what you are thinking—but you'd better tighten your belts for me!" He said, "When the operation is over, there will inevitably be merit evaluation and awards, and lifelong events will also be easy to solve. Don't delay your future for this moment of pleasure!"

"Report to the Chief! I promise to tighten my belt!" The detachment leader blinked his eyes, "And my subordinates!"

"That's right," Wang Ruixiang nodded, "In addition, I will increase the relief rations supplied to extra refugees daily by another ten percent. Try to keep a few more people alive."
