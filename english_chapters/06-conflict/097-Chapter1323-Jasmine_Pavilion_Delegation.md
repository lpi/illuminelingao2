# Chapter 1323 - The Jasmine Pavilion Educational Delegation

The main gate of Fangcao Di had recently been reconstructed. It was a neoclassical triple-arched gate built of machine-cut, perfectly square limestone blocks—this approach avoided the endless debates about "exceeding one's station" that constantly arose with traditional Chinese architecture. Starting fresh was far easier.

On the cinder road in front of the gate, Zhang Zhixiang, Fangcao Di School's newly appointed executive vice-principal, was already waiting to receive them. Originally, Hu Qingbai was to greet them to show proper respect, but the Executive Committee ultimately decided that Hu Qingbai was an official of People's Committee rank, and having him greet a local county delegation would be too demeaning. Sending the school's vice-principal would suffice—as the only comprehensive school currently operated by the Council, Fangcao Di should at least be on par with Peking University or Tsinghua University.

The position of Fangcao Di's principal had long been an object of contention among many idle transmigrators. The Organization Department had held firm under pressure, insisting that the school's administrator must have a background in education; otherwise they would be automatically rejected. This had even sparked a round of debates about whether Western or Eastern educational models were superior. Ultimately, this Zhang Zhixiang had secured the coveted position thanks to his background as a chemistry teacher, his experience as a vice-principal, his ability to hunt, his Class A1 heavy truck license, and his certification as a first-class chef—a combination of credentials that marked him as a "German-intellectual-physical-aesthetic-labor" all-around teacher.

Zhang Zhixiang disdained the shut-in transmigrators' uniform fantasies and depraved-teacher tropes—education and teaching was no fun job at all. Teaching and nurturing people could be described as writing every word in blood and tears. Elementary and middle school basic education in particular was practically a martyr's path for teachers.

Zhang Zhixiang had entered this field during an era when teachers were still poorly compensated. He held a rather contemptuous view of the phenomenon after teacher salaries had improved dramatically and people scrambled to get into teaching. In his opinion, using high income to attract talent to the profession was putting the cart before the horse. He had said more than once at Fangcao Di faculty meetings: Teaching must be a profession that is poor but commands lofty respect. Teachers must have the same halo of sanctity as martyrs. Only then can it attract people who are truly committed to education and willing to dedicate themselves to it. Otherwise, what comes are merely profit-seeking mediocrities. All sorts of bizarre phenomena in education arise from this.

This lofty discourse had sparked debates among the transmigrator faculty at Fangcao Di more than once. Over time, the transmigrator teachers had given Principal Zhang a nickname: "The Martyr."

Principal Zhang was beaming today, wearing a crisply starched fine-cloth "faculty work uniform." Though transmigrators often wore work clothes of the Zhongshan suit or military uniform style made from local cotton cloth to facilitate their work, Fangcao Di was after all a school, and the transmigrator teachers dressed a bit more formally. After Principal Zhang took office, he had specifically asked the female transmigrators at the Women's Welfare Society to design and tailor a special faculty work uniform to demonstrate the dignity of the teaching profession. He also stipulated that within the school grounds, all teachers—transmigrator or naturalized—must wear this faculty work uniform.

Following this came mandatory daily sign-in work systems and quantified workloads. Previously, transmigrator teachers had been relatively relaxed; as long as they had no class, they could come and go as they pleased. Teaching loads could also be adjusted based on one's condition. After Principal Zhang took office, he immediately announced new regulations: All teachers, transmigrator or naturalized, must sign in on time on workdays. Workloads were detailed by week, with hard quotas on class hours that couldn't be missed without special reason. Besides class hours, there were also detailed assessment metrics for research work and administrative duties.

These regulations were nothing special for naturalized teachers—they were already being squeezed inhumanly to the maximum extent, and now this was just formalizing things in writing. The workload increase was limited, and conversely their income even increased. But the transmigrator teachers were full of complaints: coming to another timeline where they couldn't even lord it over female students was bad enough, and now they had to deal with publication counts and educational reform projects. Just the enormous class-hour requirements alone were enough to keep everyone busy.

Zhang Zhixiang was unmoved. With Hu Qingbai's support, he continued implementing his "New Deal" and announced that any transmigrator teacher unwilling to comply would be politely shown the door. Through sheer determination, he pushed the new policies through.

Flanking the principal on both sides were Fangcao Di's Four Heavenly Kings: Yuan Ziguang, Head of the Science Education Research Group and Dean of Academic Affairs; Xiao Zhaochuan, Head of the Humanities Education Research Group and Training Director; Bai Yu, Head of the Industrial and Physical Education Research Group; and Dong Yizhi, Director of General Affairs.

These Four Heavenly Kings were currently the main transmigrator teachers at Fangcao Di. There was also a female teacher respectfully called "Principal Qian," who was Lü Yang's mother. However, she was mainly responsible for educating transmigrator children under eighteen and compiling teaching materials—the reclusive type who never participated in large-scale events.

A column of horse-drawn carriages arrived grandly and stopped before Fangcao Di's gate.

"Distinguished guests, we have now arrived at the main entrance of Fangcao Di Educational Park. Please disembark and watch your step." Tang Tang, the deputy director of the Lingao County Office, descended from the first carriage. With a portable amplifier headset on her ear, she spoke smilingly, like a tour guide.

Following her call to disembark were more than a dozen people dressed as scholars of the Great Ming. In the lead, a man leaning on a cane with someone supporting him—it was Liu Dalin himself.

Regardless of timeline, Zhang Zhixiang had ample experience handling visits. He immediately went forward "warmly and cordially."

"Ah, a pleasure to meet you."

"Long have I admired your reputation."

...

The "Jasmine Pavilion Educational Delegation"—as it was called in the official notice—exchanged a round of you-bow-I-bow pleasantries with the transmigrator teachers. Liu Dalin and Wang Ci studied the transmigrators before them. Though the pirates had occupied Lingao for nearly five years now, the distinction between transmigrators and naturalized citizens was still immediately apparent to Liu Dalin and his party. No matter how high-ranking a naturalized citizen might be, the gap in bearing from a transmigrator was always visible. Not only were they different in height and build from ordinary people, but their every gesture and movement differed from the norm.

However, these transmigrator teachers before them—including the Fangcao Di headmaster—Wang Ci and Liu Dalin had never heard of any of them. In traditional society, intellectuals not only treated teaching as their most common means of livelihood but psychologically often regarded themselves as "teachers who civilize the common people"—after all, Confucius himself was most famous for teaching and nurturing people. Seeing these Australian colleagues, each member of the party had complex and varied feelings in their hearts.

Regarding Liu Dalin, Wang Ci, and their party who had come to "investigate and study," the Executive Committee had no special requirements—they simply needed to demonstrate the Council's principle of "teaching without discrimination" and the progressiveness of "modern" education. There was no intention of placing great importance on the visit. Therefore, Zhang Zhixiang didn't plan to accompany them personally—he was too busy to finish his work even without sleep—and assigned the Director of General Affairs, Dong Yizhi, to handle the reception duties.

Dong Yizhi was originally an idle transmigrator, an unsuccessful engineering graduate. He had been a yes-man before D-Day and remained one after. Feeling he truly couldn't find suitable work, he had simply applied to the education sector to become a teacher. Fortunately, he had been low-profile in the past, without any outrageous talk about "conquest" or "lolis are supreme" and such, so despite not having a normal-school background, his application was approved. He came to Fangcao Di as a basic-level teacher and concurrently served as Director of General Affairs.

Dong Yizhi watched Principal Zhang perfunctorily greeting this group at the school entrance. Looking at Liu Dalin, who appeared vigorous and transformed compared to before, and the somewhat timid Wang Ci, he thought to himself: What are these old fogeys here for? He knew the current state of Jasmine Pavilion well. Most likely they felt things couldn't go on this way and wanted to learn something.

This learning of ours, you can't take it away, Dong Yizhi thought. If you really learned it, it wouldn't be Jasmine Pavilion Academy anymore—it would become Jasmine Pavilion School.

But aloud he said: "Ah, distinguished guests, please come inside, please come inside." With those words, he squeezed out a smile and gestured for them to pass through the school gate.

Huang Bingkun and Excrement Baron Li were also in this party. After Young Master Li had questioned him about his family joining the Tiandihui, he had rushed back to the Huang Family Stockade that very night to get answers from his father.

"Father, you're being foolish! If you join that whatever-it's-called Tiandihui, they'll have formal entry to our halls, and everything will be controlled by the pirates from behind the scenes. When that happens, will those tenant farmers and hired hands still listen to our family? Won't we be putty in their hands?! Besides, the pirates are still shallow-rooted. If someday the imperial court comes back, we'll be guilty of consorting with pirates!" Huang Bingkun earnestly remonstrated with his father in the study.

"Kun'er!" Huang Shoutong roared thunderously. "You still won't give up! The Huang family cannot be ruined in your hands! The court? The court indeed! Can't you see—this Great Ming is finished! With all the nation's elite troops and finances, they couldn't even retake Shenyang. The eastern savages have breached the passes repeatedly, and the capital has been put on alert time and again. And you expect them to cross the sea to recover Qiongzhou?!"

The argument ultimately ended with Huang Bingkun outwardly submitting but inwardly defiant. Not only that, but Huang Shoutong also instructed him to use this opportunity to visit Fangcao Di to inspect the school's environment and conditions, and to handle enrollment procedures for his elder brother's child.

Father has truly set his heart on joining the pirates! Huang Bingkun thought of his third brother who had died tragically, and couldn't help feeling a pang of grief. Though he knew his father had his reasons for being forced to do this, whenever he thought of the blood feud with the pirates for killing his brother, the flames of hatred would blaze fiercely in his chest.

Seeing that Fangcao Di's headmaster—whom they called "Principal Zhang"—had merely come to greet them perfunctorily before taking his leave, leaving only some tall, dark fellow with the title "Director of General Affairs," Huang Bingkun knew the Australians weren't taking their party seriously at all. His family now subscribed to *The Lingao Times*, so he knew the highest official in charge of the pirates' schools was called Hu Qingbai. This Principal Zhang was already an unknown; now they sent an even lower-ranking official to receive them—clearly a sign of contempt.

Thinking of this, a sense of humiliation welled up in his heart. But when he looked at Liu the Successful Candidate, he saw only a beaming smile with no trace of displeasure. His composure was well-developed indeed.
