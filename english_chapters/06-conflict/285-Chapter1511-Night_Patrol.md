# Chapter 1511 - Night Patrol

Though somewhat reluctant, Lin Ming turned and walked back quickly. His heart raced with excitement. True, he had not seen Li Yongxun clearly, and the voice had spoken in so-called "Australian official speech," but her accent was unmistakable. Lin Ming was ninety percent certain the speaker was his sister-in-law!

His feelings were mixed—joy and worry at once. Joy, because Li Yongxun was safe and sound. Serving the Australians in their constabulary meant she was unharmed. Clearly she had not been reduced to a Cropped-Hair concubine or official courtesan, nor "publicly auctioned off" to become someone else's wife or concubine. Moreover, as a "constable," she would have considerable freedom of movement. Worry, because having submitted to the Cropped-Hairs, she was no different from "acknowledging a thief as her father"—and worse, she had enlisted in the despised role of constable!

Though military households were not the highest of origins, yamen runners were truly "base people"—their social standing ranked with that of entertainers and courtesans. If word reached the Ming that his sister-in-law was serving as an "Australian constable," her parents might die of shame! Even he and his wife would lose face. She had evidently been a constable for some time now, yet she had neither seized an opportunity to escape nor sent word home. Clearly, she had been bewitched by the Australians.

Lin Ming knew that the Australians excelled at bewitching hearts. Once someone fell under their spell, even eight oxen could not drag them back.

It seemed the only course was to appeal to reason and emotion—especially the bonds of family. Fortunately, she and his wife were close as sisters, and in Nanjing there were still parents and kin. Surely she was not completely heartless. If he could persuade her to return to Foshan, then whether by soft words or by force, once she was handed over to her own parents and family, his burden would be lifted. As for daydreams about "half a claim"—Lin Ming had long banished such fancies. Lingao was a dragon's pool and tiger's den for him; there was no room for such romantic notions.

Walking and pondering, Lin Ming missed a turn without realizing it and found himself in an unfamiliar alley.

The alley was quiet. Though there were a few shops and stores, all had already shuttered for the night. The street was empty. Lin Ming knew he was lost, but the street lamps shone just as brightly here, and there were signposts. He quickly pulled out the map and consulted it under the lamplight, soon locating his position.

Seeing where he was, he realized he had wandered quite far. Returning the way he came would mean a long walk. Looking ahead, the Wenlan River was not far. A thought struck him—why not walk straight to the riverbank, survey the terrain, then loop back?

His mind made up, he continued along the alley. He knew this was not a commercial district; the buildings lining the street were mostly residences—the best place to observe ordinary life under Cropped-Hair rule.

In these side lanes, there were few pedestrians, and even rickshaws were rare. Yet even the most secluded, remote alleys were lit by street lamps. The roads were mostly paved with stone slabs and remarkably clean even at night—no garbage, no filth, not even puddles. At every alley entrance was a public toilet, and midway there was a communal well-platform. Quite convenient.

The towns built by the Cropped-Hairs were truly well-ordered—no wonder so many people were willing to shave their heads and change their clothes if it meant joining them. As he silently marveled, he noticed that the shops and residences along the street had all closed their doors. Few windows showed so much as a glimmer of light; most had clearly already retired for the night. *This is true peaceful living,* he thought. *If everywhere were as bustling as East Gate Market at all hours, that would actually seem abnormal.*

As he walked, footsteps suddenly sounded ahead. Lin Ming focused his gaze: a squad of short-jacketed "false Cropped-Hairs" was approaching from the opposite direction on the street. The leader carried a blue lantern. Seeing they looked like "public servants," Lin Ming considered ducking into a side alley, but the street lamps were too bright. To hide now would only arouse suspicion.

With that thought, he had no choice but to adopt a nonchalant manner and walk toward them. After all, he had his papers, and he carried nothing forbidden.

Sure enough, the patrol blocked his path when they reached him. The lead constable brought five fingers together and raised his hand to the side of his head, at the same time snapping his heels together with a clack—apparently some sort of salute. "Night patrol. Papers check."

Lin Ming inwardly groaned, *Why did they have to stop me?* He was quite nervous but struggled to keep it from showing. Meanwhile, wearing a smile, he respectfully produced his identity certificate and handed it over. The false Cropped-Hair took it and carefully examined it under the lamplight.

"Lin Min... temporary certificate? New arrival?" His voice carried a note of suspicion. The lantern was immediately raised close to Lin Ming's face—apparently to study his features. Lin Ming's expression turned awkward. By now he could see clearly: apart from the leader in black "police" uniform and conical hat, the others wore Cropped-Hair garb with different insignia colors—evidently not all "public servants." But everyone wore a red armband reading "Patrol."

This was a night watch. Even though the Cropped-Hairs had no curfew, their night patrols were quite cautious. No wonder there were no night-watchmen or guardhouse soldiers in the alleys.

"Yes, I only arrived in Lingao three days ago..." Lin Ming replied hastily. "I work at Haixing Store." He quickly produced his "employment certificate" as well—this one bore stamps from Haixing Store, the employment agency, and his temporary household registration. Manager Qian had said this certificate was sometimes more useful than the temporary ID.

He had thought to slip a few circulation vouchers from his sleeve along with the papers, but he did not know the "going rate" here. Bribing officials required finesse; too much or too little could both cause trouble. Besides, he had heard the Cropped-Hairs governed subordinates very strictly, and most false Cropped-Hairs dared not accept bribes.

The lead policeman muttered something to several of the others, then turned the papers over and over, examining them from every angle. Apparently finding nothing suspicious, his expression softened slightly, and he handed the papers back.

"Where are you headed?"

"Back to Haixing Store..." Lin Ming said hastily.

"You're going the wrong way." The false Cropped-Hair policeman's face regained its suspicious look. "If you keep going, you'll reach the Wenlan River."

"I've been busy at the shop all day and came out for a walk, to get some air... I thought I'd stroll to the river, loop around, then head back to sleep..."

The false Cropped-Hair policeman was about to say something more when another of the patrol whispered a few words—apparently guessing where Lin Ming was really headed. Suppressing a laugh, he spoke quietly. At once, the policeman's expression shifted to one of "sudden realization." He stopped questioning and merely cautioned:

"Security hasn't been great at night lately. Robberies happen now and then; there've even been assaults. Be careful walking alone." The policeman added, "Don't go out too late at night."

"Yes, yes. Many thanks for the warning, Sir."

Lin Ming was already breaking out in a cold sweat. He did not know the other false Cropped-Hair, much less what words had stopped the interrogation. But he had no time to dwell on it; he hurried forward, and only when the footsteps had faded behind him did he finally exhale in relief.

Before long, the alley came to an end. Before him rose a stone embankment as high as a city wall, built entirely of fitted stone. Below the dike, the road was lined with trees and flowering plants, and there were long benches for passersby to rest—a quiet, secluded spot.

Lin Ming guessed this must be the Wenlan River. Seeing steps leading up the dike, he climbed them.

Atop the embankment, a fresh breeze swept over him, lifting his spirits and broadening his heart. He gazed into the distance: East Gate Market blazed with lights, glittering like the Milky Way. Along both banks, dots of light sparkled; the riverbank lamps reflected on the water's surface, rippling like fish-scales in the night wind... Such a nightscape Lin Ming had never seen. Even Guangzhou during the Lantern Festival did not boast such brilliant illumination.

*Truly a million taels' worth of night scenery!* A nameless feeling of bliss welled up in Lin Ming's heart. He stood transfixed, staring—his sister-in-law, the Ming, the Cropped-Hairs—all forgotten. Only after a long while did he withdraw his gaze.

Reluctantly, he strolled along the embankment. There were patrol teams here too, but with his earlier experience, Lin Ming handled them with composure and passed unobstructed. As he walked, he suddenly heard a commotion ahead—voices, and mingled with them, the sounds of stringed and wind instruments, and women singing. Curious, he wondered: this was already the fringe of East Gate Market, and according to the map it was all side lanes here. What kind of lively establishment could this be?

Fortunately, this was also where he was to turn back. Lin Ming descended from the embankment and followed the sounds. Before long, he came upon a decorated archway. On the lintel were three large characters: "Heyuan Street." At the arch hung two pink palace lanterns—under the street lamps they served no purpose for illumination, but added a certain suggestive air.

The sounds of music and women's laughter grew clearer. Lin Ming paused—what sort of place was this? Entering the archway, he found a short street, narrow, lined on both sides by small buildings—no different from other lanes.

Yet here, every house had pink lanterns hanging by the door. The entire street was bathed in pink. Few pedestrians walked the street; the music and voices came from within the houses.

Lin Ming was no innocent. In a flash, he understood: this was Lingao's courtesan quarter! No wonder the patrolmen had looked at him that way—the route he had been walking led right past here. They must have assumed he was seeking pleasures.

Lin Ming smiled bitterly to himself. In the old days, he would not have minded sampling this "Cropped-Hair delicacy," tasting these "Australian pleasures"—according to those who claimed to have tried them, "the amorous delights are beyond anything known to mankind." But now he was on an important mission, and there were no wealthy merchants around to pick up his tab. The few circulation vouchers in his pocket had to last until next month's payday.

With this thought, Centurion Lin could only walk glumly past the archway. He quickened his pace and headed back, soon returning to Haixing Store. Back in the courtyard, he found Wang Xinglong had already returned and was animatedly regaling several colleagues with tales of East Gate Market.
