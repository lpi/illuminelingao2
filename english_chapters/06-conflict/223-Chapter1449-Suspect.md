# Chapter 1449 - Suspect

"Yang Xinwu? Never heard of this Elder—" Su Wan poured tea for Mu Min.

"He's a teacher at Fangcaodi. No position, so not very famous."

"A teacher at Fangcaodi? Really makes one's imagination run wild." Su Wan said maliciously.

"Obviously, this Elder Yang and his life secretary are the biggest suspects in the case. Just from the perspective of solving the case, it's pretty much clear here. However, the chain of evidence is not yet complete, especially the so-called record of Yang Jihong sending Lin Xiaoya away at 22:10 that night, which plays a rather troublesome role."

"This little trick proves nothing. The body is right inside the dormitory area; it's practically admitting guilt..."

"I find this point strange too, because taking the body out to dispose of it would bring more trouble to the investigation." Mu Min nodded, "But in most cases, criminals are flustered; few can truly think calmly with foresight and hindsight."

******

The dormitory area was deserted. It was working hours, and the Elders were almost all out; the maids were either busy with housework at home or out shopping. There were only a few cleaners sweeping the streets in the dormitory area.

The crime scene remained as it was. Because neither Elder police officers nor Elder forensic doctors were in Lingao at the time of the incident, those who came to the scene were their disciples, so the level was naturally worrying. Therefore, apart from recording the condition of the crime scene and taking several photos, not much disturbance was made to the scene. Only a cordon was set up around it to prohibit anyone from entering or leaving. The roof of the third floor leading to where the fall occurred was also sealed off.

The position of the corpse marked with lime inside the cordon was clear, and the bloodstains on the cinder ground were still clearly visible.

"Where is the body?" She asked Wu Xiang.

"Sent to the Forensic Center."

"When will the autopsy report be out?"

"Afraid it will take a few days. Chief Su went to Kaohsiung; the General Affairs Office said she won't be back for several days."

Responsible for guarding the scene nearby was a naturalized police officer. Seeing the arrival of the senior officer, the police officer who had been standing guard slouchingly immediately stood at attention and saluted.

Seeing naturalized police officers made Mu Min angry—although wearing the same uniform, the staff of the Political Security Bureau were all capable and upright regardless of age, radiating the style of "secret police." In contrast, the police under her command looked seedy one by one; some were simply transferred from slightly disabled soldiers. Not only were their spirits inferior to others, but their uniforms were also invariably worn like flour sacks, with armed belts hanging loosely on their bodies. He had an old 9mm revolver and a baton.

"Name? Constable." Mu Min asked without taking her eyes off the position of the corpse.

"Yao Dacheng, Regional Commander!"

"Okay," Mu Min asked in a gentle voice, "When was it discovered?"

"22:16 last night, Chief. We were on duty then. After receiving the call from the duty room here, we handled it as priority one and came over. We arrived here in 10 minutes." Yao Dacheng seemed very proud of his speed.

"Who found him?"

"Her." Yao Dacheng pointed behind his shoulder.

A slightly plump middle-aged naturalized woman wearing a gray skirt "cadre suit" walked over. She was the manager of the Elder Service Agency here. Her face was gray and she looked very depressed.

"How did you find the body?"

"My dormitory is on the third floor. I got up at night. Coming back from the toilet, I saw the door leading to the roof was open—although that door is usually not locked, it is usually closed. I went up to take a look and saw—a corpse downstairs."

The female manager seemed still in shock; she pressed her chest: "It was too tragic, all blood..."

"Did you hear any unusual noise before that?"

"No, I was asleep."

"Why are you sleeping here? Which Elders live in this Elder dormitory building? Is there a list?" Mu Min felt the building at the crime scene was a bit strange—it was much smaller than other buildings.

"This is not an Elder dormitory building." The Service Agency manager said with a mourning face, "This is the Service Agency building."

Such a big incident happened in the Elder dormitory area, and this girl had to fall to her death downstairs of the Service Agency. Not to mention her manager position couldn't be kept, she might even be arrested and tortured, made into a scapegoat...

The Service Agency, as the name suggests, is an institution serving Elders in the dormitory area. The building housed a sizable laundry room, offering washing and ironing services; a convenience store providing simple fast food, snacks, and daily necessities for Elders; a sewing agency providing clothing repair services... The offices and staff dormitories for the cleaning team and gardening team serving the dormitory area were also located in this building.

"How many people were in the building on the night of the incident?"

"Besides me, about five or six people. According to the regulations of the General Affairs Office, every department has people on duty, ready to serve Elders at any time."

"Give me a list."

"Yes, Chief."

"Let's go to the roof and have a look."

The roof was a flat type rare in the dormitory area. According to the female manager, this was mainly for the convenience of drying clothes from the laundry room.

"The person probably fell from here." Wu Xiang pointed to a place where the railing was damaged.

There were photos of this place in the file. The railing on the roof was wooden and very simple. At the gap, the upper one of the two railings had completely broken off, while the lower one was intact.

"Where is the upper railing?"

"Sent to the Identification Center."

"The broken part has severe corrosion marks—it should have rotted hollow long ago. Broken after being hit by a heavy object." Wu Xiang said.

Mu Min didn't speak. The National Police didn't have professionals in identification. The so-called Identification Center was barely set up by a few of them with criminal investigation backgrounds based on materials in the Great Library and things learned from the TV series CSI, combined with their own experience. Only heaven knew what useful things could be found on the railing.

Apart from that, the roof left no useful clues: no footprints worth extracting, nor fragments of clothes or other residues.

But by this time, Mu Min roughly understood the case, and the suspects were also generally clear. Although the motive was not yet clear, as far as the case itself was concerned, this was a very simple case.

"Alright, tell them they can clean up the scene." Mu Min took off her gloves, "Let them take statements. Little Wu, go to the General Affairs Office Transportation Office this afternoon and find the coachman who sent Lin Xiaoya out last night to take a statement."

"Yes, Chief."

******

"The coachman obviously couldn't have seen Lin Xiaoya." Su Wan said.

"Yes, after the coachman drove the carriage to the door of the dormitory building, Yang Jihong came out and asked him to go upstairs to move things, and then told him to send someone out together. After arriving at the destination, Bairen City Station, Yang Jihong asked him to go to the station shop to buy things. When he came back, she said the person had already entered the station and left. The coachman didn't see this person who went out in the same carriage from beginning to end."

"This is a lie to begin with."

"Evidence needs to form a chain." Mu Min continued, "My people took Lin Xiaoya's photo and asked the police on duty at the station, ticket agents, and clerks in nearby shops during that time period that night—no one said they had seen her."

"Actually, there is no need to investigate this case now. Elder Yang and his life secretary are the biggest suspects."

"Yes, maybe the Identification Center can find some new clues from the railing—undoubtedly that was the weapon used to beat Lin Xiaoya."

Speaking of this, both fell into silence. The next step was to summon and interrogate Elder Yang—this exceeded the power of the police. It required approval from the Executive Committee, or even the Standing Committee of the Council of Elders.

"This process will probably be dragged out for a long time..."

"Not necessarily dragged out," Mu Min said, "An Elder killing a naturalized citizen, just a punishment of three cups of wine as a penalty." She exhaled indignantly, "What a pity, such a young girl, at an age like a flower..."

She suppressed her emotions and returned to the narration of the case.

*** ***

After coming out of the dormitory area, Mu Min did some paperwork first. She sent a letter to the General Affairs Office requesting to inspect Yang Jihong's personal file. In addition, if possible, Yang Xinwu's Organization Department file as well. Then she went to the Maid School—because she held a pass issued by the General Affairs Office, she could enter this place which was also very mysterious to Elders.

Led by a female staff member, Mu Min walked along the corridor towards the Director's office of the "General Affairs Office Life Secretary Training Center." On one side of the corridor was the central garden, full of greenery and blooming flowers. On the other side were classrooms with large glass windows. Through the glass windows, students could be seen attending classes. The sound of teaching drifted onto the corridor from time to time.

"...Now let's review section seventeen, pay attention to the beat, movements must be steady..."

"...When cooking noodles, first pay attention to controlling the heat..."

"...The arrival of Elders has freed our majestic suffering people from the sea of bitterness..."

"...Outside the long pavilion, by the ancient road, the setting sun connects the green sky..."

......

Dong Weiwei was already waiting for Mu Min in the office—Mu Min had called beforehand.

"Thanks for your hard work, coming all this way."

"Not at all, you are the one working hard, having children to take care of at home, and still here for the Elders, um..."

"Training little wives." Dong Weiwei sighed, "As a woman, this job really is disgusting enough. But it is much more relaxed here than the Social Work Department after all. When the child is older, I will change positions. What do you want to check?"

"I want to investigate Lin Xiaoya's situation at school."

"I have prepared Lin Xiaoya's file," Dong Weiwei handed a file on the desk to Mu Min, "Poor child, she was originally going to report to Fangcaodi in three days."
