# Chapter 1543 - The Trick

"Such hand-copied books are also legitimate local publications, considered pocket editions—the Lingao Printing Plant doesn't produce extra-small lead type yet—and some people exploit this loophole. They produce these small hand-copied notebooks, act furtively to attract newcomers unfamiliar with local customs who are eager to obtain licenses, then use shills to lure them into the trap.

"Regarding the case itself, the bookstore is selling legitimate books at clearly marked prices, with no false labeling. Hand-copied books naturally cost more than printed ones, so the pricing isn't problematic. Thus, no law has been broken. Furthermore, buying exam answers constitutes intent to cheat—something one can hardly complain about openly. Combined with the limited monetary value, victims usually just swallow the bitter pill."

"So that's how it works..." Huang Zhen nodded repeatedly.

He added quickly, "Yes, yes—so I'd very much appreciate the Director's guidance." He paused. "Huang will never forget this kindness."

"Oh my, 'Director,' 'kindness'—so formal. We all serve the Yuan Elder Court." The female director smiled radiantly. Not yet forty, and not from a poor background, her looks and complexion were well-preserved, her mature charm still present. "My name is You Xiu. Just call me Xiu'er." As she refilled Huang Zhen's cup from a thermos, her ample chest inadvertently brushed against his arm.

Huang Zhen felt something elastic and firm press against him. His heart skipped a beat. He was no novice—how could he not recognize "Xiu'er's" intentions? He was in his prime and a widower; to claim he had no needs would be a lie. You Xiu was not unattractive. Though faint lines had appeared around her eyes, the allure of a mature woman possessed a flavor quite distinct from a young girl's unripe freshness.

But martial artists strictly avoided licentiousness; adultery was a grave taboo. Especially given their current circumstances...

Huang Zhen suppressed the thought. In Ming territory, he would have sternly declared, "Sister-in-law You, please have some self-respect." But here and now, he couldn't afford such directness. He could only play dumb—laughing foolishly, drinking his tea, acting the part of a dullard who didn't understand romantic overtures.

You Xiu didn't seem annoyed. She spoke polite platitudes, telling Huang Zhen to encourage everyone to "study diligently," then suggesting "perhaps obtaining a Grade B diploma first would be useful later." Huang Zhen grew anxious. The Director was spouting official jargon—where was this "guidance" she had promised? Seeing his upright gentleman facade dampening her mood, it seemed she wouldn't reveal any "shortcut" without receiving something in return.

In the past, why would Huang Zhen have ever needed to resort to this? But Cropped-Hair territory operated by different rules than the Ming; his familiar methods didn't work here. He had to employ these low tactics. The Great Cause came first. He forced another smile:

"Sister-in-law You is absolutely right. But as you know, my people who can actually treat patients are elderly. Asking them to take examinations is extremely difficult. If Sister-in-law has any shortcut to offer, please guide me. Huang would be infinitely grateful..." He shifted slightly closer to her, smiling. "Come, allow me to toast Sister-in-law You with a cup." He stood, filled her tea mug, and held it up.

You Xiu's smile grew even sweeter. "I must drink the tea Shopkeeper Huang toasts." She took the cup, her hand grasping his.

"Shopkeeper Huang is indeed a strong man—your calluses are so thick and hard."

Huang Zhen naturally couldn't pull his hand away. "A life of toil from humble origins—I've made Sister-in-law You laugh."

"Why 'Sister-in-law'? So distant—besides, my late husband wasn't named You."

"Yes, yes." Huang Zhen steeled himself and changed his address: "Please look after me, Sister You."

"Ah, that's more like it." You Xiu sipped her tea with a smile. "Since Shopkeeper Huang favors me enough to call me Sister You, I must look after my brother." She reached for a book from the shelf beside the table.

Its cover resembled the syllabus he had purchased: white paper with red text. Huang Zhen had excellent eyesight; the shelf was filled with various "regulations"—a *Compilation of Policies and Regulations with Usage Instructions*.

She opened to a particular page and laughed. "Shopkeeper Huang, you're too impatient. Regarding the TCM Practitioner License—let alone newcomers like yourself who just 'abandoned the dark for the light' from the Ming, even local naturalized citizens with Grade B diplomas typically study in training classes for six months to a year before they pass. The Pharmacist License is easier; an apprentice who has completed their term need only read some books to succeed."

Huang Zhen recognized this as preamble; the important content was coming. He adopted an expression of attentive listening.

The Director continued, "I heard you say your doctor specializes in bone-setting?"

"Yes, Doctor Jiao is a renowned bone-setter from the North..."

"You see, for such a case, you can have him test for a 'Specialized TCM Practitioner' license rather than the general one. There are specific regulations covering this."

The "Specialized TCM Practitioner" was actually a special channel the Ministry of Health had opened for practitioners with particular talents. The TCM world contained many "one-trick pony" doctors who had mastered unique techniques: acupuncture, trauma treatment, massage, bone-setting—or specialists in difficult conditions like skin diseases, snakebites, or venereal ailments.

These categories occupied niches within TCM. Traditional healers already held low status; practitioners of these "side doors" ranked even lower—some, like snake doctors, were treated little better than beggars.

They often came from family traditions—father to son, master to disciple—mastering a single unique skill and relying on a handful of proven prescriptions for their livelihood. Frequently they had minimal education and possessed no theoretical knowledge of TCM—pure empiricists.

Expecting such people to pass the standard TCM Practitioner License was unrealistic. But prohibiting them from practicing would constitute a tremendous waste of talent. At Liu San's proposal, a special channel had been opened: no theory examination, only a practical assessment at the hospital. Pass, and one received a "Specialized License." Naturally, such practitioners couldn't touch areas outside their specific expertise.

Someone like Jiao Gongli only needed to take this specialized examination. Of course, the medicine shop would then be limited to bone-setting services.

*So there's a trick to all this!* Huang Zhen thought. No wonder everyone said "clerks are slippery as oil." Without her telling him, how would he ever have known such a loophole existed?

His anxious heart finally settled. Jiao Gongli couldn't study theory, but his practical skills were ready-made. He thanked her repeatedly.

"Why thank me? It's the Yuan Elder Court's good policies." You Xiu stroked Huang Zhen's hand. "I notice Shopkeeper Huang has thick knuckles—you must be very strong. Why not learn massage? You could obtain a license yourself." Her eyebrows rose slightly, her eyes flashing. Huang Zhen felt You Xiu's thigh pressing against his knee. Though warm and soft, the contact made the upright Huang Zhen decidedly uncomfortable.

However, this Director You clearly understood Cropped-Hair affairs intimately. To infiltrate and establish themselves here, he needed her continued assistance. But becoming this intimate wasn't proper... Huang Zhen's eyes rolled as an idea struck him. While maintaining the conversation, he reached under the table and pinched You Xiu's thigh—hard.

"Ah! Oh..." You Xiu cried out in pain, then immediately suppressed the sound. The "Oh" trailed off in a manner that sounded rather... pleasant.

"Dead ghost! So rough!" You Xiu scolded in a low voice, rubbing her leg, but her eyes had gone silky and were incredibly flirtatious.

Huang Zhen whispered, "I thought Sister liked it that way. Truth be told, this Huang has a taste for such things..." He pinched her thigh several more times. Intending to frighten her off, he used considerable force.

You Xiu moaned softly, her breath growing ragged, her eyes practically dripping water. "Yes... harder. This slave... this slave likes it rough..."

Huang Zhen groaned inwardly. He must have bruised her thigh black and blue by now. Unexpectedly, Director You had rather particular tastes; his roughness had only stoked her fire.

Making matters worse, "Sister You's" thigh was warm and elastic. Even through layers of fabric, it felt quite... good. After several pinches, he found himself experiencing a physiological reaction.

Seeing You Xiu's eyes glaze over, her body leaning into him, her hand guiding his toward her chest, Huang Zhen knew things were spiraling out of control. If he didn't stop immediately, there was no telling what might happen. He blurted out, "Sister You! This is your office!"

You Xiu, burning with desire, felt as though a bucket of cold water had been dumped over her head. Her mind cleared instantly. People came and went just outside the door; anyone could enter at any moment. If discovered, it would be an enormous scandal!

Thinking of her loss of composure, You Xiu's face turned beet red. She couldn't say a word, only hung her head in mortification.

Huang Zhen thought, *That was close!* He rose quickly. "Sister You, I shall take my leave..." Without waiting for whatever she might say, he departed directly.

Back on the street, he felt his whole body relax. He cursed the degenerate morals of this place—no wonder these False Cropped-Hair women liked wearing such shameless clothing!

Yet somehow, Huang Zhen felt a twinge of regret: That You Xiu truly was a "stunning creature"...

Though suspected of sacrificing his looks, he had undeniably advanced his relationship with the female director, which would benefit future infiltration efforts in Nanbao. He simply had to manage the "degree" of intimacy.

Back at the shop, he shared the news about the "Specialized TCM Practitioner" examination. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief; the gloomy atmosphere vanished. Setting Jiao Gongli aside, even Song Shengying, who had wanted to quit entirely, expressed interest in trying—he possessed some skill in massage and trauma treatment.
