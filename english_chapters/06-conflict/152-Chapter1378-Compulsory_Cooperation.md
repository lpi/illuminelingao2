# Chapter 1378 - Compulsory Cooperation

Just as he was making these "heroic" preparations, Duoduo's mother came. She was now formally a "monthly helper" at the Wang Siniang family. The thing she often did was to convey Wang Siniang's "instructions" among the villagers. In Shen Kaibao's eyes, she had become something like a "lackey."

Although everyone couldn't help but look down on her a bit, they also envied the "lackey's" treatment: it was said that Duoduo's mother could earn one tael and two mace of silver a month! About the same as the shop assistants at the big stores in town - earning more than many men in this village. Therefore, while everyone despised her inwardly, every time they saw her, they couldn't help but smile obsequiously and flatter her, deeply afraid of offending her and having her speak ill of them in front of Wang Siniang, resulting in their debts being collected first.

Duoduo's mother was all smiles, only telling everyone that tomorrow evening the Shen Da family was inviting all households in the village to her house for a "banquet," as a "thank-you feast" for everyone supporting her business this year.

"Bring the whole family!" Duoduo's mother called out. "Lots of wine and dishes have been prepared!"

Upon hearing this, every household got goosebumps on their backs. There was never anything good about landlords inviting tenants to dinner. It was either to increase rent or to evict tenants.

Although the Wang Siniang family wasn't landlords, they were the creditors of everyone. Creditors inviting debtors to dinner was even more self-explanatory.

"I think this is a Hongmen Banquet!" Shen Kaibao said fiercely.

But not going was absolutely impossible. Several boats had also stopped in front of the Wang Siniang family's door. Caterers who had come to cater had arrived, setting up stoves on the threshing ground, unloading baskets of pots, pans, ladles, and all kinds of vegetables and meats. Many women gathered by the river washing vegetables. On the threshing ground, fires blazed and steam rose. The fragrance of the dishes being cooked could be smelled throughout the whole village. The children's mouths watered, eagerly waiting for the feast that evening - they hadn't had such days for several years. Even the worried adults were all enticed to the point of rumbling stomachs, constantly salivating.

In the evening, the whole village, young and old, all went to the threshing ground in front of the Wang Siniang family's door. Tables and chairs borrowed from various households had already been set up there, with torches lit brightly all around. The full tables of dishes made the whole village's eyes go straight.

Wang Siniang sat at the head table with a beaming face, having her subordinates greet everyone to take their seats. She also said some polite words. Then she ordered the feast to begin.

No wine was served at the feast, but rice was unlimited. Everyone had barely been able to fill their stomachs these days with coarse grains. Now with delicacies before them, who cared what medicine this Hongmen Banquet was selling? Everyone wolfed down the food, sweeping it away like the wind, and in an instant, the dishes were all cleaned out. Several children simply took the oily soup left on the plates and mixed it with rice, eating bowl after bowl until their bellies bulged and they were almost stuffed to death. Wang Siniang hurriedly had someone bring vinegar to give them.

Seeing that everyone had eaten and drunk their fill, Wang Siniang then got to the main topic.

The debts owed by each household could temporarily go unpaid. However, Master Zhao wanted the village to continue raising silkworms - raising summer silkworms and autumn silkworms.

Ancient society's silkworm raising did include raising two or three crops of silkworms. But due to the lack of disinfection awareness and means at that time, continuing to raise two or three crops after spring silkworms often caused severe silkworm diseases. Over time, sericulture households rarely raised summer and autumn silkworms anymore.

Specifically, both parties would sign a contract. Master Zhao would loan everyone silkworm eggs, mulberry leaves, and grain as advance payment, without interest. Each household would be responsible for raising a certain quantity of silkworm eggs according to their own capacity. After the cocoon harvest, the advance payment would be deducted by converting it to cocoon quantity according to the contract price, and the remaining cocoons would be purchased at the contract price.

Everyone had heard about raising summer and autumn silkworms, but no one had actually done it. Now hearing that Master Zhao wanted everyone to raise them, they couldn't help but look at each other, and no one dared to respond.

"Everyone can rest assured. I have methods for raising summer and autumn silkworms here, and I will naturally help everyone take care of things when the time comes. I guarantee everyone's silkworm raising will succeed." Wang Siniang patted her chest about this.

No one believed her words. In their view, this was just another new trick of the rich to harm farming people.

But now no one dared to say "no." Wang Siniang held a bundle of IOUs with one percent monthly interest - they were all life-threatening ropes. Who dared say no? Tomorrow Master Zhao could send people to collect debts and squeeze every household into immediate ruin.

Zhao Yingong knew that in the current predicament, the silkworm farmers who were in a dilemma had no choice but to accept his terms. Winning the farmers' trust was very difficult. Getting them to cooperate required even more long-term, relentless effort. He had neither enough manpower nor enough time to do it slowly. He could only take advantage of this cheap purchase and force the terms onto them with lightning speed. The methods were cruel, but this was the most efficient approach at present.

Contract production - this was the first step. To truly gain the silkworm farmers' trust would have to wait until after the summer and autumn silkworm raising succeeded. Only then could they talk about forming cooperatives.

More than ten li away from Jixian Village, there was a town called Jiuli. Like most towns in the Jiangnan water country, it was surrounded by rice paddies, numerous lakes, ponds and rivers scattered like stars.

Jiuli, like most Jiangnan small towns, showed signs of prosperity everywhere. Although it couldn't be counted as a first-rate major town on the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain, it still had over five hundred households. On both sides of the stone-paved upper and lower pond roads, black-tiled white-walled homes and shops lined up one after another. Rice shops, cloth shops, grain stores, ironware shops, boat equipment stores, sundry goods shops, teahouses... not only did it have everything an ordinary small town should have, but there were also "big businesses" like silk and satin shops, dyeing houses, and silk hongs. Of course, there were also several temples and Taoist temples with swirling incense smoke, worshipping various gods and Buddhas.

In the southwestern corner of this small town, there was a residence that was not large but very exquisite. This was the "mansion" of Master Cao.

Country folk didn't understand the imperial court's regulations, and late Ming society wasn't as sensitive about exceeding one's rank as in the early days of the dynasty. Thus Master Cao, a local strongman with only a xiucai background, was grandly called "Master" by everyone, and his residence was called "Cao Mansion."

In the waterside pavilion of the "Cao Mansion's" garden and pond, the sound of singing boards being lightly tapped and women's soft singing could be faintly heard.

Master Cao - Cao Guangjiu was reclining on a xiangfei couch, eyes slightly closed, emitting faint snoring sounds. A maidservant knelt beside the couch, forcing herself to endure the afternoon drowsiness while gently massaging his legs.

Although he had been asleep for more than two quarters of an hour, without the master's orders, neither the singing girls nor the maidservant dared to stop.

Master Cao was middle-aged. Although he was a xiucai, and his family could be counted as one that "passed down poetry and books through generations," he had nothing to do with images like "fair-skinned scholar" or "romantic talent of Jiangnan." He was a tall, dark and robust fellow. His face was full of fierce flesh, showing a ferocious expression even when asleep.

Cao Guangjiu was a typical "Broken Boots Party" member - this was the "title" society at that time gave to such rogue scholars. Broken Boots Party members were almost all xiucai or students at the Imperial Academy. Considering themselves people of status, they could walk freely in government offices. On ordinary days, they monopolized lawsuits, mediated disputes, bullied the weak and feared the strong - extremely roguish. As for lending money at interest and exploiting villagers, that was even more routine.

Therefore, the Cao family originally just ran a private school in town to make a living. Since Cao Guangjiu became a Broken Boots Party member, relying on these money-making methods, in just over ten years he had prospered. In recent years, he had also monopolized the grain tax collection of nearby villages. Every year during the summer and autumn tax seasons, he could pocket quite a bit of "extra water" through methods like delaying and under-reporting. His family business grew powerfully.

Although Cao Guangjiu was a Broken Boots Party member and had done plenty of heartless things outside, his eating habits in his own hometown were still presentable. Not only was his lending interest lower than average, but his conduct was also more restrained. This wasn't because he was kind-hearted - it was really because the Jiangnan region had an extremely flourishing tradition of imperial examinations. There were many people with scholarly titles, and the gentry's power was great. As a mere xiucai, if he really offended a powerful member of the gentry, a single calling card could make his life difficult. Ordinary gentry also held the mentality of "better to offend a gentleman than a petty man," so they maintained a relationship of well water not intruding on river water with each other.

When news reached his ears that someone in Jixian Village and more than a dozen surrounding villages was lending at a monthly interest of one percent, Cao Guangjiu had people inquire as to who could be so charitable as to lend at this rate. Although lending at high interest was one of his "business lines," he had never dared to form a monopoly in the area - lending money at interest was the main income source for the gentry and masters. As a Broken Boots Party member, he absolutely didn't dare dream of eating alone.

But this blatant "business-stealing" behavior did catch his attention. He sent a few people to gather information and learned that behind the lender was a "Xiucai Master" surnamed Zhao from Hangzhou city, and this Mr. Zhao had quite a reputation among the Hangzhou gentry. Especially among the Catholic gentry, he was particularly influential.

Upon learning this, Cao Guangjiu had no other thoughts. Without a diamond, don't take on porcelain work. No wonder this Master Zhao dared to send people so boldly to "steal business." As a Broken Boots Party member, he could certainly make things difficult for the other party, but given the other party's deep background, if it really came to a confrontation, he definitely couldn't hold out. Besides, there were plenty of gentry lending money here, and he wasn't the biggest one. Why should he be the one to stick his neck out? When things got bigger, naturally some master would stick their neck out.

So Cao Guangjiu retreated. These days were the busy farming season. It wasn't time for tax collection, and no one had time for lawsuits. His "business" wasn't much. Apart from the usual routine of going to the teahouse every morning to "soak in water," gathering some news, and catching up with "friends" from all walks of life to see if there were any opportunities for making money, he was spending his days leisurely at home.

His snoring grew louder. At this moment, the steward hurried along the garden path. In his hand, he still held a visitor's calling card.

When Cao Guangjiu was sleeping, his subordinates didn't dare disturb him - or they would be hung up and beaten half to death. But today's visitor was no ordinary person. The steward walked into the waterside pavilion and called softly a few times.

"What is it?" Cao Guangjiu was awakened, originally with a belly full of evil fire. But seeing that the person who called him was the steward, he knew there must be something important and hurriedly asked.

"A guest has come to visit."
