# Chapter 1439 - Putting into Action

"Since that's the case, we'll do it this way. I will help you communicate further with the Executive Committee and the Council of Elders. You should get started as soon as possible." Jiang Shan stood up and shook the other's hand firmly.

"Rest assured. Both the Zheng family and Liu Xiang are now fish in a drying pot. Just wait for my good news."

The man who had come in and spoken was wearing a standard "cadre suit" but had long hair tied in a ponytail at the back of his head—it was none other than the current Station Chief of the Guangzhou Station, Lin Baiguang, who had secretly returned to Lingao from Guangzhou just a few days ago.

Returning to Lingao was to discuss a major matter with Jiang Shan, a matter of great importance to the Council of Elders, involving the final resolution of the Liu Xiang group.

Since the Liu Xiang group fled to the Chaoshan area, they adopted a strategy of lying low to counter the expansion of the Council of Elders' Navy in the Fujian-Guangdong waters. Because the Zheng Zhilong group had suffered a devastating blow and control over Tainan had deepened, the Council of Elders' Navy had actually completely mastered the command of the sea along the Fujian-Guangdong coast.

The remnants of the Zheng group were besieged between Jinmen and Xiamen, making it difficult for trade ships to put to sea. The Liu Xiang group hiding in the Chaoshan area was in the same predicament. They could neither plunder nor trade. A huge force sat idle, eating through resources. The Liu Xiang group was not like the Zheng family, having large numbers of estates on shore and support from the government. At present, he indeed had many men and ships, his strength undiminished, but this huge strength had become a heavy economic burden.

Although Lin Baiguang was in Guangzhou, his work focus had long shifted to maritime powers in the Guangdong-Fujian region. He knew Liu Xiang's situation clearly. His return to Lingao this time was to propose his own plan for the "final solution" of the Liu Xiang group.

This plan carried certain risks, but the returns were very great. Lin Baiguang believed the success rate could be over ninety percent. Currently, this plan had passed the preliminary approval of the Executive Committee.

After seeing off Lin Baiguang, the secretary came to announce that Wang Ding had arrived.

"Show him in."

Wang Ding went to his office to report in person on the materials obtained from the private investigation into Cheng Yongxin. Generally speaking, there wasn't much juice. Cheng Yongxin was a girl from Taiwan—Jiang Shan had known this for a long time. Although she avoided talking about this issue, and her Mandarin had almost no Taiwanese accent, occasionally her grammar, word choice, and pronunciation of certain common words would reveal her origin—she had studied Ancient Chinese Literature at a certain university in China, having defended her thesis before D-Day and obtained a Master of Arts degree. During school, she moonlighted as a screenwriter, co-writing some not-very-famous TV drama scripts—mainly Qing Dynasty braid dramas and family emotional dramas.

As for why she transmigrated, according to her own description, it was like this:

Before D-Day, she was just a naive university student in the Chinese department harboring literary dreams; when she discovered that critical interpretation of ancient texts had absolutely nothing to do with the American dramas she loved, Cheng Yongxin hung out at the TV station all day with a senior she met in an elective course, taking on some writing jobs from production crews when she had nothing to do.

Before graduation, the senior naturally became her boyfriend, and she became the assistant to a famous screenwriter. Studies, work, and love could be called smooth sailing. Considering she wasn't young anymore after graduating with a master's, and getting married early could settle things down, the wedding with the senior was put on the agenda.

Until she discovered that the senior had copied the script outlines from her hard drive to give to the famous screenwriter who had run out of ideas, and asked for a likable female supporting role for a third-tier actress he was cheating with.

She remained calm but simplified all the wedding plans, cozening the senior into thinking he could enjoy the best of both worlds; then on the day of the banquet, in front of friends, relatives, colleagues, and bosses from both sides, amidst the emcee's blessings, she turned around and sprayed champagne all over the groom, throwing in a slap to the stunned man for good measure.

" Someone tell Director Zhu to hurry up and take his little lover to pick up the adulterer; I, Cheng Yongxin, don't care for this petty thief who only knows how to plagiarize other people's work!"

After such a scene turning in-laws into enemies, Cheng Yongxin naturally felt relieved, but she also had to lie low to avoid the storm; after a backpacking trip to relax and gather material, she finally arrived in Lingao in western Hainan, a place even seasoned backpackers wouldn't bother with.

Of course, she wouldn't have chosen Lingao as her final destination if she hadn't seen Wen Desi's post; but unlike other enthusiastic transmigrators, right up until D-Day, she, like Guo Yi and others who had stumbled in by mistake, thought this was actually a survival cult.

Rather than really believing the other side of the wormhole was the Ming Dynasty, Cheng Yongxin was more interested in how Wen Desi and the others would justify themselves after the D-Day scam went bankrupt—counting as a kind of occupational disease, instinctively curious about dramatic people and things.

"Where did this material come from? How vivid is the credibility?" Jiang Shan found it somewhat incredible after listening to Wang Ding's report.

"It's based on her own narration. She has spoken about her past experiences more than once to people around her. The versions differ slightly, but the gist is roughly the same."

"I think this experience is too dramatic."

"Based on the analysis of collected background materials, combined with her experience as a screenwriter, the possibility that she dramatized her own experience cannot be ruled out." Wang Ding smiled, "It is human nature for people to beautify and gloss over when recounting their own experiences.

"Removing those overly dramatic plot points, I think her real life experience before D-Day should be like this: went to university - participated in TV drama screenwriting work - dated a boyfriend and got cheated on. The motivation for participating in the transmigration should also be genuine."

"Talk about her work and life in the Great Library."

"Generally speaking, not much material. Basically living a reclusive life. Her main work in the Great Library is the translation and polishing of ancient Chinese and ancient vernacular."

Specifically, on the one hand, translating various Ming Dynasty documents and archives into modern Chinese for reference by various departments. On the other hand, "Ming-ifying" various propaganda materials. The Propaganda Department and the Office of Truth concoct various propaganda materials every day, and most of these materials need to be polished and translated into Classical Chinese or ancient vernacular.

These are routine tasks of the Great Library; as long as one wants to do them, they are endless. Cheng Yongxin completed them quite remarkably, with both quality and quantity guaranteed. So Yu Eshui was quite affirmative about her work.

As for her private life, even her colleagues at the Great Library knew very little. Cheng Yongxin's daily life was largely point-to-point; when work was busy, she slept in the dormitory at the Great Library. Occasionally she would go to the Farm Café and Lingao Point Park for recreation—participating in gatherings held by the Feiyun Club, and also attending several assemblies organized by the Women's Federation.

Besides gatherings, she also had a small number of private interactions. She interacted more with female Elders, rarely with male Elders, basically only for work connections. Many Elders in the industrial and military sectors didn't know her at all.

Further investigation into these activities revealed that she did not have close associations with any specific group of people. It should be said that they were all casual acquaintances. She was quite active at gatherings, but rarely revealed ideological tendencies. She also never commented on the Council of Elders' policies or other Elders, seeming to have an attitude of indifference toward politics.

"...Recently she submitted an application to the General Affairs Office to purchase a maidservant. The application has been approved, but she hasn't gone to select one yet."

Apart from that, there was nothing worth mentioning.

From this, it appeared Cheng Yongxin had nothing special about her, living a semi-reclusive life. For the time being, it couldn't be seen that she had any ideas about the political circles of the Council of Elders.

"Let's leave it at this for now. Thank you for your hard work."

"It's a pity we don't have an intelligence network and corresponding relationships in Lingao," Wang Ding said. "Should we go through the Political Security Bureau—"

In the past half year, Wang Ding and Wu Mu had established a good "business cooperation" relationship.

"No, we can't let them know about this. Destroy all the notes you made during the investigation." Jiang Shan let out a breath, "That guy Zhao Manxiong, who knows how much black material on Elders he's compiled in secret. Now he wants to use the opportunity of the purge of overseas stations due to the Hao Yuan case to extend his hand into the security departments of the overseas stations."

"Alright."

Cheng Yongxin got off work relatively early today, leaving the library at five o'clock. After returning to the dormitory, she took a shower first, dabbed on a little jasmine perfume produced by Zichengji, and then boarded the commuter train.

She bought a ticket to the Nanhai Demonstration Farm. After getting off at the station, she called a yellow rickshaw taxi subordinate to the Tiandihui.

"To the Farm Café." She instructed the rickshaw puller.

"Welcome."

The rickshaw soon arrived at the entrance of the café. She got out, and the Spanish doorman Sancho welcomed her with a beaming face:

"Welcome, Madam."

"Thank you." Cheng Yongxin showed her card. "I reserved a private room."

"Yes, please go in." Sancho hastened a few steps forward diligently to open the café door for her.

It was still early; 5:30 was not yet the end of the work day for most Elders, so the first floor of the café was almost empty. She had reserved a small private room on the second floor.

"Give me coconut juice. Is the dinner I ordered ready?" Cheng Yongxin had ordered the limited edition vanilla roasted lamb chop set meal here. Only ten servings a day, said to taste excellent.

"Ready. When shall we serve it?"

"Wait for my word."

"Yes, Chief."

Cheng Yongxin looked at her Swiss watch; there were still five minutes until the agreed time. She picked up the young coconut with a straw inserted, sipping the coconut juice while calculating how to conduct the upcoming conversation.

A few days ago, on official business regarding the publication of pamphlets, she went to the *Lingao Times* office—also the office of the Propaganda Department—to coordinate work, and happened to witness a dispute between Dingding and his wife in the office.

It was precisely this dispute that made her finally make up her mind to put the plan she had been calculating for several years into action.
