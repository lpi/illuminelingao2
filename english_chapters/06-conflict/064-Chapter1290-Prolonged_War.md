# Chapter 1290 Prolonged War

He was now Zheng Sen's counselor, and had to come forward to handle negotiations for many things. It would be much more convenient to handle things with an official skin, and others would not dare to slight him.

"Mr.'s words are reasonable." Zou Weilian stroked his beard and nodded, "It's just that Sir is only a Licentiate. There is no precedent for a Licentiate to enter officialdom in this dynasty."

"Because of the tight border affairs, the Imperial Court recently opened the contribution to the Imperial College again. This student has sent someone to handle it."

The so-called "Contribution to the Imperial College" (Li Jian) meant that after the Tumu Crisis, in order to raise military pay and provisions, the Ming Dynasty ordered Licentiates all over the world to contribute grain or horses to obtain the qualification of an Imperial College Student (Jiansheng), which was equivalent to buying fame with money and grain. The status of such Jiansheng was very low and they were looked down upon in society. However, once becoming an Imperial College Student, there was a possibility of being appointed to an official position according to precedent. Especially in the late Ming Dynasty, various systems tended to be disordered, opening convenient doors for various frauds. Whenever Qian Taichong got the qualification of Jiansheng, as long as Zou Weilian was willing to help, getting a minor official position or a nominal title would not be a problem.

Zou Weilian smiled slightly: "I didn't expect Mr. Qian to be truly thorough in calculation."

Qian Taichong trembled and hurriedly lifted his robe to kneel down: "This student dares not! It's just a little thought of this student, how dare I show off in front of Your Excellency—it is really an expedient measure out of necessity, all for the sake of the Imperial Court and the country, and for the long-term stability of Fujian. I beg Your Excellency to examine clearly!"

"Why go so far, why go so far," Zou Weilian raised his hand, "I understand all your thoughts. As long as you serve the Imperial Court well, you will definitely have a good future." He pondered for a moment and said, "If the Contribution Jiansheng is processed, I will add your name to the Merit List of the Xiamen Great Victory."

"Thank you, Your Excellency, for your fulfillment!"

Qian Taichong returned from Fuzhou in a hurry and gathered the gathered subordinates—including the capable figures among Zheng Zhiguan's former subordinates. He arranged the relevant matters for Zheng Zhilong's funeral one by one. Qian Taichong wanted to hold a grand funeral to declare Zheng Sen's status as the legitimate son of the Zheng family and the head of the Zheng Group.

"This move is very powerful, done beautifully!" Jiang Shan commented in the office after reading the report just sent, "The gang of generals of the Zheng family will go crazy: Not going means they are disloyal, unfilial, benevolent, and unrighteous people; going means admitting that Zheng Sen is the leader of the Zheng Group." He looked up at Wang Ding, the Section Chief of the Analysis Section, "Who is this Qian Taichong beside Zheng Sen?"

"He is a former aid advisor of Shi Bangyao, the Left Administration Vice Commissioner of Guangdong and Intendant of Hainan Circuit. He was captured by us in the Battle of Chengmai and worked as a laborer for more than two years. He was released only this spring." Wang Ding said and took out a paper file, "This is the material I retrieved about him."

"I didn't expect him to be a talent in this area." Jiang Shan flipped through it, "This way, the little matters of the Zheng family will be even more magnificent."

Li Yan coughed: "In case the Zheng family is really reintegrated by him and becomes disadvantageous to us, I think we might as well eliminate him directly."

Jiang Shan didn't care: "It doesn't matter. This drama is only good with someone tossing about. We also want to see how much ability such a schemer has to turn the tide."

Wang Ding said: "Judging from the current situation, even if this Qian Taichong can reintegrate the remnants of the Zheng family, I'm afraid it will be difficult to restore the situation of Zheng Zhilong dominating the Fujian ocean surface in the past."

"That's right," Jiang Shan took out a cigar, struck a match, lit it and took a deep drag, "The colonization and trade departments are planning to launch two commercial campaigns to completely strike at the Zheng family's last vitality."

"Are you referring to the trade monopoly plan against Japan and the Philippines discussed at the Senate Standing Committee meeting not long ago?"

"That's right." Jiang Shan said, "The Zheng family's money didn't fall from the sky. As long as we can cut off these two trade routes, they will be finished—let alone Qian Taichong, even if Zhuge Liang and Liu Bowin were all resurrected and reincarnated as Zheng Sen's strategists, it would be difficult to turn the tide."

The Zheng Group, which lost most of its fleets and a large amount of capital, was now like a severely injured patient who had just recovered from the shock of massive bleeding—even if it recovered, it would need long-term nutritional supplements to gradually recover. The trade war against the Philippines and Japan was to pinch off these two infusion tubes crucial to the survival of the Zheng Group.

"As for the chaos in Zhangzhou Bay, I think Zheng Zhifeng and the Zheng Lian brothers won't submit to Damu (Zheng Sen) so easily. There is still a good drama of dragon and tiger fighting to watch. We just need to watch quietly."

"How to deal with the Zheng family's dependents already transported to Hong Kong?" Wang Ding asked, "There are quite a few family members of important figures among them."

"Regarding this matter, the Executive Committee has already responded and agreed to our proposal of demanding ransom. Send lists to Xiamen and other places, allowing them to redeem people by name." Jiang Shan said, "The Executive Committee also instructed us to formulate a detailed ransom price list based on the name list—to maximize benefits."

"Is it a bit of a pity..."

"Not a pity at all—what use is it for us to keep these people in hand? Send them to work? That would be called waste." Li Yan said with a smile.

"Next, let's discuss the work in Dengzhou."

The cold wind was biting, and snowflakes were fluttering. Lu Wenyuan stood on the tower of the stockade on Qimu Island, tucking in the thick cotton coat on his body. Snowflakes as big as palms fell chaotically, covering the earth in front of him with a thin layer of pink clothes in a while.

The winter of 1632 was very cold. Just entering the tenth lunar month, it had already snowed the first snow in Eastern Jiaodong. Lu Wenyuan knew from the historical meteorological data sent by the Great Library that this year would be a very cold winter—even Lingao would snow heavily.

However, compared with last winter, the most critical time on Qimu Island had passed. Now "Manor Lord Lu" was already a "local tyrant" on the Jiaodong Peninsula. Taking advantage of the rebellion in Dengzhou, the "village braves" under him occupied the Zhaoyuan area, established more than ten stockades, controlled tens of thousands of people, and became a semi-independent force.

Not only did the government treat him with special respect, but even the rebel army dared not provoke him. The troops under the banner of Qimu Island traveled unimpeded in this area.

Manor Lord Lu was also quite proud of his achievements: Except for a brief summer break during the typhoon season in summer, Qimu Island had been taking in and exporting refugees throughout 1632. More than 180,000 refugees were taken in, and more than 100,000 refugees were transported out successively. Many places in the Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong had now become barren land for a thousand li, with few human traces—the common people were either killed or captured by the rebels or fled to Longkou and Zhaoyuan—most of whom had been sent to Hainan, Jeju and Taiwan to become indentured servants under the Senate.

However, this great turmoil in Dengzhou was gradually coming to an end. In the eighth lunar month of the fifth year of Chongzhen, Zhu Dadian led the troops of the Shandong Field Headquarters to defeat the rebels at Shahe, and then pursued all the way to Laizhou. Defeating the elite cavalry led by Kong Youde, Laizhou City was formally relieved.

On the 12th day of the ninth lunar month in the fifth year of Chongzhen, the officers and soldiers of the Shandong Field Headquarters took advantage of the victory to attack Huang County. The officers and soldiers engaged the rebels in Beima Town. The rebels turned out in full force, claiming to have an army of 100,000, including 10,000 cavalry. In the end, the rebels were defeated, with 13,000 killed, 800 captured, and countless falling into the sea and dying. The government army recovered Huang County seat, and Jin Guoqi and others drove straight to Dengzhou, setting up camps outside the west gate.

As a "local gentry", Lu Wenyuan, because of his meritorious service in defending Laizhou and "protecting the territory and comforting the people" within the territory of Huang County, was personally received by Zhu Dadian, Xie Sanbin and Gao Qiqian under the recommendation of Sun Yuanhua and other civil officials and military generals defending the city after the war, promising to reward him according to merit in the merit list.

Lu Wenyuan made a look of gratitude and shed tears, kowtowing to several adults—cursing secretly in his heart. After the official matters were over, he "visited" these adults privately again, giving everyone a heavy gift, especially the one for Zhu Dadian.

Because Dengzhou held fast for eight months, the Imperial Court rewarded and compensated the officials, generals and gentry who had made contributions to defending the city according to precedent. Sun Yuanhua was not rewarded, but was allowed to avoid being stripped of his post and arrested for interrogation, and continued to serve in front of the army with the status of Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou demoted and wearing guilt. Manor Lord Lu obtained the qualification of "entering the Imperial College to study", that is, became a "Jiansheng", equivalent to the fame of Juren. Even Feng Zongze was rewarded with the military rank of "Small Banner".

Now what Zhu Dadian and others were most concerned about was capturing Dengzhou and completely solving the Dengzhou Rebellion. But for Lu Wenyuan, this matter could not end so quickly. Otherwise, if these tens of thousands of government troops wiped out Kong Youde in one vigorous effort, and his tens of thousands of people entrenched in Zhaoyuan and Longkou having men and grain, what if the government troops who won the battle and had a magnificent momentum had any ideas?

A few days ago, Xie Sanbin had sent someone to send a letter, asking him to prepare one thousand shi of grain and three thousand laborers to listen to orders in front of the army.

"Humph, do you think I am a big fat pig offering itself to the butcher?" Lu Wenyuan thought secretly. He immediately asked the messenger to go back and report pleasantly, saying that although he was also very difficult, he dared not be sloppy about serving the Imperial Court at all, only needing a few days to prepare.

Looking at the increasingly dense heavy snow, he thought of the telegram received a few days ago: The Operation Engine Command had agreed to his proposal to prolong the Dengzhou Rebellion: Let the rebels give the government troops another heavy blow. Let the government troops win a tragic victory with his support while in precarious danger—it would be best to lose a few more civil officials and military generals. In this way, from strength to morale, the government army would no longer have any idea of coveting him, and his goal of segregating Zhaoyuan would be achieved.

"With heavy snow flying, grain must be the center of gravity in the army." Lu Wenyuan thought, "As long as the grain is lost, the government troops currently gathered under Dengzhou City will be in chaos without fighting..."

Xie Sanbin was now sitting in Huang County supervising grain. The grain and fodder were transported from Qingzhou, and Yang Jin, the Intendant of Qingzhou Circuit, was responsible for the transshipment, with the defenders of Zhuqiao and Huangshanguan responding in turn. If the rebels could launch a surprise attack and break through Zhuqiao or Huangshanguan, the grain transportation could be interrupted.
