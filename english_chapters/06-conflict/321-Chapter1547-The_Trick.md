# Chapter 1547 - The Trick

"Such hand-copied books are also legal local publications, considered pocket editions—since Lingao Printing Plant doesn't produce extra-small lead type yet—some people exploit this loophole. They make these small hand-copied notebooks, act furtively to attract newcomers unfamiliar with the situation and eager for licenses, then use shills to lure them into the trap.

"Regarding the case itself, the bookstore sells legitimate books at clearly marked prices, with no false labeling. Hand-copied books are naturally more expensive than printed ones, so the pricing isn't an issue. Thus, no law is broken. Furthermore, buying exam answers is an intent to cheat—something one can't speak of openly. Plus the limited value—victims usually just swallow the bitter pill."

"So that's how it is..." Huang Zhen nodded repeatedly.

He quickly added, "Yes, yes, so I'd like to ask the Director for some guidance." He added, "Huang will never forget this kindness."

"Oh my, 'Director,' 'kindness'—too formal. We all serve the Yuan Elder Court." The female director smiled like a flower. Not yet forty, and not from a poor background, her looks and skin were well-preserved, her charm still present. "My name is You Xiu; just call me Xiu'er." As she refilled Huang Zhen's water from a thermos, her full, firm chest inadvertently brushed against his arm.

Huang Zhen felt something elastic and firm press tightly against his arm. His heart skipped a beat. He wasn't a novice; how could he not know "Xiu'er's" intentions? Huang Zhen was in his prime and a widower; to say he had no needs would be a lie. You Xiu was not bad-looking; though she had faint wrinkles at her eyes, the charm of a mature woman had a flavor distinct from a young girl's rawness.

But martial artists strictly avoided lewdness; adultery was a major taboo. Especially in their current situation...

Huang Zhen suppressed the thought. In Ming territory, he would have sternly said, "Sister-in-law You, please have some respect." But here and now, he couldn't say that. He could only play dumb, laughing foolishly and drinking tea, acting like a dullard who didn't understand romance.

You Xiu wasn't annoyed. She spoke polite empty words, telling Huang Zhen to tell everyone to "study hard," then suggesting "maybe get the Grade B diploma first; it's useful later." Huang Zhen grew anxious. The Director spoke official jargon—where was the "guidance"? Seeing his upright gentleman facade spoiling her mood, it seemed she wouldn't reveal the "shortcut" without some benefit.

In the past, why would he, Huang Zhen, need to do this! But the Cropped-Hair territory had different rules than the Ming; his familiar methods didn't work, so he had to resort to this low strategy! The Great Cause came first. He quickly smiled again:

"Sister-in-law You is right. But you know, my people who can treat patients are old; asking them to take exams is difficult. If Sister-in-law has any shortcut, please guide me. Huang would be infinitely grateful..." He shifted slightly closer to her, smiling. "Come, let me toast Sister-in-law You with a cup." He stood up, filled her tea mug, and held it up.

You Xiu smiled even sweeter. "I must drink the tea Shopkeeper Huang toasts." She took the cup, her hand grasping his.

"Shopkeeper Huang is indeed a strong man; your calluses are so tough."

Huang Zhen naturally couldn't pull his hand away. "A life of toil, humble origins—I made Sister-in-law You laugh."

"Why 'Sister-in-law'? Too distant—besides, my late husband wasn't named You."

"Yes, yes." Huang Zhen steeled his heart and changed his address: "Please look after me, Sister You."

"Ah, that's right." You Xiu sipped tea with a smile. "Since Shopkeeper Huang favors me enough to call me Sister You, I must look after my brother." She took a book from the shelf beside the table.

Its cover was like the syllabus he bought: white paper, red text. Huang Zhen had excellent eyesight; the shelf was full of various "regulations"—*Compilation of Policies and Regulations with Usage Instructions*.

She opened a page and laughed. "Shopkeeper Huang, you're too impatient. For the TCM Practitioner License, let alone you who just abandoned the dark for the light from the Ming, even local naturalized citizens with Grade B diplomas study in training classes for six months or a year to pass. The Pharmacist License is easier; an apprentice who has completed their term needs only to read some books to pass."

Huang Zhen knew this was preamble; the important part was coming. He put on a look of attentive listening.

The Director continued, "I heard you say your doctor specializes in bone-setting?"

"Yes, Doctor Jiao is a famous bone-setter in the North..."

"See, in this case, you can have him test for a 'Specialized TCM Practitioner' license, not the general one. There are regulations for this."

The "Specialized TCM Practitioner" was actually a special channel opened by the Ministry of Health for specific TCM talents. The TCM world had many "one-trick pony" doctors mastering a unique technique: acupuncture, trauma, massage, bone-setting; or specializing in difficult cases like skin diseases, snakebites, venereal diseases, etc.

These categories were niche in TCM. Traditional healers already had low status; these "side doors" were even lower—some, like snake doctors, were treated like beggars.

They often had family traditions—father to son, master to disciple—mastering a unique skill and relying on a few proven prescriptions for a living. Often their education was low, TCM theory nonexistent—pure empiricism.

To ask these people to pass the TCM Practitioner License was impossible. But prohibiting them from practicing was a huge waste of talent. At Liu San's proposal, a special channel was opened: no theory exam, just a practical assessment at the hospital. Passing meant receiving a "Specialized License." Naturally, they couldn't touch other subjects outside their specialty.

Someone like Jiao Gongli only needed to take this. Of course, the medicine shop could only perform bone-setting.

*So there's a trick here!* Huang Zhen thought. No wonder everyone said "clerks are slippery as oil"; without her telling him, how would he know this loophole existed?

His suspended heart finally settled. Jiao Gongli couldn't study, but his skills were ready-made. He thanked her repeatedly.

"Why thank me? It's the Yuan Elder Court's good policies." You Xiu stroked Huang Zhen's hand. "I see Shopkeeper Huang has thick knuckles and must be very strong. Why not learn massage? You could get a license too." Her eyebrows raised slightly, eyes flashing. Huang Zhen felt You Xiu's thigh pressing against his knee. Though warm and soft, it made the upright Huang Zhen uncomfortable.

However, this Director You knew the Cropped-Hair situation so well; to infiltrate and establish themselves here, he needed her help. But getting this intimate wasn't right... Huang Zhen rolled his eyes and had an idea. While talking, he reached under the table and pinched You Xiu's thigh hard.

"Ah! Oh..." You Xiu cried out in pain, but immediately suppressed it. The "Oh" trailed off, sounding rather pleasant.

"Dead ghost! So rough!" You Xiu scolded in a low voice, rubbing her leg, but her eyes were silky and incredibly flirtatious.

Huang Zhen whispered, "I thought Sister liked it. Truth be told, Huang loves this..." He pinched her thigh several more times. Intending to scare her off, he used heavy hands.

You Xiu moaned softly, panting, her eyes dripping water. "Yes... harder, this slave... this slave likes it rough..."

Huang Zhen groaned inwardly. He must have bruised her thigh black and blue. Unexpectedly, Director You had heavy tastes; this only stoked her fire.

Running worse, "Sister You's" thigh was warm and elastic; even through layers of clothes, it felt quite good. After a few pinches, he felt a physiological reaction himself.

Seeing You Xiu's eyes glaze over, her body leaning into him, her hand guiding his hand toward her chest, Huang Zhen knew things were bad. If he didn't stop now, who knew what would happen? He quickly said, "Sister You! This is your office!"

You Xiu, burning with desire, felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over her. Her head cleared instantly. People came and went outside; anyone could enter. If seen, it would be a huge scandal!

Thinking of her loss of composure, You Xiu's face turned beet red. She couldn't say a word, only hanging her head.

Huang Zhen thought, *Close call!* He quickly stood up. "Sister You, I'll take my leave..." Ignoring whatever she might say, he left directly.

Back on the street, he felt his whole body relax. He cursed the corrupt morals of this place—no wonder False Cropped-Hair women liked wearing those shameless clothes!

But somehow, Huang Zhen felt a twinge of regret: That You Xiu was truly a "stunning creature"...

Though suspected of sacrificing his looks, he had advanced his relationship with the female director, which benefited his future infiltration in Nanbao. He just had to manage the "degree."

Back at the shop, he told everyone about the "Specialized TCM Practitioner" exam. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief; the gloomy atmosphere vanished. Jiao Gongli aside, even Song Shengying, who had wanted to quit, wanted to try—he had some skill in massage and trauma.
