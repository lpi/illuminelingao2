# Chapter 1394 - Spy

Xihua was carried back to her quarters by several servant women. She lay on the bed, feeling dizzy and groggy. Originally from a scholar's family with considerable wealth, unexpectedly after a plague her parents and brothers died one after another. Clansmen swallowed her family property and plotted to sell her to a brothel, almost forcing her to commit suicide.

Although her background was miserable and she suffered mental torture, she hadn't suffered much physical hardship. Growing up as a delicate daughter of a humble family, where had she suffered such pain. Laying groggy until sky turned completely dark did she wake up, only feeling burning stinging pain in buttocks and legs, like needles pricking upon slight movement.

Room was pitch black, lamp not yet lit, didn't know what time it was. She struggled to lie on side, feeling dry thirst in throat, propped up body to touch low cabinet at head of bed—empty nothing.

She was usually a "red person" in Villa, not only having status close to "student" before Zhao Yingong, but also a figure in Cihui Hall, managing children's reading. Originally a "real power faction" figure everyone in Villa feared somewhat. Plus her personality unyielding, arrogant, tolerating no sand in eyes, often embarrassing people. So although usually doing many good deeds for masses, popularity in Villa was average. This time beaten, many people were happy, few felt pained. Where would anyone come to visit, let alone serving tea and water.

Moonlight outside window was bright, shining on square brick floor before window white flickering. Xihua's nose soured, couldn't help shedding tears. Fumbled handkerchief from under pillow to wipe tears. Suddenly door sounded, opened gently. Then Fenghua stuck head in to look, made a "hush" gesture to Xihua, then walked in lightly. First pulled curtain on window, then took out a box of matches from pocket, struck to light candle stand on table.

"Sister Fenghua!"

"Shh..." Fenghua pressed finger on lips, put a carrying basket in hand on table, took out several porcelain bottles from inside, "You lie prone don't move, I apply medicine for you."

"Thank you sister." Xihua dared not say much, fearing letting out voice, only buried face in pillow, tears flowing down in clusters. She had much contact with Fenghua usually, but little personal friendship. Fenghua had most ordinary appearance among Zhao Yingong's "side users," but was naturalized citizen from Lingao, and oldest in age, one of people Zhao Yingong trusted most. Xihua was always resentful that this girl with average looks and learning could get Master's trust so much, thus having lukewarm attitude towards Fenghua. Plus Fenghua was generous, having high popularity and prestige in Villa, making Xihua who always thought highly of herself gradually distance from her.

Unexpectedly she would come to look after her. Heart felt warm involuntarily, also slightly ashamed.

Fenghua applied medicine, then poured a bowl of medicine juice from thermos in basket to feed her drink. Medicine juice slightly bitter, not hard to drink. After drinking body originally hot instantly felt cool, even stinging pain in thighs reduced much.

"This is medicine bought from Lingao, Master specially ordered me to bring for you." Fenghua whispered.

"Mmm..."

Fenghua covered her body well with quilt, walked gently to door, opened door and beckoned. A figure flashed in. Seeing appearance seemed to be a man, Xihua almost screamed. Suddenly discovered comer was actually Zhao Yingong!

"Master—"

Zhao Yingong nodded. Fenghua already moved a stool over. Zhao Yingong sat down before bed.

"I come to see you. Don't move, you just lie. Beaten painful right?" Zhao Yingong seeing her wanting to straighten body, held her arm with one hand.

What clever person Xihua was. Master visiting her quarters at night, personally coming to see, knew today's outburst must have cause. However she was angry that she clearly "pleaded for people," and Master also said to her "education is foundation," "teaching and educating people is century plan," yet punished publicly for this—physical pain could be endured, but humiliation suffered was hard to let go.

Mood being so, speech naturally lacked tenderness: "Master beating servant is heavenly principle and earthly righteousness, even beating to death is deserved. Servant dares not modify pain, all servant deserved crime!"

Fenghua was about to scold. Zhao Yingong shook head, said: "Today's matter was originally making example of you. You are such clever person, surely wouldn't not understand."

"Yes, servant understands." Xihua whispered.

"Matter of silk factory workers you mentioned, I already told Steward Office: Changing to three shift operation from tomorrow, resting once every shichen. Besides, working meal standard also increased."

"..." Xihua widened eyes, didn't know what Master meant. She always felt Master treated contract slaves in factory too cruelly, sooner or later people would die in factory. That was why she stood out to argue in excitement. Unexpectedly Master accepted all at once.

"Humans aren't grass or wood, how can be ruthless? How would I not know filature is comparable to hell?" Zhao Yingong smiled slightly, then covered smile, "Easy for people to have small benevolence small righteousness, hard to have great benevolence great righteousness. Rare that you bear it!"

Such evaluation, even usually arrogant Xihua dared not accept: "Master speaks heavily, servant cannot bear."

"How cannot bear?" Zhao Yingong spoke frankly with assurance, "You yourself do upper class job in Villa, taking first portion money and grain. Master I trust you use you, you differ having face among servants. In filature no half relative or old friend—all people unrelated to you. Able to risk stepping forward speaking out justice for their joys and sorrows, how is it not great benevolence great righteousness?"

These words hit Xihua's heart directly. Actually she didn't think so much when standing out, just momentary indignation. Now pointed out by Zhao Yingong, feelings originally somewhat fuzzy all became clear and understood. For a moment only felt five flavors mixed in heart, lying on pillow crying loudly.

Fenghua hurriedly came up to comfort and persuade. Took quite a while to stop her tears.

"All servant's fault..." Xihua with teary eyes wanted to get up again.

Zhao Yingong stopped her: "No need to admit fault. You aren't wrong. Matter of filature was originally expedient measure." He smiled again, "Besides if not for your disturbance today, how to win trust from others?"

Xihua was somewhat confused. Hearing him speak till here, heart became clear like snow cave, asked: "Master wants servant to be Huang Gai?"

"Clever! This matter I originally wanted to tell you first, avoiding your internal uneasiness. But if you feel good inside, this play won't look real."

"Servant understands. What does Master want servant to do?"

Zhao Yingong's face became serious:

"You two are my confidant people, telling you now is no harm: Someone is plotting in secret, wanting to destroy Phoenix Mountain Villa."

This word had smaller impact on Fenghua—she was after all naturalized citizen stayed in Lingao, knowing Council of Elders' deep strength, also knowing coming to Hangzhou with "Chief" was deep into enemy territory.

Since in enemy territory, falling into life and death contest anytime. But for Xihua it was different. Her feeling for Phoenix Mountain Villa was deep—originally a girl about to fall into dusty world, came under Zhao Yingong's hand, not only turned over herself, but also saw with own eyes Master growing Hangzhou industry little by little from Wanbi Bookshop to such scale. Especially running Cihui Hall, saving how many common people originally about to become starved corpses from last year to this year, she handling general affairs in Cihui Hall knew most clearly.

For people like Xihua, Phoenix Mountain Villa was almost like her home. Hearing someone wanted to destroy here, couldn't help widening eyes, asked urgently:

"Master! What people so vicious?"

"Currently I still don't know, so want you to find them out. Are you willing?" He paused, "Your going this time is entering tiger's den deep, afraid nine deaths one life. If unwilling to go, I absolutely won't blame you."

"Servant willing!" Xihua said without hesitation, "Master tell servant what to do."

"Good." Zhao Yingong felt satisfied deep inside, finally didn't view her wrong, "You stay calm. This Villa afraid already infiltrated by spy long ago. You suffered family law today, naturally someone will come to seduce you. You just follow nature."

"Yes! Servant knows." Xihua responded, "If no one comes?"

"Rest assured, definitely someone will come." Zhao Yingong smiled, "This matter in Villa only Fenghua and Zhao Tong know. You just contact Fenghua if anything, matters later she will tell you."

"So saying, her popularity in Villa usually is average?" Hao Yuan put down Gou Chengxuan's handwritten investigation material in book.

"Correct. Inside lines say, this Xihua usually thinks higly of herself, temper also violent. Big and small stewards in Villa, as long as not fitting her way, will be embarrassed by her on spot. Not few people hate her. But this person does things meticulously, everything following rules in Villa, letting people catch no handle. So even more annoying people."

"Oh?" Hao Yuan pondered slightly, "You talked about stewards. I asked about ordinary people, like refugees, slaves and female workers."

"She usually doesn't interact with them much. People below feel her nature arrogant. But doing things fairly, willing to think for people below, also willing to speak for people, having quite some prestige." Gou Chengxuan said, "This time beaten by Zhao Baldy family law was for standing out for filature female workers. According to inside line, this matter doesn't look like fake—matter of filature, she said many days ago to report to Zhao Baldy."

"Seems this woman really has some chivalrous heart." Hao Yuan didn't comment on whether fake or not. He looked up at low ceiling for half a while, asked again, "Anyone visited her afterwards? How did Zhao Yingong dispose of her subsequently?"

"Heard Fenghua visited, also sent stick sore medicine—this is also proper meaning. Zhao Baldy has no new punishment either. News from Steward Office only said letting her rest for a few days."

Hao Yuan nodded: "You listen, we do this next..."
