# Chapter 1457 - Hidden Agendas (Part 7)

"What legal issues?"

*Damn*, Wu Nanhai thought. *My attempt at profound questioning has aroused his suspicion. This won't do—I should be guiding him through casual conversation instead.*

He immediately resumed the peaceful, magnanimous smile he typically wore at Agricultural Committee and Senate meetings. "What I mean is, although this case doesn't directly involve a transmigrator, it does concern a naturalized citizen with the closest possible ties to one. The legal significance shouldn't be underestimated."

Ji Xin said nothing. Just days ago, he had attended a Jurisprudence Society meeting where the main topic had been the Yang Jihong trial—professional discussions covering litigation procedure, applicable law, conviction, and sentencing. Yet he had offered few opinions. In his view, the Yang Jihong case touched upon deeper issues than the mere mechanics of how to conduct a trial.

Seeing that Ji Xin's expression remained open rather than guarded, Wu Nanhai pressed on:

"You know, I don't really understand legal matters. But Yang Xinwu—I don't know if you're familiar with him—ever since the Yang Jihong affair began, he's been haunting my establishment every day, drowning his sorrows in drink. A young man who used to be positive and cheerful has become utterly despondent. Out of comradely friendship and a sense of responsibility toward my customers, I'm frankly concerned..." He paused for effect. "Yang Jihong's case, no matter how you examine it, deserves sympathy. She's a lonely, desolate girl who came here as a maidservant—to put it bluntly, serving with her body. That's already pitiful enough. Now she's pregnant with Transmigrator Yang's child and has become a suspect in custody. Though she's only a naturalized citizen, two lives hang in the balance. From any angle, we should demonstrate humanitarian spirit. Personally, I feel we could show her some leniency."

The words were sincere and moving. Combined with Old Wu's benevolent, kind-hearted countenance, they were quite persuasive.

Yet Ji Xin's expression turned peculiar. Wu Nanhai sensed something was off, but the words were already spoken—he couldn't take them back. He had no choice but to continue along his original trajectory:

"You see, at its core, this matter still concerns native identity and rights. As long as sufficient legal assistance can be provided, I believe that—"

Ji Xin nodded and cut him off: "Are you suggesting I serve as Yang Jihong's defense attorney?"

For a moment, Wu Nanhai felt a flush of embarrassment. But since his purpose had been seen through, further pretense was useless. He could only nod. "That's right." As if to justify his suggestion, he added: "Although she's a native naturalized citizen, two lives are ultimately at stake—including a transmigrator's bloodline. If she truly falls into Fu Youdi's hands..." He shook his head. "I can hardly imagine it. Even I can't bear the thought."

"She won't end up with Fu Youdi," Ji Xin replied. "But the maidservant system itself is reactionary and inhumane. I strongly disapprove of it."

"Exactly—I also disapprove of this return to slavery. That's why I hope you can use your legal knowledge to save her." Wu Nanhai raised his teacup. "'Same sky, same face.'"

This lyric from the old era had become Ji Xin's slogan for the Native Rights Protection Association. Hearing it, Ji Xin fell silent for a long while before finally speaking:

"This is my duty. Since I established this association—even if it's just my one-man operation—I must see it through and practice what I preach. However, recent developments have made me feel the case is somewhat complicated..." He pondered for a moment. "You're the third person in recent days to make this suggestion."

Now it was Wu Nanhai's turn to show surprise. He couldn't help asking: "Who else?"

"Transmigrator Yang himself, for one." Ji Xin seemed thoughtful. "And the other is a female transmigrator I'm not familiar with."

"A female transmigrator?!"

"Yes," Ji Xin tilted his head back and scratched his chin. "I can't recall her name... surnamed Cheng, I think."

"Cheng Yongxin?"

"That's the one." Ji Xin nodded. "She also came to discuss this matter with me, spoke about protecting native women's rights—she seemed like someone with ideas. If she hadn't explained herself, I would have thought she was sent by the Queen."

"Oh," Wu Nanhai said noncommittally, his mind racing. *What is she doing getting involved?* He realized something was afoot. Last time, when Xiao Zishan had specifically called to ask which transmigrators had spoken with Yang Xinwu, he had spotted Cheng Yongxin's name in the teahouse's hospitality and consumption records. Moreover, the waitresses had mentioned seeing her enter Yang Xinwu's private room. Transmigrator Yang had even specially ordered extra coffee.

Wu Nanhai was beginning to regret getting involved in this matter. But having come this far, retreat was impossible. He said half-jokingly:

"I'm just someone who loves meddling in others' affairs. I can't stand seeing comrades in low spirits—it affects my business. Besides, I'm about to become a father. An expectant dad can't bear to see children suffer. Never mind that Yang Jihong's child carries transmigrator blood; even if it didn't, for the sake of the unborn child, we should try to help her."

---

"But this case is indeed a headache. I've reviewed the materials—the facts are clear, the evidence sufficient. A not-guilty defense would be difficult. I can probably only work from the 'humanitarian' angle."

Wu Nanhai had originally thought he possessed a "rare commodity" that could resolve this case, but given the current situation, he decided not to reveal it just yet, lest Ji Xin grow suspicious of his excessive enthusiasm.

"I'll leave that to your efforts then. What did we all come to this era for? Isn't it to enjoy the taste of being on top? Popova's case is a matter of face for Transmigrator Yang, and also a matter of face for the many soy sauce transmigrators. Please ask the legal people to handle it well."

"I'll do my best."

After seeing Ji Xin off, Wu Nanhai quietly returned to the "accounting room"—the teahouse's manager's office. As the establishment had grown in scale, Chuqing rarely greeted customers at the front anymore. She now worked primarily behind the scenes, overseeing everything. She had specifically taught herself basic commercial accounting and now personally managed all the teahouse's accounts and operations.

Though he didn't know what scheme Cheng Yongxin was pursuing, after the Administrative Office inquiry last time, he had begun paying attention to this mysterious woman, asking Chuqing and the waitresses to keep close watch on her movements.

"Husband, what's wrong? Is something the matter?" Chuqing asked with concern, seeing his expression fluctuating as he entered.

"Nothing." Wu Nanhai shook his head. "Are you busy right now?"

"Not busy. Those two girls are very clever—I've already taught them the teahouse's bookkeeping method. It's made things much easier for me..."

Business was exceptionally good—so good that the loan from Delong had been repaid in full two-thirds ahead of schedule. With operations flourishing, the "accounting room" had been upgraded to "manager's office." Because Chuqing had been discovered to be pregnant three months ago, she and Wu Nanhai had discussed buying two maidservant trainees with good accounting scores from the maidservant school to handle the teahouse's financial bookkeeping and administrative work.

Wu Nanhai had originally wanted to promote from among the senior waitresses, but Chuqing thought otherwise. Since the waitresses were now naturalized citizens whose indentures had been lifted, she didn't trust them. She insisted on buying trainees from the maidservant school who still carried death-contracts.

Wu Nanhai felt this wasn't quite right, but Chuqing was adamant: "This way I can feel at ease. It's convenient for me to teach and discipline them. Otherwise, I can't beat them, can't scold them—they're hard to manage. Besides, if they do well in the future, we can lift their indentures then. If they don't, we can demote them to waitresses. Carrot and stick together—that's how to keep them in line."

Wu Nanhai couldn't out-argue his wife and reluctantly agreed.

"Do something for me. Quietly." Wu Nanhai lowered his voice and instructed Chuqing to compile all consumption records related to Cheng Yongxin since the Yang case began.

"...Which days she came, how long she stayed, what she consumed, which table she sat at, which people shared a table or private room with her—compile it all separately for me. Do it yourself."

"Yes, husband." Chuqing was puzzled, but she never asked questions about affairs between transmigrators.

The teahouse's account books were extremely complex, all stored in a locked small room inside the accounting office. Only Wu Nanhai and Chuqing had keys. In one row of black-lacquered filing cabinets, transmigrator visit and consumption records were organized by date. Using card indexes, one could easily locate each transmigrator's consumption records, including what they ordered, amounts spent, seat or room numbers, and even which naturalized citizens had accompanied them.

The ledgers didn't include conversation contents—that would absolutely cross the line. Wu Nanhai wasn't so blinded by greed as to go that far. But merely knowing who had sat at the same table with whom, who had shared the same private room, was enough to infer a great deal.

The materials Chuqing compiled arrived on his desk the next day. Wu Nanhai examined her consumption records and was startled. According to the records, Cheng Yongxin had come to the teahouse almost every day recently, frequently meeting with various people. Just among those obviously connected to the Yang Jihong case, there were Mu Min, Salina, Su Wan, and Yang Xinwu, plus Panpan and several others.

Wu Nanhai sketched on white paper with a pencil: Mu Min, Salina, and Su Wan were all members of the National Police and directly handled the case. Panpan was from the Propaganda and Literature Department. The common thread among these four was that they were all women.

Three women make a drama; now add Cheng Yongxin and Mu Min—five women, all transmigrators, gathering together. What were they up to? Wu Nanhai hesitated for a long while, then took out his PHS from a locked drawer and dialed a number:

"Director Xiao? This is Nanhai. There's something I'd like to report to you—"
