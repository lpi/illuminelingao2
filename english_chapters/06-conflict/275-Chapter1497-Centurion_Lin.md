# Chapter 1497 - Centurion Lin

Liu Deshan had sold every last crate of raw sugar from the *Dongshan Residence* at prices that left him eminently satisfied—holding back only the refined goods. The *Hong Kong Ship-Head Paper* listed coarse sugar prices in Jiangnan lower than what Dayuan offered, but refined sugar fetched far better returns there.

Since they had sailed all the way to Dayuan, departing empty-handed was out of the question. An empty hold was wasted money. Their next destination was Shanghai, and the gentry of Jiangnan still possessed an insatiable appetite for overseas luxuries. Liu Deshan procured American furs, fine European woolens, Indian printed cottons, and spices from the East Indies, then supplemented these with various Western curiosities that the literati so coveted—filling the hold until it could take no more. He had originally intended to purchase deerskins as well, but was informed that every last hide and deer product had been sold to the Australians. Dayuan's stock was completely depleted.

"Cousin, perhaps we should make another voyage to Kaohsiung? We could stock up on Australian sundries. They sell remarkably well in Jiangnan..."

"Huamin, there's something you don't quite grasp. Shanghai has large emporiums dealing in Australian goods, and they've recently been well-stocked, which drives down prices. If we bring goods there now, the margins will be thin. If we had substantial empty cargo space, bringing a large shipment would still be better than nothing." Liu Deshan elaborated, "Besides, the Australian goods in Kaohsiung are primarily exported wares. We can stop there on our return voyage from Shanghai and bring them back to Guangzhou for Master Qin."

Thus they elected to bypass Kaohsiung and sail directly for Shanghai. Having loaded fresh water in Kaohsiung and settled all outstanding expenses, they were preparing to weigh anchor when Manager Liu suddenly appeared with news: someone wished to take passage to Lingao to find work.

"Did you not inform him that our next port of call is Shanghai? After that, we're bound for Shandong, and only then Lingao."

"He said that was perfectly fine—he has no money and is willing to work for his passage."

"Oh? How did he come to know our ship is bound for Lingao?" Chen Huamin found this somewhat puzzling, for their voyage was indeed destined for Lingao. He and Liu Deshan had already agreed that after returning to Guangzhou, they would visit Lingao to assess the "situation" and scout for promising new trade goods.

"That's hardly a secret," Manager Liu said. "He told me himself that a single glance at this ship reveals it to be an Australian vessel, and Australian vessels are invariably bound for Lingao."

"A discerning fellow," Chen Huamin laughed. "But we're not Australians, and this isn't an Australian ship. He only got right the part about going to Lingao."

Liu Deshan asked, "What sort of man is he?"

"Early thirties, and his manner and speech suggest an educated background. I detected a Cantonese accent in his speech, and when I exchanged a few words in Cantonese, it was clear he's a native of Guangdong."

"A scholar—can he actually work?"

"His build appears sturdy enough, not one of those frail bookish types." Manager Liu continued, "He doesn't strike me as a villain—more like the dissolute scion of a once-wealthy family."

"Can such a man truly pull his weight?"

"He came to Kaohsiung as a deck hand, then onward to Dayuan. That captain is someone I know—an old acquaintance from Guangzhou. He vouched that this man boarded in Guangzhou and proved himself honest and capable." Manager Liu pressed on, "We're already short-handed as it is. Adding someone who can read and reckon wouldn't hurt, especially when he's asking for no wages."

"Fine, bring him along." Liu Deshan was always most persuaded by the words "no wages required," and he made his decision on the spot.

"My infinite thanks to the two masters for this great kindness!" Lin Ming kowtowed with practiced ease. "I shall work diligently and repay your beneficence!"

"No need for kowtowing. I hear from Manager Liu that you're literate—a civilized man. We'll address each other as equals."

"That—I dare not presume. The two masters are the owners; how could I violate proper decorum?"

"Come now, the ship is cramped, and we don't stand on ceremony here. Since you're literate, can you work an abacus?"

"Yes, yes."

"Then work under Manager Liu." Chen Huamin observed that the man's bearing and manner of speech indicated at least a middle-class educated background, yet he stood before them in rags, willing to labor aboard the ship in such a subservient fashion. He could not help but feel a pang of sympathy and instructed someone to fetch a fresh set of short garments. "Long robes aren't practical for work aboard ship, so make do with these for now."

"Yes, many thanks, Master."

Lin Ming bowed and hurried after Manager Liu into the hold. The old manager had someone bring him a brand-new set of blue cotton trousers and jacket. "Young fellow, you'll sleep in this cabin tonight and keep this old man company with conversation and chess. For now, change your clothes and come help me take inventory in the cargo hold."

Lin Ming kept smiling and agreeing to everything. This was his do-or-die gamble.

Ever since his sister-in-law had vanished in Macau three years prior, he had expended tremendous effort—mobilizing nearly every connection he possessed in Guangdong—in a desperate campaign to rescue Li Yongxun.

But Lingao had become an iron fortress of the Cropped-Hair Pirates, and the Australians' methods bore no resemblance to those of the Ming. Lin Ming's network proved almost entirely useless; the place was impenetrable. Most people, upon learning the matter involved the Cropped-Hairs, avoided it like the plague, no matter how "capable" they claimed to be. Since the Australians had burned down the Five Rams Courier Station, their influence in and around Guangzhou had swelled with each passing day. Nobody wished to oppose the Australians over a mere Brocade Guard centurion. Lin Ming had expended great effort and amassed considerable intelligence on the Cropped-Hairs, yet regarding his sister-in-law's actual whereabouts—there was still no word.

These past few years, he had eaten without tasting, lived in dull misery. His wife gave him no pleasant looks—understandably so, given that she had lost her maternal relative's child under his watch. It was already quite courteous of her family not to storm over and make a scene. Fortunately, Li Yongxun had run away from home to Guangdong on her own initiative, so the main responsibility did not fall squarely on him. Otherwise, Lin Ming would truly have considered throwing himself into the sea.

Li Yongxun had vanished on his watch, and he had to bear that burden. After years of fruitless inquiries, Lin Ming finally steeled his resolve: *If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cub?* Since the Cropped-Hairs' lair was in Lingao, his sister-in-law was almost certainly there as well. He would have to go in person—infiltrate the Australians' ranks and discover Li Yongxun's fate. Dead or alive, he owed his wife an answer.

Li Yongxun was merely a child; the Cropped-Hairs probably would not kill her. But having fallen into their hands, her fate was all too predictable. Whenever he dwelt on this, Lin Ming would sigh with regret—that delicate flower, plucked by the Cropped-Hairs. If only he had taken the initiative first... Should he actually manage to rescue her, the girl would no longer be pure, and there would be no prospect of finding her a proper husband. He might as well take her into his own household to keep his wife company...

Naturally, Lin Ming could not share these ruminations with his wife, but she strongly endorsed his plan to travel to Lingao and rescue Li Yongxun. Because of this affair, she had not even dared return to Nanjing to visit her family. Every letter from her maternal home inquired after Qianqian's whereabouts, leaving her at a complete loss for words.

"Better a sharp pain than a dull ache. Instead of floundering about asking everyone for scraps of news, it's more proper to go yourself!" Madam Lin was also from a Brocade Guard military family and supremely practical. "If you can find her whereabouts, there will always be a means to rescue her. And if her fate is truly bitter, at least we'll have closure. At worst, we'll fulfill her filial duties to her parents on her behalf!"

"What you say is right—" Lin Ming nodded repeatedly.

"But you must take care of yourself. I hear the Cropped-Hairs have their own Depot as well..."

"The Song called it the Palace Interior Bureau..."

"Whatever they call it, I hear the Cropped-Hairs are adept at such things—eyes and ears everywhere, scrutinizing every word and deed. My husband, you must be ever vigilant."

"I understand. Wife, rest assured."

"How can I rest assured?" Tears rolled down Madam Lin's cheeks. "I've already lost a sister; don't you lose yourself too! This whole family—young and old—depends on you!"

"Rest assured. I know what's at stake."

His household boasted "Five Blessings Surrounding Longevity"—and while Madam Lin was "understanding of righteousness," the four concubines were decidedly less pleased. After all, Li Yongxun's life or death had little to do with them, and they were by no means willing to see their husband risk his life. There was some inevitable weeping and fussing, but fortunately Madam Lin governed the household with method and authority. Between stern admonishment and gentle persuasion, she managed to bring them all around.

With household affairs settled, Lin Ming had to consider how to reach Lingao.

Getting to Lingao from Foshan was simplicity itself. From Foshan to Guangzhou, one need only go to the Dabao Shipping agency at Tianzi Wharf, purchase a ticket, and within two or three days at most, board a ship to Lingao. For those with money, there were tidy passenger cabins; for those without, the steerage on cargo ships was still reasonably clean.

But Lin Ming did not intend to travel to Lingao that way. He had already made inquiries among those who had been there—all outsiders entering or leaving Lingao were subjected to rigorous interrogation. He himself was an expert in apprehension, and aside from knowing too many people in Guangzhou, his appearance—neither merchant nor scholar—would immediately attract the attention of the Cropped-Hairs' Depot agents the moment he appeared at Bopu Wharf.

To work as an agent, one first had to keep a low profile and blend seamlessly with ordinary folk so as not to draw attention. But having been a Brocade Guard for more than twenty years, his manner and speech carried an unmistakable "official air"—he would betray himself without uttering a word. After much deliberation, Lin Ming settled on a roundabout approach. Specifically, he would not depart from Guangzhou but set out from somewhere else entirely.

He decided to travel first to Kaohsiung—a newly opened Australian territory overseas. He had heard it was a place where all peoples mingled freely; he could easily conceal his identity there, then take a ship from Kaohsiung to Lingao. This way, not only could he obscure his trail, but he could also investigate the Cropped-Hairs' operations in Kaohsiung along the way. Since the Cropped-Hairs had defeated Zheng Zhilong and swept Zhangzhou Bay, interest in this force had grown immensely—at court and among commoners alike. Lin Ming estimated that within three to five years, the court would inevitably clash with the Cropped-Hairs in another great battle. The intelligence he gathered would be precisely the thing for advancement and fortune.

His plans set, Lin Ming committed himself completely. Disguised as a destitute scholar, carrying only a modest sum of silver, he slipped quietly into Guangzhou alone and boarded a merchant ship bound for Kaohsiung as a hand, specifically handling accounts and paperwork. He worked diligently aboard, and despite constant seasickness—and despite not being a true deck hand—he threw his heart and soul into helping with whatever was needed. He earned the captain's high regard.
