# Chapter 1235 - Business

The moment he landed, several people came to greet him, their manner very respectful. But no one spoke. The burly man also maintained his silence. Only when someone came forward with bowed head and said a few words did he nod.

With someone leading the way, the burly man and his entourage walked along a path cut through the dense jungle. After about half a *li*, he stopped. Before him was a crude stockade, no different from those of indigenous peoples living in similar environments worldwide. What set this stockade apart were the many wooden poles planted along its perimeter, each topped with a dried human head.

The burly man was unfazed by the gruesome sight. At the stockade gate, many fully-armed men stood guard. Though ragged in appearance, their solid builds and fine weapons showed they were no ordinary fishermen.

The party was led into the stockade. The ground inside was stained with blood—clearly the "indigenous" residents had already been "cleared out," leaving the place for its new masters.

In the open space before a large thatched hut, a fire burned in a fire pit. A young man sat in a folding chair, holding a skewer of roasted fish and eating heartily. Seeing the burly man arrive, he smiled and pointed to another folding chair by the fire pit—indicating "have a seat."

"Hello, Mr. Paul," the young man said in Japanese, with the casual air of being in his own home. He leaned back in his chair. "It seems you had fair winds all the way."

"Everything went smoothly," the burly man answered in a low voice, also in Japanese. "When will my payment be honored?"

"Hey!" the young man exclaimed in mock surprise. "You really are a cold person—no feelings, only business! You're also a devout Christian—can't we be like brothers before our common faith?"

"Devout Christians don't both attend Mass and make offerings and burn incense to idols," the man called Mr. Paul said disdainfully. "I've done everything you asked of me. Now you need to give me my agreed payment."

"You're a straightforward fellow—say what you mean without fuss!" The young man concealed his displeasure. "Let's talk business! Besides payment, I have several important matters to discuss with you!"

"Give me my payment first." Mr. Paul was unequivocal. His eyes were nearly gray—cold and steady.

The young man signaled to an attendant. Someone immediately brought a chest. It was packed full of Spanish pesos.

"This is the agreed payment."

Paul reached into the chest, scooped out a few coins from the bottom, examined them carefully, then tossed them back and nodded. Someone immediately came forward, closed the lid, and took the chest away.

"The ship I'll hand over to you. As for sailors to man it and how to use the guns on board—I'll train the men you select."

The young man said: "Now let's discuss the second matter. You said you can manufacture cannons no less than the Australians'."

"Yes." Paul nodded. "As long as you can pay. And have patience to wait."

"I have money, but patience is in short supply."

"Then you'll need more money."

"You really are a fine merchant, not at all like a pirate!" The young man laughed.

"Being a pirate is also a business. And a good business at that. Put it this way, Mr. Feng—as long as the price is right, anything is negotiable."

"You're quite a character." The one called Mr. Feng was none other than Zheng Zhilong's brother, Zheng Zhifeng. After the failed operation to set the Dutch and Australians against each other, they'd lost not only a large sum of money, but their relationship with the Dutch had noticeably deteriorated. The Dutch seemed convinced they were the masterminds.

The Zheng brothers had racked their brains but couldn't understand what magic the Australians had used to convince the Dutch they were the true perpetrators. Deducing they'd used trickery wasn't hard—what was difficult was understanding how they'd found leads and evidence in what seemed "seamless, ironclad" conditions.

However, both Australians and Dutch seemed unwilling to publicize the matter. Trade relations among the three parties continued as before. Dutch and Australian ships still entered and left Zhongzuo according to trade agreements. The Zheng brothers could easily figure out that the Australians' silence was certainly not meekness—they must be secretly plotting revenge against the Zheng family.

Now the Zhengs were competing with Liu Xiang for control of Fujian's coastal foreign trade. To simultaneously prepare for war against an enemy even more fierce and dangerous than Liu Xiang was more than they could bear.

The rise of the Australians in the Taiwan Strait these past few years had been plain for all to see. Their huge sailing ships, those black fast ships belching smoke and able to sail against wind and current—all weighed on them like stones.

Though the Australians had temporarily shown no ambition for overseas trade, content to trade with Europeans along the coast, maintaining such a vast fleet surely couldn't be just for showing off in the Taiwan Strait.

The day would come when they'd fight the Australians to the death for maritime hegemony. Zheng Zhilong never doubted this.

The longer they waited, the worse for them. Australian power grew every moment. Guo Huaiyi's reports mentioned the town they'd built at Takao. The refugees they'd sent there—the results exceeded everything they'd achieved in years of colonization since the Yan Siqi era.

Though his fleet had numerical advantage, the intelligence compiled from various sources—especially from Li Siya—gave Zheng Zhilong a quite sober assessment of Australian power. In a head-to-head fight, his vast "fleet" would be crushed. Back when a few Dutch armed merchantmen had suppressed his superior fleet in naval combat. If not for the Dutch being outnumbered, and his later success in launching fire attacks in an advantageous bay, he wouldn't have beaten the Dutch.

Zheng Zhilong understood better than anyone the superiority of European naval power along China's coast—let alone the Australians, who had faster ships and more powerful cannons than the Dutch or Spanish.

To win, he'd have to catch them by surprise. Launch a surprise attack, trap the Australian fleet in the harbor, and attack with fire ships as they'd once done to the Dutch.

But the Australians' advantage in ships and guns was too great. This remained the Zheng brothers' constant nightmare.

Fortunately, at this time, ships returning from Manila brought news. A Japanese Kirishitan had arrived in Manila, seemingly mastering many magical arts and producing many novel firearms. The Spanish, equipped with weapons he'd designed and manufactured, had won many victories over the natives. This Kirishitan had thereby gained the Governor's trust.

This news and the firearms he'd created made Zheng Zhilong keenly sense something. He immediately dispatched Zheng Zhifeng to Manila to find this Kirishitan.

The Zheng family's relationship with the Spanish wasn't particularly warm, but wasn't hostile either. The Spanish colonial government was highly dependent on the southern seas routes controlled by the Zhengs, so Zheng Zhifeng's request was quickly granted—he met this legendary Kirishitan: Paul Takayama. In subsequent secret talks, the two sides reached their first cooperation agreement.

During these talks, Zheng Zhifeng sensed that Mr. Paul had an intense interest in the Australians, and knew far more about them than the Zhengs did. But he seemed to be hiding something, his evasive eyes unwilling to speak the full truth.

Mr. Paul readily agreed to help them deal with the Australians.

"As long as Mr. Feng pays the price, anything is negotiable."

The Zhengs certainly had money. But as for specifically how to effectively counter the Australians, none of the Zheng brothers had a clear plan. It was Mr. Paul who proposed that since they so feared Australian ships and guns, why not first capture an Australian vessel—to most directly understand their ships and cannons. Thus the operation to seize *Hong Kong Coast Guard 64* was born.

This hijacking operation, from start to finish, was planned by Mr. Paul. The men and weapons were brought by him from Manila. Even establishing a secret camp on Lamay Island was his suggestion. The Zhengs provided ships and intelligence support.

Seeing his counterpart capture so cleanly and efficiently a fast ship from the reputedly invincible Australians, Zheng Zhifeng was thoroughly convinced—Mr. Paul really wasn't just talk. Not only could he make firearms, he was a skilled fighter! An eagerness to recruit him arose in his heart.

"...Can you manufacture the Australians' repeating rifle for us?" Zheng Zhifeng asked. "The kind on the ship you captured."

"Yes." Paul nodded without hesitation. "That's not difficult."

Seeing him dismiss manufacturing the legendary "Australian repeating rifle"—that "divine weapon"—so lightly, Zheng Zhifeng drew a sharp breath. Was this bragging or genuine expertise?

"Is that really true?!"

"Of course it is," Mr. Paul said. "But let me first make one thing clear: what I make won't be as light and handy as theirs, and probably can't fire continuously for extended periods. But making a weapon with the same effect is no problem at all."

"As long as you can make it, that's enough." Zheng Zhifeng couldn't contain his excitement. In his view, the "Australian repeating rifle" was practically a divine weapon, a key factor in Australian dominance over land and sea. If their side could also obtain this divine weapon—combined with the other cannons Paul had promised to manufacture—they'd already have two of the four characters in "strong ships, powerful guns."

As for "strong ships"—they'd already acquired several European sailing ships through various channels and were building large sailing ships themselves. These ships were Chinese-style, but in size and tonnage were no smaller than European ships. Once equipped with enough Western or Australian cannons, they could match any foe.
