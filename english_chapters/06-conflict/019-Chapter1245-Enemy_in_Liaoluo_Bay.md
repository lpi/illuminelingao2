# Chapter 1245 - Enemy in Liaoluo Bay

The boat belonging to Ning Liujin's relative wasn't big—at most 200 liao—just one of the countless ships making up the numbers in the Zheng fleet. The hull was old but still sturdy. The ship mounted two privately cast cannons. Short and thick, covered in yellow-red rust. When fired, they jumped three feet high; although tied down with ropes, a gunner could still get smashed if not careful. At Ning Liujin's feet were several large baskets filled with scrap metal, small stones, and broken porcelain to be used as shot. Several jars of gunpowder were left at the foot of the mast, covered with a few straw mats.

Besides the boat owner, the most prestigious person on board was the pilot, who could recite compass headings, read the compass, back-recite the tide songs fluently, and counted as the second-in-command along with the helmsman. Below them were the hands selling their lives; those who could fire cannons barely counted as third-tier, but the danger was too great. In less than half a year since Ning Liujin boarded, two gunners had been replaced. One died vomiting blood on the spot when a cannon jumped and hit him; one got his face burned when powder sprayed from the touchhole while lighting it—while rolling on the ground screaming, the owner had him thrown into the sea. Ning Liujin was scared out of his wits and swore secretly never to be a gunner.

"Apprentices" like Ning Liujin didn't count as human on the ship. Nobody took his status as the "owner's relative" seriously. All kinds of chores and punches were thrown his way. Not long after boarding, he was sodomized by a crewman one night while sleeping, and later suffered violently multiple times—such things were common in pirate gangs, and nobody cared.

To eat, he had to swallow his pride and endure. Hoping one day he could rise above others on the ship, maybe get a second-in-command position—warfare was frequent at sea these days; owners and pilots died fast. Some hands climbed to the owner's position after a few battles, even taking over the owner's wife and kids.

This time they gathered at Kinmen supposedly to fight the "Short-haired Bandits." One night after a few too many drinks, the owner spat as he said this was the Imperial Court's decree, that General Zheng was taking everyone to punish the bandits, and everyone would be rewarded after beating them.

Ning Liujin had no concept of what Short-haired Bandits were, only knowing they had huge, fast ships, reportedly more powerful than General Zheng—of course ordinary people dared not say this openly. Actually, not to mention Short-haired Bandits, he had no concept of who Liu Xiang was or how powerful he was, despite having fought him. In his view, fighting was just for rations; who to fight was for the bosses to consider. Ning Liujin's only concern was not losing his life in battle.

At 5:00 AM on September 20th, the outline of Kinmen Island was faintly visible. A lookout spotted the silhouettes of many ships 3 nautical miles north of the fleet. The duty officer in the fire control center immediately observed Liaoluo Bay with an infrared telescope. He saw many ships anchored along the shore in Liaoluo Bay, three or four rows deep. All small to medium vessels. Farther west, seven thousand-ton class three-masted gunships were anchored.

*Lichun* quickly raised signal flags, simultaneously notifying all flotillas and squadrons by light signal to prepare for combat in single column. At 5:10, orders issued from *Lichun*: Advance, enemy in Liaoluo Bay!

At 5:12, *Lichun's* 130mm main gun fired first from 3 nautical miles away. Then *Chedian*, *Yufeng*, *Chenglang*, and *Yangbo* fired in sequence. The muzzle flashes of the 130mm cannons turned the bay red.

Ning Liujin was sleeping groggily when suddenly a thunderous boom like rolling thunder filled the sky. Thinking a thunderstorm was coming, he hurriedly opened his eyes. The moon was bright, stars few. While he wondered, he saw a fire ball rise on the fleet's perimeter, then quickly fade. The sleeping crew on deck all woke up, suspicion and fear on their faces.

"Quick! Load the guns! Someone's raiding the camp!" The owner's urgent voice rang out.

The crew hurriedly loaded powder into cannons or matchlocks. Gunpowder jars were opened and poured directly into bores. Ning Liujin wasn't responsible for firearms; he immediately picked up his steel trident and stood by the gunwale, staring at the pitch-black sea.

From his angle he could see almost nothing. His ship was mixed among many medium and small ships in Liaoluo Bay; looking out, he saw only ships and masts.

But from the far clouds touching the horizon, flashing red lights could be seen, followed by rolling thunder. Dull explosions came one after another. The crewmen stared wide-eyed, not knowing what they were about to face.

"Quick, raise sails, weigh anchor!" Owners on every ship were shouting. Whatever they faced, staying here was clearly waiting for death. Ning Liujin was driven to weigh anchor; the wet cable rubbed his hands raw, but everyone was enveloped in fear, pulling the cable desperately regardless.

Suddenly, a bright light cut through sky and sea—like a burning segment of air, rotating on the water. The source of the light was faintly a huge black ship, masts towering, advancing extremely fast against the wind. Liujin thought he must be seeing things, because no ship could sail in that direction—it was pure headwind.

The light pointed to a sailing ship and stopped rotating. Orange flashes appeared on that phantom-like ship, then the sailing ship connected by the beam became a ball of fire. Sails curled up to the sky like mats; fragments flew over the firelight, drilling into the unknowable night.

The light suddenly vanished. Everyone stared dumbfounded as the burning ship quickly broke in two and sank, the flames floating on the water quickly extinguishing and dimming.

"Your mother, raise the sails!" The owner reacted first, kicking and beating several crewmen. "Sail! Sail! Full sail!" he screamed.

After the first round of bombardment on the Liaoluo Bay ship cluster, *Lichun* led the 4 gunboats in pausing fire to quickly correct firing data. Their targets were the seven main gunships further away; the volley just now only indicated targets for the following special service boat squadrons.

The special service boat squadrons followed behind, but their cannon range was much shorter, so they maintained fire silence, continuing into Liaoluo Bay. Shells were loaded, friction primers installed, gunners ready to fire at any moment.

Scattered cannon fire came from the Zheng fleet in Liaoluo Bay, but these ships' best cannons couldn't reach 1 nautical mile; for the sailors, it was just an unimpressive fireworks display. Coordinates by squadron commanders, the squadrons approached the enemy fleet in neat formation.

*Lichun* sailed forward 1 nautical mile. When only 2.5 nautical miles from the seven three-masted gunships, Ming Qiu checked his watch and ordered from the bridge: "Turn on searchlights, full squadron volley." *Lichun's* captain Li Ziping had repeatedly corrected firing data in the fire direction center, waiting for the order. As Ming Qiu spoke, *Lichun* fired the first volley, accurately covering a three-masted gunship. Soaring water columns instantly swallowed the enemy ship.

After *Lichun* fired, the main and broadside guns of each ship opened fire successively under searchlight guidance. Dozens of shells flew with red trails, raising countless water columns in the anchorage.

Li Ziping observed the rising and falling water columns through binoculars. Suddenly a ball of red flame flashed within the water columns, followed by a dull explosion.

"One hit!" the lookout shouted immediately.

"Continue firing, maintain speed." Li Ziping ordered on the bridge. Gunners on the main gun deck forward of the bridge were reloading. Swabbing the bore, loading silk chestnut-colored powder bags, pushing shells into the barrel, then firing.

With each shot, *Lichun* shuddered. Smoke and muzzle flash swept the deck. Vibration, heat, and smoke turned the foredeck into an inferno. But the gun crews yelled in excitement, some stripping to the waist, faces and bodies blackened by smoke and grease.

"Damn, really feels like *Clouds Above the Hill*." Li Ziping felt the acrid smoke brush his face on the sea breeze, choking him breathless. The bridge beneath his feet vibrated: the hiss of boilers, the roar of steam engines, the bellow of cannons... mixing into a powerful war symphony of the steam-and-cannon era.

As distance closed, the sky grew brighter; searchlights were no longer needed. Gunners constantly corrected aim based on splash points. Accuracy improved. Amidst dense water columns, balls of red-yellow flame burst repeatedly. Though some of the seven gunships had weighed anchor, they had almost no ability to fight back against the First Squadron's dense and accurate fire. Wooden hulls hit by shells suffered severe structural damage; shrapnel mixed with flying wood splinters turned decks into slaughterhouses of flying flesh and blood. Flammables on deck, uncontrolled, quickly ignited massive fires upon impact. One gunship took a direct hit to the stern magazine, exploding into two pieces.

From start to finish, though a few gunships managed to return fire, their guns were too few and range too short to threaten the First Squadron. Only when the First Squadron closed to about 1 nautical mile did a few shells fall within the column, hitting nothing. By then, the gunships were mostly hit, most sinking or reduced to burning hulks. The last two three-masted gunships lost all ability to resist after the next volley, sinking one by one under subsequent fire.
