# Chapter 1545 - Real Questions

Jiao Gongli and the other "examinees" opened the exam syllabus and were dumbfounded. There were so many rules and regulations. Just the list of "Reference Books" included several: some they knew, like the *Compendium of Materia Medica*; others they'd never heard of, like the *Imperial Song Ministry of Health TCM Practitioner and Pharmacist Qualification Education Standard Textbook (Trial Edition)*.

The problem was that the *Compendium of Materia Medica* wasn't the one sold in markets—Song Shengying, having been in the medicine business, had read it—but the syllabus specified a restriction: it had to be the "Imperial Song Australian Temporary Court Authorized 'Revised Edition'."

The reason the *Compendium of Materia Medica* was noted as Yuan Elder Court-published was that the version used in the future and the one recently published in this time were not the same. For TCM, the *Compendium* was the most important reference, but the book itself contained many errors. Li Shizhen had corrected massive pharmacological errors when compiling it, but modern times had revised the *Compendium* significantly—it was vastly different from early versions.

Both the syllabus and textbook were compiled by Liu San. At first he had scratched his head: unlike modern medicine, TCM had many theoretical schools, some vastly different. The same illness could have several treatments. And traditional medicine relied on oral transmission and self-study of ancient texts; everyone's exposure to theory differed. It was hard to use a simple question-and-answer mode for assessment.

In the old timeline, TCM practitioner exams were determined by standard textbooks. Regardless of school, to be a practitioner one had to test entirely within that syllabus scope. So his first task was compiling "Standard Textbooks" and "Reference Books" to unify exam content.

Both were easy: the Grand Library had ample materials. Liu San aimed for "simple" and "practical," blending textbooks from various TCM colleges and training materials for 1960s barefoot doctors to compile the textbook. Besides traditional TCM knowledge like the "Eighteen Incompatibilities" and "Nineteen Fears," basic herb properties, and acupuncture points, he added basic modern knowledge like human anatomy.

This textbook served not only for TCM students and health worker training but also as exam syllabus content. Essentially, TCM instruction, clinical practice, and management under the Yuan Elder Court were entirely based on these books he compiled.

Liu San was quite proud: a mere TCM doctor, he had now founded a sect. Henceforth, TCM standards in this timeline all came from the "Liu School."

But for Jiao Gongli, Song Shengying, and the Huang brothers, who knew only a little medicine, the syllabus was tough. Huang Zhen rushed to buy reference books, spending considerable circulation vouchers. Jiao Gongli read for half a day, only shaking his head blankly. His bone-setting relied on oral teaching and accumulated experience. He knew how to treat, and had effective prescriptions verified over years. How could he understand the theoretical syllabus? The only thing he understood was the human skeleton diagram.

Song Shengying and the Huang brothers were even worse. Because they gathered or traded herbs, they knew herb properties and thus understood a bit of medicine. Frankly, they were no better than average bell-ringing itinerant doctors. Thoroughly practical, with zero theoretical foundation.

After reading a few pages, they made a judgment: they absolutely couldn't pass the TCM Practitioner License. The Huang brothers said they might pass the Pharmacist License with effort, just needing to update their knowledge structure. As for Song Shengying, he said he was too old to memorize such a thick *TCM Pharmacopoeia*.

This meant the medicine shop plan was compromised; they could only open a pharmacy that didn't need a doctor. That wasn't crucial—the key was that without a doctor, the shop's scale had to shrink. How to house so many people? Shops didn't keep idlers; local officials seeing too many idle people would get suspicious.

Huang Zhen scratched his head, helpless. Sima Qiudao wasn't around to consult. Watching the shop take shape daily without a doctor... This wasn't the Ming, where charlatans and herbalists could practice openly. No license meant "illegal practice," as the female director said—catch you, strip off your pants for 100 lashes, then off to dig sand. The anti-Cropped-Hair cause would be over.

Just as he was at his wits' end, Zhou Zhongjun returned. Since coming down the mountain to Lingao, she was like a bird out of a cage. Though Huang Zhen repeatedly warned her not to run around, she often found excuses to go out.

Once out, it was trouble. Zhou Zhongjun immediately complained her allowance wasn't enough, ran to Huang Zhen, threw down a silver ingot, and insisted on exchanging for more circulation vouchers.

Huang Zhen couldn't refuse and exchanged another hundred vouchers for her. He couldn't afford to offend the Hengshan Sect—not that they were so powerful, but this operation used many female disciples for cover. Few sects had enough female disciples; only the all-female Hengshan Sect could provide them.

In other words, Hengshan contributed the most people. Zhou Zhongjun was a disciple of a powerful figure; both master and apprentice were proud. If provoked, she wouldn't care about the "overall martial arts situation" or "safety of the realm"—she'd throw a tantrum and leave. He couldn't bear that responsibility.

With money, Zhou Zhongjun fell into Lingao's consumption trap: starting with fun but useless trinkets, then crazy shopping, and recently even switching to "Australian style" clothes. Wearing skirts exposing her calves made Huang Zhen's eyes pop out: if Abbess Miejing saw this, she'd cut him down.

Of course, persuasion or prohibition was ineffective on Zhou Zhongjun. Except for her master and sect leader, she listened to no one. Others were too lazy to argue, so they let her be.

Today she had gone "scouting for news" again. Seeing her straw bag full to bursting, Huang Zhen knew she had visited the Nanbao Cooperative Branch again. The Cooperative was not only the largest, best-stocked store in Nanbao but also housed services: amusement arcade, teahouse, restaurants... a small shopping mall. Not only locals but Li people from nearby often came to spend. Though Li people enjoyed "fair trade" under the Yuan Elder Court and no longer suffered black-hearted peddlers, they quickly got lost in the net of "rich material goods" they'd never seen, spending every cent.

Zhou Zhongjun was no exception. Today she wore the latest spring fashion recommended by *Zhiyin*: a blue floral dress made of Indian printed cotton, with a cinched waist, slightly flared skirt, and round collar. The style was soft and elegant.

Though simple, it had a big background: designed and released by the Fashion Club under the Feiyun Society.

By future standards, the skirt was conservative—the hem was actually lengthened. But in the 17th century, exposing calves was shocking enough. There were short and long-sleeved versions; Zhou Zhongjun had some reserve and bought long sleeves. Without socks, she wore leather strap sandals—martial arts women had natural feet, needing no hiding.

Years of training gave her a figure and posture far more beautiful than ordinary native women. Her lithe, upright stance was rare, and wearing this form-fitting dress, she was dazzling.

Huang Zhen pretended not to see. She was useless for now anyway; when the main group arrived, her master would discipline her.

Zhou Zhongjun leaned in and whispered, "Brother Huang, still worried about the exam?"

Huang Zhen sighed and nodded. "These Cropped-Hair things are truly complex! Sect Leader Jiao says he can't even understand it, let alone learn it!"

"What about Villa Lord Song and the Huang uncles?"

"Villa Lord Song is hopeless. The Huangs might have a shot," Huang Zhen smiled bitterly. "They're studying hard in their room. I really owe them. If they can't pass, we can't run this medicine shop business—we'll have to start over!"

"You should have said so earlier," Zhou Zhongjun tilted her head with a mysterious smile. "I have something good." She fished a flat paper box from her straw bag and stuffed it into his hand.

"What is this?"

"Treasure. With this, getting that license is a cinch!" Zhou Zhongjun laughed.

Huang Zhen's heart skipped a beat. He knew all exams had cheating; even metropolitan exam questions could be bought with money and connections—people in the capital specialized in that. Since the Cropped-Hairs had "exams," presumably someone did this business too! He felt ashamed; as an old *jianghu* hand, he hadn't thought of this!

He opened the box. Inside was a booklet bound in thin cotton paper, covered in tiny fly-head characters. Huang Zhen verified it—full of questions and answers. He had studied the textbooks and guides carefully these past days and researched the license exam.

These questions looked exactly like the content in the *Real Questions Collection*. He rejoiced. But being an old hand, he paused and asked, "Where did you get this?"
