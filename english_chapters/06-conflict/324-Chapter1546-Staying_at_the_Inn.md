# Chapter 1546 - Staying at the Inn

Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard and closed the gate behind him.

He smiled and cupped his hands to the group still gathered in the yard. "Everyone, you have endured much hardship on the road." He bowed deeply.

Since Guangzhou, this dozen or so people had maintained straight faces, feigning the airs of a wealthy household. For Zhuo Yifan, playing the "young master" was manageable enough. But most occupied the role of "servants"—and several among them were renowned figures in the martial arts world. Being ordered about throughout the journey was indignity enough; actually serving others had been genuinely difficult.

"We have ventured deep into the dragon's pool for a life-or-death gambit. What is a little fatigue and hardship?" The "steward" who had been directing affairs in the courtyard shook his head. "Our only wish is to strike true this time, not fail the trust placed in us by the lords and elders."

"Above, we share the court's worries; below, we ease the people's distress," added another man dressed as a guard. "We are prepared to sacrifice our very lives if necessary. This bit of toil is nothing worth mentioning. Young Hero Zhuo, there's no need for such formality."

Among the "servants" in the yard, these two possessed the highest seniority and status. With them having spoken thus, the others could only murmur their agreement.

Zhuo Yifan bowed to the group once more, then addressed the "steward" directly. "I'll trouble Uncle Wan with the room arrangements."

The "steward" was Wan Lifeng, known in the *jianghu* as "Chasing Wind Sword." In his earlier years, he had worked as an escort and was thoroughly familiar with the traveling habits of wealthy families. This was essentially resuming his old trade. He nodded. "Rest assured—leave it to me."

Zhuo Yifan walked toward the veranda. Several men and women stood waiting there. One glance told him: only Hengshan Sect disciples remained in the main room.

The Hengshan Sect was composed entirely of women and had somewhat "maverick" ways. Zhuo Yifan had witnessed plenty of evidence during the journey.

He stopped at the doorway without entering—the room was full of women; propriety demanded he avoid the appearance of impropriety. Speaking through the fine bamboo curtain, he announced:

"Abbess, the clerk has departed."

"Young Hero Zhuo? Please, come in and speak with me."

"Yes."

Zhuo Yifan lifted the bamboo curtain and stepped inside.

The "Old Madam" sat squarely in the center, female disciples attending on either side. Though the room was pleasantly cool, beads of sweat kept trickling down the old woman's face and forehead. As the "Old Madam" dabbed at them with a towel, her bearing had lost something of its earlier "dignity."

The woman playing the "Old Madam" was none other than Abbess Miejing of the Hengshan Sect. The maids beside her were mostly young disciples of her sect.

Though she had traveled in luxury, this Abbess had suffered: to conceal her identity as a nun, she had worn a heavy wig the entire journey, removing it only to sleep. After passing Guangzhou, the weather had grown hotter by the day. Wearing that heavy, stifling wig was decidedly unpleasant.

"Young Hero Zhuo, please sit."

"Thank you, Abbess." Zhuo Yifan remained impeccably respectful—the tempers of the Hengshan elders tended toward the eccentric.

"Is everything settled outside?"

"The luggage has been delivered; everyone's quarters are arranged." Zhuo Yifan reported, "The Abbess and her sect's disciples will stay in this main house. I'll have the luggage brought in shortly. I'll also inform the clerks that you are observing a vegetarian fast and order top-grade vegetarian food for dinner."

Miejing's face showed no expression. Hearing his arrangements, she merely nodded. "You have taken considerable trouble."

"Not at all. The Abbess is an elder—this is simply my duty. I will go out tonight to contact Seventh Master and the others. When I have news, I shall report to the Abbess tomorrow."

Miejing nodded. "Go attend to it. I hear the Cropped-Hairs' lackeys are formidable—like the Eastern Depot—and include many martial arts scum who have sold out to them. Be careful in everything."

"Yes, I understand. Please be at ease, Abbess."

Miejing inclined her head slightly and said no more.

Zhuo Yifan returned to the courtyard. Wan Lifeng had finished arranging quarters: besides the Hengshan disciples in the small courtyard, the other women would stay there as well. The men had all been moved to the larger courtyard.

As for luggage, there wasn't much beyond personal clothing and bedding—save for their swords and weapons, concealed within chests.

The large official chests that had filled an entire carriage mostly contained bricks and rubble—purely for show. Though fake, Wan Lifeng dared not leave them piled outside at random lest the clerks grow suspicious. He had painstakingly stacked them all in the side rooms.

Once everyone had settled in, Abbess Miejing sent two disciples to deliver the fruits and the large jar of plum syrup that the clerk had provided to the larger courtyard, where everyone could cool off.

The group, still sweating from the labor of moving boxes, abandoned all pretense of dignity upon seeing the refreshments. They claimed spots in the shade or beneath the eaves, sitting on the ground to eat and drink.

Zhuo Yifan was their leader. Though junior in generation, his rank was not insignificant. He yielded the stone table and chairs beneath the grape trellis to the team's key figures: Wan Lifeng, Sha Guangtian, and Meng Bofei.

These three were heavyweights in the martial arts world. Zhuo Yifan knew that relying solely on his master Daoist Baishi's prestige—or on the righteousness invoked by the phrase "sharing the court's worries"—hadn't been enough to persuade them to wade into these murky waters.

Zhuo Yifan knew only that the mastermind was "Old Shi." Who this Old Shi actually was, he had no idea. But whoever could mobilize so many martial heroes must wield immense influence in both the court and the *jianghu*.

"What do we do next?"

"Wait for the right moment." Zhuo Yifan said, "This is the heart of the Cropped-Hairs' territory. We must not act rashly. Wait until I've contacted Mr. Sima, then we'll discuss our next moves. Uncle Wan—please continue in your role as steward. Though we close the doors and are masters of our own domain within, we must maintain the necessary appearances and show no flaws. If a clerk notices something amiss and reports us, the entire plan will be ruined. Naturally, some of our colleagues will have to endure a bit of inconvenience..."

"Yes, I understand." Wan Lifeng nodded. "Everyone has walked the *jianghu* for years. They understand what's required."

"Maintain the proper style, but don't overdo it. We are an established noble family. Don't act like nouveau riche."

The men laughed. Zhuo Yifan turned to Sha and Meng. "Uncles, please continue as guards. Keep tight watch at the gates with everyone else. Guard the entrance by day; post sentries by night. Pay particular attention to the Abbess's quarters—watch for strangers intruding. That area is prone to slips."

The two exchanged knowing smiles. Within these walls, the Abbess needn't suffer under her wig. But if anyone caught sight of her shaved head, it would become news instantly.

"Unless absolutely necessary, don't leave the inn. Don't even leave the courtyard lightly. As for gathering intelligence and scouting routes, wait until I've met with Sima—they've been here half a month already."

The three nodded. Suddenly the doorbell rang loudly. Everyone startled and rose to their feet with a collective swoosh. Zhuo Yifan raised his hand, signaling Wan Lifeng to answer.

The people in the yard quickly cleared away fruits and teacups before retreating into their rooms. Sha and Meng took positions by the veranda, hands at their sides.

The gate opened to reveal Li Xiaoliu holding a thick stack of papers. He smiled apologetically—he had come to inform them about tomorrow's residency registration.

"...These are the household forms. Since the Young Master and Old Madam will be staying in Lingao for an extended period, local regulations require registration for temporary residency. It's a government rule—please forgive the inconvenience." Li Xiaoliu bowed and added, "Tomorrow, residency police from East Gate Market Police Station will come to verify the registration. Please remain at the inn and refrain from going out to avoid missing official business and causing any complications."

Zhuo Yifan thought, *These Cropped-Hairs certainly talk big. A mere public servant commands such formality—casually telling noble guests to "wait for verification." Who knows how they oppress ordinary people.* He disapproved.

Indeed, Wan Lifeng frowned. "Filling out forms is fine—when in Rome, do as the Romans. But a petty public servant making our Young Master and Old Madam 'wait'? That seems rather..."

The clerk quickly interjected, "Steward! Please don't say such things. According to the Chiefs' regulations, one normally must report to the station in person to register. Our Young Owner exhausted considerable effort to arrange for officers to come here for verification—it's a special exception. You saw that family earlier. Who knows how that will end?"

"What is that female officer's background, to be so fierce?"

"Her? That's Lian Nishang, an order police officer from East Gate Market Station. The most formidable of them all." The clerk grinned. "She's actually quite nice—just don't get any 'improper' ideas about her."

"So they really expect female relatives to show their faces on the street and queue in line?" Wan Lifeng wanted to pump him for information. "Surely spending a few coins could smooth things over."

"Hard to say!" The clerk shook his head. "Bribery absolutely won't work. It depends on whether my Owner can intercede with the station. In my humble view—unlikely!"

"Lingao's laws are truly this strict?"

"Indeed. So let me remind you: this isn't the Ming. Never violate Australian regulations."

"I'm obliged, brother." Wan Lifeng fished a circulation voucher from his pocket and pressed it into the man's hand. "Have some tea on me."

"Thank you for the reward, Steward." Li Xiaoliu smiled and bowed again. He then inquired about dinner arrangements and whether they would need carriages or rickshaws for sightseeing in East Gate Market.

"Arrange dinner according to first-class standards as listed in the guest book. Our Old Madam observes a vegetarian diet—please prepare vegetarian dishes for her. No carriages needed for now. We're weary from travel and will rest early tonight. Please ensure plenty of hot water is available this evening."

"Understood." Li Xiaoliu smiled. "Regarding hot water—the inn provides hot water service after dark. Simply turn the tap."
