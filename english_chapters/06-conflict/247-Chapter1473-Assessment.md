# Chapter 1473 - Assessment

His eyes were black, a darkness deep and bottomless, like a child's eyes but utterly devoid of childlike innocence, deep and cold as black holes. His gaze fixed tightly on Xiao Zishan from head to toe.

Xiao Zishan felt sweat on his back—a demon.

"Just mineral water."

Xin Wuzui pulled a bell cord. A bell rang somewhere, and then he spoke as if to the air: "Please bring a bottle of mineral water."

In moments, a female secretary brought mineral water in a glass bottle.

"Thank you." Xiao Zishan accepted the glass bottle, his eyes sweeping over the secretary's neck—the girl was very beautiful, likely Xin Wuzui's domestic secretary. Xin Wuzui had bought a domestic secretary quite late, but easily obtained an S-grade and an A-grade maidservant. Xiao Zishan remembered this well—this man's insight into timing was indeed extraordinary.

*Surprisingly not wearing a collar.* Xiao Zishan thought silently.

"Does Director Xiao think I should have a naked woman crawling here with a collar around her neck and a tail plugged in her anus?"

Xiao Zishan started, hurriedly saying: "Not at all, not at all."

"You see, when a person becomes an official, their adaptability and shame threshold often increase significantly—you can now lie without thinking and without blushing. If you want to see, I can have her perform for a bit..."

Xiao Zishan gave a dry laugh: "It seems you're living quite well here."

"Thank you for your concern. As a transmigrator, I live quite well. Director Xiao, you must like reading Russian literary works."

"It's okay."

"You definitely like reading them. When you feel alienated from someone, you unconsciously switch to using 'honorific you' (您)—this isn't a Chinese speaking habit."

Xiao Zishan didn't speak. He realized the other party had strong observational skills and speaking techniques. Facing him, who held power, the other adopted methods to strike at his confidence—he decided not to engage in a verbal spar, avoiding the sharp edge.

"Even this you've seen through." Xiao Zishan raised his hand. "Actually I don't particularly like it, but I do like that Russian tone. Let's not talk about this. Are you used to it here?"

"Ever since I suffered your so-called 'just punishment' until now, life has been passable—although I don't much like having people care about how many times I piss or make love to my maidservant, generally speaking, you've fulfilled your promise—you've given me every life enjoyment a transmigrator should have. Of course, I've actually been put into a glass coffin by you all. But I'm used to it."

Xiao Zishan nodded with a smile, as if he hadn't heard what was said, continuing on his own track: "So you're living not bad."

"Did Li Xiaolü change her perfume recently?"

"Probably." Xiao Zishan tried hard to conceal his astonishment. Although his relationship with Li Xiaolü wasn't exactly airtight, not many knew, and those who did mostly believed "silence is gold" and would never spread it casually. Most critically, Xin Wuzui had access to extremely few transmigrators; the possibility of him knowing this was zero. He couldn't help asking, "How did you know?"

"Your clothes are stained with the scent," Xin Wuzui twitched his nose, taking a deep breath. "It's a locally produced perfume, but separated into top, middle, and base notes. It's more profound and complex than the perfume scent on you in the past—that incense-mixing lady's skills have improved."

"I mean, how do you know about Li Xiaolü?"

Xin Wuzui stared at him for a moment, then suddenly laughed: "You love her very much, right?"

"Yes."

"The sudden alert expression when I mentioned this name made me realize this is an important woman in your life." Xin Wuzui picked up a cigar with a smile. The secretary who had brought tea immediately appeared, half-kneeling at his feet to strike a match and light it for him.

"You haven't answered my question."

"Am I obligated to answer your question?" Xin Wuzui gazed at his cigar with a playful smile. "You see, you have your little secrets, and I have mine."

Xiao Zishan realized he was being blackmailed—but he had no choice. This villain knew his weakness and would fully utilize it.

"Alright, what do you want?"

"Awesome! Since you became Director of the Administrative Office, your political wisdom has grown. But you're still a bit too cautious. What work did you do before D-Day? Although you're adept at administrative logistics now, I feel you must have been a sales representative before."

Xiao Zishan was shocked this time. He had never told anyone what specific work he did before D-Day; only Chief Wen and Wang Luobin knew. Few had seen his personnel file.

"Let's put it this way: actually, you didn't like your job at all. Trivial, exhausting, and humble—you must have been in FMCG sales—ah, a truly loathsome job: having to read faces, ingratiate yourself in every way, sometimes swallow insults and compromise for the sake of the big picture. And you weren't satisfied with your income level."

"I'm also ingratiating and satisfying transmigrators' needs now."

"That's politeness from a superior. I say thank you to any cleaning lady pouring water, and 'hard work' to the courier guy. That doesn't mean I love them or fear them, let alone respect them."

"Let's return to the topic—"

---

"No, no, that's wrong, very stupid. Interrupting suddenly when someone is speaking continuously disjoints the conversation and isn't good for the atmosphere. We can keep talking because of the atmosphere. You have to learn to transition naturally to the topic you want to discuss."

"Alright, please continue. I'm all ears." Xiao Zishan thought, *He's trying to manipulate the conversation.*

"That's right. You aren't very smart, but you have wisdom, much better than some who have cleverness but no wisdom," Xin Wuzui said. "Talk about your past job."

"Monotonous boring work. Meeting every morning, then patrolling stores, discussing promotions, then back to the office to do reports."

"Then why didn't you switch jobs?"

"Changing jobs is hard, and there wasn't much room for choice."

"Obviously you lacked confidence in your own abilities. In fact, you indeed didn't have much strength to switch jobs, so you made do with the existing job—at least it looked somewhat respectable, right?"

"Roughly so." Xiao Zishan didn't evade.

"Not bad, you can face your weaknesses frankly." Xin Wuzui nodded. "Alright, my request is simple: change of environment."

"Please be more specific."

"I'm tired of being a human computer in this prison. I think you understand what I mean."

Xiao Zishan nodded: "I understand your feelings."

"No, you won't understand, because you haven't felt it." Xin Wuzui looked up at the sky, blowing out a cloud of blue smoke. "For over two years, I've lived a recluse life—forced, of course."

"There are no orders restricting your movement except prohibiting contact—"

"Don't tell me the two big soldiers in the guard room equipped with handcuffs and batons are there to protect my personal safety."

"In a sense, you could think so," Xiao Zishan said. "Salina has a good memory."

Xin Wuzui's face twitched, lips moving silently. Xiao Zishan didn't know lip-reading, but he still read the word: "Bitch."

He continued: "Don't fool me. My request is simple: switch to a job where I can frequently see other transmigrators. No more having someone 'gently watching' me all the time..."

"I can't do that." Xiao Zishan rejected flatly.

"You can, because you are the one concretely executing policy, aren't you? Don't make excuses about the Political Security Bureau; internal security work has always been your responsibility."

"Impossible." Xiao Zishan shook his head. "I can give you some convenience in activities, but matters of principle are non-negotiable."

"That's too regrettable." Xin Wuzui shook his head, smoking his cigar facing the sky, no longer looking at Xiao Zishan.

"Fine, you're using your reputation and the woman I like to threaten me into an exchange," Xiao Zishan said. "But the guards you mentioned reminded me: the key to the chain is in my hand. You haven't broken the chain in these years. As long as I don't unlock it for you, you won't break free in another twenty years—and you've reminded me how dangerous you are. Next, I'll keep watching the chain to see if it rusts."

"You have such great confidence that you can stay in high office forever?"

Xiao Zishan finished the water in the bottle: "I've responded to your proposal. Now answer my proposal. Let's see if there's still a possibility of a deal."

Xin Wuzui didn't reply. After a long while, he said: "Before I answer the questions you're interested in, please answer a question of mine first."

"Okay."

"Why did you suddenly think of coming here to find me?"

"It's my job..."

"You're lying again—in the two-plus years here, except for occasional Finance Sector transmigrators, absolutely no one has ever come to find me. Let's vary be open: I have no tape recorder, no recording pen, no camera or smartphone here—these things were all 'requisitioned' by you 'in the name of the Senate'."

"Alright. To be precise, someone suggested letting you do certain work. I felt very uneasy about this and needed to come confirm personally."

"And the result of the confirmation?"

"Obviously, not suitable." Xiao Zishan had already made a decision of rejection internally—this person was too dangerous.

"You're wrong there." Xin Wuzui sighed. "Let me tell you one thing first: from last week until now, besides you, two other transmigrators have actually come to find me."
