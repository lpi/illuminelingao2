# Chapter 1273: Talk in the Jasmine Room

The second floor also housed a sand table simulation room, equipped with three configurations: naval, land, and amphibious warfare. Combined with exquisite terrain models and weapon miniatures, it supported military sand table games ranging from simple war chess to highly detailed strategic simulations. This was the venue where military enthusiasts congregated most enthusiastically.

At this hour, the large recreation room and sand table room blazed with light, laughter and conversation drifting out periodically. Wu Nanhai did not disturb the Senators inside and proceeded directly to the third-floor private rooms.

The entire third floor consisted of separate salon chambers—comparable to small and medium conference rooms. Eight rooms in total. These were prepared by the teahouse for Senators' private and departmental gatherings. Since opening, Senator associations frequently held their entertainment events here during holidays: The Indigenous Rights Protection Association and Women's Federation were regular visitors. Although the Flying Cloud Club maintained its own venue, it sometimes hosted smaller gatherings here. Occasionally, Senators brought capable naturalized subordinates from their departments for relaxation as reward.

The private rooms featured specialized soundproofing and ensured strict privacy. Various foods and beverages were available on request. The waitresses were all D-grade or below maids selected from the General Office, having undergone thorough training. Those serving on this floor wore jade pendants at their waists that clinked pleasantly as they walked—a discreet signal alerting Senators in private conversation that a waitress was approaching.

Thoughtful, meticulous service had gradually made this place a primary venue for informal Senator exchanges—the core zone of "lobbying" activity.

Wu Nanhai checked his watch, then entered the Agricultural Committee's frequently used chamber, the Milk Vetch Room. Several Ministry of Agriculture Senators had been playing *Legends of the Three Kingdoms* here for quite some time, while a few others reclined on the sofa smoking hookahs and working on laptops—the teahouse private rooms were among the few entertainment venues with all-day electricity and sockets.

Several people greeted him; he acknowledged each in turn. Only then did he take a seat at the salon's small bar. Seeing him settle in, the maid tending the bar poured him a glass of "Hehui" brand gooseberry wine brewed by the Agricultural Committee's winery without waiting for his order—mixed to his preferred ratio: a few ice cubes, one-third wine, then topped off with soda water. She also produced a dish of salted peanuts as a drinking snack.

Wan Lihui sat beside him, eyes half-closed as he smoked a hookah—he didn't inhale the smoke, merely savored the atmosphere. After exhaling the contents of his mouth in a procession of rings, Wan Lihui said: "Old Wu, what do you make of the report my brother submitted from Jeju?"

Since Wan Lihuang had gone to Jeju Island to "grind the dungeon," he had been busy promoting potato, citrus, and Chinese cabbage cultivation there. Recently, he had also begun encouraging alfalfa cultivation to support the island's animal husbandry. Agriculture was thriving—potato cultivation especially so. The first batch sown in early summer of 1632 had just yielded its first bumper harvest in October.

Though Wan Lihuang had conducted trial planting only in the standard village farm fields near Jeju's three cities, the results were remarkable. Modern potato varieties could produce over two tons per mu under ideal conditions. While Wan Lihuang lacked chemical fertilizer, he knew plant ash could substitute for the potassium fertilizer potatoes needed most, and he had brought quality seeds from another timeline. Combined with modern field management techniques, Jeju Island's average potato yield still reached nine hundred kilograms per mu. Even by old-timeline standards, that figure easily passed muster.

The bountiful harvest had left unprepared local naturalized cadres "not knowing how to store them." Potatoes had high water content and would rot quickly without prompt processing and storage. Fortunately, Jeju Island had many mouths to feed. Under Feng Zongze's direction, potatoes were distributed as the primary ration for refugees.

Beyond simple stewing and roasting, a variety of potato-based products had been specially developed: potato pancakes, potato cold noodles, potato kelp miso soup, and other dishes featuring potatoes as the main ingredient. With the assistance of diverse seasonings and vegetables, refugees found their meals superior to the previous relief dry rations.

Feng Zongze naturally came to view this Agricultural Committee special envoy in a new light, showering the inexperienced Wan Lihuang with such praise that the young man hardly knew north from south.

Encouraged by this reception, Wan Lihuang proposed expanding Jeju Island's potato planting area by two hundred percent, with two sowings annually.

This meant Jeju would need more than just potato seedlings. Expanding the sowing area required a larger seedling breeding base, facilities for processing and storing harvested potatoes, and more fertilizer—not merely potassium fertilizer, but nitrogen fertilizer as well. Even for local chemical fertilizers and pesticides, a dedicated production factory would be necessary. These requirements all involved expanding the Agricultural Committee's capital investment on Jeju Island. He also proposed establishing a seafood processing plant locally.

Wu Nanhai sipped his wine. "Little Wan, you've arrived at a good time. I've read your brother's report carefully—very well written! It's wonderful that he's so enthusiastic about agricultural affairs on Jeju Island. Old Feng wrote me a letter too, full of praise. Making such a splash in less than a year on Jeju is no small feat!"

Hearing the leader heap praise on his brother, Wan Lihui felt warmth surge through his chest. He hastened to add: "He's still relatively young..."

"Youth is a virtue. Young people should venture out and take risks. Don't worry about the technical support mentioned in the report—I've arranged for someone to compile a 'Jeju Island Agricultural Production Reference Compilation' using materials from the Great Library. It will be sent on the next liner." Wu Nanhai thought as he spoke: *Your brother stuck his neck out on Feng Zongze's behalf. Those projects in the report are probably what Feng wanted most.*

"I've also done my best to arrange the various materials he requested. Among the short-term trainees graduating from the agricultural technology class this time, ten are specifically assigned to Jeju Island, so tell Little Wan not to worry—just go ahead boldly."

"Thank you, Old Wu." Wan Lihui nodded, feeling slightly embarrassed recalling the idle speculation he'd shared with his brother before—Wu Nanhai truly was a kind person. His face flushed faintly.

"What's there to thank? It's all for the work." Wu Nanhai continued, "By the way, this batch of trainees also includes ten students majoring in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. The allocation sends six to Nick; your brother keeps four for himself—don't let Nick take everyone. This island isn't just for raising horses; other livestock development will follow. Breeding stock will be sent soon. These people have received primary medical training as well—whether treating people or livestock, they can handle it. Though their skills are rough, they're still more professional than local practitioners of this era."

"I will, absolutely." Wan Lihui nodded enthusiastically, already glimpsing a bright future for his brother's dungeon grind. Having secured so much, raising the matter of additional projects felt somewhat awkward—Old Wu had already been generous. Yet he couldn't leave it unsaid, so he hesitated before asking: "Do you think the projects mentioned in the letter are possible?"

Wu Nanhai gently tapped his cigar against the Jingdezhen brush washer from Jiangxi that served as an ashtray, letting the long ash fall, before answering: "Those projects should all be launched. But the finance department says this year's capital construction investment has been exhausted—they'll have to be arranged in next year's budget. I hear next year's budget is rather tight. Our agricultural sector must unite and fight for it." He emphasized the word "unite" specifically.

"Didn't they say they got more than a million taels of silver from Zheng Zhilong?" Wan Lihui found this hard to believe.

"When cannons roar, ten thousand taels of gold are spent. The spoils were considerable, but the spending is equally fierce. I heard Old Ma's and Cheng Dong's faces turned green when the military expense reimbursement came through this time." Wu Nanhai described it vividly, as if he'd witnessed it personally. "Besides, there are many competing priorities now. And I hear there's a currency reform planned for next year—another massive silver expenditure..."

Wan Lihui began to discern the subtext. Wasn't Wu Nanhai using "emphasizing difficulties" to suggest there was "no money" for his brother's proposed projects?

"So it's very difficult?" Wan Lihui decided to probe Wu Nanhai's true intentions.

"We'll do our utmost. Our agricultural sector and the Ministry of Light Industry must fight for this." Wu Nanhai spoke firmly. "But you know how it is—once the Senate reviews the budget, every department scrambles in another famine fight. Whether it can pass exactly as we submitted is hard to say."

This statement remained highly flexible—equivalent to saying nothing at all. Wan Lihui felt quite disappointed. Wu Nanhai sensed the moment was right and added: "I have another thought regarding this matter. I'd like to discuss it with you..."

After sending off an eager Wan Lihui who was hurrying back, Wu Nanhai proceeded to the reserved Jasmine Room. On the sofa in one corner of the salon, several Senators from the finance sector whom he had specifically invited today were already present. Wu Nanhai made a gesture; the waitress brought drinks and snacks, and they immediately cut to the chase.

This was the reason he had specifically instructed Chuqing to reserve the Jasmine Room for tonight: he wished to discuss with these finance sector Senators a proposal to the Senate allowing state-owned enterprises to issue stocks and bonds. The specific case involved issuing Ministry of Agriculture Agricultural Development Bonds and non-cumulative preferred stocks of various directly affiliated enterprises throughout Hainan Island and the Guangzhou region.

The so-called preferred stock, simply put, granted shareholders special rights to receive company earnings as fixed dividends prior to common shareholders, and to receive remaining assets prior to others during bankruptcy liquidation. However, shareholders generally could not participate in company business activities. In practice, it was a form of debt-based fundraising.

Wu Nanhai planned to issue non-cumulative preferred stocks, which distributed dividends only from the current year's profits. If the company performed poorly in a given year and could not distribute dividends, the unpaid amount could not be accumulated or paid later. It was equivalent to a corporate bond that did not promise annual interest.
