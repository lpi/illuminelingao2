# Chapter 1441 - Provocation

"Usually, you always dress so dowdily." Panpan sucked on the small wooden spoon for her coffee. "Ponytail, black glasses—that day when you changed your clothes, I almost didn't recognize you."

Cheng Yongxin's deliberate dressing up today was waiting for exactly this sentence.

She put on a look of serious thought, then replied with a faint smile:

"Ever since Salina was almost raped but no one was punished for it, I felt it was safer to make myself look a bit uglier." Panpan almost choked.

The case of the attempted rape of female agent Salina was no secret among the Elders with real power, especially not to the Dingding couple who were already heads of the propaganda department at the time.

At that time, because the status of Salina and her group as Elders not yet been recognized, plus the shielding of "one of our own," the few perpetrators were hastily transferred far away on the grounds of maintaining stability, while Salina was placed under the direct protection of the powerful departments.

But clearly, for women, the shadow cast by this incident was much larger. Although Panpan had tacitly accepted this reality at the time, she always felt unwilling whenever she thought about it. This emotion was stirred up again today by a single sentence from her.

"Right! If we throw away all the morals of the old world as soon as we arrive in the new world, how are we different from beasts? Moreover, since an exception was made for something that should be a bottom line, won't everything follow this precedent in the future? The Council of Elders might as well declare rape legal!"

Panpan's emotions instantly became agitated. A barely perceptible smile appeared at the corner of Cheng Yongxin's mouth: foreign girls were indeed simple-minded; a few sentences stirred up their emotions. In her view, the Salina incident was simply too perfect—Salina was not only a young woman but also a white person from the United States. She shared natural common attributes with Panpan.

The phrase "feeling as if it happened to oneself" was not just empty talk.

She judged: in this Council of Elders group that openly listed the purchase of white female slaves as a government project and nakedly promoted "Lebensraum," the implicit double discrimination of gender and race was a constant pressure for modern white women. Panpan definitely couldn't fail to experience it. As long as she guided it appropriately, she could provoke her "self-defense" emotions to exploit.

"Sigh, that's..." Cheng Yongxin deliberately made a helpless expression. "Salina was an agent investigating the Council of Elders at the time. Being hostile to the Elders, she had to accept her bad luck for suffering this loss. I'm just thinking, previously it was because the interests of 'non-companions' could be sacrificed under the great cause of 'maintaining stability.' What about in the future?"

Panpan nodded silently: in an instant, she understood the second half that Cheng Yongxin didn't say.

Next time, when the interests of the few conflict again with the interests of the many, or the interests of those in power, who will be the next one sacrificed?

The reason Salina's matter could be easily smoothed over indicated that this group had already shown a dangerous sign—their moral bottom line had lowered.

In this race to the bottom, whoever had a little humanity left could obtain the title of "righteousness."

Since D-Day, Dingding had grasped a degree after his manuscripts were constantly rejected: the Executive Committee hoped the *Lingao Times* could mercilessly expose the scars of the Ming Dynasty—black was black, gray was painted black, and white was also painted black. But for the Council of Elders, even if there were parts reflecting on mistakes, it should be like an emperor's edict of self-reproach; everything had to be conducted under the premise that "the rule of the Council of Elders is a salvation."

Simply put, it was the Chinese version of "divine right of kings." The Council of Elders wanted to paint a layer of "sacred salvation" over their own rule. Dingding understood this very well, and Panpan was naturally not confused. The best evidence was that Panpan spoke less and less, and slowly stopped asking to run news stories herself.

Every interview with naturalized citizens, those stuttering or even weird-toned Mandarin sentences, depicted a hell Panpan dared not imagine.

Yes, a true hell on earth. Things that would be considered heinous crimes in the modern time-space happened here openly and without any punishment. Oppression of subordinates by superiors, bullying of the weak by the strong, were all naked and taken for granted.

Indescribable suffering, atrocities that made one's hair stand on end just hearing about them, terrible crimes committed by ordinary people without hesitation for survival...

For Panpan, her poverty meant just not having received her salary yet and having to stuff herself with food at that pizza shop on the corner that tasted explosively bad. The greatest hardship she had suffered was during the period just after landing on D-Day, the scarcity of food and the military training during combat readiness.

Ironically, the Council of Elders used her professionalism to destroy her principles, with the aim of pulling many people living in hell back to the human world.

Yes, the human world. This was Panpan's final compromise with herself: Lingao under the rule of the Council of Elders was certainly not heaven, but at least it was a place for humans to stay, so she chose to serve the Council of Elders silently.

However, this compromise often made Panpan's conscience uneasy inside. The execution news a few days ago and Cheng Yongxin's words today further expanded the shadow in her heart.

"You know," Panpan finally spoke, "I've always felt that some practices of the Council of Elders are improper. However, no matter what the Council of Elders' motives are, objectively speaking, they are leading this world toward a better side..."

"'For survival,' 'for the majority'—excuses like these create a sense of exoneration, believing that the sins one commits are all a kind of 'have to.' The final destination is the Iron Cross group and gas chambers that even Germans are ashamed to mention."

Cheng Yongxin threw in another point. She knew deeply the weight Nazis occupied in political correctness in Europe and America. Hinting that the Council of Elders was sliding into the abyss of political incorrectness had a strong psychological suggestion effect on someone like Panpan working in journalism: must do something immediately.

"You are quite right." Panpan was indeed hit in the deep worries of her heart by her words. In fact, there was no need for Cheng Yongxin to specifically wake her up. Over the past few years, how could she not know what nature of regime the Council of Elders was, and what roles she and her boyfriend played in the regime?

Seeing Panpan's expression, Cheng Yongxin knew her words had taken effect. She decided to stop there and withdraw her troops, letting her think it over carefully.

She began to switch the chat to relaxed topics, but Panpan kept looking distracted. Cheng Yongxin felt secretly smug; today's "operation" was already more than half successful.

Panpan suddenly spoke as if she had made some determination, "Do you know why I quarreled with Dingding?"

"I don't know; that's your private affair."

"No, it's public business." Panpan's expression was somewhat twisted. "I'm really chilled to the bone. I didn't expect him to be like this." She hesitated for a moment. "You will keep a secret, right?"

Cheng Yongxin couldn't suppress the excitement in her heart. "Sharing secrets" was a sign of upgraded friendship between women.

"Of course." She nodded solemnly.

"The matter is like this—"

The cause of the matter was a "falling accident" that occurred in Bairen City three days ago. The deceased was a "pending assignment" maid from the Maid School named Lin Xiaoya. At five in the morning, a cleaner found her dead downstairs in a building in the Elders' dormitory area. The police immediately entered the scene for investigation and preliminarily determined it was a death by falling. The body was then transported to the forensic center for examination.

Accidents are not rare in any society; a fall could be suicide or an accidental slip. But the suspicious point came: as a "pending assignment" maid, it was impossible for her to enter the Elders' dormitory area on her own—no pass. The security work done by the Lingao Garrison Battalion for the Elders' dormitory area was very detailed; they would never allow a naturalized citizen without a pass to enter the dormitory area.

"There's something fishy about this matter." Cheng Yongxin said.

"Yes, I think so too. I went to the scene for an interview, came back and wrote a manuscript, and then it was killed by Dingding."

"Why?" Cheng Yongxin pretended to be surprised.

"He said this matter cannot be published—it's easy to cause bad consequences in public opinion." Panpan became excited again. "I just reported truthfully, didn't make any speculation at all. Why must it be taken down? I talked to him for a long time, but he resolutely disagreed. Is the Council of Elders really guilty of a thief's conscience?!"

"How is the case being handled now?"

"It has been transferred to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Headquarters. I told Dingding: I have already sent an interview application to the Police Headquarters, demanding full coverage of the interview, and the final official investigation results must be published. Otherwise, I really quit!"

Cheng Yongxin shook her head: "I already foresee what the result will be—it will absolutely have nothing to do with any Elder."

Panpan fell into silence.

"Don't you know that the basic tenet of the Council of Elders regarding matters involving Elders is to muddy the waters?" Cheng Yongxin said sharply. "Even if this case is finally proven to involve an Elder, it will be left unsettled—the Salina case was like this; who would care about the life of a female slave? Not to mention there is the great 'Common Program' to protect Elders from any punishment."

"It can't go on like this anymore." Panpan said involuntarily.

"Yes, it can't go on like this anymore." Cheng Yongxin said meaningfully. "First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, and I did not speak out—because I was a Protestant. Finally they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."
