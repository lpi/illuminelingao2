# Chapter 1435 - Cockfighting

His coffee was not yet finished when the phone on his desk rang. It was from Zhan Wuya of the Manufacturing Supervisorate. He knew the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had people active in Manila, so he asked if they could assist in covering a small exploration team entering the Philippines. The Manufacturing Supervisorate had its eye on the rich mineral resources of the Philippine archipelago. Besides the well-known gold and copper mines, they valued the Philippines' advantage in nickel and chromium ores even more.

"...These two ores are very, very, very important to us..." Zhan Wuya used "very" three times to emphasize his tone. His anxiety was justified. If the chemical industry wanted to expand production capacity, it had to break free from equipment manufacturing materials with severely deficient processing properties like glass and ceramics—using these materials to make equipment meant the Council of Elders' chemical industry would forever be merely expanded laboratory production.

The chemical sector clamored all day long for corrosion-resistant metal pipes and pressure vessels; the medical sector urgently needed stainless steel to make new surgical instruments; the machinery industry sector was also extremely thirsty for high-performance alloy steels and anti-corrosion coating materials; even the finance sector had proposed issuing "Australian Mythril Coins" made of stainless steel. However, chromium and nickel were scarce resources in Hainan and indeed all of China. Only when mining monazite in Wenchang did they obtain some associated chromite sand. The Manufacturing Supervisorate concentrated its technical strength to experimentally smelt a small amount, but the output was far from sufficient for industrial production. Zhan Wuya had a huge headache over this.

"It will be quite difficult, but we will try to find a way," Jiang Shan said into the phone. "We have to wait until our agents have fully established a foothold and established considerable relationships with the upper echelons of Manila before we can start. Yes, we could certainly send our own ship, but given the current situation in the Philippines, the Spanish know far more than we do. If we can get support from local Spaniards, the exploration work will be much more convenient."

Putting down the phone, Jiang Shan began to consider the next question: how to support Mr. Lando to meet the Manufacturing Supervisorate's new request.

The Parian—or Jiannei, the Chinese quarter outside the walls of Manila—was a vast expanse of low buildings made of bamboo, wood, and thatch, among which the cockfighting arena was the most eye-catching. There was another cockpit further north in Binondo mainly for Tagalogs, but it was much smaller and cruder.

The Parian originally had various gambling dens, and ever since the Governor levied a gambling tax to open up revenue sources, the gambling industry had flourished even more. Cockfighting, a game full of local color, became a gambling method that was both spectacular and sufficiently exciting. Even those not originally interested in gambling would spend a copper coin to go in and watch on a boring afternoon or evening. They were often quickly incited by the fanatical atmosphere and would lose the last "lead piece" on them. In Jiannei, one could hear every day of some wealthy merchant going bankrupt because of cockfighting or some pauper getting rich overnight from a stroke of luck.

The Parian cockpit resembled a large bamboo parrot cage, full of lattice holes so that the activity inside could be seen roughly even from the outside. Inside, wooden planks formed three tiers of seating around the perimeter, with a circular cockfighting ring in the center. The conical roof was also woven from bamboo, with several skylights opened for light and ventilation. Whenever a sudden rainstorm hit and there was no time to close the skylights, the fighting cocks in the ring and the audience in the stands all became drowned rats together. Despite this, whenever a cockfight was held in this oversized birdcage, tickets were always hard to find. Everyone had to pay an entrance fee of one copper coin, but the cockpit, which could hold more than five hundred people, was always packed. Outside stood crowds unable to squeeze in—large groups of natives, Chinese, mestizos, and white Europeans. Vendors selling drinks and snacks squeezed through the crowd, hawking their wares. The place was boiling with human voices; adding to the noise were the crowing sounds of roosters filling every corner, echoing inside and outside the arena.

Only the cockfighting ring was quiet. Several Chinese men in silk shirts walked around collecting bets. The audience threw piles of "lead pieces," countless silver coins, and Chinese silver ingots of various sizes and shapes, even small bags of gold dust. The judge arranged the bets in piles on the sand of the arena. The audience enthusiastically discussed the previous winner and vied to place bets on whose rooster would win this time.

Two Tagalog handlers entered the ring. Clearly they were old hands at cockfighting. With a few teases, the feathers of the two roosters stood straight up, their combs turned purple, and they became enraged, looking ready for a life-and-death struggle. The audience immediately erupted in noise, emotions running high.

"Another hundred pesos on the yellow one!" shouted a white European dressed in a captain's uniform. His voice was like a boulder crashing into water, sending up countless waves. The people rioted, calling out to one another, reaching out hands or clapping shoulders to indicate additional bets.

The handlers removed the leather sheaths from the chicken claws, revealing the sharp steel spurs attached behind the shanks. The whole arena fell silent. With the sound of a gong, the judge made a gesture, and both sides released their roosters simultaneously. The two gladiators spread their neck feathers, lowered their heads, and stared each other down for a long time. Suddenly, they leaped up and flew at each other. The captain let out a cheer like a beast's howl. The two roosters turned, stood facing each other with heads bowed and bodies arched, then slammed together again, fighting for three or four rounds, feathers flying everywhere. The yellow rooster swept over its opponent's head, scratching viciously with its claws not showing weakness, the white rooster counterattacked, kicking its opponent into a stumble. The white captain began to curse until the yellow rooster stood up again and lunged at the enemy with redoubled ferocity. The captain was the first to stand up, waving his arms and shouting, and the spectators who had bet on the yellow rooster with him cheered in unison. But by now nothing could be distinguished clearly. The battle entered a melee phase; the fighters bit each other's combs and twisted into a ball, now one falling, now the other knocked to the ground, bloodstained feathers flying into the air everywhere.

On the highest tier of steps, a hunched figure sat quietly, completely wrapped in a black cloak, not betting with anyone. This person didn't pay much attention to the situation in the ring, but seemed quite interested in the fanatical captain. The captain was raising his spasming fist over his head, letting out bursts of hair-raising screams. The yellow fighting cock had already fallen sideways on the ground, then struggled to stand up and limped away; after a few steps it fell again, dragging a wing, crawling slowly on the sand, leaving a long trail of blood on the ground.

The crowd erupted again, some beaming with joy, some with faces pale as death, silently handing their stakes to the winners. The owner of the defeated bird picked up the yellow rooster with head hung low. "Make it into a cold dish! This bastard cost me three hundred pesos," the captain roared, waving his fist in fury. His mania did not subside until the next pair of rooster warriors entered the ring.

The audience boiled over, because the new pair of fighting cocks were larger and stronger than the previous few pairs. When the Tagalogs attached the steel spurs to the cocks, the seats were in an uproar, and gamblers pulled out their stakes one after another. "Three hundred pesos," the captain held a bag high, "all on the red one! It'll kill that gray one for sure!" The audience whispered and chattered more noisily, and soon piles of betting money of varying heights were stacked up again around the ring.

The two Tagalog handlers put down the chickens and backed away. The fiery red-feathered cock and the slightly shorter silver-gray cock immediately fought into a ball, fluttering into the air. As soon as their claws touched the ground, they immediately pounced on each other again, sharp beaks pecking fiercely, steel spurs flashing, movements dazzlingly fast. The arena quieted down temporarily; hardly anyone had ever seen such a fierce fight in the cockpit. Suddenly, the silver-gray cock was hit; the fiery red cock drove a steel spur into its opponent's wing. Both chickens fell to the ground together, one struggling desperately to disengage the spur from its body, the other pecking relentlessly at its opponent's head, fighting to the death.

"Good! Good!" The captain shouted loudly: "Peck it to death! Stab it to death! Kill that damned sick chicken!"

The two chickens finally separated, jumped up to collide, and fell to the ground again. The fiery red cock rushed up attempting to hit its opponent, but the silver-gray cock suddenly dodged sideways, causing everyone to gasp. Before the overshooting red cock could turn around, the silver-gray cock had already attacked. They rolled fiercely on the ground, then stood up again, pecking beak to beak, beating violently with wings above and hacking rapidly with steel spurs below; then they leaped into mid-air, landed again, and resumed ground combat with blazing fury.

A few cheers erupted from the audience but were immediately drowned out by the captain's angry curses. The silver-gray cock had cut its opponent until it bled. A spreading dark patch appeared on the red cock's breast, and red feathers fell. But it beat its opponent again with powerful wings until the enemy fell, then jumped on it intending to finish the opponent off. The silver-gray cock, however, crouched, dodged, and avoided the attack with incredibly fast reflexes. The situation changed in an instant. The fiery red cock turned around and knocked the other onto its back, hitting the silver-gray cock's chest twice, leaving spots of blood on the ground. But the silver-gray cock managed to retreat, leaped into the air to dodge the enemy attack, and upon landing, struck the red cock's neck.

Both cocks were now disheveled and bloody, kicking each other with their claws, circling with heads low, looking for the opponent's weak point. The captain almost jumped up, spewing a string of frantic shouts mixing Spanish and French. As if encouraged, the fiery red cock suddenly launched a dazzling flurry of attacks, gaining the upper hand. Its wings beat the silver-gray cock violently, waving its spurs to stab the opponent until blood splattered. As usual, the silver-gray cock retreated step by step. Just as defeat seemed imminent and the captain shouted in ecstasy, it leaped into the air unbelievably, landing to drive a steel spur squarely into the fiery red cock's heart. The latter collapsed, becoming a heap of faintly quivering feathers, blood bubbling from its beak.
