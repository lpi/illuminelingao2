# Chapter 1531 - The Beginning of Art

Wu Ciren hastily pulled out a small notebook and wrote down "amplification equipment." He had thought everything was ready and only the east wind was lacking, but once the project got underway, he realized the east wind was far too scarce.

"Actually, the amplification problem is far from fully solved by voice projection and vocal training. In short, for modern pop music, the equipment gap is still too large." Liu Shuixin frowned. "It's not just your group—Dongfang's side has the same problem. Whether it's instrumental or vocal performance, without amplification equipment, it's almost meaningless."

"Didn't you say voice training can compensate?"

"That compensation isn't absolute. You know what *bel canto* is, right?"

Wu Ciren nodded.

"You see, most people don't like *bel canto*. In fact, *bel canto* is similar to traditional voice projection—both use certain vocal techniques to compensate for insufficient natural volume. But this isn't normal singing—can you imagine an opera singer or theater actress using her vocal technique to sing *21st Century Love Revolution*?"

Wu Ciren felt the image was too beautiful to behold.

It was like a bucket of cold water over his head. Wu Ciren stammered, unable to speak, too distracted even to notice the "enthusiasm" of the first singer. He finally managed to ask, "Is there any solution?"

Liu Shuixin's gaze shifted to the girl currently giving a "heartfelt performance" amid the "train wreck." She smiled charmingly. "I'm not from a science or engineering background—I only know how to sing and dance. What advice can I give you? I'm just saying: running an arts group isn't as simple as you think..."

"Big sister, why didn't you say so earlier..."

"Isn't your starting point to cultivate artistic seeds? Performance results are another matter. Besides, I'm happy to be working again." Liu Shuixin looked quite pleased.

Wu Ciren, however, was not happy at all. Although the Plaid Skirt Club project was nominally under the Cultural Propaganda Department, in reality it was a self-funded venture. In Lingao, any project not on the Planning Commission's roster faced endless difficulties and had to be solved by "running around to departments" and "running around to factories"—requiring massive investments of time and energy.

His own Traffic Police Division was already swamped with work—the National Police's traffic police were nothing like the "traffic cops" of the old timeline. They were more like the "Traffic Police Corps" of the Republican era: besides managing road traffic, they were primarily responsible for protecting and patrolling highways and railways. The patrol duties for Hainan Island's ring road alone were enough to make him cough blood.

*Need to find someone dedicated to handle this*, he thought.

Just as the third-round audition was taking place, in another room, the long-haired arts man and the one called Okamoto were huddled over several photographs, whispering about their plans.

The department officially based in this compound was the Cultural Propaganda Department's Arts Groups Management Office. In theory, all professional arts groups under the Yuan Elder Court's governance fell under this office. In practice, the only local professional arts group—the Lingao Puppet Theatre—was under the Mass Arts Division. As for the semi-professional, semi-amateur groups already established—lion dance troupes, living newspaper drama groups, choirs, and so on—they were all under Fang Fei's management.

The so-called Arts Groups Management Office had long been nothing but a name on the "institutional roster" in the Bright Office. As for private arts groups, plenty of opera troupes had come to Lingao, but troupes were itinerant—they worked a while and then moved on, with no fixed business address. All the Management Office could do was review performance repertoires and issue permits—in fact, this work had been handled by the Mass Arts Division before the Management Office was formally established.

This lack of presence only changed when some Yuanlao formally proposed to the Executive Committee the establishment of professional arts groups, and voices within the Yuan Elder Court on this matter gradually grew stronger.

The driving force behind all this was none other than the long-haired arts man, former US Ph.D. Dongfang Ke.

This Yuanlao Dongfang, who had worked successively at the Planning Commission and the Finance Commission, was quite inconspicuous in Bairenfort. Apart from regular work, military drills, and general assemblies, he almost never participated in group activities. Despite being a returnee from abroad, he had never attended Otaku Faction gatherings, nor had he ever voiced opinions on hot topics of concern to the transmigrators—such as the maidservant issue. He never posted in the internal BBS announcement forums; only in a few obscure discussion groups could one occasionally spot his posts.

At work, he had never actively sought external postings. It was said he preferred quiet solitude. On rest days, he would typically appear alone at the sports field to exercise, then head to the Farm Café wearing his oversized headphones to sip a glass of kvass and while away the time—he never visited the Wudaokou teahouse that was practically the Finance sector's exclusive haunt. Sometimes he would sit reading an e-book until closing time. Even more curious, after the Yuanlao residential district was completed, he continued to live in the Bairenfort dormitory area. (Reportedly, when someone privately asked why, his answer was that classic line: "Because it's close!") Strangest of all, no one had ever seen his life secretary. He never spoke of why he had joined the transmigration—a person with no clear aspirations was hard to understand.

His behavior could certainly be called "cool," which naturally led to being "too cool to have friends." Yuanlao Dongfang had always been a loner in Lingao—until one particular evening.

As the lights came on in East Gate Market and the cool breeze from the bay swept away the day's heat, the bronze bell of the Bopu Customs Building struck six long chimes. The cadres in Bairenfort who had been busy all day put down their paperwork. At the entrance of the Finance Directorate office building, Yuanlao departed in twos and threes, chatting about work questions or today's cafeteria menu.

Dongfang Ke, as usual, was the last to leave. Sennheiser headphones clamped over his ears, a black CD case at his waist, hands in his pockets, he strode at a rapid pace toward the Yuanlao cafeteria. The sea breeze lifted a strand of hair from his face, making this tall, thin young man in a light gray shirt and faded jeans look like a college student just out of evening study hall.

At the cafeteria entrance, someone tapped his shoulder to stop him—clearly knowing he couldn't hear a call. It was a Yuanlao he had seen but couldn't name; in fact, aside from the Executive Committee members and a few colleagues, he couldn't recall the faces of other Yuanlao. Dongfang stopped, removed his headphones, and examined the newcomer carefully. It seemed he recalled the man had worked at the Finance Commission but had been transferred after the Engine Plan. He hesitated, then asked:

"And you are? Uh, I'm face-blind as a rule—no offense."

"Ah, I'm Okamoto Shin! Also Finance sector—Social Security Division now—currently running the insurance company. You were at the Planning Commission before, so it's natural you wouldn't know me! Hehe!" The newcomer seemed relaxed, greeting him familiarly.

"Right, I think I remember now. Okamoto Shin... Are you Japanese? And called... A-Shin?" Yuanlao Dongfang looked puzzled.

A helpless expression crossed Okamoto's face. "I'm not Japanese. It's... well, it's a long story. Another time."

"Mm. What can I do for you? Are you recruiting for the insurance company? You can just submit a report to Committee Member Cheng. Changing jobs and changing tastes, that's fine. As long as I don't have to sell insurance on the street, I can handle any Finance work."

"Ah, no no! Nothing to do with work. I've been thinking about setting up a drama troupe and orchestra lately. Quite a few people have similar ideas. But our Yuan Elder Court has too many engineering otaku and not many who understand music. There's a Liu Shuixin who seems to be a song-and-dance troupe performer, but she's married so it's awkward to approach her directly. I remember you replied to my discussion post on the BBS? You're an enthusiast too, right? Interested in discussing it together? Hey, why are we standing here talking? Is this convenient for you? It's dinnertime—let's find a place to chat? The Trading Post Restaurant in East Gate Market—my treat!" Okamoto invited enthusiastically.

"Mm? The Trading Post Restaurant? Seems noisy? Let's skip that. But the drama troupe thing sounds interesting—how about we talk at my dorm instead? You can have them deliver takeout there." Dongfang Ke replied with an expressionless face and bland tone.

"Huh? Uh—well... okay... that works too." Okamoto was clearly encountering someone declining a dinner invitation for the first time and seemed somewhat at a loss, nodding mechanically.

"Right then, see you later!" Before the words faded, Dongfang had already turned and strode away. After three meters he stopped and turned back: "Do you know my dorm number? Or just call my cell phone later? The number is..." He gave a number, put his headphones back on, and walked off toward the Bairenfort Yuanlao dormitory area without looking back. Tall with long legs, he walked extremely fast; left standing there, Okamoto didn't even have time to say more. He could only raise an eyebrow helplessly and head off to the East Gate Market restaurant by himself.

Half an hour later, Okamoto walked through the gates of the Bairenfort dormitory area with a restaurant delivery boy in tow. To save himself the trouble of carrying the food box, he had to process temporary entry paperwork for the delivery boy—though all of Hainan Island was now the Yuan Elder Court's sphere of influence, necessary security procedures had not decreased. At the same time, he couldn't help grumbling to himself about Dongfang Ke's eccentricities: why cram himself into Bairenfort when perfectly good villas were available?

Following the room number Dongfang had given over the phone, he found the dormitory room. The door was unlocked, dim yellow light leaking out. Okamoto knocked twice lightly and pushed it open. He first directed the delivery boy to set out the food and wine, gave him a circulation voucher to send him off, then sat down across from Dongfang. Looking around, he found the furnishings extremely simple—all standard products from the Lingao Woodworking Factory. Only two small boxes atop the cabinet were unidentifiable—on closer inspection, they turned out to be a pair of miniature HI-FI speakers, brand indiscernible. He was secretly astounded.
