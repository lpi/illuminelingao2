# Chapter 1667 - Singing and Dancing in Peace

With a command from Chang Qingyun, five or six young servants in blue clothes and small hats came over with wine pots to pour wine. Suo Pu's sharp eyes saw clearly that under the corridor outside, a wind stove was burning, heating tin cylindrical vessels for warming wine. It was likely Jinhua wine, the most popular among officials and the wealthy. The General Office had procured quite a lot from Jiangnan; the taste was similar to yellow wine.

However, the most eye-catching items were the gleaming glass bottles on the plates: *Guoshi Wushuang* (Scholar Unrivaled).

Since its introduction, this white liquor had been widely favored. The Great Ming was not without distilled spirits, but invariably they had many impurities, went to the head easily, and were not liked by scholar-officials and the rich. *Guoshi Wushuang* used modern white liquor brewing and blending techniques—high purity, rich aroma, soft entry, pure taste, and not easy to get a hangover. coupled with the crystal-clear glass bottle, it drove wine drinkers crazy. As officials exchanged gifts, its fame quickly spread beyond Guangdong, becoming a specialty of Guangzhou. Not only was it consumed in large quantities locally, but it was also sold as far as Jiangnan and the capital. Traces of this wine were even found in the homes of Later Jin nobles in Liaodong. Although the Guangzhou Station had expanded the distillery's capacity dozens of times, it was still hard to find a bottle on the market. The black market price was more than ten times higher than the original price.

Just a rough look showed a dozen bottles of *Guoshi Wushuang* on the table, and it seemed there were more under the corridor. The Governor-General's Yamen was indeed generous, worthy of a high official commanding eight seats!

"Come, please drink." Chang Qingyun hosted attentively. Suo Pu and the others, harboring suspicion, dared not drink much and only tasted lightly. Suo Pu, afraid of revealing flaws in his speech, also refused to talk much. Seeing the atmosphere was a bit dull, Chang Qingyun gave a wink. A pure guest (professional companion) named Mei Lun, who specialized in amusing people in the Governor-General's residence, understood immediately. He stood up laughing:

"Sitting and drinking in boredom is no fun." He readily rolled up his sleeves to pour wine for everyone, laughing: "Why not listen to some fashionable tunes..."

He immediately ordered: "Call the singers up!"

Two singers came in from the corridor. Both were young boys of fifteen or sixteen, looking like carved jade and powder. They entered, knelt and kowtowed, then stood aside with legs together. Mei Lun laughed: "Today we have distinguished guests from Nanjing here. Sing the tunes you are best at."

The two young boys quickly agreed. One played the zither and the other the pipa, first singing a set of songs. Although Suo Pu could understand Nanjing Mandarin now, this tune was not in the rhyme of Jianghuai Mandarin, nor was it the same as modern Cantonese opera or Kunshan style. He felt lost in the clouds, barely understanding a few words. Lin Ming and Xie Peng, however, listened intently. Judging from the reactions of those present, the singing was probably quite good.

After the song ended, everyone applauded. Mei Lun laughed: "Indeed." Saying so, he rewarded them with a cup of leftover osmanthus tea from the table:

"Drink it, then pick songs you are familiar with to serve the masters."

The two agreed, drank the tea, wiped their mouths with handkerchiefs, and played the pipa again, singing a set of "Sheep on the Mountain Slope." Everyone at the table cheered, and the atmosphere became lively. Suo Pu didn't know what was good about it, so he kept silent. Chang Qingyun saw this and understood seventy to eighty percent in his heart.

"Wait, truly rare beauties in the world." A semi-old man looked at the two singing boys with lustful eyes, "Truly a song that can crack stones..."

"What do you know of their wonders? These two children were bought by General Feihuang from Fujian to serve the adults," Chang Qingyun laughed. "You all know General Feihuang's generosity. Pity, his ambition unfulfilled, he was harmed by the Australian thieves."

Hearing the words "Australian thieves" (Kun thieves), although Suo Pu pretended to be nonchalant, a look of focus appeared on his face. Chang Qingyun nodded slightly—that was it!

A private secretary beside them laughed: "What wonders? Master Mei, do tell."

Mei Lun said: "The Buddha says: cannot say, cannot say. Just now Master Xianhe called them 'rare beauties' (You Wu)—you just think on that..."

The people at the table laughed loudly. Suo Pu was very confused, not knowing what was so funny.

This Master Xianhe, although having gray hair and beard, was very active. He laughed: "Drinking is boring. Master Mei's 'You Wu', I think makes a good couplet. Let's make couplets to add to the fun!"

"'You Wu' is easy to match," a private secretary looked sideways at the two singing boys, "'Xiang Gu' (Elephant Lady / Boy Prostitute) fits perfectly."

As soon as the words fell, the whole room burst into laughter. The two singing boys also blushed, pretending to be silly and angry: "Masters are just making fun of us lowly ones." Saying so, they came over with long sleeves and delicate hands to pour wine and serve dishes for the guests one by one. The accompanying guests were all active now. Some flirted shamelessly with the singing boys, some simply groped them up and down, and some directly held them in their arms insisting on a "skin cup"... The young boys were adept at these tricks, smiling fawningly and coquettishly urging wine. Some simply sat in their laps, pulling beards and tugging ears to force wine down. For a time, cups and chips were exchanged, and laughter and talk were joyous. Suo Pu dared not drink much, only sipping a little to keep company.

Because of his wound, Lin Ming did not drink wine, only tea, and picked light dishes to eat. Seeing Master Xianhe pulling a young boy and not letting go, knowing he must have the "cut sleeve" (homosexual) fetish, he just smiled. Seeing a young boy swaying and twisting his waist coming to toast Suo Pu, afraid the Chief would turn hostile in public and make a mess, he whispered: "Just respond superficially, don't be stern."

Suo Pu nodded slightly. When the boy reached him, holding the wine with a handkerchief to Suo Pu's lips, he said娇ly: "Master Suo, Master Suo... you are the main guest today, you must open your capacity and drink a few more cups..." Seeing his slender figure and boundless amorous feelings, truly more womanly than a woman, with waves of faint fragrance attacking, although knowing he was a man, Suo Pu's heart couldn't help swaying, and he drank the wine.

He drank it, but felt disgusted as if he had eaten a fly.

Mei Lun watched the main guest Suo Pu while joking. The other party looked impatient, with contempt in his eyes—clearly, this Master Suo was not interested in this pair of "toys." If the teasing went too far, it would be boring. Just then, the chef came to cut and offer the main dish, so he took a plate of white flour steamed cakes, a plate of crystal goose, a plate of pickled fish slices, and a bowl of sour bamboo shoot shrimp ball soup from the table and rewarded the young boys. The two kowtowed thanks, took the plates out, and knelt under the corridor to eat.

Mei Lun clapped his hands: "Yun Dang, why not come out to serve?"

With the call, a woman responded softly and lifted the curtain to enter. When everyone looked, they saw Yun Dang wearing a pink gauze shirt, a dark green flowing skirt below, dark clouds of hair piled high, green silk curling, two curved willow-smoke eyebrows slightly frowned between her brows, seeming worried yet happy, glancing around—everyone's spirit was refreshed. Chang Qingyun couldn't help praising loudly: "What an apricot blossom face, like a lotus in water!" That Yun Dang smiled sweetly at Lin Ming, almost hooking away his three souls and seven spirits. She sang melodiously:

"Magnolias fallen, wind and rain hasten, courtyard bleak. Spring comes long, music lazy to press, wine counters lazy to hold. Resigning orioles and thanking swallows, ten years of dreams broken in the blue tower, idleness follows willow catkins still lingering. Hard to find an old soulmate, entrusting the lute heart to rewrite. Enchanting, remember holding hands, by the herb-fighting rail, under the flower-buying curtain. Watching the pulley turn low, the swing high. Now where is it? Even with round fan and light shirt, with whom to ride the Zhangtai horse? Looking back at twilight mountains green, separation sorrow comes again."

Lin Ming looked at the graceful dancing posture, feeling in a fairyland, and couldn't help saying: "Ten years a dream in Yangzhou, winning a fickle name in the blue towers."

Chang Qingyun laughed: "This was sung impromptu by a songstress when friends accompanied me to tour the Qinhuai River in Jinling last year. Although it is a work by Mister Ji Di (Gao Qi), sung a hundred years later, it is still an old dream of Qinhuai." He spoke as if with emotion.

After the song and dance, Yun Dang curtsied. Just as she was about to withdraw, Chang Qingyun said: "Heard you practiced a few fashionable new tunes the other day. This Master Suo is a distinguished guest; sing a few specifically for him."

"Yes, slave knows," saying so, she ordered someone to bring a pipa, sat on an embroidered stool, strummed a few times, and chanted:

"Under the small peach branch trying on silk clothes,
Butterfly powder fighting remaining fragrance.
Jade wheel crushing fragrant grass,
Half face annoying red makeup."

Her singing voice was melodious, crisp yet soft, charming with three parts vigor. The singing lingered around the beams without ceasing. The guests at the table were all intoxicated. Yun Dang played the pipa while singing with expressive gestures and eyes:

"Wind suddenly warm, sun beginning to lengthen, slender weeping willows.
A pair of dancing swallows, ten thousand points of flying flowers, ground full of setting sun."

After the song, Master Xianhe laughed: "This lyric is truly romantic and graceful, enough to succeed the Later Ruler of Southern Tang, truly uniquely gifted by Heaven. Unexpectedly, Mister Maozhong (Chen Zilong), wrote lyrics so sentimental and touching, with natural charm. Truly rare!"

Suo Pu didn't know who Mister Maozhong was, but this lyric sounded like ordinary romantic verse, what was rare about it? While pondering, someone said: "Mister Maozhong's poetry is quite different, simply like two different people. Recently, this student just got a new work of his..." Sayin go, he chanted:

"Immortal talents lonely both leisurely, literary garden desolate all ancient mounds. Han style in former years praised the North, Chu wind today fills the Southern Prefecture. Can elegant music spread in Jade Sea? Just left subtle words to play in Jade Tower. Quite weary of withered sentences in the human world, cutting clouds and shearing moon to paint three autumns."

Everyone nodded in praise. Suo Pu couldn't hear the beauty in it, so he had to continue sitting blankly with a poker face. The people at the table became interested, and one by one, struck by poetic inspiration, started discussing poetry.

...

"Writing lyrics is hardest in modern style (Jinti), level tones (Ping) where oblique (Ze) shouldn't be, oblique where level shouldn't be. One slip in adhering to rules, not only is it awkward to read, but how can one afford to lose face?"

"You are wrong there: poems often use level and oblique interchangeably. Lu Fangweng's 'Burning ash to remove vegetable locusts', 'Huang' (locust) is used as an oblique tone; 'Do not break the red fragrant tree, but know to look with full intent', 'Dan' (but) is used as a level tone; Li Shanfu's 'Yellow Ancestor doesn't pity the parrot guest, Zhi Gong is partial to the kirin son', 'Qi' (kirin) is strangely an oblique tone! Han Yu's 'Yueyang Tower' poem 'Universe narrows and hinders', 'Fang' (hinder) is actually read as 'Fang' (visit), Bai Juyi's 'Replying to Minister Linghu' poem 'Benevolent wind fans the road, dark rain greases the pavilion gate', 'Shan' (fan) is a level tone! Li Shangyin's 'Stone City Poem' 'Bamboo mat ice about to float pillow, curtain warmth doesn't hide hook', self-note 'Bing (ice), returning tone'..."
