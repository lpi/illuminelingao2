# Chapter 1386 - Smear Him

Cao Guangjiu was nothing surprising. The first time Gou Chengxuan saw him, he knew he was a member of the "Broken Boots Party"—although Lingao didn't have this term, he was of the same feather. Back then, Gou Chengxuan was cursed by those Lingao literati as a disgrace to the scholars.

"Saying I'm a disgrace, yet you group of people surrendered to the bandits one by one!" When Gou Chengxuan woke up at midnight, feeling pained by his fallen state, he always thought of those Lingao literati who cursed him and his father back then. He hated the bandits even more for not recognizing talent, actually not coming to recruit his Gou family first—insisting on colluding with those salt dogs.

In fact, his family had no psychological burden regarding surrendering to the bandits. It was just that the bandits farmed his family as wild monsters first, making it impossible for the Gou family to surrender and sell out the country even if they wanted to. Now it had become a national enmity and family hatred, painfully feeling "no door to sell the country."

This strong sense of loss coupled with his own downfall made Gou Chengxuan harbor intense hatred toward the bandits, determined to fight them to the death.

It wasn't his first time coming to where Hao Yuan stayed. This person was very strange: clearly living in a stinking slum, yet the room was kept meticulously clean.

He behaved elegantly, loved cleanliness, could read and write, and spoke with big principles nesting small principles, his essays on heavenly principles and human feelings watertight... Gou Chengxuan believed he wasn't some "weaver," but from a scholar background.

It was just that this scholar was too different. He didn't show off that he was a scholar, yet could dwell in such a difficult environment—one must know that his master gave him ten taels of silver for personal expenses every month. As for expenses used for "affairs," there were also dozens of taels every month. In recent months, there were even times with several hundred taels of silver.

In a time when the concept of taking a thirty percent cut was deeply rooted in people's hearts and was even an open rule—even large gentry households tacitly accepted their servants taking kickbacks and inflating numbers when purchasing—Hao Yuan could very well take some personal benefits from the silver passing through his hands.

Even if he was truly very lofty and unwilling to profit from it, ten taels of silver monthly expenses were enough for him to find a decent house in the city and find a woman to serve him—one must know that a private secretary in a yamen only had an annual salary of hundred and twenty taels.

Hao Yuan, however, didn't care at all about living in this broken house. Every day he ate rice mixed with coarse grains, and the vegetables were sent by villagers from nearby villages—he usually wrote letters and contracts for villagers and read government announcements.Speaking of meat, it was the cheapest stinking fish and rotten shrimp from the riverside; he had never been seen eating meat.

Gou Chengxuan had secretly sent people to inquire about Hao Yuan here. He knew his reputation among the surrounding poor was very good; everyone respectfully called him "Mr. Hao."

Hao Yuan usually acted as a "scribe" for people. Not only was his handwriting good, but the content was also comprehensive and appropriate. Some people came to ask his opinion when encountering difficult problems, and he could always give very suitable suggestions. He also actively walked out to visit various households in their broken houses. Sometimes when someone was sick and the family didn't have enough hands, he would guard there all night. If there was no money for medicine, he would pay out of his own pocket. Whoever had a difficult hurdle to cross, he always helped as much as possible.

Common people's hearts were the most honest. Whoever was sincere to them, they would give their hearts to. Hao Yuan was the "saint" in their minds. They liked him, respected him, and trusted him more and more. He had very high prestige in the entire Nanxiawa.

Gou Chengxuan was very uneasy about this person—he believed in "every man for himself, and the devil take the hindmost." He, Gou Chengxuan, had also suffered great hardships and tribulations, but that was forced helplessness. It was hatred supporting his struggle until now for revenge. Moreover, as long as conditions permitted, he would absolutely not let go of the silver delivered to his hand and the opportunity to enjoy himself properly.

A person with no desires, not coveting wealth and enjoyment, content with poverty, yet willing to be kind and helpful to others everywhere, could only mean his ambitions were huge—Gou Chengxuan had read a few history books after all. He mentioned this to his master many times, but his master was always noncommittal, dismissing it with a profound, unfathomable smile, leaving him confused. Perhaps it could only be said that what superiors and inferiors could understand was different?

Sometimes, Gou Chengxuan even felt with envy: the master and Hao Yuan seemed more able to understand each other. This impression became deeper during his few contacts with him. Although Hao Yuan claimed to be a weaver by origin, his attitude in speaking was always neither humble nor arrogant, with determination and confidence revealed in his gentleness. It was completely not the style of people from humble origins who were either subservient, daring not say a word, or acted like they had eaten gunpowder, choking people at every turn.

"...Master's intention is that the Rice Riots matter must continue, and the momentum must be made bigger." Gou Chengxuan continued to convey the master's intent, "Not only make noise, but also expand the scope—especially the other counties of Suzhou Prefecture, connecting the Rice Riots into a whole."

A look of worry appeared on Cao Guangjiu's face, but Hao Yuan remained calm, thought for a moment and said: "This matter is not difficult. Although Suzhou Prefecture didn't suffer disaster last year, the common people's days are not easy either. This year's income from sericulture was also greatly damaged by Zhao Yingong. Moreover, there is a large influx of flood refugees from North of the River and Shandong. These people are all powder kegs; a fuse will light them."

"Then we will have to trouble Mr. Hao."

Hao Yuan smiled: "How can I accomplish things alone? It still relies on Master's help! The matter is easy, only it requires Master Cao's help."

Providing manpower was Cao Guangjiu's business. Cao Guangjiu was very familiar with the brawling societies in Suzhou and Hangzhou. A greeting could find a group of people. Every time there was a Rice Riot, it was this group of people mixing in the crowd acting as support. Whether inciting clamor or storming rice shops, they were the ones taking the lead.

Cao Guangjiu coughed: "Manpower is no problem. Anyway, there's money to take. Why would these living ghosts be unwilling? It's just that with such great momentum, the yamen will pay attention sooner or later. If unluckily a few are caught and interrogated strictly one day, these people aren't righteous heroes. A few words might implicate us..."

Gou Chengxuan smiled: "You can rest assured completely. If this happens, I guarantee he won't make it to court."

Cao Guangjiu nodded, knowing these words were definitely not empty. He couldn't help but feel somewhat afraid in his heart—who knew if he would become one of those who "won't make it to court"?

Hao Yuan spoke up at this time: "Continuing to make the matter big, I agree. Currently, to fight for benefits for the common people, this is the only way. But making noise like this now still doesn't achieve the purpose of pointing the spearhead at Zhao Yingong. The common people don't realize the suffering they endure is the sin created by this Zhao Yingong. We have to remind everyone!"

Gou Chengxuan nodded: "You are right. Master also has this intention. Planning to issue another batch of placards..."

"Issuing placards is fine, but they must be easy to understand, preferably songs." Hao Yuan took out the sample draft of the placards Gou Chengxuan brought last time from under the bedding, saying:

"These placards are good, considered easy to understand, but still too deep for common people—how many can read? It's best to compile them into songs, catchy, easy to remember and recite, so they can spread. The content of the placards should seize on his purchasing rice to transport out for exorbitant profits and talk about it extensively." Hao Yuan said, "As for grain and pay or whatever, don't involve that—involving too many people will make them band together—we just seize Zhao Yingong, this dog in the water, and beat him soundly."

"This way, the common people will hate him to the bone."

"Just want them to hate him to the bone, to mobilize the common people to burn down Zhao Family Estate." Hao Yuan suddenly laughed, took a sip of yellow wine, and continued, "Placards don't need to be printed well. Just thin paper is fine. Print a hundred thousand or so, paste them everywhere in the prefecture and counties. Get a few people specifically to read them to the common people. It won't take ten days to spread. By then this Master Zhao will be famous throughout Jiangnan."

"Mr. Hao speaks wonderfully." Cao Guangjiu clapped laughing, "Since ancient times children's rhymes have been prophecies. If we can compile one for children to sing in the alleys of Hangzhou city, this Master Zhao probably won't be able to sleep at night hearing it."

"Exactly, that's my meaning." Hao Yuan nodded, "Rice Riots are to attract everyone's attention. Now everyone has noticed. Now we have to present public opinion—officials and gentry have noticed this matter, no worry it won't reach the emperor's hearing. Public resentment boiling, inciting civil uprising—just these two charges are enough for him to suffer. By then even if there are big shots supporting him from behind, they'll have to sacrifice the rook to save the king."

Cao Guangjiu said: "The big shots behind him are not simple..."

"Isn't it just that bunch of gentry who believe in the Cross Religion," Hao Yuan was dismissive, "Grand Secretary Xu is already sickly, likely won't survive this year. Sun Yuanhua is a mud bodhisattva crossing the river. The remaining few are all insignificant."

"There's still Fushe—"

"As long as we smear Zhao Yingong, turning him into a people's thief harming the common people, this group of Fushe people care most about reputation in the scholar forest, they won't have time to distance themselves fast enough. Even if there's collusion in secret, they absolutely won't dare to support him publicly. Besides, this is a civil uprising. Even if gentry support him to help him pass the ordeal, and the court doesn't pursue his crime, Phoenix Mountain Villa and Wanbi Bookshop will disappear in ashes. Trying to start from scratch again will likely be impossible."

Gou Chengxuan didn't think much of it—he was an outsider after all. But for Cao Guangjiu who had lived in Jiangnan for a long time and knew much about local worldly wisdom, he was secretly startled. He didn't expect this outsider who popped out from nowhere to know the situation of Jiangnan and the scholar forest so well. Don't look down on this bit of knowledge; among scholars it wasn't much, but for ordinary common people it was very rare, not to mention he claimed to be a "weaver."

"Mr. Hao is right. The key is to smear Zhao Yingong! The stinkier the better." Gou Chengxuan smiled very brilliantly, "By then even if someone burns his house and property, everyone will clap and cheer. Maybe someone will even write a novel called 'Black and White Biography'."

The three laughed loudly together.
