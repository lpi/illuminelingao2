# Chapter 1248 - Adjusting Fire

Ying Yu raised his binoculars to gaze toward Anping again. Regrettably, there were no decent vantage points here. The sand dune's elevation was only six or seven meters, merely slightly higher than Anping's city wall. From here, one could only barely see the streets inside Anping Town, unable to clearly overlook Zheng Zhilong's residence.

Ying Yu shook his head. As captain of the Army Artillery Instruction Team, he had rarely shown his face in public these past few years, devoting all his energy to artillery firing and training—although the smoothbore guns widely equipped by the Army and Navy had nothing in common with the 130mm cannons he used in the past.

This rudimentary version of a howitzer seemed almost like a toy to him, yet it was already the crystallization of the highest technology in the Senate's industrial system. From trial production to troop trials of several new muzzle-loading and breech-loading rifled guns manufactured by the Machinery Factory, he had groped along for nearly six months, basically figuring out the ballistic performance and firing essentials of these guns.

The reason he was asked to direct the artillery surprise attack for this "decapitation" of Anping was, besides his familiarity with artillery, because he was one of the very few Senators capable of conducting beyond-visual-range bombardment—naturalized citizens were out of the question. After all, until now, almost all artillery used by the Fubo Army Navy and Army fired within visual range, even high-angle fire guns being no exception.

given the range of the Trial Year 32 Battalion Gun, the entire Anping Town was within its effective fire coverage. But to accurately hit Zheng Zhilong's residence without observation was a very difficult thing to achieve.

Originally, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau spent over half a year drawing maps of Anping Town and Zheng Zhilong's residence. Drawing this map wasn't easy: infiltrating Anping was easy, infiltrating Zheng Zhilong's residence wasn't too hard, but asking these people—trained for a few months, almost illiterate—to use pacing to precisely survey a map suitable for artillery fire direction was asking too much. So Ying Yu didn't have much confidence in conducting precision bombardment using this map.

Fortunately, they also had large model airplanes. A few months ago, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau organized a flyover aerial photography mission of Anping, capturing overhead photos of the entire town. referencing on-site surveying by personnel, they drew a large-scale precise grid coordinate map based on this.

The brief appearance of the model plane caused a commotion in Anping and surrounding areas. Opinions varied for a time. Temples in Jinjiang and Nan'an explicitly or implicitly indicated this "miracle" was related to their own deities, causing a boom in incense burning. However, there were also prophecies indicating an imminent "great disaster," and some even more bluntly said the Zheng family was finished.

Although the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had no specific propaganda intent, this effect was unexpected.

With this map, he had confidence in conducting beyond-visual-range firing, but without impact observation, he couldn't correct fire. Due to limited height, observing impact points from the high ground outside the city made it difficult to accurately identify targets. Using model planes had high requirements for data transmission implementation, and model planes were too "precious" to be used frequently. After weighing repeatedly, they decided to use a clumsy method: once shelling began, temporarily erect a 9-meter high aluminum alloy folding ladder on the dune top, fixed with guy ropes. An observer would climb to the top to observe.

Ying Yu directed the team members to dig a pit, set up the gun, carefully mark the position with positioning stakes after verifying the calibration position. The movement amplitude of a carriage-recoil gun was too large; position changed significantly after each shot, making precise parameter correction difficult. Although the Trial Year 32 Battalion Gun installed a friction plate recoil system, it wasn't a true recoil-operated gun after all. The gun body still moved slightly after firing. Ying Yu tried many times and finally adopted this crude method to solve it.

After settling the gun position, he checked the gun's position, angle, and direction again against the map and compass points. Several team members puffed and panted moving ammo boxes to his side, opening them one by one. Ying Yu took out a HE shell, installed the detonating fuse, loaded it into the breech, then inserted the brass cartridge case acting as a gas seal. He closed the breech block, inserted the friction primer. Only when he deemed everything appropriate did he make an "OK" gesture.

Team members began pulling camouflage nets over the gun and fortification. Water was sprinkled in front of the muzzle. Xue Ziliang squinted at the gradually breaking dawn sky, estimating the timing to start shelling. There were 40 shells prepared for the Zheng residence, half HE, half shrapnel. The plan was to first bombard the Zheng residence with HE shells, blowing the people inside into panic and flight. Then cover the fleeing crowd with shrapnel fire for indiscriminate killing. Although the casualties would definitely be mostly servants, there was no doubt several important Zheng family figures could be killed.

Once the Zheng residence fell into chaos, the Navy would unfold bombardment on Anping, inevitably forcing the Zheng family's main figures to open the city and flee. At that time, the sniper teams distributed on main roads could start a massacre.

Xue Ziliang checked his watch; it was now 4:50 AM. The radioman reported: all teams sent the "in position" signal. His spirits rose, beginning to check defenses around the sand dune—they weren't using smokeless propellant; white smoke would quickly expose the gun position, so preparations for enemy counterattacks from the city had to be made.

At 5:12, a dull cannon sound came from afar, not much louder than distant thunder. Xue Ziliang and Ying Yu involuntarily looked toward Weitou Bay: It finally started!

Cannon sounds became denser; black smoke began to appear on the horizon. Although Xue Ziliang didn't know the specific battle situation, fragments of words from headquarters indicated the battle was going very smoothly—of course, it was unlikely not to be smooth; in Xue Ziliang's view, this was simply bullying.

Through binoculars, commotion started on the Anping city wall. According to team reports: Anping Town's four gates were currently closed tight, no one entering or leaving.

"From now on, closely monitor entrance and exit at Anping. Shoot any scattered individuals entering or leaving," Xue Ziliang ordered on the walkie-talkie. "Report abnormal situations immediately."

Although he couldn't see the situation inside the city clearly, bells and drums soon sounded in unison inside, seemingly rallying personnel. Followed by the woo-woo sound of horns. Soldiers on the wall ran around like headless flies. Soon, the entire Anping wall was manned by defenders.

The fleet beneath Anping City also became tense; Xue Ziliang noticed the ships instantly bustled with activity.

Xue Ziliang knew: armies in the medieval age rarely risked marching at night. So even if Anping wanted to reinforce Weitou, they would have to wait until dawn. That meant fleet reinforcements would be at least until 5:30. The Army would be even later—medieval army mobilization levels were very low; unable to dispatch troops in haste. Let alone commanders who received no news beforehand would be indecisive due to inability to judge the situation.

Cutting communications between Anping and various locations so the main Zheng commanders couldn't confirm the front-line situation was the most effective action to delay and disrupt their tactical deployment.

"Put up the ladder!" At Xue Ziliang's command, several team members immediately erected the aluminum alloy folding ladder. This ladder stood 9 meters high when fully unfolded. Team members secured it with four guy ropes. An observer with binoculars and a walkie-talkie hanging from his neck scrambled up, hands and feet working together, to the top of the ladder. ignoring the ladder's swaying, he straddled the very top, observing the situation inside Anping Town with binoculars.

Though chaos reigned in the town, there were no signs of concentrating large-scale troops—obviously the Zheng family hadn't judged the situation to make a resolve yet. Xue Ziliang felt the opportunity was just right and waived his hand immediately: "Commence action!"

Ying Yu knelt on one knee, pulled the lanyard. The 70mm gun bucked back violently. The friction plate recoil system played its role; the gun's recoil amplitude was very small. The shell roared into the sky accompanied by thick white smoke. Those following the shell's trace saw the arced trajectory fly high over the Anping wall, falling toward the Zheng residence.

"Reset!" he shouted. Two team members pushed the wheels, staring at the marks made, pushing the gun back to its original position.

Ying Yu opened the breech block. The scorching brass cartridge case ejected from the chamber. He took the second shell handed by a team member, quickly completing the second loading. He waited for the observer to report the first shell's impact point. He planned to use 4 shells to correct the aim point, estimating each shell would explode after 15 seconds of flight. After calibrating the impact point, he would conduct rapid fire at a rate of one round every 10 seconds.

*If only it were a mortar.* He felt a little regret: 2 seconds a round was no problem for a mortar. Although mortars were an infantry support specialty, unrelated to his artillery specialty, at least ballistics were related.

The first calibration shell hit the street in front of the Zheng residence. The explosion raised a ball of fire, bricks and stones flying, killing several pedestrians on the street on the spot. Tiles on nearby houses were shaken off, smashing to pieces.

Based on the observer's report, Ying Yu rotated the elevation adjustment handle, raising the muzzle slightly, and fired the second shell.

The second shell directly hit the roof of the sedan hall, blowing a big hole in the roof, tiles from the eaves flying in all directions.

Sweat began to appear on Ying Yu's forehead. He glanced at the map coordinates, hands adjusting elevation and azimuth handles together. The third shell banged out of the bore.

The coordinates of the third hit came over the walkie-talkie. The shell landed on the designated target: a water column rose from the pond in the backyard of the Dunren Pavilion, used by Zheng Zhilong for official business. Several ornamental waterfowl were flipped into the sky by the blast wave.

Ying Yu looked at the map again, knowing he had roughly calibrated the target. He turned the handles slightly again. The fourth shell directly hit under the veranda of the Dunren Pavilion's front courtyard, killing several attendants and personal guards waiting for orders on the spot.
