# Chapter 1400 - Speaking One's Mind

Xihua was startled. Although Jia Le had said several times that Master's money "came uncleanly," Jia Le was a child, what she said was merely repeating others' words like a parrot. Where could she have Hao Yuan's well-grounded arguments and strict logic. These words ruthlessly hit the question deep in her heart she had been unwilling to probe deeply: Is Master good or bad after all?

"What does this have to do with you?" Under fright, Xihua couldn't help saying.

"The world belongs to people of the world, not to the Master surnamed Zhao!" Hao Yuan's momentum was pressing, pressing step by step, "Without common people's farming and weaving, where do food and clothing of world people come from? These are all fat and blood of millions of common people. Since I am a commoner, it has to do with me!"

"You are crazy!" Xihua had forgotten attitude she should have, which was slowly changing attitude, slowly expressing she accepted Hao Yuan's view. Unexpectedly opponent's words were like storm and rain, impacting her thinking to crumble. She was after all only a fifteen-year-old girl, for a moment unexpectedly didn't know how to respond well.

Hao Yuan smiled coldly: "Whether I am crazy or not, will be clear in future." He lowered voice continuing, "Miss Xihua, you are person read books, understanding reason. I also heard your righteous act of stepping forward back then, knowing you are a marvelous woman with benevolence and righteousness. So today specially came to visit personally. If you really want Hao's head, Hao absolutely won't resent you either."

Xihua stood up, sat down again: "You speak, exactly what matter?"

Hao Yuan said seriously: "Miss Xihua..."

Zhao Yingong raised eyebrows, frowned saying: "He really said so?"

"Yes, servant dares not speak wildly." Xihua stood in front of him, seemed somewhat soul unsettled.

This child was still too tender. Zhao Yingong looked at her soul-lost appearance, sighed secretly in heart.

However, content Xihua reported to him today made him secretly shocked: Who was this Hao Yuan? This set of rhetoric was of course not worth mentioning in modern society, but in 17th century Ming Dynasty it was absolutely not what ordinary scholar could summarize—at least had to be master like Huang Zongxi.

At this moment Huang Zongxi was still a young man. His theory would explicitly take shape gradually only when failing anti-Qing in middle age and concentrating on writing. Could this Hao Yuan be some unknown genius? His interest in Hao Yuan became stronger.

Lobbyist coming out was so formidable, figure behind didn't know how powerful. A layer of cold sweat couldn't help appearing on Zhao Yingong's back. Looked like crisis he faced was far bigger than estimated.

Matter came to this, could only take one step look one step. Urgent priority was still finding black hand behind scenes as soon as possible. This Hao Yuan was absolutely not a small figure under opponent leader. If could open breakthrough from him, catching all in one net wasn't difficult matter.

"You can agree to him, plot slowly." Zhao Yingong instructed Xihua, "You are doing very well now."

"Yes, thank Master."

"You must do attentively. Safety of Villa up and down, all pinned on you alone. You must behave yourself well. Must not fail my trust."

"Yes, servant definitely won't disgrace mission." Xihua lowered head, said in low voice.

"Chief," Zhao Tong waited until Xihua retreated out, then quietly came in from another small door, "People sent to stare at Hao Yuan were intercepted!"

"Intercepted?!" Zhao Yingong couldn't help eyelid jumping. Although secret system under him couldn't compare with Lingao one, also counted as elite soldiers and strong generals, never suffered setback before.

"Correct, it's peers!" Zhao Tong's expression was also very nervous, "Looked like people from several Security Bureaus in capital!"

People under Zhao Tong were mostly from Qivei Security Bureau system. Although Security Bureau operation differed north and south, basic mode, acting methods had no difference.

Zhao Yingong kept wooden face not speaking. People from capital Security Bureaus! Matter seemed increasingly complex. Since opponent's subordinates had people from capital Security Bureaus escorting, showed opponent very likely was big shot from capital.

Could it be some big shot in court? Or lawless imperial relative family? But such secret conspiracy, what did they plot for?

If wanting to force him to offer property, then should be like Guangzhou Station back then, courtesy first soldiers later. Moreover Zhao Yingong somewhat understood these people, that was mostly confident in own power very much. To him such a small Xiucai, completely didn't need to use such complex conspiracy.

Xihua retreated out, eyes not closed for a night. Once closing eyes would recall Hao Yuan's voice and appearance, seemed he was still talking with assurance before eyes. Waking up early next morning, body extremely tired, but matters in Villa couldn't be left behind for a day, proped up body to do things again.

Passed a few days like this. This day, she was inspecting progress of new classroom project at Charity School construction site. She was upset for her task these days. Hao Yuan's words almost lingered in her heart all the time. On one side, was Zhao Yingong's "heavy responsibility of maintaining Villa."

She felt she already let down Zhao Yingong, thus she didn't tell Zhao Yingong the last paragraph of words Hao Yuan told her about why poor people suffered poverty—Hao Yuan specially told her a sentence when leaving: "This is secret between us."

From this sentence, she intuitively felt Hao Yuan actually knew she was a bait. However, knowing she was a bait, still "walking towards tiger mountain" coming to Villa to persuade her, made her moved a few points more.

Two things mixed together, making her sleep and eat uneasily day and night. Originally that pride of seeing refugees, refugee children taken in Cihui Hall having food and clothing also disappeared completely.

Xihua walked a circle along construction site. Her identity not like ordinary people. Refugee laborers on site separated automatically one by one, looking at her with expression of awe and gratitude. This made her mood even more chaotic.

Finally finished walking, sat down in a room not far from construction site, drank mouthful of tea to refresh mind. Suddenly saw Hao Yuan walking over with smile—he still dressed like that day, look of senior assistant of big shop.

"Miss Xihua always well?"

"Well." Xihua nodded. Didn't know why, she now was both a bit afraid and a bit wanting to see this man.

Thinking he could risk strange danger for her, repeatedly coming to meet. How much weight was this on herself?

Thinking here, cheeks couldn't help but be somewhat hot.

"This is new goods arrived mentioned some days ago, please Miss Xihua look over." Hao Yuan's smile was same as assistants' smile exactly, extremely attentive.

Xihua took over sample book he handed up, opened pretending to read, whispered: "Why you come again?"

"Miss Xihua unwilling I come?"

"Even if you can speak flowers falling from sky, do you have ability to change heaven and earth?" Xihua suppressed tension in heart strongly, drinking tea asked.

"I naturally don't have."

"Then Great Benevolence Great Righteousness Way, reason of letting poor people turn over you said, just castle in air, fishing moon in water. Where to talk from?"

Hao Yuan smiled faintly, opened a page: "Miss please look here, this straw sandal is extremely good, price also cheap, just suitable for Miss here to use. Price can be discussed..."

Waiting until approaching people went far, Hao Yuan then continued: "...World common people suffering exploitation, not just one day. Wanting to turn heaven and earth, how can one person one generation do?" Hao Yuan's smiling face completely different from tone of his speech, "In past Zhu Taizu rose from absolute poverty, finally established Great Ming. However what difference between Great Ming and Great Yuan? Common people suffer same." He chanted slowly, "Peaks gather like gathering, waves angry like rage..."

Zhang Yanghao's Nostalgia at Tong Pass wasn't unfamiliar to Xihua from scholar family. When reading it back then only felt vicissitudes of world affairs. However hearing Hao Yuan read now, feeling was completely different. Associated with own life experience, couldn't help heart souring, eyes already wet.

Just at this time, suddenly servant came to ask for instruction. Xihua asked in three words two phrases, either rejected or approved, handled properly in just a cup of tea time.

Hao Yuan then continued:

"Although you have brocade clothes jade food now, holding great power in this Phoenix Mountain Villa, doing many big things for Zhao Yingong, seemingly trusted heavily, scenery boundless—how many young ladies of big households can't do. Not to say rich family thousand gold daughters, even many men running business outside, how many can match you? However seeing Zhao Yingong you still have to kneel on both knees, mouth claiming servant..." Hao Yuan gave her a meaningful look, "He Zhao Yingong indeed did countless good deeds, saved countless lives, yet wants crowd to sell body as slaves to repay him. You think about how much silver is per picul of raw silk coming out of filature. Female workers inside are all Villa slaves, labor silver and food clothing given are tiny... You say he is Great Benevolence Great Righteousness, or selfish self-benefiting?"

"If he doesn't open factory, doesn't take in slaves? Wouldn't all starve to death alive?" Xihua resisted weakly.

"Correct, he did good deeds, saved lives of countless people. But he did good not for benevolence righteousness, just for his own private profit. Like doing business, everyone is selling, he Zhao Yingong buys. Only he Master Zhao is big household. How to sell, sell for how much money all said by him. Whoever unwilling to sell, just starve him to death alive."

Xihua's face became dull. Hao Yuan struck while iron hot: "Liu Ya'er in filature, you know."

"Know, a very bitter child. Family land taken by creditor, no way out whole family committed suicide. Just she alone saved by neighbor, then sent here."

"Liu Ya'er family was sericulture household, originally passable, absolutely not reaching point of land being taken. All because of a Harmonious Purchase Order from government causing bankruptcy, no way out whole family suicide. Do you know whose idea this Harmonious Purchase Order was?!"

Xihua only felt sky spinning earth turning before eyes. She hurriedly supported body—this matter, she vaguely heard some rumors, saying this year Hangzhou Prefecture disaster relief done well, all thanks to Master as Famine Relief Bureau committee member giving idea to Prefect, raising large sum of silver.
