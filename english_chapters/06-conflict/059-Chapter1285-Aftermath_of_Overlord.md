# Chapter 1285 Aftermath of Overlord

Zheng Zhilong's death was like a heavy bomb dropped on the entire Fujian Province and even the southeast coast. The news was so shocking that few people noticed the destruction of Zhangzhou Bay.

In the past decade or so, Zheng Zhilong had strived for hegemony on the sea and experienced countless rough seas. Although he also had major setbacks such as being lured into capture by the Dutch and Li Kuiqi's split, he had always been invincible on the sea with the support of Xiong Wencan. From a small smuggler, he leapt to became a great sea merchant, a guerrilla general of the Great Ming, and the "Great Wall of Eight Mins". Wherever the Zheng character flag pointed, everyone bowed to the wind.

Now, this monster on the East Asian sea surface, the invincible young sea lord, crashed down in a battle of just one day. When the news came, everyone who received the news was shocked, followed by doubts.

Did Zheng Zhilong really die?

Messengers and spies sent by various parties went everywhere, rushing to Anping, Xiamen and other places one after another.

Fujian Governor Zou Weilian received the news on September 25th. In fact, on the second day of D-Day, he received the news that "sea bandits invaded Zhongzuosuo", but he didn't pay attention to it—the area around Zhongzuosuo was Zheng Zhilong's base camp. Although he was not loyal enough to the Great Ming, he had always been very concerned about the safety of the Eight Mins. Liu Xianglao's attack on Min'an was also defeated by him leading the army. Now that they were attacking his old nest, Zheng Zhilong would definitely fight to the death.

Unexpectedly, the subsequent news became worse and worse. Local officials in Jinmen and Xiamen sent emergency messengers one after another to report that the sea bandits were powerful, the Zheng troops were completely defeated in Jinmen and Xiamen, and people and horses were fleeing to the mainland. They requested troops to be sent quickly to suppress the routed troops.

Today, he received the most shocking news since taking office: Zheng Zhilong was killed in action!

The news of Zheng Zhilong's death was informed by a letter written by Zheng Zhifeng:

...The *Kun* thieves crossed the sea to invade Zhongzuosuo and Anping County seat, advancing on both water and land. Duke Zheng led troops out of the city to meet the enemy and recruited death-defying soldiers to fight hard, gaining quite a lot of beheadings and captures. However, the bandit soldiers used repeating fire muskets and set off giant cannons. Duke Zheng drew his waist saber to engage in battle and fought his way in, killing more than ten people. He was hit by several bullets but still shouted and fought酣ly. After being wounded in the foot by a *Kun* cannon, he still commanded at the head of the city wall without moving. When the large group of *Kun* thieves landing swarmed up, he was wounded by seven repeating fire musket shots again. Duke Zheng exhausted his strength and could not support himself, so he bowed twice to the north, untied his seal and ribbon and gave them to the valiant general Tong Tailang from the camp, saying: "I cannot come back to life. You quickly take my head and throw my body in the ditch." He died with a cry of grief.

After Duke Zheng was defeated and died, the bandits entered the city and looted greatly. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians were killed and looted. The *Kun* thieves also destroyed Zhongzuosuo and Anping County seat, and burned the civilian houses that were not completely burned. All stone pavilions and railings were destroyed; those that were too big to be destroyed were cracked with gunpowder. By this time, the two cities had all become rubble...

Zheng Zhifeng was Zheng Zhilong's brother and one of the leaders in the Zheng family who valued advice. His report had high credibility.

So, Zheng Zhilong really died in battle? Zou Weilian felt quite unbelievable, and for a moment, a mood of mixed joy and worry floated to his mind.

The joy was that he had always been worried about Zheng Zhilong being too big to fall and gradually becoming a vassal town. His predecessor successfully pacified Zheng Zhilong and cleared the Fujian ocean surface. But discerning people knew at a glance that the so-called clearing the ocean surface was just turning the numerous pirates of the past into the dominance of the Zheng family alone.

What was more worrying was that the Zheng family relied on official power to openly occupy Zhongzuosuo, recruit private soldiers, forcibly levy protection fees... and had gradually grown into an extremely huge force. This force could no longer be controlled by the Fujian Governor alone. The military situation in Liaodong was urgent, and the court discussed transferring the Zheng family navy north to reinforce, but every time it was declined by Zheng Zhilong with excuses.

He was not like Xiong Wencan, who had "kindness" and personal friendship with Zheng Zhilong—in case of improper measures, Zheng Zhilong would openly rebel, and the local forces in Fujian would simply not be able to suppress it, which would inevitably cause the entire southeast coast to rot. The current Great Ming was not like when the Emperor just ascended the throne. As the saying goes, fires are going off everywhere and smoke is rising from all directions. If he caused such a scene in Fujian again, he would mostly lose his head.

Now Zheng Zhilong was actually defeated by someone and even lost his life. While surprised, Zou Weilian couldn't help but secretly feel relieved—once Zheng Zhilong died, the Zheng family would be leaderless and bound to fall apart. At that time, it would not be difficult for him to use his skills to divide and rule them.

The worry was that the invading *Kun* thieves actually had such power to sweep the Zheng family's old nest. The future sea would inevitably be another bloody storm, and the ocean surface, which had not been peaceful for long, would inevitably fall into chaos again. If this group of sea bandits invaded various places along the coast again, it would be a major trouble for coastal defense.

He didn't care too much if it was a bit chaotic at sea and merchant ships and fishing boats were robbed and killed, but if the sea bandits frequently landed to kill and loot, the local gentry would inevitably suffer. Once the officials of Fujian origin in the capital were alarmed, his days would not be easy.

While he was hesitating, the servant brought the pond reports sent by Nan'an and Jinjiang counties. Zou Weilian opened them one by one:

Nan'an Pond Report: ...The *Kun* thieves attacked the city day and night. When the *Kun* soldiers approached the city gate and climbed the city wall, the image of Guanyin was suddenly seen in the smoke and mist. The Bodhisattva spread her sleeves, and suddenly heavy rain poured down. None of the adverse enemy's rockets, shells, and repeating guns could sound. The thieves were afraid and retreated.

Jinjiang Pond Report: ...On the 20th, tens of thousands of *Kun* thieves invaded Xiamen. Guerrilla General Zheng Zhilong fought hard to repel them but unfortunately died from gunshot wounds. The thieves then captured the city. Because of the bitter battle, they slaughtered wantonly, and no soldiers or civilians were left... Groups of *Kun* thieves looted separately and invaded Jinjiang. The people had no way to resist. The gentry in the county spent more than a thousand heavy huge sums to recruit a hundred death-defying soldiers to sneak attack the *Kun* camp at night. Each held a naked blade. The thieves were caught off guard and greatly shocked. Although the *Kun* thieves' Ferangi guns were sharp, they were all met with night soil buckets, and the *Kun* thieves' fire-lock guns all cracked. Countless, maybe a hundred or ten, thieves were killed and beheaded in the city. The thief crowd cried and abandoned their guns and cannons, carried the corpses and fled.

A bunch of nonsense. Zou Weilian thought to himself. He himself had served as the Yanping Maritime Patrol Circuit Intendant of this province and was very familiar with the coastal defense of Fujian. How could he not know the tricks of the pond reports of prefectures, counties, and guards? He estimated that in these two counties of Nan'an and Jinjiang, the *Kun* thieves just showed their faces nearby, and there were simply no "great battles" or "death battles". However, the Jinjiang battle report said that Zheng Zhilong had died in battle, which seemed to confirm Zheng Zhifeng's words.

However, at least the two counties of Nan'an and Jinjiang were not lost. judging from the pond report, the *Kun* thieves also retreated after landing and looting greatly. In this way, the great charge of losing prefectures and counties could be avoided. As for Zhongzuosuo City, a victory could be reported again to cover up this disastrous defeat—as for Zheng Zhilong's death, although it shook the coastal ocean surface, in the officialdom he was just a small guerrilla general. In these years, the deaths of commanders-in-chief, vice commanders, and assistant commanders were no longer rare.

Thinking of this, Zou Weilian already had a plan in mind on how to respond. He called his staff and asked them to write a few letters to Zheng Zhilong's people first, asking them to immediately "suppress the troops, take in the exiles, and be stationed separately in various places to await further orders."

Then he wrote letters to the magistrates of Jinjiang and Nan'an counties, ordering them to close the city gates and set up camps temporarily under the city walls to take in refugees and routed troops.

ordered the staff to write an elegy for Zheng Zhilong that was affectionate and extremely painful, to be prepared for use.

Then he summoned the adjutant and ordered him to select some meticulous soldiers of local origin from the Governor's Standard Central Battalion to quietly go to various places to inquire about the situation.

"You prepare another three hundred troops and ten ships, and stand by at the mouth of the Jiulong River. Wait for my command arrow to be issued, and you weigh anchor and go to Zhongzuosuo. When you go, the Zheng family's troops probably will have arrived. You just need to go ashore, walk around the garrison city, and come back."

"Yes!" The adjutant didn't know what medicine was sold in the Governor's gourd, but since this matter was simple and didn't require taking risks, there would inevitably be departure silver when going and reward silver upon returning, which could be considered a small fortune.

"Don't provoke the Zheng family's people. Just walk around safely and come back. I will definitely recommend you."

"Thank you, Your Excellency, for your grace!"

Next is how to deal with the Zheng family. Zou Weilian thought, now is a chance to get rid of the Zheng family. Take his life while he is sick. The Zheng family is leaderless and their power is greatly reduced. It is a good opportunity to make a move. Moreover, there are many forces in Fujian dissatisfied with the Zheng family. As rising sea merchants, the Zheng family purchased land on a large scale in southern Fujian after obtaining official status, monopolized export commodities and maritime trade, causing serious dissatisfaction among many local gentry. However, Xiong Wencan was fed full by Zheng Zhilong back then, and pacifying Zheng Zhilong was Xiong Wencan's political achievement, so this voice was suppressed when Xiong Wencan was in office. After Zou Weilian took office, many people ran to Zou Weilian through various relationships to complain. Many local officials also secretly instigated him to "punish" the Zheng family.

But getting rid of the Zheng family didn't make much sense to Zou Weilian: although it was good to please the local gentry, he still didn't dare to be clear about the extent of the damage to the Zheng family now. In case it stirred up a rebellion, the consequences would be disastrous. Furthermore, Xiong Wencan was now the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi and concurrently the Governor of Guangdong. The Emperor's favor was strong. If he made a move, it would inevitably arouse Xiong Wencan's dissatisfaction.

Anyway, the Zheng family was already greatly injured and lost the leader Zheng Zhilong. He could divide and rule them.

He thought for a while and called one of his close family servants:

"You go to the accounting room and tell them to prepare one hundred taels of silver, ten piculs of rice, dried meat, roasted chicken and dried fish, and prepare a full card of mine, and send them all to the Jinjiang County School."

The Jinjiang pond report also mentioned that many families of the Zheng clan had fled to Jinjiang and were currently being sheltered in the county school.

"After you go, try to find out which people are the Zheng clan families who fled to Jinjiang? Besides those who fled to Jinjiang county seat, where else did they flee to? Where are General Zheng's wife and young son now? Inquire about all of them clearly. You take another twenty taels of silver for use on the road, and choose a few capable ones from the servants to go with you."

"Yes, Master." The servant took the order and left.

Finally, he called his confidant staff members and asked them to discuss how to write a memorial to the court and ask for posthumous honors first. How to phrase it, how to make the "Holy Heart very comforted", concealing defeat and decorating it as merit, were all profound knowledge. In the end, a list of recommendations and requests for credit would inevitably be issued. These all had to be deliberated by the staff in advance.
