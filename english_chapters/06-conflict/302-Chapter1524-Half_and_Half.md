# Chapter 1524 - Half and Half

Inside this building—where the interior blazed with light while blackout curtains covered every window, preventing even a sliver from escaping—a few men were conversing in a second-floor room.

From their manner and dress, they were clearly Yuanlao. The room was furnished in salon style: comfortable and private. The wainscoting was made of flawless hinoki planks imported from Japan; the floor used paulownia planks from the same source. Heavy double-layer curtains hung over the windows facing the rear courtyard. In the center stood several ergonomically designed rattan armchairs with thick cushions—spacious and comfortable.

Each of the Yuanlao held a cigar. Through the curling blue smoke they discussed something. On the long coffee table before them, amid teacups and drink glasses, lay scattered albums and documents; many five-inch black-and-white portrait photographs were spread haphazardly across the surface.

A large official-kiln brush washer serving as an ashtray overflowed with cigar stubs and spent matches. Evidently, their discussion had been going on for quite some time.

"I think we'll leave it at that." The speaker was Fang Fei. As Director of the Cultural Propaganda Department's Mass Activities Division, he was chairing this meeting and thus had the final say.

"How can we leave it at that?" The respondent spoke slowly, clearly not deferring to him. "Let me say it again: this kind of thing is just a crooked path!" Though his expression was calm, his words were fierce. "It's true that the arts should follow the mass line, but don't conflate concepts—don't define the otaku line as the mass line."

He waved his arms, his long hair swaying. "Art should serve the masses—that's the cultural policy set by the Yuan Elder Court. I'll say it again: otaku culture is not mass culture—it's niche. No matter how large a proportion of Yuanlao belong to the ACG group, our arts organizations must first and foremost face the naturalized citizens and indigenous masses."

"Who says idol groups are otaku culture?" The man sitting diagonally across could not help but retort. "Let me say it again: you have a bias against idols! Thinking yourself highbrow is elitism! Self-indulgence! Your vaunted opera and serious music have zero audience in this timeline! Mass versus niche? I'd say zero audience—outside Bairenfort, no one's even heard of it!"

This man was 190 centimeters tall and probably weighed 190 pounds as well. When he raised his voice, it boomed like a bell. He wore the black uniform of the National Police—a senior Yuanlao police officer.

"The masses need correct guidance. Idol groups are a cancer of Japanese music, a major cause of Japan's overall cultural decline—a slow poison. As a vigorous, upward-striving society, we should not and cannot promote such culture..."

"Nonsense," said Dongmen Chuiyu, seated on the other side in military uniform, rising to his feet. "Idol groups aren't something from today—the 21st century. Their history goes back to the Taishō era, and they flourished in the 1970s and 80s, when Japan was hardly a declining society—quite fitting your 'vigorous and upward' standard. Would you call the Shōwa-era corporate warriors decadent? The idol boom of the 21st century was a social phenomenon caused by Heisei deflation—it's an *effect*, not a *cause*!"

Fang Fei stepped in to mediate. "Comrades, let's not get heated. Regarding cultural policy, 'let a hundred flowers bloom' is also our principle. Our goals are the same; it's just different aesthetics leading to different approaches. There's no fundamental right or wrong here..."

At this point, Yuan Ziguang, who had been silent, ventured cautiously: "Regarding cultural policy, I recall Director Wen's speech at the Literary Symposium: 'The arts should serve the Yuan Elder Court's construction and social transformation, face the masses, let a hundred flowers bloom, and shape new-era aesthetics and artistic sensibilities.' This was later written into the *Guidelines for New-Era Cultural Policy*."

This bland remark defused the tension somewhat. Yuan Ziguang turned to Fang Fei. "Director Fang, in my view, the core of this guiding ideology is one thing: shaping new aesthetics and artistic sensibilities."

Fang Fei nodded—this, like the policy Yuan Ziguang had just quoted, was a perfectly correct platitude. Everyone waited for what came next.

"To implement this core principle, we cannot simply cater to the masses in the name of 'facing the masses'—otherwise, apart from reviving a few traditional puppet shows, there'd be no need to develop new art forms at all."

"What we're discussing here today are all new art forms. Whether you consider them 'highbrow' or 'lowbrow,' fundamentally they're all new to this timeline, and all aim to shape new aesthetics and artistic sensibilities. So at the root, everyone here is on the same page, haha."

Fang Fei thought: *All that lofty rhetoric, and in the end, he's said nothing.* Still, he understood Yuan Ziguang's inclination. His words had indirectly refuted the tall, long-haired young man.

The long-haired young man was about to speak: "But—"

Then the man who had barely spoken up till now said: "Dongfang, let's just drop it. Different strokes for different folks. Resources are limited; let's not squabble over them. If we in the cultural sphere start fighting before we've even launched, it'll be a joke."

"I absolutely refuse to acknowledge that they are part of the cultural sphere..." the long-haired young man said firmly.

"We don't want to be!" the burly police officer shot back. "Is the 'cultural sphere' so great?"

"Alright, let's stop this nonsense." Fang Fei finally lost patience. He turned to Dongmen Chuiyu. "You're saying all the expenses for this group will be borne by your Yuanlao yourselves?"

"To be precise, by our Plaid Skirt Club," Dongmen Chuiyu said.

"But manpower is still centrally coordinated. After all, the people you want have all received new-style education..."

"Yes. What I want to say is that this group is essentially state-owned, serving the Yuan Elder Court—not the private property of a few of us, and certainly not a product of 'unwholesome interests.' Naturally, we still need the Executive Committee's coordination for personnel and some material support. Of course, we'll try to minimize the Yuan Elder Court's resource usage—after all, we're not exactly flush right now."

"Fine. Your project may continue. However, if there are no concrete results within one year, your permit will be revoked. You may continue to maintain the group, but there will be no further material or personnel support from the Yuan Elder Court. Do you agree?"

The burly police officer did not hesitate. "No problem!"

"What about facilities and instructors?"

"As a state-owned arts group registered with the Cultural Propaganda Department, you naturally have the same rights," Fang Fei said.

"Thank you so much..."

"As for personnel allocation—I won't speak for Yuanlao instructors; everyone should be considerate. Professional experts like Liu Shuixin have limited time and energy. Let's coordinate. As for naturalized citizens, Dongfang and Okamoto are taking the 'elite art' route; truly talented people won't be numerous. I personally think Dongfang's side should have priority in personnel selection. I don't know much about idols, but I gather that in the Eleventh District, the bar for idols is quite low. I trust your club can discover 'immovable aces' from ordinary girls..."

Yuan Ziguang interjected anxiously, "Well, that's not quite—" The others did not seem displeased by this remark; instead, they smiled. Dongmen Chuiyu inwardly sneered: *Yuan Ziguang is clueless! A fake fan fixated on costumes—he'll have to be kicked out later!* As for Dongfang and Okamoto, though their expressions were somewhat stiff, they raised no further objection.

"Well then, since everyone accepts this plan, let's allocate personnel now—that is, after all, the main topic of today's meeting." Fang Fei said. "Also, I must remind you: the Human Resources Office has given us only thirty-two full-time positions for arts groups. You each get sixteen."

"Sixteen is enough," Dongfang Yuanlao nodded. "We're not a group that relies on sheer numbers. Too many people might actually be harder to train."

"If you have no objections—" Fang Fei began, but Dongmen Chuiyu cut in: "Can non-professional amateur members join?"

"Yes. Cultivating part-time amateur cultural cadres is also a direction for grassroots cultural activities. I've already spoken with Yuanlao Yang from Human Resources; he'll give us ample support."

"That's wonderful." The Plaid Skirt Club members quickly exchanged glances. "The Executive Committee is truly wise..."

Fang Fei gave a dry chuckle. "Just make sure you deliver results soon."

"We will work hard."

Next came the selection of personnel per their agreement. Dongfang Yuanlao was confident; he quickly picked out photographs from the black-and-white images on the table.

"These girls have considerable musical talent—good sense of rhythm; potential in strings, woodwinds, and brass."

"These ones have excellent physical flexibility and coordination—natural dancers."

"And this one has a wide vocal range. Even Liu Shuixin praised her highly."

...

In truth, Dongfang and Okamoto did not have many in mind. After picking seven or eight, their pace slowed noticeably. But since they had been given sixteen slots, leaving any unfilled felt like a loss, so they rounded out the number. Then came the Plaid Skirt Club's selection—far more complicated. They huddled over a pile of photographs, examining and re-examining, choosing and re-choosing, occasionally debating in terminology that sounded utterly foreign.
