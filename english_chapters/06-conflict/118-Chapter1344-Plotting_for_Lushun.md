# Chapter 1344 Plotting for Lushun

"Since you can't get enough to eat, are you willing to follow us?"

"I am indebted to the Master for saving my life. The little one is willing to follow the Master." In fact, Mao Shisan also thought to himself: I'm already on the boat. If I say no and the other party throws me directly into the ice and snow, God knew where on the coast, wouldn't that be seeking my own death? Besides, it seemed that following the Master, I wouldn't worry about food and drink.

"Alright, you rest first. You can go up for some fresh air if you want."

After he went out, Xue Ziliang turned to the medic: "How is this kid's physical condition?"

"Please rest assured, Chief. He was just starving. Young people recover fast. After eating two full meals, he is fine now."

"When we dock next time, give him a good purification."

After separating from Mao Shisan, Xue Ziliang returned to the operation room on the poop deck. Several Senators who participated in the investigation of the sea conditions on the north coast of the Bohai Sea and the west coast of the Korean Peninsula sat down around the map table.

Three days ago, the *Haitian* sailed directly to Jinzhou Bay. Although Xue Ziliang rarely spoke on strategic decisions in the Senate, he had always been one of the main supporters of the Lüda Base as a key point for the Northeast Asia strategy in the meetings of the General Staff.

In the view of this fake foreign devil, the Lüda Base had incomparable superiority in strategic position. Most importantly, the Lüda Base could be completely controlled by their own army, instead of adopting the "militia" model in Shandong.

After Operation Engine ended, Lu Wenyuan took the opportunity to occupy the Zhaoyuan area and became the "local tyrant" with the premier strength in the area. However, Shandong was the core ruling area of the Ming Dynasty. Although the Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong were not the core area of Shandong and the government paid relatively less attention to them, they were much closer to the capital after all. It was inappropriate to directly declare obvious military power locally. It was better to adopt a method similar to Guangdong, treating it as a key infiltration area. Controlling Zhaoyuan, Qimu Island, and several islands off the coast of Dengzhou, Lu Wenyuan and the Shandong Detachment could be in an invincible position.

Historically, the Denglai area would not recover its vitality until the Qing Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty now had no power to take care of this area looted by war. As long as they didn't openly raise a flag and set up a mountain stronghold, it wouldn't be a problem to be a local emperor here for five or six years.

In comparison, the Lushun area was a suitable base for stationing troops. From here, whether threatening Tianjin and the capital of the Ming Dynasty, or Shengjing of the Manchus, the attack distance was not far, and they could get the convenience of sea transport.

"Old Xue, I agree with your view. We'd better make a move on the Lüda area early. The defense line of the Jinzhou Isthmus relying on the Fan Mountain line is very strong. Back then, the old Russians defended here to the death. Even with nearly three to one superior forces plus naval support, the Japanese only exchanged for a pyrrhic victory. And this hasn't even counted our weapon generation gap advantage." As a staunch "Progressive Faction" member, Wang Ruixiang was very dissatisfied with the Senate's long-term neglect of the northern region.

"I mean the same thing. The narrowest part of this area is only three times the total length of the Willow Palisade on Qimu Island, but the strategic depth is much greater."

Xue Ziliang opened his laptop and showed photos taken during the field reconnaissance by the Special Reconnaissance Team on the Jinzhou Peninsula a few days ago. In order not to attract the attention of the beacon towers at Lushun Fort, the *Haitian* did not burn the boiler at that time, nor did it directly scout Lushun Port. Instead, it scouted the Jinzhou Isthmus from the directions of Jinzhou Bay and Dalian Bay respectively. The results of the reconnaissance made Xue Ziliang quite satisfied. In the Ming Dynasty, there was no land reclamation from the sea, so the isthmus was narrower than in modern times, conducive to defense. Moreover, the freezing situation in winter was not too serious. If they controlled this place, it would be unrealistic for the Later Jin army to sneak across the ice.

"Some of our comrades are too conservative now. The situation is constantly changing." The speaker was named Huang Hua, a native of Heilongjiang. His aspiration when participating in the Intelligence Bureau training was to go to the Later Jin territory as a station chief. He had done business in the past, had a certain business mind, understood mechanical technology, was familiar with the geography and customs outside the pass, and knew some self-defense skills; he could speak fluent Korean and some Shanxi dialect. He was very enthusiastic about developing trade with the Later Jin and then infiltrating it.

"Rather than saying they are conservative, it is better to say they are unwilling to deal with the Later Jin—in their view, our desire to establish a stronghold in Lüda is essentially wanting to hook up with the Later Jin." Wang Ruixiang laughed, "Besides, the profit isn't that big."

"That's true, but the enemy of the enemy is an ally. Only with the wild boar of Later Jin bleeding and causing trouble for the Ming Dynasty can we engage in big developments in the south. In fact, making money by doing business with Wild Boar Skin[1] is secondary. The key is to make the wild boar skins stronger so that they can enter the pass as soon as possible, so we can avenge the Ming Dynasty."

"It doesn't matter if you say this here, but be careful of 'Heavenly Punishment' if the Han Chauvinists hear it..."

Huang Hua laughed loudly: "When I went to North Korea and Big Mao[2] to scalp goods back then, what kind of things haven't I seen? Afraid of a ball."

Xue Ziliang smiled slightly. Although he was a genuine Chinese, he didn't consider himself "Chinese", so he was not interested in this topic at all. However, he also knew that this issue was a sensitive political topic in the Senate, so it was better to get involved less. When their conversation stopped, he spoke:

Wang Ruixiang said: "My biggest worry isn't doing business. It's that some people in the Senate worry our plan is too aggressive. Dividing forces to open a base will become a burden. In fact, occupying the Jinzhou Peninsula will not trigger a large-scale conflict with the Manchus. The geographical conditions are sufficient to hinder the Later Jin army from launching a counterattack. We only need to protect ourselves there. The main force of the Later Jin won't come to gnaw on our hard bone laboriously and thanklessly. Even with the current state of the Dongjiang Army, without Kong Youde leading the way, they wouldn't dare to concentrate forces for a decisive battle. As long as we teach the Tartars a lesson once, the Jinzhou Peninsula can obtain long-term peace. If there is military danger, it would be better to say that the danger of Zhenjiang Fort is greater."

"The Dongjiang Army still has more than two hundred thousand people. It's really a pity to let these people go to the Manchus cheaply. The population of Liaodong is not small either. In a few years, when advancing into Korea, Shandong, and Beizhili, Lüda will be a very good strategic node. Our current strategic nodes are all too far south—the latitude of Jeju Island is actually similar to Jiangsu."

"We are talking lively, but Lushun is still in the hands of the Dongjiang Army right now."

"Taking Lushun is not an easy task..." Xue Ziliang said.

"Correct." Wang Ruixiang said, "But there is a Huang Long in Lushun now. If we want to attack Lushun, Huang Long has to die. According to history, he committed suicide when the Manchus broke the city, so he can be considered a hero. Dying in our hands is a bit ugly..."

Although Huang Long had no highlights in governing the army, he deserved the word "loyal martyr". If he really died at the hands of the Fubo Army, many Senators would find it hard to accept emotionally.

"It doesn't matter," Huang Hua said, "Although Kong Youde failed to surrender to the Qing in this Dengzhou rebellion, there may not be people among the Dongjiang generals who want to take this path. They are too deeply entangled with the rebels. As long as the imperial court investigates, there is only one way to go: defect to the enemy."

"What if the imperial court doesn't investigate..." Xue Ziliang felt this was too illusory.

"Then we'll give a push and make the imperial court investigate properly. So many people died in Shandong this time, can the deep-involved Dongjiang generals be whitewashed so easily?"

"Actually, Huang Long's life and death is not the main thing." Wang Ruixiang said, "The key is that we want to promote Sun Yuanhua's faction."

Although Sun Yuanhua was temporarily "retained in office" after the Dengzhou Rebellion, he had already been dismissed. Even with the activities of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and himself, whether he could remain in office was still fifty-fifty. In case he couldn't remain in office, before the new governor took office, the Senate needed to support "one of their own" locally.

Most of the people in the "Dengzhou Christian Small Group" who originally followed Sun Yuanhua were unsuitable, especially the civil officials. Although they had washed away the stain of "falling to thieves" with the help of the Senate, the charge of "losing territory" was inescapable. Even if the punishment was reduced by one degree, and they were not exiled to the army, dismissal and demotion were unavoidable.

In comparison, Zhang Tao, the former Vice General of Dengzhou Town, had the greatest hope. Although he had been dismissed, he "made contributions" in the defense of Laizhou, and not long ago was the first to "break into" Dengzhou. The credits of recovering Dengzhou and killing Li Jiucheng in battle were all counted under his name now.

Due to endless wars in the late Ming Dynasty, the imperial court relied more and more on military generals, and military generals had a tendency to become warlords. In order to drive military generals to risk their lives, the past trend of valuing civil officials over military officers had changed somewhat. As long as one could fight, even if dismissed for some crimes, it was easy to get reinstated, or even further promoted and entrusted with important tasks—Zuo Liangyu and others were dismissed after several disastrous defeats, but were all quickly reinstated and then promoted. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau received news from Beijing that Zhang Tao's reinstatement as a participating general was just around the corner. As long as the Foreign Intelligence Bureau did some more maneuvering, his promotion to Commander-in-Chief of Dengzhou was not impossible.

Huang Long was a parachuted cadre in Lushun. Except for his own personal soldiers and household servants, he actually only had allies in Dongjiang, no subordinates he could truly drive and mobilize at any time. A considerable number of Dongjiang generals were very hostile to this parachuted cadre. So Huang Long guarding Lushun was a dead end. Once the Manchus attacked Lushun, Huang Long would definitely die.

Once Lushun fell, Dongjiang would immediately be on the verge of collapse just like in history. Although Dongjiang had been trapped behind enemy lines for a long time and was not welcomed by others, it was after all a military heavyweight town supported by the imperial court with hundreds of thousands of money and grain every year. Once it was completely finished, it would be enough to shock the ruling and opposition parties.

At this time, if Zhang Tao could lead the "Dengzhou New Army trained by Sun Yuanhua" with wisdom and martial prowess—of course, actually the troops of the Northbound Detachment—to recover Lushun and have a second Jinzhou Great Victory, not only would Zhang Tao succeeding as Dengzhou Commander-in-Chief be no problem, but Sun Yuanhua remaining in office would also be quite possible.

The Expeditionary Army Command was now calculating this abacus: A part of Dongjiang defects - Qing army attacks Lushun - Lushun falls - Ming army counterattacks - Recover Lushun - Annex the remnants of Dongjiang. After this cycle, the ultimate goal of actually controlling Lushun and annexing Dongjiang would be completed, while simultaneously tying the personnel of the original Sun Yuanhua system to the Senate's war chariot.
