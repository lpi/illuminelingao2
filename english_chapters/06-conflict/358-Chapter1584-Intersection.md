# Chapter 1584 - Intersection

"The situation I am about to report is very important," Dongfang's expression became very serious, "You'd better have a recording for the record."

"Alright." Wu Mu was a little surprised, but still took out a recording pen from the drawer.

"What I want to say can absolutely not be discussed over the phone, nor can the material be seen by naturalized clerks, so I came to disturb you, please forgive me." Dongfang Ke spoke with particular seriousness.

"What are you saying? We serve the status of the Senate and the long-term stability of Lingao. Please speak."

"Mn, have you started recording? It's like this..."

Dongfang Ke briefly described his experience this morning in an emotionless tone, starting from oversleeping and almost missing the rehearsal, to forcibly cutting in line and rushing into the gymnasium, and then to the observation results from hiding in a corner of the stands.

"So, you saw suspicious persons during the Art Troupe rehearsal?"

"Not suspicious, but definitely problematic. I said: a person about fifteen centimeters shorter than me didn't move his feet at all when I bumped into him. It's impossible for him not to be a traditional martial arts practitioner."

"An indigenous onlooker with martial arts skills, and you said there were two women beside him?"

"Yes, naturalized women. At least they were wearing naturalized citizens' clothes. Ah no, one is definitely a naturalized citizen, I've seen her. I don't know the other one."

"Are you sure?"

"I don't know. Oh, I'm face-blind. But I know her work unit."

"Okay, where is it?"

"She should be an amateur actress from some Checkered Skirt Club, at least wearing the uniform of that idol group. Her dancing level is extremely terrible..." Dongfang began to complain.

"We don't care about this—I mean, are you sure this is a naturalized arts activist? Can you provide her name? Or should I ask someone from the Technical Section to come for a sketch?" Wu Mu had already put his hand on the handle of the internal telephone.

"How would I know? Those little girls look about the same, and their levels are about the same. Forget about the sketch. I didn't see the full face clearly, it's hard to remember. What I can tell you is that this woman is about 158 cm tall, her companion is about 162 cm, both have slender figures; that man is about 171 cm, his hair is combed very neatly, wearing a long gown of high-end silk fabric, holding an exquisite ivory fan. And..."

"And what?" Wu Mu became interested.

"That woman I haven't seen before and the suspicious male who practiced martial arts entered the gymnasium together. After our rehearsal ended, the three of them went to a certain training hall together. It is unclear when they left. It would be too conspicuous if I stayed alone after the rehearsal, and it was inconvenient to use the public phone there to call you at that time. I originally wanted to ask the Garrison Battalion soldier Wang Qisuo to return to the camp directly to bring troops, but later thought it would be better to clarify the situation and cast a long line first." —Dongfang Ke spoke extremely fast but the content was clear and organized. Wu Mu couldn't help clicking his tongue in wonder at this soy-saucer Senator who had never revealed his talents.

"Okay, so they didn't come to watch your rehearsal originally, but happened to run into it?"

"Director Wu, do you think the point is whether they came to watch the rehearsal or to exercise?" Dongfang Ke raised his tone.

"Oh, you mean..."

"Obviously, that suspicious male is quite capable. Although I didn't see his specific appearance clearly, obviously that naturalized female followed him every step of the way, hehe." Dongfang grinned.

"Okay, I noted it down. Please sign this recording transcript."

"Mn, sure. I think I should have fulfilled the obligation of a member of the Senate. If there's nothing else, I'll go first."

"Thank you for your timely notification. You certainly understand the confidentiality requirements of today's conversation. Sorry for not seeing you out comfortably, please go back and rest first."

"No need, goodbye, Director Wu."

After Dongfang Ke left the office, Wu Mu picked up the phone: "I want to access the surveillance report materials of the gymnasium for the whole day yesterday. Yes, all of them."

He put down the phone, considered for a few minutes, then picked up the phone again and connected to the Confidential Room: "Send a stenographer over, immediately."

In the office of the Lingao Garrison Command, Li Yayang looked suspiciously at the visitor: a Senator he just met—Dongfang Ke, Deputy Director of the Art Troupe.

This Senator Dongfang registered urgently to see him ten minutes ago. Reasonably speaking, as the highest security officer in Lingao, his time was very precious, especially with this Cultural Festival, the security pressure increased steeply. Senators who had no business relationship with him had to register in advance to make an appointment to see him. However, this Senator Dongfang told the secretary that the situation was severe, so Li Yayang decided to meet him just in case, for the sake of caution.

Since the Maid Revolution, Li Yayang had been sitting in the position of Commander of the Garrison Battalion. With the expansion of Lingao City, he became the Commander of the Lingao Garrison Command. Although his rank was only a mere Lieutenant Colonel, he was the person closest to the core of power among the Senator officers.

At the beginning, keeping in mind the words his grandfather said back then, "The Party commands the gun" and "Obey orders and listen to command", allowed Li Yayang, who was still a young lad during the Maid Revolution, not to capsize in the first line struggle. Therefore, although he had not been promoted since then, the power he controlled grew larger day by day. From simply protecting Bairen City and maintaining local security in Lingao, to now being responsible for the entry and exit security of the Senate.

If Li Yayang's initial actions were just remembering what his grandfather said, now he somewhat understood the mysteries of politics. Every time he thought of his initial decision, he always secretly rejoiced that he didn't make a mistake that would cause eternal regret. Otherwise, he would be a patrol member of the Agricultural Committee in Vietnam or Taiwan now.

Such experience made him very cautious when facing every Senator. However, after listening to Dongfang Ke's request, he couldn't help but suspect whether the visitor had mental problems, especially since his long hair and flowing silk shirt deepened his suspicion.

"Comrade Dongfang, do you have a definite reason for requesting to strengthen the security of the Cultural Festival?" He asked.

"Yes, but it's hard for me to explain simply. I understand your troops are tight. No need for too many people, just send two soldiers carrying weapons to follow Wang Qisuo who was seconded as a musician, or let Wang Qisuo himself participate in the rehearsal directly with a weapon."

"You have to be clear. It is inappropriate for you to come to me like this—it doesn't fit the procedure. The security configuration status of Lingao is the top secret of the Senate. Even mobilizing a squad of troops requires an order from the General Office," Li Yayang said, "Besides, weapon discipline is very strict. You are requesting Wang Qisuo to wear plain clothes and carry a gun on duty in a Class A venue. This is a very serious matter. I can't make the decision on your request. I have to report to the Executive Committee for instructions."

The so-called Class A venue refers to occasions where multiple Senators appear, and the alert level is the highest.

"Alright, please hurry up. No matter who you ask for instructions, please do it as soon as possible. I still have things to do, so I'll take my leave first." Dongfang Ke, who hit a snag, didn't say much and got up to open the door and leave.

Li Yayang stood up speechlessly, watching the long-haired literary man leave. He hesitated for a moment and picked up the telephone: "Connect to the Political Security Bureau, Director Wu!"

Surveillance Section Q12 reported routinely to Liu Fuqing.

Secret

The surveillance subject left the dormitory at 0700 today. After having breakfast in the cafeteria, she left the dormitory area. She followed the route of Jing 12 Branch 7 Road - Jing 12 Road, arrived at the Bus Lingao Police Station Stop, and boarded the No. 3 public carriage at 0740.

In accordance with your instructions, our surveillance personnel did not follow her onto the bus. Based on her movement trajectory in the previous stage, we knew she should get off at the Bus Gymnasium Stop. Therefore, we arranged a group of surveillance personnel at that stop in advance.

To prevent her from getting off midway, we temporarily arranged entrusted persons at all stops along the way.

The surveillance subject got off at the Gymnasium Stop at 0803. Since it was known in advance that the surveillance subject had received special training, I decided not to send surveillance personnel into the rehearsal site of the Gymnasium. The Photography Club of the College of Arts and Sciences was active in the venue that day, so I instructed Lin Aili to lead her Photography Club to be responsible for monitoring the surveillance subject. According to the surveillance report written by Lin Aili, the surveillance subject met with a man and a woman. Lin Aili took photos of them. One of the women was identified as Lian Nishang, Senior Assistant of the National Police at East Gate Police Station. The man is being identified. Judging from appearance characteristics, he is an indigenous person.

The surveillance subject watched the folk orchestra rehearsal with them, and then the surveillance subject participated in the rehearsal. The people she contacted during the period are attached in the table behind.

Also attached is a floor plan drawn by Lin Aili, indicating where the surveillance subject stayed in the venue. The surveillance subject left the Gymnasium from the emergency exit usually used by staff at 1830.

*Interesting*, Liu Fuqing thought. The surveillance of people around Li Yongxun had not made any major breakthroughs, but today's discovery was really surprising: another police officer, and an indigenous person!

He had a faint premonition: there was a big story here.

Liu Fuqing opened the photo bag in the file. He pulled out the black and white photo inside.

*The Chief's new toy is really great!* Liu Fuqing never revealed the admiration naturalized citizens often had for the Senators, prostrating themselves in admiration, but he always secretly admired their wisdom in his heart, feeling that he and everyone else were too insignificant in front of the Senators. "Wisdom near demon", this phrase was probably most suitable for the Senators. And this newly emerged camera was one of the products of the Senators' indescribable wisdom.

Liu Fuqing was a senior clerk who had mixed in the Great Ming system and knew deeply the importance of identity confirmation. With this thing called photography, those who opposed the Great Song had no way to live: this living photo was not like the drawing that looked like everyone and no one. As long as the Yamen arrived, once this photo was posted, it would be difficult to escape no matter how one disguised oneself. Matters like using fake road passes and household registrations would be solved easily.
