# Chapter 1383 - Rice Riots

On a day in early August 1633, outside the city walls of Lin'an County, Hangzhou Prefecture, a lifeless and desolate scene was everywhere. No cries of livestock or poultry, no laughter or joyful voices of people. During the day, every village was dead silent and empty. Occasionally some old people and children could be seen, all with vegetable-colored faces, listless. Men and women toiled under the scorching sun all day, exhausted, yet still had to carry baskets to pick wild vegetables to fill their hunger. But wild vegetables were also becoming fewer and fewer, almost picked clean.

Summer grain was about to come on the market, but every household's grain reserves had long been exhausted. Grain prices rose day by day. Farming households that had barely survived last year's drought began to struggle for livelihood again.

The relief grain issued by the government had been eaten. The plummeting prices of raw silk and cocoons in spring had completely destroyed the breathing hope of some sericulture households. Seeing that summer grain hadn't arrived yet, people were about to starve to death. Enduring the pain of selling young crops wasn't enough; they had to sell land, houses, sons, and daughters... everything a poor person could do for survival had been done. Although this year seemed to have favorable weather, the shadow of famine pressed heavier and heavier on their heads. In fact, many families had already run out of food. The number of tenant farmers abandoning land to flee famine and flowing into the city porridge sheds to survive began to increase again. The number of bodies by the roadside increased again.

In front of the rice shop in Dongguan Town outside the county seat, tattered villagers were crowded at this moment. On the doorframe of the rice shop hung a water board, on which the marked prices of rice and various coarse grains had been changed many times. From selling at three mace per dou at the beginning of spring, it had fallen back for a while. After entering summer, it rose for over ten days continuously and was already three mace eight candareens.

Teahouses and wine shops were still full. The skyrocketing grain price was a bolt from the blue for the common people, but it had no effect on the rich - many of them had more or less gained benefits in this catastrophe. Some obtained land and houses through usury, some bought cheap servants. Sounds of shouting numbers in drinking games and smug, obscure laughter transmitted from shop windows to the street, mixing with the begging sounds of starving people outside and the crying of those separating from their flesh and blood after selling themselves into slavery.

The villagers gathered at the rice shop door each carried a small bag. Faces green from eating too many wild vegetables were full of sorrow. Bins filled with rice and coarse grains weres piled high, giving their long-empty intestines a stinging burning sensation.

Although they wanted to eat a meal of rice day and night, they had to take out the last bit of unpolished rice from their homes to exchange for coarse grains.

"Really no way to live." A person hesitated for a long time, handing in a bag of rice in his hand. The group rolled their eyes impatiently and said: "You old thing, do you think we shopkeepers are beggars? What do we want your one sheng of rice for?"

"Please be kind!" The person bringing the rice bowed and pleaded, finally getting the other party to accept the rice and exchange it for a bag of coarse grains.

"This exchange is too little..." someone muttered.

"If it's too little, don't exchange," the clerk glared with eyes like a bull, looking disdainful. "Our shopkeeper only agreed to exchange your rice out of kindness. Exchange or not, don't block the door and hinder our business."

The people surrounding outside muttered for a while. Although the exchange rate in this shop was really a bit harsh, only this shop nearby was willing to accept their one sheng or half a dou of unpolished rice. If it were other shops, they wouldn't even bother to look at the little bit of rice they brought.

With no other choice, the people who came had to accept the "grace" in the rice shop one by one. Taking the bags of coarse grains, they couldn't help but secretly curse the shopkeeper's greed in their hearts.

When it was the last person's turn, it was a semi-old woman in ragged clothes. But looking closely at her, one could see she wasn't old, just that long-term malnutrition and excessive overwork made her skin grey and loose.

In her hand, she held a wooden stick like a beggar. From the way she panted every few steps, she probably couldn't have walked here without relying on this stick.

Because she had no strength, she was the last to reach the counter, tremblingly taking out a small broken cloth bag from her bosom and handing it over.

This little bit of rice was probably only half a he. The clerk wasn't willing to even take it, curling his lip and smiling at everyone: "Look, everyone, this little bit of rice, not even one he, and she brings it to exchange for coarse grains. Although our shop does good deeds, we can't do it this way. Big sister! You'd better take this rice back to feed the chickens."

"I beg the shopkeeper to have mercy—" the woman pleaded, saying her family's land and house had just been taken by creditors, the whole family lived in a ruined temple, without even a pot. The man of the house had died, leaving only old people and children, all too hungry to get up. Only this little rice could be brought out to exchange for coarse grains...

The clerk just refused. The woman cried and begged, finally kneeling down to plead. Seeing the onlookers increase, the clerk got annoyed, raised his hand and threw the bag of rice on the counter out.

Although called a rice bag, it was actually just a piece of rag wrapping rice. Falling to the ground, it immediately scattered. White rice splashed all over the ground.

The woman let out a hoarse scream, stumbling and crawling over to pick up the rice. But there was very little rice to begin with, and after being thrown, it splattered everywhere. The woman was seen stuffing rice grains into her bosom while crying, tears mixed with dust, looking like a madwoman. Everyone on the side couldn't bear to look.

"This is bullying people too much..."

Finally someone couldn't stand it and muttered.

"Bullying people? Who said that? Have the guts to stand out, don't hide in the back like a turtle!" The clerk widened his eyes and scolded.

The boss of this rice shop was a local tyrant - besides him, no one in town dared to open a rice shop. The clerks in the shop were all used to being overbearing. With his glare, none of the idlers watching the excitement dared to say another word.

An old man came out to mediate: "Shopkeeper Liu, just have mercy. For the sake of her being a widow with orphans, exchange some coarse grains. It's not giving for free anyway—"

The boss, who had been picking his teeth with a cold sneer on the side, probably felt the commotion at his shop door was unsightly, so he impatiently got up and took out a few bran cakes from under the counter and threw them out.

"Bran cakes..." Dissatisfied voices rose from the crowd.

"What's wrong with bran cakes?" The shopkeeper glared roundly. "Presumably you are all rich and noble, eating rice and white flour every day, looking down on these bran cakes?"

The woman hurriedly picked up the bran cakes one by one and stuffed them into her basket.

The shopkeeper laughed: "Look - you despise bran cakes, but she didn't despise them. Now this looks like begging for help. If we weren't fellow villagers, I would have kept these few bran cakes to feed my own pigs."

"What fellow villagers, fooling ghosts!" A deep voice rang out from the crowd. "You are just a bastard who eats people without spitting bones!"

The shopkeeper shivered all over, his mouth opening in surprise. All these years he had tyrannized the town, monopolizing the rice shop business, lending at usury, bullying men and seizing women, committing all kinds of bad deeds, yet no one had ever dared to say a word. People in the county, except for the gentry masters he couldn't afford to offend, were polite to him even if they were yamen runners or squad leaders, let alone dared to curse him to his face.

"What thing are you? Roll out here and let Master see!" The shopkeeper roared.

The crowd retreated, but one person stepped forward. He was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, tall, with pale skin, a somewhat stooped figure, and bow-legged - looking like a silk weaver sitting in front of a silk loom. Ordinary looking. His face was calm, looking very steady.

"Who are you, daring to be so impudent to Master Liu!" The clerks in the shop also recovered from their surprise and shouted.

"Hao Yuan." The person spoke very calmly, with no intention of causing trouble at all.

A clerk suddenly jumped out from behind the counter. On his face full of fierce flesh, a deep knife scar ran sideways from the right corner of his forehead to his left cheek. This was the mark left when he followed Shopkeeper Liu to "establish territory" here. Called a clerk, he was actually Shopkeeper Liu's thug.

He looked the other party up and down, seemingly estimating the opponent's weight. Saying nothing, he punched straight at Hao Yuan's chest. The opponent was immediately thrown ten steps away, falling all the way onto the table of the tea shop opposite.

The clerks in the rice shop immediately burst into a roar of laughter: "Well hit! Let him see how much he weighs!"

The clerk triumphantly crossed his arms, standing leisurely in the shop hall, a trace of a smile on his distorted face, admiring the effect of his punch.

Just then, Hao Yuan swayed and struggled up from the ground. His face was scratched by fragments of tea sets, bleeding a trace of fresh blood. The people around suddenly fell silent. In the silence, the cracking sound of a firecracker suddenly rang out. A strange atmosphere suddenly surrounded the scene. Many people had the same feeling - this wasn't over.

Footsteps on the street grew more and more urgent, as if many people were rushing here. In moments, the rice shop entrance was heavily besieged.

Hao Yuan turned around and stepped onto the bench in front of the tea shop. Facing the people gathered below, he shouted loudly: "Everyone saw it - we poor people have no way to live, even a bastard selling rice wants us to die! Those who don't want to watch their families starve to death, follow me!" He waved his arm:

"Those who don't want to die, grab the rice!"

Hao Yuan's shout was like a thunderbolt falling from a clear sky, waking up the people in a daze! They were all common people living at the bottom. Suffering disaster years made their already difficult days worse. They could only rely on selling everything they had bit by bit to make a living. By now, they had fallen to the state where they couldn't even obtain a little so-called grace through bitter pleading.

Now suddenly someone woke them up: Since pleading on knees didn't work, then use fists to grab!

Several men looking like weavers shouted together:

The crowd instantly rioted: "Those who don't want to die, grab the rice!" One sentence turned into ten, ten into a hundred. Everyone roared frantically as if possessed.
