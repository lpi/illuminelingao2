# Chapter 1570 - The Women of the Xiaocang (Part One)

"It wasn't that hard, really. Dad and the uncles took the materials to the lumber processing plant for treatment. We just assembled it, caulked the seams, and installed the equipment." Qian Duoduo spoke with studied nonchalance. "It's not like the old days when we had to do everything ourselves—there are plenty of ready-made things to work with now."

"Actually, we could make white paint ourselves..." A voice came from behind the boat, and a young girl stepped around from the stern. It was Zhong Xiaoying, Dr. Zhong's adopted daughter.

To avoid suspicion and prevent rumors of a "Hikaru Genji plan," Zhong Lishi had formally adopted Zhong Xiaoying through the General Affairs Office.

After the adoption, Zhong Xiaoying could theoretically attend the Academy with "Senator's child" status. However, Dr. Zhong felt her knowledge was too patchy and unsystematic for her to adapt to the Academy's curriculum. Besides, he needed a capable assistant by his side, so he simply educated her himself.

Nevertheless, he prudently registered Zhong Xiaoying at the Academy—even if she rarely attended. Without this credential, her status as a "Senator's daughter" would be greatly discounted, and she would miss out on many powerful alumni connections. While Dr. Zhong didn't intend to pass his seat to his adopted daughter, he hoped she could at least secure an advantageous position in the future empire.

Lin Ziqi had met Zhong Xiaoying a few times before and knew she was Zhong Lishi's adopted daughter.

She didn't know about her other skills, but when it came to miscellaneous knowledge, this girl could speak with authority on practically anything. Lin Ziqi, a genuine twenty-first-century girl, felt inferior to her in many areas. This made Lin Ziqi somewhat uncomfortable.

Zhong Xiaoying sported a clean, sharp short haircut and wore the same style of sailor shirt and canvas shorts as Qian Duoduo. Her exposed skin was tanned dark, and her figure was fit—one couldn't tell she was a seventeenth-century girl at all.

Most importantly, her Mandarin was crisp and clear. Although she had a slight Cantonese accent, her pronunciation was more standard than some Cantonese Senators'.

*No wonder Dad said environment changes people the most.* There wasn't a trace of her past life left on Zhong Xiaoying. Dr. Zhong truly lived up to his "Doctor" title—even the people he trained were different.

Unlike Dad and Uncle Zhang—losers wherever they went...

Lin Ziqi sighed with a complicated mix of envy, jealousy, and resentment.

"Tell us—how do you plan to make white paint?" Qian Duoduo had been brooding over the lack of white paint for some time. Not only because she couldn't use it on the small boat she'd built herself, but also because the white paint on the *Feiyun* had peeled off considerably over the years, leaving it mottled and unsightly. The three families had been thinking about getting some paint to repaint the ship thoroughly.

Lingao's chemical industry had made significant strides, but the chemical sector didn't prioritize paint. Basically, they stopped at "sufficient for use," mainly producing raw lacquer, tung oil, and coal tar. Colors were mostly natural or black, with a small amount of colored paint produced. White paint, which was primarily decorative, was almost never made at all.

"Dr. Zhong said—" Zhong Xiaoying often started her sentences this way; she still wasn't quite used to calling Dr. Zhong "Dad." "Australian white paint mainly uses titanium dioxide for coloring. We don't have titanium dioxide here, but we can use zinc white or lead white as pigments. It's just that the color isn't white enough—not as beautifully bright and shiny as the white on the *Feiyun*."

"Having white at all would be nice. We can't set the bar too high," Qian Duoduo said.

"The key is that paint also needs solvents. Dad said our current industrial level isn't incapable of making it—it's just troublesome. He said if we want something simple, we can just mix lead white or zinc white powder with tung oil. It just won't be white enough."

"Why didn't you say so earlier..." Qian Duoduo complained.

"I just talked to Dr. Zhong about it. Besides, if the factory doesn't produce it, you can't mix it yourself," Zhong Xiaoying said.

"True. And lead white is toxic. I remember a Senator saying that the face powder used in the Ming Dynasty was made from ground lead. Too scary—putting that directly on your face, wouldn't you get lead poisoning? Does anyone know how to make zinc white powder? Is it just grinding a piece of zinc?"

"I think it's calcined from ore—I don't know the specifics. But its scientific name is zinc oxide. According to general chemical reactions, I think burning zinc directly gives zinc white too." Zhong Xiaoying spoke very seriously.

Lin Ziqi turned her head away in boredom. She wasn't interested in this topic at all.

"...If we have zinc white, we can make it even fancier." Zhong Xiaoying seemed thoroughly engrossed in the subject. "Mix it with refined boiled linseed oil, use turpentine or camphor oil as a solvent—I saw them extracting camphor oil in Taiwan—then add natural wax. If you want it even prettier, you can add mica powder for a pearlescent effect..."

"Taiwan? Are you talking about Ilha Formosa?"

Before Zhong Xiaoying could finish, a voice speaking off-key Mandarin suddenly rang out, giving Lin Ziqi a start. *Who is that?*

Judging by the strange intonation, it was definitely a foreigner. But even Miss Mendoza, who hadn't spoken a word of Chinese initially, didn't sound this awkward anymore.

"Sonia, could you *not* be so abrupt?" Qian Duoduo clutched her chest. "You scared me half to death!"

"Apologies, apologies. I heard someone say Formosa—no, Taiwan—and I couldn't help myself." The newcomer was indeed a white girl with golden curly hair, wearing a straw hat decorated with ribbons and a blue dress with white lace trim on the collar. With her ocean-blue eyes and petite figure, she looked just like a doll.

Although they had never met, Lin Ziqi knew this blonde girl must be the Portuguese maiden who had caused quite a stir at the auction, attracting bids from several Senators before finally being purchased by Lin Hanlong. The tale had become something of an urban legend among the Senate.

"Let me introduce everyone. This is Sonia Lily Sharpel."

"A naturalist from Lisbon," the girl quickly added before Qian Duoduo could finish.

"Stop obsessing over your title," Qian Duoduo said. "These two are both Senator daughters. Ah, actually, Ziqi is a Senator herself, just like me—a minor."

Sonia lifted her skirt and executed a deep curtsy. "My ladies."

Lin Ziqi quickly extended her hand. "I'm Lin Ziqi. Just call me Ziqi."

Zhong Xiaoying was even more uncomfortable, not knowing where to put her hands. "Um, don't... I'm Zhong Xiaoying. I'm not a lady..."

"Don't be so formal, everyone. Come on, have some drinks first."

Though young, Qian Duoduo was generous and socially adept. She immediately invited everyone to rest under the shade shed next to the boat cradle, where ice-cold kvass was already soaking in a bucket. Although the four girls had different statuses, they were similar in age and lived in much the same environment in Lingao, so conversation came easily.

Compared to Lin Ziqi and Zhong Xiaoying, Sonia was more interested in the small boat. Portugal was a maritime nation, and she had frequently gone on sea expeditions, so she was very familiar with navigation and ships. Qian Duoduo's small boat reminded her of some small craft along the Atlantic coast—there was quite a resemblance.

"This boat is truly beautiful," she said sincerely. "It's not a junk skiff—it looks European! I bet its seaworthiness is excellent."

"Of course," Qian Duoduo said proudly. "It's launching today. I plan to sail along the coastline here."

Lin Ziqi remained skeptical. "This boat is so small. Will it really work in the open sea? One big wave and it'll capsize."

"No problem," Sonia said with certainty. "Small boats have excellent wave handling. If loaded with enough water and dry provisions, I could sail it to Batavia—or even across the ocean to New Spain—without issue." Her face glowed with enthusiasm as she spoke.

Lin Ziqi was half-doubting, but being neither familiar with nor interested in the subject, she just kept looking around. Why hadn't Zhang Yunmi arrived yet? Could she have fought with that secretary at home? Or...

While she was letting her imagination run wild, she heard Qian Duoduo laugh. "If you sailed to Batavia, Uncle Lin would kill me."

Sonia, hearing this, immediately showed a melancholy smile. "Yes. I am a slave."

Qian Duoduo realized she had misspoken and fell silent, mumbling. The atmosphere under the shed grew awkward. Zhong Xiaoying quickly said: "I was a slave too when I came to Lingao. My contract was a dead contract—meaning a slave forever forbidden from gaining freedom."

"Not everyone has your good luck." Sonia sighed. "To be honest, my luck isn't bad either. I didn't end up in some terrible harem. It's more tolerant here than I imagined, even quite free, and my master is a learned scholar. He teaches me many unheard-of things and has so many mysterious books..." Her eyes lit up at the mention of these mysterious books, but then she sighed again, saying regretfully, "If only I weren't a slave..."

"If you weren't a slave, you wouldn't get to see those books at all," Lin Ziqi interjected. "Hmph, you should be content. The Senators' black... knowledge isn't something just anyone gets to learn!"

Sonia paused for a moment, then smiled faintly. "You are right."

Qian Duoduo felt Lin Ziqi was being a bit too sharp and deliberately changed the subject. "Sonia, you got so excited hearing about Taiwan Island. You want to go?"

"Yes, ever since I knew I had come to China, I've wanted to explore that big island," Sonia nodded. "I've seen some pamphlets written by the Dutch. That island is completely undeveloped and should have many things worth seeing."
