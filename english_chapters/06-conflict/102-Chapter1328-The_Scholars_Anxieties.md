# Chapter 1328 - A Visit to Fangcao Di: The Scholars' Anxieties

Although he felt pleased at having suddenly grasped something clearly, Director Wang soon fell into anxiety again:

"This is exactly what has me worried!" Wang Ci suddenly lowered his voice urgently. "Consider, Headmaster: the Australians have already defeated the court's regular armies. Given how the court looks now, I fear there'll be no reckoning for eight or ten years. The pir—Australians may not have declared independence, but they're bound to become at least regional warlords of the Great Ming. I'm not ignorant of current affairs: the realm is now in turmoil, with the people unable to make a living. If someone can come forward to stabilize the country and secure the nation, allowing people and court to live in peace, that would naturally be best. Even rewarding them with a prefecture or several counties wouldn't be excessive. But the Australians are at the height of their power, and with so many secret methods at their command, I fear they may have ambitions toward the throne."

These words were extremely blunt. If not for the Late Ming's chaotic portents appearing one after another, which had long since accustomed scholars to such talk, this speech alone would constitute the crime of high treason.

Liu Dalin stroked his beard silently for a long while, finally sighing softly. "We who have received the nation's grace are not disloyal or unfilial people. But fate has its seasons, which human effort cannot counter. My former classmates and examination colleagues have been writing to me frequently of late, many inquiring about the inner details of the Australians. Speaking of the current situation at court and in the realm—it's too rotten to describe. Even if His Majesty wishes to govern diligently, I fear he can do nothing about it! I fear that before ten years are out, there will be... events too painful to witness..."

Director Wang started with surprise, nearly dropping his chopsticks: "So you mean—"

"I only hope this is merely my needless worrying." His expression was very grave. He continued: "Since ancient times, the changing of dynasties has been the normal course of events. The Australians have come bearing secret techniques and governed diligently here. I fear they have long harbored ambitions to compete for the realm."

This view was no longer particularly unconventional among Lingao's gentry and commoners, but hearing it spoken for the first time from Liu Dalin's lips, its weight was naturally different. Wang Ci couldn't help shivering.

"So the Headmaster has long held this view as well—"

"I fear those in this county who don't think this way are already very few." Liu the Successful Candidate smiled slightly, though the smile held traces of bitterness. Although years of exposure had gradually and imperceptibly changed his view of the Australians greatly—they were even his life-saving benefactors—he still felt he had received the grace of the Great Ming. Truly "bathed in imperial grace"—even though he saw the future clearly, he couldn't help but feel reluctance and sorrow for this dynasty that had given him grace and glory.

Wang Ci hastily continued: "Headmaster, since ancient times the will of Heaven cannot be defied. I have no intention of acting against Heaven. Yet since antiquity, no matter how dynasties have changed, what has never changed is 'the court rules the realm together with the scholar-gentry.' Now, although these Australians may deserve the phrase 'teaching without discrimination,' the books they teach and schools they run have nothing whatsoever to do with the sages' classics. Yet somehow they have governed Lingao so well. I often think: when these students complete their studies someday, they will surely become the Australians' right-hand men, and they will surely build factories and railways for them. But if so, how are the gentry and scholars to position themselves? What the future will look like—I, your student, dare not imagine, cannot imagine, and cannot figure out!"

These were words he had thought about for a long time. Deep in the heart of this frustrated minor official, the life or death of the Great Ming was not the most crucial matter. What was crucial was that the pirates were introducing an entirely new system of learning. Under this system, all the old learning and knowledge that he and the scholars possessed would become worthless. The thing that allowed them to receive at least basic respect from common people even at their most destitute moments would turn to ashes. This was what he feared and worried about most.

What use was he, a Director of Education, to the pirates? Director Wang knew that the reason he could still collect over a hundred *liuntongjuan* from the county office that had long since become a sinecure was entirely because the Australians didn't want to shed the Great Ming's skin yet. If someday they truly decided to "change skins," then he, the Director of Education of Lingao County under the Great Ming, would either have to pack up and go back to his hometown, or else go teach the *Hundred Family Surnames* and *Three Character Classic* in refugee camps for a living. In this respect, he was far more anxious than the detached Liu the Successful Candidate.

Indeed, these words seemed to have somewhat moved Liu the Successful Candidate. Seeing him nod slightly, Wang Ci hastily pressed on:

"My purpose in coming here is partly to probe the Australians' hidden secrets and techniques—though I'm useless; even sitting in Australian classrooms, reading Australian books, I still can't understand anything. On the other hand, if the Australians can truly follow the great trend, I also wish to persuade them to turn their hearts toward civilization and not rely solely on brute force. I hope the Headmaster will assist me."

Wang Ci spoke with increasing agitation, his tone growing more urgent. If not for the surroundings, he might have prostrated himself before Liu Dalin. As it was, he still managed to clasp his hands and bow toward Liu Dalin.

Liu the Successful Candidate of course understood the meaning in these words. But he knew in his heart this would not be easy to accomplish—the pirates were not like the Sixteen Kingdoms of the Five Barbarians or the Mongol Yuan, savages who originally didn't even have writing. They were a group with their own ideology and values. Their daily conduct somewhat resembled the Legalist school yet also the Mohist school, mixed with various other schools of thought—looking at it from any angle, it was a great mish-mash. Wanting them to "turn their hearts toward civilization" would be as difficult as ascending to heaven. With their power, they were more likely to "transform the civilized into barbarians" in the future.

Liu Dalin was thinking, about to say something, when he was interrupted by a commotion from students in the distance: several female students were laughing and watching two big boys arm-wrestling, while cheering "jiā yóu, jiā yóu" as they watched. Sunlight fell on those faces brimming with youth. For a moment, Liu Dalin and Wang Ci didn't know what to say, only feeling how aged and powerless they themselves were.

Huang Bingkun paid no attention to the commotion in the cafeteria. He was sitting across from a transmigrator teacher eating his meal. The Australians had been ashore for several years and done so many earth-shaking things, yet this was Huang Bingkun's first time sitting face-to-face with a pirate. This was Teacher Dong who had taught on the first day. He looked like a man of about thirty, with dark skin and well-developed arm muscles, appearing strong and capable. But their knowledge was beyond Huang Bingkun's comprehension. The Australian across from him seemed to be watching him with amusement while eating. This made Huang Bingkun eat very uncomfortably. He wanted to say something to the man, yet felt there was nothing he could say.

Today he had gotten up especially early to observe the entire school's six thousand students doing their morning run. Two hundred residence groups of thirty people each appeared simultaneously on campus, proceeding in strict formations along prescribed routes, weaving past each other without interference. It was a breathtaking sight. It also raised questions: if the pirates were using education as a cover to secretly train crack troops, most of these students were too young to be sent into battle within two or three years. Rather than expending such effort drilling such young children, they might as well directly recruit young adult men to train as soldiers—among the thousands upon thousands of northern refugees that had recently arrived, there were plenty of able-bodied young men available for service. Moreover, judging by the enormous investment the pirates made in these students, these fake-pirate students would surely become the backbone under the Australians' command in the future, absolutely not to be used as cannon fodder.

Investing so much capital, using Australian learning to educate so many children—what exactly were they plotting? Huang Bingkun felt he was beginning to glimpse the Australians' schemes.

Though Young Master Huang didn't see things as clearly as Director Wang and Liu the Successful Candidate, he clearly understood that Fangcao Di's students would surely become the pirates' trusted confidants in the future. Besides soldiering and laboring, they would inevitably become officials—"cadres"—to govern the common people. For families like his own, not only would it be hard to get ahead in Lingao in the future, but just the mention of the "old affair" when his father had led troops to besiege the pirates would be enough to give the Huang family plenty of trouble.

Right now, the pirates were merely showing appeasement by letting them participate in the County Consultative Bureau as committee members because they weren't yet firmly established! Once their wings were full-fledged, the day of reckoning for the Huang family would arrive. Huang Bingkun brooded darkly.

"Not hungry, Mister Huang?"

Somehow, the person across from him had initiated conversation. Huang Bingkun hastily pulled himself together to respond.

"No, just feeling slightly unwell, so my appetite is poor." By now, Huang Bingkun had learned to speak serviceable "Australian Mandarin." Though not standard, he could communicate adequately with transmigrators.

"You should participate more in physical exercise. That way your body will be healthy and your appetite will improve." Transmigrator Dong said.

Actually, Huang Bingkun came from a farming and scholarly family. Normally he not only led his hired hands and tenants into the fields himself, but also practiced martial arts in his spare time—he was by no means one of those who never lifted a finger. But he had no desire to explain himself at the moment, and merely said "yes" several times.

"There's a ball game this afternoon. You should come watch too. I hear your Huang Family Stockade has plenty of people—you could start playing for fun. When we organize a league later, you could field a team and compete."

Transmigrator Dong's enthusiasm actually stemmed from his "selfish motives." Like most male transmigrators, Transmigrator Dong was very keen on sports competitions like football and basketball. Although conditions after D-Day hadn't allowed for football, basketball, or volleyball, English-style rugby and baseball, which had relatively simple equipment requirements, had been developed. As a committee member of the "Rugby Grand League," Transmigrator Dong was enthusiastic about recruiting teams and organizing leagues. He was determined to expand the league's scale. Currently, industry teams within the naturalized citizen system had been mostly organized, and development was now expanding to various villages and towns. The Huang Family Stockade was a large settlement, and its militia had always been known for "fighting ability," so he wanted to recruit the Huang Family Stockade into this league system.

"Ball game?" Huang Bingkun vaguely recalled hearing Huang Ping mention ball games—something about a ball sport with very intense confrontation. The Great Ming had no athletic competition events—such things were generally classified as "performances." Now hearing this Transmigrator Dong personally invite him to watch, it seemed to be something the pirates considered quite important, so he readily agreed: "Of course I must go see it."

"It's at the athletic field, starting at one o'clock this afternoon." Transmigrator Dong eagerly promoted. This man was the Huang family's second young master and held an important position at the Huang Family Stockade. If he could win him over, getting the Huang Family Stockade to field a team would be much easier.
