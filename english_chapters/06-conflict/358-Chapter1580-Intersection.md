# Chapter 1580 - Intersection

"What I am about to report is very important." Dongfang's expression turned grave. "You'd better record this."

"Very well." Wu Mu was mildly surprised but retrieved a recording pen from his drawer.

"What I have to say cannot be discussed over the phone, and the material cannot be seen by naturalized clerks. That's why I've come in person. I apologize for the intrusion." Dongfang Ke spoke with uncharacteristic gravity.

"Think nothing of it. We serve the Senate's interests and Lingao's long-term stability. Please, continue."

"Mn. Have you started recording? It's like this..."

Dongfang Ke recounted the morning's events in a flat, emotionless tone: oversleeping and nearly missing the rehearsal, forcing his way through the crowd at the gymnasium entrance, and finally, the observations he had made from a shadowed corner of the stands.

"So you spotted suspicious persons during the Art Troupe rehearsal?"

"Not just suspicious—definitely problematic. As I said: a person roughly fifteen centimeters shorter than me didn't move his feet at all when I crashed into him. It's impossible for him not to be a traditional martial arts practitioner."

"An indigenous spectator who knows martial arts. And you said there were two women with him?"

"Yes, naturalized women—at least, they were dressed as naturalized citizens. Actually, no—one is definitely naturalized. I've seen her before. The other, I can't say."

"You're certain?"

"I don't know. I'm face-blind, to be honest. But I know her workplace."

"Very well. Where?"

"She must be an amateur actress from some Checkered Skirt Club—at the very least, she was wearing that idol group's uniform. Her dancing was absolutely terrible..." Dongfang began to digress.

"We don't concern ourselves with that." Wu Mu's hand hovered over the internal telephone. "What I mean is—are you certain she's a naturalized arts activist? Can you provide her name? Or should I have someone from the Technical Section come for a sketch?"

"How would I know? Those little girls all look about the same, and their skill levels are equally mediocre. Forget the sketch—I didn't get a clear look at her full face; it's hard to remember. What I can tell you is this: that woman is approximately 158 centimeters tall, her companion about 162 centimeters, both slender in build. The man is around 171 centimeters, his hair combed immaculately, wearing a long gown of high-grade silk, carrying an exquisite ivory fan. And..."

"And what?" Wu Mu leaned forward.

"The woman I hadn't seen before and the suspicious martial artist entered the gymnasium together. After our rehearsal concluded, the three of them proceeded to one of the training halls. I don't know when they left. It would have been too conspicuous if I'd stayed alone after the rehearsal ended, and it was inconvenient to call you from the public phone there. I originally considered asking Garrison Battalion soldier Wang Qisuo to return directly to camp and bring troops. But then I thought it better to first clarify the situation—cast a long line to catch a bigger fish."

Dongfang Ke spoke at tremendous speed, yet his account remained clear and organized. Wu Mu could not help but marvel at this soy-sauce-sipping Senator who had never before revealed such capabilities.

"I see. So they didn't come specifically to watch your rehearsal—they stumbled upon it by chance?"

"Director Wu," Dongfang Ke raised his tone, "do you really think the point is whether they came to watch the rehearsal or to exercise?"

"Oh. You mean..."

"Obviously, the suspicious male is quite formidable. I couldn't make out his face clearly, but it was apparent that naturalized woman followed him at every turn. Hehe." Dongfang grinned.

"Noted. Please sign this transcript of the recording."

"Mn, of course. I believe I've fulfilled my obligations as a member of the Senate. If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave."

"Thank you for your timely report. You certainly understand the confidentiality requirements of this conversation. Forgive me for not seeing you out properly—please go rest."

"No need. Goodbye, Director Wu."

After Dongfang Ke departed, Wu Mu picked up the telephone: "I want to access the surveillance report materials for the gymnasium from all of yesterday. Yes—every last one."

He set down the receiver, considered for several minutes, then picked it up again and connected to the Confidential Room: "Send a stenographer over. Immediately."

In the office of the Lingao Garrison Command, Li Yayang regarded his visitor with suspicion: a Senator he had only just met—Dongfang Ke, Deputy Director of the Art Troupe.

This Senator Dongfang had requested an urgent meeting just ten minutes ago. As Lingao's highest security officer, Li Yayang's time was precious—especially with the Cultural Festival looming and security pressures mounting sharply. Senators without direct working relationships were required to register and schedule appointments in advance. However, Senator Dongfang had told the secretary the situation was severe. Li Yayang, erring on the side of caution, agreed to see him.

Since the Maid Revolution, Li Yayang had occupied the position of Commander of the Garrison Battalion. As Lingao City expanded, his title had become Commander of the Lingao Garrison Command. Though his rank was merely Lieutenant Colonel, he stood closer to the core of power than nearly any other Senator officer.

In those early days, he had kept in mind his grandfather's words: "The Party commands the gun" and "Obey orders and follow commands." These principles had kept Li Yayang—still a young lad during the Maid Revolution—from capsizing in the first political struggle. Though he had not been promoted since, the power he wielded had grown substantially. What began as simply protecting Bairen City and maintaining local security in Lingao had expanded to encompass responsibility for the entry and exit security of the entire Senate.

If Li Yayang's initial compliance was mere rote obedience to his grandfather's teachings, he now understood something of the mysteries of politics. Every time he reflected on that initial decision, he quietly rejoiced that he hadn't made a mistake he would regret for the rest of his life. Otherwise, he would be a patrol member of the Agricultural Committee in Vietnam or Taiwan by now.

Such experience made him cautious when dealing with any Senator. Yet after hearing Dongfang Ke's request, he could not help wondering if the man suffered from mental problems—especially given the long hair and flowing silk shirt, which only deepened his suspicions.

"Comrade Dongfang, do you have a definite basis for requesting enhanced Cultural Festival security?"

"Yes, but it's difficult to explain simply. I understand your troops are stretched thin. I'm not asking for many people—just send two armed soldiers to accompany Wang Qisuo, who's been seconded as a musician. Or allow Wang Qisuo himself to participate in rehearsals while armed."

"You need to be clearer. Coming to me directly like this isn't appropriate—it doesn't follow procedure. Lingao's security configuration is a top Senate secret. Mobilizing even a single squad requires an order from the General Office." Li Yayang spoke firmly. "Moreover, weapon discipline is strict. You are requesting that Wang Qisuo carry a concealed weapon on duty in plain clothes at a Class A venue. This is a serious matter. I cannot approve your request on my own authority—I must report to the Executive Committee for instructions."

Class A venue designation referred to occasions where multiple Senators gathered simultaneously, warranting the highest alert level.

"Very well. Please proceed as quickly as possible. Whoever you need to consult, please do so immediately. I still have matters to attend to—I'll take my leave." Dongfang Ke, having hit a wall, said nothing more. He rose, opened the door, and departed.

Li Yayang stood speechless, watching the long-haired arts official go. After a moment's hesitation, he picked up the telephone: "Connect me to the Political Security Bureau—Director Wu!"

Surveillance Section Q12 submitted its routine report to Liu Fuqing.

**SECRET**

The surveillance subject departed her dormitory at 0700 today. After eating breakfast in the cafeteria, she left the dormitory area. She followed the route of Jing 12 Branch 7 Road to Jing 12 Road, arrived at the Bus Lingao Police Station Stop, and boarded the No. 3 public carriage at 0740.

In accordance with your instructions, our surveillance personnel did not board the bus after her. Based on her movement patterns from the preceding period, we anticipated she would disembark at Bus Gymnasium Stop. We therefore positioned a surveillance team at that location in advance.

To guard against the possibility of her disembarking midway, we temporarily stationed operatives at all intermediate stops along the route.

The surveillance subject disembarked at Gymnasium Stop at 0803. Given advance knowledge that the subject had received specialized training, I decided against deploying surveillance personnel into the gymnasium rehearsal venue. The Photography Club of the College of Arts and Sciences was active in the facility that day; I instructed Lin Aili and her Photography Club to assume monitoring duties. According to Lin Aili's surveillance report, the subject met with one man and one woman. Lin Aili photographed them. One of the women has been identified as Lian Nishang, Senior Assistant of the National Police at East Gate Police Station. The man is still being identified. Based on appearance characteristics, he is indigenous.

The surveillance subject watched the folk orchestra rehearsal in their company, then participated in rehearsals herself. Her contacts during this period are listed in the attached table.

Also attached is a floor plan drawn by Lin Aili indicating where the surveillance subject stayed within the venue. The surveillance subject departed the Gymnasium via the emergency exit typically used by staff at 1830.

*Interesting*, Liu Fuqing thought. Surveillance of Li Yongxun's associates had yielded no major breakthroughs until now—but today's discovery was genuinely surprising: another police officer and an indigenous person.

He had a faint premonition: there was a significant story here.

Liu Fuqing opened the photo bag in the file and pulled out the black-and-white photograph.

*The Chiefs' new toy is truly remarkable!* Liu Fuqing never exhibited the prostrate admiration naturalized citizens typically showed toward the Senators, but he had always secretly marveled at their wisdom, feeling utterly insignificant in comparison. "Wisdom approaching the demonic"—that phrase was perhaps most fitting for the Senators. And this newly emerged camera was yet another product of their unfathomable ingenuity.

Liu Fuqing was a senior clerk who had navigated the Great Ming bureaucracy and understood deeply the importance of identity confirmation. With this invention called photography, those who opposed Great Song would find survival increasingly difficult: a living photograph was nothing like a sketch that resembled everyone and no one. Once the Yamen arrived and posted such a photograph, no disguise could save the subject. Problems like forged road passes and household registrations would be solved with ease.
