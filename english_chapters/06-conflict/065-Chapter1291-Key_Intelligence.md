# Chapter 1291 Key Intelligence

Although he said that, Lu Wenyuan felt that a "surprise attack on Qingzhou" was already a very difficult tactical operation to execute for the rebels whose activity space had been compressed to just Dengzhou. Zhu Dadian and Gao Qiqian had both personally arrived at the city walls to command the suppression army, and the number of government troops was at its peak with high morale. From the news coming from the city, Li Jiucheng, Kong Youde, and others already had the intention to flee by boat, but were blocked by their subordinates. Obviously, the morale of the rebels had begun to fall.

Zhu Mingxia, who returned from Jeju Island, held a different view. He believed that judging from historical records, the fighting will of the rebel backbone had always been not weak. After the victory at Beima Town, the government troops had never taken a big advantage in the months-long siege of Dengzhou. Not only were the government troops who broke into the city driven out several times, but the rebels also actively left the city to engage in battle many times. Until Li Jiucheng died in battle, the rebels resolutely refused to surrender, and even after fleeing out to sea, they fought with the Ming army and Korean army many times in the Bohai Bay, until they really couldn't get by anymore before surrendering to the Manchus. They could be called true diehards and desperadoes.

"The rebels in Dengzhou do not lack fighting will, what they lack is accurate intelligence and mobility." Zhu Mingxia said, "As long as we give them a hand, these daring fellows led by Kong Youde will definitely seek survival in death."

"The problem is, if we help them take out the government troops' grain and fodder, won't Xie Sanbin and Zhu Dadian immediately set their sights on Qimu Island? We are the only big household in Huang County that might possibly raise a large amount of grain." Chen Sigen expressed concern.

Resisting with force was of course easy, but what they wanted was to exist in the Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong for a long time. Openly fighting against the government did not fit this strategy.

"We have to do it like the Battle of Wuchao back then." Zhu Mingxia already had a draft plan.

Once the grain supply is lost, Yuan's army will be shaken, and Cao's army will charge out riding the momentum. It settled the universe of Hebei in one fell swoop. Switching to Dengzhou, it would be about the same. The rebels could take advantage of the opportunity when the government troops lost their grain and fodder and the army's heart was shaken to charge out in one fell swoop, at least breaking the siege.

"This requires very high execution and command ability..." Lu Wenyuan felt it was a bit incredible.

"I think the rebels have this ability." Zhu Mingxia said without hesitation, "I read the history compilation materials about this incident in the Great Library. Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde performed quite well in tactical command, and the army's combat performance was also not bad. As long as we provide enough intelligence and necessary convenience, they will seize this only chance to turn the tables and make a desperate bet."

Wait until the government troops begin to rout, the Northbound Detachment would support Sun Yuanhua to attack from Laizhou, repelling the rebels in one fell swoop, and saving the defeated government army from the crisis of total annihilation.

Every failure is an excellent opportunity to attack political enemies. Whether it is Zhu Dadian or Xie Sanbin, they all have to face the wave of impeachment erupting against them from up and down the court. Their attitude will become more approachable—the more chaotic the situation in Shandong, the smaller the cost the Senate needs to pay to maintain its presence here.

At night, Dazhushan Island. A small boat without flags or markings quietly docked.

Dazhushan Island was small in area and had no Ming troops stationed. It was moderately distant from Penglai and Longkou, so it was selected as the meeting and contact point between the Northbound Detachment and the rebel leaders. Although the two sides had been cooperating in human trafficking and buying stolen goods for a year, there was still no trust between them. Meeting on this small island could give both sides some sense of security.

Since the two sides secretly reached a mutually beneficial and non-aggression agreement, a regular liaison system had been established between the rebels and the "Three Men of Qimu Island". Both sides sent envoys to convey oral messages with tokens as proof—the Engine Operation Command repeatedly reminded them not to leave a single piece of paper or character in the hands of the rebels. Except for the Senators themselves, no one else was allowed to keep relevant documents and records of negotiations with the rebels.

For this reason, the naturalized citizens selected as liaisons were considered the most reliable and capable of strictly keeping secrets. However, this matter was of great importance, so Chen Sigen went in person.

In the beacon tower guard house under the abandoned beacon tower on Dazhushan Island, with a lamp as small as a bean, Kong Youde, who was waiting for the "envoy", looked dark and gloomy. On this small island, he didn't need to put on a calm face of "having a well-thought-out plan" and "not being startled by changes"—for the current situation of the rebels, saying "desperate" might not be an exaggeration.

"Promoting soothing through war" and "Breaking through Laizhou to seize a way into the Three Prefectures of Western Shandong and enter the Central Plains"—of the two major strategies formulated at the beginning, not a single one had been realized so far. Since the day of raising the army, Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde had sent many spies to the capital, Jinan and other places to inquire about news. Many ministers in the court who might have advocated appeasement suddenly lost their voices and unanimously talked about "suppression", greatly weakening the voice originally advocating appeasement.

Promoting soothing through war failed, and the plot to seize a way into the Three Prefectures of Western Shandong also went bankrupt repeatedly. Although the Ming army performed poorly in field battles, they blocked the rebel offensive in almost every defensive battle, forcing them to operate in the narrow strip between Dengzhou and Laizhou from beginning to end.

More than a year of frantic burning, killing and looting had turned this area into a barren land for a thousand li, and it could no longer support the rebel army which had expanded to dozens of times its original scale.

Desperate bandits, local able-bodied men forced to allow the thieves to make a living, routed government soldiers, and Liaodong soldiers and civilians who crossed the sea in large numbers from the hungry and cold Dongjiang Town to defect... These people gathered together to form an armed group of unprecedented scale. Like locusts, they ate everything clean. Thoughts of promotion, getting rich, women, and jade and silk had gradually been replaced by the imminent problem of "eating a full meal".

Dengzhou did have grain "piled up like mountains" at the beginning, and later obtained a large amount of grain and fodder by looting the four countrysides. However, in the entire Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong, except for a few places that were not swept by the flames of war, there was no cultivation for the whole year, so naturally there was no summer or autumn grain coming onto the market. As the stored grain was about to run out, a large-scale famine had quietly loomed over the rebels' heads.

The only one who could have a large amount of stored grain in the Dengzhou and Laizhou area now was Qimu Island. However, they returned in defeat when they were strong and sturdy, let alone now that the government troops were stationed outside the West Gate of Dengzhou!

If this continued, without fighting, their own men and horses would eventually collapse without a fight due to hunger and cold.

What was the plot of this Manor Lord Lu of Qimu Island suddenly proposing to see him?

Regarding this Manor Lord Lu, Kong Youde had never been able to figure out exactly what his plot was. After seeing the formidable combat power and huge power of firearms of his village braves in the few face-to-face battles at the beginning, he had always held a fearful psychology towards this fierce tiger by the couch.

Fortunately, except for once sending people to help defend Laizhou, Manor Lord Lu did not interfere with his actions. After the two sides reached a tacit understanding, the territory occupied by the Qimu Island side was only a Zhaoyuan, and they didn't care about the territory. Then they just kept taking in refugees, continuously loading people onto ships and transporting them away, seeming that what he plotted was people. If it weren't for the fact that the Qimu Island village braves' tactics were completely different from the Eastern Barbarians (Manchus), he would even suspect that Manor Lord Lu was a Tartar in disguise.

He didn't know why Manor Lord Lu specially invited him to meet here this time—coming to meet in person was of course risking danger. After all, he was now the Vice Marshal of the rebels, the number two leader. Once captured, it would be a great merit.

However, Kong Youde knew very well that with Manor Lord Lu's strength, if he wanted to help the government troops destroy the rebels, he could have done so long ago, and there was no need to wait until today to do this.

"The General has arrived. I am late." The comer had a voice like a heavy bell, was eight chi tall, and had a strong physique, but it was not Manor Lord Lu.

"I dare not, I just arrived not long ago." Kong Youde cupped his fists in salute, "Your Honor is..."

"I am the Manor Lord's representative, coming to talk to the General about a major event." Chen Sigen looked at this unassuming young general in front of him with mixed feelings. The two exchanged a few pleasantries and immediately cut to the chase. Chen Sigen opened a paper package and took out a few sheets of thin Xuan paper.

"General, please look."

Kong Youde took it, looked carefully by the light, and was immediately startled.

This was a detailed distribution map of government troops stationed in the Qingzhou area, not only with terrain and roads, but also with the number of people and the names of commanding generals and officials. The most critical thing was that it actually marked multiple locations where government troops stored grain.

The government army's grain and fodder were transshipped from Qingzhou. Kong Youde had also learned this through spies he sent out, but such a clear and accurate map was something he did not possess.

As a veteran general, Kong Youde naturally knew the vital point of this map. He suppressed the excitement in his heart and looked up at the other party: "This is..."

"This is a small gift from the Manor Lord to you." Chen Sigen said.

Kong Youde held the map tightly in his palm. This was not a map, it was simply an elixir to bring the rebels back to life!

For a moment he didn't know what to say. The other party giving him this map, the intention was self-evident. But then he became suspicious again—what exactly did these people from Qimu Island want to do?!

Within the core layer of the rebels, they felt that the purpose of this force on Qimu Island was always difficult to grasp. If saying they were loyal to the Imperial Court, they had absolutely no interest in assisting the suppression. Kong Youde knew very well that with the combat power of the Qimu Island "village braves" and the large ships they constantly sailed to Longkou to pick up and drop off refugees, it would not be difficult to defeat them alone—not to mention anything else, as long as they were willing, they could cut off the sea route from Dengzhou to the various islands of Dongjiang at any time, and they (the rebels) would simply be unable to "recruit Dongjiang old people" and get the reinforcement of a large number of Dongjiang soldiers and civilians.

Not to mention that this group of people had always been doing business on their own, acquiring a large amount of population and materials, giving the rebels an excellent channel for large-scale disposal of stolen goods.

If saying they were just ambitious powers taking advantage of the Dengzhou chaos to expand their power, this group of people, apart from a Qimu Island, only additionally occupied a Zhaoyuan. Zhaoyuan, this place, was a poor place even in the Three Prefectures of Eastern Shandong. Even local powers knew to occupy more territory and occupy rich territory. How could there be one who was satisfied with occupying a piece of salty and bitterly cold land by the sea.
