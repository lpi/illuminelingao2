# Chapter 1668 - Reciting Poetry

Wait; Suo Pu treated this talk as foreign language. Even a military officer like Lin Ming, with limited reading, was completely baffled. Xie Peng only understood a little. Naturally, they couldn't cut in.

Seeing the three left aside, Mei Lun felt quite awkward and quickly said: "Discussing essays and poetry can be done another day. We mustn't let down the beautiful scenery and fine time. Come, come, come, let's play some drinking games to add to the fun. Regardless of riddles or poetry, as long as someone matches it, they get an ivory tally. I have here a Duan inkstone bestowed by Governor Xiong. Though not from the Old Pit, it is still precious. Whoever gets the most tallies will receive this as a gift." Saying so, he clapped his hands, and a servant brought out a Duan inkstone and placed it on the high table in the middle of the room. It instantly attracted everyone's gaze.

Zhaoqing was the origin of Duan inkstones. Historically, they were listed as tribute items very early on. Every time a pit was opened to mine stones, it was organized by the imperial court and government, with dedicated guards for each pit, strictly forbidding private mining. In the Ming dynasty, several pit openings were managed by eunuchs sent from the palace, showing their high value. After Xiong Wencai took office as Governor-General, he ordered the reopening of the Lanke Mountain Water Rock Pit for "operational" purposes. Although this batch of Duan inkstones were "new goods," they were still extremely precious to these poor scholars.

"Since there is a prize, we must set rules." A local *xiucai* (scholar) named Xie Shiming sat among them. He always prided himself on his high talent. After Xiong Wencai came to Zhaoqing, he was hired into the secretariat—not because he had great talent, but because this scholar grew up in Sichuan. Not only could he speak fairly standard Mandarin, but he could also speak some Sichuan dialect, comforting Xiong Wencai's homesickness.

He stared at the Duan inkstone and said seriously, "Let Master Chang supervise. Those who mess up the order or make mistakes will have tallies counted against them. Who speaks best will be judged by everyone, how about that?"

Master Xianhe laughed: "Brother Xie wants to seize the champion's title in one go."

Xie Shiming laughed proudly: "I dare not! I think we should ask Master Mei to be the game master and give the first topic."

Mei Lun knew that since Suo Pu and the others were from the Jinyiwei, they probably didn't have much literary talent. If they played something like linked verse or couplets and couldn't answer, it would be embarrassing. So he laughed: "We are drinking here for fun. Making it too profound would be meaningless. I think guessing riddles will do."

Xie Shiming said: "Master Mei's intention matches mine. I also don't like writing poetry. Yesterday, a regulated verse (Pailü) took half the night to fight through; I've had enough. Fortunately, there are many people here. Those who write poetry can just write poetry, those who guess riddles can just guess riddles. Since Master Mei is happy, why not give us one to guess?"

Mei Lun saw no objection and was about to come up with one when Master Xianhe said: "Let me pose an auspicious one for gentlemen to teach me: 'World Peace' (Tian Xia Tai Ping), guess a prefecture name."

Someone beside him said: "I guessed it, is it 'Pu'an'?"

Master Xianhe nodded: "Exactly." Then he posed another riddle: "'Heavenly azure peach planted with dew, sun-side red apricot grown leaning on clouds', guess a flower name."

Mei Lun clapped in praise: "What a clean and dignified topic! The inside must be good!"

Xie Shiming said: "I guessed it, it's 'Trumpet Creeper' (Ling Xiao Hua)."

A scholar beside him said: "Truly a good riddle! Often when people make flower names, they only talk about the first few words and ignore the word 'flower'. Like peony flower, only describing peony, not making out the 'flower' word. Who knew this riddle focuses entirely on the word 'flower'."

Xie Shiming said indifferently: "This is nothing, listen to mine: 'Straightaway treating officialdom as a theater', guess a line from the *Analects*."

Chang Qingyun laughed: "You are using Four Books topics, the most vulgar. I already know the answer, not rare."

Xie Shiming said: "Though the topic is vulgar, there are many wonders in it."

Someone joined in the fun: "This topic surface is refined and romantic, no need to say, the inside must be good."

Chang Qingyun said: "If it's good, hold your praise. You praise it all first, later when someone guesses it, there's nothing left to say."

Suo Pu couldn't bear it and whispered to Xie Peng: "What the hell is this?"

Xie Peng answered: "This is making riddles using content from the Four Books and Five Classics. Speaking of it, it's nothing rare, just 'Shi Er You' (acting excellently), I don't know why that fellow named Xie is so smug."

Suddenly heard someone slap the table: "Really good!" Everyone was startled and looked quickly, it was Master Xianhe.

Mei Lun asked: "What good did Master Xianhe see, to slap the table and beat the bench like this?"

Master Xianhe said: "'Straightaway treating officialdom as a theater', I guessed it, is it 'Shi Er You' (Officer and Actor / Official performs excellently)?"

Xie Shiming said: "Yes."

Mei Lun said: "What is wonderful about this riddle? Old Master is making such earth-shaking noise."

Master Xianhe clapped and praised: "This riddle originally is nothing, gentlemen can make and solve it. However, there is another universe inside. This is a notch higher than 'Trumpet Creeper'."

Chang Qingyun laughed: "In my view: all the same, what is the difference? If you say there is high and low, I don't accept it. If Master Xianhe can't give a valid reason, you will be penalized three cups of wine!"

Master Xianhe said: "Listen to me explain. He borrows and leaves aside, only this 'Er' (And/But) word jumps with empty spirit, truly describing it thoroughly. This riddle takes a person borrowing to make an empty word use extreme literary cleverness. For riddles, borrowing is best, direct meaning is second. But borrowing also has two grades. Like 'Scholar Unrivaled', guessing 'What is trust'; 'Qin King repeals expulsion order', guessing 'Believe this word'. Although these are also borrowing, they value the theme. The theme and the riddle surface are worlds apart, so this is second. Recently there is a type of counting classics, looking up many in encyclopedias all day. Who knows the posted paste is not dry, already swept away by wind and clouds, empty in an instant. This is third-rate goods."

This high theory made the gentlemen present nod frequently, all saying it was cleverly made, Mr. Xie had talent of eight dou, etc. Xie Shiming showed a look of satisfaction. At this moment, Suo Pu wanted to be like Li Kui, jump on the table and first shout: "Motherfucker, eat my machine gun!" He couldn't help whispering: "Truly a bunch of nonsense!"

Although the voice was small, Xie Shiming heard it indistinctly. He was already dissatisfied with this "distinguished guest" receiving such courtesy. Intent on embarrassing him, he raised his wine cup, toasted around, and said: "Gentlemen praise wrongly. Such beautiful scenery, I, untalented, write a poem to congratulate!"

Immediately he chanted loudly:

"Flying tower spans dangerous battlements, clouds and mist scatter at dawn.
Strategic shape for overlooking, proper for coming to banquet after work.
River crosses broad parapets, mountains enter strange window lattice.
Wind and moon originally priceless, Lordship moreover has poetry."

Everyone cheered. Chang Qingyun said: "Greatly has the mood of Song people." Master Xianhe sneered slightly but also followed in cheering. That Xie Shiming glanced smugly at Suo Pu and the others, seeing Xie Peng looking slightly indignant, Lin Ming still with a smiling face blending with the dust, but Suo Pu looking indifferent, obviously not hearing the flavor of this poem.

He couldn't help cursing secretly: "Truly playing lute to a cow!"

Master Xianhe said: "This poem is superbly made; we should drink a cup together to congratulate." Seeing everyone drink a cup, Master Xianhe put down the wine cup and sighed: "This Scholar Unrivaled is truly unrivaled! Pity the price is high and hard to get."

Chang Qingyun laughed: "What is difficult about this? If Old Mister likes, I have a few more bottles here; I'll send them to you tomorrow. I only ask Old Mister to write a few more poems and essays to go with the wine."

Master Xianhe smiled: "I return the original words, what is difficult about this?" knocking the bowl with chopsticks, he chanted slowly:

"Wine doesn't intoxicate, man intoxicates himself; drinking a thousand cups Liu Ling is ashamed.
Inviting Chang'e to drink facing the moon, a river of sorrow meets in wine.
Cooking sheep and slaughtering oxen for joy, must drink a thousand hundred cups at a sitting.
Don't laugh at the lord lying drunk at the table head; how many can understand the deep flavor of wine?"

The poetic meaning was very shallow, only counting as doggerel. Even Suo Pu could completely understand: this Master Xianhe seemed to be a man full of grievances. But seeing the songstress Yun Dang holding the pipa, cherry mouth mumbling the chant, eyes glancing constantly at Master Xianhe, obviously having admiration, he secretly wondered: what is there to admire about this semi-old man with a cut-sleeve fetish? His heart felt slightly sour.

After chanting, Master Xianhe drained the wine cup again and laughed: "Although the Kun people are hateful, their hundred crafts and tools are not without ingenuity, truly unique."

"If the Kun thieves were willing to turn their hearts to the court, it would be a blessing for my Great Ming."

"Their ships are sturdy and cannons sharp, soldiers good at fighting. If recruited and the whole army transferred to Liaodong to pacify the Eastern Barbarians (Manchus), win or lose, it would be a wonderful matter killing two birds with one stone."

"The Kun people claim to be descendants of Great Song, actually they are foreign barbarian breeds using a pretext." Xie Shiming said, "Those glass mirrors, thermos bottles, matches, are all strange skills and obscene cleverly made things. Hunger cannot satisfy, cold cannot clothe, just things adding flowers to brocade. Even those cannon and warships, seeming to surpass heavenly work, but if people all over the world rebel, what do a few cannon barrels matter? No matter how well warships are built, can they drive onto the shore? Regulating family, ruling country, pacifying the world, still relies on moral articles!"

Several old Confucian scholars nodded repeatedly, praising Xie Shiming: "Poem well made, insight even more thorough." Someone else spoke of the Kun thieves not following etiquette, mentioning many absurd and shameless things, which hooked everyone's interest in talking. For a time, various anecdotes flew around. Suo Pu shook his head repeatedly: these joke-makers truly existed since ancient times.

Master Xianhe said: "Heard Master Chang was once trapped in Lingao for several years, seeing real Kun with own eyes, why not talk about what was seen of Kun thieves?"

Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly: "Formerly following Commander He on campaign, defeated and trapped in Lingao. Truly my hateful matter. However, also thereby knew much inside information of Kun thieves..."

This was the truth. Chang Qingyun could mix into the Governor-General's staff largely because he was a rare talent locally who was proficient in "Kun Affairs."

"...This place is for pleasure; talking about fierce military matters is inevitably spoils scenery. While trapped in prison back then, finding joy in sorrow, wrote fifty poems of 'Lingao Bamboo Branch Songs', today let me chant a few for gentlemen to go with wine."

Suo Pu's heart skipped a beat. Unexpectedly, there was a captive who had been to Lingao here! This Chang Qingyun was probably one of the staff members of He Rubin captured during the Counter-Encirclement Campaign. To think he managed to mix into Xiong Wencai's staff to work!

Since he had been to Lingao, did he see through his disguise? Maybe he had even met him! Suo Pu remembered inspecting the POW camp. Of course, at that time he wouldn't have noticed if a character like Chang Qingyun was among that group of unlucky bastards with shaved heads wearing "new life clothes" and trembling.

Suo Pu forced himself to be calm, looking at this Juren master, seeing him composed, chanting:

"End of world Hainan road, there is county named Lingao. Earth hot suitable for ice, buildings high can pluck stars. Will sincere respecting worship, heart good valuing holding scripture. Only hate General Feihuang, weapons of war not pausing."

"Mountains and marshes gather spiritual beauty, layered peaks unfold painted eyebrows. Endowing people respecting women noble, on earth responding to Kun nourishment. Young girl red flower face, beauty white jade skin. Originating from heavy love, husband and wife happy to rely on each other."

"High pavilions layer upon layer up, luxurious mansions grand. Iron fences near doors dense, river water winding walls through. White walls painted literary colors, glass adorned brocade red. Most suitable to look from street, buildings in painting."

"Main roads mostly flat, strip upon strip of crossroads. Two sides go scholars and women, middle gallop carts. Night market people noisy shops, autumn night rain intertwining. Evening lamps hang by road edge, fire candles bright like stars."

He chanted one, appearing to explain slightly. Everyone's interest was greatly aroused, discussing animatedly.

Xie Shiming became somewhat unhappy. Seeing that he finally had a moment in the spotlight, only to have it snatched away by Master Xianhe and Chang Qingyun. He drank a few more cups, became somewhat reckless. His gaze swept to Suo Pu, remembering the comment "bunch of nonsense," and bore a grudge in his heart. Intending to embarrass him, he raised his wine cup: "Mr. Suo sits bored, why not also make a poem to add to the fun?"

Lin Ming saw the situation was bad: The Chiefs, although knowing astronomy above and geography below, versed in hundred crafts, were "ignorant" regarding poetry. Not to mention writing poetry, even a rhyming sentence was hard. He had seen the so-called new poetry of Australians in the Art Section of *Lingao Times*, things like "The Senate surpasses my dad", "The noodles I make are the best in the world"—if chanted out, these scholars would laugh their teeth off. It seemed this sour scholar intended to make Suo Pu unable to step down.

Suo Pu smiled faintly: "I am untalented, don't know these gadgets."

Mei Lun cried bad secretly, cursing this sour Xie for looking for trouble when full—many in Jinyiwei were from noble relatives, many unlearned in ink. Sweeping face like this in public, even if he didn't flare up now, harboring hatred back home might mean leading to a Big Case! Just about to speak to turn it around, Chang Qingyun already came out to smooth things over.

"Master Suo is a martial man, presumably not caring about poetry and songs. Come come come, I think we should call the young boys to sing tunes for amusement..."

Mei Lun quickly called two singers in to serve. The two young boys had already eaten the food cleanly. Suo Pu seeing them not only kneeling on the ground to eat, but licking the plates clean after eating, couldn't help frowning secretly. What kind of way was this? Were they starving badly? Hearing the call, the boys quickly came up, kowtowed thanks for the reward first.

"Pick obscene ones to sing, for gentlemen's wine!" Mei Lun laughed.

The young boys understood, sang another set of tunes. This was not "elegant" anymore, full of obscene words and erotic songs. Everyone had wine, laughing and noisy, making a racket.

Suo Pu seeing no meaning in staying here, signaled Lin Ming, stood up to leave. Chang Qingyun spoke a few polite words, just about to send off, Xie Shiming already drank somewhat drunk, borrowing wine to cover his face, played drunk: "Don't go... don't go... such peaceful prosperous age, fine time beautiful scenery, leave without enjoying fully, simply... simply... spoils scenery... absolutely cannot!" Saying so, he wanted to force wine on Suo Pu.

Suo Pu seeing them behaving so unbearably, originally angry in heart, now seeing this sour scholar acting drunk, sneered, said: "Peaceful prosperous age, fine time beautiful scenery? Roving bandits plague Central Plains, Eastern Barbarians repeatedly break border passes, living souls in misery... Gentlemen truly have good spirits, so-called 'Singing clearly in a leaking boat, drinking painfully under a burning house, not knowing drowning is imminent, sorrowful indeed!'"

These words were not loud, but like a bucket of ice water poured onto the noisy pleasure-seeking people. The huge floor instantly went silent.

Suo Pu added: "Last year I toured the Three Towns, ascended Yellow Crane Tower, saw an old scholar, feeling worried about the country's declining situation, wrote a poem on the wall—I can't write poetry, just present this to you." Saying so he raised voice and chanted slowly:

"Smoke trees gathered in gaze, wandering spirit in old country, river and mountain hegemonic qi remains floating foam. Yellow Crane returning should shed tears, tears full on tinkering islet. Mourning Great River autumn, just this much idle sorrow. Numerous banished guests and clear streams. Which hero ascends the supreme peak, crying bitterly for the Divine Land."

Finished chanting, he flicked his sleeve and left.

The group returned to the boat. Suo Pu just stayed silent. Lin Ming thought he lost face over the poetry matter, comforted: "Master Suo need not be vexed. The way of poetry is just a pastime gadget. Who relies on it to establish merit..."

Suo Pu said: "I am not vexed for this. What use are those few lines of poetry? I am just... just..." He didn't know what to say for a moment, after a while said, "These scholars, one out of a hundred, one out of tens of thousands, looking like this—what use to the country and people?"

Lin Ming thought this was strange. "Country" and "people" were not Australia's "country" and "people," why did an Australian Senator worry about this? Turning thoughts he understood, comforted: "Chief worries too much. Don't look at them knowing only *zhi hu zhe ye* now, writing a few crooked poems and being complacent. If one day Great Song opens civil service exams, they will learn Australian studies just the same..."

Just talking, suddenly someone reported: "Master Chang comes to visit."

"Eh? What is he here for?" Suo Pu looked at Lin Ming doubtfully, "Why didn't he talk about it upstairs just now if he had something to say?"

"Ask him in to talk, no harm." Lin Ming said, "At the wine banquet, perhaps some words couldn't be spoken."

"Good, then ask him in."

Both sides exchanged greetings. Suo Pu was thinking how to start, Chang Qingyun already opened the door to see the mountain: "This Master Suo, probably is a Chief (Shou Zhang), right?"

Suo Pu was stunned. Lin Ming already showed killing intent in eyes. Xie Peng also quietly revealed a dagger. Suo Pu shook head slightly, signaling not to act rashly: "Why do you say this?"

"Master Suo, I stayed in Lingao for a full year and a half." Chang Qingyun was calm and composed, "Digging sand, smashing stones, carrying earth, paving roads... did all work never done in this life, ate all bitterness never eaten in this life." He sighed, "Chiefs like Master Suo, I saw a dozen or so—naturally, they may not remember there was a character like me."

He continued: "...But anyone who has met Australian Chiefs a few times will absolutely not forget their expressions. Master Suo, don't look at your speech and behavior having no flaw, but that air on your face, one look knows it."

Suo Pu laughed: "Mr. Chang, you truly overpraised. Since so, what does your honor intend to do?"
