# Chapter 1244 - March Under the Moonlight

In the early morning of September 19th, the various fleets weighed anchor and set sail in sequence under the dawn light. Starting a voyage that would last 24 hours. After departing Penghu, the probability of encountering other forces increased drastically. Ming Qiu ordered the patrol boat squadron to disperse, forming a security perimeter of about five nautical miles around the formation. Any vessels encountered by patrol boats were to be detained and scuttled without exception.

That evening, the fleet arrived in waters near 40 nautical miles southwest of Kinmen Island. Before long, Ming Qiu ordered all warships to enter battle stations: boilers on all steam warships were fired up, thick black smoke pouring from every funnel; anti-projectile nets were raised one by one. Fire hoses were readied on decks, ammunition hoists checked. All wooden railings and non-essential components were dismantled and stowed below deck. This was to avoid injury from flying splinters upon shell impact, and also to prevent them becoming fuel if hit by enemy incendiary weapons. According to Special Recon intelligence, the Zheng family widely equipped various incendiary rockets on both ships and land.

Excess sails and rigging were dismantled; masts were bound tight with thin steel cables. Sandbags filled with sand were lashed around the bridge and gun positions. Everything was prepared according to 19th-century standards for fleets entering combat.

After completing all combat preparations, Ming Qiu ordered the ship's radio room to contact the Special Recon detachments that had landed at the various landing sites the previous day, confirming the current specific situations at Kinmen, Xiamen, Anping, and of the Zheng fleet.

The Special Recon report was very brief: "No abnormalities around targets. Seas around Kinmen are calm." Hearing this, a slight smile appeared on Ming Qiu's face.

Though knowing his side was "a tiger pouncing on a sheep," coordinating over a hundred ships tested the Senate Navy's daily training severely. However, given their technical superiority, minor errors and losses wouldn't affect the battle. What he worried about most was encountering bad weather. Although the probability of typhoons in late September wasn't high, a major storm could easily scatter the fleet. At that point, he could only withdraw troops to Kaohsiung and make new plans.

Moreover, if the seas in the combat zone were too rough, both bombardment and landing would be severely restricted. Sailing fleets were too influenced by nature.

Now the Special Recon report set his mind at ease; he just needed to execute the plan step by step.

At this time, the main force of the Zheng fleet was anchored in Liaoluo Bay. The Zhengs were primarily maritime merchants, so their ships were mostly merchant-warships combined; merchant ships were also warships, with no strict distinction. Merchant ships were universally equipped with cannons, differing only in number according to need.

The Zheng fleet at this time hadn't yet developed to its maximum historical scale. However, after successively defeating and swallowing up the major maritime gangs along the Fujian-Guangdong coast, his power had expanded to an unprecedented level. Ships going to Nanyang and Japan all flew his command flag. With a single order, he could mobilize thousands of ships of all sizes. Forming the largest fleet in East Asian waters.

But most of these ships weren't suitable for naval warfare. What truly allowed him to contend for maritime dominance were the largest sea vessels under his command. When Li Kuiqi rebelled and left, he took most of the warships. Xiong Wencan provided money and cannons to support Zheng Zhilong, enabling the Zheng family to build a batch of large Fujian-style warships. These ships not only far exceeded the government's 400-liao war junks in size but were also larger than most European merchant ships in the Far East.

His largest capital ships: Fujian-style three-masted gunships—according to Special Recon and Intelligence surveying, photography, and calculations. This ship type was about 61 meters in overall length, 53 meters waterline length, 13.8 meters beam, 13.0 meters waterline beam, 4.89 meters hold depth, 3.9 meters draft, displacing about 1200 tons. Each ship was equipped with 8-10 Red Barbarian Cannons. Since Fujian ships rarely used ribs and lacked molded depth, they couldn't install a through-deck gun deck below the main deck; all cannons had to be mounted on the main deck. This caused a high center of gravity. To avoid instability, the number and weight of equipped cannons were strictly limited. Thus, although Zheng Zhilong's warships rivaled European ships in size and tonnage, their cannon count was far below the average 24 cannons of European merchant ships, let alone those 32-gun warships specifically designed for naval combat.

In terms of gun numbers and projectile weight per volley, Zheng Zhilong's main 8-gun warships required at least four to match one European ship, so it wasn't strange that he had to rely on fire ships to win the Battle of Liaoluo Bay against the Dutch.

Of course, besides defending Zheng family maritime hegemony, these ships mostly acted as ocean-going merchant ships—after all, on overseas trade routes, danger of attacks by Chinese and foreign pirates was ever-present. Powerful armament was necessary to ensure safety. According to Special Recon surveillance, there were currently fourteen three-masted gunships anchored in the Anping, Xiamen, and Kinmen waters. Liaoluo Bay had the most: seven ships; Anping had four; Xiamen and Gulangyu had three.

Additionally, Special Recon also reported sighting three European-style vessels anchored at the above locations. Displacements ranged from 400 to 1200 tons. The largest "yacht" flew the Dutch East India Company flag, likely belonging to the Dutch factor in Fujian. The other two flew Zheng Zhilong's flag, possibly European ships he imitated or purchased—the Grand Library indicated records showing Zheng Zhilong had attempted to copy European-style ships.

Besides these three-masted gunships, the Zheng fleet had over a hundred two-masted Fujian and Guangdong ships equipped with more cannons. However, according to Special Recon reports, the number of Red Barbarian Cannons on these "secondary warships" was even fewer: only 2-4, with more personnel-killing weapons like Folangji breech-loaders. These ships were mostly anchored in the waters of Kinmen and Xiamen islands.

As for the armament on other ships, quality was even more varied: not only no Red Barbarian Cannons, but even Folangji cannons were rare. Various crudely made private cast iron cannons and iron guns filled them, even very ancient bowl-mouthed guns. They had almost no lethality against enemy ships and could only function at near-boarding ranges.

Zheng Zhilong and his other commanders knew very well that it was hard to win head-to-head battles against the Australians at sea. Thus they intended to use the old method used against the Dutch—fire ships. For this, over two hundred old ships filled with dry firewood were assembled in the Kinmen-Xiamen area. Additionally, various incendiary weapons like fire rockets and fire crows scavenged from Ming arsenals were equipped to each ship.

Even so, Zheng Zhilong was clear about the disparity in strength between himself and the Australians. Thus, on one hand, he sought external aid and collected European-style ships and guns; on the other, he strove to strengthen defenses at Anping and Xiamen. He sent men to buy a dozen of the largest and heaviest Red Barbarian Cannons from Guangdong, building batteries to strengthen Kinmen and Anping defenses. Also, iron chains and wooden booms were set at the entrance of Anping Harbor to prevent Australian ships from intruding. Besides recruiting local braves in Fujian, he also recruited blacks and Japanese familiar with firearms from Macau and elsewhere, purchasing large quantities of matchlocks.

Inside *Lichun's* radio room, ticking sounds never stopped. The Special Recon Team was transmitting the distribution of the Zheng fleet in the bay. New coordinates were marked one by one on the coordinate chart in the command room. By midnight, the positions of all major warships in the Zheng fleet had been re-marked.

At 4:00 AM on September 20th, Ming Qiu ordered all personnel to have their last pre-battle breakfast. One hour later, the First Fleet advanced in a single column. Leading were four sail-powered special service boats, followed by five steam-powered warships led by *Lichun*, with other sail special service boat squadrons following 1 nautical mile behind. All ships maintained strict blackout, with only navigation signal lights flashing faint glows.

Ming Qiu worried the overly bright moonlight would expose the fleet prematurely, but as they neared Kinmen, cloud cover increased, the moon appearing and disappearing among clouds. The silhouettes of the silent First Fleet warships were only reflected on the sea surface when the moon emerged from the clouds.

Relying on precise charts and navigation positioning, by 5:30 AM, Kinmen Island was faintly visible. Through telescopes, the forest of masts in Liaoluo Bay could barely be seen. Obviously, the opponent didn't worry about surprise attacks or knew nothing of light discipline; scattered lights on ships and shore indicated targets for the First Fleet.

Ming Qiu ordered all fleet personnel to battle stations, magazines opened, ready to fire at any moment.

Now, the main force of the First Fleet had entered Liaoluo Bay, sailing at 4 knots, port broadsides facing Liaoluo Bay. Since the range of the sailing ships' cannons was insufficient, the plan decided that the five steam warships equipped with rifled guns would fire first, disrupting the enemy before special service boats approached for bombardment.

Ning Liujin slept on the deck, covered by a mass of tattered fibers—maybe part of a fishnet, maybe sail or rope. It was dirty, smelly, and wet. But none of this disturbed him. He slept soundly; the sea waves weren't big, and the weather was fine, no rain—even if it rained, Ning Liujin could only stay in this spot trying to sleep—he wasn't qualified to sleep in the stern castle or cabins below deck.

Ning Liujin was an "apprentice." The boat owner was a distant relative who had a ship in the Zheng fleet. Fujian had many people and little land; Ning Liujin had no land to farm, and finding work as a tenant or long-term laborer was hard. His relative's ship happened to need a few hands, so Ning Liujin went—at least to earn a meal. If he was lucky enough to live a few more years, maybe he could earn some silver.
