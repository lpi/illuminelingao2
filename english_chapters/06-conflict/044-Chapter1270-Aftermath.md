# Chapter 1270 - Aftermath

There was a small residential area in the Nanhai Experimental Farm, built for the naturalized employees of the Agricultural Committee. These were standard dormitories built by the General Construction Company, similar to old-style tube-shaped apartment buildings. Wu Nanhai and several Senators working in the Agricultural Committee fenced off a small piece of land on one side of this dormitory area and built the Agricultural Committee Senator Dormitories.

The appearance of the Agricultural Committee apartments was similar to residential buildings from the 1980s, but only two stories high. The structure was similar to townhouses; each row had 8 units, each unit had two floors, with a small courtyard attached. The area ranged from 80 to 120 square meters.

Wu Nanhai applied for a large unit, and finally drew Unit 404 in Building 4. The entire "villa" had a layout of 4 bedrooms, 1 living room, 2 bathrooms, and 1 kitchen, with 120 square meters of usable area. The interior had simple whitewashed walls. The living room and bedrooms had bamboo flooring, while the bathroom and kitchen floors were tiled. The sanitary ware was a blue-and-white porcelain set chosen by Wu Nanhai according to his own preference, and the kitchen had a multi-burner stove. All were unified renovations by the General Office. Furniture and soft decorations were configured by the Senators themselves according to personal preferences. To ensure the safety of the Senators, these apartments had electricity supply just like the apartments in Bairen New City, equipped with electric lights and power sockets.

Wu Nanhai's home decoration was in a completely traditional style. A large south-facing room on the second floor was the master bedroom where Wu Nanhai slept. A rosewood canopy bed with hanging flower pillars lay in the deepest part of the room. Beside the bed were three layers of five stacked large official chests. A yellow rosewood shelf was used to hang clothes. A Chinese-style dressing table stood against the wall, inlaid with a large glass mirror produced in Lingao. In the middle of the room lay a flat-top desk, on which sat a mechanical alarm clock bought on Taobao. Adding two round stools, this was the entire configuration of the master bedroom. These pieces of furniture were bought by Wu Nanhai from the booty warehouse under the Planning Agency, mostly trophies from past battles. For example, the canopy bed was said to have been confiscated from a wealthy family in Sanliang City, Guangdong, during the Pearl River Estuary Campaign. The official chests and shelves were seized during the Hainan Pacification Campaign. When distributing the suites this time, the Planning Agency specially sorted out a batch of furniture from the warehouse to auction to the Senators uniformly.

Because of rumors that the former owners of this furniture had been killed, not many people were willing to buy them. Plus, due to usage habits, more people hoped to use modern home furnishings. But purchasing modern furniture required booking at least half a year in advance, and the specific delivery date was indefinite due to the priority given to the production tasks of the Engine Plan materials. Wu Nanhai didn't care much about this because of his religious beliefs, and he liked this "retro" style, so he bought them cheaply to decorate his apartment.

After washing up in the bathroom, Wu Nanhai came to the living room and sat on a folding chair, picking up the clear tea on the Eight Immortals table for a sip. The publications subscribed for every Senator by the Propaganda Department were already laid out on the table. Usually, there was only the *Lingao Times*, but today being Monday, there were additional weekly internal publications: *Weekly Trends* and *Morning Star*. These were the most important "Two Journals and One Newspaper" of the Lingao propaganda mouth. Among them, *Morning Star*, a theoretical journal, was restricted to Senators' reading and classified as confidential material not to be circulated externally. *Weekly Trends* was open to high-level naturalized citizens.

Wu Nanhai opened *Weekly Trends*. Besides publishing the Senate's current proposals and topics, the Executive Committee's work plans, projects, and execution progress, this journal also contained a compilation of important current events news from the Senate-ruled areas, the Ming Dynasty, and East Asia.

He skipped the recent series of reports on Operation Overlord—the final episode was published today. He wasn't very concerned about fighting. His gaze fell on the appendix section, which was the latest captured booty list tallied by the Planning Agency:

"...In the entire Operation Overlord, a total of 340,000 *shi* of grain, 1.1 million taels of silver and silver products of various purities, 20,000 taels of gold and gold products were seized. Various jewelry and soft goods filled 40 standard 50-liter transport boxes. 10,000 bolts of silk, 5,000 piculs of raw silk, 3,000 piculs of old raw silk were seized. 10,000 piculs of various spices, 55,000 pieces of porcelain, 30,000 bolts of cotton cloth, and 2,000 bolts of woolens were seized. Miscellaneous goods are countless; specific categories and numbers are being counted.

280,000 catties of firearms, cannonballs, fire weapons, swords, and spears were seized, along with 150,000 catties of various metal materials like copper, iron, and lead..."

*The Planning Agency has made a windfall this time,* Wu Nanhai thought. *If not for the newspaper saying the Zhongzuo Garrison dock was burned down, the haul would probably be even larger.* The situation of money and material shortage since the launch of the Engine Plan should be greatly alleviated. The purchase of large agricultural machinery he had applied for long ago could also be approved.

However, at least a large population was looted. These people looted from Fujian could be used to replenish Kaohsiung. The current climate and water in Taiwan were difficult for northern refugees to adapt to after all; supplementing with more Minnan-origin population who could adapt to the environment would be beneficial to the Development Group. Wu Nanhai knew the Executive Committee had high hopes for the agricultural development of the Tainan area, set on developing the Tainan Plain into the Senate's granary—he had to produce some results.

But the population loss in Tainan was too great. The northern population suffered from acclimatization in Tainan. Although strict disease control measures were taken, the death and sickness rates among immigrants in the Kaohsiung development remained very high. Now with these tens of thousands of Minnan people, it should be a great help to Tainan's agricultural development.

Although the "Two Journals" didn't have many pages, they contained a lot of information. Wu Nanhai just browsed them slightly before breakfast to grasp the trends; specific detailed study would wait until the dead of night. He then picked up today's *Lingao Daily*.

The layout production of the current *Lingao Times* was becoming increasingly professional. Each issue had 2 broadsheet sheets, totaling 16 pages. *Lingao Times* had cancelled the distinction between internal and external editions. The content leaned towards editorials, policy publicity, and popular science. Today's front-page news was a long report on Operation Overlord, "Calming the Seas and Pacifying the Waves," with a banner headline in the largest font. Next to it was a special commentator's article in bold type: "Establish a New Maritime Order, Promote Great Economic Development."

Wu Nanhai had no heart to read much; he had already read the content of the report in *Weekly Trends*. In terms of details, that was more abundant than this long report and closer to the truth. He turned to Section B. The lead part was a commentary article approving the Jeju Island Model signed by Heroine Yaolong—that is, Du Wen. The whole article was actually full of affirmation and praise for the Jeju Model. Compared to Du Wen's usual lengthy criticisms, this editorial was truly rare.

Below it, however, was a "Feature Story: The High-Spirited Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi."

*Reported by Lingao Times Intern Reporter Ge Sanpang*

*Today is the day of the attack on Zhongzuo Garrison City. On the sea, the sun is bright and the wind and waves are high. Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi, the eternal helmsman of the Marine First Expeditionary Detachment, insisted on landing with the Marines to command the battle in person. Hearing this news, the commanders of various companies of the Expeditionary Detachment panicked, not knowing what to do, so they dissuaded him one after another, saying that the waves on the sea were exceptionally rough and landing by boat was risky. Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi said heroically: "I like riding our Marine landing craft the best. You say the waves are rough and charging to land by boat is difficult, but charging without fear of danger can reflect the blood courage of our Marines. As the commander of the First Expeditionary Detachment, I should fight together with the Marines all the more." He said he wanted to go deep among the vast Marines and become one with them. No need to worry, set sail. Upon hearing this, the commanders looked at Chief Shi with tears in their eyes and reverence, secretly making up their minds to take Zhongzuo Garrison City.*

*Thus, Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi boarded a landing craft, riding the wind and breaking the waves towards the surging sea...*

*"Look! How fast our Marines are progressing, taking on a completely new look..."*

*"Our Navy's combat readiness is foolproof."*

*Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi stood on the swaying, spray-splattered deck, looking with satisfaction at the scene of the First Expeditionary Detachment setting sail. He continued to stand on the deck, talking to reporters, pointing out the programmatic guidelines for further developing Marine military power to the commanders accompanying the boat. At this time, a huge terrifying wave hit, coming with such force it seemed about to swallow the small boat. The commanders earnestly asked Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi to sit steady quickly. However, he remained nailed to the deck like a javelin, leaning on his command saber. He said: "No need to worry about me, just continue sailing." The people on the boat gazed admiringly at the Lieutenant Colonel's pine-like back, their eyes couldn't help but moisten again.*

*Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi said, to understand the life of the Expeditionary Detachment, one must come to the sea to see how they struggle against the surging waves.*

*The wave crests became higher, and the wind became more violent. The waves rushed towards the ship, shaking the hull violently. Even those well-trained Marines felt a bit unable to support themselves. Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi's clothes were wet by the splashing spray, but he remained unmoved. At this moment, he was the sea-calming needle of the First Expeditionary Detachment.*

*Approaching. When the landing craft approached the beach, Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi ordered the First Expeditionary Detachment to disembark and land. At this time, the Voight-Kampff Army military reporters jumped off the small boat first. They carried cameras, ready to record the moving scene of Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi wading ashore. Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi, with a pipe in his mouth and a command saber at his waist, held his head high and chest out, seawater submerging his knees... What an exciting scene! The photographers captured this moving scene in good time. It was only a distance of dozens of steps from the landing craft to the shore, but Lieutenant Colonel Shi Zhiqi's heart was filled with a thousand emotions: "Although I only took dozens of steps to reach the land, these dozens of steps are the most far-reaching steps in my life. When I finished these dozens of steps and stood on the beach, I knew the Marine First Expeditionary Detachment is invincible. We came to strike the enemies of the Senate, because on the corpses of the enemies there, shines the glorious badge of the First Expeditionary Detachment!"*

"These Propaganda people must have graduated from the North Bang Propaganda Academy!" Wu Nanhai put down the newspaper dully.
