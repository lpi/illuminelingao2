# Chapter 1293 Destination

The troops of the Shandong Field Headquarters fled all the way into Laizhou territory before receiving support from the troops led by Sun Yuanhua, repelling the pursuing rebels.

Although the rebel army led by Li Jiucheng had imposing momentum like a rainbow, it was freezing cold and snowy with difficult roads after all. The infantry couldn't keep up with the team, and only some cavalry carried out the pursuit, but they soon became exhausted and could hardly move an inch. When they chased into Laizhou territory and encountered the obstruction of government troops led by Zhang Tao, they withdrew their troops and returned.

Although the rebels were able to defeat the entire army of the Shandong Field Headquarters in this battle, they failed to inflict heavy damage on the government army. Although the government troops suffered heavy losses in baggage, the elite main force remained basically intact. After retreating into Laizhou territory and reorganizing slightly, they set up camp under Laizhou City.

Laizhou city gates had long been tightly closed. Zhu Dadian, Xie Sanbin and others urged the generals to repeatedly appease the routed troops, which suppressed the clamor of the routed soldiers demanding to enter the city.

After an emergency meeting of officials and gentry in the city, Prefect Zhu and Magistrate Hong immediately gathered the Paili leaders in the city, ordering the rich households to provide grain and the poor households to cook. Huge quantities of mixed grain pancakes and steamed corn bread were made and lowered down the city walls in baskets. In addition, the gentry in the city were again asked to make "voluntary donations".

The Laizhou gentry, who had already suffered heavy losses, made "voluntary donations" once again. Last time, it was the rebels attacking the city, and the gentry did it for survival. Although their hearts ached, they were still willing. Now tens of thousands of government troops gathered outside the city, just after a new defeat, lacking clothes and food, and it was freezing cold outside. If they didn't get food to send them away, it was unknown whether they would loot Laizhou City first if something went wrong. So each and every one of them, full of reluctance, had to pledge silver and grain.

The common people in the city inevitably were also extorted. For a time, Laizhou City was in turmoil, with cries shaking the sky. Sun Yuanhua, Zhu Dadian, Xie Sanbin and others urged the generals of various battalions, and after spending some effort, finally suppressed the routed troops outside the city.

Zhu Dadian and others entered the city and temporarily stayed at Sun Yuanhua's Governor's Yamen—the Laizhou Prefectural School. He first met with the generals of the Shandong Field Headquarters in batches, comforting them one by one warmly, and asking the generals to restrain their troops and prepare to meet the rebels. He also met with the generals under Sun Yuanhua and praised them for being "loyal to state affairs". Finally, he met with Huang Ande.

Huang Ande was not a military officer of the Imperial Court, but just a village brave leader. Zhu Dadian's reception this time could be called a "special honor". Naturally, Zhu Dadian did this not only to reward him for saving his life, but also as a measure to win over Manor Lord Lu.

This Manor Lord Lu's village braves were not only brave, but every move they made had the posture of elite soldiers, definitely not comparable to ordinary village braves. No wonder he could stand firm in Huang County with just a stockade and help Sun Yuanhua defend Laizhou.

It seemed that to wipe out the rebels, the power of local gentry and powerful landlords still had to be leveraged. Zhu Dadian chatted casually with Huang Ande for a few sentences. Hearing that he was also from a hereditary military household in Shandong, he praised him quite a bit and awarded him fifty taels of silver.

After everything was arranged properly, Zhu Dadian sat dully in the signing room, still feeling shaken—he was by no means a timid person afraid of death, but such an overnight change of victory and defeat, an earth-shaking change, was really unbearable. Thinking that after taking office, just urging the suppression government troops from various places to advance had cost endless effort, and after finally reaching the walls of Dengzhou, in order to maintain morale and military discipline, he had vomited his heart's blood, almost to the point of mental and physical exhaustion. Unexpectedly, a slip-up in the rear route led to a complete defeat in an instant.

Thinking about the tens of thousands of troops outside the city again, although they had settled down temporarily, after the new defeat, it would be difficult to sustain grain and pay for a while. If time dragged on, it would be difficult to suppress them. Moreover, there were many Liaodong people in the army. In case they were "seduced" by the rebels... Zhu Dadian felt restless even when sleeping and eating thinking of this. For a time, he sighed repeatedly and paced around the room.

With the breaking of the siege of Dengzhou, a new wave of mutual attacks set off in the court. For a time, all factions made a big fuss about this matter and submitted impeachment memorials. Chongzhen's desk was piled high with impeachment memorials.

"All nonsense with nothing substantial!" He irritably threw a memorial impeaching Xie Sanbin aside and stood up. The eunuchs and palace maids beside him raised their eyelids slightly, seeing that he had no intention of going out nor seemed to want tea, they quickly lowered their eyes again and stood there without daring to breathe loudly.

He originally thought that conquering Dengzhou would be a matter within the year. Unexpectedly, Zhu Dadian failed on the verge of success, allowing the rebels to burn the grain depot and break the siege in one fell swoop. An army of thirty thousand—including the Guan-Ning battalions known as Iron Cavalry which the court spent a lot of money to maintain—was actually beaten into a rout under Dengzhou City and fled all the way to Laizhou.

Now tens of thousands of troops gathered in Laizhou, lacking both grain and fodder and baggage, and it was freezing cold. If handled improperly, a mutiny might break out again.

Chongzhen sighed heavily: Mutiny, mutiny. In these years, government troops fighting rarely brought him good news, but always made mutinies. In the past when his father was alive, although he rarely attended court, such things rarely happened; when his elder brother was on the throne, everything was manipulated by the Wei eunuch (Wei Zhongxian), and mutinies only happened occasionally.

Since he ascended the throne more than five years ago, mutinies, floods and droughts had been constant. Was it because his virtue was insufficient? Or more terribly: Was the qi number (destiny) of the Great Ming running out?

Thinking of this, he couldn't help being startled and secretly scolded himself for thinking nonsense.

The grain transshipped to Qingzhou had mostly been lost, and it was inevitable to re-plan the transportation—just this point made his heart ache endlessly. Although grain was tight, there was still a lot of stock in the government granaries in Tongzhou and Jiangnan, but the high transshipment costs made him feel shocked every time.

Thinking that not long ago Zhu Dadian also reported floods in the whole province of Shandong, from inland to the seaside, all prefectures and counties suffered from floods. Zhangqiu, Xincheng, Qixia, Jinxiang and other places suffered repeated floods, requesting him to exempt taxes in these places and provide relief. To rescue the troops of the Shandong Field Headquarters, not only could the grain of Shandong province itself not be counted on, but extra grain had to be allocated to relieve the people...

Thinking of what kind of complaining face the Minister of Revenue would have, he felt more and more irritable and uneasy.

Lack of money, lack of soldiers, lack of grain, and also lack of capable personnel—although there were many officials, few could get things done. Chongzhen originally intended to strip Sun Yuanhua of his post and erase his status once Dengzhou was conquered, but in the current situation, if he really drove Sun Yuanhua away, the situation in Dengzhou and Laizhou might become even harder to handle—Gao Qiqian mentioned in his secret memorial that the defeat in Dengzhou relied entirely on Sun Yuanhua leading the army to respond so as not to be completely wiped out. Even Zhu Dadian was saved by Sun Yuanhua's subordinates.

Zhu Dadian and Xie Sanbin's memorials also mentioned Sun Yuanhua's support. It seemed that this Sun Yuanhua could still be considered a person who worked with a sincere heart.

"However, this old fellow is truly hateful!" Chongzhen thought. If it weren't for his improper handling at the beginning, how could Dengzhou have eroded to this extent!

Thinking of this, he couldn't help hating Zhu Dadian even more for "failing the Emperor's grace". If it weren't for his incompetence, how could he be so indulgent towards Sun Yuanhua!

On the imperial desk, there were several memorials impeaching Zhu Dadian for "corruption" and Sun Yuanhua for "colluding with Liaodong people", each told vividly. According to his wish, he really wanted to issue a decree right then to strip them of their posts and arrest them to bring to the capital for strict interrogation, but the current situation was really not suitable for changing commanders just before battle.

The plan for now was to transport grain and pay to Laizhou as soon as possible to help the army, so as to prevent changes. Thinking of this, he forced himself to cheer up and returned to the imperial desk.

Although the rebels won a great victory and captured countless baggage, after the excitement of victory passed, Li Jiucheng, Kong Youde and others found that their strategic situation had not changed much—although the government army's encirclement was broken for a time, the main force of the government army still existed, and their side was just lingering on their last breath.

Several people discussed. Now either take advantage of the remaining prestige of the great victory, the high morale of their side, and the government troops being newly defeated and lacking grain, to gather the whole army to attack. If they could inflict heavy damage on the government troops, the court's attitude might soften; or raise sails and go to sea, fleeing to Dongjiang.

The former, although there was some certainty, but this place was hundreds of li away from Laizhou. Outside was ice and snow, their side was also short of grain, and there were not many winter clothes. Marching all the way to fight under Laizhou City like this, attrition due to freezing, starvation and fatigue along the way would be significant. Even if they barely reached the city, it would probably be difficult to engage the government troops.

The latter was fleeing for life, with great certainty—they had hundreds of ships from the original Dengzhou Navy and the Tianjin Navy captured earlier, as well as a batch of ships brought by defectors from Dongjiang Town available. Although they couldn't take all the men and horses, it was still possible to transport the main generals and most of the direct line troops.

As long as they could leave Dengzhou smoothly, there were many islands in the Bohai Bay. It was not difficult to find a place to stay. They could also echo with the Dongjiang old troops scattered on the islands of the Bohai Sea. The difficulty was that once at sea, drifting on the ocean, there would be no way to raise grain and pay. Without grain and pay, this lone army would sooner or later fall into chaos without fighting.

At that time, there would be no way to survive except surrendering to the Tartars.

But this choice was hard for them to accept. Most of them fled to Dongjiang because they couldn't bear the oppression of the Manchus, and had strong conflicting emotions against the Tartars. They would absolutely not take this road unless they were at the end of their rope.

"No, if it really doesn't work, we'll go to Joseon (Korea)!" Li Jiucheng said, "The Joseon Dynasty is weak, and its armaments are not strong. Let's go to Joseon and occupy a piece of land, gather the Dongjiang brothers, maybe we can have a new situation!"

"That's the only way." Although Kong Youde agreed, he disapproved of Li Jiucheng's idea—although the Joseon Dynasty was weak, it was a country after all. In these years, in order to guard against the Tartars and Dongjiang Town occupying the magpie's nest, heavy troops were also deployed along the Yalu River. After their side went to sea, they would have no way to coerce men and horses. Although the men and horses on the various islands of Dongjiang mostly had rifts with the current Commander-in-Chief Huang Long, they had fought and killed each other more than once, and the contradictions were sharp and complex. Not all of them would necessarily listen to their orders.

They could only rely on the direct line troops in hand to confront tough with toughness. One death would mean one less. Moreover, the court would inevitably join forces with Josen to suppress...

However, there was extensive freezing in the Bohai Sea in winter. Once at sea, if slightly careless, the fleet would get stuck in floating ice, so they could only continue to stick to Dengzhou, at least until the beginning of next spring when the ice melted before making plans.
