# Chapter 1280 Resolution

Ma Qianzhu spoke up. "How much information do we have on Black?"

"According to Rando, Black was temporarily recruited by Paul to help. Rando believes he was involved in arms dealing and may have worked as a mercenary or terrorist." Xu Ke paused. "Reportedly, this individual is... highly unfriendly."

"I'm finished. Please continue."

"According to the captives' confessions, when Mr. Paul first arrived, he proposed cooperating with the Zheng family to establish a munitions workshop on Gulangyu. To that end, he demonstrated several firearm samples for them." Xu Ke continued methodically. "The demonstration was conducted in secret. The captives don't know what the Zheng family's leaders witnessed, but after this presentation, the family's attitude toward him underwent a complete transformation. It was likely some kind of weapon with... subversive implications."

Qian Shuiting raised an objection. "I have a question. Just now, the PPT displayed several pieces of equipment surpassing the average level of this time-space. I find that quite incredible. We were only able to build our industrial base at this scale because we arrived prepared—manpower, materials, knowledge. If Black is operating as an individual, how can he possibly possess such capability?"

"I consulted several Senators in the Manufacturing Supervision Department on precisely this point. Here is their answer." Xu Ke retrieved a document and read aloud: "'Judging solely from the photos of items and buildings currently submitted to us for review, the technical content contained offers certain advantages compared to the 17th century, but the overall application level is very crude. The materials and technological means used in constructing these items did not exceed the capabilities of the 1630s.'"

"So you're saying Black's technology is relatively primitive?"

"That is indeed what the Manufacturing Supervision Department concluded." Xu Ke nodded. "I specifically asked them to evaluate whether a single person could accomplish this. Their answer: yes. The premise being that sufficient manpower and materials are at his disposal. Allow me to read another relevant passage:

"'In terms of technical level alone, the details required to realize windmills and reverberatory furnaces are not complex. However, given the craftsmanship and material standards of this era, implementation would inevitably demand substantial manpower and resources.'"

"So Mr. Black himself is also an engineering and technical expert?" Qian Shuiting found this difficult to accept. As a "redneck" from the States, he was considered someone with strong hands-on ability back home. Asking their brothers to build a Kentucky rifle using modern equipment would be manageable—but constructing a reverberatory furnace clearly exceeded their capabilities.

"Very likely." Xu Ke nodded. "Although we haven't yet captured products reflecting his true technical level, judging from available materials, the items he organized local manpower and resources to manufacture should be far inferior to products made under our industrial system. Yet they would still exceed the technical level this era should possess."

"Figuratively speaking, he can manufacture usable flintlock guns but cannot make Minié rifles. Is that what you mean?"

"On that specific question, here is what the industrial sector Senators said." Xu Ke read again: "'In terms of manufacturing individual weapons, tools, or equipment, we believe this traveler, given cost-no-object investment, may be able to produce Minié rifles. However, he does not possess the ability to mass-produce them. The safety and durability of such rifles would also present significant problems...'"

"Synthesizing the above analysis, we can draw a conclusion: Black did not perish in the storm. On the contrary, he survived—and has transformed into a Japanese Christian, Mr. Paul, who now opposes us."

Silence descended over the room.

Wen Desi's voice broke it. "Where is Black now?"

"We failed to obtain direct intelligence from the Zheng family, so his current location remains unknown." Xu Ke glanced at Jiang Shan, who gave a slight nod. "But we have formed a conjecture."

"Go on."

Xu Ke paused to take a sip of water.

"Not long ago, during our Operation Hunger against the Manila galleons, we detected some highly irregular activities. The Spaniards were purchasing large quantities of certain goods in the Americas—goods they had not purchased before, or had purchased only rarely. Combined with indications that Spain is actively recruiting Chinese craftsmen through Macau, we believe Manila is likely engaged in the same effort as the Zheng clique."

"You're suggesting the Spaniards are upgrading their armaments?" asked He Ming, Director of Military Affairs.

Jiang Shan answered. "We have not yet obtained definitive intelligence, but based on current circumstances, the probability is high."

"Do we have anyone in Manila?" Qian Shuiting asked.

"Rando is en route and should arrive soon." Jiang Shan replied.

"Why send him?"

"After Operation Hunger concluded, we detected the cargo anomalies. We dispatched him to assess the situation and hopefully establish a spy network in Manila. Senator Rando has some familiarity with conditions there, and he is European. The Spaniards maintain strict control over the Chinese, so our options are limited."

Qian Shuiting did not press further.

Zhao Manxiong spoke. "That is to say, even if Rando hadn't volunteered, we could only have sent him?"

"Yes. He is the most suitable candidate."

"This represents a major threat to the Senate. Clearly, events not recorded in history are unfolding there. The Spaniards are improving their weapons—and we don't know their intentions. This is extremely dangerous. We must ascertain the truth and formulate countermeasures as quickly as possible." Wen Desi's tone was conclusive.

"We can only wait for Rando's first report."

"But if Xu Ke's inference is correct, Rando's situation becomes quite perilous. Black and Rando know each other—every disguise we crafted for Rando would be exposed. Therefore, I propose suspending the Manila operation and withdrawing Rando. We can reassess after gathering additional intelligence."

"Reassess how? Who will verify the situation if no one goes?" another voice challenged. "This isn't the 21st century, where we have other reconnaissance means. Here, there is no method besides deploying intelligence agents."

Jiang Shan pushed back. "But this would place Rando in mortal danger. Black knows him. A traveler arms dealer suddenly appearing as some Count Vannuova, sailing a modern-style yacht—Black isn't a fool. He will understand exactly what it means. He will kill Rando, then burrow deeper into hiding. Finding him again will be nearly impossible."

"Then instruct Rando to maintain a lower profile. He needn't play the Count. He's not 007."

"The European circle in Manila is quite small. A newcomer will attract attention regardless." Jiang Shan wielded the External Intelligence Bureau's professional expertise.

Chen Haiyang spoke for the first time. "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you capture the tiger's cub? Warfare is dangerous. Intelligence work carries danger as well. We cannot refuse to act simply because risks exist."

"But this is no longer risk—this is sending him to his death."

"How can you be so certain? Did we not just establish that Black's survival and presence in Manila are merely speculation? Perhaps the facts differ. Perhaps he isn't in Manila at all."

"But *if* Black is there, we are sending Rando to die. The discovery in Xiamen is critically important—I understand everyone's concerns. But urgency is no reason to take unnecessary risks. Once Rando is exposed, he won't give us any opportunity for rescue. We can train a cadre of Filipino indigenous agents who will be better positioned to collect local intelligence. It presents many difficulties, but there is always a way. Every Senator is precious to us..." Jiang Shan's voice rose with conviction.

"Rando and Black crossed over on the same boat, didn't they?" Zhao Manxiong's sudden interjection cut through the debate.

The room fell silent. The temperature seemed to drop.

"After witnessing the Senate's strength, I cannot believe Rando would make such a foolish choice." Jiang Shan's response was measured but firm.

Wen Desi's voice was quiet. "Then let him prove his loyalty conclusively."

"I must reiterate: this is an extremely dangerous operation. Rando may very well lose his life."

"So, Director Jiang, you still recommend suspending the operation?"

"Yes. Suspend temporarily. Make the next decision after obtaining more intelligence. Otherwise, we may alert our target prematurely." Jiang Shan held his ground.

Zhao Manxiong cleared his throat. "Everyone. Continuing to debate this point here is meaningless. Rando departed days ago. He's traveling by ordinary merchant ship without radio. Even if we cancel the operation now, we cannot notify him. Even if we dispatch a messenger aboard the 901 to pursue him, catching up would be nearly impossible.

"Secondly, Rando's situation carries particular... complications. Subjecting him to a test from the Senate is worth considering. We currently have Black in Manila giving us headaches—let us keep our priorities straight. I propose Rando's operation proceed, but with appropriate preparations. As the saying goes: don't put all your eggs in one basket. We should prepare a Plan B. Deploy a second team to Manila to support him—to ensure Rando's operation can succeed, or to rescue him in the event of failure."

The attendees nodded in agreement.

"I recommend the External Intelligence Bureau continue managing this work," Zhao Manxiong continued. "You may request that the Executive Committee authorize use of the Special Reconnaissance Team and Navy forces for support."

"No objection." Wen Desi scanned the room. "Does anyone else have a different view?"

Jiang Shan asked the necessary question. "What if Rando truly is a traitor?"

Wen Desi was silent for a moment. "If Rando betrays the Senate, we shall bring him before our special tribunal to face trial according to law."

The attendees felt that while imperfect, this plan at least accounted for all contingencies. No one raised an objection.

Wen Desi spoke the final words. "Regardless of what we discover in Manila, Black and everything he brought must be purified."
