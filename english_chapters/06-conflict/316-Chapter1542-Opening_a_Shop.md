# Chapter 1542 - Opening a Shop

Sima Qiudao knew little about the true purpose of coming to Lingao; he was here entirely on his master's orders. Though his master had been vague, even evasive, the Cropped-Hairs of Lingao had gained some minor fame in the *jianghu* over recent years.

The various Central Plains sects had had no contact with the Cropped-Hairs in the past, but lately they had all heard of their deeds and seen some Australian goods. Take his Qingcheng Sect: every year when disciples from various places offered birthday gifts to the masters and uncles, Australian goods were among them. Sima Qiudao had seen kerosene lamps in his master's room and glimpsed a compact with a small mirror gifted by a lover hidden in a junior sister's room. As for matches—though expensive in Sichuan due to the distance—they were extremely convenient for *jianghu* people constantly on the move and camping out at night, so almost everyone had them.

But these were indirect impressions. For them, the most direct sense of the Cropped-Hairs' power came from the Qiwei Escort Bureau, which had suddenly swelled in size across Liangguang and Jiangnan over the past five years.

This escort bureau had been obscure, its martial lineage trivial, its scale small, and its routes short. Now, Qiwei Escort Bureau was a behemoth in Liangguang, and its relationship with the Cropped-Hairs was practically an open secret there.

Now, branches of various Qiwei industries were appearing in the Northern and Southern Capitals, Jiangnan, and major towns along the Grand Canal. Sima Qiudao and his group had enjoyed quite a few Qiwei services on their journey—especially the long-distance through-travel service: once you bought a through-ticket, all transportation, food, lodging, luggage handling, and checkpoint clearances... Qiwei arranged everything. The employer didn't need to worry about a thing. Even requests for girls or boys to relieve loneliness on the road were fulfilled if asked. As for en-route protection, that was a core strength of an escort bureau and went without saying.

This service system won the hearts of officials and nobles. Previously, to ease the hardships of travel, they had to bring many servants, which increased costs. Even with such fanfare, things didn't always go smoothly. Qiwei provided similar services at a lower price, naturally capturing the market quickly—especially after the court cut the postal relay system a few years ago, expanding the market further.

From the moment Sima Qiudao left Sichuan by water to Hankou, Qiwei had provided services all the way south to Guangzhou. If not for "Seventh Master's" *Summary of Pacifying the Cropped-Hairs* emphasizing not to touch any Qiwei industries after reaching Guangzhou, he would have let Qiwei handle the boat tickets to Lingao too.

Sima Qiudao naturally knew this trip was likely ordered by the court—otherwise, these major sects, outwardly harmonious but inwardly divided, wouldn't have joined forces to send their key members into such danger. Even the Mount Hua Sect, with its murky ties to certain bandit leaders, had unhesitatingly sent Huang Zhen. The Cropped-Hairs certainly commanded a lot of "face"!

Daylight had broken. The two Eight Immortals tables Sima Qiudao had slept on now became dining tables. Nan Wan'er, responsible for cooking, brought out the porridge and dishes one by one. A pot of thick brown rice porridge, a pot of Lingao rice noodles with dried shrimp, and several cut salted eggs.

This breakfast was quite substantial by the standards of this timeline. After all, martial artists had high caloric needs; they needed not just to be full but to consume significant protein—hence the saying "poor scholars, rich martial artists."

"Porridge, rice noodles, salted eggs every day—can't you change it up? You've been cooking for over a decade; haven't you improved at all?" The speaker was a girl in a peach-red skirt, with bright eyes, white teeth, and picturesque features. She was twenty, well-proportioned, with a full chest and slender waist—curvaceous and stunningly beautiful. With hands on hips, she didn't look like a lady, but her dazzling beauty and the heroic air she exuded made men intimidated. This was evident from the fact that she occupied one end of the table alone, and no one was willing to sit next to her.

She was scolding Nan Wan'er like a servant girl. Though Nan Wan'er was much older, she could only stand with hands at her sides and listen, daring not to argue. She and this Zhou Zhongjun were disciples of the same generation in the Hengshan Sect, but their status was vastly different. Zhou Zhongjun came from a powerful local family with money and influence, while Nan Wan'er was an abandoned infant her master had picked up from the foot of the mountain.

Even their masters had vastly different statuses within the sect. Nan Wan'er's master wasn't a key figure in the Hengshan Sect; with average martial arts, she rarely traveled down the mountain. She only managed miscellaneous chores within the sect. While Zhou Zhongjun practiced martial arts with her master, Nan Wan'er helped in the kitchen, so naturally her skills weren't much.

Seeing her junior sister finish venting, Nan Wan'er said carefully, "There's nothing good to eat here. Except brown rice, it's rice noodles. Getting meat isn't easy—the market is full of dried fish and shrimp, but I was afraid people wouldn't be used to it, so I didn't verify buy much."

"I heard long ago that Lingao has everything delicious, with many Australian snacks never heard of before. Why have we been eating these rice noodles with stinking fish sauce for days? It's not like we're spending your pauper's money—why be stingy? Unless the cook steals, the grain doesn't rise?" Zhou Zhongjun was relentless.

Nan Wan'er swallowed her pride and whispered in defense, "Seven or eight of us living here—daily expenses aren't small..."

She had come along not for her martial arts, but simply as someone to clean and cook and manage daily expenses. Bluntly, she was just a team housekeeper.

After arriving in Nanbao, buying food and cooking and managing household accounts were all Nan Wan'er's responsibility. Feeding and watering seven or eight people was no small expense.

They didn't lack money—team leader Huang Zhen had brought plenty of gold and silver. But gold and silver couldn't circulate locally. Until Seventh Master exchanged it for them, they had to rely on the limited circulation vouchers Huang Zhen had exchanged in Guangzhou. Naturally, they had to be frugal.

Managing the daily needs of so many people was a thankless task to begin with. Being talked about behind her back wasn't new. Zhou Zhongjun's public attack seemed unreasonable and bratty, but actually, quite a few people were nodding secretly.

Seeing the atmosphere in the room turn sour, Nan Wan'er blinked twice, mist forming in her eyes, and moments later tears were swirling in them.

She was naturally charming. Now, adopting this submissive, aggrieved, pitiful posture, the men present couldn't help feeling protective.

Comparing the situation, Huang Zhen quickly stepped in to smooth things over. "Earlier, public funds were low, so we had to be frugal. Now the first batch of money has arrived. Everyone's worked hard these days; let's make do with breakfast, and tonight have Miss Nan make a good meal to sacrifice to our five viscera temples!" He called to Nan Wan'er: "I have money here. Take it later and buy some meat in the market."

With this, the awkward atmosphere relaxed. Frankly, everyone was tired of eating brown rice, dried roasted fish, and shrimp-paste stir-fried water spinach every day. Hearing about a feast tonight, smiles appeared on their faces.

Sima Qiudao ate his rice noodles silently but disapproved inwardly. *We're out on a mission—nothing done yet, and already fighting over a meal. Zhou Zhongjun really doesn't understand the big picture. Why bring her along?*

In his view, both Zhou Zhongjun and Nan Wan'er were too conspicuous. Not only too beautiful, but their style and mannerisms screamed *jianghu*. Since the Cropped-Hairs had subdued the Qiwei Escort Bureau, they surely had various martial arts sellouts under them. If noticed, the Cropped-Hairs would be on guard.

After breakfast, as everyone was about to rise, Huang Zhen said, "Everyone stay a moment. I have something to say."

Nan Wan'er continued clearing the dishes, clearly not thinking Huang Zhen's words concerned her.

"Miss Nan, please sit first. You can clear the dishes later," Huang Zhen said gravely.

"We are all martial arts colleagues, so I'll speak frankly and skip the pleasantries! We are under orders to infiltrate Lingao. Though we don't yet know what the mission is, this place is different from the Ming. We have no local contacts here, and the Ming has no say. So in everything we must be careful and not reveal a single slip." He glanced at everyone present. "You know in your hearts that most of us bear the marks of our trade. Standing in a crowd, open your mouths and people know what you are. The Cropped-Hairs patrol strictly. Don't go out without reason—if you must, notify Sima or me beforehand."

Most present were experienced in the *jianghu* and knew Huang Zhen wasn't exaggerating. They listened with bated breath.

"A group of us, unrelated, living together like this attracts too much attention. So, next, we will open a shop..."

"Open a shop?!" Zhou Zhongjun asked curiously.

"Yes, open a shop." Huang Zhen nodded. "Using the shop as cover gives everyone an identity. Moving around Lingao will be much easier. Furthermore..."

Furthermore, there was the gold and silver he carried as operating funds. Though gold and silver could be openly exchanged for circulation vouchers at the Delong Nanbao Branch, without a legitimate declared use, the Cropped-Hairs would immediately target them—the *Summary of Pacifying the Cropped-Hairs* stated that Lingao shops and banks were obligated to report suspicious monetary transactions.

"What kind of shop?" a middle-aged man asked. "Talking business, every sect has shops in its name, but those are managed by shopkeepers and clerks below. We don't know how."

"A medicine shop!"

"Medicine shop?" The middle-aged man paused, then slapped his thigh. "Shopkeeper Huang, you really can think! A medicine shop is good!"

A "medicine shop" was similar to a private clinic. Those opening such shops weren't famous doctors, but mostly people with a specialized skill: massage, acupuncture, bone-setting, etc. Open a shop, wait for business, and sell some semi-mystical homemade remedies.
