# Chapter 1404 - Guidance

The interrogation did not last long. From his brief observation of just a few minutes, Qian Shuixie knew that Jia Le had not truly prepared herself for sacrifice—perhaps she was not afraid of death, but she might not be able to withstand mental and physical torment.

For a girl like this, there was no need for formal torture; mere threats of violation and beatings were enough to shatter her psychological defenses and make her submit completely. Xue Ziliang had said as much when instructing the Special Investigation Team in interrogation and torture techniques: many human trafficking and organized prostitution rings controlled the women they had abducted in exactly this way.

Qian Shuixie naturally was not willing to do something so beneath his dignity. Although the Council of Elders was quite unscrupulous, on certain moral bottom lines everyone still tacitly acknowledged some basic principles.

The Special Investigation Team had members who had received specialized interrogation training, but using psychology and logic to extract confessions was a skilled art, and skilled arts required extensive practice to master. The Special Investigation Team obviously killed more often than it interrogated, so more often than not it resorted to crude but relatively civilized methods.

Several team members directly brought Jia Le's parents into the interrogation room. Before her eyes, they were stripped and bound. Then a burly man produced a sharp knife and began to gesture menacingly.

Less than five minutes after threatening to slowly flay them to death, Jia Le's spirit collapsed. She struggled desperately in her chair, wailing and screaming for mercy, declaring she would say anything, do anything.

"Question her carefully according to the interrogation outline," Xue Ziliang instructed through the internal speaking tube, "especially about Hao Yuan's situation!" He glanced at Zhao Yingong. "How about it—do you have anything to add?"

"No. The key right now is finding Hao Yuan. Everything else is empty." Zhao Yingong said wearily. He felt the air in the room was somewhat stifling and suggested they go outside to "have a smoke."

The Special Investigation Team sentries standing guard at the door immediately stood at attention, raised their hands in salute, and were about to call out "Greetings, Chief!" when Qian Shuixie, following behind, waved them off. Seeing the grave expression on Elder Zhao's face, the sentries immediately shut their mouths in disciplined fashion, rendering only a silent salute of attention.

After exiting the little black room, the two walked to a nearby pavilion. Four Special Investigation Team members stood guard wordlessly a dozen meters away, their overt and covert posts layered and distinct. Seeing how well-trained these Special Investigation Team members were, Zhao Yingong silently gave a nod of approval to Xue Weini's troop-training skills. Perhaps it was because the outside air was indeed fresher, but Zhao Yingong's heart felt somewhat more at ease, and his sense of oppression had lessened considerably.

This was a spot deep within Phoenix Mountain Manor, remote and quiet on all sides, and up on the hill—which was why the secret prison had been built here. Zhao Yingong pulled out a pack of "Holy Ship" brand cigarettes, offered one to Qian Shuixie, and the two lit up, standing in the hilltop pavilion and gazing at the bustling night lights of Hangzhou city.

Qian Shuixie took a deep drag on his cigarette and spoke first: "Old Zhao, we weren't close before, but in the few days since I've been in Hangzhou, I originally felt you had some real skill. The operation in Leizhou and the situation in Guangzhou—I think Old Guo and the others may not have done any better than what you've accomplished single-handedly. But these past few days, I get the feeling you've made enemies with someone and are losing your grip? All the hooligans and riffraff in the city have been rounded up to give you trouble. Feels like you're on the defensive everywhere, fumbling around. There's a problem with how you've been running this Hangzhou Station."

What he feared had come. Zhao Yingong nearly broke into a sweat again. If those trash-talkers in Lingao knew how badly things had deteriorated here, wouldn't they riddle him with verbal bullets? And the inspection team was already on its way! Who knew what they would tell the Council of Elders? But on second thought—damn it—at worst he'd be demoted and sent back to push female servants around; what was there to fear? He just felt pained at the loss of this enterprise he had spent countless hours and effort building.

He exhaled the smoke from his lungs in one breath and said with a bitter smile: "Squad Leader Qian, you also know I've been operating solo. Originally I just wanted to create some economic value for our Council. The intelligence war in Hangzhou wasn't that important yet—after all, this isn't the capital. But as soon as I made a few moves in the silk market, I got targeted. Do you think I don't want to have both the white and black paths under control? But this isn't Leizhou or Guangzhou—I can't act with impunity!"

"Heh, I'm not trying to criticize you, brother, but we House Party members saw it clearly early on: you've been brought down by your own love of glory." Qian Shuixie smiled. "Your operation here is already large-scale, and you've been assigned the work of procuring commodities for the trade sector—you've got a dedicated dungeon practically opened for you to farm achievements. But you didn't think that was enough; you insisted on opening your own dungeons. You say you're acting purely for the public good, but people also call it a 'left-deviation adventurist line.'"

"Yes, so I'm not popular..." Zhao Yingong said with vexation. "I've made my share of mistakes, that's true, and sometimes I've overlooked the interests of the Elders. But surely it should be a seventy-thirty split in my favor? Now everyone's treating me like a big tiger, saying the Hangzhou Station's work is worthless, practically ready to brand me a traitor. Is this how we treat revolutionary comrades? I really don't understand." His voice was even trembling as he spoke.

Qian Shuixie smiled as he exhaled a puff of smoke: "Old Zhao, Old Zhao. I spent quite a few years in America after all. How is it that you, who spent so long in China, don't even have this basic understanding? Achievements and successes are only ever attained under the leadership's guidance—they're not personal! Who's our leadership? The Council of Elders! You've been ignoring the Elder community, treating only the few Elders directly connected to you as 'the Elders.' How can that work? If they don't target you, who would they target? Seventy-thirty split? With your level of understanding, the Hangzhou Station is nothing but a great poisonous weed!"

His tone was gentle, but his words were quite sharp: "You think this whole Hangzhou operation is all your personal achievement? You've been wheeling and dealing here, and you've indeed run things well. But you need to know: your roots are in the Council of Elders. Without the Council, you couldn't last one minute here! We must always keep our 'roots' in mind! Your mistake is thinking you're so great, rushing off to do great things—yet you're not great enough to handle everything yourself! Back in the day, Little Guo and the others made the same mistake you did and nearly didn't make it through. The lesson isn't far off."

Zhao Yingong stood there dumbstruck, the cigarette in his hand glowing and dimming. After a long while, he finally exhaled: "Old Qian, you've truly awakened me from my dream!"

"If we're talking about problems, forget about the overseas stations that are completely isolated—even the ministries and commissions in Lingao, the county offices in the various counties, which one doesn't have problems that could be pulled out for criticism?" Qian Shuixie smiled. "Attitude—attitude is what matters most. As long as your attitude toward the Elders is correct, I believe everyone can still see your achievements. Even if some people can't see them, many others still can."

Zhao Yingong nodded silently. For a moment neither spoke, but each completely understood the other's meaning.

The preliminary results of Jia Le's interrogation were disappointing. Jia Le did not know Hao Yuan's specific whereabouts. They had dispersed and gone into hiding separately; all communication was through dedicated couriers. Every few days, Jia Le would receive instructions from Hao Yuan and also collect some information to pass on via courier. But no one knew where the couriers came from or where they went.

However, Jia Le confessed that Hao Yuan should still be nearby, because every time they communicated, a response came back by the next day.

"Continue the rigorous interrogation!" Zhao Yingong was very dissatisfied with this result. "Make her tell everything she knows—nothing may be left out!"

The Office of Sticky Poles and Special Investigation Team personnel analyzed that Hao Yuan should still be within the city. Currently, all of Hangzhou's gates had Office personnel secretly watching them, and the government had put up posters with his sketch for public capture. To avoid the risk of exposure, Hao Yuan would not dare flee the city.

Therefore, the main direction of the search remained within the city. Since he was hiding in the city, there would inevitably be traces and clues. Qian Shuixie suggested Zhao Yingong offer large rewards to entice informants.

"Would that work?"

"I believe so. According to this girl's testimony, this Hao Yuan has quite a thorough operational network and should have quite a few people under him." Qian Shuixie said. "Where there are many people, there are easily traitors."

"I feel Hao Yuan is no simple character..." Zhao Yingong was somewhat dispirited.

"The Political Security General Administration sent me a very long telegram about this matter," Qian Shuixie said, the cigarette in his mouth glowing and dimming. "But even if he really is a genius transmigrator, his subordinates are still from this time-space; their thinking and behavior still carry the inertia of this time-space. Perhaps they're more than capable of dealing with the local yamens, but against us, there will certainly be gaps."

"I hope so." Zhao Yingong was deeply worried. If he could capture Hao Yuan before the inspection team arrived, the pressure on him would be greatly reduced.

Zhuang Haoren's eyes were bright and alert as he squatted on a pleasure-boat wharf by West Lake.

Although the Black Dragon Society had been mobilized several times during the recent crisis, preparing for a major battle, they had never actually engaged. They had only done some intelligence-gathering and peripheral security work, which left Zhuang Haoren—who had always fancied himself a Zhuge Liang—somewhat unsatisfied.

Although he did not know who Hao Yuan was or why Master Zhao wanted him captured at all costs, since it was the patron's request, he, Zhuang Haoren, would spare no effort. After all, ever since he had attached himself to this master, his life had gotten better day by day. Moreover, during this crisis he had witnessed the powerful forces behind Master Zhao—he was now eager to demonstrate his own abilities.

According to the information Zhao Tong had given them, Hao Yuan was still hiding in the city. Given Hao Yuan's shrewdness, the favorite hiding place for such "notorious bandits" would be the pleasure quarters.

Although the pleasure quarters dealt in the lowest of trades, the profits were enormous, and behind them often stood "big gatekeepers." Famous courtesans might have connections reaching all the way to the Provincial Governor's Office. As for retired gentry living at home, or renowned young masters of great families, all had dealings with them; the authorities did not dare provoke them lightly. The pleasure quarters often had close financial ties with the runners and clerks of the yamen—they could handle matters both above and below. It was not uncommon for notorious bandits to use the pleasure quarters as a base and hiding place.
