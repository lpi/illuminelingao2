# Chapter 1445 - Dining Table of Three Women

When she put on her coat and was ready to leave, the duty officer at the morgue called: the corpse transport carriage had arrived and was about to take away the "disposable cadavers." He asked if Corpse No. 1633090107001 should be sent for cremation.

"No, not for now," Su Wan said. "There might be new examinations."

"Understood, Comrade Regional Director."

"Keep it safe. Without my written order, no one is allowed to inspect, let alone transfer or dispose of it. No one, do you understand?"

"Yes, Comrade Regional Director."

The Farm Tea House was Su Wan's favorite dining spot. Although it was a bit far, it had booths and private rooms, offering more privacy. Her good friends in the Army and other colleagues in internal affairs also liked to come here, so she could often find people to share a table and chat with. She had this quirk: she wasn't used to formally inviting people to dinner but liked chance encounters—this seemed to place no burden on either party, and she could leave at any time. So she often traveled tirelessly on that extremely crude small train to the Farm to dine.

Su Wan's diet had always been very simple. Eating in the cafeteria, she usually had rice with several kinds of boiled vegetables, plus a bowl of sauerkraut potato soup without a drop of oil—this was her usual lunch and dinner. Even at banquets, she didn't eat much, still simply eating some simple vegetables.

Her dietary issues had been criticized by Chen Sigen: severe insufficient intake of protein and fat. As a forensic doctor, she was very clear about the consequences of continuing like this in the long run—sooner or later she would croak from malnutrition. The work intensity in Lingao was not comparable to the old time-space. For this reason, she had to improve her diet once a week and go to the Farm Tea House for a good meal.

She had no share in the various limited supply dishes at the Farm—being lazy by nature, she didn't like calling to book in advance, nor did she care about the Tea House's weekly limited menu schedule, so she just ate whatever was available according to the market.

Vegetables and fruits were in open supply at the Tea House, but meat was slightly monotonous. Apart from aquatic products and poultry, mutton was currently the meat that the General Affairs Office could supply relatively fully. Every week, dozens of sheep were transported from Changhua to Lingao under the name of "General Affairs Office Special Use." The best lamb chops, tenderloin, and legs were hot items, so naturally, Su Wan couldn't get them. Fortunately, there were not many lovers of roasted sheep heads among the Elders, so Su Wan could buy one every time she wanted to eat.

The roasted sheep head in the Farm was taught to the cooks here by an Elder with a chef's certificate according to the method in Ningxia. It used rapid fire, with flames leaping more than a foot high from the oven. The sheep head was first boiled until half-cooked, chopped in half with one stroke, and when the cook brushed a layer of sheep fat on it, it sizzled. The whole process was complicated: brushing oil, soy sauce, vinegar, cumin, chili oil, sprinkling fennel powder, pepper powder, sesame seeds, adding chopped green onions, minced cilantro, and minced onions.

Su Wan felt that not to mention eating, even just looking at it made it very tempting, let alone the aroma. Unfortunately, not many people in the Council of Elders knew quality. The pretentious vanilla roasted lamb chops became a hot-selling item instead. Although only a few sheep heads were roasted a day, she could always order one.

"Half a sheep head first, put more cumin and chili." Su Wan said to the waiter, "A large vegetable salad, and add a liter of draft beer."

While waiting for the food with nothing to do, she saw Salina sitting in a booth not far away. She was wearing a black uniform like her own, and beside her was a young woman she didn't know. Judging from her dress and temperament, she should also be an Elder.

Seeing her gaze notice them, Salina smiled and waved to her, signaling her to come over.

"Su, are you okay? Come sit together."

Su Wan nodded, walked to her table, and sat down. The waiter hurriedly moved her cups and plates over and refilled the lemon water.

"Let me introduce you, this is Cheng Yongxin from the Great Library," Salina said. "This is our Chief Forensic Doctor Su Wan."

"Pleasure to meet you, pleasure." The two greeted politely.

In an instant, Su Wan saw a glint in Cheng Yongxin's eyes, seemingly very interested in her.

What is this woman's background? Su Wan was a little curious.

"You don't look very well. Was this trip very tiring? You went to work again today?"

"There's a new case; Bureau Chief Ran insisted I produce a report as soon as possible." Su Wan took a sip of lemon water.

"Too hard. You should indicate that you need a good rest."

"Sigh, Salina, everyone who came to this time-space is working hard. Should I alone say I need rest? Even if I could say it, I would feel uneasy inside." Su Wan put down the cup and sighed to Salina. Probably due to Xue Ziliang's long-term nourishment, Salina looked very good. Her sunset-like blonde hair always had an attractive sheen, her lake-green eyes and alluring figure with curves in all the right places exuded the unique charm of a white woman, and the flush that appeared from time to time on her moon-white face made her look incomparable beautiful.

Looking at Cheng Yongxin beside her again, jeans tightly wrapped around her long legs, wearing a fluttering white long-sleeved shirt on top, sleeves casually rolled up, black silk-like straight hair cascading down her shoulders. Wearing light makeup on her face, she looked very exquisite.

Thinking of her own dry black hair, thin figure, and pale features, Su Wan couldn't help feeling a bit dim.

Could it be that she also needed to find a man to nourish her as soon as possible? Speaking of which, there were quite a few candidates; it seemed she should find someone to break her virginity early...

"The Council of Elders is really a group made up of workaholics." Salina said.

"Isn't this a good thing?" Cheng Yongxin smiled leisurely. "Fortunately work is so busy, consuming the main energy of the men. Otherwise, who knows how many crooked things they would come up with."

"True." Su Wan heard the implication in her words and nodded.

"You are right." Although educated by Sister-in-law Qian, Salina still hadn't shed her original temper. "Sometimes I really feel it's hard to understand their way of thinking." She suddenly excitedly mentioned the auction of white female slaves. Salina said indignantly: "This is the most shameful crime I have personally encountered in my life."

Although the auction of white female slaves had passed for a long time, Salina bringing it up suddenly made Su Wan feel abrupt, but she also had complaints about this matter—wasn't this plainly showing contempt and disregard for female Elders?! Her desire to talk suddenly surged:

"What can be done, Salina? Don't forget what those people came to this time-space for. Whether it's communism, democracy and freedom, or national dignity and national rejuvenation, they are all covers, all bullshit! In the end, they just want to do all kinds of vulgar, sordid, and cruel things that were not allowed or conditional in the old time-space, such as playing with heavy weapons, looting wealth, living a corrupt life impossible in the old time-space. Here, whether 21st-century morality or 17th-century morality, they all have to make way for their cannons. What they think is right is the truth, isn't it?" Su Wan's tone rose considerably. "Sorry, I might be a little agitated."

"Yes, people in this world all have more or less terrible thoughts. If they didn't have the energy to overturn the world, it would be fine. But once they have this ability and are indulged, that is the most terrible thing in the world. This is the downside of democracy." Cheng Yongxin said lightly like a protagonist in a Hollywood blockbuster.

Just then, the waiter served their food. A sizable deer steak sizzled on a heated iron plate, accompanied by golden fried potato strips and a few flowerets of green broccoli.

"Served with mushroom sauce?" Cheng Yongxin said. "Matches the venison well."

"Right, they finally managed to make a sauce other than pepper sauce." Salina's appetite was whetted. "Wu is very capable."

"It's his wife who is very capable." Cheng Yongxin corrected. "Obviously no one remembers who his wife is."

"Yeah." Salina had no intention of asking who Wu's wife was and had already started cutting the venison.

Cheng Yongxin ate a set meal of chicken fried rice noodles, which was not only light in taste but also much smaller in portion.

Eating the venison, Salina said: "You eat too little, Cheng Cheng, darling."

"Most of my work is sedentary; eating less helps health."

The roasted sheep head was served, purplish-black and fragrant.

"God, what is this?"

"Roasted sheep head."

"Sheep head!" Salina said with an exaggerated expression. "This thing, is there anything... um, edible?"

"Everything except the bones is edible, and very delicious." Su Wan said, washing her hands in a small bowl of water. "A delicacy on earth." As she spoke, she dug out the roasted golden sheep eye from the head, smiled, and put it into her mouth. Crunch, she bit down—delicious as expected: crisp and juicy.

Su Wan broke open the sheep head, exposing the brain, and ate it with a small spoon: the sheep brain was soft, tender, and smooth like tofu. Tearing off the sheep skin and tossing it into her mouth, it had a slight burnt taste, becoming more fragrant the more she chewed.

Su Wan called out loudly: "Waiter! Garlic!" After finishing, she gulped down a large mouthful of draft beer, wiped her mouth, and said:

"Really delicious, do you want to try? The sheep cheek meat tastes like the best surf clam!"

Salina shook her head repeatedly, and Cheng Yongxin also smiled and waved her hand: "I don't like eating mutton; the smell is too strong. Besides, the cholesterol in this thing must be very high—unhealthy."

"That's a pity." Su Wan ate heartily by herself, the carrots and onion slices in the salad making crunching chewing sounds.

Salina and Cheng Yongxin couldn't help revealing looks of disgust. Su Wan sneered in her heart. She ate the sheep head on her own, chewing raw garlic clove after clove, drinking cold draft beer. The more she ate, the more she wanted to eat, and she drank a liter of draft beer in one breath.
