# Chapter 1329 - A Visit to Fangcao Di: The Ball Game

Fangcao Di's athletic field was the second largest in Lingao—second only to the stadium the Council had originally built for military reviews and celebrations. However, its facilities were much more rudimentary. There was no grand reviewing stand, nor any proper spectator seating—the reviewing stand and bleachers were simple structures of iron frames and wooden planks. During major sporting events within the school, students had to bring their own benches to the athletic field.

Fangcao Di's athletic field had a very high utilization rate. The two hundred residence groups' physical education classes were scheduled to capacity—eight classes from morning to evening, with never a class period when several classes weren't simultaneously conducting activities on the field. After school hours, lacking artificial lighting, such competitions could only be scheduled in spring and later when daylight hours grew longer.

The rugby the Council had introduced was English-style rugby. It was relatively less confrontational and didn't require complex protective gear—rattan helmets and cotton knee pads were adequate substitutes.

Rugby, being highly confrontational and fast-paced, was quite entertaining to watch. It also embodied a strong team spirit, and its tactical arrangements were more complex. For the Council, which adhered to a "militarist" philosophy, it was an extremely suitable sport. Therefore, beginning in Salt Farm Village, this sport had been popularized. Over the years, a rudimentary competition system had gradually formed among Lingao's naturalized citizens. Various factories, government offices, agricultural communes, and military units all had amateur teams. Fangcao Di Educational Park not only had its own representative team but also hosted age-level school leagues internally.

The game was at one o'clock in the afternoon. Huang Bingkun wanted to watch, and the rest of the delegation—except for Liu Dalin who needed to rest briefly in the afternoon—all expressed interest in seeing the Australian ball game when they heard about it. It would certainly be more interesting than sitting in classrooms listening to incomprehensible lectures.

That local gentry were willing to come observe was something Dong Yizhi welcomed heartily. For anything that could spread influence, the more the merrier.

By now, the delegation was seated on the bleachers beside the athletic field. Since this wasn't an official competition, there were no organized student spectators; with study pressures being heavy, only about a third of the bleachers were occupied, with scattered stragglers distributed around the perimeter.

Because it wasn't a formal match, there was no special VIP section, nor anyone assigned to reception duties. It was only through Transmigrator Dong's personal intervention that the delegation was guided to the front row of bleachers closest to the field.

A group of gentry and scholars in long robes with their hair in topknots sitting on the bleachers created, in Transmigrator Dong's view, a strong sense of incongruity.

Indeed, long robes and topknots don't match the Council. He muttered to himself.

Just as his thoughts were wandering to the queue-order controversy, a student ran over to report that the teams were ready and only waiting for him to declare the start.

Dong Yizhi was not only the match's host but also the referee. In fact, he was also the coach of both teams—since none of the transmigrators had actually played rugby, let alone the English style, they could only read books and then become coaches. Transmigrator Dong, whose only skill was kicking a football around, had managed to take the field based solely on books and a small amount of video material.

After the first kickoff, the Jasmine Pavilion scholars sat on the bleachers staring blankly at the field. Although they couldn't understand what was happening, they roughly grasped that two groups of people were fighting over a ball and then desperately trying to kick it into the goal. This crude "ball game" left the scholars dumbfounded. Those who had read more widely, or who had visited places like Guangzhou, naturally connected this ball game with *cuju*.

Though *cuju* had been most prosperous during the Tang and Song, it was still popular among common people in the Ming dynasty. But by then *cuju* had devolved into a performance art or recreational activity, losing the competitive two-team confrontation of the pre-Song era. Its reputation wasn't particularly good either—the professional *cuju* organization "Yuanshe" was associated with marketplace idlers, mostly serving wealthy households and high-class brothels.

For upstanding young men from "farming and scholarly families" like Huang Bingkun, *cuju* wasn't even worth watching—completely regarded as a vulgar lower-class pastime.

That the Australians also played *cuju* made their first reaction that perhaps there was some basis to the Australians' claim of being "descendants of the Great Song"—otherwise, why would they even include this ball game in schools? Presumably this was a legacy from Emperor Huizong.

However, as the game progressed, the delegation members quickly realized that this "Australian *cuju*" had nothing whatsoever to do with the *cuju* they had seen. Never mind the lack of fancy trick shots—just the back-and-forth contestation, with players coordinating desperately to carry the ball for a touchdown, had something of the feel of military formations.

Though they already knew the pirates would sooner or later "rebel," seeing a group of teenagers playing *cuju* on the field while already radiating a fierce fighting spirit still made the delegation members feel a deep, instinctive anxiety. Most of them weren't worrying about the Great Ming—the Ming court was too distant to feel very real to them. Rather, it was these young students being carefully cultivated by the Australians, radiating an ethos already incompatible with them. If such people someday became officials in a new dynasty and became "scholar-gentry" themselves, how would people like them position themselves? Could they still count as "scholars" in the new dynasty?

Thinking this far, several licentiates were already feeling restless. "Master the literary and martial arts, and sell them to the emperor's house"—this had always been the ultimate purpose of studying for scholars since ancient times. Now this emerging new "emperor's house" that was about to raise a new banner apparently didn't value their "literary and martial arts" at all. Hadn't all their studying been in vain?! Those with quick minds and hankering for wealth and status were already secretly wondering which books one should start with to learn this Australian learning.

Huang Bingkun was concentrating on watching the match. He was gradually getting the hang of it. At first he had thought this merely a contest of brute strength—just seeing who ran faster and was stronger. But gradually he noticed there were subtle tactics of troop deployment involved. Even more remarkable was how the players coordinated when seizing and passing the ball—the precision was exquisite: running forward and back, flanking attacks, supporting moves... all flowing like clouds and water, accomplished in one breath. If these people went to war, they would be first-rate crack troops. Then thinking of those perfectly ordered runs and exercises, Huang Bingkun had a sudden inspiration: could the pirates be ruling their state by military law?

Suddenly he felt someone pat him. Turning his head, he saw it was Director Wang. The Professor's face was twisted with shame and indignation. He said in a low voice: "Truly the decline of public morals! Corrupting people's hearts!"

While Huang Bingkun was still puzzled, he followed the man's gaze and saw, on one section of the bleachers, more than twenty female students divided into two teams, each holding differently colored silk pompoms—red and blue—singing and dancing to the rhythm of the field action. The skirts that originally just covered the knees kept flipping up as they jumped, revealing glimpses of wheat-colored thighs above the knee-high socks.

Led by them, the students watching from the sidelines either shouted cheers or exclaimed in excitement, creating a lively scene. This made the corner of bleachers where the delegation sat seem particularly cold and deserted.

Huang Bingkun had no interest in the female students' "absolute territory"—he felt none of that mattered. What mattered was that the pirates were sparing no effort to engineer the doom of the Great Ming. At this rate, not only would the Ming be finished, but even the eternal unity of the Huaxia civilization might be destroyed at the hands of these fake Song people!

Wang Ci saw he wasn't speaking and was about to say more when suddenly a chant arose from the field—one team announced a substitution.

The one coming on was none other than Huang Ping. This was the first time Huang Bingkun had seen his servant wearing such short-sleeved, short-legged attire. Back at the Huang Family Stockade, servants like Huang Ping who moved about within the residence were absolutely forbidden from wearing such indecorous clothing that exposed arms and legs.

He saw his servant Huang Ping wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a large "Arabic numeral" on both front and back, a rattan helmet on his head, all joints wrapped in thick bandages. Huang Bingkun suddenly noticed that this thin boy who had been at his side had grown taller and stronger. His exposed arms and thighs were covered with solid muscle as he ran and shouted across the field.

Shortly after entering, Huang Ping coordinated with teammates on an offensive play. Though they didn't score a touchdown, the strength and agility he displayed in the attack made Huang Bingkun see him with new eyes. How had he never noticed this youth had such capability? After all, all Huang family servants had to practice martial arts, and Huang Ping was famously "useless"—he couldn't even learn something as simple as the Taizu Long Fist.

"The Australians truly have the ability to turn stone into gold." While still musing, Huang Bingkun suddenly heard Liu Dalin's voice.

"Headmaster, you—"

"I woke up. Heard you were all here watching the match, so I came to join in the fun." Liu Dalin said.

"The sun is strong here. Let's watch from under the awning instead." Huang Bingkun quickly helped Liu Dalin to a shaded canopy to the side. Liu Dalin seemed quite interested in this vigorous sport, occasionally watching the match and chuckling with amusement. Huang Bingkun, however, had lost all desire to continue watching. Suddenly, a burst of cheering pulled Huang Bingkun out of his daze. He saw Huang Ping in the red jersey running quickly across the field with both hands raised high, his face radiating a happiness Huang Bingkun had never seen before. As he tried to make sense of it, Liu Dalin told him:

"That's a score."

"Headmaster?!" Huang Bingkun was quite astonished. The Headmaster had limited mobility and rarely went out, yet he knew so much about the pirates' affairs!

"My steward's grandson studies here. He also loves this rugby game, so I know a thing or two."

Huang Bingkun was about to say something when Huang Ping broke free from the excited teammates who had rushed to embrace him. He ran toward his classmates' bleachers, where a girl stretched out both hands and jumped forward, and the two embraced tightly. This scene instantly left Huang Bingkun dumbstruck, his mind going completely blank. He only felt something collapsing inside his chest. Sunlight flooded the entire field, blazing bright, yet he alone stood in a long stretch of shadow.
