# Chapter 1389 - Canal Gang

The people dispatched by Zhao Yingong inquired for several days in the prefectures and counties where Rice Riots broke out. The information gathered back made Zhao Yingong restless.

Although Hangzhou Station's intelligence personnel had limited capability and couldn't obtain detailed enough intelligence, from studying the intelligence in hand, this Rice Riot was obviously premeditated and organized. Moreover, the other party was experienced, actions skilled, obviously an old hand at this. Besides, judging from many placards they collected, the spearhead of this Rice Riot was obviously directed at himself.

In a famine year, what end one would have being capped with the hat of "hoarding for speculation, seeking exorbitant profits," even a child knew.

Let alone how terrible destructive power common people suffering from both poverty and hunger would have once erupted, just those gentry with wolf and tiger nature could also make a big article out of this, making him suffer.

Not only that, being able to organize such large-scale riots, the forces behind were definitely not ordinary.

Zhao Yingong shut himself in the inner study, drinking pot after pot of strong tea, smoking cigar after cigar. He originally felt the most dangerous were those local Jiangnan gentry. Unexpectedly someone came silently with underhanded moves.

Most terrifying was he hadn't even figured out the other party's background. Who exactly were they? Dealing with him with such a big hand, what were they after?

Various news channels of Hangzhou Station couldn't collect any particularly useful news. The enemy was still hiding in the mist.

He considered again and again, on one hand sending a telegram to External Intelligence Bureau reporting the currently encountered situation, on the other hand ordering strengthened alertness at Phoenix Mountain Villa and Wanbi Bookshop.

"The most urgent thing is to dig out the black hand behind scenes." Zhao Yingong thought, if not dug out, he was in the dark while they were in light, equivalent to one-way transparency, very passive.

Zhao Yingong realized at this time that although the intelligence network deployed by himself and External Intelligence Bureau had considerable breadth, the intelligence they could collect basically belonged to open intelligence. Indeed, right now in entire Jiangnan probably no one was better informed than him. Not only could he get news of various major cities in Jiangnan within three days, but he could also get same-day news of Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Dengzhou-Laizhou etc. But on secret intelligence collection, it was still limited.

Security awareness in ancient society was very weak. Let alone ordinary gentry and wealthy households, even news in government yamens was easily inquired about as long as money was in place. Some so-called military secrets, small path news in the capital was already flying all over the sky before official announcement.

But his painstakingly built intelligence collection network knew absolutely nothing about the black hand behind this Rice Riot. This made him realize the opponent was definitely not an ordinary enemy, must be an organization with considerable secret activity experience. He remembered hearing a bunch of two-legged bookcases from the Great Library talking during training at External Intelligence Bureau that Ming Dynasty secret religions were very flourishing, not only numerous members but also strictly organized.

"Could it be cult elements?" Zhao Yingong muttered to himself. However, collected placards didn't have any doctrinal color of folk religious sects.

If this happened in Lingao or similar locations, the operation efficiency of the Council of Elders' violent apparatus would still be very high. But right now he was in the Ming-ruled area, and the violent apparatus was not in his hands.

The first thing to do now was to investigate clearly who the opponent was. Only knowing who the opponent was could next countermeasures be considered.

One point was beyond doubt: the opponent was pointing the spearhead at him, preparing to further incite larger civil uprisings by constantly instigating folk emotions.

Once a large-scale civil uprising broke out, not only would the foundation he laid in Jiangnan suffer severe damage, but he himself would also be ruined, making it almost impossible to continue activities in Jiangnan.

Countermeasures must be taken as soon as possible. Thinking here, he ordered Zhao Tong to be called to discuss countermeasures.

Although Zhao Tong was a naturalized citizen coming from Qiwei Escort Agency, he was actually an authentic person of the rivers and lakes—he was an escort born of walking dark escorts, equivalent to an "individual household" in the escort business, specializing in escorting priceless treasures. People walking dark escorts all came and went alone, whereabouts uncertain. Not only were their martial arts exquisite, but they were also bold yet cautious people familiar with river and lake tricks.

"This matter, I see secret society people involved." Zhao Tong said after reading these materials once.

"How so?" Zhao Yingong couldn't help but be secretly shocked. Although Zhao Tong handled most of the collection of these materials, many came from other channels, and compiling and summarizing was done by others. He came to a conclusion similar to his own just by looking through roughly once.

"This kind of technique, their kind of secret religious sects are best at." Zhao Tong was concise, "Also Master don't forget, this is Hangzhou."

"What about Hangzhou?"

"Has Master forgotten those temples by Gongchen Bridge?"

"Oh!" Zhao Yingong suddenly realized. How did he forget this! "Luo Sect."

Gongchen Bridge outside Beixin Pass of Hangzhou Prefecture was the starting point of the Grand Canal, always the anchoring place for grain boats of canal transport. It was said during Ming Dynasty, three people named Qian from Miyun, Weng, and Pan from Songjiang lived in Hangzhou, jointly promoting Luo Sect, building a nunnery each at that place, worshipping Buddha statues, eating vegetarian and chanting sutras, hence names of Qian Nunnery, Weng Nunnery, Pan Nunnery.

Because that place was close to where grain boats anchored, canal boat sailors often borrowed residence there. Over time they converted to the sect one after another. The nunneries then became sailors' own property. As more sailors stayed, Luo Sect temples also gradually increased. According to a memorial from Zhejiang Governor Li Wei to Yongzheng in Qing Dynasty: Zhejiang Gang canal transport sailors mostly believed in Luo Sect. At that time although already declining, there were still over thirty temples, and at its most prosperous time before, it claimed to have as many as seventy-two. Sailors saved silver and money every year for supply and support. When returning empty in winter months, they rested inside, not counting room money. For lawsuit fees along the way, there were specialized personnel responsible for care in Huai'an, Tianjin, Tongzhou, and the Capital. Thus a gang of canal transport sailors formed very quickly.

With himself and Shen Tingyang, Fushe planning "abolishing canal for sea," this time Merchants Bureau undertaking north transport of Guan-Ning grain and pay, thinking this way, no wonder people in Canal Gang regarded him as a thorn in the eye. This speculation of Zhao Tong's was very reasonable.

With potential suspects, it was easy to handle. At least knowing what means to use to deal with them.

"This is good." He couldn't help saying.

Zhao Tong looked at Master Zhao surprisedly. If really targeted by Luo Sect and still saying "This is good," was this Chief suffering from madness? Although Zhao Tong knew the Council of Elders' ability, this was Hangzhou under Ming rule, not Guangzhou where Australian gunboats patrolled in Pearl River and could arrive at White Goose Pool anytime.

Since Luo Sect second generation Duan Jinan led disciples to ascend Tiantai Mountain in 4th year of Wanli of Shenzong, propagating doctrine, gathering crowd of three thousand, finally suppressed by local officials, various branches of Luo Sect had always kept low profile. Unlike White Lotus Sect which set off waves of resisting court many times, it was still a folk religious sect that couldn't be ignored in rivers and lakes. Especially this branch believed by canal transport sailors, although its religious color was faintest, its power on both banks of the canal was huge.

"Can you investigate clearly the background?"

"I'll go do it right away." Zhao Tong agreed fully. He was very familiar with people in rivers and lakes; turns and twists could inquire much news.

After Zhao Tong withdrew, Zhao Yingong considered a bit, deciding to give notice to both Shen Tingyang and Fushe regarding this matter: Someone was secretly acting unfavorably to Merchants Bureau.

If Canal Gang was really operating behind this matter, he didn't plan to shoulder it alone—had to drag these two parties into water somehow. However powerful Canal Gang was, it was only a "vigorous social organization," definitely wouldn't openly come out to "fight power." Hangzhou Station's safety could also be preserved temporarily. He would slowly mobilize strength to deal with them.

Taking a step back, if things really got to uncontrollable stage, so that Canal Gang rose in rebellion, it wouldn't be a pity even if Hangzhou Station was completely destroyed. This would be exactly a great opportunity for Council of Elders to directly intervene in Jiangnan, furthering to control North-South shipping routes.

However, the news Zhao Tong brought back a few days later surprised him again: Inside Canal Gang there was absolutely no news of wanting to deal with Zhao Yingong!

Canal Gang was just a sailor gang. Although huge organization, internal structure wasn't very strict. No role like General Gang Leader, nor did it set up incense halls everywhere like folk religious sects. Even religious color itself wasn't strong. Canal Gang was roughly distributed along the canal line; one place was one gang. Although disciples with high seniority in gang were respected in status, it was merely a status. There was no governing relationship between gangs, only cooperation.

Canal Gangs too far from Hangzhou, even knowing Merchants Bureau undertaking grain transport was huge threat to Canal Gang's future, was hard to directly intervene. So it must be gangs in Southern Zhili and Zhejiang taking lead.

If Canal Gang really had moves to deal with Zhao Yingong, with such loose organizational structure, at least middle-level personnel of Hangzhou Canal Gang should have received news by now.

However Zhao Tong ran around for days but gained nothing. Canal Gang up and down were busy repairing ships—in a few months, autumn grain would come on market. Prefecture and county yamens opening granaries to collect grain, grain households paying, canal boats arriving at pier, accepting and loading, named "Receiving Exchange." This was the most important matter of the year for Canal Gang. Not only could "official business" not be delayed, but during "Receiving Exchange," "checking rice color," "customs clearance" were all great opportunities to extort prefectures and counties. Not only gang backbones hosting matters could make fortune, but it was also huge income for whole gang up and down.

Under this state, it was hard to imagine Canal Gang busy creating income would think of coming to deal with Zhao Yingong. Even response to grain and pay being transported north by sea wasn't very big in Canal Gang: First this wasn't regular practice; second, mere 50,000 shi of unpolished rice was like one hair from nine oxen compared to over 2 million shi of tribute grain annually.

Zhao Tong was also confused—he originally had confidence in his deduction, didn't expect facts to be otherwise.
