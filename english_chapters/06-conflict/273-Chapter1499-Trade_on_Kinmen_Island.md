# Chapter 1499 - Trade on Kinmen Island

"Then I regret to inform you, according to Senate orders, trade blockade is currently executed on Xiamen, Kinmen, Anping and surrounding areas of Weitou Bay, prohibiting all trade ships from entering the area. Considering you didn't know this order, no punishment added this time, go to other ports immediately. Otherwise second interception means confiscation of ship and goods." He looked at the navigation permit, "You held navigation permit for quite some days, also no bad record, should know Senate rules."

Liu Deshan had to say yes repeatedly; hope to make a small fortune in Weitou Bay was shattered. But selling salt was incidental matter; doable naturally good, not doable didn't hinder matters.

Patrol ship officer instructed a few more sentences, returned to patrol ship deck. Ship sailors were just about to remove cables when suddenly a gray-uniformed officer came out from cabin, whispered a few sentences in Australian naval officer's ear. That officer nodded, re-boarded *Dongshanju* deck, took them to stern cabin.

"You can go to Weitou Bay to trade." Officer said to suspicious Liu Deshan and Chen Huamin, "However—"

"Little one dare not, little one dare not..." Liu Deshan hurriedly defended, "Dare not violate Senate decree..."

Officer laughed: "Tell you to go then you go, fear what? Just after you go, on return trip need to go to Hong Kong Maritime Trade Bureau to report what you saw and heard."

Liu Deshan's legs went soft; this was wanting him to be a spy! He secretly hated himself shouldn't have coveted small profit, idea of going to Xiamen to sell salt buying foreign goods. If this matter was known to Zheng family, not only ship and goods couldn't be kept, even little life wouldn't be kept—badly handled might implicate cousin and subordinate managers, sailors. That truly was great sin.

He was anxious with head full of sweat, speech also incoherent: "This, this, little one not going... not going..."

"Not going?" Officer said, "Too pity. As long as willing to go, give your navigation permit free extension twelve months or free upgrade to Class A permit."

Currently *Dongshanju* applied for Class B permit, could only sail and trade at various Chinese coastal ports, farthest only to Taiwan, Kaohsiung, Jeju Island. To go to Japan, Ryukyu, Manila etc., must apply for Class A permit, naturally usage fee much higher.

Hearing free upgrade to Class A permit, Liu Deshan instantly got energy, speech also suddenly clear: "Since it is Senate order, little one certainly serve with utmost sincerity, decline not even ten thousand deaths!"

Manager Liu secretly worried beside, how could this spy matter be touched! Just about to speak to stop and decline, but was pulled by Chen Huamin.

Chen Huamin saw two people finished speaking, then asked: "If Zheng family people ask about Australian various deeds..."

"Whatever you see just say whatever, no need to conceal." Officer said.

Watching patrol ship sail away far to south, *Dongshanju* re-hoisted three main sails, continuing to sail north.

Manager Liu complained ceaselessly in cabin: How could such thing be done? Liu Deshan also felt himself slightly rash. Instead Chen Huamin disapproved:

"Zheng family now split apart, whether situation in Weitou Bay can last till next year is unknown. We go do business, don't need to specifically pry into anything, just listen and look. Free upgrade matter small, helping Australians a small favor now, business on sea can be done even more in future."

"That is true, Australians handle matters treat people most honest!" Liu Deshan nodded repeatedly, "Serving Senate, definitely won't suffer loss."

Manager Liu couldn't rest assured, still discussed with Wang Chengti, instructed clerks sailors to strictly keep secret.

*Dongshanju* sailed north for over two *shichen* [4 hours], finally arriving at Weitou Bay.

Chen Huamin stood by ship side, staring blankly at Weitou Bay wordless.

In past ships entering and exiting here were frequent, sail shadows visible everywhere, various ports forest of masts. Now only left a piece of empty sea surface; except few fishing boats still catching fish, sailing long time, surprisingly didn't see a big ship enter or exit. Shore also saw no ships moored.

Wang Chengti asked: "Cap... Captain, where do we drop anchor?"

This stumped Chen Huamin. In past ships engaging in coastal trade all sailed to Zhongzuosuo or Anping. But now situation completely different. He already knew from Australian *Price Current* that Zheng family power in Weitou Bay originally split apart. Anping, Kinmen, Zhongzuosuo etc. each controlled by original Zheng family general relatives. They didn't communicate with each other; although didn't attack each other in crisis, obviously relationship not harmonious either.

Instead Liu Deshan had plan in chest, instructed sailing straight to Kinmen Island—he wanted to do business with Zheng Zhifeng.

Zheng Zhifeng was still biggest power faction of Zheng family, much stronger than Zheng Cai Zheng Lian brothers, even stronger than Zheng Sen. But Zheng Sen had government backing, Zheng Lian Zheng Cai brothers sat on Xiamen Island controlling Jiulong River estuary area, could acquire various goods supplied inland relatively conveniently. By comparison Zheng Zhifeng only controlling Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands had considerable difficulty acquiring goods: various parties in the bay to expand revenue sources, suppress opponents, although didn't mutually blockade trade routes, set up checkpoints on traffic arteries in respective controlled areas, levying likin tax on passing goods sold by own side.

Fujian mountains many land few, roads passable for bulk goods limited. Land traffic stuck by people, Zheng Zhifeng's trade commodity cost was much higher than others.

Since currently own strength limited, outside Australians eyed covetously, fighting each other not good strategy after all, Zheng Zhifeng put main gaze of acquiring goods on coastal trade. For this spared no expense sending people to various places to publicize: willing to attract shipowners engaging in coastal trade to sail to Kinmen with high prices.

As *Dongshanju* got closer and closer to Kinmen, desolate atmosphere in Weitou Bay also became more obvious. Passing small islands used to have human habitation, now all became rubble; houses only left burnt black broken walls, piers almost all burned, leaving only burnt wooden piles standing lonely in rising and falling sea water.

Miserable state of Liaoluo Bay was even more shocking. Here originally was main anchorage of Zheng family fleet; suffered main attack of fleet in Weitou Bay Great Battle. Fire burned 48 hours before extinguishing. Hundreds of large and small ships moored here were all destroyed. Although nearly half a year passed, on water surface still could see countless burnt black twisted ship wreckage sunk on beach.

Several people witnessing scene before eyes, couldn't help feeling awe: This truly was sweeping away dry leaves [crushing defeat].

While lamenting, saw a small boat flying Zheng Zhifeng flag already sailed out from one side of island, coming to pilot berthing. *Dongshanju* lowered most sails, sailed following at low speed, until dropping anchor to park beside newly built wharf.

Could see wharf was completely new built; whether houses or pier were all hasty works. Zheng Zhifeng re-fortified and constructed Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands. Because too many sunken ships in Liaoluo Bay inconvenient to clear, simply abandoned completely.

Wharf had a look of waiting for reconstruction; bricks, tiles, wood piled very high. A row of warehouses being built, workers coming and going, very lively, adding some vitality to this desolate lonely bay.

Only ships in harbor not many, only ten-odd ships moored. Flags flown also mostly not Zheng family flags. Chatting with Zheng family boss coming aboard knew to prevent sudden Australian attack, Zheng Zhifeng subordinate ships mostly moored in sea area north of Greater Kinmen Island; here only let outside merchant ships moor.

"Merchant ships coming are however not many..." Chen Huamin said deliberately.

"Originally came quite a few, recently Kun thieves engaging in sea ban, ten ships entering one is not bad." Boss bitter faced, "You didn't encounter Kun thieves patrol ship?"

"Encounter did encounter, we said going to Shanghai to do business, they let go."

"That counts as luck." Boss said, "You being able to come to Kinmen, can make a small fortune. Just these salt is enough to earn!"

After Australians and Zheng family started war, original salt trade already completely halted. Plus sea blockade starting recently; Southern Fujian region originally was salt deficient region relying on outside import. Thus salt price skyrocketed.

Salt price offered by Zheng Zhifeng was quite good. Liu Deshan stocked Haibei Salt Field salt controlled by Australians, originally cheap "private salt" not paying official tax. Transported here to sell, gross profit actually flipped 400%—although salt unit price very low, earning limited, profit enough to pay this trip's sailing expenses. Business following would all be net profit.

Liu Deshan laughed mouth almost splitting to ear root: This business trip truly worth it! Immediately said a cart of good words. Besides due benefit for boss, as usual wrapped red packets for various relevant figures on wharf: "Scale Master," "Tallyman," "Warehouse Keeper"...

Sold salt, Zheng family boss inspected goods on *Dongshanju* again: but seeing various goods loaded on *Dongshanju*, boss couldn't help showing disappointed look: ship's main cargo was sugar. Fujian originally was sugar producing place; Zheng Zhifeng had large batch of sugar goods in hand, not lacking.

Upon knowing, Liu Deshan immediately proposed willing to purchase Fujian sugar goods here. Boss overjoyed, immediately expressed willing to give a favorable price. Sugar goods on Kinmen Island mainly coarse goods like brown sugar, yellow sugar and black sugar; fine goods like white sugar, rock sugar limited, but price not very cheap. Average price of coarse sugar similar to Australian lowest grade Leizhou white sugar. White sugar rock sugar price much higher, and quality far inferior to Leizhou sugar goods sold by Australians.

But even this price, transporting to Jiangnan still profitable. At worst transporting to Taiwan to sell to Red-haireds could also earn a sum. *Dongshanju* salt already sold empty; using cabin space to carry extra sugar goods was incidental matter.
