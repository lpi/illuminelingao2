# Chapter 1346 – Trade Agreement

Watching the charging game and the warriors on their galloping horses, listening to the thunder of hooves and the shouts of men, Huang Hua found himself swept up in the atmosphere of the battlefield even though the prey were not human. The spectacle of thousands chasing game stirred the blood—a true display of martial power. As he watched, he could not help marveling at the might of the Eight Banners. The Manchu cavalry were splendidly mounted and heavily armored; their ferocity in "combat" was evident even in a hunt. Their horsemanship was superb—they wheeled on a coin during the chase, drawing bows left and right and striking with astonishing accuracy.

Huang Taiji sat high on his steed, flanked by numerous Beiles, ministers, and Bayara guards, pointing and commenting on the hunt. From time to time he even drew his own powerful bow to shoot, bringing down several large beasts to the cheers of the crowd.

Suddenly a massive wild boar burst from a thicket. Panicked by the encirclement, it charged straight toward the Khan's yellow umbrella. The Bayara guards moved at once to intercept; arrows flew like rain. But the beast, bristling with shafts, charged on madly and knocked several guards aside. Before the rest could surround it, the boar broke through the inner cordon and hurtled toward Huang Taiji.

Cries of alarm rose from the crowd. Huang Taiji, however, remained calm, drawing his sword to meet the charge.

"Fire!"

A clear command rang out. *Bang! Bang!* Two gunshots cracked in quick succession. The wild boar, mid-charge, stumbled as if struck by an invisible hammer, crashed to the ground, convulsed several times, and lay still.

Smoke curled from the muzzles of the revolvers held by two of Huang Hua's guards just outside the inner ring. They holstered their weapons with practiced precision, faces expressionless.

The sudden shots had startled many horses—but Huang Taiji's mount was battle-hardened and did not flinch. He stared at the dead boar, then at the guards who had fired. A strange light kindled in his eyes.

"Fine weapons! Fine men!" Huang Taiji called out loudly. "Reward them!"

The small episode proved a more effective demonstration than any words could have been. The power and rapid fire of the revolvers, and the discipline of Huang Hua's guards, left a deep impression on the Manchu nobles.

The following day, negotiations began in earnest with officials from the Board of Revenue.

The location for trade was set at Duozhi Island in the Yalu River, near Zhenjiang Fort. This was a compromise: Later Jin did not want the "Great Australians" penetrating deep into their territory, and Huang Hua needed a site accessible by ship. Duozhi Island was uninhabited and secure enough for both parties.

Trade would occur twice a year, once in spring and once in autumn.

The "Great Australia" side presented a detailed inventory of available goods: salt, sugar, cloth, ironware, tea, medicines—and, of course, the much-coveted armor.

Later Jin offered its own list: primarily furs (sable, fox, and the like), ginseng, pearls, deer antler, and fungus. And, crucially, the agreed-upon "living mouths" and horses.

The toughest negotiation was over pricing.

The Later Jin officials were shrewd bargainers. For armor, Huang Hua quoted sixty taels of silver per standard infantry set and one hundred fifty taels for a refined officer's set. The Later Jin officials tried to slash the prices, arguing that their furs were undervalued.

"Your furs are indeed fine," Huang Hua countered, "but our armor saves lives. Can a piece of sable skin stop an arrow? Can a pearl deflect a blade?"

After rounds of haggling, armor prices were settled at fifty taels for standard sets and one hundred thirty for officer's—still a massive profit margin, given industrial production back in Lingao. Prices for horses and "living mouths" were also pegged to fair market rates, with a slight premium since the Senate was the buyer in need.

Regarding the "living mouths" specifically, Huang Hua insisted on a mix of men and women, young and healthy. Huang Taiji had agreed in principle—viewing it as an opportunity to off-load the old, the weak, or the rebellious—but Huang Hua's specifications ensured they would not simply be dumped with useless mouths. The price was fixed at ten taels per healthy adult male, eight for a female, with adjustments for age and skills.

For basic commodities such as salt and cloth, prices were set slightly below the extortionate black-market rates Later Jin currently paid to Shanxi merchants, making the deal attractive to them while still guaranteeing high profits for the Senate.

One specific item Huang Hua pushed was iron pots. For the Mongols and Manchus, iron pots were strategic goods, heavily restricted by the Ming. The Senate could mass-produce cast-iron pots cheaply. Huang Hua proposed using these, along with tea and salt, to trade for horses from the Mongol tribes under Later Jin's influence. It was a win-win arrangement: Later Jin gained the strategic supplies they needed to placate their Mongol allies, while the Senate obtained horses.

The final agreement was drafted in both Chinese and Manchu. On the surface it was a purely commercial treaty—but its implications were strategic.

Before departing, Huang Hua presented a special gift to Huang Taiji in private: a high-quality, orchestrally tuned music box and a set of exquisite glass mirrors for his harem. Huang Taiji was visibly pleased, promising that so long as trade continued smoothly, "Great Australia" would be the most favored guest of the Great Jin.

With the treaty signed, Huang Hua's mission was accomplished. He looked back at the imposing silhouette of Shenyang—or Shengjing—knowing that he had just opened a door that would alter the history of Northeast Asia. The influence of "Great Australia" had officially landed on the banks of the Yalu.
