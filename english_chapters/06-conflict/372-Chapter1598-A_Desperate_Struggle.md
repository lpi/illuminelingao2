# Chapter 1598 - A Desperate Struggle

Dongfang Ke was looking out the window when suddenly there were three loud bangs from the front of the convoy, followed by the cries of men and the neighing of horses, creating a scene of chaos. Dongfang Ke's heart tightened; that wasn't the sound of gunfire!

"Who goes there! Don't move!" The shout from the point man at the very front of the convoy was very loud, heard by everyone in the Senator's carriage. Everyone's nerves, which had just relaxed slightly, tensed up again.

Then the convoy stopped. The soldiers on the road stood in a semicircle formation, their muzzles raised. The guards on the carriage noticed suspicious figures on the river embankment and opened fire.

Several shotguns fired in crossing patterns. Junior Brother Zhao, who was moving positions preparing to shell the cargo wagon, was swept by the buckshot. He fell from the river embankment and plunged into the river water instantly.

Seeing the convoy stop, Zhuo Yifan and the others immediately deployed their movement techniques, leaping out from their hiding places. Flying knives and darts shot out from their hands respectively. When the hidden weapons hit, the injured horse let out a long neigh, rearing its front hooves high. The coachman and guards swayed east and west, and Wang Qisuo fell from the carriage with a scream. At the same time, Zhuo Yifan took the lead in rushing towards the tightly closed Senator's carriage.

Originally, there were only a few accompanying guards警戒ing the river embankment. When the horses spooked, several people fell off the carriage instantly. Only the guard on the rear cargo carriage fired in time.

Only a loud boom was heard. Zhuo Yifan felt a gust of strong wind blowing past, the *swoosh* of breaking wind passing by, and a pungent smell of gunpowder rushing straight into his nose. Before he could react, he heard a scream from the Junior Brother behind him, who had likely been hit by a lead bullet.

Zhuo Yifan dared not look back, afraid that if he slowed down, he would be targeted by the Hair Thieves' muskets. At this time, the captain of the guards was pale. It turned out that the guards on the carriage had basically emptied their shotguns in the burst of random fire that killed the suspicious figure on the river embankment just now. This kind of shotgun only held two rounds, and at this moment, everyone was busy reloading. He raised his pistol and pulled the trigger repeatedly at Zhuo Yifan, but in his haste and panic, not a single shot hit.

He roared: "Quick, form formation!"

Three or four accompanying guards who reacted quickly had already gathered together. In moments, a forest of bayonets was erected in front of Zhuo Yifan.

Zhuo Yifan knew that this "Spear Formation" was the hardest to break, not to mention he didn't even have a long sword in his hand, only a dagger. Having no choice, he had to discharge the hidden weapons in his hand.

The distance between the two sides was extremely short. As soon as he threw a handful of hidden weapons, several soldiers were immediately wounded. One groaned and collapsed to the ground instantly. The others endured the pain and still didn't retreat a step.

Seeing that the storming attack failed, Zhuo Yifan was unwilling to just flee for his life. At that moment, he steeled his heart, protecting his chest with his left arm while brandishing the short sword in his right hand, prepared to charge through even if his body was pierced by bayonets.

He shouted loudly "Hair Thief, receive your—" The word "death" hadn't left his mouth when he felt a flash of fire from the ground on his left, followed by a *bang*... He fell like a kite in front of the gun formation.

Lying on the ground, Zhuo Yifan felt a pain in his left arm and abdomen as if someone had pierced them with an awl. Several Fake Kun soldiers raised their muskets fitted with bayonets and charged over to stab him.

"My life ends here!" Just as this phrase flashed through his mind, the Junior Brother who had already been shot and fallen leaped up from the ground. He jumped between Yifan and the gun formation, held a stick he picked up from the ground horizontally, roared, and pounced on the gun formation. With a desperate push, he actually pushed the entire gun formation back several steps, single-handedly holding the entire gun formation immobile... In an instant, a Hair Thief soldier circled from the rear left of the gun formation to the right side of his fellow disciple. Taking advantage of the moment when he had no time to look left, the soldier leveled his bayonet and stabbed fiercely into his right ribs, the tip of the blade actually penetrating directly through his left ribs. Immediately afterwards, the Junior Brother's chest was stabbed repeatedly by bayonets thrust from the formation. From behind, Yifan saw three bayonets penetrate directly out of the Junior Brother's back. The Junior Brother seemed unmoved, still struggling to push the gun formation forward... Suddenly, the Junior Brother turned his head, blue veins bulging on his forehead, his two eyes blood-red looking at Yifan, and roared with all his strength: "Senior Brother! Go quickly!" At the same time, fresh blood gushed out of his mouth.

Seeing that the soldiers on the other side of the carriage had already rushed over, and another Junior Brother was already lying dead on the spot, Zhuo Yifan knew that if he didn't leave now, there wouldn't be any chance. Enduring the pain, he rolled and crawled, falling into the river water.

Before entering the water, he looked back. At this time, the Junior Brother had already been picked up by several bayonets, his two feet off the ground...

"Quick, chase!" The captain shouted anxiously. The assassination moment just now was as fast as lightning. Before the soldiers guarding the main road could rush back, Zhuo Yifan had already been dragged and rolled into the Wenlan River. The soldiers who rushed over hastily had to fire randomly at the river surface. Many splashes were kicked up, but no corpse floated up.

"Don't chase anymore!" Senator Dongfang's voice came from the carriage, "Go back to the city!"

Dongfang Ke had been scared out of his wits just now, almost unable to hold the pistol in his hand. Seeing that three assassins were killed and another escaped wounded, only then did he calm down slightly.

Once his emotions stabilized, he started complaining in his heart again: "Has this captain received security training at all? Security, security, it's not about catching assassins, it's about protecting the VIPs! Too unprofessional!"

Zhuo Yifan fell into the river and drifted with the current. He was heavily injured, drifting in and out of consciousness. In his daze, he only felt someone pull him out of the river water, and after that, he became completely unconscious.

He didn't know how long he had been in a coma. Suddenly, a burst of coolness came to his nose. He shuddered and woke up instantly, struggling to sit up.

"Don't move!" A voice whispered in his ear, and then someone pressed down on his body.

The voice was very familiar; it was Sima Qiudao's voice!

"It's you?" Zhuo Yifan was so weak he could hardly speak.

"It's me. Don't talk, don't move, we haven't escaped danger yet." Sima Qiudao almost whispered in his ear, soft as a mosquito's hum.

Zhuo Yifan calmed down slightly and looked around briefly. He saw deep vegetation all around, covered with thick branches and leaves above; they should be in a thicket of grass and trees.

He didn't know where this place was, but he could hear the sound of water flow not far away, presumably still not far from the Wenlan River.

Before his thoughts settled, he suddenly heard human voices and footsteps coming from not far away. The noise went from far to near. Gradually, even the speaking voices could be heard clearly: it was the Hair Thieves searching!

"Poke more with bayonets in places with deep grass and trees!" Someone was ordering.

His heart instantly leaped to his throat. Although the grass and trees here were deep, if the Hair Thieves conducted a dragnet search, it would be absolutely impossible to escape. Looking at Sima Qiudao again, he also had a solemn look on his face, tightly gripping a short sword in his hand.

From the gaps in the vegetation, he could roughly see several black-clothed police wandering nearby, stabbing fiercely into the bushes with bayonets from time to time. Just as they were at their wits' end, they suddenly heard a woman's voice from afar: "Come over quickly! There's a suspicious spot here!" several black-clothed police who had already approached the bushes immediately put away their bird guns and ran over there. Listening to the noisy human voices fading away, Zhuo Yifan let out a long sigh of relief.

Sima Qiudao also put down the short sword in his hand and breathed a sigh of relief.

"Brother Sima, why are you here?"

"It's a long story." Sima Qiudao said, "I was originally by the river preparing to support the brothers hijacking the boat, but unexpectedly we fell short at the last moment! Later I saw you drifting down from upstream. That was close! If I had seen you a moment later, you would have been discovered by the Hair Thieves! Yifan, your injuries are not light!"

Sima Qiudao spoke vaguely. His attempt to participate in hijacking the *Xiaocang* by the river failed. He originally wanted to leave East Gate Market immediately, but unexpectedly the Rising Promotion Cannon went off, followed by heavy gunfire. He knew that the Hair Thieves would definitely search the whole city now, and running around blindly would likely expose him, so he simply found a place by the river to hide.

Under severe injury, Zhuo Yifan simply didn't have the energy to think much. After being reminded, he realized his injuries were serious: he had been hit by the Hair Thieves' bird gun during the assassination attempt. Opening his clothes to look, his left ribs, hip, and thigh were wrapped in strips of cloth, and blood had dyed his clothes and pants red.

"The Hair Thieves' bird gun is very vicious. Just one shot, and there are several wounds on the body! I have already removed a few pellets for you and applied medicine, only there are still a few lead bullets not removed..." Sima Qiudao knew a little medicine and had served in the army. He knew that lead bullets must be removed in time if hit, otherwise after a long time, the wound would turn blue and black, and then even an immortal couldn't save him.

Zhuo Yifan knew that this was obviously not the place to continue removing pellets, so he said: "I'm fine. We'll leave here as soon as it gets dark!" He felt that his body didn't hurt much, just weak, and asked, "Did your ambush on the small boat on the river succeed?"

Ambushing the *Xiaocang* was not in the original plan. Until the day before the action, Seventh Master sent this news, along with the marching route of the band and the size of the convoy. Sima Qiudao and Zhuo Yifan discussed and concluded that there were only a few girls on the small boat, and the possibility of success in one blow was much greater than for Zhuo Yifan and the others in front of the gymnasium. So they temporarily decided to divide their forces. Sima Qiudao led one group to ambush the *Xiaocang*, which they were more confident about, while Zhuo Yifan bravely shouldered the heavy burden and still went to the gymnasium.

Sima Qiudao looked bitter: "Miserable beyond words."

Immediately, he recounted how his side laid a trap, how they lured the other side to shore, how they attacked the enemy, how fierce the firearms of a young girl on the opponent's boat were, and how his side suffered heavy casualties and was almost completely wiped out.

"Sigh, I didn't expect the Hair Thieves' firearms to be so sharp, all firing continuously. It was simply impossible to take advantage!" Sima Qiudao said annoyedly.

"The Hair Thieves' precautions were extremely strict. Losing so many heroes from famous and upright sects this time is really heart-wrenching. I don't know how the people outside are doing." Thinking that the mission was almost a total failure this time, Zhuo Yifan burned with anxiety. Knowing that the others were likely doomed, he couldn't help but mention it.

"Yifan, things have come to this. You and I are powerless to fight again. In my opinion, we should leave this place quickly while it is still chaotic and there is still a glimmer of hope. Otherwise, once the whole city is searched, none of us will be able to get away."

"That's the only way, Brother Sima. It's just that the others..." Zhuo Yifan took a breath, "I just feel there is something strange about this matter."
