# Chapter 1432 - Scavenging

His hard work on this trip would not be in vain. At the very least, dismantling the iron ribs of the wreckage and taking them back would be valuable to him—this was all malleable iron, which would save him a great deal of manpower and resources in metallurgy.

However, he soon received a gift more precious than iron. The pearl divers he hired soon discovered an "surprisingly large cannon" on the reef more than two meters underwater. Evaristo Okamoto went down into the water himself. Through the clear blue seawater, he discovered it was a Dahlgren gun.

This was one of the two main guns of the *Nongchao*. One had been dismantled from the ship by the Navy rescue team using winches, but this one could not be salvaged because it had sunk deep into the reef. This typhoon had pushed it from the depths of the reef onto the shoal. The storm had destroyed its carriage, but the entire gun body was intact; marine organisms had not even had time to cover the whole barrel.

Hale immediately ordered the salvage of this cannon. With the help of blocks and the reef, hundreds of coolies toiled for three full days and finally hauled the Dahlgren gun from the reef onto the shore.

Evaristo Okamoto, feeling as if he had found a treasure, immediately measured the cannon. He soon discovered that the gun was not manufactured according to the English system. Although he had no metric measuring tools on him, it was easy to deduce that the caliber of this gun was 130mm.

"For a Dahlgren gun, this caliber is a bit small." This was Evaristo Okamoto's first assessment of the cannon.

With the technical and artisanal power he currently commanded, he could not yet manufacture such a powerful muzzle-loading rifled gun. But this cannon could serve as an important weapon for the defense of Manila. In addition, it provided him with a reference sample for his next step: experimentally manufacturing this type of cannon.

Soon he received a second, better gift: a small cannon. He had already seen the small naval guns cast by the Australians on the *H.H. 64*, which were still traditional smoothbore guns. But this gun was completely different; it was a 75mm caliber Dahlgren gun.

This was the first time Hale had seen such a small-caliber Dahlgren gun. Dahlgren guns were rarely made in small or medium calibers. In the mid-to-late 19th century when this type of artillery was popular, it basically served in the role of coastal artillery and fortress guns. Look at the many coastal forts in the United States: most Dahlgren guns had calibers above 200mm, and 406mm caliber Dahlgren guns were not rare.

These Chinese actually manufactured 75mm Dahlgren guns! This was truly beyond Evaristo Okamoto's imagination. Except for their unwillingness to waste resources making their warships overpowerful, Hale could find no other reason.

"Load the two cannons onto the ship immediately and transport them back to Manila. Give them to Marcos," he ordered. "Tell him I want them restored to optimal condition very quickly!"

"Yes, master."

"Reward the pearl diver who found the cannon twenty pesos!" Hale instructed. "One peso for everyone who participated in hauling the cannon! Report any new discoveries to me immediately!"

Under material stimulation, the coolies, who had been struggling in the seawater under the baking sun, mustered up their enthusiasm. They salvaged more things. First, they fished out several shells, then gunpowder kegs containing propellant charges. These things were of course of little value, but he still did not stint on the rewards.

And so a steady stream of all sorts of scrap was salvaged: several damaged naval pattern short-barreled Minié rifles, a 12-gauge shotgun, more shells, and a small amount of propellant. Then came the wreckage of the boiler and steam engine. These things had been smashed to bits in the storm and explosion; many parts were already missing. However, Evaristo Okamoto still carefully directed the coolies to lay out the wreckage roughly on the beach for his detailed study.

Neither the boiler nor the engine could be reused. Black was very clear about this. The opponent was an old hand; the destruction of the *Nongchao* was thorough. But from observing these wrecks, he could still deduce what kind of industrial capability his opponents likely possessed.

Through intelligence gathered in the past and the analysis of this wreckage, these Chinese who came from the same time-space as himself could not yet manufacture iron-hulled ships. All their ships, including warships, were wooden-hulled. Obviously, they did not believe anyone in this time-space had the firepower to threaten their ships. This was consistent with their thinking in equipping their main warships with small- and medium-caliber Dahlgren guns—"just enough will do."

He silently browsed these highest crystallizations of "Australian" industry, the shock in his heart unparalleled. Knowing what they had was one thing; seeing it with his own eyes was another.

"The gap is too big!" He thought secretly. What he saw today fully confirmed all the intelligence collected so far. The Chinese on Hainan Island had an astonishingly large advantage in industrial system strength.

By comparison, the little situation he had painstakingly created in Manila was truly vulnerable before them.

If these Chinese decided to intervene in Manila by force, everything he had done in the Philippines so far would be wiped out. Evaristo Okamoto worried secretly. Fortunately, God had sent him this cannon, giving him a little more leverage. Now he had to upgrade Manila's defense level as quickly as possible at all costs. Work on the new large-caliber rifled cannons had to start as soon as possible, and the progress of naval mines and spar torpedo boats had to be accelerated.

The scavenging operation on the *Nongchao* continued. Although there was no possibility of repairing or utilizing the boiler and steam engine, this pile of scrap copper and iron was still loaded onto the ship and transported back to Manila. Then parts of the anchor chain and windlass wreckage salvaged from underwater, including the iron ship ribs, were all dismantled. Evaristo Okamoto did not even let go of the copper sheathing remaining on the ship's bottom, organizing coolies to strip it all off bit by bit.

"The dam on the lower reaches of the San Juan River has been completed. The accumulated hydraulic power can be used to drive multiple sets of water wheels, each set including two to four water wheels of different sizes. I observed that all the water wheels are installed with drive gear sets, making the power they transmit to the factory machinery smooth and efficient..."

Even the local Spaniards in Manila were surprised by the colonial government's vigorous and efficient work efficiency, because delay and laziness were its normal style. A recent explosion accident in the newly built gunpowder factory burned down the wooden sheds serving as workshops, but in less than half a month, they brought in new timber and repaired the damaged buildings. Even under the Governor's strict orders, workers resumed production before the workshop repair work was completely finished. At present, this military-industrial complex has recruited no fewer than a thousand Chinese workers and thousands of Tagalog coolies. The person in charge of the Royal Shipyard complained publicly that the new munitions factory attracted too many Chinese artisans, leaving him without enough hands to complete the Royal Colony's orders. Therefore, the Manila authorities decided to further expand the recruitment of Chinese artisans. Special personnel have been sent to Macao for this purpose. Chinese working in the military-industrial complex can get double the salary of odd jobs in Manila and the Parian, and artisans with specialized skills get even more, but they can only receive it after reaching the service period stipulated in the contract. And they are concentrated in camps attached to several specially built factories, their every move under strict surveillance and control, almost like prisoners...

"Fort San Antonio has added a large-caliber cannon similar in appearance to a Dahlgren gun. The cannon was transported by ship. The specific origin of this gun and whether it really has rifling are unclear. However, the Spanish guard the Dahlgren gun heavily, strictly forbidding anyone to approach. It is said that a brand-new gun emplacement is being built for this cannon inside the fortress, and the carriage is also a completely new design.

"Droideka's whereabouts and specific address are still unknown. According to colonial officers and priests who have had close contact with him, he sometimes lives in the church, but more often hides in a cave outside Manila for retreat or lives in a hut in a valley within his own territory—it is said that he built a hermitage for himself in the valley. But I personally believe he mainly operates within the newly built munitions factory outside Manila. It is heavily guarded there; outsiders cannot enter without the Governor's warrant. The guards have orders to shoot directly at anyone attempting to enter the factory area without permission.

"Undoubtedly, he does this to avoid interference in weapon design and testing by stupid and meddlesome Catholic priests. I believe it is necessary to take some proactive actions appropriately at present. If Droideka limits his whereabouts to Manila city or the munitions factory because he senses some threat, it will actually be advantageous to us..."

Jiang Shan put down the thick stack of translated telegrams and pressed his temples. Vince Lando's reports were always long, eloquent essays that kept the decoding room busy for half a day—fortunately, he could read English directly, otherwise this thing would be as slow as a declaration of war from the Japanese embassy. He's writing reports like novels, Jiang Shan thought. It's a pity this guy didn't become a reporter or write 007 stories.

It was already the latter half of the night. Only the movements of the night duty staff could be heard in the office building, and the crackling of typing came from the secretariat from time to time. Jiang Shan packed up the documents, locked them in the safe, locked the door, and then went to the dormitory downstairs for a simple shower. Work, work, and more work. He hadn't been back to his apartment for several days, only asking his domestic secretary to deliver meals and change of clothes to the gate. If he hadn't persisted in running five kilometers or swimming fifteen hundred meters in the sea every day, he probably wouldn't have been able to sustain this continuous work schedule.
