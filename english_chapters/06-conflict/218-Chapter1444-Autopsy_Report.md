# Chapter 1444 - Autopsy Report

The master sipped her kvass but laughed out loud herself.

"Although I don't know what she looks like, just this refusal to accept her fate makes me feel she must be more beautiful than Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao—a woman who can still hold her head high after being sold by her elder brother to a wretched old man must be dazzling."

Seeing Sun Shangxiang's entranced, sparkling big eyes, the female Chief reached out and patted her head.

"Never mind, it counts as those guys recognizing quality for once... Let's call you Sun Shangxiang; it's a good name."

The female Chief smiled.

"By the way, remember my name, I'm Cheng Yongxin; from now on, you will serve me temporarily."

Sun Shangxiang was stunned for a moment.

"Temporarily? Chief, are you not satisfied with Shangxiang?"

Cheng Yongxin shook her head.

"No, once I figure out the life secretary system, I will transfer you out of that establishment. With male Chiefs, it's one thing, but I'm a woman. If I get married and you're still my life secretary, are you supposed to be part of my dowry? I couldn't stand that."

Seeing Sun Shangxiang's face turn pale immediately, Cheng Yongxin realized what misunderstanding had occurred.

"Don't think nonsense, I'm not some vicious first wife—you are the same age as my youngest cousin."

She rubbed Sun Shangxiang's hair and said seriously:

"I can't control what those men think, but I won't let a smart, good girl become a plaything serving others with beauty. I promise, I will wait until you find a good young man, and let you marry him wearing a red skirt."

—Niuniu, don't be like Mother.

Sun Shangxiang clutched the kvass in her hand tightly, tears mixing with the cold condensation on the glass bottle, nodding like pounding garlic.

Su Wan walked quickly down the brick steps to the underground dissection room with a gloomy face, her heels clicking. Her face looked so bad because the terrible experience brought by the turbulent sea had not completely ended.

Returning to Lingao from Kaohsiung was not easy; the journey was, as usual, another painful torture—she had been carried off the cargo ship to her dormitory.

After barely feeling that she had "come back to life," she decided to rest well and entertain her body and mind. For this reason, she even chatted on the Little Smart phone for an hour with a certain someone from the Young Officers Club.

Although she knew the morgue in the basement of the Forensic Center must be full of various corpses waiting for her to make autopsy reports, there was nothing urgent. Doing it a day earlier or later wouldn't make much difference.

However, her vacation plan was ruthlessly interrupted by a phone call from the Police Headquarters. The caller was the police chief Ran Yao—Ran Yao rarely called her directly; their work was usually passed through secretaries, messengers, and official documents.

On the phone, Ran Yao asked her to make a forensic identification immediately on a corpse in the morgue of the Forensic Center.

According to Su Wan's initial thought, cases like falling from a building, which were very likely accidents, could be put aside for a while, but the phone call urged very urgently. Su Wan realized the situation only when she received the case report sent by the messenger: the accident actually happened in the Elder residential area!

The deceased was a "life secretary" still in school, and died within the Elder residential area. No wonder Ran Yao was anxious for a precise forensic report.

The Forensic Center of the Police Headquarters had its own dissection room and attached morgue—a portion of the large number of unnatural deaths within Lingao County would be sent here for autopsy. Due to the abundant sources, the cadavers and specimens used by the Ministry of Health for teaching and scientific research were currently provided by this place.

When stepping into the iron gate, she smoothly took the woolen overcoat from the coat rack by the door and draped it over herself—although Lingao during the Little Ice Age also had cold times, only here made people shiver as soon as they entered all year round. However, for Su Wan, who came from Gansu and often endured the "test" of the northwest wind, this was just a piece of cake or even a common meal.

"Teacher Su, you're here." As soon as Su Wan entered, several young men and women wearing the same uniform hurriedly gathered around. They were all Su Wan's students.

After changing into a light blue dissection suit with the students, Su Wan asked a taller boy beside her: "Mm, the body has arrived, right? Also, repeat the case details again. Let me see how you guys handle the scene independently for the first time if Officer Mu and I don't lead the team."

The boy took a document from the side and read aloud:

"At about 7:00 am on September 1, 1633, Lin Xiaoya, a student of the Maid School, was found dead after falling from the roof of the Comprehensive Service Building in the Bairen City Elder Residential Area. After receiving the alarm, the forensic doctor arrived at the scene at about 8:30. The body was located about 10 meters to the right of the main gate of the Comprehensive Service Building, wearing a black dress, white apron, white cotton socks, and black cloth shoes below. The body was in a supine position... The time of death was estimated to be between 1:00 am and 3:00 am on September 1 based on body temperature. After preliminary on-site inspection, it was transported to the Police Headquarters Forensic Center at 10:17 waiting for autopsy."

"Not bad, better than your teacher's first time at a scene. Keep up the good work." Su Wan nodded appreciatively. "Alright, start the autopsy now. Although you've seen enough disgusting pictures in the books issued to you and become immune, actually operating an autopsy counts as the first time. Mm, this corpse is not disgusting. Don't run away scared when you see highly decomposed ones or dismemberment cases later." After saying that, she turned and walked to the dissection table.

Lying on the dissection table was the corpse of a young woman. In Su Wan's view, she was probably only fifteen or sixteen years old. She was of medium build, and her body shape was considered basically qualified by old time-space standards.

"Sigh, poor little sister. Don't know how much you suffered before being sent to the Maid School. Although it was to be a sex slave for that bunch of bastards, at least you would have no worries about food and clothing. But now you left just like this. Hope you can feel a bit better over there and suffer no more." For some reason, Su Wan, who originally had an indifferent attitude towards this case, suddenly felt a strong surge of sympathy in her heart.

Su Wan grabbed the corpse's arms and legs and turned them a few times. "Mm, rigor mortis has already eased." She turned the body over again, pressed the livor mortis with her fingers, and after some other external examinations, she skillfully picked up the scalpel from the tray beside her. Slowly cutting down from the upper edge of the neck, separating the skin of the chest and abdomen like a boat cutting through water, then the tip of the knife went around the left side of the navel and continued downward until the upper edge of the pubic symphysis.

A male student used a large scalpel to separate the muscles and skin of the chest and abdomen to both sides bit by bit, exposing the ribs.

"See that? Her sternum and ribs show large areas of hemorrhage, and there are scattered bleeding points elsewhere." Su Wan pointed at the exposed chest with a small stick in her hand, then pressed the sternum and ribs with her finger. "Fractures of the sternum and ribs are very obvious. You separate the sternum."

The tall boy who was called rubbed his hands and cut open the sternum one by one with heavy scissors. "Teacher, there is a large area of hemorrhage under her sternum, the size is... 6 by 15 centimeters... there is also a hematoma in the retroperitoneum..."

"Very good." Su Wan tried to maintain a calm demeanor in front of her students, even though she was just an immature junior forensic doctor in the old time-space who would vomit from the smell of corpses. "Separate the organs."

After the male student clumsily removed the internal organs from the body cavity with the help of two other female students, Su Wan bent down and brought her face close to the empty abdominal cavity. "Mm, quite a lot of accumulated blood, at least... 200 milliliters. The thoracic and lumbar vertebrae are severely fractured..."

After checking the thoracic and abdominal cavities, Su Wan moved to the head. She made a coronal incision on the scalp and then flipped it open to the front and back. A large area of hemorrhage was seen under the scalp. Sawing open the skull, she found the brain was a mess of bleeding. After removing the brain, she drew out a lot of accumulated blood from the base of her skull.

"Alright, the conclusion is obvious. Lin Xiaoya died of traumatic hemorrhagic shock caused by falling from a height. Stitch her up." Su Wan took off her gloves and said to the students, feeling somewhat relieved.

After stitching was completed, several students left the dissection room to busy themselves with their own tasks, while Su Wan lovingly cleaned and organized the remains and appearance of this poor girl named Lin Xiaoya. Originally, she was an orphan with no one to rely on taken in from the mainland. Naturalized citizens like this who died in various accidents without family members were sent directly to the charity cemetery under the jurisdiction of the civil affairs department for cremation and burial. Such "surplus" body care would basically not exist, but Su Wan was very stubborn today in meticulously organizing her remains, just like in the old time-space.

Su Wan washed her hands, changed clothes, instructed the students and the duty officer with a few words, and returned to her office to fill out the standard autopsy report. She had just returned from Kaohsiung yesterday—although the purpose of going to Kaohsiung was mainly to dissect Hao Yuan's corpse, obviously she couldn't come back immediately after going. She inevitably had to do some teaching and training of key personnel. Giving anatomy lessons to the medical officers in Kaohsiung became one of her main jobs there.

Day after day of repetitive labor was inevitably boring. Kaohsiung was small and had no scenic spots to speak of. Although Dr. Zhong, his daughter, and that Dutch lady were very interesting, and she used to go to Dr. Zhong's studio in the customs building often, the three of them were obviously a tight little circle. When they fiddled with various parts and discussed problems in the studio, Su Wan felt like an outsider with no meaning of existence.

She wasn't as knowledgeable as Zhong Lishi, nor as eager to learn as the two girls, so gradually she went to the Customs Building less often.

"Miss Creetia is really a beauty; her skull is so standard." Su Wan couldn't help imagining—her skull was a typical long oval shape...

She fluently signed her name at the end of the autopsy report with a dip pen. This repeatedly urged matter was considered settled. As for this case, let Mu Min and Ran Yao worry about it. She was going to the Farm Tea House to have a meal and relax properly.
