# Chapter 1274: First Fertilizer Plant

"What Master says is true."

"You go back and prepare first. I might arrive a bit late tonight. Reserve the Jasmine Room first, I need to talk business with someone."

"I understand." Chuqing nodded.

"Chief, let me support you!" Fu Bu'er, red-faced, hurriedly turned around after getting off the train to support Wan Lihuang, who was somewhat drunk.

"I'm fine, I... I can still manage!" Wan Lihuang waved his hand, but couldn't lift his drooping head no matter what. At noon, several overly excited landlords scrambled to toast him. The wine was the easy-to-drink fruit wine, so he inevitably drank a few too many cups. Now he was more than just a little dizzy.

Wu Nanhai, walking behind, was secretly displeased. Although Wan Lihuang was a young lad, he was a Senator after all, a "Chief". Moreover, today was a workday. Drinking himself into a stupor at noon was really unsightly. Especially since many Senators from other departments were attending today's ceremony, it would look bad for people from the Agricultural Committee to be drunk at noon.

He whispered instructions to the accompanying secretary to quickly send Wan Lihuang to the station house to rest, and that he should not attend today's opening ceremony.

Behind them stood the sign for Ma'niao Industrial Zone Station. But this group of people, whose brains were still not quite clear from drinking too much strong liquor at noon, looked at the scenery before them which was vastly different from the Ma'niao in their memory, and couldn't match the two at all. They immediately became excited.

In the center of the straight cinder-hardened road, four steel rails pierced straight into the sea. On both sides were patches of regular open space, demarcated with lime. Far away by the shore, several huge box-like buildings stood tall. A chimney shaped like a thick gourd towered into the clouds, spewing billowing thick smoke. The roar of steam engines rose and fell continuously.

"That is said to be the Chiefs' iron factory!"

"I've heard of it too. The big furnace inside can produce hundreds of thousands of catties of iron at a time!"

"Really? No wonder they say the Chiefs have supernatural powers!"

Immediately, the group of people discussed animatedly in high spirits, as if they also shared in the glory.

This group of people standing at the end of the road, gazing at the miracle of modern industry with high spirits, consisted mostly of active members of the Tiandihui, aside from some agricultural Senators and naturalized agricultural technicians. There were new landlords with experience in large-scale intensive land management, as well as middle and rich peasants who ran side businesses impressively.

This autumn harvest in Lingao was quite fruitful. Tiandihui held an appreciation banquet. Ye Yuming had treated them at the Commercial Hall Restaurant at noon, and then invited them all here, saying that a major project was officially starting today and inviting everyone to take a look.

Although this group of people had heard of the Ma'niao Industrial Zone, ordinary people were usually not allowed to enter the station behind them. Only those working in the Ma'niao Industrial Zone could freely enter and exit here.

The distant blast furnace was truly eye-catching. In comparison, the newly built houses under the slope beside them were not so impressive. They had seen plenty of those thin chimneys over ten meters high in Bairen City.

Boom! ... Boom! ... Boom! ...

Sudden loud noises rang out, interrupting everyone's excitement and scaring a few landlords who had drunk too much at noon almost to the ground.

"Hehe, don't worry everyone, don't worry. That's the forging hammer of the steel plant starting up, it's nothing." Wu Nanhai smiled and waved his hand, leading the way towards a row of bamboo fences with several Senators. Several naturalized citizens responsible for reception quickly led everyone to follow.

Today was the opening day of the Lingao First Fertilizer Plant. After three months of infrastructure construction and one month of installation and commissioning, this largest chemical project in this spacetime, and also the Senators' first purely civilian chemical project, was about to officially start operations.

As immigrants to Lingao increased daily, although the trade department had been working hard to import grain from off-island and expand grain reserves, and the market grain price was still normal, using imported grain was very uneconomical. It not only consumed a large amount of funds but also took up a huge amount of shipping capacity. Lingao's maritime transport capacity had always been in an extremely tight state.

Therefore, tapping the internal potential of agriculture was put on the agenda. In the 43rd year of Wanli (1615), the official fish-scale registers of Hainan showed 3.835 million mu of fields. After a comprehensive measurement of land in the northern Qiongzhou region, the hidden fields in the northern Qiongzhou region were roughly clarified. Added to the southern Qiongzhou region which had not yet been fully measured, there were at least 6 million mu of developed paddy and dry fields in the whole of Hainan. If the average yield per mu increased by 10 kilograms, that would be 60,000 tons of grain, enough to feed 200,000 people. Even calculated based on the hundreds of thousands of mu directly controlled by the Agricultural Committee, the increased production would not be a small figure.

New agricultural machinery, new seeds, new water conservancy, and new agricultural technologies were being gradually promoted, but chemical fertilizer was undoubtedly the most direct and effective technical means. The previous small-scale projects were naturally not enough.

Therefore, as the general person in charge of this agricultural production increase plan, Wu Nanhai, with the enthusiastic cooperation of Luo Duo and others in the Great Library, and after repeated consultations with the Planning Commission and the chemical industry sector, came up with this truly modern fertilizer plant plan: the first phase project was 10,000 tons of superphosphate and a supporting sulfuric acid plant expansion project of 4,000 tons.

Calculated based on a dosage of 30 kilograms per mu for growing grain, the 6 million mu in whole Hainan would require a total of 180,000 tons. This 10,000 tons of output was naturally just a small trial.

The Planning Commission and the chemical industry sector were quite supportive of the fertilizer project, but they originally leaned towards expanding the production capacity of synthetic ammonia or ammonium bicarbonate nitrogen fertilizer. Besides being used in agriculture, it also had great value in chemical industry and military explosives.

The chemical industry sector had already expanded the synthetic ammonia production capacity to 2,000 tons per year by copying and improving equipment on the original 800-ton synthetic ammonia project.

However, the shortcomings in Lingao's equipment manufacturing and materials made further expansion of synthetic ammonia industrial capacity a difficult goal to achieve. Synthetic ammonia industry involved various alloy steels, and these materials were currently difficult to supply stably—both in quantity and quality. In particular, a considerable part of alloy steel involved the mining and smelting of nickel and chromium ores. The small amount of alloy steel, special steel, and non-ferrous metals they currently used, apart from a few types that could be produced in-house, basically came from the inventory brought by the Holy Ship at the beginning. This part of the inventory was very limited, and its use had to be very cautious.

The Planning Commission held multiple discussions with the main technical Senators of the machinery and chemical industry sectors, and finally concluded that launching a larger-scale synthetic ammonia project was not supportable by Lingao's current industrial system and supply chain.

In the end, the Planning Commission confirmed the technological route proposed by the Agricultural Committee of "promoting nitrogen with phosphorus", starting with a phosphate fertilizer plant.

Phosphate fertilizer was the earliest industrially applied fertilizer in history. Phosphorus is an important soil element. Phosphate fertilizer not only has a yield-increasing effect on ordinary grass forage but also has a very good yield-increasing effect on leguminous forage crops such as milk vetch. Planting leguminous green manure in winter increases soil organic matter and fertility—leguminous crops have nitrogen-fixing effects, functioning as a natural application of nitrogen fertilizer. This is the so-called "promoting nitrogen with phosphorus".

Leguminous crops could not only be used to extract oil but more widely used as fodder. The Senate attached great importance to the livestock breeding industry and needed huge amounts of fodder. Extensively planting leguminous green manure in winter was a matter of killing multiple birds with one stone.

Fields in southern China generally lacked phosphorus. Lingao was no exception. To increase phosphate fertilizer, the Agricultural Committee, in addition to applying phosphorus-containing slag, also largely utilized leftovers from processed seafood. But these fertilizers were just a drop in the bucket for the vast fields, far from enough. As for the guano mined from Pratas Island, applying it directly to the fields took effect very slowly and could only be used as base fertilizer.

The phosphate fertilizer production line of Lingao First Fertilizer Plant used guano as raw material, treated with sulfuric acid to obtain ordinary superphosphate, the main active ingredient of which is Ca(H2PO4)2. Superphosphate is a quick-acting phosphate fertilizer, convenient to use, and can be applied in conjunction with modern agricultural techniques. Once the phosphate fertilizer plant went into production, the yield increase effect would be immediate.

According to modern fertilizer technical materials, calculated at a 25% utilization rate, every kilogram of phosphate fertilizer could increase grain production by 4-8 kilograms. This 10,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer would be equivalent to increasing grain production by 40,000 to 80,000 tons. And this only required occupying a few hundred manpower.

"This is the magic of industrialized agriculture." Wu Nanhai looked up and smiled at the gate of Lingao First Fertilizer Plant. Compared with the simple bamboo fence wall, the factory gate was quite luxurious; it was a stone archway. This stone archway was originally chiseled by a local landlord who hired stonemasons to use it on his ancestral grave. Later, because this landlord "colluded with bandits", his whole family was forced to flee to the mainland, and his property was all confiscated. This archway became the property of the Planning Commission. The plaque on it was inscribed by Liu Dalin. Although this Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) didn't know what chemical fertilizer was, let alone phosphate fertilizer, he understood the matter of increasing production.

Since it could increase grain production, it was a great benevolent policy, so Jinshi Liu did not decline and wrote these large characters with a brush.

"Jinshi Liu's calligraphy is indeed good. Hmm... like dragons flying and phoenixes dancing..." Wu Nanhai was quite proud—he had personally asked for the calligraphy. Although he knew basically nothing about calligraphy.

Inside the factory area, heads were moving, colorful flags were fluttering; everything was ready, just waiting for them.

A group of Senators led by Ma Qianzhu were already standing in front of the opening ceremony platform. Ji Tuisie, however, was smoking under the rostrum, looking smilingly at the increasingly broad Wu Nanhai walking over. He waved his hand indifferently at Wu Nanhai's repeated apologies for being late.

"Old Wu, you look good." Ji Tuisie patted Wu Nanhai on the shoulder.

"Not bad, not bad." Wu Nanhai knew that Ji Tuisie had helped a lot with the fertilizer plant matter. Of course, the fertilizer plant and the supporting sulfuric acid project were essentially projects of the chemical industry sector; helping him was also helping himself. But this favor was still heavy. He clasped his hands repeatedly and said half-jokingly, "Great kindness needs no words of thanks."

"Not at all, not at all." Ji Tuisie felt quite high-spirited due to the continuous projects in the chemical industry sector recently. "We help each other. We will have even better cooperation in the future."
