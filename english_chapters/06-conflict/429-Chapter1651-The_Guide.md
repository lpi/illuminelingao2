# Chapter 1651 - The Guide

Hearing his wife's gentle words of comfort, Lin Ming felt somewhat consoled. Yet he could not tell her the truth—though capable and competent, she was still a woman. Knowing would only make her worry alongside him without being able to offer any solution. Moreover, she was not like the concubines—she too came from a hereditary Jinyiwei family. If she learned of this, her fear would only deepen.

He forced a smile. "It's nothing. I was just away so long that I'm truly exhausted. And I feel guilty for not bringing Qianqian back... I've thought it through now—one can only do one's best and leave the rest to fate."

"It's good if you can think of it that way," Lady Lin said. Her mind was sharp, and she could see that although he claimed to have "thought it through," the furrow between his brows had not eased. She knew her consolation had missed the mark and felt secretly puzzled. But she didn't know how to raise the topic again. Then she heard Lin Ming suddenly speak:

"Wife, how do you see the state of the world?"

Lady Lin was as clever as they came. One glance at this question told her it was inauspicious. She lowered her voice: "Husband, why would you say such things? Be careful not to be overheard..."

"This is the inner quarters. Who would hear us besides her?" Lin Ming smiled bitterly, glancing at Bibo, who slept soundly—this girl truly was without a care in the world.

"Even if she heard, it wouldn't matter," Lady Lin said. "But such talk is pointless—it's not for the likes of our family to wag our tongues about."

"Just say what you think."

"The times are bad," Lady Lin said. "From the letters my family sends, things in the north are a wasteland of sorrow, with bandits everywhere. Only here and in Jiangnan do we still have peace."

"Do you think the times can improve?"

"I don't know." Lady Lin sighed. "At least Guangdong remains a land of peace and prosperity. While we're still able to sip tea, let's sip tea. Let's not discuss affairs of state—the more one talks, the more one's heart grows troubled."

From his wife's words, Lin Ming detected her pessimism about the state of the world. He decided to probe her views on the Australians:

"Wife, Guangdong may not stay a land of peace and prosperity for long!" He sighed deliberately.

"What do you mean?" Lady Lin became instantly alert.

"Wife, do you remember the Cropped-Head Bandits who burst into the Pearl River and pressed right up to the walls of Guangzhou three years ago?"

"How could I forget? It was terrifying at the time. Martial law everywhere. Cannon teams and troops kept marching past. And they threw together a mob of bandit-like irregulars. Before the Cropped-Heads even arrived, they had the whole region in chaos..."

The commotion caused by the Cropped-Heads had left Foshan's people with impressions mainly of the government's grain and fodder levies, and of the "auxiliary defense" units—Chaozhou braves and Tanka water fighters—who extorted "defense fees" and seized opportunities to plunder merchants and commoners. As for the Cropped-Head Bandits themselves—their faces, their manner—the people had no impression whatsoever. The Cropped-Heads had made straight for Guangzhou, and though their forces had briefly threatened Foshan, they had not actually passed through. Ultimately, she had heard, they extracted a ransom for lifting the siege—though naturally, the Lin Centurion's household was not of a rank to contribute to such matters.

"...But after the Cropped-Heads left, the region did quiet down considerably. I heard they killed quite a few bandits. A blessing in disguise, I suppose."

"On this journey, I saw many Cropped-Heads and Cropped-Head ships along the way. Their power has grown even greater than before," Lin Ming said in a low voice.

"You mean..." Lady Lin came from an official family and caught the implication at once. "Surely not. Aren't they like the Folangjiren—just here to trade with the Great Ming? Now their business is booming and silver pours in like water. And the officials leave them be. Why would they want to fight the Great Ming? Once war starts, their trade would be cut off."

"Hard to say!" Lin Ming shook his head. "They're not as content with their lot as the Folangjiren..."

"What would we do if they attacked? You're a court-appointed official!" Lady Lin was full of worry. "Even if they don't expect you to fight, if the Cropped-Heads want to execute people to establish their authority..."

"If fighting comes, we hide—that's all. I'm only a minor centurion. Would they really care about my head?"

"Alas, that's our only option. At worst, you give up your post," Lady Lin said. "As long as our whole family stays together, safe and sound, that's what matters." She gazed tenderly at Bibo. "All these girls are such darlings. If war came, they'd just be ruined for nothing..."

Lin Ming's heart steadied somewhat—he now fully understood his wife's attitude. As long as she wasn't set on being a loyal minister of the Great Ming, that was good enough.

"Then... should we perhaps purchase a residence in Guangzhou first?" Lady Lin asked quietly. "Not that I'm afraid of the Cropped-Heads coming—I've heard they don't touch a blade of grass when they pass through, so long as you don't provoke them—but I do worry about ruffians causing chaos if there's a disturbance. Foshan has no city walls..."

"Let's not rush. We'll wait and see how things develop," Lin Ming said. "They won't attack immediately." He glanced at the incense clock. "It's late. Let's sleep."

Centurion Lin's carefree days did not last long. One early morning, he arrived as usual at the familiar teahouse. First, a few sips of tea to awaken his spirits, then several plates of dim sum to satisfy his empty stomach. Only then would he proceed to the garrison to sign in—and so another day's cycle would properly begin.

His table was, as always, reserved. Without being told, the tea master brought out the tea set and the slop bowl—all items he kept stored at the teahouse for personal use. Lin Ming took his time scalding and rinsing all the cups, chopsticks, and utensils. Only then did the tea master bring fresh tea.

Lin Ming poured himself a full cup and sipped leisurely. But after just a few sips, his eyes widened.

On the wall opposite the teahouse was a contact signal from the External Intelligence Bureau!

*So soon!* he thought. After formally surrendering, his assignment had been transferred to the External Intelligence Bureau, with Li Yan now directing his activities. Li Yan had spoken with him—no formal mission had been issued, but he knew when they activated him, it would not be for trivial matters. With the Australians' current power, gathering information around Guangzhou hardly required his services—plenty of money-grubbing people were ready to sell out their masters at a moment's notice.

Now his interest in tea vanished entirely. He hurriedly ate breakfast, went to the garrison to sign in, then followed the pre-arranged contact protocol Li Yan had given him. He met his "Instructor" on a flower boat.

Lin Ming had no notion of what an "Instructor" was in official terms. The man before him was somewhat plump-faced, wearing a plain *zhidui* robe of Shandong pongee silk—the look of a not-very-successful small merchant.

"Reporting to Your Excellency..." Lin Ming adopted the submissive manner of a recent defector, lest he give his "superior" a poor impression that might result in a negative assessment later—that would truly leave him stuck between two stools.

"No need for that, Comrade Lin." The Instructor shook his head. "We're all comrades here. We don't follow the Ming court's old ways."

"Yes, yes, your humble officer understands." Lin Ming kept his head bowed. "I wonder what the superior officer requires of me."

"Ahem." The Instructor seemed somewhat uncomfortable. "Comrade Lin, I told you not to be so bureaucratic. Never mind—I'll just speak plainly."

"Yes! Please instruct me."

"You're a native of Foshan and a Centurion of the Jinyiwei—an old hand in the western suburbs of Sui City. That's why the Center has decided to entrust this mission to you."

"Yes, I'm honored by the Center's trust. I will go through fire and water without hesitation."

"All right, all right." The Instructor's face began to bead with sweat. He was, in fact, originally a small merchant, and having served the Cropped-Heads for several years, he found these official courtesies uncomfortable. "Your mission this time concerns the fate of our Great Song nation." His voice grew emphatic. "You must use every means at your disposal to complete it."

"I understand!" Now it was Lin Ming's forehead that began to sweat. If it "concerned the fate of Great Song," these were no casual words—clearly this was no small matter. Could it be they wanted him to trick open Guangzhou's city gates and welcome the Australian army inside? That seemed unlikely to require him—if the Australians were willing to spend silver, plenty of people would leap at the chance. Besides, they already had the Purple Mark inside Guangzhou and the Great World outside. Taking Guangzhou would be as easy as reaching into a pocket.

The other man had mentioned he was a "Foshan native" and "an old hand in the western suburbs"—so this probably involved Foshan.

"In a few days, someone will come from Lingao," the Instructor said, briefing him in a low voice. "After you make contact with them, you'll be under their command. Follow all their instructions."

"Yes, understood." Lin Ming was somewhat nervous. "If I may ask what the specific mission is, I should prepare in advance."

"Your mission is to serve as a guide. Just follow their orders along the way."

"A guide?"

"Exactly. The superiors want you to lead them on a tour along the West River and the North River. You've been to these places—is there a problem?"

"Serving as a guide presents no difficulty. But..." Lin Ming was secretly alarmed: though he didn't know what purpose this "tour" served, the blade aimed at Pei Gong—the Australians were probably about to make their move on the region. He quickly reminded himself not to panic. This was an excellent opportunity to earn merit. He said: "But the routes along the West and North Rivers are thick with mountain bandits and river pirates, plus some lawless local tyrants. If I alone am guiding them, I cannot guarantee their safety on the road. I think it would be best to arrange some official status—that way, not only can we request garrison protection along the route, but there will also be porters, boats, sedan chairs, and horses provided at each stop."

The Instructor considered for a moment. "Your idea has merit, but it involves the authorities. I'll need to consult with my superiors. If we use an official status, what title would you suggest?"

Lin Ming smiled. "There are many options—investigation, search and inspection—the garrison can issue documents for any of these with a single word. That would make everything convenient along the way, and we'd travel in style."

"That's quite clever." The Instructor also smiled. "Very well. Make your preparations. I'll report to the superiors before deciding."
