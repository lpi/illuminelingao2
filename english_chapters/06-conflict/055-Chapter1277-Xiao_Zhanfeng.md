# Chapter 1277 Xiao Zhanfeng

"This student, Xiao Zhanfeng, pays his respects to the Eastern Host." The visitor halted at the foot of the steps and swept into a deep bow.

Wu Mingjin studied the young scholar from his elevated position. The man wore the green robe and Confucian scarf of a Ming dynasty licentiate, his bearing and speech marking him unmistakably as a genuine "Bachelor"—not one of those rough-handed peasants the *Kun* bandits so favored recruiting.

Wu Mingjin had witnessed scholars defect to the *Kun* before, but most were perpetual candidates who had spent decades attempting the examinations only to die as commoners. Those holding actual degrees who chose to defect remained vanishingly rare.

"Sir, such formality is unnecessary," Wu Mingjin replied with practiced courtesy. When Wang Zhaomin had mentioned the *Kun* people's desire to "hire" him a private assistant for "paperwork," he had immediately grasped the true purpose.

Though called a private assistant, the man would function as a "supervising army official." Wu Mingjin understood perfectly that traveling to Leizhou to serve as an official in *Kun* territory was like Sun Wukong trapped in Buddha's palm—better to play deaf and dumb.

Besides, wasn't Wang Zhaomin already a *Kun* spy watching his every move? And Head Chief Xiong had so diligently provided servants and armed escorts, each wearing a mask of respect while secretly serving as personal jailers.

This thought drew a sigh from Wu Mingjin's lips: *Once entering the officialdom, it is as deep as the sea; from then on, integrity becomes a stranger.* Were it not for the sake of his position and the silver needed for retirement, why would he have come to this?

Composing his expression into a gracious smile, he produced the letter of appointment he had prepared well in advance. Written in his own hand on a large red card, the words "Engagement Letter" adorned its face. The salary: twenty-four taels per year, with an additional two taels for each of the three festivals. A label on the envelope read: "For Old Master Xiao to Keep."

Xiao Zhanfeng accepted the letter, and both sides exchanged the customary pleasantries. As protocol demanded, Wu Mingjin offered to host a welcoming banquet, but Xiao Zhanfeng graciously declined.

"Since this student has accepted the Eastern Host's engagement, I must first return home to settle my affairs before accompanying the Hall Host to assume office."

"And where might you hail from, Sir?"

"This student is from Xuwen County."

*Not bad at all*, Wu Mingjin mused. Xuwen was a subordinate county of Leizhou—having the man there would prove most convenient. The *Kun* people had clearly thought this through.

"Eastern Host, please rest assured. I shall return within two days. I have already arranged for a first-class ticket on Dabo Shipping."

Scheduled boats departed for Guangzhou daily, but those with first-class cabins sailed only every three days. Master Wu and his party would need to remain at the Bopu Hotel's private rooms for two more days.

Xiao Zhanfeng did indeed rush back to Xuwen that same day—though not to settle any family affairs. He had neither parents nor wife and children; he was the very picture of bachelorhood, where "one person eats and the whole family is fed."

His true purpose was to arrange work in advance. Three days prior, Xiao Zhanfeng had been appointed deputy station chief of the Leizhou Station of the External Intelligence Bureau, with full responsibility for officialdom affairs in Leizhou—particularly monitoring Wu Mingjin.

Three years earlier, during the sugar war, Xiao Zhanfeng had helped Chang Shide and Wen Tong defeat a group of unemployed workers who attempted to cause trouble. This earned him the appreciation of Chen Tianxiong and others. Yet Xiao Zhanfeng had acted without profit in mind. After the Haiyi Hall's destruction, he accepted Chen Tianxiong's twenty-tael gift of thanks but politely declined the invitation to work as a clerk at the South China Sugar Factory or the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild.

"This student wishes to study diligently and at least earn a green robe before considering commercial careers," Xiao Zhanfeng had explained. "I accept this silver with gratitude—it shall serve as capital for my studies."

The truth was that Xiao Zhanfeng had a childhood sweetheart: his cousin, with whom he shared a secret engagement. But with his family fallen into decline and himself a down-and-out scholar who could not pass his examinations, even his reasonable uncle and aunt would never marry their daughter to such a destitute pauper.

Chen Tianxiong had felt the loss keenly. This young man possessed both a chivalrous spirit and fierce intellectual curiosity—ideal material for cultivation. He hadn't expected the scholar to still pin everything on the imperial examinations.

Yet there was something admirable in a man who harbored ambition for self-improvement. Chen Tianxiong nodded. "Since that is the case, I shall not press further. Should you ever need anything, come to South China. My sugar factory will always have a vacant seat waiting for you, Sir."

The two shared wine beneath the lychee tree at Xiao Zhanfeng's home. When the last cup was drained, they bid farewell with mutual best wishes.

Xiao Zhanfeng threw himself into his studies with single-minded focus, eventually obtaining the title of "Attached Student." Though this was the lowest rank of licentiate, he had at last donned the green robe. Heart pounding with excitement, he rushed to his uncle's house to announce the good news—only to learn that his cousin was already betrothed, with the wedding date already set.

The licentiate title in hand changed nothing; he remained a pauper. At best, he might teach at a private school and scrape by. His cousin was already eighteen—no longer young enough to wait. His uncle and aunt's decision could not be called unreasonable by any measure. But Xiao Zhanfeng's bitterness had no outlet, and he trudged home in black despair. Heavy rain caught him on the road, and by the time he reached his door, he had fallen gravely ill.

When Xiao Zhanfeng finally emerged from that illness—disheartened and burning with hatred for Ming society—he made his decision. He would seek out Chen Tianxiong. He would defect to the *Kun*.

"In that case, why not start as a clerk at the Sugar Industry Guild..."

"No, Mr. Chen. I wish to go to Lingao." Xiao Zhanfeng's voice rang with conviction. "To study Australian learning. I have heard that the Australians in Lingao operate schools and teach their methods. I wish to study there and seek my future under their banner."

Chen Tianxiong stared in genuine surprise. He had encountered many Ming intellectuals curious about "Australian learning," but most dismissed it as "ingenious skills and wicked craft." Few delved into its principles, and fewer still wished to learn. His expression grew cautious.

"The South China Sugar Factory can also teach Australian learning..."

"Is Mr. Chen unwilling to let this student go to Lingao?" Xiao Zhanfeng's voice rose. "How could I not know of the Australians' conduct there? Let me speak plainly: I no longer wish to be a licentiate of the Great Ming. I wish to go to Lingao and become a scholar of the Great Song!" He dropped to his knees in a full bow. "I beg you, sir—help me fulfill this wish!"

And so Xiao Zhanfeng entrusted his house key to Chen Tianxiong, asking him to manage the property on his behalf. Taking only a few clothes, a few books, his seal, and a pair of twisted silver bracelets—mementos left by his parents—he boarded a sugar transport ship and sailed for Lingao. From that moment forward, he embarked upon the path of serving the Senate and its people.

Xiao Zhanfeng's defection caused a minor sensation within the Senate. Previously, while a handful of licentiates had joined the naturalized citizens of Lingao, they were either disaster victims passively taken in or men who came merely to fill their bellies. Never before had someone with a degree actively defected with such a clear-cut banner and firm resolve. Xiao Zhanfeng was the first licentiate to "defect to the *Kun*" of his own volition.

After leaving the quarantine camp, Xiao Zhanfeng enrolled in the National School in Lingao—passing the Class A diploma examination—then attended the Civil Affairs Training Class specially commissioned by the Civil Affairs People's Committee to cultivate local administrative cadres. During his studies, he not only learned diligently but also submitted numerous letters discussing state affairs, seemingly eager to "offer guidance" and "provide suggestions" to the Senate. Yet as his education deepened and his "visits and studies" across Lingao continued, these letters grew fewer and fewer until they ceased entirely. He had soon recognized that in matters of governance, he had been displaying his meager skills before masters.

After graduation, Xiao Zhanfeng served successively as village head in several Lingao villages, then rose to commune civil affairs assistant before transferring to serve in the Danzhou County Office. Young and originally well-educated, he absorbed new knowledge and concepts faster and more thoroughly than naturalized citizens from peasant or merchant backgrounds. He quickly became a key training target of the Civil Affairs Department, earmarked to become one of the first batch of naturalized county magistrates.

This transfer to Wu Mingjin's side, though primarily the Intelligence Bureau's design, was also considered excellent training by the Civil Affairs Department, who readily agreed to the secondment.

Xiao Zhanfeng disembarked at Hai'an with a handful of attendants. He did not return to his home in the county seat—neither relatives nor property awaited him there—but proceeded directly to the Leizhou Sugar Industry United Guild.

He reported to the person in charge, Yan Maoda. Although the station chief of Leizhou Station was technically Wen Tong, that man's energies were consumed by the sugar industry, leaving him little attention for other matters. The actual operations fell to Yan Maoda—deputy station chief and general manager of the Vietnam Trade Company. Publicly, he served as Chief Steward of the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild. Secretly, he controlled all Senate forces across Leizhou's three counties.

"Of the three counties in Leizhou, Xuwen is where our control runs deepest," Yan Maoda explained. "Whether it's the county magistrate or the yamen runners and clerks in the three squads and six offices, we have nearly achieved the point where orders are obeyed without question. Haikang and Suixi are slightly less penetrated, but those officials and petty clerks have all been... accommodated. They generally won't make trouble for themselves."

As he spoke, Yan Maoda signaled for someone to retrieve a thick file box from the cabinet.

"This material I copied for you per the Intelligence Bureau's instructions. It contains personal and family information on all officials, clerks, gentry, and prominent families currently active across Leizhou Prefecture and its three counties. There is also an overview of basic conditions throughout the whole county—farmers, population, production, and so forth."

"Thank you so much, Chief!" Xiao Zhanfeng deeply appreciated this hallmark of Australian methodology: everything documented down to the smallest detail. Through his years of administrative practice, he had come to understand the critical importance of intelligence. The Australians' ability to overcome every obstacle owed much to their capacity for gathering and transmitting information in real time.

"Ha! You're too polite." Yan Maoda smiled. "Wu Mingjin is merely a figurehead. The real work falls to you."
