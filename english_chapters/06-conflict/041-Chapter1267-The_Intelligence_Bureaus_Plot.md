# Chapter 1267 - The Intelligence Bureau's Plot

"Indeed, the blood of a samurai flows in his veins," someone whispered in praise.

Tō Tarō took a sip of wine. Now that it was confirmed Fusong was safely detained in Camp Alpha, the next step was to consider how to rescue him.

The first step was to get him out of Camp Alpha—this had great difficulty. Sneaking in to talk was one thing; smuggling him out past the sentries was another. The Vagabond guards inspected incoming and outgoing goods very strictly; any large cargo packaging capable of hiding an eight-year-old boy had wax seals or lead seals. No way to play tricks there.

After finding a way to get him out, the second step was to escape to the mainland overnight. Kinmen Island was very close to the mainland; Tō Tarō and his men could swim across without any flotation devices, but eight-year-old Fusong couldn't. They needed a small boat.

But now all boats on the island were in the Vagabonds' hands. No one could get a boat, and even if they could get a small boat, Australian patrol boats patrolled the waters around the island day and night. These patrol boats spewed smoke and fire and were very fast; once discovered, death was certain.

Neither of these two problems was easy to solve. Tō Tarō thought to himself that it wouldn't be hard for his group to escape; the difficulty lay in taking the child with them.

"We can find a way to rescue the person," Tō Tarō said. "But crossing the strait requires a boat—we don't have a boat, and even if we did, we couldn't get across."

"I can swim with Fusong on my back—" a mercenary subordinate said. "My hometown is on an island. I used to swim from one island to another with my little brother on my back. It's just that the distance here is a bit far, and my brother was only three or four years old then..."

"Tie a few bamboo tubes to the body; that can save some energy," someone suggested.

Although this plan felt a bit unreliable, there was no better way.

But the method to rescue Fusong remained elusive—Camp Alpha on Kinmen Island seemed lax but was actually heavily guarded externally. They thought of several plans but couldn't come up with one to get Fusong out. With Ning Liujin, they could sneak in, but they couldn't bring anyone out.

"It's a pity Fusong isn't a teenager; otherwise, I could swap him out..." a young mercenary said.

"Swapping people is a good idea, but where can we find a boy of the same age and stature as the Young Lord?"

"As long as we look, we can find one," Tō Tarō said. "But I'm afraid this child won't have the resolve to die for the Young Master. He'll be exposed in a few words."

Everyone fell into silence. So far, all their actions had been accurate, safe, and effective—they had done everything they wanted to do, giving these shrewd and bold Japanese mercenaries the illusion that they were omnipotent.

But at the critical moment, they suddenly realized they were completely helpless at the most crucial link. The mesh of the fishing net was large enough for small fish and shrimp to slip away easily, but the big fish couldn't get out.

"...The situation is like this, Chief," the Political Security Bureau officer responsibly for internal security in the Kinmen area reported.

"Good, you may go." Xu Ke put down the document in his hand. "Tell the comrades to continue monitoring their movements. Do not alert the enemy."

"Yes, Chief."

Xu Ke watched the back of the naturalized cadre disappear behind the door. He thought to himself: *Zheng Zhilong's subordinates still have some conscience!*

Xu Ke had grasped the series of activities of Tō Tarō's gang on Xiamen Island through informers planted in the prisoner camp by the Political Security Bureau. However, initially, he wasn't clear on what they intended to do, as their actions didn't look as simple as trying to escape, so he decided to observe them for a stage first. Only when someone reported that they were asking about a boy named "Fusong" did Xu Ke realize their true purpose.

That someone would secretly attempt to rescue Fusong was somewhat unexpected to him. According to his inference, now that the Zheng family was in chaos and Zheng Zhilong's fate was uncertain, none of his subordinates should have thought of rescuing Fusong.

Although some speculated that secret activities to rescue Fusong were evidence that Zheng Zhilong had escaped, Xu Ke thought this actually proved that Zheng Zhilong was likely dead. If Zheng Zhilong had escaped alive to the mainland, his primary task wouldn't be rescuing Fusong. Fusong wasn't that important to Zheng Zhilong: Zheng Zhilong was only thirty, and having heirs wasn't difficult for him. Fusong was just a child; surely he hadn't already demonstrated wise and martial qualities. The Zheng group had suffered a crushing defeat, its foundation shaken. As the leader, the first thing was to reorganize the old troops and deal with the situation, definitely not having the time and energy to rescue his son first.

Only if Zheng Zhilong was already dead would his former subordinates be eager to rescue Fusong to maintain the stability of the group or in hopes of relying on the young master to rise to power.

Capturing Zheng Sen was naturally a great victory for them, but this prisoner was truly a hot potato. So much so that news of his capture sparked intense controversy among the Senators as soon as it reached Lingao.

The core of the controversy was how to handle this future "Koxinga" of the old timeline. This issue was both sensitive and troublesome, to the point that Senators participating in Operation Overlord wished Ying Yu's shells had been more accurate—a glorious death in battle would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and psychological burden.

People of this timeline couldn't understand the Senate's complex feelings towards Zheng Sen. His status as a national hero in the old timeline was recognized by all Elders. Although these things hadn't happened yet in this timeline, and wouldn't happen again, getting rid of him like this was clearly unacceptable to many. People from the Huaxia Society had even let out word: they wanted to reform him and make him a "New Man" under the Senate's rule. Others proposed various reformation plans.

However, a large group of Senators, including Xu Ke, didn't like this "Reformation Theory." If Zheng Sen were still an infant or very young, he might have had the possibility of reformation. But he had already begun to understand things, and his behavior upon capture was unusually calm. Moreover, the Elders knew that Zheng Sen already held the status of "Heir" within the Zheng group.

And regarding the attack on Xiamen, not to mention whether it really killed his father, killing a large number of Zheng clan members was a certainty. The entire Zheng group received a devastating blow at the hands of the Senate. Not only that, but in the future, the Senate would also hang the crime of "hindering the development of productive forces" on his father and other pirate lords, organizing the masses to recall past bitterness and think of present sweetness, recalling the Zheng family's evils and being grateful for the Senate's kindness. Operation Overlord was another outstanding military victory; from ordinary soldiers to Elder officers, everyone would be proud of participating in this operation. A large number of soldiers would use this as conversational capital. How could one expect Little Zheng, growing up in such social conditions, to be won over?

There were quite a few Senators holding views like Xu Ke's, so some individual Elders demanded Zheng Sen be put to death: some wanted to finish him off secretly, some wanted a public execution, and some wanted to entrap him. However, killing a captured eight-year-old child merely because of blood relations was an insurmountable psychological barrier for many.

In this controversy, the Executive Committee and the heads of the main strong-arm departments didn't express specific views. Regarding how to deal with Zheng Sen, there was actually already a specific plan.

This plan was proposed at the meeting by Jiang Shan, Director of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau—of course, this was the result of a joint deliberation by the entire Foreign Intelligence Bureau and the Great Library think tank.

Specifically, the Senate didn't need this hot potato, so they could let Zheng Sen go.

Zheng Sen was not a crucial figure. Jiang Shan analyzed at the meeting: He was just an eight-year-old child; his life or death had little impact on the Zheng group's strength, that was one. Two, if Zheng Zhilong didn't die, then he would inevitably continue to be an insignificant "Heir"; if Zheng Zhilong was already dead, then Zheng Sen's return would add more variables to the already precarious Zheng group.

Theoretically, Zheng Sen was Zheng Zhilong's eldest son, the unquestionable heir to the Zheng group. But in fact, whether the power figures within the Zheng group thought so was another matter.

In the other timeline, after Zheng Zhilong was coerced by the Qing army to leave Fujian and lost control over the Zheng group, Zheng Sen, as the heir, although already an adult, didn't receive the support of the power figures within the group at all.

The entire Zheng group immediately fell into a state of fragmentation and leaderlessness after Zheng Zhilong was taken away. The Zheng Lian brothers occupied Xiamen, controlling most of the Zheng group's overseas trade and main military forces, while Zheng Zhifeng occupied Kinmen; each amassed troops and consolidated their own power.

After these two major forces carved up Zheng Zhilong's assets, not a single person invited Zheng Sen to act as the heir. When Zheng Sen raised his army in Anping, he had only ninety men listening to his command, without even a foothold. If not for the death of the Nan'ao defender Yue Jin, and the island sending people to request a new general, allowing Zheng Sen to take the opportunity to incorporate those few thousand men, he wouldn't even have had a starting force. One could imagine the true attitude of the power figures within the Zheng group towards this heir.

Currently, the Zheng group's situation hadn't developed to be as powerful as when Zheng Zhilong was taken away, let alone having suffered this devastating blow. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau estimated that if Zheng Zhilong was indeed killed, then the Zheng group would split even more severely than that time in the old timeline. The surviving Eighteen Chi members would inevitably fight for Zheng Zhilong's legacy, incompatible with each other like fire and water.

The Intelligence Bureau analyzed: Zheng Sen's return would not only fail to add cohesion to the Zheng group but would instead provide more excuses for disputes to the already fracturing Zheng family. Every faction would use controlling Fusong as a means to possess "righteousness" and "orthodox" status.

The already fragmented Zheng group would face even greater storms due to the introduction of this chess piece, Fusong.
