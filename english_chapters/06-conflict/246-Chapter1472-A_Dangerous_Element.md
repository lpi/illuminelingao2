# Chapter 1472 - A Dangerous Element

Upon hearing this name, Xiao Zishan instantly gripped his tea mug with both hands and frowned. The moniker "Black Four" hadn't been heard for several years. Four transmigrators who, back in the day, had attempted a night raid on Salina to "sample some foreign meat" but ended up beaten to a pulp—for the sake of the Senate's glorious image, the Executive Committee privately gave them this tacky and chuunibyou code name.

After being caught red-handed, the four were split up and sent to different departments far from the political center in "Horizon's Ends." They also enjoyed the unprecedented treatment of "monitored employment." Every month, Xiao Zishan received a "monitoring report" from the Political Security Bureau. Of course, this report was less about preventing them from continuing to do evil and more about preventing Salina from seeking revenge one day. Now Salina was also a transmigrator; if they really started fighting, it wouldn't be as simple as intentional injury or rape.

He mentally reviewed the whereabouts of these four scumbags: one playing second fiddle to Big Tiger in the Army, currently plaguing refugees in Kaohsiung; one serving as a technical supervisor in the industrial sector; another exiled to Gaoshan Ridge to preserve and archive knockoff technologies; only the last one, the mastermind of the assault back then, was a master at fishing in troubled waters—he recalled this one was later snatched by Cheng Dong for monitored employment.

"Could you mean that fellow Xin Wuzui?" Xiao Zishan said in a low voice.

"Precisely that fellow. Among us five hundred or so people, regardless of how frustrated we were in the old world, in this era we all count as figures knowing astronomy above and geography below, possessing unique skills, not yielding to anyone. But Xing Wuzui-san, you know, the skills he holds—even in the old timeline, few had heard of them." Zhao Manxiong glanced at Xiao Zishan and twisted out a smile.

"Hehe, Old Xiong, I'm starting to understand why you came." Xiao Zishan spoke slowly, "It seems the water below isn't muddy enough. Since Miss Flower wants to fish in troubled waters, let's send her a big black snakehead."

"As for this, consider it me helping you refresh your memory." Zhao Manxiong-ski slowly shifted up from the sofa. "I'll come pick it up personally in a few days." He brushed nonexistent dust from his legs, handed a file folder to Xiao Zishan, tapped gently on the invisible logo, and slowly walked out.

DELI. Xiao Zishan understood the meaning of this logo perfectly. Plastic file folders found on every street in the old timeline were absolute black technology in this timeline. Information in such a folder, in principle, must never be disseminated. Old Xiong leaving this clearly had extraordinary significance.

Opening the folder, the red "Top Secret" characters on the old-era plastic-sealed loose-leaf index page indicated this was a transmigrator's qualification certificate and a strictly confidential transmigrator file:

Name: Xin Wuzui. ID: 0127. Gender: Male. Ethnicity: Han... The formulaic identity page. Xiao Zishan thought, the name was fake without even looking, but this was common among transmigrators. What followed was some old-world résumé. Unsurprisingly, Xiao Zishan saw the growth history of a typical old-world elite: double degrees from prestigious schools, procurement engineer, key account sales manager, product planner, and finally deputy head of marketing at a well-known insurance company—also born in the late 70s, this guy mixed much better than I did. Xiao Zishan secretly recalled this hateful forum show-off back when he came to join Chief Wen and the others:

Wuzui-san was a slightly chubby southerner wearing a harmless baby face, with long eyelashes and big eyes exuding innocence. A pair of lensless GUCCI glasses perched on his nose. He always wore tacky suits and shirts, but a little attention revealed English calligraphy monograms on the shirt cuffs or inside the suit jacket. The corner of his mouth always held a playful smile; from a distance, he looked like a chubby Terry Lin. But Xiao Zishan, having dealt with him, knew very well that this baby-faced guy wearing understated Haute Couture was definitely a scumbag written as elite. Actually, on some levels he was like Superintendent Ma: in their eyes, whether industrial party or sentimental party made no difference. to them, humility was camouflage, smiles were masks, and politeness was merely a means to keep people at a distance.

But no group would refuse someone coming to join with huge interests. The transmigration group had used his channels to purchase excessive accident insurance for all transmigrators to ensure their families in the old world would live worry-free, gaining tens of millions in funds. According to his account before joining, he used several properties in Magic City as mortgaged startup capital, packaged Chief Wen's shell company as a cultural development company that had struck gold to fabricate projects, and raised huge sums from banks and private equity. Finally, a month before the bubble burst, he successfully arrived in the Ming Dynasty.

This guy really had some energy, Xiao Zishan thought. Back then, the Big Three spent months moving Kraak porcelain to scrape together ten million for initial accumulation. After this guy joined, he quickly used financial instruments and repeated collateral pledges to easily expand the original capital cost, greatly alleviating financial pressure. But this person was a dangerous element. Xiao Zishan recalled that after the Salina assault incident, the Senate held an interrogation meeting facing a comrade transmigrator for the first time. Some details were blurry, but he clearly remembered how this guy substituted concepts, used glib talk, and argued irrationally. People with shallower social experience and insufficient cultivation would probably have been swayed immediately, unknowingly taking his bait.

"Some thoughts you can think, you can do, but absolutely never say." Xiao Zishan thought, "Wuzui is also an extreme male chauvinist, and he shouted it out loud. In his view, no matter how excellent women are, they are merely men's playthings. In the old world, not only was his wife obedient to him at home, but he also had several long-term fuck buddies outside, sparing no one from young girls to young matrons. Moreover, he mastered an art written as love but read as SM. As a senior gentleman possessing a legendary beauty-dog, he caused everyone on the forum to donate quite a bit of gasoline and thermite back then."

But as novels go, the protagonist finally messed with someone he shouldn't have, got involved with a girl he shouldn't have. At a high-end annual meeting, this person effortlessly hooked up with the daughter of a certain local potentate. The girl, fresh out of college, quickly fell for the bad middle-aged man's dashing demeanor. While the uncle-complex girl was dreaming of love, photos of Wuzui-san walking other female dogs were posted online. The girl's glass heart shattered instantly. After screaming her heart out at the Great Gentleman for over an hour, she turned and jumped from a 32nd-floor balcony wearing a collar. In that instant, Wuzui-san knew he had to say goodbye to this world.

As a former senior SM enthusiast and failed female dog training expert, he confessed candidly to plotting the abduction and providing equipment and plans to train Salina (who wasn't a transmigrator yet) without any sense of guilt. He shouted his maxim loudly:

"Every life in nature has its deserved place. A woman's place is beneath a man's feet."

"You fame-seeking guy, that was clearly said by John Norman!" Xiao Zishan cursed silently.

His unwavering belief in the "philosophy" of truly "liberating" women made the interrogators think they had encountered someone from another world. So much so that Mu Min, participating as a non-transmigrator advisor, slammed the case file directly into this old hooligan's face and stormed out, while Wuzui-san, relying on his extraordinary contribution and transmigrator status, enjoyed the pleasure of "spit drying on one's face" without psychological pressure.

Xiao Zishan turned to a crucial part of the binder, a sub-document starting with a black cover and red text—*Case File of the 1629 Assault Incident*. In it, Xin Wuzui and the other three were sentenced to permanently stay away from Salina and could only work with other female transmigrators under surveillance. Xin Wuzui additionally was barred from overseas posts and departmental leadership positions without Executive Committee approval. This equated to not only confining Wuzui-san in Lingao but also placing a glass ceiling over him. Subsequently, he saw this Gentleman Comrade's work history. With an actuary background, this guy was long used by the Planning Department and Wudaokou as a human data analysis machine for big data analysis, and aiding the Planning Department in building data models for the Five-Year Plan via the computer center. Later, with the upgrade of Fragrant Fields Academy, Wuzui-san was grabbed by Hu Qingbai to provide enlightenment education on data analysis and basic SOP training to senior primary students twice a week under the supervision of a Political Security Bureau officer assigned to the school. Xiao Zishan closed the binder—*This must be when he connected with your Political Security Bureau, right?* As a fellow fanatic of ISO standards, Xiao Zishan understood why Zhao Manxiong came to him instead of Chief Wen. This guy was simply a natural ally and advisor to Chief Wen, who was equally uninhibited with women. And Old Xiong was famous for never intervening in the Wen-Ma struggle.

The key was how to release this vicious fish and how to reel it back. Xiao Zishan couldn't help but gulp another mouthful of Longjing. Zhao Manxiong seemed to have planned this long ago; otherwise, he wouldn't have leaked this public enemy of women from his pocket for me to see. He came to me just to let me know. Xin Wuzui was indeed potent medicine. Throwing him out would inevitably cause an uproar. Even if the vast majority of transmigrators didn't know the truth about the Black Four, just stating his theory of female liberation would make not only Queen Du but even the female transmigrators most accepting of male concubinage fight him to the death.

"The best way to extinguish a fire is to set off a bigger explosion next to it?" Xiao Zishan recalled Speaker Qian's famous words and fell into deep thought.
