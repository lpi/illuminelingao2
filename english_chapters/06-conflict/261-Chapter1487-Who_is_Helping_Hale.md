# Chapter 1487 - Who is Helping Hale

The supply of sulfur from Japan via the Tokugawa Shogunate's Sakoku envoys had been cut off, leaving only a small supply from northern Taiwan. However, the business of purchasing processed sulfur from indigenous people in Tamsui had always been handled by Chinese merchants, which the Spaniards considered economically uneconomical. Moreover, since the Australians established a trade fortress in southern Taiwan, they also began purchasing sulfur on a large scale. Chinese merchants were quickly attracted to Kaohsiung, which had much better trading credit and could provide more trade goods. This caused the Spanish purchasing situation to deteriorate by the day.

Although Governor Salamanca had sent messengers ordering the colonial troops stationed in Keelung and Tamsui to seize sulfur-producing areas by force and control the sulfur trade, shipping reinforcements and large amounts of new guns and ammunition regardless of cost, distant water couldn't quench imminent thirst. Hale could only try to open sources and reduce expenditure. The former was trying to manufacture sulfur by roasting pyrite with charcoal. As for reducing expenditure, that meant except for No. 1 black powder ground into fine grains for gun firing and detonator ignition, other black powder utilized a sulfur-free formula of 80% saltpeter and 20% charcoal.

"Allocate all inventory No. 1 powder to fill fuzes and cannon friction primers. We must ensure equipment supply for the artillery. You heard what I said to His Highness the Marquis," Hale continued instructing his sailor henchman: "Suspend gunpowder supply for muskets until the new mixing drum is installed and begins operation."

"But so many rifles have been manufactured. The Spaniards will—"

"Marcos, you need to continue strengthening your professional learning. First, by my standards, those are just smoothbore guns, not rifles. Second, they don't count as manufactured by us. We just slightly modified old matchlocks Spaniards dug out from the armory, changing the lock and re-boring the barrel. Captain Pilar pestered me to design new cavalry pistols for him. But those are all insignificant gadgets, impossible to become weights changing the war situation. Compared to cannons, they are nothing; artillery is the true god of war."

Walking out of the gunpowder production workshop, Marcos tried to persuade his patron to inspect the starch factory again.

"Went yesterday," Hale seemed disdainful. "I see no necessity to go again today."

"Those Chinese either don't know how to work at all, or they are intentionally stealing raw materials. I think the former possibility is greater. Ruining all the inventory corn, making piles of garbage only fit for fertilizer, resulting in just that little starch—too little even to feed rats. Now they started ruining our sweet potatoes—"

"Enough, I know those Hokkiens were originally arrowroot starch makers. What, never heard of arrowroot starch? Marcos, you are a pitiful man who hasn't even eaten Japanese wagashi. I mean: their former trade included extracting starch from sweet potatoes to pass off as arrowroot starch. The work I assigned them is their own trade. Of course, without my guidance and your supervision. There's good news to tell you," Hale revealed a feigned mysterious smile, "I found a new source, from a place you absolutely wouldn't expect. Readymade high-quality starch, enough for me to make explosives to level a whole city."

"Yes, Sir." Marcos swallowed. Coming from the 21st century, he felt no mystery about this Japanese man's actions, but the fanaticism burning in this man often frightened him.

"Also, your fiancée asked me yesterday when you would probably go to see her," Marcos hesitated, "I feel she misses you very much..." Saying this, he took out a letter wrapped in a Chinese silk handkerchief. "This is what she asked me to pass to you."

"I don't have time." Hale frowned, not taking the handkerchief bundle—his hands were pitch black.

"But, Sir—"

Hale knew what his assistant wanted to say: the "fiancée" couldn't be slighted.

This noble illegitimate daughter the Spaniards prepared to stuff into his bed—he had no need for her spiritually or physically. But the "fiancée" was of noble birth, symbolizing not only his acceptance by the Spanish gentry in the Philippines as "one of their own," but also representing recognition by New Spain and even Peninsular nobility. Ignoring her too much was indeed inappropriate.

"Alright, my dear Marcos. Regardless of spacetime, women are always sentimental. We have plenty of things to do; why does she want to see me? To have me play the mandolin under her boudoir window? Where would I find the time?" He thought for a moment. "Come to my office tomorrow morning; I will have a reply ready."

"Yes, Sir. I suggest you prepare another small gift."

"Marcos, you are absolutely right. Spanish human blood must flow in your veins."

"Ready to serve you!"

"Stop talking about women matters. Is everything I asked you to arrange ready?"

"All ready."

"You ensure no one knows?"

"I guarantee. I personally took your students and servants. They are all most reliable."

Hale's so-called students and servants were a group he personally selected and trained. Japanese, Chinese, local natives, and mixed-bloods. They formed Hale's "inner circle."

Hale nodded. The Spanish dignitaries in the Philippines had a morbid sense of crisis, always feeling Chinese, Dutch, and English were attempting to seize their colony. Although the person he was to meet tomorrow no longer had his former prestige, if Spaniards knew he actually came quietly to Manila, it would inevitably arouse endless suspicion, and the cooperation between him and the other party would be completely ruined.

"It seems we underestimated this Japanese kid too much. Single-handed, he not only rallied a group of people but also made such a scene in the Philippines while we weren't paying attention."

The External Intelligence Bureau's secure conference room was modeled after the Political Security Bureau's style. Windows opened near the ceiling on the walls and were tightly closed at this moment. The indoor temperature made people sweat profusely, but representatives from various departments attending the joint meeting all silently flipped through folders, reading recent intelligence clips about Manila. Even if someone uttered a comment or cracked a joke, they quickly fell silent due to lack of response. The atmosphere in the room was near freezing point.

"This material can't be trusted," Wang Ruixiang slapped the folder closed and threw it onto the table in front of him.

"Leaving aside other things, the numbers don't match. Monthly production figures for the Little Jap's so-called factory—shells, fuzes, gunpowder—several figures appeared here and there, no two alike."

"Correct, because the numbers have different sources. Some are what Hale verbally reported to Spanish officials, some come from colonial government records of receiving and allocating munitions, some are estimated based on reports of raw material consumption by the Manila factory. The notes after the report list them all. Accuracy is worth discussing, but simple denial across the board won't do," Jiang Shan said. Office life all day made his face gaunt, eyes sunken, gaze appearing increasingly sharp and aggressive. "Contrasting these numbers, undoubtedly Hale's boasted output to Spaniards has much water. But even squeezing out the water, by 17th-century standards, the output of this semi-mechanized munitions factory already exceeds those European manual workshops. It must arouse our attention; after all, the Philippines is much closer to us than Europe."

"Output isn't the most important issue," someone expressed a view: "If Hale makes spherical solid shots for Spaniards, it doesn't matter even if he produces thousands a month. But since this kid can rifle smoothbore guns, make explosive shells with contact fuzes, and even built submarines—in short, bringing a qualitative leap to the white skins' armament level—that is absolutely another matter."

"Leap? At best it counts as hopping twice." Wang Ruixiang sniffed disdainfully: "I don't believe this kid can produce any modernized weapons and ammunition empty-handed. Without essential instruments, it's basically impossible. Without conical gauges and angle gauges, how does he process qualified conical projectile bodies? Without thermometers and hygrometers to measure and control temperature and humidity, how does he synthesize mercury fulminate without fearing blowing himself up?"

"He has all these. Or rather, Hale can get them all."

"Get from where? Who would provide him with precision instruments?"

"Spaniards or Europeans. Of course, us too." Wu Mu's tone was peaceful, but instantly attracted the gazes of everyone present, containing curiosity, astonishment, and perhaps a trace of fear.

Wu Mu had evidently prepared; he leisurely pulled several sheets of paper from a file bag: "The Political Security Bureau and the Navy recently joined hands to dig out a criminal gang lurking within the Southeast Asia Company targeting Senate property. According to preliminary interrogation results, the gang organizers are members who formerly belonged to Zhu Cailao's bandit gang and later surrendered to us, plus multiple naturalized cadre members involved. Initially, it was thought this gang's main crime was stealing and selling Nanyang-style rifles, pistols, typewriters, percussion caps, ammunition, etc., allocated for merchant ship self-defense. Later it was discovered that various instruments and tools were also their targets, including magnetic compasses, thermometers, psychrometers, barometers, sextants, nautical slide rules, and drawing tools, not even sparing screwdrivers. These stolen materials were generally written off from equipment registration lists under the name of damage or loss due to wind, waves, pirate attacks, or theft by locals in port. Weapon buyers include pirates and some officials of Southeast Asian kingdoms. As for instruments, interested customers are basically European merchants and captains. Coincidentally, records show that during two stopovers in Manila port, the Southeast Asia Company ships *Meifu*, *Lishun*, and *Tunan* were unfortunately visited by thieves, and all lost navigational instruments. Is this merely a coincidence?"
