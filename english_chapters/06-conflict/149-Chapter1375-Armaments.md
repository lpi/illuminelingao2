# Chapter 1375 - Armaments

Zhao Yingong was generally confident about his own personal safety on the surface. Currently, he had roughly formed an "interest community" with some local gentry. However, he had already gained considerable fame in Hangzhou - as the saying goes, "a tall tree catches the wind." He might well attract the attention of "villainous people" and must be careful. The mountain villa's activities in the printing industry, the silk industry, and "Australian goods" distribution had touched many interest groups, especially the lower classes. If a mass incident occurred, relying on the government to maintain order was impossible. Even if the government was willing to behead people afterward to appease him, the lost money and time could not be recovered.

It seemed his security measures needed strengthening. Not only to protect himself, but also Phoenix Mountain Villa and the various industries below. Currently, they were all in an unprotected state.

He did have "security" forces at his disposal - the "Black Dragon Society" system directly under the External Intelligence Bureau. The Black Dragon Society system had established a "Fighter's Guild" in Hangzhou, openly called the "Black Dragon Guild." With External Intelligence Bureau personnel at its core, an "underground security force" had been built.

The "Black Dragon Guild" was formed by External Intelligence Bureau personnel gathering a group of loafers in Hangzhou, no different from various "Fighter's Guilds" inside and outside the city. What they did was also no different. During the debate between the Catholic Church and the monks that triggered conflict in Hangzhou earlier, they had been deployed to the back door of the church, ready to escort the church personnel to escape.

Although the leader was a special agent of the External Intelligence Bureau, Zhao Yingong himself did not have direct dealings with them. He only used Zhao Tong as an intermediary for contact, and paid for each operation as well - the Fighter's Guild had a bad reputation. Although some gentry did serve as their backers and used their power, no one openly associated with them.

The Black Dragon Guild didn't have many people. Only about forty could be gathered at any time, with an additional hundred or so peripherals who needed advance notice. By Hangzhou city standards, inside and outside, it was not a very large force. Zhao Yingong originally had no intention of letting them grow too large. This force currently had impure composition with a mixed bag of characters. If it developed too much power, it would be detrimental to future public security work. The main things he had the Black Dragon Guild do were gathering street intelligence and spreading rumors - they were familiar with the territory, and their associates included all sorts of people, so their information sources were very well-connected.

Now it seemed the Black Dragon Guild's force was too small, and most members were foxes and rats of the city. These people were fine for bullying and fighting, but when a real crisis required fighting for their lives, they couldn't be relied upon.

There had to be a reliable force: not only to maintain his own safety and that of the Hangzhou Station, but also to have the ability to strike at opponents at any time.

The Special Reconnaissance Team was certainly good, but the Special Reconnaissance Team had few people and limited deployment range - the closest Special Reconnaissance Team to him was in Kaohsiung. As a strike force, response time was a hard constraint.

The safer approach was to build his own force. However, Hangzhou was the premier prefecture of Jiangnan. Social order in the Ming Dynasty was top-tier. Openly raising Phoenix Mountain Villa militia was not acceptable; it had to be done secretly.

Currently, Phoenix Mountain Villa, Cihui Hall, and Wanbi Bookshop all had household servants responsible for guarding. But they hadn't received any training. Their basic work was just opening and closing gates on time, checking people coming and going, and patrolling and striking the watches at night. Their utility was limited.

Zhao Yingong had someone summon Zhao Tong. Zhao Tong was not only his personal bodyguard but also the head of Hangzhou Station's Security Department.

The result of their discussion was that Zhao Yingong decided to completely reorganize the current security system. First was to formally establish a quasi-military household servant force under the Security Department. Code name: "Star-Stepping Squad." Most members would be selected from the Zhejiang, northern Jiangsu, and Shandong refugees that had been taken in. Although they didn't know about the Council of Elders, they would receive full security training and implement military-style management. They would perform guard, patrol, and escort duties at the various industries of Hangzhou Station and would be the main force of Hangzhou Station's security.

Besides the "Star-Stepping Squad," a small-scale personal protection force was specially established, code name: "Inner Direct Squad." Directly trained and managed by Zhao Tong, with some hired escorts added to fill out the force. Mainly responsible for protecting Zhao Yingong, Elders visiting Hangzhou Station on business, naturalized citizen cadres dispatched from abroad, and the personal and family safety of local key personnel.

Finally, the Black Dragon Guild was divided into the Outer Squad and Inner Squad. The Outer Squad would consist of the original members. The Inner Squad would consist of newly recruited personnel, mostly desperados identified from the refugees. These people mostly had murder cases on their hands, all ruthless characters who wouldn't blink when killing or setting fires. Originally, such people were to be sent to Sanya to mine until death. The Political Security General Bureau had selected some of them for use as "death squads." Secretly controlled directly by Security Department cadres, they wouldn't be deployed in normal times but were specifically used for "wet work."

Regarding how to control these people who all had murder cases and were ruthless evildoers who wouldn't blink when killing or setting fires, the Council of Elders' Standing Committee had once raised questions about this. After all, these people were to be released for use. Once in a free environment, they probably couldn't be controlled at all. The naturalized citizen personnel and Elders using them might well suffer harm instead.

The response given by Wu Mu of the Political Security General Bureau at a secret hearing was: According to the report from the invited psychologist Jiang Qiuyan, after conducting comprehensive psychological tests on them using psychological test questions, hypnosis methods, and interviews, it was believed that some of them were still fundamentally good-natured and had taken the evil path due to certain unavoidable circumstances. These belonged to people who could be reformed and utilized at relatively low cost.

As for the other group, although considered difficult to reform or with excessively high reformation costs, they were very "usable." Therefore, the Political Security General Bureau, External Intelligence Bureau, Health People's Committee, and New Daoism cooperated to develop "pharmaceutical control" technical methods. This ensured their loyalty when carrying out external missions. For this purpose, he specially distributed an "after-reading-return" report to members of the Standing Committee.

"Outer Squad and Inner Squad easily brings to mind associations," Zhao Yingong put down the teacup and told Zhao Tong, who was listening attentively. "I think let's just call it the 'Sticky Pole Office.'"

"Master is right," Zhao Tong nodded and bowed. Although he didn't understand what strange meaning this bizarre name had, he would never ask too many questions.

"The housing for these people will all be your direct responsibility. Apart from you and a few of your subordinates, no one can know of their existence." Zhao Yingong stood up as he spoke, walked into the inner room, selected a key from his personal keys, and opened the safe embedded in the wall. From it, he took out a porcelain bottle.

He locked the safe, came out from the room, and handed the bottle to Zhao Tong.

"These medicines especially need to be handled carefully." Zhao Yingong instructed, "Apart from those few people, no one else can take them. You personally safeguard them. The whereabouts of every single pill must be registered."

"Yes! This humble one understands." Zhao Tong knew this was a secret of the Elders. As an Elder's bodyguard, he had far more contact with Elders than ordinary naturalized citizens. Unlike the worship and reverence of ordinary naturalized citizens, he deeply knew that numerous secrets were hidden behind the Council of Elders. This time, with the Chief giving such solemn instructions, there must be terrifying secrets contained within. He felt sweat on his back.

"Although we try our best not to have direct dealings with the Outer Squad, we still need to select a useful person to take control. The previous leader Huang Laosi recently died - dying was good. I originally didn't think this person was very suitable. Who do you think should be the head of the Black Dragon Guild?"

"Zhuang Haoren."

Zhao Yingong nodded. He knew this person: a man with a flat round face, jujube-pit head, tall build, with a pair of bright small eyes, figure-eight mustache, thin neck, and large head. He often came to Wanbi Bookshop to read books and chat with people about Wang Yangming's "School of Mind."

Zhuang Haoren was a typical local "broken boots party" member. Supposedly originally from a scholar family's offspring, when his family declined and studying didn't work out, he became a "loafer" and "hanger-on."

He had only joined the guild half a year ago. Although the guild was mostly street loafers, literate people were scarce in those times. Zhuang Haoren still had some status in the guild. People with more book learning had more schemes in their bellies, and he quickly became a "Mastermind" type figure.

Although Zhao Yingong hadn't chatted with him, he had heard reports. This person had limited fighting ability but knew much miscellaneous knowledge, deserving the title of "generalist." His social connections were extensive, with particularly familiar contacts in the pleasure quarters. He was a very good source of information. He was cunning but still had some bottom lines in his conduct and could be used.

"Can he command respect?" Zhao Yingong asked.

"In my humble opinion, if he can command respect naturally that's best. If he can't, it means he doesn't have the ability. Just replace him."

"Good, let him be the leader then. Treatment as before." Zhao Yingong nodded. "Have him pay more attention to news on the streets these days."

Zhao Tong saw he had nothing more to say and quickly withdrew.

Work on establishing the Star-Stepping Squad rapidly commenced. Zhao Yingong decided to set it at three hundred people temporarily - roughly the scale of one Public Security Army battalion. All selected from indentured servants among the refugees. The selection criteria were that they must have parents; those with wives and children were not wanted. Those with parents had attachments and were easy to control. Once a man had a wife and children, his courage weakened. So unless forced by wartime necessity, armies in all countries generally didn't want to conscript married men with children.

Like ordinary household servants, they wore azure straight robes and six-panel unity hats, but with black sashes at the waist for identification. Organized according to the National Army model, with centralized housing and military-style management. Stationed in platoons, squads, and teams as needed at various posts. When not on duty, they could also be used as organized labor force.

Because openly equipping them with swords and spears was too conspicuous in the relatively peaceful Jiangnan, although the Star-Stepping Squad learned to fight with swords and long spears, during daily training and duty they all only used long and short wooden staves. Additionally, they were equipped with large quantities of rattan helmets, prepared as protective equipment for any future organized brawls they might need to engage in.
