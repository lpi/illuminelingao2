# Chapter 1487 - Barter Trade

Based on the observed error, Hale made fine adjustments to the elevation and azimuth angles. The other cannons underwent similar corrections before being loaded with live ammunition.

"Mr. Paul, it seems this cannon is not as accurate as you claimed." Zheng Zhifeng observed through his telescope from the side, clearly dissatisfied with where the shell had landed. In truth, for cannons to achieve such precision at this range was already unprecedented in this era. The gap between these weapons and the Hongyipao the Zheng family had purchased at exorbitant prices from the English, the Portuguese in Macau, or the Greek merchants in Manila was staggering. Yet having witnessed the devastating power of Australian cannons firsthand, Hale's shooting seemed lackluster by comparison.

"This is called calibration firing," Hale explained. "In reality, after the first shell is fired, numerous factors—barrel temperature, operational technique, firing force, ballistic calculations, weather conditions—make it extraordinarily difficult to hit on the first shot. The purpose of calibration is to correct the artillery's firing data so that subsequent shells strike true." These technical terms, utterly foreign to Zheng Zhifeng, left him thunderstruck. For most Chinese of this period, firing a cannon meant little more than pointing the muzzle in the enemy's general direction and applying a slow match. As for gunnery as a science, few cared, and fewer still truly understood.

"Hitting the target on the first shot is either divine providence or guided fire..." Hale paused mid-sentence. Looking at Zheng Zhifeng's blank face and rolling eyes, he felt rather like casting pearls before swine. He continued: "General experience dictates that for reliable results, two test shots are needed to determine the bracketing error. From there, it becomes straightforward to compensate and correct the firing data. If one is familiar with both the site environment and the artillery's performance, a single test shot can suffice—as now."

Struggling to make sense of this flood of unfamiliar terminology, Zheng Zhifeng asked simply: "You mean you can definitely hit it now?"

A confident sneer crossed Hale's face. "Let us wait and see."

At his command, six cannons belched tongues of flame a *zhang* long, hurling shells from their barrels at speeds invisible to the naked eye toward the distant target. Through the telescope, several fireballs erupted atop the mound three or four seconds later, followed by thunder-like booms a few moments after that.

"Flowering shells?" Zheng Zhifeng sucked in a breath of cold air. Not only had most shells found their mark, but they were also the powerful exploding shells that could detonate on impact! So these were the legendary flowering shells used by the Australians? The power was indeed extraordinary—and rarer still was such accuracy!

Having witnessed firsthand the crushing devastation when Australian grenade fire scattered the fleet, Zheng Zhifeng held these weapons in the highest regard—though he harbored no illusions about obtaining such "weapons of mass destruction" from Hale.

European grenades had already reached China in the late Ming, but limited by the technical capabilities of the era, their power was largely negligible, playing no significant role in either land or sea battles and thus earning little respect. Only after the Australians introduced grenades filled with high-density black powder had flowering shells become truly feared.

"Correct—grenades, or flowering shells," Hale said. "Though their power is limited in land battles, at sea, once a wooden ship is struck, the effect far exceeds that of dozens of solid shots."

"Mr. Feng, are you satisfied with this shipment?" A slight smile played on Hale's lips, though his voice remained cold.

"Very satisfied. You never break your promise, Paul." Zheng Zhifeng returned from shock and fantasy to reality.

"And our transaction?"

"Not a penny less. I, Zheng, have also said—as long as your goods are good, your silver won't be a cent short." He signaled his men, who brought forward two large chests filled with gleaming white silver. A sharp light suddenly kindled in Hale's eyes. He ran slender fingers across the metal, savoring its cold texture, then closed the lid and had the chests carried away. "According to our previous agreement: for the six cannons, large and small, besides corresponding solid shot, each comes with twenty explosive flowering shells. I will leave the firing tables and train whichever gunners you send until they have mastered the techniques."

"A pity it's so few."

Zheng Zhifeng made quick calculations. If he mounted such cannons on his newly built three-masted great ships, how would the situation change? Forget facing the Zheng Cai brothers or Liu Xiang's Fujian and Guangzhou vessels—even the great galleons of the Macau Red-haired barbarians would be blasted to ashes! Though Australian ships could sail without wind, possessing such cannons would at least allow him to fight on relatively equal terms, rather than being reduced to live targets bobbing helplessly on the sea.

After Operation Starvation, Zheng Zhifeng had reorganized his remnant ships and rushed to build large Fujian-style vessels using aged timber to fill the gap in his trade fleet. Simultaneously, he reestablished a shipyard on Kinmen Island, purchasing dried timber at premium prices to begin construction of new purpose-built warships. The prototypes for these vessels were the unfinished improved Fujian ships Xu Ke had discovered in the new Zhongzuosuo shipyard—ships representing local shipwrights' attempts to incorporate European naval advantages.

Hale seemed to read his thoughts. He sneered: "Forgive my bluntness. If you continue installing these cannons I provide onto those wooden boxes of yours, you still won't be a match for the Australians."

Zheng Zhifeng was shaken. Though he wanted to refute Hale, the memory of his fleet's total destruction in Weitou Bay left him speechless. With difficulty, he managed:

"We also have a few Red-haired barbarian ships, yet still we were no match for the Australians..."

"Those ships suffered from inferior cannons. With my cannons installed, you can at least maneuver against the Australians for a time. As for your wooden boxes—I advise you to stop building them. Tearing them down for firewood would be more profitable."

"You mean?"

"Those Chinese ships you build—whatever you call them—I have observed carefully. Perhaps serviceable as trade vessels, but wholly unsuitable as warships. They lack proper decks. Their center of gravity sits too high. Cannons are difficult to arrange effectively. Your ships can mount only three or four large guns at most. They cannot concentrate the power of a broadside salvo."

"To build Western ships, I lack artisans versed in Western shipbuilding," Zheng Zhifeng replied. "I have timber enough and artisans aplenty—building ten ships simultaneously poses no problem."

"What did you think of the two-masted ships in Manila harbor?"

"Very fine. But don't you think them too small?"

"When the Australian fleet attacked Zhangzhou Bay, most of their vessels were such light, fast craft. Compared to your wooden boxes, they are certainly smaller. But their speed is remarkable—enough to rival Australian patrol ships. And four large cannons can be mounted on their compact hulls." Hale made a gesture; a Tagalog servant brought a glass of red wine. "You have seen the Australian patrol ships."

"Yes. But they are powerless against the Australian great fast ships..."

"You need not worry about that. Whenever you are ready, I will soon build larger warships, sufficient to rival them. Naturally, those too will be available for purchase," Hale said calmly.

Zheng Zhifeng's eyes lit up—though he quickly realized this might be nothing more than an empty promise to keep him hoping. Even so, those light craft equipped with Hale's cannons could at least play a useful role.

"Then what price must I pay?"

Hale laughed. "You truly are a first-rate businessman." He set down his empty wine glass. "Will your Anhai ships continue sailing to Manila?"

"If I'm not mistaken, your nephew Zheng Sen and the Zheng Cai brothers will also dispatch ships to Manila—after all, this remains your largest surviving trade channel."

"There is also Japan."

"Unless you send a fleet to Japan to uproot Australian power there, I see no advantage you possess in the Japan trade. But setting that aside—I suspect you would be quite willing to monopolize the Manila trade. At the very least, to exclude those tiresome relatives."

Zheng Zhifeng's eyes widened. If he could cut these two competitors out of the Manila trade, the Zheng Lian and Zheng Cai brothers, along with Zheng Sen, would lose their financial lifelines and decline rapidly. Finishing them off afterward would be child's play.

"Your conditions are...?"

"You must send sufficient ships to Manila. During the trading season, at least four or five Anhai ships should arrive monthly—the more, the better."

"How is that possible?" Zheng Zhifeng shook his head, interrupting. "The Spaniards don't have enough silver to purchase my goods."

"The Spaniards may not, but I have large cannons—and perhaps warships in the future."

"You mean—" Zheng Zhifeng's voice rose in shock. "I can directly use goods to offset the value of ships and cannons?"

"Precisely," Hale said. "Of course, which specific goods qualify for credit will be determined by me."

"As long as they're not too obscure."

"Rest assured—everything I want is readily available." Hale pulled a page from his pocket. "Here is the specific commodity list."

Zheng Zhifeng took it. The goods listed were indeed common items—over a hundred in total, some of which even he didn't recognize. Most important were pig iron, copper, lead, mercury, and various other metals.

"These items aren't difficult to obtain. But they're all cold goods—you won't fetch a good price selling them afterward..."

"Hehe, my dear friend. Your thinking is that of a merchant through and through." Hale laughed. "You need not concern yourself with my finances. The more goods you provide, the more weapons and ships I can supply you. Naturally, you remain free to ship and sell silk, porcelain, and sundries as you please."

"Good—it's a deal!"

"Finally, I require more population. They can also count as a form of goods."

"Population?" Zheng Zhifeng hesitated. "Surely you know the Spaniards are deeply suspicious of Chinese immigrants?"

The Spanish throughout their Philippine colonial history had maintained an attitude of suspicion tempered by grudging necessity toward Chinese immigration. And this period lay only a few decades removed from the so-called "Chinese Uprising" of the Wanli era.
