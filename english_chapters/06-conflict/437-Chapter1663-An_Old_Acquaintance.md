# Chapter 1663 - An Old Acquaintance

As she spoke, she hurriedly handed over the promissory note, smiling ingratiatingly: "It's all this old woman's dim eyes that ate..."

Lin Ming took the note and laughed: "Your eyes are quite sharp. I just dropped a Delong note, and didn't you pick it up for me?"

The madam gave a forced laugh: "Yes, yes." A thousand reservations, ten thousand reluctances, yet she handed back the note in her hand. Lin Ming took it, glanced at it, and said: "Looks like it's the wrong one. Mine was for five hundred taels..."

The madam nearly collapsed. She was on the verge of kneeling down to beg. Lin Ming finally relented with a smile: "I was mistaken—it is this one. Off you go."

As if pardoned from death, the madam scrambled away.

Lin Ming helped the woman to her feet and said: "Hurry and pack your things. Here are five taels of silver. Tomorrow, find a boat—doesn't matter where—go and seek out family or friends. Leave this place as quickly as you can..." The woman's tears fell like a broken string of pearls. She knelt down and said softly: "Yes... Thank... thank you, my lord, for your kindness. This humble servant will never forget it to her dying day..."

Just then, the moonlight fell upon her face. Lin Ming started and blurted out: "Su... Auntie Su!"

Kang Mingsi was startled. The woman's whole body trembled. She slowly raised her head and glanced at them, then quickly lowered it again and said: "My lord has mistaken me for someone else..."

Kang Mingsi studied her carefully. He saw that she wore a blue floral-patterned cotton jacket and a water-pink silk skirt that covered her bound feet—truly no more than three inches long. Her black hair was loosely coiled in a Suzhou bun, trailing half over her shoulder. Her pale melon-seed face bore two dark brows like smoke veiling jade. Kang Mingsi found himself somewhat dazed. No wonder Elder Mei was so obsessed with the "Eight Beauties of Qinhuai"—her appearance was one thing, but this gentle, delicate bearing had its own special charm!

"Auntie Su!" Lin Ming was astonished. Before him was a woman with a pair of shallow dimples at the corners of her mouth, slightly furrowed brows, and a small mole beside her right cheek. She still bore her old grace and charm. Who could it be but Su Ai, the concubine of Gao Shunqin!

Speaking of Su Ai, she was truly an old acquaintance of his. Back when Gao Shunqin had disappeared, Lin Ming had been entrusted to investigate the case—and Su Ai had been one of the suspects. Gao's first wife had secretly bribed him with several hundred taels of silver, wanting him to torture Su Ai into a false confession, either making her a "co-conspirator" or at least beating her half to death. Fortunately, Su Ai had understood what was good for her, offering up her private savings to bribe him. Lin Ming had always been tender-hearted toward women, and so he had stayed his hand and spared her the worst. The two of them could be said to have some history between them.

Gao Shunqin's case had become a cold case. Lin Ming had papered over matters for the Guangdong officialdom, gaining both silver and goodwill. Naturally, he had not inquired further into Su Ai's whereabouts. To think that three years later, the two would meet again in such circumstances!

Truly, the world was full of vicissitudes and unpredictable changes! Lin Ming's face turned deathly pale in an instant. The past events flashed through his mind with vivid clarity—taking his sister-in-law to work on the case, the night interrogation of "suspects" at the Gao residence, following clues all the way to Macau, his sister-in-law's disappearance... It was all so clear, yet also like a fog, a blank—he could recall nothing distinctly. Such strange, fantastical twists of fate. Su Ai had been nothing more than a passing figure in his life, yet his subsequent experiences had been deeply connected to this woman. And now, here they met again...

He stared at her face, struggling to suppress the myriad emotions within him, and said: "I am Lin Ming, a probationary centurion of the Jinyiwei..."

Su Ai seemed like a sleepwalker, gazing at him with dull, lifeless eyes. Then, as if pricked by a needle, she crumpled to the ground on her knees. Covering her face with both hands, she broke into loud sobs, her whole body shaking and trembling, tears streaming through her fingers.

This commotion roused the residents of the courtyard. Guests in the other rooms peered out through windows, and curious idlers poked their heads out to gossip in whispers. Lin Ming hastened to say: "Auntie Su! Our meeting here must be fate. This is no place to talk. Gather yourself, and let's find somewhere else!"

Kang Mingsi watched in bewilderment, his head spinning from their tears. Like a fool, he stood to one side listening to Lin Ming speak. Then he snapped back to reality—this was unfamiliar territory, and it was the middle of the night. What kind of spectacle were they making? He quickly said: "Let's go back to the boat to talk." Then he instructed the escort: "Pick up the things on the ground. Lock up the room here."

Lin Ming was at a bit of a loss. On the salt boat, he was not the master. There was no way he could presumptuously bring a woman back. Though Zhaoqing had acquaintances, in the dead of night there was no way to disturb anyone in the city. Kang Mingsi's words saved him. He hastened to say: "Master Kang is right. Whatever needs to be said, let's say it back on the boat!"

When they returned to the boat, Suo Pu was rather surprised. Lin Ming recounted the whole story. Suo Pu thought this was quite a coincidence—meeting an old acquaintance! He had read the Guangzhou Station's reports and knew of the relationship between Su Ai and Pei Lixiu. At the time, he had treated it as idle gossip and given it little thought. To think that one of the story's protagonists would appear before his very eyes.

However, this actually dispelled some of his suspicions. He smiled: "In that case, let's help Buddha all the way to the West. But having her travel upstream with us would cause too many inconveniences. Tomorrow, send two escorts to take her to Guangzhou and hand her over to Pei Lixiu."

At the mention of "Pei Lixiu," Su Ai's shoulders heaved and tears rolled down her face. Suo Pu saw her haggard expression and immediately called for someone to bring washing water. He added: "It looks like she hasn't eaten. Get her some food!"

"Thank you, sirs. I'm not hungry—please don't trouble yourselves." Su Ai seemed to have just recovered from a serious illness. Her body trembled weakly. She managed a curtsy with difficulty. "You gentlemen are strangers passing by, yet you have saved this humble servant from fire and water. I would serve you as an ox or horse..."

Lin Ming said: "What are you saying such things for now? I can see you look as if you've just recovered from illness. Hurry and sit down to rest. These two lords are not outsiders! Please don't stand on ceremony."

Su Ai sat down on the bench by the cabin wall. It felt as though she had just woken from a great dream. This man, with whom she had scarcely any real connection, had suddenly appeared here and pulled her from the pit of fire... The workings of fate were truly beyond words.

Lin Ming asked: "Auntie Su, after the case was closed, why didn't you return to the Gao household? And how did you end up in this situation?"

Su Ai shook her head slowly: "Lord Lin, the case was closed, as you well know. But the Gao family would not accept me. After the master's disappearance, they nearly had me killed. I had no son or daughter to rely upon. Even if they had let me return, I wouldn't have dared go back. The private savings I had accumulated over the years were never recovered. Fortunately, I still had some money on my person, so I went to stay with an old friend—a fellow sister."

Her savings were limited, after all—she couldn't live on them forever. She had been trained as a "thin-horse" courtesan since childhood and knew no trade. As she grew older, she was unwilling to return to the entertainment trade. So, through the introduction of a friend from her past, she became a concubine to a merchant from Zhaoqing—and thus came to this city.

"Why didn't you go to Pei Lixiu when that happened? Given your friendship with her, whether it was finding you a position at Ziming Tower or giving you travel money to return to South Zhili, neither would have been difficult." Suo Pu suddenly asked.

"Is this gentleman also an acquaintance of Miss Pei?" Su Ai said faintly. "I did want to find her. But at that time, the Australians and the court were at war. Ziming Tower was sealed by the authorities, and Miss Pei's whereabouts were unknown. Some said she had fled back to Australia; others said she had been taken by some high official in the capital."

She had now calmed down, though occasional tremors of grief still colored her voice as she spoke: "I suspect I was born under an ill star. When I was small, I brought death to my parents. After much hardship, I escaped from the entertainment world and entered the Gao household, only to bring death upon Master Gao. Then I came to Zhaoqing. I hadn't enjoyed many peaceful days before I brought death upon my second husband as well... I've been with two men, yet I have no children to rely upon, no support at all..."

At this point, tears were streaming unceasingly down her face. Everyone present sighed in sympathy.

"...No sooner had my lord been in the ground for the first seven days than the first wife came to throw me out. I begged her to at least wait until the burial and the end of the mourning period. I said I would naturally take my things and leave. The first wife said: 'You were never part of our family—just a plaything we bought. By not selling you off, we're already showing you heaven's mercy.' She drove me out on the spot! Without a care in the world, she barged into my room like a bandit and took every last thing I had—my savings, my clothes, anything she could carry—and threw me out into the street..."

Su Ai's grief overwhelmed her again, and tears welled up in her eyes. She choked back sobs for a long while before continuing: "It was the dead of winter, with a bitter wind blowing. I didn't know where to go. I stood by the river, looking at the water. At that moment, I truly felt there was no way forward and no way back—I thought I might as well jump in and end it all. Fortunately, some kindhearted soul saw me and talked me down from the edge, or I'd have taken the road to oblivion. I'd hidden a bit of silver and jewelry on my person, so at least I didn't become a starving corpse. I wanted to return to Guangzhou, but without a man to accompany me and without travel money, I could only take up this trade again here..."

Suo Pu had not felt much sympathy for her at first. He thought that falling into the world of entertainment was one thing, but becoming a concubine twice—though there might be "no choice" in the matter—was really no different from her twenty-first-century counterparts who were simply lazy and unwilling to work. But putting himself in her shoes now, her circumstances were quite different from those in the other time-space. In the seventeenth century, where was there any place for a lone woman to stand? When he thought about it, there were simply too many "no choices." He sighed:

"Now that you've encountered Lord Lin, I don't think you need to eat this bowl of rice any longer. Tomorrow, we'll send you back to Guangzhou. Go and seek out Pei Lixiu. Ziming Tower's business is bigger than ever now. Once you're there, they'll find you some sort of work—better than trading on your looks. How many more years can you keep that up?"

Seeing the doubt in Su Ai's eyes, Lin Ming hastened to introduce him: "This is Master Suo. He is my... hmm... superior... Master Suo heard your weeping, and out of the kindness of his heart, he sent me to look into it. That's how today's strange reunion came about."

Su Ai sank to her knees and said between sobs: "Master Suo must surely be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva... May Heaven bless you with descendants, prosperity, noble rank, and ten thousand generations..."

Suo Pu thought to himself that Lin Ming certainly knew how to play his cards! But the words were pleasant enough to hear. He raised his hand slightly: "No need for such formality. Very well then—I'll send two escorts to accompany you back to the temple lodging to collect your luggage. Rest there tonight, settle your room charges tomorrow morning, and then come back here for further arrangements."
