# Chapter 1590 - Parting

That evening, the sunset glow gradually faded, and the new moon first rose.

Zhuo Yifan met Sima Qiudao again today: Sima Qiudao took out a new letter from Old Man Shi again. After reading it, Zhuo Yifan was very annoyed. Even Sima Qiudao felt that Old Man Shi was a bit too much.

However, since he shouldered a heavy responsibility and was in unpredictable danger, he couldn't think of any clever plan, so he could only act according to Old Man Shi's arrangement.

It was just that this acting by drifting with the current, although having "unavoidable" points, was completely contrary to the concepts he adhered to on ordinary days, making his mood annoyed. After dinner, he came out of the inn alone to relax.

Originally he just wanted to walk alone to calm down, but guided by ghosts and gods, he came near the East Gate Police Station again.

In order to gather news these days, he interacted very frequently with Lian Nishang. Although they didn't agree with each other's ideas, after a long time, the two faintly developed feelings.

Since they were going to take action in these few days, Zhuo Yifan didn't come to see her. Unexpectedly, walking casually, he walked here again.

Looking at the police carriage in front of the East Gate Police Station, he couldn't help laughing at himself: he was also acting like a young lover. Lian Nishang probably got off work and went back long ago, yet he still came here foolishly.

Thinking that once action was taken tomorrow, he and Lian Nishang would be enemies. Regardless of whether they met face to face, it would be difficult to meet again in this life. Thinking of this, he felt unconsciously heartbroken. He had seen many martial arts women in the past, with different backgrounds, but none could plant a mark in his heart like Lian Nishang.

He intended to bid farewell to her, but worried about accidentally leaking the details, so he could only harden his heart not to look for Lian Nishang again.

Just as he was about to turn and leave, suddenly someone shouted: "Yifan!"

Zhuo Yifan was stunned. This voice was exactly Lian Nishang's. Looking back, Lian Nishang had changed into a casual skirt outfit. Her originally capable short hair was now slightly longer, clipped with a black hairpin decorated with broken diamonds, gleaming faintly under the street lamp.

It could be seen that she was much more particular than her previous casual attire. Zhuo Yifan naturally knew the principle of "a woman dresses for the one who pleases her", only now he couldn't help feeling slightly sour.

Zhuo Yifan and Lian Nishang walked slowly side by side, from the police station towards the river embankment. They often walked and chatted in this area.

Zhuo Yifan drank Kvass, ate ice cream, ate skewers for the first time... all in this area. Strolling along, the familiar street scenery made him feel extremely melancholy.

Lian Nishang leaned against Zhuo Yifan, glance flowing. Suddenly she brushed her cloud-like temple hair, hesitating to speak. Zhuo Yifan felt her breath like orchid, his heart and soul swaying, and hurriedly avoided.

Lian Nishang laughed: "Are you still afraid of me now?"

Zhuo Yifan said: "I don't know why you want to make others afraid of you?"

Lian Nishang said: "Didn't you say I was cultivated by Australians? I didn't set my heart to make people afraid of me. Roughly it's because I don't follow Great Ming's rules, so you are afraid of me." Zhuo Yifan suddenly sighed, thinking that Lian Nishang was beautiful and intelligent, like natural fine jade, unfortunately no one led her into the "Right Path".

Lian Nishang asked: "Why do you sigh for no reason?"

Zhuo Yifan said: "With your ability and agility, why serve under Australians?"

Lian Nishang's face changed, saying: "What's bad about Australians? Lingao is always much cleaner than Great Ming!"

Zhuo Yifan lowered his head and said nothing. Lian Nishang said again: "Your appearance today is very wrong, looking like you are full of worries. Is there something matter?"

Zhuo Yifan knew he couldn't hide it, so he said: "I received a letter from home, I'm going back to the mainland."

Lian Nishang frowned slightly: "Didn't your whole family move here? Why go back again?"

"I came here to settle my mother down. My father is still an official on the mainland, naturally I have to go back." Zhuo Yifan said according to the pre-prepared script.

Lian Nishang was silent for a long time, then asked: "Will you come back?"

"Don't know..." Zhuo Yifan was upset. Obviously full of lies, yet speaking them as truth. He couldn't help saying to himself secretly: Zhuo Yifan, ah Zhuo Yifan, didn't expect you to enter the drama so deeply!

"Is this place not good? Why go back."

"Although this place is good, it is not the native land." Zhuo Yifan also felt that Lingao was good everywhere, worthy of being called "paradise on earth", no wonder rich people would rather suffer the harsh treatment of Bandits to move here. However, this paradise made him feel very strange and fearful. What the Bandits built in Lingao was a world he was completely unfamiliar with and could not understand.

Those common people who only knew about eating full and dressing warm naturally wouldn't care, but he knew what the real purpose of this gang of Bandits was.

Not changing dynasties, not being emperors, it was changing Xia with Yi!

"What do you plan to do in the future? Do you still want to be an official, like your father, selling life to the Emperor Old Man to be an official?"

Although the reason for going back was fabricated, Zhuo Yifan's father was indeed a "Court Official". Hearing Lian Nishang speak like this, he couldn't help feeling a little angry: "Being an official is not something just anyone can be. I don't have this ability."

Lian Nishang sneered: "I think being an official in Great Ming is easiest. Just bully and squeeze the poor and coax the Emperor happy."

Zhuo Yifan shook his head: "Your words are excessive. Among officials, there are also true great sages worrying about the country and the people..."

Lian Nishang sneered: "Even if there are, they are really pitifully few. As the saying goes, he who touches pitch shall be defiled. Can those who survive in there be any good people?"

Zhuo Yifan said resolutely: "I will never be an official in this life, but I won't be a robber or thief either."

Lian Nishang was extremely angry in her heart. If the person who said this was not Zhuo Yifan, she would have swept him away with a palm long ago. She sneered: "Is your father not a robber?"

Zhuo Yifan said angrily: "How could they be robbers?"

Lian Nishang said: "Officials rob the poor to help the rich, Chiefs rob the rich to help the poor, both are robbers! But our kind of robber is much better than your kind of robber!"

Lian Nishang paused and said: "My father was a Confucian scholar with some thin land, making a living by teaching and farming. Unexpectedly, the local powerful family fancied my family's land and also wanted to lay fingers on me. They colluded with the government and schemed my family's land away. My father had an upright character and was angered to death. I wandered to Guangzhou Prefecture with my old mother. Happening to meet the Chief doing charity in Guangzhou, my whole family was taken in. Even the name Nishang was given by the Chief. For my maverick personality, there are still Chiefs willing to take me as a constable. Life now is much better than in Great Ming."

Zhuo Yifan said: "I have also heard about unworthy officials harming people, however, after all, there are only a few. The current Emperor makes great efforts to govern..."

Lian Nishang sneered: "A few? Just look at the poor people from all over the world coming to Lingao, what they have encountered! Which one didn't crawl out of the eighteen layers of hell."

Zhuo Yifan said: "Fine, say what you want! But everyone has their own aspirations, no need to force each other!"

Lian Nishang's body trembled slightly, extremely sad. Zhuo Yifan saw her eye rims slightly red, tears about to drop. A feeling of pity arose spontaneously. He couldn't help holding her fingers gently, saying: "Although our aspirations may be different, friendship will always be there."

Lian Nishang asked sadly: "When do you leave?"

Zhuo Yifan said: "Tomorrow!"

Nishang sighed and spoke no more. After a long time, Zhuo Yifan changed the subject, asking Lian Nishang to talk about anecdotes in Lingao, and he also talked about the scenery of the Capital. The two walked and chatted under the moon like old friends. Although everyone dared not reveal the depths of their souls, they understood each other much better than before. They talked until late at night. Seeing it was nearly ten o'clock, Zhuo Yifan bid farewell to Lian Nishang. Lian Nishang knew his will to go was very firm and didn't stop him. At the moment, they bade each other take care and parted with tears.

"This situation is a hundred times more complicated than we expected." Li Yayang stood anxiously in the "East Gate Market Emergency Situation Countermeasure Headquarters" on the top floor of the "Fire Prevention Command Tower", looking at the surging crowd towards the gymnasium outside the large glass window, "Today is not a rest day. Why are there so many idlers?"

This five-story tower, mainly made of red bricks and bordered with stone strips, was 30 meters high. It was the tallest building in the entire East Gate Market and Lingao County. Sitting in a nearly central position, its main purpose was to conduct 24-hour fire and public security lookout for the entire East Gate Market. Reporting and resource allocation were carried out through telephone, light, and semaphore signals. It could be called the public security center of the entire East Gate Market.

"You forgot that most naturalized citizens and indigenous people don't rest on Sunday, but on the 1st and 15th of each month." Mu Min leaned over the large-caliber telescope observing the distant street and said, "Today happens to be the 15th. Many enterprises are on holiday. Besides, commercial enterprises implement rotation rest themselves."

"The crowd pouring into the warning zone has exceeded ten thousand. The streets where the number of people approaches the warning line are Gymnasium Avenue, Competition Street, Friendship Street, and Championship Street."

With the communicator reporting the latest crowd monitoring situation, a police officer operating on a transparent glass chart marked out orange markers.

"What to do, this event hasn't started yet. Far exceeded expectations." Li Yayang had already started wiping sweat. His Garrison Battalion had canceled all leave. Except for the sick who couldn't move, even the cooking squad went out on duty.

The strength of the Garrison Battalion under his command was only "enough" on ordinary days—this "enough" even had to add the National Army Company and Public Security Army Company under the command of the Garrison Command—there was not much surplus force. In recent years, with the increasing number of Senator dispatches and business trips, a large number of personnel in the Guard Company of the Garrison Battalion were "precipitated" in "business trip duty". The personnel in the camp were less than 50 percent of the authorized strength. Causing a serious shortage of guards for Senators. This time a large number of Senators went out for activities, he had to temporarily transfer personnel from the Garrison Company to guard posts.

The selection of soldiers for the Guard Company was the strictest, with many hard bars and rules. The military and political quality of the Garrison Company was not so high. Li Yayang had been worried about mistakes. But he couldn't use Public Security Army personnel who couldn't even speak Mandarin fluently to serve as guards for Senators.
