# Chapter 1573 - Sailing

"So you just let her be?"

"Ziqi, she doesn't understand. She doesn't know how the Senator seats and property actually work. I can't be bothered to educate her—why bother? Anyway, Dad is a Senator and I am a Senator. My family was penniless when we crossed over. Apart from the basic shares every Senator has, we don't have any extra. Even if her son becomes a Senator in the future, all he can inherit is Dad's share. Mine is still mine. She can't get it."

"But—"

"Ziqi, I'll be eighteen next year. Once I'm eighteen, the General Office can arrange separate housing for me, and I'll move out and live alone. Out of sight, out of mind. Without me, this 'eyesore,' she'll think all the property and seats will belong to her son in the future, and naturally she won't make a fuss."

"Isn't that too stifling for you? Why did we work so hard to come here? Wasn't it to live freely and change our lives?" Lin Ziqi disapproved.

Zhang Yunmi lowered her head. "Ziqi, I'm different from you. Although your father has a maid, he has no other children. My father now has two more. Do you understand? Sooner or later, I will no longer be part of the Zhang family."

These words shocked Lin Ziqi. In an instant, she completely understood what Zhang Yunmi meant. To deal with Yunyu would only take a word from Yunmi's father. Suddenly, she understood the saying: *With a stepmother comes a stepfather.*

"Your father, really..." She clenched her fist, nearly saying the word *scum*. "That's too much!"

Zhang Yunmi shook her head. "I don't think so. Dad has to consider my younger brother and sister, so he's in a difficult position too. If he were like some Senators—treating children as a byproduct of seeking pleasure, killing the maid, and not caring about the children at all—it would be easy. But such a person would be too cold-blooded, right? He has his life..."

"Yunmi, you are too kind..." Lin Ziqi was about to cry and hugged her tight. "Come live at my house."

"No, no," Zhang Yunmi hurriedly pushed her. "What would that look like?"

"No!"

"I usually live in the dormitory and only go home for a few days a year..." Zhang Yunmi was hugged so tightly she couldn't breathe. "Okay, dear, let go..."

Qian Duoduo turned her head just then and immediately shouted: "What are you two doing hugging and cuddling?"

"We're having an affair—can't you tell?" Lin Ziqi raised her head and declared loudly.

"Me too!" Qian Duoduo's childish temper flared, and she pounced over, burrowing into Zhang Yunmi's arms. The *Xiaocang* immediately rocked violently, causing Lin Ziqi and Zhang Yunmi to scream.

The *Xiaocang* sailed slowly along the coastline. The Qiongzhou Strait was an absolute security zone with a permit transit system. Although many ships passed through, there was no need to worry about safety, and patrol boats skimmed across the water from time to time. The girls sailed and chattered nonstop. When they were hungry, they took out the sandwiches made by Ai Beibei; when thirsty, there was cold and delicious kvass hanging in the sea to cool. The sky was high, the clouds light, the breeze gentle, the waves calm, and the sea scenery picturesque. They wished this voyage would never end...

Lin Ziqi asked Qian Duoduo: "Why is this small boat called *Xiaocang*? It sounds like a Japanese name."

"To be precise, it's a Japanese place name," Qian Duoduo nodded.

"Then why?"

"Dr. Zhong named it. It's said to commemorate a novel he once wrote." Qian Duoduo said. "I asked him for a lot of advice on shipbuilding this time. I had no way to repay him, so I let him be the 'Godmother'—no, 'Godfather.'"

"Dr. Zhong has written novels?" Lin Ziqi was somewhat surprised. In her eyes, Dr. Zhong was a typical "mad scientist" or "tech otaku," completely unrelated to literary things like writing novels.

"Dr. Zhong is multi-talented and can do anything." Zhong Xiaoying interjected, her eyes shining with adoration. She let out a deep sigh of utter girlish infatuation and muttered to herself: "I really want to have his baby..."

A burst of laughter erupted from the girls on the boat, so loud that even the seagulls were startled and flew around squawking.

Lin Ziqi clutched her stomach. "You *can* have his baby. Anyway, you're not biologically... related."

Zhong Xiaoying blushed and said after a long while: "The Doctor said that's not allowed. He doesn't want to be a 'Ghost Father'..."

Now the laughter grew even more intense. Qian Duoduo laughed until she rolled on the cabin floor, and Zhang Yunmi laughed until she went limp. Only Sonia stared at them blankly, not understanding why.

The laughter continued for a while before Qian Duoduo crawled up from the cabin floor, wiped her tears, and gasped: "Xiaoying, you can't say these things casually in front of others—especially 'Ghost Father.' Otherwise, people will think..." Before she finished, she laughed again involuntarily. This time she couldn't stand anymore and squatted down weakly.

Lin Ziqi smiled and said: "Duoduo is right. That's not a good term." Thinking about the expression on Dr. Zhong's face when he'd said those words to Zhong Xiaoying, Lin Ziqi couldn't help smiling and almost burst out laughing again.

Zhong Xiaoying nodded in confusion. At this point, Lin Ziqi asked Qian Duoduo: "Duoduo, you're a primary school student. How do you know about 'Ghost Father'? Speak! Speak! Speak!"

Qian Duoduo tilted her head. "I know it the same way you know it. Don't pretend to be a white lotus!"

"Tch, you minor..."

Qian Duoduo hated others making fun of her age more than anything. Just as she was about to retort, Zhang Yunmi spoke: "Duoduo, what about that girl who always plays with you? I haven't seen her much recently. I saw you rowing with her last time."

"You mean Xiaoquan?" Qian Duoduo said. "Her grades are too poor to get into the selection group. Originally, she always came to my house to play, but somehow, she rarely comes anymore."

Zhang Yunmi said: "Doesn't her mother work at the General Hospital? Let your mom ask directly."

Lin Ziqi interjected: "Dr. Ai is so busy with work—it would be strange if she remembered. You might as well ask at the General Hospital yourself."

"That would make it too big a deal. Should I ask as a friend or as a Senator making an inquiry? If she doesn't want to play with me for her own reasons, and I ask like this, what if her mother goes back and beats her without asking why? Forget it—if she wants to go, let her go..."

These words were spoken with an air of maturity beyond her years, though slightly misused, making the others laugh again. Lin Ziqi asked: "Why would her mother beat her? Isn't it a child's own business who she gets along with?"

Qian Duoduo sighed affectedly and shook her head. "Student Ziqi, you are really naive! Who are you? Who are we?"

Without waiting for Lin Ziqi to answer, she answered herself: "We are Senators! Although we don't have voting rights yet, we are genuine 1/513ths. How many naturalized citizens and indigenous people in Lingao dream of currying favor with Senators but have no chance? If Li Quan refuses to come play with me for her own reasons, her mother will definitely beat her to death if she finds out."

Zhang Yunmi nodded. "Duoduo makes sense."

Qian Duoduo said: "Didn't the teacher say in the last history class? 'When the Son of Heaven is angry, corpses lay in millions and blood flows like a river.' Also: 'The King of Chu loved narrow waists, so many people in the palace starved to death.' Although we are not emperors, our words and deeds affect many people. Everything must be done with caution."

Lin Ziqi felt a bit bored. She disliked hearing these grand principles about heaven and human relations—so old-fashioned. Just as she was about to change the subject, the ringing of a PHS phone suddenly startled her. There wasn't a single PHS in the entire Senate with a battery that could still work independently. All PHS units now relied on external batteries to maintain call capability—that is to say, portability had been completely lost.

Qian Duoduo hurriedly squatted down, opened the cabin door, pulled out a sealed drawer from inside, and lifted the lid. Inside sat a PHS, mounted on a special rack and connected by wires to a battery as thick as a dictionary, fixed to the bottom plate.

This was also Dr. Zhong's creative idea. It gave the *Xiaocang* real-time communication capabilities. Although the PHS had a limited calling range, the *Xiaocang*'s sailing range was also small, so this was enough for emergencies.

She answered the phone: "This is Bopu Port, *Xiaocang*. I am Captain Qian Duoduo."

"I am Dongmen Chuiyu," the voice in the receiver was clear and loud. "Is Zhang Yunmi on your boat?"

"Yes. Let me put her on."

Zhang Yunmi seemed to know Dongmen Chuiyu would be looking for her. She answered the phone without showing surprise:

"I am Zhang Yunmi..."

"Yunmi. Old Wu, Little Zhang, Little Huang, Yuan Ziguang and I just watched the first rehearsal of the Four Seasons. We feel it's not ideal. The Center position obviously lacks momentum. So we discussed it, and for this performance, it's better if you stand at the 0 position."

"Well, speaking of dance skills, I'm a blank slate too." It was clear she was a little nervous. "Besides, if I become the Center, it will affect everyone's morale—they'll feel there's no hope for advancement in the future."

"It doesn't matter. For the first performance, we have to give them a clear example. To be honest, the temperament of these girls is still a bit off. Besides, you represent the image of the Senate."

"That's true, but..." Zhang Yunmi was still hesitant.

"It doesn't matter, just go for it." Dongmen Chuiyu's voice was confident. "Show them how it's done."

"Okay." Zhang Yunmi agreed, but her tone wasn't very confident.

Qian Duoduo asked: "Yunmi, you're going to dance at this Cultural Festival? Have you practiced dancing?"

"No." Zhang Yunmi shook her head. "You know the situation at my house—how could they send me to dance?"

"Then you're still going to dance?" Qian Duoduo was confused. She had a somewhat professional mindset, thinking: *How could one dance without learning?*

"It doesn't matter. IDOL dancing is very easy," Zhang Yunmi said.
