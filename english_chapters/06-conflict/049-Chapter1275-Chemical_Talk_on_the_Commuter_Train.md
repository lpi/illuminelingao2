# Chapter 1275: Chemical Talk on the Commuter Train

"Of course, of course." A knowing expression appeared on Wu Nanhai's face.

After the brief and solemn opening ceremony, Ma Qianzhu symbolically pulled down the feeding switch. The prepared two-thousand-string firecrackers immediately rang out. Accompanied by the cheers of the crowd, the ceremony ended. There were no students from Fangcaodi to cheer, nor were there banquets or other content to display "atmosphere".

Recently, the General Office of the Senate issued a notice on "Practicing strict economy and opposing extravagance and waste", requiring all departments and Senators to minimize unnecessary celebration ceremonies and reduce official entertainment expenses, so the scene was much smaller. However, the customary tour after the opening ceremony was indispensable.

Visiting and studying was the most effective means of brainwashing, so the Senate would not let go of any such great opportunity. This batch of Tiandihui customers had already tried chemical fertilizer in small quantities and had long experienced the magical effect of this "field-fattening powder". Hearing that this factory specialized in producing "field-fattening powder", they all wanted to see how this field-fattening powder was actually made. One by one, full of interest, they followed Ji Tuisie to visit the modern fertilizer production.

Lingao First Fertilizer Plant had a big reputation and occupied a considerable amount of land, but currently, only the 10,000-ton superphosphate and 4,000-ton sulfuric acid supporting project had been completed. There was still a large area of idle land within the factory area, which was reserved for new projects in the future.

The superphosphate production line required a large amount of sulfuric acid. According to the annual production capacity of 10,000 tons, 3,800 tons of sulfuric acid were needed annually. Such a large amount of sulfuric acid could not rely on transportation from the current sulfuric acid plant and the coal coking combined plant. Firstly, the chemical industry sector lacked containers capable of long-distance, safe, and large-volume transportation; secondly, the three acids and two alkalis were basic chemical products, so from this perspective, the more production capacity, the better. Although the sulfuric acid plant and the coal coking combined plant could produce large quantities of sulfuric acid, there were also many places where it was needed. For an enterprise like the fertilizer plant that required stable supply all year round, it was more appropriate to build its own supporting facilities.

The superphosphate production line consisted of three workshops: a 14×7 square meter drying workshop, a 14×10 square meter acidulation workshop, and a 24.5×10 square meter packaging workshop. It included 10 sets of equipment such as a 30 square meter drying pit, a 2.5 square meter vibrating screen, a semi-continuous acidulation chamber, a bucket elevator, a sulfuric acid head tank, and a mixing pot. The staff quota was 150 people, covering an area of 0.264 hectares.

This project required 5,600 tons of phosphate rock annually, so the Planning Commission specifically arranged a 200-ton transport ship to shuttle back and forth to transport guano from the Xisha Islands. Moreover, the original 10 kWh of electricity consumption per ton was all changed to steam engine power, requiring thousands of tons of coal supply annually.

The 3,800 tons of sulfuric acid raw material were provided by the supporting 4,000-ton sulfuric acid workshop. The sulfuric acid workshop covered an area of 33×16 square meters, with a staff quota of 50 people. It required 4,892 tons of pyrite annually, also transported back by a dedicated 200-ton transport ship from the Shangen Pyrite Mine in Wanning. The 440,000 kWh of electricity per year needed to be converted into corresponding steam power—estimated to consume 4,000 tons of coal. In addition, 400,000 tons of industrial water were needed annually.

The visiting crowd watched the huge steel machines operating continuously. The smell of sulfur was pungent and unbearable. Piles of gray-white rocks and dust were continuously thrown into the giant mouths of steel, finally becoming "field-fattening powder" that could increase production when applied. They could somewhat understand things like composting done by Tiandihui—after all, compost was also a kind of farm manure. But this matter of increasing production using only stone powder was beyond their comprehension range.

Everyone was shocked in spirit. Thinking that the Chiefs held giant forces and hard iron in their palms, seizing the mechanism of creation, they felt not only awe and reverence but also a greater longing for Lingao's bright future. They were even more full of confidence in their own and their families' futures.

But for Ji Tuisie, the current situation was not beautiful at all. Industrial upgrading had too many places needing chemical products. From equipment manufacturing, military industry, agriculture, medicine... almost every sector put forward various demands to the chemical industry. However, the chemical industry sector could satisfy very few of these demands at present. Even for those that could be produced, most had the problem of insufficient capacity.

Firstly, this was limited by materials. Chemical production equipment required many corrosion-resistant materials and special steels. At present, their metallurgical industry basically could not satisfy this, and they had to extensively use ceramics and glass as manufacturing materials for many chemical equipment. Although the corrosion resistance of these two materials was good and the sources were extensive, the mechanical properties and processability of the materials were limited. They could only be used to manufacture some small equipment and parts as substitutes. This also made most of Lingao's newly built chemical enterprises akin to laboratory production expanded several times.

Moreover, the chemical department didn't have enough manpower: chemical plants had high pollution and many work injuries. Hundreds of people were killed or injured due to various accidents every year. Not to mention the appearance of the casualties was very terrifying—under Lingao's current medical level, most of the injured in chemical accidents could not survive, and those barely saved were mostly moderately to severely disabled.

 despite strict measures to block news of accidents and providing generous treatment, many naturalized citizens who knew a little about the inside story were still unwilling to work in chemical plants. They could only assign indentured laborers with no personal freedom to work in chemical enterprises. If Operation Engine hadn't brought a large number of indentured laborers, his plan to expand the scale of employment would really have been difficult to realize immediately.

Ji Tuisie was trapped by huge demand, inferior equipment, untrained workers, frequent accidents, plus intermittent raw material supply. The tossing and turning gave him gray hair.

After visiting the production line and letting the Tiandihui customers leave on their own, Wu Nanhai and Ji Tuisie took the "Commuter Train" back to Bairen City together.

Seeing that Ji Tuisie's expression was relatively relaxed, Wu Nanhai took out a "Chuqing Limited Edition" cigar and handed it over, taking the opportunity to say: "Old Ji, I heard that the production of ammonium bicarbonate is relatively simple. As long as there is anthracite, it's easy to do. And it is more suitable for the acidic soil here than ammonium sulfate. Do you think we can set up a dedicated line next? Our gap in nitrogen fertilizer is also very large now..."

"Old Wu, do you think we haven't thought about this? Back then, when the CCP engaged in small chemical fertilizers, many were ammonium bicarbonate projects. We have no problem with anthracite supply now. But the problem has gone in a circle and come back," Ji Tuisie lit the cigar and talked with fervor: "Our 800-ton synthetic ammonia uses the Hou Debang's combined carbon method common in small nitrogen fertilizer plants. Otherwise, where do you think the ammonium bicarbonate provided to you now comes from?"

The current 800-ton synthetic ammonia production project of the chemical plant used the combined carbon method invented by Hou Debang in 1958. The synthesis process used anthracite as raw material to first produce semi-water gas, which, after removing hydrogen sulfide, entered the pressurized shift reaction system to obtain a mixed gas of nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The mixed gas entered the carbonization tower, where carbon dioxide reacted with ammonia water with a concentration of about 17% to form ammonium bicarbonate crystals, which were separated by a centrifuge to obtain ammonium bicarbonate products.

The feed gas after removing carbon dioxide, after further removing residual carbon dioxide and a small amount of carbon monoxide, entered the ammonia synthesis system to make ammonia water.

Ammonia water could either enter the carbonization tower to manufacture ammonium bicarbonate or leave the factory as raw material to manufacture other chemical products.

This combined method could also produce a small amount of sulfuric acid at the same time, which was a production method with low energy consumption and high output.

Wu Nanhai was greatly disappointed: "So it's still a question of the scale of synthetic ammonia production."

"Exactly." Ji Tuisie said, "Without synthetic ammonia, we either find a channel to import saltpeter steadily from the mainland—this possibility is unlikely. Even if the Ming Dynasty turns a blind eye and the roads are open, the production capacity of this spacetime is unlikely to meet our needs; or we establish a trans-Pacific Chilean saltpeter maritime route right now..."

"That's even more impossible." Wu Nanhai shook his head, "We still have to establish mining points ourselves."

"That's right, so there is only one last way left: light up the tech tree of self-produced synthetic ammonia equipment as soon as possible and expand production capacity." Ji Tuisie said meaningfully, "The equipment manufacturing industry remains the foundation of everything."

"You are very right." Wu Nanhai said, "I think everyone understands this principle. It should be mentioned more often at meetings."

Ji Tuisie smiled: "Let's not talk about equipment problems for now. Just take the 4,000-ton sulfuric acid supporting project in this factory. It plans to use pyrite, requiring 5,000 tons a year. But the Shangen Pyrite Mine in Wanning County that we can mine now had a maximum historical output of just over a thousand tons a year. It's not enough even if we give it all to the current sulfuric acid plant. Even if the Shangen Pyrite Mine immediately reaches its historical maximum production capacity next year, I still don't know where to find this 5,000-ton new gap..."

Wu Nanhai broke out in a cold sweat listening to this. If the sulfuric acid support was insufficient, wouldn't his annual 10,000 tons of ordinary superphosphate go down the drain! He hurriedly asked:

"Are there no other pyrite mines in Hainan?"

"There are, but mining and transportation are inconvenient. Conditions aren't as superior as Shangen: dig it out by the sea, load it directly onto rail cars to the seaside, and load it onto ships." Ji Tuisie puffed on his cigar, "The Planning Commission's opinion is to first expand the mining of Shangen Pyrite Mine, and then import natural sulfur from Taiwan..."

Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Japanese archipelago, due to relatively active geological activities, had large amounts of natural sulfur ore. It was already an important export commodity in the Qing Dynasty.

"It wouldn't be bad if we could transport a large amount of natural sulfur. We also have a great demand for sulfur in agriculture."

"It's mainly a matter of shipping capacity and manpower. Speaking of Taiwan, Hualien has a large amount of serpentine—if it could be mined and transported back on a scale, using the blast furnace method to manufacture calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer would be much simpler than superphosphate, and it wouldn't need a supporting sulfuric acid project..."

"Taiwan is truly a land of treasure."

...

The two chatted all the way. Soon they arrived at their respective stations. It was already 3 p.m. when Wu Nanhai returned to the Agricultural Committee office. He sat down, took out a black leather secret memorandum from a locked drawer—this was specially used by him to record some relatively sensitive and important matters—and wrote a paragraph of text in it.
