# Chapter 1486 - Spy

The temperature in the drying room was high, and sweat seeped out from Marquis Bazan's curly hair again. Looking at the rows of shells on the wooden racks, a thoughtful expression appeared on his face, as if murmuring to himself: "Count Tilly fired eighteen thousand cannonballs daily at Magdeburg, yet even so, it took him five months to make the city fall. The entire Bavaria, along with Genoa and Venice, melted down all iron and lead, all foundries busy casting cannonballs for his army."

"If he possessed the cannons and shells you see before you, merely one-twentieth of the ammunition consumption would suffice to destroy the heretics' city defenses; perhaps one day would be enough." Hale bent humbly; having finished playing the fanatical scientific genius, he reverted to the role of a calm and devout priest: "Serving the Lord's cause is my highest glory."

"You are a bit impatient, Marcos," Hale scolded his henchman as soon as he watched the galley carrying the Marquis's party unmoor and sail down the Pasig River toward Manila. Boarding the carriage, he lectured Marcos, who followed his every command. "Those wooden-headed fools who can't figure out how to work deserve to die. But you would leave a wrong impression on my guests. They came here to see a factory they have never seen before, where everything is orderly and methodical; not some plantation where an overseer can beat slaves to death at will. That is everywhere in the colony, not fresh, and utterly worthless."

"I am truly sorry, Sir," Marcos stood at a loss until dragged onto the carriage by Hale. "Bad things like this keep happening in the factory. When you wanted to take the Spaniards to see the gunpowder mill, I was terrified. Fortunately, their brains were already overheated, and they didn't go."

"What's wrong with the gunpowder mill? An accident in the mercury fulminate room?"

"No, your students manage that place very well. It was the grinding workshop; a mixing drum for gunpowder caught fire. Fortunately, following your instructions, the humidifying pipe for mixing was connected to the fire hose, so the fire was put out quickly without an explosion. Four people were injured; one had his head smashed by the fallen drum rack—the doctor thinks he can be saved. The other three are burned quite severely, I'm afraid—"

"Maybe I can still make it in time to anoint them." Hale's tone sounded like saying "Tomorrow is Friday, prepare fish soup for dinner."

"Any other bad news? Did anyone die elsewhere?"

"A manual punch press in the pyrotechnics workshop was damaged. The worker responsible has been dealt with according to your regulations. Mr. Gebser is throwing a temper tantrum, complaining the workers assigned to him are deadly stupid, all uncivilized savages. The pass rate for fuze random testing has improved slightly over last month; sixty percent fired effectively."

"Tell that unwashed German that paying him the highest wages in the factory isn't just for selling his craft. If he can't teach the apprentices assigned to him well, I will personally punish him. What do I need most right now? It is talent that understands technology, more precious than any gold or gems. Marcos, I can absolutely never find a second talent like you."

"Marcos was made bashful by this praise: "No, Sir—in fact, I didn't even graduate from middle school—"

"At least you attended middle school, Marcos. In the era we are currently in, this is remarkable. I don't know why fate arranged for us to come here, but I know the education you received in the past is enough to look down on Spain's most erudite scholars of today. You can read, write, and calculate, understand principles of cost and efficiency, know statistical data, and understand the formulas and process flowcharts I write for you. What more can I expect? True, I have taken a few students who are very smart, but I have to teach them bit by bit starting from decimal points and leverage principles. This is harder than building Rome. Marcos, you are my right and left arm. Without you, whom can I rely on? Your 17th-century compatriots have their minds blinded by religious superstition; seeing a machine, they treat it as a demon, only knowing to kneel and pray not to be eaten. As for Spaniards? Those charlatans who only know to recite the Bible, take communion, and shout all day about executing heretics, or lazybones and fools only interested in grabbing money and making mixed-blood bastards? Marcos, this era allows us to rewrite history and achieve a great cause. But the start is difficult; you must help me."

After saying this, Hale poked his head out to look outside the canopy, leaving the flattered Fernando Marcos sitting inside in a daze. The Tagalog driver couldn't understand English, but seeing the priest master poke his head out of the canopy, he was so scared he whipped the horse fiercely several times. The carriage immediately rampaged, scattering a group of Chinese workers gathered to receive meals in all directions.

Japanese mercenaries ate from the large pots in the barracks. As for the thousands of workers and coolies, neither Hale nor the colonial government bothered to rack their brains over their meals; for 17th-century social management levels, this was also beyond their ability. In the end, factory meals were contracted by the Huang brothers, Huang Jian and Huang Xiang, Chinese administrative and clerical officers from the Parian who volunteered for this business. Hale originally hoped they would establish a canteen inside the factory. Unexpectedly, the cooks sent by the Huang family were terrified upon hearing the clamor of rows of giant machines and seeing barrels of gunpowder transported in and out. They refused to stay in the factory no matter what. Daily meals could only be cooked in the Parian and rowed to the factory. If bad weather prevented boats from navigating the Pasig River—with luck, dry rations would be brought by oxcart; with bad luck, all laborers in the factory would go hungry. Marcos argued with the Huang brothers several times about this, but never managed to persuade them to open a canteen in the factory. As for other Chinese contractors, none had the strength of these two brothers to advance a month's food expenses for thousands of factory workers and keep food poisoning cases like diarrhea to a minimum.

Ji Mide stood in the line for food distribution, surrounded by workers shouting and cursing in various languages due to hunger. Weiss Lando had to expend some effort to insert him into the Huang family's meal delivery team without attracting attention. His ladle hand didn't stop for a moment, but his gaze constantly roamed around the factory. Just as he was sizing up the departing carriage, he suddenly heard an old man sent by the Huang family scolding: "Youngster, don't slack off."

The old man was scolding two half-grown kids who came to deliver food together, pointing to several wooden buckets filled with rice and soup behind him, then pointing to the casting and forging workshop spewing thick smoke in the distance: "Carry them over, quick."

Ji Mide's heart stirred. His hair had grown long enough, his skin tanned dark; except for being a bit sturdier, he couldn't be distinguished from any ordinary Chinese in the Parian. Ideally, he shoved the ladle to a kid beside him: "Don't slack off, youngster." Squeezing out of the crowd, he picked up a carrying pole, shouldered the wooden buckets, and walked briskly toward the casting and forging workshop.

By the time the carriage carrying Hale arrived at the gunpowder mill, the three burned workers had long breathed their last. Corpses were covered with straw mats, ready to be carried to the mass grave behind the factory for burial. Casualties went from several a day when the factory was first built to one every few days now; people were long accustomed to it.

Worker casualties were far less worthy of Hale's concern than damage to equipment and factory buildings. To avoid an explosion affecting others, the gunpowder mill buildings were kept at a sufficient distance from other workshops, built on the banks of the San Juan River over a thousand meters upstream from the river mouth. Because factory buildings had been burned and blown up several times and rebuilt, outer walls and roofs were made of cheap woven bamboo strips, looking very crude in appearance. The roof was covered with layers of abaca cloth coated with wood tar and copal resin for waterproofing. The floor, however, was fastidiously paved with wooden planks, every crack carefully sealed with asphalt to prevent gunpowder grains from falling in. This fastidious, neat floor was now covered with puddles of water and messy footprints here and there. Workers were busy clearing water stains and tidying up canvas fire hoses thrown in disorder.

The completely burned wooden mixing drum was reduced to a pile of wreckage, stacked neatly by the wall near the scene. This was the rule in the Manila munitions factory: without Lord Paul's instructions, no one could dispose of this wreckage casually. The originally messy scene had been basically tidied up by workers who recovered from the shock.

"Was No. 1 black powder being mixed in this drum?"

"Yes."

"The regulation requires adding water to the drum when mixing; did they forget?"

"It's ridiculous to say. A worker shouted he was thirsty and pulled the gutta-percha tube off the humidifier to drink water. The others couldn't wait for him and directly rotated the mixing drum. Before it turned twice, fire broke out. The sulfur powder and charcoal in the bucket nearby also caught fire, burning quite fast. Fortunately, it didn't trigger an explosion."

"What about that bastard who drank water? Dead or alive?"

"Still alive. Suffered some superficial wounds on his head, bled a lot."

"Wait until his wounds are mostly healed, then along with the three idiots confined today, forty lashes each. Execute the punishment in public before dinner, let everyone watch."

After announcing the punishment for violators, Lord Paul began inspecting the workshop. Occasionally using Spanish, then switching to stiff Hokkien, he issued instructions or reprimands to bowing foremen. Foremen then turned to shout at workers in various dialects. After a burst of noise, the floor and fire hoses were quickly cleaned up. Machines resumed clattering with the water wheels, and work order gradually returned to the workshop.

"Production of No. 1 powder is estimated to stop for seven or eight days; it depends on when the carpentry workshop finishes the new drum."

Marcos nodded in agreement.

"Hurry up production of No. 2 and No. 3 black powder now. This isn't entirely a bad thing; our sulfur supply is always insufficient, saving a bit temporarily is also good."
