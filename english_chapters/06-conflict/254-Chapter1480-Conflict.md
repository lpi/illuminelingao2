# Chapter 1480 - Conflict

The band's ensemble performance was even better than the previous one, though the audience didn't show the same frenzy as in the garden. However, the atmosphere had been relieved from the awkwardness created by the Governor's secretary. Seizing the opportunity, the Baroness announced a brilliant play for the guests. With a few claps of her hands, servants quickly moved away surplus tables and chairs, clearing a space and setting up a simple stage and scenery. The musicians began playing melodious madrigals, performing the great poet Juan del Encina's *Cristino and Febea*.

The actor playing the monk Cristino provoked a wave of laughter as soon as "he" appeared; the audience could all see "he" was actually a girl. This girl's rather dark skin, the contrast between her soft face and sharp distinct features, all showed characteristics of mixed blood. Her cunning, intimate, and glancing eyes completely transcended the role; her flirting with the nymph Febea seemed reserved but was actually seasoned. When Cristino finally decided to yield to love and give up monasticism, she sang pretentiously:

*Monastic life,*
*Is indeed holy,*
*Only because they,*
*Are all old men.*

While singing, she coyly took off the monk's wide robe, revealing a slender figure wrapped in a men's doublet. Cheers, acclaim, and applause swept in like a storm instantly. Many eyes stared tightly at the girl's slender thighs wrapped in men's tight hose.

"Flora is very smart," the Baroness said. "The quickest-witted of the girls serving me."

Hearing the hostess's words, Esteban Sanabria felt the long-awaited opportunity to show off had arrived. "Good! Great! Bravo! Take your reward!" He cheered enthusiastically, tossing a purse to the feet of Flora, who played the monk. The thud scared the girl into backing away. Gold coins rolled out of the purse, scattering brightly all over the floor. The guests commoted. The colony tycoon was triumphant, completely failing to notice the Baroness's furrowed brows.

The Count waved his hand. "It is my fault for not preparing a gift for such a lovely girl. Madam, if you permit, I wish to make up for this fault." He stood up, picked a few dendrobium orchids and jasmine sprigs from a vase in the corner of the living room, took a ring off his hand, slipped it onto the bouquet, and tossed it to Flora. The girl caught the precious bouquet deftly, ran down the stage holding it, stood on tiptoe to kiss the Count on the cheek, then hid behind the hostess as if shy, not forgetting to leave the Count an amorous look.

The Governor's secretary screamed, forgetting to maintain his self-proclaimed lofty image, staring tight at the sparkling ring on the bouquet. "Oh my, Heavens, a diamond that big must be worth at least a thousand pistoles!"

The crowd instantly erupted—everyone knew of the Count's immense wealth; so-called "throwing gold like dirt" was probably just like this.

Eugenio greatly overestimated the value of this "diamond ring." Gemstone resources in Hainan and Lechang, Shandong, were quite abundant. Various gems were not highly valued in the Ming Dynasty; Lechang sapphires went unnoticed even in the early 20th century. Such rich gemstone resources naturally didn't escape the attention of the industrial sector. Besides using diamonds for cutting tools, Dr. Zhong of the Ministry of Science and Technology spent considerable effort developing jewel watch movements, though the advent of the Lingao version 24-jewel mechanical watch remained far off.

However, unintended actions brought unexpected success. The Ministry of Science and Technology stumbled upon a method to heat-treat the red zircon special to Hainan for color adjustment. The zircon, after heat treatment and decolorization, was carefully cut and polished according to modern processing methods, rivaling diamonds enough to pass for genuine. Since Chinese people didn't value gems much at the time, and sales prospects for similar zircon jewelry in the Great Ming were dim, the trade department prepared to send them to Macau, placing them in the display cabinets of the Purple Treasure Pavilion's Macau branch for export sales. The ring Weiss had just taken off his hand was such a ring. He glanced at Sanabria out of the corner of his eye. The colony tycoon's face had already turned green, his eyes darting panic-stricken between the Count, Flora, and the hostess.

Many guests were very interested in this impromptu rivalry, especially when the hostess ordered servants to pick up every single gold coin spilled on the floor and return them to Sanabria. The colony number one tycoon's face turned from green to pale. Malicious snickers rose from the crowd. For the remaining time, Sanabria refused to dance, instead burying himself at the card table trying to regain dignity. By the start of the dinner, he had lost his purse empty, not a single gold coin left.

The Baroness's family banquet was much more high-end and fashionable than most banquets in Manila. Quite a few guests watched the Count's movements intently while clumsily fiddling with silver forks. Italians had been used to eating with two-pronged forks for over a hundred years, but for Spaniards, this was still a novelty. As for remote Manila, Weiss Lando had seen many high-status Europeans still grabbing meat from plates with their hands, wiping mouths with sleeves, knowing not what handkerchiefs and napkins were. Dishes were served like flowing water. Some tasted excellent; others made Weiss frown: the chef superfluously stuck feathers plucked from the duck back onto its roasted body. As for famous dishes like stewed calf sweetbreads, mixed sheep brains, and celery braised oxtail, Weiss respectfully declined them all, only constantly sipping the sweet Madeira wine. This wine was excellent, even superior to the renowned sherry.

Fine wine and delicacies took effect quite rapidly. Clinking glasses were heard everywhere. Before long, shouts for the King's health and the hostess's beauty led to toasts. Heated with wine, people fell into a drunken frenzy. Alfonso was getting along famously with his neighbor, a pretty mixed-blood young matron whose husband was currently far away in a castle in Cebu. An elderly, white-haired city councilor took his glass straight to Lucrezia, pouring out how passionately he loved her and expressing his admiration, to which the latter responded with a charming laugh. Sanabria also leaned in, asking if the hostess was satisfied with his gift: a pair of massive Chinese porcelain vases painted with colorful patterns.

To celebrate his promotion, Lieutenant Colonel Alfonso had downed a lot of wine, and he was convinced he had won the heart of that beautiful Creole wife. He laughed loudly: "Sir, it would be best to ask His Highness Vannanova to open your eyes. In his private residence in Malate, the entire washroom is tiled with porcelain. Not these rough clay blocks," he pointed at the Portuguese painted azulejos paving the Baroness's living room wall, continuing drunkenly: "It's authentic Chinese porcelain, smooth as ice. The washbasin is a large porcelain basin fired in one piece, without a single flaw, the glaze lustrous enough to surpass crystal."

"Wouldn't that be a palace washroom only the Chinese Emperor possesses?" the Baroness asked in amazement.

"I'm afraid even the Chinese Emperor doesn't have similar enjoyment. If the Count doesn't mind, I'll continue. In his washroom, near the porcelain wall, sits a peculiar large porcelain jar, top-grade Chinese goods. Guess what this beautiful porcelain is used for?"

The Creole young matron spoke a few words softly, earning another loud laugh from Alfonso: "Wrong guess, Madam. Tell you, that porcelain jar looks strange, but ladies and misses would be very comfortable sitting on it, and men standing in front of it would also feel very at ease." Facing the female guests' gazes mixed with reproach and curiosity, Alfonso twirled his mustache, seeming extremely proud to act as the revealer of a huge wonder.

"And no need to worry about filth. After His Highness Vannanova finishes his business, he only needs to pull the handle of a machine. That machine sprays clear water, flushing all filth into the sewer in the blink of an eye, washing the porcelain jar commode clean as new, whiter than snow on the Sierra Nevada. So his washroom is always clean and fresh. Now, Mr. Sanabria, what do you think of using porcelain as a commode? Is His Highness Vannanova living too extravagantly, or is Chinese porcelain no longer that noble nowadays?"

"The Count doesn't value porcelain much," Andrade said. "Once, to verify marksmanship, he took out a whole set of Chinese porcelain tableware as targets. At a distance of 25 varas, he used a pistol to shatter those extremely beautiful butter dishes, sauce boats, and soup plates one by one. If I did similar shooting practice, I admit I'd go bankrupt in a few times."

Sanabria drank too much, his face flushed red. Thinking he found a straw to save face, he roared loudly: "Nonsense, complete lies! No one, using any pistol, could possibly hit a saucer at a range of 25 varas. Only the most shameless liar would boast so absurdly. I believe even at half of 25 varas, he couldn't hit anything, even if the target were a dining table."

"Hey, watch out, Mr. Sanabria. You are slandering the honor of a nobleman, perhaps two."

The colony's number one tycoon completely disregarded the warning. The resentment accumulated throughout the party erupted along with the alcohol fumes: "Italian noble titles are only worth 100 ducats! And a forged family genealogy doesn't even cost that much."

"That's not false," the Governor's Secretary started his torrent of biting commentary again: "I stayed in Naples for quite a while. When I left, my guest list recorded 119 princes, 156 dukes, 173 marquises, and as for counts, no fewer than three hundred. A Genoese broker or a Venetian gambler buys a piece of barren land in Mezzogiorno with money won at the card table, and he earns himself a title. Truly a business with ten thousand percent profit, worth bragging about greatly."
