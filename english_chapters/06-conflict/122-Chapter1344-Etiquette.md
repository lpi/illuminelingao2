# Chapter 1344 – Etiquette

He had weighed the consequences. Perhaps the Later Jin would fly into a rage at the humiliation and behead him to set an example; perhaps they would simply send him packing if he refused to kowtow. But after analyzing the matter repeatedly with his colleagues in the Great Library, he believed neither outcome was likely.

The Later Jin had not yet established the concept of absolute imperial supremacy. Huang Taiji's practice of sitting alone facing south had been implemented only in 1633; the Emperor's "face" was far less sacrosanct than it would become in later years.

Furthermore, the present Huang Taiji was "thirsting for talent." To woo Lamaism, when the envoy of the Living Buddha of Tibet arrived, Huang Taiji had received him with the highest honors. In the original timeline, when Kong Youde and Shang Kexi surrendered, he personally went ten *li* beyond the city walls to welcome them and even bestowed the "hugging courtesy." Plainly this was a monarch willing to use ultra-high-specification receptions to win hearts.

Finally, the Manchus had not yet usurped the Divine Land. The Khan of Heaven's Mandate could scarcely claim to "possess the four seas." On the contrary, he was desperately eager for trade.

Combining these three points, the probability that Huang Taiji would execute or expel Huang Hua for refusing to kowtow seemed vanishingly small. The probability of concluding a deal was high.

All the same, Huang Hua's mood was heavy. He faced the greatest anomaly in contemporary East Asia—Huang Taiji, whose existence practically begged the suspicion that he was a lone transmigrator. The psychological pressure was immense.

Huang Hua was a daring man. He had started as a small-time merchant in northeast border trade. Without considerable courage and discernment, no one survived in that line. But now he had to contend with the strong man of this era.

Set aside the advantage of centuries of foreknowledge. Measured against a figure like Huang Taiji, he was dust. Were it not for the Senate and the entire industrial system of Lingao behind him, he probably would have pissed his pants in fear long ago.

Looking forward past the horse's head, he saw that though bitter cold still gripped the land, the first hints of spring had arrived. River ice was beginning to melt; the soil had grown moist. Wild grass in sun-warmed roadside patches had awakened, sending up tender shoots. Willows everywhere bore yellow buds on their supple branches. Huang Hua drew a deep breath. The road ahead was long; whether this journey would prove auspicious or ominous, he could not say.

The party traveled for seven or eight days. Relay stations along the road did their utmost to supply them; commoners along the way scattered at the sight of the procession. On this particular day they crossed the Hun River, not far from Shenyang. The welcoming party sent by Huang Taiji—Manchu and Han officials led by Sahalian of the Ministry of Rites—greeted them with solemn ceremony. Banquets and gifts were bestowed. Huang Hua held to his rules: whether banquet or reward, he bowed in the direction of Shengjing to express thanks, but absolutely did not perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony. Sahalian and his colleagues found this unremarkable.

That night the group lodged at the Hun River Relay Station. Sahalian paid a personal visit—because they would enter the city the following day, both sides' etiquette during the audience had to be agreed upon. Sure enough, the proper form of meeting the Khan of Heaven's Mandate became the crux of discussion.

The Later Jin naturally hoped that this "Great Australia" from unknown parts would present itself according to the etiquette of foreign vassals—like the Mongol tribes and Joseon. The Khan of Heaven's Mandate could, of course, extend special courtesy—the "hugging greeting," for instance. But Huang Hua gritted his teeth and refused to yield. He was willing to perform only a three-bow ceremony. Beyond that, he would not kneel, not half-kneel, not even perform the *dadian*—the single-knee bow most common among the Later Jin.

To borrow the reporting style of his original timeline: the two sides conducted repeated consultations focused on this issue. Seeing that Huang Hua refused to relent, Sahalian dared not decide on his own authority. He had to send someone to seek Huang Taiji's personal ruling.

Huang Taiji himself was somewhat torn. He had originally intended to extend special courtesy to "Great Australia." A few days earlier, Ministry of Rites officials who had gone ahead sent a handful of the Great Australian envoy's "gifts" by fast horse. Crystal mirrors had amazed him—but what truly stirred his heart was a suit of full-body armor.

The armor was not only tightly protective but also allowed full freedom of joint movement. He had chosen his strongest archer from among his White-Armored Bayara to test-fire upon it. The protective effect was astonishing—better than the carefully crafted double armor worn by the Bayara. More crucially, soldiers wearing this armor could move more freely than in double armor, bore a lighter burden, and were far less prone to battlefield fatigue.

If all his Bayara could wear such armor, it would be like adding wings to a tiger!

He was therefore eager to see the envoy as soon as possible, to clarify the other party's purpose and "asking price."

Now, hearing the Ministry of Rites' report that the other party was unwilling to perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony, he could not help hesitating.

He did not inherently value empty ritual. But he had been influenced by certain Han officials who believed that a supreme ruler must command suitable ceremonial dignity—otherwise subordinates, princes, and foreign vassals would grow disrespectful. For years he had been concentrating royal power and placed great weight on authority; he dared not decide lightly.

Yet he did not wish to squander this excellent opportunity. After some hesitation, he resolved to consult Fan Wencheng. He summoned him to the Qingning Palace that very night.

Hearing that the other party steadfastly refused to perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony, Fan Wencheng pondered a moment. He had been aware of "Great Australia's" tribute mission from the beginning. A veteran of two reigns, having served Nurhaci like a dog and horse in his youth, he had weathered years of ups and downs and long since grasped the minds of Eight Banners nobles and Gioros alike.

He knew the Khan of Heaven's Mandate's character and style intimately. He understood that Huang Taiji valued the goods this group brought and that he urgently wanted to open a new trade route to relieve the current desperate fiscal situation. Therefore Huang Taiji could not bear to reject them outright.

As a high official of the imperial court, Fan Wencheng certainly understood the Great Jin's economic straits. Though he himself was a respected Grand Secretary, on ordinary days he still had to eat barnyard-grass rice from time to time; only when the Yi Dynasty paid tribute could he "receive" some proper rice as a reward. Daily necessities in the markets were all scarce—even paper for official correspondence was insufficient, forcing ministries to write documents on the backs of old files and waste paper left by the Ming. If Great Australia could supply various goods, it would be no small relief.

Huang Taiji asked: "The envoy is impervious to both carrot and stick, simply refusing to kowtow to Us. Would kowtowing cost him a piece of his flesh?"

Fan Wencheng replied: "The Great Australian envoy's refusal to perform the rites is certainly arrogant. But they are, after all, folk from overseas, frogs in a well, unaware of the Great Khan's majesty."

"In your opinion, Minister, ought We to make them see that majesty?"

"Your Majesty, in this subject's view, Great Australia is a distant country beyond the seas. Since they are willing to sail thousands of *li* to offer tribute, that alone demonstrates their heart's admiration for the Imperial Court. It does no harm to the great principle."

Huang Taiji smiled. "So you believe We can allow them not to perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony?"

"This subject believes: show them majesty, cherish them with grace."

Huang Taiji laughed aloud. "Good—well said!" After a pause: "In that case, grant them this grace!"

"The Emperor's breadth of mind is vast as the sea."

Fan Wencheng knew his speculation had been entirely accurate. That being so, he had another move ready to flatter his lord. He immediately proposed that, since they were being exempted from kneeling and kowtowing, holding an audience ceremony within the palace would be awkward. Better for the Emperor to set up a tent at some site outside the city under the pretext of a hunt, then bring the envoys for an audience there.

In the context of a hunt, all ritual formalities could be simplified, carrying an "informal" character. The adverse impression created by the other party's refusal to kowtow could be minimized.

And so the hunt was announced for the following day. The site was not far from the Hun River. Huang Taiji and his court intended to display the prestige of the Eight Banners; thus one thousand cavalry were drawn from across the banners, plus two hundred Red-Armored and White-Armored Bayara to guard the front and rear of the Emperor. Princes, Beiles, Beizes, Dukes, and *Gusa Ejen*—Banner Commanders—as well as the Bayara, would attend in person. Sahalian was ordered to bring the mission to the hunting ground.

Huang Hua did not know that the other side had already orchestrated the "discussion of etiquette" twist. When Sahalian appeared again, he no longer mentioned kowtowing. He announced that the Emperor's "Heavenly Grace is vast" and that Huang Hua would be permitted audience under "foreign vassal etiquette." Huang Hua finally exhaled in relief—at least he would not be returning empty-handed.

The party then proceeded to the hunting ground under Manchu and Han guidance. Though called a hunting ground, it lay near Shenyang itself; the journey took less than half a day. Around noon the trading mission arrived.

The temporary hunting ground had been established beside the Taizi River. Huang Taiji's tent occupied a hillside overlooking the water. At its center stood an immense yellow tent-palace; simplified ceremonial guards flanked its entrance. Most awe-inspiring was a great yellow umbrella representing imperial power, planted firmly before the tent. A smaller tent for officials on duty stood nearby, and rows of Bayara soldiers stood in silent ranks outside.

Along the riverbank, more than a thousand elite Eight Banners troops formed up to welcome them. As the trading mission drew near, deep horns sounded one after another, their notes carrying far along the water.

Five *li* out, Huang Hua had been asked to dismount from his mule litter. A rest tent had been pitched there. Ministry of Rites officials bidding him welcome invited him to rest, wash up, and change into formal attire in preparation for the audience. Hot water and food were sent in.

Huang Hua rested briefly and ate. Then he changed into his formal dress: the Fubo Army's wool winter uniform—a black woolen coat belted at the waist, long boots, and a cotton-padded cap for warmth.

His twenty guards also dressed uniformly, though their coats were gray. Each man carried two newly improved 1632-model revolvers rigged in a cross-draw harness on his back, plus a machete at his waist. All were elite soldiers selected from the Lingao Garrison Battalion—disciplined, alert, heroic in bearing. When they emerged from the tent after changing, they immediately caused a small commotion among the surrounding Manchu and Han officials and soldiers.

"Prepare a horse for the Lord!"

At the command, a bondservant led over an iron-gray steed. Huang Hua had crossed Inner and Outer Mongolia more than once; at a glance he recognized a fine Mongolian horse, full of vigor. He had trained hard at horsemanship in Lingao and felt no awkwardness. He mounted at once, and his subordinates followed suit.

"Let's go." At Huang Hua's word, a *Janggin* in the lead raised a flag. Two hundred cavalry of the two Yellow Banners who had been guarding at a distance immediately spurred their horses forward, surrounding the party. Each man was in full armor. They galloped past the mission at speed, then swiftly divided into two columns flanking left and right, sandwiching the group as they rode toward the Imperial Tent.
