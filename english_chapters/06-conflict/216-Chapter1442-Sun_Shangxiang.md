# Chapter 1442 - Sun Shangxiang

Leaving the Farm Café marked the happiest day for Cheng Yongxin since D-Day. This feeling of comfort and joy was unprecedented; it seemed she was full of talent for "political struggle," having settled Panpan so easily.

Panpan's emotions had now been completely stirred up, becoming her most reliable ally.

She took it for granted that conquering Panpan was equivalent to indirectly conquering Dingding—mastering the discourse power of pillow talk meant having the ability to subtly influence Dingding.

"You call yourselves 'media people,' yet you lack the self-awareness of media people entirely. You don't know the great energy you control, yet you willingly act as screws in the big machine of the Council of Elders. How pitiful." Cheng Yongxin sat on the rickshaw, enjoying the coolness of the night breeze on her face, thinking silently, "I will make you awaken."

She got off the rickshaw a distance from the Bairen City station and took the last small train to Gaoshanling—the Great Library was located in a secret location in Gaoshanling.

She returned to the Great Library. There was a letter from the General Affairs Office on her desk: a permit approving her entry into the Maid School to directly purchase a maid.

"Director Xiao's efficiency is quite high." She threw the letter back on the desk, a slight smile appearing at the corner of her mouth. "Why not go choose a cutie tomorrow?"

The formal name of the Maid School was: "General Affairs Office Life Secretary Training Center." The class was actually not far from Fangcaodi Academy, but because of strict security and tight concealment, very few people knew such a place existed. Its high walls were surrounded by dense bamboo forests and hedges. No one could pass through without the aid of knives and axes; only a small path wound its way to the main gate.

There were no sentries at the gate, no nameplate, only a simple house number. Even the most skilled postman at the Lingao Post Office didn't know where this house number was—letters sent from and to here were delivered to a post office box.

The gate here was closed all day long. Occasionally, when visitors arrived and pulled the bell rope, a small window on the door would open, requiring the visitor to hand in a pass and ID for inspection before being allowed to enter.

In theory, Elders did not need to come here in person to choose. The General Affairs Office had detailed files of all "pending assignment" life secretaries available for review, recording not only their complete family and personal situations but also school performance, scores in various items, and multiple half-body and full-body "lifestyle photos" for Elders to make accurate judgments under conditions as realistic as possible. However, as long as they had free time, Elders were still willing to see the girls with their own eyes before making a decision.

However, visiting the Maid School to choose a girl required permission from the General Affairs Office. Without a permit, even Elders, except for those holding positions or concurrent posts in the school, could not enter the Maid School—this was a special regulation by the General Affairs Office to fully guarantee equal rights among Elders, and also to avoid disrupting the teaching and living order within the school.

"Sun Shangxiang! What is with your leg-bending movement?!" A stern reprimand rang out once again in the physique classroom. The dance teaching assistant was a "senior," actually not much older than them, but those who entered first were seniors. Moreover, she was a formal teacher; a shout was enough to make unrelated maid students tremble slightly.

Sun Shangxiang hurriedly adjusted her posture. The skin on her back tightened—a premonition of being beaten.

Sure enough, the teaching assistant walked over aggressively, the rattan cane in her hand whipping down without mercy.

Waves of burning heat immediately rose on her back. She endured it, holding her pose motionless—with tears in her eyes.

Sun Shangxiang didn't know why she had to do this thing, holding the barre in front of a huge glass mirror and performing one baffling movement after another according to commands—it wasn't quite like singing opera, and it was too slow for dancing.

She had bound feet. She could never do well in anything related to body movement, and she suffered a lot for it. After a class, there would always be dozens more whip marks on her body.

"Further out! Stand steady!" Along with the reprimand, the rattan cane kept whipping her thighs and calves. No matter how wide she opened her eyes, she couldn't stop the tears from sliding down.

Just then, outside the glass window of the classroom, a pair of eyes was watching her.

"I'll take this one," Cheng Yongxin said. "Prepare her file."

"Yes, Chief. I'll prepare the handover documents right away."

Sun Shangxiang carried her rattan suitcase, a thin layer of sweat on her back; it was hard to walk when her feet were bound, and it wasn't easy now that they were unbound. Yet the chiefs forbid any woman from binding feet, let alone a so-called "life secretary" like her.

However, even if she still felt that small feet were beautiful, she had to admit that natural feet were uniquely advantageous when fleeing disaster—especially after she suffered greatly for it. During the flight, women with small feet only had the fate of waiting to be caught, raped, and killed. If she hadn't met the local militia sent by Master Lu in time, Sun Suyun, struggling after being abandoned by the fleeing crowd by the roadside, would have long fallen into the hands of rebel soldiers.

Sun Shangxiang naturally wasn't named Sun Shangxiang originally: her father Sun Huawu was a kinsman of Sun Yuanhua, the Governor of Deng-Lai. Though called kinsmen, her family had actually lived in Shandong for generations and had nothing to do with Sun Yuanhua whose ancestral home was in Jiangnan. But at least having the surname Sun made it easy to connect clans for care. Although her father was a small hereditary military officer serving in Dengzhou Garrison, without support, his future was limited.

Motivated by the desire to cling to a powerful leg, Sun Huawu took the family to convert to Catholicism as well, and Sun Shangxiang was able to be enlightened and learn to read. She took the school name Sun Suyun.

Obviously, whether connecting clans or believing in the foreign religion, her family didn't get much benefit—because once Dengzhou fell, everything turned to ash along with Lord Sun.

She didn't care much whether Lord Sun was alive or dead, but whether her father and her whole family were alive or dead always lingered in her heart. On the road of escape, first the domestic servants escorting them stole the livestock and fled, forcing her and her mother to struggle forward on foot. Then the refugees were attacked by disorderly soldiers. The clatter of horses' hooves, the coarse shouts of the soldiers, the triumphant laughter, and the desperate screams of the refugees were her only memories of the attack.

When she woke from her coma and crawled out from the pile of corpses, the snowy ground was covered with stripped dead bodies, some missing heads, some missing arms. Her family members were all gone.

She knew very well what fate awaited a single woman with bound feet in such a chaotic, freezing place with snow a foot deep. Never mind disorderly soldiers and bandits, even able-bodied refugee men passing by would take the opportunity to rape. Seeing snow dust rising in the distance and another group of people and horses arriving, Sun Suyun had the thought of running into the woods to commit suicide. Dragging a pair of small feet to run barely, she realized in despair that she had only walked a few steps with all her strength. Seeing the snow dust getting closer, Sun Suyun fell into the snow again, letting out a desperate scream...

Fortunately, it was Master Lu's militia that came. She was able to ride a cart to Qimu Island for refuge, and this refuge took her all the way to Hainan.

Sun Suyun wasn't stupid. On the contrary, compared to her eldest brother, on whom the whole family placed high hopes to inherit a position the size of a mung bean in the future, she was even smarter—but no matter how smart, she was just a fifteen-year-old girl with bound feet. She couldn't struggle against Master Lu's sturdy female servants at all and was stuffed into a big ship in a few moves. In a daze, she arrived at Qiongzhou Prefecture.

In the dim cabin, girls from opera troupe backgrounds around her whispered, discussing matters after arriving in Qiongzhou. Only then did she vaguely know that they were all chosen by the "Chiefs" of Qiongzhou to be sent as concubines. Although the girls' words revealed fear of the first wife, there was more excitement, fantasizing about wearing silk and satin beside the Australian lords, eating delicious food, or at least having enough white rice every day. Sun Suyun avoided the gazes of those women and shrank further into the corner.

"Rarely getting a full meal has made you all stupid... No matter how nice it sounds, you're just concubines, stuff like cats and dogs, available in any quantity..."

Her mother was a family member of a convicted official. If Sun Huawu hadn't redeemed her, and she hadn't taken advantage of giving birth to the eldest son to whisper pillow talk and make Sun Huawu divorce his childless first wife, she probably wouldn't have been able to bind her feet, let alone hope for a good marriage. But even her mother, who was elevated to be the second wife, suffered quite a bit at the hands of the newly married concubines when her beauty faded with age.

"Niuniu, Mother will definitely let you marry wearing a red skirt. Never be like Mother..." The sobbing of her mother in her memory merged with her own weeping. Mother, Niuniu is useless; Niuniu is going to be a concubine for an Australian lord—

In such a trance, Sun Shangxiang followed a group of girls with tears in her eyes, forming a long queue.

"Where are you from? What is your surname?"

"Dengzhou, Shandong. Surname Sun."

"Do you have a name?"

Name? Of course she had a name, but what was the point?

In the church, the priest praised her greatly and named her Suyun, saying she would become a pure noble lady with devout faith.

She didn't want to tarnish this name.

"No. nickname Da Niu'er (Big Girl)."

Becoming someone else's maid, wouldn't she be called whatever the master wanted? There might even be taboos to avoid.

Why ask for that unpleasantness?

"Mm, then you shall be called Sun Shangxiang."

Besides kowtowing to thank for the grace, was there any other choice?

"Shangxiang thanks the Lord for bestowing the name."

Sun Suyun died at sea; left behind was only the maid Sun Shangxiang.

"Hey, don't kowtow, don't kowtow! Alright, next!"

Then she was pushed into a shed, put on a cangue, and had her head shaved bald like a nun.

The girl next to her screamed as if being strangled, but she simply cried aloud.

—Niuniu, don't be like Mother.

Crying aside, Sun Shangxiang didn't dare to be lazy or slick: concubines were also divided into ranks. If she performed well enough, she would at least have some power to choose, like the top courtesans in brothels.

Because she had considerable education, fair and delicate skin, and a fairly well-developed figure—legacies given to her inadvertently by her family—she was selected into the maid trainees and sent here.
