# Chapter 1546 - "Cheating"

Zhou Zhongjun said nonchalantly, "I went shopping, and when I got to Nanbao Bookstore, I saw a few people acting sneakily at the counter. Seeing me pass, they immediately hid this book under a pile. I thought they must be doing something illegal—you know, we uphold justice and righteousness; how could I sit by and watch? So I followed them. Guess what?"

Huang Zhen groaned inwardly: *Young miss, we are here risking our heads on a deadly mission, but you think this is roaming the jianghu to gain experience? If you shouted 'Hengshan Sect's Zhou Zhongjun is here,' we'd all end up in the Cropped-Hairs' jail.*

Knowing it was likely her curiosity acting up again, he just asked, "What happened?"

"Turns out they were selling exam questions," Zhou Zhongjun said triumphantly. "The Cropped-Hairs require licenses for everything. But the exam questions were leaked long ago and are sold privately. You can buy anything you want..."

"So you bought this?"

"At first they stubbornly denied having it. But I scared them a bit, saying their behavior was suspicious and I'd report them to the police. They obediently brought it out and sold it to me. Only twenty circulation vouchers!" Zhou Zhongjun seemed very proud.

As an old *jianghu* hand, Huang Zhen felt something was wrong. Though exam fraud was rampant in the Ming, it was usually secretive, requiring middlemen. After all, it involved risking one's life and property!

Here in Lingao, though this license exam wasn't the Imperial Examination, many people's livelihoods depended on it. Rationally, the Cropped-Hairs would strictly punish cheating and definitely wouldn't let questions be sold openly on the street.

Huang Zhen grew alert—had she met swindlers? From Zhou Zhongjun's description, this was a common scam technique.

Thinking this, he quickly flipped through the booklet of thin cotton paper. He couldn't judge if the questions and answers were real, but on the last page, he saw a line of small print at the footer: "Reprinted based on Ministry of Health Press *TCM Practitioner Qualification Exam Mock Question Collection* 1633 Edition. Copyright belongs to the original author." Below was an ink stamp: "Manual Reprint License No. 66," and finally the price: 20 circulation vouchers.

Huang Zhen nearly collapsed: *This really is a scam!*

No wonder some sentences looked familiar. He hurriedly dug out a book from the pile on the table—the *TCM Practitioner Qualification Exam Mock Question Collection*, published by Ministry of Health Press. He had bought the 1634 edition, so the content differed slightly, but the price was only 3 circulation vouchers.

Huang Zhen didn't know whether to laugh or cry, realizing Miss Zhou had fallen for a street scam.

Seeing his strange expression, Zhou Zhongjun knew something was wrong. She snatched the book from his hand. Taking one look, her pretty face flushed red, eyebrows raised, and pearly teeth ground together: "They dared cheat *me*? Don't blame me for being ruthless." She turned to rush out.

Huang Zhen quickly stopped her. "No! We are in a dangerous place; we absolutely cannot conflict with anyone..."

"Are we afraid of a few measly Cropped-Hair lackeys?"

"We aren't afraid, but this operation would be wasted!" Huang Zhen feared that wasn't enough weight. "If we go back, we'd have no face to face the elders!"

This worked on Zhou Zhongjun. She knew her sect had invested heavily in this. If she ruined the big plan, she'd at least be expelled.

Though the Hengshan Sect wasn't paradise, it was free. Her master controlled her little; aside from restrictions on descending the mountain and required daily practice, she was free. Her family had money, sending silver and goods constantly, and even bought a little maid to serve her. Her lifestyle wasn't inferior to home. If she returned home, her parents would nag her about marriage—worse, she had refused foot-binding since childhood and had big natural feet. To marry a good family, she'd have to bind them at least symbolically. Just thinking of that made Zhou Zhongjun shudder.

But how could she swallow this anger? Her eyes reddened, tears swirling—though it was a trifle of twenty vouchers, she had never suffered such a loss since entering the *jianghu*. Now, in Lingao, she had been tricked by petty swindlers.

She gritted her teeth. "Brother Huang, I know the stakes! Tonight, let's kill those dogs together and burn down that bookstore!"

Huang Zhen knew she couldn't swallow the insult. He said gravely, "Absolutely not. This isn't Ming territory. If you start a fire, the Cropped-Hairs' heavy claws will search all of Nanbao. How could we hide?"

"So we just swallow this loss?!" Zhou Zhongjun ground her teeth.

"Endure for now! When the time comes to strike, not just this small bookstore—we'll burn the whole of Nanbao down!"

This finally pacified Zhou Zhongjun. Even so, she was unhappy. Going upstairs, she saw Nan Wan'er sweeping and scolded her: "Loose hoof! Sweeping for no reason, just pretending!"

Huang Zhen saw it clearly. Though he felt injustice for Nan Wan'er, his mind was full of exams and opening the shop; he had no mood to comfort her.

The license exam situation was grim. Jiao and Song had already backed out. Even the Huang brothers—it was uncertain if they could pass. He had asked around; passing wasn't easy. Even naturalized citizens here for a year or two had to enroll in "training classes" to pass; self-study success stories were rare.

As for the "training class," rumor had it one opened in East Gate Market called "New Lingao," co-run by Lingao's biggest pharmacy, Runshetang, and the Ministry of Health. Rumors said Chiefs Liu and Deng of the Ministry had private shares. Anyway, enrollees had high pass rates.

Huang Zhen originally thought this was like the stationery shops in the capital that facilitated exam fraud, thinking he could buy a way in. Unexpectedly, to enroll in the training class, one had to pass an exam first: whether naturalized or native, one needed an originally Grade B or above diploma for the class to accept them.

This drove Hero Huang crazy. Was this place fit for humans? This certificate, that certificate... even when the dynasty's founder established the strict Yellow Register and road pass system, the net wasn't this tight. Every step here was difficult.

And he had Zhou Zhongjun, a constant worry. When his master briefed him, he said women worked openly under the Cropped-Hairs, so bringing more female disciples would help cover their tracks.

Unexpectedly, after arriving in Lingao, Zhou Zhongjun wouldn't carry loads or work, only knowing how to wander and shop daily—far from covering tracks, she was an eye-magnet.

If he didn't open the shop and give her a proper identity soon, trouble would arise!

After much thought, helpless, Huang Zhen decided to ask the female director for advice. Maybe he could open a door through her.

Knowing she wouldn't take gifts, he saved the expense. Arriving at the branch, he didn't need announcing. The doorman said the Director was in her office, so he visited directly.

Seeing Huang Zhen visit again, the female director beamed. She seated him in a rattan chair, served tea enthusiastically, asked about his health, the shop's progress, and if he needed help.

Huang Zhen recounted his difficulties: "...We are all from the Ming. We know nothing of Australian rules like exams. We want to take them but find it extremely hard—the people I hired have practiced medicine and sold herbs all their lives, proficient in skills, but they are old. Asking them to memorize books now is too hard..."

The Director nodded as she listened, looking sympathetic. When Huang Zhen finished, she laughed, "Don't worry. The Yuan Elder Court always encourages commerce. However, medicine concerns people's safety. Letting anyone practice and sell medicine like in the Ming is a disregard for the masses' health. That's why the Yuan Elder Court set these rules."

"Yes, yes, the Yuan Elder Court's benevolence and spirit of serving the people completely commands Huang's admiration," Huang Zhen agreed respectfully, quoting a slogan he saw on the street.

Then he mentioned Zhou Zhongjun being cheated: not "asking the Blue Sky Official for justice," but fearing that if those people were caught by the yamen, the official would learn of it.

Rather than being questioned then—he didn't trust Zhou Zhongjun's responses—it was better to state it upfront. The amount was small, so it shouldn't attract much attention. Fortunately, the Cropped-Hairs didn't do "Thief Blooms"—the Ming yamen trick of using cases to extort money didn't apply here.

Indeed, the matter didn't interest the Director much. She just nodded:

"Cases like yours aren't rare here. Having drifted half a life in the Ming's old society and old system, you can't adapt immediately to the new society and new system. Older people struggle to learn new things and inevitably fear difficulty, wanting to use crooked ways or shortcuts—I understand all this." She placed her hand on her heart, eyes smiling, spring in the air.

"Yes, yes."

"This isn't the first time. You aren't the only victims. But we haven't found a good way to handle it yet. Those bookstore clerks are exploiting legal loopholes," the Director explained, "using your eagerness for success."
