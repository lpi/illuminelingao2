# Chapter 1495 - All Clear

"Liu Xiang is finished?!" The person asking in surprise was roughly fifty, wearing an eight-panel cap and lake-blue silk long gown with a jade pendant hanging at his waist, dressed like a common wealthy merchant. It was Qin Haicheng, the maritime merchant who represented sea merchant shipowners trapped in Huangpu to negotiate with Australians during the Canton Campaign.

"Yes, finished!" The middle-aged man sitting opposite him nodded vigorously, "I received news that just three days ago, Liu Xiang's entire gang arrived at Hong Kong Island. Chief Liu led his subordinate managers onto the island to petition for surrender. The scene was said to be incomparably grand—that was four hundred ships, thirty thousand people!"

"I remember Chief Liu had more men and ships than these..."

"Trapped in Chaoshan these two years, first by Zheng Zhilong, then by Australians, besieged until he couldn't move. With no money to earn, subordinates and ships probably scattered quite a lot."

"Truly incredible!" Qin Haicheng shook his head and turned the Xiang fei bamboo pipe sideways, letting a bright-eyed little maid light the tobacco with a paper spill. "Chief Liu has a Chaozhou temper, hardest of all. Back then when Zheng Zhilong's power surged to the sky, he didn't buy it. Didn't expect he would actually bow head and submit to Australians!"

"Australians are so strong; even the Zheng family was beaten into total defeat. Chief Liu's entity is far inferior to the Zheng family; what else can he do but surrender?"

"To be honest, I truly didn't expect Zheng Zhilong would be extinguished so fast!" Qin Haicheng took a puff, exhaling white smoke rings, "That financial power of the Zheng family: silver was truly like the sea. To build ships, truly build as many as they wanted, plus official backing—even Dutchmen didn't dare do anything to them. Said finished and they are finished, even the old nest was raided!"

"Although the Zheng family isn't finished at the moment, looking at this appearance, probably can't hop around much longer." The middle-aged man speaking was Liu Deshan, a merchant specializing in coastal trade. Although a native of Dongguan, Guangdong, he had a northern appearance in the south, looking like a Shandong big fellow. "Heard Weitou Bay is very unpeaceful; those several families of Zheng forces are secretly competing against each other. Probably before Australians attack, they will start killing each other first."

"Although Australians beating the Zheng family was unexpected, actually it was also within expectation. The sea, though vast, can't hold two dragons after all."

The downfall of Zheng forces and Liu Xiang's surrender to the "Kun" was a huge change for East Asian maritime trade. As maritime merchants, they naturally must carefully analyze the impact on their own business.

Since the Zheng family's rout in Weitou Bay, a considerable time had passed, but Qin Haicheng always held a cautious attitude watching—in recent months, he only cooperated with Liu Deshan conducting short-distance trade along the Chinese coast, not easily dispatching ships to Manila. Before distinguishing who truly possessed sea power, he wasn't eager to return to dangerous ocean trade.

"Isn't it just so? The Australian offensive can simply be described as sweeping away dry leaves. Early that morning we heard cannon sounds from the open sea at the inn and immediately withdrew to the *Dongshanju* with clerks and sailors. Who knew just after boarding and before hoisting sails, the Zheng naval force was already defeated and retreating. Australian ships immediately blockaded the port. In just one day's effort, Australian soldiers occupied the entire port; didn't know when they landed. One day! Just one day's time, the old nest Zheng family painstakingly managed was occupied by Australians..."

The man standing and speaking wore scholar scarf and robes but looked travel-worn, as if a scholar just returned from a long journey. He recalled the situation at the time—although long ago, still with endless aftertaste. The long-gowned man speaking was named Chen Huamin, Liu Deshan's cousin. He obtained the xiucai title at twenty but failed repeatedly in exams afterward. Seeing he was nearly thirty, family established but career unestablished, he simply gave up the path of officialdom through scholarship and also engaged in maritime trade. His family was Guangzhou natives, maritime merchants for three generations, dealing with foreigners since his great-grandfather's generation. Unlike other ordinary resident merchants sitting waiting for Franks [Portuguese/Spanish] to come trade, their family belonged to traveling merchants with their own ships, personally trafficking goods. The family had an old-style Guangzhou ship with over ten years of history. Chen Huamin followed his father and uncle since childhood, riding the old ship north to Japan, south to Nanyang trafficking various goods. Been to Taiwan [Dayuan], Nagasaki, Champa, Batavia, etc.; spending over half a year drifting on the sea. precisely because of this background, Chen Huamin understood the overseas world better than most Great Ming commoners and even merchants, also fostering distinctive commercial vision. Because he was young, his father didn't rest assured letting him go on long-distance ocean trade alone, so he told Liu Deshan to take this cousin to practice hands with coastal trade first. Happily, the family built a new ship; the old Guangzhou ship counted as Chen Huamin's capital for doing business.

Liu Deshan had no ship; he usually rented cargo space on others' merchant ships to do business. Business couldn't act big, expense spending was also large. Cousin had his own ship; the two hit it off instantly, partnering up to do business.

Liu Deshan and Qin Haicheng had longstanding business cooperation; many goods Qin Haicheng exported were supplied by Liu Deshan. Chen Huamin thus followed to come to the Qin family foreigner firm.

"At that time we all thought this time surely ship and goods would be gone, all swallowed by Australians. Who knew Australians raiding the port to collect goods looked at our Lingao navigation flag, checked the registration plate issued by Bopu Australian Yamen, then said we belonged to that Guangzhou... what 'individual household,' not counted as member of 'Fujian Zheng Group,' so could leave freely."

"You left Xiamen like that, not detained?"

"Yes, the leading Australian chief even said, as long as flying Australian navigation flag, port patrol Australian warships wouldn't block our ship from leaving. Afterward, I sailed on my own to Taiwan to trade. This business trip was instead smooth sailing."

Liu Deshan laughed: "I told you no need to worry. Australians always have most rules in doing things, also reason, unlike officials being unreasonable. Back then in Sanliang Town amid turmoil of war, they set up cannons in my mansion, used them, then repaired my house—truly committing no offense against civilians!"

Qin Haicheng nodded; this wasn't news. Back when Australians attacked Humen, over a thousand ships were moored in Huangpu Port, ship goods amounting to millions; Australians didn't touch a hair. How much was an old Guangzhou ship worth? Besides, one that bought Australian navigation flag.

After the Canton Campaign, Liu Deshan felt Australians were decent business partners. Hearing they needed various cold goods [metals], he boldly trafficked a ship of Foshan iron ingots to Bopu to trade with "Kun thieves." In days following, he constantly trafficked various native goods along Chinese coast to Lingao and Kaohsiung according to Colonization and Trade Ministry's "Trade Guide." Later, even opened a route to Longkou, Shandong.

Profit from engaging in this trade wasn't huge, but income was very reliable. No need to worry about goods sales; navigation safety was roughly guaranteed. As long as running diligently and often, making money was certain.

After accumulating the first bucket of gold, Liu Deshan and Chen Huamin discussed: the ship on hand was too old; better use this money to build a new ship. Chen Huamin noticed Australians had a shipyard in Hong Kong with new-style large ships for sale—civilian version seagoing ships specially designed by the shipyard for sales. This new-style large ship used cloth soft sails, having better seaworthiness, increased cargo capacity, simplified handling, and sailed faster than old style ships. Only price was high, plus being a new thing, general shipowners rarely dared ask about it.

Under Chen Huamin's suggestion, the two ordered a new-style large ship at Hong Kong Shipyard. Chen Huamin just waited for the new ship completion to prepare going down to Nanyang, ambitiously continuing this very promising career of maritime merchant.

This trip was originally planned to procure a batch of silk and cloth in Songjiang, then go south to Xiamen, procure a batch of dried seafood, then return to Guangzhou for sale. Because it was just a simple short-distance trafficking, Chen Huamin was busy planning stock-in for the next half year in Guangzhou, so Liu Deshan led the team alone, expected to return in a month. Result was at Hong Kong Island he opportunely got news of Liu Xiang surrendering to Kun. Although not understanding management much, he knew this annexation had huge impact, so didn't even do procurement, hurriedly rushing to Huangpu to discuss with partner.

"After Liu Xiang surrendered to Australians, the route from Guangdong to Shandong is all clear!" Liu Deshan said excitedly.

Originally this route was already roughly unimpeded since Weitou Sea Battle. Especially after Australians established Sea Police patrol system in Taiwan Strait, civilian ship navigation could roughly guarantee safety. But after all, various forces interlocked; small and medium merchants with small capital and weak strength still had to consider repeatedly when sailing.

"Indeed great business opportunities to speak of." Chen Huamin calmly went over the whole thing, thought it through, keenly discovering considerable business opportunities in this event. As long as willing to risk a bit, retuns could be great.

"Opportunity this time is divided into short-term and long-term aspects." Chen Huamin extended two fingers.

"Short term, due to Zheng family internal strife and Liu Xiang surrendering to Kun, Australians busy dealing with digesting victory fruits, inevitably causing other maritime merchants to watch and wait, not daring to enter this sea area easily. So freight from Xiamen, Songjiang and other Jiangnan regions to Taiwan, Kaohsiung is in a stagnant state. This will definitely cause price fluctuation. Outside goods can't come in, selling price will rise; self-produced goods can't sell out, selling price will drop. So now we transport goods over to sell, then buy local specialties back to sell; between this entry and exit, can make at least half more profit."

"One a half times profit, not small, pity can't do long! Then what is the long-term opportunity?"

"Why do most traveling merchants only run short distances, usually trafficking between adjacent cities? Don't they know long-distance trafficking earns more?!"
