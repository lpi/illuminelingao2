# Chapter 168: Baitu Village Expedition

The Baitu Village operation finally began after Xi Yazhou assumed command. This heavy-set fellow—after groaning through half a month's recuperation—was expelled by Wu Nanhai for attempting chicken theft. Though repeatedly claiming missing ducks weren't his responsibility, Wu Nanhai still told him to "stay far away." The rumored Army Club also died thereby.

Baitu Village was a small port between Lingao and Danzhou. Three sides mountains, excellent harbor, easy ship access—Lingao's main shipbuilding location. Recon reports showed: land routes difficult—only mountain paths. Locals had set barricades, deer fences, and stockades at path entrances—against bandits, also against officials and tax collectors. Frontal assault wasn't difficult for New Army. Xi Yazhou thought: even with swords and spears this force could handle Baitu—just more casualties.

"However—this should only be police action." Xi Yazhou studied Military Committee's recon maps. "These shipwrights are needed—can't kill too many."

"Your plan?"

"Armed procession. Force bloodless surrender."

"Cost-effectiveness—our Recon Team's best." Bei Wei suggested. "Surrounding mountains aren't steep—easy infiltration. Grab leaders directly—done."

"True. But Baitu's a soft target—perfect for newbies' taste of action." Ma Qianzhu said.

"Courage building?"

"Exactly. These people were hoe-holding peasants a month ago. Officers are all modern people—coordination might be poor. Let them smell powder."

"Fine—we'll make it varied. Considered a training exercise."

Baitu Village itself had no military. No organized militia—but all villagers armed. Reportedly repelled several pirate raids. Per intelligence: 500+ population, half able-bodied—mostly escaped shipwrights from Guangdong and Fujian. Originally just a tiny fishing village—7-8 households. Shipwright refugees arrived—population gradually grew.

Huang Xiong was promoted. This former *bazong* was nervous after interview—obviously distrust. Would these Australians eliminate him over suspicions? Anxiously passing days—considered fleeing—but remembered caught deserters were publicly paraded. His identity meant certain death if recaptured.

After anxious days, he was appointed 3rd Company 8th Squad Leader. 3rd Company's commander was "You Laohu" (Old Tiger You)—loved wielding broadsword. Hearing Huang Xiong was a Ming officer, he demanded a saber match. Huang Xiong hesitated—should he deliberately lose? Finally decided showing real ability served better—Australians valued merit over background.

Victory wasn't easy. This "Tiger" had no technique—all heavy chopping. But tremendous strength and excellent combat instincts. Huang Xiong took several minutes to disarm him.

"You lose, Captain!"

"With real blades—you'd lose faster!" Tiger snarled. "I have a Green Dragon Crescent Blade!"

"That's an opera prop. You'd lose even faster!"

Tiger glared, then bellowed: "Good man! Real skill!"

Huang Xiong somehow became Tiger's "brother"—forced into daily after-drill sparring. He'd expected Tiger would make him a personal guard—but Australians didn't do that. Tiger as Company Commander managed 100 men—*dusi* rank in Ming army—yet had only one "guard."

"This operation's objective: subjugate Baitu Village." Xi Yazhou briefed all platoon-and-above officers. "Minimize casualties. Maintain restraint. Many newbies—strict discipline. How's *Three Main Rules and Eight Points* song progress?"

"Taught three days. Mostly learned." Temporary battalion political instructor Wei Aiwen reported.

"Not just singing—understanding the lyrics' meaning." Xi Yazhou said. The catchy song explained military discipline and civilian relations simply—an invaluable educational tool.

"Next—logistics—"

Since nitroglycerin failure, Ye Yuming returned to rabbit raising. Recently—his ears were filled with that phrase. "Per Army's private discussions—this is the first major expedition since New Army's founding." Agriculture Department faced an enormous challenge: field rations.

"Provisions before troops." Army leadership agreed on deploying New Army—substantial scale, demonstration armed procession. But regardless of plans—soldiers needed eating.

Despite primitive status, field ration R&D orders already reached Agriculture Committee. Their headache: trial-producing portable rations surviving Hainan's high heat and humidity while providing adequate nutrition.

Logically: low-intensity 3-day operation with newly developed field kitchens—hot meals would be ideal. Field rations universally tasted bad—emergency reserves only.

But this operation doubled as equipment testing. Military Committee required 3 days' field rations—multiple varieties, letting troops test-eat, collecting feedback.

Agriculture Department had already trial-produced various portable foods from across China and world: parched rice, steamed cakes, rice balls, parched flour, flatbread, *nang*, rice cakes, *hyōrōgan*... Wu Nanhai even developed "Jinhua crispy biscuits"—a bizarre item. Indeed long-lasting—but nearly inedible. Plus crispy biscuits needed massive lard—currently all fats were "strategic materials."

Dry flatbread, parched flour, *nang*, dried *mantou*—all mature portable foods. Easy processing. Especially flatbread—proved valuable during the Gou Manor battle. Extremely shelf-stable—Shandong peasants' traditional journey food. But Lingao's grain situation was rice-dominant. Red potato was flatbread's main ingredient—but nutritionally deficient for military use. Flatbread and other wheat products were eliminated.

Remaining: rice products. Ye Yuming proposed parched rice—also parched rice cakes with malt sugar. But parched rice stored worse than parched flour. No malt sugar available. Someone proposed *hyōrōgan*—previously made. Taste was horrifying: cooked rice sun-dried. Reportedly warrior food for samurai. Post-trial consensus: only Japanese could stomach it.

Rice noodles, rice cakes, rice flour, rice thread, rice balls, rice wrappers... various rice products were excavated from memories. Through cafeteria and Agriculture collaboration, extensive research and imagination—soon came a table full of prototypes.

This military ration experiment earned a grand name: "Long March Plan." Later Wu Nanhai thought that name should be reserved—became the current archives' anticlimactic "Grassland Plan."

Facing a table of bizarre test rations better suited for pranks, everyone reached a remarkable consensus: distribute everything to the expedition—feed troops when hungriest, observe reactions, let practice verify truth. But who'd be the field observer? Imagining angry officers—immediate mutual deflection began...

While exchanging glances trying to avoid the life-threatening task, salvation appeared: recently headquarters-frequenting wise Staff Officer Dongmen Chuiyu. At this critical moment—he passed by Farm.

Dongmen Chuiyu originally wanted private tomatoes from Farm—also checking Wu Nanhai's servant girls. But once spotted, after brief but sufficient eye-paralysis, everyone enthusiastically requested his observation of field ration development...

Under the inspiration of fearless revolutionary spirit and internationalism, Comrade Dongmen Chuiyu resolutely agreed to represent Agriculture Department's field ration survey. He received two tomatoes. Farm staff watched his departing figure with reverence. As the saying goes: "Wind is rising—Yi River is cold..."

After intense preparation, the Baitu expedition departed Bopu. Including: 1st Company; 2nd and 3rd Companies' one platoon each—160+ men; Military-Political School cadets—30; Military Committee Direct Recon Team—10; Artillery Section—40+. Also Medical Group's female Technical School student team led by Hema (River Horse). Finally: 100-man supply train.

Navy deployed the newly refurbished two-masted sails *Fubo* for sea support, plus 6 purchased or converted local boats full of supplies. If ships weren't scarce, Xi Yazhou would've transported everyone by sea.

Five infantry platoons advanced in four-abreast column. Soldiers' octagonal caps wore rattan helmets—colonial pith style. Helmet fronts had shiny steel plates stamped with unit numbers, providing extra protection. White sun flaps trailed behind—essential in Lingao's extreme sunshine. Canvas gaiters pulled tight. Cowhide belts carried doubled ammo pouches—4 pouches totaling 120 rounds and 130 caps. Canteens, bayonets, entrenching tools, miscellaneous pouches hung from double-shoulder rattan backboxes stuffed with gear—blankets strapped on top. Though supply ships accompanied—every soldier carried emergency 10 rice cakes. Squad leaders had 1 liquor bottle. Emergency rations—only consumed upon order.
