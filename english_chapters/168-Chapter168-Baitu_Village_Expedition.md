# Chapter 168: Baitu Village Expedition

The Baitu Village operation finally began after Xi Yazhou assumed command. This heavy-set fellow, after groaning through half a month's recuperation, was expelled by Wu Nanhai for attempting to steal a chicken. Though repeatedly claiming the missing ducks weren't his responsibility, Wu Nanhai still told him to "stay far away." The rumored Army Club died with it.

Baitu Village was a small port between Lingao and Danzhou. Surrounded by mountains on three sides, with an excellent harbor and easy ship access, it was Lingao's main shipbuilding location. Recon reports showed that land routes were difficult, consisting only of mountain paths. Locals had set barricades, deer fences, and stockades at the path entrances—defenses against bandits, but also against officials and tax collectors. A frontal assault wouldn't be difficult for the New Army. Xi Yazhou thought: even with swords and spears, this force could handle Baitu—it would just mean more casualties.

"However, this should only be a police action." Xi Yazhou studied the Military Committee's recon maps. "These shipwrights are needed—can't kill too many."

"Your plan?"

"An armed procession. Force a bloodless surrender."

"Cost-effectiveness—our Recon Team's best," Bei Wei suggested. "Surrounding mountains aren't steep—easy infiltration. Grab leaders directly—done."

"True. But Baitu is a soft target—perfect for giving the newbies a taste of action," Ma Qianzhu said.

"To build courage?"

"Exactly. These people were hoe-holding peasants a month ago. Officers are all modern people—coordination might be poor. Let them smell powder."

"Fine—we'll make it varied. Consider it a training exercise."

Baitu Village itself had no military. There was no organized militia, but all villagers were armed. They had reportedly repelled several pirate raids. According to intelligence, the population was over 500, with half being able-bodied men—mostly escaped shipwrights from Guangdong and Fujian. Originally just a tiny fishing village of 7-8 households, shipwright refugees arrived and the population gradually grew.

Huang Xiong was promoted. This former *bazong* was nervous after the interview—obviously fearing distrust. Would these Australians eliminate him over suspicions? He passed his days anxiously. He considered fleeing, but remembered that caught deserters were publicly paraded. His identity meant certain death if recaptured.

After anxious days, he was appointed 3rd Company 8th Squad Leader. The 3rd Company's commander was "You Laohu" (Old Tiger You), who loved wielding a broadsword. Hearing Huang Xiong was a Ming officer, he demanded a saber match. Huang Xiong hesitated—should he deliberately lose? Finally, he decided showing real ability served better—Australians valued merit over background.

Victory wasn't easy. This "Tiger" had no technique—all heavy chopping. But he had tremendous strength and excellent combat instincts. Huang Xiong took several minutes to disarm him.

"You lose, Captain!"

"With real blades—you'd lose faster!" Tiger snarled. "I have a Green Dragon Crescent Blade!"

"That's an opera prop. You'd lose even faster!"

Tiger glared, then bellowed, "Good man! Real skill!"

Huang Xiong somehow became Tiger's "brother"—forced into daily after-drill sparring. He had expected Tiger would make him a personal guard—but Australians didn't do that. Tiger, as a Company Commander, managed 100 men—the equivalent of a *dusi* rank in the Ming army—yet he had only one "guard."

"This operation's objective: subjugate Baitu Village." Xi Yazhou briefed all platoon-and-above officers. "Minimize casualties. Maintain restraint. Many newbies—strict discipline. How's *Three Main Rules and Eight Points* song progress?"

"Taught three days. Mostly learned," temporary battalion political instructor Wei Aiwen reported.

"Not just singing—understanding the lyrics' meaning," Xi Yazhou said. The catchy song explained military discipline and civilian relations simply—an invaluable educational tool.

"Next—logistics—"

Since the nitroglycerin failure, Ye Yuming had returned to rabbit raising. Recently, his ears had been filled with that phrase. "According to the Army's private discussions—this is the first major expedition since New Army's founding." The Agriculture Department faced an enormous challenge: field rations.

"Provisions before troops." The Army leadership agreed on deploying the New Army—a substantial scale, demonstration armed procession. But regardless of plans—soldiers needed to eat.

Despite their primitive status, field ration R&D orders had already reached the Agriculture Committee. Their headache was trial-producing portable rations that could survive Hainan's high heat and humidity while providing adequate nutrition.

Logically, for a low-intensity 3-day operation with newly developed field kitchens, hot meals would be ideal. Field rations universally tasted bad and were meant for emergency reserves only.

But this operation doubled as equipment testing. The Military Committee required three days' worth of field rations in multiple varieties, letting troops test-eat them to collect feedback.

The Agriculture Department had already trial-produced various portable foods from across China and the world: parched rice, steamed cakes, rice balls, parched flour, flatbread, *nang*, rice cakes, *hyōrōgan*... Wu Nanhai even developed "Jinhua crispy biscuits" —a bizarre item. Indeed, they were long-lasting, but they were nearly inedible. Plus, crispy biscuits needed massive lard—currently, all fats were "strategic materials."

Dry flatbread, parched flour, *nang*, dried *mantou*—all mature portable foods. Easy to process. Especially flatbread—it proved valuable during the Gou Manor battle. Extremely shelf-stable—Shandong peasants' traditional journey food. But Lingao's grain situation was rice-dominant. Sweet potatoes were the main ingredient for flatbread, but they were nutritionally deficient for military use. Flatbread and other wheat products were eliminated.

Remaining: rice products. Ye Yuming proposed parched rice, as well as parched rice cakes with malt sugar. But parched rice stored worse than parched flour. No malt sugar was available. Someone proposed *hyōrōgan*—previously made. The taste was horrifying: cooked rice sun-dried. Reportedly warrior food for samurai. The post-trial consensus was that only the Japanese could stomach it.

Rice noodles, rice cakes, rice flour, rice thread, rice balls, rice wrappers... various rice product ideas were excavated from valid memories. Through cafeteria and Agriculture collaboration, extensive research and imagination, soon came a table full of prototypes.

This military ration experiment earned a grand name: "Long March Plan." Later Wu Nanhai thought that name should be reserved—and it became the current archives' anticlimactic "Grassland Plan."

Facing a table of bizarre test rations better suited for pranks, everyone reached a remarkable consensus: distribute everything to the expedition, feed the troops when they were hungriest, observe their reactions, and let practice verify the truth. But who would be the field observer? Imagining angry officers, the immediate mutual deflection began...

While they exchanged glances trying to avoid the life-threatening task, salvation appeared: the wise Staff Officer Dongmen Chuiyu, who had recently been frequenting headquarters. At this critical moment, he passed by the Farm.

Dongmen Chuiyu originally wanted private tomatoes from the Farm—and also checking out Wu Nanhai's servant girls. But once spotted, after brief but sufficient eye-paralysis, everyone enthusiastically requested his observation of field ration development...

Inspired by a fearless revolutionary spirit and internationalism, Comrade Dongmen Chuiyu resolutely agreed to represent the Agriculture Department's field ration survey. He received two tomatoes. The Farm staff watched his departing figure with reverence. As the saying goes: "The wind is rising, and the Yi River is cold..."

After intense preparation, the Baitu expedition departed Bopu. Included were: the 1st Company; one platoon each from the 2nd and 3rd Companies—160+ men; Military-Political School cadets—30; Military Committee Direct Recon Team—10; Artillery Section—40+. Also the Medical Group's female Technical School student team led by Hema (River Horse). Finally: a 100-man supply train.

The Navy deployed the newly refurbished two-masted sails *Fubo* for sea support, plus 6 purchased or converted local boats full of supplies. If ships weren't scarce, Xi Yazhou would've transported everyone by sea.

Five infantry platoons advanced in a four-abreast column. Over their octagonal caps, the soldiers wore rattan helmets in a colonial pith style. The fronts of the helmets had shiny steel plates stamped with unit numbers, providing extra protection. White sun flaps trailed behind—essential in Lingao's extreme sunshine. Canvas gaiters were pulled tight. Cowhide belts carried doubled ammo pouches—4 pouches totaling 120 rounds and 130 caps. Canteens, bayonets, entrenching tools, and miscellaneous pouches hung from double-shoulder rattan backboxes stuffed with gear—blankets strapped on top. Though supply ships accompanied them, every soldier carried ten emergency rice cakes. Squad leaders had one liquor bottle. Emergency rations were only to be consumed upon order.
