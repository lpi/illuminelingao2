# Chapter 1609 - Advance and Retreat

His proposed terms were: 1. Agree that the existing structure of the Political Security Bureau remain unchanged, with the Director appointed by the Executive Committee and confirmed by the Elder Council, but clearly define its authority to combating organized crime and monitoring dissidents and persons posing threats to Elders—with no overreach; 2. Establish an Elder Council Budget Committee to maintain tight control over each department's finances, achieve financial transparency, and eliminate secret expenditures like "intelligence fees" or "special funds"; 3. Establish an Elder Council Security Committee to place the current External Intelligence Bureau, Political Security Bureau, National Police, and other powerful agencies under its oversight, with heads of subordinate departments nominated by the Directors but requiring approval of the Elder Council Security Committee before taking office; 4. Establish an Elder Council Secret Service to provide security services for Elders and VIPs, subordinate to the Elder Council Intelligence Committee.

"...Through appointments to the Secret Service we can pull Salina over to our side," Zhou Weisen said. "In the old power structure, she's a guest—she has no real influence. Besides, there's that incident—"

Although the upper echelons of the Elder Council kept quiet about Salina's near-rape, and she herself never mentioned it, the Qian brothers and Zhou Weisen all believed that rape—whether completed or not—inflicted deep psychological trauma on women. She would instinctively reject most members of the Elder Council. The "North American Party," thanks to shared language and cultural background, would naturally earn her trust. In fact, her close association with the Flying Cloud Society over the past few years confirmed their suspicions.

If Salina could head the Secret Service, then the Nerds' Party would have substantial influence over the internal VIP security system—both officially (through the Elder Council Security Committee) and unofficially (through Salina).

"You're absolutely right. And who says the Secret Service can only handle VIP protection? Its original main function was enforcement for the Treasury Department," Qian Shuiting said meaningfully. "Many agencies now need enforcement teams—the Cheka, the Tax Bureau all have their eyes on this. Once we have the organization, the Secret Service can gradually take on business—we should avoid wasteful duplication of agencies."

Zhou Weisen said: "I estimate points 1, 3, and 4 can be achieved with this case. After all, establishing the Security Committee also gives ordinary Elders an outlet—a platform to exert influence without having to grovel to the Organization Department. Gradually, we can sideline the Executive Committee's creature, the Organization Department, and take personnel power into our hands. Point 2 is trickier, but it must be completed before the Guangdong campaign, or the Executive Committee's tail will truly become too big to wag. The resistance to overthrowing the Executive Committee and establishing a cabinet system will only grow."

"No, point two doesn't matter. Whether it passes or not is fine—our focus isn't there," Qian Shuiting shook his head. "Under the Executive Committee system, the so-called Financial Comptroller's Office is just a bookkeeper. Most of the time it's still controlled by the Executive Committee and the Planning Institute—especially the Planning Institute. If we don't take down the Planning Institute, a Finance Committee alone won't do much."

"You mean to use this as a bargaining chip?"

"Yes. Financial power is of little use to us right now, but it's very important to the Executive Committee. They'll definitely fight to keep it, yet they'll lack any acceptable reason to refuse oversight. We can step back on this point in exchange for the creation of the Security Committee." Qian Shuiting lifted his glass and gazed at the rich amber liquid. "Of the four points we're proposing, the first and fourth should pass without issue—they're matters of course. Resistance will focus on the third."

"Still, the budget is an important link. If we can use this opportunity to establish the frameworks for Finance, Security, Intelligence, and Personnel committees in the Standing Committee, future reforms will be easier."

"Take it slowly. Haste makes waste." Qian Shuiting gazed out at the sea. "Political ideas have inertia. The Elders all live within the political inertia of their past environment, accustomed to the old system. We can only proceed step by step. When the opportunity arises, we can propose these committees later. The first step is always the hardest—once we've taken it, the rest will follow."

Zhou Weisen poured himself fresh whiskey: "Who do you think would be a good choice for Security Committee chairman? How about Shan Liang?"

"I haven't decided yet. But Shan Liang isn't suitable—he's the type who fires off attacks; he's offended too many people. Making him chairman would actually be a problem. But we can't put one of our own people in too obviously. I think we should find an apolitical Elder who's friendly to the Nerds' Party as a candidate." Qian Shuiting thought for a moment. "We'll place more of our people on the committee itself."

"I'll go arrange the election business," Zhou Weisen said. "It's a pity I'm in the Special Reconnaissance Unit—time is short. And once the unit is transferred, I won't be able to help you."

"That's all right. Once the Secret Service is established, I'll find a way to have some Special Reconnaissance personnel transferred to the Secret Service—then you can come back as a training instructor." Qian Shuiting drained his glass.

Zhou Weisen didn't stay long after dinner. He needed to return immediately to the Special Reconnaissance Unit to arrange work—the political battle in the Elder Council ahead would require his active involvement.

Qian Shuiting sat alone on the club veranda for a long time. As the hour approached ten o'clock and he was about to return to the boat to sleep, Qian Xuanhuang came to announce: Shan Liang had arrived.

"Show him to the terrace," Qian Shuiting said.

"Old Qian, you really know how to live!" Shan Liang called out loudly in greeting, his heavy footsteps echoing on the wooden floor. He wore a blue work uniform—washed, but with stubborn stains still visible.

"Have a seat. Have you eaten?" Qian Shuiting rose to greet him. "Bring the Early-Clear edition cigars—"

"Already ate. You still have Early-Clear edition? Speaker Qian really is generous!"

"Just a bit of last year's stock. There's a cigar humidor on the boat—still in decent condition."

Shan Liang plopped down, pulled out a cigar, and instead of using the cigar cutter on the tray, directly sliced off the end with his Swiss Army knife. He flipped open a Zippo lighter, lit the cigar, and took a deep drag.

Qian Shuiting lit his own cigar with a match from the tray: "Just getting back to Lingao? Busy with work?"

---

"Our Telecom Company is a labor camp—worse off than Chief Wen's naturalized citizen secretary. Nothing like Speaker Qian's comfort here." Shan Liang didn't bother with niceties. "So what did you call me here for?"

Shan Liang had refused Cheng Yongxin's invitation the last time and hadn't gotten involved in the Maid Case. Though he hated the Executive Committee "cattle," he didn't like Cheng Yongxin's pushy, superior attitude either. Besides, the Maid Case wasn't his cup of tea—Shan Liang didn't care about naturalized citizens' rights, and he had no interest in women's rights. Speaking out on this issue felt beneath him.

The critical point was that Cheng Yongxin hadn't offered him any real benefits, and he couldn't see what she could offer in the future either.

True, joining the Maid Case would give him some exposure and raise his visibility. But beyond that, he'd gain nothing. Her promised "power of the media" was, in Shan Liang's view, entirely hollow—she didn't actually control the media, just had some influence. The more grandly Cheng Yongxin talked, the less reliable he found her.

In politics, being a tool is fine—but you have to be paid your worth.

Shan Liang had given Cheng Yongxin polite brush-offs. Apart from posting a few things on the internal forum to maintain visibility, he hadn't opened fire in the Elder Council, nor had he written any long articles for the newspapers. Then he went back to the construction site.

When he returned to Lingao this time and learned of the Lingao incident, Shan Liang instinctively knew: a golden opportunity had arrived!

Compared to the Maid Case, which most Elders didn't care about, this event would obviously shake the Elder Council far more. Shan Liang knew that before long, someone would come looking to use him as a spearhead.

"It's about this terrorist attack, of course," Qian Shuiting said. "What are your thoughts?"

"The Executive Committee ignores the masses of Elders, the cadres are bureaucratic, and the administrative organs are corrupt and incompetent," Shan Liang said indifferently. "Nothing but the usual."

"You're right—those are all problems. But the Executive Committee has built up immunity to these by now, and the masses have started to adapt to these injustices. Raising these points again probably won't push the Executive Committee to improve."

Shan Liang thought: *This is promising!* Old Qian must have some bombshell inside information and was planning to throw it out through him.

"Old Qian, do you have inside information?"

"Yes, I do." Qian Shuiting stopped beating around the bush. "Did you know the Political Security Bureau is collecting blackmail material on Elders?"

"Really?!" Shan Liang's eyes widened—he had heard vague rumors about this, but they were all roadside gossip without a shred of evidence. Now, coming from Qian Shuiting's mouth, it was a completely different matter—he was an Executive Committee member!

"I'm certain it's true." Qian Shuiting nodded. "Based on various signs..."

Shan Liang immediately sank into disappointment: "So you have no direct evidence?"

"Of course not. How could I have direct evidence? The Political Security Bureau is a black hole—nothing goes in, nothing comes out. Airtight as an iron barrel."

"Then isn't this just empty talk?" Shan Liang leaned back against the chair and blew a smoke ring. "I've heard about the blackmail files before. But what good is it? Without evidence, who'll believe it? And we can't go in to investigate."

"Now is the perfect opportunity. The terrorist incident caused such a stir—what was the Political Security Bureau doing? They're the ones primarily responsible. There must be an investigation—a thorough investigation." Qian Shuiting smiled. "Strike while the iron is hot!"

"Kick them while they're down!" Shan Liang understood. "You mean seize this chance to lift their black lid?"
