# Chapter 1628 - Insider Information

"Tell me about it," Qian Shuixie said, looking at the wine in his Czech crystal carved red wine glass. "Domestic class contradictions are prominent, what to do? Start a war abroad to divert the masses' attention—the old routine."

This caused a bit of aversion in Liu Xiang, because he still supported the mainland strategy. While there might be a hint of diverting attention, the dignified Senate had been beaten to its doorstep by the powerful of the Ming. If they didn't launch an offensive and continued to hide their light and bide their time, wouldn't people point fingers and curse the Executive Committee all the same?

In short, those in power carry original sin. Liu Xiang now somewhat understood the psychology of those self-proclaimed "Soy Sauce Senators." He still remembered the attitude of that Deputy Director who had just parachuted into Qiongshan and initiallly found fault with everything he did—*You are guilty just for being a leader! You serve errors! We the masses are the most innocent and blameless!*

Fortunately, his attitude changed after working for a while. Practical work truly exercises people best.

"The situation is pressing, too." Liu Xiang took a big gulp of beer. "If we don't launch an offensive, the Executive Committee won't be able to justify itself either."

"That's true too." Qian Shuixie nodded. "But this matter should be handed over to our Special Reconnaissance Team to be professionally suitable."

Liu Xiang was confused again. According to his understanding, capturing a big city like Guangzhou was nothing more than the Pearl River Campaign back then: simultaneous naval and land operations, plus artillery. Even if the Special Reconnaissance Team was useful, it would be for "decapitation" and "reconnaissance." They couldn't be asked to climb ladders and siege the city, right?

Perhaps seeing Liu Xiang's confusion, Qian Shuixie laughed loudly: "Old brother, do you still think attacking Guangzhou is as complicated as when we burned the Five Rams Station back then?"

"What else could it be?"

Qian Shuixie got up and poured himself some more mixed fruit brandy: "The current Guangzhou is actually no different from being defenseless. As long as we are willing, we can have a party in Guangzhou tomorrow: just within the Guangzhou Great World, there are three companies of troops stationed. And a dozen cannons."

"Doesn't this mean preparation for war was made long ago?"

"Not necessarily," Qian Shuixie shook his head. "Big Brother said that there was originally a debate within the Executive Committee about whether to attack Guangzhou. The focus was still on the issue of trade with the Ming—Si Kaide, that capitulationist, was always afraid that war with the Ming would cause an interruption in trade—of course, he doesn't oppose it now either. As for sending a few companies over, it was mainly to stand guard and act as a construction team. The investment in the Great World isn't small."

*You gotta be kidding me!* Liu Xiang complained loudly in his heart! "I've been designing the actions over in Guangzhou according to the underground government plan all along! This is great; is this the rhythm of scraping everything and starting over?"

Liu Xiang thought depressedly: *It's bad not being in the ruling center! Lack of channels for grapevine news!*

Speaking of "man proposes, heaven watches," just as the two were acting like they were doing underground work, Qian Xuanhuang's footsteps broke this mysterious atmosphere very punctually.

"Sir!" It was Qian Xuanhuang's voice. "People from the General Office act here. They say they are the orderly and guard assigned to Senator Liu in Lingao. The official letter is with me."

Qian Shuixie sat up straight and said loudly: "Please invite them up."

Liu Xiang took the official letter and looked at it. It indeed had the General Office's seal. He let Qian Xuanhuang bring the people in—the official letter also had a special handwritten note saying there were things to be handed over to Liu Xiang personally.

"Hello, Chief! Guard Lin Dengwan (Leader One), Di Bage (Debug), Orderly Ye Siman (Yesman), reporting to you!" The three of them gave a very distinctive self-introduction as soon as they arrived.

"Hello, Chief! This is the package the Executive Committee designated for you to sign for personally!" Another young man with an Executive Committee liaison cloth patch pinned to his chest took out a package and handed it to Liu Xiang. The kraft paper envelope was stamped with a red seal: Top Secret. Liu Xiang opened it and saw: another thick document, *Research on Historical Materials of the Liberation of Shanghai and the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries Movement*, with a receipt attached. Liu Xiang took a pen from his chest pocket, filled out the receipt, and gave it to the liaison. This bustling young man then took his leave.

Turning back to exchange a few words with these three people, and incidentally teasing Di Bage's rare surname, he sent them to wait outside—by convention, the *Feiyun* did not receive anyone other than Senators and Senator's maids.

"This is really preparing to open fire!" Once it was quiet again, Liu Xiang patted the *Research on Historical Materials* in his hand and sighed to Qian Shuixie.

Seeing Liu Xiang's obvious helplessness and anxiety, Qian Shuixie understood after a little thought—this guy probably didn't know from the beginning that armed recovery was going to be carried out this time. Maybe he still thought it was going to be an underground government like in Leizhou.

After chatting a few more sentences, Liu Xiang indeed expressed with great sorrow that he had always thought it was an underground government and completely didn't expect the Guangzhou direction to be an armed takeover. Firstly, Liu Xiang was eager to study the newly sent *Research on Historical Materials*. Secondly, Qian Shuixie was also anxious to contact the *Xiaocang*—the sun was almost setting, and Duoduo, that girl, had slipped out for the whole day and still hadn't been seen. It was really worrying.

At this time, Qian Xuanhuang came up: "Sir, a call came from the port. Miss's boat just passed the fort monitoring point..."

"I'm going over right now!" Qian Shuixie stood up abruptly. "Rebelling, is she! does she have any sense of crisis!" He hurriedly smiled apologetically to Liu Xiang: "I have to go over first. Big Brother and Sister-in-law are busy, Duoduo that girl..."

"No problem, no problem, you go ahead." Liu Xiang said hurriedly.

"Xuanhuang, you serve Mr. Liu first, start grilling."

"No rush, no rush." Liu Xiang said no rush, but his stomach was already very hungry.

Of course, nothing happened to Qian Duoduo. It was just that this girl was finally not satisfied with crawling along the coast. Today, in the name of the captain, she ordered the boat to sail to Xuwen on the *Xiaocang*. Little Lin and Little Zhang, the most "senior" girls in the Girls' Commando Team, felt that there were more patrol boats in the strait recently, and going to Xuwen was a straight up-and-down route, so it would be hard to get lost. So they argued slightly with Qian Duoduo, made a few agreements, and finally agreed.

The boatswain on the ship was a retired marine who had participated in the Xuwen naval battle and was specially hired by Qian Shuixie. He was also relatively familiar with the Xuwen route. A boatload of people went and returned without any danger. It was just that on the return trip, Qian Duoduo insisted on going to the combat waters where the Gu family pirates were encircled and suppressed back then to "pay respects," which delayed time.

Qian Shuixie knew that the *Xiaocang* was about to enter the port after talking to the *Xiaocang* via the PHS radio, so he personally went to the park anchorage to "pick up" the people. After Qian Shuixie left the dining room, Liu Xiang began to study the *Research on Historical Materials*, comparing it with the *Compilation of Local Conditions* as he read. Qian Xuanhuang came in from time to time to deliver a few plates of grilled seafood, meat skewers, and vegetables, and refilled his beer. unknowingly, more than an hour passed, and it got dark—Guo Ling'er was accompanying the little girl to sleep in the guest room on the ship at this moment and had no time to come over and serve.

During pregnancy, one cannot have intercourse; during breastfeeding, because there is no period to signal, intercourse can easily lead to accidental pregnancy again, so one cannot have intercourse either; after weaning, the baby starts to recognize people, so intercourse is also extremely inconvenient. But many Senators who think with their lower bodies, especially certain people who treat lifestyle secretaries as toys, completely disregard these. Therefore, in the past few years, there have been several cases of miscarriage caused by intercourse during pregnancy, or accidental pregnancy caused by intercourse during lactation, making Ai Beibei, Shi Niaoren, and other medical personnel furious. Finally, under the operation of Du Wen and others, a "Campaign to Establish Good Living Habits" was launched, and sex education pamphlets were distributed to every Senator.

Just as this matter ended, Shan Liang and others, who had been criticizing Du Wen and the health department's "education movement" for "trampling on Senators' rights and interfering with Senators' lives," launched another attack, demanding that the Executive Committee distribute free second secretaries to all Senators and expand living space to solve the problem of expectant fathers and new fathers' "Five Misses" taking up posts without licenses again. After all, not all Senators bought a second maid. For example, some spent the money, some built their own private villas, some were controlled by someone... This matter dragged on for a long time and still hasn't been resolved. However, many Senators who led teams had already developed their own "Nth Secretary" from the grass around their nests—unlicensed ones. But whether these unlicensed ones counted as mistresses, lifestyle secretaries, or some other status? In short, things were getting more and more troublesome.

Liu Xiang actually wanted to develop a second secretary too, but that Lu Cheng, whom he didn't want to contact deeply, kept getting close to him—this basically blocked the path of "advancement by favor" for others. He couldn't openly tell this Lu of the Women's Federation face to face that "I'm not interested in you." As a result, the entire "best excuse period" passed, and Liu Xiang failed to "take in a new person." He could only find a few naturalized craftsmen from the timber factory to build ship models together after get off work to pass the time and energy. Unexpectedly, this became a model example. When Du Wen wrote an article criticizing a certain group of Senators who only knew how to think with their lower bodies, she specially brought Liu Xiang out as a positive character, making Liu Xiang want to cry but having no tears. Of course, when Guo Ling'er, who was responsible for reading newspapers to Liu Xiang, read this passage, her eyes were obviously filled with tears, and her reputation soared from worship directly to fanatic believer. She bolted the door on the spot, and then *this and that* happened...

Sitting for an hour, Liu Xiang didn't realize that so much time had passed—know that IT coolies have very strong sitting skills. Just after finishing a paper titled *Initial Attempts to Consolidate Urban Power in New China* and preparing to turn the page, Liu Xiang heard Qian Shuixie's scolding and Qian Duoduo's rebuttal coming from outside.

The arguing voices of the uncle and niece grew from small to large, travelling all the way to the deck. Qian Duoduo was tanned dark, with a sun hat on her head, her striped shirt spotted with water stains and some salt crystals.
