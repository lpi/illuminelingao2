# Chapter 1093 - South Gate Guanxiang

There were many officials in Laizhou City. Besides Sun Yuanhua and the local Prefect Zhu, Magistrate Hong, and garrison military officers, there was also Shandong Regional Inspector Wang Daochun. According to the historical trajectory, a large group of officials and generals would come to Laizhou in February: Commander-in-Chief Yang Yufan defeated at Xincheng, newly appointed Shandong Governor Xu Congzhi—reasonably speaking there should be Xie Lian too, but now that Sun Yuanhua was safe and sound, it was unknown if it would be his turn to be the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou. In addition, there were Army-Supervising Eunuchs Xu Deshi and Zhai Sheng, etc.

Among the rural gentry, there were also a group of past prominent officials. The highest ranking was Jia Yuxiang, formerly Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Left; slightly lower was Zhang Xin, a *Jinshi* of the fifth year of Tianqi, now dismissed and at home... These people all participated in the Defense of Laizhou.

These people were all shrewd characters. His group of "village braves" inevitably had too heavy traces of "Baldy Thieves"—although the Great Ming didn't have CCTV News, officials' news was relatively well-informed. They probably had a vague concept about the "Baldy Thieves" in Guangdong with sharp firearms. Rationally and emotionally, it was not suitable for him to show his face too much in front of them.

What a shrewd person Sun Yuanhua was; hearing Lü Zeyang's words, he immediately understood the other party's meaning. Although he didn't know the future historical trend, he had already received news that Xu Congzhi was about to enter the city. He completely agreed that the other party didn't want to cause extra complications.

"I wonder where Strong man Lü is willing to be stationed?" Sun Yuanhua nodded and agreed to his request.

Lü Zeyang had already considered this issue on the road. If he stayed in the city, the city would soon gather various guest and host armies. Historically, the relationship between host and guest armies was rarely harmonious. Even if officials suppressed effectively, his more than one hundred people being in the midst of it would unavoidably be implicated. Not to mention he would have to spend a lot of effort to balance relationships with various parties, which would be very exhausting.

Moreover, the relevant intelligence forecast sent by the History Research Group of the Great Library also mentioned that Sun Yuanhua would likely lose the position of Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou—even if he continued to keep this position, there was still Xu Congzhi in Laizhou City. In the future, it would be difficult for Sun to maintain absolute authority in the city. His own force was small after all. Without Sun Yuanhua's support, he might be used as cannon fodder.

Rationally and emotionally, stationing outside the city was the best policy. However, this location couldn't be too far from the city. If he was isolated outside and couldn't play a role at critical moments, he would lose the purpose of coming to Laizhou. So after thinking again and again, he expressed his willingness to lead the army to station in the *Guanxiang* (suburbs outside the city gate). The location was the *Guanxiang* outside the South Gate.

Compared to the *Guanxiang* of the other three city gates, the area outside the South Gate was relatively desolate. There were many ancestral halls and cemetery courtyards of large households outside the city, with many empty houses, convenient for stationing troops. More importantly, it was closer to Hutuya, the main harbor of Laizhou, facilitating response from the navy at sea.

In the Ming Dynasty, in all city defense battles, as long as conditions permitted, defenders would try to set up camps outside the city to directly defend the city gates. Lü Zeyang volunteering to defend the South Gate *Guanxiang* was not strange for city defense.

"Stationing at the South Gate *Guanxiang* is fine. Only you have only one hundred people, how to guard the South Gate *Guanxiang*?" Sun Yuanhua felt that the other party's willingness to volunteer to guard the South Gate *Guanxiang* was commendable for courage, but inevitably overconfident. According to his plan, the strength stationed at the South Gate should be at least five hundred combat soldiers, coordinated with village braves and able-bodied men—and even that might not be enough. A large number of firearms inside Dengzhou City would likely be transported by rebels to attack the city. At that time, probably five hundred people wouldn't be enough to fill the gap.

"Presumably the Lord also knows our firearms are sharp—" Lü Zeyang didn't hide it, "Rebel soldiers are nothing but clay chickens and pottery dogs."

This remark was inevitably too arrogant. Just as Sun Yuanhua was somewhat displeased, Lü Zeyang added: "If there is some surplus strength in the city, transferring several hundred able-bodied village braves to assist in battle, this lowly one would also be extremely grateful."

The implication was not wanting government troops. Sun Yuanhua understood his meaning. But thinking of entrusting the South Gate *Guanxiang* to several hundred village braves and able-bodied men, he was inevitably hesitant. But on second thought, thinking that he didn't have many fresh troops in hand, the fall of the *Guanxiang* was a matter of time. It might be better to keep capable combat soldiers to directly defend the city.

Although what Lü Zeyang brought were called village braves, their actual combat power would not be below the combat soldiers of Great Ming—perhaps even above them, otherwise they would never have defeated Commander-in-Chief He's army in Hainan.

"Good!" Sun Yuanhua nodded, "You will be stationed at the South *Guanxiang*." He pondered for a moment, "The defense of the South Gate will be personally presided over by this student."

"Lord is brilliant!" Lü Zeyang thought Sun Yuanhua was indeed a sensible person. It was a convention in the Ming Dynasty for main officials in the city to be responsible for one gate each during city defense. In the historical Defense of Laizhou, Xu Congzhi, Xie Lian, and others were each responsible for one gate. Xu Congzhi was even killed by rebel artillery fire during the city defense battle. If other officials were responsible, they would inevitably be suspicious of the source of this village brave unit. It would be much more convenient if Sun Yuanhua was directly responsible.

As for the sent village braves, Lü Zeyang had confidence to control them all, use them as migrant workers first, and finally absorb them all directly into the Advance Column in one pot.

"Only the South Gate still lacks a defending general..." Sun Yuanhua remembered another thing. Anyway, Lü Zeyang was just a "commoner" without any official rank. Being responsible for the defense of the South *Guanxiang* lacked a title, and it wasn't easy to coordinate with other units in the city. He had no trusted generals in hand, which made him somewhat embarrassed.

"You can invite General Zhang Tao to defend the South Gate." Lü Zeyang said. Seeing Sun Yuanhua full of astonishment, Lü Zeyang immediately whispered the news of Song Guanglan, Wang Zheng, Zhang Tao, and others being rescued to him.

"Lord rest assured, we have temporarily kept them on the island. After they rest for a day or two, we will escort them to Laizhou." He said meaningfully, "Several lords could fight their way out of the chaotic army at that time; naturally they are all people who deeply understand righteousness and know how things work. Lord need not worry..."

"Very good!" Sun Yuanhua was overjoyed. The rescue of these people was of course good news for him, who was almost a commander without an army. But they more or less knew about his capture. Now Lü Zeyang's words were very unauthorized: these people were all prepared to hide the experience of being captured. Everyone was on the same line. As long as the narrative was unified, naturally there was no need to worry about the capture anymore.

Immediately Sun Yuanhua instructed him with a few more sentences, then called an advisor to take his handwritten order to lead him to meet Zhu Wannian: All village braves entering the city to assist in defense had to register there, reporting numbers and weapons, so that the prefectural yamen could issue grain and military pay. At the same time, supplementary weapons would be issued depending on the situation.

Walking on the main south-north avenue of the Drum Tower Street in Ye County seat, looking at the dilapidated Laizhou Prefectural Yamen not far away, Senator Lü Zeyang couldn't help but feel a sense of absurd dissonance.

Although Lü Zeyang and Lü Yang differed by only one character in names, they had no kinship relation at all: Lü Yang was from Ningxia, while Lü Zeyang's family was from Shandong, more precisely, Laizhou City of Yantai, Shandong, which was the Ye County, the head county of Laizhou Prefecture where Sun Yuanhua was now. This was also why the Senate specially liberated him from the heavy audit work of the Cheka and sent him to the Laizhou front line when the Engine Action reached a critical moment. Speaking of familiarity with Laizhou scenery and customs, no one in the entire Senate could suppress him. Not to mention other things, just that mouthful of Laizhou dialect of the Special Reconnaissance Team warriors and lurking intelligence agents was taught personally by Senator Lü Zeyang.

Although there were deserters or refugees from the three eastern prefectures like Huang Ande among naturalized citizens, most were from Dengzhou Prefecture further east, which was the later Weihai and Yantai area. The gap between the dialect there and Laizhou dialect even reached the point where one could distinguish it by listening. This was also a headache for the Executive Committee during the planning stage of the Engine Action. When they really couldn't find Laizhou-origin naturalized citizens, they had to pull Senator Lü to treat a dead horse as a living horse to give training. Fortunately, the population composition of Laizhou didn't change much from the late Ming to the entire Qing Dynasty, and the dialect was well preserved. So Senator Lü's Laizhou dialect teaching, according to the feedback from the Engine Forward Command, had "good effects."

Actually, during the preparation stage of the Engine Action, Senator Lü wanted to return to his "hometown" in the geographical sense to have a look. Helplessly, he was neither military personnel nor expendable soy-sauce crowd. As a professional graduate of Xiamen University in accounting, even in the talent-filled Finance and Economics Department, Senator Lü was scarce financial and accounting personnel. Moreover, he was one of the few who had worked in both the National Tax Bureau and the Inspection Bureau, familiar with organizational structures. So Cheng Dong and Yi Fan always used him as main labor. In the founding stage of departments like the Cheka and the General Administration of Taxation, Senator Lü had always been charging at the front line. And the start of the Engine happened to catch up with the year-end accounting stage of tax revenue. Senator Lü felt almost returned to the days of internship in the firm back then: cups of coffee one after another from morning to night, busy and battered facing mountainous year-end reports in the smoke-filled office...

Senator Lü, busy until his eyes were red, naturally missed the opportunity for the first batch of personnel dispatch. He personally had strong opinions on this. The reason he gave up the plain civil servant life to join the crossing was naturally to create a career. Senator Lü harbored a great ambition: taking T.V. Soong, the God of Wealth back then, as a model, to establish a Senate version of the Tax Police General Regiment, or, Armed Financial Guard!

Tax police was a powerful department established for the purpose of anti-smuggling and combating tax evasion. It existed in countries with huge local powers like Russia and Italy, but not in the Celestial Empire. The Tax Inspection Bureau only had the right to audit accounts. The business of combating tax evasion belonged to the Economic Crime Investigation Division of the Public Security Bureau, which was not even as good as the Customs; at least they had specialized anti-smuggling police. Of course, the ultimate tax police was still Brother-in-law T.V. Soong's Tax Police General Regiment. Of course, under the Senate system, this was impossible. But following the example of Italy, establishing a small-scale, quasi-military "Armed Financial Guard" was quite to the liking of several heads of the Finance and Economics Department—as strength expanded, Yi Fan also felt more and more that his department still needed to grasp the gun barrel, otherwise the name Cheka would be wasted.
