# Chapter 1807 - Land Grab

Arriving at Liu Xiang's office, Ai Zhixin discovered that the participants were all Elders. Besides Liu Xiang himself, the police bureau's Xiao Zishan was present—nothing unexpected about that, since managing vice was within public security's purview. Lu Cheng was there too—also unsurprising, as women's affairs fell under the mass work department.

But sitting in the corner was an Elder whom Ai Zhixin didn't recognize. The police uniform he wore bore no insignia that might indicate rank. Upon inquiry, he learned this was the newly reassigned "combat hero" Mu Yifei, who would be participating in the sex trade rectification work.

The pre-meeting conversation centered on how this work should proceed. Lu Cheng reported on a household registration survey of the pleasure quarters conducted several days earlier: Guangzhou's Fangchun Quarter, where licensed prostitution was concentrated, had over a hundred establishments of various sizes. Though there were no precise statistics on the number of prostitutes, she estimated between five hundred and eight hundred in the larger houses alone—not counting streetwalkers, private prostitutes, and others outside the pleasure district.

The licensing system was based on Hainan's model, implemented through business registration and personal registration. Operating licenses had to be renewed annually, which addressed taxation issues. Every licensed prostitute had to register with the local police station to obtain a "yellow ticket"—this yellow ticket system for prostitutes had existed historically and wasn't a Council of Elders innovation. Medical examinations would be conducted simultaneously with registration.

"We've already notified several major establishments that registration is about to begin." Police representative Liu Yun showed Liu Xiang a rough schedule. "In another three to five days, we'll start issuing operating licenses."

Liu Xiang examined the document and set it aside, exchanging glances with Ai Zhixin. This wasn't what today's meeting was about.

Ai Zhixin said: "I've looked into the vice tax situation in Guangzhou—the Great Ming's laws didn't prohibit prostitution, only forbade officials from patronizing prostitutes. The taxation model was largely based on the Song system: levies on prostitutes, various dues collected from entertainment venues, and wine and vinegar taxes—since entertainment venues sold alcohol. Later these were merged into a basic annual tax assessed per establishment—larger houses paid more, smaller ones less—this is the current 'official tax' that the two counties of Nanhai and Panyu collect."

"But this is the official tax. The private 'gifts' and various payments extracted from brothel operators by yamen runners, local gentry, and powerful lords were far more burdensome. When you add up these various expenses, they constitute an extraordinarily heavy tax burden."

Liu Xiang examined the document, immediately grasping the implication: for local strongmen and powerful lords, vice was a cornucopia of revenue. There must be many people reluctant to see the Council of Elders take over.

"The current official annual tax revenue from Guangzhou's pleasure quarters is about 3,400 taels per year. What I propose is simply adding a 'vice tax' as a local surcharge—a fixed rate on brothel revenues."

"What rate?"

"10%."

Ai Zhixin elaborated: this 10% rate was naturally a standardized levy. As long as operators cooperated, the actual collection burden wouldn't necessarily exceed current expenses. After deducting the 3,400 taels that went to the national tax, the remaining revenue from this surcharge went entirely to the Guangzhou Municipal Government. From now on, the police stations responsible for registration and the tax offices responsible for collection would handle everything. Anyone else extending their hand—strongmen, gentry, yamen runners—would be prosecuted for extortion.

This was nothing more than having the government seize the revenue stream from local powerbrokers—after all, local strongmen and powerful lords weren't protected by the Council of Elders' laws. Liu Xiang expressed no objection. Ai Zhixin went on to clearly explain the tax collection procedures, payment methods, penalty provisions, and so forth. Together with the police bureau's arrangements for registration, a complete "Guangzhou Vice Tax Management Regulations" was formulated.

As the meeting concluded, the conversation turned to current work priorities, which inevitably touched on Hong Huangnan. This fellow had been quite troublesome lately—he'd written a "report" demanding the municipal government hand over a large tract of land on Henan Island for logistical center construction.

"What do you think of this matter?" Liu Xiang asked.

"What kind of 'logistical center'? When the Henan Island land was replanned, his warehouse plot was already allocated. Not a small piece either—several dozen mu. Now he wants to be even greedier? I flatly refuse." The speaker was Elder Li Dongning, commander of the Guangzhou Garrison Area.

Li Dongning and Liu Xiang had a close working relationship. Although Hong Huangnan's logistical command nominally served the Bopo Army, for units stationed in Guangzhou, they actually came under the Garrison Command. Which meant Hong Huangnan wasn't Li Dongning's direct superior—Hong Huangnan issued "orders" and he more or less ignored them.

Liu Xiang nodded. Hong Huangnan wasn't an easy person to deal with. Because of his distinguished service, many Elders knew him, and he'd cultivated a wide network of contacts. At Wudaokou, getting things done without friction often meant having to accommodate him somewhat.

The most troublesome aspect was that Hong Huangnan's "report" demanded that in addition to the already-allocated few dozen mu on Henan Island, another several hundred mu be allocated for a "transport hub." This involved not just urban planning but, more importantly, land.

Even after the Council of Elders pacified Guangzhou, publicly-owned land within the urban area—excluding state property—was actually quite limited. Guangzhou had been a major city for centuries, thoroughly penetrated by private property. Land with clear title couldn't be easily confiscated. Traitor property, abandoned land, and unclaimed land that had been confiscated was in high demand. Various organs were all requesting allocations. The municipal government had to plan urban construction, which also required reserving public land. It simply couldn't satisfy everyone.

Now Hong Huangnan was requesting a "land grab"—if his request were granted, it would set a precedent. The Propaganda Department, the Education Department, the Finance Ministry, the National Army Garrison... every agency had reasons to request land. And they all had Elders in charge with their own connections. If each came requesting "special consideration," Liu Xiang would become nothing more than a land distribution clerk.

"I'm definitely refusing this," Liu Xiang said. "Following Standard Operating Procedure—if he has requirements, he can apply to the municipal government planning department. If it's in the plan and there's available land, it'll be allocated. If not, we'll consider alternatives."

"But Lao Hong isn't easy to offend," someone said.

"He'll just have to be offended then. This favor isn't mine to give—what if someone else comes asking tomorrow?"
