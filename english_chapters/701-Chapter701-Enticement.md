# Chapter 701 - Enticement

"You've really got something there!" Zheng Bao slapped Wang You heavily on the shoulder. "We'll do it your way. Find an opportunity as soon as possible to establish a connection with that Shi fellow. Whatever silver he wants is no problem! We'll even make him a commander of three flotillas and give him seven or eight ships to lead! If he wants to be an official, we'll get the Lê dynasty to grant him a high title—even higher than his Australian rank!"

"This is just one move among many," Wang You said gravely. "Boss, all these approaches are merely sidelines! If we don't have to take them, it's better not to."

"What do you mean?" Though Zheng Bao looked impatient, he still pressed for answers.

"The best strategy is still to ally with the Australians." Wang You explained, "The Australians are now a formidable force, seemingly capable of rivaling even Boss Zheng. It's better to befriend them than make enemies of them."

Wang You repeatedly emphasized to Zheng Bao that the Australians were absolutely not to be trifled with. Once enmity was established, their strength would likely be insufficient to oppose them. It would be better for both sides to maintain peace.

"...Even if we have to give them more benefits—even if we acknowledge them as our leader—it wouldn't matter. With an Australian hat on our heads, wouldn't it be even more convenient when we act? At worst, if we can't wear this hat anymore, we'll simply raise our own banner again."

Zheng Bao silently considered this for a long while. Finally, he slapped his thigh.

"Damn it, let's do it that way. I'll learn from Han Xin!" He said to Wang You, "Advisor! I'll listen to you on this matter. However, we absolutely cannot accept the Australians' terms."

"Of course, of course—if we agreed, wouldn't all our men and ships become theirs?"

"Exactly. We need to keep this capital firmly in our own hands." Zheng Bao turned to Jin Caifa. "Afa! You'll need to make a few more trips."

"No problem, whatever the Boss commands!"

"Go tell that Haiyang fellow that I, Zheng Bao, am willing to acknowledge them as our leader—of course, we'll fly their flag. When we take plunder or ransom, we'll immediately give them a third of the cut. When they take plunder, we won't demand anything. With that said," Zheng Bao continued confidently, "we won't need their provisions. However, if our brothers ever need to anchor at Lingao to repair our ships or anything like that, they'll have to accommodate us."

After saying this, Zheng Bao added another condition: "But make it clear to them that we'll 'respond to the call but not report for duty.' They shouldn't think they can casually order us brothers around to fight their wars. Whether we fight together, and whom we fight—everything must be agreed upon by our brothers first."

"Very well," Jin Caifa said. "I'll set out tomorrow."

"No rush, rest for two days first," Zheng Bao replied. "If we're too eager, we'll look desperate—with our hundred-odd ships sitting here, the Australians' ships won't dare sail around carelessly either, right?"

He then turned to Wang You: "If this still doesn't work, we'll bring that Shi fellow over to our side and give them a good thrashing! Let them know what we're made of! Just because they have a few fast ships doesn't mean they can dominate the seas!"

"Very well." Wang You dared not suggest that if negotiations failed, they should immediately flee rather than seek death by fighting. "The Boss has considered everything thoroughly. Truly meticulous thinking."

"Advisor Wang, how confident are you that you can convince Shi Fourteen to defect?" Jin Caifa asked Wang You inside the cabin.

"About fifty-fifty." Wang You replied, "Shi Fourteen has been with the Australians for quite some time. I don't know how well he's doing there. If he's doing well, it will be very difficult."

In Wang You's estimation, he didn't even have fifty-fifty odds—at most twenty or thirty percent. If it had been shortly after Shi Fourteen first joined the crop-heads, convincing him probably wouldn't have been difficult. But now that he'd risen to a certain level among the Australians, persuading him to start anew would be extremely challenging.

"Looking at his appearance, he doesn't seem like much. He's wearing the same coarse cloth clothes as the crop-heads. Back when we brothers went into battle, even a junior assistant would have a silk garment to wear!"

Wang You snorted with laughter and tapped Jin Caifa's head: "You've got a head for nothing! What do a few clothes matter? Didn't you see that even the Australians' top leaders wear coarse cloth? Maybe in Australia, only the rich and powerful wear plain cloth, while ordinary people can only wear silk and satin!"

"To convince Shi Fourteen, the only way is to promise him a fortune. Then there might be some hope!" Wang You said. "It all depends on how much silver the Boss is willing to spend."

Although Zheng Bao had said "whatever silver he wants is no problem," Wang You knew the old camp's treasury held only about ten thousand taels. At most, they could produce two or three thousand. Whether this would be enough to sway Shi Fourteen was uncertain.

---

Wang You made up his mind: "This matter—I'd better handle it myself."

"You're going personally?"

"Yes. After all, I was once Boss Zhu's old camp manager. That Shi Fourteen should at least give me some face—even if the talks fail, he won't turn hostile."

Wang You discussed matters privately with Zheng Bao. They agreed he would first go to Hong Kong Island for negotiations under the pretense of offering allegiance. Then, during the bargaining process, he would find a way to get onto Shi Fourteen's ship for secret discussions.

After resting for two days, Jin Caifa set out with the delegation again. This time his entourage was much larger—over forty people. They also brought a two-masted rice boat loaded with pigs, sheep, wine, and other provisions for the troops. Zheng Bao had truly spared no expense: from his collection of gold and silver treasures, he selected a dozen or so valuable jewels as gifts for Chen Haiyang and his colleagues, and picked out additional jewels as introductory gifts for Wang You to bribe Shi Fourteen.

Chen Haiyang once again received the delegation. After listening to a cartful of flattering remarks, he still couldn't figure out what Jin Caifa's purpose was. After talking for quite a while longer, he finally realized that Jin Caifa was actually bargaining with him.

The pirates' demands were simply that their forces not be split up and must remain united. Furthermore, they wanted to "respond to the call but not report for duty." Chen Haiyang had never understood what this pretentious phrase actually meant. But eventually he grasped it: the pirates wanted to maintain maximum independence. Zheng Bao's proposal was essentially a loose alliance, or simply an agreement to raid and divide spoils together.

Chen Haiyang naturally wouldn't agree to such terms. Although this operation in the Pearl River Estuary was meant to create as much impact as possible, he didn't want the Australasian Song's reputation to be ruined by a gang of pirates. He ultimately rejected Zheng Bao's proposal.

While both sides were haggling, Wang You had already slipped ashore among the attendants carrying gifts. He took this opportunity to note the hull number of Shi Fourteen's ship and observed the surrounding terrain and sentries.

Only upon closer inspection did Wang You discover that many of the Australian ships, though similar in appearance to the common Guang ships and Fu ships of the area, had actually all been refitted and modified. Gun ports had been cut into the hulls, and cannons installed below deck. Wheel-like devices had been mounted on the stern castles. Moreover, each ship's masts had been fitted with many small accessories he couldn't comprehend. At first glance, they somewhat resembled the red-haired ships.

The sailors aboard all wore blue-and-white short jackets, looking both clean and spirited—even more uniform than the government troops. They appeared well-trained. What surprised him most was that all sailors were constantly busy: if not scrubbing the decks or tidying the rigging, they were drilling on deck. Every ship was unbelievably clean and orderly. Such strict discipline was something he had never witnessed before.

"The Australians are truly extraordinary!" Wang You marveled silently. No wonder Boss Zhu had suffered such heavy losses yet still refused to go to war with them—he had his reasons! Thinking of this, he began to miss Zhu Cailao even more, and his contempt for Zheng Bao deepened.

Contempt aside, the plan to convince Shi Fourteen still had to proceed. Otherwise, he would have no way to explain things to Zheng Bao.

The relationship between Wang You and Zheng Bao was one filled with pressure. Zheng Bao didn't trust Wang You, and Wang You knew this. So he was even more cautious around Zheng Bao, constantly trying to gauge his thoughts and speaking according to his wishes, not wanting to strain their relationship. But this very cautiousness made Zheng Bao even more distrustful, believing Wang You was always holding something back.

This suspicion had grown increasingly severe recently, forcing Wang You to take countermeasures.

However, after observing for a long time, he found the Australians' defenses extremely tight. All ships not at the dock were anchored in a certain formation, with layer upon layer of guards from outside to inside. The outermost layer consisted of patrolling rowboats. Every ship had lookouts fore and aft, constantly monitoring the sea. Armed sentries were similarly posted beside ships moored at the jetties. There were also watchtowers. Judging from the firewood piles gathered on shore, these watches continued day and night. Even rowing a small boat at night to pay a secret visit would easily be detected.

Wang You decided to try his luck at openly getting aboard. Together with his attendants, he carried several baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables to the jetty and begged a hired local manning a small boat to ferry him to *Lint Special 51*.

"These fruits and vegetables are for the troops. We need to deliver them to each ship. Please help, brother." Wang You bowed and scraped, producing a small red envelope.

"Without a boat pass, you cannot use the small boats." The sentry leveled his musket horizontally. "As for these vegetables and such, they all need to go through logistics in a unified manner. You can't deliver directly to ships."

Wang You added another red envelope: "Please make an exception, young brother..."

"No means no." A glint of greed flashed in the hired local's eyes, making Wang You think there was hope. But it vanished in an instant. "If I took your silver, I'd be done for. Go on, leave!"

Wang You returned without success. He noticed several fishing boats approaching the bay, apparently trying to sell vegetables and fresh fish to the fleet. This seemed like a good opportunity. But he was quickly disappointed to discover that all fresh provisions were purchased through unified channels. Fishermen and vegetable vendors were not allowed near the large ships, let alone board them—they could only land at designated areas for inspection and trade.

So I'd have to swim to get on board? Wang You thought dejectedly. Swimming several *li* through a pitch-dark bay at night was beyond his swimming abilities. Besides, in the darkness, if he was shot by a sentry the moment he touched the ship's side, he'd be throwing away his life for nothing.
