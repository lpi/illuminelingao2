# Chapter 2188 - Fight Alone

"I don't think it's that simple. I've seen such people. Others get more capable as they fight, but they get worse and worse, and will soon be casualties in battle," Li Dong said, having experienced many battles and seen much. "The more afraid one is, the easier it is to make mistakes; mistakes lead to getting wounded."

"If he really gets injured, let's give him a conclusion of being physically unfit for service and discharge him."

"Alright. Let's do that. Hope he has that luck."

Early the next morning, just as the sky was turning pale, Li Dong was sleeping groggily when he was suddenly awakened by a burst of high-pitched, rapid bugle calls. He was startled; this was the signal for "Enemy Attack!"

He threw off the military blanket on his body and scrambled up, picking up his belt to tie around his waist while running toward the breastwork. The entire squadron in the camp was in chaos. Soldiers with disheveled clothes hurriedly put hats on their heads, dragging rifles and running to the designated positions of their squads.

Li Dong climbed onto the lookout tower built last night with earth excavated from the trenches. Luo Mao was already there. Seeing him come over, he immediately indicated the direction of the enemy situation.

"About three hundred men. Not government troops."

Li Dong picked up his telescope. The mountains around Shijian blocked the rising sun. As the sun rose higher, the dawn light crossed the mountain tops and dispelled the morning mist in the river valley, exposing the figures of the enemy troops secretly approaching under the cover of night. Countless men and horses gathered in front of the mountain pass; a slight count showed over three hundred. Follow-up personnel were still pouring into this small plain, seemingly endless. Looking closely, most of these people had no armor and flew miscellaneous colored flags. Weapons and clothing were chaotic—indeed not government troops.

"Look at the dust rising behind; there are follow-up troops."

"Quick, go to the town and report to Company Commander Wu!"

"Wuzhou Squadron, gather around me! Quick!"

"Rifle team, fall out!"

Shouts of commands rose and fell. Disheveled officers flew around, gathering the equally bleary-eyed National Army soldiers to form ranks.

*Could it be the stubborn Yang Family Village braves from yesterday coming again?* From the captives' confessions, they could indeed send this many people. But they suffered two defeats yesterday, losing nearly two hundred men. It was too late for them to retreat and rest; how could they continue to attack Shijian?

He observed the terrain. Their situation was very unfavorable now. The Wuzhou Squadron was isolated at Tangzaijiao in the absolute north. The right flank was mountainous terrain; the left flank was the 1st Squadron of the National Army Guangning Battalion, deployed along the Shijian Levee backing Banbian Gang (Half-Side Hill). The road in the middle was the junction of the two squadrons.

Li Dong knew very well that the Guangning 1st Squadron was a newly formed squadron with a small number of veterans and a large number of new recruits. Since there were far more new recruits than in the Wuzhou Squadron, their combat effectiveness couldn't be relied upon at all.

The Fubo Army 8th Battalion was concentrated in Shijian Town behind them, and the logistics column and civilian personnel were concentrated at Tougang (Head Hill) where the Sui River turned.

"Letting us take the lead at the front, what is Battalion Commander Yang thinking..." Luo Mao whispered.

"Don't talk! Pay attention to observation."

Li Dong interrupted his subordinate's complaints. He knew very well: Yang Zeng's deployment was standard practice in defensive warfare: weaker troops were deployed on the first line to absorb the enemy's attack kinetic energy; when the enemy's attack was delayed by first-line troops and lost momentum, the elite troops of the second line would then launch a counterattack.

It sounded like a brilliant tactic, but the troops absorbing "kinetic energy" on the first line wouldn't be so relaxed. Often they suffered heavy casualties, sometimes even total annihilation.

*Speaking of which, we National Army are still "cannon fodder."* Li Dong felt uncomfortable inside. He hurriedly expelled this thought of "less than absolute loyalty" from his mind and shouted the order: "Messenger! Go contact the Squadron Leader of the 1st Squadron, tell him to watch the junction well to avoid a central breakthrough by the enemy!"

After speaking, he put down the telescope and suddenly saw Ai Buyi shrinking under the lookout tower, looking outside with a nervous face. He shouted scolding: "You! What's the matter! Why don't you go to your own squad?"

"Re... port..." Ai Buyi's articulation was unclear. "I, can't find the squad leader..."

Li Dong looked around. Ai Buyi's squad was deployed on the right flank near the mountains. He pointed the direction: "Just over there, go quickly!"

Ai Buyi acknowledged, picked up his rifle, and was about to run. Li Dong suddenly thought that his messenger had just walked away; in case of need, he had to have someone by his side to dispatch. This Ai Buyi wouldn't be of much use in the squad either. So he called him back: "You! Don't go back. Follow by my side!"

Li Dong came to a place near the left flank junction to prevent the enemy from breaking through the center. He saw Ai Buyi not far away, holding the rifle tremblingly, looking like he lost his soul. He shouted loudly: "When I inspect later, no things are allowed to remain in the gun barrel!"

After speaking, he turned his gaze to the armed forces gathering a *li* away—there were already more than five hundred people now. These suddenly appearing enemies only held some simple swords and spears in their hands; no firearms were seen. Their formation wasn't neat either; unknown if they feared the "Hair men's" repeating guns, they stood very sparsely. Overall, they seemed to be composed of many small groups, but coordination between groups wasn't strong. Some waited impatiently and rushed forward a distance, then went back seeing others didn't follow.

Luo Mao suddenly appeared at this time: "Squadron Leader! I think this gang looks like Yao people!"

"How do you know?"

"A new recruit said so. He is a *Lang* person (Zhuang) and fought Yao people before!"

"The clothes don't look like it..."

"There are Han people inside too, probably bandits. He said when Yao people rebel, they sometimes act together with Han bandits."

"Doesn't matter who they are; those attacking us are enemies." Li Dong drew his command sword and shouted, "All squads, steady! No shooting without orders!"

This group of enemies was definitely not a number that their two squadrons of over two hundred men could solve. Battalion Commander Yang wanted them to "defend firmly and await reinforcements," so they could only die defending here. Waiting for the Fubo Army behind to launch a counter-charge.

"Afraid there will be a fierce battle today," he said to Luo Mao.

"At worst, throw a small life away here," Luo Mao smiled, obviously not thinking he would lose his life. But Ai Buyi beside him didn't think so, trembling terribly all over.

Li Dong had no heart to scold Ai Buyi. As a commander, the only hope was that the Fubo Army's counterattack would come a bit faster; otherwise, his brothers would inevitably suffer "heavy casualties." He looked somewhat nervously at the constantly arriving enemies more than a *li* away.

Fortunately, the enemy hadn't made up their mind to launch an attack yet. Just when both sides were in a standoff and the situation was on the verge of breaking out, a change occurred—seeing the multitude of enemies, the Guangning 1st Squadron on their left flank actually took it upon themselves to withdraw from Shijian Levee, retreating toward Banbian Gang, attempting to rely on Shijian's stockade wall to fight and get fire support from the Fubo Army in town. As a result, the entire left flank of the Wuzhou Squadron was exposed to the enemy.

"Who the hell let them retreat!" Li Dong saw this and almost died of anger. "Ai Buyi! You chase after them, find their Squadron Leader, and tell them to come back!"

Ai Buyi chased after them. Li Dong shouted: "All units! Steady! Prepare to shoot!"

"Let's withdraw too!" Luo Mao was a bit worried. "Retreat to Banbian Gang and form a line with 1st Squadron."

"With 1st Squadron withdrawing, we became the 'Rearguard'," Li Dong smiled bitterly. "Now if I say withdraw, do you believe the whole squadron will cut and run?"

The 1st Squadron could retreat in good order because there were friendly forces behind them, not fearing enemy pursuit. Behind them, however, was nothing. Soldiers had no psychological sense of security. Once the enemy charged, the whole squadron would probably collapse.

"This bodes ill then." Luo Mao fixed a bayonet to his rifle. "I'll take a squad to the left flank."

"Good, go. Don't throw your small life away..."

Li Dong walked along the breastwork, shouting loudly to encourage the soldiers to "hold the position." But facing the huge pressure of being outnumbered, people couldn't help but want to escape. The entire battle line began to waver. And the Yao people also saw the wavering of the defense line. They didn't miss this opportunity. A sound of gongs and drums rang through the enemy array, and they immediately launched a full-line charge.

Rumbling footsteps resounded through the whole valley, but the rifle team stood immovable because they hadn't heard Li Dong's order yet. In Li Dong's eyes, even by National Army standards, the enemy's formation was too loose. The originally sparse column was dragged even more open once they started running. Moreover, they actually launched the charge while still a *li* away from the breastwork; halfway through, their speed slowed down.

"Steady... steady...!" The sergeants kept repeating Li Dong's order. At this time, the first volley of feathered arrows shot out from the enemy crowd.

"Hug the breastwork! Heads down!"

The National Army didn't have steel helmets and could only lower their heads tightly, leaning against the breastwork. This shielding tactic was very effective; no one was hit under the swishing rain of arrows.

Malay's head almost drilled into the earthen wall. He clutched the rifle in his hand tightly. The sound of arrows cutting through the air was terrifying, and the sound when they landed made him lose his soul even more. Especially when four or five feathered arrows nailed into the ground less than two *zhang* away from him almost simultaneously, he was almost scared out of his wits.

Fortunately, in the eight weeks of training, he had become accustomed to regarding discipline as a god and didn't dare move a bit. In just a moment, a second round of arrows fell one after another.

Li Dong shrank behind the breastwork observing the enemy's advancing pace. They weren't impatient at all; the main body spread out and slowly approached the breastwork, with archers behind shooting arrows in turns rank by rank. It looked like the command was quite methodical.

One hundred meters, eighty meters. When the enemy entered the fifty-meter range and the brothers of the 5th Squadron (Wuzhou) could strictly see the enemies' faces, they finally waited for the captain's order: "Sight 50 meters! Ready, aim!"

Amidst the unison shouting of commands by the NCOs, the rifle team impatiently aimed their loaded rifles at the enemy. The shorter second row extended their muzzles through the gaps of the front row to avoid deafening them with gunshots—at this distance, they could hit even with Nanyang-style accuracy. Li Dong glanced at Ai Buyi, drew his machete, and chopped down forcefully: "Fire!"
