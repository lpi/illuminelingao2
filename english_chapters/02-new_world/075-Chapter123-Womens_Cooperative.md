# Chapter 123: Women's Cooperative

News of the transmigrators conquering the Gou Manor spread countywide within three days. Reactions from various quarters were extremely mixed. The gentry and major households were privately pleased that the universally despised, tyrannical Gou Xunyi was finished, yet they worried about the short-hairs' growing power. But commoners within dozens of *li* had received relief, and everyone was grateful and delighted. Distant commoners heard the news enviously, and rumors spread everywhere. Commoners, having benefited, constantly came to secretly reveal the details of other strongholds—some even volunteered as insiders, inviting attacks. Even small bandit groups came proposing "shared prosperity." The transmigrators received everyone warmly and recorded the information; as for attacks, they needed rest and were not currently offering this service.

Within a hundred *li*, no major household failed to send congratulatory gifts—even Huang Family Village sent pigs, sheep, and cloth. The transmigrators let bygones be bygones and accepted everything. They generously rewarded the envoys, having them spread the word: Bairren Fortress had opened a new market, and everyone was welcome to trade—safety was guaranteed, and there were no fees. Dongmen Chuiyu tirelessly toured envoy after envoy around the East Gate Market, showing them the streets under construction and red brick buildings rising...

Pirates opening markets for trade—that was truly novel! Lingao had few markets; the entire county totaled fourteen. Even the county seat had only a simple County Gate Market. Now, Bairren Rapids had produced the East Gate Market! Major households heard reports from returnees that the market scene was not inferior to other places. The short-hairs themselves purchased heavily daily, and recently, they were openness buying grain at high prices! Many large-stock grain holders were tempted, joining the grain sales queues. Daily grain arrivals made Cheng Dong stamp his feet in anguish—silver was flowing out in torrents!

After intense preparations, the transmigrators' first business—a salt shop—opened amid crackling firecrackers. Since the merchant hall wasn't built yet, this salt shop was just a simple bamboo shack. Behind the counter were piled sacks of Ma'ao salt, sold in 50-gram units, both wholesale and retail, at prices one-third below the market rate.

Initially, sales were negligible. But as traders spread the word that the East Gate Market had cheap salt, people from everywhere rushed to buy. Sales soared—especially among small salt peddlers, who flocked enthusiastically, buying by the basket. Previously, the salt fields were monopolized by Landlord Gou, and salt was hard to get. The county's official salt was worse—bright salt turned muddy yellow and sandy through official hands, and prices were outrageous. Eventually, even the county yamen's cook came to buy—he didn't request invoices, though reimbursement was surely at official salt prices.

Encouraged by the salt shop's success, the transmigrators' second store opened. This one was unique—not "state-owned" but a joint-stock company. Ownership wasn't collective but shareholder-based.

This stock company was engineered by Li Mei, from the Ming family of four. After settling in Bairren Fortress, this veteran of commercial battles grew restless. Her daughter-in-law now worked in public security; her old husband donned his badgeless Type-87 navy uniform daily, serving as the Military Group's naval advisor; and her son, though initially without an official position, at least worked outside daily. She ended up helping Auntie Cao Shunhua at the cafeteria—something she found unacceptable! As a longtime businesswoman, she'd been planning to start some company—at minimum, to open a shop.

Opening shops was child's play for the Li Mei of the old timeline—she had capital and channels. But here, the family had nothing beyond their luggage. The transmigrators themselves had no products to sell. As the saying goes, even a clever wife can't cook without rice. So she waited for opportunities. Li Mei firmly believed that opportunities for fortune existed in any timeline—you just had to seize them.

When the transmigrators opened Li minority trade relations and struck it rich at the Gou Manor—when the East Gate Market took shape—Li Mei knew that her opportunity had arrived.

The Planning Committee had brought countless spoils from the Gou Manor—from porcelain and furniture to clothing. These items needed disposition—conversion to usable cash and grain. Here was her source of merchandise.

The next problem was how to turn that source into store inventory. She had no money. This didn't trouble her. After some whispering among the women she'd met in the cafeteria, Li Mei returned to her simple housing, dressed in her old business suit from her deal-making days, and switched to half-heeled pumps. She washed her face and carefully combed her hair, instantly transforming from a cafeteria auntie into a businesswoman.

She headed straight to the Committee headquarters, cornered Wen Desi, and explained her shop idea.

"Open a shop?" Wen Desi was confused. "We're not mass-producing industrial goods yet. There's nothing to sell."

"There are goods—the seized items from the Gou Manor. Those clothes, daily goods, and ordinary furniture are mostly used. They can't be bulk sold. I propose purchasing on the company's behalf, then retailing them."

Wen Desi suddenly thought this woman was somewhat unrealistic. Just selling secondhand goods? Her company purchasing—with what money? He knew Old Ming's wife had managed a trading company and probably had substantial assets—but RMB wealth (whether brought or not) was worthless here.

"What do you purchase with? And company? I don't recall establishing any company."

"The company is right here." Li Mei produced a paper covered with writing. "This is the company formation agreement. Technically, we should register with industry and commerce first—but Dongmen Chuiyu didn't know if he had authority for that. So I'm showing you."

Wen Desi looked: it declared that these individuals voluntarily invested to establish the "Hainan Women's Cooperative Corporation," whose scope of trade included daily sundries, food service, hardware, etc. Below stood the share allocation ratios and signatures from a dozen-plus women—apparently almost all female transmigrators, including the usually unassuming Auntie Cao.

"But what's your capital? Everyone's on the supply system now—there's no money."

"Director Wen, I recall all registered transmigrators receive salaries—"

Wen Desi smiled bitterly—he'd forgotten this entirely. With nowhere to spend salaries, few remembered this income. But this accidentally involved outsider remembered clearly.

"These shareholders invested using their accumulated voucher income. Surely the Committee won't deny these RMB-equivalent vouchers have purchasing power—"

"Well—" Wen Desi naturally couldn't deny this; otherwise, everyone would immediately revolt. He struggled: "But we've only paid three months' wages. This amount as capital can't possibly purchase all this."

"We'll purchase a portion first—then use sales proceeds for turnover." Seeing Director Wen's expression turning sour, Li Mei quickly added, "The first batch uses vouchers for purchase. Future restocking from the Committee would settle in vouchers, work points, and gold, silver, and copper together."

"Good—that works." Wen Desi finally relaxed. "But since you're selling to locals, you won't receive new vouchers."

"Actually, many items can be sold to comrades too. I know, I know—" she stopped Wen Desi before he spoke, "—our organization is currently supply-based. But non-necessities can absolutely be bought with vouchers—otherwise, what's the point of vouchers? Just days ago, I heard someone wanted to buy a console table for their room. Surely the Committee won't issue that? Also, if more working capital is needed, I plan to issue company bonds—with Committee approval, of course."

"Bonds—we'll discuss later." Wen Desi thought: you're really planning a commercial Great Leap. "Stock companies are a good idea. I personally agree. But the Committee must discuss it before officially responding."

"One more thought." Li Mei added negotiating leverage. "This company could be a public-private joint venture. The Committee could invest on behalf of all the transmigrators—holding partial shares, say 20%."

"Hmm, that's not bad." Wen Desi began listening seriously.

"This portion's proceeds could fund everyone's dividends, welfare expenses—even future Committee administrative costs—" she spoke leisurely, watching Wen's expression, "—think about it: the supply system is abnormal. Once established, salary systems will come. Then everyone will care about income. Having extra cash to distribute—everyone would be pleased."

"But the Committee can't issue more vouchers." Wen Desi frowned. "Vouchers are virtual currency—just adding numbers to everyone's accounts monthly. Their value is hard to estimate. That's one issue. Another: the Committee has no vouchers to invest."

"As for the value calculation—we'll work it out. We have economists here; they should find solutions. As for the Committee having no vouchers—that's no problem at all." Li Mei smiled cunningly, revealing her true purpose. "Invest with goods."

Wen Desi was startled: you're pulling an "empty-handed wolf catch"! So Li Mei had nothing—completely trading thin air for thin air. But he couldn't find grounds to refuse—she'd cornered the Committee on voucher value recognition.

The company proposal quickly passed. Besides the public-private concept, the Finance and Commerce Departments supported it. Cheng Dong thought this could recover vouchers—everyone's long-accumulated massive voucher balances suddenly entering circulation would otherwise cause severe inflation.

Du Wen was especially supportive—turns out this joint venture company, besides 20% collective transmigrator ownership, gave her constantly advocated Women's Federation 5% shares (though it hadn't yet formed). The biggest beneficiary was Li Mei herself: despite having zero vouchers, as manager she received 12% shares—voted by the shareholders' general meeting.
