# Chapter 170: Armed Procession

News that the "bald bandits" had bivouacked nearby spread quickly to surrounding villages. Obviously, over two hundred fully armed, artillery-equipped soldiers weren't just touring the countryside. Before dark, villages within ten *li* sent envoys carrying wine, dried meat, chickens, and ducks.

"I was just about to summon them, and they've delivered themselves." Xi Yazhou had a clear mandate from the Executive Committee: pacify the roadside villages and secure their allegiance.

The headquarters tent had a radio installed and a laptop computer displaying Xi Yazhou's beloved wargame—now converted into an operational simulation system. Outside, two soldiers frantically pedaled a dual-person generator.

Xi Yazhou sat on a folding canvas chair in front of the headquarters tent. Behind him fluttered two red-yellow triangular pennants on flagstaffs—his personal command flag. The official flag of the transmigrator army remained a subject of heated debate. Watching the bent-backed elders in their best clothes shuffle toward him through the camp gate... this feeling of power was rather enjoyable.

Through three interpreters—for Lingao dialect, military dialect, and Qiongzhou dialect—Xi Yazhou explained that they were merely passing through and would depart at dawn. The gifts were politely refused. Unexpectedly, this refusal made the elders weep. They knelt, desperately pleading, practically hugging his legs.

"What's happening?" Xi Yazhou was puzzled.

Translator Xiong Buyu was equally confused—why did a harmless announcement produce this reaction? After much questioning, it emerged that the elders had assumed "rejection of gifts" meant "dissatisfaction"—implying imminent extortion or worse. All of them began wailing about their villages starving to death.

"Fine, accept the wine." Xi Yazhou half-laughed, half-sympathized with the commoners' plight. "Keep the dried meat and poultry. Send fresh vegetables and eggs instead."

Hearing Xi Yazhou's request, the elders rose as if pardoned from execution. The villages then jointly presented "Chief Xi" with fifty *liang* of silver. Xi Yazhou firmly refused this time. The refusal earned him genuine praise: "The General is incorruptible," "The Chief is pure and selfless." Xiong Buyu translated a few comments—then stopped bothering.

Xi Yazhou, his face stern, announced that per Executive Committee policy, all villages must send representatives to Bairren Fortress by the thirtieth day of the first month, Chongzhen Year 2, to discuss "bandit suppression" matters. Lateness would be treated as "bandit collaboration."

"Everyone knows what happened to the pirate-colluding Gou Manor." Xi Yazhou glared menacingly. "We came to Lingao, saw the people suffering and bandits running rampant. We organized a militia for 'Eliminating tyranny, Protecting borders, Securing the people'—maintaining peace on behalf of the Court. Non-cooperators oppose all the people of Lingao. Opposing the people of Lingao means opposing the Court. Opposing the Court makes you rebel traitors! Anyone has the right to execute them!" He slashed his hand downward. "As for the villages absent today—you notify them."

The kneeling crowd was confused. These "bald bandits" were pirates themselves—yet they claimed to be acting "for the Court"? Confusion aside, the bloody legend of Gou Manor, embellished through countless retellings, had become a horror story. Nobody dared say "no"; they only murmured assent, secretly relieved their villages had wisely sent representatives.

Xi Yazhou also required each village to send one liaison to accompany the forces, plus mountain guides. Only then were they dismissed.

"Every village sent someone?" Xi Yazhou asked Xiong Buyu, checking off map-marked villages.

"Within ten *li*, all came. Within fifteen *li*, three came."

Xi Yazhou smiled confidently. "After we handle Baitu—more villages will come."

"Why summon them to Bairren?" Xiong Buyu was curious.

"Conscription and requisitions." Xi Yazhou studied the terrain map. "In Lingao county, we have no real opponents. The next step is utilizing local manpower and resources. Chief Ma wants to seize the county seat and install himself as magistrate. But Commissar Wen prefers to 'encircle the cities from the countryside'—use force to pressure villages, building our administrative network first. The county seat itself is irrelevant."

"The county seat does seem pointless. It's just a *yamen*. We can occupy it trivially whenever we want."

"Exactly. The people are fundamental."

"Report—Navy Commander Chen has arrived!"

Tomorrow the mountain march would begin. The Navy support flotilla couldn't resupply the Army until they reached Baitu. Xi Yazhou coordinated with flotilla commander Chen Haiyang. Both decided: advance separately tomorrow. The Army would reach Baitu's perimeter by 3:00 p.m. Then—issue a surrender demand to the villagers. If that failed, Xi Yazhou would fire three red rockets—and the *Fubo* would bombard Baitu harbor. If successful, one green rocket. With the recruited firecracker craftsman, signal rockets were now feasible, though modern signal flares were not.

They established various communication signals and contingency plans. Past 6:00 p.m., Chen Haiyang rowed back to the *Fubo*, declining Xi Yazhou's dinner invitation but taking the Navy's share of vegetables and eggs. Xi Yazhou was certain the *Fubo* had better food. This irked him—especially as he watched his orderly bring steaming rice noodle soup.

Dinner: Grassland-3 and -4. The former was rice noodle wrappers; the latter was rice vermicelli. Boiled until soft—with complete seasoning packets: salt, dried scallion, pepper. Unfortunately, there was no chili—otherwise, chili oil would have perfected it. The nearby villagers' vegetables and eggs enriched the soup.

The taste was quite good—it just lacked fat. Xi Yazhou again witnessed the local farmers' appetites: one soldier ate nearly three *jin* of rice noodles before stopping.

The officers' soup had sliced luncheon meat. The power of frugal traditions was on full display—one 125-gram can was split between two people. The cutter had to slice precisely equal portions. In the end, even the can's inner fat residue was rinsed clean with hot soup.

"Who knew luncheon meat would become such a delicacy!" Dongmen Chuiyu sipped his rice noodle soup. The luncheon meat made the broth richer, adding layers of spiced flavor. Far better than plain seasoned soup. Grassland-3 and -4 seemed fine—the drawback was fat deficiency. Without luncheon meat, the plain seasoning packets were bland.

He noted his impressions of the rations in his notebook. Walking outside to stretch, he kicked something that went *clanging* away. Looking closely, he saw an empty luncheon meat can.

"Such waste! Who did this?" Dongmen Chuiyu was outraged. Tinned steel plate was beyond the Industrial Department's current capability. In the cafeteria's daily cooking, cans, vacuum foil bags, and plastic bags were all carefully washed clean and returned to the Planning Committee warehouse. He searched and collected all the discarded cans, then rushed to headquarters to report to Xi Yazhou. That evening, all officers received an order: used cans must be washed clean and collected.

Artillery Training Battery Commander Ying Yu was on the mountain march. His uniform was soaked with sweat. Was this really winter? He paused, sipping salted water from his canteen and surveying the winding mountain path.

Dense forest obscured the column. The terrain wasn't steep, but the going was rough. Ying Yu assessed his unit: Army Artillery Training Platoon—three 12-pounder mountain howitzers. The cannons were disassembled for mule transport. A standard 12-pounder howitzer required three mules: the first carried the barrel, the second carried the frame and wheels, and the third carried two ammo boxes. Each box held eight shells: two explosive and six solid. Two boxes meant sixteen rounds. The normal combat load was forty-eight rounds per gun. But the transmigrators didn't have enough horses and mules. Even fielding just three guns consumed most of the Farm's horses. Wu Nanhai had demanded that Ying Yu guarantee all horses returned safely. He even sent Yang Baogui with the expedition for horse care, though Yang was allowed to ride the ships and avoid the foot march.

Several artillerymen passed Ying Yu. Like the infantry, they carried full gear and rifles. The sole exception was a fifteen-year-old kid without a rifle: a Military-Political School artillery cadet, skinny as a rail. Ying Yu had exempted him from carrying one.

"When will we have proper draft-animal transport?" Ying Yu sighed.

Behind the artillery came a dozen porters shouldering artillery gear. These were yesterday's village "liaisons." Xi Yazhou had prepared them for additional manpower and material needs, sending them back to arrange help. Ying Yu decided that since they were idle, they should assist carrying equipment to reduce the burden on the horses. Artillery simply had too much miscellaneous gear.

Bei Wei, with the Recon Team and guides, advanced several kilometers ahead—conducting screening and sweeping, clearing potential ambushes and observation posts. According to the guides, Baitu rarely contacted neighboring villages. They traded directly by ship—food, supplies, even shipbuilding timber came by sea. They lacked nothing and lived comfortably. Markets were held occasionally—often paying in foreign silver. Someone had spotted large foreign ships visiting Baitu.

Baitu, due to local bandit harassment, had stockades guarding the road junctions. As for maritime powers—they didn't attack. Pirates frequently bought and repaired ships there.
