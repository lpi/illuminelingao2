# Chapter 194: Business

Guo Yi thought: what costs? The first batch of goods were all Yiwu small commodities from *Fengcheng* vessel's hold and containers. Going forward would be mass-manufactured transmigrator industrial products. Costs were essentially negligible. His only discomfort was the slow capital recovery—under this settlement system, goods released during New Year wouldn't be collected until May. Currently their funds came from the 200,000 taels Gao Ju owed them—this money had to cover both Guangzhou advance station's establishment costs and continuous payments for massively procured materials. Slow collection was disadvantageous.

But he didn't need to explain this to Shen Fan. He just nodded. "You're right. Handling so many customers simultaneously would strain capital. So I have some other ideas."

"Please instruct, owner."

"Do Guangzhou's jewelry shops exchange goods with each other?"

"Naturally." Shen Fan thought this was common. Rare treasures were endlessly varied worldwide—no shop could stock everything. Even the biggest shops sought goods from trade associations.

"So some goods we can let colleagues handle." Guo Yi said. "Between colleagues exchanging goods, does three-festival settlement still apply?"

"No, local convention is three days. If not returned after three days, full payment is due." Manager Shen roughly understood his meaning. "Owner means—wholesale?"

"Correct." Guo Yi nodded.

"Fair enough. Though exchanging goods earns less, real money comes back faster. However—" Shen Fan looked slightly worried. "Does Purple Treasure Studio have enough goods to distribute? The Gao family is already wholesaling crystal mirrors on the market."

"Crystal mirrors are nothing." Guo Yi's tone was quite relaxed. "Let Gao Ju sell all he wants. I have even better things."

Manager Shen was startled. Crystal mirrors were nothing? He knew that at Fire God Temple's recent jewelry-trade exchange meeting, the Gao family's plainest black crystal mirrors had sold for 100 taels, retailing at 180 taels—extremely high prices. The Gao family could release only five to ten per session, completely unable to meet demand. Yet the owner casually said "nothing" and "even better things"—what could possibly be better?

"May I ask, owner, what treasures will Purple Treasure Studio deal in?" Manager Shen's curiosity finally burst out.

Guo Yi didn't answer but pulled aside the curtain behind him, revealing a huge cabinet.

This cabinet made Manager Shen gasp: except for the frame, the cabinet's exterior walls, doors, and shelves were all solid glass panels!

He'd seen plenty of glass. But such crystalline, seemingly invisible full glass panels—never before. Using so much glass to make a large cabinet—such magnificence, such craftsmanship—filled him with admiration.

"Owner—owner—" Even his speech stammered. "This—this is made of glass?"

"Of course." Guo Yi was very satisfied with Shen Fan's reaction. "Manager Shen, don't buy the box and return the pearl. Look at what's inside."

"Yes! Yes!" Shen Fan excitedly leaned forward. This was a sample display cabinet. There were four, all taken from *Fengcheng* vessel. Except for the newly made rosewood frames, the old glass had been re-polished with fine quartz sand and felt. By twenty-first-century standards, the transparency was mediocre, but in this spacetime, it was remarkable.

First catching his eye were rows of pearl necklaces, bracelets, and rings. The beads were not only large but perfectly round—rare top quality. There were even rare pink pearls. Shen Fan estimated these beads alone, sold separately, would fetch several hundred taels for the largest, three or four taels for the smallest.

Various small powder boxes—wooden, bamboo-carved, tortoiseshell, gold and silver inlaid—of many different materials. Nothing remarkable individually, but each box interior contained a small crystal mirror. Small, but still crystal mirrors.

Rows of glassware of every kind—cups, bowls, dishes, decanters, even tea sets. Each piece crystalline and translucent.

"Are these goods sufficient?"

"Sufficient! More than sufficient!" Shen Fan understood clearly: Australian merchants' treasures all sprang from glass. Glass itself wasn't particularly rare in Guangzhou. But their products were incomparably superior to anyone else's—whether Western or Frankish goods, the difference was like mud and clouds.

"Manager Shen, this is just part of the inventory." Guo Yi turned and drew the curtain closed. "More will come in the future." He produced a white notepad. "Please look."

Opening it, Shen Fan saw snow-white paper with black sketched designs, all jewelry. The styles were extremely novel. He'd spent his career with countless jewelry pieces, seen many master craftsmen. He'd never seen such style before. Examining closely: elegant and flowing, or splendid and dynamic, exquisitely crafted. These weren't ordinary craftsmen's work.

"This is—" Shen Fan asked with an inquiring look.

"Drawn by Yan Maoda." Guo Yi explained. "We're planning a batch for Miss Pei Lixiu at Purple Brilliance Tower. Do you have craftsmen who can make these?"

"Yes." Shen Fan answered without hesitation. Top jewelry craftsmen were specifically maintained by shops, unavailable outside. But he had good information—knowing a Baohengxiang shop had just closed, its dispersed craftsmen and clerks currently unemployed.

"Good. Your responsibility is recruiting them all." Guo Yi thought a moment. "Clerks too, as long as they're reliable. Treatment follows their previous standards."

"Owner, right now Purple Treasure Studio has just one shop. We already have two young assistants. Taking more people—isn't that too many?"

"Not too many. I have more businesses to open. Keep these people in reserve. It's just a few more mouths to feed." Guo Yi thought: *I'll have many more commercial enterprises—need to stockpile professionals now or they won't be available later.* Unlike the modern era's fast talent mobility, here skilled people typically worked at one shop for life unless circumstances forced otherwise. Except for apprentices and laborers, finding qualified people on demand was nearly impossible.

"Owner's foresight!"

"Tomorrow find some masons. Prepare to build new buildings."

"Owner, building construction is easy. But what for?" In Shen Fan's view, Purple Treasure Studio's premises were already adequate. More buildings seemed pointless.

"I'm building workshops." Guo Yi replied.

"Workshops?" Shen Fan's heart stirred. He lowered his voice. "Owner—you're planning to make crystal mirrors here?"

Before Guo Yi could answer, Shen Fan was already shaking his head. "Owner, you mustn't! Opening a crystal mirror workshop in Guangzhou—this city has many powerful households connected to officials. You're an outsider. Someone might plot to steal your secret techniques. An innocent man in possession of jade—that's his crime."

Guo Yi nodded. This spacetime's people's sincerity touched him. "Nothing like that!" He spoke firmly, reassuringly. "How would I manufacture crystal mirrors? Even in my country, this is a secret. How could I produce them?" He explained the plan: shipping semifinished blanks for local processing. "Would this work?"

"That would work." Shen Fan relaxed. If only importing mirror blanks for framing, it was essentially the same as complete imports—no trouble-attracting.

"Also assistants. There must be many unemployed clerks and craftsmen in the city. Go out and carefully find some. Just need honest and reliable people willing to come."

"This?" Shen Fan hesitated. "Owner, as the saying goes, different trades are like different mountains. Clerks are fine, but what use are craftsmen we don't need?"

"Manager Shen, do you think you're just Purple Treasure Studio's manager?"

Shen Fan was puzzled. "Owner—"

"We Australians crossed vast oceans traveling tens of thousands of *li* not just to sell a few jewelry and glassware pieces." Guo Yi tried to project kingly aura. "You're the general manager of the Purple Enterprise Group! No! The grand manager!"

Shen Fan was confused by his gibberish. Though he didn't fully understand "enterprise group" or "general manager," he understood "grand manager"—apparently the boss planned other businesses.

"This—owner—I only understand the jewelry trade. If you open other businesses, you'll need other managers. Different trades, different mountains."

"You're the grand manager. Specific affairs will have their own managers." Guo Yi considered Shen Fan a suitable candidate. First, Shen Fan owed them a great debt, and malaria tended to relapse—they alone had quinine. Second, as an old Guangzhou hand, the jewelry trade's special nature meant he was familiar with all kinds of people. Whether gathering information or handling matters, very convenient. Third, having spent his career in the jewelry trade, his professional integrity was probably sound.

"Thank you for owner's cultivation."

"These days, first find some distillers."

"Opening a distillery?" Manager Shen asked. "The water here isn't good—"

"Doesn't matter." Guo Yi wasn't planning to brew from grain anyway. "Are there shops selling crude liquor in Guangzhou?"

"Yes—in the city and many country distilleries."

"Negotiate prices for bulk purchasing."

"Alright." Manager Shen was now unsurprised by anything this owner said. "Should I buy distilling equipment too?"

"No need." Guo Yi was very enthusiastic about the branded liquor marketing plan. He'd received a telegram: the key component of the "new bottles for old wine" scheme—glass bottles—had been successfully trial-produced at Lingao.
