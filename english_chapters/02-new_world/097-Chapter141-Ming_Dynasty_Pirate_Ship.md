# Chapter 141: Ming Dynasty Pirate Ship

This was the transmigrators' first sea battle. The captured pirate ship gave them the opportunity to glimpse the actual equipment of late-Ming Chinese pirates—who had once dominated the southern coasts with fame reaching Southeast Asia. Shortly after docking, a multi-department joint inspection team—Military, Intelligence, Industrial, and Agricultural—arrived at Bopu by vehicle to examine the entire ship.

The Intelligence Group confirmed: this was definitely a "Guangzhou ship" type, indicating these pirates were from Guangdong rather than Yiguan's primary Fujian territory. This strongly implicated Liu Xiang's gang.

The hull embodied Guangzhou ships' traditional strength: extremely hard wood. Initially, nobody recognized it. Later, the Agricultural Group's Fa Shilu identified it as lychee wood—very hard indeed. In 1927, the Hainan Red Army had made all-wood muzzle-loading cannons from lychee wood. Without encountering the time-transcending SKS and M43 round combination, this era's common small cannons and firearms could barely penetrate it.

The ship carried sixteen cannons—difficult to classify precisely. By European standards, they were roughly four-to-eight-pounders. The casting was crude—mostly melted scrap iron. One was actually an iron-barrel wooden-structure design. Clearly, the casters knew nothing about cannon-making: the casting was so crude and the structure so primitive that—never mind bore polishing—just the countless air bubbles made the Mechanical Group's jaws drop. Using these in battle, you were more likely to kill yourself than your enemies.

The cannons were simply mounted on wooden frames, roped through hull ports. There were no aiming devices, no position-adjustment mechanisms. The only way to aim was to constantly reposition the ship, getting close enough. This explained the eight or more oars—besides extra propulsion, they provided rapid positioning.

Test firing showed that with the transmigrators' refined fine-grain powder, the largest eight-pounder could launch iron balls over five hundred meters. Higher angles meant greater distance—but crude construction limited powder charges. No battle shot exceeded two hundred meters—showing the pirates knew their cannon quality. Poor ammunition further reduced effective range: besides a few lead musket balls, the main projectiles were stones! Some small iron balls too. In 1840–1842, when Qing forts bombarded British ships in the Pearl River, despite "bullets raining," stone balls couldn't damage English oak hulls.

The shipboard powder was even worse. Pure powder form with excess sulfur. Test firing produced massive smoke but weak explosion. Comparatively, the powder captured in the First Anti-Siege Battle was best—clearly government arsenal quality. Gou Manor powder was slightly inferior. This pirate powder was apparently underground workshop self-made—probably sulfur-rich because nitrate was scarce.

Besides cannons, there were a dozen various matchlock muskets—some clearly Portuguese or Dutch, some local knockoffs—plus bird-guns and single-to-triple-barrel fire-tubes, probably from the Ming military. They were poorly maintained and looked unreliable. Even the Mechanical Group's famously fearless weapon enthusiasts dared not test-fire them. They estimated that even the best original Portuguese or Dutch matchlocks, with good ammunition, had effective range probably under fifty meters.

Cold weapons were richly abundant—some never seen before. The Intelligence Department assembled various historians for identification, finally sorting out this bewildering miscellany.

Most common were bamboo spears—bladed spearheads on bamboo shafts, five to six meters long. Quantities far exceeded the corpses found—interrogation later revealed that besides fighting, they were also used as javelins.

Another spear type was wooden and double-ended—for close combat. The pirates' most common cold weapon was a machete-style short waist-sword—only fifty centimeters total—with very sturdy blades.

The ship also had throwing plum darts, small darts, ship-grappling hooks, rake-hooks... everything imaginable. Finally: massive fishing nets and rawhide—for mounting on gunwales—blocking light projectiles and preventing boarding. These had been removed for the fishing boat disguise this time.

Incendiary weapons were common naval armament. Two types were found: bamboo-tube throwing torches—oiled blocks at bamboo tips, thrown like stick grenades when lit. Also various-sized clay pots filled with powder, sulfur, and ignition materials—concave tops for holding charcoal fire. Used by swinging from mast ropes onto enemy decks to shatter.

"Incredibly rich," Yu Eshui said, ignoring the blood stains congealing and stinking as he excitedly examined everything. "Just this stuff alone—I could write three or four papers. Core journals would be easy."

"You can even interrogate real seventeenth-century Chinese pirates. What historian could match your advantages!"

"Yes, yes." Yu Eshui didn't catch the teasing—still photographing and noting the miscellaneous scrap-iron debris.

Wu De sent Commune members to clear the corpses, scrubbing the decks with seawater and sand. By evening, the ship was spotless—except for the gunwale and deck bullet holes and shattered deck shelters, no battle traces remained.

Wu De, viewing the ship, felt uncomfortable. He was also navy background—now Commune Secretary! Such fishing-boat escort missions he'd done countless times in service—and Chen Haiyang, that frigate veteran, had stolen this one. Jealousy indeed!

Jealousy aside, duties continued. He inspected the offloaded items. The ship was nearly emptied—even the sails had been removed (completely shredded). Commune members still crouched on deck, meticulously prying lead bullets embedded in the wood with iron picks.

"We really are poor." He sighed. Lead wasn't remotely precious. Just look at ubiquitous debased Ming coins to know lead was a base metal. The Industrial Department's stinginess was necessity. Ancient mining and metallurgy—compared to the transmigrators' enormous appetite—was far too small. The planned New Army—once established—would need lead bullets for hundreds to thousands of firearms...

"Chief Wu—the Navy's transferring eighteen prisoners. How should we handle them?" Fu Youdi reported respectfully.

Fu Youdi had become a cadre again. Wu De appreciated his bullying-superiors, strict-with-subordinates style. After the East Gate Station's security crackdown ended, the perpetually anxious Fu Youdi—anxious about not becoming a leader—had been appointed Labor Reform Squad Leader.

"All to labor reform. Guard them strictly!" Wu De ordered. "The Security Group chiefs will interrogate anytime. Don't assign them too far."

"Yes."

The joint inspection concluded: the ship's construction was quite excellent. Best to repair it for use—whether for fishing or cargo—it was extremely valuable.

Damage was minor. The basic structure was intact—just too many bullet holes, with waves washing in. After inspection, the ship still had utility—worth repairing.

Repair meant hauling out—a complex matter, but unavoidable for ship repair and building. Per the Navy's preference, they should build a dry dock immediately. The Navy proposed excavating a simple dock at a sheltered Lingao Point cove—forty meters long, twelve meters wide, 2.4 meters deep. Stone-walled on all sides. Water drained. Ships would be repaired in this waterless dock. After repair, water would be refilled and the ship could sail out. Later, installing ship locks would make it usable for new construction as well.

The Planning Committee rejected this. Estimated investment was too large. The Construction Group proposed a simpler alternative: a simple slipway.

Simple slipways used wooden rails and abundant lubricants for water-to-drydock transitions. Advantages: simple equipment, easy operation. Low ground-pressure requirements—for ships under five hundred tons, just level ground, add gravel and ballast, roll flat. Simple structure meant easy assembly and disassembly. If relocation was needed, everything could be easily moved. Many domestic small and medium civilian shipyards used this method.
