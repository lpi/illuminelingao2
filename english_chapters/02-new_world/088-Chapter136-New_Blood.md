# Chapter 136: New Blood

After completing the full "Purification" process, they were housed in quarantine station dormitories. The dorms were gender-segregated—each with over twenty beds. There was a novelty: the beds were double-bunked. Those assigned to top bunks had to climb up. But everyone had individual beds—clean straw mattresses—plus a thin felt blanket. For children who had been sleeping rough for months, this was practically heaven.

They were also issued large ceramic cups and washcloths—actual towels required knitting machines that could not yet be produced. Toothbrushes, however, had entered production quickly: wooden-handled, with horse-hair bristles, hand-drilled and hand-bundled. The Industrial Department had been amazed—local women, working from just drawings and requirements, using the simplest hand tools, had made functional toothbrushes. Output was low—only twenty daily.

As for indispensable rinse cups and eating bowls—unfortunately, the brought supplies were limited. Fragile glazed ceramics had to suffice. And lacking stainless steel spoons—wooden-turned ones would have to work. Even these simplest daily goods could not be fully self-supplied due to material shortages.

The fierce maidservant assigned beds—younger ones below, older ones above. There were many rules: they could go outside, but only to the doorway clearing. No visiting neighboring dorms. Bowls and cups were personal—no sharing. Everything had to be placed on shelves in order... Everyone felt choked—so many rules in this place.

For discipline violators, the most effective punishment was simple: meal skipping.

"Mealtime!" As bells clanged outside, someone announced. Large lidded tin buckets delivered steaming food. The first meal was thick fish cake congee—minced fish cakes with vegetables. It was nutritionally complete. Everyone ate satisfactorily—but there were no seconds. Wu Nanhai feared overeating would upset their stomachs. However, three meals daily were provided from the start—to boost nutrition. The Medical Group knew: many epidemic diseases correlated with malnutrition.

During this forty-day quarantine observation period, they could not be idle—the transmigrators were not charity workers. Salt Field Village's night school sent two star graduates over for literacy and Mandarin teaching. Everyone received slate boards and chalk. Mornings: study. Afternoons: work. Bopu's rattan and wood factory sent simple handwork: processing rattan, weaving rattan ware, splitting bamboo, sanding wood boards. Children showing dexterity were recorded—this would guide future training decisions. Pre-dinner: free time for games. Post-dinner: cleaning, bathing, then mandatory sleep—the transmigrators did not provide dormitory lighting. But every nightfall, many children gathered at the chain-link fences—watching the flickering lights in the red buildings by the harbor.

For most children—like Tian Liang—current life was satisfactory. There was food, clothing, clean rooms, and no fleas. His scabies healed after several ointment applications. Though daily lessons and discipline constraints existed, these were tolerable.

Some older children—those grown wild from years of wandering—had zero interest in literacy and refused to learn the short-hairs' awkward neither-donkey-nor-horse Mandarin. Others simply could not tolerate the discipline. After several failed hunger punishments, the most stubborn were transferred to production team apprentice squads.

Tian Liang often wanted to check on Guo Fu in the girls' dormitory—but high bamboo fences separated them. The connecting gate was always locked. Even peering through the fence at the crowds on the opposite side—distinguishing Guo Fu was nearly impossible. Eventually, he gave up trying.

Ma Peng pushed a small wheelbarrow, creaking along field paths. On the cart: his family's sole possessions and his elderly mother.

"Peng'er, just going like this—will the short-hair masters accept us?"

"Ma, I've told you many times: family members—however many come—are accepted. Chief Wu personally said this."

"Ai, ai—you really... Why did you quit Mr. Fu's job! Mr. Fu treated us well."

"He treated us okay—but aren't the short-hairs better?" Ma Peng energetically pushed the cart. "Working for short-hairs: every meal has rice—*plus* fish! Does Fu Buer have that? During busy season he only gives sweet potato rice. Eat too much and his wife grumbles."

While talking, behind them came a carrying-pole team—baskets full of unhulled rice—hurrying toward Bairren Fortress.

"Ma, see—they're all going to East Gate Market to sell grain. These short-hair chiefs—they've got more money than there's water in the sea." Ma Peng smacked his lips proudly—working for short-hairs felt more respectable than laboring for the village landlord Fu Buer.

While chatting, the lead carrier turned around: "Young brother, also heading to East Gate? Taking your mother sightseeing?"

"I'm laboring for the short-hairs. Fetching my mother to come along."

The lead man laughed heartily: "Young brother has guts! Daring to work for them."

"Nothing to it—short-hairs aren't three-headed six-armed man-eating monsters. They're actually decent folk." He rambled about being captured along with Fu Buer, his post-capture experiences, and various other tales.

"...I figure—working for anyone's the same. At least short-hairs feed you well."

The man nodded: "Exactly so. Like our master—initially terrified of short-hairs. Then when he heard short-hairs were buying grain at good prices—his thoughts stirred. Rushed to deliver grain. Official autumn taxes he delays and stalls over. But here—sold once, now this is already the second trip."

"Rich folks just chase money."

Talking along the way, they reached East Gate Market. In barely half a month, it had already become bustling. Among clusters of bamboo sheds, red-brick buildings stood prominent. Grain sellers' carts and carrying poles formed long queues. Opposite stood the famous countywide "Welfare Society" shop—crowded with customers. Besides commoners, even landlord types browsed, bargaining with attractively blue-clothed women. Ma Peng had left nearly a month ago—now everything seemed fresh. He increasingly felt that returning had been the right decision—the short-hair chiefs were not leaving!

He parted from the grain-selling team—Ma Peng's destination was the production team camp outside South Gate by the Wenlan River. Passing construction sites, many unfamiliar people were building: not bamboo or rammed earth, but bright-red bricks. Ma Peng never imagined—this would become their home.

The Bairren Production Team's return rate was astonishing. Wu De had originally estimated that sixty to seventy percent would return after the harvest. Instead: over ninety-five percent returned—and many brought their families. Some hoping for better treatment had followed along uninvited. Combined: one hundred twenty percent of original numbers. This was better than their most optimistic estimates. The Committee was overjoyed—they had previously been unsure whether they could attract popular support. Apparently they had done well.

The migrants from Damei Village—now Wu De's designated "Bairren Production Team Two"—experienced their busiest harvest season ever. Men: logging, quarrying, digging, brick-firing. Women: spreading, winnowing, airing grain. Just the carrying teams delivering rice to the riverside mills flowed endlessly—Bairren Fortress now had over thirteen hundred mouths requiring 1.5 tons of rice daily. Ma Qianzhu had instructed that rice milling should produce only brown rice, not polished—this preserved nutrients while increasing yield. Older women helped in the kitchens. Even half-grown children worked in the fields. From first cock crow to nightfall—daily work exceeded twelve hours. But despite the exhaustion, the short-hairs' provisions were excellent! No cooking was needed—three hot meals were delivered directly to worksites: unlimited rice, meat and fish at lunch and dinner, substantial and oily. Such meals they had never seen, let alone eaten. Plus there were wages—though they came as colorful paper slips. Earlier Production Team One members had said these slips were valuable—they could buy rice, fish, and meat at the cafeterias. Those with elderly or children to support could feed their families on these work-point vouchers. So despite the heavy labor—there were no complaints.

Ma Qianzhu had come from large state enterprises—he was nostalgic for the SOE welfare model that extended benefits to workers' families. Seeing many women unable to work due to young children—wasted labor—he established the first nursery, freeing mothers for work. He recruited Fang Yijing—formerly a childcare teacher who had managed the transmigrators' dormitories; now the residential area committee director—as nursery director. First step: select women for basic childcare and hygiene training. Ma Qianzhu knew that changing long-term habits could not be forced. So he used economic incentives: families enrolling their toddlers would have the children's three meals provided by the cafeteria.
