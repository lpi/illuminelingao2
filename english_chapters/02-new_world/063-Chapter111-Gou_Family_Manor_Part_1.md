# Chapter 111: Gou Family Manor (Part 1)

While the salt-field work team was proceeding splendidly, preparations for the "hunting operation" to eliminate Landlord Gou were also underway. Xi Yazhou wanted it done as soon as possible—several villagers were still being held in Gou Manor's private prison. But the Committee wasn't in a hurry. After all, the salt villagers weren't their relatives. Everything needed thorough investigation first. After two or three days' investigation, the Committee learned this person was universally despised—even dogs hated him. "Local tyrant" described him perfectly. Eliminating him would satisfy everyone in the county. Though Landlord Gou hadn't actually provoked these transmigrators—at most using their reputation to scam people—the transmigrators urgently needed to demonstrate their righteousness while also improving their diet. Thus Landlord Gou's fate was sealed.

The direct reason for eliminating Landlord Gou was his attempt to control the salt field—but the Committee didn't directly assign this to the work team. Instead, a separate group was formed. The person in charge was Wu De, who'd long dealt with locals.

Wu De's production team had returned some bachelors—having no attachments, they'd just packed up their meager belongings. Long-term laborers simply quit their employers—who didn't dare refuse payment. Everyone knew these poor fellows now worked for the short-hairs. If they badmouthed employers to the short-hairs, trouble would follow.

Wu De selected several from these men, disguising them as peddlers and laborers to gather intelligence on Landlord Gou and county affairs. He wasn't idle either—he rode directly to the county seat.

At the South Gate, he encountered Inspector Fu. This Bopu Inspection Station inspector was the only person dissatisfied with the current situation—his office was gone, leaving him unable to account for anything. He'd been visiting Zhang Youfu constantly, begging him to negotiate with Bairren Rapids—return the station, and they'd split the gray income fifty-fifty.

Zhang Youfu was far too clever to get involved. He kept claiming illness, refusing to go. Inspector Fu couldn't use force, so he stood glumly at the county gate daily, his temporary assignment from Magistrate Wu.

Seeing the short-haired leader suddenly appear, Inspector Fu was shocked. Fortunately, his Mandarin was passable. After much gesturing, he understood: this visitor wanted to see the magistrate.

A pirate leader wanting to see the magistrate—this startled Inspector Fu. But he didn't dare delay—he rushed to the county yamen to report. Magistrate Wu Mingjin was terrified; his hands and feet went cold. He'd already sent people to the provincial capital seeking transfer. Before that came through, the pirates had arrived. What to do? Meeting them risked accusations of colluding with bandits; not meeting them left the county defenseless—like a naked maiden. No militia, not even constables—all were out collecting autumn taxes.

He quickly summoned his secretary. The secretary's idea was simple: officially, meeting was inappropriate. Let him, as a private representative, meet them first—assess their intentions. Secretaries were merely magistrates' personal employees—more flexibility in their status.

Wu De's requests were simple: assume responsibility for salt-tax collection and form a militia. This troubled Secretary Wang. The salt village forming a militia was trivial—militias were everywhere in the county. One more, one less didn't matter. The petition was indeed from salt-village villagers. But the Gou family wouldn't be happy.

The county knew perfectly well what the Gou family was doing—but magistrates usually couldn't touch such local magnates. For this remote county, the Gou family not openly rebelling was already good enough.

Salt-tax collection and salt-village militia—anyone slightly informed about county affairs could see: these short-hairs were preparing to seize the meat from Gou's mouth.

The problem was: neither the Gou family nor the short-hairs could currently be offended. Comparatively, the short-hairs were even more untouchable. After consulting Magistrate Wu, Secretary Wang gave a flexible response:

Salt taxes were due on the first of the eleventh month. Whoever paid first would get the collection franchise.

The implication: you two compete fairly; we officials won't interfere. Whoever wins gets the salt-tax prize. As for militia—the county didn't object; just form it.

After reaching this understanding, Wu De left to prepare the assault on Gou Manor.

The most informative source on the Gou family was Zhang Xingjiao—he was from Gou Manor village. But the Committee didn't fully trust his intelligence—vengeful people often exaggerated or minimized certain things. Wu De wanted to verify basics himself.

After dispatching investigators, they learned: Gou Manor wasn't actually called that—its real name was Damei Village. Located in Lingao's northwestern Gaoshan Ridge region. The Gou family were outsiders—but unusual outsiders: remnants of the pacified Zhejiang-Fujian Japanese pirate raids. Don't assume the Gou family were Japanese descendants. Ming-era "Japanese pirate" raids were actually led by Chinese bosses—the Japanese were mere hired thugs, low-level ones at that—basically cannon fodder. The Gou family ancestor had been a minor leader—not so lowly. He'd fled with many confederates. Finding this place—near the county seat yet mountainous, easy to defend, close to the coast—they settled. They killed or drove out original landlords, brazenly becoming landlords themselves. Gradually expanding, they became county powerhouses; Damei Village became Gou Manor.

Mountain villages had little farmland—the Gou family only owned about a hundred *mu*. But through coercion, they'd acquired nearly a thousand *mu* in forced land-transfers. In recent years, heavy taxes drove more tenant farmers to voluntarily join their name—though exploited, at least they could eat.

The Gou family lived off these lands: collecting enormous rents, lending at high interest, accumulating considerable wealth. The manor had over 200 households, over 1,000 people. The village was on a small hill—not precipitous, but it had numerous militia and household guards, mostly mainland fugitives—homeless bachelors. The manor was tightly defended: two layers of earthen walls. The outer wall housed ordinary villagers, tenants, and sharecroppers; the inner wall contained the Gou family's dozen core households, guarded by dedicated household guards. Outsiders couldn't enter the inner compound.

Even more impressive: the Gou family maintained their ancestors' pirate traditions. They didn't personally participate anymore but colluded with small pirate gangs—they couldn't climb up to major figures like Liu Laoxiang, but small pirates were as numerous as ants at sea. Even pirates needed shore bases: for water, fencing loot, recovering from injuries. Big or small, pirates needed onshore dens. The Gou family was such a den—though with principles: never fence goods in Lingao itself, to avoid attracting official attention. Per intelligence, stolen goods went to Qiongshan. This rural landlord unusually had business in Qiongshan—quite commercially minded.

Though Qiongshan was more prosperous than Lingao, it was merely the prefectural capital's principal county. Intelligence analysis concluded the Gou family's Qiongshan business was just a window for selling stolen goods to the mainland.

To clarify Gou Manor's specific situation and defenses, Wu De requested a professional reconnaissance team. Bei Wei wasn't at Bairren Fortress, but the recon team he'd trained was taking shape. Per Bei Wei's recommendation, Xue Ziliang led this reconnaissance—prompting protests from some Committee members about entrusting national matters to this "ABC." Fortunately, Bei Wei was a heavyweight military leader; otherwise, "foreign-agent" accusations would've been inevitable.

For Xue Ziliang, such reconnaissance was child's play. But his attitude was serious—this was his first time fully in charge. Only success was acceptable. Ye Mengyan also finally got his first real mission—immediately donning all his personal gear: jungle BDU, American LC-1 infantry equipment. Whether genuine or replica, civilian or military—all piled on. To someone like Xue Ziliang who'd used the real thing, this mix of real and fake looked extremely amateurish. Add a Type 80 helmet and SKS rifle, and he resembled a South American guerrilla.

"We don't need all this equipment. Our reconnaissance mission is very simple."

Though unpopular among nationalists, Xue Ziliang had high standing in Bei Wei's recon squad—capable people succeed anywhere. Unlike Bei Wei, who had solid recon fundamentals but zero combat experience, Xue Ziliang had actually served in the Middle East, executing real missions. Combat experience-wise, only He Ming—who'd fought the Vietnamese—could match him. Military enthusiasts especially admired this. Xue Ziliang played to them, frequently sharing combat stories and American military anecdotes. Gregarious and American-raised, he'd inherited Americans' chattiness. Lingao's nightlife was dreary; listening to his tales became the recon squad's only evening entertainment.

"Then what should we bring?" Little Ye was reluctant—all this gear, no chance to show off—wasted.

"Regular equipment is OK." Xue Ziliang knew the key was finding a guide. Damei Village couldn't be found on 21st-century maps.
