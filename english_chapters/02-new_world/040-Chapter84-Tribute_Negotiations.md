# Chapter 84: Tribute Negotiations

"Old Wu, you're here!" Just as he was reading, Zhou Dongtian entered. His training suit was covered with ink stains. Before crossing, he had been a fire-department officer, then a judicial worker. But because he was very familiar with printing, he had become head of this Document Printing Office. Most equipment here had been purchased with his money.

"So—we're publishing a newspaper?" Wu De pointed at the proof.

"Yes, the Committee approved Dingding's proposal. A newspaper—though just an irregular small paper. First issue: fifty copies."

"I think this newspaper's positioning is wrong. Who's the target audience?"

"You think we don't know Marx?"

"If it's for locals, why simplified characters? Also, has the Committee considered literacy rates?" Wu De thought this was a joke. Of the 138 prisoners he managed, besides Zhang Xingjiao who could read and write, only two or three small landlords knew a few characters. Illiteracy exceeded 95%. In such an environment, printing newspapers was pointless.

"We're about to start literacy classes for your labor teams." Zhou Dongtian pointed at the computers. "The Cultural-Education Group already has a first draft of literacy materials. We're also preparing lithography for flash cards."

"Creative thinking indeed."

"All Dingding's ideas." Zhou Dongtian chuckled. "This journalist really thinks big—ambitious. Besides newspapers, he wants to publish textbooks."

"Having ideas is good. Here's my manuscript—please print it soon."

"Your little thing—I can just print wax stencils. Wait a moment." He went to turn on the computer. Wu De's draft was on computer, transmitted directly via wireless network to OA—even saving the typing effort.

"Since we have computer networks, why print documents at all? Bureaucratism!" Wu De sighed.

"Probably to leave written archives for the future. Computers will break someday." Zhou Dongtian adjusted the machine, inserting wax paper. "In another ten years, probably all this will be handwritten. I brought an old Chinese typewriter—when machines break, we'll depend on it for stencils."

After mimeographing materials, one copy routinely went to the Intelligence Group for archives. He went directly to discuss with Committee leaders.

"You're saying prisoners are uneasy?" Wen Desi asked.

"Yes, and some will probably remain uneasy." Wu De pointed at his trend report. "According to the latest report, those small landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants with their own homesteads—because harvest season is coming and they can't go back to work, and they're worried about family—have been restless."

"These people shouldn't be many."

"Right, but ordinary tenant farmers have similar problems. If they don't harvest, they can't pay rent. Their own and families' livelihoods are insecure."

"Mm, mm."

"Those truly comfortable anywhere are only the destitute without family burdens, or long-term laborers."

"So few want to join us." Wen Desi was somewhat discouraged.

"Yes. Actually we're attractive to poor people, especially after we introduced 'worker' benefits. For former hired hands, working for us is better than working for the wealthy. But for tenant farmers and poor peasants with some family and property—maybe not. They care more about 'living peacefully.' Really, these people doubt 'how long the red flag can fly.'"

"Before we achieve greater victory or legitimate status, this doubt probably can't be eliminated." Xiao Zishan also seemed disappointed.

"Even with doubts, we must proceed." Wen Desi considered. "Remember the predetermined policy—'Beacon Effect.' Once everyone sees that serving us means living better, they'll naturally lean toward us. Common people mostly look at what's in front of them."

"I agree. If you genuinely give benefits, common people won't forget."

"Also, those eight Li minority prisoners are still held in the POW camp—not assigned to labor teams. How does the Committee plan to handle them?"

"We're preparing to use them as a breakthrough for establishing relations with the Li tribes to the south." Xiao Zishan explained. "Mu Min is working on this. Results should come in a few days."

The implication: this was not Wu De's domain. He nodded. Just then, Wen Desi's PHS rang. Someone said something over the phone. Wen Desi replied, "Have them wait. Treat them well. We'll come." To Wu De: "Locals have come to visit us."

"Oh?" Wu De was interested.

"Regarding prisoners. Come with us. Also bring Xiong Buyou. And the local interpreter—call everyone."

"Got it."

Since the county's two-pronged counterattack had ended in disaster, Lingao County had tensed up again. According to returning militia survivors, the pirates' firearms were terrifying—one volley killed everyone nearby. Even the famous Huang Family Village militia had been defeated; Huang Shoutong himself was seriously wounded, carried directly back to Huang Village. City residents panicked. Some gentry were already transferring property and people to remote relatives or their own rural strongholds. Others claimed family emergencies or illness, returning home. Even refugees inside the city wanted to leave—rumors said these short-haired pirates would wash the city in revenge.

After several days, seeing the shaven-headed pirates showed no intent to attack, officials and gentry calmed slightly. Because losses were so heavy, internal quarrels erupted. The supposedly flawless attack plan had failed ignominiously—proving *Jinshi* Liu's so-called suppression strategy useless. Rumors circulated that *Jinshi* Liu was a "scholar playing soldier"—failing court above and homeland below. The already frail Liu Dalin, infuriated by this outcome after a month of exhausting effort, retired home to recuperate.

Magistrate Wu was angry but could not stop him. Daily, he fumed in his reception hall, worried. The pirates had landed nearly a month ago with no sign of leaving. Gentry had lost trust in him. City morale had collapsed. If the shaven-heads attacked, archers and militia would likely scatter instantly. As for the prefectural capital—besides a letter telling him to "guard the city" and other useless platitudes—only reminders that court autumn grain collection was imminent, demanding he focus on this.

"Collect grain! Collect grain! Everything's a mess—what grain to collect!" Wu Mingjin was full of frustration. Thinking it over, he could only consult his private secretary.

Secretary Wang, named Zhaomin, was Cantonese—years serving in various prefectural and county secretariats across the province, very familiar with local procedures.

Secretary Wang pondered a while, then said quietly, "Your Honor, since we cannot expel pirates, we can only pay tribute."

"Tribute?" Magistrate Wu was startled, nearly jumping up to curse this absurdity. But having been in local politics for years, he quickly composed himself.

"Would it work?"

Secretary Wang stroked his beard, smiling. "Call it expediency. The most pressing matter is autumn grain! If this season's grain is collected, all will be peaceful. Pirates? Fujian and Guangdong are both troubled—can't we be troubled too?"

"Yes, yes, the elder speaks truth." Magistrate Wu felt enlightened. Suddenly he frowned. "But this matter probably can't be hidden from superiors—and the secret-police—" He instinctively glanced around.

"Your Honor needn't worry. In officialdom, less trouble is better. As long as autumn grain enters the granary and the county seat isn't lost, will the prefect bother with this? Others likewise." Secretary Wang whispered, "With the pirates' power, if they wanted this county seat, they'd have taken it already. Why camp at Bairren Rapids? They haven't plundered or killed in our county—quite righteous. We just buy peace for now."

"Reasonable, reasonable." Wu Mingjin nodded repeatedly. "But this matter is hardly trivial—"

"Your Honor, rest assured." Secretary Wang looked utterly confident. "Those eager to pay tribute to the pirates won't be us—but the gentry." He lowered his voice, saying much more.

Indeed, gentry worried about their harvests. Some had relatives missing in the "suppression campaign" and wanted to contact the pirates. Once Secretary Wang hinted slightly, everyone went to prepare these matters themselves.

After discussion, the gentry's representative was a down-on-his-luck landlord named Zhang Xingfu. His father had been a gambler who had nearly ruined the family, leaving him barely a hundred *mu* of hillside—purely dependent on weather. Because his wife's family had distant relations with the Liu Xiang gang, he could speak with various armed groups in the area. He often acted as intermediary with pirates—negotiating terms, discussing hostages. Though no party fully trusted him, when matters arose, they still needed his mediation. He himself used this role for side income and fees.

Those accompanying him were either someone's household manager or distant kinsman. Gentry feared being captured for ransom if they came personally—so they sent expendable people. All brought gifts: pigs, sheep, presents, and calling cards. Following the era's gentry etiquette for peer interaction, cards humbly styled themselves "unworthy student."

Walking less than half a *shichen* from the county seat, they saw earthen berms and guard towers ahead—knowing the pirate camp was reached. These pirates had landed over a month ago; everyone knew the name but had not even heard them. Many knew they had crushed the county's strongest militia in moments—even Huang Shoutong was struck down. But hearing the pirates had good discipline somewhat reassured them.
