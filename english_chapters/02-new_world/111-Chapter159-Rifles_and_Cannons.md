# Chapter 159: Rifles and Cannons

Finally, 1 kilogram of mercury produced roughly 1.2 kilograms of fulminate. The Chemistry Group was very satisfied. After all, each percussion cap used minimal fulminate.

Percussion caps for Minié rifles were best made of copper. The transmigrators had brought no copper with them. The Guangzhou Forward Station purchased large quantities of Japanese red-copper ingots—highly sought after because they contained considerable silver. Extracting the silver would offset the copper purchase costs.

The Metallurgy Group re-refined the copper ingots, obtaining high-purity copper and some silver. With materials solved, the Mechanical Group designed and built a specialized percussion cap stamping machine, manufactured dies, and powered it electrically—pressing 10 caps per cycle.

After confirming batch production, rifle assembly began. These Minié ball muzzle-loaders used 14mm alloy steel seamless tubes from a pre-departure purchase of high-pressure boiler pipes. After purchase, they had secretly machined 48-centimeter-length 5-groove "internal threads" at Zhan Wuya's machine shop. Hammers, triggers, and springs were also stamped from 4–5mm alloy steel plate at his shop. Without this preparation—if they'd had to self-machine rifling—they would barely have rifles now. The New Army would have been using Brown Besses instead. Smoothbores were championed by some line-infantry purists. Wang Luobin, though a line-infantry enthusiast, wasn't fundamentalist enough for that. True purists absolutely rejected rifled muskets.

Rifled muskets weren't new. The flintlock era already had rifled flintlocks. Compared to smoothbores, the benefits of rifling were obvious: longer range and higher accuracy. Against smoothbore flintlocks' sub-50-meter effective range, muzzle-loading rifles could serve as sniper rifles for their era.

Why weren't they widespread? First: complex manufacturing and high cost. Second: difficult loading. Rifled accuracy came from bullets rotating along grooves—requiring bullets to be embedded in the rifling. Without Minié balls, bullets had to be slightly larger than bore diameter, forcibly deformed into the rifling. Exaggeratedly put: hammered in. Though not usually that extreme, loading was slower than with smoothbores. So despite some countries equipping elite infantry with them, widespread adoption never happened.

Minié balls changed the muzzle-loader's destiny. Minié balls were conical projectiles slightly smaller than bore diameter—easy to load. The base had a conical cavity with a wooden plug. Firing gas pressed the plug into the cavity, expanding the base to engage the rifling, sealing the bore, and enabling spin. Minié balls solved the muzzle-loader's loading difficulty and the smoothbore's accuracy and range problems—making rifles surpass cannons as the battlefield's decisive weapons.

Trigger pull—*BANG*—the rifle recoil jolted his shoulder painfully. Wang Luobin's shoulder ached from the impact. Faint smoke dissipated from the muzzle. One hundred meters distant beneath the fortress wall, Jiang Ye ran from shelter, checked the target, pasted white paper over the new hole, and shouted into a bamboo-tube telephone. Wang Luobin removed his right earplug and listened at his bamboo tube: "9 ring—7 o'clock deviation." He waved acknowledgment.

Excellent result! First shot very near the bullseye—this rifle would calibrate within two hours. Taking a small file, he shaved a thin layer off the brass sight's left side. Then he loosened the barrel clamp, loaded powder and ball, and carefully re-aimed at the 100-meter half-body target. After 100-meter calibration came different-height targets simulating 200, 300, and 400 meters. Beyond that—soldier's luck.

This rifle took only 40 minutes—excellent accuracy. A perfect masterpiece. He estimated it could drop individual cavalry at 300 meters. Finally, a branding iron marked his initials on the stock's upper rear edge, adding "J+" below to indicate sniper grade. After all, Minié rifles only required 60% hits on 20-foot-wide, 8-foot-tall targets at 400 yards.

Looking at the board with four *zheng* characters scratched in charcoal, Wang Luobin heavily added a stroke to the fourth. Nearby, Zhan Wuya's group also finished their fourth rifle. Today's 50-rifle quota seemed no problem—likely to be exceeded.

Three thousand steel tubes plus components made 3,000 rifles, plus roughly 1,000 spare parts. However, two weeks ago, the Industrial Department decided to cut 20 tubes into approximately 2-inch sections for Derringer pistol production. Though losing 20 rifles, short-barreled weapons would equip the Navy, Intelligence, and other departments needing compact self-defense weapons. There was no intention of issuing GLOCKs to natives.

Though rifles assembled quickly—80-plus daily—without rigorous calibration, rifles given to rookies who had barely fired live rounds weren't much better than flintlock poles. Externally strong, internally weak—that described the transmigrators' current predicament.

Only after 600-plus rifles did the Industrial Group reduce the daily quota slightly, taking time for precision calibration and selecting accuracy rifles. Percussion caps were carefully stockpiled for combat. This related to the General Staff's operational doctrine. Given future enemies' enormous numbers—whether Ming forces or pirates—1,000-plus was routine. The transmigrators' operations had expanded; turtle defense would create everywhere-defended-everywhere-passive situations. Military doctrine: strike outward—deploy infiltration forces on the perimeter for cold shooting, mining, and harassing enemy movements and logistics. Such tactics required precision rifles for frontline units. After all, longer-range shooting benefited infiltration survival. One shot downing cavalry or officers clearly reduced frontal engagement pressure.

Days ago, the summary meeting's Intelligence Department reported: major battle within one month. Whether pirates or Ming forces, the transmigrators faced 2,000–3,000 attackers. If Ming—the mainland might continuously reinforce. Without heavily defeating Ming forces or annihilating portions, a siege could last one to two months. So the Industrial Department's burden suddenly increased. Besides 50 daily rifles, they needed combat ammunition stockpiling. The Metallurgy Department smelted steel while also mass-refining copper and lead. Casting molds mass-produced Minié balls and round iron shot: 3,000-plus Minié balls and 250 round shot daily. With stockpiled ammunition, a several-day battle at 30–40 rounds daily per rifle was manageable.

On the artillery side: the Foundry had delivered 9 × 8-pounder smoothbores. With familiar processes, casting smoothbores was now routine. Rear-loading cannons initially had difficulty machining breech blocks—one qualified block took 3 days. The first week: only 2 cannons. But after collective analysis, the Mechanical Group improved processes: cut steel plates without rushing welding—first grind end faces and weld steps on foot-pedal grinders, then use local granite slabs as jig frames for welding. Now: 6 × 70mm Armstrong guns completed. The 12-pounder mountain howitzers were simpler—with sufficient pig iron, they could produce one daily. Already delivered: 14 × 12-pounder mountain howitzers.

With increasing cannon production, the Mechanical Group mastered manufacturing processes, work hours, and component dimensions for each type. They designed and manufactured specialized dies and tooling. Using imported measurement tools, they quickly minimized tolerances—establishing manufacturing standards for each cannon type and beginning standardized production. Every cannon's parameters matched identically to same-type guns.

With standardized production, same-type cannons had nearly identical performance. The Artillery Group test-fired every cannon batch, measuring firing parameters: based on shell type and target distance, they determined charge amount and barrel elevation. When necessary, the Artillery Group conducted dangerous maximum safe rate, barrel life, and maximum charge experiments—testing cannon potential.

Test and calculation results became firing tables. The tables only needed four parameters. Book format allowed quick reference by gunners. They could even skip text—just graphics for shell types and numbers.

If gunners did all this themselves, they would need mastery of mathematics, geometry, and even algebra. Hence early-era gunners were half foundrymen, half mathematicians. That was the origin of "artillery needs high-tech personnel." But this wasn't inevitable—just conceptual backwardness. With standardized guns and tables, gunners didn't need sophistication. Just recognizing numbers and graphics, with a few hundred characters, sufficed. This dramatically reduced training difficulty. Theoretically, illiterates could serve. Very suitable for the transmigrators' societal environment.

As transmigrators, they possessed not just modern technology—but centuries of accumulated advanced concepts. Sometimes concepts exceeded technology's effectiveness.
