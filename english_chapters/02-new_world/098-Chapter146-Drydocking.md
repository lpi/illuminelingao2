# Chapter 146: Drydocking

Timber for the slipway and dock frame came from Bopu Lumber Yard. Besides mangrove-harvested coastal wood, there was considerable beam and pillar timber from the Gou Manor demolitions—perfect for shipyard facilities.

Standard slipways used thirty-by-thirty-centimeter diameter American pine. None was available here, but ordinary wood could substitute. However, forty-meter lengths were rare, requiring multi-piece splicing. Splicing wasn't difficult for the Mechanical Department—but approval was slightly complicated. Any metal material use currently required Planning Committee approval.

For simplicity, the slipway used a longitudinal layout. Electric winches easily overloaded and burned during drydocking—common even in professional shipyards. For their inexperienced crew, camel-type boiler-driven capstans were safer.

After solving the winch problem, the biggest issue was the "ground dragon." This was a massive horizontal pile buried underground. When capstans pulled ship hulls, the ground dragon—as the anchor point—bore enormous tension.

Shipyard ground dragons used reinforced concrete or concrete-filled steel pipe. Historically, wooden ground dragons were common. Requirements were stringent: high strength, rot-resistant. Generally thirty-to-fifty-centimeter diameter hardwood, minimum three meters long. Extensive dewatering and preservation was required.

Finally, Lumber Section's Wu Kuangming found suitable material in the stockpiles: some Southeast Asian hardwood, nearly fifty centimeters in diameter, highly rot-resistant—it could be used directly without treatment.

"This stuff could make coffins. Use it as your ground dragon." Wu Kuangming spoke reluctantly.

"What—you also want landlord gentry treatment?" Yan Quezhi teased.

"Heh—not that. But timber people know: coffin wood for wealthy families is the best—non-rotting in ground or water. Taking it away feels like cutting my own flesh."

After all equipment was installed, drydocking preparation began. Drydocking was skilled and dangerous work—shipyards commonly had casualties during this process.

"Everyone listen!" Wu De addressed the assembled personnel. "Drydocking is dangerous. During work, constantly watch! Being hit by cables—you're dead!"

He explained various precautions. Actually, Wu De himself only half-understood. But he'd at least witnessed and participated in fishing-boat drydocking in his village. Beyond that, he had an ancient "Simple Ship Repair Manual" found in the computers to work from. Success depended entirely on Wu De's memory and the book's accuracy.

Everything removable was offloaded—even the masts were removed to lower the center of gravity. Towing cables used steel wire from the *Fengcheng*—the lumber factory's self-made hemp ropes had proved insufficient in tensile tests. The slipway was coated with lard—the only room-temperature-solid fat Wu De could obtain. So much lard being taken made Wu Nanhai heartbroken: how many pigs did it take to get this much!

The drydocking site had fifteen or sixteen people. Though dangerous, Wu De didn't call on commune members—this work required constant communication. Commune members' Mandarin, however good, was a different era's language. Misunderstandings or delays meant deaths.

"Start!"

The steam engine was already heated. At Wu De's command, the winch began slowly turning. The ground dragon's chains tightened. Steel cables creaked against the pulleys. Wooden ship strength was limited—cables were girdled around the stern.

As the capstan turned, the steel cables became fully tensioned with creaking sounds. Wu De worried: eighty to ninety percent of drydocking casualties involved snapped tow lines. Once broken, highly tensioned cables would whip out like lashes—striking nearby workers who'd be sent flying. Survival was pure luck.

The cables were from the *Fengcheng*—theoretically fine for hundred-ton wooden ships. Still, the sounds were frightening.

"Ship's moving forward!" The walkie-talkie transmitted the observer's report. Two-thirds of the drydocking crew were positioned around the area for observation—preventing any deviation.

As the steam capstan wound, the ship rocked, slowly moving from water toward shore. The ship bobbed considerably in the waves—looking worrisome.

"Slow the winch—steady." Wu De constantly reminded via walkie-talkie. "Everyone watch the ship's direction. Align with the slipway."

The first approach was off-center—in shipyards, specialized workers handled this. For amateurs, first-try success was impossible.

"Don't panic—try again. Everyone check cables."

Every retry required cable inspection. Failing to dock just meant losing a ship—accidents killing people couldn't be undone.

After nearly five hours of repeated efforts—just aligning the ship's position had hoarsened everyone's throats—the ship finally rested stable on the dock frame. Wu De skipped celebrations, immediately directing everyone to recover lard from the slipway and scattered surroundings, storing it in clay jars. It would still be needed for re-launching.

"Good heavens—this oil's turned pitch-black! Disgusting!" The Navy people looked helpless.

"Somehow smells like fried food to me."

"That's friction heating. You have an appetite?"

"This stuff can be reused? Didn't they say it must be pure? There's sand in it now."

"Melt it down, filter again. Apparently Wu Nanhai specifically came by to say that if it can't be reused, return it to him."

"The cafeteria's going for gutter oil too!"

"Supposedly for soap making. But black soap—I'm not interested."

Repairs took under a week. All bullet holes were caulked; larger damage was reinforced with new wood. Hull fouling was cleaned; tung oil coating was applied. The Navy planned to add cannons—at least cannon positions. Originally, the pirates had mounted guns on deck, cutting ports in the gunwales and covering them with minimal protective shelters. Now the Mechanical Group's weapon enthusiasts moved the gun positions below deck—lowering the center of gravity. Four positions per side. Future deck could mount two or three more. The downsides: insufficient freeboard—heavy weather would splash through the gun ports. But with port shutters, non-combat problems weren't severe.

But there were no cannons. The Ballista problems had been fully exposed. The Ballista's nature meant high-trajectory lobbing—creating aiming difficulties. Secondly, the firing rate was extremely slow: two gunners cranking both sides took over a minute to reset tension. Physical exhaustion was considerable. Finally, the Ballista was far larger than cannons.

"What's strange about this?" Chen Haiyang said. "If Ballistae were really as magical as some Mechanical Department people claimed, why did navies replace them with 'crude,' 'heavy,' 'dangerous' cannons? Obviously even the worst cannons outperformed the best Ballistae."

"We need real cannons! Even muzzle-loaders!" Meng De howled.

Meng De had earned recognition for sailing the ship into port—briefly surrounded by flowers and applause. But the big ship couldn't move anymore. He'd devolved from spotlight captain to *Fengcheng* caretaker. Besides ship maintenance, his most important work was patrolling the bay with small boats.

Finally, the *Deng Yingzhou* appeared—showing the possibility of returning to center stage. But lacking traditional sailship knowledge, Lin Chuanqing had seized the captain position. The *Deng Yingzhou* was now the North America faction's domain—he had no interest serving under them. His conclusion: only building a fleet offered advancement. Now with a new ship, he tirelessly promoted his "fleet" plan: advocating steam-sail gunboat coastal fleet, demanding more Navy budget and personnel—even requesting multi-turret battleships. This call quickly gained hundreds of transmigrators' support—including many Industrial Department members.

The Committee ordered the Military Department's staff section to evaluate. After comprehensive analysis of local garrisons, pirates, equipment, and transportation, the conclusion was clear: whether pirates or Ming military, large-scale attacks would primarily use sea transport. Land routes would follow coastline roads. The transmigrators couldn't immediately control Qiongzhou Strait's sea supremacy—but they needed coastal mobility capability. With limited forces, mobility was especially crucial.
