# Chapter 92: New Farm (Part 2)

"Your stamina is really well-maintained."

"You make me sound ancient—I'm only thirty!"

"Huh?"

"This is what happens when you work at the grassroots long enough." Yang Baogui's smile was sunny. "Let's walk together." He called out: "Beibei, go! Bring Ukraine back!" At his shout, a dog sprinted off and herded a large white pig, which had been trying to gnaw tree bark, back to the road.

"It's called Beibei?"

"That's right—six in total, exactly: 'Beibei,' 'Jingjing,' 'Huanhuan,' 'Yingying,' 'Nini.'"

"What's the sixth?" Wu Nanhai, infected by his strange humor, was eager to learn.

"Aoyun—Olympics," Yang Baogui said with a straight face, then yelled: "Aoyun!" A quietly walking dog suddenly bounded to his feet, circling joyfully. He contentedly stroked its neck fur.

"You really know how to train dogs."

"It's my specialty—but not my profession. Just for fun." Yang Baogui cracked the whip, snapping it sharply. "I can also drive wagons. I learned from farmers in the countryside. But there aren't any here. I went to the Industrial Group and asked them to make some rubber-wheeled wagons; hitch our captured Yunnan ponies to them, and a two-horse team could pull a thousand *jin* easily. These people hemmed and hawed about how such carts are backward—they're 'working hard' to develop some four-wheeled farm cart. It's all nonsense—can small horses even pull those?"

"Tieling draft horses could definitely pull them." Wu Nanhai eyed two especially tall, robust heavy horses in the column. These were the best draft horses bred in China since 1949, carrying bloodlines from Europe's finest cart and riding horses. Their maximum pulling force was 450 kg. One horse could pull a 1,000-kg loaded double-rubber-wheeled wagon.

"They could, but these two must be kept as studs—they shouldn't work too hard. Besides, Tieling draft horses have actually deteriorated significantly." *(Note: Tieling draft horse breeding stopped in the 1990s; only a few degraded studs now exist. The breed will soon disappear.)* Yang Baogui sighed. "Nanhai, honestly, I'm very worried about our Agriculture Group."

"Mm, I also sense some problems, but there are so many threads—where to even start?" He imitated Yang Baogui, waving a willow branch to herd livestock.

"Nanhai, you studied agriculture—surely you know what underlies modern agriculture's high yields?"

"Pesticides, fertilizers, improved varieties, irrigation, GMOs, soil chemistry..." Wu Nanhai listed.

"Can that model be replicated here?"

"Difficult. Conditions are too poor. Large-scale irrigation and promoting improved varieties are more realistic yield-boosting measures," Wu Nanhai pondered. "Fertilizer is somewhat manageable—once the Chemical Industry Group builds ammonia and sulfuric-acid plants. But pesticides are hard—that needs an organic chemical industry. I think without thirty or forty years of industrial buildup, it's impossible."

"No." Yang Baogui shook his head. "Those problems are superficial. The biggest issue is that modern society is a massive division-of-labor system—agriculture included. Under this system, our agricultural technicians' practical abilities have actually deteriorated—and farmers' too.

"Before, farmers had to select and cultivate their own seeds. Now they just buy seeds directly. Agricultural technicians really only know which seeds to use, how to manage after sowing, when to apply which pesticides, what fertilizers...

"Here, there's no seed company, no pesticide factory, no veterinary drug factory, no agricultural machinery station... Everything must be done ourselves. We were all trained within this division-of-labor system—only knowing our own part. Modern agriculture is a complete chain, and we only have scattered links."

He pointed at the dogs herding pigs: "Take those pigs—Georgia! Where are you going?!" Yang Baogui shouted, whipping a pig back onto the road. "Everyone expects these to start large-scale pig farming so we can eat meat every meal. Nobody knows how many vaccines a piglet gets from birth to market in modern pig farms, how much medication, how many disinfectants are used just for the pens. Even then, if a swine plague breaks out, they die in droves."

Wu Nanhai grew worried. He had thought about these issues but never this deeply.

"Seems like we'll have to rebuild everything piece by piece." He looked at the carefree pigs grunting, foraging as they walked. "They have names too?"

"Yes—all are breeding boars and sows. Names make them easier to remember."

"What are they called?"

"Ukraine, Big Bobo, Georgia, Russia—"

"Ha! Russia must be that boar?" Wu Nanhai pointed at the largest, fiercest pig.

"No—that one's called Soviet Union."

The two chatted as they walked. The ten-plus kilometers of simple road were well-maintained—dusty after vehicles passed, but pleasant for herding livestock. On one side was the rushing Wenlan River; on the two banks of fields, rice ears had ripened, but without the familiar rolling golden waves—agriculture here was quite backward. Wu Nanhai walked and sighed, thinking about how to turn everyone's knowledge into productivity, yet obstacles piled up before him.

The road was peaceful. Occasionally local people worked distant fields, but they were far away. Several watchtowers along the route provided great security for passing transmigrators. These originally rough wooden towers had been rebuilt as three-story brick-and-stone pillboxes with searchlights on top. Below, open ground was surrounded by deep trenches and barbed wire—if any attack happened, transmigrators and vehicles on the road could quickly shelter inside.

The entire marching column took nearly three hours to reach the Bairren Rapids camp. All Agriculture Committee members awaited them—today was the Committee's official move-in day.

Unlike departments already installed in the Committee Building compound, the Agriculture Committee was housed entirely in what became known as the "Nanhai Model Demonstration Farm." Wu Nanhai had learned in university that agriculture isn't created sitting in offices writing plans and reports, but through every technician walking step by step through fields, fish ponds, and orchards. As an agricultural technician, you must live near farmland.

The entire farm compound was built with the brick kiln's newest red bricks, making it probably the grandest building complex in all of Bairren Fortress: offices, agricultural-tech labs, warehouses, machinery station, cellars, and neatly arranged granaries. By the river stood a water-powered mill; newly built animal pens were fragrant with fresh lumber. The only concrete structure was a row of pressure-type biogas digesters—processing waste, wastewater, and manure from residential and agricultural zones. The biogas supplied the cafeteria for cooking. When waste increased later, more biogas could generate electricity. Biogas slurry served as fertilizer or feed additive; the final residue was excellent fertilizer.

The original plan included a permanent glass greenhouse, but since the Industrial Sector hadn't yet manufactured glass, it was delayed for now. Fortunately, Hainan was subtropical; even during the Little Ice Age, the accumulated temperature was sufficient.

"The land assigned as our test field—" Ye Yuming pointed to boundary stakes—"extends from here to the water mill by the river."

From here to the river was over 100 meters, and the length was about 200 meters—an irregular long rectangle roughly twenty-plus modern *mu*. It was adequate for vegetable plots and test fields. A small portion was already leveled and planted with cabbage, greens, peppers, and tomatoes—some already harvestable. Cafeteria tables could become slightly more abundant.

But most land remained more stones than soil and still had tree stumps—it needed leveling, and probably soil brought in. He observed the riverbank height and high-water lines, estimating irrigation channels needed and whether to build flood dikes. Where to plant fruit trees, dig fish ponds, where to temporarily house tropical seedlings—all required consideration.

The farm compound's space shouldn't be wasted either—courtyard economy. Build a grape trellis over courtyard paths: half a *mu* of trellis could yield 1,000 *jin* of grapes without taking space, while providing shade. Plant some fruit trees behind buildings...

He calculated happily. But with the labor shortage, he would need to ask Wu De for some local farmers to help—ideally hired as long-term workers. As for local agriculture conditions, it would be best to find a landlord to ask—but he had heard landlords and rich peasants had all been released. Too bad—such people had rich farming experience and understood rural social conditions better. But he couldn't speak Lingao dialect—he needed interpreters. Troublesome. Better to learn himself. At minimum, for future wife-taking and concubine-acquisition, he would need emotional communication. Start from "Ah, Oh, E"? But all that was for tomorrow—after walking for hours, he was exhausted.

That day, he slept in the Agriculture Committee office. After so many days, finally having a roof overhead—sleeping indoors—felt incredibly happy. Apparently, happiness really did come from comparison.
