# Chapter 162: Army-Navy Disputes

When Huang Xiong arrived at the headquarters office, three others besides Li Yunxing were already present. He recognized one of them—Company Commander "Chief Wei." Another, "Chief Ma," frequently appeared at the training grounds and seemed important.

The third man was unknown to him: Ran Yao. Li Yunxing had called the Security Group immediately after drill. Huang Xiong's insight clearly exceeded that of a common peasant—he was likely a Ming military officer. They needed confirmation about whether this man was a spy.

There was also an observer: Dongmen Chuiyu. He was currently on light duties since the East Gate Market was running smoothly. He often loitered around Ma Qianzhu's office, even drafting staff regulations, earning him a nominal staff officer title.

"Sit," Ran Yao said casually.

"Thank you, Chief!" Huang Xiong snapped to attention again—he seemed particularly fond of this gesture.

Everyone noted that his movements differed from those of ordinary recruits.

"You were regular army?" Ran Yao asked directly.

"Yes! I was a *bazong* at the Jizhou garrison." His face was frank.

A Ming officer. This surprised Li Yunxing. This recruitment drive had brought in many escaped local military households, but a Jizhou *bazong* and Hainan military households were completely different things. The former were real soldiers. The latter were essentially serfs of military landlords. The gap between them was vast.

"As an imperial officer, why travel thousands of *li* to Qiongzhou?"

Huang Xiong hesitated. "I... clashed with my superiors. Accidentally killed one."

A killer too. No wonder he had fled so far.

"Why the conflict?"

"Money and grain." Huang Xiong smiled bitterly. "The Court constantly owed wages—the soldiers were nearly starving. When an allocation finally came, it wasn't our share. I demanded it. Conflict resulted."

A straightforward reason. But Ran Yao knew that if he was a spy, his cover story would be waterproof. Being in Hainan, they couldn't easily investigate events in Jizhou.

"Why join our forces?"

"The Chiefs are overseas people—unrelated to Ming officialdom. Naturally, I would join here."

There were no holes in this story either. Exchanging glances with the others, Ma Qianzhu suddenly asked:

"How do you rate our militia training?"

"The Chiefs' training methods are unlike anything I've seen before. I dare not evaluate them," Huang Xiong said respectfully. "However, transforming village bumpkins into people who understand advance, retreat, and formations within a month—that is already masterful. It would be more than sufficient against local bandits."

Ma Qianzhu nodded, asked some random questions, and then dismissed him.

"Keep him?" Ran Yao whispered.

To play it safe, this man shouldn't be used—best eliminated entirely. He had received full transmigrator military training. If he was truly a spy, his escape would leak intelligence to the authorities.

Wei Aiwen spoke up. "I recommend keeping him. Such people will grow more common. Everything has a beginning. If we distrust everyone, whom can we use?"

"What if he's a spy?" Li Yunxing hesitated.

"A spy wouldn't expose his identity so easily," Ran Yao said. "Personally, I believe him."

"That's not materialist," Dongmen Chuiyu criticized.

"What's materialist? For true vigilance—we have so many workers and civilians. Can you guarantee every single one is reliable?"

"Little Wei's right. We can't hide forever in our small circle," Ma Qianzhu decided. He turned to Ran Yao. "Mark his file 'controlled use.' Assign two soldiers for cross-surveillance."

"I'll arrange it."

"Hey, hey—" Wei Aiwen protested. "You've planted informants in my Training Battalion without telling me?"

"That falls under the Executive Committee's vertical management. Just read our bulletins." Ran Yao tapped the table—this week's soldier trends document sat there. "Little Wei, your security awareness is poor. This is classified material—you just leave it lying on tables?"

"Soldiers can't enter here. Even the guards are transmigrators. Can't lose anything. Doors have locks." Wei Aiwen was dismissive. "Chief of Staff Ma, do you want to see our shooting training?"

"Sure, let's go."

To date, the New Army had conducted one hundred shooting sessions: forty live-fire and sixty dry-fire. This exceeded the new recruit training of the nineteenth-century British Army—the most shooting-focused military of that era. The transmigrators spared no expense on their founding forces.

Walking to the 2nd Company area, they found soldiers clustered together. A dark-skinned, brawny soldier aimed a rifle at a distant stone. The crowd surrounded him.

*BANG.* The stone flew. Excellent shooting. Wei Aiwen recognized him: Yang Zeng—Li Yunxing's shooting prodigy.

Just as Wei Aiwen moved to commend him, Dongmen Chuiyu stepped ahead.

He told the shooter, "You—nice shooting."

The soldier chuckled.

"Now—shoot again for me." Dongmen spoke unhurriedly.

The soldier shot again. A hit.

Dongmen nodded, then stood beside the soldier. He drew a Jericho pistol from his waist, loaded a blank, and said, "Once more."

The soldier began cleaning the barrel—then Dongmen fired skyward. The soldier's hand trembled, and some powder spilled.

The lone staff officer began urging: "Faster."

Powder finally went in. During the cleaning process, Dongmen fired twice more.

The soldier began reloading.

"Faster. Even faster."

Dongmen's gun fired again. The soldier dropped a bullet.

"What are you doing? Load! Hurry, load!" Dongmen shouted right beside the soldier's ear.

The soldier frantically fished another cartridge from his pouch.

The gun fired again. Followed by: "Faster! Move faster!"

The soldier shakily inserted a round into the barrel.

Another shot. Everyone watched his trembling hands as he placed the percussion cap.

"Fire! Fire now!" he continued.

The soldier finally finished loading.

"Quick. Aim. Shoot!" he commanded amid the pistol fire.

The soldier's rifle fired.

The distant stone showed no reaction. The bullet had missed.

Dongmen Chuiyu holstered his pistol. "Keep practicing."

Everyone shook their heads. Great shot—but not yet a soldier.

After leaving the area, Wei Aiwen caught up angrily.

"Dongmen Chuiyu—don't you think that was excessive?"

"How was it excessive?"

"That Yang Zeng—since joining the Skirmisher Platoon, do you know how much effort he's invested in shooting practice? He's currently the battalion's best shot."

"That's irrelevant. Captain Wei, remember: we need soldiers, not shooting athletes." He glanced at Li Yunxing. "Fighting isn't done in quiet shooting ranges."

Before Wei Aiwen could respond, he walked away.

Wei Aiwen and Li Yunxing began to dislike this man who wore glasses despite not being nearsighted.

More infuriating for Wei Aiwen: his impressive artillery was being split—half went to the Navy! Only nine 12-pounder mountain howitzers and some 6-pounders remained. The 8-pounders and 70mm Armstrong breechloaders went to the Navy. The self-proclaimed "Artillery Superintendent," Zhang Bailin, was furious—he had invested massive effort in the artillery. Li Haiping's shameless material bribery (unlimited Navy fish) aimed at luring away the best gunners made him livid.

"Chief of Staff Ma—this is unacceptable!" Zhang Bailin raged. "The Army is the main force against encirclement. Give cannons to the Navy—how are we supposed to fight?"

"Exactly—the Training Battalion has four infantry companies. Why does the Navy get to take one as a 'Marine Squad'? The Executive Committee favors the Navy—we accept that. But this is bullying!"

Ma Qianzhu stood up. "All you want is cannons! Those 8-pounders—can you haul them?"

"Nanhai Farm has—"

"You're the Artillery Superintendent—how many horses does an 8-pounder need?"

Zhang Bailin fell silent. He didn't know his beloved weapon's horse requirements.

"At least six! Medium horses." Ma Qianzhu tapped the table. "How many horses does Wu Nanhai's farm have?"

"Donkeys work too—" Zhang Bailin resisted weakly.

"Donkeys can only pull 12-pounder mountain howitzers. One mountain howitzer battery's cannons plus limbers needs thirty donkeys. Even if Wu Nanhai bankrupted himself, it wouldn't suffice! You don't appreciate the costs!"

Zhang Bailin deflated completely. Wei Aiwen persisted about the Marine Company.

"The Marine Company is made of future Navy sailors. The Training Battalion was just interim training. The month is up—the Navy wants them for ship training."

Both received a thorough lecture and left defeated.

"The Navy's bullying is too damn much!" Wei Aiwen was still fuming.

"Using the *Fengcheng* Hotel—they've bribed the Executive Committee. Too corrupt!"

"Let's find Commander Xi."

"Fat Xi?" Zhang Bailin rudely used his nickname. "He and Ma Qianzhu wear the same pants."

"What about others? Bai Yu, Ying Yu—"

"Unreliable. Those veterans spent lifetimes 'obeying the Party's orders'—here it's 'obeying the Executive Committee's orders.'"

"If this continues, the Army will suffer." Wei Aiwen lamented the Army's future.

"Hmph. Time to organize a pressure group for the Army's rights—for all transmigrators' sake! Their mismanagement harms the transmigration enterprise. I've heard many battalion officers are dissatisfied with Executive Committee decisions—"

"Lower your voice. Tell me—specifically, what do we do?"
