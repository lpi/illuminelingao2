# Chapter 87: New Farm (Part 1)

The transmigrators' meals since D-Day had consisted of rice and seafood. After a month of every imaginable seafood preparation, few remained interested. Even Wu De, who had championed the original seafood rice, found it extremely boring after two weeks. Although he later spearheaded improvements like smoked fish, fish sauce, and fish cakes, some required long maturation periods, while others lacked necessary seasonings. They had remembered to bring enough salt but had removed soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, cooking wine, and spices from the reserves, thinking these were low-tech products they could easily manufacture, grow, or purchase after crossing. They had forgotten that these items would not be immediately available, yet the need to eat daily remained.

The result was that whether it was smoked fish or fish cakes, everything tasted strange and failed to excite the palate. Sometimes the Cafeteria Office improved meals using reserve canned goods, but the quantities were minuscule relative to the population. A single can of luncheon meat for two people would be nauseatingly rich, while one can shared among ten meant almost no one received any.

One day, Wu Nanhai furtively brought Wu De a smoked sausage. In another time and space, he would not have glanced at this, but now it seemed incredibly delicious, even though it lacked pepper and contained only garlic. Wu Nanhai repeatedly urged secrecy, especially from Nick—this was horse-meat sausage made from his "Blue Lightning." The Australian racehorse's remains had been quietly embezzled as the Agriculture Group's private stash. Nick's occasional pilgrimages to the racehorse's grave found it empty; even the bones had been secretly collected. Wu Nanhai planned to make bone-meal fertilizer.

The dead horses dragged back after defeating the "First Counter-Encirclement"—as everyone called it after the *Lingao Express* started publishing—became their first real meat improvement in over a month. The six pigs sent by the local gentry became the cafeteria's rare delicacy.

But for Wu Nanhai's team, there was a slight disappointment. These pigs were nothing like those from the other timespace; they were scrawny, with stiff bristles, looking somewhat like wild boars.

"Don't look down on them." Xiong Buyou, who had driven the pigs over, gazed at the piglets while swallowing. "These are Lingao pigs—a famous local specialty, always exported to Hong Kong. You know Lingao suckling pig? This breed has thin skin, small bones, and tender meat, with a special aroma..."

His greedy, wolf-like gaze roamed over the piglets. "These are thirteen or fourteen *jin* each—the perfect age. Roasted, they'll be plump and tender."

"No scheming. I was planning to raise the piglets as breeding stock. Since you say this breed is so good, we're definitely keeping them."

"Slaughtering the big pigs?"

"Right—let everyone feast. I've consulted the Committee." Wu Nanhai eyed the pigs still obliviously rooting for food, unaware that their end was near. "Originally I wanted to kill two, but the Committee said if we're killing, kill all six big pigs. Rather than everyone getting just one small slice, let everyone eat their fill—call it a reward."

Wu Nanhai had already calculated uses for the gifts. The 200 *jin* of low-alcohol rice wine would be used as cooking wine or made into vinegar. The deer was already a butchered carcass, so they would make deer jerky. It was an easy method; though lacking spices, boiling it in salt water and then drying it made for decent, portable, and long-lasting food. Sadly, the deer came pre-butchered, with no hide or organs. One of the cows was a female Yellow Cattle, which had insufficient draft power for southern paddies but would be useful as future beef and dairy broodstock. The six big pigs were market-weight meat pigs with no use as breeders. Although they still had fattening potential, without feed they would lose weight, so they might as well be slaughtered.

Many plans emerged for utilizing these pigs. The belly and ribs would all become braised pork. The pig-head meat would be braised—though lacking spices for now, it was stored with premium cuts like loin and tenderloin in a refrigerator salvaged from the *Fengcheng*'s galley. The trotters and small ribs would be used for soup; leg and shoulder meat for ground meat; all fat rendered for lard; cracklings for stir-fry; and bones for broth. Brains and spinal cord were separately extracted. Blood and edible organs all became delicacies. Inedible parts—pancreas, bladder, gallbladder, spleen—had other uses and were frozen for now. Even the skin would be fried into pork rinds. Wu Nanhai desperately wanted the food complaints to pause, if only for a few days. Truly inedible waste went to him for drying into feed powder.

This comprehensive utilization plan hit one big problem: no one knew how to slaughter pigs. For the transmigrators, pigs meant red meat on market boards or in supermarket freezers. How to turn live pigs into pork became an unsolvable mystery.

Wu Nanhai summoned Yang Baogui. Everyone naturally assumed that since he had successfully butchered and sectioned several dead horses for the Cafeteria Office, he could handle pig slaughtering. But the veterinarian shook his head—taking a pig's life was easy, but slaughtering was skilled work. Done wrong, you would ruin the meat. He cited the EU example: to implement animal humanitarianism, the EU had washed out centuries-old slaughter methods in favor of humane electrocution, and now EU pork tasted terrible.

Finally, the Military Group veterans solved the problem. What military company did not raise pigs? Come the New Year's feast, their own mess squads organized the slaughter. Some had helped in the mess halls. Several veterans rolled up their sleeves, boiled big pots of water, and killed all the pigs efficiently.

Yang Baogui and Shi Niaoren formed an inspection team, performing on-site quarantine. These pigs were reasonably healthy—no serious parasitic infections—but they advised cooking all meat thoroughly.

That evening, the cafeteria cooked several huge pots of braised pork. Seasoned only with salt, soy sauce—very poor solid soy sauce at that—and cooking wine, the braised pork earned unanimous praise. Even weight-conscious women who usually avoided meat joined the clamoring. Wu Nanhai saw someone cry while eating.

"Meat is best." This was the unanimous conclusion of the transmigrators who had eaten nearly two months of seafood.

But those pots of braised pork exhausted the last of the soy sauce from the ship's galley. Wu Nanhai planned to find somewhere to buy soy sauce and seasonings—he had fermentation cultures—but the Agriculture Committee now had too much to do.

As the entire industrial center shifted toward Bairren Rapids, various supporting facilities were completed. The Agriculture Committee's equipment also needed moving to Bairren Fortress. Wu Nanhai traveled daily between locations, organizing and transporting goods. Though a Committee member, he rarely commandeered the Beijing 212, usually hitching rides on farm trucks between sites. After moving, only one Cafeteria Office person remained at Bopu guarding the canteen, plus Chen Haiyang—former navy, now fisherman—managing the Fishery Production Group. Chen Haiyang had submitted a report to the Committee requesting to establish a navy around the Fishery Group's current ships and personnel, with fishing as a sideline. Bopu camp could be managed by the navy, and future maritime trade and shipbuilding could also be navy-managed.

*Navy!* Wu Nanhai thought. Eating problems were still unsolved, and someone was already proposing a navy. Seeing his tent of over a month being dismantled made him sentimental. He tossed the nylon nets Wu De had given him onto the farm truck. Wu De the fisherman was now happily running his labor-reform squad, daily tormenting natives with work and brainwashing. Had he stayed in the Fishery Group, would Chen Haiyang have suddenly proposed a navy?

This farm truck had a long string of two-wheeled carts—abandoned militia vehicles—hitched behind it, loaded with the Agriculture Group's belongings: small tools, irrigation equipment, sprayers, complete agricultural experimental equipment, veterinary instruments, seeds, cages of chickens, ducks, and rabbits... The farm trucks were becoming trains here. He did not know much about vehicles, but surely this could not be right. During difficulties, they would make do—hopefully the truck held up until everything was transported.

Yang Baogui waved a homemade whip, directing his six dogs running front and back, driving the newly formed marching column: several pigs, a pair of donkeys, and three horses. These large animals did not get vehicle rides; they would walk to their new home. These breeding animals were precious, so the Military Group sent seven or eight escorts.

"Old Yang, hard work." Wu Nanhai walked to his side. "Let's walk together." Livestock farming was not his specialty; he wanted to chat with the veterinarian.

"It's far—over ten kilometers. Can your body handle it?" Yang Baogui eyed his somewhat pudgy frame.

"What's that supposed to mean? I'm younger than you." This dark-skinned man with black-framed resin glasses looked at least thirty-seven or thirty-eight.

"I'm a vet—a rural vet. Walking over ten kilometers daily is nothing. Though there are village-to-village roads now, there's always only one vehicle—and it's always driven by someone who's not making house calls." Yang Baogui shook his flat-topped crew cut. Wu Nanhai noticed his glasses' arms were tied with string around his neck—just like his own. This shared trait greatly increased his fondness.
