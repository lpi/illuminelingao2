# Chapter 72: Water and Power (Part 2)

He remembered little of Zhuo Tianmin, only that he had a son who had once come to the Committee looking for Xiao Zishan, asking for a chit to get an egg from Wu Nanhai. For his son to eat—eggs were currently the scarcest item, only three or four per day were produced, normally reserved for the sick.

He looked mid-thirties, wearing a training suit covered in stone dust and mud. Pointing at the newly built pressure forebay, eyes on no one, he said: "...According to the design drawings: the inlet chamber floor should be higher than the anterior chamber floor. Now they have been built level."

The engineering crew gathered around him, silent. Mei Wan was a bit impatient: "Just a few centimeters difference—what is the big deal? If we scrutinized every drawing detail, this would be a jerry-built project."

"That is substitution measures for lacking materials—cannot be helped," Zhuo Tianmin, hearing this, grew angry. "This pressure forebay used the full amount of cement, gravel, and sand. Why not follow the drawings?"

"The crew did not understand the drawings—did not notice..." Bing Feng tried to mediate.

"That makes even less sense. The workers are novices, not professionals—that is not their fault. But we are all in construction engineering. How can we excuse such elementary mistakes?" People nearby were whispering.

Several professionals turned red. Mei Wan could not refute him, only said: "So what do you suggest?"

"Demolish and rebuild according to drawing specifications."

"That wastes materials and delays schedule!" Mei Wan nearly jumped. "Besides, you are not from hydraulic engineering—do you even know why the pool should have different levels? Drawings are not always right—that happens plenty."

"I certainly do not know. But precisely because we do not understand, we must follow drawings to the letter."

Then someone noticed: "Commissioner Wang is here!"

Hearing this, Zhuo Tianmin turned. Sure enough, Wang Luobin stood in the crowd. He gave Wang Luobin a polite nod and fell silent.

"Engineer Zhuo, please continue."

"I have said everything I have to say. And I truly do not understand hydroelectric construction. Commissioner Wang, you decide," Zhuo Tianmin said coolly. He wanted to see this Committee member's true mettle. Everyone's eyes focused on Wang Luobin.

Wang Luobin walked around the pool, then took a measuring rod to check depths. Finished, he asked Zhuo Tianmin: "Engineer Zhuo, what do you think should be done?"

Zhuo Tianmin said: "Not building to drawings means substandard quality. We can fudge it, but there may be problems later."

Wang Luobin turned to Mei Wan: "What do you think?"

Mei Wan thought, then said: "There is indeed deviation from drawings. But materials are scarce and we are on deadline. I say we make do—improve later when conditions allow."

This suggestion won approval from some Building Group members.

Wang Luobin nodded: "Rework would waste some cement and rebar, and delay grid connection. But this matter cannot be fudged."

He pointed at the pool: "The pressure forebay is wider and deeper than the channel so that water entering the forebay slows down, allowing sediment to settle. That is step one. The inlet chamber floor is higher than the anterior chamber floor to prevent settled sediment from rushing into the penstock—ensuring safe turbine operation."

Mei Wan realized he had again misread the Committee's intent. Highway construction had made him think the Committee prioritized speed, so he had insisted on schedule. Watching the construction crew stare at him, he waved dismissively:

"Stop staring. Demolish the problem areas and rework!"

The crew jumped into the pool with eight-pound hammers, pounding away. Concrete chunks fell. Wang Luobin's heart ached—who knew when they could produce cement? The long-range reconnaissance team had been dispatched precisely to find resources. They had been gone nearly a week; daily radio contact, but resource survey results had not come in yet...

Zhuo Tianmin stood aside, watching Wang Luobin as if seeing him for the first time. Previously, his impression of Committee members was that they were affable but slippery. Xiao Zishan was typical—never said anything to displease you, but you could not tell his position on anything. Even when making decisions in disputes, he would use rhetoric to save everyone's face. Zhuo Tianmin admired such people but simultaneously despised them—seeing it as a survival tactic for those without professional substance.

He knew well that after speaking up several times in the Building Engineering Group, he had become Mei Wan's bane. But he did not care at all—had he not brought his son here precisely to escape that hollow, hypocritical life? If he had to continue those games in another timespace, why come?

Wind blew strong. Trees with flexible branches swayed vigorously. Vegetation here at Bairren Rapids was better preserved than elsewhere; dense forests covered the surrounding low hills, wave after wave of tree-rustle carried on the wind. The wind suddenly strengthened; sky darkened—looked like rain. After the defective parts were demolished, Mei Wan immediately reorganized forces, personally leading the crew to rush repairs. Concrete pouring had to finish before rain. Wang Luobin also helped clear debris on-site. Working and thinking—as Director Wen had privately discussed with him, internal matters were not as simple as imagined. From these days of construction coordination, cracks within the Building Group were already evident.

After re-pouring concrete, turbine installation began immediately. Turbine installation had high precision requirements—leveling needed, ideally one-lift placement. Mei Wan called in the truck crane. After an afternoon of effort, the turbine was finally hoisted into position. With no bricks or tiles for the powerhouse, a temporary shelter was erected.

The crew cleaned up stones and debris in light rain, installed the intake-channel gate, and finally completely excavated the intake opening. The curved wooden gate worked perfectly—no water surged in. Now they just had to wait for concrete to fully cure before generating power.

This small hydroelectric station—20-meter head, 2 cubic meters per second flow—could provide the base with 200 kW of power. Future plans envisioned five turbines totaling 1000 kW.

With two generators about to operate simultaneously, the previous simple direct-wiring model would need changes. Chang Kai'en planned to establish a new power grid. The system was procured complete. The grid would use 110kV high-voltage transmission; industrial power at 380V, residential at 220V—matching existing voltage standards and the equipment they had brought.

Mei Wan originally wanted transmission lines buried underground for safety, but without corrosion-resistant conduit, they continued using overhead power poles. Fortunately, the line from hydroelectric zone to main city was only one hundred meters—entirely within visual range. If necessary, walls could connect the two zones—but for now, unnecessary.

With power, next came the water supply system. The Wenlan River's water quality suffered mainly from upstream residential and agricultural wastewater pollution—high organic content, much algae, but relatively little sediment. For such water quality, traditional sedimentation and disinfection alone was not enough. Algae produced foul odors that even chlorine could not mask—during the Taihu Wuxi cyanobacteria bloom, the water plant's output met all chemical standards but the smell could not be eliminated.

Tian Jiujiu, as the water-supply specialist, after surveying hydrology and terrain, decided on an infiltration-type intake—river water filtered through riverside soil before entering the reservoir. Water obtained this way was typically uncontaminated, requiring minimal treatment.

The simplest method was infiltration wells. But Tian Jiujiu considered the large population needing supply and modern habits consuming more water. So he adopted the more complex infiltration gallery water system.

First, fifteen meters from the river, parallel to the bank, a collection trench was dug. Trench depth had to be one meter below the lowest water level. Inside the trench: a filter bed of multiple layers of different-grade sand, gravel, and crushed stone. Collection pipes were buried in the center. Modern versions typically used perforated 50–100mm PVC pipe; Tian Jiujiu had none, so he used concrete pipe—200mm diameter logs as inner mold, gravel, fine sand, and cement mixed and cast on-site. This pipe did not need to be dense but porous; joints were not sealed either—so groundwater entering the trench could seep into the pipe. The entire trench was covered with at least 30mm of soil.

Finally, at the trench's north end—the lowest point—a clear-water well was built with concrete-mortar masonry. Filtered water entering the collection pipes ultimately flowed here to settle. The Building Engineering Group made a reinforced-concrete cover for this well. Settled clear water was pumped into an elevated water tower. The tower's base was stone and cement-mortar masonry; atop was a ten-ton water tank removed from a ship, exterior coated with cement mortar for waterproofing and rust-proofing. An ozone generator was installed outside the tower—this device used high-frequency electronics to produce ozone for sterilization. Ozone sterilization was not worse than chlorine and did not require complex electrolysis equipment or piping, with minimal human health risk. Until salt electrolysis was operational, this could serve for quite a while.

To protect against typhoons, the elevated tank was firmly guy-wired to the ground with heavy ship cables. The main water pipe to the main city was PVC. Since the Building Group's ambitious underground utility tunnel project had not started, this water line was temporarily buried in a shallow ditch.
