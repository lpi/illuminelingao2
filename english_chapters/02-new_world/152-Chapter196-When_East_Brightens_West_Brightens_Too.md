# Chapter 196: When the East Brightens, the West Brightens Too

Next door to Purple Treasure Studio stood Zichengji. This shop's current flagship product was only Guoshi Wushuang liquor—the person in charge, Zhang Xin, discovered he had far more liquor than glass bottles. He could only store the excess in large wine jars while waiting for Lingao to produce more bottles. But the distillers never rested, processing crude liquor purchased from everywhere daily. Guangzhou's crude liquor prices had already started slowly rising.

When Guo Yi discovered that Zichengji's white liquor inventory had exceeded 2.5 tons, he was shocked. He asked Zhang Xin: with so few glass bottles currently, what was the point of making so much liquor?

"To sell, obviously." Zhang Xin's plan was simple. Since glass-bottled liquor was luxury goods, he'd use simple ceramic bottles and sell to foreigners in Macau.

"Now you're joking." Guo Yi said. "How many people in Macau? How much can they consume? Besides, Europeans make fruit brandy too. Would they even like grain spirits?"

"Director Guo, this is where you don't understand." Zhang Xin chuckled. "Foreigners also have grain spirits. Isn't vodka grain-based? Also gin. Vodka is basically pure alcohol mixed with water—not hard to make. Juniper isn't rare either—grows all over the northern hemisphere. We just get some and distill with it."

"But the market's too small! Macau's population—"

"That's the trick." Zhang Xin was confident. "Foreigners have glass, but shipping to China makes it rare. Our Chinese porcelain—shipped to Europe, it becomes rare—"

"I understand." Guo Yi suddenly realized. "So that's why you want ceramic bottles!"

"Guangzhou's countryside crude liquor in glass bottles becomes 'Guoshi Wushuang.' In ceramic bottles, it becomes 'Louis XIII': mysterious ceramic from the mysterious East, holding mysterious fine wine... what a fantastic commercial gimmick."

Gou family confiscations included porcelain as the majority—inventory estimated at tens of thousands of pieces. So much porcelain couldn't find buyers in Ming China. The only option was continuing to sell to the original customers—Europeans. *Dengying Island* had recently brought porcelain samples, originally planning to test demand in Macau. Zhang Xin coincidentally thought of using ceramic vases as bottles. He selected a vase with roughly 600–700 ml capacity as packaging. This type numbered at least ten thousand in inventory.

With bottles sorted, other developments also proceeded. Currently transmigrators lacked activated carbon, so vodka was impossible. But spirits with added aromatics were feasible—so-called cordials. Theoretically, fruits, spices, flowers, or any aromatic plants would work. With so many choices, Zhang Xin was undecided and telegraphed Lingao for expert consultation.

"What aromatic plants for export liquor?" This query was urgently forwarded to Fa Shilu's desk. This plant specialist was leading several students showing interest in botany, carefully preparing specimens of locally collected plants.

Hearing the question, Fa Shilu's expression behind his glasses revealed a "finally my moment has come" look.

"That's easy. Use rhubarb."

"You're joking?" Zhang Xin, receiving the reply, thought he'd gone crazy. Rhubarb? That laxative—using it for distilled spirits? Even as a prank, after one bad experience, who'd fall for it twice?

"Not joking." Fa Shilu's reply contained detailed explanation:

Rhubarb was a common Chinese medicinal herb, originating in China's northwest and southwest. Its medicinal use probably came from western peoples' experience, later spreading inland. It had been used medicinally for at least two or three thousand years.

Since Zhang Qian opened the Western Regions, overland China-Europe trade via the Silk Road carried rhubarb from camel caravans over mountains to Central Asia's Bukhara, then through the Black Sea to Europe. For a time, rhubarb was a significant Silk Road commodity.

In later years, Central Asian merchants operated this flourishing rhubarb trade route through Persia and the Middle East. By Ming Dynasty, two rhubarb trade routes existed from China: one by sea through India, another across the Gobi and Siberia to Moscow. Portuguese-operated Macau transit trade included substantial rhubarb.

Rhubarb had long been beloved by Persian and Arab physicians. Medieval rhubarb trade flourished along the Silk Road for over a millennium. Rhubarb proved effective for stomach health and detoxification. Peoples whose diet consisted mainly of meat and dairy, before knowing about tea, relied entirely on Chinese rhubarb, regarding it as a panacea. Thus for over a thousand years, rhubarb remained one of Central, West Asian, and even European markets' most sought-after commodities. Through Arab influence, rhubarb was widely used in European medicine. Through dosage and method adjustments, it could serve as laxative for constipation, astringent for dysentery and diarrhea, or treatment for burns, boils, and abscesses.

Later, Europeans even developed edible rhubarb for pastries, dishes, and even as fruit. But to this day, medicinal rhubarb could only be grown in China. Rhubarb's status in European minds was so elevated that rhubarb festivals existed in many places worldwide. Such enthusiasm for this herb in foreign countries was probably hard for China, its homeland, to imagine.

"Wow, I thought it was just a laxative. Turns out foreigners treasure it." Zhang Xin told Guo Yi after reading the telegram. "Quick, send people to buy rhubarb. This stuff can even be an export commodity."

Guo Yi immediately sent people to investigate rhubarb on the market. He discovered rhubarb had long been a specialized export business. In China, production centered in Qinghai and Gansu, with Lixian County as the distribution center. Guangdong's export trade to Macau Portuguese was monopolized by "Quanshui Hao" warehouse, operated by Lixian people.

Though disappointed that this profitable avenue was already claimed, making rhubarb liquor was definitely a niche. Zhang Xin had people secretly purchase large quantities of rhubarb from various pharmacies, washing and drying it overnight.

Traditional Chinese herbal wines were basically made by infusion. But Zhang Xin decided to use alcohol distillation like gin. Shredded rhubarb was placed on a distillation rack, liquor steam passed through it, then recovered through coiled condenser, finally producing a slightly yellow, fragrantly scented liquid. Finally, per Xue Ziliang's suggestion, a small amount of melted white sugar solution was added, giving it a slightly sweet taste—thus becoming genuine rhubarb cordial.

As for post-distillation rhubarb residue, Zhang Xin had it all dried and sealed for storage—planning to use it as raw material for bagged rhubarb tea. Since black tea powder could be made into "fashionable" bagged red tea beloved by Chinese petty bourgeoisie, similarly processed rhubarb tea could have Europeans chasing after it.

The ceramic bottle couldn't have paper labels—they'd look cheap. After dispatch station discussion, Yan Maoda designed small ivory plaques ordered from ivory carving shops, hung on bottles with colorful brocade cords. The plaques featured traditional patterns. The brand name: "Datang Gongzhu" (Tang Princess). This tacky name made everyone express contempt for Zhang Xin. Zhang Xin retorted:

"You want something elegant like 'Goddess of Luo River'—would foreigners understand? Look at all those French famous wines—either Napoleon or Louis XIII. Aren't those even tackier? I haven't even named it Kangxi, Yongzheng, or Qianlong yet."

"Never mind, stick with your Tang Princess." Guo Yi laughed. "As long as it's not 'Consort Lan' or something."

"Consort Lan? That's not bad either. But foreigners wouldn't get China's wife-ranking system—they wouldn't appreciate the flavor. Maybe use it for domestic brands later. Could even do a whole series."

Tang Princess and Guoshi Wushuang were being intensively processed. Meanwhile, Shen Fan's recruited craftsmen had all arrived. When Baohengxiang closed, though the boss paid wages, craftsmen's normal treatment was meager with little savings. Now facing uncertain futures after the holiday, Shen Fan's timely recruitment was like rain after drought. All were grateful to this new employer. Yan Maoda comforted everyone, promising good treatment and asking them to work with peace of mind. Each person also received 200 wen as New Year's celebration money. Then he produced his jewelry design album, asking craftsmen for opinions.

Contrary to his expectations, craftsmen opposed most of Yan Maoda's modern jewelry designs—they thought these designs looked nice but were too light and flimsy, lacking substance, probably wouldn't sell well. Yan Maoda spent considerable effort without convincing them. Their perspectives still needed alignment.

Though craftsmen disagreed with Manager Yan's designs, he was the boss—the boss's prerogative to do what he wanted. Everyone just followed along. Originally, some craftsmen worried the boss's tinkering would bankrupt the business. After seeing Purple Treasure Studio's sample inventory, the consensus was: with such fine secret glass crafts, Manager Yan could tinker all he wanted without worry.

Some even offered additional processing suggestions for glassware. A jewelry craftsman named Zhu Shengyi proposed adding gold or silver rims and handles to some glass cups, plus small decorative flourishes for more luxury. Yan Maoda found such suggestions distasteful—in his view, this vulgarized glass's aesthetic. But he still expressed approval—creativity should be encouraged, not crushed for differing from his views. Besides, their aesthetic sense probably suited this spacetime better than his.
