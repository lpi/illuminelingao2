# Chapter 77: Aftermath (Part 1)

Wang Luobin's heart was still pounding when he walked out of the administrative zone. He gripped his rifle to steady his trembling hands. Today had been close—too close. The exhaustion of construction work had left everyone sluggish, and the enemy had struck with terrifying speed.

During the battle, he had emptied an entire magazine without any idea what he had actually hit. Thirty rounds, gone in an instant. When he saw the enemy scrambling up the berm, there had been no time to reload—so he had fled, shamefully. The entire experience now felt like a half-remembered dream: confused and fragmentary. By the time his senses returned, the enemy had already retreated, and somehow he had crossed from one side of the defensive line to the other with nothing more than minor scrapes. He found himself wondering if he would survive this world at all.

Brass casings littered the ground everywhere, some still smoking. *Wasteful*, he thought. The transmigrators could not manufacture cartridge casings yet; someone needed to organize a collection effort immediately.

Lost in thought, he spotted Xiao Zishan standing atop the berm, surveying the corpse-strewn field with an expression of barely suppressed revulsion.

"Zishan, why are you here?"

"Arranging the aftermath, as you might imagine." Xiao Zishan attempted a calm smile that came out looking more nauseated than composed. "Honestly, I hate seeing corpses more than anything."

"Nobody likes it." Wang Luobin likewise avoided looking at the grotesquely contorted bodies. It was clear now that even people killed by bullets did not look like in the movies—no neat hole with a token pool of blood. Instead, the rounds had mercilessly exposed piles of flesh and gore, soaking the earth purple-black. You could not imagine how much blood a person held until you saw it spilled across the ground.

A nearby corpse lay twisted, half its skull missing, exposing something white and red. The dead man's cotton armor was riddled with several bullet holes; the blood-soaked, shredded batting trembled in the breeze. Wang Luobin quickly looked away. A corpse-collection team—hastily organized from prisoners—used hook-poles originally meant for pulling down barbed wire to drag the bodies onto handcarts, wheeling them off for burial.

Watching these prisoners with their blank faces, carrying and dragging corpses while the transmigrators looked on grimly, Wang Luobin recalled a phrase they had once joked about: *"Revolution is not a dinner party, not essay-writing."* Here, in this moment, he fully understood its dark meaning. Revolution meant blood and sacrifice. Revolution, however righteous and popular, ultimately killed mostly ordinary common people.

"By the way, Engineer Wang—there's an expanded Committee meeting tonight at seven."

"Expanded meeting?"

"Yes, a post-battle review. Besides Committee members, professional group leaders and key personnel will attend. Oh, and mass representatives."

"Mass representatives?"

Xiao Zishan's expression grew cold. "Tonight there will probably be our first factional struggle."

"What? The battle went fairly well, didn't it?" In Wang Luobin's view, though the fighting had been somewhat chaotic, the results were excellent—and their own losses minimal.

"Look at it from both sides." Xiao Zishan glanced around and lowered his voice. "With such an enormous technological advantage—weapons centuries ahead of this era—Ming soldiers still managed to penetrate our base and attack. Isn't that a failure?"

"I suppose..."

"The enemy stronghold is only four kilometers away. The Committee ignored this close-range threat, sending only three people to monitor. Isn't that underestimating the enemy?"

"Mm, yes." Wang Luobin nodded repeatedly.

"When we detected the enemy leaving the city, we didn't organize forces to harass or ambush them—we simply sat and waited for them to besiege us. What kind of tactical behavior is that?"

Wang Luobin broke out in a cold sweat. "Zishan, this is trumped-up charges."

Xiao Zishan shook his head. "Since landing, we've followed a steady-construction approach, trying hard to avoid direct conflict with the Ming natives. But now it seems the aggressive line is about to seize power."

"Impossible—the Committee fundamentally agrees on strategy."

"Leadership harmony is normal. That's precisely why we're having an expanded meeting." Xiao Zishan's face was grim. "Group leaders, technical staff, mass representatives—do you know how they think?"

Wang Luobin considered this for a moment, then said firmly, "Whatever anyone says, I'll maintain the steady approach. I firmly support Director Wen's thinking." He suddenly laughed and patted Xiao Zishan's shoulder. "You're too conspiracy-minded—you see political struggle in everything."

While Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin whispered, the medical team was frantically busy in the tent. Screams rose and fell in waves. To conserve anesthetics, most of the wounded remained fully conscious during wound-cleaning and foreign-object extraction. Some required only medication; others needed suturing.

Most wounds were minor, though many were facial injuries that looked terrifying with blood everywhere. Many patients had been unconscious when brought in, alarming the doctors—but examination revealed it was from fear and stress rather than blood loss. The doctors cleaned wounds with self-mixed saline, disinfected with alcohol, removed foreign objects, and sutured.

The bacteria in this timespace had no drug resistance, so only sulfanilamide ointment was used for infection prevention. Some patients also needed tetanus shots.

"Done—all your iron pellets are out." Dr. Lan reassured a pitiful fellow. She had spent over an hour extracting twenty small fragments from the man's face—some looked like shattered coins; others were unidentifiable.

"I'll be pockmarked now. Doctor, do you do cosmetic surgery?" The patient kept crying from pain and fear.

Dr. Lan thought: *I know your intestines better than that*, but for morale she said, "No problem—I worked at a beauty clinic before."

"Then I'll book an appointment. Your skills had better be good—I'm planning to marry a princess. Let's say Princess Jiu..." Yang Baogui's wife, Zhang Ziyi *(note: the character's own request, not the author's quirk)*, saw that he was becoming delirious and injected the prepared sedative. The would-be prince consort fell asleep.

But some were seriously wounded. One man had his teeth knocked out and a hole through his cheek. Fortunately, the medical team included a dentist, complete with denture materials and equipment. Shi Niaoren worried about major maxillofacial wounds—he was not skilled at reconstructive surgery. Of the five doctors, he specialized in infectious diseases; Lan Fangfang in internal medicine and gastroenterology; Hippo in internal medicine with some orthopedic experience; as for Dr. Yang—no one wanted him treating humans. He was a veterinarian.

Wounded prisoners gathered on the ground outside the infirmary. Few moaned—most were silent, bleeding quietly. Some had wrapped their wounds with rags themselves. When guards herded them over, they were terrified, but seeing wounded prisoners carried in on stretchers and emerging bandaged, they understood—these pirates would treat them. They quieted down.

As for when their turn would come—they were not anxious. Chinese people, ancient and modern, were very patient.

Fu Bu'er also lay among them. While fleeing, he had felt a hard shove that sent him sprawling; his left leg had lost all strength. Only when pirates prodded him with rifle-bayonets did he manage to hobble to this spot. Having run desperately, he was exhausted, parched, nearly collapsed. He knew he must not fall—falling meant being left with the severely wounded by the roadside, from where no one ever rose again. Fortunately, he spotted a long-term laborer from his village, Lin Er, who was also wounded and in the group. He begged Lin to support him, and together they made it here.

The wounded but mobile prisoners sat together. Pirates brought iron buckets full of water. This group, having marched and then fled frantically, were desperately thirsty, crowding to drink. The more injured were shoved aside, groaning in pain. Guards drove them back, restoring order so everyone could drink.

Fu Bu'er drank, lay still for a while, and felt better. The bleeding seemed to have stopped; his leg did not hurt as much. He regretted being bewitched into following Huang Shoutong to fight pirates. He had been living well enough in his village: a dozen or so tenant households, three or four long-term laborers. Just because Huang Shoutong had once helped him repel bandits with militia, he had felt grateful. Hearing that these pirates were strange, he had come with five or six men to "suppress bandits" and see the spectacle. He had witnessed Huang Village militia's ferocity; this time, following the main force, he had felt safe.

He had never expected such a crushing defeat—in just a few incense-sticks' time, total rout. The pirates' firearms were too deadly. He saw Huang Shoutong nowhere—probably dead, since he had charged first.

In the distance, a dozen severely wounded men lay—too weak even to moan, only faintly groaning. Fu Bu'er knew they were beyond saving. Soon, pirates would either finish them off or bury them with the dead. He shuddered.

But his own life seemed safe—since they were treating wounds, they would not rush to kill them.

"Master, what do you think the pirates will do with us?" His laborer Ma Peng whispered. His wound was trivial—a sprained ankle while fleeing. He had been pushing sandbag carts; when the shooting started and the men in front fell, he had run immediately—never charging with the main force. If not for the unlucky sprain, he would be home by now.
