# Chapter 126: The Slave Market (Part 2)

Indeed, this wasn't a free market. The moment these well-dressed visitors entered, several slave dealers swarmed around them, hawking their merchandise.

"Look at this one—perfectly aligned glutinous teeth that could bite through gold and jade—fifteen *liang*, what do you say?"

"See this girl's hair—jet-black..."

"Mine may look older, but she's literate! Scholar-family background. The Jincui Pavilion madam offered fifty *liang*, but I refused!"

"You gentlemen are looking for servants, am I right? This girl's perfect—formerly served a wealthy Fujian household, already trained. Her figure and face are both excellent! My rock-bottom price is twenty-five *liang*!"

The cacophony momentarily stunned Xiao Zishan's group. They had never witnessed scenes like this before. Seven or eight dealers were spitting and shoving girls toward them—tugging at hair and lifting arms to display skin. These girls, ranging from eleven or twelve through their early twenties, were reasonably attractive but malnourished and thin, with sallow complexions. Being pinched and prodded by the dealers, wanting to cry but not daring, their faces showed suppressed tears and sorrow. Xiao Zishan's heart sank. It was indeed tragic. The others wore pained expressions.

Two escorts quickly pushed the dealers aside. Liu Gang turned back. "Chief Manager, shall we purchase some children?"

Xiao Zishan wavered. Apparently, the somewhat attractive girls here had mostly been acquired by the dealers already. Each girl cost six to fifty *liang*, the total running thirty to forty *liang*. Purchasing all of them would prove expensive. The ages also skewed young—were twelve or thirteen-year-olds adolescents or children? While he hesitated, Yan Maoda suggested, "Commissioner Xiao—let's simply bulk-buy. We can bargain aggressively."

"Even bargained down, it's still several hundred *liang*." Zhang Xin shook his head. "Let's start with the people the dealers aren't interested in. Once we've bought many of those, and they see we're ignoring their premium merchandise, they'll discount."

"Good approach. We planned on acquiring some children for raising and educating anyway."

"What's our budget? I need a baseline."

"Under 500 *liang*. Slightly over is acceptable."

The group bypassed the dealers and headed deeper in. Along the way, shelters and open ground appeared everywhere, packed with refugees young and old, who called out plaintively whenever people passed. Their begging cries rose and fell endlessly.

At the next crossroads, a large crowd had gathered. Approaching, they witnessed a woman clutching a man's legs, wailing and pleading. On the ground amid rags lay two children: the older perhaps three or four years old, the younger still swaddled. This woman's family had fled here; everyone else had perished. Only these three—mother and children—survived. A dealer wanted the woman but refused the children.

The woman, beaten bloody with nose and mouth streaming, lay on the ground while the dealer continued kicking and cursing her. "Stubborn whore! I don't run a charity—why would I feed your brats!" Grabbing her hair, he prepared to drag her away.

Zhang Xin was about to speak when someone shouted, "Stop!" The crowd parted, and several servants approached, escorting a young man of around thirty. The crowd whispered among themselves: "Young Master Liang has arrived."

This person approached the dealer. "You bought her—why force her to abandon her children? These two are so young—without their mother, they'll surely die!"

The dealer recognized him and quickly defended himself. "Your Honor, our business isn't easy. In her sickly condition, dragging two children along—who would purchase her? If I agreed to take them, I'd have two extra mouths to feed for nothing."

Young Master Liang grew angry. "If it's unprofitable, don't purchase her at all—why force families apart!"

The dealer smiled bitterly. "Come now—I meant well but caused evil? In her condition, if I don't buy her, her entire family starves by tomorrow! At least I'm saving one person."

The argument was nearly shameless, but it was also true. Young Master Liang found himself momentarily speechless. Zhang Xin studied the woman on the ground—barely in her early twenties, her face gaunt, with sallow skin and an unhealthy flush. Clearly ill. Young Master Liang instructed his servants to purchase some steamed buns for her. He also distributed coins to the surrounding refugees.

"Let's buy her," Guo Yi said sympathetically.

Xiao Zishan thought this wasn't ideal—she was sick, and her children were too young. They were essentially burdens. He hesitated, noticed everyone watching him expectantly, then nodded. "Buy them."

Witnessing these merchants purchase the entire family, the surrounding refugees grew agitated. Word spread rapidly. Old, young, male, female—they pressed forward, surrounding the group in an increasingly dense mass, all begging: "Take us! No payment needed—we just want food!"

Brief chaos ensued. Fortunately, Liu Gang possessed experience in such matters. He pushed through with the escorts and requested that officials and militia help restore order. Xiao Zishan produced Gao Ju's calling card and immediately distributed several thousand coins as tips. The officials dared not delay and quickly summoned licensed dealers, who began writing slave contracts in assembly-line fashion.

The surrounding people quickly noticed that these buyers strongly preferred children—especially previously unwanted toddlers. They purchased every one they saw. Parents wishing to accompany their children were also accepted. Orphans received especially warm welcome. Zhang Xin proved generous, offering no "body price" but providing 500-coin tips to the present officials for each purchase. The officials in charge simply rounded up every orphan in the area—willing or not—and wrote contracts for them. Before long, seventy to eighty children had been collected, plus forty-odd adults. The dealers, observing that these wealthy buyers ignored their merchandise entirely, hurried over offering sales. Zhang Xin shook his head. "Individual inspection wastes time. All your children—I'll take the entire lot."

After bargaining, all forty-one of the dealers' girls were purchased at ten *liang* each. Instantly, the ruined temple clearing filled with seated people.

Xiao Zishan dispatched escorts to notify Sun Kecheng: clear a mule-and-horse inn, quickly prepare fires and cooking facilities, and summon several doctors to stand by. Those who had signed contracts—twenty per batch—were escorted by pairs of escorts to the inn. For the sick or weak, mule carts were hired.

Amid the bustle, a servant approached and spoke quietly to Liu Gang. Liu Gang, adopting a respectful expression, came to Xiao Zishan. "Young Master Liang would like to invite you gentlemen for a brief conversation."

Guo Yi asked, "Who is this Young Master Liang?"

"He's a county *juren*—a successful examination candidate. He comes from a gentry family background. He's known for public-spirited generosity and enjoys an excellent local reputation. He'd like to speak with you gentlemen."

The group exchanged glances—such local gentry was worth cultivating. Zhang Xin stayed behind to continue coordinating the servant dispatch. The others followed the servant to the grounds' edge.

At the wasteland's edge stood a tea stall selling tea and steamed buns—originally the dealers' and officials' rest area. Now it was entirely occupied by Young Master Liang's servants, some twenty to thirty individuals. Everyone wondered: just a county *juren*, yet commanding such an entourage!

This Young Master Liang appeared roughly twenty-seven or twenty-eight, with a slightly pale complexion and the bearing of a young aristocrat. He wore a gray silk robe and held a gold-speckled Sichuan fan. Not extravagant, but immaculately neat. Observing them approach, he displayed no haughtiness; he stood, cupped his hands, and greeted them first.

"Liang Cunhou." The young gentleman smiled faintly, his dark pupils beneath indented brows glittering as he spoke. "May I ask your names, gentlemen? From where do you hail?"

While speaking, his gaze subtly appraised Guo Yi and the others; his eyes were exceptionally shrewd. Guo Yi felt a start: this man's penetrating look was not that of a typical dandy. He replied courteously, "We dare not presume." He proceeded to introduce everyone's names in turn.

Following the standard cover story, they presented themselves as sea merchants. Owing to unsafe waters, they had been stranded here. Liu Gang was accompanying them as local guide for sightseeing.

Servants brought tea. Young Master Liang then inquired, "Since you're sea merchants, why purchase so many servants?" His eyes betrayed suspicion.

Xiao Zishan had responses prepared. "The seas have grown increasingly treacherous in recent years. Business becomes more difficult daily. We've been contemplating buying land, establishing estates, and collecting rent. We've purchased wasteland in Qiongzhou for farming—but labor is scarce. Our tenants and laborers frequently lack spouses, so we came here to acquire some women."

"That's also a virtuous deed." Young Master Liang sighed. "Watching you earlier—showing pity for the weak and sick, refusing to separate families, accepting even toddlers—then carefully arranging food and shelter—truly benevolent hearts. We Guangzhou natives feel ashamed by comparison."

"Not at all, not at all." Guo Yi and the others demurred politely, also finding Young Master Liang somewhat theatrical. Travelers from modern times didn't fully comprehend ancient society's harshness. Since they had purchased people as servants, providing food and shelter seemed the bare minimum. Not paying wages already felt like taking enormous advantage.

Liu Gang seized the opportunity for flattery. "Young Master Liang has always shown philanthropic generosity throughout the county. Not just Nanhai County—throughout all of Guangzhou Prefecture, who doesn't know of your benevolence? You should be aware: this gruel-dispensing shelter's expenses are mostly funded by the Liang family."

Liang Cunhou dismissed this with a wave. "Times are unsettled. Fortunately, Guangdong remains peaceful. My Liang family has long received imperial grace—hardly comparable to humble origins. Having some modest property, contributing what little we can for good deeds merely relieves the court's burdens slightly. Regrettably, in this humble county, my refugee relief efforts have actually attracted criticism from local gentry." He sighed deeply.

Guo Yi, observing his distress, feigned confusion. "Young Master Liang relieves refugees—a tremendous good deed. Why would there be gossip?"
