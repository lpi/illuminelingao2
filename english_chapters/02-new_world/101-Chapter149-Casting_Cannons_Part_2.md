# Chapter 149: Casting Cannons (Part 2)

"No rush to become arms merchants." Zhang Bailin said. "We can equip smoothbores ourselves—there are too many firepower gaps right now. The three blockhouses along the Bopu road have no cannons. Bairren Fortress has zero. Also, we'll eventually build native armies. Native armies can use smoothbores for their artillery units. Later, when converting to Armstrong guns, we'll have trained qualified gunners."

As an artillery fanatic, Zhang Bailin cared most about his dreamed artillery corps. Any cannon was better than none.

Everyone found this suggestion reasonable. Even ignoring manufacturing costs and native army needs, smoothbores' operating costs were far lower. Without rifling, theoretical projectiles could be anything fitting the bore—no precision shells needed. The simplest: solid iron balls. Even in the nineteenth century, such balls remained acceptable for land and sea killing power. Actually, solid shot remained the most-fired ammunition until smoothbores exited warfare—more reliable than questionable HE shells.

"Also, we can develop special spherical shells—like HE and incendiaries."

"Another advantage you might not realize." Wang Luobin said. "Wen Director's generation gap theory."

"Generation gap theory?"

"In this timespace, at least in our lifetimes, we're outsiders. For conquest and rule, we need local assistance. So eventually we'll build native armies."

Once native armies existed, their numbers would inevitably become the transmigrator state's main armed forces.

No matter how much brainwashing, political work, or control—armies as violence machines, once realizing their power, would become greedy. They'd seek more power and benefits. The transmigrators' own strength was limited. The only solution: maintaining technological gaps.

If native troops got 20mm flintlocks—transmigrators needed bolt-action rifles to counter. This ensured tiny minorities could suppress large groups. Similarly, if transmigrators could make Type-92 infantry guns—native armies' best cannons shouldn't exceed 37mm carriage recoil guns.

Wen Desi hadn't yet perfected this theory—he spent nights contemplating future military institutions and political organizations. "Transmigrators' eternal dynasty" was his goal.

After several days' preparation, cannon casting began. As technical reserve and practice, the Artillery Group would first cast traditional smoothbores. Generally, smoothbores preferred copper—approximately one thousand-round lifespan—versus cast iron's approximately six hundred rounds. But copper was far costlier—a precious industrial material for the transmigrators. The *Deng Yingzhou*'s Guangdong pig iron was excellent quality, low sulfur—very suitable for cannon casting.

Historically, Ming-era Fujian-Guangdong pig iron was renowned for quality. Regional ironworks used charcoal fuel—sulfur content was far lower than northern coal-smelted pig iron. Sulfur was the primary factor making pig iron brittle and degraded. Ming people didn't understand the reason, but "southern-cast cannons are sturdier than northern" became consensus. Late-Ming dynasty's large-scale cannon casting all occurred in Guangdong. In 1619 (Wanli's 47th year), Xu Guangqi, commanded to train troops defending the capital, suggested recruiting Fujian-Guangdong craftsmen to cast cannons in Beijing. In Chongzhen's 3rd year, he volunteered to go to Guangzhou for cannon casting because: "Craftsmen are numerous, iron materials especially fine, prices can be saved by one-third..." In early Chongzhen, Governor-General Wang Zunde cast two hundred cannons in one batch.

Wang Luobin suggested recruiting Guangzhou cannon smiths to demonstrate traditional Chinese cannon casting—giving them intuitive concepts before improvements. Lin Shenhe said it was unnecessary: 1628's Chinese cannon smiths weren't better—even their European teachers' casting technology wasn't much higher. The transmigrators needn't learn from them.

Matteo Ricci wrote about contemporary Chinese cannon problems: insufficient powder, short range, no sights, no aiming capability. Cannon bores were wide at the mouth, narrow inside—couldn't effectively concentrate propellant gases. Bore interiors weren't properly circular; bores weren't polished. Shell sizes and even shapes were arbitrary. Shell bore gaps were excessive. Cannons lacked trunnions—and were top-heavy. Dense-packed powder caused self-explosion upon firing.

Contemporary imported "Red Barbarian Cannons" were fundamentally identical to Ming's traditional cannons—both smoothbore muzzle-loaders using black powder and solid shot. But benefiting from scientific understanding, European cannons had design advantages: thicker barrel walls, higher caliber length, barrel tapering from rear to front. Thus superior range, killing power, and safety. Barrels commonly had sights and rear apertures; barrels had trunnions—convenient for mounting on carriages, adjusting elevation, and moving.

The transmigrators' planned smoothbores could also be considered "Red Barbarian Cannons"—but with slightly advanced blueprints. They were copying early nineteenth-century French six-pounder cannons. Effective range was five hundred meters, maximum fifteen hundred meters, barrel weight approximately two hundred fifty kilograms.

Lin Shenhe and Wang Luobin decided to first use seventeenth and eighteenth-century Western cannon casting methods—also requiring clay molds.

They requested the Lumber Factory to machine specialized wooden patterns: conical wood for support bodies, turned cannon breech patterns. After completion, the first step was positive mold blanks. Starting with conical wood supports, hemp rope was densely wound into cannon shape. At this stage, positive mold blanks were approximately twenty-five centimeters oversized versus final dimensions. Then clay-water mixture was evenly layered onto blanks—each layer completely dried before adding the next.

During application, overall dimensions were slightly larger than the actual cannon—accounting for casting shrinkage. After the final layer dried and the shape was corrected, the positive mold blank was wax coated—lacking paraffin, beeswax substituted. The wax surface would be smooth—not sticking to the negative mold during the next step. The breech was a turned-wood pattern, screw-fixed to the positive mold blank.

After positive mold completion, the negative mold was made. The negative mold used clay, pottery clay, fine sand, and water mixed into semi-liquid—layered onto the positive mold. Again, each layer was fully dried before the next. After complete drying, iron bar reinforcement ribs were added externally.

After molds completely dried, the positive mold was removed. The method: cut the negative mold open at the ends, extract the positive mold's conical wood core, then pull out the wound hemp rope. The wax layer between molds allowed easy separation—if difficult, heating melted the wax, creating gaps. The breech mold was made separately.

The third mold component was the core—a clay-encased iron rod, generally cylindrical. The powder chamber might have a special shape. The core was inserted into the main mold; iron core supports at the mold rear and a pottery ring at the cannon mouth fixed the core in position.

The separately made breech negative mold was reassembled with the barrel negative mold. Three molds firmly assembled, then fired to fully harden. Finally, molds were buried cannon-mouth-up in a compacted earth pit beside the cupola. Jiang Ye designed and installed a wooden hoist to lift entire molds—because during cupola construction, cannon casting wasn't considered, and the steelmaking workshop floor was hardened. They built another cupola in the casting workshop—but since only melting, not iron smelting, no regenerator was used. The runner system was one-to-four. Ji Wusheng personally guided; Zhan Wuya had casting experience—the first casting succeeded.

After pouring, twenty-four-hour insulation before excavating from the pit. After further cooling, external reinforcement ribs were removed, molds broken, and the Artillery Group used hammers and chisels to clear residual slag from the barrel.

Finally, a cast-iron six-pounder cannon was cast. It still needed further processing: bore polishing. The Mechanical Group made a simple boring mill—power wasn't electric or diesel, but a donkey. This donkey drove a capstan rotating a boring bar with a high-carbon-steel boring head.

Bore polishing greatly improved bore surface smoothness—but measurements showed polishing couldn't truly cut cylinders or correct core deviation from casting. Throughout the process, hard residues severely damaged boring bars. In other words: this process was too costly.

"No wonder by 1713, the drilling method replaced it." Lin Shenhe was somewhat dejected. The drilling method: first casting solid iron rods, then drilling bores. First used by the Dutch—but not widespread until the late eighteenth century. British naval arsenals still used the above casting method for naval guns until 1770.
