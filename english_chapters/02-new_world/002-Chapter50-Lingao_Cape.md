# Chapter 50: Lingao Cape

If anything made Lingao County widely known in this timespace, it was "Lingao Cape." This had always been a strategic point on Hainan Island. Yu Eshui had specifically noted at the pre-departure intelligence briefing that since the Yuan Dynasty, Lingao Cape had maintained a beacon tower. During the Ming, the Bopu Patrol Office was established here to "examine and interrogate travelers." In the Zhengde era, thirty archers and three patrol boats were stationed here. By the end of the Wanli era, there remained only twelve archers—presumably with at most a single small boat. However, this place had long served as a typhoon shelter for Lingao's fishermen, so they might encounter local fishing boats.

Beiwei carefully scanned the terrain ahead from the bow. Three months before D-Day, some Military Group personnel had conducted a staff reconnaissance trip to Hainan in the twenty-first-century timespace. They'd focused on the planned landing sites: Lingao Cape–Bopu Port, with Maniao Bay, Hongpai Bay, and Houshui Bay as alternates.

As landing recon team leader, Beiwei had not only examined the terrain in detail during that trip but had subsequently reviewed the local topography multiple times from archived materials—determined to be absolutely certain.

The eastern sky was whitening. Everything on shore came into crystal clarity through the binoculars. The motorboat had now entered a broad bay. According to the chart, this should be Longhao Bay southwest of Lingao Cape—a calm area where fish schools often came to rest, one of Lingao's important fishing grounds.

Beiwei searched with his binoculars and soon spotted a familiar triangular cape extending roughly one kilometer from northwest to southeast—no mistake, this was Lingao Cape.

Here, Lingao Cape formed a natural breakwater, 1.5 kilometers long and 500 meters wide. The middle of the causeway was entirely sand washed up by the sea, crystal white, forming a sandy path. The twenty-first-century cape had stone bunkers, watchtowers, and a lighthouse built by the Qing customs office in the nineteenth year of Guangxu (1893). In this timespace, the causeway lay empty, but the overall landform differed little.

"Slow down. Watch the water below," Beiwei reminded. Besides the portion above water, Lingao Cape had a considerable submerged section. Though the motorboat's draft was negligible, scraping bottom on a reef would still be costly.

The seawater was crystal clear; white sand between underwater rocks was almost distinctly visible. The boat passed Lingao Cape and entered Changgong Bay. Even without binoculars, the crew could see Bopu Cape extending southeast. Changgong Bay was thus embraced by two capes—about two kilometers wide, the inner bay calm as glass, sand bright, water transparent, only tiny white waves rolling at the shore.

"I really want to swim here," someone said.

"Build a sanatorium here someday!"

Everyone laughed. Saying this now felt somewhat absurd—like impoverished people discussing what they'd do once they became rich.

Beiwei carefully warned the helmsman not to venture too deep into the bay—an arrow flying their way would be no joke.

"Captain, what's that mountain?" Li Jun pointed at an enormous oval shape emerging from the greenery on distant Bopu Cape.

"That's not a mountain. It's the beacon tower."

"The beacon tower is that big?!" Everyone on the boat was amazed. Their mental image of beacon towers was the sand-worn earthen platforms scattered along the Silk Road. But this one remained sixteen meters high after four hundred years. Now Beiwei estimated it at over twenty meters, with forty-five-degree slopes—at first glance, it resembled a small hill common in hilly terrain. The entire tower was built of laid stone blocks, with a core of rammed earth. Completely different from the twenty-first-century ruins overgrown with weeds and trees.

"Everyone stay alert! There are Ming soldiers stationed here. Pull down your face shields!"

At the command, everyone lowered the visors on their riot helmets. The motorboat quickly rounded Bopu Cape and entered the southeastern waters.

"Bopu Port!"

This was the estuary of the Wenlan River, Lingao County's largest waterway. This river, less than ninety kilometers total, here formed a broad harbor with its mouth facing north. The shadowy dark island in the distance was Red Stone Island—Bopu Port's eastern boundary.

"Reduce speed! Enter the harbor. Alert status!"

The harbor beach opposite Red Stone Island was silty sand, covered with lush mangroves. In some places, burnt and logged patches were starkly visible. Behind the mangroves stretched undulating tableland—not high, with uneven crests. On the harbor's south side, opposite these mangroves, lay a completely different environment: overgrown weeds and what appeared to be ruins of buildings.

The beach was littered with withered seaweed and many uprooted trees—evidence of a recent typhoon. One important reason for choosing to land after the ninth lunar month was to avoid the typhoons and storm surges that swept through around the fifteenth of the eighth month every year.

The harbor interior was quite open. Near the water grew extensive mangroves; tidal flats crisscrossed everywhere. Various waterbirds circled and landed overhead. The water was murky—clearly a muddy bottom. The shore lay flat with slight undulation. Unexpectedly, not a single fishing boat was visible through the binoculars—something wasn't right...

"This place is really desolate!" someone exclaimed.

"This is what the Committee called a 'well-developed county'? What are undeveloped places then—virgin forest?"

Beiwei shot an annoyed glance at the speaker—civilian life too long had eroded basic military discipline.

Though Bopu was called Hainan's gateway, pirates raiding Qiongbei had long used it as a shortcut. Over time, except for some *Danjia* fishermen who scattered here to fish, it remained desolate well into the Kangxi era. The contemporary Lingao magistrate Fan Shu, visiting and sighing, composed a poem describing the environment:

> *Riding alone, I've often passed this shore,*
> *In smoky desolation, the old customs station;*
> *White waves filling my view at the Danzhou border,*
> *Yellow-hatted Danjia folk by their salt-fire stations;*
> *Three-foot eaves low against the typhoon-mother,*
> *A fist-sized stone shrine to the Dragon God...*

"Kill the engine! Measure the depth."

They had complete Bopu Harbor hydrographic data. According to records, the estuary's depth ranged from two to ten meters. But this was the seventeenth century—four hundred years of silt and channel changes would create significant errors.

The motorboat began to drift slowly. Li Jun raised a steel Armed Police riot shield, covering the hydrographic personnel as they lowered the lead line.

Beiwei knew the boat was now a perfect target—completely exposed on open water. He wasn't afraid of an arrow—those crude iron arrowheads couldn't pierce stab-resistant gear or helmets. But if someone had a small cannon hidden in the shore grass, a blast of iron shot and lead from fifty meters would definitely cause casualties.

Military Group members held their weapons ready, rounds chambered, watching every corner.

Just then, on the beacon tower, a figure was also observing the small boat in the bay.

This person wore a bowl-shaped iron helmet encrusted with thick yellow rust and a leather cuirass rotted beyond recognition—issued when the court had augmented Hainan garrison equipment in the tenth year of Jiajing. He held a saber of the same vintage; its wooden scabbard had fallen apart and been crudely bound with rattan.

Behind him stood a soldier with an equally rusty iron helmet, no armor, wearing a tattered mandarin-duck combat jacket impossible to distinguish inside from outside. He carried a bow and arrows and had a similarly ancient saber at his waist.

Fu Baiwen was from Qiongshan County. He'd studied martial arts in his youth and achieved a "martial xiucai" degree but never passed higher. Near forty, he'd finally obtained a lowly ninth-grade patrol inspector post, commanding twelve archers to guard this "Qiong Sea Gateway." Though called a gateway, transmigrators were few; mostly he examined *Danjia* fishermen and small traders from Leizhou. No profit here, just desolation. What he saw most frequently were pirates.

Hainan, situated on crucial sea lanes, had always been plagued by extreme pirate activity. Throughout history, pirates had raided Lingao multiple times, even besieged the county seat. In the eleventh year of Shunzhi, they'd actually captured the Lingao magistrate. Ming and Qing governments had no real countermeasures—just built more beacon towers. Any unusual activity at sea meant lighting the signal fire.

When pirates anchored here for water, everyone kept the peace. But once they entered the harbor and launched boats, all Inspector Fu could do was run to the beacon tower to light the dung-fire, then lead his men to hide. Once the beacon was lit, the fire was visible within a radius of tens of *li* along the Wenlan River all the way to Lingao town. Commoners would flee; city gates would immediately close.

Every year after the fifteenth of the eighth lunar month, when typhoons subsided, pirate coastal raids became frequent. The fishing boats that usually sheltered here had recently stopped coming. The patrol archers naturally couldn't slack off—however meager, it remained a salary.

The reconnaissance squad's motorboat had been spotted by the tower lookout as soon as it entered Changgong Bay. Normally, he wouldn't bother the Inspector over such a small boat. But this one traveled incredibly fast, which startled him. When the boat entered the river mouth and he saw the occupants—all burly men in iron helmets and black armor carrying black fire-sticks—this was serious indeed. He immediately summoned Inspector Fu to the tower.

"Inspector Fu, who are these people?" The archer quietly asked from behind. "Should we go down and question them?"

"Never seen them." Though Hainan was a southern frontier, its people were worldly. Fu Baiwen had seen Japanese, Franks, and Red-Hair barbarians. But this boat and these people were beyond his knowledge. The only thing clear was that this group was not to be trifled with.

"Looks like they're sounding the depth?"

Fu Baiwen nodded. As the small boat drifted, someone behind that dark shield was constantly raising and lowering a rope. Sounding depths meant a large ship was coming.

"Light the fire?"

He hesitated briefly, then made up his mind. The visitors were few but fully armored—already criminals violating the law, certainly no law-abiding citizens. Secretly sounding depths meant a large force was approaching. Dawn was breaking; the commoners would soon be out earning their living. If these bandits raided, they'd suffer grievously.

"Light the fire!"
