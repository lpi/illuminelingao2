# Chapter 86: Cement

Wang Luobin had purchased a complete set of small cement equipment using the shaft-kiln method, but this system required large amounts of coal—and transmigrators did not have coal yet.

Other raw materials for cement—clay, limestone, gypsum—had been found locally. The brick kiln's clay pit had low sand content and a reddish tint—high iron content—very suitable for burning cement. For lime, although the shell/oyster lime from Bopu had low calcium carbonate content, chalk layers could be found near the clay pit. Gypsum had not been found nearby yet, but adding or not adding gypsum did not matter much.

After careful consideration, Wang Luobin decided against installing the complete equipment that had temperature and material requirements. Instead, he would make do with a substitute cement to meet current construction needs. This substitute was also called "artificial pozzolanic cement"—some rural areas had produced it in the past. It did not need complex equipment or procedures. Simply put: crush fired bricks, tiles, or pottery into fine powder, or directly calcine lime and clay in a kiln. This substitute cement had an extremely simple process—calcination temperature of 600–800°C sufficed, much lower than the 1450°C needed for Portland cement. Performance roughly matched the oldest "pozzolanic cement." The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was built with this cement; during the Anti-Japanese War, it was widely used for infrastructure in the southwestern rear.

Wang Luobin only knew this stuff existed; he did not know if it actually worked. So he first had some fired red bricks brought from the brick works for experiments. Laborers hand-broke bricks into small pieces. Grinding was originally planned using human or horse-drawn stone rollers—they had found various stone rollers at Bairren Rapids quarry. After an hour, efficiency proved terrifyingly low: only ten kilograms ground.

After grinding and sieving, Wang Luobin mixed the powder with lime, added water, and stirred evenly. Under the Building Group's watching eyes, the mixture was used to lay a wall. Everyone was excited, wanting to see if this legendary substitute cement actually worked.

After drying, this fired-clay substitute cement proved completely usable. It could not compare with real Portland cement, of course, but worked as a building-material bonding agent—could even make concrete with modest strength requirements.

This discovery thrilled everyone. Even bricklayer Zhao Wu, who had been smashing bricks, was excited. He had been a mason for over a decade—building and laying walls always using yellow earth, lime, and water mixed as bonding. The fanciest was glutinous-rice-juice mortar. These people had made mortar that firmly bonded bricks just by crushing brick powder! Beyond his imagination. *Are they really pirates?* He made sure to remember this trick. Learning this, he was almost glad he had been captured.

Cement was the transmigrators' first truly modern industrial product—though still not quite up to standard. But for transmigrator construction, this was a crucial step. Cement was modern construction's fundamental material.

But grinding efficiency was still too low. At this rate, 24-hour continuous grinding produced only 240 kg—negligibly low.

After the Machinery Group studied it, they manufactured a simple automatic grinder. Using two stone rollers from Bairren Rapids quarry, they made an electric double-roller, connected by a through-shaft to a vertical shaft with bearings to reduce rotational resistance. A swinging frame with flywheel drove a bevel gear via chain, rotating the stone rollers.

But adding material and sieving was still manual—not just inefficient but liable to cause silicosis, a nearly incurable occupational disease. Though workers were captured natives, labor was also transmigrator wealth. Zhan Wuya and several Machinery Group members studied it, adding a wooden wheel to the bevel gear, using a belt to drive a grain-winnowing fan-sieve. Material fed through a hopper atop the vertical shaft; ground powder automatically flowed down a ramp into the fan-sieve, using wind to separate coarse from fine. Coarse particles returned via conveyor hopper to the hopper above the stone roller for re-grinding. This iron-wood-stone contraption could crush nearly one ton of brick material daily.

With cement, building the Hoffmann kiln also required refractory bricks. Refractory bricks were one of modern industry's foundations—without them, not just Hoffmann kilns and cement kilns, but even future blast furnaces were hopeless. Fortunately, Lingao produced refractory materials locally. Transmigrators found aluminum oxide and silicon oxide for firing refractory bricks near the brick kiln—easily producing refractory bricks.

With refractory bricks and cement, building a Hoffmann kiln was child's play for the Building Group. Days later, the Hoffmann kiln's brick-red chimney spewed thick black smoke skyward for the first time.

"Damn, that's beautiful." Someone murmured. Transmigrators' eyes showed intoxicated expressions. What they had once hated—symbols of backwardness and pollution—transmigrators now saw as the most beautiful things. Wang Luobin, watching the smoke, somewhat understood why the Great Leader had shown no regard for Beijing's ancient city walls, readily demolishing them, yet proclaimed "Beijing's chimneys should be as dense as forests." Ancient city walls were utterly familiar to Chinese of that era; scarce modern industry was the mark of national progress.

Now this Hoffmann kiln's brick-red chimney stood proudly amid the Wenlan River's green mountains and clear waters. For transmigrators, there was no sense of incongruity—it proclaimed the formal beginning of their industrial age.

Before firing began, the Hoffmann kiln needed warming. The Building Group went to Bopu to build a lumber drying kiln there. With a proper drying kiln, the Lumber Team could continuously provide qualified lumber products to the Bairren Fortress construction site—rather than the current unevenly-dried, prone-to-warp makeshift lumber from earthen kilns. Wang Luobin did not participate in this—Luo Duo would find books for drying-kiln dimensions and materials. He had never seen such things during his Guangxi days.

Watching the construction crew climb onto farm trucks heading to Bopu, he suddenly remembered something and immediately called Mei Wan. "Discuss with the Lumber Team—build a wood distillation kiln too."

"Distillation kiln?" Mei Wan did not know what this was.

"A charcoal-burning kiln. Tell Luo Duo later—he knows. Study it first—see when it can start production."

Without coal, they would have to substitute with charcoal for now. Wood distillation produced not just charcoal but also wood tar for chemical feedstock—a complex compound yielding many useful substances. Charcoal's heating value rivaled coal.

The Cafeteria Office's food truck brought meals to brick-factory workers. Wu De had by now taught them to queue through beatings. Queuing was basic social order—a way everyone roughly and equitably accessed resources. Why Chinese people disliked queuing seemed unrelated to personal character, perhaps largely due to long-term resource scarcity. Whoever obeyed order lost out; over time, everyone stopped liking queues, rushing when opportunity arose, shoving others behind. Wu De thought there was some truth to this.

Like meal distribution now—though each team had captains maintaining order, the whole line was still somewhat chaotic, everyone hoping to be at the front. Only transmigrator intimidation barely preserved queue discipline.

Wu De was satisfied with his laborers' work. Throughout construction, he appeared to just casually stroll and observe. Most worked diligently—not from self-discipline but competition among the five captains. None wanted their team to look bad before Wu De. "Collaborators are worse than invaders"—these five captains were indeed zealous in driving work. But that was not enough. Wu De knew laborers' diligence was still only from fear. Willing, voluntary effort required other stimulation.

Wu De decided to start with food. After each prisoner received a bowl of gruel, Wu De had someone bring a basket. This oddly-shaped Machinery Group creation reeked of dried seafood—the Cafeteria Office's unsuccessful salted-fish product...

"Today, Wang Tian's team worked best and most." Wu De announced from a dirt mound. "So their whole team gets one extra salted fish each."

This bonus made many eyes bulge. Since capture, two meals of gruel daily—most could endure that; many had lived half-starved since birth. But without even pickled radish, drinking gruel meant frequent urination, and without salt, bodies weakened after two days.

"Wang Tian commanded well—gets two." This reward made Wang Tian's face glow with excitement. The other four felt sour. Extra fish was trivial; losing face was serious. All were calculating how to severely punish a few slackers tonight—killing the chicken to scare the monkeys.
