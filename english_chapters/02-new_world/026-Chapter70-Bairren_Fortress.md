# Chapter 70: Bairren Fortress

In the following days, Fu Youdi swiftly completed his transformation from honest farmer to petty tyrant. To his peasant mind, "skimming off the top" was natural law.

At first, he just scooped himself more of the thick stuff, the meat, when distributing meals. Then he was also given work assignments. Wu De only told them daily quotas—not how to divide the work. So Fu Youdi assigned everything to the other four, doing almost nothing himself. Some resisted, also slacking; Fu Youdi did not dare intervene then. But at mealtime, the power of food allocation showed—those who had slacked got nothing but thin soup from the top. Wang Tian, also a local native, got along with him, becoming the favored one—less work, more food. The other three became victims: more work, less food. One evening at dinner, a small conflict erupted. Lin Xing led a revolt, knocking Fu Youdi face-first into the mud. Wu De did not intervene in the rights and wrongs—he just had everyone involved lashed fifty times. Lin Xing, who struck first, got one hundred.

Undoubtedly, that night the five prisoners' burning buttocks matched burning mutual hatred. Fu Youdi abandoned all pretense. He began openly shouting at Lin Xing, shamelessly skimming rations. The conflict deepened. Per Wu De's observation, the five split into three factions: Fu Youdi drew Wang Tian to his side; Lin Xing tried to resist; both tried to recruit the two neutral bystanders. Wu De sometimes deliberately created friction—citing poor work or inadequate cleaning—cutting rations. When one person's mistake starved everyone, mutual blame deepened their divisions.

The smarter, bolder Lin Xing mustered courage to complain directly to Wu De about Fu Youdi—despite his halting, sometimes incoherent Mandarin. So Wu De gave the fattening Fu Youdi a beating—letting him know his limits—while showing obvious favoritism toward Lin Xing. The exploited prisoners gratefully appreciated Wu De's perceptiveness, and now knew Lin Xing had reported. Even the laziest began eagerly learning Mandarin.

"Ah De, you are amazing! Did you drug them?" Xiong Buyou found his students suddenly diligent—after dinner, instead of rushing to sleep, they came to him for language lessons.

Wu De chuckled. This outcome was not at all surprising. Human nature in the 17th century was not fundamentally different from the 21st.

Wu De's new assignment was just a small episode in daily work. Though later seen as significant, at the time few paid attention. All focus was on highway construction progress.

Except for minor leveling and shaping done by hand, the entire route used mechanized construction. The Building Group grew increasingly proficient at organizing work. By D+6—the seventh day of the ninth lunar month in the first year of Chongzhen, October 3, 1628—the full twelve-kilometer Bopu–Bairren Rapids simple highway was completed, one day later than the Committee demanded. Though the terrain from Bairren Rapids to Bopu appeared level, there was actually slight gradient. The highway was not straight but gently curved.

The fortified posts along the highway were retained. In the future, they would be expanded and hardened into small fortresses to protect the road.

As for Bairren Rapids itself—it would become the transmigrators' first city in this timespace. The Committee's plans for this base...

The Building Group had already given this new city a simple, apt name: "Bairren Fortress."

"Has a martial-arts-novel feel." Mei Wan stood spiritedly at Bairren Rapids' cliff edge. This was the spot where the 21st-century hydroelectric station's overflow dam stood. The drop to the powerhouse was about sixteen meters. The Wenlan River made a sharp turn here. Nine rocky levels formed Bairren Rapids' sloping cascade—fast-flowing, thundering—the famous "Roar of Bairren Rapids," audible for over twenty *li* around.

"Lord of Bairren Fortress!" Yan Quezhi waved his ranging pole, striking a pose. Several others also threw a few kung-fu gestures.

"Is the master plan done?"

"Done." Li Xiaolu unrolled a 1:1000 master plan. For this "base conveying the 21st century's torch of civilization," everyone from the Building Group to various Committee departments had offered views and suggestions. Li Xiaolu synthesized them, deciding to design according to late-1970s "socialist new countryside" planning concepts. There had been specialized designs for "commune headquarters"-level townships—considering administration, education, small industry, and agricultural production buildings—a city-rural hybrid, balancing industry, agriculture, and sidelines in a new rural residential model.

Bairren Fortress's plan spread along both banks of the Wenlan River. Main city district and hydroelectric zone on the east bank; heavy industry on the west.

The hydroelectric zone would hold the power station and water treatment plant. In the future, a small inland wharf and warehouse would be added.

The main city was about one hundred meters from the riverside hydroelectric zone. This plot had lower groundwater and good soil-bearing capacity. The entire surface sloped about 4% from south to north—natural drainage sufficient for rainwater.

At the main city's southern end was the water supply station. With the gradient, piped water needed no pressurization—a simple water tower could supply the whole city.

The main city was zoned by function:

**Administrative Zone** — central area, along the north-south main road, government institutions arranged in sequence.

**Culture, Education, and Health Zone** — east of the administrative zone; planned schools, clinic, library, simple stadium and club.

**Residential Zone** — northeastern area, largest footprint. Though simple dormitories did not need this much space, considering all 500+ would eventually form families—possibly large ones—land was reserved generously.

**Industrial Goods Warehouse Zone** — storing all materials, equipment, and machinery from the 21st-century timespace, including munitions. This area would have its own perimeter wall.

**Agricultural Zone** — including agricultural processing plants, granaries, veterinary station, vegetable greenhouses, livestock pens, plus a biogas digester.

**Industrial Zone** — various machinery, parts manufacturing, and equipment factories.

The main city was completely planned by function. Residential and industrial zones were separated, maximizing comfort and safety.

The heavy-industry zone, being highly polluting and considering Lingao's prevailing northeast winds, was placed downwind on the Wenlan's west bank—including the planned steel mill, chemical plant, and pollution-heavy industries like paper mills.

Outside the main city's east gate, an open commercial trading zone would be established for exchanging agricultural products, local specialties, and small goods with natives.

The ambitious Bairren Fortress master plan won unanimous Committee approval. Almost immediately, some people began fighting over their department's position on the future "Chang'an Avenue"—which ministry building would be closest to Committee Hall nearly came to blows. Finally, Wen Desi repeatedly explained that the current plan had no ministry buildings, no Committee Hall—just a marked foundation for administrative buildings. For years to come, everyone would share offices.

To begin construction, powering with ship auxiliaries like on the beach was no longer practical. The Committee had options: diesel generators, wind turbines, solar power—each with pros and cons. Inland wind was limited; 300-watt wind turbines were barely useful beyond lighting. Solar output was also limited. To save diesel, diesel generators were reserved for emergencies only.

A tractor hauled a strange-looking contraption from the beach base on a trailer: black cast iron, with a smokestack and flywheel, exposed pipes, valves, pressure gauges... very steampunk. Everyone crowded around curiously.

"Portable steam engine." Ma Qianzhu answered simply. This "locomobile" combined boiler and steam engine in one mobile power unit. Simple structure, easy operation and maintenance—could be mobile or fixed. High efficiency, reliable operation, capable of continuous long-term work. Versatile: irrigation, drainage, rice milling, flour grinding, oil pressing, driving generators or directly powering industrial machinery—comparable to modern rural single-cylinder diesels. Its disadvantage: much heavier than diesels. But for the transmigrators, weight was not the issue. The key advantage: the boiler was not picky—wood, brush, low-grade coal—any fuel worked, saving precious diesel.

Currently, locomobiles still had a market even with diesel engines commonplace. The Committee had purchased six. Two were Czech-made, single-drum fire-tube horizontal compound condensing locomobiles—flywheels spinning at 1000 rpm, maximum 290 horsepower (213.15 kW)—driving generators, producing over 200 kWh per hour. These were fixed; they required level ground. The other four were 100-hp mobile units, towable by truck, tractor, or even horses.
