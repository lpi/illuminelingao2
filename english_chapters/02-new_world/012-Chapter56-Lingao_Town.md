# Chapter 56: Lingao Town

Guo Yi perked up at this. No wonder leaders often traveled abroad—foreign monks really did chant different sutras. He eagerly tugged at Xue Ziliang for more details.

Xue Ziliang asked: "Have you heard of the World Republic case?"

"Not really."

"It's a very typical case—I think it fits our situation perfectly." This was a bizarre 1960 case. A man named Fritz Bothe, who claimed to be Adolf Hitler's illegitimate son, created a so-called World Republic. He publicly announced in European media that on December 16, 1960, the Third Flying-Saucer Fleet from Venus would land at Berlin's Tempelhof Airport. Az, Supreme Commander of the Cosmic Commando, would immediately proclaim Earth-man Fritz Bothe as President of the World Republic's Supreme Government. President Fritz would immediately demand all Earth's militaries surrender, destroy all ammunition depots, and confine all soldiers to barracks.

This case was no different from countless fraud cases, except: Fritz Bothe committed no actual fraud. He genuinely believed he was Venus's chosen World Republic president. Consequently, he was never held criminally liable.

"Doesn't this resemble our situation? I believe everyone here, top to bottom, thinks they've reached a new world. In reality, this might just be some deserted island in Vietnamese waters—possibly rented by someone with ulterior motives in the organization."

"So it's just a foreign version of playing emperor..." Xiao Guo yawned. *What's so special?* Since 1949, China's backwaters had produced at least a dozen self-proclaimed true emperors. He'd reviewed those files when bored—most cases were highly entertaining.

The explanation was decent but still couldn't account for all signals disappearing. While mulling this over, the cabin door opened. Someone tossed in three blankets.

"Rest well. You're on the road tomorrow." The person delivered this brief message.

"Looks like they'll move us tomorrow. I need good rest so I can walk." Xue Ziliang, well fed, chatted a while more, then grew sleepy, wrapped himself in a blanket, and slept. Salina, who'd barely spoken, also slept.

As a true Chinese person, Xiao Guo deeply understood Chinese subtlety. "On the road" was an inauspicious phrase for someone in captivity—it could mean execution.

Meng Xian, who'd tossed in the blankets, clearly didn't realize his casual remark kept Xiao Guo awake half the night, filling pages of a notebook with farewell letters he kept writing, crossing out, and rewriting.

Night fell. Lingao town lay in deathly silence.

After the evening watch, curfew had emptied the streets. The dark town felt especially gloomy. Soldiers stood at every intersection of the stone-paved main road, ready to question passersby. Today, many people had streamed in from outlying villages—families with pigs, cattle, chickens, ducks, cats, and dogs. The county had opened all temples and shrines to shelter these refugees. Still, many camped along both sides of the stone road. Even the animals seemed to sense disaster coming; few made noise. Only children who didn't understand were still crying, quietly hushed by adults.

Red or white paper lanterns hung outside government offices and temples, dim light swaying under the eaves. In the faint glow, proclamations were visible on walls. Occasionally, night watchmen passed with small lanterns, striking their wooden clappers, accompanied by local militia.

The city walls were very quiet. Lanterns hung at intervals. Militia patrolled the ramparts. Since the Bopu beacon-tower alarm that morning, since Patrol Inspector Fu had fled back in panic, the town's atmosphere had grown extremely tense. In the street shadows, people whispered.

"Do you think the pirates have withdrawn?" someone asked quietly under the eaves.

"No news from the villages yet. Hard to say."

"Usually these pirates grab what they can and leave. Maybe their ships have already gone."

"If they'd really left, would Magistrate Wu have sent for reinforcements?" someone said mysteriously. "This afternoon, Vice-Magistrate Wu went to Housuo for troops."

*(Housuo: a garrison belonging to the Hainan Interior Guard's 5,000-household system, with two stations in Lingao County.)*

"The pirates are that strong?" A thin, dark man was uneasy. He was a migrant farmer—originally from Fujian, renting land to farm. After years of hard work, he'd finally built a small estate, and last year he'd brought his newly wedded wife from home. Now she clutched a piglet tightly, surrounded by two large bamboo cages of chickens and ducks—the smell foul—but she didn't mind.

"Not just strong—very strong." A small trader who'd apparently seen something of the world spoke dramatically. "These past years, the waters of Liangguang have had no peace. Yang Er, Liu Xiang—even the government forces can't handle them. Admiral Yu has launched how many campaigns, losing more than winning. I hear the court is considering offering them amnesty."

"Amnesty means peace, right?" someone said.

"Peace? I doubt it." The trader said indignantly. "Yang Er accepted amnesty once—still terrorized common folk. Every time I've crossed the sea these past two years, my heart's in my throat. Fu San from Silkworm Village was killed at sea—not even his body was found..."

"These pirates won't attack the county seat, will they?"

"The last siege was thirty years ago during the Ti'nan Village Li people's uprising. My grandfather was even conscripted as militia to defend the walls. Those Li—like crazy people, attacking in waves like an endless sea. Later, Ma Shi came again; they didn't attack, but the gates stayed sealed."

*(Note: The Ti'nan Village Li uprising was in the twenty-fifth year of Wanli; the Ding'an Li man Ma Shi's uprising was in the twenty-seventh year of Wanli.)*

"Surely this time will pass safely too."

Just then, the Magistrate's Clerk walked by with several men. Seeing the animated discussion, he shouted angrily: "You savages—what nonsense are you spreading? Keep running your mouths and I'll charge you with disturbing public order!"

*(Note: In Ming Hainan, city folk called rural people "savages" [manzi]; rural people called city folk "red fathers" [chifu]. Both were insults.)*

When the official showed his authority, everyone fell silent. Since curfew that morning, a dozen unlucky souls had been beaten or put in the cangue for talking too much or looking wrong.

After the Clerk went far, the trader muttered: "Only knows how to bully little people. Go fight the pirates if you're so tough..."

"Say less!" An old man stopped him. "What time is this? Wagging useless tongues."

That night, Lingao's magistrate sat in his reception hall. His name was Wu Mingjin, from Nan-Zhili, nearly fifty, hair already gray. He'd been a *juren* but failed the higher examinations for years. He'd finally been assigned a county post through the civil-service placement system—and it was this remote southern borderland. Though Lingao had been a county for ages—even counting from when the county seat moved to Mo Village, that was five hundred years—to this Nan-Zhili native, it was still barbarous wasteland. Since taking office, he'd tried to do right by the people: water management, land reclamation, encouraging farming and sericulture... hoping to leave a good name. But years of natural and man-made disasters—coastal beacon towers alarming multiple times monthly, pirates striking everywhere, Bopu, Shipai, Maniao—the government forces were helpless. The county could only close its gates and wait, using the "pirates leave when sated" strategy. Last autumn, another typhoon destroyed countless houses and villages, displacing people. He'd set up gruel stations and collected unclaimed corpses—but epidemic still broke out, killing many.

*(Note: According to Lingao County Annals, between the Tianqi and Chongzhen eras, five magistrates are recorded. Ye Yao and Wu Mingjin were in office during late Tianqi / early Chongzhen. Since exact tenure dates are unknown, I've used the latter.)*

Originally, this beacon-tower alert hadn't concerned him much—pirate raids were routine here. But what Patrol Inspector Fu Baiwen reported after fleeing back genuinely alarmed him.

The pirates' vessels were never-before-seen "giant ships"—hulls taller than Lingao's Confucian Temple's main hall. Each accompanying vessel was larger than government warships. They used neither sails nor oars yet moved freely across the water—like magic.

Most inconceivable: the ships were made of iron! Iron ships that float? This was far beyond his comprehension. Humans instinctively fear what exceeds their understanding.

When he actually saw these people landing, Fu Baiwen had immediately led his men in a panicked sprint back to the county seat—instinctively sensing these people were unlike any pirates or traders he'd ever seen or heard of. They certainly hadn't come to Lingao for a few loads of salted fish or a few bushels of rice!

Wu Mingjin couldn't rely solely on his account—military men often exaggerated threats to avoid fighting. Amid the chaos, he'd sent a *Danjia*-born runner familiar with the Bopu area to investigate. When the runner returned at noon, he could barely speak coherently. From his jumbled account, Magistrate Wu learned: these pirates numbered over a thousand. Once ashore, they had vehicles that moved on the beach without horses or oxen—people just sat in them and they moved. Some vehicles could effortlessly lift enormous iron boxes and carry them around... and many things he couldn't describe. In short: this group was extremely uncanny.

Now Wu was genuinely worried. He didn't believe in sorcery. Having traveled through Guangdong en route to Hainan, he'd seen Portuguese ships and cannons, even telescopes. He knew overseas peoples possessed marvelous devices. What if these pirates attacked the county using some foreign contraption? Lingao's forces: only runners and yamen clerks, eighty militia, and the Patrol Inspector's twelve archers who'd returned—barely over a hundred total.

So he'd urgently sent Vice-Magistrate Wu Ya with silver to Housuo for reinforcements. Wu Ya had just returned with a report: the Housuo commander agreed to send thirty men and one cannon tomorrow morning—but afterward, each man required one *shi* of rice as reward.
