# Chapter 139: New System (Part 2)

The transmigrators decided to implement a completely different civil administration model in their fully controlled Bairren Production Teams One and Two—namely, China's 1960s–70s People's Commune system.

The People's Commune system had existed from 1958 to 1985—twenty-seven years total. Its most memorable impression: "big and public." However, the actually functioning people's communes followed the 1962 *Revised Draft of Rural People's Commune Work Regulations*—adopting three-tier ownership with production teams as the base, while maintaining the commune's "political-economic integration" structure.

Under this system, people's communes were simultaneously rural political units and production management entities. Commune secretaries managed not just party affairs—but also industrial and agricultural production and civil administration. The negatives: communes over-managed, bureaucracies bloated, systems became rigid, distribution was too egalitarian, and members' production enthusiasm was low.

The positives: those twenty-seven years under communes were China's most strictly controlled rural society period—"government doesn't reach villages, clans and strongmen control the countryside" was basically eliminated. In that era of economic stagnation, backward productivity, and low literacy—the communes concentrated forces for major tasks and stabilized social order. Rural primary healthcare, universal education, water conservancy, and mechanization all developed significantly. The commune system's power concentration and strong resource allocation capabilities were extremely attractive to the transmigrators.

Some Committee members worried about agricultural efficiency under this system: during the commune era, per-worker agricultural productivity had actually declined continuously. Would transmigrators adopting this system cause similar problems?

"Personally, I don't think it matters. This commune's intention isn't agricultural production—it's civil administration." Ma Qianzhu explained. "It can effectively integrate administration, civil affairs, security, education, and military—forming a social organization completely dependent on us."

This new grassroots regime was administratively under the Committee's Internal Affairs Commission, and operationally under the various professional departments.

The commune used household registration. Households were the basic units—even single men had to establish separate households. All registered persons, regardless of age or gender, were called "commune members." Members achieving worker status enjoyed corresponding benefits per regulations.

Each household received one private plot. Plots could not be sold—only inherited. What to grow was entirely the household head's choice. Plots were not allocated per capita—only per household. Larger households received proportionally larger areas. A standard household (4 persons) equaled coefficient 1. Each additional person increased the coefficient by 0.1—capped at 1.5. The purpose: encourage family division and prevent multi-generational large families.

The Committee anticipated possible "fake divisions" to acquire more land. Regulations specified: family divisions with private plots were only permitted for married couples. Single men or women could establish household registrations—but could not receive plots until married.

Members' housing was uniformly constructed by transmigrators, then sold to members under welfare policies—but each household only enjoyed this once. Without Internal Affairs Commission permission—members could not self-build within transmigrator-controlled territory. Housing could be freely sold, gifted, or inherited—but only after full payment.

Members received no land beyond private plots. Basic income had three sources: first, private plot produce; second, work points from commune-dispatched labor; third, side income.

Male members aged 18–55 and female members aged 18–45 were classified as "full labor." Males aged 13–17 and 56–65; females aged 13–17 and 46–55 were "half labor." In principle, every half labor and full labor—unless recruited, enlisted, or attending school—must participate in commune-dispatched work, completing minimum attendance days. Beyond this minimum, extra dispatched work counted as overtime—the Committee's Labor Department paid 1.2× work points.

Transmigrator-established enterprises would preferentially recruit from commune members. After becoming enterprise workers, members retained their member status—administratively under commune management. But labor management and wages were the enterprise's responsibility.

Commune administration used three-tier management: Commune–Village–Member Group. Member Groups were the most basic unit—every eight to ten households formed a group.

At Bairren Fortress's busy South Gate construction site, a nondescript wooden sign hung at the first-completed small courtyard: "Bairren Beach Commune." Wu De served as Commune Director.

Lin Xing was appointed Deputy Director—but did not immediately assume duties. Instead, he and others were sent to Salt Field Village to attend Du Wen's first Peasant Training Institute cadre-training session. Before departure, Wu De gathered them at the worksites—pointing at a nearly complete tall building:

"You'll live there eventually."

Everyone was dumbstruck. After a moment, Lin Xing asked tremblingly: "Chief Wu—is this real?"

"Of course. We always keep our word."

"How much to live—"

"Sixty taels silver. You workers get 10% off—fifty-four taels."

Hearing that payments could be spread over ten to twenty years—smiles became more apparent. Live first, pay later—such fortune was rare indeed.

Soon, news spread through the production teams. Ma Peng was among those visiting the worksites daily. Now he worked at the brick factory—digging and sifting earth. He and his coworkers no longer had short-hair guards' bayonets beside them—yet labor enthusiasm had reached unprecedented heights. They were adding bricks for their own homes. A completely different new life was about to unfold.
