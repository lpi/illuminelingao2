# Chapter 139: New System (Part 2)

Transmigrators decided to implement a completely different civil administration model in their fully controlled Bairren Production Teams One and Two—namely, China's 1960s–70s People's Commune system.

The People's Commune system existed from 1958 to 1985—27 years total. Its most memorable impression: "big and public." However, actually functioning people's communes followed the 1962 *Revised Draft of Rural People's Commune Work Regulations*—adopting three-tier ownership with production teams as the base, while maintaining the commune's "political-economic integration" structure.

Under this system, people's communes were simultaneously rural political units and production management entities. Commune secretaries managed not just party affairs—but also industrial and agricultural production and civil administration. Negatives: communes over-managed, bureaucracies bloated, systems rigid, distribution too egalitarian, members' production enthusiasm low.

Positives: those 27 years under communes were China's most strictly controlled rural society period—"government doesn't reach villages, clans and strongmen control the countryside" was basically eliminated. In that era of economic stagnation, backward productivity, and low literacy—communes concentrated forces for major tasks, stabilized social order. Rural primary healthcare, universal education, water conservancy, and mechanization all developed significantly. The commune system's power concentration and strong resource allocation capabilities were extremely attractive to transmigrators.

Some Committee members worried about agricultural efficiency under this system: during communes, per-worker agricultural productivity actually declined continuously. Would transmigrators adopting this system cause similar problems?

"Personally, I don't think it matters. This commune's intention isn't agricultural production—it's civil administration." Ma Qianzhu explained. "It can effectively integrate administration, civil affairs, security, education, and military—forming a social organization completely dependent on us."

This new grassroots regime was administratively under Committee's Internal Affairs Commission, operationally under various professional departments.

Communes used household registration. Households were basic units—even single men had to establish separate households. All registered persons, regardless of age or gender, were called "commune members." Members achieving worker status enjoyed corresponding benefits per regulations.

Each household received one private plot. Plots couldn't be sold—only inherited. What to grow—entirely household head's choice. Plots weren't allocated per capita—only per household. Larger households got proportionally larger areas. A standard household (4 persons) = coefficient 1. Each additional person increased coefficient by 0.1—capped at 1.5. Purpose: encourage family division, prevent multi-generational large families. Once divided, family cohesion weakened—effectively preventing some families with many men from bullying others.

Committee anticipated possible "fake divisions" for more land—like this timespace's "fake divorces" for demolition compensation. Regulations specified: family divisions with private plots only for married couples. Single men or women could establish household registrations—but couldn't receive plots until married.

Members' housing was uniformly constructed by transmigrators, then sold to members under welfare policies—but each household only enjoyed this once. Without Internal Affairs Commission permission—members couldn't self-build within transmigrator-controlled territory. Housing could be freely sold, gifted, inherited—but only after full payment.

Members received no land beyond private plots. Basic income had three sources: first, private plot produce; second, work points from commune-dispatched labor; third, side income.

Male members 18–55 and female members 18–45: "full labor." Male 13–17 and 56–65; female 13–17 and 46–55: "half labor." In principle, every half labor and full labor—unless recruited, enlisted, or schooled—must participate in commune-dispatched work, completing minimum attendance days. Beyond this minimum, extra dispatched work counted as overtime—Committee's Labor Department paid 1.2× work points.

Those outside these age ranges were "auxiliary labor." Willing workers who completed tasks could also earn work points—but attendance wasn't mandated.

Transmigrator-established industrial and commercial enterprises preferentially recruited from commune members. After becoming enterprise workers, members retained member status—administratively, residentially, and judicially under commune management. But labor management and wages were enterprise responsibility—commune didn't interfere.

Commune administration used three-tier management: Commune–Village–Member Group. Member Groups were the most basic unit—every eight to ten households formed a group, with chief and deputy responsible for transmitting directives, supervision, and member management.

Villages were primary-level political units with Village Committee, Production Group, Militia Group, Women's Group. Unlike indirectly controlled villages like Salt Field—Bairren Commune's villages had all administrative organizations under commune leadership.

Commune level had: commune headquarters, finance office, production office, propaganda office, education office, judicial station, militia squad, women's federation, health station, agricultural tech station, broadcasting station, elementary school, nursery—a full range of administrative and educational and healthcare departments. However, lacking sufficient professionals—currently just a plan, to be gradually perfected.

Every half labor and above member paid 5% income tax annually—regardless of source (work points or enterprise wages). Private plot income was tax-exempt. Under-15 members' income was tax-free. Taxes split 4:6 between transmigrators and commune—commune used its share for administration and salaried personnel.

At Bairren Fortress's busy South Gate construction site, a nondescript white-with-black-letters wooden sign hung at the first-completed small courtyard: "Bairren Beach Commune." Wu De served as Commune Director—frankly, even the production team's most organization-leaning workers probably couldn't understand the *Commune Organization Management Regulations'* obscure jargon. Even Wu De himself frequently phoned Committee asking about details.

Lin Xing was appointed Deputy Director—but didn't immediately assume duties. Instead, he and others were sent to Salt Field Village to attend Du Wen's first Peasant Training Institute cadre-training session. Lin Xing and others understood: they were being groomed for "officialdom"—chiefs called it "promotion to cadre." This felt both sudden and anxious. Before departure, Wu De gathered them at worksites—pointing at a nearly complete tall building:

"You'll live there eventually."

These "future cadres" had seen countless transmigrator-created miracles. They'd personally led workers building these houses. But in their wildest fantasies, such tall buildings had nothing to do with themselves. Everyone was dumbstruck. After moments, Lin Xing tremblingly asked:

"Chief Wu—is this real?"

"Of course. We always keep our word."

"How much to live—" Lin Xing naturally didn't expect short-hairs to give houses away.

"Sixty *liang* silver. You workers get 10% off—fifty-four *liang*."

This price didn't shock much—by late-Ming prices and wages, this was average housing cost.

Hearing payments could be spread over ten to twenty years—smiles became more apparent: live first, pay later—such fortune was rare indeed.

Soon, news spread through production teams. Every day after work, people visited worksites—seeing these future homes. Ma Peng was among them. After returning, as a laborer with family, he received a separate shed. His brought possessions—anything cloth-related—were all confiscated; but as compensation, he got new clothes, mats, blankets. One displeasure: his elderly mother also experienced the "Purification" he'd tasted. Seeing his head-wrapped, newly clothed mother—Ma Peng's feelings were complicated. These short-hairs really didn't respect elders.

However, returning after harvest work—quitting Fu Buer's job—besides short-hairs' better food, the main reason was discovering he couldn't tolerate fleas and bedbugs anymore, couldn't bear dark decrepit sheds, murky water... Though short-hairs' life wasn't luxury—these most ordinary everyday things in short-hair daily life were unattainable in his previous existence.

Now Ma Peng worked at the brick factory. Daily: digging and sifting earth. Rumbling machinery no longer amazed him. He and his coworkers no longer had short-hair guards' bayonets beside them—yet labor enthusiasm reached unprecedented heights. They were adding bricks for their own homes. A completely different new life was about to unfold.
