# Chapter 51: The Latrine

*"From the moment you pulled out that chainsaw, I knew China's environment had no future!"* At the Third National Environmental Protection Conference, Dai Xie's speech triggered a denunciation campaign against Minister of Forestry Wu Kuangming. Comrade Wu, who had fought on the forestry front for over twenty years, was forced to make a profound self-criticism at the conference before quietly resigning to become president of Forestry University. But rewind thirty years to that day, and he was lauded by the Executive Committee as "one man doing a whole team's quota"—a labor hero. Of course, his high output was mainly because the other loggers were so pathetic; the chainsaw's credit was secondary.

There was more than one chainsaw, but no one dared touch these limb-severing things without training. Wu Kuangming crash-trained two people and demonstrated axe techniques: circle the trunk swinging the axe repeatedly, cut deepening toward the heartwood. When the tree started swaying, stand to the uphill side, brace the axe against the trunk, and shout. Down it goes. Looked easy, but it required arm strength and skill—not so simple. He chopped away while casually coaching those around him.

The logging crews cut along the timber line, axes thudding, saws rasping rhythmically. Occasionally someone shouted and a tree crashed down. Felling was grueling for these former modern people. Most were amateurs—arms swinging hard but producing shallow cuts; saws constantly pinched or bound, exhausting work. Half a day and they couldn't drop a single tree, but they'd worn out plenty of saws and axes. The Planning Committee supply clerks' faces went sour.

Wu Kuangming worked alongside everyone with his chainsaw. He wasn't truly professional either—the chainsaw was heavy, needed great force to stabilize when running. Each felled tree left him drenched in sweat.

Uneasily, he checked on various spots. Under a big sea-lotus, Shao Zong and Hu Yicheng were working a two-man saw, pushing and pulling laboriously. Even in the mild sun, both were panting like oxen. He reminded them: "Careful—don't snap the blade. The Planning Committee people's faces are already long."

Hu Yicheng sighed: "Despair! The Committee has no eyes! I'm supposedly high-precision talent, and they have me pulling a saw! If my classmates knew this is how I'm using my biology degree, they'd laugh their teeth out."

Wu Kuangming said: "Experts use finesse; amateurs just use muscle. Learn as you go. But everyone turns down the chainsaw!"

"No thanks—I'd like my arms and legs to stay attached. Can't handle that thing."

"With my build, trying to be a Leatherface would probably mean taking off my own body parts first." Shao Zong pulled the saw with a pained expression. "I thought joining Communications would be easy—personally build China Telecom. Instead, I'm prepping telephone poles."

Wu Kuangming was about to say something encouraging when someone screamed: "Yikes! Snake!" Before anyone could react, three or four people came scrambling and tumbling out of the woods in terror, axes and saws scattered on the ground.

He hurried to intercept them. Still shaken, they could barely speak coherently. Wu Kuangming thoroughly despised these city homebodies—for loggers, encountering snakes was normal. He'd heard from a friend who'd been a forestry worker: sleeping at night in the forest, you had to shake out your bedding. When autumn turned cold, snakes crept into workers' shacks for warmth; you had to smoke them out before sleeping.

Mangrove marshes like this were obviously reptile territory—which was why he'd issued tall rubber boots to all loggers. Not for waterproofing.

Liu Zheng perked up, grabbed a forked stick from the pile of trimmed branches, and told Wu Kuangming: "Boss, I'll go check. Catch it, and we'll have extra dinner tonight."

Wu Kuangming said: "Didn't the Committee say no eating wildlife?"

"Who cares. This kind of pure natural wild stuff—how can you not eat it?" Wildlife exploration was Liu Zheng's profession; skinning an unlucky snake for dinner was routine. He guessed they'd encountered common Guangdong species—water snakes, pit vipers—or possibly venomous ones like bamboo pit vipers or krait. Having caught plenty and being well-equipped—his pack held several bottles of Jidesheng snake-bite medicine—he enthusiastically followed the escape route in. After circling around, he found nothing. Worried he'd gone too deep and get lost, Wu Kuangming called him back.

While calming the frightened transmigrators and conducting safety education, they heard branches cracking, then a scream. Rushing over, a man had been struck by a falling tree. The young guy lay bleeding from his face, moaning in pain while bystanders stood helpless. Fortunately, Health Group personnel were patrolling the beach. One walkie-talkie call and a yellow farm truck with a red cross arrived. A quick assessment—no major damage, just a laceration—bandaging, then loaded onto the truck and sent off.

This made Wu Kuangming uneasy. He wasn't really familiar with logging either. It was his first time leading so many people in dangerous work. Since landing, his was the first site with a casualty—not a proud record. He lost interest in working, carried his chainsaw around checking, reminding everyone about safety. When he saw someone really struggling, he just solved it with the chainsaw.

Felled timber was dragged to the beach for trimming; branches and leaves were piled for later use. Freshly cut wood had too much moisture for processing—immediate use would quickly cause shrinkage, warping, even rot and pests. Normally it needed drying time or kiln treatment. The transmigrators had no drying equipment. Fortunately, they weren't building anything permanent—a few towers and latrines were temporary; wet wood would do.

Dai Xie took a deep breath. The slightly salty fresh sea breeze penetrated to his core. The seawater here wasn't so different from his own era—perhaps because it was the ocean, cradle of life, with self-cleaning power far exceeding rivers that couldn't tolerate industrial pollution.

Perhaps fate really did intervene—otherwise how to explain an ordinary office worker joining such a heaven-defying plan? He'd left without even a proper farewell letter, choosing silent departure to spare his family worry. But to so lightly sever twenty-some years of family bonds—on reflection, it seemed heartless. Yet it was done; no turning back now. Watching that thin mirror-surface transform into white light and vanish, Dai Xie understood: from now on, everything from the old world was abandoned. All that remained for him and his comrades was one resolve—"Build a New World."

Due to his physique and nearsightedness, and his previous career, Dai Xie had always done statistics and calculations. Knowing some strategic planning, he'd been assigned to the Planning Committee: managing each group's materials and tools, distributing to groups, checking and recording resource use and consumption. Since all modern tools and supplies were one-use-only after crossing, managing precious resources was the Committee's main job. They also handled intake and redistribution of locally gathered and manufactured materials and products—quite busy work.

Now his task was using a handheld PDA to track logging quantities and timber destinations. Watching Wu Kuangming grin wickedly wielding the chainsaw, trees large and small crashing into muddy water, startled waterbirds squawking and fleeing... *Done for—with this killing weapon in hand, China's environment has no future.* He painfully closed his eyes.

"Timber!" Wu Kuangming's trademark shriek jolted Dai Xie from environmental brooding. He immediately executed a ground roll, moving several feet, barely dodging the tree thundering down—nearly becoming the first casualty.

"What the hell! You did that on purpose!" Dai Xie roared at Wu Kuangming, covered in muddy water.

"Bro, I don't have a sister..." Wu Kuangming looked innocently at Xiao Dai. Their first grudge was thus established.

Zhuo Tianmin stubbornly waited by the logging site until he finally got first claim on lumber. Then the Building Group found a solid foundation near the beach and began digging. Tian Jiujiu's specialty was drainage engineering, so building latrines for the transmigrators became his first assignment. Latrines were crucial for camp sanitation—more important even than the cafeteria.

For a professional water-supply-and-drainage engineer, building a simple latrine wasn't complicated. Tian Jiujiu had all kinds of plans at his disposal. But they didn't have bricks, cement, or even mud bricks. Only a small amount of lumber was available.

His original latrine design was extremely simple: build a platform over a tidal channel at the beach's edge, lay planks on top with gaps, screen the sides with branches and leaves. Waste would drop directly into the sea—simple and convenient. Certain environmentalists and the Agriculture Group strenuously objected. The environmentalists cited pollution; Agriculture still hoped to use this material as fertilizer—Tian Jiujiu now understood Wu Nanhai's stinginess. When Wu talked about this stuff, his fanatical expression suggested gold and silver.

Obviously, the Committee had been swayed by Wu's impassioned speech. The latrine plan was revised to pit-style. A simple pit latrine would work fine—planks over a hole, similar to his over-water design. But such pit latrines typically didn't consider waste recovery; when nearly full, you just sprinkled lime and buried it. For waste recovery, pit latrines required manual emptying.

"Since Agriculture loves this stuff so much, let them do the emptying," Tian Jiujiu grumbled—pit latrines' biggest problem was the earthwork volume.

For nearly six hundred users, calculating one stall per fifty to sixty people: the men's side got ten stalls plus one urinal trough; the women's side got two stalls. Pits were long and narrow with sloped bottoms so waste would flow to collection pits. Collection pits were outside the latrine under wooden covers for easy emptying access. Normally, pit bottoms and walls should be cement-plastered or at least brick-lined—otherwise waste could seep into groundwater. But they had no such materials; they could only compact with tamping machines. Fortunately, the local groundwater was salty and unusable anyway—some contamination wouldn't matter.

After deploying an excavator and several "basic labor" teams, the pits were finally dug. No bricks—they used tree trunks for pit edges, packed with dirt. No stall planks—they bound trimmed branches with vines into rafts as substitutes. Side frames went up; no bricks for walls—old method: vertically bury spaced poles, then repeatedly wrap vines between them, insert many small branches, finally pile sticky mud mixed with leaves and grass onto this wattle framework and smooth both sides with trowels. Apart from bumpy surfaces, it looked decent enough. Tian Jiujiu knew all these undried materials would cause problems after a few days in the sun.
