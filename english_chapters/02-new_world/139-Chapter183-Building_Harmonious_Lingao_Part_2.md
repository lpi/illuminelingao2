# Chapter 183: Building a Harmonious Lingao (Part 2)

Wu Mingjin chose to receive them in the main hall for two reasons: first, the hall was for trials, signifying that the baldies were not guests but criminals; second, to demonstrate that his dealings with the baldies could withstand any scrutiny.

Seeing that the baldy envoy was only in his early twenties, fair-skinned, slightly plump, and with a calm demeanor, he could not help but sigh inwardly. Clearly, this was a son from a good family. Even without passing the examinations, he could have been a prosperous commoner. Why join the bandits?

Xiong Buyu was seeing the county magistrate for the first time and studied him curiously. Aside from noting that he was a middle-aged scholar, there was nothing special about him. Looking around at the runners—all gaunt and wretched in appearance, their clothing old beyond recognition. The yamen was pathetically shabby: the paint on the pillars and beams was peeling, cobwebs hung everywhere, mold grew on the walls, plaster was falling in patches, and the floor tiles were cracked and broken.

Xiong Buyu momentarily felt some goodwill toward this Ming county government—compared to the "White House" back at camp, this yamen was the epitome of austerity. Actually, he did not know that this dilapidated state was due to the official superstition that "yamens should never be repaired"—as long as it had not collapsed, magistrates would never spend money on repairs.

Wu Mingjin saw this man enter the hall without the trembling fear common people usually showed. He was somewhat disappointed. Seeing his arrogant lack of deference—not even bowing, let alone kneeling—Wu Mingjin's anger rose. Just as he was about to thunder "How dare you not kneel before this official" to dampen his spirit, he glanced at his runners. Those who usually puffed out their chests and shouted with menacing voices were all humble-faced now, not daring to look at the two baldies. Seeing the dozen gray-clad, armed baldies outside, his rising anger immediately dissipated by half. A servant brought tea and slipped him a note. Written by Secretary Wang, it contained just one ink character: "Endure."

Xiong Buyu did not waste words, handing over the letter drafted by Yu Eshui. Opening it, Wu Mingjin found the prose crude—a mix of vernacular and classical—and the calligraphy mediocre, clearly the work of an unlettered person. But the meaning was clear. First, it stated that Liu Xiang's bandit fleet and Westerners had attacked Bopu yesterday but were defeated. Three enemy ships had been sunk, and over 500 pirates killed, causing the rest to flee in panic.

So last night was a pirate attack—criminals fighting criminals. Wu Mingjin had always dreaded frequent pirate incursions. Now that they had retreated, he felt some relief. At least the people had not been ravaged by them.

The second part said that Australian merchants were descendants of Chinese who had emigrated to escape the chaos of the late Song Dynasty. Now returning to China, they would never harm their compatriots. Their maxim was "strike the strong, aid the weak, protect territory and people"—seeking only local peace with absolutely no intention of rebellion.

*Hmph, talk is cheap.* Wu Mingjin skimmed further. The substantive content stated: pirates frequently raided Lingao, bandits were rampant, the people suffered, and county governance was difficult because the Ming Dynasty's imperial grace did not reach everyone. Therefore, the transmigrators would organize the villages of Northern Lingao into a joint-defense militia. They hoped Magistrate Wu would approve and support this.

Finally, the letter promised that once joint defense was established, local pirates and bandits would be completely eliminated. Moreover, the county's summer and autumn grain tax quotas would no longer be a problem.

Truly transparent ambitions! Wu Mingjin looked at the two envoys. Their arrogant expressions showed no sense of hierarchy. Was this not obvious? The baldies were using joint defense to control all the villages' militia forces. Next, decrees would come from the East Gate Market, not the yamen.

Seeing his silence, Xiong Buyu spoke:

"Magistrate Wu has long suffered from pirate incursions. Here is a humble gift." He waved his hand. Workers pushed in wheelbarrows loaded with wooden boxes and straw bags, placing them in the yamen courtyard. Everyone smelled something like dried fish. Wu Mingjin was secretly puzzled. He sent a runner to check. The runner opened a box and immediately recoiled. Everyone could see clearly—there was a salt-preserved human head inside.

Looking at the other boxes and bags, the contents were obvious. A chill ran down Wu Mingjin's back. Barely suppressing his panic, he asked: "How dare you! Where did these heads come from?"

"Reporting to Your Honor: these are the pirates who attacked our Lingao county yesterday. According to their confessions, they are men of Guangdong's great pirate chieftain Liu Xiang. Please verify."

Wu Mingjin saw so many heads and quickly summoned a coroner to examine them. Inspection revealed the heads of red-haired foreigners and South Sea islanders, plus several wanted outlaws. The claim that they were pirates seemed genuine.

Killing so many pirates in one battle was unprecedented in the county's history—no, not just the county. In the past decade, even imperial troops had not achieved this. Wu Mingjin was secretly shocked. The pirates plaguing Fujian and Guangdong, rampaging for over a decade since the last years of the Wanli Emperor, had resisted the combined forces of two provinces and tens of thousands of troops. The court could only hold its nose and grant amnesty to the great pirate Zheng Zhilong to stabilize the coast...

"How do we know you didn't kill innocents for false credit!" Wu Mingjin suddenly barked.

"What did you say?!" Wang Ruixiang spoke in official Mandarin, which he mostly understood. Hearing this, anger surged: only regular troops did such dastardly things. Truly judging a gentleman by petty standards.

Xiong Buyu said: "Your Honor errs. We hold no office and seek no official reward. Why would we fake achievements? These heads merely express our sincerity. We seek no court rewards. That our county could eliminate this fierce bandit gang is thanks to Your Honor's excellent moral instruction..."

This last bit was flattery. But he was not wrong. The baldies did not need heads for career advancement—there was no need to kill innocents for credit.

So many pirate heads—if reported to the prefecture, this would be a major merit! Wu Mingjin's previously gloomy mood suddenly brightened. Official ambition warmed him. Involuntarily, his expression softened. He said gently:

"You are all extraordinary talents. Why not serve the court instead of becoming outlaws?"

Xiong Buyu silently laughed. *If not for your decent reputation, the Director would have stormed the city to put you through a "struggle session" by now. Our gradual peaceful evolution is already quite courteous.*

After the transmigrator group had established themselves along the Bairen-Bopu line, the Executive Committee's next policy was encircling the cities from the countryside. Through village joint defense, villages would be initially incorporated into the transmigrator administrative system, hollowing out the Lingao county seat's governing role. The transmigrators would draw in and divide local farmers through agricultural technology cooperation, ultimately controlling the villages.

But implementing this strategy required making people believe Bairen Fortress was not a rebel gang. The yamen's attitude was crucial—especially Wu Mingjin's. If he insisted transmigrators were rebels and pirates, people would have many reservations about interacting with them.

"Here also are captured pirate banners, documents, tokens, and weapons. All submitted to the county." Xiong Buyu was very polite. This "generous gift" should move Wu Mingjin. In an era when fires raged everywhere, imperial troops repeatedly lost, General Yu had been court-martialed, and the Ming could only stabilize the coast by granting amnesty to the great pirate Zheng Zhilong—Lingao county defeating Liu Xiang's forces and killing 400 Chinese and foreign pirates would be a major bright spot.

Xiong Buyu saw his continued silence and made to leave. Wu Mingjin nodded slightly. "Court dismissed!"

Wang Ruixiang followed Xiong Buyu out of the yamen. The laborers at the wheelbarrows all looked pleased—the county had sent reward money plus twenty jars of wine and two whole roast pigs. Apparently for refreshments.

Back at Bairen Fortress, they reported everything to Wen Desi. Wang Ruixiang could not help asking: "That's it?"

"Watch. Within a few days, he'll almost certainly contact us," Wen Desi said. "Too many eyes and ears in the main hall. He couldn't say certain things."

"These damn officials and their twists and turns." Wang Ruixiang sighed.

"If he were as stubbornly righteous as Hai Rui, we'd have to use violent methods," Wen Desi said. "Fortunately, he's not. Much easier to handle. Just wait."

Sure enough, the next evening at dusk, a furtive figure appeared at the Wenshui Bridge checkpoint. He told the sentry he wanted to meet "the baldies' big official." Checkpoint chief Luo Duo did not dare delay, immediately calling the Executive Committee.

The visitor was brought to the quiet Security Team building. After questioning, they learned he was Zhang Youfu's servant, requesting that the baldies' big official attend a banquet.

Wen Desi remembered—Zhang Youfu was the envoy the county had sent to negotiate after their failed encirclement months ago. His sudden meeting request was obviously on someone's behalf. He immediately agreed. The servant said Zhang Youfu's manor was just outside the West Gate. Wen Desi decided to go personally. Zhang Youfu spoke several dialects including Cantonese—so there would be no communication difficulties.

After dark, two sedan chairs arrived at the manor. Wen Desi and Xi Yazhou went together. For safety, Bei Wei selected eight men from the Recon Team for escort. Besides personal weapons, Wen Desi was given a signal flare—if anything happened, he could fire it, and Bei Wei would bring rescue.

Wen Desi and Xi Yazhou, carried by Zhang Youfu's tenant farmers, swayed through the pitch-dark fields. The leading lantern was dim as a will-o'-the-wisp. Without the eight recon men, they would have felt quite nervous.

The sedan chairs were old, stuffy, and poorly handled by inexperienced farmers. After half an hour of bouncing, they stopped. Emerging, they saw an ordinary farmhouse courtyard.

Someone was already waiting at the gate. Seeing them arrive, they quickly ushered them in, immediately closing the gate.

The courtyard was equally dark. Though lanterns hung under the veranda, everything was shadowy—wheelbarrows, hay stacks, and millstones were only vaguely visible.

Zhang Youfu, though called a landlord, was actually impoverished. His "manor" was just one large courtyard. He lived in five main rooms; farmhands and servants were in wing rooms; and animal sheds were along the walls. But the walls were high, clearly brick-and-stone, with an iron-plated thick wooden gate. All for defense against bandits.
