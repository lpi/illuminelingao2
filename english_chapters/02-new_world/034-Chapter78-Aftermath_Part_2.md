# Chapter 78: Aftermath (Part 2)

"They won't kill us, surely."

"Ah, my mother must be worried sick." Ma Peng started wiping tears.

Fu Bu'er felt uncomfortable. *You have an old mother—I have an entire household, top to bottom!* His wife was one thing, but he could not bear to lose his concubines, especially his third concubine, brought from Guangzhou. Though a bit older, she came from a courtesan-house background—she knew how to dress elegantly and could sing ditties. Far superior to local country girls. She had utterly captivated Master Fu.

Then he thought about his young sons and his unmarried daughter, none of whom could hold up the household. If he could not get back, his accumulated property would be swallowed by clansmen, uncles, and brothers. Their covetous eyes had been fixed on him for more than a day or two. The more he thought, the more he regretted. Seeing that the guards were not watching closely—only two young pirates—he fumbled on himself and found some loose silver, about two taels total. Fearing it was not enough, he also removed his gilded silver net-scarf ring, worth another two or three *qian*. He examined it a while, thinking that over two taels of silver for one person's escape ought to be sufficient—these small fry probably did not have big appetites.

Fu Bu'er mustered his courage and sidled, trembling, toward the young pirate with the bird-gun. He offered the silver. He knew some Cantonese, but the youth obviously did not understand. He could only point to himself, then to the outside, miming running.

But the youth showed no interest, merely gesturing with his bayoneted rifle. Terrified, Fu Bu'er fell silent, but did not dare withdraw his silver-holding hand—*might as well give it up; after they search us it won't be mine anyway; might as well trade for some consideration.* But the youth refused the money—only indicated he should keep it, then pointed at his injured leg, then at the big tent. Fu Bu'er understood: wait here for treatment.

The medical team worked until evening before finishing all the wounded. Fu Bu'er's leg received over ten stitches. To the doctor, this man was lucky: the bullet had passed through muscle, not lodging in his body, not breaking bone or blood vessel. But to Fu Bu'er, it was a completely novel experience—the first time he learned that flesh could be sewn up like a tailor stitching clothes, though he screamed himself hoarse during the suturing.

Two-thirds of the thirty-odd severely wounded died while waiting. After examining the rest, the doctors felt their chances were not good: no blood plasma, not enough qualified nurses—these people would likely not survive surgery.

"Let the Military Group give them quick ends." Hippo knew that with resources extremely precious, they could not expend limited medical supplies on these people.

Shi Niaoren pondered a moment, then said, "Forget it—let's try desperate measures. They've lasted from noon until now—strong life force. We'll try."

"But there's no blood plasma—we'd need donors, blood typing..."

"Just use saline." Shi Niaoren decided. "No anesthetics either. Whether they survive depends on their luck."

"But... but..." The medical team was stunned. No anesthetics, no blood plasma—operating on these severely injured, blood-loss cases, some already unconscious—was that not basically killing them?

"Didn't I say desperate measures? Whether they live is fate." Shi Niaoren had an unspoken thought: *Rather than watching them die, better they die on the operating table—at least that soothes my conscience.* Another completely unspeakable thought: *good surgical practice for everyone.*

"Let's go." At his call, the exhausted medical team got busy again. But medical personnel were insufficient, especially nurses. Doctors had to assist doctors. Finally, even veterinarian Dr. Yang was summoned—he had just finished examining the three captured horses' injuries and treating their diseases.

"Old Yang, can you operate on humans?"

"I can operate on horses..." Yang Baogui joked. "Wound cleaning, disinfection, suturing—give those to me, it's all similar. Oh, amputations I can also do."

"Let's go."

The evening's post-battle review meeting, based on problems exposed during combat, identified five main issues:

**One: Insufficient military training, poor fighting spirit.** Most people were not familiar with firearms, leading to too much wasted shooting. At the slightest danger, they could not hold their positions; even with defensive fortifications, routs had occurred. In the open, who knew what would happen?

**Two: Extremely poor organization.** Besides Military Group members who could follow their leaders' orders and fight, the Military Group was essentially unable to command hastily organized civilians. "Rabble," He Ming declared at the review.

**Three: Protection.** Steel helmets combined with stab-proof vests had proved effective. But the battle had exposed coverage gaps—limbs and face lacked protection. Further protective products needed development.

**Four: Strategy too passive.** They had confined themselves to Bairren Rapids, failing to use their superiority in firepower, communications, and mobility to take the initiative—resulting in passive defense.

**Five: Bairren Fortress's defenses were obviously insufficient—they needed strengthening.**

But the meeting's true focus was the next strategic direction.

The **Steady Faction** insisted on keeping the two-point-one-line as the main activity center while strengthening base defense. After creating facts on the ground, they would focus on industrial and technological development, forming a complete urban and agricultural-industrial system. Using material abundance, superior living conditions, and advanced technology, they could create a "beacon effect"—attracting locals into trade and construction, ultimately achieving "peaceful evolution."

The **Aggressive Faction** mocked the Steady Faction as true "turtle tactics." With strength surpassing their opponents by three centuries, they were still fearing the enemy like tigers, cowering behind trenches and barbed wire, not daring to seize the initiative. They reminded everyone: without proactive attacks to destroy the local Ming ruling center, Lingao's resources could never be used. And this ruling center would organize hostile activities again and again.

"Lingao County launched this two-pronged attack today; tomorrow they might send raiders—they've done it before. We'll certainly venture farther from base in the future to collect various materials. Every time with Military Group escorts?"

The Aggressive Faction listed the advantages of occupying the county seat: first, capturing large numbers of people as labor; second, through seized tax registers, levying taxes and grain; also obtaining substantial treasury supplies...

These benefits swayed many. Though the Steady Faction cited historical records and reality as weapons—pointing out that there were not many residents to capture for labor, that Ming-era Lingao County annals showed the prefecture had always been poor, and that the treasury would not have much.

At this point, the Aggressive Faction representative Ma Qianzhu unexpectedly proposed tabling this issue in favor of focusing on the training and organization problems exposed in battle.

Training was indeed a blank: after landing, ten-plus days of daily labor had left no time. Live-fire practice had happened only once; five rounds per person had made the Planning Committee wince—five hundred people meant 2,500 rounds. The transmigrators' biggest loss in this battle was ammunition: in under an hour of fighting, nearly 3,000 rounds had been consumed—a significant number. Their total stockpile was only one million rounds. If training and small battles used this much, how would they fight future battles? When could they produce metallic cartridges?

Organization problems were obviously related directly to insufficient military training. Xiao Zishan proposed that professional groups had performed well in battle—obviously because they worked together daily and knew each other. Problems mainly came from daily ad-hoc "basic labor groups." These groups were originally meant to be fixed; in practice, they were redistributed daily by personnel management—resulting in unfamiliarity and lack of trust among members. Fine for regular work; in emergencies, they could not unite.

After discussion, the Committee reaffirmed the group system: all transmigrators except family units—singles to freely combine—forming fixed four-person groups, each electing a group leader, participating in labor together, housed together in the same dormitory. Through eating, living, and working together, they would build friendship—like university dormmates who formed tight bonds.

Each group would be issued one SKS rifle as group equipment. This way, everyone could practice; it avoided issuing weapons only during wartime when unfamiliarity was dangerous, yet prevented one rifle per person, which would mean uncontrolled firearms.

Using these groups as basic units, weekly time would be allocated for military training to improve coordination. Next, Beiwei introduced a new training plan: **"Hunting."**

"Each time, Military Group sends five people, plus two to three regular groups." He explained the plan in detail. "Breaking our current pattern of only operating along the Wenlan River, we'll push reconnaissance into various directions' depths, correcting maps, surveying resources—"

Groups would capture individuals or small groups of natives, and when necessary, attack local armed personnel. Through combat, they would temper the team—fighting while marching was closer to real combat than marching drills and target practice at base. They would spread transmigrator authority to every county corner, letting commoners know of their arrival, spreading necessary terror.

This plan obviously reeked of blood. But the Moderate faction decided not to oppose it—after all, twenty-one wounded was reality. If they vetoed this, the Aggressive faction would inevitably reintroduce the proposal to attack the county seat. Given current emotions, moderates did not think they would win that vote. Finally, the Steady faction agreed to the "Hunting" plan as a compromise for the Aggressive faction dropping the county-seat attack proposal.
