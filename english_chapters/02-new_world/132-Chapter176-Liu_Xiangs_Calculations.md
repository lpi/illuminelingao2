# Chapter 176: Liu Xiang's Calculations

"More waiting?" The person standing nearby spoke—a woman's voice.

Aragonés glanced disapprovingly at the woman beside him. She was wrapped entirely in a black cloak, looking almost monk-like, with only her curly hair visible beneath the hood.

"Li, I believe I am this ship's captain. You're merely the liaison sent by Chief Liu."

"True. But in another hour, the tide will turn. Then you can neither enter the harbor on the flood nor exit on the ebb."

Aragonés knew the woman was right. For clumsy vessels like Spanish galleons, turning and maneuvering in tight spaces were difficult. Though rowboats could tow them, riding the tides in and out of the bay was still best.

He simply disliked a woman second-guessing his commands. Even if she was beautiful and spoke fluent Spanish.

"Begin," Aragonés ordered. After finishing here, he would continue north to deal with that Zheng Yiguan.

Fifty sailors already waiting on deck climbed over the railings into two rowboats. Most were Southeast Asian natives from the Malay Peninsula, many formerly dugout-canoe pirates who spent their lives raiding merchant ships. This was their specialty. The few Spaniards were gunners. Each rowboat mounted one 2-pounder light cannon—Chief Liu seemed terrified of enemy firearms, demanding Spanish cannons and heavy muskets for support.

Behind them on Liu Xiang's ships, pirates transferred to sampans. These small boats reportedly carried Chief Liu's best fighters. Aragonés was not interested in being effective—he was merely helping Liu seize a few fast ships and capture some prisoners. Chief Liu feared the enemy's firearms.

"Monkeys, serve the Catholic King well." Aragonés made no effort to hide his contempt for these dark-skinned, beady-eyed native sailors. If not for the extreme difficulty of recruiting Europeans in Southeast Asia, how could such lowly heathens be aboard his ship? Their crooked yellow eyes always flickered with both cruelty and cowardice. Aragonés knew he was like a circus ringmaster, requiring constant whips and sugar, or he would be devoured.

Spanish galleons entering a river port like Bopu required riding tides and rowboat towing. Exposed rowers were easily hit by shore cannon and musket fire—a very dangerous proposition. If Aragonés faced a well-defended European port, he would not dare attempt it. But native sailors were cannon fodder—losing some did not matter. Besides, this was China. Aragonés firmly believed the Chinese knew nothing about naval warfare, much less port defense. Years ago, his predecessors had raided ships in the Pearl River with impunity.

The ship's gunners were at their stations. The broadside gun ports had opened. Black cannon muzzles pointed at several possible shore targets. He had full confidence in his firepower advantage. Those Chinese guns—could they even be called cannons? Just crude copies of century-old designs.

Per the plan, the *Countess of Scarborough* would provide fire support inside the bay for Liu Xiang's landing operation. Liu Xiang would use sampans to ferry five hundred men ashore. The objective: capture at least one of the iron fast-ships moored at the shore. From defectors from Zhu Cailao's camp, Liu Xiang had learned these ships' combat capabilities—clearly attractive to any pirate.

Zhu Cailao's encounter gave Liu Xiang several basic impressions:

First, the iron fast-ships were extremely sturdy—ordinary cannonballs could not penetrate them.

Second, they were agile and fast.

Third, their crews had no cannons. Zhu Cailao's men said the ships mounted something like oversized crossbows which were completely inaccurate. But they had very powerful muskets, with long range and great accuracy.

Based on these impressions, the pirates would mainly rely on the *Countess of Scarborough*'s fire to suppress the enemy. No matter how powerful those muskets were, they could not match cannons. Under the cover of fire, one pirate force would infiltrate through Bopu's mangroves, wreaking havoc to divert the "Australians'" attention. Then another force would seize the opportunity to rush the harbor and capture at least one iron fast-ship. Liu Xiang had instructed his captains: they must capture some "Australians" alive.

For this, the Spanish had sold them eight rowboats and specialized towing equipment. After success, the rowboats would tow the iron ship out of the harbor. The target was at least one ship.

Aragonés had no objection to this plan. He just could not understand this Chinese pirate chief's obsession with these iron ships. To him, iron ships were too bizarre. Ships that moved without sails or oars—either God's miracle or the Devil's creation. In his view, the latter was more likely.

The rowboats began slowly towing the *Countess of Scarborough* toward the bay. The depth-sounding dinghy led the way. Everything was calm.

"I should tell you," Aragonés said to Li Siya beside him, "my ship must leave at low tide, whether or not you've captured any ships."

"One hour is enough." Li Siya smiled faintly. Though she had not personally designed the plan, she had participated in it. Among the pirates, she was the only one who had directly dealt with the Australians. Last year, the Australians' brilliant raid had badly wounded her pride. Even Zheng Yiguan had doubted her afterward. In anger, she had claimed her ship needed repairs and returned to Macau. There, she had sent people to investigate "Australian" news. They had left behind houses, goods, and servants, then vanished like smoke.

Only recently had word come that a group appeared on Qiongzhou's coast—shaved heads, short clothes—and a gigantic iron ship. The shaved-head, short-clothes description immediately reminded her of Wen Desi. That Australian merchant had been shaved-headed and short-clothed.

To investigate, she had set sail again. With Zheng Zhilong busy with amnesty negotiations in Fujian, she had attached herself to Liu Xiang in Guangdong as a guest advisor. Li Siya was an independent operator along the coast. Though she sometimes operated under various major gangs, paying protection fees, she never participated in inter-gang fighting—she was interested only in plunder and adventure. With her superior fast ships and cannons, she lived freely.

"Wen Desi, are you on that shore too?" she murmured, revealing a chilling smile.

"Captain Li?"

"?"

"Why did Chief Liu send four hundred men ashore today?" Aragonés had never understood the daytime landing of four hundred Chinese pirates. To him, this was pure suicide.

"To give the Australians a victory," Li Siya explained. "Though they call themselves Australian, they don't deny being Chinese descendants. Chinese celebrate victories with drinking and merrymaking."

"We Spaniards do the same."

"After drinking and merrymaking, they won't be as alert."

"Just to make them careless, you sent four hundred men to die? God!"

"Spending four hundred *piastres* for such results—you think that's a bad deal?" Li Siya glanced at Aragonés. Compared to the Chinese, Spaniards who only knew how to host roasting parties for heretics were like convent virgins. Even charming Italians knew that those doing great things should not be bound by moral principles—only consider whether results are beneficial, not whether methods cause harm. Even better, these cannon fodder thought they were serving Zhu Cailao. That fool Zhu Cailao would probably die of headaches wondering what happened. The thought gave her immense pleasure.

Aragonés was shocked that a pirate chief would so unhesitatingly treat his countrymen as disposables. And this woman only calculated recruitment costs. Inwardly, he despised her utterly. But heathens' lives and deaths were no concern of his. Saving souls was for priests—and Aragonés was the least willing to deal with priests.

He suddenly remembered this woman was half-Portuguese. "Captain Li, are you still one of Christ's lambs?"

"I attend church as often as you do," Li Siya replied with a mocking smile.

"There's a sampan!" The observer nudged Xue Ziliang.

"Keep watching!" From the moment the ships started turning toward Bopu, Xue Ziliang knew things were bad. The maritime attack was probably about to begin.

"Lots of sampans!" The observer exclaimed. "Too many to count—"

Xue Ziliang snatched the binoculars. The scene was spectacular. At least thirty sampans were advancing toward Bopu over the water, with large ships following behind.

Two hundred fifty meters...

Two hundred meters...

Through the lens, he could see bare-chested pirates with knives in their teeth. Xue Ziliang almost felt he could see their fierce grins.

"Report to Bopu, fast!"

"Re—reporting, Captain," the radio operator suddenly looked terrified, "radio's not working!"

The moon sank. The sea and sky became pitch black again. Xue Ziliang had not heard any alarm from Bopu. Unsure whether the tower watch had spotted this, seeing sampans approaching the harbor, he grabbed an SKS and fired one shot at the nearest sampan.

*Bang!* In the silent night, the gunshot was especially crisp. A tracer round streaked across the night sky like a meteor. In that lightning instant, a figure on the sampan seemed to shudder and collapse.

Half-asleep Li Di heard the shot and snapped awake—he had nearly dozed off! He hastily grabbed binoculars, scanning toward the gunshot. After adjusting for a while, suddenly the sampans and ships became clearly visible. He was so frightened he nearly fell on his rear. He scrambled into the beacon tower's duty room where a hand-crank alarm sat. He cranked it frantically.
