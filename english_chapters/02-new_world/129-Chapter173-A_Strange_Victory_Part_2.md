# Chapter 173: A Strange Victory (Part 2)

**Battle Statistics:**

**Results:** 102 killed in action, 70 died of wounds, 213 prisoners (35 lightly wounded). Captured over 400 melee weapons, seven three-barreled muskets, and seven warhorses. Tonight's dinner: the eighth horse—it had a broken leg.

**Our casualties:** 11 lightly wounded, 10 from twisted ankles or falls during the pursuit—running through freshly harvested paddies was indeed hazardous. One soldier suffered a crushed foot from dropping an artillery shell.

By afternoon, prisoner processing was mostly complete. Per Ma Qianzhu's instructions, the prisoners received food. The cafeteria's unchanging prisoner fare was congee. The prisoners were clearly still terrified, eyeing the transmigrators' food with fear. Finally, someone brave and hungry enough started gulping down the porridge. With a leader, the rest mobbed the rice bucket, pushing and shoving until the guards' shouting prevented actual fights.

Now they could observe the legendary Ming-era pirates up close: a chaotic cluster of peasants squatting together. Not even decent clothes. Bare-chested or wearing thin jackets. Filthy, stinking, ragged garments that looked ready to disintegrate at any moment. Through the gaps in their clothing, bamboo-jointed ribs and bloated bellies were visible.

Xiong Buyu, with his translators and Security personnel, was working on them intensely.

About ten men looked more alert. They ate without scrambling, their faces expressionless, appearing dull and depressed. But occasional furtive glances revealed hidden scheming.

"These should be the core members," Ran Yao observed. "Start with them."

Preliminary interrogations confirmed the pirates were from Zhu Cailao's gang. Fifty were veteran pirates; the rest had been recruited within the past half-month. No combat experience—pure cannon fodder.

Most absurdly: several dozen were actually Lingao rear-garrison military households. The Liu *qianhu* from the rear garrison often rented out his weapons, vessels, and military households to pirates for extra income. A *qianhu* colluding with pirates was not unusual; coastal garrisons had various relationships with maritime powers.

But among the prisoners, there was not a single leader-level figure. Last time they had at least captured the ship-captain Shi Shisi. This time, not one decent leader. They had landed at dawn from five large ships at Shipai, then advanced under a "steward's" command. That steward was either dead or had escaped—he was not among the prisoners, nor was he identifiable among the cannon-pulverized corpses.

Most prisoners only knew they had come to attack some "bald bandits." Recruiters said these "bald bandits" had stolen much treasure from Boss Zhu. Bairren Beach was all wealth. Boss Zhu was attacking for revenge, and all loot would belong to them.

Among the captured items, many weapons bore Zhu Cailao's marks and insignia. Some corpses carried Zhu Cailao's documents and command flags. Looking at the testimonies and evidence, Ran Yao frowned.

As dusk fell, the transmigrator camps echoed with laughter and chatter. Zhu Cailao was nothing special after all. Zhang Bailin grinned from ear to ear. Today's battle: eighty artillery rounds had routed over four hundred pirates. A great triumph for the artillery.

The cafeteria butchered the killed horse—providing the Training Battalion with a feast of horse meat and offal. Though it was horse meat, the cafeteria had fish sauce, spices, and abundant salt. Compared to the typical plain-boiled meat from dead horses, this was the difference between heaven and earth. Wu Nanhai also rendered some horse fat. It smelled foul but made fried food fragrant. Beijing's famous *jianbing guanzi* used horse fat for frying. Without the *guanzi* crackers, Wu Nanhai fried dried pumpkin slices, pouring on chopped garlic. The soldiers enthusiastically welcomed it. Compared to each person's small portion of meat and offal, this unlimited, fatty food better satisfied everyone's cravings.

Huang Xiong received his small bowl of horse meat and offal. He poked at it with chopsticks—a few meat slices, some intestine and lung pieces—smelling intensely fragrant from the spices mixed with the meat. Though tough, the meat was deliciously savory. As a former Ming officer, he had eaten dead mule and horse meat before, but never this well prepared. Looking around, the entire company was eating and drinking, making satisfied sounds. Two victories, yet these Chiefs were stingy—just one horse meat meal! Huang Xiong had expected some silver reward. But reconsidering the two battles, he had just stood in formation holding a rifle. Everything was won by the artillery.

Looking around again, Company Commander Old Tiger You and the platoon commanders were also eating horse meat and fried pumpkin, their bowls filled with brown rice. On this point, Huang Xiong admired these Chiefs' officer-soldier equality: besides extra equipment, officers had no special treatment. Same food and clothing. Housing was just a single room in the barracks. Except for weekly "weekends" at Bairren Fortress, they had no luxuries—not even someone to make their beds.

While eating, he heard soldiers discussing the two battles:

"...If all fighting is like this, soldiering is easy..."

"The Chiefs' cannons are so powerful, who can stop us?"

"You think the Chiefs are planning... you know?"

"Stop pretending you don't know. Rebellion? I think maybe."

"Rebellion means entire family execution—"

"Execute what? Those regular army weaklings? There's nothing to fear in rebellion." This one started dreaming. "If the rebellion succeeds, we'll all be founding fathers. Each of us will get thousands of *mu* of land."

"I want a wife. Over twenty and never even touched a woman's hand."

"One wife? I want a dozen, just like the city tycoons!"

"You're skin and bones. Won't a dozen wives grind you to dust?"

...

Huang Xiong's heart stirred. He had come seeking refuge as a criminal. Looking now, these "bald bandits" had grand ambitions. Even if not rebellion, at least they had regional warlord aspirations. While pondering, a soldier asked:

"Squad Leader Huang, you think the Chiefs have such intentions?"

Huang Xiong put down his bowl: "How would I know? But these two opponents were trash. Against regular troops, it wouldn't be this easy."

"But our cannons—"

"Regulars have them too. Red-Barbarian cannons." Huang Xiong had seen his garrison's artillery drills. These cannons operated similarly to Red-Barbarian cannons but seemed lighter and more transportable.

"Besides, the Liao garrison has Red-Barbarian cannons. So what? They still got smashed by the Jurchens. Can your cannons fire continuously? Jurchens rely on fast horses and sharp arrows. One shot kills maybe a dozen; meanwhile, several hundred cavalry charge dozens of paces closer. A few shots and cavalry are in the formation. Then it's infantry melee."

This frightened the soldiers, dampening the festive mood. Huang Xiong suddenly became alert. What was he doing? In a garrison army, this would be "undermining morale"—he would be dragged out and beheaded immediately. Why was he saying this?

He quickly changed the subject: "This is Qiongzhou. The Jurchen are ten thousand *li* away. Why panic? Brothers won't be fighting in Liaodong."

He quickly glanced around for outsiders, then rambled about miscellaneous anecdotes to divert the soldiers' attention.

The setting sun slowly descended over Bopu's Lingao Point. The newly restored Lingao beacon tower stood tall. The newly completed gun emplacement housed a 12-pounder cannon pointing seaward. The tower had a searchlight. Li Di, wearing radio and night vision equipment, stood watch with two Navy sentries. Looking toward Bairren Fortress, the day's bustle was quieting. Outside the fortress, on-duty personnel lit bonfires. Inside, many departments still showed scattered lights—people still working. Here at Bopu, the charcoal kilns glowed fiercely against the dark. A fishy stench drifted on the wind from the seafood processing plant. At the river mouth, the *Fengcheng* showed faint lights, almost blending with the starry sky.

Every few minutes, he surveyed the surroundings with night vision binoculars. Bopu was not like the early days when a ring camp sufficed. Work sites had expanded considerably. Though key points had ring defenses, blanket illumination like before was impossible. Besides lighting at key intersections, they relied more on night vision equipment and hidden sentries. They still could not fully trust native soldiers, so night watch duties were always transmigrators or transmigrator-led.

Through binoculars, he spotted several figures slowly approaching the beach camp. Their outlines suggested friendlies, but protocol required notifying the hidden sentries.

"Tan Ming, Tan Ming. Someone approaching your position."

"Understood." Tan Ming, on duty at the river mouth, was from the Construction Team. His excellent physique and hardworking nature had gotten him drafted into the core militia. Daytime work plus night duty. The perks: extra access to currently-scarce items—cigarettes, canned goods, cola. Core militia also regularly watched movies: first military educational films, second various commercial films, and third was late-night fare—not for good children.

"Password!"

"Refrigerator! Response?"

"Haier! Which department?" Tan Ming gripped his SKS rifle.

"I'm Wu De from Bairren Commune!" The dark-faced approaching man had several uniformed men behind him.

So it was Wu De—a big official! Tan Ming snapped to attention, his speech becoming unclear:

"Director Wu—no, Commune Chief—"

"Just call me A-De. You're not a native." Wu De had never seen a transmigrator so respectful toward him.

"I'm Tan Ming from the Construction Team—" Tan Ming felt a bit embarrassed. Years at society's bottom made one this way. He felt a little sad.

Wu De vaguely remembered this person from the early construction days when he had dealt frequently with the Construction Team.

"You're 'Fat Ming,' right?" He matched the nickname with the face from deep memory. Actually, the nickname was now inaccurate. Long-term labor and high-protein, low-fat intake had made him quite fit, not "fat" at all.

"Right, right! I'm 'Fat Ming'! You remember me!"

"We used to meet at the worksite all the time." Wu De saw he wanted to reminisce, but this was a hidden sentry position—chatting here was not appropriate. Plus, he had business. He continued: "I need to board the *Fengcheng*. Where do I embark?"

"Go to the Navy Harbor Office below Lingao Point Fort. They manage everything here."

Wu De shook his head. The Navy's aggressive territorial ambitions were not a good sign. Though Navy-born himself, long Executive Committee work gave him a broader perspective. He disapproved of the current Army-Navy tensions. This trip, he also wanted to speak with He Ming, Ming Qiu, and other veterans.
