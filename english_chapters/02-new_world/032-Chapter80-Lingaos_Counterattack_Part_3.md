# Chapter 80: Lingao's Counterattack (Part 3)

"I am out of ammo!"

"Bullets—where are the bullets!"

Before battle, everyone had been issued ninety rounds. SKS-D rifles used AK's 30-round magazines. Everyone was confident that such equipment could shatter even Manchu Iron Cavalry—and they were not wrong, but obviously not in these people's hands. Seeing enemies not falling dead at gunshots like in games and movies, not disintegrating as expected, but grinding their teeth, howling, charging forward—many panicked. Some forgot to grab magazines; others fumbled on their bodies, could not yank out perfectly fine magazines.

"Do not panic—hold steady!" He Ming ran along the earthen berm, shouting. He knew these people's military training was worse than raw recruits; they had never fought real battles. Temporary panic was inevitable, so he ran back and forth desperately, keeping morale.

During this lull in fire, the militia had pushed many sandbag-laden handcarts to the berm. Bowmen, using the carts as cover, loosed volleys. Someone took an arrow, fell howling. Hippo and the medical team tried to help, but someone shoved him hard, something hit his head, and he discovered a guy had thrown his rifle at him and was fleeing in panic.

"Come back! You coward!" Hippo roared. Fortunately, he had a steel helmet—otherwise that 8.5-pound rifle would have cracked his skull.

Mid-roar, suddenly white smoke billowed from beyond the barbed wire. Cannon thundered. Hippo instinctively ducked—his helmet rang with clattering, something struck his body, stinging. Looking up, someone had tumbled from the berm in front of him, face covered in blood, terrifying. Dragging him, he found the man still moaning—still savable.

The two *huzhun* cannons' volley at the berm overwhelmed the panicking defenders. Though this cannon type had limited range and power, firing simultaneously from under fifty paces—even stone chips and scrap iron became lethal. Many fell wounded immediately. First time facing real combat, no transmigrator displayed any protagonist's aura, coolly charging and slashing with swords. The two small iron cannons' roar became the final straw breaking their fragile spirits. Seeing companions beside them screaming blood-covered on the ground, some finally could not take it—shrieking, scrambling, fleeing. He Ming almost wanted to draw his pistol and execute a few on the spot. *If only we had one platoon of PLA—* he thought—*even with Sanba rifles, we could break this rag-clad militia in one minute.* They had underestimated the enemy's fighting spirit and overestimated modern people's psychological resilience.

"Shoot! Shoot!" He Ming helped someone struggling with a magazine yank it out and snap it in. "Keep firing!"

Some of the boldest militia had already climbed the berm. He Ming gathered seven or eight Military Group members, concentrating fire. The SKS-D's 30-round magazine gave them huge advantage. Scorching brass cartridges littered the ground. The militia massed at the breach fell in waves; survivors fled down.

This small counterattack stabilized the line. Fire from all sides intensified. Using this moment, he and other Military Group members encouraged defenders, calming those who had panicked. Li Jun kicked and shoved the fleers back into line. The medical team quickly dragged the wounded into buildings, away from the blood-and-gore scene that hurt morale.

"Do not panic—keep heads down—do not stop shooting—they cannot get up..." He Ming walked along the berm, shouting.

Huang Shoutong wanted to try one more push. His militia had surged to the berm's base, but now they were caught in crossfire from multiple camps. Men kept falling; the militia suffered heavy casualties. Fire came from all directions—pirate firearms clearly outranged anything Ming. Occasionally, shots from above struck with devastating power; many men's skulls vanished at a single gunshot.

Cannon crews drew concentrated fire; in moments, all were killed. Bowmen preparing to support the climb never got a chance to shoot before being killed; the smart ones hid under the sandbag carts. Dense bullets rained on the militia like a downpour. They held at the berm only briefly before scattering under fire. They never accurately gauged SKS range; many were shot down while fleeing.

Seeing the militia rout, He Ming quickly radioed a ceasefire order. Even so, ragged shooting continued a while before stopping.

"Why stop firing?" Someone ran over carrying an SKS. "I was just getting into it!"

He Ming saw this was the very coward who had thrown his rifle and fled, only to be dragged back by Li Jun. Seeing his nostrils flaring with excitement, face glowing, recalling his earlier panic—He Ming shook his head.

"We want prisoners, not corpses." He turned to radio the mobile team—send them to intercept the fleeing militia.

The farm vehicles' appearance terrified remaining militia. They had prepared oil-and-gunpowder bottles smeared with chicken blood for fighting "demon carts"—but now who remembered that? They just ran. But how could humans on flat riverbed outrun 4WD farm trucks? Soon, after the vehicles encircled and shot down a few, most huddled together on the riverbed. Xiong Buyou kept shouting "Surrender and live!"—most knelt and surrendered. Only a few fast runners or strong swimmers escaped.

The rout was so swift they could not even signal retreat with smoke. He Ming left some to clean the battlefield, taking eight farm vehicles and fifty-plus men to cut off the Bopu enemy's retreat.

The Bopu attack had begun at noon. Already warned, the logging teams and laver/oyster-harvesting laborers around the area had withdrawn into camp. Fu Bowen had militia wave flags while constantly firing three-eyed guns, drums and gongs creating huge commotion. Just as he was directing from a hill he believed safe, a retainer beside him suddenly developed a hole in his chest and collapsed. Terrified, Fu Bowen bolted. Seeing their master flee, the militia threw down their gear and scattered—running even earlier than Huang Shoutong's forces. Naturally, no retreat signal was sent.

But signal or not, it made no difference now. Liu Dalin and Huang Shoutong's planned left and right columns had both completely routed. If anyone was smarter, Fu Bowen's timely flight at least saved most of the right-column militia from capture—He Ming's pursuit vehicles caught only stragglers.

After battle, Bairrentou Beach reeked of blood. From the administrative zone's berm to the trench, bodies lay everywhere. The homebodies who had survived "intense combat" dragged rifles, looking dazed. *I killed people?* It seemed unbelievable, yet the bodies everywhere proved their deeds. Some vomited; some wept; some laughed baffling laughs...

*Psychological intervention for transmigrators needs to go on the agenda,* Xiao Zishan thought, walking toward the administrative zone. Today he had watched the battle from the vehicle-storage area. Recently, transmigrators had implemented an emergency system: every camp always had several Committee members, never all gathered together—to avoid being wiped out in one stroke.

On the battlefield, Military Group members with bayoneted SKS rifles vigilantly checked each body. If still moving or showing life signs, the medical team moved them aside. Unless lightly wounded, they would not receive immediate treatment—only those who could last long enough would be treated. Besides, many transmigrators had also been wounded.

"Casualties?" Seeing Shi Niaoren also present, Xiao Zishan asked.

"No deaths so far, but many wounded," Shi Niaoren said. "Mostly from the *huzhun* cannons—many face and limb injuries."

"Oh?"

"Everyone had stab-proof vests, steel helmets—what could those little iron cannons do?" Shi Niaoren dismissively indicated the overturned cannon carts at the berm—two short, ugly iron tubes lay on the ground. Their crude iron and ugly shapes made it hard to associate them with the word "cannon."

"Initial review looks lucky—no eye injuries. Most serious is one arrow wound, arm—" Shi Niaoren gestured. "His arm will not work properly again."

Xiao Zishan was silent: *Better than disability.* But he could not say that.

The casualty report came quickly:

Travelers: 21 wounded—including one burn from touching a hot SKS barrel.

By comparison, the attacking militia left over one hundred bodies on both battlefields alone; thirty-plus wounded were abandoned—these were severely injured, mostly dying within a day or two. Over 130 were captured, now detained on the riverbed, spirits crushed.

Captured items were considerable: besides many blades, spears, bows, and crossbows—two *huzhun* cannons, drums, flags, crude handcarts, even several carts of gunpowder and scrap-iron cannon shot. The Planning Committee catalogued and stored everything. Weapons could later arm native forces—at worst, melted down. Cannons and scrap iron were useless—raw material for the future Steel Group. Handcarts were useful for the construction site. As for the gunpowder—though the Chemistry Group sneered at it, it was still stored.

The transmigrators' biggest gain: three captured horses. Hainan did not produce horses; these were imported from the southwest. Small horses—probably unsuitable for cavalry—but fine as draft animals. Another five or six dead horses were handed to the Agriculture Group.
