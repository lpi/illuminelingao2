# Chapter 131: Guangzhou Forward Station

Liang Cunhou managed a smile, saying, "My grain relief serves two purposes: first, I can't bear seeing commoners homeless and starving on the roads; second, I fear the desperate poor might take desperate measures. Gentlemen, do you know how many refugees have flooded Guangzhou recently? At a rough count, there are no fewer than 30,000! It's still the autumn harvest now. Come spring's famine season—who knows how many more there will be! If someone incites an uprising, the region will be devastated! Laughably, many gentry—calling themselves Confucian disciples—accuse me of seeking fame and popularity, as if I harbor ulterior motives. Ridiculous! Ridiculous!" Realizing he'd spoken too freely, he quickly cupped his hands. "Pardon my outburst!"

"Just missing two people," Xiao Zishan murmured.

"What did the manager say?" Liang Cunhou didn't understand.

"No, nothing." Xiao Zishan quickly changed subjects. "Young Master Liang, we'd like to recruit some refugees in Guangzhou—sending them to Qiongzhou for land clearing. Would the officials object?"

"Land clearing?" Young Master Liang laughed dryly. "Don't take offense at my cold water. You'll invest capital in clearing land—but likely can't even pay taxes. A year's hard work will all profit those clerks. Recruiting refugees is charitable—but if things don't continue, you'll leave them worse off."

The Committee had given intelligence personnel important instructions: collect all Ming-era social information. Guo Yi, seeing an opportunity, feigned ignorance. "Why does Young Master Liang say this?"

"I've never visited Qiongzhou, but I hear it's humid, malarial, and typhoon-prone. The Li people rebel. Though wasteland abounds, settling isn't easy. Moreover, you're all merchants with no examination credentials. Won't you be fat sheep for the local clerks! At best, you'll lose your investment; at worst, utter ruin! Ah, this world!"

Guo Yi could only nod agreement; he dared not say more. While they were talking, a servant approached and quietly spoke to Liang. Young Master Liang stood, citing other business, and cupped his hands in farewell. Everyone parted. Shortly after, a servant ran up, respectfully asking, "My young master asks your lodging address? He'll visit another day."

Everyone exchanged glances: they'd been completely deferential earlier—neither reciting "thousand miles frozen, ten thousand miles snow-swept," nor discoursing on human rights, democracy, or freedom. What had this gentry scion seen in these merchants?

Guo Yi quickly said, "Our lodging is on Huifu Street—the shop called 'Zizhen Studio'."

The servant confirmed, extracting a plum-red paper from a visiting card box. "My young master's calling card. Please accept."

Presenting a calling card on the first meeting showed high regard. Guo Yi, having attended Yu Eshui's "Ming Dynasty Customs and Society" lecture series before departure, politely declined. "I dare not accept." Only after repeated refusals did he accept.

Xiao Zishan, still worried, rushed to the escort bureau's mule and horse inn. The arrivals had already been settled under bureau arrangements. Sun Kecheng was initially dumbfounded—hearing they'd buy some servants, he never expected so many overnight. The bureau's entire staff mobilized to cook, boil water, and summon doctors for the sick. The chaos lasted until nearly the first watch before settling.

Returning to Huifu Street, everyone deliberated. The goods weren't fully procured yet, but over 200 people were already purchased. Staying at Qiwei's inn wasn't sustainable: first, they were imposing on others, and second, once fed, the people's thoughts would wander. They weren't jailers monitoring 24/7. It was better to ship people back first, then return for the goods.

This proposal received enthusiastic approval from the crew, surprising Xiao Zishan. He'd expected them to resist an immediate return, having just arrived. Unbeknownst to him, several harbored their own schemes. The decision was made: the purchased slaves would rest for two days at Qiwei's inn, then the crew would transport them back. The others would remain in Guangzhou, continuing the forward station work.

Building renovation proceeded intensively. According to the plan, the Huifu Street compound would transform into a jewelry house with a shop in the front and a workshop in the back, selling various transmigrator-made luxury goods. Some finishing and assembly work could be done here, while key processes stayed at Bairren Fortress. Former jewelry company manager Yan Maoda had jewelry design and processing expertise. He'd brought extensive new-style materials. He said that if they recruited some skilled craftsmen, they could manufacture these pieces. It was better than just selling glassware and avoided conflict with their agent Gao Ju.

Xiao Zishan, leveraging his Gao Ju connections, recruited many workers for the renovations. With ample funds—using the jewelry house as an excuse—the entire compound was fortified. Though not quite resembling the US Embassy, it was close enough. Imitating Shanxi money shop and pawnshop security measures, iron gratings were installed in the ceilings against aerial intruders. Stone foundation walls were topped with mortared blue bricks, making them extremely solid. Only the front portions had traditional long windows; the rear buildings had ordinary windows with iron bars. Most secure was the "vault" courtyard: three entirely brick-and-stone rooms without wood. There were no windows, and the iron door had 21st-century locks. It was similar to embassy safe rooms, used for confidential matters. One room was for telecommunications, one was a conference room, and one was the actual vault—storing not just gold and silver but, more importantly, materials, weapons, and reconnaissance equipment. Besides radios, Intelligence provided walkie-talkies, pistols, binoculars, night vision, digital cameras, and laptops. As for power, besides hand-crank generators, there were solar panel arrays—limited capacity, but sufficient for the radio and laptop.

The originally planned monitoring and security systems were suspended due to power issues. However, an infrared alarm was installed at the safe room entrance.

For water, there were two usable wells on the compound. Sun Chang had already hired deep cleaning during the initial renovations. To prevent the delicate modern people's indigestion, the station brought a simple water filter and sterilizer, as the filter cartridge was replaceable yearly.

The *Deng Yingzhou* delivered 30-plus tons of materials and 5,000 *liang* in cash. This was the station's entire startup capital. According to regulations, forward personnel couldn't withdraw from Gao Ju's 200,000 *liang* account.

Everyone bustled about. Guo Yi sat alone, contemplating future operations. The Committee's station tasks boiled down to intelligence collection and conducting trade.

Either goal required first building broad social connections. They now had the Gao family and Qiwei Bureau as entry points. Next came expanding work across social strata.

Guo Yi recalled Yu Eshui's pre-departure "Ming Dynasty Socioeconomic Conditions" course, pondering which level to breach.

As merchants, directly cultivating mid-to-upper-tier officials was difficult. Even spending heavily only bought superficial prestige—rarely achieving later-era collusion between officials and merchants. But officials had strong purchasing power and political authority, so they were worth cultivating eventually.

Second: local gentry and wealthy merchants—credentialed or official-connected—were the local powerbrokers. Gao Ju was such a person. More accessible, yet linked to upper officialdom. This stratum was the station's current priority. In Guangzhou, they'd met Liang Cunhou. Though his cultivation motives were unclear, as a *juren*, his influence exceeded Gao Ju's. Properly leveraged, he could open major doors in this class.

Officials' secretaries, servants, stewards, guests; various yamen clerks, constables—though low status—were highly active, knowing all about officials and yamen movements. For political intelligence, he should focus on them. The Qiwei Bureau dealt with such people and could leverage their connections.

As for commoners, from them one learned market gossip and public opinion. This intelligence must also be collected.

But the entire Guangzhou station had only six people including himself:

Station Chief: Guo Yi

Commerce Directors: Yan Maoda, Zhang Xin

Radio Operator: Zhang Yuchen

Intelligence Operatives: Lu Rong, Peipei

Just these few handling so much was somewhat difficult. Yan Maoda and Zhang Xin were both sales veterans and battle-hardened commercial operators. Once adapting here and improving their Cantonese-Mandarin, commercial entertainment and sales organization would be child's play.

Zhang Yuchen was communications staff and also taciturn; he could only handle internal affairs.

Intelligence work apparently fell to himself, Lu Rong, and Peipei. How to use Peipei was a headache. She seemed unconcerned and quite confident. Guo Yi strongly suspected she hadn't considered the underground work's seriousness and danger, merely treating this as her performance stage. Her personal luggage alone filled a dozen boxes—he knew without looking that they were all costumes.

He organized his thoughts, drafting current-phase objectives and station regulations. He'd meet with the remaining forward team before Xiao Zishan's departure to assign work.
