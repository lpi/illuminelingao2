# Chapter 93: New Farm (Part 3)

"Alright, let's first take stock of our assets," Wu Nanhai proposed at the Agriculture Committee's first full meeting.

The Committee already had ledgers, but fifty-plus days ashore had changed numbers and categories, so corrections were needed.

**Seeds**: 100 kg of hybrid rice. This "crossing superweapon" was not as magical as legend claimed. Essentially plant-kingdom "mules," they had many advantages but could not reproduce. Wu Nanhai had brought these to achieve a first-year bumper harvest, stabilizing grain reserves. With grain, everything else followed.

Other rice varieties included 50 kg each of twenty types, totaling 1,000 kg. This included 1960s–70s Lingao-adapted high-yield, lodging-resistant varieties like Guangguichao and Shuanggui.

High-yield sweet potatoes for future promotion: 100 kg. While 1628 Hainan should already have sweet-potato cultivation, these were quality seed tubers. Potatoes: 100 kg. Lingao's conditions were not ideal for potatoes, but this crop worked as a vegetable, grain, and feed, offering great potential when promoted to the mainland. Also: 20 kg of kudzu and 20 kg of quality alfalfa seeds.

Corn, wheat, and barley: 100 kg each. Various beans—soybeans, mung beans, adzuki beans, black beans, etc.—10 kg each.

**Vegetable seeds**: peppers, tomatoes, cabbage, greens, carrots, pumpkins, cucumbers, onions, various scallions, garlic, etc.—1 kg each.

**Spices**: These were easily obtainable via Southeast Asian maritime trade, so they had only brought chili peppers and Sichuan peppercorns—ten varieties, 10 kg total.

Before boarding, he had also bought several 1 kg packets of Hainan-suitable fruit seeds.

Finally, he had not forgotten tobacco—his little vice. 10 kg of tobacco seeds would bring a future tobacco-industry monopoly. Wu Nanhai had already planned to manufacture his own cigarettes once the tobacco grew.

All seeds had proper packaging with a two-year shelf life. Some varieties were not suited locally—prepared for northern regions—so he had bought vacuum-packed versions with seven or eight years of storage.

"That's the seeds." Ye Yuming continued. "Also some seedlings—must be transplanted to the nursery ASAP."

**Seedlings** were considerable: 50 coconut palms, 50 rubber trees, 20 coffee trees, 20 cacao, 20 coca shrubs, 50 quinine trees, 5 poppies, plus timber trees, fast-growth trees, fruit trees, and sugarcane and banana cultivars. All were useful, but management and cultivation were challenging. Wu Nanhai recalled his tropical agriculture professor saying that at Yunnan's educated-youth farms, specially cultivating quinine seedlings had germination rates under 5%; quinine seeds were "worth their weight in gold." Quinine was the specific drug for malaria—without it, the transmigrators' plans for colonizing Taiwan northward and Southeast Asia southward would both collapse. So besides seedlings, they had brought backup seeds.

**Livestock and poultry**: currently 6 pigs—two pairs of Landrace and one pair of Northeast Min pigs. Landrace from Denmark were lean-meat pigs, used as crossbreeding sires. Northeast Min pigs from the northeast were local breeds—tolerant of rough feed, with high litter sizes—used as crossbreeding dams. This breed also had especially high fat-deposition ratios, which was useful for obtaining animal fats. Now they also had four local piglets.

**Horses**: only one pair of Tieling draft horses—a relatively scarce type in ancient China. Nick's two racehorses were not originally under their management, but after "Blue Lightning" died, a heartbroken Nick put "Aranchi" under Agriculture Committee care. Initially, Wu Nanhai was very reluctant—Nick's care requirements were annoying: feed five times daily, give it warm water to drink... Until Yang Baogui said this old racehorse still had value—it was a mare.

"If it were a stallion, it would've been gelded at age two or three during racing training—it would be useless now." Yang Baogui was fairly satisfied with this horse.

"How old is it?"

"Thirteen or fourteen." Yang Baogui flipped through a notebook. "Haven't checked its teeth yet. Horses can live thirty years. Too old for racing, but can make do as a broodmare."

The three captured local horses, per Yang Baogui's identification, were all Yunnan ponies, about seven or eight years old; two were geldings. These three could be directly used for labor.

"Best if we could get more horses." Wu Nanhai eyed the various small farm implements unloaded but not yet organized. They had small walking tractors, as well as large and medium tractors currently commandeered by the Engineering Department. But long-term, they needed draft animals. Before mechanization resources ran out, they must quickly enter the horse-and-mule era—meeting not just their own needs but future new-agriculture farmers' needs.

"Too many places need horses, but Hainan isn't suited for horse-raising." Yang Baogui shook his head. "Climate's too hot; rainy season too humid. Horses are extremely finicky creatures."

"How about breeding some mules?" Ye Yuming suggested. "Don't we have one donkey pair?"

"Please—I'm not about to start..." *(implied: "procuring" mating arrangements)*

"?" Ye Yuming looked confused. Even the usually proper Wu Nanhai grinned lewdly.

"Right!" Wu Nanhai recalled his livestock-course lectures on horse breeding—lessons that made 1980s-born female students blush crimson.

"What?" Yang Baogui asked Wu Nanhai with a smile.

"Nothing—I took that course. I watched some horse 'adult films' a few times."

"Let's table mule-breeding for now. The horse breeding season doesn't start until March. Plus these animals are very neurotic—they've been disturbed too much lately. Let them rest, fatten up, and adapt before we proceed."

Besides these large animals, there were small but very useful ones: two pairs of rabbits (meat and fur types); four different-breed roosters (half meat, half egg) and twenty hens; two pairs of ducks; two pairs of turkeys; ten carrier pigeons—also Nick's private property. Finally, a calico cat some girl had brought, now apparently forgotten—still wearing a pretty bow around its neck.

Besides living creatures, there were animals in cellular form: a liquid-nitrogen storage tank with goat, sheep, quality beef cattle, and dairy cattle cells. This tank was still stored in the ship's cold room. But they lacked liquid-nitrogen technology—they must quickly find suitable local dams.

After the inventory, these 21st-century new farmers leveled the land and built simple poultry sheds. The sand-bedded free-range area was fenced with dense bamboo and planted with loofah, hyacinth beans, and gourds to provide shade for chickens and ducks while yielding vegetables. Two birds, one stone.

But after the long journey, these poultry looked obviously dazed, with poor appetites. Constantly disturbing these animals was problematic. Hopefully, the wide-open spaces and fresh air here would help them recover soon. Brothers were waiting for eggs.

Wu Nanhai built grape trellises over courtyard paths, planted fruit trees on side spaces, and created several garden plots under trees for herbs and medicinal plants.

"You're turning the whole yard upside down!" Huang Dashan pushed his two-wheeled cart over—just transferred to the Agriculture Committee through the Personnel Group. His cart held his luggage.

"Hehe, in a while, this place will be fragrant with flowers and fruit." Wu Nanhai admired the messy bamboo-and-rope trellises. He glanced at the thick-spectacled newcomer: "You are?"

"I'm Huang Dashan. Here's my transfer order." Huang Dashan pulled a small slip from his pocket.

"Welcome, welcome!" Wu Nanhai recalled this person had applied several times to join the Committee—stating expertise in cultivating edible fungi, bringing many mushroom cultures and growth media. "You specialize in fungi cultivation?"

"No." Huang Dashan smiled innocuously. "My profession is biochemistry lab technician. Specialty is live-animal bacterial and viral culturing. But growing mushrooms is purely a side income."

"Then make the sideline your main line." Wu Nanhai was satisfied with this new asset. "Where do you think your mushroom shed should go?"

"Under the fruit trees would work—grape trellises are actually the best spot." Huang Dashan surveyed the area. "Start with easy oyster mushrooms—easy to grow, high yield. No shed needed. When conditions allow, build specialized cultivation sheds. I brought quite a few cultures. But I'll need a room for my lab—I brought standard biochem lab equipment." He added: "Preferably an isolated building, far from other living things..."

"Hm?" Wu Nanhai did not understand his meaning but nodded anyway.

Yang Baogui received a room as a veterinary office plus a bedroom. His carefully guarded boxes—hidden in tents and prefabs, painstakingly carried throughout the journey—finally had a stable home. Inside was complete animal medical equipment and reference books. Wu Nanhai planned to dedicate one room for storing all brought agricultural books, planting manuals, and instructional video discs—a specialized agricultural library.
