# Chapter 127: Guangzhou Trip (Part 3)

Xiao Zishan instructed Sun Chang to arrange mule carts and sedan chairs to fetch the people from the dock. The others quickly set about cooking and cleaning, and the empty mansion suddenly bustled with activity. Sun Chang said mules and carts presented no difficulty—he merely had to contact the Qiwei Escort Bureau. Escort bureaus, due to their convoy needs, typically operated mule and horse cart services as sideline businesses. Everything was readily available.

While arranging the transport, Xiao Zishan also ordered a sedan chair to carry him on a visit to Gao Ju. En route, he questioned Sun Chang about the developments of the past year. Sun Chang reported that since their departure, Gao Ju had frequently sent messengers bearing gifts, inquiring after news of the Australian merchants. The neighborhood remained peaceful; apart from Liu Laoxiang's disturbances in the Pearl River estuary causing slight market jitters, nothing major had occurred. Of official circles he knew little—only that some palace bigwig in Beijing had fallen and that Guangzhou's officialdom had experienced some shakeups. The details remained unclear to him.

Xiao Zishan knew perfectly well that this "palace bigwig" was Wei Zhongxian. History in this timeline hadn't altered its trajectory: the all-powerful "Nine Thousand Years" had committed suicide the previous year on the sixth day of the eleventh lunar month at an inn in Fucheng County, Hebei. From last December through the first half of this year, the Chongzhen Emperor had been vigorously pursuing the Wei faction remnants. Official shakeups were entirely unsurprising. The transmigrators should thank this situation: with everyone panicking, no one had any attention to spare for some pirate incursion on Hainan.

Xiao Zishan's sudden arrival brought Gao Ju both surprise and joy. Regarding the Wei Zhongxian shrine construction matter, having found no good options, he had employed the strategy that Manager Wen had taught him: "stall." That manager had stated clearly, "Within the month, there will be major changes." Indeed, Eunuch Yang had been stationed in Guangzhou demanding daily progress reports. Gao Ju had dared not delay too egregiously, so he simply prepared leisurely and dragged proceedings out for about twenty days. Then Little Eunuch Yang had suddenly appeared to bid farewell, ordering the shrine construction halted and hurriedly departing for Beijing with the prepared Australian goods. Gao Ju had been flabbergasted. Another ten days later, correspondence from Beijing had arrived—only then had he learned that on May eighteenth, the Emperor had suddenly fallen seriously ill. This left Gao Ju not merely amazed but genuinely chilled; goosebumps rose on his flesh.

"On the eighteenth of May, there will be changes in Beijing. Matters can be delayed." Those had been Manager Wen's parting words. Comparing that to present reality, this already mysterious group of sea merchants seemed even more unfathomable. He had urgently dispatched agents to inquire: had anyone sighted strange foreign mega-ships? There was no news. He resigned himself to waiting—surely they would come find him; after all, 200,000 *liang* in payment remained here. He waited over a year, but still no word came. Just when hope had faded, this past month rumors had reached him: near Qiongzhou, an unprecedented giant ship had appeared. The crew were all short-haired and short-clothed—and extremely fierce. He had secretly wondered: could this be the Australian merchants' ship? He was just considering whether to send investigators when they arrived of their own accord.

Gao Ju ordered preparations for a welcome banquet while exchanging pleasantries. He produced the sales ledgers—currently 50,000 *liang* was available; the remaining amount could be gathered within ten days or so.

"The silver is not urgent—it can remain with Manager Gao for now." The transmigrators currently lacked materials more than silver. Xiao Zishan wasted no time, explaining that this trip was for procurement. Given the diverse merchandise required, he would need Manager Gao's assistance. Gao Ju assumed the requests would involve the usual porcelain, spices, and hardwoods, so he readily agreed. But upon opening the list, he was stunned. The items were completely unexpected: pig iron, graphite, fluorite, chalcanthite, alum, copperas, saltpeter, Glauber's salt, soda ash, sulfur, arsenic, realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, borax, gypsum ore, tin, lead, copper, mercury...

Most of these Gao Ju didn't even recognize. Some he knew from workshop use, while others were simply medicinals. Saltpeter and sulfur were government-controlled. Pig iron—10,000 *shi* demanded right off—was manageable; he merely needed to visit multiple forges. But mercury—ten *shi*?! All the mercury in Guangzhou combined might not yield one *shi*. What did they want this for? Had some Australian emperor died, requiring mercury for embalming?

Lost in speculation, he was interrupted when Xiao Zishan noticed his shifting expressions. "Are there any difficulties?"

"All findable." Gao Ju set down the list. "It's just—aren't these quantities rather excessive? Take chalcanthite and mercury—the entire city might hold one *shi*. Where would such quantities come from?"

"Then please trouble Elder Brother Gao. Whatever amount is available, we'll take it." Xiao Zishan didn't know what these materials were for, but specifically ordered items were surely essential.

"Since Little Brother entrusts Elder Brother with this, naturally I'll do my utmost." Gao Ju's form of address shifted suddenly, and his voice dropped lower. "However, several items are contraband. Elder Brother is not incapable—but everything needs proper justification for safe handling."

Xiao Zishan was startled. He had known only that saltpeter and sulfur were possibly controlled. He hadn't considered the others. "Which are contraband?"

"Iron is prohibited from export, but that's manageable. Copper, arsenic, saltpeter, and sulfur present the real difficulties—especially given the quantities you want—"

"These are raw materials for manufacturing Australian goods." Xiao Zishan had learned from Sun Chang that Gao Ju had made a fortune on Australian goods, becoming Guangzhou's "wealth legend." Using "raw materials for Australian goods" as justification would ensure his full effort. It was also true: the Industrial Department urgently needed these for modern manufacturing.

Indeed, Gao Ju fell silent, apparently weighing something. After a moment, as if reaching resolution, he said, "Since Little Brother requires them, Elder Brother will certainly assist. It's merely that gathering such quantities takes time. How long can Little Brother wait?"

"Fifteen days."

"Somewhat tight. I'll dispatch my managers to procure from multiple sources. We'll arrange it as best as possible! Where should goods be delivered? Still the same—"

"This requires Elder Brother's guidance." Xiao Zishan had another objective: establishing Guangzhou–Hainan transport lines. Future large-scale Guangzhou procurement would require suitable transshipment points. The city had too many eyes—moving bulk goods in and out was inconvenient. An external warehouse was needed.

He explained his requirements to Gao Ju. Gao Ju said this was easily arranged—he owned his own warehouse dock on Youyu Islet in the Pearl River estuary. That territory belonged to smuggler-fishermen, half-civilian and half-bandit types. Urban officials dared not enter; the place was practically a lawless zone. The transmigrators' ship could dock there. He would allocate a separate warehouse for goods transshipment.

"That works admirably." Xiao Zishan was satisfied with the arrangement. He added that their purchasing would be long-term—whatever quantities were available, they would buy all of it.

Business matters settled, Gao Ju inquired whether they had brought new Australian goods. Xiao Zishan merely smiled faintly. "Those are just small trinkets. Give it a few months—Elder Brother will see what we can truly produce."

This gave Gao Ju boundless room for imagination—but also stirred some unease. Personally, he felt no fear of the short-hair before him. But the shadowy, powerful force behind him was disquieting. These Australian merchants were definitely not mere merchants.

Xiao Zishan's next visit was to Sun Kecheng, manager of the Qiwei Escort Bureau. Escort bureaus possessed long-distance bulk transport capabilities—they would make excellent partners for establishing overland transport lines.

En route, Sun Chang had briefed him on the bureau's particulars. It was a network woven from family, clan, townsmen, and martial brotherhoods. From Chief Escort Sun Kecheng down to counter clerks and stable hands, all were relatives, fellow townsmen, or martial brothers. They exclusively ran the Guangzhou-to-Nanchang routes, plus provincial short-haul work. They maintained multiple branch offices along the way. By Guangdong standards, it was a middle-sized operation with connections everywhere. Xiao Zishan calculated: gaining control of this bureau would greatly benefit their Guangdong trade and intelligence operations.

Chief Escort Sun was pleased by the visit—these Australian merchants truly valued relationships. Xiao Zishan presented gifts, and the conversation proceeded pleasantly. He then inquired about the bureau's business.

Sun Kecheng sighed repeatedly, his expression darkening.

Escort work itself wasn't bad. But the routes grew increasingly unsafe. Bandits of the past had at least been "men of the trade," following underworld rules. These past two years, roving bandits and marauders dominated the highways—desperate peasants or unpaid deserting soldiers. Neither respected names nor honored rules. Seeing goods, they robbed; seeing people, they killed. Past bandits had only wanted valuables. Current marauders seized everything—goods, carts, and all.

With bandits rampant, villages and towns everywhere had built militias and erected strongholds. Passing through meant constant questioning and wariness. Outsider bureaus like theirs—if not for most of their brothers being Jiangxi natives with local connections—couldn't find food or lodging at all. Several forced convoys had succeeded without losing cargo, but more than ten brothers had been killed or wounded. The bureau staff had begun to feel their future was uncertain.

When Xiao Zishan proposed investing as shareholders while opening new routes, Sun Kecheng's jaw dropped. Since escort businesses began, bureaus had never been money-making ventures for investors. Brothers pooling resources was sufficient to open shop. Earnings came from physical labor and risking one's life. Year-round, everyone perhaps achieved modest comfort—significant dividends didn't exist. Nobody had ever invested money in bureaus before.

"No dividends required." Xiao Zishan proceeded to explain. "We're establishing businesses across the Ming realm. Shop operations and shipping inevitably arise. For land and water transport—nobody knows it better than you. This investment means, first, we won't take bureau dividends, and second, we won't interfere with internal affairs. Simply—wherever our businesses expand, your routes follow!"
