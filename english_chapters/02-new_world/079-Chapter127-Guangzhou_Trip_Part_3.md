# Chapter 127: Guangzhou Trip (Part 3)

Xiao Zishan ordered Sun Chang to prepare mule carts and sedan chairs to fetch the people from the dock. The others quickly cooked and cleaned, and the empty mansion suddenly bustled. Sun Chang said that mules and carts were no trouble—he just had to contact the Qiwei Escort Bureau. Escort bureaus, due to their convoy needs, typically ran mule and horse cart services as side businesses. Everything was ready-made.

While arranging the transportation, he also ordered sedan chairs to visit Gao Ju. En route, he asked Sun Chang about the developments of the past year. Sun Chang said that since their departure, Gao Ju had often sent people with gifts, asking about news of the Australian merchants. The neighborhood was peaceful, except for Liu Laoxiang's Pearl River estuary disturbances causing slight market jitters. There was nothing major. He knew little about official circles—only that some palace bigwig in Beijing had fallen and that Guangzhou's officialdom had seen some changes, but the details were unclear.

Xiao Zishan knew this "palace bigwig" was Wei Zhongxian. History in this timeline hadn't altered its trajectory: the all-powerful "Nine Thousand Years" had committed suicide last year on the sixth day of the eleventh lunar month at an inn in Fucheng County, Hebei. From last December through the first half of this year, the Chongzhen Emperor was vigorously pursuing the Wei faction remnants. Official shakeups were unsurprising. The transmigrators should thank this situation: with everyone panicking, no one had any attention to spare for some pirate incursion on Hainan.

Xiao Zishan's sudden visit brought Gao Ju both surprise and joy. Regarding the Wei Zhongxian shrine construction matter, having no good options, he'd used the strategy Manager Wen had taught: "stall." That manager had clearly said, "Within the month, there will be major changes." Indeed, Eunuch Yang had been stationed in Guangzhou, demanding daily progress. Gao Ju dared not delay too much, so he just prepared leisurely and dragged it out for about twenty days. Then Little Eunuch Yang suddenly came to bid farewell, ordering the shrine construction halted and hurriedly departing for Beijing with the prepared Australian goods. Gao Ju was flabbergasted. Another ten days later, he received correspondence from Beijing—only then learning that on May eighteenth, the Emperor had suddenly fallen seriously ill. This made Gao Ju not just amazed but literally chilled, with goosebumps rising.

"On the eighteenth of May, there will be changes in Beijing. Matters can be delayed." Those were Manager Wen's parting words. Comparing that to now, this already mysterious group of sea merchants seemed even more unfathomable. He urgently sent people to inquire: had anyone seen strange foreign mega-ships? There was no news. He resigned himself to waiting—they'd surely come find him; after all, 200,000 *liang* in payment remained here. He waited over a year, but there was still no word. Just when hope faded, this past month, he'd heard rumors: near Qiongzhou, an unprecedented giant ship had appeared. The crew were all short-haired and short-clothed—and extremely fierce. He secretly wondered: could this be the Australian merchants' ship? He was considering whether to send investigators when they arrived.

Gao Ju ordered welcome banquet preparations while exchanging pleasantries. He produced the sales ledgers—currently, there was 50,000 *liang* available; the remaining amounts could be gathered in ten or more days.

"The silver is not urgent—it can stay with Manager Gao for now." The transmigrators currently lacked materials more than silver. Xiao Zishan wasted no time, telling him this trip was for procurement. Given the diverse merchandise, he'd need Manager Gao's assistance. Gao Ju assumed it would be the usual porcelain, spices, and hardwoods, so he readily agreed. But upon opening the list, he was stunned. The items were completely unexpected: pig iron, graphite, fluorite, chalcanthite, alum, copperas, saltpeter, Glauber's salt, soda ash, sulfur, arsenic, realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, borite, gypite, tin, lead, copper, mercury...

Most of these Gao Ju didn't even recognize. Some he knew from workshop use, while others were simply medicinals. Saltpeter and sulfur were government controlled. Pig iron—10,000 *shi* right off—was manageable; it just required visiting more forges. But mercury—ten *shi*?! All the mercury in Guangzhou combined might not make one *shi*. What did they want this for? Had some Australian emperor died, needing mercury for embalming?

Lost in speculation, Xiao Zishan noticed his shifting expressions. "Are there any difficulties?"

"All findable." Gao Ju set down the list. "Just—aren't these quantities excessive? Take chalcanthite and mercury—the entire city might have one *shi*. Where would this much come from?"

"Then please trouble Elder Brother Gao. Whatever amount is available." Xiao Zishan didn't know what these were for, but specifically ordered items were surely essential.

"Since Little Brother entrusts Elder Brother, naturally I'll do my utmost." Gao Ju suddenly changed his address, lowering his voice. "However, several are contraband. Elder Brother isn't incapable—but everything needs reasons for proper handling."

Xiao Zishan was startled—he'd only known saltpeter and sulfur were possibly controlled. He hadn't considered the others. "Which are contraband?"

"Iron is prohibited from export, but that's manageable. Copper, arsenic, saltpeter, and sulfur are the trouble—especially given the quantities you want—"

"These are raw materials for Australian goods." Xiao Zishan had learned from Sun Chang that Gao Ju had made a fortune on Australian goods, becoming Guangzhou's "wealth legend." Using "raw materials for Australian goods" as an excuse, he'd exert full effort. It was also true: the Industrial Department urgently needed these for modern manufacturing.

Indeed, Gao Ju fell silent, seemingly weighing something. After a moment, as if resolved, he said, "Since Little Brother wants them, Elder Brother will definitely help. Just—gathering takes time. How long can Little Brother wait?"

"Fifteen days."

"Somewhat tight. I'll have my managers split up to procure. We will arrange it as best as possible! Where should goods be delivered? Still the same—"

"This requires Elder Brother's advice." Xiao Zishan's other objective was establishing Guangzhou–Hainan transport lines. Future large-scale Guangzhou procurement needed suitable transshipment points. There were too many eyes in the city—moving bulk goods in and out was inconvenient. An external warehouse was needed.

He explained the requirements to Gao Ju. Gao Ju said this was easy—he had his own warehouse dock on Youyu Islet in the Pearl River estuary. That was smuggler-fishermen's territory—half civilian, half bandit types. Urban officials dared not enter—it was practically a lawless zone. The transmigrators' ship could dock there. He'd allocate a separate warehouse for goods transshipment.

"That works well." Xiao Zishan was satisfied with this arrangement. He added: their purchasing was long-term—whatever amounts were available, they'd buy all.

After settling matters, Gao Ju asked if they'd brought new Australian goods. Xiao Zishan just smiled faintly. "Those are just small trinkets. Give it a few months—Elder Brother will see."

This gave Gao Ju boundless imagination—but also some fear. Personally, he didn't fear this short-hair before him. But the shadowy and powerful force behind him made him uneasy. These Australian merchants were definitely not just merchants.

Xiao Zishan's next visit was to the manager of the Qiwei Escort Bureau, Sun Kecheng. Escort bureaus had long-distance bulk transport capabilities—they were excellent partners for establishing overland transport lines.

En route, Sun Wei had already briefed him on the bureau's details. This was a network of family, clan, fellow townsmen, and martial brotherhoods. From Chief Escort Sun Kecheng down to the counter clerks and stable hands, all were relatives, townsmen, or martial brothers. They exclusively ran Guangzhou to Nanchang routes, plus provincial short hauls. There were multiple branch offices along the way. It was middle-sized by Guangdong standards and had connections everywhere. Xiao Zishan calculated: gaining control of this bureau would greatly benefit Guangdong trade and intelligence operations.

Chief Escort Sun was pleased by his visit—these Australian merchants truly valued relationships. Xiao Zishan presented gifts, and the conversation was pleasant. He then inquired about the bureau's business.

Sun Kecheng sighed repeatedly, his expression darkening.

Escort work itself wasn't bad. But the routes grew increasingly unsafe. Past bandits were at least "men of the trade," following underworld rules. These past two years, roving bandits and marauders dominated—desperate peasants or unpaid deserting soldiers. Neither respected names nor rules—seeing goods, they robbed; seeing people, they killed. Past bandits only wanted valuables. The current marauders took everything—goods, carts, and all.

With bandits rampant, villages and towns everywhere built militias and established strongholds. Passing through meant constant questioning and wariness. Outsider bureaus like theirs—if not for most brothers being Jiangxi natives with local connections—couldn't even find food and lodging. Several forced convoys succeeded without losing cargo, but more than ten brothers had died or were wounded. The bureau staff felt their future was uncertain.

When Xiao Zishan proposed investing as shareholders while opening new routes, Sun Kecheng's jaw dropped. Since escort businesses began, bureaus weren't money-making ventures. Brothers pooling resources was enough to open shop. Earnings came from physical labor and risking lives. Year-round, everyone maybe achieved modest comfort—significant dividends didn't exist. Nobody had ever invested money in bureaus.

"No dividends needed." Xiao Zishan then explained, "We're establishing businesses across the Ming. Shop operations and shipping inevitably arise. For land and water transport—nobody knows it better than you. This investment means, first, we don't take bureau dividends, and second, we don't interfere with internal affairs. Just—wherever our businesses expand, your routes follow!"
