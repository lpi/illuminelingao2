# Chapter 65: Road Building (Part 2)

After revising the road-building plan, the overall pace accelerated considerably. Wang Luobin kept his word. Through the personnel database, the Committee summoned everyone with tractor, construction machinery, or heavy truck experience. Bai Yu, the former tank soldier who had been preparing to convert tractors into tanks and farm vehicles into infantry fighting vehicles to become the father of the Transmigrators' armored corps, was once again ruthlessly conscripted and sent to the engineering team.

Mei Wan personally took the field, touring the site while teaching the new road-building workers how to use tools and do earthwork. Pitifully, most city-bred homebodies could not even hold a shovel properly. Asked to dig soil, trench, or level ground—not one did it right.

After teaching for a while, he checked the machinery operations. Though machine operators were not very skilled either, at least they could work—fortunately, the Committee had arranged training before the crossing.

*Good thing we have construction machinery,* Mei Wan thought thankfully. Otherwise, he could not imagine what the so-called construction crew would produce. During his inspection, he suddenly noticed one person working properly. After years as a project manager on construction sites, he could instantly tell amateurs from professionals. The young man looked sturdy—just a bit lazy and slow. Mei Wan walked over:

"Nice work. You have been on construction sites?"

"I have. I have done lots of jobs." The young man paused. "You are Manager Mei, right?" Mei Wan had been a project manager for a construction crew, so everyone called him that.

"That is right. You know me?" Mei Wan was surprised—he did not recognize this person.

"Recognizing leaders quickly is a basic skill for us working stiffs." The young man laughed. "When you see a boss coming, you have got to hustle..."

Mei Wan laughed. "What is your name?"

"Tan Ming. Everyone calls me Fat Ming." Tan Ming resumed working. "I have not only worked construction—I have been a security guard, oil worker, online game gold farmer, printer..."

"How did a printer end up here?"

"Well, I am getting old and never made it big. Economy is bad now—lost my job again. Figured since I was not going anywhere, might as well try somewhere else."

Mei Wan completed his rounds and returned to the tent. He was reasonably satisfied with overall progress. Crew chief Bing Feng came into the tent to report: the kitchen crew had just delivered a one-ton water tank and salt had been allocated.

"Still no hard hats?" Mei Wan asked.

"Commissioner Wang said he sent people this morning to cut willow branches. They are prototyping now."

"Good. Not having them for now is not too critical—not much hoisting work." He thought for a moment. "Right, there is a guy named Tan Ming in the crew—worked construction sites before, very skilled. Assign him as a team leader first; see what he is capable of. If he works out, we will train him as a foreman."

"Will do—I will arrange it now." Bing Feng was about to leave when Mei Wan stopped him. "From now on, keep an eye out for these things yourself. Find promising people and develop them. You are a structural engineer and deputy group leader—you cannot always be a foreman on-site. Is that not a waste?"

Bing Feng was somewhat confused, not quite understanding what that meant. He mumbled something and left.

Mei Wan lit a cigarette, his mind troubled. His thoughts should all be on this highway, but yesterday's meeting scene kept replaying. He had not expected the always-low-profile Zhuo Tianmin to make that move. *That was grandstanding.* Mei Wan thought bitterly: Zhuo Tianmin's architect and consultant certifications were probably very interesting to the Committee...

For a moment, he felt crisis all around. Originally, he had been quite satisfied with his Building Engineering Group lineup. Bing Feng, the deputy, was a structural engineer—quite specialized. Xiao Yan was a generalist—broad but not deep. Li Xiaolu had strong technical skills but was a woman, with a face that looked uninterested in everything.

But now things were different. Though he believed his management and coordination experience in civil engineering was rich, in terms of professional standards, he was clearly no match for this man.

Lost in thought, the walkie-talkie reported: Section 1's three-kilometer road-base work was complete; the paving team needed to enter—but road-surface material had not been determined. Mei Wan grabbed a notebook and a small shovel, left the tent, and walked along the soil-collection ditch, constantly shoveling up soil, examining it visually, pinching and rubbing it. Then noting something in his notebook. Meter after meter. This bewildered Yan Quezhi, who was measuring Wenlan River hydrological data.

"Manager Mei, what are you looking for?"

"Soil quality." Mei Wan casually crumbled the soil in his hand. "Looking for soil suitable for road surfacing."

"Cannot you use all this excavated soil? The road-base was filled the same way."

"Road-base soil requirements are simpler than road-surface." Mei Wan explained that soil could be classified by particle size into clay, sand, and silt. Natural soil was usually a mix of all three; depending on proportions, there were nine subtypes, each with different road-surface characteristics. Some were very suitable; some could not be used at all; some needed modification.

"Simple highways have dirt surfaces—many disadvantages compared to common hardened surfaces: more dust, less load capacity, surfaces soften in rain creating muddy potholes..." he said. "So selecting and processing surface soil is crucial. Done right, these problems are reduced."

"Take sandy soil, for instance—there is lots along the river here." He shoveled some. "This soil is almost all sand grains, low cohesion. Dry, it is loose and formless; wet, it will not hold shape. A road surface of this would easily develop deep ruts in dry weather. In rain, it has weak cohesion. The advantage is it dries quickly—but it needs clay mixed in for modification before use."

"And this?" Yan Quezhi was very interested. Seeing different soil nearby, he immediately grabbed some. "By that logic, this clay-sand mix should be ideal for roads."

"Theoretically yes, but practice is not that simple. Different soil proportions have different characteristics." Mei Wan took the soil, examined it, then rolled it. It formed thin, short tubes. "What you brought is fine sandy loam. It has both clay and considerable fine sand, so some cohesion. This type is relatively suitable for road surface."

"So we use this?"

"What I am looking for is sandy loam—" Mei Wan brushed off his hands. "Similar to this, but with coarser sand grains. Road surface with this soil, once compacted, maintains density, does not easily loosen, produces less dust when driving, does not stick to tires in rain, dries quickly afterward, and is easy to maintain flat."

"But how can you tell? Fine or coarse sand—can you see that?" Yan Quezhi stared at the soil for a long time.

"You can tell if you look carefully." Mei Wan continued instructing. "A simple test: roll it by hand. Fine sandy loam like yours can be rolled into thin short tubes; sandy loam cannot be rolled."

"I see." Yan Quezhi was now in complete admiration. "Very professional!"

"Haha." Mei Wan laughed proudly. "Not at all." Thinking: *Old textbooks are really powerful.*

Soon, Mei Wan and Yan Quezhi discovered a sandy loam extraction site. If such ideal material was not found, Mei Wan could also modify soil based on conditions—but that meant extra steps and much more labor.

Road-surface spreading was personally directed by Mei Wan. Simple highways had light traffic—no need for thick surfaces. Fifteen-centimeter thickness with two or three roller compactions was essentially done. The surface was slightly crowned in the center for drainage.

To increase surface strength, the crew mixed some pebbles into the surface soil. Since suitable stones were limited, the effect could not match a true gravel road. In other words, vehicles should not drive in rain.

"Rush, rush, rush this half-assed thing out." Mei Wan looked at the completed section, dropped his cigarette butt, and stomped it viciously.

---

Just past the first night watch, the county yamen courtyard was very quiet. Only two night-duty runners carried small white-paper lanterns, walking through the compound at intervals, striking wooden clappers.

A dozen or so militia sat or lay in the courtyard. Normally, these muddy-footed peasants would not be allowed such liberties in official precincts—but with city defense so tight, and these militia having fought pirates just yesterday, the runners turned a blind eye.

Leading the militia was Huang Shoutong, head household of Namei Village—around fifty, burly and vigorous. His short beard was graying; brows broad, forehead high; eyes flashing like lightning when he opened them. He was one of the county's major grain-producing landlords. His ancestors had followed armies at the dynasty's founding and settled in Lingao; some ancestors had passed the scholar examinations and converted to civilian status, prospering the clan. Known for generosity and righteousness, he commanded respect in his village and clan.

Lingao had always suffered pirate raids; local peace was never guaranteed. Since the Jiajing era's defense against *wokou*, his ancestors had built earthen fortifications in Namei Village and trained militia. It was one of Lingao's famous "hard territories." By his generation, Namei Village led a mutual-defense alliance of six neighboring villages—able to mobilize five or six hundred militia at any time. In recent unsettled years, whenever troops attacked bandits or defended the county, Huang Shoutong led his militia, contributing greatly and earning Magistrate Wu's commendation.

Huang Shoutong had no scholar status, but one son was a county-school student. When gentry were summoned for the meeting, he had been arranging village defenses—only sending his scholar son to attend. He had also dispatched a dozen militia with a cart of grain and vegetables to assist in city defense. Now this old man suddenly arriving—Wu Mingjin was both surprised and pleased. After they sat in the reception hall with brief pleasantries, Wu Mingjin noticed the old man's headband had been changed to white, eyes bloodshot. Greatly puzzled—he knew Huang's parents had both passed away. Had his old wife newly died?

Seeing the magistrate's puzzlement, Huang Shoutong explained: one of his sons had died in action yesterday, attacking pirates.
