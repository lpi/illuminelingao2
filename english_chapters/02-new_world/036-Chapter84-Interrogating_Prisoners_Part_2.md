# Chapter 84: Interrogating Prisoners (Part 2)

"This humble one is named Zhang Xingjiao, formerly a *tongsheng*." The man knelt on the ground, trembling. Guo Yi and his team were not applying their equality ideals to these prisoners—unequal pressure actually worked in their favor.

"*Tongsheng*?" Mu Min frowned. "Virgin? He practices celibacy kungfu?"

Xiong Buyou nearly burst out laughing. "*Tongsheng*—a scholar who hasn't passed the *xiucai* exam."

Looking carefully, though he wore rags and had dark skin, his hands and feet were not rough—not a hardship-born laborer.

Zhang Xingjiao, seeing their faint smiles, sighed self-deprecatingly. "This humble one failed at studies—a joke to you gentlemen. My family are natives here, farmers for generations, with a few inherited *mu* of land. Our village has a major surname Gou; since their clan produced several rich households and they could speak to government clerks, they lorded it over the village. My father, unable to stand it, supported my studies, hoping I'd pass the exams and protect our household from their bullying. But I'm useless—could never pass."

Apparently ashamed, his face reddened. "Studies cost money. The family sold off a few *mu*. Finances were already tight when our ox suddenly died. Everyone said the Gou family did it—but we had no proof and no power to sue. Father, furious and worried, fell gravely ill. Farming families have no savings. Desperate, we sold our remaining four *mu* by contract. Could've gotten more money, but the Gou family, using their connections with government clerks, blocked other families from buying, forcing the price down to less than half normal value..."

"Forced sale." Mu Min nodded sympathetically.

"Land sold, but when Father learned, his rage worsened. A few months later, money gone, he died too—" Zhang Xingjiao wiped tears. "And that's not all. The Gou family, evil-hearted, conspired with the tax-managing clerk to never transfer the land's tax burden. Though we'd sold, we still had to pay summer and autumn grain taxes on those four *mu*. How can such injustice exist?"

*This happens?* Everyone was shocked. In mid-to-late Ming, this was actually common: property transferred, tax burden stays—buyers paid no taxes. It often drove peasants who had lost land into exile.

"These years, court taxes have been heavy—plus the Liaodong surcharge. This tortures small households like us! I asked the buyer why the tax wasn't transferred—the contract clearly says so. The Gou family head said he'd already spoken to tax clerks; it wasn't his business if the transfer didn't happen. I made several trips to the city—only to be scolded as a troublemaker."

The tent fell silent. Prisoners sitting on the ground waiting to be processed were deeply moved. Most had similar grievances. Hearing his tragedy, some silently wept; others bit their lips, remembering their own suffering, hearts burning with injustice.

"Though land was sold, they still demanded grain taxes. When deadlines came, yamen runners came with warrants, clubs, chains, handcuffs—like wolves. Into the house, beating without question, smashing pots and bowls, dragging me to the county for interrogation. Every three days, another beating until I was flayed raw, then cangued in public display... I was nearly dead. Fortunately, classmates from my study days—some studying at the county school—begged the instructors to intercede, barely saving my life. Back home, the Gou family conspired with runners, claiming to have paid my taxes, using fake contracts to seize our remaining home plot and ancestral graveyard. My family's ancestral graves for generations—all dug up..." At this, he kowtowed to the ground, wailing.

This time going to battle, the village's wealthy families—seeing he had nothing left, no family or property—figured his death would not matter. They tied him with three others and sent them to the city as militia. He had been in the Bopu attack column; being weak and slow, he had been captured.

They questioned several more volunteers—all with similar stories. All people driven beyond endurance by wealthy households and officials. Everyone had blood feuds. All listeners were sympathetic.

"We should raise this with the Committee." Mu Min wiped her reddened eyes. "The common people are suffering too much—land reform is essential!"

Guo Yi was sympathetic too, but had no interest in land reform. He expressed sympathy for Mu Min's sighs—lest he seem cold-blooded—but said not a word about land reform. *Who knows what leadership thinks!* New arrivals must speak cautiously. But from this, he had conceived an idea. Combined with what he had heard from Shao Zong about last night's post-battle review content, he thought it had good chances of adoption.

"Strike big households?" Wen Desi looked at Xiao Zishan with some surprise.

"Mm." Xiao Zishan nodded. "Precisely, strike local tyrants and evil gentry."

"Zishan, we discussed this—no land reform stuff."

"We're not doing land reform—just striking big households. Plainly speaking, 'dispensing justice on Heaven's behalf'—robbing the rich to help the poor." Xiao Zishan produced several pages. "This is Guo Yi's proposal and materials from prisoner interrogations. Using interrogation data, we strike households with public grievances. One, to win hearts and warn local diehards not to resist us. Two, to obtain large quantities of grain and supplies."

These pages recorded details of notorious wealthy households from prisoner testimony: population, defenses, land, property—extremely detailed. Some entries even listed how many pigs and cattle, where gold and silver might be hidden. A meticulous robbery guide. Following it, transmigrators could easily make fortunes.

Naturally, "robbing the rich to help the poor" historically mainly meant helping one's own poor. But for commoners, this held immense appeal. Though they gained little materially, overturning the daily oppressive order and bringing high-and-mighty people crashing down held tremendous allure.

The Committee discussed. This proposal won strong support from progressives. For moderates, the original "Hunting" plan had randomly sought targets—potentially killing wrong people, harming wrong interests, creating future administrative problems. This proposal gave "Hunting" clear targets, combined with slogans that could attract and inspire commoners: "Eliminating evil, protecting good; robbing the rich, helping the poor." The finishing touch. Both sides were satisfied. Comrade Guo Yi earned new respect.

"We really do need to hit some big households to replenish supplies." Wu Nanhai, as Agriculture and Cafeteria Director, lowered his voice. "I've been meaning to raise the grain issue."

He opened a notebook. "Our grain reserves were planned at one kilogram per person per day for sixty continuous days—35 tons of rice and flour total. After D-Day, most people actually received 600–800g daily rations, since we could provide considerable protein and fat—canned goods, instant foods, fish—reducing carbohydrate needs. Daily grain consumption was 350kg, so reserves lasted longer than expected—about fifteen extra days. But this doesn't include prisoners.

"Wu De reported today: 138 prisoners. At 300g per person daily—and if they're doing heavy labor, this ration is actually insufficient—starting tomorrow that's forty extra kilograms daily. Not a small number. We must quickly develop food sources."

"What about our own crop-planting plans?" Xiao Zishan knew Wu Nanhai's Agriculture Group had brought countless modern agricultural essentials.

"Before, no manpower. Now with more prisoners, it's manageable. 21st-century Hainan can triple-crop annually. But during the Little Ice Age, I don't know how cold Hainan gets—must ask prisoners before deciding what to plant."

"Ming-era Hainan even had snow, I recall."

"That should be exceptional. But temperatures several degrees lower is certain. Double-cropping at least. I hope for more prisoners—frankly, I don't trust the homebodies to farm..."

Xiao Zishan noted his request.

"Also salt—we need a source or self-production soon. Agriculture Group has one ton of salt—sufficient for now, but we're making many preserved foods, consuming fast. Other departments request from Agriculture Group—puts me in a difficult position."

"Salt shouldn't be hard, right? Hainan, if I recall, was one of China's earliest large-scale solar-salt producers. Many salt fields along the Beibu Gulf and Qiongzhou Strait."

"We need to build a salt field soon."

"Easy." Wang Luobin was confident. "As a kid in Guangxi, I often visited coastal salt fields—know how to solar-evaporate salt." He frowned. "But salt production is hard, labor-intensive work. With mechanization, fine; with manual labor, current workforce isn't enough."

"No need to bother—we can raid for it..." Yu Eshui opened a book. "According to county annals, Ma'ao Peninsula—not far from us—has a government salt field. Should have enough salt for our needs."

"Let's raid for salt. Chemistry Department needs it badly. We'll allocate manpower."

"Let's sort out which projects need fulfillment first. Then discuss manpower allocation."
