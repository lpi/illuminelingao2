# Chapter 138: East Gate Market Police Station (Part 3)

Before arriving, Zhou Shizhai had assumed these people, like Guangzhou's foreign merchants, simply wanted protection for their mansions and treasures.

Upon landing, he knew he was completely wrong. Bopu's giant ship, smooth roads, four-wheeled horseless carts... the unexpected sights kept coming, one after another. When he saw the massive construction scale of Bairren Fortress, he felt genuine panic for the first time.

Were they really just sea merchants? Zhou Shizhai now understood with perfect clarity: this place needed no escort to protect its property. Just the ships anchored in Bopu Harbor alone—what force in these waters could possibly match them?

So why had they summoned him?

He and his two disciples were temporarily housed in a small building belonging to the East Gate Industrial-Commercial Bureau. The rooms weren't large—cramped, actually—but they were comfortably furnished, though the furniture had obviously been cobbled together. He had one room to himself; the two disciples shared another. That evening, the merchant leaders—one named Dongmen, one Dugu, plus a woman—hosted a dinner. The food was simple but practical: fish, meat, vegetables. The leaders were courteous. Through conversation, he learned this was a newly opened market; with increased traffic, things had become chaotic.

"—Though we've recruited some police, we understand nothing about Ming's underworld environment." Dongmen Chuiyu courteously offered a toast. "Please guide us, Master Zhou!"

"I'll do my utmost!" Zhou Shizhai drained his cup. "Just—may I ask the masters—and, ah, the lady?"

Mu Min waved dismissively. "No 'masters' or 'ladies.' Just call us 'comrades.'"

"We're definitely not comrades! Get that straight!" Dugu jumped up.

"I meant 'comrade' in the original sense. Don't pollute the word with your garbage colonial culture!" Mu Min was righteously indignant.

Zhou Shizhai took note: this woman was clearly the local boss. She must have been overseas for a long time—even adopting barbarian ways. He felt a slight disdain.

"May I ask, comrades," Zhou Shizhai said, "exactly what do you want this market to become?"

What style did they want? The transmigrators exchanged glances. Obviously, the more prosperous and bustling the better.

Zhou Shizhai shook his head. "This market's masters are you sea merchants, correct? I don't understand how to make markets prosperous—but once prosperity comes, various characters will naturally arrive seeking their share. How do you plan to coexist with them?"

"How can others sleep soundly beside one's own bed!" Dugu Qiuhun said decisively.

Zhou Shizhai was silent for a moment, then spoke: "Comrades, East Gate Market is currently a wild market with few shops. Even attracting petty thieves isn't particularly concerning. But once it becomes prosperous, the various factions that arrive will all have major backers. Even the street beggars will have connections reaching to heaven. One misstep and your place gets turned upside-down..."

Mu Min smiled faintly. "Master Zhou, we understand all of this. But our first advantage here is that we have no entanglements. Nobody is 'our people.' Power flows from gun barrels. Whoever's connections—if they cause trouble—" She made a slashing gesture, her expression murderous.

Zhou Shizhai nodded. "Understood. I will serve with my full effort!"

The merchants of East Gate Market suddenly noticed something new: at the main crossroads, a screen wall was being built. Craftsmen were chiseling something onto one wall—this was the new *Treatment Regulations*. The document essentially combined the *Public Security Management Punishment Regulations* with the *Ming Code*, with one main difference: detention, paddling, and exile had all been replaced with labor reform, minimum one year. Labor reform required no judicial process—the station chief's document sufficed. This proved excellent for suppressing security crimes. Various departments welcomed this free labor policy. Some democrats questioned whether punishment without trial violated judicial fairness. But fairness for natives clearly concerned few transmigrators.

Before the screen wall stood a three-tiered semicircular platform—the public sentencing stage. Public trials and sentencing had been proletarian dictatorship's most effective deterrence. This tradition could continue. Dugu Qiuhun eagerly wanted a guillotine placed at the crossroads, but death sentences belonged to state judicial authority. Transmigrators openly usurping court authority seemed premature. Besides, this was just a market.

Alongside the screen wall appeared strange-looking people: rattan helmets, short-hair-style black button-front stand-collar jackets with wooden buttons, wide leather belts, white puttees, and straw sandals. Short horizontal-handled clubs hung at their rears. Their sleeve patches bore shield-shaped embroidery with incomprehensible patterns—only a few characters were readable: "Security" at the top, "East Gate" at the bottom.

"Damn—these look exactly like Annam constables!" Dugu Qiuhun, seeing the delivered uniforms and equipment, let out a despairing wail. His own uniform design had been handsome: peaked caps, black turndown-collar tunics, leather Sam Browne belts, riding breeches, boots, plus chest badges—somehow feeling familiar already.

"Commissioner Xiao—my submitted uniform design wasn't like this! How can such rustic looks intimidate criminals?" Dugu phoned Xiao Zishan.

"Didn't you just want police looking like the SS? Unacceptable!"

"Pre-plagiarizing Hitler's ideas should be fine, shouldn't it? It's 1628—Hitler's still atoms!"

"Riding boots and Sam Browne belts? In Hainan? Too wasteful. Resources are tight—economize. Red Guard members just wore armbands for the revolution—never heard of needing full uniforms for fighting."

The hard faction suffered its first heavy blow. But other hard factions also seriously questioned Xiao Zishan's aesthetics.

The police squad's first appearance at East Gate attracted massive crowds. Though nobody knew what "police" meant, the commoners quickly guessed the answer: the short-hairs' "fast squad"! But these fast squads differed from yamen runners in two key ways. First, their movements were uniform—they patrolled the streets on a regular schedule. East Gate Market wasn't large; you'd see them frequently. Second, their jurisdiction was broad—"street dogs" who managed everything. Even littering or trade disputes that grew slightly loud would draw their immediate intervention.

These ten police officers formed the "uniform squad." Beyond them, Zhou Shizhai led his two disciples plus two or three recruited laborers as the "plainclothes squad"—scattered throughout the market daily, covertly monitoring situations.

Dongmen Chuiyu had originally proposed merchant group defense—organizing shop assistants for night patrols. But here, traveling merchants dominated; settled shopkeepers were few. With only a handful of storefronts, there was no one to organize. However, traditional security methods were still applied.

Inns were required to enforce guest registration. Daily, innkeepers reported to the station regarding any suspicious circumstances.

Ma Peng's mother even contributed to East Gate's security: as a simplified form of group defense, she and several elderly laborer wives were assigned to set up stalls throughout the market as covert sentries. Several clerks from the Welfare Society's Li Mei also joined this "group defense" in exchange for extra grain. As Mu Min's mother-in-law, Li Mei enthusiastically supported the plan—expenses came from the Welfare Society.

With everything in place, the 1628 Security Crackdown, jointly conducted by the Industrial-Commercial Bureau and Police Station, officially commenced. Not just the police squad and enforcement team participated—the Military Group, Security Group, and Bairren Commune Militia all joined in. First they established perimeter blockades, then teams conducted large-scale dragnet arrests based on the plainclothes squad's prior reconnaissance. Mu Min's requirements were clear: action must be fast and quiet, with minimal disturbance to uninvolved persons.

From the Industrial-Commercial Bureau's rooftop, a massive voice broadcast continuously in various dialects and Mandarin:

"Citizens, listen: this market is now arresting criminals. We won't release a single criminal; we won't wrongly arrest a single good person... Everyone remain in place... No resistance—violators will be shot without question..."

Squads wearing Year-One rattan helmets and wielding Year-One batons or bayonet-mounted rifles patrolled the market under the loudspeaker's blaring, arresting people according to name lists and photos. Those who resisted or fled were beaten bloody. Several self-proclaimed agile fighters—after downing several police officers—were finally bayoneted to death. Arrestees were all bound with rope and forced to squat before the station, forbidden to look up or talk. The newly minted police recruits happily strutted their authority over them.

Those arrested were mainly various petty thieves—pickpockets, burglars, con men, fences. After brief public sentencing, all received one year of labor reform. Wu De led several armed soldiers to march them away—the Bairren Beach quarry needed convict labor.

Gambling had severely impacted security, so the station initially banned gambling altogether. All gambling stalls at East Gate were shut down, money was confiscated, and operators were expelled. Before expulsion, per procedure, their confessions were recorded, fingerprints taken, guarantees signed, and photographs taken with placards—all creating case files.

"Come gambling again and it won't be so cheap next time! Scram!" Dugu Qiuhun snarled viciously, one foot propped on a stool. The operators were already terrified; the camera flash made them think they'd been hexed.

Throughout the operation, loudspeakers continuously broadcast the *Notice on Rectifying the East Gate Market Security Environment*: besides the gambling ban, related small pawnshops and usury lenders were also ordered to leave. Those who continued would face severe punishment. Prostitutes were required to register at the station within a deadline—unregistered ones would be expelled...

Prostitution survived. The market's prostitutes were mostly itinerant or nearby "half-door" types who operated covertly. Theft from clients occurred, but considering Lingao's extreme gender imbalance, this industry was tolerable. After discussion with the Civil Affairs and Medical departments, it was decided that prostitute licenses would be issued. All prostitutes were required to register for licenses. Unlicensed prostitution would result in expulsion for the first offense; a second offense meant labor reform. Civil Affairs had originally wanted monthly health checks by Medical, but Medical lacked the personnel, equipment, and drugs. This was temporarily left unimplemented.

The entire operation proceeded methodically, impressing Zhou Shizhai deeply. These "Australian comrades" might not understand the underworld, but their methods far exceeded those of any yamen office. It wasn't just the clean, efficient action—everything had been prepared in advance. Their punishments balanced severity with leniency. Compared to the dark, corrupt, cruel yamens, there was simply no comparison.

Such a small East Gate Market, handled this well—what if they governed all of Lingao? All of Guangzhou? Zhou Shizhai shook his head. Too absurd a thought.
