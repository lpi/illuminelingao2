# Chapter 184: Discussing Institutional Improvements

Wen Desi returned. He had planned to stay until the ship was completed, but hearing about the attack on Bopu, he hurried back on a supply transport.

Seeing the results, Wen Desi felt rather pleased that the formation training had been worthwhile. Though formation, line, and column tactics were primarily determined by weapon capabilities, the effects had been so good that Xi Yazhou, who had first proposed this approach, was walking on air. This experience deserved wider promotion.

A Beijing 212 was sent from Bairen to pick him up. Ma Qianzhu also hitched a ride back.

En route, they had deep discussions about the lessons learned from the battle. Though Wen Desi also worried about the military's growing independence, both agreed that expansion was urgent.

"If they'd come in two columns—one by sea, one by land—with twenty large ships and two or three thousand ground troops, this fight wouldn't have been so easy."

"Fortunately, our earlier transmigrator military training was thorough. The main force and backbone were almost all transmigrators."

"You want to be Archangel, don't you!" Ma Qianzhu knew Wen Desi's aspirations well. "Absolutely not!"

Wen Desi smiled helplessly. "I know nobody will agree. Let me talk about military political-ideological issues."

"Go ahead."

"If a man soldiers for a meal ticket versus soldiering for survival and advancement—the fundamental purpose determines initiative." Wen Desi said. "Most of our New Army came for meals. They think this is like working for a kind landlord—good food, good clothes, and that's it. They won't die for a good meal."

"There's also housing and land—"

"Right, but for them it's just pie in the sky." Wen Desi said. "I think soldiers from the Commune should be much more committed because they know we keep our word. New recruits from outside? Hard to say."

"High pay? I oppose that. We're already generous. Once soldiers fight for money, no money means they won't fight."

"Doesn't have to be salary increases. Could be bonuses." Wen Desi gripped the vehicle handle. "Director, after such a victory, shouldn't there be some reward? I heard yesterday's daytime battle, the soldiers just got one horse-meat meal?"

"Infantry didn't really fight. A dozen artillery rounds won it."

"But they formed up and charged, didn't they? Besides, transmigrators contributed enormously in both battles. If the Executive Committee shows no appreciation, won't people feel slighted?"

This was indeed an oversight. Ma Qianzhu had planned to use this opportunity for honor awards, commendations, maybe even medals. But money and transmigrator rewards had not been considered. Now he suddenly realized: transmigrators are people too!

This realization made him smile bitterly. Apparently, becoming a leader makes you forget many things. This time, Dugu Qiuhun, Wang Ruixiang, Lin Shenhe, and others had contributed greatly. Without some gesture, it would definitely be disheartening.

"You're right. But I have reservations about bonuses."

"Bonuses don't have to be money. Cigarettes, cola, and such for us. Rice, salt, cloth for natives."

Ma Qianzhu nodded. This could be considered.

"Military technological advantage is insufficient." With New Army losses so heavy, fighting regulars later would bankrupt them.

"If we had machine guns and explosive shells, we'd be much stronger." Wen Desi said. "But we won on institutions—"

"Hell, you're an institutionalist too?"

"Call me that. Obviously, institutionally, we're superior to any military in this spacetime." Wen Desi stretched. "Left early. Going back for a nap. Not even a secretary to hold."

"My two concerns," Ma Qianzhu said, "are: first, expansion affecting production, consuming too much labor; second, military control issues."

"I've thought about this too." Wen Desi said. "Director, what's your view?"

"Establish an internal affairs department, expand Internal Security forces, balance the military."

"This approach is meaningless for the current military." Wen Desi pointed out. "If Internal Security expands too fast, the message is too obvious. Officers aren't stupid."

"Your idea?"

"I think we're not at the point of needing balance. The key is establishing institutions, then strictly enforcing them. Then nobody can complain about being targeted." Wen Desi thought. "Rule of law is essential. We can't use power-scheming mentality—that leads to endless later problems. For example, current weapons and ammunition management is too loose. Though most weapons are centralized, checking out guns is too easy. We need weapons allocation—which department gets how many guns, how much ammunition, all properly assigned with personal accountability. Ammunition must be strictly centrally stored."

"Troop mobilization, deployment, transfer authority—"

"Exactly. Whatever kind of state we become, *********** is definitely something nobody wants to see. So start now establishing regulations and habits of doing things by the rules. This is troublesome but most essential." Even as he spoke, Wen Desi felt some regret. He actually preferred dystopian states, but with so many strong personalities in this group, better not to try.

Wen Desi continued: "About expansion, though necessary, I worry too much will affect production. Can we reduce each batch size?"

"Plan is 1,000 in three months. Not high. Actually, don't worry: the military can support production."

Wen Desi laughed. "Right! Production support also builds fitness."

The Security Team was busy again today. Yesterday's two battles had captured several hundred prisoners. The massive screening and interrogation workload was overwhelming Ran Yao. He quickly recalled Mu Min and recruited dialect translators from everywhere. Zhou Dongtian also returned to serve the Security Team.

Today formal work finally began. The first batch of selected prisoners was brought to the Security Team office.

The Security Team office had also upgraded. Originally in the Executive Committee compound inside Bairen, the Executive Committee had complained about their lights burning all night, occasional screaming, and some caring individuals' protests. Also, bringing "unpurified" locals inside the fortress was not appropriate. So during the construction boom, Security had moved outside the fortress, building a compound at the former prisoner detention camp site. Outside: barbed wire, trenches, watchtowers. Inside: a two-story building housing various offices. To the left, a separate courtyard—the prison.

The interrogation room was in the prison courtyard's main building. Windows deliberately covered with black cloth created a dark-room effect. Inside, though, there were no Qing-dynasty torture implements—just a chair with handcuffs and leg irons, some tables, and a desk lamp.

Yesterday's daytime prisoners had been preliminarily processed. Not much value. All were temps. Even the most senior could not explain much, just insisted Zhu Cailao had sent them. But the Executive Committee clearly did not believe this. Last night's prisoners were much more complex. Though under fifty men, they included Chinese, Southeast Asian natives, some who looked Indian, and two curly-haired, deep-eyed, pale-skinned obvious foreigners.

This troubled Ran Yao. The spacetime's various dialects were already headache-inducing. Now these additions. Foreigners he could handle—transmigrators who spoke English, Spanish, and such could be found. But what language did Indians and Southeast Asian natives speak?

After much thought, he decided to start with Chinese pirates.

Prisoner screening started with clothing. Ragged, malnourished faces definitely were not leaders. So first to be interrogated were the best-dressed and healthiest-looking.

Outside the interrogation room stood several cudgel-carrying police under Dugu Qiuhun—temporarily borrowed. Also some soldiers with bayoneted rifles. Dugu Qiuhun had become famous from the Bopu battle. Pirates feared him. Seeing this demon with machete grinning as he inspected each of them, the rope-bound pirates waiting in the courtyard felt their necks go cold.

Inside, Ran Yao conducted questioning personally. Three translators were present, speaking Cantonese official dialect, Lingao dialect, and Hokkien.

After arranging guards, Dugu Qiuhun also suited up completely.
