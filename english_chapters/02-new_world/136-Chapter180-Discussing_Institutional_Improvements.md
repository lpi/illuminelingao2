# Chapter 180: Discussing Institutional Improvements

Wen Desi had intended to remain at the shipyard until the vessel was completed, but news of the attack on Bopu changed his plans. He caught the first supply transport back.

Upon reviewing the battle's results, he found himself genuinely pleased. The formation training had proven its worth. Though such tactics—formations, lines, and columns—were ultimately dictated by weapon capabilities, the effectiveness had exceeded expectations. Xi Yazhou, who had first championed this approach, was practically floating with vindication. The experience warranted broader application throughout their forces.

A Beijing 212 was dispatched from Bairen to collect him, and Ma Qianzhu caught a ride back as well.

During the journey, the two men fell into deep discussion about the battle's lessons. Though Wen Desi shared concerns about the military's growing autonomy, both agreed that expansion could not wait.

"If they'd split into two columns—one by sea, one by land—with twenty large ships and two or three thousand ground troops, we wouldn't have had such an easy time of it."

"We were fortunate our earlier military training for transmigrators was so thorough. The main force and its backbone were almost entirely our own people."

"You're still dreaming of becoming Archangel, aren't you?" Ma Qianzhu knew Wen Desi's ambitions all too well. "Absolutely not."

Wen Desi smiled helplessly. "I know nobody will agree. Let me turn to military political-ideological matters instead."

"Go ahead."

"Consider the difference between a man who soldiers for a meal ticket versus one who soldiers for survival and advancement—the fundamental purpose shapes everything, including initiative." Wen Desi leaned back. "Most of our New Army joined for the meals. To them, this is like working for a generous landlord: good food, decent clothes, and nothing more. They're not going to lay down their lives for a full belly."

"There's also housing and land—"

"True, but for them, those are just pie in the sky." Wen Desi shook his head. "I believe soldiers from the Commune should be far more committed because they've seen us keep our word. But new recruits from outside? That's a different story entirely."

"High pay? I'm opposed. We're already generous as it is. Once soldiers fight purely for money, they stop fighting the moment the money stops."

"It doesn't have to be salary increases. Bonuses would serve just as well." Wen Desi gripped the vehicle's handle as they jostled over rough terrain. "Director, after such a victory, shouldn't there be some form of reward? I heard that after yesterday's daytime engagement, the soldiers received nothing but a single horse-meat meal."

"The infantry barely saw action. A dozen artillery rounds settled the whole affair."

"But they formed up and charged, didn't they? Besides, transmigrators contributed enormously in both engagements. If the Executive Committee shows no appreciation whatsoever, won't people feel slighted?"

This was indeed an oversight. Ma Qianzhu had already planned to use the occasion for commendations and honor awards—perhaps even medals. But monetary rewards and recognition for transmigrators specifically had not crossed his mind. Now the realization struck him: transmigrators are people too.

The thought drew a bitter smile. Apparently, stepping into leadership meant forgetting certain fundamental truths. Dugu Qiuhun, Wang Ruixiang, Lin Shenhe, and others had contributed immensely this time. Without some gesture of acknowledgment, the effect on morale would be inevitable.

"You're right. But I have reservations about bonuses."

"Bonuses don't have to mean cash. Cigarettes, cola, and similar luxuries for our people. Rice, salt, and cloth for the natives."

Ma Qianzhu nodded slowly. That was worth considering.

"Our technological advantage remains insufficient." With the New Army suffering such heavy losses, any future engagement with proper regulars would bleed them dry.

"Machine guns and explosive shells would make us considerably stronger," Wen Desi observed. "But this victory came down to institutions—"

"Good lord, you're an institutionalist too?"

"Call me whatever you like. The fact remains that institutionally, we're superior to any military force in this era." Wen Desi stretched in his seat. "Left early this morning. Going straight to bed when I get back. Not even a secretary to hold."

"I have two primary concerns," Ma Qianzhu said. "First, that expansion will drain labor from production. Second, maintaining proper control over the military."

"I've been thinking about this as well." Wen Desi turned toward him. "What's your view, Director?"

"Establish an internal affairs department. Expand Internal Security forces to create a counterbalance."

"That approach is meaningless for our current military situation." Wen Desi shook his head. "If Internal Security expands too rapidly, the message becomes obvious. Our officers aren't fools."

"Then what do you propose?"

"I don't believe we've reached the point where counterbalancing is necessary. The key is establishing proper institutions now, then enforcing them rigorously. Once that's done, nobody can claim they're being personally targeted." Wen Desi considered his words carefully. "Rule of law is essential. We cannot afford to operate with a power-scheming mentality—that path leads to endless complications down the road. Take current weapons and ammunition management, for example. It's far too loose. Though most weapons are centralized, checking out firearms is absurdly easy. We need proper weapons allocation: which department receives how many guns, how much ammunition, all formally assigned with personal accountability. Ammunition especially must be kept under strict central storage."

"And troop mobilization, deployment, transfer authority—"

"Precisely. Whatever form of state we eventually become, *********** is something none of us wants to see. So we must establish regulations now, cultivate the habit of doing things by the rules. It's troublesome, but utterly essential." Even as he spoke, Wen Desi felt a twinge of regret. He had always harbored a private preference for more... dystopian arrangements. But with so many strong personalities in their group, it was better not to push his luck.

"Regarding expansion," Wen Desi continued, "I agree it's necessary, but I worry that too aggressive a pace will cripple production. Could we reduce each batch size?"

"The current plan calls for one thousand recruits over three months. That's not excessive. Actually, don't worry—the military can support production as well."

Wen Desi laughed. "Of course! Production support doubles as fitness training."

The Security Team was overwhelmed again today. The previous day's two battles had yielded several hundred prisoners, and the massive screening and interrogation workload was burying Ran Yao. He hastily recalled Mu Min and recruited dialect translators from every available source. Zhou Dongtian also returned to lend his services.

Formal processing finally commenced. The first batch of selected prisoners was brought to the Security Team office.

That office had seen considerable upgrades of late. Originally housed within the Executive Committee compound inside Bairen, complaints had mounted: the lights burning through all hours, the occasional screaming, and protests from certain concerned individuals. Moreover, bringing "unpurified" locals inside the fortress was deemed inappropriate. So during the recent construction boom, Security had relocated outside the walls, establishing a new compound at the former prisoner detention site. The exterior featured barbed wire, trenches, and watchtowers. Inside stood a two-story building housing the various offices, and to its left, set apart in its own courtyard, the prison.

The interrogation room occupied the main building of that prison courtyard. The windows had been deliberately covered with black cloth to create a dark-room atmosphere. Inside, however, there were no Qing-dynasty torture implements on display—merely a chair fitted with handcuffs and leg irons, a few tables, and a desk lamp.

The prisoners from the previous day's daytime engagement had already undergone preliminary processing. They offered little value—all temporary conscripts. Even the most senior among them could explain nothing of substance, insisting only that Zhu Cailao had sent them. The Executive Committee clearly did not find this convincing. The prisoners from the night battle presented a far more complex picture. Though fewer than fifty in number, they included Chinese, Southeast Asian natives, men who appeared Indian, and two unmistakable foreigners with curly hair, deep-set eyes, and pale skin.

This development troubled Ran Yao considerably. The various dialects of this era were already giving him headaches. Now these additions. The foreigners he could handle—transmigrators who spoke English, Spanish, and similar languages could be found readily enough. But what languages did the Indians and Southeast Asian natives speak?

After lengthy deliberation, he decided to begin with the Chinese pirates.

Prisoner screening started with clothing. Ragged garments and malnourished faces clearly did not belong to leaders. Thus the first to face interrogation were the best-dressed and healthiest-looking specimens.

Outside the interrogation room stood several cudgel-carrying police under Dugu Qiuhun's command—temporarily borrowed for the occasion. Additional soldiers with bayoneted rifles completed the security detail. Dugu Qiuhun had earned considerable notoriety from the battle at Bopu, and the pirates feared him. As he paced before them with his machete, inspecting each man with that unsettling grin of his, the rope-bound pirates waiting in the courtyard felt their necks go cold.

Inside, Ran Yao conducted the questioning personally. Three translators attended him, covering Cantonese official dialect, Lingao dialect, and Hokkien.

Once the guards were properly positioned, Dugu Qiuhun suited up completely and prepared to join the proceedings.
