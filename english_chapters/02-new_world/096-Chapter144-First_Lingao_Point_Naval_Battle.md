# Chapter 144: First Lingao Point Naval Battle

Boarding team leader Wang Ruixiang hadn't yet steadied himself when the deck beneath him began strange vibrations. Flames erupted at the ship's rail. No military experience was needed to know: they'd walked into an ambush.

"Retreat!" Li Di's hoarse scream came through his earpiece. Instantly, *Fishing-1* was engulfed in gunpowder smoke.

"All hands, retreat!" He quickly directed the boarding team back toward the rail, looking for chances to jump back. Pirates were already swarming up from below decks, wielding short swords, billhooks, and hook spears. Numerically, they were at an absolute disadvantage. Even their weapons weren't much of an advantage—five pistols couldn't possibly suppress this many.

"Throw Round One!" he yelled. The already-trained team members immediately pulled bamboo-shell grenades from their chest pockets and hurled them.

Round One was the Mechanical Department's bamboo-shell grenade—black powder and porcelain shards packed inside. Its power was limited, but it was perfect for the cramped spaces of ships. Explosions and screams merged. Crew on *Fishing-1*'s deck, platforms, and crossbow positions opened fire with rifles and pistols, instantly suppressing the surging pirates. Seizing the moment, Wang Ruixiang's team scrambled back aboard. Collapsing on the deck, it had been under one minute—but it felt like they'd circled the gates of Hell. *Fishing-1* now looked terrifying—its steel plating was pockmarked with dents; all the glass facing the boats was shattered or cracked.

"Full astern!"

Chen Haiyang, seeing the last team member climb aboard, issued the order. The instant thrust increase made the bow dip sharply, the stern foaming—*Fishing-1* rapidly reversed. The three boats were already enveloped in white gunpowder smoke. Smoke flickered with fire; cannon thunder rumbled.

Dense pellets striking the deckhouse sounded like hail on car roofs.

"Away from windows! Take cover!" Chen Haiyang shouted into the mic—fishing boats lacked armored shutters. He struggled to see through the cracked glass. Then—"Boom—boom—"—the boats fired again. The deckhouse was hit; everyone jolted. A large stone dented the steel plating and shattered into pieces.

"They were fishing for us!" Li Di was pale, already half-crouched under the control panel.

Chen Haiyang shook his head—no time to talk. Clearly, the enemies understood their advantage: speed and maneuverability. This trap had aimed to cripple them at closest range with one volley. But they'd underestimated the steel hull's protection.

The smoke slightly cleared. Two of the other boats were approaching *Fishing-1* under eight oars, moving very fast. Unlike typical hard-sail single-oar boats. Their decks were packed with murderous pirates—many holding torches. Obviously, they were planning a three-boat pincer attack.

*Fishing-1*'s fore and aft Ballistae fired simultaneously. At this close range, both hit. The decks smoked with popping firecrackers, causing commotion—but the advance didn't stop. Round Two was tear gas: besides minimal black powder for the burst, it contained camphor powder and pepper powder. Made for maritime patrol security missions. Minimal lethality.

"Hard port, full ahead." By now, *Fishing-1* had reversed forty to fifty meters. Chen Haiyang didn't know the enemy cannons' capabilities—for safety, he decided to open the distance, avoid the three-boat encirclement, then formulate a strategy.

The engine roar intensified. *Fishing-1* elegantly circled in a half arc, easily escaping the pincer. Now they were broadside to broadside with Boat One—both sides maximizing their firepower. Chen Haiyang carefully maintained a two hundred meter distance. Based on the Industrial Department's test firing of captured weapons, this era's small and medium cannons rarely exceeded that effective range.

"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!" Boat One's broadside flashed continuously. The sea splashed with various water spouts—the nearest splash was twenty meters away. His confidence grew.

He didn't want to use the Ballistae—reloading was too slow. Two people cranking levers took a full minute to reset.

"Port-side rifles—free fire!"

The already enraged crew immediately triggered maximum speed. On my turf—fishing for us? Outrageous! A dozen SKS-D rifles with twenty-round magazines sent dense bullets sweeping like monsoon rain from bow to stern. People, planks, sails, ropes... everything was shredded under the 7.62mm M43 rounds. When Chen Haiyang ordered cease fire, Boat One was completely paralyzed—drifting silently, smoking.

"Report damage!"

"Forward crossbow: three wounded, one serious. No life danger."

"Aft crossbow: one light wound."

"Deck: three light wounds."

Damage was minor. The Ballista's bulletproof shields and steel parapet had protected the gunners. Honestly, the enemy fire was pathetically weak. The projectiles scattered across the deck included iron shards, nails, stones, and porcelain fragments...

"Notify Navy HQ—send a ship to secure Boat One!" Since the wounded weren't critical, Chen Haiyang ordered pursuit of the remaining two boats.

The other two boats—seeing *Fishing-1* speed away from their pincer at high speed—had already turned and were fleeing seaward. Oars and sails at maximum. But wind and muscle couldn't outrun machine power. The diesel roared. *Fishing-1* sliced through the waves, rapidly closing to two hundred meters. Desperately, the enemies fired their stern guns—all fell far from *Fishing-1*.

"Sink the Yoshino!" Li Di shouted excitedly on the bridge.

Nobody heeded his enthusiasm. *Fishing-1* was just a fishing boat—it had no underwater ram. Not worth the risk.

*Fishing-1* continuously launched incendiary projectiles from its Ballistae—tar balls. A stone core coated with thick straw and wood-tar paste, wrapped in straw sacking. When lit and launched, they left black smoke trails in the sky—easy for aiming correction.

The bridge continuously reported wind direction, speed, distance, and ship speed. The gunnery officer frantically calculated with a slide rule, then announced the Ballista firing angles. Imprecise ballistics calculation still showed immense value. After six shots, the seventh correction hit the fleeing Boat Two. Its sails caught fire.

The ship slowed. The distance closed. Tar balls became more accurate. Even the aft-deck Ballista joined in with high-angle over-shooting. Momentarily spectacular—smoke trails wove aerial nets; the net's bottom was Boat Two, constantly struck by tar balls. The fire intensified. Finally—probably a powder explosion—the ship was torn apart with a roar.

"Signal Boat Three: drop sails, surrender."

"Understood!" Li Di immediately swapped the recording tape. Surrender demands were standard: drop weapons, raise a white flag.

But Boat Three clearly wasn't surrendering. While they'd dealt with Boats One and Two, Boat Three had escaped nearly a kilometer. Through eight-times binoculars, they could see extra oars had been added aft; people were frantically jettisoning debris overboard.

"Destroy them!"

Though unfortunate to miss prisoners, safely ending the battle was paramount.

*Fishing-1* again accelerated to two hundred meters, turned broadside toward the fleeing Boat Three—letting both Ballistae achieve maximum effect.

Ten minutes later, Boat Three had become a giant torch. The powder had probably already been jettisoned—no explosion. Through binoculars, desperate pirates could be seen jumping overboard.

"Recover prisoners."

Fifteen prisoners were fished out. Those wounded too badly to climb aboard were left to fate. Those swimming shoreward were systematically headshot by rifles—no mercy for enemies.

This historically named "First Lingao Point Naval Battle" had erupted with the transmigration Navy completely unprepared. The battle had lasted nearly one hour. The enemy's experience and cunning were fully displayed; their battle preparation had been thorough. Despite the hasty response, the transmigration Navy's excellent training and massive technological advantage achieved total victory.

Boat One, towed back by *Fishing-2*, contained only three survivors. Many had hidden below decks, thinking the thick planking would protect them. All were indiscriminately shot or had bled to death. Inspectors reported: blood had flowed from the second deck down to the bilge.

Ship photos quickly received an Intelligence response: this was a common Ming-era Guangdong "double mast fast ship"—a Guangzhou type used for fishing and coastal cargo. Well made and suitable for the open sea, it was familiar to European and Southeast Asian traders. Measurements: 27.5 meters overall length, 21 meters waterline length, 6 meters beam. These dimensions suited anything—including piracy.
