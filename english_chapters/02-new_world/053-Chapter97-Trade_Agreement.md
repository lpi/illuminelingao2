# Chapter 97: Trade Agreement

The headman led them to an open field outside the village and instructed them to rest there. This Li settlement bore no resemblance to the tourist-trap "authentic Li villages" of the modern era. For one thing, it lacked walls entirely—it looked more like an ordinary rural hamlet, only somewhat larger. Dense, thorny shrubs encircled it, interwoven with bamboo and creeping vines into a living hedge so thick that not even a rabbit could squeeze through. None of them had ever seen such a barrier.

Nor did the village contain any of the iconic "boat-shaped houses" they had expected from tourist brochures—stilted structures with living quarters above and livestock pens below. Instead, the dwellings were pyramid-shaped straw huts with walls of bamboo-strip lattice plastered over with mud. Quite distinctive. Nanan Village was evidently the *dong*'s capital.

Hainan's *li-dong* were roughly delineated by natural terrain, each usually comprising several villages. The *dong* chiefs held government-recognized hereditary positions, complete with official seals and bronze credentials. These Li native officials—*dong* chiefs and *tushe* administrators—had two primary duties: to suppress the Li commoners and maintain local peace, and to fulfill the government's various annual levies, both official taxes and the private "lucky money" that greased palms all the way up. Naturally, they also had to collect their own income—native officials, large or small, received no government salary and were expected to extract it themselves. In other words, as long as they paid all dues on time, both official and otherwise, native officials could do whatever they pleased within their territory. They were essentially local emperors.

Those waiting outside were under Zhang Bailin's supervision. Everyone maintained an outward calm while staying inwardly alert, resting efficiently. Lu Rong, Wen Desi, and Mu Min followed the headman into the village to meet the *dong* chief.

Many curious Li people, both inside and outside the village, watched from a distance, pointing and murmuring. Wen Desi noticed several old women sitting on roadside rocks, weaving rattan. Their faces were densely tattooed with black patterns, their mouths solid black masses. Truly horrifying. *So this was the famous "Eighteen Oddities" of Hainan—"old grannies look like monsters."* Seeing was believing. *(Note: Li women's face-tattooing continued until the 1950s. Tattooing served both to prevent capture by outsiders and to symbolize romantic fidelity. The black lips and teeth were simply the result of daily betel-nut chewing.)* Looking more carefully, he noticed that nearly all women were tattooed except for young children. Everyone's fantasies about beautiful minority maidens shattered on the spot.

"This custom must be revolutionized," Wei Aiwen muttered. In his original plan, recruiting Li soldiers was merely step one; the next phase involved consolidating power by commanding Li troops—and the crucial element was marrying a Li headman's daughter. He had imagined Li girls based on movie images. Present reality shook that plan to its foundations.

If a headman actually offered his daughter, should he accept? Truly troubling. Moreover, local women got tattooed upon adulthood... He found himself fretting over castles in the air.

At the moment, never mind headmen's daughters—even ordinary Li girls weren't interested in him. For Li commoners, these strangers were terrifying: they'd heard that the newcomers' "powder guns" *(Note: the Li term for firearms)* were formidable, firing continuously and killing from great distances. Survivors of their last encounter said the gunfire had been relentless—people died in droves.

Lu Rong's group was led into a large house at the village center. Taller than ordinary homes, it was built on a raised platform with bamboo-lattice beds on three sides for sitting or sleeping, leaving only a central corridor. The fire-pit stood against the back wall, with bamboo racks above it for smoking food. Side windows provided some light, but the interior was still quite dim—entering it felt like going blind until one's eyes adjusted.

The *dong* chief was an old man with white hair and poor complexion. They later learned he was only just past fifty, though by 17th-century standards that qualified as elderly anywhere in the world. Lu Rong presented the specially prepared gifts: one bottle of Red Star *Erguotou*, one bag of rock candy, and two folding knives.

Of these, the *Erguotou* in its glass bottle attracted the most attention. Though *baijiu* was common in Ming times, liquor in a transparent, colorless glass bottle was visually striking for anyone in this era. Clearly, a glass bottle serving merely as modern packaging was far more valuable to him than the liquor inside.

As for the two folding knives—the *dong* chief examined them closely, scratched a wooden board several times, and his eyes gleamed with admiration.

"Such fine knives—even in the county seat, you can't buy these." The chief looked up at them, visibly surprised. "Where are you from? Qiongshan?"

Wen Desi launched into his Australian sea-merchant routine—practiced so often it had become polished smooth. The chief knew little about the outside world; the only Han area he had ever visited was the Lingao County seat. The "great official" in Qiongzhou Prefecture—the Prefect—was the highest authority in his understanding. But upon hearing they weren't Ming people but overseas Chinese, he visibly relaxed. He ordered wine to be brought—rice wine made from glutinous *shanlang* rice grown by the Li. This wine would later develop into the local specialty *Shanlan Yulu* ("Shanlang Jade Dew").

*Shanlang* wine was simple fermented glutinous rice—only seven days of brewing, minimal alcohol content, similar to modern sweet rice wine. All three drank a bowl.

With wine as lubricant, discussions went easier, and they gleaned considerable local information. The chief's surname was Zhu—though he bore no relation to Zhu Yuanzhang; his family were so-called "banana children"—generations of village headmen. During the Wanli-era *Mashi* Uprising, many Lingao *dong* had been involved, but his family had not. After the pacification, nearby villages were consolidated into one *dong*, and he was made *dong* chief. The entire *dong* comprised seven villages with over two thousand men, women, and children—one of Lingao's largest.

As for governance—Chief Zhu said recent county magistrates had been manageable, their demands modest. Sending annual "regulation fees" kept them satisfied. Only in recent years had road security deteriorated, with fewer Han peddlers reaching the Li areas. Salt had always been expensive; now prices were worse. If the sea-merchants could bring salt, they would take any quantity, exchanging hides, red-and-white rattan, betel nuts, and cattle. The bribed Headman Fu added: it would be best if they could also sell iron goods—farming tools and knives were scarce here.

These conditions were expected; Lu Rong agreed to all of them. Salt and iron could not yet be manufactured, but production was imminent—supply would not be a problem. In comparison, Li territory offered many useful products: timber, cotton cloth, hides, rattan, pigs and cattle—all urgently needed.

On pricing, Wen Desi decided against exploitation. Operating like itinerant peddlers—selling small quantities with huge markups—meant low volumes. Of course, in an age of low productivity, poor transport capacity, and dangerous roads, high-profit methods were understandable. But for transmigrators with large-scale industrial production capacity, that approach was unsuitable. Exorbitant salt prices might yield high profits, but commoners would minimize consumption to survival levels, resulting in low sales. Lower prices meant consumer demand would immediately rise.

His salt price pleased Chief Zhu and the headman—only one-third of peddlers' prices. Yet even this made Wen Desi feel like a profiteer. Salt was measured temporarily in official *dou*; upon his return, Wen Desi decided to produce measuring instruments of their own, using trade to spread transmigrator units of measurement. For iron goods, he did not yet know Ming iron prices, so he only promised they would certainly be cheaper than the peddlers.

After bargaining, they reached their first trade agreement since arriving in this timespace—historically: *The Nanan Village Trade Agreement*. Its terms: the transmigrators could sell any goods to Nanan *dong*, but each trade must include certain quantities of salt and iron. Nanan *dong* would exchange any goods the transmigrators needed—except people.

The 80 kg of salt brought on this trip netted over seventy cowhides, deerskins, and wild-boar skins; forty bolts of Qiong-cloth; and one water buffalo. The piled goods made everyone feel like profiteers—they did not yet know that specialized Li-trade peddlers could exchange one *jin* (old *jin*, 594g) of coarse salt for a 20–30 *jin* pig.

The Li also felt they had profited: hides were abundant in every village—easily obtained in their eyes; Qiong-cloth was simply women's home-spun fabric—worthless.

The chief additionally gifted twelve bolts of kudzu cloth. Kudzu cloth was a famous Ming-era Hainan product—moisture-wicking and heat-dissipating, a premium summer fabric. Each returned prisoner's family contributed one pig as thanks for their release. Everyone was satisfied. Chief Zhu summoned all the villages' *aoya* to drink. At the feast, he produced two arrows. First, he had someone loudly recite the agreement, then he carved nine notches on one arrow and handed the other to Lu Rong.

"You also carve nine notches." Mu Min explained that this was the arrow-cutting ceremony, signifying that both parties must honor the terms. Violators would be fined ninety cattle and ninety *liang* of silver.

After cutting arrows, they drank several more bowls of rice wine. Both sides designated liaisons: for the transmigrators, Lu Rong; for Nanan *dong*, local *aoya* Fu Dayou. Wen Desi then proposed staying in Nanan several more days to see what local products they might need. If available, these could offset salt-and-iron payments. The request was readily granted.
