# Chapter 85: Building Materials

Just as the Committee's professional groups were arguing over priority access to labor, Xiao Zishan received another call from Ran Yao: Li minority prisoners had been discovered during interrogations.

"Really?" Xiao Zishan was startled. On Hainan Island, the Li people had always been a powerful force. Every county's annals devoted separate sections to "Li affairs." From the Yuan Dynasty onward, hardly a year passed without Li uprisings; Han-Li conflict was intense. Defending against the Li had always been a key government task. Because of Li resistance, Han migration had never penetrated Hainan's core regions. Transmigrators developing on Hainan had to be extremely cautious regarding Li issues.

"What's the situation?"

"They say the county conscripted them as crossbowmen. Thirty came; we captured eight," Ran Yao said over the phone. "Also, remember that family that accidentally got involved—"

"Yes, the woman's a cop—assigned to you for interrogations."

"She's Li—and her ancestral home is Hainan. Wonderful, right? I think we can use this connection."

"I recall she speaks Sichuan Mandarin? Many modern minorities are heavily watered-down. Besides, she left the area long ago—what could she know?"

"No, she knows a lot about her people. The Li prisoners now prostrate themselves before her." Laughter came through the PHS. "You see, talent sometimes appears unexpectedly."

Guo Yi had mostly finished screening: the vast majority were farmers—small landlords often personally worked the land. A few were craftsmen, actually half-farmer half-artisan—burning pottery in slack seasons, or bricklayers doing house repairs. The one with decent skills was a rough carpenter, an older man. Only one was literate: Zhang Xingjiao. He was separately called out and assigned to study Mandarin with Xiong Buyou, becoming the entire labor team's clerk—recording work points and such.

Wu De pulled out the craftsmen into a separate team. The rest, minus twenty-odd wounded, were divided into five labor teams, led by the original five prisoners as captains. During organization, following interrogation records, he mixed Lingao natives, Fujian migrants, and other settlers—scrambling them—continuing divide-and-rule. *You must not unite.* Lin Xing and the others were now captains, forgetting their half-prisoner half-slave status, feeling rather pleased. Without Wu De's orders, they had already fashioned themselves into beating-sticks, ready to zealously drive the new wretches.

Strict hierarchy, absolute power between superior and subordinate, and benefits derived from power—these were immensely seductive in human groups. Wu De, having worked years in military and judicial organs, understood this deeply. So he deliberately deepened these distinctions. Each of the five captains received an ugly rattan safety helmet—failed prototypes from the Industrial Committee, originally destined to be burned as firewood. Wu De claimed them all, using "has helmet" versus "no helmet" as visible status markers.

Due to urgent construction needs, all labor teams were assigned to the Building Group for producing building materials: bricks.

Modern construction had gradually shifted from bricks and tiles to reinforced concrete, but fired clay bricks remained the most economical and widespread material. The Building Engineering Group naturally would not abandon them.

According to scouts, three kilometers from Bairren Rapids they had found a brick-and-tile works—a typical traditional operation with three earthen round kilns. Workers had all fled, but everything remained: fired bricks and tiles, air-dried blanks, and much "aged clay."

Brick-and-tile production was quite elaborate. First, excavate raw clay—organic-free. Sun-dry the raw clay, crush it, add water, then repeatedly crush and tread it into aged clay, then form blanks. Blanks could not go directly into kilns—too much moisture would crack or deform them. They needed air-drying for ten days to two weeks—no sun, no strong wind, no cold. So conventionally, winter could not produce bricks. Only after air-drying could blanks be kiln-fired.

If transmigrators had to make and fire bricks themselves, efficiency would be unimaginable. But they had a combined brick-making machine, driven by a locomobile. Blank-making efficiency depended solely on how much raw clay they could excavate.

Mei Wan found earthen round kilns too inefficient, requiring skilled masters for loading—not for manual-reading greenhorns. Fortunately, plenty of ready bricks were available. He started building a 16-chamber Hoffmann kiln.

Hoffmann kilns were "Western kilns"—already outdated compared to modern tunnel kilns, but absolutely advanced technology in this timespace.

A continuous-production kiln, it could simultaneously load blanks, unload bricks, and clean. The kiln comprised many interconnected small chambers like a ring-shaped tunnel, with many kiln doors around it. All flues connected to a central main flue. Fuel was fed through top loading-holes. Working zones during operation: drying, preheating, firing, and cooling. In a 16-chamber kiln, while Chamber One unloaded, Chamber Sixteen was already cleaning, Chamber Fifteen loading; then Chamber Two could unload, Chamber One would clean, Chamber Sixteen would load. Once ignited, it ran twenty-four hours continuously—far beyond traditional kilns in efficiency and heat utilization. An ordinary Hoffmann kiln could produce over 50 million bricks annually.

To save time, while installing machinery and building the Hoffmann kiln, Mei Wan decided to first fire the already air-dried blanks. But loading traditional kilns was skilled work—neither transmigrators nor laborers had done it. News reached the Committee. Intelligence Group's Luo Duo again played his role as "walking encyclopedia"—quickly finding on a computer hard drive an electronic copy of a 1958 pamphlet *Traditional Methods for Making Bricks and Tiles*. Within an hour, this printed booklet was rushed to the kiln site. Laborers stared in amazement as this "pirate craftsman" used a book to teach them kiln-loading—*secrets only old masters knew!*

Near the kiln were large thatch fields. Mei Wan asked laborers who had once done casual work at the kiln—this was fuel specifically planted. Earthen kilns worked better with such "soft fuel"; hardwood burned too fiercely, hard to control. The transmigrators naturally appropriated this fuel.

While the earthen kilns fired, Mei Wan directed labor teams in continuous grass-cutting and clay-digging. Grass bundles and clay mounds piled high. Some prisoners thought the pirates intended to work them to death—*so much clay, you couldn't use it even without eating or sleeping.*

When the locomobile was adjusted and began chugging black smoke, the flywheel spinning, driving the combined brick-making machine—prisoners saw heaps of aged clay poured into the steel maw, iron parts rising and falling in bewildering clamor, then smooth blanks emerging as if by magic, neatly cut into whole boards of brick blanks. Even the most skilled brick-makers could not work this fast! Everyone was stupefied—*these pirates can do anything!* And their building speed was beyond humanly possible. Some simply knelt before the roaring machine, kowtowing repeatedly.

"What kowtowing—get moving, bring more material!" Mei Wan yelled at the dazed Lin Xing.

"Understood, Chief!" Someone with too much free time had taught him this term; now he called every transmigrator *Chief*.

"Work! Work!" He waved his stick zealously. "Move clay—quick—slowpokes get thrown in that iron mouth!"

This threat was far more effective than his stick. Every prisoner developed superstitious terror of the machine, working zealously, fearing slow work meant being thrown in the machine's maw—*surely this thing required human sacrifices?*

Formed blanks were carted to the stacking yard. The original drying sheds were emptied, perfect for stacking new blanks. All bricks followed the old "85 brick" standard dimensions.

Clearly, the machine's production speed vastly exceeded this era's capacity. Before evening, all the aged clay that Lingao brickmakers had prepared for months was exhausted. The machine had to stop temporarily.

To build the Hoffmann kiln, Mei Wan's other task was producing cement. For him, cement had always meant calling for delivery. Even cement used after D-Day came from the original timespace. Making it from scratch—he had no idea. He knew "crude cement" existed, but how to make it, what performance to expect—no clue.

In modern society, the cement industry had become highly specialized, mechanized large-scale production involving many special large equipment: crushers, rotary kilns, ball mills. Replicating such equipment was too extravagant for transmigrators. Even buying ready equipment and installing it—such giant equipment was beyond their current capabilities.
