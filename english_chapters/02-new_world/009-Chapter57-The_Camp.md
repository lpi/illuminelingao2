# Chapter 57: The Camp

He was considering what else to write when shouting erupted outside. Wu Nanhai from the Agriculture Group had gotten into an argument with He Ping, whom Shi Niaoren had sent to disinfect the latrine. Wu came storming over demanding an explanation. Though He Ping had worked at a state pharmaceutical factory before crossing, he'd actually been in equipment and instrument maintenance—knew nothing about pharmacology. The Health Group had requested him because his wife, Zhao Yanmei, was a technician at the factory's mold-culture seed lab. Shi Niaoren was planning future pharmaceutical projects and needed to secure Zhao Yanmei first—and naturally, keeping a wife meant keeping her husband too.

He Ping had a square face and glasses, a scholarly look. He'd simply become the Health Group's clerk—doing odd jobs and running errands. How had he gotten into a fight with someone?

Going outside to look: fatty Wu Nanhai was grabbing He Ping, face full of indignation. He Ping looked aggrieved, still holding a nylon bag of lime.

"Did you order him to spread lime?" Seeing the boss emerge, Wu Nanhai redirected his fire at Shi Niaoren.

"What? Is there a problem? The Health Group is disinfecting the latrine."

"Do you understand chemistry?" Wu Nanhai pointed at the lime. "Manure is nitrogenous fertilizer. It cannot be mixed with alkaline materials like plant ash and lime. Mixing them neutralizes the fertilizer. You have someone dumping lime everywhere—what use is the latrine's waste now?!"

Shi Niaoren's expression turned ugly. He was, after all, a US-trained PhD, a medical beast who'd operated in America and handled epidemics in Beijing. Being questioned about chemistry by an agricultural-college undergrad was quite embarrassing. But on reflection, Wu Nanhai was an Agriculture head and also a Committee member. Agriculture was a priority industry the Committee planned to push hard—many future logistics needs would depend on Agriculture. He himself headed Health. If department heads clashed openly, there'd be no room for maneuvering later. He calmed himself, swallowing his anger. He really hadn't considered the fertilizer-efficacy issue. Using lime to disinfect latrines was the simplest, most common method. When treating infectious patients' waste, using lime was almost standard procedure.

"We overlooked this." Shi Niaoren quickly apologized and sweet-talked Wu Nanhai away. Xiao He wore an unhappy expression—he'd been scolded for following the boss's orders.

"It's just shit. He can just make more!"

"We're learning through practice." Dr. Shi soothed his subordinate. "Wu Nanhai needs fertilizer for agriculture—something about 'crops need flowers' or whatever." He glanced at the lime bag—barely used. The lime had been obtained from the Building Engineering Department—he was reluctant to use bleaching powder, which he planned for drinking-water treatment.

No lime, no bleaching powder—waste treatment would need another approach. Shi Niaoren specialized in infectious diseases and was familiar with epidemic prevention. He knew there were many methods for waste decontamination. Lime and bleaching powder worked quickly. Without those, the simplest option was sealed storage—but that required three-stage septic tanks, or at minimum some fermentation jars. What about natural plants? He recalled reading that certain wild plants could substitute. Problem was he couldn't remember which plants, and he hadn't studied traditional Chinese medicine—even knowing names, he might not recognize them.

Just as he was thinking about filing a report asking where to find TCM experts, Tian Jiujiu came in asking what water-treatment method the Health Group planned to use so they could finalize the water-supply construction plan.

"One goes out, another comes in," Shi Niaoren muttered.

"What?"

"Nothing—I'll come to the site now."

The water-supply system was under Health Group's direct control. Bopu's shallow groundwater was too salty for drinking; they had no capacity yet to tap deep aquifers. The only option was to draw from the Wenlan River.

For drinking water, springs or deep groundwater were ideal. A river like the Wenlan had substantial flow and reasonable self-purification capacity—usable. But this was a river-delta area; water quality was generally more polluted, requiring complex treatment.

Shi Niaoren tested depth and flow, then drew a 250ml sample from 50cm below the surface. Without testing equipment, he could only use basic observation and smell.

The results made him shake his head repeatedly. He'd assumed 17th-century pollution levels would mean very clean river water. In fact, though sediment was low, algae were abundant—indicating excessive organic matter in the water. In modern times, this was unsurprising—chemicals. But Ming Dynasty had no chemical fertilizers; such high organic content meant the upper-middle reaches were developed agricultural or residential zones.

Still, the water was usable. By Shi Niaoren's observation, it met at least Class III standards by modern metrics—some modern city water plants' intake points didn't even reach that.

But for drinking water, this quality required complex sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Any supply model needed settling ponds, filter wells, disinfection pools, channels... For the materials-starved Engineering Group, this was fantasy.

Considering antiquated infectious-disease conditions—cholera and typhoid bacteria in the water were highly probable—Shi Niaoren concluded: until proper water-treatment facilities could be built, better not to use river water.

"Just keep shipping freshwater from the ship to shore." He sighed and went directly to report to Ma Qianzhu.

Ma Qianzhu didn't fully understand the ship's freshwater situation and called Meng De.

"The ship has water, but not for long." Meng De explained: typical ships had at least two freshwater tanks. One stored potable water—freshwater piped in at port. One stored utility water—distilled water condensed from main-engine cooling water. This desalinated soft water was normally for washing, not drinking. If potable water ran short, it could be drunk.

The *Fengcheng*, designed as an ocean-going vessel, had 4 freshwater tanks with substantial capacity. But original design was for 40–50 crew; now nearly 600 people strained it. The auxiliary engine produced limited new distilled water—couldn't sustain large-scale long-term supply.

"Using the auxiliary for freshwater!" Ma Qianzhu frowned after his report. "Trading diesel for water! Rivers don't flow with diesel."

Shi Niaoren knew Ma grudged the fuel, but he knew Lingao's history: cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid—intestinal infections had been widespread here. Even in the 1970s–80s, small outbreaks still occurred. Though modern medicine meant transmigrators had been vaccinated, nothing was guaranteed—even if they avoided infectious disease, acute enteritis outbreaks would be bad enough.

After laying out the pros and cons, Ma Qianzhu accepted the recommendation. To conserve water, Command decided: establish a centralized water station on shore; lay water lines along the floating-drum route, piping ship freshwater to a 2-ton stainless-steel water tank in the living area—for drinking and washing only.

"As for bathing—just tough it out for now." Ma Qianzhu knew this water-rationing policy would earn countless curses, but there was no choice. He sat down to draft a document and sent it via OA. "Building materials"—he noted in his memo. Many of today's problems traced back to this bottleneck. Tonight's meeting must address it.

Dusk deepened. D-Day's daylight was ending. As walkie-talkies announced "knock off," transmigrators who'd worked all day at outlying sites trickled back toward camp in twos and threes.

The Logging Group returned from the mangroves, chatting, tools on shoulders. Though physically exhausted, everyone's heart held fervent emotions; mutual bonds had clearly strengthened.

The tide was ebbing; seawater washed over the bay's rocks of all sizes. In the distance, Lingao Cape's silhouette emerged on the western horizon. The crimson sunset slowly sank amid scattered clouds and colorful sky. Bopu Bay's light and sea merged, glittering. The sea, as if ablaze, turned brilliant gold-red.

The transmigrators' fleet lay anchored in the bay. Dark ship silhouettes were edged with radiant gold from the sunset. These utterly ordinary cargo ships and fishing boats, at this moment, seemed as magnificent as an imperial fleet in Scapa Flow.

The majestic scene intoxicated them; wordless emotion silenced them. Not just them—transmigrators returning from other work sites also slowed, gazing at this splendid view.

"Let's move, everyone—it's getting dark." Military Group personnel at the rear called out while checking for stragglers. Per the plan, they'd bring up the rear, ensuring no one remained outside camp after dark.

"Blockhouse!" someone shouted. Looking toward camp, the beacon tower now had an earthen rampart around it topped with barbed wire. At first glance, it really did look like a Japanese pillbox from old war films.

After a day's construction, the camp had taken basic shape. Centered on the beacon tower and patrol-office buildings, the camp formed an irregular pentagon. The outer perimeter had a ditch 5 meters wide and 2 meters deep, filled with Wenlan River water. The inner bank was built 1 meter higher than the outer, topped with barbed wire—2 meters high, secured with cross-braced wooden posts, firmly buried. Concertina wire ran at the base. Behind the wire, excavated earth formed a long rampart with trenches dug atop. Six 8-meter wooden watchtowers stood on the rampart.

Now torches lined the rampart, brightly illuminating the ditch. The camp gate stood open. On the gatehouse, two sentries with rifles stood beside a searchlight. Two carbide lamps hung below the gatehouse, blindingly bright. Travelers passed through the gate, scanned their dog tags at the Personnel registration point, then returned tools and excess materials at the Planning Committee depot.

"Liu Zheng, right?" The Personnel Group clerk checked the ID photo and personal info on screen, compared it to his face. "Your barracks assignment is Building B, Number 14."
