# Chapter 185: Diana Mendoza

The interrogation began.

The first prisoner brought in was a burly man in his thirties with a dark face and rough hands and feet—clearly an old sea dog with years of maritime living. Based on his clothing, personal effects, and silver, he was probably a leader.

When asked where he was from, he started yelling: "Villains! Villains! Boss Zhu will deal with you eventually!"

Seeing Dugu Qiuhun sharpening his blade nearby, this man sneered.

"Why the knife? Bring whips and branding irons! If I frown, I'm no true follower of Boss Zhu!"

Dugu Qiuhun raged, grabbing his stun baton.

"No hurry." Ran Yao stopped Dugu, leisurely opening his notebook.

"Name?"

"I don't change my name no matter where I go—Han Yiping!"

"Gender?"

"Where's your hometown?"

"How many relatives?"

"When did you first become a pirate?"

"How long have you been one?"

"What's your gang leader called?"

...

"What's your boss called?"

"What's his hometown?"

"Gender?"

"When did you first become a pirate?"

...

"When did you first become a pirate?"

"What's your gang leader's name?"

"Gender?"

"When did you first become a pirate?"

"Where's your hometown?"

...

"You said you're from Nan'an, Fujian?"

"The previous seven times you clearly said you're from Minhou, Fujian!"

"Which is it?!"

"What's your gang leader called?!"

"SPEAK!"

"LIGHTS ON!"

"Say your name!"

...

After four hours of uninterrupted relay questioning, Han Yiping's mouth was finally pried open. On the twenty-fifth time answering "Who's your gang leader," he finally said "Liu Xiang."

He still tried denying it after being caught, but under continuous bombardment, he finally broke down completely.

Once a person submits and confesses, they tell everything. Han Yiping quickly revealed all he knew.

He was a "stockholder" (*gu*) in Liu Xiang's organization, a "steward" (*zhangui*)—not a direct subordinate but valued because his men were especially formidable, contributing greatly in every clash with officials or other pirate gangs. This operation's overall commander on Liu Xiang's side was a woman.

"A woman?"

"A foreign devil girl." Han Yiping gestured, saying this woman was famous among maritime groups. She had her own Western-style fast ship, always operated independently, was ruthless and cunning. Close ties with Macau's Franks. Previously under Zheng Zhilong, even well-regarded, then suddenly retired for over half a year.

Liu Xiang's organization had learned about transmigrators occupying Lingao back in October, but Lingao was not worth much and was traditionally Zhu Cailao's territory. Liu Xiang was not interested.

The proposal to seize the fast ships had indeed come from Zhu Cailao's people—when joining their new boss, they had revealed everything, including Shi Shisi's returned news and observations.

Zhu Cailao indeed intended cooperating with the transmigrators. Precisely because of this, Liu Xiang had staged this whole drama, aiming to kill two birds with one stone: capture "iron fast ships" while preventing Zhu Cailao from cooperating with the transmigrators. For this, he had not only recruited a mob of random pirates under Zhu Cailao's name but also included some former Zhu subordinates in the operation.

"Wasn't Liu Xiang afraid you'd confess if captured?"

"We were told: if captured, just insist we're Zhu Cailao's men. You had a grudge with Zhu Cailao; you'd believe it." Han Yiping answered listlessly. "Besides, not many here actually knew about Chief Liu."

"What about the Western big ship?"

"I don't know. Our contact with the Western ship was all through that foreign devil girl."

"What's her name?"

"Li-something-ya?"

Ran Yao frowned, remembering something. His memory was excellent; he immediately recalled this should be the woman who had kidnapped Mr. Wen years ago.

"Black curly hair, slightly brown eyes?"

"Right, right. This foreign devil girl is quite pretty—" Han the pirate swallowed.

No mistake. Definitely her. Ran Yao thought: *what a small world.* But neither corpses nor prisoners included any women.

"Where is she?"

"On the Western big ship. Probably escaped. This devil girl is very clever."

Ran Yao asked many more questions about Liu Xiang's strength, bases, and main leaders' names. Han Yiping answered everything honestly. What he did not know, he could not tell. Ran Yao did not force it. Based on experience, Han Yiping's extractable value was about exhausted.

More prisoners were questioned with little value. Then came the Indians, jabbering incomprehensibly. Later, realizing they worked for Spanish, they might speak Spanish. They hurried to find Spanish speakers.

"No Spanish speakers." After checking personnel files, Xiao Zishan gave the answer.

"Impossible! We'll be dealing with Spanish in the future!"

"We have English, French, Japanese, German, Italian, Russian, and Korean speakers. Even Latin! But no Spanish."

"This is ridiculous! Even Korean but no Spanish? Second language would work!"

"Really none. I can't even find 'Spanish' as a search term."

"What do I do?" Ran Yao hung up helplessly. Dugu Qiuhun's eyes suddenly lit up. He remembered the Latin hottie on the North American yacht earlier today. The Qian brothers had mentioned she was Venezuelan-something. Dugu Qiuhun's impressions of Venezuela were exactly two: beauty pageant winners and the frequently news-making Chavez.

"Latin American countries all speak Spanish, right?"

"Yes, also some Portuguese—" Ran Yao now remembered: was there not a Venezuelan-American woman with temporary ID #008?

He picked up the phone, calling Xiao Zishan: "I need someone transferred here. Process it quickly."

"Who? Speaks Spanish?"

"Diana Mendoza."

Diana Mendoza had always believed she was the unluckiest person. Zhou Weisen always boasted he had seduced her with his charm. Actually, Diana had just been drunk in that Hawaiian bar, hoping for a free yacht ride to catch sea breezes. Instead, these Chinese had kidnapped her. And after two weeks of torment, she had arrived in some wilderness and been told it was the 17th century!

Diana Mendoza naturally did not believe this nonsense. After slapping the gibberish-spouting biology PhD several times, she stormed into the bridge. The GPS, radar, and maritime satellite phone she had been absolutely forbidden to touch were now freely available. Obviously, she could not get any expected results.

After prolonged struggling and crying, she finally exhausted herself. The Qian brothers' wives gently persuaded her until she clearly understood her situation—without Zhou Weisen, she could not even eat. Diana Mendoza, like women in similar circumstances, completely resigned herself. Zhou Weisen naturally was not shy, exploiting the beauty's fear and helplessness in unfamiliar surroundings to easily make Diana Mendoza his woman.

For the Executive Committee, Zhou Weisen's emotional and physical needs being met was naturally cause for celebration. But Xiao Zishan really could not figure out what use this English Literature major Latina had—she could not even speak Chinese. He could only list her as "dependent," a category shared only by some transmigrators' children. This Spanish translation assignment was at least putting her to use. She spoke both English and Spanish fluently.

Seeing this tall, beautiful Eurasian-mixed woman appear in the office, several men's eyes lit up. No wonder they said Venezuela was a land of beauties—a perfect blend of yellow, white, and black races' advantages. *Zhou Weisen, you beast!*

Problem was, though her Chinese had improved considerably in recent months for simple daily conversation, complex explanations were still beyond her. She needed an English translator.

As it turned out, the Indians' Spanish was tragic. Their Spanish was incomprehensible even to Diana Mendoza. After much confusion, they finally understood: they were sailors, recruited in Manila by some Spanish lord named Sidonia. Beyond that, they knew nothing—not even where they currently were.

"What use are Indians to us?" Dugu Qiuhun asked. In his view, they should behead a few pirates for deterrence.

"For curry. I actually quite like it." Ran Yao said. "If they're sailors, they'll be useful."

Last to be questioned were the Spaniards. Seeing a beautiful, Spanish-speaking compatriot among the Orientals, the two Spanish prisoners' jaws nearly dropped.

Both had been recruited in Manila. One was a sailor, one an ordinary soldier. They came from Spanish America's Panama viceroyalty, trying their luck in the Philippines viceroyalty.

From them, Ran Yao finally learned how the Spanish galleon had joined this battle. He also learned the commander's name: Aragonés Sidonia. A Spanish "gentleman" commissioned to recruit and command a galleon for trade or plunder on the Chinese coast, and if possible, establish a trading foothold with local Chinese pirates' help.

Aragonés could not personally fund such an expedition, so this voyage was organized like a joint-stock company. The Manila Spanish governor, some officials, and plantation owners were investors. The galleon's equipment, crew recruitment, and supply purchases were shared by stock percentage. Aragonés Sidonia, as commander, received one-fifth of total profits. If he secured a coastal base, he would also receive a bonus.

All participating soldiers and sailors received no pay or wages. But they collectively shared one-fifth of total profits—distributed by rank.

"This is just a robbery gang, plain and simple!" Dugu Qiuhun said angrily after hearing. "Ask them how many Chinese ships they've robbed! How many Chinese killed!"

Ran Yao was not interested in that. He cared more about the ship's capabilities.

According to their confessions, *Countess of Scarborough* had 400 personnel total, including soldiers, sailors, doctors, gunners, craftsmen, and servants. Some were Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, Indian, Black, and mixed-race; the rest were locally recruited Malay natives.

Quite international. No wonder Yu Eshui had said this era's sailors were a collection of every nation's dregs. Besides this motley crew, *Countess of Scarborough* carried much cargo, including trade goods, large quantities of firearms and powder—some already sold to Liu Xiang—and fort-building tools and materials. Food and water were actually limited. They operated coastally and could resupply ashore anytime. After allying with local pirate chief Liu Xiang, resupply was even easier. Reportedly, their next target was a Chinese pirate called "Yiguan."
