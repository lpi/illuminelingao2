# Chapter 189: New Year

For several months, the Security Team had conducted extensive research on Lingao's local conditions. Through prisoner interrogations, conversations with recruited laborers and soldiers, regular talks with locals at the East Gate Market, and even eavesdropping on locals' conversations in the East Gate's teahouses, they had gathered a vast amount of useful data. Since Zhang Youfu had frequent contact with the Executive Committee and was planned as the key figure for opening cooperation with local classes, the Security Team had gathered considerable information about him.

Zhang Youfu himself, as an impoverished landlord, was economically negligible. His status in Lingao came entirely from his connections with various coastal pirate groups. The man was shrewd, capable, and eloquent. All parties were satisfied with him as a liaison.

Such a multifaceted character was useful to the transmigrators—they could pass many messages through him. But they also had to guard against him.

Wen Desi continued drinking and chatting with Zhang Youfu. Zhang felt honored—having attached himself to the baldies, would he not be comfortable here from now on? He enthusiastically matched drinks. The atmosphere at the table was warm.

Over drinks, to show he was "valuable," he quietly told Wen and Xi that actually most gentry supported their "joint militia defense" proposal. Especially the small and medium villages that could not afford large militia forces—they hoped to pay a small price for rural security. At minimum, it would buy peace, avoiding the fate of the Gou Manor. Big fortresses like the Huang stronghold were more ambivalent. Zhang Youfu said Old Huang had stayed quiet during the gentry discussions but, when asked his opinion, agreed—though adding that villages should not place all their hopes on "you people." They should control their own young men. Otherwise, if all forces were controlled by others...

Xi Yazhou nodded silently. This old fogey had some vision.

Zhang Youfu, seeing their interest, embellished further. He described how Huang Shoutong was intensively drilling militia and stockpiling grain in his fortress. This year after the harvest, except for mandatory tax payments, he had sold nothing, storing everything inside. He had even had tenants repair the fortress walls during the winter slack season. "Probably has some plan."

Wen Desi knew Zhang Youfu had connections with pirates, which Huang Shoutong had always despised. Several times Huang had nearly arrested him for pirate collusion, only stopped by gentry opposition. Zhang was taking the opportunity to badmouth him. But his words were probably true. Huang Shoutong was someone they admired. From collected materials, he was quite loyal and righteous by this spacetime's standards. Such a man would not easily submit.

"Besides him, who else opposes?"

"A few poor scholars. The most active is Liu the Cripple."

"Liu the Cripple?" This puzzled them. They roughly knew Lingao's scholars, degree-holders, gentry, and landlords by name and nickname. They had never heard of anyone called this.

"That's Liu Dalin." Zhang Youfu was a true market character, with no reverence whatsoever for Lingao's only historical *jinshi*. He had simply nicknamed him for his disability.

"The *jinshi* Liu."

"Right, him." Clearly Zhang Youfu had grievances against Liu *jinshi* too. "Relying on being a *jinshi*, he insists—" He suddenly realized he had said too much. He quickly added: "This Liu Dalin keeps saying things like 'no compromise with traitors' and scolding gentry for 'bargaining with tigers' and 'serving tigers' and such. Always tigers."

So Lingao's exemplary figure had quite a negative opinion of them. Wen Desi and Xi Yazhou exchanged glances, smiling bitterly. Per their plans, Liu Dalin was a key figure to cultivate. His stance would largely influence local scholars' and gentry's attitudes. But now, recruiting him seemed very difficult.

Wen Desi asked more about Liu Dalin. He learned Liu was a *juren* from the 43rd year of Wanli. After passing, he had traveled to the mainland for further study, reportedly to Jiangxi, becoming a disciple of a former Hanlin Academy editor. Four years later he passed the *jinshi* examination. Appointed magistrate of some Anhui county, he became paralyzed shortly after passing, never taking office, returning home to live in seclusion.

(Note: Liu Dalin *jinshi*'s biography comes from Lingao cultural history. The Jiangxi study claim is legendary and unverifiable.)

With wine loosening tongues, Zhang Youfu revealed personal grudges: he had once disputed water rights over hillside land with a neighbor. Using his connections, he had hired local ruffians to injure the other party. Normally, commoners could only accept their loss. Unfortunately, the victim was Liu *jinshi*'s relative. One calling card sent to the yamen, and Zhang Youfu was arrested and given forty strokes. Though his yamen connections spared him the worst, this public flogging with trousers removed was a grudge he nursed.

Both silently laughed. But this showed something: Liu *jinshi* was not above human concerns. Since he looked after relatives, he was still reasonable and approachable. Their greatest fear was Hai Rui types: neither soft nor hard approaches worked, acknowledging neither kin nor reason, stubborn as stone, fixed on one principle. You cannot recruit them, cannot attack them, cannot kill them, and you must pretend to magnanimously accept their curses.

"Does Liu *jinshi* have militia?"

"Where would he get militia? Just some household guards." Zhang Youfu, thinking the transmigrators intended to move against Liu *jinshi*, became even more helpful. He said Liu's residence was not far—just seven or eight *li* to the city's West Gate. He lived inside the West Gate. But he had a manor outside the city, three or four *li* from the West Gate, where he sometimes stayed ten days to half a month.

Wen Desi noted this in his notebook. Zhang Youfu was pleased, becoming ever more attentive. Meanwhile, Wen Desi asked about his relationship with the Liu Xiang organization—according to collected data, his connection with Liu Xiang seemed closest.

Zhang Youfu did not hide it. His wife was related to a "steward" in the Liu Xiang organization. Both were from Qiongshan County. That "steward's" family still lived in Qiongshan. Communicating through this channel was convenient and safe.

"Can you relay a message to Chief Liu for us?" Xi Yazhou asked.

"Certainly! You honor me." Zhang Youfu was quite agreeable.

"Tell him to send someone to negotiate," Xi Yazhou said. "Let's prioritize peace. As long as we can sit down and talk, we'll let bygones be bygones."

"Good. I'll send word tomorrow." Zhang Youfu agreed readily. Host and guests enjoyed themselves. Zhang Youfu also tried to inquire about the transmigrators' origins, but Wen Desi deflected with pre-prepared standard answers. Clearly Zhang Youfu was not convinced, but that did not matter.

They left Zhang Youfu's around 11 PM. Declining the sedan chairs, the group walked back. Lingao's winter nights were slightly cool but not cold. Walking through the countryside was quite pleasant. Looking up, they saw the sky was filled with stars. Such beauty was impossible to see through the polluted atmosphere of the other spacetime. Yet normally, they rarely had the opportunity to stargaze. Having established themselves precariously, the transmigrators faced threats everywhere in the darkness. After dark, except for the guards, everyone withdrew to safe fortresses and buildings.

Now, Wen Desi instinctively felt the most dangerous time had passed. In these three months, transmigrators had built a brand-new city with their own hands, constructed a hydropower station, produced this spacetime's first batch of cement, raised buildings, paved streets, and even used biogas for cafeteria cooking. Modernity was beginning to sprout in this spacetime. Everyone was alive. Labor and regular living had actually made them healthier. The transmigrator group had fought bloody battles, repulsed enemy attacks, expanded their sphere from Bopu's beach to both banks of the Wenlan River's lower reaches, and controlled the salt fields. Critical transportation, energy, and industrial facilities were under construction. Nobody doubted that once completed, their power would grow geometrically.

The transmigrators had firmly established themselves here. People were slowly beginning to trust them, willing to interact and serve. Now the transmigrator group was no longer satisfied with purely commercial and employment interactions. They would gradually adopt administrative methods to control and manage Lingao's manpower and resources.

"Mr. Wen, isn't Spring Festival almost here?"

"I'd have forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it. It's already 1629. Nobody even celebrated New Year."

"What day is it now?"

"December 26th of Chongzhen Year One. The solar calendar is already January 19th, 1629."

"Let's have a proper Spring Festival. Everyone's been busy for over three months without a single quiet day."

For transmigrators, celebrating New Year was not particularly important. Though the Executive Committee had posted notices announcing seven consecutive days off starting New Year's Eve, work had not slowed as the year-end approached. The other spacetime's phenomenon of nominally being on holiday from the first but effectively slacking off from December 20th did not exist here. When everyone knew their work was building their own future, work became pleasure rather than drudgery—something they had never felt in the old spacetime.

Joint Defense Assembly preparations were also proceeding intensively. Not just transmigrators—even Zhang Youfu had become busy, constantly running around to talk to various villages. Wu De gave locally domiciled laborers a few days off to go home for New Year, incidentally promoting the assembly's necessity to village elders. Since it was nearly Spring Festival with everyone preparing celebrations, the assembly would be delayed until after the holiday. The Executive Committee thought this was fine—they could use the assembly to promote agricultural reform. It would kill two birds with one stone. The final meeting date was set for February 1, 1629—the 9th day of the first month, Chongzhen Year Two.

New Year's Eve arrived. To let all transmigrators enjoy this spacetime's first Spring Festival, besides the holiday, each transmigrator received extra special supply vouchers. Within dozens of *li* around Bairen Fortress, poor villagers had all benefited from trading with or working for the transmigrators, becoming somewhat better off. The autumn harvest avoided storm damage. Conditions were not bad. There were no pirate or bandit incursions. The normally bleak and difficult "lean year" actually showed signs of prosperity. Nearly every household posted spring couplets; some hung peach charms. Previously depressed villages now had smoke rising from every chimney. Even children's sallow faces showed some life.

Within a hundred *li*, every village sent New Year gifts to the transmigrator group. Pigs, sheep, rice, wine, chickens, ducks, fish, and meat filled East Gate's trading hall. Dugu Qiuhun and Dongmen Chuiyu beamed—though they could only look, as Dai Xie ultimately carted everything away.

This New Year was celebrated with light hearts, full of victorious joy and confidence. Everyone saw unlimited prospects ahead. The nervous first three months were beginning to change. If on D-Day their confidence in success was not quite complete, now they all believed their future was bright. Spirits soared.

Family dormitory doors all had spring couplets, bringing festivity to Bairen Fortress. Someone even requested the Chemistry Team make firecrackers—they had a firecracker craftsman available. But the proposal was rejected. Soon, someone discovered firecrackers were sold in Lingao county seat. So from New Year's Eve morning, people boldly went to buy firecrackers. Then firecracker-buying became a "Lingao County One-Day Tour"—most transmigrators had not entered this nearby Ming county seat since D-Day. With the situation improved and New Year leisure, everyone wanted to sightsee. The gate runners and militia naturally did not dare block them. Fortunately, transmigrators had a good local reputation, so the crowds did not cause panic—rather, many idlers and children came to watch. Everyone finally understood the foreigners' situation in the early days of Reform and Opening Up China.

Besides a few history enthusiasts excitedly taking pictures of everything, most were disappointed. This county seat was worse than small modern towns. There were few shops. Though it was New Year with every house posting couplets and many peddlers on the streets, bringing holiday cheer, most buildings along the streets were dilapidated. Anything relatively tidy was either a government office or a temple. Stranger still, this city—small enough to see from East Gate to West Gate—still had large tracts of wasteland inside.
