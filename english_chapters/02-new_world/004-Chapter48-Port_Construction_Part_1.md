# Chapter 48: Port Construction (Part 1)

From an outsider's perspective, the start of D-Day was both chaotic and spectacular. In the bay—still preserving its primeval subtropical seascape—small boats puttered everywhere. Ship derricks continuously raised and lowered cargo. Dense crowds descended from the enormous freighter via boarding ladders. On the beach, signs of different colors stood everywhere, indicating landing zones for personnel, vehicles, and equipment; cargo staging areas; liaison points; registration stations; and more.

The entire port camp expanded outward from the Bopu Patrol Office and its adjacent beacon tower. From a port-development standpoint, this location wasn't ideal—mangroves extended to the water's edge, and the area wasn't sufficiently open. But the patrol office's ready-made buildings and the beacon tower as an artificial high point were valuable advantages. Though the Ming soldiers had fled, another life form gave the transmigrators minor trouble.

Shortly after the Military Group occupied the building at dawn—search still incomplete—several people had fled the structure covered in flea bites. Old brick-and-timber buildings bred vermin; fleas and bedbugs were standard residents. Before DDT and lindane were mass-produced in the 1940s, parasites had been permanent occupants of old structures, especially wooden ones. In 1945, Naples, Italy had even experienced a typhus outbreak spread by fleas—only halted when American forces sprayed massive amounts of DDT to eliminate the hosts. Only after that did most world cities finally escape these age-old parasitic pests.

As head of the Health Group, Shi Niaoren had anticipated this in the sanitation plan. The epidemic-prevention team followed immediately behind the landing force—full protective suits, high boots, masks, goggles, backpack sprayers. The Military Group thought of Unit 731 watching these people enter the buildings and spray furiously.

The Medical and Health Group used six percent wettable lindane mixed into a 150× water suspension, spraying every corner and furnishing, then sealing doors and windows for thirty minutes to eliminate fleas, bedbugs, and other pests. All old junk inside—mats, bedding, clothes—was hauled to the beach and burned. The few Military Group members who'd entered were unceremoniously doused head-to-toe with the solution, then sent back to the ship to bathe. Each received a special orange-red tag from the Health Group—meaning "light contamination."

After thirty minutes of fumigation then an hour's ventilation, the Landing Command immediately occupied the patrol office's three-bay central hall as their office. The side rooms—former barracks—were similarly cleaned to serve as the computer room and valuable-goods storage.

The rooms still reeked of lindane. But for the command post, this was nothing. The radio was set up; maps spread on the table. Soon, powered by battery banks, the server began operating. A wireless LAN was established; via signal-amplifier antenna, all landing and unloading points' laptops could exchange data directly with the server. A tide of data began flowing in: the Personnel Group established registration points at each landing site, recording arrivals; the Planning Committee stationed scanning personnel at unloading and staging points, logging equipment and material intake and output.

On the *Fengcheng*, transmigrators assigned to various groups were queuing to disembark team by team per Personnel Group's schedule. The knockoff American backpacks were crushing—this was just issued gear; personal luggage remained in the hold—last priority for unloading.

The ship's PA repeatedly broadcast Executive Order 16280002:

> 1. All actions follow commands. No unauthorized actions.
>
> 2. Without permission, no one may cross camp perimeter. Those with task requirements must register at guard checkpoints when crossing.
>
> 3. No relieving oneself or discarding trash randomly. Trash must be sorted and disposed in designated pits.
>
> 4. Food and water must only be obtained from designated supply points. No unauthorized hunting, fishing, or eating wild game.
>
> 5. Anyone noticing physical abnormalities in themselves or others should immediately seek help at medical stations.

To use labor efficiently and avoid some people working while others idled, the Landing Command invented an armband system:

- **Red**: Military Group guard personnel
- **Blue**: Ship duty and crew (white circle in center with characters for vessel type: "Freighter," "Barge," "Fishing," "Landing," "Boat," "Misc." Those unable to work—sick, children—wore blue with "Misc.")
- **White**: Technical specialists for D-Day construction
- **Yellow**: Command and administrative personnel under Landing HQ
- **White with numbers**: "Basic labor force"—four-digit numbers printed. All basic laborers self-organized into five-person teams, each with a four-digit code. Team leaders received a team workbook; each new assignment was recorded, along with issued tools and equipment.

Labor dispatch was centrally managed by the Personnel Group. In their tent, a large table held a pre-printed large-scale map of the Lingao Cape–Bopu Port area, covered with transparent overlay. Each specialist group and labor team was represented by different-colored numbered cards, placed in their current work area. Based on task type, dispatchers clipped intensity markers to the cards: one hairpin for light, two for medium, three for heavy—to balance workloads across teams.

Though simple, this visual system paired with the OA labor-management module let Personnel know every team's current task, location, and workload—even what tools and materials each had received. This greatly facilitated labor deployment and management.

On the bay's southern beach, a large military tent had been erected. A sign out front read in wobbly painted characters: "Bopu Port Zone Construction Command." Here gathered all the transmigrators' technical personnel in architecture, planning, design, and hydrology. Their just-completed Project One was already in operation—all manner of construction equipment and materials were continuously unloading via the floating dock. With this material foundation, port-zone construction could now fully commence.

Inside the tent: a conference table and folding chairs from the ship, laptops, and many bound hydrographic data volumes. Though technical experts of all kinds were present, all eyes focused on four people studying the map:

**Bing Feng**, 27—a hairy young man, structural engineer with a project-manager certificate. Specialized in portal-frame steel structures and steel-frame residential design and construction.

**Yan Quezhi**, 28—chubby, a product of Chinese university education that produced generalists who knew everything but mastered nothing. Associate degree in hydrology; half-trained water-resources, hydrology, and meteorology technician. Knew surveying; could operate levels and theodolites proficiently; basic understanding of hydraulic engineering structures.

**Mei Wan**, 30—architecture graduate who'd knocked around construction companies for years as a veteran operator, specializing in cost estimation and project management. Proficient with all measuring instruments; rich experience in civil-engineering management and coordination.

**Li Xiaolu**, 30—professional planning and design specialist with architect and planner certifications. Surveying and planning were her specialties.

These were the "Four Heavenly Kings" of the Construction Engineering Group. Li Xiaolu was female, but no one matched her certifications. Still, she had little practical construction experience and disliked the limelight. So Mei Wan led the Four Heavenly Kings—after all, he'd spent the most time on job sites and knew a bit of everything.

"Command requires us to complete basic port infrastructure by nightfall: electricity, water supply, unloading area, cargo staging. Plus basic fortifications." Mei Wan relayed the orders. "We have priority access to materials, machinery, and labor."

"Group Leader Mei, we haven't even surveyed yet—can't produce a plan. I compared our archived survey data; the terrain here differs significantly from the twenty-first century." Li Xiaolü said.

"No time for precision." Mei Wan said. "Fortunately, this isn't our main base—we don't need extensive planning. Focus on small temporary projects."

"We'll survey, design, and build simultaneously." Mei Wan, the site veteran, knew all about rushing schedules. He made assignments: Li Xiaolu and Yan Quezhi would handle port-zone surveying—a task requiring both skill and physical effort, so one basic-labor team was assigned as helpers, plus a five-shot shotgun from the Military Group for protection.

Tian Jiujiu was responsible for camp water supply and drainage; Chang Kaishen handled electrification. As for Bing Feng, his task was most challenging: building cargo warehouses.

By comparison, Chang Kaishen's assignment was easier. The Committee had prepared all kinds of generators and supporting power equipment, but all still slept in containers. For a temporary port camp with few power points and light overall load—mainly lighting, command-post office equipment, and some electric unloading machinery—demands were modest.

Given these needs, this early power grid should be simple, reliable, convenient to operate, and sparing with materials. Chang Kaishen's plan: no shore-based power plant. Instead, draw power directly from the *Fengcheng*'s auxiliary engine—after anchoring, the main engine stopped, but auxiliaries ran continuously to supply ship power. The Electrical Group would run a 380V cable from the ship's distribution room, secured along the floating pontoon all the way to shore to a distribution station. The entire grid used the simplest radial configuration—common in old Chinese rural grids. Its drawback: any line fault or maintenance meant cutting power to all users on that line. But this was acceptable for now. The only equipment needing uninterrupted power was the command-post IT systems—UPS backup power plus high-capacity battery banks would suffice.

However, the actual plan to fix power cables directly on the floating pier was vetoed. The Committee worried about leakage risks and unsafe conditions, plus cables on a busy pier could be accidentally damaged. The Engineering Group revised the design: they disassembled spare floating units, strung the empty drums together with steel cables, and floated them on the water. Counterweights hung from each drum for stability. This power-line water route soon proved more useful: first an oil line was run to pump diesel from the ship; then Communications ran phone lines ashore. Now the *Fengcheng* could contact Command by direct phone call or even fax without using walkie-talkies. Best of all, IT's Shi Kai used this phone line for network connection—now all shore computers could access the ship's server bidirectionally through the Command server. The OA system achieved complete coverage.
