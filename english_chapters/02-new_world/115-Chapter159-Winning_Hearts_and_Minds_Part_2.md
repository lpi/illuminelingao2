# Chapter 159: Winning Hearts and Minds (Part 2)

"Of course you can. As long as everyone unites, none of this is a dream." Wei Aiwen began to paint a picture of the future. "Everyone's been here a month now. How's the life treating you?"

"Nothing to complain about—new clothes, good meals. Where else can you find work this good?"

"They're even giving us shoes. With the first pair, I couldn't bear to wear them—I've never had such good shoes in my life." One soldier wiped his tears. "Later, the Chief said we *had* to wear them, and that worn-out ones would be replaced. Living twenty-some years, I've never owned proper shoes..." He broke down crying and couldn't continue.

In truth, these "good shoes" weren't even cloth shoes. They were just straw sandals with cloth soles and straps made of fabric strips—only marginally more comfortable than pure straw sandals.

"But—" Wei Aiwen's tone shifted. "We poor people live well now. Will the landlords, the *qianhu* commanders, the bandits just sit back and watch us enjoy ourselves? Take your example—you thought reclaiming land in Qiongzhou meant a better life. But what was the actual result?"

Every eye widened. Wang Tao saw the timing was right and immediately ground his teeth.

"No! They won't let us keep the fruits of our labor!"

"Correct!" Wei Aiwen raised his voice. "We commoners, generation after generation, have been ground down by the gentry and officials. They live high, and when they run low on funds, they come rob us poor folk. Before, we had no backbone—we swallowed our tears. Now, with the short-hair masters supporting us, with their iron ships and fast guns, with weapons in our own hands—can we let them continue?"

"That depends on whether my gun agrees." Wang Tao struck a heroic pose in the style of Li Yuhe from *The Red Lantern*.

"We won't agree!" The crowd's emotions finally ignited. The soldiers who had enlisted from the Commune had a vested interest in this new order—most were visibly moved.

"And if they try to take it by force?"

"Then we beat the hell out of them!"

...

Wei Aiwen saw the moment was ripe. "United together, we can hold our heads high. We'll have better lives, too—no more foraging for weeds, daily white rice, fish and meat, good clothes and shoes. Everywhere we'll build multi-story buildings, install air conditioning, enjoy warm winters and cool summers. Electric lights will make rooms bright—ten thousand times better than kerosene. Children will go to school, study, receive compulsory education. Our nation will prosper—manned spaceships, hosting the Olympics! Anyway, all this will happen." Wei Aiwen secretly groaned—he'd gotten excited and let his mouth run unchecked. He'd said things he absolutely shouldn't have. Fortunately, nobody reacted to "air conditioning" or "Olympics." A life free of foraging was the most appealing part to them.

The meeting ended. Ma Qianzhu grabbed Wei Aiwen and gave him a thumbs up. "Hey, Little Wei! You're amazing! The meeting was brilliantly successful. Everyone recalling their past, filled with teeth-grinding hatred. With your approach—at the very least—they're ours now."

Wei Aiwen beamed. "Piece of cake! I've got more ideas for the future."

Inside, he was weeping: *My last Coca-Cola—traded for all this information... Yu Eshui, you beast!*

The next day, Ma Qianzhu compiled Wei Aiwen's method into materials and distributed them to company commanders for study. Wang Tao was reluctantly "discharged" from the barracks—now technically an "enlisted soldier," not a "Chief." Every company invited him to speak at their themed meetings. This corporate trainer earned his living by talking. He was an amateur *pingshu* storyteller—his tales were vivid, emotionally rich, and filled with suspense. Audiences couldn't stop listening. His scripts grew increasingly elaborate. Eventually, Ma Qianzhu had to remind him not to overdo it.

But "speaking bitterness" education alone wasn't sufficient. Based on Xi Yazhou's experience in Salt Village, Ma Qianzhu organized the compilation of a handbook centered on the transmigrators' slogan: "Eliminate tyranny, Protect borders, Secure the people."

Simultaneously, they selected active Commune soldiers and provided them with special political training.

"The core of political work is cultivating loyalty to *us*," Ma Qianzhu emphasized at the New Army officers' meeting. "Personally, I believe commoners don't necessarily love officialdom. To them, government is simply authority to be obeyed—not anything like our concept of a nation-state."

Cultivating loyalty couldn't rely on slogans. No political theory matched the defense of self-interest. After World War II, the CCP had launched massive land reform in liberated zones—capturing hearts, gaining stable bases, and securing endless manpower. That proved more effective than ten thousand lectures on class consciousness.

By providing the New Army with living standards far exceeding those of local commoners—and even their fellow Commune members—they ensured the soldiers would cherish this life and view the transmigrators as great benefactors. Once their interests were bound together, these men would fight and die for them. For the rootless, utterly alien transmigrators, tempting with benefits was the most effective and fastest method.

As for Ma Qianzhu's soldiers' committees—under transmigrator management, they had barely formed. Though many doubted the wisdom of soldier democracy—citing counter-examples throughout history—Ma Qianzhu persisted. His reason: after the Sanwan Reorganization, soldiers' committees and Party branches in every company had produced near-magical effects in transforming old armies. It was like a cheat code.

If the method had worked on Nationalist armies, then their New Army, built from scratch, would also benefit.

Naturally, Ma Qianzhu couldn't implement Party branches in the companies—the Executive Committee's right-wingers would eat him alive. But soldiers' committees operated under the protective banner of "democracy"—nobody could object. To demonstrate the committee's importance, he personally chaired the battalion-level soldiers' committee.

The soldiers' committee had five tasks: first, participate in military management; second, maintain discipline; third, oversee company finances; fourth, conduct mass work; fifth, political education for soldiers.

The structure completely imitated the Red Army era. The lowest level was at the company. Full-company soldier assemblies elected five to nine people for the company committee executive, selecting one chairman. At the battalion level, one representative per five soldiers formed the battalion soldiers' committee; eleven to thirteen people formed the battalion executive, with one chairman. This pattern continued upward. No committee had standing bodies.

The committee-military relationship: committees could only suggest or question specific issues—never directly interfere with or handle them. When soldiers met, commanders had to attend—no closed-door sessions. In wartime, commanders could suspend committee activities, preventing extreme democratization.

Currently, the transmigrator-managed committees knew nothing about democracy. "Chiefs" required elections—so they elected. What for, and how—they were completely confused. Ma Qianzhu knew this phase was merely pro forma. But he disliked the reasoning that "democracy needs foundations." Sometimes, eating half-cooked rice was necessary.

The transmigrators decided that soldiers would start with the simplest self-management: squad housekeeping, cleaning, and food management. Once soldiers' interests were protected—giving them a sense of ownership—enthusiasm would arise, and responsibility for unit construction would strengthen.

Tian Liang was released from the Bopu quarantine camp. During quarantine, he'd had daily classes in literacy and simple handicrafts. His body had grown strong. The "textbooks" delivered daily to the camp were now understandable. Tian Liang was pleased—clearly, the masters planned to promote them. At minimum, to some steward position. Otherwise, why teach slaves to read?

In his spare time, he sat with similarly aged companions behind the barbed wire, watching the training grounds' lively scenes across the water. His best friends in quarantine were three brothers, all surnamed Ruan—renamed Ruan Xiao'er, Ruan Xiaowu, and Ruan Xiaoqi after arrival.

By now, even fools realized that the slave-buying masters weren't ordinary gentry. What landlord trained private armies like this? He had seen village militia before—during his wanderings he'd suffered at their hands, watched them robbing lone merchants on the roads. But those yokels couldn't compare with the men drilling on those grounds. Tian Liang had even seen garrison troops drilling in Guangzhou—supposedly elite regulars. Yet he still found them inferior to these soldiers.

These soldiers had shaved heads and short jackets. Everything about them was efficient and sharp. Formation marching was perfectly aligned—even legs were raised in straight lines. They drilled with constant chanting. It was eye-opening, yet strange: the soldiers carried wooden sticks. Could such wealthy masters not afford spears?

Strangest of all: there was no rain, yet constant thunder rumbled across the sky. Sometimes it went on all day without stopping. Later he learned it was the masters firing cannons. The masters had *cannons*? It grew increasingly puzzling.

Finally, one day, he was called up with his belongings. Assignments were coming.

Boys under thirteen went to "Primary School"—reportedly for studying. Tian Liang, at fifteen, wasn't eligible. Those over thirteen with good arithmetic skills or other talents went to "Technical School." Their group, lacking special talents, was swept into the "Military-Political School."

This school, proposed by Ma Qianzhu, had no buildings. The children were all issued uniforms and assigned to the Training Battalion's "Cadet Squad"—also marching with adults and carrying wooden sticks.

Tian Liang wanted to know where Guo Fu was assigned—but girls' assignments were handled on different days. Later he learned from the food-delivery aunty that girls under thirteen also went to Primary School. Older girls went to Technical School.

"I heard that after learning skills at school, they become maids for 'Chiefs.'" The aunty seemed envious. "Blessed children!"
