# Chapter 64: Desperate Fight

Guo Yi threw himself flat onto the rocky ground. A stone jabbed his chest, knocking the wind out of him. Under mortal threat, human potential was astonishing. After several rolls, he had scrambled behind a large boulder. In that minute or less, he had glimpsed Salina apparently hit by an arrow, collapsed and motionless.

Xue Ziliang's reaction was even faster—probably because his size made him an obvious target. Most arrows flew toward him; in an instant, he had taken four or five hits. Guo Yi only saw him crawling across the pebbly ground like a fish, one hand throwing off his backpack while the other grabbed Salina's pack strap and dragged her over. Arrows kept raining down, though the aim had gotten worse.

"Guo, shoot!" Xue Ziliang yelled while pulling the wounded woman. His face twisted with exertion, terrifying Guo Yi into action. He was ultimately a desk worker—slower reactions. Having just recovered his wits, he raised his pistol toward the arrows' source and fired several shots. In the chaos, he could not count how many. From the grass came agonized screams.

Using this opening, Xue Ziliang had already hoisted Salina onto his back and was sprinting, bent low. Guo Yi hurried to follow. Amid the panic, he felt someone push him from behind—probably hit by an arrow—but he did not dare look.

From nearby trees and brush, over a dozen people burst out and charged, wielding six- or seven-foot white wooden poles, swinging wildly. Caught off guard, Guo Yi took many blows. Fortunately, his backpack absorbed much of the force. He fired twice and dropped one attacker, driving the others back.

"Charge forward!" Xue Ziliang roared, snatching up a fallen white pole—its owner, strangely dressed, writhed and moaned on the ground. Though carrying someone, his confidence in his strength kept him from panic. The arrows he had taken had either been stopped by his vest or missed vital areas. He knew retreating meant certain death; only charging forward might break through.

Guo Yi had been clubbed on the head and was now dizzy. Worse, in the chaos, he had emptied and dropped his pistol. But seeing a man in a blue robe ahead, waving a long sword and directing the crowd to block and pursue them, his spirit suddenly rallied. With a war cry, he charged straight at the man. The blue-robed figure did not dodge, swinging his blade to meet him. In that instant, Guo Yi's mind rang—*Is this a period drama?* The man clearly wore his hair in a topknot and dressed in a traditional long robe. Hesitating, the opponent's blade had already slashed down, hitting his shoulder blade. The agony nearly made him drop his pole. Several others rushed in, beating him with white sticks. Guo Yi fell, desperately shielding his head while swinging his pole to resist. Despite the terror, his mind was crystal clear—*They are going to beat me to death!*

In that moment of despair, he heard a thunderous roar:

"Son of a bitch!"

The head of one attacker in front of him suddenly split open—brains, blood, and bone fragments flying everywhere, spattering all over Guo Yi. That red-and-white spray would remain vivid in his memory decades later.

Xue Ziliang, having run ahead, saw his companion trapped and rushed back, setting down Salina. Coming from behind, one pole strike shattered a man's skull. The others, seeing this ferocious newcomer, panicked. Guo Yi seized the moment, rolling and scrambling over.

But these attackers did not scatter. Someone shouted something unintelligible, and over a dozen regrouped and charged again. Xue Ziliang, pausing to lift Salina onto his back, was caught—taking several blows, but all landing on Salina. The woman cried out; blood sprayed from her mouth onto Xue Ziliang's face.

Seeing Xue Ziliang burdened and about to fall, Guo Yi ignored his own pain, swinging his pole to intercept. The front attackers rained blows like falling rain. Facing life and death, Guo Yi fought like a madman, wielding his pole and forcing them back several steps.

His composure returned somewhat. These opponents were gaunt and haggard—smaller in build. His courage rose. Seeing their chaotic, uncontrolled swings, he steadied himself and employed the bayonet drill from his military training. As they fell back in confusion, he surged forward with a powerful thrust. Though the pole had no bayonet tip, this full-force blow shattered the opponent's jaw and nose. The man screamed, fell, and rolled on the ground clutching his face, wailing.

The blue-robed man shouted something while leading another charge, slashing at Guo Yi's face. Guo Yi sidestepped, executing a "parry left flank strike"—the pole's butt end smashing into the blue-robed man's face. In a flash, amid a scream, an eye—black and white—flew out.

The dozen-odd attackers, seeing Guo Yi blood-soaked and fierce, and watching him drop their leader with one blow, lost their nerve. With a shout, they dragged the blue-robed man and fled in disarray. Many years later, locals still vividly recounted how Guo Yi and Xue Ziliang, one against many, beat their attackers into panicked retreat with nothing but two wooden poles.

"Way to go! Guo, you are like Bruce Lee!" *(Note: Li Xiaolong's English name.)*

Guo Yi weakly waved a hand and collapsed on the ground, gasping heavily. In all his years in the security services, on all his missions, he had never experienced this heart-pounding brush with death. Now, his tension released, his whole body ached. His face was wet—touching it, it was blood. Whose blood, he did not know.

"Guo, let us go—they might come back!" Xue Ziliang called.

"I need to check something!" Guo Yi said. Using his pole as a cane, he limped toward the fallen bodies. He wanted to search these strange people—and hopefully recover his pistol.

After another kilometer, all three were at their limits. Wounds hurt increasingly; no one seemed to be pursuing. They decided to hide, rest, bandage wounds, then figure out what to do. Ahead, the river curved sharply, forming a rocky shoal. Water tumbled over stones with a thunderous roar. They found a secluded spot by the bank—a stone cave amid the boulder pile, surrounded by tall grass and dense woods. Others would hardly notice.

Xue Ziliang used a rubber water bag to fetch river water, washing off blood and examining wounds. Though he had taken arrows like a porcupine, none had actually pierced flesh—most struck his backpack; the rest were stopped by his bulletproof vest. Besides scrapes from rolling on the ground, he had no wounds. He had taken the fewest pole strikes.

Guo Yi had also been hit by several arrows. Fortunately, he had worn his stab-proof vest from the start. Only one arrow hit his arm—but the thick combat uniform had cushioned it, so it barely penetrated. A slight tug and it came out. Xue Ziliang shook his head at the rusty arrowhead, applying antiseptic from the first-aid kit.

"Guo, you need a tetanus shot," he said. "The wound is not deep, but this arrowhead..."

"I know—nothing we can do now..." Guo Yi was exhausted and aching all over. Tetanus was not the only concern: his head had a gash that should probably be sutured—for now, just cleaned, disinfected, and bandaged. The saber blow to his shoulder had been stopped by the vest, but now he could not raise his arm—he did not know if bones or tendons were damaged. He had taken many pole blows; he feared broken bones or internal injuries. Fortunately, nothing felt abnormal during the walk.

Salina's condition was worse. She had one arrow wound in her leg—luckily, her knee guard's strap had deflected it, so it was not deep. But while being carried on Xue Ziliang's back, she had essentially served as a human shield, taking several blows to her back—apparent internal injuries. The problem was her fever—probably from a cold. The first-aid kit had fever reducers; Xue Ziliang dissolved some in water and fed them to her.

Outside, drizzle began falling. The cave was small; with Salina lying down, their legs stuck out. Xue Ziliang found waterproof sheets in his pack and covered each person.

Guo Yi's head throbbed; his mind was in turmoil. Beyond the life-and-death crisis, that fight brought other troubles. These people—their clothes and appearance—were unmistakably ancient. At first, he had held skepticism. He pulled at a corpse's topknot—it was real hair, not a wig. Their crude clothes and weapons could not be TV props. The leader's saber was genuine iron—not a machine-stamped steel prop.

The dead had little on them—just copper coins and odds and ends. Guo Yi examined the coins: roughly "Tianqi Tongbao." What year was Tianqi? He could not remember—just that Tianqi was Chongzhen's older brother, the Ming's second-to-last emperor. Almost every corpse carried a small pouch containing a curved piece of metal, a stone, and some loose cotton-like plant material. Guo Yi studied these for a long time, clueless.

"This is a fire striker." Xue Ziliang leaned over.

"What?"

"A fire striker." He adjusted his waterproof sheet. "You are Chinese—this is your ancestors' fire-making tool."

"Damn—your ancestors were Chinese too..." Guo Yi swore, then asked: "How do you know?"

"The New York Metropolitan Museum has one on display. I have seen it. Look—" Xue Ziliang took the fire striker and flint. Holding the flint in his left hand with tinder pressed between stone and fingers, he gripped the striker in his right and struck the blade against the stone, producing many sparks. "I have never practiced, but the museum demonstrator could light the tinder in just a few strikes. Quite magical."

Guo Yi felt a chill crawl up his spine.
