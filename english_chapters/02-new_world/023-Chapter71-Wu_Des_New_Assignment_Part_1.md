# Chapter 71: Wu De's New Assignment (Part 1)

The officials and gentry remained uneasy. They dispatched a letter to Regional Commander Tang at Qiongshan, testing whether he might be persuaded to come suppress the pirates.

The harassment tactics that *Jinshi* Liu had pinned his hopes on received no support from the various village militia commanders. The militiamen were not willing to fight. Hearing that even the Huang family militia—despite outnumbering their opponents in an ambush—had been defeated, morale sank even lower.

Magistrate Wu alternated between threats and promises, but the militiamen still refused to go. They had their own reasoning: these newcomers had landed without apparently robbing, killing, or burning—even if they built roads to attack the city, that was the county seat's problem. What did that have to do with them? If they attacked, might they not anger the pirates and invite retaliation? The militia's homes were all in the countryside, unlike the officials who could hide behind city walls. When finally pressured into going, they would make a distant circuit and return. As for the village commanders—unless their homes and properties were near the county seat—they had little enthusiasm. The militiamen were either fellow clansmen or their own tenant farmers and farmhands. If they died fighting, who would work the land? Lingao's greatest shortage was labor. So no one seriously drove the militia to fight.

The frequent militia appearances along the construction route drew the attention of dispatched scouts. With the beach camp now established and requiring fewer guards, the Military Group—except for a three-man observation post below Lingao County—deployed all other members to guard the road-building site.

Along the road sections, watchtowers were built every three kilometers. Each tower had lookouts equipped with high-powered binoculars and walkie-talkies. Below the towers, the guard team built simple fortifications: earthen walls man-height, surrounded by barbed wire. Inside were 4WD farm vehicles and motorcycles, plus a 2-watt radio. Motorcycles patrolled between points along the site. If an enemy attack was detected anywhere, the farm vehicle served as rapid transport to deploy reinforcements.

Soldiers alone were not enough—they had to mobilize the masses. The construction crew was issued a batch of SKS rifles and ammunition, ensuring each work point had four or five armed workers besides the Military Group guard. If sudden attacks occurred, work points could defend themselves.

"If you are attacked, do not panic or run. Report, then open fire where you stand—understood?" He Ming instructed the supervisors at each point. "The mobile team will arrive within five minutes. If another point is attacked, just report promptly."

This meant small scouting militia could not even approach the site during daylight. Any suspicious figures detected would be reported immediately to construction HQ, which would dispatch patrol off-road motorcycles to investigate. Guards did not even need to shoot—the roaring motorcycle engines alone were enough to send the enemy fleeing in panic. Sometimes enthusiastic motorcyclists would chase for long distances, until the quarry collapsed from exhaustion and could be captured. If Beiwei had not worried about being lured into ambushes and banned pursuits, they could have caught more. Interrogations produced incomprehensible gibberish. They radioed for Xiong Buyou to come interpret. Fortunately, the Lingao dialect had not changed much over centuries. After much effort, they understood these men had been ordered to scout—beyond that, just the usual pleas about elderly mothers and young children.

From the prisoners, the transmigrators roughly understood that their road-building had thrown the county seat into panic, with day-and-night preparations for a siege. That road-building could frighten people surprised the Committee. They had expected some preparations to expel them; evidently Lingao's Ming officials and gentry feared them more. This firsthand intelligence gave the Committee great confidence.

The prisoners were too few to bother releasing. But the Committee saw this as an opportunity—a rehearsal for future large-scale use of local labor. All were kept.

The alarm clock's ringing woke Wu De from sleep. One look at the clock: 9 AM.

He had been on night watch until 4 AM before sleeping. Now he could barely open his eyes. But arriving in ancient times was not a vacation—it was "making a living." Sleep any longer and there might not even be food to eat.

As commander of the fishing boat squadron, Wu De could have slept on the better-equipped fishing vessels. But with the Military Group shorthanded, naval personnel had to pull shifts ashore.

Years in the military plus growing up in a fishing family, then working in a city after discharge—his rich experience gave him many survival skills. He found the Committee's unified tents too small and crowded. He negotiated with the Medical Group, found a clearing in the woods nearby, and got about ten wooden poles under three meters from the logging yard. He tied one end together with rope, spread the other ends into the ground, covered around with canvas, left an opening for entry, then added reeds on top. An Indian-style teepee prototype appeared. He dug drainage ditches around it, lined the floor with sand and wood ash—a decent shelter emerged. The riverside-coastal location was nice; he could also keep an eye on his four fishing boats.

To save fuel, two of the fishing squadron's four boats were kept ready for immediate deployment; the other two were mothballed. One fished—the Longhao Bay area was rich in fish, shrimp, and even edible seaweed like kelp. Wu Nanhai had been running back and forth on the fishing boat lately, photographing everything caught and taking notes.

The other served as backup, with a crew always aboard, ready to respond to seaborne threats.

This morning, Wu De took an aluminum pot of wood ash to the river, scrubbed his face, bit a tender willow twig into a brush, and cleaned his teeth. Night shift plus watchtower repair yesterday—no sleeping bag—his body was starting to ache, nose stuffed, head hurting.

*Am I getting a cold?* A worrying thought crossed his mind.

He felt his forehead—no fever, thankfully. He snapped off some willow twigs, peeled the bark, and chewed it. Willow bark was rich in salicylic acid. Though hard on the stomach, it was quite effective for headaches and minor fevers.

Coming to the river bathing area, he stripped and got in. Yesterday had been too exhausting—no bath at all. Given current sanitation conditions, not bathing regularly meant skin diseases. This all-natural open-air bathhouse was another civil project the Construction Group had completed on D+1—a shallow sandy-bottomed river cove near the mouth, with barrier nets at the opening, debris and silt cleared out, riverbanks covered with sand from the beach. They had originally planned screens, but that was too much trouble. Every day after 5–6 PM quitting time, hordes of naked men splashing around was quite a spectacle. Wu De, on rotating shifts, had missed this fun. Supposedly bathing naked together fostered male bonding—he should find a chance to bathe with Commissioner Ma and the others sometime.

Morning water was a bit cold. Wu De shivered. After wetting his body and hair, he washed with soap. Finished bathing, he used wood ash to wash underwear and socks—critical hygiene matters! He was reluctant to use much soap. Though soap-making was not complicated technology, given the current chaos, there would be no soap factory anytime soon. He wrung out the clothes and hung them on nearby trees.

The camp cafeteria operated twenty-four hours. He had no interest in crowds. Besides, the cafeteria had nothing worth eating: kelp soup, boiled squid, boiled shellfish, boiled shrimp, boiled crab... basically all boiled seafood. At first everyone was interested—even argued over crab sizes. After three or four days, everyone was getting sick of it. Last night someone made a pot of instant noodles and attracted a crowd drooling with envy—tired of seafood, craving instant noodles. How times changed.

Wu De did not mind seafood as meals—he just despised the cafeteria cooks for ruining good ingredients. He went directly to a bay outside camp. The shoreline rocks were covered with oysters and barnacles. *Good stuff...* He pulled out a small knife and pried off a few dozen—not too many. These shellfish died when taken from water, and dead shellfish stank. Eating rotten ones meant diarrhea severe enough to black out. Even living near the infirmary, he could not risk that. He sat on the rocks, cracked open the shells, ate all the meat and juices. *So fresh*—farmed stuff could not compare.

Back at his shelter, he pulled on underwear from his pack—only because some women wandered the beach; otherwise he would prefer going naked to dry faster. His thermos was empty. In previous days he had boiled his own water. The machine-condensed water piped from the ships had an indescribable taste, which luckily some tea leaves masked. Recently the cafeteria had started water service—24-hour boiled water was Wu De's favorite service, if a bit heavy on chlorine.

He made a pot of strong tea in the kitchen, feeling much better. *Wonder if Lingao produces tea—even if not, such a basic crop should be covered by the Agriculture Group, right?*

"Chief Wu, want to try the Cafeteria Office's newest product?" A cook brought over something black.

"What is this?"

"Smoked fish. Top-quality fish meat—smoked all night. Definitely tasty."

Unable to refuse the kind offer, he accepted. This fish had been smoked all night; moisture and oil were nearly gone. The outside was blackened, hard to touch—appearance horrifying.

The fish looked horrifying; it tasted even worse. This so-called "smoked fish" had not been salt-cured before smoking. Who knew what wood they had used—it tasted just like the willow he had been chewing. With hot tea, he barely forced it down.

After eating, he chugged tea to suppress the urge to vomit.

"How is it? Good flavor, right?"

"Brother, what did you do before?" Wu De asked with difficulty.

"Me? I studied bioengineering. I am Hu Yicheng." This former lumberjack, skilled at animal dissection, had infiltrated the cafeteria to practice his dissection techniques.
