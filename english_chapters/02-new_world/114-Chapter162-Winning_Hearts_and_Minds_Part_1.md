# Chapter 162: Winning Hearts and Minds (Part 1)

The New Army had been training for half a month. Ma Qianzhu noticed that Wei Aiwen showed no sign of starting political training and grew anxious. "Little Wei, when will you begin political training? You've been with your company for two weeks now. The other companies started days ago. You're supposed to be the Training Battalion's demonstration company—you need to lead by example!"

Wei Aiwen smiled confidently. "Chief of Staff Ma, relax. Tonight we're holding a meeting. Satisfaction guaranteed."

"Really? You'd better do it well." Ma Qianzhu was skeptical but didn't press further.

In truth, Wei Aiwen hadn't been idle. To ensure good results, he had racked his brains. Besides integrating deeply with the company and getting to know the soldiers' situations, he had conducted "reconnaissance" by observing what political training looked like in the other companies. He found that it mostly consisted of dry lectures—leaders' speeches, political reports—combined with classroom instruction and heavy-handed literacy campaigns. A sudden inspiration struck him: why not try some "retro-innovation"?

Darkness fell, and stars sparkled across the canopy of night. Unlike the twenty-first-century cities where streetlights and glowing windows washed out the sky until only the brightest stars remained visible, here there was no light pollution and no smog. The camp had no lights—nobody dared waste precious electricity. There was little to do after dark, and the farmers retired early. Complete darkness covered everything. A half-moon rising in the east cast silvery radiance across the land. Overhead, the Milky Way stretched from east to west as a brilliant band, countless stars clustered so densely—especially within that luminous river—that their three-dimensional depth was visible to the naked eye. Wei Aiwen gazed upward, star-struck. City-raised kids had never seen such sights.

The recruits had assembled, huddled in an open-air circle against the chill. Lingao's subtropical climate kept winter temperatures above 20°C, making bonfires uncomfortably warm. A single kerosene lamp sat in the center. A red flame danced on its cotton wick, sending up gray-black smoke that slowly blackened the brass handle.

The firelight flickered across the soldiers' faces. Everyone was curious about this "political training" notice from the new company commander, "Chief" Wei. What would the content be?

Wei Aiwen stood and surveyed his surroundings. "Everyone has gathered here for political training—a themed company meeting. The theme is: 'Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow.' Please speak honestly and freely. Discuss your past experiences, your current situations, and imagine what your futures might hold."

The soldiers exchanged glances. What was this? Nobody knew what to do. Nobody spoke. The atmosphere went suddenly cold and very quiet.

Wei Aiwen had anticipated this. New things always needed an acceptance process. "I'll start then." He had a plan: he would use this opportunity to fabricate a tragic past. Sharing such a story would help break down the barriers between him and the soldiers.

"Let me sing first!" Wei Aiwen tilted his head slightly, gazing at the eastern moon. He took a deep breath, gathered his emotions, and began to sing softly:

*Stars fill the sky, the crescent moon gleaming bright.*
*Our company holds a meeting—pouring out our plight.*
*The evil landlord owes the poor a debt of blood,*
*Countless threads of sorrow surge like a flood.*
*Endless bitter tears hang heavy in the heart,*
*Never forget that year—when the north wind tore us apart.*
*The landlord invaded my home—thugs in a gang,*
*Said we owed him debts—with a cruel fang.*
*The landlord collecting debts—like a living King of Hell,*
*Never forget that year—when father fell ill.*
*Landlord forced labor—he coughed up blood,*
*Skin and bones thin—face like yellow mud.*
*Black-hearted landlord killed my parents dear,*
*Never forget that year—endless suffering and fear.*
*Desperate, I entered the tiger's den—herding his cattle,*
*Rising at midnight—fighting a losing battle.*
*Pitiful orphan—where to cry?*

His low voice, with its crying inflection and trembling notes, sounded like a truly plaintive wail. The soldiers felt a deep resonance. Some, remembering their own pasts, found their eyes reddening. Others softly sobbed.

Wei Aiwen himself felt a spiritual shock. This scene, this atmosphere—it filled him with an unexpected heaviness. He had originally found this song online and learned to sing it for amusement, thinking the lyrics quaintly amusing. He hadn't expected it to carry such power. Singing it back then, he hadn't felt the bleakness, the bitterness, the resentment. Watching the soldiers' reactions now, he thought: *These brothers have learned their Mandarin well.*

Someone grasped Wei Aiwen's hand—fellow transmigrator Wang Tao. A northerner, tall and imposing, he stood out among the shorter natives. He was a former corporate trainer and an excellent storyteller—a professional bullshitter, really. He had been deliberately planted in the ranks to help coordinate exactly this kind of thing. He whispered, "Captain, don't be sad. Our company is your family. Everyone here is your brother—your family."

Wang Tao choked up and couldn't continue. He sniffled, then began his own tale: "My family had about ten *mu* of land. Good land—the harvest was enough for a family of four to live on for a year. That Zhang-*juren* coveted our land—he kept insisting on buying it. My father absolutely refused. That land was the whole family's lifeline! So the landlord constantly sought opportunities to seize it. One year, our ox got loose and nibbled some grass in the landlord's graveyard. He claimed it ruined the *feng shui*. He had my father arrested and severely beaten. Father was old—he couldn't withstand it. He was carried home, and three days later—" Wang Tao's throat seemed to close up. His expression turned sorrowful, his eyes glistening. After a long pause, he recovered his voice. "Mother was already frail. With that shock—within days, she followed father." Finally, he broke. Tears rolled down his soot-stained cheeks. Wei Aiwen stared in amazement: *Brother, are you from the Beijing Film Academy or the Central Drama Academy?*

"Shortly after, our house caught fire. They accused me of arson—wanted me arrested and tried. Poor families can't win lawsuits against landlords! Panicked, we fled overnight. After reaching the county seat, I later sent someone to check on our home. Found our land had been seized by Zhang-*juren*. My little sister had been captured—made a servant in his household. He called it compensation for his losses. Later, she was sold to some unknown place. My little sister, she..." Wang Tao sobbed uncontrollably.

*Brilliant!* Watching Wang Tao's performance, Wei Aiwen secretly admired him.

A young soldier couldn't hold back any longer. "Absolutely unconscionable!"

"I worked for local Chen Yunkai as a farmhand—herding ducks." Another soldier rose, his voice bitter. "That black-hearted bastard! When a weasel snatched one duckling, he whipped me hard and then recorded in his ledger the loss of an *adult* duck. Normally I ate his family's leftovers and spoiled food—I was never full—yet he recorded good meals. When it was cold, if I got sick and couldn't work, he pretended generosity by giving me worn rags—then recorded the price of new clothes. Sometimes, burning with fever and clenching my teeth, I still herded—but he recorded sick absences! At year-end, he showed me the accounts—I actually *owed* him! I argued, but he ignored me. I cried bitterly, and he offered fake sympathy: 'Can't bear leaving me? Keep working next year.' Infuriating!" The young soldier gritted his teeth, his eyes reflecting the lamplight like shooting flames.

With that opening, the soldiers unleashed their pent-up emotions. One after another they stood, pouring forth their bitterness. Each story outdid the last in misery.

"I'm from a military household. My ancestors held *xiaoqi* rank. But for generations, we were nothing but the officers' unpaid servants! Forget brotherhood—slow work meant being beaten half-dead. Those beaten to death were just dragged out—nobody asked questions, nobody dared. Outside the garrison, one death meant an official report. Inside the garrison, we were worth no more than dead dogs. People say county magistrates are ruthless—but the darkness of the garrison is countless times worse!"

Wei Aiwen knew this man was from a military household. Wanting to reduce the soldiers' fear of regular troops, he deliberately asked, "Wasn't combat dangerous?"

"Combat?" The military household soldier smiled bitterly. "Us military households—with trousers showing our buttocks—fight whom? We're worse off than commoners. When provincial commanders recruit, commoners receive settlement money and grain. For military households, everything is stolen by the *baihu* and *qianhu* officers. Joining the garrison just means getting fed. Those who aren't favorites, who aren't relatives—some starve to death." He spat. "Only fools die for officials!"

Gaining momentum, he continued, "Regular troops—'official' sounds impressive—but they're worse than bandits. They terrorize commoners more than anyone. And when fighting comes, they're more cowardly than anyone."

"Right, right—I fled from the north." Wang Tao quickly added fuel to the fire. "I heard that in Liaodong, thousands of regulars couldn't defeat a few hundred Tartars. Worst of all: a dozen Tartars chased hundreds of soldiers—the runaways literally died of exhaustion. Under those conditions, what's the point of fighting? One kinsman of mine couldn't survive anymore—he joined the Liao garrison. Don't know now if he's alive or dead." He wiped his tears.

"Sigh—every family is the same. If officials didn't push so hard, forcing poor people to desperation, who'd take such risks? Our family traveled thousands of *li* to Qiongzhou. We thought wasteland was plentiful—that we could scrape by somehow. Didn't know farming here was even harder—no irrigation, forced to buy the landlord's water. We suffered countless times worse than in our homeland! It was a living death for the whole family—now I'm alone!"

"These masters here are good." Wang Tao exploited the opening. "I fled here as a laborer—and now I'm well-fed and well-clothed. The Masters even pay wages. The commune's best workers live in multi-story buildings!"

"Buildings? Like the short-hair masters' brick buildings? Nonsense." Someone doubted.

"Nonsense? Come with me to the Commune tomorrow!"

"If it's really true—I don't need buildings. Just a leak-proof shack—I'd be satisfied." One recruit spoke wistfully.

"It's true." A commune-enlisted soldier confirmed. "But you need worker status. That's why I enlisted—soldiers become workers."

"You also get private plots for farming." The commune soldiers especially valued the plots.

"Can we have those too?" someone asked timidly.
