# Chapter 161: Volleys and Sharpshooters

After enduring the initial physical regimen and proving they had fully adapted to military life, shooting training officially began.

Firearms—even muzzle-loading rifles—were the most powerful infantry weapons of this era. The transmigrators needed to ensure that those who wielded them were loyal and reliable.

Some soldiers couldn't tolerate such a rigorous life and requested to withdraw. These individuals were reassigned as commune laborers. However, they were required to repay double their initial costs: resettlement allowances, wages, and meals. Until this debt was cleared, they couldn't leave the commune. Beyond basic rations, they would receive no payment.

As for deserters, the transmigrators' powerful communications and night vision equipment rendered darkness and distance useless. Captured runaways were sent, without exception, to the quarries and brickworks for hard labor.

However, the situation exceeded Ma Qianzhu's expectations. The total number of deserters and those requesting discharge was fewer than twenty. The vast majority persevered.

Shooting training was led by Li Yunxing, a former provincial shooting team athlete—surprisingly, the most qualified person for the job. To prepare, he requisitioned one rifle and one hundred rounds of ammunition, spending a week shooting to master the characteristics of the Minié rifle.

The accuracy of the muzzle-loading rifle was quite good. These weapons were of pre-transmigration manufacture—made from high-quality materials, finely crafted, and properly calibrated. Li Yunxing quickly found his groove.

He started with basic posture correction—how to hold and shoulder the rifle—followed by stability training while aiming. Once everyone qualified in these basics, actual shooting practice commenced.

The day the rifles were distributed caused tremendous excitement. These guns were unlike any firearms the soldiers had ever seen. The blued barrels had a subtle, deadly luster. Every part was cleanly finished—none bore the usual roughness of local ironwork. There were gleaming three-edged bayonets in leather sheaths, and leather ammunition pouches filled with yellow paper-wrapped cartridges. There were also small golden copper pieces called "percussion caps."

The rifles felt substantial yet were lighter than the weighted training rifles. Every dimension seemed perfectly sized. Those familiar with matchlocks, three-barreled guns, or other firelocks found these rifles remarkably handy—not awkward at all.

During the first live-fire exercise, the rifles' dense smoke, acrid powder smell, and heavy recoil deeply impressed the first-time shooters. The penetration of the lead balls clean through thick wood targets made them gasp. Traditional matchlocks fired iron shot, which even thick wooden doors could often block.

To boost confidence in the weapon, Li Yunxing persuaded Ma Qianzhu to requisition a suit of iron armor from the stores. An on-site test shot at two hundred meters punched clean through the breastplate. Everyone was stunned.

"Damn—is iron armor useless now?" Lin Fu touched the smoking hole in the metal. "Fighting is going to be too easy."

"We're invincible! Just stand and shoot—nobody can charge us." The soldiers howled with excitement. Morale surged.

"'Invincible' is premature," Li Yunxing cautioned. "But we do have a huge advantage. We outrange them, shoot more accurately, and fire faster than our enemies. Cavalry and archers can't threaten us easily."

"But what if the enemy has massed cavalry? Shooting alone won't work. Maximum effective range is four hundred meters—cavalry crosses that distance in under one minute. How many shots can we fire in one minute?"

"Three or four?"

"If we're outnumbered, and within one minute everyone fires three or four shots but the enemy isn't routed—then what?"

Everyone fell silent. One man who had previously been quiet spoke up: "Use pikes to hold the line. Form a square. Pikemen on the outside protecting the musketeers inside."

"Correct—that's one method." Li Yunxing wasn't surprised; this tactic wasn't exotic. The Ming era had similar formations: pikemen covering gunners, often enhanced with war wagons. "Any better ideas?"

"Triple rank," the man continued. "Musketeers in three rows, rotating volleys. One minute becomes more than three or four shots—it becomes a continuous stream of fire."

"Excellent! Where did you learn that?" Li Yunxing was amazed. Three-rank volley fire was considered something of a transmigrator secret technique by some. He hadn't expected Ming-era people to already know it. But reconsidering: if Sengoku Japan had developed this tactic, Ming military minds wouldn't have missed it either.

"I saw the Capital garrison drilling."

"Good eye. Name?"

The man snapped to an awkward attention salute, forming a fist with his hand. "Huang Xiong, from Hejian, North Zhili."

"Good. Report to headquarters after drill."

"Yes sir!"

Shooting training was the easy part. Instilling the habit of weapon maintenance was far harder. Almost nobody realized firearms needed maintenance. After the first day's shooting—despite orders to clean—a surprise night inspection found only a few soldiers had complied.

The ancients didn't emphasize firearm maintenance. At most, cannons might be covered when left outdoors. Matchlocks were generally such low quality—more likely to wound the user than kill the enemy—that soldiers disliked them. Spending effort on maintenance was unthinkable.

Muzzle-loaders used residue-heavy black powder and paper cartridges, demanding higher maintenance standards. Li Yunxing had to enforce mandatory maintenance after every shooting session, personally teaching each soldier how to do it. Every rifle was inspected before dismissal. He then delegated this to squad leaders, creating a layered inspection system. Li Yunxing checked the squad leaders; squad leaders checked every soldier. Combined with harsh punishments, the cleaning habit was finally established—though it earned complaints: "The Chiefs are being unnecessarily fussy."

Ma Qianzhu repeatedly received reports from planted informants: "Cleaning barrels is a waste! Just dump the residue out—it still fires without cleaning."

Others said these Australian merchants were all "odd"—only knowing rigid rules. Unlike locals, who knew how to improvise.

Reading such soldier psychology reports, Ma Qianzhu was reminded of early-reform-era joint-venture Chinese employees discussing their foreign managers. The complaints were remarkably similar.

Tian Liang's shooting results were below average. Li Yunxing's standard was simple: at one hundred meters, ten shots, six on-target was passing. Tian Liang's first test: three hits. On his third retest, he barely passed.

But some excelled. The Ruan brothers all scored "good" on the first test. One former Gou Manor militiaman—Yang Zeng—scored the only "excellent": ten-for-ten.

"Great shooting!" Li Yunxing excitedly patted his shoulder.

"Thank you, Chief." Yang Zeng snapped to standard attention. "I was formerly a hunter."

"Hunter? No wonder your eyesight is good."

"No—I used similar muskets before."

"Oh?" Li Yunxing was intrigued.

"When I was a guardsman for the Gou Master—no, Gou the First—" He quickly self-corrected. "Sea pirates once delivered cargo. It included dozens of such guns." He gestured to indicate the shape. "Not as good as the Chiefs' guns—they used match-cords and were heavier."

Li Yunxing recalled: weapons captured from Gou Manor had included foreign items—some matchlocks. According to their historical experts, they were likely English.

"Those guns were far better than the manor's regular matchlocks—more accurate. But the other guardsmen feared injuries from the matchlocks and wouldn't use them. Gou the First saw I liked them, so he gave me one. I practiced shooting birds. Got familiar with it."

"Such accuracy—Gou the First must have valued you?"

Yang Zeng's face showed embarrassment. After the capture of Gou Manor, his arrival at Bairren Fortress, the repeated interrogations, and the labor reform period—having committed no heavy crimes and voluntarily surrendered—he had been assigned commune work. He had learned that these "bald bandits" or "short-hairs" or "Australian merchants" most valued clean "historical records." His history as a Gou Manor guardsman was clearly a stain.

"Reporting to Chief—" He spoke carefully. "I was just an ordinary Gou Manor guardsman. Though accurate with guns, Gou the First didn't particularly value me. He preferred sword and spear skills."

"However good swords and spears are—can they stop your gunshot?" Li Yunxing knew nothing of his internal turmoil—he assumed Yang Zeng simply felt under-appreciated.

"Only with the masters' guns could I never have dreamed that firearms could shoot so far, so accurately, so fast." Yang Zeng grew excited discussing the weapons. "The foreign guns were good—but compared to these, far inferior."

"Oh? Tell me what's different."

"There are many advantages. The two best points, in my view, are these: First, the percussion caps. Just place and fire. No priming powder—it's safe and convenient. Second, the pre-measured paper cartridges. Easy to use, and the quantity is always accurate. Before, I poured powder from a bag, which was mostly guesswork. Sometimes too much, sometimes too little. Not like these paper cartridges, where the amount is always just right."

Li Yunxing thought: *This man is remarkable.* Ordinary soldiers mechanically followed instructions. He had genuine thoughts—a rare talent.

"Ten-for-ten at one hundred meters. What about two hundred meters? Want to try?"

"Chief's orders—I'll obey!" The formal words, combined with his chest-out attention stance, looked slightly incongruous.

Li Yunxing specially issued a "J+" marked precision Minié rifle. The two-hundred-meter target was a 1.5-meter diameter circle. Yang Zeng focused, breathed—and hit ten-for-ten again.

Incredible. Li Yunxing was astonished. Minié rifles, though rifled, couldn't match the accuracy of breech-loading metal-cartridge rifles. Given Yang Zeng's matchlock experience and only one month's training, hitting at this level indicated exceptional talent.

The target moved to three hundred meters. Yang Zeng missed four. At four hundred meters—he still hit four. A remarkable score. Several Military Committee veterans applauded. Even with a Type-56 SKS, this would be respectable.

"Excellent. You'll be a sniper." Li Yunxing was delighted his unit had produced such talent.

"Thank you, Chief, for the promotion!" Yang Zeng didn't know what "sniper" meant—but he intuited that it benefited him.

He and several other excellent shooters were selected together and trained as sharpshooters. Wei Aiwen decided to form a skirmisher platoon outside the infantry companies to provide long-range precision support.
