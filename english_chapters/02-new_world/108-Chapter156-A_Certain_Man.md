# Chapter 156: A Certain Man

It was late at night. Under the glow of a lamp, Ma Qianzhu was drafting a document:

**Planning Committee 1628 Document No. 31: Regarding Military Formation Requirements, Ordnance Production, and Material Allocation.**

**Classification: Confidential**

**I. Order the Ordnance Department to immediately estimate material and manpower requirements for the following projects:**

1.  Begin training 500 New Army soldiers within one week, including 30 transmigrators. Immediately assemble existing Minié rifle components into finished weapons—estimated first batch is 350 rifles. Additionally, the Ordnance Department is to provide: 5 × 6-pounder smoothbore cannons, 4 × 12-pounder howitzers.
2.  During training: each cannon will fire 2 rounds daily; each rifle will fire 10 rounds daily. Estimate ammunition consumption and produce a 6-month supply of training ammunition.
3.  After 6 months, expand to 1,000 troops with training intensity unchanged. Full rifle and cannon equipment with ammunition must be ready. Active inventory target: 1,000 rifles, 100 cannons (including naval ships and land/sea fortress guns), plus a 100% reserve stock in warehouses. Personnel must be arranged for weapon repair.
4.  Estimated single-battle consumption: 60 rounds per cannon, 50 rounds per rifle. Beyond training needs, a minimum of two battles' worth of ammunition must be stockpiled in the production plan.
5.  Requirement: 1,000 uniform sets (including underwear) and equipment. Fabric and leather will be drawn from the stockpile. Transmigrators with pattern-making or clothing production experience are needed. Batch processing can be assigned to the Commune garment factory.
6.  Estimate combat ration requirements for 1,000 New Army soldiers.

**II. Establish Military-Political Cadre School**

1.  Divide into Classes A and B. Class A: local adults with an educational foundation. Class B: youth class. Personnel to be drawn from quarantine-cleared youth and children. Meals to be at the transmigrator level. Logistics Department to specify additional grain, meat, and salt requirements.
2.  Construction Department to consider a school site and estimate project materials and labor.

**III. Chemistry Department Progress**

1.  Chemistry Department to report completion schedules for three major plants: the coal tar factory, the 800-ton synthetic ammonia plant, and the salt electrolysis plant.
2.  If factory methods are unavailable, what substitute processes can be used to manufacture acids and bases? List required materials, equipment, and energy.
3.  Report on which explosives and pyrotechnics can be scaled up. Priority: black powder, nitrocellulose, mercury fulminate, and nitroglycerin.

**IV. Trade**

1.  Focus on glassware. The Industrial Committee should establish a Light Industry Department for this. First batch products: glass mirrors and wine bottles (for the Guangzhou order).
2.  Guangzhou has purchased resale tobacco. We can manufacture cigarettes. The Industrial Department must quickly develop cigarette paper.
3.  The Guangzhou Forward Station has repeatedly reported insufficient transportation—purchased materials are piling up. The original plan was to buy two or three ships locally with hired crews. However, authorities have recently begun sealing ocean vessels in preparation for naval warfare, and all shipyards have stopped building. Request the Executive Committee to urgently acquire one or two ships.

...

Ma Qianzhu wrote until deep into the night. The myriad threads of every department ultimately converged at the Planning Committee for coordination. As operations expanded, ideas and plans multiplied—the streamlined institutions they had originally set up clearly needed adjustment.

He pondered the situation. First, the Intelligence and Security departments needed integration. The current Intelligence Department mostly searched archives—there was insufficient real-world collection. The Long Range Reconnaissance Team, limited by conditions, had only extended its reconnaissance to neighboring counties. The situation in the prefectural capital remained unclear. The Recon Team resembled a resource survey team more than a military unit, often mixed with various specialists, which limited their capability. Military-political intelligence was severely under-collected. The General Staff establishing a Military Intelligence Department was a good start. In the future, they would need to separate the Recon Teams from the Survey Teams. As Guangzhou opened up, a Leizhou intelligence-commerce system would need to be established, followed by penetration into Qiongzhou Prefecture city. As for the other counties, Ma Qianzhu considered them irrelevant. Once conflict with the Ming erupted, they could just seize them directly—no pre-infiltration needed.

He brewed some tea—captured from the Gou Manor. Lingao produced no tea, and in a timespace without soda, the demand for tea had increased greatly. Actually, making soda wasn't difficult. Ma Qianzhu's childhood had been spent in a large state-enterprise residential compound—those enterprises managed everything from birth to death, except for the grave. Even soda was self-made. The young Ma Qianzhu had worshipped that magical machine. Growing up, his research revealed it had minimal technical content.

"I can even make cola," he murmured, remembering the coca trees at Nanhai Farm. Cola was just caramel, coca extract, and soda mixed together.

"Cola? You didn't bet on that?" A man's voice came from the doorway.

"With the painful lessons we've had, who dares bet on cola? Sit—tea?" Ma Qianzhu rose to pour water. A thermos in the office was a privilege of the cadre. This aluminum thermos was roughly Ma Qianzhu's age—the words "*Fengcheng* Brand" were still visible in red paint.

The visitor was somewhere between his early and late thirties. Brood and heavyset, his movements seemed sluggish but were actually quite agile. He had a completely unremarkable face—the kind of person you'd never remember meeting once.

"A rare visitor. Haven't seen you since D-Day."

"You're on the Executive Committee," the visitor said impassively. "Why would I visit frequently? I must avoid suspicion."

"Cut it out—honestly: what's your angle with this avoidance?"

"I hear you're preparing for war against Zhu Cailao?" The man changed the topic.

"Not war—preparation. We must guard against attacks. Our operations have expanded; we can't do without a military."

"Zhu Cailao is merely a setting sun, a declining power. The transmigrator group's greatest threats," the man said, "are two-fold. First: the Ming dynasty. It's already past *lidong*, and the autumn taxes have been collected. Putting aside the Guangdong Ming forces—the Tianqi-era provincial treasury is depleted. But the Qiongzhou garrison has territorial responsibility—they will likely attacking once. Second: Zheng Zhilong. He's now been pacified and given the rank of *youji*. He's preparing to eliminate his former comrades and monopolize the southeastern sea trade."

"Your meaning?"

"Zhu Cailao is a potential ally."

"Ally with pirates?"

"Correct." The man spoke leisurely. "The transmigrator group's maritime strength is weak. Your fishing boats—however formidable—number only four. Without local maritime allies, you'll soon face a choice: pay protection money obediently, or fight all the maritime powers at once. You've wanted contact with Liu Xiang, but actually, Zhu Cailao's forces aren't bad. He's weaker than Liu Xiang, and Zheng Zhilong wants to destroy him. He's besieged on all sides—cooperation will be easier. By the way, historically he'll be knocked out by Zheng Zhilong at Min'an next August."

"The Executive Committee considered this. But we destroyed his fence and seized over 100,000 *liang* of goods—cooperation seems difficult."

The man smiled confidently. "Given Zhu Cailao's current situation, he can't demand much. You have rare goods to offer. Give him exclusive distribution rights, and he'll agree."

Ma Qianzhu pondered. He had considered this proposal but felt uncertain. Rob someone's money, kill their people, and then suddenly ally with them? Would Zhu Cailao really be so agreeable?

"However disagreeable he might find it—urgent problems take priority."

"Fine, I'll try. Failed negotiations cost nothing."

"Over Poland, even Stalin and Hitler could shake hands." The man slowly stood up and walked out.

"You really won't serve on the Executive Committee?" Ma Qianzhu felt regretful. "The Intelligence Department desperately needs personnel."

"It's not time yet." The man gazed at Lingao's night sky as he left.

Ma Qianzhu had nothing more to do that night. The next day, he convened the Executive Committee and presented the idea. Opinions varied. Most didn't oppose peace talks with Zhu Cailao—after all, combat meant risking lives. Rather, they doubted the feasibility, fearing excessive concessions would harm the transmigrator group's prestige and interests. After repeated discussion, they decided to attempt it. Regardless of the outcome of the peace talks, the military buildup would continue. "Speak softly and carry a big stick."

Ma Qianzhu had Dugu Qiuhun bring the captured pirate leader, who was currently undergoing "labor reform" by building roads at the East Gate Market. Shortly, Dugu returned with two prisoners. They were terrified upon seeing the short-hair leaders, thinking their execution was imminent. Ma Qianzhu hastily reassured them.

One leader's alias was "Black Face Dragon" Shi Fourteen—a ship captain-level boss. After capture, he had been cooperative, confessing everything he knew. Ma Qianzhu knew from the interrogation records that this man kept faith with his comrades and had some reputation among the pirates.

Ma Qianzhu spoke: "We are overseas descendants of the Great Song, returning to the Ming dynasty. We are resting here at Lingao, living peacefully with your group. Yet you attacked our people and killed our men—what is your justification?"

Shi Fourteen heard that Ma Qianzhu's words did not carry a threat of death and was secretly pleased. He hastened to say: "A misunderstanding! We had business relations with the Gou family. Recently, a trusted man of the Gou family came weeping—he claimed his master was murdered without reason by you people, accusing you of murder and robbery. Hearing this injustice, I rashly took initiative—it was unrelated to our Great Boss. Now it is clear that scoundrel was spreading rumors. When I return, I'll slice him to pieces to vent my fury."

This "weeping Gou family trusted man" story was naturally fabricated, but Black Face Dragon just wanted to deflect blame by agreeing with Ma Qianzhu.

Ma Qianzhu heard "murder and robbery" and secretly laughed: *You dare accuse us?* But aloud he said: "So it was a misunderstanding. Let me prepare some modest gifts as an apology, then act as your escort home. Your three ships all sank—perhaps we should buy a small boat to send you back?"

Hearing that he could leave, Shi Fourteen felt relieved—his days in captivity had felt like years. Fu Youdi's torments weren't gentle; they had barely eaten and received countless beatings. He wanted to leave immediately: "Since it's a misunderstanding—and I also wronged your group—let's skip the gifts. I'm healthy; without boats, walking works, fishing boats work. My family has urgent business—I can't delay."

Ma Qianzhu smiled slightly. "Brother, don't rush. We've long heard of Great Boss Zhu's reputation—generous and righteous. We've always wanted to pay our respects. Let me prepare substantial gifts for the Great Boss. Please introduce me—don't refuse. Please wait momentarily, I'll return shortly." He signaled Dugu Qiuhun to watch the man, then went to report to the Executive Committee.

The Executive Committee prepared gifts for Zhu Cailao as a goodwill gesture, seeking maritime trade cooperation. Initially, they prepared plastic flowers and glass crafts. The nearby guard, Hu Hou, advised: "Flashing wealth to bandits invites wolves—it brings endless trouble." Everyone agreed and prepared only common items: two glass mirrors and ten bolts of silk. They also gave Shi Fourteen ten *liang* of silver as consolation.

Ma Qianzhu remembered the potential for glass sales and told the Industrial Department to prepare samples. Zhan Wuya spread his hands helplessly: "My report's been submitted for days, but the furnace still isn't built. Where do I get samples? Just break off a piece from the Holy Ship."

Ma Qianzhu had someone retrieve a large shard from the Holy Ship and gave it to Shi Fourteen: "We manufacture this. Please tell the Great Boss—see if he's interested in distributing for us. Everything is negotiable."

Shi Fourteen only wanted to board a ship and flee quickly, so he agreed repeatedly.
