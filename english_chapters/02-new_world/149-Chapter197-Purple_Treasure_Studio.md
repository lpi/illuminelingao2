# Chapter 197: Purple Treasure Studio

Though times were hard, the powerful Fujian-Guangdong sea warlord Zheng Zhilong had accepted imperial amnesty, and though pirates still operated outside the Pearl River estuary, Guangzhou's situation had eased considerably. At year's end, the great southeastern metropolis was bustling again.

Guangdong had always been warm in climate. Though China was gripped by the Little Ice Age and even Leizhou had once seen snow, cold wasn't the norm here south of the Five Ridges. After cold snaps passed, the earth quickly warmed again. The land already showed early spring blossoms. From high officials' mansions down to comfortable households, this year's New Year was still joyfully celebrated. Starting from New Year's Eve, firecrackers sounded continuously citywide, becoming even more frequent at fifth watch on the first.

Yet last year's consecutive Fujian famines had considerably affected Guangdong too. Refugees from afar and local starving folk gathered on wastelands near temples operating soup kitchens. Daily, hungry beggars streamed through streets with unending cries. Fortunately, the mild weather meant no frozen corpses. But warm weather and concentrated destitute populations bred various epidemics. Daily, *baojia* officials carried bodies to the cremation grounds outside the city. But this wasn't unique to this year. Everyone was accustomed to it. It didn't interfere with the city's prosperity, and certainly didn't diminish the New Year's joys of officials, gentry, and the wealthy.

After New Year came the annual Lantern Festival. From Chengxuan Street to Great South Gate—about three or four *li* long—several streets along the route became lantern markets. Traditionally, the lantern market ran from the 14th through the 16th of the first month—daytime for trading, nighttime for lantern viewing. The lantern market gathered merchants from everywhere, seizing the opportunity to hawk every kind of goods. Day and night, the constant stream of people shouting and calling was like a boiling pot. Nearby streets and alleys grew lively too. At night, every shop front displayed colorful lanterns of every style—beaded, ink-splattered silk, five-color gauze, bright horn, paper, wheat-straw, and even grass. There were even extremely rare Western glass lanterns and Australian soft-film lanterns—the latter had only appeared on the market the previous year. Slightly translucent material, soft texture, brilliantly colorful—these had become the new darlings of local officials and wealthy merchants.

Especially precious lanterns hung on multi-story pavilions lining the streets for distant admiration. These pavilions faced north and south, vermilion doors and embroidered windows, painted beams and carved rafters. Pavilions with curtains usually held the wives and concubines of local high officials and gentry. Each pavilion's nightly rent was dozens of taels.

Colored lanterns burned all night for all-night viewing alongside fireworks. Fireworks were endlessly varied and awe-inspiring. Various ensembles and acrobatic acts performed through the night. Dragon dances and lion dances ran from evening to dawn. All night, men and women crowded together in mountain-like seas of people.

The 14th day of the first month was the Lantern Festival's second climactic day. That morning, a distinguished-looking man approaching old age—with sparse, free-flowing beard, wearing a half-worn round-collared silk robe and scholar's cap, brow slightly furrowed with melancholy—rode a donkey from the west city to the east, entering Huifu Street. He dismounted before Purple Treasure Studio, paid the carrier's fee, and slowly walked inside.

This merchant-looking middle-aged man was named Shen Fan. He'd become an apprentice in Guangzhou's famous jewelry trade at age twelve. After twenty-some years of diligent service, he'd risen to chief manager. Working a lifetime in this trade, he'd just retired last year to buy some farmland in the countryside—at over fifty, time to enjoy family life. But fate was cruel. His only beloved grandson contracted an unknown illness. Spending his entire savings on famous doctors yielded only the verdict: "Malaria has entered the bones. No cure."

For Old Manager Shen, this was a thunderbolt from clear skies. He'd struggled with descendants—his only son had already died. This grandson was all his hope. Now on death's doorstep. He felt utterly hopeless.

Yet somehow, news of his grandson's illness reached Manager Sun Kecheng. Manager Sun knew the jewelry trade well through escort business connections. Through his introduction, a young man named Guo Yi appeared, claiming he could save the beloved grandson. The condition: serve as chief manager at Purple Treasure Studio, which they were planning to establish. For someone with Shen Fan's reputation, switching employers violated trade taboos. But he'd already retired with no obligations to his former employer. Coming out of retirement to work elsewhere would at most draw behind-the-back gossip from colleagues. This young man, though strangely attired, had a distinguished bearing and proper manners—clearly no petty criminal. Though puzzled, he immediately agreed. Compared to his grandson's life, what was his reputation worth? So, with a dead-horse-as-live-horse attitude, he let Guo Yi treat the grandson. And indeed a miracle occurred. After several days of swallowing mysterious white pills with water per Guo Yi's instructions, the grandson's condition apparently improved. Shocked and delighted, he called for another doctor to examine the grandson. The verdict: no longer critical, just needs rest. Per agreement, once the Lantern Festival ended, Shen Fan would formally join Purple Treasure Studio.

But this Purple Treasure Studio was strange. Old Manager Shen had heard from colleagues that this shop had been open less than a month, seemingly doing only mansion-level business. The premises were strictly guarded; nobody knew the inner workings. Some colleagues warned him this shop's owner had deep connections with the Gao family—might not be legitimate, possibly backing some sea bandit.

This made Old Manager Shen uneasy. But reflecting that Sun Kecheng was known as steady and reliable, he wouldn't randomly introduce a questionable employer. He decided to visit Qiwei Escort Bureau first—also to probe his new employer's background.

Sun Kecheng concealed nothing, explaining Guo Yi's origins frankly: Australian maritime merchants with rare goods, seeking development and profit in Ming China. As for what goods—Shen Fan didn't need to ask. The various Australian curiosities sold through Gao family shops probably came from this Guo Yi. This was unexpected. He'd assumed some wealthy provincial outsider wanted to profit in Guangzhou's rich territory. Turned out they really had excellent merchandise. Manager Shen knew the so-called Australian goods were not only exquisitely crafted but nearly impossible for outsiders to imitate—his former employer had once invited him to study various Australian curiosities on the market. The trade's master craftsmen all said they could roughly imitate appearance and structure, but certain materials remained unknown.

Originally ambivalent about managing Purple Treasure Studio, upon learning they were the source of Australian goods, Shen Fan's curiosity—cultivated through a lifetime handling rare treasures—was piqued. The manager position was settled. These past days, he'd been visiting colleagues and customers, establishing Purple Treasure Studio's business relationships.

Two young shop assistants at the door saw the manager arrive, quickly dropped their brooms, and came to greet and assist him.

"Is the owner in?"

"In the back accounts room, talking with Manager Sun from Qiwei." One young assistant replied respectfully. This was Gao Di, the Gao family's household servant. Quite clever. Shen Fan knew Gao Di's whole family served in the household. Though just a shop assistant, Guo Yi privately relied on him heavily. Communications with Qiwei Escort Bureau all went through him.

Actually, Gao Di was more than merely relied upon. Shen Fan couldn't imagine that this still-childish youngster was now one of Guo Yi's main informants.

During Wen Desi's absence, besides practicing martial arts at the escort bureau and routinely collecting commodity prices, Gao Di had continuously gathered information on the Gao family through childhood playmates from his days at Gao mansion. He was shrewd, knowing Wen Manager and the Gao family were cooperating on the surface but watching each other warily. Later when Xiao Manager came, he reviewed Gao Di's collected materials. This Xiao Manager smiled without comment but gave him silver—making him happy for days. Not for the silver, but because his work was recognized.

After Xiao Manager left came Guo Manager—Gao Qing and Gao Xian were puzzled by the Australian merchants' frequent personnel changes and somewhat uncomfortable. But Gao Di somewhat understood. Wen Manager—these Australians weren't one or two people but a group. Wen Manager and Xiao Manager were just leaders among them. His family weren't anyone's servants but Australian agents.

For this reason, he'd become even more proactive lately. Under Guo Yi's instructions, besides learning shop work as an assistant, he continued intelligence activities daily. He'd developed three or four subordinates from childhood playmates. Each received 200 wen monthly from him—drawn from the one-tael monthly activity fund Wen Desi had previously allocated. Guo Yi believed an intelligence chief should not only gather intelligence but also have good management skills, including personnel and financial management. So he didn't give Gao Di more funds.

Evidence showed the just-fifteen-year-old Gao Di had considerable talent for certain things. Now not only were Gao family movements clear to Guo Yi, but street talk throughout Haofan Street and Guangzhou city reached him promptly.

Guo Yi's next goal was establishing a preliminary intelligence and trade network throughout Guangdong province, currently relying on Qiwei Escort Bureau. Under his planning and financial support, Manager Sun had expanded Qiwei's branch offices, establishing various properties along major land and water routes and commercial hubs provincewide—buying estates, opening inns, cart services. Sun Kecheng was both pleased and worried. Pleased because rural devastation meant disciples, relatives, and fellow villagers who couldn't survive came to him for help. Guo Manager's expanded branches conveniently solved their employment. Worried because he'd never seen business done this way. Before knowing if the first shop would profit, the second and third were already opening. At this rate, branches would cover all Guangdong. The money spent made his heart race—just the Leizhou deployment alone had cost a thousand taels. Yet Guo Manager repeatedly emphasized: buy land estates and workshops, as much as possible—at this rate, even mountains of gold and silver wouldn't suffice.

He'd been troubled for days. Just after New Year, he rushed to consult Guo Yi about perhaps slowing expansion.

Shen Fan crossed the front courtyard and main hall, passed through an escort-guarded moon gate. Inside was an elegantly clean small courtyard with three main rooms—Purple Treasure Studio's accounts office. Long windows stood open. He could see Guo Manager and Sun Manager talking. Sun Kecheng looked worried yet kept nodding. Shen Fan was a veteran who'd risen through twenty years as a shop assistant. He slowed his steps and gave a light cough.

Guo Manager saw him arrive and quickly rose to greet him. Manager Sun stood to leave.

Shen Fan reported his customer and colleague visits in detail. Normally such business matters needn't reach the owner, but Purple Treasure Studio was different. Shen Fan still didn't know what products the shop would actually sell. All he could do was carry shop cards and books to visit major city households.

"Owner, here's the roster of my visits." Shen Fan took a book from his sleeve and handed it to Guo Yi. Guo Yi was now fully dressed as a Ming person, even with growing topknot.

Opening the book: plum-red paper, rows of neat small calligraphy with side annotations—the Baixian Restaurant owner, the Governor-General's secretary, the Chen Grain Store manager, the Gongxing Pawnshop proprietor, *Jinshi* Zhao of Panyu, Gentry Ma of Nanhai... The non-rich were noble, or else some great mansion's chief steward, some official's concubine. A quick scan showed eighty or ninety households.

"This many?" Guo Yi was surprised. Shen Fan had told him his planned visits were mostly the city's top-tier households, spending tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands annually on jewelry and curiosities.

"Yes, owner. These are still only the biggest. Haven't visited some smaller ones yet." Gao Lujie brought tea and towels. Shen Fan removed his cap, wiped the light sweat from his forehead. "Just the last few days' work. But there's one thing requiring owner's instructions."

"Say it."

"Owner sells priceless treasures and curiosities. Handling so many major customers simultaneously—can your capital turnover manage?"

Purple Treasure Studio doing mansion business meant doing things the mansion way. By convention, such great households didn't pay cash for jewelry purchases—they just opened an account at the jewelry shop. Whatever caught their eye, they registered and stamped in the book and took the goods. Settlement came at three annual festivals: Dragon Boat, Mid-Autumn, and New Year.

This meant huge capital requirements for shops. Jewelry and curiosities often cost thousands to tens of thousands of taels. Even with large capital, handling so many customers simultaneously was nearly impossible. Shen Fan feared this foreigner didn't understand these nuances and would overreach, ultimately crashing.
