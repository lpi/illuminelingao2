# Chapter 143: Steelmaking

Though the transmigrators' modern fishing boats had absolute advantages in reconnaissance, protection, speed, and mobility, their firepower was pathetically weak. If instead of three pirate ships, thirty had come, lone *Fishing-1* probably wouldn't have fared well. Fujian and Guangdong's major pirate lords each commanded at least three hundred to four hundred ships. And for the entirety of Bopu Harbor, the transmigrators' activity range and facilities had far exceeded the Bopu camp boundaries. Over two hundred transmigrators and commune members were scattered across vast spaces—almost completely undefended.

The conclusion was clear: besides naval equipment upgrades, Bopu Harbor fortification also needed attention. Staff recommendations included building gun emplacements, batch-producing at least 1800-level cannons, producing and stockpiling ammunition, and establishing a coastal patrol fleet. This fleet would mainly comprise steam-sail ships—conserving the fishing boats' major overhaul lifespan. The transmigrators couldn't perform such overhauls for five to ten years. Even simple hull painting was impossible—not for lack of materials, but because they couldn't achieve modern anti-rust and toxic hull paint effectiveness.

Cannon production was assigned to the Industrial Department's Mechanical Group. For weapon enthusiasts, this was pure adrenaline. After frustrating days making trivial hardware—even the mechanical crossbows were all-wood—finally they could make real cannons! Everyone was energized. The Mechanical plant's sheds saw endless streams of artillery enthusiasts—proposals varied wildly. Designs mainly concentrated on three types: a twelve-pounder mountain howitzer, the nimble multi-purpose Type-92 infantry gun, and the all-rounder mortars. Various personal favorites added different functions and improvements.

Cannon making required massive quantities of steel. The *Deng Yingzhou* had already shipped two batches of pig iron ingots and small quantities of wrought iron from Guangzhou—totaling fifty tons. Also twenty tons of urgently needed coal. This was roughly sufficient for initial-scale steelmaking.

The transmigrators used converter steelmaking. In twenty-first century timespace, small converters were nationally mandated obsolete industries. Here, they were genuinely advanced. This industry was headquartered at Bopu Harbor District.

Bopu was chosen because Lingao's steel combine was entirely import-dependent—ships bringing bulk coal and iron ore could be used immediately nearby. The current steelmaking workshop was just a large brick-pillar shed. A hardened ground floor held four small converters and one cupola furnace in a row.

Metallurgy head Ji Wusheng had been a steelworker. Though he'd never personally done small-converter steelmaking, he understood the principles. Since D-Day, he'd produced several steel heats—proving that wood charcoal and local pig iron products could make steel. The downside: difficulty controlling material ratios meant random steel grades per heat. Also, metallurgy's energy consumption was enormous—just the two blast fans during steelmaking shut down all neighboring power users.

Based on analyzed pig iron composition, the Metallurgy Group used converter side-blowing, adding wrought iron proportionally. The ratio was approximately seventy-six percent pig iron, twenty-four percent wrought iron, plus minimal sand. The sand created acidic slag, absorbing phosphorus from the pig iron.

After discovering local refractory materials, the Metallurgy Group built a cupola furnace. This round smelting furnace wasn't large—but it was far more complex than the converters. Converters required 1,380°C iron liquid from cupolas. This temperature was unreachable by ordinary fuels—before regenerators, the maximum humans could achieve was 1,250°C.

Reaching this temperature required replacing cold blast with hot blast—the "regenerator." Hot blast was invented by Englishman Neilson and first applied at Glasgow ironworks in 1829.

The Metallurgy Group's regenerator was roughly at an 1850-British level, using cast-iron-pipe hot blast stoves. Cold blast from the blower main was branched to each heating furnace, passing through arched cast iron pipes over fires to heat-exchanger opposite-side pipes, then into the cupola tuyeres. The entire apparatus was sealed in thick brick and refractory arched heating furnace—preserving and reflecting maximum heat. Direct-heated blast reached 300°C—sufficient to melt lead. But this temperature still dissatisfied the Metallurgy Group. An additional measure was added: waste gas heating. Ceramic pipes drew cupola exhaust from the top, entering the regenerator from above and exiting through the bottom waste outlet.

Coal and coke cupolas produced substantial gas. For centuries, this gas was simply vented from furnace tops. Nighttime burning flames were spectacular—but severely wasteful and polluting. In 1832, a Baden German ironworks first piped gas to regenerators for heating. Multiple techniques ultimately raised hot blast above 500°C.

Without regenerators, iron and steel smelting was still possible—but production efficiency was incomparable. Per British calculations, early regenerators raising blast to 300+°C tripled iron output per fuel unit versus cold blast.

High-temperature hot blast damaged cupola tuyeres—protection was required. The transmigrators' technical level could overcome this. They easily copied the Scottish tuyere invented by Condie at Scottish ironworks: a wrought-iron coiled tube fitted into a cast-iron conical tube, with ends extending beyond the cone base. Water entered from one extending pipe end, circled to the tuyere's narrow end. Water circulated through the coil, exiting through the opposite extending pipe.

With this cupola, the Metallurgy Group successfully produced steel in several small-scale heats. The next step was coking.

The transmigrators had initially used charcoal—but coke remained the ideal fuel. Coal coking's significance wasn't just high-quality fuel for iron and steel—coking by-products were crucial chemical industry feedstocks. So they'd brought complete coal coking equipment. Besides coking, by-products could produce over twenty important chemicals: gasoline, diesel, asphalt, phenol, toluene, crude benzene, sulfuric acid, various solvent oils, lubricants, and paraffin. Once the coal coking enterprise went operational, the transmigrators' chemical capabilities would leap qualitatively.

However, like all complete systems, installation was extremely difficult. Despite manufacturer training, abundant drawings, manuals, and specialized equipment, in amateur installers' hands, progress was slow. This system was continuous operation—it couldn't stop and start. A single batch required over one hundred tons of coal. The transmigrators' total coal reserves were just twenty tons. So the Metallurgy Group could only use simple indigenous coking.

Indigenous coking had many methods. The simplest was the open-pile method—two to four tons of coal piled semi-circular on ground, three to four meters base diameter, straw-covered for ignition, four to five days to coke. Yield was only fifty percent. This method was used during the Great Leap era—causing severe waste and pollution. The transmigrators could ignore environmental issues, but coal tar was important chemical feedstock; it couldn't be wasted.

Luo Duo again found an improved method in the computer resources: Kailuan-style round-furnace coking. Kailuan furnaces came in three sizes—batch loading from fifty-five to two hundred sixty tons. The fifty-five-ton furnace had the best cost efficiency, suiting the transmigrators' limited coal in the early stage.

Construction materials were simple: besides some sheet-iron components, the basics were brick and fire brick. The entire coking process took approximately twelve days; yield was seventy-five percent. This furnace could utilize coking-generated gas for heating while recovering some coal tar. Water-cooled and recovered tar was collected in clay jars for future chemical feedstock.

Finally, coke and pig iron were ready. Ji Wusheng assembled the steelworkers. These recently converted transmigrators wore asbestos suits and gloves, specialized caps and photochromic goggles. He reminded everyone of the key points: first, wind volume adjustment must be gradual—no sudden changes; second, iron liquid poured into the furnace mustn't exceed the tuyere level—otherwise it would block the tuyeres; finally, iron liquid volume per pour mustn't exceed one-sixth of the converter chamber.

Both blowers started simultaneously—one blowing into the cupola, gradually raising the temperature above 1,300°C. The pig iron ingots completely melted. Ji Wusheng then directed workers to add 0.4% baking soda for desulfurization. Meanwhile, the converter was preheating. Per requirements, the entire converter needed 1,000°C preheating—reducing temperature loss when iron liquid entered.

When the optical pyrometer showed cupola iron liquid reaching 1,380°C, iron was poured into the converter for blowing. Blower pressure was maintained at 0.07–0.12 atmospheres. The iron liquid continuously heated under high-temperature hot blast. Ji Wusheng watched the furnace flames intently. Iron sparks continuously burst; flame color progressed from red-yellow to yellow-white to white to brilliant white. This indicated steadily rising furnace temperature.

Blowing continued for approximately ten minutes. Star-shaped carbon sparks intensified; brilliant white flames lengthened from short. Carbon combustion was peaking.

When Ji Wusheng saw flames shortening and carbon sparks thinning, he knew residual carbon was approaching steel content. He rocked the furnace once or twice with tilting levers—checking for more carbon sparks. Seeing no sudden increase, he ordered wind shutoff.

Subsequently, workers removed furnace lids and blast pipes, began slag skimming and removal, finally pouring. Mold sand was ninety percent yellow sand, five percent clay, five percent white mud. After casting—steel ingots. Whether high, medium, or low carbon, Ji Wusheng couldn't yet control. Each heat required testing to determine the steel type.
