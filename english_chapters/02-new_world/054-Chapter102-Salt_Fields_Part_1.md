# Chapter 102: Salt Fields (Part 1)

The preliminary survey of Nanan *dong* took two days. With *Aoya* Fu accompanying them, the survey team's work proceeded smoothly. Fa Shilu and Cui Yunhong handled the agricultural, forestry, and mineral aspects respectively, while Mu Min investigated local social conditions. Nanan *dong*'s resources were quite rich.

First, there were various timber resources. The mountains held vast forests—though locals' *shanlang* slash-and-burn cultivation had destroyed some, reserves remained substantial. Fa Shilu finally found the forest of perennial woody cotton he'd dreamed of—clearly what locals used for spinning and weaving. The mountains also had many wild bananas, lychees, longan, and jackfruit trees—supplementary food sources for locals. Betel-nut trees were abundant, though useless to transmigrators except as trade goods for resale.

Second, their paddies contained numerous original rice strains—extremely valuable genetic resources for breeders. Given enough strains, continuous cross-breeding could develop new varieties. Just in Nanan Village's nearby paddies, Fa Shilu found seventeen different strains; on hillside *shanlang* plots, five upland-rice varieties—including *indica*, *japonica*, and glutinous types.

Hainan was a major area for Chinese wild-rice distribution, so the advantages of genetic diversity were obvious. Lingao in the 21st century was a major Chinese hybrid-rice seed-production base. Fa Shilu gazed at the collected samples, laughing even in his dreams! China's "Father of Hybrid Rice" might just be himself...

Sweet potatoes weren't yet grown here—the Li didn't even know this new crop existed. But they grew other tubers; most surprisingly, an Araceae species—usually medicinal elsewhere. Fa Shilu wasn't a TCM practitioner, but he knew Araceae taro had mild toxicity—could this really be food? Yet by the planted area, it was clearly a major crop. Another common type was the sweet yam, also called the hairy yam.

For coarse grains, he found millet. Fa Shilu hadn't known Hainan grew millet. The post-Bairren-Rapids tribute had included millet, puzzling the Agriculture Committee. Locals explained it was "duck-foot millet," a common Hainan grain with very short maturation.

Besides grain, he found wild ramie patches. The Li apparently weren't very interested in agriculture—basically adopting a laissez-faire attitude with no field management. Fruit, ramie, and cotton grew wild; they only harvested them, never systematically cultivating.

Pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks free-ranged on the hillsides—with no pens and no feeding—so they didn't look very robust. Surprisingly, cattle numbers were high, for both water buffalo and yellow cattle. But he wasn't a livestock specialist; breed assessment would require experts later.

"What a waste," Fa Shilu sighed. "The agricultural conditions here are excellent, but the level is barely above primitive society."

"Don't sigh." Wen Desi patted his shoulder. "Even those paddies along the Wenlan River—how advanced are they? Far behind farmers back home."

Cui Yunhong's findings were less encouraging. Using maps from the other timespace, he had found important deposits: lignite that was shallowly buried and mineable. Some mineral resources—limestone, perlite—were found in small quantities. But distance and poor roads limited their value. The rarest find was a small tungsten-ore vein—though useless to the transmigrators currently.

The Li people kept a wary distance from these strange Han. They watched them carrying odd equipment, climbing trees one moment, wading paddies the next, then standing aside sketching for half the day... But children had maximum curiosity for novelty—first watching from afar, gradually approaching, and finally handling the transmigrators' equipment—and communication began. Most transmigrators couldn't communicate with children—only rock candy represented friendliness. Wen Desi had ordered this brought before departure. Mu Min had an instinctive fondness for these alternate-timespace compatriots; she also spoke Hainanese. Between language and candy, by day two she'd acquired a following of children.

Seeing these bare-bottomed mud-monkey children running everywhere, Mu Min suddenly conceived an idea—one that eventually became the transmigrators' first school in Li territory.

While the Li Territory Work Team conducted goodwill activities, another transmigrator team led by Wang Luobin advanced toward the nearby Ma'ao Peninsula. Their goal: permanently solve the salt problem.

Salt was both an essential human necessity and a key raw material for modern chemical industries. For the transmigrator regime, they urgently needed a tradeable commodity. In ancient societies with underdeveloped commerce, nothing suited exchange better than salt. This region's salt industry had been developed since antiquity. Lingao faced the Qiongzhou Strait, with numerous ports and inlets, abundant natural salt flats, and seawater with high sodium-chloride concentration—generally 1.5–2 Baumé degrees. During the dry season, high temperatures, strong winds, long sunlight hours, and little rainfall created excellent sea-salt production conditions. Salt production had existed since the Tang Dynasty, originally using boiling. Thanks to favorable natural conditions, from the Yongle era onward, Hainan's salt fields gradually adopted sun-evaporation for large-scale production. At Yantian Village on Xinying Bay in the Yangpu Economic Development Zone's southern part, one of China's earliest solar salt-production sites remained—a well-preserved ancient salt field using primitive sun-evaporation methods, still operational today.

According to transmigrator historical records, the Ming-era Lingao salt field was located on the Ma'ao Peninsula, 25 km north of the county seat, with one Salt Field Superintendent under the Haibei Salt Bureau. Annual production was "1,417 *yin*, 230 *jin*." At 300 *jin* per *yin*, this meant over 200 tons annually—initially sufficient for the transmigrators' production and living needs.

Such abundant resources the transmigrator regime naturally needed to quickly seize. Wang Luobin's mission: on-site investigation of this era's salt-evaporation technology, and considering modern-tech improvements to increase production—for modern chemistry, 200 tons was far too little.

The Salt Affairs Team was better equipped than the Li Territory Team. Since the mission required transporting salt back, the team was fully mechanized—five farm trucks deployed. The trucks bounced along dirt roads for about two hours. Travelers were rare along the way; upon entering the Ma'ao Peninsula, the area was virtually deserted. Only ruins and abandoned fields were visible, as if a great battle had occurred. Only scattered salt along the road confirmed they hadn't taken a wrong turn.

Wang Luobin was puzzled; per his mission intelligence and historical records, this salt field had over a thousand salt workers, plus families—at least five or six thousand people around the field, meaning many salt villages should exist. Yet the road showed only ruins after ruins.

Around noon, they found a half-abandoned flagstone path. Following it, they finally found a village with cooking smoke. Houses here were all volcanic-stone construction, alleys deep, but many houses were tightly shut—some with tall weeds at doors, clearly vacant for years. Collapsed houses dotted the village, grass already growing on them.

Only elderly, children, and women remained in the village—barely clothed, appearing extremely impoverished. They didn't flee from the strange visitors—their expressions were numb, apparently indifferent. Xiong Buyou asked around the village for a long time before finding the village head's home.

The head was surnamed Tan, a hereditary salt worker from a famous Hainan salt-making lineage. Faced with Xiong Buyou's salt-buying request, he had the salt warehouse opened: only 500–600 *jin* inside. Such little salt shocked Wang Luobin. Upon questioning, he learned: in Wanli 45, an earthquake collapsed many salt-field flats—some sank into the sea. Ma'ao Salt Field's production never recovered to original levels. But government-mandated commutation payments hadn't decreased. Many salt workers had fled. Making matters worse, from late Wanli onward, pirates frequently raided the salt field for salt certificates. Salt workers were killed or fled. Now only about 200 workers remained in the village. Ancient salt-evaporation was entirely labor-intensive; fewer workers meant even worse production. Annual commutation was never fully paid; government collection pressure was intense. Able-bodied villagers usually hid. Fortunately, Ma'ao had ample land and river water for irrigation. Salt workers farmed grain on the side, managing to eat. They were just constantly afraid.

This situation was a major blow to Wang Luobin. Clearly the salt field's production was extremely poor. The Committee's original plan to control the field and buy all output needed revision—transmigrators would need not only to control the field but organize production recovery and expansion. Suddenly, Wang Luobin felt like land-reform work-team leaders from childhood movies—everything needed rebuilding.

But organizing production recovery wouldn't be easy. Wang Luobin decided to first inspect the salt field. After giving the numbed Village Head Tan a Mexican silver dollar, the numb-faced, seemingly-uninterested head finally agreed to show him the field.
