# Chapter 168: After-Action Review

Inside the headquarters tent on the village beach, the Baitu expedition's squad-and-above officers, NCOs, and cadets had gathered. Medical team nurses poured tea as pleasantries were exchanged. Everyone was in good spirits: despite some minor embarrassments, the battle had followed textbook procedures perfectly. Casualties: zero.

"We must develop a habit," Xi Yazhou began, "of conducting a post-action review after every operation. Speak freely—no taboos."

The native NCOs naturally remained silent. Their sense of hierarchy was still too strong. Xi Yazhou did not force it: everything takes time.

"Bivouac and sentry arrangements satisfactory?"

"All arranged."

"This was our first large-unit combined operation. There were many problems. When the enemy cannon fired, all platoons wavered. We were lucky their cannon was garbage—otherwise, if they'd actually hit someone, we'd have had a total collapse on our hands."

"There are no veterans among them. They're all newbies."

"We need more adaptation training under fire. Get them accustomed to explosions."

"The key is more combat experience—"

"Combat will come. But in their current state, there's a ninety percent chance they'll break at first contact. Running away is still better than paralysis, just waiting to die! Those 1st Company soldiers burying their faces in the dirt—really embarrassing. Were they playing ostrich?" Xi Yazhou's criticism was brutal.

Wei Aiwen's face reddened. As the 1st Company Commander—and the Demonstration Company with an excellence rate of over sixty percent—the biggest embarrassment that day had been his company.

"On returning, I'll strictly rectify this!" Wei Aiwen's tone was low. "Those showing cowardice will be removed to logistics."

"It's their first time in combat—fear is understandable. If we remove them, how do we replace them? Retrain from scratch?"

"I also think it's unnecessary," Xi Yazhou said. "If a unit is weak, commanders should look for the reasons within themselves, not blame the soldiers."

Wei Aiwen felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles—this was turning into a struggle session. He stood up. "I'll make a deep self-criticism—"

"Forget it, Little Wei, relax." Others pulled him back down.

"Skip the self-criticism. On returning, everyone submit new training plans and methods. Improve quickly. Also, you platoon commanders—don't think your men passed. The lack of embarrassment was luck. It doesn't mean you have strong troops."

Old Tiger You and the others grimaced their assent. Post-battle reviews were never pleasant affairs.

"Also, shooting. In the checkpoint battle, the volleys were very ragged. At two hundred meters, with three platoons firing, there were only a dozen hits? With Minié rifles, this score is unacceptable!"

"The soldiers don't grasp the elevation sights well yet. Many aren't accustomed—"

"On returning, emphasize sight-adjustment shooting. Otherwise, against cavalry, we're dead."

Huang Xiong marveled quietly: these bald people's military style was truly different. Winning battles did not mean rewards and banquets—instead, it meant nitpicking every detail. Could such leadership really inspire men to fight and die?

Huang Xiong could not deny this New Army's many shocks—especially the weapons, which were arguably peerlessly sharp. But the military philosophy and methods seemed childishly naive to him. Probably overseas barbarian thinking differed from Chinese thinking.

"The 12-pounder mountain howitzers exceeded expectations. Drawback: insufficient ammunition. Even for low-intensity combat, it was barely enough. Unit mechanization is low, but the establishment is at a mechanized standard. Besides their weapons and gear, soldiers also have to carry artillery equipment—it's too exhausting. Without the village liaisons acting as porters, many soldiers would have straggled." Ying Yu summarized the artillery situation.

"The mechanization shortage can't be solved quickly," Wen Desi said. "Raising or buying horses won't happen overnight—Hainan isn't horse country."

"I know that. Wu Nanhai can't conjure horses out of thin air," Ying Yu said. "My suggestion: with so few horses, we expand the artillery personnel—"

"Damn—substituting men for beasts?"

"That's the idea."

The transmigrators exchanged uneasy glances. This was the most despised aspect of the old-army system—disliked a hundred times more than the Bannermen system.

"I know it's terrible—but how else do we ensure gun mobility?"

There were no alternatives. Unless they bought horses in an emergency. But at Guangzhou, horse purchasing was difficult—officials investigated closely, and markets had few horses.

"Adding gunners makes sense." Xi Yazhou carefully avoided saying "substituting men for beasts." "Currently, each 12-pounder has six gunners. Increasing that to ten reduces the individual burden. It also adds firepower."

"Best to develop lighter, shorter weapons for the artillery—easier to carry. Maybe carbines."

"But enemies might overrun artillery positions. Having only short weapons would be inappropriate."

"Six gunners use short weapons; add four standard riflemen."

"This proposal works," Ying Yu agreed.

"Also—our ration standards have problems. Theoretically, it's 0.75 kilograms per day—but in practice, many eat 1.5 kilograms. This undermines our logistic standards. It needs revision."

"A fat-and-protein-deficient diet causes this," Dongmen Chuiyu said helplessly. As Agriculture's ration observer, he knew the problem well.

"Any feedback on the Grassland Plan rations?"

Wei Aiwen started to speak, but Xi Yazhou interrupted, calling on the distracted Tian Liang instead.

"Tian Liang—tell us: how's the food been the past two days?"

Tian Liang had not expected to be called on. He reflexively stood and saluted.

"Reporting, Chief!"

"Don't shout. Just tell us."

"Very—good." He swallowed. This was honest: eating full meals of fine grain—what dissatisfaction could he have?

"Sit. Do all the soldiers say the same?" Xi Yazhou surveyed the room.

Everyone nodded. One squad leader smiled embarrassedly and stood:

"Reporting, Chief—the brothers said that if there was meat, it would be even better."

Laughter rippled through the tent. The atmosphere lightened visibly.

"Wanting meat is good. Currently, it's difficult—but when we're richer, brothers will eat meat daily!" Xi Yazhou wrote out a blank check.

"Really? Chief... Xi?" The squad leader was stunned with excitement. Huang Xiong was secretly amused: *Trusting officers' words? Only if the sun rose from the west. Soldiers eating meat daily—where was such good fortune to be found?*

"Of course." Xi Yazhou nodded, seating him. "The soldiers probably have no complaints. What about the officers?"

"No fat!"

"Grassland-1 and -2 are good. Grassland-3 and -4 are bland. Without luncheon meat, you can't eat them."

"Best if we make oil jars like fish sauce. Add some when cooking."

"Too few vegetables. Eating like this, we'll eventually start suffering from 'internal heat'!"

There was much food feedback—but not as intense as expected. This was because they had not yet tried Grassland-5: instant rice cakes. Dongmen Chuiyu had eaten one—the taste was truly horrifying.

After the meeting, the village elders were brought to the headquarters tent. They knelt upon entry, then were helped up by Wen Desi.

The transmigrators needed Baitu's people and property. But forcibly relocating over five hundred people from comfortable homes to a strange place would obviously provoke resistance. After Wen Desi's arrival, the officers agreed: more work on the leadership would be needed to pacify the commoners. They had to avoid violent incidents during transit.

The three entering elders represented the village's major surnames—two were Fujianese. One was surnamed Lin, a carpenter. Another surnamed Lu, a blacksmith. Both had brought their entire clans, and they were the village's dominant power. The last was a Cantonese man surnamed Zhang—a shipwright—who had come only with his wife and children.

The Lin clan built ships, but with mediocre skill, producing only small boats. Shipwright Zhang was the core technician. The best-selling 400-*liao* ships—only Zhang could build them. Knowing his minority and outsider status, Zhang kept his shipbuilding secrets close. He took no apprentices. Crucial work like lofting was done personally. Others just labored; they did not understand the principles.

Besides the Lin and Lu clans, the village residents were mostly landless farmers and craftsmen who had escaped Guangdong and Fujian. Real power rested in the Lin and Lu families' hands. Shipwright Zhang's technical value gave him a voice, but little more. After touring the village and interrogating ordinary villagers, Wen Desi understood that most were being exploited. Workshops, tools, ships—all production facilities belonged to the Lin and Lu families.

Understanding this, Wen Desi planned on dismantling their power structure. Shipwright Zhang was clearly the easiest to peel away.

Wen Desi spoke reassuringly: all property would simply be relocated to Bopu. Private property would be protected. At Bopu, they would continue shipbuilding under transmigrator protection, and all labor would be paid. Housing and grain supply would be arranged.

They obviously did not believe him—but belief was not necessary. Wen Desi just needed to reduce their hostility.
