# Chapter 58: The Unexpected Stowaway

"Building B?" Liu Zheng found this curious. He didn't know what the camp looked like, but surely it wasn't an apartment building with separate blocks?

The entire camp was laid out neatly—tent barracks in a grid pattern. For moisture prevention, the ground had been raised with a layer of sand and soil. The perimeter had been dusted with lime and realgar—to repel snakes and insects.

Following the signage at the intersection, he quickly found his tent location. "Building A" and "Building B" simply meant single-men's area and couples/families area. The two zones were separated by a well-lit road.

"Nice—they really thought this through." Liu Zheng had brought his wife. If he had to live separately from her after a day's labor, that would be unbearably dull. He suddenly frowned. "What's that smell?"

A strange odor permeated the camp—the Health Group's anti-snake-and-insect pesticide mixed with burning mugwort. Even more annoying: the camp walkways already had "NO SMOKING!" signs posted. Right now, all Liu Zheng wanted was to pull out that pack of 555s from his backpack and take a few drags.

His pack held plenty of good stuff—camping gear, military field rations from various countries. Liu Zheng didn't entirely trust the Committee's logistics capabilities. And even with a cafeteria, such public canteens were typically double-failures in efficiency and taste. The first few days would surely mean dry rations. Better to rely on himself.

While logging in the mangroves, he'd already woven several net bags from thin vines. Mangroves were biological paradises—abundant fish, shrimp, and crabs. During breaks, he'd caught about half a kilogram of shrimp and one crab, bound with vines—planning to feast with his wife tonight.

By the roadside tents, small groups of transmigrators were gnawing dry rations with water—apparently the cafeteria was a no-go. Some were already snoring in their tents, too exhausted to care.

Walking along, several Military Group members led by Ran Yao, carrying torches, stopped him. They were escorting someone with a black plastic bag over his head.

"Night check. Show your ID card." Ran Yao's voice reminded Liu Zheng of his Beijing days.

He handed over his ID card; the scanner quickly displayed his ID number on the PDA.

"You're Liu Zheng?"

"Yeah, that's me." Liu Zheng was confused—were they checking residency permits here? Or did the Committee need him for something?

"You brought foreign military field rations?"

"That's right." Liu Zheng thought: *Are they requisitioning? No way.*

"What brands, how many?"

"Can't remember exactly. Let me think—MRE numbers 4, 7, 8..."

"Alright." Ran Yao interrupted him. He exchanged glances with other Military Group members and produced four or five brown plastic pouches from his pack, plus a carton of 555s. Liu Zheng recognized them immediately—his own supplies. That cigarette carton even had the label he'd stuck on the seal.

"My cigarettes!"

"We found these on this guy." Ran Yao gestured. "He was coming out of your tent."

"What?!" Liu Zheng never imagined someone would steal on the first day of crossing. *Human nature—so ugly!*

"We didn't expect it either. Originally thought having Military Group patrol the camp was overkill. Didn't expect to catch someone red-handed on the first day."

"What happens to him?"

"Not our call. The Committee will handle it." Ran Yao smiled. "In the twenty-first century, this amount would just get an education and release—two days' detention at most."

Watching them walk away, Liu Zheng—cigarettes in hand—couldn't help feeling sympathy for the unlucky bastard. Getting a record right after arriving—too miserable. He'd lost interest in even going to the beach for a smoke.

Ran Yao brought the man to the command post, wanting to clarify the situation before reporting to the Committee. Besides the theft, the guy had too many suspicious details.

During arrest, he'd tried to resist. Though quickly subdued, he clearly had combat training. The body search turned up a Type-64 pistol—not some workshop knockoff but genuine with a serial number. Ran Yao knew real Type-64s were rare on the black market. Some transmigrators had connections to obtain firearms, but no one would go after a "small firecracker" 64.

Under the light, Ran Yao removed the hood. The mystery deepened. This man looked young at first glance, ordinary features, but his eyes were sharp and seasoned. Ran Yao recognized that look—this should be a colleague. The few police among the transmigrators he all knew; this one he'd never seen. Combined with the Type-64...

The clothes were the transmigrators' standard tropical training uniform. He wore a basic-labor armband but had no electronic dog tag.

"Name, age, occupation?" Ran Yao asked casually. "Where's your ID card?"

The young man said nothing, head down. Ran Yao hadn't done interrogations, but he'd seen plenty of suspects—all kinds of expressions and mannerisms. Never one like this—extreme confusion.

Finally, he spoke, asking a question in return: "Who are you?"

Ran Yao was momentarily stunned. Since the heroic rescue of Director Wen, very few transmigrators didn't recognize him.

"I'm Ran Yao, Security Group leader."

"Security Group—security group of what place?" Guo Yi looked him up and down. This was the guy who'd led the takedown. The grappling was definitely public-security or armed-police style; the bearing matched too—one of his own. But why was a cop wearing Crossing Company clothes? Why was he on this ship?

Questions piled up—but for Guo Yi, since yesterday, questions had become mountains.

Originally, after Guo Yi and two American agents learned the ship's destination, they'd tracked it to the port. To their disappointment, the cargo was unremarkable—all loaded by the local port company. After studying the cargo manifest, the three couldn't figure out Wen Desi's purpose. But during surveillance, they'd spotted Wen Desi leading people aboard the *Fengcheng*. After discussion, all three decided to go undercover. They'd dressed like the boarding passengers, obtained port authority assistance to sneak aboard, and hidden on the ship. The senior officers knew; Guo Yi had even notified his superiors of his action plan.

Events took unexpected turns. That night, when Xue Ziliang spotted the suspicious sailboat—potential weapons-smuggling vessel—rendezvousing with the *Fengcheng*, he thought his big break had arrived. Excitedly dialing his phone to report, the signal suddenly cut out.

The three spent the following night and day in terror. First, no phones worked—even Xue Ziliang's expensive rented maritime satellite phone had no signal. Then, at dawn, Guo Yi discovered the ship had arrived at a completely unfamiliar, desolate place.

All three concluded they'd reached some remote Vietnamese island—analyzing the ship's speed and surrounding geography made this plausible. But the satellite phone still wouldn't work. Not interference—simply zero signal. Completely inexplicable.

Watching the ship disembark passengers and unload cargo, Guo Yi decided to investigate. He simply mixed into the queuing crowd and, amid the chaos, grabbed a basic-labor armband. No one noticed an extra unassigned person on the beach. Military Group guard lines were set on the outer perimeter—no one imagined stowaways aboard. He'd wandered the camp all day. Only when hunger struck did he think to grab some food to bring back. He hadn't expected to be caught immediately. Though work-related, if colleagues found out, he'd be laughed at forever.

"Executive Committee, Internal Affairs and Civil Affairs Committee Security Group! Any problem?"

Guo Yi raised his head. He didn't understand what Ran Yao meant, but this organization clearly wasn't part of the People's Republic of China. Could it be some criminal organization?

Ran Yao was now basically certain: this man wasn't a transmigrator. Recalling the family sucked in by the wormhole last night—was he the same? But this one had clearly come with purpose, targeting them. Stealing an armband to infiltrate the camp—this was no innocent bystander.

"Alright, I've answered your questions. Who are you, and why did you infiltrate us?"

Guo Yi firmly refused to speak. He increasingly believed these people were extremely dangerous organized criminals. Throughout today, he'd seen many professionals at work, massive equipment and machinery unloaded, well-equipped guards—many of military origin—plus this interrogator who was obviously a colleague...

This criminal syndicate's reach was enormous! Smuggling weapons from America, building a base in Vietnam, hiring veterans and police... Guo Yi shuddered. *Finished.* Falling into their hands, he'd surely be tortured to death. Though Xiao Guo had known from day one that his job might make him a martyr, actual martyrs were few—maybe one or two per several years. And martyrs didn't know beforehand they'd die heroically. That was easier than sitting here waiting to become one.

*Stay resolute.* Years of Party education steeled Xiao Guo. He kept silent. Let them torture him. Now he just hoped those two clueless Americans could escape—some hope of rescue. He just didn't know if they were as capable as in American movies.

Ran Yao could tell the man was frightened—only human. But duty came first, and the man stubbornly refused to talk. This was tricky. Coercion obviously wouldn't work. Even if he'd sneaked aboard with ill intent, in this timespace he could only become a companion. But how to explain? Ran Yao really didn't know how to put it—wouldn't he be thought insane? Xiao Zishan had spent all afternoon explaining the situation to that family, earning nothing but Sichuan profanity without convincing anyone.
