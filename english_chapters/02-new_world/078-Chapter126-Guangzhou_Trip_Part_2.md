# Chapter 126: Guangzhou Trip (Part 2)

Sea trials revealed that under full sail with favorable winds, the ship could achieve roughly twelve knots—the engines contributed little additional speed. Ship handling, however, had improved dramatically, which was welcome news for transmigrators with zero hard-sail experience.

"At the very least, we'll have a major advantage in headwinds," Lin Shenhe summarized.

Beyond propulsion, the ship underwent a series of modifications: radio installation, expanded living quarters, reinforced cargo hold bulkheads, and several hidden compartments. These secret spaces concealed weapons, ammunition, and Lin Shenhe's personal cargo—equipment for any piracy opportunities that might present themselves.

Including the transmigrators, the entire Guangzhou Procurement Delegation numbered twenty-five souls. Against pirate attacks, the ship was well-stocked with weapons and ammunition, along with provisions, fresh water, silver, and various supplies.

On November 1, 1628—the sixth day of the tenth lunar month, Chongzhen Year One—the weather proved fair and sunny. The Third-class Transport Ship *Deng Yingzhou* weighed anchor from Bopu, sailing toward the sun-drenched sea.

This grand-sounding "Third-class Transport Ship *Deng Yingzhou*"—"Ascending Yingzhou"—was purely a fantasy of people afflicted with strong naval romanticism. Why "third-class" rather than second or fourth remained a mystery known only to them.

The *Deng Yingzhou* picked up Liu Gang at Denglong Point in Xuwen. The small salt merchant brought along several bodyguards and assistants. He had originally balked at sailing to Guangzhou, preferring the safer overland routes. But hearing tales of the short-hairs' formidable firearms, he felt somewhat reassured. He harbored only a slight regret: the legendary iron ships were nowhere to be seen.

The journey proceeded smoothly, entirely without incident. Five days later, they arrived at Guangzhou's South City dock.

The 1628 Pearl River estuary was not nearly as busy as it would become in later eras. With pirates rampant—and rumors circulating that Admiral Yu was planning to blockade ships in preparation for an assault on Liu Laoxiang—foreign vessels had scattered. Few ships plied the Pearl River.

Lin Chuanqing hadn't slept well in days. This Guangzhou trip carried real risk. During his years as a smuggling guide on the South China Sea, he had witnessed all manner of storms. But he had retired long ago. Though the North American faction constantly watched for piracy opportunities at sea, what he most feared was encountering pirate ships. Liu Laoxiang and his pirate fleet were not to be trifled with. In his smuggling days, he had learned that encountering any country's patrol boats was manageable—at worst, the deal fell through. Encountering pirates meant total loss.

If they met Liu Xiang's pirates, the lives aboard this ship would depend entirely on a dozen-odd rifles and two diesel engines. No one possessed naval combat experience. One or two pirate ships might be manageable, but if seventeen or eighteen came swarming...

Fortunately, Liu Gang had brought a helmsman familiar with coastal routes. Under his guidance, they had nervously hugged the coastline, fleeing into harbors at the first sign of any suspicious vessel. This stop-and-go sailing had been nerve-wracking. Now, reaching the Pearl River estuary, Lin Chuanqing could finally sleep soundly. Lost in reflection, he glanced back at Guo Yi standing by the other railing and couldn't suppress a rueful smile.

For Guo Yi, these five days at sea had been pure torment. Since being transferred to the Security Group for interrogation work, his life had regained new purpose. Now entrusted as the Guangzhou Underground Forward Station Chief—a qualitative leap for him personally—he had been recognized at last. Though this mission carried risk, high risk meant high reward. He would deploy his professional expertise to rapidly elevate his standing, eventually ascending into the group's upper echelons. Excited by these prospects, Guo Yi had prepared complete plans and schemes, rushing hopefully toward this idealized new frontier.

Though he had prepared for seasickness, the originally planned voyage of one or two days had stretched into five days of evasive sailing—and still they hadn't reached land. Guo Yi's complexion had shifted from red to white, then to green, and finally to an alarming black. He had never known he was prone to seasickness—apparently, a seventy-eight-ton wooden boat differed significantly from thousand-ton steel vessels. Everything worth vomiting had been expelled during the first three days' heavy swells. For the first time since his involuntary crossing, thoughts of death had flickered through his mind...

Fortunately, the worst had passed. On calm sailing like this, he could occasionally venture out to breathe the sea air while affecting composure. But the post-landing challenges would far exceed mere seasickness. This had been merely a small prelude.

"Dock! Dock!" Qian Shuixie's shouts from the crow's nest roused everyone, and crowds pressed to both railings for a look. From the ship, a winding green ribbon stretched toward the horizon—the Pearl River. In the distance, Guangzhou's imposing city walls stood visible. Surrounding residences and fortifications could be made out with the naked eye. Several small sailboats lay anchored at the dockside. Barriers surrounded the dock to prevent pirate raids.

Stimulated by hopes of landing, everyone strained to bring the ship to berth. The dock workers—mostly dark-skinned and thin—gathered curiously to investigate upon seeing these newcomers, who appeared tall and robust from future nutritional abundance. Meng De was first to leap ashore, followed by Qian Shuixie, Zhou Weisen, and others. Though everyone had dressed as Ming people with fake hair buns to avoid easy exposure, ingrained military habits still made them quickly assume alert stances. Both sides thus faced off in this strange atmosphere...

"Why aren't you coming ashore? What's the delay?" A coquettish voice drifted from the cabin's rear.

Everyone turned. A stunningly beautiful woman parted the curtain to peer out. Her high cloud-like coiffure appeared casually pinned yet draped perfectly, with several artful strands falling across her gently heaving bosom. She possessed an indescribable languid elegance. A dazzling melon-seed face and gauze-veiled crystalline skin rivaling frost and snow surpassed even a lotus in splendor. A pair of limpid autumn eyes shimmered clear yet misty. Beneath her small pert nose rested tender lips like rose petals—plump and dewy. Every glance and smile carried myriad charms. She was truly heart-stopping.

Meng De's group stood instantly stupefied. The dock workers lost their souls—eyes wide, mouths agape, drool flowing unconsciously. Even if struck dead at that moment, they likely would have shown no reaction.

A cough came from within the cabin, and Guo Yi emerged, affecting worldly experience. He cupped his hands. "My family's womenfolk. Our apologies for the disruption. Please forgive us." He quickly ushered the beauty back inside, preventing further chaos.

This beauty was the transmigrators' famed Intelligence Group's ultimate secret weapon—codenamed "Miss P," or Peipei. True gender: classified at the highest level. Peipei's disguise skills were first-rate even by modern standards. During the voyage, everyone had been dazzled by continuous transformations: lolita to young boy to mature beauty. This latest reappearance—even Meng De's group, supposedly immune by now—still couldn't resist. Profound mastery indeed.

Inside the cabin, Guo Yi offered a mild reproach. "Miss P, please understand: though you're directly commissioned by the Committee's Intelligence Information Group, I'm the Guangdong Forward Station Chief—authorized to coordinate overall operations. Please don't create difficulties for our collective mission." Guo Yi understood that Peipei was this Guangzhou mission's most important secret weapon. But nothing could jeopardize the broader plans—hence this reminder.

Peipei smiled sweetly. "Why so serious? I never expected these locals would be so susceptible. My skills were almost wasted."

Guo Yi pondered briefly. "We'll proceed with establishing the intelligence station as planned. Construction of the frontline base will be expedited. But whether restaurant or inn, we still face personnel shortages. I'll find solutions. Meanwhile, please remain aboard—avoid complications. This sort of work isn't suitable for your involvement." Peipei smiled faintly and nodded her acquiescence.

Xiao Zishan intervened. "Let's discuss post-landing operations." As delegation leader, he was responsible only for meeting Gao Ju and procuring the Industrial Department's requirements. Forward station establishment fell entirely under Guo Yi's authority.

"We'll split up. Commissioner Xiao, you meet with Gao Ju and Manager Sun about cooperation—you're already acquainted. I'll take Old Yan and the others; Liu Gang can show us Guangzhou's markets and scout for shop locations. Everyone else stays aboard for now."

"I'll return to the mansion first and send sedan chairs and mule carts to collect everyone. Let them relax there. Bei Wei knows Sun Chang—he can lead the group." Xiao Zishan knew everyone had been cooped up for five or six days. Keeping them confined aboard would only cause trouble. He left Bei Wei to maintain order.

Arrangements settled, after a brief preparation, Xiao Zishan—protected by special forces operatives and the North American contingent—set off toward Guangzhou city.

Xiao Zishan felt a certain familiarity revisiting old haunts, while the others were purely curious. Most hadn't even visited Lingao's county seat. Now suddenly finding themselves in southern China's most prosperous commercial city of this era—"dazzled" was entirely fitting.

But this wasn't sightseeing time. Returning to the mansion on Huifu Street, they found Caretaker Sun Chang and the Gao family staff unchanged. Seeing the master return, everyone was delighted. During their year-plus absence, the mansion had been properly restored: walls and embankments renovated, rubble cleared, buildings repaired. A vegetable garden had even been planted in the courtyard.
