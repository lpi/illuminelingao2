# Chapter 122: Commercial Planning

The plan for the East Gate Market started from the outer moat of Bairren Fortress's east gate, extending 300 meters westward—constructing a main street named "East Gate Street." Cross-streets would be placed every 100 meters on each side, creating a "one vertical, two horizontal" layout. Plots of varying sizes along the streets could be sold to merchants for self-built shops. The transmigrators would also construct shop fronts along East Gate Street for merchant rentals.

"This plan is enormous. Never mind the construction resource consumption—does Lingao have enough merchants to rent your shop fronts? You're not expecting vegetable peddlers to rent, are you?"

"Lingao's economy is minuscule—basically subsistence. Isn't this market exaggerated?" Cheng Dong expressed concern.

Dongmen Chuiyu was confident. "This is long-term planning. We'll start with Phase One."

Phase One included 100 meters of street with accompanying drainage and a mule and horse inn, which were common along old highways and major markets. Such inns had large courtyards for tethering animals and parking carts, warehouses for temporary goods storage, and kitchens with cooking facilities but no meals—guests cooked for themselves. Lodging was mainly dormitories, with some private rooms. They were common stopovers for small-to-medium traveling merchants.

A restaurant—he added that the transmigrators' contact with locals was increasing. They needed an outside dining and meeting place. Normally, it could also serve wealthy merchants.

Across from the Administration building, a merchant hall would be built. This borrowed from British East India Company trading posts: a high-walled compound containing trading offices, cargo warehouses and storage yards, plus guest rooms, dining rooms, and meeting rooms for important merchants.

Originally, running water to East Gate Market was planned, but a long-distance water supply was still difficult. Instead, the plan was changed to dig several wells, one of which would be public, providing free drinking water for people and animals. Finally, there would be public toilets, as locals doing business here defecating everywhere had become very troublesome.

Even landscaping was considered—mind you, Bairren Fortress itself had no landscaping yet. East Gate Street would have tree-lined sidewalks, with species to be selected by the Agricultural Department. Wu Nanhai immediately said he'd research it.

For security, Dugu Qiuhun saw no concerns. The major structures would be made of brick and stone, and the doors and windows would be iron-plated. The merchant hall's wall corners would each have a watchtower. Even if attacked, breaching would take time—Bairren Fortress's earthwork wall blockhouses and watchtowers were right there. For petty disturbances like theft, he requested ten sets each of stab vests, stab gloves, and batons—forming the "East Gate Market Comprehensive Enforcement Squad" from the current staff—"guaranteeing nobody causes trouble here."

"We can provide those," Wen Desi said. "But how do you plan to attract investment?"

"Let me explain the overall strategy—it's big and complex. May I?"

Given permission, Dongmen Chuiyu picked up his file folder. This commercial plan was mainly developed with Yan Maoda and Zhang Xin. Yan Maoda, a jewelry company manager, had gone to Guangzhou with Xiao Zishan. Zhang Xin was a small shipyard's sales section chief. In commercial ability, Dongmen Chuiyu could only bow in admiration. But those two had no interest in local commerce and didn't bother competing with Dongmen. Cooperation was pleasant.

East Gate Market's current prosperity relied on the transmigrators' large-scale procurement. With 500-plus high-consuming modern people, the huge purchasing volume attracted many traders. But market development supported only by bulk institutional purchasing was limited. How could they bring the whole county—even neighboring counties—here to trade and consume? Their first proposal was to build roads.

Bairren Fortress's location was ideal—precisely midway between the county seat and Bopu Bay (the gateway port). It was centered on the county's most developed, most populated banks of the Wenlan River and was geographically well-connected. The Bairren–Bopu highway was complete, and the county seat extension was under construction. Soon, the county seat and Bopu Port would be fully connected. Mainland merchants could conveniently reach the county seat, and river bank residents could easily access the county.

However, the highway was east of the river, so west bank residents couldn't enjoy convenient transport. Dongmen Chuiyu proposed building a footbridge upstream of the Bairren Hydroelectric Station, linking north-south traffic. Then, nearby commoners wouldn't need to detour via the Wenlan River Bridge at the South Gate.

As long as traffic continuously flowed through Bairren Fortress, East Gate Market—the highway's only market—would become a hub for personnel and goods. Commerce would naturally flourish.

Wen Desi endorsed the bridge proposal. Now with west bank industrial zone operations, the transmigrators' own personnel and material transport was inconvenient. Building a bridge benefited both purposes.

Dongmen Chuiyu noted commoners currently didn't dare use the highway, as there were blockhouses and vehicles running on it. Everyone was intimidated.

"That's easily solved." Wen Desi frowned. "But people here have no concept of traffic rules. Will our vehicles run people over?"

"Unlikely. We have few vehicles—only dispatched for important matters. Currently, the fastest are bicycles, and the largest are four-wheeled wagons. Safety issues are minimal."

The second proposal: attract outside merchants. The Commercial Department had clearly learned from Intelligence that Lingao was not a good market. Its economic structure wasn't just subsistence—it was particularly backward subsistence. Economic capacity and purchasing power couldn't compare to Jiangnan or Guangdong—not even average northern densely populated regions. The standard transmigrator "quick fortune" method—mass-selling "clever crafts" and modern goods (mirrors, glass cups, lighters)—wouldn't work here. They could only sell to the mainland. Ideally, merchants should come to purchase, rather than them delivering goods.

Besides future industrial products, Lingao itself had many exportable local specialties. Historical research showed the Ming era's major exports included cattle, salt, rattan (red and white), and betel nut. Rattan and betel nut mostly came from Li minority areas—processed locally, then exported to the mainland. These were the most profitable commodities.

Yet historically, except for salt shipped from Bopu and Ma'ao ports, most exports went to the prefectural capital, shipping from Shenying Port. If exports could shift to Bopu Port, the well-connected East Gate Market would become the collection point for mainland merchant purchasing.

"We can't control the betel nut trade yet—but we already control salt production. I propose fully monopolizing salt production and sales—making the East Gate Market salt shop Lingao's salt wholesale headquarters. Complete control of wholesale. Merchants wanting salt must come to Bairren Fortress." Dongmen Chuiyu's eyes gleamed—monopoly, oh monopoly! How much money came from it!

Other suggestions included abolishing Bopu Port's "water tax" and berthing fees to attract coastal trading ships. They would provide good business environments—tax exemptions, warehousing and transport services. Dongmen Chuiyu even proposed using the Guangzhou outpost for a Hainan–Guangzhou commercial wireless telegraph service—providing daily Guangzhou-Macau market price bulletins.

With these benefits, mainland merchants would naturally shift local product purchasing and processing centers to Lingao. The accompanying permanent and transient population inflow would obviously stimulate the economy. When the transmigrators eventually produced modern industrial goods, they could use these merchants' channels for mainland sales and material procurement, avoiding doing everything themselves.

This commercial plan was approved. The Construction Engineering Group groaned—their tasks were overwhelming: the county road had just been completed; Damei Village's nearly 200 relocated households needed housing; and Bairren Fortress itself had ongoing projects. Now, East Gate Market development was added. The brick kilns and cement kilns ran day and night. Labor shortages were everywhere. Ma Qianzhu, coordinating everything, was overwhelmed.

He summoned Wu Nanhai, his face grim. "Nanhai, your workload is increasing. From now on, prepared 800 additional meals daily—supplying the Damei Village migrants. Engineering urgently needs this labor force."

This notification made Wu Nanhai gasp: he'd previously provided at most 700 daily meals. Adding 800 more suddenly was a Great Leap-style leap. Never mind anything else—even the kitchen equipment wasn't sufficient.

"The Planning Committee just brought the Gou Manor spoils—kitchen and daily use items. Go pick what you need." Ma Qianzhu, seated behind a huanghuali wood table, scribbled a note, stamped his personal seal, and handed it over—there were no official seals yet; documents were validated by Committee members' and group leaders' signatures or personal stamps.

"We don't farm—just cooking is overwhelming!" Wu Nanhai exploded—recently, constant cooking duty left no time for his beloved agriculture.

"Select whoever you need. Pick women from the Damei Village migrants to help. Must be reliable—no Gou family connections whatsoever. Also: locals can't handle our food—keep cooking areas separate. Understand?"

"How would I know who has Gou family connections?"

"Security is conducting individual vetting. As materials come out batch by batch, you select batch by batch."
