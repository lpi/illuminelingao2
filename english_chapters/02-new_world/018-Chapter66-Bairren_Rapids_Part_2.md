# Chapter 66: Bairren Rapids (Part 2)

Through casual conversation, they learned this family had rented a boat for a Hainan trip, suddenly encountered a storm and lost their way, then were captured aboard the ship. Old Master Ming Qiu had served for many years in the Navy's South Sea Fleet stationed on Hainan, later transferring to civil affairs work. Old Lady Li Mei had been a leader at a trading company for many years—no wonder her composed manner and tactful speech. As for the ever-silent son Ming Lang, he was a civil servant in the work-safety supervision department. The family still could not make sense of their ordeal.

"That Commissioner Xiao kept saying this is 1628 Lingao County—what nonsense! My old man was in Hainan's navy for twenty-two years. He has been to Lingao countless times... That Xiao looks like a proper young man; he does not seem mentally ill."

So they were in the same boat—Guo Yi thought: *Actually, we are just as clueless.* As they talked, the old man who had been wandering the riverbank examining stone carvings suddenly walked back, his face dreadful, his eyes glazed.

Li Mei hurried to help him sit. Seeing his state, she panicked—when had this old man ever become so lost and despairing? Could he have been possessed in this wilderness? Those bodies on the road earlier were truly strange.

They asked repeatedly how he was feeling. Finally, Old Master Ming raised his head and said two words:

"It is over."

This alarmed the whole family. The old man was usually stubborn, never one to admit defeat—why would he suddenly say this?

"Dad, do not scare us..." Ming Lang quickly steadied his father.

"What happened? You are scaring me to death with this cryptic talk!" Li Mei was practically hopping with anxiety.

"This really is Lingao!"

"What?!" The four people sitting on rocks all cried out. The two ATF agents, having no concept of Lingao, stared in confusion.

"That is right." Old Master Ming tremblingly pointed at the boulder carved with "Bairren Rapids." "This is Lingao's Bairren Rapids." He pulled out a yellowed small photo album from his coat; inside were old photographs.

"Look at this one!" Everyone crowded close. In the photo, a middle-aged Ming Qiu in naval officer uniform stood with comrades beside an identical boulder—also clearly carved with "Bairren Rapids"!

"So what," Ming Lang spoke hesitantly. "We just reached Bairren Rapids."

"Look at the background!" The old man grew agitated.

Everyone looked again. In the photo's background, a dam was visible in the distance. But now, looking up, behind this identical "Bairren Rapids" carving—there was no dam at all!

*(Note: The Bairren Rapids stone carving is located between the hydroelectric dam and power station, so the photo could easily capture both.)*

This sent chills down everyone's spine. *Where is the dam?* Mu Min said, "They are shutting down small hydroelectric plants now—maybe it was demolished..."

"No, impossible." The old man shook his head stubbornly. "Bairren Rapids Power Station has always been Lingao's main power station. How could they tear it down? My friends in Lingao never mentioned it."

"Maybe he forgot to mention it."

"I came to Bairren Rapids a few years ago. The surroundings were not like this! There should be a farm nearby," the old man continued. "But the terrain is exactly the same! The stones in the water, the carvings..." He flipped through photos. "During my navy years, I came to Bairren Rapids at least ten times. I photographed all the carvings and strange rocks..."

"Actually, since I approached the rapids, I have been suspicious... the surroundings feel too strange..." The old man's hands trembled. "I kept feeling I had been here before, like a dream."

Guo Yi grabbed the album and scrambled down to the riverbed for comparison. Photo by photo, the more he compared, the more his heart raced. He understood why the old man had been so shaken—it was too uncanny. Unless two identical terrains existed in the world, the current scene was inexplicable. Those carved stones in the photos—the characters, the stone shapes, positions in the water—no matter how he compared, everything indicated: *This was the same place.*

If there was any difference: here were large rocks not in the photos. And things in the photos were missing here: the vanished dam and certain carvings. He studied carefully for a long time and discovered a terrifying fact: *All the carvings were pre-Qing Dynasty!* And the Ming-era carvings were clearest, least weathered. In Old Ming's photos, one carving read "Linjiang Tianlai" with a large inscription. The upper line clearly stated: "Spring of the first year of Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty." Guo Yi found that stone—completely blank. Still not giving up, he called over the self-proclaimed trace expert Xue Ziliang to examine all the stones that should have carvings, checking for grinding or chiseling marks. Xue Ziliang scraped away thick moss, examined the stones for a long time, then declared these stones had never been carved.

*(Note: The above carvings can still be seen at modern Bairren Rapids, mostly from the Qing Dynasty; Ming-era ones are rare now but were recorded in the county annals.)*

Guo Yi's expression when he returned made everyone more panicked. Suddenly, the other three Mings all rushed down to the riverbed. The two bewildered ATF agents' faces also turned ugly.

The current situation perfectly matched "neither advance nor retreat." No one wanted to believe this was ancient China, but the evidence was overwhelming—no hypothesis could explain it away. Continue upstream or immediately return to the estuary? Everyone had lost their bearings, feeling hollow inside.

Going forward—who knew what they would encounter? One attack meant there would be another. They did not even know who attacked them or why. After discussion, they decided: having reached Bairren Rapids, the county seat was only four or five kilometers away. Better to go look. If nothing else, these wounded needed People's Hospitals. If Lingao had no People's Hospitals—only a county yamen—they would have to return to Bopu. At least those crazy people at the beach camp did not seem murderous, and there had been a Red Cross flag flying.

They split into two groups: Old Master Ming, Guo Yi, and Xue Ziliang would scout Lingao together. The others would stay here—Bairren Rapids' complex terrain made hiding easy. Guo Yi objected that the old man's age made the long trek too taxing, but Ming Qiu said he knew the area—he could tell at a glance whether it was Lingao, preventing them from stumbling around. Xue Ziliang worried the remaining group was mostly women—too dangerous. Ming Qiu said no problem: his son and daughter-in-law were both fighters. Besides the policewoman, his son had regularly gotten into knife fights in middle school, acquiring rich street-brawling experience—a claim Guo Yi deeply doubted.

The new Lingao scout team left their luggage, taking only poles, daggers, and minimal food. Ming Qiu told his wife, "If we are not back in two hours, head back immediately." The family's separation was emotional. The old lady teared up, warning him not to overexert, then repeatedly entrusted the two gentlemen to look after the old man. This apparently wounded the old man's pride—he snorted, stood, and walked off without a word.

Guo Yi and Xue Ziliang hurried to catch up. The three trekked toward the county seat.

Their expedition went smoothly. Along the way, Old Master Ming recognized more familiar scenery. When Lingao County's outline appeared and Ming Qiu saw the city walls that were never in his memory—he could not speak for a long time. When they saw the stockade being built outside the gate and the ant-like ancient laborers swarming up and down, all three faces went white. Xue Ziliang sat down heavily, head in hands, muttering in English.

*Such impossibly low probability—no, something that should not even be possible—why did it happen to me? Why not win twenty million in the lottery instead?!* Guo Yi felt like a thousand arrows through his heart.

After standing dumbstruck for a while, there was nothing to discuss. Get back to Bopu—fast. At least there was a group of twenty-first-century modern people there, and more importantly, they were all Chinese. Xue Ziliang, deeply shaken, muttered in English the whole way back, nonstop.

**D+1, 13:20** — The Bopu–Bairren Rapids highway survey team radioed: multiple bodies floating downriver on the Wenlan flats—apparently all local natives.

**D+1, 14:36** — The reconnaissance squad below Lingao City reported: someone had led a small group of militia into the town.

**D+1, 15:02** — The Bopu–Bairren Rapids highway survey team reported: the two groups who had departed that morning had returned, battered and shell-shocked, repeatedly demanding to see leadership.

"Little Yu, it seems your plan worked," Xiao Zishan said to Yu Eshui, half compliment, half concern.

"A lion's dung surpasses bear manure." Little Yu was unruffled. "They apparently had a rough time on the road."

"Commissioner Xiao, will you see them?" Li Yuanyuan asked.

"No," Xiao Zishan said gruffly. "You receive them. Get them settled first. Oh—tell Ran Yao to issue each one a temporary ID."

"Temporary ID?" Li Yuanyuan paused. She had handled Committee paperwork for nearly a year. She had never heard of such a thing.

"Yes, temporary. Ran Yao knows. They are not official transmigrators yet."
