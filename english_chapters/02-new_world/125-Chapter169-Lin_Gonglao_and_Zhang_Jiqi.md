# Chapter 169: Lin Gonglao and Zhang Jiqi

Transporting people and materials presented a new challenge. The removal of the Gou Manor population had been an overland operation. This time, everything would go by sea—a chance to accumulate experience for future mass migrations.

"The Navy can send landing craft," Chen Haiyang said. "The *Dengyingzhou* is busy with the Guangzhou run—it can't be moved."

"How much can the *Fubo* carry?"

"About seventy to eighty people." Chen Haiyang did some quick calculations. "Less than the *Dengyingzhou*—the cannons and ammunition take up a lot of tonnage."

"And the six transport ships?"

"All small—each can carry thirty to forty people." Chen Haiyang continued calculating. "We also captured the village's two 200-*liao* ships plus five or six small boats. All usable—capacity shouldn't be a problem."

"How long by sea?"

"With sailboats, generously estimated—two days."

"Provisions?"

"Grassland-5 works. It's durable and filling." Chen Haiyang obviously disliked the rock-hard rice cakes.

"Transporting people is no problem—one wave with the big ships can handle it. Common folk have few possessions. But the timber, iron, hemp, and tung oil will occupy significant tonnage."

Xi Yazhou said, "The Army should partially withdraw. With five platoons and three cannons deployed here, home is somewhat empty."

Dongmen Chuiyu suggested, "Starting tomorrow, each departing ship takes one squad. Troop transport and escort combined. We'll leave one platoon until the new ship launches. Is Bopu prepared? Over five hundred people arriving suddenly!"

"Wu De has a plan. Housing is still being built, so they'll use the quarantine camp first—it's currently empty."

"With the *Fubo* here—does that affect Bopu's defenses? The situation is tense," Wen Desi recalled.

"Four fishing trawlers are enough. They all have breech-loading cannons. High mobility, high speed, high firepower—anyone attacking them would be committing suicide."

"Tomorrow, the first wave moves the entire Lin and Lu families." Wen Desi's lips curved slightly. "Leave Shipwright Zhang to continue building."

The next day, all of Baitu erupted in chaos. Adults shouted, children cried, and women wailed. The transmigrators were prepared: they had determined who went first and who later, distributing five-colored paper slips accordingly.

The beach had rope lanes with matching colored flags. Slip holders followed their color to the correct ships—there was no confusion. The ships had specially brought hundreds of strapped rattan baskets and ropes for luggage.

"Can this old ticket still board your passenger ship..." Li Haiping hummed on the *Fubo*'s stern castle, watching the struggling streams of elderly, young, and bundle-laden villagers shuffle along under the soldiers' urging.

Lin Gonglao glanced at the humming "bald bandit." It was a strange tune—as strange as their clothing. The clan elder called them "Chiefs," bowing obsequiously. He feared their firearms: that checkpoint stockade, including the purchased cannon, had cost the village hundreds of *liang*. The short-term workers stationed there had been expensive too. Hundreds of local bandits could not have touched it—yet these people had smashed it in minutes.

Now that he was captured, his future was unknown. Lin Gonglao was especially annoyed. He was a member of the Lin clan—the clan leader was his uncle. Born and raised in Baitu, he had never suffered hardship, belonging to the village's "ruling class." Like the other second-generation Lin and Lu members, he had no interest in his ancestors' crafts and had learned only the basics. He preferred martial arts—leading short-term workers in drilling, and dragging anyone who annoyed him to the Shenming Pavilion for a beating. He had strutted around like he owned the place.

Obviously, those days were over. Growing increasingly annoyed, he suddenly felt someone bump his back. Turning, he saw Wang Sangou—a fifty-something bachelor and clan-kept laborer, basically the Lin clan's communal slave.

Already irritable—and now struck by a slave—his back ached with the impact. Rage erupted. He raised his palm and slapped, then raised his leg and kicked.

"Coffin scraper! Got no eyes?!"

Wang Sangou, loaded with bags, had been shuffling along in the line. The palm strike and kick sent him sprawling. Several young Lin clansmen saw his ridiculous pose and laughed. The older ones grimaced and quickly pulled away the laughing children.

The striking and cursing blocked the queue. Soldiers rushed over to clear the jam. Li Haiping saw everything clearly from the stern castle and shook his head. *Such a tiny place, yet there are already petty tyrants.*

"Who's that?" someone asked.

"He's from the Lin clan, apparently. I heard the kid's quite arrogant. Even after the clan elder surrendered, he was still resentful," Li Haiping said casually.

"Such a tough character?"

Lin Gonglao—after beating Wang Sangou—felt refreshed. He victoriously added more kicks. Just as he was getting enthusiastic, a burly man pushed through the crowd, carrying a cudgel.

"What's going on?!" The man bellowed. "Nothing better to do than fight?!"

"I dare not." Wang Sangou scrambled up, begging. "No fighting—no fighting—"

Lin Gonglao was still young and hot-blooded. He had not adjusted to his changed status and arrogantly faced the newcomer:

"I'm beating my slave—what's it to—"

Mid-sentence—*WHANG.* Stars spun before his eyes. When consciousness returned, he was on the ground, his head burning with pain. He touched it—a large bump was already forming. The "bald bandit" stood there with the cudgel, glaring at him sideways.

"Do you know manners? Opening your mouth with 'this master,' closing your mouth with 'this master'—am I the same generation as your father?"

Lin Gonglao nearly fainted from rage. But "wise men don't fight impossible odds"—he understood that much. He silently rose and prepared to leave.

"Stop!" The voice came from behind. Lin Gonglao suppressed his fury, trying to appear mild:

"What?"

"You're so strong—help the old man carry his things."

Lin Gonglao almost exploded—but the throbbing in his head reminded him: times had changed. Reluctantly, he picked up a basket from Wang Sangou, who frantically declined.

"Did you grow up eating shit?" The man's words were vicious and cutting. "A young fellow carrying just this?"

Lin Gonglao silently picked up two more bundles, mentally cursing these bald bandits' eighteen generations of ancestors.

Walking through the line, there was a sudden burst of laughter. Without looking, he knew: it was not the Lin clan laughing—it must be the laborers and such. People who had formerly smiled obsequiously, not daring to meet his eye, now dared to laugh at him openly!

Seething with resentment, he followed the crowd to the gangplank. Straw packs were piled nearby—everyone got one. Opening it, he found a bamboo tube with a stopper—apparently water. There was also a paper-wrapped item. Tearing it slightly, he saw biscuits.

Thoughtful preparation. Lin Gonglao touched the bump on his head, wondering what the future held. He was slightly afraid, understanding a simple truth: the world was no longer just Baitu Village.

Zhou Dongtian smugly returned to the stern castle. Li Haiping chuckled: "You're quite the social justice warrior."

"With such brats, you must knock off their arrogance—otherwise there'll be more trouble later. This world is *ours*!" Zhou Dongtian twirled his cudgel. "I even held back—otherwise there'd be no visible injuries, but internal damage..."

"Careful—making corpses is useless." Li Haiping privately wondered: *Why did the Executive Committee send this printer here?* Probably for interrogations—he and Zhou shared quarters, and he often saw him return late, smiling mysteriously. Later he learned: the Security Group called him for every interrogation.

After sending off the first wave, Wen Desi personally inspected the confiscated treasures. There was abundant timber: camphor, fir, and pine—over five hundred logs. Various hardwoods: Hainan sandalwood, Guangdong lychee wood, ironwood—over one hundred logs. There were over a thousand bamboo poles. Also pig iron, tung oil, yellow hemp, white hemp, palm fiber, and oyster shells.

In the warehouses, there were various ship fittings including several forged four-claw iron grapnels. Abundant sails, ropes, and nails. Many weapons. Wen Desi's inspection found over ten cannons—all British-made, specifically East India Company cast 24-pounder ship guns. Short-barreled carronades unique to Britain. The "unusable" muskets were British-made matchlocks. The British were clearly active here.

According to Shipwright Zhang: "Red-hairs" sometimes came for fresh water and minor repairs. They paid with powder, weapons, and foreign silver.

"You can repair red-hair ships?" Wen Desi asked.

"Red-hair ships differ from ours—but ships are ships," Shipwright Zhang said respectfully. He was in his early forties, had the best craftsmanship, built large ships, and was said to have "many ingenious ideas."

"Could you *build* red-hair ships?"

"The sails—" He hesitated. "Not enough cloth." He thought for a moment. "Also, the rigging is complex. The operating mechanisms are intricate. Without foreign craftsmen, I probably can't replicate them."

"These things I know—"

Shipwright Zhang glanced at this "bald person" in surprise. *Could such a pampered gentleman actually understand these things?*

"Then I'm willing to try."

"What's your name?"

"This humble one is Zhang Jiqi."

Wen Desi paused, then laughed. "Good, good. Coming to our place, you'll truly live up to your name." *Jiqi* sounded exactly like the word for "Machine"—a perfect fit for the industrial future awaiting him.
