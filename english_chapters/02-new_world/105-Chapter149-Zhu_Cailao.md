# Chapter 149: Zhu Cailao

After interrogation by the Security Group, the captured pirates quickly confessed everything. Unexpectedly, they weren't subordinates of the famous Liu Xiang, but of Zhu Cailao.

Zhu Cailao operated primarily in Guangdong waters. While his group wasn't as renowned as the Zheng family, Liu Xiang, Li Kuiqi, or Zhong Lingxiu among the maritime powers of the era, he had started his career much earlier than Zheng Zhilong. In the 48th year of the Wanli reign—while Zheng Zhilong was still a subordinate of Yan Siqi—Zhu Cailao already commanded both northern and southern fleets. In February, April, and July of that year, he'd launched three attacks on Jieyang, followed by an attack on Chenghai in September. In the first year of the Tianqi reign, he attacked Jieyang again. His maritime group had been extremely active throughout the Tianqi era.

From the prisoners, the transmigrators learned the organizational structure of these merchant-pirate maritime groups. Though they possessed a unified organization and leadership, operations were conducted based on "shares." As mid-level units between leadership and individual ships, "share bosses" played a crucial command role. They appointed ship captains, transmitted the chieftain's orders, and took responsibility for their subordinates' actions. Share sizes varied: small shares might control two or three ships, while large ones could command up to forty. Relationships with the chieftain depended on loyalty and proximity—non-core shares operated freely but followed internal rules and paid a percentage of their plunder and trade earnings to the chieftain. However, when the chieftain marshaled his forces, all shares were obligated to participate unconditionally.

The three ships the transmigrators captured belonged to one of Zhu Cailao's share bosses—a core member of his fleet. Their mission to Lingao was deeply connected to the Gou family.

The Gou family—the local power the transmigrators had "butchered"—had been Zhu Cailao's major fence. Much of his loot was stored at Lingao and then sold through the Gou family's connections in Qiongshan into the broader Guangdong market.

News of the Gou family's destruction took half a month to reach Zhu Cailao. Gou Second, the family's contact in Lingao, had vanished from the county seat the day after the Gou Manor fell—without even notifying Zhu Cailao. The clear-thinking Gou Second had calculated the situation: this great sea pirate wouldn't accept such losses lightly. Reporting the incident would mean paying massive compensation—possibly leading to bankruptcy. Worse, Zhu Cailao would likely retaliate against the short-hairs, and as a Lingao native, Gou Second would be conscripted as the vanguard. Neither side was to be trifled with, so his best option was to disappear completely. As for avenging his brother—Zhu Cailao would naturally handle the short-hairs. Let the sea pirate act; it was safer than risking his weakened local power.

Thus, Zhu Cailao was completely blindsided until his liaisons found the Gou Manor in ruins, with a new fortress built atop its remains. Only then did he learn the Gou family was finished. He sought Gou Second in the county seat, but the man had vanished without a trace. Subsequent investigation revealed the full story.

The destruction of his fence and the loss of his loot was devastating news for Zhu Cailao. The newly recruited Zheng Zhilong was preparing to attack him, and just when he needed ships and troops for defense, this crushing blow struck. Years of accumulated resources had been destroyed. Beyond the financial loss, the incident seriously shook his subordinates' confidence. Pirate groups were alliances built on profit. When a chieftain's resources were destroyed and he could no longer guarantee his members' interests, affiliates naturally grew restless. Rivals circled, poaching his share bosses. Suddenly, dozens of shares controlling over a hundred ships departed without notice or refused his summons.

The transmigrators hadn't anticipated that their plan to "improve their meals" by destroying the Gou family would trigger a chain reaction along the southeastern coast. The biggest beneficiary turned out to be their greatest anticipated enemy: the Zheng family group. A furious Zhu Cailao immediately dispatched multiple shares to Lingao to gather intelligence—who had dared to disturb the tiger?

Soon, information about the short-hairs reached him. He had heard of them earlier—that strange giant iron ship had been the subject of fishing gossip for months. The Gou eldest son had mentioned these odd short-hairs who called themselves "Australian merchants." He knew their firearms were formidable and that they had completely defeated the local militia.

Zhu Cailao had worried about these "Australian pirates"—in this era, sea merchants and pirates were one and the same—appearing in his territory. But after landing, they had stayed put, neither trading nor raiding. At Lingao, they maintained an ambiguous coexistence: "don't provoke me, and I won't provoke you." With the threat from the Zheng family looming, he had tacitly tolerated the short-hairs' presence.

Now, however, Zhu Cailao faced two choices. First: immediately muster his forces to punish the short-hairs, recover his wealth, and restore his reputation. Previously, he would have done so unhesitatingly. But now, with Zheng Zhilong threatening him and the short-hairs proving themselves formidable, mutual destruction would only benefit Zheng. Second: ignore the incident and concentrate on anti-Zheng preparations. The problem was that without the Gou family's stored resources, he couldn't quickly acquire the supplies he needed.

While he deliberated, scouts reported that the short-hairs possessed incredibly fast ships. These vessels matched large Guangzhou ships in size but possessed unmatched speed—faster than any vessel they had seen, including European sailing ships. Since they lacked sails, they couldn't be attacked with fire. Possessing such ships would provide a tremendous advantage to his fleet.

Thus, Zhu Cailao resolved to attack the short-hairs. He dispatched numerous scouts to investigate Lingao, also learning from fishermen about the transmigrators' hegemony over the fishing grounds—their "fast ships" patrolled daily to catch poachers. From his scouts, he learned several key facts:

First, the short-hairs' muskets were extremely accurate, with long range, high lethality, and a rapid rate of fire.

Second, despite their formidable muskets, the short-hairs lacked cannons. Even their fast ships only mounted strange, oversized crossbows.

Third, there were only four fast ships in total. Usually, only one patrolled the fishing grounds while the others stayed in the harbor—apparently, they were precious. The enormous iron ship remained anchored and motionless.

Fourth, the short-hairs numbered roughly a thousand. There were both real and fake "baldies," and they were indistinguishable in quantity. They were divided between Bairren Beach and Bopu Harbor. Both locations were fortified, though Bopu was weaker with fewer personnel. The former Gou Manor and a "salt village" were also their territories.

Zhu Cailao had never read military texts or understood formal strategy and tactics, but he possessed sufficient wisdom to judge approaches that would yield maximum benefit. Fundamentally a merchant, he understood cost-benefit analysis.

After a comprehensive assessment, Zhu Cailao made a wise decision. He would not wage full-scale war against the short-hairs. Combat would be limited to capturing the "fast ships" to strengthen his fleet. If possible, he would also capture some muskets.

The short-hairs had formidable muskets but lacked manpower and cannons. These two factors were things Zhu Cailao had in abundance. After consulting his key subordinates, he dispatched capable lieutenants to carry out the ship capture.

The strategy was clever. Under long-term observation by fisherman spies, they had discovered the transmigrators' patterns and methods and adopted countermeasures. They would use illegal fishing to lure the fast ships close for inspection, then use cannons and boarding tactics to clear the short-hairs. To avoid damaging the fast ships, all cannons were loaded with grapeshot. The ships even prepared two types of rope: thick ones for towing the fast ships, and thin ones for binding captured short-hairs—per orders, prisoners were to be treated well. The fast ships and muskets would only function if the captives taught them how to use them.

Everything had been planned meticulously. Against any ordinary ship, this plan would have succeeded. Fortunately, the fishing boats' era-transcending technology and the transmigrators' months of combat awareness defeated this perfect plan. The responsible share boss died in the battle.

Victory deserved celebration, but the danger remained. Nobody knew if Zhu Cailao had follow-up plans. If so, what was the scale of the coming attack? However the Security Group tortured the prisoners, they knew nothing more. The captured leaders swore and vowed they only knew the ship-capture plans and nothing else.

"Now everyone's busy again." He Ming thoughtfully produced a pack of cigarettes, about to light one before stopping himself. "Sorry—this is an ordnance factory. I'm confused." He tapped his forehead in apology.

"No problem—smoke if you want. We're not an explosives plant. Those cannons are just iron lumps—nothing will happen."

"Better not break the rules," He Ming said. "Tomorrow the Committee holds a response meeting. All department heads must attend. Bring several people from the Artillery Group. The current priority is Bopu's fortification and naval armament."

"Cannons are no problem—but the raw material supply is tight," Zhan Wuya said. "Coal is scarce."
