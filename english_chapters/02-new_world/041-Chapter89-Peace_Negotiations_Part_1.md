# Chapter 89: Peace Negotiations (Part 1)

The delegation nervously approached the earthen berm. Though the camp gate was closed, the trench had no drawbridge—just unexcavated roadway crossing it, which puzzled them. Actually, drawbridges could not handle the weight—heavy machinery needed to come and go; a drawbridge would be inconvenient.

At arrow-range, they stopped and sent someone to call. The camp gate apparently expected them—one call was answered. Zhang Xingfu, experienced with various pirate groups, spoke some Mandarin, Cantonese, and Min dialect. The camp guards spoke a strange, neither-fish-nor-fowl Mandarin. Still, they could communicate. Zhang Xingfu explained their purpose. Shortly, commotion at the gate—it opened. A dozen people emerged.

Zhang Xingfu knew that whether mountain or sea kings, leaders often liked putting on airs to intimidate negotiators into higher ransoms. He had seen this routine many times. But these pirates had no pomp—just a dozen ordinary green-clad short-coat people, rifles with bayonets slung. The apparent leader surprised him: dressed identically to the others in dark-green short jacket and trousers, dusty short boots, leather belt at the waist—externally indistinguishable from subordinates. His appearance, manner, and speech were rather refined and scholarly—no rough-and-tumble hero look at all.

*This shaven-head chief is so plain!* Zhang Xingfu thought inwardly.

The newcomer was very polite, introducing himself as Xi Yazhou, but did not invite them inside. He had chairs and benches brought out, placed on the riverbank outside the gate for them to sit. Others brought wooden bowls and buckets from the camp for the porters to drink.

What was served to Zhang Xingfu and his group made these local landlords' eyes widen: glass cups! Though they lived on Hainan Island, they knew glass cups' value: two or three taels of silver bought only a colored glass bowl, let alone such crystal-clear cups.

What was in the cups was unremarkable: a small white paper packet floating in water, slowly dyeing it pale green. Sniffing, it seemed vaguely tea-flavored—but very inferior.

*What grandeur!* Zhang Xingfu was both pleased and worried. Pleased that pirates using such fine things showed great sincerity. Worried that with such display, price negotiations would likely not settle for small sums.

This Xi Yazhou spoke some Cantonese; they exchanged pleasantries. Then rumbling came from inside the gate. A small four-wheeled vehicle bumped toward them, causing a stir on the riverbank. The shaven-heads' vehicles that moved without oxen or horses—this wonder had spread citywide. Some said they held sorcery, driven by ghost-gods; others said pirates had obtained Heaven-and-Earth creation techniques. Various theories abounded.

Zhang Xingfu knew from scouts and militia that those riding covered vehicles like this were high-ranking pirate chiefs. So the vehicle's occupants were important. He quickly rose trembling.

Those exiting the vehicle wore the same attire as before—nothing special. Then several more arrived on foot, one shaven-headed but wearing local cloth clothes—probably a captured local who had joined the pirates.

The interpreter Xiong Buyou's Lingao dialect sounded odd to Zhang Xingfu, but the meaning was clear. Xi Yazhou explained they were not pirates but overseas Chinese merchants in industry and trade, now returning to start businesses—*We've become "sea turtles" when?* Xiao Zishan thought, inwardly amused. Since arriving in Lingao, they had never disturbed commoners or opposed the government. Then his tone grew stern: he accused local "evil gentry" of groundlessly organizing militia attacks, causing losses. They had acted in forced self-defense and reserved freedom to take further action.

Zhang Xingfu could only meekly agree, praising their non-disturbance of civilians. He presented the gift list: one hundred taels silver, eight bolts red satin, twenty bolts assorted silk, twenty bolts Songjiang cotton, ten *shi* of grain (coarse and fine), two pigs, four suckling pigs, one Sambar deer, two hundred *jin* wine. Xi Yazhou took the list, passed it to those behind him. Finding everything useful, he smiled:

"We're building here, disturbing the locality. How dare we accept such generous gifts? But refusing would slight the gentry's goodwill. So we must accept everything. Truly—refusing would be impolite, accepting feels undeserved."

Zhang Xingfu, seeing gifts accepted, seized the moment to raise the gentry's three requests: first, with autumn harvest imminent, they hoped pirates would not rob working farmers; second, ransoming captured people; third, returning bodies of battle-dead for burial.

He promised: if agreed, county gentry would "assist with provisions"—they would not be shortchanged. Specific figures could be negotiated.

Xi Yazhou politely nodded without answering—this was significant. He looked inquiringly at Wen Desi and others behind him. They exchanged glances, then went to the tower guardroom to discuss. All agreed this involved future policy direction—a few people deciding was improper. But since the other side sought reconciliation, they should respond positively.

So when Xi Yazhou returned, he directly agreed that villages could send people and carts to retrieve bodies. They would provide guides to burial locations. As a gesture of sincerity, they would release a few wounded prisoners. As for the other two points, he said further discussion was needed—Zhang Xingfu should come again tomorrow.

Zhang Xingfu had not expected to settle everything in one visit. Seeing them readily agree to body retrieval and even release prisoners—clearly giving him face—remaining matters probably would not be difficult, just price-haggling. That did not worry him—gentry would bear costs; his commission would not shrink. And he had established relations with these shaven-heads—he already sensed these pirates were unlike any he had dealt with before.

Before leaving, per Wen Desi's instructions, Xi Yazhou gave Zhang Xingfu a freshwater pearl necklace originally priced at 25 RMB, and gave each porter fifty *wen* tip. Everyone high and low was satisfied with this strange group.

Magistrate Wu and all city officials and gentry anxiously awaited Zhang Xingfu's report. When he returned that afternoon, word was the shaven-heads would return bodies and release some prisoners. Hearing Zhang Xingfu describe the leaders as steady, plain people without bandit airs—all were surprised.

Previously, even when kidnappers' victims died, families retrieving bodies for burial required substantial ransom. This time, they had agreed so readily. Villages quickly conscripted laborers, rushed to make thin coffins, preparing to collect bodies tomorrow. Magistrate Wu, knowing many from each village had died, ordered the county poorhouse to help—any unclaimed bodies would be collected too.

Next day, village laborers came with carts, coffins, reed mats, and lime packets. The transmigrators arranged guides to show burial sites, then quickly withdrew. They only monitored from afar with high-power binoculars. The Sanitation Group checked wind direction—it would not blow smells toward camp. But everyone still donned masks without being told.

Xi Yazhou and several others monitored from the watchtower. Through binoculars, he saw cloth-wrapped laborers digging, periodically carrying dirt-stained objects aside. With each exhumed body, elderly and women rushed to identify remains. Some wailed to heaven; some fainted. After watching awhile, he could not bear to continue. Killing in battle never bothered him, but this post-battle horror was truly chilling.

"Should've cremated them from the start. Why burial? The state is too gruesome." Xi Yazhou knew those bodies had been buried over ten days—exhumed, besides clothing, they were decomposed beyond recognition.

"Burning bodies would breed resentment." Xiao Zishan refused to put his eyes to the binoculars. "That's 'scattering ashes.' Now families can at least collect bodies, find peace with burial—feel somewhat better. Call it winning hearts."

Originally, the Sanitation Group, for hygiene reasons, had suggested either pyre cremation in the field or dumping all in the sea at Bopu. Most had agreed. Yu Eshui opposed, arguing: ancients valued corpses greatly. "Collecting bones" had always been historically seen as righteous. Destroying bodies would severely damage transmigrator image—after all, this would be their base.

So they had buried in remote areas. They had thought it was just talk. Unexpectedly, the county negotiators' third condition was precisely body retrieval. Previous doubts about why Yu Eshui—this eloquent, dramatic talker—occupied a Committee seat completely vanished afterward.

After a full day, villages finally collected and transported all bodies. Some dead were village "refuse"—sent to die—naturally no one claimed them. The county poorhouse collected and buried them in the public cemetery.
