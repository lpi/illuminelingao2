# Chapter 101: Trade Agreement

The headman brought the team to an open field outside the village, instructing them to rest there. This Li village was completely different from the tourist-trap Li villages they'd visited in the modern era. First, it had no walls—it looked like a slightly larger ordinary village. Dense, thorny shrubs surrounded it, interwoven with various vines and bamboos into a living hedge—not even a rabbit could squeeze through. They'd never seen such a barrier before.

Second, the iconic Li "boat-shaped houses" they'd expected from tourist villages were nowhere to be found. Instead of those stilted structures with living quarters above and livestock below, these village houses were pyramid-shaped straw huts. Their walls were bamboo-strip lattice covered with mud—quite distinctive. Nanan Village was evidently the *dong*'s "capital."

Hainan's so-called *li-dong* were roughly divided by natural terrain, usually comprising several villages. *Dong* chiefs were government-recognized hereditary positions, issued seals and bronze credentials. Li native officials—*dong* chiefs and *tushe* administrators—had two main duties: to suppress Li commoners and maintain local peace and order; and to fulfill various government levies annually, including official taxes and private "lucky money" for officials. Naturally, they had to collect their own income too—native officials, large or small, received no government salary and had to collect it themselves. In other words, as long as they paid all official and unofficial "dues" on time, native officials could do whatever they wanted in their territory—they were basically local emperors.

Those staying outside were managed by Zhang Bailin. Everyone remained outwardly relaxed but internally alert, resting efficiently. Lu Rong, Wen Desi, and Mu Min followed the headman into the village to meet the *dong* chief.

Many curious Li people inside and outside the village watched from a distance, pointing. Wen Desi noticed several old women sitting on roadside rocks weaving rattan—their faces were densely tattooed with black patterns, their mouths solid black masses. Truly horrifying. *So this was Hainan's "Eighteen Oddities"—"old grannies look like monsters."* Seeing was believing. *(Note: Li women's face-tattooing continued until the 1950s. Tattooing served to prevent capture by outsiders and symbolized romantic fidelity. The black lips and teeth were purely from daily betel-nut chewing.)* Looking carefully, he noticed nearly all women were tattooed, except for young children. This shattered everyone's minority-maiden fantasies.

"This custom must be revolutionized," Wei Aiwen muttered. In his original plan, recruiting Li soldiers was step one; next, by commanding Li troops, he'd consolidate power—the crucial step being marrying a Li headman's daughter. He'd imagined Li girls based on movie images. But present reality severely shook his plan.

If a headman actually offered his daughter—should he accept? Truly troubling. Plus, local women got tattooed upon adulthood... He began fretting over castles in the air.

At the moment, never mind headmen—ordinary Li girls weren't interested in him either. For Li commoners, these were terrifying people: they'd heard these strangers' "powder guns" *(Note: Li term for firearms)* were formidable, firing continuously and killing from great distances. Survivors said gunfire was continuous—people died in droves.

Lu Rong's group was led into a large house in the village center. Taller than ordinary homes, it was built on a platform with bamboo-lattice beds on three sides for sitting or sleeping, leaving only a central corridor. The fire-pit was against the back wall, with bamboo racks above for smoking food. Side-windows provided light, but it was still quite dim—entering felt like blindness until one's eyes adjusted.

The *dong* chief was an old man—white hair, poor complexion. Later they learned he was just past fifty, though by 17th-century standards, that qualified as elderly anywhere. Lu Rong presented specially prepared gifts: one bottle of Red Star *Erguotou*, one bag of rock candy, and two folding knives.

Of these, the *Erguotou* in its glass bottle attracted the most attention. Though *baijiu* was common in Ming times, liquor in transparent colorless glass bottles was visually striking for anyone in this era. Clearly, a glass bottle serving merely as modern packaging was far more valuable to him than the liquor itself.

As for the two folding knives—the *dong* chief examined them, scratched a wooden board several times, and his eyes showed admiration.

"Such fine knives—even in the county seat, you can't buy these." The chief looked up at them, very surprised. "Where are you from? Qiongshan?"

Wen Desi launched into his Australian sea-merchant routine—practiced so often it was now very polished. The chief knew little about the outside world; the only Han area he'd visited was the Lingao County seat. The "great official" in Qiongzhou Prefecture—the Prefect—was the biggest official in his eyes. But hearing they weren't Ming people but overseas Chinese, he visibly relaxed. He ordered wine to be brought—rice wine made from glutinous *shanlang* rice grown by the Li. This wine later developed into the local specialty *Shanlan Yulu* ("Shanlang Jade Dew").

*Shanlang* wine was the simplest fermented glutinous rice—only seven days of brewing, minimal alcohol content, similar to modern sweet rice wine. All three drank a bowl.

With the wine as lubricant, discussions went easier, and they gleaned considerable local information. The chief's surname was Zhu—though unrelated to Zhu Yuanzhang; his family were so-called "banana children." Generations of them had been village headmen. During the Wanli-era *Mashi* Uprising, many Lingao *dong* were involved—but his family wasn't. After pacification, nearby villages were consolidated into one *dong*, and he was made *dong* chief. The entire *dong* comprised seven villages with over two thousand men, women, and children—one of Lingao's largest.

As for government—Chief Zhu said recent county magistrates were manageable, their demands modest. Sending annual "regulation fees" kept them satisfied. Only in recent years had road insecurity increased, with fewer Han peddlers reaching Li areas. Salt was already expensive; now prices were worse. If sea-merchants could bring salt, they'd take any quantity, exchanging hides, red-and-white rattan, betel nuts, and cattle. The bribed Headman Fu added: best if they could sell iron goods too—farming tools and knives were scarce here.

These conditions were expected; Lu Rong agreed to all. Salt and iron couldn't yet be manufactured, but production was imminent—supply wouldn't be a problem. Comparatively, Li territory offered many useful products: timber, cotton cloth, hides, rattan, pigs and cattle—all urgently needed.

On pricing, Wen Desi decided against exploitation. Operating like itinerant peddlers—selling small quantities with huge markups—meant low volumes. Of course, ancient productivity was low, transport capacity poor, and road travel risky—high-profit methods were understandable. But for transmigrators with large-scale industrial production capacity, that approach was unsuitable. Exorbitant salt prices might yield high profits, but commoners would minimize consumption to survival levels—resulting in low sales. Lower prices meant consumer demand would immediately rise.

His salt price pleased Chief Zhu and the headman—only one-third of peddlers' prices. Yet even this made Wen Desi feel like a profiteer. Salt was measured temporarily in official *dou*—Wen Desi decided upon return to produce measuring instruments, using trade to spread transmigrator units of measurement. For iron goods, he didn't yet know Ming iron prices, so he only promised they'd certainly be cheaper than peddlers.

After bargaining, they reached their first trade agreement since arriving in this timespace—historically: *The Nanan Village Trade Agreement*. Its terms: transmigrators could sell any goods to Nanan *dong*, but each trade must include certain quantities of salt and iron. Nanan *dong* would exchange any goods transmigrators needed—except people.

The 80 kg of salt brought on this trip netted over seventy cowhides, deerskins, and wild-boar skins; forty bolts of Qiong-cloth; and one water buffalo. The piled goods made everyone feel like profiteers—they didn't yet know specialized Li-trade peddlers could exchange one *jin* (old *jin*, 594g) of coarse salt for a 20–30 *jin* pig.

The Li also felt they'd profited: hides were abundant in every village—easily obtained in their eyes; Qiong-cloth was women's home-spun fabric—worthless.

The chief additionally gifted twelve bolts of kudzu cloth. Kudzu cloth was a famous Ming-era Hainan product—moisture-wicking and heat-dissipating, a premium summer fabric. Each returned prisoner's family contributed one pig as thanks for their release. Everyone was satisfied. Chief Zhu summoned all the villages' *aoya* to drink. At the feast, he produced two arrows. First, he had someone loudly recite the agreement, then he carved nine notches on one arrow and handed the other to Lu Rong.

"You also carve nine notches." Mu Min explained that this was the arrow-cutting ceremony, signifying that both parties must honor the terms. Violators would be fined ninety cattle and ninety *liang* of silver.

After cutting arrows, they drank several more bowls of rice wine. Both sides designated liaisons: for transmigrators, Lu Rong; for Nanan *dong*, local *aoya* Fu Dayou. Wen Desi then proposed staying in Nanan several more days to see what local products they might need. If available, these could offset salt-and-iron payments. This request was readily granted.
