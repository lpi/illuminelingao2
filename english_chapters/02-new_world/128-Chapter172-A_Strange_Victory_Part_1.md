# Chapter 172: A Strange Victory (Part 1)

Ma Qianzhu immediately switched to the public channel, broadcasting a combat alert to everyone—whether they were working, arguing, or slacking off. All personnel were to return immediately. The Security Group would distribute guns and ammunition. Xi Yazhou, currently supervising military training, was to dismiss formations immediately. All New Army personnel would regroup by combat organization and draw weapons.

Except for key electricity and communications staff, all able-bodied male transmigrators formed combat groups by dormitory. The Security Group instantly expanded from twenty to four hundred personnel, occupying pre-planned defensive positions. Bunker crews were doubled. A platoon was dispatched to protect the river power station and water source. Xi Yazhou took the Bairren Fortress wall command post for tactical direction.

Ma Qianzhu had Shaozhong connect to Bopu's channel. Though Bopu had the Navy fleet and newly built gun emplacements, it only had one company. If the enemy launched a combined land-sea attack, Bairren could not provide timely reinforcement.

"This is Ming Qiu speaking." The Navy advisor answered.

"This is Ma Qianzhu. Where's Chen Haiyang?"

"Report, Chief of Staff! Commander Chen went on fishing patrol."

*Still on fishing patrol.* Ma Qianzhu's forehead dripped sweat. "Notify him immediately. The enemy is attacking overland. Bopu goes on alert."

"Understood."

Ma Qianzhu then called Dugu Qiuhun, ordering the immediate evacuation of the East Gate Market's crowds and stalls. He ordered the Commerce Bureau staff armed with shotguns. The police station's melee weapon team would patrol the market; any internal collaborators or looters would be executed on the spot.

Steadying himself, he calmed down. Actually, Bairren Fortress had over three hundred modern rifles, more than three hundred New Army troops, and a dozen smoothbore cannons at its disposal. Defending from walls and gun towers, they need not fear a few hundred artillery-less enemies. Plus, they had one to two hours to prepare. He then remembered that all current battle plans aimed at total annihilation and capturing prisoners; passive defense simply would not do. He realized he had spooked himself earlier. *Calm, stay calm.*

Ma Qianzhu switched channels, calling the garage center. He had them fuel up the farm vehicles, assign four Security Group teams with shotguns and melee weapons, and position the vehicles outside the East Gate. The northeast was flat riverbank terrain. Without cavalry, they would have to rely on vehicles for a counterattack. Later, after Wu Nanhai's insistence, he dispatched a Security Group squad to help defend the farm's fields.

Then Ma Qianzhu noticed a problem. Bei Wei's Recon Team should have had a three-man group under Ye Mengyan providing distant early warning to the northeast. Why no alert? Had they been lost? But there was no time to investigate that now. He only felt grateful the enemy had no cavalry.

With everything arranged, Wu Nanhai had to prepare food, delivering meals to the walls. Those with shooting experience could not come down to eat. The Medical Team was on standby for casualties. Wu De assembled the Commune militia with melee weapons as reserves. Laborers were organized to carry stretchers and ammunition.

Finally, he notified Bei Wei's Recon Team to station snipers with sniper rifles, radios, and motorcycles along the approach roads for ambush, ready to assassinate the enemy leadership.

With everything in place, the enemy column finally appeared on the horizon. Xi Yazhou estimated no more than four hundred men. What could they hope to accomplish? Zhu Cailao's captured men had spent days in captivity, seeing plenty of the transmigrators' capabilities. They clearly knew the transmigrators had thousands of workers plus excellent firearms. Even for revenge, would he not need two or three thousand men rather than gift-wrapping himself like this?

Growing more puzzled, he urgently called Ma Qianzhu at the Communications Center: he suspected the enemy had multiple columns; this was likely just a feint.

"Hmm, very possible. Let me discuss it with Old He." Ma Qianzhu was now out of ideas. Never having been a soldier, he was somewhat panicked.

"No problem." He Ming studied the map. "The Security Group has sufficient firepower to control the key points. The enemy can't break through quickly. Let Commander Xi eliminate this column first. We have an absolute mobility advantage."

"Good. Concentrate artillery with the Training Battalion too."

The enemy drew nearer, maintaining their heading, basically aiming toward the East Gate Market. Seven or eight cavalry spread loosely ahead, apparently acting as scouts. Behind them were four columns of infantry. The front column of about a hundred men maintained some formation, with banners bearing what appeared to be the surname "Zhu." The next two columns were chaotic. Through binoculars, he saw dark-skinned, rough-handed commoners carrying assorted cleavers and pointed weapons of varying lengths. Some held crude rattan shields; others carried sharpened bamboo poles. Were they actually coming to fight? Xi Yazhou grew more suspicious. The rear column had fifty or sixty men, all with steel sabers, marching in an orderly fashion—looking rather like a supervision squad.

Xi Yazhou could nearly confirm they would directly attack the East Gate Market, which was understandable. To outsiders, this commercial center was the main concentration of wealth. "Everything under control"—the transmigrator group would soon have several hundred more prisoners. Just then, the enemy halted at one kilometer out, seemingly deliberating. Ma Qianzhu suggested taking the opportunity to eat. Once fighting started, it would not end for hours; post-victory cleanup would keep them busy. Feed everyone hot food first.

The cafeteria sent stainless steel lunch boxes to the Security Group. Xi Yazhou's Training Battalion had no boxes; pre-battle conditions were not suitable for distributing food from large pots. Wu Nanhai improvised using local bamboo to make bamboo rice. Besides rice and salt, he added extra lard to each tube so soldiers would be full and ready for combat.

After eating, the enemy was still stalling. Binoculars showed people running back and forth through their columns. Some sat eating dried rations. Others clustered talking. They looked less like an attacking force than a group on a spring outing.

"What the hell is this conspiracy?" Xi Yazhou muttered. He commanded: "Fall in!"

Then something utterly baffling occurred. Before the company commanders could relay orders, the pirates a kilometer away suddenly launched a chaotic, disorganized charge. No front or rear formations remained. A mob waving swords and clubs simply rushed forward. A grayish-brown mass surged ahead, almost rolling toward them.

"What the hell? A banzai charge?" Xi Yazhou quickly commanded, "Prepare for combat!"

Company commanders hastily organized their troops. Just then, Saiga-308 rifle fire came from the battlefield—the sniper team engaging. Ma Qianzhu on the wall stamped his feet. This chaotic mess—who were the leaders?

The sniper team knew clearly: mounted men outranked infantry. After the gunfire, every horseman was down. But the pirates behind kept charging chaotically.

*Wrong.* Observing, Ma Qianzhu felt something was off. Who fought like this? Even without firing a shot, infantry sprinting one kilometer would arrive gasping, unable to fight. Zhu Cailao had been raiding Fujian and Guangdong for a decade; he would not make such an elementary mistake.

He urgently called all positions: any suspicious activity?

Unanimous replies came back: "No suspicious phenomena." "All normal." "No suspicious vessels at sea."

Ma Qianzhu could not understand Zhu Cailao's thinking. Was he sending these hundreds to die?

The sniper rifles kept firing. Pirates fell continuously, but this did not make them flee. The three Saiga-308s had limited stopping power. Besides, these snipers were not skilled enough for guaranteed kills.

Suddenly the pirates veered east toward the hill where the snipers were positioned. Everyone was shocked—how had they been discovered? There were only six men there, with limited ammunition. Their mission was eliminating leaders, not engaging the main force. As the enemies rushed to the hill's base, Ma Qianzhu ordered their retreat.

Roaring motorcycles startled the enemy. The pirates did not pursue but stopped at the hillside. A dozen climbed up, looking around. Then they started felling trees and piling stones. Planning to entrench? They had brought a few days' dried rations at most, with no supply wagons...

"Artillery, destroy their camp. Force a decisive battle," Xi Yazhou ordered. Obviously these pirates aimed to "stall."

The artillery battery sprang into action. Before the infantry line, twelve mountain howitzers were arrayed, with rattan gabions filled with earth for protection.

"Distance three hundred eighty meters!" The range finder rapidly reported the hill's distance.

"Target three hundred eighty meters! Solid shot, load one round!" Ying Yu commanded. He had only two shell types: solid and canister. Canister was useless at this range. Reliable iron balls would do. Actually, pirates massing around the hill benefited the bombardment. Had they dispersed across harvested paddies, cannonballs hitting wet soil would have lost their bouncing effect.

"Fire!" Ying Yu commanded.

Twelve mountain howitzers simultaneously belched smoke and flame. Even Baitu expedition veterans felt the earth shake. Black iron balls flew four hundred meters, plunging into the crowd like iron plows. Flesh and limbs flew along the balls' trajectories. The semi-hardened hilltop ground caused impact-bounced balls to leap again, claiming more heads, legs, and torsos.

The earth trembled. Pirates scattered wildly. The second volley whistled in like Death itself, blossoming into flesh-and-blood flowers amid the grayish-brown mass. Dying screams and terrified wails filled the sky. Pirates fled in all directions. The mountain howitzers kept roaring. Cannonballs bounced across early winter's hardened ground, rapidly reaping lives.

The battle ended just like that—without technique or tactics. After leaving the ground covered with corpses, the pirates fled east in panic. Xi Yazhou ordered the 1st and 2nd Companies to pursue; the 3rd Company held position.

The battlefield became a duck hunt—one side chasing across hills, the other fleeing desperately. The Training Battalion was rested and fed; the pirates were already exhausted from their earlier antics. In the footrace, they were outmatched. Soon they collapsed, gasping. Fortunately, Xi Yazhou had ordered capturing prisoners for rewards, so the soldiers did not bayonet everyone.

Only twenty-odd fast runners nearly reached the eastern mountains. Let them go; they would not miss a dozen laborers.

Then, from the western woods, three rifle-wielding men appeared, blocking the road. A gallant volley dropped the fastest runners. The rest, already shell-shocked, saw blocking forces ahead. Regardless of the numbers against them, they all dropped to their knees, surrendering and crying "Mercy!" It was the Ye Mengyan team responsible for eastern screening, who had gotten lost during patrol. Returning, they happened upon fleeing enemies. This mistake perfectly concluded the battle. Transmigrator casualties: zero. Enemy dead or captured: all.
