# Chapter 135: Quarantine Station (Part 2)

Supervising the women's Purification was Qian Shuiting's wife Ai Beibei, from the North American contingent. In America she had been an epidemiologist—temperamentally unsuited for this kind of "Purification" work. She had been called to supervise simply because she was the Medical Group's only female doctor. Seeing the heaven-shaking wailing before her, this ordinarily domestic woman was immediately flustered, anxiously soothing: "Don't be scared, don't be scared. It's just haircuts—for hygiene reasons—"

But the women completely ignored her. Crying was contagious. Wails filled the sky above the quarantine station. The temporary workers naturally showed no tenderness, continuing their head-shaving. Ai Beibei stamped her feet frantically, repeatedly admonishing the rough-handling female workers: "Be gentler! Don't frighten them!"

The female temporary workers had no such scruples. Payment was half a *liang* of rice per shave—everyone was rushing to earn more. Under such rapid, efficient action, all fifty-three women young and old were quickly shaved smooth, revealing bluish scalps. The workers then hurried to the men's side to continue their money-making.

Apparently realizing that wailing was useless—or perhaps simply exhausted—the sounds gradually subsided. Someone opened the stocks, driving them onward to the bathhouses.

The quarantine station bathhouse had required considerable creativity from Engineering. The pressurized supply still used water towers. Water came from filtered settling pools beside the Wenlan River—simple sand-and-stone filtering. Bamboo pipes; the simplest lever-style faucets. The lack of proper seals meant constant leakage—this was solved by installing separate gate valves on the tower, closing them when no one was bathing to prevent wasteful seepage.

The bathrooms were divided into male and female sections, with a wooden wall partition between. Each side had twenty shower stations. There were no showerheads—water simply poured directly from bamboo pipes. The flooring was wooden planks; there were drainage ditches on the sides. Naturally, this wastewater did not go to treatment plants—it was discharged straight to sea.

Guo Sanniang followed the crowd into this large, long building. It was damp and humid inside. Bamboo pipes of various sizes crisscrossed overhead. The female manager—this beautiful, authoritative woman must be a favored housekeeper—gestured at them, speaking unintelligibly. Then a maid beside her announced in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Minnan dialects: remove clothes and prepare to bathe!

The women began shrieking again. Bathing was normal enough for southerners—but stripping naked together was utterly unprecedented. Some of the better-bred girls even crouched down, covering their faces, absolutely refusing to undress.

The bathroom chaos again brought work to a halt. Ai Beibei was helpless—having exhausted every possible explanation and comfort—and discovering that nobody listened, or even understood. Chuyu—the Gou Manor maid who had defected to the transmigrators—saw this female short-hair at her wit's end. She stepped forward and asked with humble courtesy: "Madam, may this servant handle it?"

Ai Beibei wiped her forehead. "Hmm? Sure, go ahead." Then she added: "By the way—I've told you many times—don't call yourself 'servant.' Here, everyone is equal—"

"Yes." Chuyu acknowledged, knowing this female short-hair was spouting her equality nonsense again. She neither understood nor wanted to understand. Her thinking was simple: exert her abilities before the short-hair masters to eventually secure a position like production team leader. Since arriving at the team, she had diligently studied Mandarin—advancement required speaking the masters' language.

Chuyu took an iron megaphone and bellowed with full-body strength:

"SILENCE!"

Chuyu's roar nearly shook the walls. Even Ai Beibei's ears were left ringing. Nobody had imagined this slender girl could produce such a piercing sound. Instantly, everyone stopped—mouths shut.

She turned to face Ai Beibei, seeing this female short-hair also struck dumb. She realized: her actions had caused this.

"Clothes—all—off!" Chuyu continued bellowing. "Those who don't—dragged out for household punishment!" Her whip cracked through the air for emphasis.

Ai Beibei disliked the prison-style performance but knew that sometimes crude simplicity was more effective than patient persuasion. She nodded and slipped outside.

Guo Sanniang followed the others, quickly stripping. There was no more room for embarrassment—everyone covering chests and privates, trembling, heads lowered, not daring to view each other's pale bodies.

Suddenly the overhead horizontal bamboo pipes began spraying water, raining down on them, carrying unpleasant smells. Scattered startled cries arose—but under Chuyu's fierce gaze, they quickly subsided. Female temporary workers brought a basket of soap pods. Working in pairs, they began the fast-processing: rinsing, soap-pod scrubbing, then merciless large-bristle brush scrubbing. Nobody dared protest. Quiet sobbing rose and fell throughout the room.

Guo Sanniang was scrubbed from head to toe. Her skin hurt as if being stripped off. She cried while bathing—for a moment thinking her skin really was being scrubbed away. But those falling flakes were actually years of accumulated grime. After being deemed clean, a worker led her to another room. The manager woman there wore a white gown—strange, had someone in the household died?

"Drink water." The manager woman's attitude was gentle, handing over a porcelain bowl. Guo Sanniang obediently drank—it was sweet, but with bitter undertones. Then she lay on a white-cloth-covered couch, her entire body examined by the manager woman—even her private parts and rear—Guo Sanniang felt both shamed and terrified, completely confused. She surrendered herself to the handling.

The manager woman examined her and told a nearby worker: "XS!" Then from a shelf she retrieved a cotton cloth outfit. Unexpectedly, new clothes—unlike wealthy households that typically gave new servants old clothes. It was indigo-colored; coarse-textured but clean and soft. The style was peculiar—like a monk's bell-robe. It slipped on easily; head and limbs protruding. Slightly oversized; the waist belt could be tightened. For footwear: wooden clogs.

Once dressed, the manager woman gave her a small rattan box, then examined the bamboo tag at her neck against a clipboard.

"Number 1628020014. Personal item: one broken-toothed comb." She announced loudly. A worker retrieved a steamer basket with a matching bamboo tag—inside was her comb, still damp.

When men and women reconvened behind the bathhouse, Tian Sanwu struggled to identify Guo Sanniang—all those identical bald heads in blue uniforms. Without careful scrutiny, even gender was indistinguishable. Some secretly laughed—truly comical.

"Maybe the master is a monk?" Someone muttered. They lined up before several wooden buildings.

"What's your name? Liu Sanba?" The questioner appeared scholarly, though he wore short-hair button-front shirts. Tian Sanwu noticed his hair was stubble-short—clearly he had received the same treatment. Why did the masters enjoy shaving servants bald? Tian Sanwu could not understand.

"How many Lius is this?"

"Chief—this is the fourth."

"Change it to Liu Si!"

"Understand? You're Liu Si now!"

"Thank you, Master, for the name—" This somewhat clever person tried kowtowing for a tip but was already being dragged aside.

"Your name—Tian Sanwu?" The questioner Zhang Xingjiao checked the list. "Chief—no Tians yet. Call him Tian Da?"

"No creativity. Tian Liang is better."

"Remember—you're Tian Liang now!" Zhang Xingjiao registered the name.

The newly minted Tian Liang was bewildered, but masters renaming servants was natural. Better than "Sanwu" anyway.

The registered people stood by tables. Tian Liang craned his neck toward the women's side, finally locating Guo Sanniang in the crowd. Seeing that nobody forbade talking, he quietly approached: "Sanniang, are you okay?"

Guo Sanniang, seeing this companion of over a year now bald too, imagined her own appearance. Mixed emotions welled up. She wanted to cover her bare scalp—but had nothing to cover it with. Red-faced, she nodded quietly: "I'm okay. Just the hair—the hair—"

"Under others' eaves, heads must bow. Even life belongs to others—what's some hair?"

"Did the masters rename you too?"

Guo Sanniang nodded: "They changed it. First, some short-hair insisted on calling me Guo Jinjin—but someone else refused. Now it's Guo Fu."
