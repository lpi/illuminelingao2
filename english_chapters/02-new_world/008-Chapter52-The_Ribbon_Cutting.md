# Chapter 52: The Ribbon-Cutting

The roof remained an unsolved problem. There were no tiles, no planks, and when he'd requested tarpaulin, the Planning Committee had rejected it outright. So it was back to waste utilization: a lattice of woven branches covered with fresh greenery, crowning the building in what could only be described as pure natural style. The effect was rather like something from a domestic eco-park—an all-natural-materials latrine with essentially zero resistance to wind or rain. Fortunately, after the Mid-Autumn Festival, Lingao entered its dry season. Little rain, no typhoons. It would suffice for now. The final touch was painting large "MEN" and "WOMEN" signs on the doors.

The Building Group circled their newly completed latrine several times, genuinely moved. Crude in structure, humble in purpose—in the twenty-first century, even beggars might have passed it by without a second glance—but it was the first building the transmigrators had created with their own hands. A milestone achievement. If a floating drum dock warranted a monument, then surely this building deserved even greater recognition. At minimum, a stone marker reading "Historic Site of Crossing Landing Base Latrine" seemed appropriate. While they hotly debated the inscription, Mei Wan proposed that such a public-welfare building theoretically deserved a Committee member to cut the ribbon and formally declare it open. Tian Jiujiu enthusiastically supported this—after all, the latrine was his work. So Mei Wan called the Committee, requesting a completion ceremony on grounds that it concerned livelihoods and the fundamental interests of the crossing masses. "You figure out the details," he added.

After making the call from the beach telephone station, Mei Wan had a thought: if there was to be a ceremony, the latrine shouldn't reek to high heaven—that would hardly suit leadership and media. On grounds of "holding a major public event," he requested two militiamen from Acting Military Group Leader He Ming for guard duty, specifying they needn't be elite soldiers, just regular militia. He Ming was an old soldier. The moment he heard about a major public event with Committee leadership attending, he immediately assigned two young recruits to the Building Engineering Group. Thus Ye Mengyan and Wei Aiwen—neither actual military, but among the most enthusiastic young trainees—received his order:

"Present yourselves properly—rifles with bayonets fixed! Double-time to Red Beach Building Engineering Group and report for special guard duty!"

The command thrilled both young men, who'd spent tedious hours standing guard with nothing to show for it. They quickly washed up and reported.

Mei Wan was delighted to see these energetic youths arrive with SKS rifles and gleaming bayonets. He posted them at the latrine entrance with strict orders: no one was allowed in to use it. "Without Committee orders, no one enters!" he emphasized. "This is an important mission—execute it conscientiously!"

Ye Mengyan and Wei Aiwen exchanged confused looks. Guarding a latrine—what kind of important mission was this?

"Important mission my ass," Wei Aiwen muttered, somewhat indignant. "A latrine you can't use—why even build it?" Before crossing, he'd played cards and hung out with several Committee members, assuming he'd land some minor position afterward. Instead, his first assignment was guard duty alongside a pimply-faced teenager—and now latrine guard on top of that.

"There's a ribbon-cutting ceremony soon. Can't have the place reeking, can we?"

"What the—a latrine that doesn't reek? Does it smell like flowers instead?" Wei Aiwen propped his rifle against the wall. "Does the Committee even control when people piss and shit now? I'm going in first."

Ye Mengyan wore an impatient expression, already thoroughly annoyed with both of them. "What's all the fuss? Just do it already. Guard duty here, guard duty there—what's the difference?"

"This young comrade has insight," Mei Wan praised. He also promised they could come to the Engineering tent that night to watch some "good-boy movies"—only then was the matter settled.

While they wrangled over the guard posting at the latrine, on the ship's poop deck the Committee was dodging responsibility for who would attend. Everyone enjoyed showing their face—but showing it at a latrine opening felt awkwardly indescribable. Yet refusing to go seemed dismissive of the masses' interests. Finally, Xiao Zishan—who nominally oversaw internal affairs and livelihoods—couldn't refuse and went.

A crowd had already gathered at the latrine entrance. Clearly, this practical project had won popular support. Xiao Zishan had just smiled and waved when a chorus of curses drowned him out.

"Fuck off! Acting all fancy—building a latrine and not letting people use it!"

"This is too damn bureaucratic! We can't piss until the big shots come?"

"I need to shit..." someone moaned in agony.

Xiao Zishan's expression soured. Two guards with SKS rifles and gleaming bayonets stood at the latrine door—what kind of show was this?

"Commissioner Xiao, look this way!" Ding Ding called out, perched in the raised bucket of an excavator that had been specially brought over, DV camera in hand as he continued his ongoing coverage. Clearly, this ribbon-cutting was right up his alley. He'd rushed over the moment he heard. In his view, the guards and the vine-ribbon added a nice touch but were too plain—lacking liveliness, especially ribbon-presenting beauties. Ten minutes later, Li Xiaolu, returning from surveying, found herself inexplicably squeezed into an ill-fitting cheongsam alongside Pauline—the full name of Ding Ding's foreign girlfriend—serving as ceremony hostesses.

The moment the curvaceous Pauline appeared in a tightly wrapped, high-slit cheongsam, the crowd's focus shifted entirely. Those who needed to relieve themselves rushed off to do so, then hurried back to reclaim their spots. If the Engineering Group hadn't intervened, someone would have climbed onto the latrine roof.

In Ding Ding's grand plan, Pauline served as both hostess and reporter. According to his vision, all this footage would be collected to news-documentary standards as important historical material for future generations.

Pauline spoke excellent Chinese, almost without the tonal-flattening common to foreigners, and people were willing to cooperate when she held the recorder. Ding Ding himself operated the DV, first shooting several crowd interviews. People expressed that this project had greatly facilitated their toilet needs and improved base sanitation. In his interview, Shao Zong from the Logging Group said emotionally: "Before, we had no latrines—we could only squat precariously on swaying decks. Dangerous and polluting. Now the Committee thinks what the masses think, worries what they worry, promptly building this project that warms the people's hearts. We crossing masses see it in our eyes, feel it in our hearts. On behalf of everyone, I thank the Committee and the Engineering Group comrades!"

Next, the recorder turned to Ye Mengyan at the entrance, asking his thoughts. Young Ye stared at the snowy cleavage visible in the cheongsam's open collar, head spinning, and babbled incoherently. Ding Ding figured he'd have to dub this segment later. Besides his girlfriend, he couldn't get anyone else assigned, and there was no one to hold cue cards. At this rate, interview quality wouldn't improve. He'd have to talk to the Committee about getting proper staff.

Finally, the ribbon-cutting concluded harmoniously—though there was some trouble actually cutting the vine. The thing was remarkably tough; Xiao Zishan struggled for quite a while to get through it.

Before leaving, the sweating Xiao Zishan suddenly remembered something. He instructed the Engineering Group to erect a large bulletin board at the latrine entrance for posting notices. Walkie-talkies might run out of power, but people would always come to the latrine.

Near the beacon tower, in a clearing among sparse woods, the camp medical station had been established. The Medical Department held high priority; the clinic was built almost immediately after Landing Command set up shop. As soon as wired power came ashore, an independent power line was run here—though for now they had no need for electricity.

Several large canvas tents formed the outpatient department. Serious cases would still be sent back to the *Fengcheng* for now, where conditions were far better. Looking out the tent windows, the trees deliberately left standing and the nearby stream made for a beautiful scene—good for patient morale.

At the outpatient entrance, a bamboo pole had been erected. Health Group Chief Shi Niaoren raised a Red Cross flag.

The rest of the Health Group personnel were inventorying the daily supplies they'd received: mainly surgical instruments for orthopedic and general surgery, dressings, glucose solution, saline, and some common medications.

While inventorying, the clinic received four heatstroke cases, five diarrhea cases, and two upper respiratory infections. One patient was a lazy fellow who'd slept overnight in a lifeboat without a sleeping bag—now running a fever. Hema squatted nearby, taking his temperature.

"39.4°C—that's fierce." Hema checked the thermometer. "Take him to the ship's infirmary."

"Upper respiratory?" Zhang Ziyi was filling out medical charts. She was the wife of Dr. Yang Baogui. Though her husband also belonged to the Health Department, he didn't work here—he was a veterinarian, currently busy tending the animals in the deck livestock containers, including five dogs he'd brought himself.

"Just this one, luckily. The weather helped." Hema packed his medical kit. "What worries me are the post-landing issues. I discussed this with Dr. Shi last night—he's an infectious-disease specialist. Hainan has quite a few infectious diseases. Malaria and cholera are common, and then there are parasites..."

The Health Group held a brief meeting to discuss future priorities. Afterward, Shi Niaoren drafted his "Disease Prevention Recommendations" for the Committee:

1. Urgently identify traditional Chinese medicine talent (including potentially useful locals) to maintain transmigrators' health while conserving modern medications.

2. Modern drugs must be strictly conserved. Antibiotics should be reserved for post-surgical patients.

3. Establish health monitoring for the population; at the first sign of infectious disease, immediately quarantine.

4. Travelers must not casually eat wild game or fruit; such items must first go to the clinic for inspection.

5. Ensure water purification.

6. Survey local health conditions and gather firsthand statistics.

7. Establish enforceable Health Department regulations.

8. Strengthen camp sanitation management; all household waste must be buried deep.
