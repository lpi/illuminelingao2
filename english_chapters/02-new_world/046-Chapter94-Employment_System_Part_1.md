# Chapter 94: Employment System (Part 1)

Because Ye Yuming had raised rabbits and poultry before, Wu Nanhai assigned him to manage the small animals. With rabbit numbers still low, there was no special housing—just a three-level rabbit hutch in the yard. But when tending the rabbits, he found them listless and not eating much. Were they sick? In the specialized agricultural library, he found this passage: *"Domestic rabbits have weak disease resistance. In damp, unclean environments, they easily contract diseases causing great losses—especially young rabbits. Thus follow dry, clean management principles for housing; implement sanitation and epidemic prevention. Also, rabbits tolerate cold but not heat. When temperatures exceed 30°C, adults reduce or stop eating; does easily miscarry, reduce milk, or refuse nursing—also inducing disease outbreaks. During hot periods, watch heat prevention and cooling."*

*Damp? Hot? Rabbits? Why did we bring rabbits to Hainan?!* And there was even an Angora pair! There was no choice but to find a shaded, ventilated spot. He moved the cages into an empty room, periodically sprinkling water around to cool them. As for rabbit feed, Wu Nanhai took no responsibility—fortunately, he had plenty of experience cutting fodder. After the vegetable harvest, cafeteria scraps could feed the rabbits too. When Wu Nanhai's sweet potatoes matured, he could collect large quantities of sweet-potato vines for rabbit feed. Although these creatures looked listless now, once they recovered, their reproduction rate would be astonishing.

The first few days were spent on basic land-clearing. Engineering bulldozers removed stones, roots, and weeds, trucking in large quantities of excavation waste to deepen the topsoil. Such land was still too raw and was suitable only for sweet potatoes. For hybrid rice, to be safe, he would wait until next spring; he needed to see how low the winter temperatures dropped. Wu Nanhai also planned to plant winter wheat and barley, since barley liked cool climates, tolerated some cold, and matured quickly, fitting between the main crop plantings.

The farm work was extremely hard—leveling land, digging channels, plowing, and applying base fertilizer. Although machinery helped, the manual labor required was still substantial. Applications to the Agriculture Group were surprisingly numerous, as many envisioned an idyllic pastoral life. Shortly after farming began, however, some complained of exhaustion or claimed a skill mismatch, transferring to other groups. Wu Nanhai himself found it overwhelming—it was better to be an agricultural advisor giving guidance while farmers did the actual work. The farmers Wu De sent really worked hard.

After over a month of adjustment, Wu De's labor team had become very efficient. He used five mutually antagonistic people as captains, deliberately encouraging competition among them. Such personal grudges between leaders worked better than any intimidation—each captain strenuously drove their subordinates, fearing falling behind their rivals.

Wu De opportunely introduced material incentives: each day, the first team to complete their labor quotas would receive extra food. He also implemented "last-place elimination"—every seven days, the lowest-completing team lost four members to the top four teams. If a captain lost all his members, he became ordinary labor, losing all benefits.

Wu De's measure tested the captains' management skills. It intensified competition; captains relying solely on violence—beatings and starvation—could only achieve short-term results. Oppressed workers also saw countermeasures—just slack off for four consecutive weeks, and the lofty captain would fall. Both sides had to balance for effective cooperation.

Clearly, Fu Youdi adapted extremely poorly. As the earliest prisoner captain, he had immediately lorded over others—not working himself and only grabbing benefits. When four former subordinates became captains, he felt extremely unbalanced. To maintain "senior captain" face before Wu De, he increasingly oppressed his subordinates, even cultivating two or three enforcers by skimming rations—establishing a tyrannical mini-kingdom. Hardly a day passed without beatings in his camp. The result was growing hatred within his team, yet he remained oblivious.

Wang Tian was more honest. Though he also grabbed extra benefits, he did not oppress his subordinates; he worked hard himself. People liked him—but some then slacked off. At first, Wang Tian meekly avoided managing; only when quotas slipped did he panic and beat people. When quotas rose, he repeated the cycle.

The other two fell roughly between Fu Youdi and Wang Tian. By comparison, Lin Xing's performance impressed Wu De. He divided his subordinates into small groups, assigning divisions of labor based on daily work content. He led by example—eating, living, and laboring together. He never touched others' shares, and even shared his bonus food with his subordinates. But slackers received no mercy—truly "clear rewards and punishments." The whole team respected him—even former small landlords and rich peasants admired him. One landlord privately invited him to become his estate's labor foreman.

*Among the common people, there are indeed heroes,* Wu De thought. Unlike moderns who accessed all kinds of information everywhere—how had an illiterate poor tenant like Lin Xing learned this? Were some people born with leadership charisma?

Wu De also gradually improved the laborers' meals. Now they had one dry and one thin meal daily—admittedly, the dry rice was mixed with local grains—but for workers, it was quite good. Some captains still skimmed food; he deliberately pretended not to know. Thus ordinary workers grew more resentful toward captains, feeling pirates were more conscientious.

After over two continuous weeks, Fu Youdi's team was on the brink of collapse. After finishing last two weeks running—losing eight people—a furious Fu Youdi announced one day's food suspension as punishment. Workers who had long suffered under him finally snapped—swarming him with fists and kicks. Even his enforcers were not spared—beaten black and blue.

Other teams were stunned by this upheaval. Wu De had contingency plans—he had instructed camp guards in such situations: no need to enter and suppress, just control the perimeter and prevent escapes. He had planned to let them settle naturally before sorting things out—but unexpectedly, Lin Xing spontaneously led people in to quell the disturbance.

Fu Youdi's subordinates, seeing Wu De arrive, knelt before him, competing to denounce his various crimes: some he knew about; others greatly surprised him—fully teaching him that no one could play god. Fu Youdi had actually been secretly hoarding steel tools issued for work. Workers had long noticed the "Chiefs'" tools were far superior to the crude iron implements they had used before—light, durable, and staying sharp without frequent sharpening. Fu Youdi calculated that Lingao lacked iron products; iron tools were imported from the mainland, so these excellent tools should fetch good prices. Though tools were logged during issue, daily work made it impractical to check out and return daily—they were stored in a shed. Every few days, he secretly hid one. Under mass exposure, the bruised Fu Youdi led Wu De to his hiding spot in the grass by the river, surrendering over a dozen shovels, spades, and steel bars.

Seeing this pile, the transmigrators present were speechless. *Were we really smarter than "natives"?* Here and now, seeing a prisoner stealthily steal items right under their noses—no one dared claim so.

Who would have thought Fu Youdi—meek and inarticulate two months ago—would descend to this. Watching the workers' angry denunciations, Wu De was even more convinced: 17th-century human nature was no different from the 21st century.

But Fu Youdi's case exposed many unforeseen problems: no workers had reported Fu Youdi's issues, silently seething until finally exploding together—a Chinese-style resolution. Apparently, his prisoner-management policy also had shortcomings.

*I focused too much on internal contradictions,* Wu De thought, rubbing his forehead, troubled. *Only thinking about keeping them disunited, unable to resist together. Didn't expect the prison-boss I created would also tightly control subordinates. Even my planted "would-be-joiners" never informed on him due to fear. If Fu Youdi had been more than a petty miser—if he'd hidden tools for a sudden revolt—there might have been casualties.* Mutual restraint among people had completely failed to materialize.

Fundamentally, his starting point had been off, Wu De reflected. He was still using old experience. Though successful at personnel management and brainwashing, these methods only aimed at keeping people orderly, docile, obedient workers. Not enough for cultivating initiative. What they needed were local allies—the foundation on which the transmigrators' edifice would be built. Constant surveillance, control, and exploitation would never win these people's loyalty.
