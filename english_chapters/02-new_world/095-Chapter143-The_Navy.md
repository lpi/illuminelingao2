# Chapter 143: The Navy

The Navy Department, strictly speaking, wasn't yet an organization recognized by the Committee. Officially, it was listed as the Fisheries Production Group and Bopu Harbor District—falling under Agriculture and Civil Affairs respectively. On paper, one handled fishing and maritime transport while the other managed Bopu Camp affairs, including ship maintenance.

But after some former naval personnel and navy enthusiasts conducted private lobbying, these departments were trending toward merger. Though the Committee officially maintained a "no comment" stance, anyone with Committee positions knew that a merger was inevitable.

Unlike the land-grabbing, building-constructing departments, Navy people disdained brick-and-wood red buildings. They wanted a Baroque-style Naval Headquarters. Until that could be built, the *Fengcheng* became this unofficial Navy's office.

The *Fengcheng* had completed its historical mission since anchoring on D-Day. Until the transmigrators re-established a petroleum industry, it could only remain moored. The ship was carefully maintained, housing modern navigation equipment: radar, compass, marine chronometers—all crucially important for the transmigrators' future naval power. In worst-case scenarios, it could still serve as an escape route.

Usable furniture, equipment, materials, and tools were gradually offloaded for land use. Unused compartments were sealed and locked. Large ships were complex worlds unto themselves—with insufficient personnel, no blind spots could remain.

For the Navy Department, this ship's comfort and convenience were unmatched by anything on land. The generators, though restricted to basic needs, amply supplied office and living power. The ship's powerful radio could easily contact all vessels at sea. There were comfortable cabins, private bathrooms, and well-equipped kitchens. Unlike land dwellers eating salt fish, smoked fish, and dried fish daily, the ship had refrigerators. The galley served fresh fish—even sashimi was effortless. Ice production was continuous. Fruit shaved ice was trivial; the powdered milk they'd brought even made ice cream possible. Allegedly, the navy-favoring Wen Director frequently inspected the *Fengcheng*—praising the ice cream and sashimi endlessly.

The unofficial Navy's main task remained fishing. Bopu had originally had fishermen, but after the transmigrators occupied the area, they had fled. Yet this was Lingao's traditional fishing ground. Losing it meant near-bankruptcy for the fishermen. Finally, fishing bosses negotiated with the transmigrators, willing to pay tribute in fishing products for access. The transmigrators agreed: this reduced fishing boat usage, saving diesel and motor hours. An agreement was reached—catches in the Bopu vicinity would be split two-to-eight. For the fishermen's share, transmigrators had priority purchase at market prices. Payment could be goods, grain, merchandise, or silver. Meanwhile, the transmigrators' boats could still fish independently.

Soon, this fishing hegemony extended to all fishing boats in these waters. Compliant boats received red-triangle flags from Bopu as identification. For enforcement, the Navy dispatched one fishing boat daily to patrol the fishing zones—catching fish while supervising. The first purpose: ensuring no boats hid catches or transferred them at sea. The second: expelling unflagged boats.

"We've become fishing tyrants now." Chen Haiyang stood on *Fishing-1*'s deck, surveying the surrounding working boats, recalling childhood picture-books depicting cruel fishing tyrants. His young heart had developed extreme revulsion and hatred for such unjust systems—which had also kindled a vague admiration for the Liberation Army. Perhaps this was his original motivation for becoming a naval officer.

Now he was maintaining this very unjust system—moreover, he was one of its architects. The world was sometimes strange like that.

"So what if we're fishing tyrants? Catch yields keep climbing. Wu Nanhai has shut up! At this rate, Navy recognition is just a matter of time." Li Di stood excitedly beside him, showing no guilt whatsoever. This electronics engineer turned fatty had stubbornly wormed his way into the Navy Department, self-proclaiming himself "Naval Engineer" and hammering away mysteriously in a shed daily, showing nobody his work—though everyone knew what was inside: a small steam engine. A kit he'd bought from overseas. But this machine still hadn't operated properly since landing.

Chen Haiyang didn't continue this topic. Since D-Day, regardless of political orientation, pragmatism had come to dominate among the transmigrators. What benefited transmigrators was good—right and wrong depended largely on which side you sat.

In the distance, a large fishing boat was unfurling its sails and heading west. This was the *Deng Yingzhou*—on its third shipping run. Since its first trip to Guangzhou, this ship had barely stopped, bringing back massive quantities of materials the Industrial Department needed. *Fishing-1* protected it in the Bopu vicinity—beyond that, they were on their own. Chen Haiyang sighed: navies lacking materials, however modern, had limited effect.

"Attention! Three nautical miles ahead—three large fishing boats spotted—no flags!" the lookout Le Lin suddenly shouted. A Hong Konger and fanatical military enthusiast who especially loved the navy, he'd taken to wearing a civilian-version U.S. Navy uniform since joining.

"Hard starboard, heading one-two-zero. Ahead two, close in." Chen Haiyang issued his orders. *Fishing-1*, previously at slow ahead, turned its bow toward the boats.

Such inspections had occurred multiple times daily before. As unflagged boats had their catches confiscated, unflagged fishing had nearly disappeared. Three appearing at once made Chen Haiyang suspicious.

"Sound battle stations! Prepare for boarding inspection!"

As the ship's bells rang, thirty-plus crew rapidly took their positions, donning steel helmets and fire-retardant combat suits—this era's Chinese coastal warfare commonly used arson. Weapons were readied. *Fishing-1* had no heavy weapons like cannons. Its basic firepower came from SKS rifle volleys by the crew. Recently, improvements had been made: though the Industrial Department lacked metals, wood, bamboo, rattan, and hides were plentiful. Plus Lin Shenhe—who claimed to have played with every weapon except nukes—had joined them. Soon, working from references, they'd replicated several Ballistae.

The Ballista was ancient Rome's most successful large crossbow—the world's most famous mechanical crossbow. Strictly speaking, it wasn't a crossbow at all, since propulsion came not from a bow body but from twisted torsion springs on both sides. The Ballista's nickname was "Shield Piercer"—its giant bolts easily penetrated any known shield or armor. A qualified Ballista had a five hundred meter killing range; within two hundred meters it could penetrate two-inch uniform wooden boards. At its peak, Roman legions had fifty or more Ballistae each.

The transmigration Navy's mechanical crossbows structurally resembled ancient Roman Ballistae—though perhaps inferior. The best Roman Ballistae used extensive steel and bronze, unlike the stingy transmigrators. So the transmigration version was heavier. It was slightly advanced in one respect: it had a three hundred sixty degree rotating platform with a low protective parapet, providing shooters some basic protection.

*Fishing-1* mounted two such crossbows—on the fore and aft decks. The Navy's sea trials had shown that at five hundred meters, hitting anything was pure luck. At two hundred meters, accuracy improved significantly.

Fortunately, this era's Chinese coastal vessels weren't much better armed. As long as the transmigration Navy didn't foolishly try to dominate the seas with crossbows, they sufficed for coastal anti-piracy and intimidating merchant and fishing boats. After all, they had better ammunition than the Romans.

"Prepare Round Two!" the gunnery officer ordered.

"Round Two ready!" A large firecracker-like thing was loaded onto the Ballista.

Seeing *Fishing-1* approach, the three boats hurriedly turned their sails—apparently fleeing. The ship's loudspeaker played a pre-recorded message in multiple dialects and Mandarin, ordering them to drop sails immediately and accept inspection.

After the broadcast, the boats' sails did indeed drop. People began scurrying chaotically between decks and cabins.

"Prepare to board."

This was routine. The boarding teams donned life vests—each man with a pistol and machete—and lined up at the ship's rail to await orders.

"Board." On command, five team members leaped over the rail, landing on the opposite deck. Before they could steady themselves—cannon thunder erupted.
