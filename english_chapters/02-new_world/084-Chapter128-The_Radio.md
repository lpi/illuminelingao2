# Chapter 128: The Radio

Zhang Yuchen knew: outdoors somewhere, in some dark corner, in some back alley, or in some quiet courtyard room, someone sat before a radio—carefully turning dials, headphones on—a hunter cautiously stalking prey through the airwaves...

The fantasy stopped there, because the mental image of this radio hunter wore Flying Fish robes. Zhang Yuchen shook his head, dispelling the spy-movie fantasy. The Brocade Guards lacked direction-finding equipment. But right now, he was doing exactly what hunted radio operators did.

*Transmigration Political Security Bureau Personal Assessment of Transmigrator Zhang Yuchen (Top Secret):*
*"Born XXXX/XX/XX. Joined transmigration enterprise XXXX/XX. Han ethnicity. Political orientation: moderate socialist. Personality—gentle, approachable with friends, taciturn; merciless toward enemies. Upstanding character, no bad habits, clear social ties. Expertise: communications and cryptography. Evaluation—a rare professional expert—"*

Zhang Yuchen had previously worked in telecommunications. Due to his cryptography expertise, he had been transferred to Intelligence for this Guangzhou underground operation as the designated radio operator.

The new assignment had initially unsettled him—but imagining himself as a secret radio operator behind enemy lines, like in the novels and films, his blood boiled with anticipation. In his excitement, he had even compiled a cipher set before departure. When he solemnly presented the codebook to Shao Zong, the latter laughed ruefully:

"Who's this cipher for? In this timespace—besides us—who has radios?"

"Well—" Zhang Yuchen scratched his head. "It'll be useful someday."

This cipher set did indeed prove useful later on.

15:50 hours. In the empty radio room, Zhang Yuchen rubbed his hands like someone warming by a fire on a cold night—half from nervousness, half from meticulous preparation.

The forward station's scheduled contact with the Bairren Fortress base station was at 16:00. Per Intelligence regulations, stations made daily contact to confirm safety. Three consecutive missed contacts would trigger the dispatch of a rescue team. Today would be his first transmission.

He set up the transmitter and connected the power. Power came from lead-acid battery banks, with a hand-crank generator available for charging. The antenna was strung on a courtyard tree.

The message lay before him—four-digit groups, plaintext. Besides confirming their safe arrival, it contained Xiao Zishan's work report—clearly the man had never written telegrams before. His rambling prose had made the message very long. Fortunately, without radio-detection vehicles to worry about, brevity was not a safety issue.

16:00 arrived. He nodded to Guo Yi and Xiao Zishan inside, then donned his headphones. Quickly tuning the dials, he immediately heard loud, clear calls from the base station: "GDA... GDA... GDA..." The calls traversed space repeatedly, filling him with confidence. Barring surprises, the operator on the other end was Li Chiqi's cousin Zhang Yu—the nineteen-year-old girl who had been tricked into coming here by her scheming cousin, who had told her "let's go somewhere fun." After fainting from blood exposure during nurse training—and vomiting as well—she had subsequently been conned by Shao Zong into becoming a radio operator.

Hearing those calls also meant the safety tether to Bairren Fortress was intact. He adjusted the frequency for the strongest signal. Fortunately, this timespace had no other radio waves—the sky was silent.

He began transmitting Guangzhou station's call sign: "GDA" several times—then leaned back, listening.

"BRL... BRL... BRL"—the Bairren base station responded. The signal was loud and clear against the clean background.

The base station was ready to receive. Zhang Yuchen glanced at the clock and pressed the key. Seconds later, he forgot himself—his mind and body concentrated entirely on his nimble fingers, on the key's staccato long-and-short clicks.

His form seemed extraordinarily good—faster than any practice session. At 16:22, after the final code group, he transmitted "GDA" to signal the end of the message. He leaned back, listening for the base station acknowledgment. At Bairren Fortress's "Lingao Telecom" building, the novice Zhang Yu was probably decoding group by group—confirming there were no missed or erroneous codes. Errors would require retransmission.

About fifteen minutes later, "BRL" sounded—reception confirmed successful. The transmigrators' first long-distance telegram transmission was complete.

"Right now, Ding Ding's probably dragging his Western mare along for live coverage of this historic moment." Xiao Zishan laughed. "'Dear viewers and listeners, perhaps you've just switched on the elevator—'"

"A Western mare—I want one too." Zhang Yuchen's inner otaku emerged.

"When are we going to Macau? Let's try some foreign flavor!" Several of them were getting restless.

"Forget it—women who don't bathe for ten years... Even if she's Audrey Hepburn's ancestor, I'm not interested."

"Little Guo, Salina seems pretty nice. I heard she's interested in you?" Xiao Zishan started gossiping.

Guo Yi suddenly blushed. "No such thing! We rarely interact." This was true—during his Security Group work, Salina had shown interest. But fearing misunderstandings, he had maintained strict distance.

"Why so shy? Getting a Western mare girlfriend isn't bad. Spreading China's divine might, sowing seeds across the four seas—" Xiao Zishan chuckled. Others chimed in with their own jokes. While they were talking, the radio suddenly started clicking. Zhang Yuchen quickly donned headphones, listened carefully, and began transcribing.

"What's the message?" Everyone tensed up. There had been no earlier reply—now this sudden transmission. Was it some important directive?

"Agricultural Department to Guangzhou Forward Station—" Zhang Yuchen transcribed while decoding: "Please procure in Guangzhou:

Live pigs: 100 head

Live chickens, ducks, geese: 100 each

Lard, tallow, or miscellaneous vegetable oils: 2,000 kg

Horses: 10

Donkeys: 10

..."

"Heavens—Wu Nanhai thinks this is a farmers' market!" Lu Rong exclaimed. "Donkeys? I've never even seen donkeys in Guangdong!"

"Horses aren't easy either," Zhang Xin said. "Maybe up north. In Guangzhou—probably only from the military."

Most puzzling of all was the two thousand kilograms of oil. What for? Before departure, the cafeteria food—though slightly improved from the early days—was famously oil-lacking. Fried foods never appeared. Stir-fries were rare. Only the big-pot soups had stingy drops of lard floating on top. Was Wu Nanhai in a rush to improve meals with fried foods?

"I'm guessing the oil isn't his request—probably for soap."

"Soap!" Zhang Xin's eyes lit up. "That's a transmigration money-making weapon! Every household needs soap."

"We can make different grades: various scented soaps and transparent soaps for the wealthy. Maybe add some aphrodisiac effects for the brothels—"

"What counts as an aphrodisiac?" Yan Maoda asked.

"Myrrh or something? Anyway, the Arabs do this kind of stuff."

"What's myrrh? The Arabian Peninsula is far away."

"Don't worry—what doesn't Guangzhou have?" Guo Yi was confident. "We haven't fully mapped out the local supplies yet."

Yan Maoda nodded. "First, we establish what Guangzhou can supply—then what we can sell to Guangzhou."

Trade goods had been discussed in various meetings. Per Industrial Department reports, near-term products included: salt, cigarettes, glassware, refined sugar, matches, soap, and iron products—mainly sewing needles. Someone had proposed liquor—but Ming-era distilled spirits were already widespread and would not generate premium profits.

"About liquor—I have an idea. But it needs Agricultural and Industrial cooperation." Zhang Hongda said.

Xiao Zishan nodded. "I'll coordinate with them when I get back to base."

"We've lost first-mover advantage on baijiu—but packaging can open new markets."

Zhang Xin already understood. "New bottles, old wine?!"

Yan Maoda nodded. "Exactly. We needn't even brew it ourselves—brewing requires grain. Bulk-purchase baijiu here in Guangzhou; ship glass bottles from Lingao; bottle locally. The value will instantly multiply."

"Excellent!" Xiao Zishan was energized by the idea.

"Thinking further—there are even more possibilities. Like dyeing the baijiu golden—like XO cognac?" Guo Yi spoke up.

Everyone stared at him. Guo Yi felt his scalp tingling. "What?"

Yan Maoda chuckled. "Sometimes outsiders make the craftiest swindlers."
