# Chapter 141: East Gate Market Police Station (Part 2)

Zhou Shizhai had worked at the Qiwei Escort Bureau for eleven years. Like his martial brothers, he hailed from Sun Kecheng's hometown—a man who knew his way around boxing and staff fighting, but had no desire to break his back tilling fields, so he'd found his way into the escort trade instead.

Life as an escort was far better than farming. But Zhou Shizhai's temperament had always made Sun Kecheng uneasy. He lacked the steady disposition the work demanded—or rather, he wasn't smooth enough in his dealings with the world.

Escort bureaus walked a fine line between the legitimate and the underworld. The profession required both integrity and flexibility in equal measure. Zhou Shizhai understood perfectly well that bureaus "ate their friends' food and wore their friends' clothes"—yet he despised those very "friends" and couldn't stomach their shamelessness. Disagreements led to fights. Before long, he was no longer assigned to long-distance escort runs. Guarding shops and residences became his specialty instead. But even this work had its rules: when encountering thieves, you escorted them out—never captured them. When disturbances arose, you used minimal force and stopped there. Bureaus weren't the government. Your job was to protect employers' property and safety; capturing criminals was yamen business. But Zhou Shizhai repeatedly broke these rules, making many underworld enemies in the process. Eventually he was transferred to manage the mule stables—a way of keeping him out of trouble.

Dull years passed. Then Bureau Chief Sun summoned him: those Australian sea merchants wanted to purchase estates in Qiongzhou and needed an escort to "lead" there.

"Leading" referred to a particular arrangement: wealthy households maintained house-guard forces for security. Typical guards were commoners who knew neither martial arts nor the ways of the underworld. Specialized hired escorts served as "leaders"—training the guards in martial arts and arranging night patrols. Within residences, this granted one guest-retainer status.

Leading was responsible work but well-paid, with no sleeping rough on the road. Within the bureau, it was considered choice work—but it required smooth, flexible people. Zhou Shizhai had led before, only to be replaced for catching thieves too enthusiastically and failing to get along with his employers. Now he was being sent again? Strange indeed—was the sun rising from the west?

Though puzzled, he reasoned that this was better than handling livestock. Besides, the bureau had recently received considerable business from these Australian merchants—they'd become a major patron. Previously tight finances had eased; compensation for dead brothers was now covered. Anyone else's work could be refused, but work for the Australians was mandatory.

He packed his things and brought two new disciples—sons and nephews of fallen escorts, per bureau rules. Their training quality was too poor for real escort work, which would have meant becoming servants or counter assistants. These two, only sixteen or seventeen years old, were too young for escorting proper, so they'd been assigned to continue their training under Zhou Shizhai. There was also Sun Kecheng's calculation: it saved the bureau some food expenses. Such youngsters had been accumulating.

Hiring escorts had been Ran Yao's idea. Despite their twenty-first century concepts and equipment, the transmigrators knew almost nothing about this timespace's underworld. Escorts made perfect candidates—compared to yamen runners, who were basically criminals themselves, escorts' professional ethics made them far more trustworthy.

Though Dugu Qiuhun was nominally station chief, actual operations fell under Mu Min's direction. At her request, with Industrial-Commercial Bureau cooperation, they conducted a "security census"—surveying East Gate's environment, daily traffic flow, and the operations of shops and vendors.

The investigation revealed that pickpocketing was the most common crime, followed by theft, then fraud and brawling. Robbery and murder were nearly absent—criminals apparently didn't dare openly attack under the transmigrators' eyes.

But that large-scale brawl with fatalities—what had that been about? Mu Min personally questioned many people, aided by local translators. Many stammered, their eyes shifting—a clear indication that something was being hidden. Though Dugu Qiuhun alertly suspected organized crime fighting over territory, Mu Min disagreed.

It wasn't that she thought the Ming era lacked organized crime—rather, it was the Medical Department's autopsy report from the incident. The evidence showed that all seven dead were heavy laborers who had recently been doing fieldwork. Moreover, from her experience, underworld fights occasionally killed people, but the basic premise was bleeding without killing—using machetes that looked bloody but had low mortality rates. These bamboo spears, thrust indiscriminately with brute force, resembled rural large-scale clan feuds more than gang warfare.

Indeed, days later, people arrived to collect the corpses. The story emerged: villagers from one village had come to the Welfare Society to shop. At noon, while drinking tea and eating at a tea stall run by villagers from another village, a minor dispute had escalated. Unfortunately, the nearby stalls all belonged to the second village's people or their associates. The first village's men suffered badly and fled in defeat. While seeking revenge and preparing for retaliation, both sides had armed themselves. The fighting had broken out from there.

"Such viciousness over such trivial matters? These people are too ignorant and backward!" Dongmen Chuiyu was shocked.

"Clan feuds aren't our business—we can't manage them." To Mu Min, this wasn't news. Rural feuding existed even in twenty-first century China. Behind such conflicts lay tangled economic, territorial, cultural, and resource disputes. Years of accumulated grievances made any small incident capable of triggering massive fights—especially now, during the agricultural off-season.

"We must ensure no one causes trouble at East Gate. This incident can't simply end here."

"People are dead—what more can be done?"

"Dead people—but the corpses remain. Have body collectors from both villages arrived?"

"They're all resting at the inn. Should I bring them in?"

"Don't meet them. Send word: five *liang* fine per corpse. Coffins we'll generously provide at cost price—one *liang* each. Payment within seven days. Overdue corpses get tossed in the sea."

"What?" Dongmen and Dugu stared wide-eyed. "But—didn't the Committee require treating natives well?"

"Good treatment has its limits. Let the surrounding people see the consequences of drawing weapons on our turf." Mu Min's tone was murderous.

Dugu Qiuhun slapped the table excitedly. "Should have been like this long ago! I've told the Committee—harsh laws and punishments are what keep the peace. If you ask me, future thieves should have their hands chopped off! See if anyone dares steal on my turf then! All this talk of 'good treatment, good treatment'—they're climbing right over our heads!"

"Hand chopping is too much." Mu Min turned to Ran Yao. "Team Leader Ran—what legal standards should we follow?"

"Just use the Public Security Management Punishment Regulations. It's ready-made." Ran Yao had already discussed these issues with the Committee. This actually involved legislation, and the transmigrators currently lacked time to draft their own laws—so they would naturally use existing regulations.

Ma Peng, returning from work that day, saw new notices posted on the camp bulletin board. Many coworkers had gathered around. Zhang Xingjiao stood nearby, reading aloud in singsong: "Recruiting police... ten persons... ages eighteen to twenty-five... height one hundred sixty centimeters or above, healthy... meals provided, wages of two-point-five work points daily, plus half a kilogram of rice, bonuses extra..."

Excited chatter erupted among the crowd. One laborer said, "Two-point-five work points! On my busiest day I only get one-point-five. Even group leaders only get two. And now you can get two-point-five just like that!"

"Didn't you hear? Only workers can apply. Workers already earn more than us!"

"Why? We do the same work—why do they get more?"

"Don't want it? Then transfer to worker status."

"You need twelve months' service for that. Or exceptional performance."

Ma Peng wasn't initially interested. He'd heard this was yamen-runner-type work, managing arrests and preventing theft. He feared death; he also thought it undignified. But now his mother lived with him. Though the short-hairs gave an extra one-point-five work points for "dependents," his mother received no free meals. Finances were tight. Camp rumors now said workers were getting raises—he regretted listening to Fu Buer and not transferring to worker status. Such opportunities were passing him by.

But the next day he went to the commune office to apply anyway. Though he wasn't a worker, Ran Yao noted his decent physique—finding men over one hundred sixty centimeters tall wasn't easy—and approved him. After questioning, he was called to a back room, stripped, measured with rulers, and weighed on a large scale. Finally, he was approved for the native police squad.

The first phase was ten days of combat training: the fastest joint locks, fighting with peculiar-shaped short clubs. Then came instruction on spotting suspicious persons, patrolling, questioning pedestrians, pursuit and capture, and rope-binding techniques. A short-hair named Li Jun taught shield and club formations for dealing with mobs, along with live sparring against laborers. The material was complex. Ma Peng was illiterate, which made learning harder. Fortunately, the transmigrators used demonstration teaching—hands-on instruction with models and pictures.
