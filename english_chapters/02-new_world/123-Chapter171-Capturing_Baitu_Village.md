# Chapter 171: Capturing Baitu Village

A scout rushed back to where Xi Yazhou sat on his horse. He was the only mounted officer, riding Nick's beloved "Alanche." This racehorse was indeed magnificent—every native stared at it admiringly. Hainan rarely had horses—let alone such tall, beautiful ones.

After entering the mountainous terrain, Xi Yazhou rarely rode—the steep, dense forests meant any ambush would target the only horseman first. Though he disliked walking, self-preservation took priority.

After more than two hours of gasping uphill, he already regretted promising Wu Nanhai a month's free labor to borrow this horse.

"Commander Xi—Baitu's checkpoint is ahead."

"Confirmed?" Xi Yazhou asked, wiping sweat from his forehead.

"Confirmed. We've already sent negotiators demanding they open up."

"Let them keep talking." Xi Yazhou waved his arm. "All platoons—rest in place! I need a break."

Xiong Buyu had been shouting through a megaphone for half an hour. The wooden stockade blocking the roadside remained silent. The road was blocked by a thick log barricade—the gate was firmly shut. There were no visible figures on the stockade walls, but weapons were glinting in the sunlight.

"Fire—let's try something impressive." Xi Yazhou lowered his binoculars. This wooden stockade could be taken in ten minutes if they really wanted to.

"Commander Xi—Bei Wei radioed. They've infiltrated behind the stockade—they're one hundred meters away at Hill 41.3. Should they attack?"

"Just monitor them. If we fight everything for the troops, these newbies won't get any practice."

"Understood."

"All platoons—prepare for combat! Fix bayonets!"

Following the officers' commands, the resting soldiers hurried to stand, forming up under the squad leaders' urgency.

Officers—with their orderlies' help—unpacked stab-resistant vests from their backpacks. They were too hot for marching but were donned now for combat. Rattan helmets were swapped for steel helmets.

"Fine—give them a taste of artillery," Ying Yu said resignedly.

The first shot blasted the wooden gate, sending splinters flying. Two shots hit the stockade—one blew off a wooden parapet, another punched clean through the wall.

The 12-pounder iron balls, trailing arcs of smoke, were a terrifying sight. The Training Battalion soldiers cheered their artillery's might.

Almost simultaneously, the stockade walls showed white smoke and the report of a cannon echoed. The cheering soldiers suddenly ducked—some dove face-first with hands over their heads, while others looked ready to flee. The formation wavered.

"Good heavens!" Xiong Buyu—though a non-officer—had full equipment and carried his beloved flute, planning a heroic *British Grenadiers* column assault. He didn't expect enemy cannon fire to throw the month-trained Training Battalion into such chaos.

"Stand fast! Stand fast! Don't panic!" Officers drew their swords to restore order.

"Recruits fear cannons"—that saying held true. Xi Yazhou cursed while watching his troops. "On returning: I must drill them endlessly under cannon fire," he mentally planned.

Old Tiger You pointed his sword skyward. "Any bastard looking back—I'll chop him down! Everyone stand firm! You worthless lot!" The back of his sword struck a soldier who was turning away.

The stockade's cannonball fell less than one hundred meters away. Ying Yu recognized it: nothing to fear. "They're using scrap iron and rocks as shot."

"Continue firing!"

Xi Yazhou didn't order an immediate assault. Solid iron rounds pounded the position relentlessly, and the logs collapsed like toppled blocks. The entire stockade became a pile of rubble—smoking and burning.

Soon, people rushed out waving weapons for melee—but the stabilized infantry's volleys denied them. After the first volley, a dozen or more lay fallen. The survivors screamed in terror, blood-spattered, and fled back.

Xi Yazhou ordered a bugle assault. This time, there was no embarrassment. Platoons correctly alternated cover and advance, quickly entering the checkpoint. The ground was littered with bodies crushed by cannon fire and timber. Soldiers mercilessly bayoneted the dying and wounded, their screams echoing. Xi Yazhou shook his head: these soldiers had weak fighting spirit but killed without hesitation. Good or bad?

Prisoners were tied ten-to-a-rope. Xiong Buyu hastily interrogated them—almost all were Fujianese refugees fleeing endless tax exactions to Hainan. Baitu had sheltered them—paying monthly rice and cash. They worked as laborers and militia.

The cannons and powder were bought from "red-hairs" who came for ship repairs. They also bought red-hair muskets—but because of poor usage causing injuries, they were abandoned.

"What damn times," Xiong Buyu finished questioning, indignant. "The Ming is done—even tiny villages are raising private armies."

"The Ming is done—but the Jurchen aren't much better." Xi Yazhou sighed. Though dynastic cycles seemed inevitable—the Ming-Qing transition was a rare historical regression. As the world approached the threshold of modern civilization, China became a brutal, backward slave state. People were impoverished and ignorant. Science was destroyed. Culture was castrated... The only thing remaining was Macartney's observation of a "barbarizing China" and its so-called "prosperous age."

Xi Yazhou wasn't a "Ming enthusiast"—but even the rotten Ming lacked the ugliness of the queue hairstyle. This alone—he couldn't let history repeat.

"Little Wei—take the 1st Company double-timing forward. Reach Baitu quickly—don't enter yet," Xi Yazhou briefed Wei Aiwen. "Seal all land exits—don't let them escape!"

"Understood!"

"Naval blockade—*Fubo* should have arrived. Once deployed—fire a red rocket to notify them."

Remaining soldiers cleared the battlefield—bodies were tossed into ravines, logs cleared from the road. Xi Yazhou noted the strategic terrain and ordered one platoon to guard the rear. Other units continued toward the village.

By 3:00 p.m., Baitu surrendered. The village was fortified: wooden palisades, rammed-earth walls, log-built gun towers. Remarkably, the four corners had bastions. It looked less like a Chinese village than a crude European fortress. Some attempted sea escape—but the *Fubo's* broadsides drove them back. With no escape and a 12-pounder mountain howitzer smashing one gun tower, the village surrendered. Ying Yu breathed a sigh of relief—his ammunition was nearly exhausted.

After detaining the surrendering elders, Xi Yazhou ordered forces to occupy the village. Walking around, he realized this was a small paradise. The houses were simple, but the villagers looked healthy and properly clothed. They showed normal fear—unlike the desperately poor villages where peasants had dead, fish-like eyes.

Village warehouses and workshops were sealed. Xi Yazhou inspected them—soldier discipline remained strict, thanks to transmigrator officers supervising.

The Navy fleet entered the harbor, offloading supplies and ammunition. Also arriving were the Planning Committee inventory staff and Wen Desi himself—as a shipbuilding expert. Baitu's greatest wealth was its shipyard. They needed to evaluate whether Baitu was viable for continued use—relocating meant abandoning existing infrastructure.

The shipyard was beachside near the bay. Ships were on the slipways—some incomplete, some under repair.

After the inspection, it was clear: Baitu's facilities were comprehensive—ironworks, hemp works, tung oil works, paint works, and even a small lime kiln. But the harbor was too small. With mountains on three sides and a water depth of over ten meters, the entire harbor could still only accommodate eight to ten hundred-ton vessels. The village's shipbuilding capacity matched—only one 400-*liao* ship was on the slipways; the rest were small fishing boats.

"Nice place." Wen Desi's eyes sparkled seeing such complete ancient shipbuilding facilities—forgetting his purpose.

"Too small. Fine as a storm harbor. Too small for a shipyard."

"It's a bit like 'chicken ribs'—scant meat, but a pity to throw away," Wen Desi reluctantly agreed. Harbor water was limited; land space was equally constrained. The current scale was clearly the maximum.

After deliberation, the decision was made: relocate the entire village. Move the women, children, and elderly first. Leave some shipwrights to complete the ships on the slipways. Everything movable—especially quality timber—would be transported. It was a scarce resource for transmigrator shipbuilding.

Xiong Buyu announced to the elders: all must relocate to Bopu. There, the transmigrators would help rebuild the shipyard, providing housing and private plots.

Xi Yazhou didn't give Xiong much time to promote the "New Village" advantages. He sat on a camp stool, brandishing a long saber and glaring menacingly.

"Enough talk. Return—tell the villagers: pack up, prepare for phased departure!" The bayonet-fixed soldiers behind him added persuasiveness.

No prolonged discussion and no political mobilization were needed. Bayonets and cannons were the hard truth. Villagers were ordered to pack and prepare for relocation. Anticipating an extended process, Li Jun and one platoon would garrison the village until completion.
