# Chapter 83: Interrogating Prisoners (Part 1)

Someone proposed a comprehensive interrogation and screening of the prisoners—extracting local conditions from them would be far more useful and faster than the Committee's Intelligence Group digging through books. So Ran Yao received a new assignment: interrogating prisoners.

Though some raised human-rights concerns for the prisoners, many others clearly had no interest in protecting native human rights but considerable interest in torture methods. Before Ran Yao had even figured out how to conduct interrogations, volunteers offered various torture devices and beating techniques.

"I'm interrogating prisoners, not filming *Manchu Torture*." Ran Yao smiled bitterly, repeatedly declining these enthusiastic proposals. But with so many prisoners and the Security Group having much other work, he could not handle everything himself. After thinking it over, he applied to the Committee to borrow two former colleagues holding temporary IDs.

Xiao Guo, who had planned to prove himself in battle, had been issued a rifle but—wrong location—had not fired a single shot. Stuck doing battlefield cleanup, he was frustrated when a transfer order reassigned him to the Security Group. He was thrilled: *finally back to old work!*

"Alright, Xiao Guo, starting today you're in charge of prisoner interrogation. Prepare the procedures and outline tonight." Ran Yao stretched. "Oh, we've also transferred Mu Min. You two—man and woman pairing—work won't be tiring, right?"

"Team Leader Ran, well, she has a husband. Pairing me with her for work, isn't it..." Xiao Guo delicately suggested the impropriety.

"You're pretty conservative. What, should I transfer the big American mare instead?" Ran Yao teased. "Salina's basically recovered, but they're not assigned yet. Hard to arrange." He took off his cap and smoothed his hair. "Oh, Wu De will also support your work. He manages prisoners; whoever passes your processing goes to him."

"No problem—I'll definitely coordinate with Team Leader Wu!"

"Not quite—you're mutually supporting, not you supporting him." Ran Yao chuckled, patting his shoulder. "Comrade Xiao Guo, though you don't have official status yet, you're rare specialized talent for our Security Group..."

Guo Yi left the Security Group office feeling a bit dizzy. His new office location was by the river, where the Building Group was constructing a POW camp—bulldozers and excavators roaring. In the river, a mass of naked bodies splashed about—prisoners bathing. Guo Yi had no interest in watching men bathe; he was turning to leave when someone ran up from behind.

"Guo, Guo—" It was Xue Ziliang, steel helmet on his head. "Finally found you—haven't seen you in two weeks."

"What's up?" Guo Yi moved slightly away—he did not want anyone noticing him talking with the American-born Chinese.

"Guo, help me talk to your, um, *leadership*—that's the word, right? Get me a different job." He looked miserably at his worn-through gloves. "I've been driving a tractor for two weeks. I'm ATF! Professional talent—you need me!"

"I can't decide that." Guo Yi scanned their surroundings, confirming no one was watching. "I'm temporary status too—how can I speak for you?"

"God, why do you all speak the same way!" Xue Ziliang wailed to heaven. "'I can't decide that'... 'This needs study'... 'Leadership is busy'..."

Guo Yi had originally wanted to dismiss him with one sentence and hurry off to discuss work with Wu De and Mu Min. But seeing this ABC's despairing expression, he pitied him a little. "Xue, you need to learn to be Chinese—understand? Being Chinese, first thing: patience." He poked Xue Ziliang's chest. "Patience—understand? Do your work well—leadership knows everything."

With that, he hurried off. Whether Xue Ziliang understood was another matter. For now, leadership seemed to trust him more than the foreigners—so he did not want his image constantly associated with Xue Ziliang and company.

The POW camp was set up by the river, temporarily fencing off a clearing with barbed wire. Prisoners themselves built shelters. The five prisoners Wu De was managing now proved very useful. Seeing more companions arrive, they immediately sensed they would be valued. Throughout the arrangements, each worked hard to demonstrate their ruthlessness and capability before Wu De.

The interrogation site was outside this temporary camp—a tent had been erected. For intimidation effect, a large wooden block stood outside with a medieval giant battle-axe from someone's collection. It had been deliberately contaminated with medical waste—the gleaming axe now smeared with blood. Though it had never cut anyone, viewers still felt their necks chill.

Yu Eshui, who had devised this scheme, had originally wanted to erect a forest of spears outside the tent, each tip impaling a dead man's head—but everyone had unanimously objected. This psychological shock was too intense; the first to break would likely be themselves.

At nightfall, roaring bonfires lit both sides of the path from tent to camp. The mysterious, terrifying atmosphere made prisoners—already anxious about their fate—even more nervous. When brought to the entrance and confronted with the blood-stained axe, most immediately collapsed in terror.

Interrogations were conducted by two people. Mu Min mostly stayed silent during questioning, only recording, occasionally prompting Xiao Guo. When it came to interrogation experience, the policewoman who had worked years in security and criminal investigation naturally had far more than Xiao Guo, whose main job had been "inviting people for tea." But having a female pirate interrogate Ming-era men seemed to over-shock them—so she temporarily took second position. Lin Xing, the prisoner who had learned Mandarin best, served as translator. Xiong Buyou also monitored on-site to prevent misunderstandings.

Prisoner name, address, age, occupation, family background—the Internal Affairs Committee had the IT Group prepare a personnel database on the server; they just filled in directly.

Though the interrogation team had created a sufficiently terrifying atmosphere, Guo Yi and Mu Min quickly learned of Chinese peasants' inherent cunning. Everyone claimed to be a three-generation poor peasant, not a tile overhead nor standing-room below, with eighty-year-old mothers above and eight-year-old sons below. Guo Yi was confused—*was "three-generation poor peasant" already this popular?*

As for names and addresses—chaos, impossible to verify. Over one hundred people supposedly came from eighty or ninety villages. Obviously, many were hiding their real situations. Many had rolled on the ground when captured, trying to use mud to disguise themselves—but river water had stripped their camouflage.

Interrogators of other eras would either be unable to sort through this mess of Zhang San, Li Si, and Wang Ermazi, or would resort to torture. But for people from modern institutions, this was not a problem. Lies improvised on the spot were easily forgotten.

"Gender?"

"Name?"

"You just said your name was Zhao San—now you've changed surnames? What's your real name?"

No matter how they swore they had never said "Zhao San," the voice recorder left them speechless. This little device, seeming like sorcery, made many confess the truth out of fear. Some continued lying until exposed again—then they were sent outside to walk circles around the bonfire, watched by guards, forbidden to sleep, prodded by spears to keep walking until willing to tell the truth. Guo Yi knew this torture was more effective than any other. The most stubborn man, after four fabricated lies were exposed and half a night walking circles, collapsed and died—a terrible warning to the other prisoners.

Soon, all prisoners confessed everything—including what they knew about others.

Most were indeed poor—though many of them were not as desperately poor as they had claimed. One-third of the prisoners came from a big village called Huang Family Village; the attack's leader was Huang Family Village Militia Commander Huang Shoutong.

Huang Village prisoners were mostly tenant farmers and long-term laborers, some with a little land of their own who also rented Huang family land. Being militia meant better treatment than regular tenants or laborers—tenants could pay less grain; laborers got higher wages. Others were Huang kinsmen or relatives—either small landlords or owner-cultivators. For this battle, besides county bonuses, Huang Shoutong had promised that victory would mean reduced rents, and families of the dead would receive compensation.

So Huang Village militia had fought especially bravely, with the heaviest casualties. According to one junior officer, excluding those conscripted as laborers, attacking militia casualties exceeded half.

"What about Huang Shoutong?" Guo Yi pressed.

"Didn't see the Militia Commander," the officer said. "When our guns fired, the Commander dismounted to direct—then disappeared..."

Others came from all over—most were long-term laborers sent by masters to make up numbers. Some were destitute outcasts, "without ties," sent by clans or villages to fight—meaning if they died, it did not matter. Those reluctant to reveal their situations were mostly small landlords, owner-cultivators, and tenant farmers with some property—fearing that involvement would lead pirates to plunder or extort their families. Many poor people, out of fear, also made things up.

From the prisoners' mouths, they learned much about the area: village distribution, approximate populations, which were rich households, which villages had what sideline industries or specialties. Everything was confessed in full. Some, as they talked, grew bold, saying they would join the pirates—offering to lead raids on their own village's rich households, if only allowed to kill so-and-so.

The interrogation team carefully recorded everything. Some prisoners, while talking, could not control themselves, bursting into wailing sobs. Lin Xing, listening, teared up too.

"What are they saying?" Seeing the bitter, grievance-filled expressions, Guo Yi asked Xiong Buyou.

"Truly tragic—" Xiong Buyou looked sympathetic, shaking his head. "Those volunteering to join—all have blood feuds."

"Have them tell details." Guo Yi suddenly grew interested. An idea formed in his mind. "One by one."
