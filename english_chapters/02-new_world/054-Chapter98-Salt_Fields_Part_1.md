# Chapter 98: Salt Fields (Part 1)

The preliminary survey of Nanan *dong* took two days. With *Aoya* Fu accompanying them, the survey team's work proceeded smoothly. Fa Shilu and Cui Yunhong handled the agricultural, forestry, and mineral aspects respectively, while Mu Min investigated local social conditions. Nanan *dong*'s resources proved remarkably rich.

First, there was timber—vast forests in the mountains. Though the locals' *shanlang* slash-and-burn cultivation had destroyed some of it, substantial reserves remained. Fa Shilu finally found the forest of perennial woody cotton he had been dreaming of—clearly the source of what locals used for spinning and weaving. The mountains also held many wild banana, lychee, longan, and jackfruit trees, which served as supplementary food sources for the locals. Betel-nut trees were abundant, though useless to the transmigrators except as trade goods for resale.

Second, their paddies contained numerous original rice strains—extremely valuable genetic resources for breeders. Given enough strains, continuous cross-breeding could develop new varieties. Just in Nanan Village's nearby paddies, Fa Shilu found seventeen different strains; on hillside *shanlang* plots, five upland-rice varieties—including *indica*, *japonica*, and glutinous types.

Hainan was a major area for Chinese wild-rice distribution, so the advantages of genetic diversity were obvious. Lingao in the 21st century was a major Chinese hybrid-rice seed-production base. Fa Shilu gazed at the collected samples, laughing even in his dreams! China's "Father of Hybrid Rice" might just be himself...

Sweet potatoes were not yet grown here—the Li did not even know this new crop existed. But they grew other tubers; most surprisingly, an Araceae species—usually medicinal elsewhere. Fa Shilu was not a traditional medicine practitioner, but he knew Araceae taro had mild toxicity. Could this really be food? Yet judging by the planted area, it was clearly a major crop. Another common type was the sweet yam, also called the hairy yam.

For coarse grains, he found millet. Fa Shilu had not known Hainan grew millet. The post-Bairren-Rapids tribute had included millet, which had puzzled the Agriculture Committee. Locals explained it was "duck-foot millet," a common Hainan grain with a very short maturation period.

Besides grain, he found wild ramie patches. The Li apparently showed little interest in systematic agriculture—they adopted a laissez-faire attitude with no field management. Fruit, ramie, and cotton grew wild; they simply harvested them without ever cultivating systematically.

Pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks free-ranged on the hillsides—no pens, no feeding—so they did not look particularly robust. Surprisingly, cattle numbers were high, both water buffalo and yellow cattle. But Fa Shilu was not a livestock specialist; breed assessment would require experts later.

"What a waste," Fa Shilu sighed. "The agricultural conditions here are excellent, but the level is barely above primitive society."

"Don't sigh." Wen Desi patted his shoulder. "Even those paddies along the Wenlan River—how advanced are they? Still far behind farmers back home."

Cui Yunhong's findings were less encouraging. Using maps from the other timespace, he had located important deposits: lignite that was shallowly buried and mineable, along with some mineral resources—limestone, perlite—in small quantities. But distance and poor roads limited their value. The rarest find was a small tungsten-ore vein—though useless to the transmigrators at present.

The Li people kept a wary distance from these strange Han. They watched them carrying odd equipment, climbing trees one moment, wading through paddies the next, then standing aside and sketching for half the day... But children possessed maximum curiosity for novelty—first watching from afar, gradually approaching, and finally handling the transmigrators' equipment. Thus communication began. Most transmigrators could not communicate with the children—only rock candy represented friendliness. Wen Desi had ordered it brought before departure. Mu Min had an instinctive fondness for these alternate-timespace compatriots; she also spoke Hainanese. Between the language barrier and the candy, by the second day she had acquired a following of children.

Watching these bare-bottomed, mud-splattered children running everywhere, Mu Min suddenly conceived an idea—one that would eventually become the transmigrators' first school in Li territory.

While the Li Territory Work Team conducted goodwill activities, another transmigrator team led by Wang Luobin advanced toward the nearby Ma'ao Peninsula. Their goal: to permanently solve the salt problem.

Salt was both an essential human necessity and a key raw material for modern chemical industries. For the transmigrator regime, they urgently needed a tradeable commodity. In ancient societies with underdeveloped commerce, nothing suited exchange better than salt. This region's salt industry had been developed since antiquity. Lingao faced the Qiongzhou Strait, with numerous ports and inlets, abundant natural salt flats, and seawater with a high sodium-chloride concentration—generally 1.5–2 Baumé degrees. During the dry season, high temperatures, strong winds, long sunlight hours, and little rainfall created excellent conditions for sea-salt production. Salt production had existed since the Tang Dynasty, originally using the boiling method. Thanks to favorable natural conditions, from the Yongle era onward, Hainan's salt fields had gradually adopted sun-evaporation for large-scale production. At Yantian Village on Xinying Bay in the southern part of the Yangpu Economic Development Zone, one of China's earliest solar salt-production sites remained—a well-preserved ancient salt field using primitive sun-evaporation methods, still operational today.

According to transmigrator historical records, the Ming-era Lingao salt field was located on the Ma'ao Peninsula, 25 km north of the county seat, with one Salt Field Superintendent under the Haibei Salt Bureau. Annual production was "1,417 *yin*, 230 *jin*." At 300 *jin* per *yin*, this meant over 200 tons annually—initially sufficient for the transmigrators' production and living needs.

Such abundant resources the transmigrator regime naturally needed to seize quickly. Wang Luobin's mission: an on-site investigation of this era's salt-evaporation technology, and consideration of modern-tech improvements to increase production—for modern chemistry, 200 tons was far too little.

The Salt Affairs Team was better equipped than the Li Territory Team. Since the mission required transporting salt back, the team was fully mechanized—five farm trucks deployed. The trucks bounced along dirt roads for about two hours. Travelers were rare along the way; upon entering the Ma'ao Peninsula, the area was virtually deserted. Only ruins and abandoned fields were visible, as if a great battle had occurred. Only scattered salt along the road confirmed they had not taken a wrong turn.

Wang Luobin was puzzled. According to his mission intelligence and historical records, this salt field had over a thousand salt workers, plus families—at least five or six thousand people around it, meaning numerous salt villages should exist. Yet the road showed only ruins after ruins.

Around noon, they found a half-abandoned flagstone path. Following it, they finally discovered a village with cooking smoke. Houses here were all volcanic-stone construction, alleys deep and winding, but many houses were tightly shuttered—some with tall weeds at their doors, clearly vacant for years. Collapsed houses dotted the village, with grass already growing on them.

Only the elderly, children, and women remained—barely clothed, appearing extremely impoverished. They did not flee from the strange visitors; their expressions were numb, apparently indifferent. Xiong Buyou asked around the village for a long time before locating the village head's home.

The head was surnamed Tan, a hereditary salt worker from a famous Hainan salt-making lineage. Faced with Xiong Buyou's request to buy salt, he had the salt warehouse opened: only 500–600 *jin* inside. Such a meager amount shocked Wang Luobin. Upon questioning, he learned the explanation: in Wanli 45, an earthquake had collapsed many salt-field flats—some sank into the sea. Ma'ao Salt Field's production never recovered to its original levels. But government-mandated commutation payments had not decreased. Many salt workers had fled. Making matters worse, from late Wanli onward, pirates frequently raided the salt field for salt certificates. Salt workers were killed or fled. Now only about 200 workers remained in the village. Ancient salt-evaporation was entirely labor-intensive; fewer workers meant even worse production. Annual commutation was never fully paid; government collection pressure was intense. Able-bodied villagers usually hid. Fortunately, Ma'ao had ample land and river water for irrigation. Salt workers farmed grain on the side, managing to survive. But they lived in constant fear.

This situation was a major blow to Wang Luobin. Clearly, the salt field's production was extremely poor. The Committee's original plan to control the field and buy all its output needed revision—the transmigrators would need not only to control the field but also to organize production recovery and expansion. Suddenly, Wang Luobin felt like the land-reform work-team leaders he remembered from childhood movies—everything needed rebuilding.

But organizing production recovery would not be easy. Wang Luobin decided to first inspect the salt field. After giving the numbed Village Head Tan a Mexican silver dollar, the numb-faced, seemingly indifferent headman finally agreed to show him the field.
