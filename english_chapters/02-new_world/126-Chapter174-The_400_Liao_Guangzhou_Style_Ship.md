# Chapter 174: The 400-*Liao* Guangzhou-Style Ship

Wen Desi followed Shipwright Zhang to inspect the ships. He had built many Western ship models over the years, but Chinese seagoing vessels were merely a casual hobby for him. Frustratingly, domestic research lagged far behind overseas efforts and was considerably less professional. Even models of ancient Chinese ships were mostly found in foreign collections. Available resources were scarce.

The shipyard had no drydock—just slipway racks. Wen Desi knew that drydock history in China dated back to the Northern Song Dynasty's Xining era, used for imperial barge repairs. But subsequent usage was rare—basically an anomaly. Without Shen Kuo's records in the *Dream Pool Essays*, the practice would probably be unknown.

"How do you launch ships?" Wen Desi was curious about ancient launching methods without proper slipways or docks.

"Cover the beach with slippery mud, then haul it out with ropes."

Brilliantly simple. Wen Desi nodded. "The wisdom of the people is inexhaustible"—that phrase was not merely rhetoric.

The ship before them was seventy percent complete. The hull was formed, but there was no deck. With his limited ancient ship knowledge, Wen recognized it as a "Guangzhou-style ship"—a *Guangchuan*. These were large Chinese seagoing vessels: wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, with a "virtual tail" at the stern. A key feature was the centerline-mounted drop-keel extending below the hull. This drop-board reduced rolling and leeway—the *Guangchuan*'s distinctive trait. The dimensions were roughly 400 *liao*—the Ming government's maximum allowed size for civilian vessels. Though Chinese shipwrights could obviously build thousand-ton ships, excessive size was operationally impractical for evasion and harbor access.

Wen Desi estimated the ship's dimensions: twenty-seven meters long, over five meters wide, with roughly seventy tons of displacement. It was similar to other 400-*liao* ships he had read about. Apparently, the design was standardized. Wen asked Shipwright Zhang whether he used "ship books"—the *chuanshu*. Zhang reddened embarrassedly: "No ship book."

Wen Desi knew he was guarding secrets. Thinking that without impressing him there would be endless evasions, he cleared his throat and, in Cantonese, recited a string of numbers:

"400-*liao* warship specifications: length 8 *zhang* 6 *chi* 9 *cun*; beam 1 *zhang* 7 *chi*; labor 2,487..."

Before he could finish, Shipwright Zhang dropped to his knees, his face filled with terror: "My... my... lord..."

Wen Desi said, "Rise. Don't be afraid."

"My lord already knows—"

"When you reach Bopu and see our iron ships, great and small, then you'll understand the depths of worldly ingenuity. What is one petty ship book!" Wen Desi thought: *Just basic info from ancient ship enthusiasts like "Nanchuan Ji."*

"Yes, yes." Shipwright Zhang recognized that this lord was an expert. Hearing about unseen iron ships excited him. His explanations became much more forthcoming.

This nearly completed ship was double-masted and fir-hulled. This differed from Wen Desi's memory—books said *Guangchuan* primarily featured "ironwood," specifically *Mesua ferrea*. Their captured *Fubo* was also a *Guangchuan*—though not ironwood, it used the same class of hardwood: lychee wood.

Zhang explained it was purely a matter of cost. Ironwood was expensive; fir was abundant and cheap, yet possessed adequate strength. According to him, a Cantonese merchant had ordered this particular vessel for regular Nanyang trade—buying a new ship for each voyage, sailing with cargo, selling the ship and all at the destination, and returning on other ships. Essentially one-use vessels—materials were minimized, cheapness prioritized.

"How much is such a ship?"

"Standard price is eight hundred *liang*. With quality timber, add two hundred."

So one ship cost one thousand *liang*. The Navy had indeed been a money furnace since antiquity. Shipbuilding clearly needed private capital involvement.

Structurally, twelve bulkheads divided the hull into thirteen compartments. The bulkhead planks were large camphor boards over ten centimeters thick. This was the Chinese sailing ship's world-leading feature: watertight compartments. Bulkhead-to-hull junctions had cradling ribs fixed with iron nails. Near the bottom, there were two drain holes per bulkhead and cradling rib. This surprised Wen Desi—surely drain holes would compromise watertightness!

Zhang explained that drain holes facilitated bilge pumping—they were plugged with special wooden stoppers during sailing.

The hull planks were all fir. The bottom planks were over twenty centimeters thick; hull sides were fifteen centimeters. Strake width ranged from eight to twenty centimeters—widest at midships, narrowing at the bow and stern. Lateral joints were butt joints; longitudinal ones used flush-rabbet joints, with seams filled with caulking. This caulking was a mixture of hemp fiber, tung oil, and ground oyster shell. Tung oil's chemical properties allowed it to easily polymerize, forming a tough waterproof film. Oyster shell, being over ninety percent calcium carbonate, combined best with tung oil when burnt into lime at high temperatures. The lime's strong bonding plus the tung oil produced a calcium soap compound that was extremely waterproof. Plank joints were also iron-nailed—nail holes sealed with oil putty.

The third and seventh bulkhead positions held the fore and main mast steps. Mast steps were large camphor blocks fixed to the bulkheads and hull, with two square holes for mast clasps that secured the masts. Chinese ships featured lowerable and removable masts. Mast steps had pivots, and bulkheads had storage holes for lowered masts.

Ballast consisted of beach cobblestones, mainly in the third and fourth compartments. Both sides had stringer frames for lower deck installation. Cargo and quarters would go on this deck.

The rudder was hardwood—even one-use ships did not skimp on critical parts. This was a primitive balanced adjustable-height rudder. The rudder blade had many holes—Zhang said this reduced the steering force needed—another *Guangchuan*-exclusive design.

Most interesting to Wen Desi were the workshop's stockpiled shipbuilding materials, especially the iron fittings. Chinese ships had used iron nails since the Warring States period, and the technology was fully mature by the Tang and Song dynasties. Seeing these examples excited him. There were six or seven varieties of nail types alone—shovel nails, square nails, date-stone nails, climbing-head nails, flat-head nails—each designed for specific purposes. There were also peculiar L-shaped iron fittings: fifty centimeters long, five centimeters wide, 0.6 centimeters thick—with one end bent ninety degrees—and four small holes. Zhang explained that these were *ju* clamps for connecting external planks to bulkheads. The key method: pre-cut slots in the bulkheads and holes in the planks; hammer the *ju* clamp from outside through the plank hole into the bulkhead slot; then nail the *ju* clamp's exposed flange to the bulkhead.

Wen Desi wandered the ship, contemplating transforming it into a sail cruiser. But it was too small: the 400-*liao* ships' cargo capacity was only thirty to forty tons. As a warship: maximum six to eight guns. For industrial-scale material transport, it was inadequate. As an exploration vessel—too slow. He still needed his beloved double-masted schooner.

"Old Zhang," Wen Desi said, "what's your opinion of red-hair ships?"

"Tall ships. Have cannons. Don't fear storms or pirates."

"What else?"

"The sail rigging is exquisite," Shipwright Zhang said honestly. "Fast. I've observed red-hair ships a long time—high masts, much sailcloth, greater wind capture. But their true secrets remain impenetrable."

"Hmm. These things I know."

Shipwright Zhang's eyes suddenly gleamed. But knowing that skills were his livelihood—and that this lord would not easily reveal them—his eyes dimmed.

Wen Desi smiled: "Let me tell you something. In Australia, where we come from, specialized schools teach shipbuilding. Everything you and I know about ships—combined—is just superficial compared to what they know. If you're interested, eventually someone will teach you."

Shipwright Zhang immediately knelt, kowtowing repeatedly: "If my lord transmits the secret arts—Zhang Jiqi is eternally grateful—I will safeguard them with lifelong service!"

"Hmm, rise." Wen Desi found a large rock, sat down, and opened his notebook, revealing a ship line drawing.

"Can you build this?"

Shipwright Zhang studied it for a long time. This drawing differed completely from any ship book: it had precise proportions and clear, accurate lines, not simple outlines. The unique three-view drawing provided an intuitive perception. He secretly marveled—just mastering this drafting art would guarantee a livelihood for a lifetime. These people were truly extraordinary.

He asked proportion questions, roughly estimating 1,000 *liao*. This scale—Zhang had never built anything so large.

"I've never built this size," Zhang said carefully. "But I'm willing to try."

Wen Desi's chosen design was a double-masted schooner. Fast and maneuverable—without armament, fewer than ten crew could operate it. Besides cargo, it could carry thirty formal passengers. Excellent for exploration and maritime patrol. The famous *America* was a double-masted schooner—winner of the 1851 yacht race with a crew of just nine. Later, it served as a Confederate blockade runner during the Civil War. Displacement: 170 tons, thirty meters long, seven-meter beam, three-meter draft. Armed with two 24-pounder carronades broadside plus one 12-pounder long gun on a center pivot mount. With lighter 6-pounders, it could mount six to eight guns.
