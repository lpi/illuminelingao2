# Chapter 45: New World

At first light, people aboard the *Fengcheng* were already stirring. The events of the previous night—especially the spectacular moment when the wormhole collapsed and vanished—had become an inexhaustible topic of conversation. Most people in the cabins hadn't witnessed it directly, but there was no shortage of DV footage and digital photos circulating.

The Executive Committee hadn't yet ordered anchors raised. People immediately discovered the first problem no one had anticipated: breakfast for this many people was utterly impossible to manage. The ship's galley was sized for a crew of forty—now the *Fengcheng* alone carried four hundred. Worse, even basic sanitation had become a crisis. Long lines formed outside the toilets. Those who couldn't wait simply clambered precariously onto the swaying small-craft deck and relieved themselves directly into the sea.

"Committee Member Ma, this won't work!" Beiwei, appointed as landing reconnaissance squad leader, stormed up to the poop deck, shouting at Ma Qianzhu, the newly appointed landing commander. "All this waste in the water will attract sharks! Landing like this is too dangerous!"

Ma Qianzhu said helplessly: "What am I supposed to do? The ship only has ten toilet stalls for four hundred people."

"If you don't manage this, accidents will happen! Forget sharks—people climbing around on those wobbly boat decks, one fall and there's no point even trying to fish them out."

Just then, Auntie Tian, who managed the cafeteria, appeared looking equally helpless:

"Committee Member Ma, what do we do? Everyone wants some congee, but looking at the ship's galley, it can't make congee for four hundred people—there's simply no time..."

Ma Qianzhu had just been lectured by Beiwei, and now someone was pestering him about congee. Seeing multiple problems erupting before the landing plan had even begun, he grew impatient: "Take this to Xiao Zishan—isn't he your supervisor?"

"But aren't you the landing commander? Everything on this ship falls under you."

*Isn't this all your own doing? Now you're asking me?* Ma Qianzhu cursed inwardly, but couldn't blow up—Auntie Tian was over fifty, had risked her life crossing over to help build a new world. He could only placate her and kick the ball back: "Make as much as you can, distribute it in batches. Something's better than nothing... Go discuss with Zishan again."

Not making congee was actually fine: everyone had two days' worth of dry rations. With adequate freshwater, they could survive on energy bars.

The problem was that Auntie Tian, upon seeing the ship had a galley, had simply started making breakfast according to habit without thinking. Before dawn, Li Yuanyuan from the General Affairs Group had led several young women to bring freshly made congee and steamed buns to the Committee members in the ship's superstructure—each person had even received a small dish of packaged pickles and a few fried peanuts.

Ma Qianzhu knew trouble was coming. The masses didn't mind scarcity—they minded inequality. *Why should you leaders eat hot congee and buns while we masses gnaw energy bars that taste like expired mooncake filling, washed down with cold water?* Starting the enterprise with differential treatment would scatter hearts and make the team unmanageable. So the Committee ate their congee furtively, no one near the portholes. He grabbed the internal phone: "Engine room? Max out the desalination equipment! We need to fully ensure freshwater supply!"

"Fully ensure—who are you?!" came an indignant voice. "The desalination system only produces this much. You want us to piss freshwater?" Ma Qianzhu recognized Xiao Bailang's voice—a mechanical processing specialist who also knew equipment installation and management, he'd been assigned three months aboard to learn engine operations.

*No respect for leadership!* Ma Qianzhu cursed silently. *You sissy, just watch me sell you to Thailand!* After venting mentally, he realized staying here was useless. He might as well follow Beiwei down to the deck.

Dong Shiye sat against his backpack on deck. His legs had gone weak climbing down from the small-boat deck—the sea yawning right between his dangling feet. One glance was enough to make you dizzy. Fortunately, the ship had almost no motion—calm as glass. The waning moon at the horizon was slowly fading. Watching the crowds queuing at the toilets while cursing colorfully, he felt the risk had been worth it.

No place to wash hands, but he'd prepared for this long ago. He took out a disinfecting wipe—he'd brought plenty of toilet paper, wipes, and water-purification tablets. Relying entirely on the organization was unreliable. He didn't take out a cup to brush his teeth either—many people along both railings were singing to the sea, streams of white foam leaving trails of stains down the hull. Quite a sight. He just used dental floss and a piece of chewing gum for oral hygiene. Not opening his neatly packed backpack—that was his principle.

The congee supplied by the Committee caused some temporary chaos. Dong Shiye didn't join in—each batch of four large pots served only forty people, one bowl each. The wait was too long. He didn't gnaw those awful energy bars either. He'd brought PLA individual special rations; some compressed biscuits with water would do. Drinking congee meant having to wash the bowl later. Without washing, the bowl became a petri dish for bacteria.

Looking out from the ship, the coastline that had been pitch-black last night was now clearly visible. Lingao was supposedly a well-developed county, but this stretch of coast looked utterly uninhabited.

The beach off the beam was very narrow, covered with black gravel—nothing like the "azure sea, silver sand" image of Hainan tourism posters. Behind it rose a low escarpment, the rock fractured by ancient earthquakes into gaps of various sizes and shapes. In some places, gentle slopes led to the cliff top.

Looking west, less than a nautical mile from the *Fengcheng*, a promontory jutted from the land—that would be Bopu Port's river mouth. The cape was covered with mangroves leaning toward the water. These mangroves were lush and verdant, extending across nearly the entire coastal area into the water. A botanist would have jumped for joy—such a complete mangrove ecosystem was extraordinarily rare in twenty-first-century Hainan.

Dong Shiye suddenly noticed something strange: among all these coastal trees, there wasn't a single coconut palm! This amazed the veteran outdoor enthusiast. Coconut palms were hardy trees, common on tropical and subtropical islands and coasts everywhere. He didn't know that Lingao originally had no coconut palms—the twenty-first-century coconuts in Lingao had only been introduced starting in the 1930s.

On the beach, large flocks of raucous seabirds wheeled and dove—mostly various gulls, plus some loons. Obviously, such dense flocks were rarely seen in the twenty-first century. This wild, primordial feeling was somewhat oppressive—clearly, humans had barely touched this place.

Commotion erupted on the *Fengcheng*'s starboard side. Led by Beiwei, the first landing reconnaissance squad—rifles and machetes strapped across their backs—climbed down the boarding ladder under everyone's gaze and boarded the motorboat.

The reconnaissance squad consisted of military personnel, surveyors, and geologists. Their mission: scout the port and coastal terrain for several kilometers, gather hydrographic data, and locate any villages and water sources. They were equipped with walkie-talkies, defensive weapons, 8×25 binoculars, surveying tools, and a three-megapixel camcorder.

To handle potential emergencies, everyone wore stab-resistant vests, camouflage, and steel helmets. The Committee had originally wanted to issue them riot gear, but Beiwei refused—while first-rate for protection, it was too cumbersome for active movement.

"Be careful!" Ma Qianzhu called from the boarding ladder.

"Don't worry." Beiwei turned and descended into the motorboat.

The engine's *putt-putt-putt* broke a primordial silence centuries ahead of schedule. The motorboat cut through the waves, speeding toward the hazy coastline.

Beiwei led the landing party, with full authority over landing security. Landing Command's orders: prioritize information gathering; avoid armed conflict with locals. If contact occurred, they were to learn what they could about local conditions. For this purpose, Xiong Buyou had been specifically included—normally, this manga-company homebody shouldn't have been in a first-wave recon team, but he spoke the Lingao dialect and would serve as interpreter.

Lingao dialect was an anomaly among Hainan's languages. In modern Hainan, only parts of Lingao, Danzhou, and Chengmai used it. Not only vastly different from Mandarin, it was completely distinct from Hainan's mainstream Qiongzhou dialect. Linguists generally considered it to share origins with Guangxi's Zhuang language.

This linguistic difference had always made Lingao a distinctive presence in Hainan, with limited outside contact and a rather closed social environment.

Xiong Buyou had originally planned to wear the chainmail he'd brought at the cost of luggage weight, but Beiwei firmly refused—too heavy. A stab-resistant vest was more practical.

Because map positioning would have significant errors—while they had the largest-scale Lingao county map and topographic chart available, four hundred years of change meant uncertain accuracy—it was purely better than nothing. Therefore, Beiwei decided not to approach the shore immediately but head directly toward the area's most prominent landmark: Lingao Cape.
