# Chapter 72: Wu De's New Assignment (Part 2)

"I think you'd better continue with bioengineering—that would help the crossing enterprise more."

"If you don't like my smoked fish, just say so." Hu Yicheng looked crestfallen. "Fine. I just finished dissecting a rabbit anyway..."

"Rabbit?!" Wu De started. This was good stuff.

"Caught yesterday." Hu Yicheng smiled like a fox. "Planning to roast it for lunch."

"Lunch?" Wu De regretfully realized that by then he'd be on watch at the construction site—no chance for roast rabbit.

"But I can save you a front leg..."

Wu De was about to thank him when an old saying came to mind: *When someone offers favors for nothing, they're either a thief or a swindler.* He barely knew this Xiao Hu—why offer rabbit?

Sure enough, Hu Yicheng immediately revealed his tail: "Yesterday, um, I saw you making seafood rice. Could I, uh, join your mess?"

"Sure, but bring your own rice." Wu De agreed readily—seafood rice was better with more portions.

"That would be great—I can also learn." He pointed toward the back kitchen. "Group Leader Wu Nanhai just got back. Caught over ten baskets of fish this morning—trying to figure out how to process them."

"Process? I should check that out—don't want it ruined again." This timespace really was resource-rich.

"I'll take you." Hu Yicheng apparently admired Wu De's cooking skills. Hearing he would supervise the cooking, he was delighted.

In back, a canvas shed had been set up with tree-trunk posts. Inside, it was steaming hot. A row of large pots was set up, fires burning, wood being chopped, water being carried—busy, busy, busy... and there were several women! Wu De was glad he'd had the foresight to put on underwear—otherwise he'd be an exhibitionist.

Entering the "kitchen," he saw a guy hunched over a laptop working. Xiao Hu called out: "Nanhai, someone's here to help with the fish!"

Wu Nanhai looked up: "Ah De? You're a fisherman—why haven't I seen you on the boats lately?" He looked him up and down. "A few days gone and you look like a native."

"I've been on guard duty. Used to be a sailor; now I'm a marine." He looked at himself: stripped down, lean, already dark-skinned, now barefoot and bare-chested in just shorts... quite the primitive look.

"Nanhai, aren't you in the Agriculture Group? Shouldn't you be doing vegetable greenhouses, raising chickens and pigs—not playing cook?"

"Xiao Zishan's idea. That kid wanted to dump the cafeteria headache, so he claimed agriculture equals food issues, making me Cafeteria Office Director as 'natural,'" Wu Nanhai said helplessly. "Actually, I want to care for the rabbits and chickens. The chickens seem not to have adjusted—or got spooked—haven't laid eggs since coming ashore. No idea when they'll recover. And the pigs aren't well either—won't eat—worrying..." His tender concern for the pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks made Wu De shudder.

"Cafeteria Office has quite a few ladies. Lucky you..."

"Lucky? They're all someone else's wives." Wu Nanhai had no interest. "Besides, I'm not into modern women. If I'm going to raise one, I'll start from a loli. Speaking of which, the Committee should be sending someone to Guangzhou to buy lolis soon, right?"

They were deep in discussing critical matters—at what age lolis were mature, and whether to raise them as *tsundere, kuudere, natural airhead,* or *glasses girl*—when a fat man stormed in furiously. Wu Nanhai's face changed; he tried to bury his head deeper but was yanked out.

"Where's my 'Blue Lightning'?"

Wu Nanhai said miserably: "Well... please accept my condolences... we buried it. You know, the weather's hot..."

The newcomer's face froze. Tears welled in his eyes. He turned and left abruptly—leaving everyone stunned.

"Who was that?..."

Wu Nanhai said: "That's Nikecha, back from Australia. Brought two racehorses and some carrier pigeons."

The two retired racehorses "Alanchi" and "Blue Lightning" had both been registered with an Australian racing association, though getting old. Nikecha had hoped to use his expertise to form a cavalry someday. But after arriving, harsh reality crushed his dreams. Horses are sensitive animals; the commotion after landing spooked "Blue Lightning." Despite the restraining frames, it stubbornly kept smashing its head against the wooden beam. Only after personnel and supplies were unloaded were horses and livestock hoisted ashore. The camp had no clean stables or horse hay. The nascent base could barely pipe in drinking water for humans; the daily supply of clean warm water horses needed couldn't be provided.

"He personally went to the Committee, repeatedly explaining how precious the horses were, and demanded 'at least five human portions' of beans and wheat daily."

"Result?"

"Need you ask? Where would the ship have soybeans, black beans, or barley? I only have some seeds. We brought some grain, but to save space, all rice."

"So he was refused?"

"More precisely, politely declined—because that bastard Xiao Zishan kicked the ball to me again!" Wu Nanhai said indignantly. "He insisted I have the most love for animals. I'm interested in obtaining animal products—not about love. Now anything involving live creatures gets dumped on Agriculture Group."

As if to prove his words, barking erupted from behind a bamboo fence—rising and falling, then joined by horse neighs, cattle lowing, pig grunts, chickens and ducks joining the racket. A cat with a bow tie around its neck rubbed against Wu Nanhai's pant leg.

"That's Yang Baogui's dog. He brought five—says they're future military/police dogs..."

"What about the horse?" Wu De couldn't forget the racehorse.

"Embarrassingly, he personally delivered the horse and pigeons, telling me to take care of these 'voiceless friends.'" Wu Nanhai grabbed a small fish from a basket and tossed it to the cat. "I never learned horse husbandry—don't know how to do it. The horse refused to eat—"

Hu Yicheng nearby nodded: "That horse was really hard to please. Wouldn't eat the grass we cut. Just fasted."

"Right, seemed agitated too," Wu Nanhai said. Nikecha had tried everything but couldn't calm the horse. Days without eating, plus heat, plus flies and mosquitoes—it collapsed yesterday.

"Last night I called Yang Baogui—he's a vet. He said it was hopeless. Then it died. I didn't dare tell Old Ni..."

"That's a pity—racehorses have great bloodlines."

"Actually, nothing to pity," Hu Yicheng said dismissively. "Both were geldings. What use are eighteen- or nineteen-year-old geldings?"

"I agree—nothing to lose." Wu Nanhai was also unconcerned. "Racehorses can't do farm work—can't pull carts or plow fields. Draft horses are more useful."

"Anyway, the fish?"

"All in those baskets." Wu Nanhai frowned. "Don't know what to do—boiled fish every day..."

"Tomorrow there'll be..."

"Shh, what are you babbling about?" Wu Nanhai nodded toward the women in the shed, whispering. "You want to be drowned in spit? I'm warning you—if this leaks, I know nothing."

"Fine, fine."

"Rabbit meat?"

"Hey, first help me figure out how to deal with this pile of fish." Wu Nanhai dragged him to the baskets—dripping wet, smelling of salty sea. It felt familiar to Wu De.

The baskets held all sorts of fish, big and small—even a small shark. That thing had too much ammonia smell; needed processing to be edible.

"For seafood appreciation, boiling is best—preserves original flavor. But for daily protein supplementation, plain boiling is too bland. My method isn't fancy—just seafood rice or grilling."

"Grilled fish? We don't have spices..."

"Can do without spices. Seafood rice is even simpler." He checked his watch—nearly 10. His shift started at noon; he had time to eat and demonstrate. "I'll show you."

"What's the maximum the field-kitchen rice pot can handle?"

"About one hundred portions at 200 grams per person."

"Fine, I'll make one batch first—then you continue."

Wu Nanhai, seeing a volunteer, quickly assembled the Cafeteria Office staff.

Wu De directed everyone to clean and sort the fish by size and species. Red-meat fish and white-meat fish separated; oily ones separated from lean; everything graded by size.

"Sea fish come in many varieties; we use them differently. Once the catch is ashore, sort promptly for easier processing."

He then led people to the riverside to gather wild vegetables. Last night nearby he'd found plenty: plantain, bitter greens, wild onion, and wild perilla. He picked two bundles, washed them in the river, tied them with grass, and brought everything back.

The stove was fed large amounts of firewood. With a dedicated bellows-operator, flames quickly grew. Water boiled; rice went in. While the rice cooked, he led by example processing fish.

Fish heads, tails, and guts went aside; bodies were chopped into small pieces. Shellfish were pried open for meat. Seaweed and wild vegetables were all chopped. A couple of stokes and the rice had expanded into porridge. Fish meat, shellfish meat, and seaweed were all thrown in. Using a large ladle, he stirred rice and fish together, covered for a few minutes, then added wild vegetables and wild onion, covered one more minute, sprinkled some salt—a pot of seafood rice was done.

The fish offal plus worthless small fry could be fermented into fish sauce. The Cafeteria Office didn't have cement tanks, but they'd found some large ceramic vats from the Patrol Inspector's kitchen. Wu De instructed them in making fish sauce.

Theoretically, any fish could make fish sauce, but typically only small, worthless fry were used. Processing byproducts like fish offal also worked. Add about one-third the fish weight in salt, mix evenly, cover with bamboo-mat lids, press down with large stones—done. Fermentation was best at 30°C or higher. Wu De had them place the vats outdoors for better fermentation.

"It takes a year to mature," Wu De said. "But the flavor is incredibly delicious..."

He also taught them salting and drying fish. Soon the kitchen reeked, fish-stench overwhelming, flies swarming. Everyone was barely enduring it. One girl finally couldn't take it and ran outside to vomit—today's seafood rice was beyond her enjoyment.
