# Chapter 138: New System (Part 1)

"Finding them wives—let's shelve that for now." Ma Qianzhu said.

"Now let's discuss finding women for ourselves—"

"No, that's not for discussion either. I want to talk about labor utilization." Ma Qianzhu interrupted. "We've brought all these people to Bairren—feeding and housing them, making them work. Then what?"

"Then they continue working, obviously."

"I mean—hmm—" He paused, choosing his words carefully. "Land, labor systems, compensation, and governance structures."

Wen Desi requested to speak:

"Before discussing labor systems or such topics, I think we should first establish status hierarchies for the natives. Otherwise, differential treatment cannot really be discussed."

Currently, the transmigrators classified directly controlled native laborers into three tiers:

**Slaves:** No personal freedom; forced labor; provided clothing and food; no wages. This category included captured prisoners—until screened and reformed, they remained at this level.

**Laborers:** Personal freedom; work assigned by transmigrators; free food and housing; currently also provided clothing. Transmigrators paid wages for labor.

**Workers:** Basically the same as laborers—but with 20% higher wages.

These tiers were mobile: slaves could be freed to laborer status; hardworking laborers could be promoted to worker status. Social mobility stabilized society—at least among the governed.

In the Committee's plan, the "worker" class would become their ruling foundation—producing qualified industrial workers, low-level administrators, and soldiers.

Workers enjoyed benefits and were the Committee's hope—but few laborers actually sought worker status. To date, workers numbered under one-quarter of Production Team One. Most still thought like hired hands—not truly ready to board the "pirate ship."

Where was the problem? Wu De had concluded: the worker system's limited effectiveness was mainly due to insufficient incentives. Workers only received 20% extra wages. Though promised housing and private plots—nothing had materialized. Even first-wave workers still lived in tents and sheds like everyone else. As for private plots: Lingao's wastelands were abundant—but lacking irrigation infrastructure, cultivation required enormous human labor. For laborers already working over twelve hours daily—there was no time or energy left for cultivation.

Finally, the transmigrators still wore the "pirates" label. Though county officials now coexisted peacefully—this did not mean locals recognized their legitimate rule. Getting just 20% extra for the risk of "joining pirates"—the risk-reward ratio was clearly disproportionate. Peasants might not understand economics—but they could calculate such basic sums.

"Should we quickly seek amnesty? Become reassuring good short-hairs?"

"No—amnesty isn't that easy. Zheng Zhilong's amnesty took years to achieve—and he was a Fujian native with extensive local connections. We're complete outsiders. If the officials view us as barbarians—same treatment as the Jurchen Wild Boar Skin—then there's nothing to negotiate."

The solution was reverse thinking. Since risk could not be reduced—increase the rewards. When risk and reward balanced—people would naturally take risks. There was a nearby example: Zheng Zhilong continuously recruited sailors and soldiers in Fujian precisely because piracy brought greater benefits to locals.

"Currently, a mere 20% income increase doesn't create significant differentiation among laborers."

The starting point would be implementing the worker housing policy. Committee members who had lived in rural China understood the enormous enthusiasm peasants had for building houses. After the household responsibility reform, improving peasants almost universally built new houses. Even today, many peasant families—despite having children settled in cities—still built village houses for them.

Having one's own home—temporary dwellers could never feel a sense of belonging. Only with personal houses would people view a place as their homeland—and strive to build and protect it. Otherwise, they were merely passing through—others' property meant nothing to them.

The production team housing under construction outside South Gate embodied this experiment. The Committee had instructed Engineering to build these as genuine villages—not mere collective dormitories.

The Construction Group had comprehensively considered rural habits, land efficiency, and material conservation—producing apartment building designs. Each building: three floors; three residential units per floor. Each unit: one 14㎡ bedroom, one 16㎡ main room, one 10㎡ kitchen. No in-unit toilets—shared toilet per floor. Sewage was piped to biogas pools for treatment. There was no water or electricity or independent drainage—but the designs reserved positions for future installation.

The apartments would primarily house families. These unit sizes were tight for large families—but suitable for four-to-five person households.

Buildings used brick-concrete construction. The first-batch floor slabs were wooden; Engineering planned future use of precast concrete slabs—reducing fire risk.

"What about property rights?" someone asked, viewing the blueprints and renderings.

"Since land policy isn't finalized—temporarily, houses only get house deeds. After land policy confirmation—supplementary land deeds will be issued."

Land ownership had generated disagreements among the transmigrators: most wanted confirmed private ownership; some insisted on state ownership; others proposed copying this timespace's policy—selling land-use rights rather than ownership—minus the strange term limits.

The Committee did not plan welfare housing for laborers—free things were undervalued. Each unit cost sixty taels silver; anyone could buy; installment payments were accepted; workers received a 10% discount.

Needless to say—workers with mortgages would defend the transmigrators' existence more than anyone—otherwise, their housing dreams would shatter. Committee members had seen local tenant farmers', laborers', and small farmers' housing conditions—such apartments were unattainable in several lifetimes.

"I have a question." Xiao Zishan raised his hand. "Peasants typically raise livestock. For apartment residents—what about livestock? If they want pigs or chickens—they can't keep them in the hallways, can they?"

"Livestock sheds and pigsties are collective style." Project explainer Mei Wan clarified. "Separate from residences—better for hygiene. Similarly, this new village has collective granaries—minimizing pest and rodent losses."

"With such worker benefits—laborers will all want to convert. There should be conditions."

"Correct." Wu De nodded approvingly. "We need to make worker status somewhat difficult to attain—creating competition."

His drafted worker application conditions:

1. Personnel with transmigrator-recognized specialized skills willing to serve. E.g., craftsmen, scholars, soldiers.

2. Those serving as laborers continuously for 12+ months who wished to continue.

3. Those with major meritorious contributions.

"But currently having just worker and laborer levels to differentiate people is no longer suitable for us." Wu De said.

Regardless of differential treatment—labor models were identical collective labor. Except for rare skilled craftsmen and intellectuals—most people worked according to daily dispatches based on various departments' labor requests, arranged by Wu De.

This system—during the current massive construction phase—ensured sufficient labor for every priority project, while strengthening control over laborers.

As many enterprises prepared for production—specialized industrial workers would emerge. Industrial workers were specialized—daily dispatching was inconvenient for production organization and made specialized workforce training difficult.

Migrants from Gou Manor (Production Team Two) contained many family units—completely different from the mostly single men of Team One. If men were laborers—what about their women and children's status? Currently, many women and children also worked—how should their wages be calculated? For families with multiple or young children—nurseries alone were not practical. Which budget category should cover nursery resources and expenses?... Countless issues reminded the Committee: they needed a civil administration system to manage their first batch of subjects.

The transmigrators had many choices for civil administration. Salt Field Village and Damei Village used village autonomy models—village committees managed affairs. This had ready templates and worked well. But under such systems, entrenched interests were too powerful—major positions would be monopolized by a few. Most typically: Salt Field Village—politics were almost entirely controlled by the Tan brothers. Though the Tan brothers were their protégés and seemingly loyal—this was still inferior to direct control.
