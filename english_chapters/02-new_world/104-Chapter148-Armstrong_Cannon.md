# Chapter 148: Armstrong Cannon

The projectile flew past the 400-meter mound and smashed out a crater thirty centimeters deep. The iron ball sitting in the pit was still smoking.

"The ground here is fairly soft," Lin Shenhe observed. "Harder ground would produce a ricochet effect—that would be even more devastating."

Zhang Bailin took a measurement: from the 400-meter stake to the crater, the actual distance was 460 meters.

"Range is acceptable," Lin Shenhe nodded with satisfaction. "Accuracy is also acceptable."

"This is *acceptable*? We hit nothing!" Ying Yu found it unbelievable. This was a cannon—and a direct-fire one at that.

"Correct—smoothbores operate at this level. Against dense formations, one shot kills at least a dozen men."

They continued firing with different angles and charges, expending over a dozen rounds. The range varied from 400 meters to over 1,200 meters. At maximum 45-degree elevation, the projectiles reached 1,500 meters. Beyond 400 meters, however, accuracy effectively disappeared—it was basically just shooting in a general direction. Throughout the process, only four mounds were actually hit. The cannon became red-hot but remained stable without cracking. For safety, after fifteen shots, Lin Shenhe called a cease-fire to switch cannons.

"More firing? I'm about to collapse." The artillerymen gasped for breath. Everything else was manageable, but repositioning the gun after each recoil was exhausting. Then came the physical drain of readjusting direction and angle.

"We still need recoil systems—otherwise we'll die from exhaustion," Zhang Bailin wheezed, nearly collapsing.

"Recoil guns need the Industrial Department to produce springs first," Lin Shenhe was equally exhausted. "Until then, don't even think about it."

After resting, they test-fired the clay-mold cast cannon. The range was slightly shorter than the iron-mold versions, but performance was otherwise acceptable.

Subsequently, the Artillery Group used iron molds combined with the Rodman method to cast 12-pounder howitzers, 12-pounder mountain howitzers, 12-pounder cannons, and other calibers. With their light cannon experience secured, they began casting naval 32-pounder cannons and 32-pounder carronades—short, direct-fire guns invented by the British Navy. All these various cannons were test-fired successfully. The area around Lingao Point echoed daily with the thunder of artillery, the skies filled with smoke.

With sufficient casting experience under their belts, the Artillery Group—using the Armstrong cannon drawings and explanations from their resource library—began designing an improved screw-breech Armstrong cannon.

Rifled cannons were different from smoothbores. Although the 32-pounder long guns reached a caliber of 120mm during casting, the designers cautiously set the caliber of the first Armstrong at 70mm.

The barrel material was cast steel. Casting steel was now routine for the Artillery Group, but the main issue was rifling. In proper arsenals, this required specialized machinery—or at least specialized tooling. Immediate manufacturing of such machines was impossible. Fortunately, the transmigrators had role models: the ordnance workers of the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies. With the simplest machinery and hand tools, they had successfully manufactured rifles and cannons. After researching the archives, Zhan Wuya decided to imitate Wu Yunduo's makeshift rifling technique: an olive-shaped steel cutter with spiral grooves around its circumference, which was forced through the barrel.

As for how to make this cutter—Wu Yunduo had only described it in general terms, without detailed drawings. The Artillery Group convened all their machinery and drafting experts for an overnight discussion, eventually producing design drawings. Jiang Ye supervised the process: first sand-casting, then machining the steel die on a lathe.

Finally, this extrusion method proved effective. Days later, the first Armstrong barrel was machined. The breechblock was trickier, but through the joint efforts of Jiang Ye and Xiao Bailang, a screw breechblock was completed and successfully installed. Assembled and polished, the cannon looked sleek and deadly. Everyone stroked and admired the smooth metal with expressions bordering on the obscene.

The shells used were cast-iron elongated pointed solid shot. However, fuzes for the rifled cannon presented a problem.

Fuzes—whether safety-equipped or not—were basically of the spring-and-striker type. This required two things: primers and springs. Compared to the primer's fulminate of mercury, springs were actually the bigger problem. Manufacturing springs itself wasn't difficult, but the materials were. Modern springs used alloy steel—something not producible with their small converters. The Mechanical Group had reserves of spring steel, but shell fuzes were consumables; they couldn't rely on finite reserves.

"How about chemical fuzes?" Zhang Bailin had a brainstorm.

"Meaning?"

"Using chemical reactions to detonate the shells." Zhang Bailin's idea was simple: glass or ceramic vials containing one chemical, surrounded by another reactive chemical. On impact, the vial would shatter, the chemicals would mix violently, and the explosive would detonate.

"Not very safe," Xiao Bailang said. "Shells are constantly being moved and transported. What if the vials break?"

"Separate transport. Keep the fuze and shell apart—install only before use."

Wang Luobin shook his head repeatedly. "The concept is fine, but you're forgetting something: chamber pressure in a rifled breechloader is much higher than in smoothbores. Fuzes need sufficient strength. Glass tubes would shatter upon firing—result: a burst barrel."

Zhang Bailin was dumbfounded—he hadn't considered the acceleration forces.

"Cannons aren't as easy as you imagined, huh?" Ying Yu patted his shoulder.

"This fuze could work for other explosives," Lin Shenhe said, "but absolutely not for artillery shells."

"So advanced cannons still aren't enough." Wang Luobin smiled bitterly. Smoothbore high-explosive shells posed no technical difficulty, but that technology couldn't be directly applied to rifled guns.

"Carbon steel can also make springs," Jiang Ye mused, recalling that he had seen carbon steel springs somewhere.

"It can work—0.6% carbon steel is usable. It's just unknown if the performance will suffice," Ji Wusheng said. "Worth trying—I'll research the heat treatment."

"Can you handle the heat treatment?" Zhan Wuya was also uncertain—he had only done simple heat-treatment work before.

"I'm not sure either—I only have books and experiments to guide me."

"This won't be simple—it's not work for one or two days."

After much fruitless deliberation, Lin Shenhe finally proposed a compromise: since the initial Armstrong deployment was naval, and anti-ship missions still prioritized armor-piercing capability, solid cast-iron shot would suffice for now.

"What about shore bombardment missions?"

"Use mortars," Lin Shenhe said.

Mortars were the predecessors of modern trench mortars—manufacturing them was much simpler. The accompanying explosive shells were easy to make. The downside was a high dud rate, but it was better than nothing.

"How do we solve the lead coating problem?" Wang Luobin asked. Historically, Armstrong cannons were removed from Royal Navy ships because lead fragments stripping off at the muzzle caused casualties among the crew.

"I read that someone proposed electroplating lead would solve this," Wang Luobin shared his solution.

Early rifled cannon shells used Minié ball-type technology—explosive gas expanded the shell base into the rifling. The shell bodies needed a soft metal coating to engage the rifling, and lead was ideal. The problem was that cast-iron bodies and lead skins bonded poorly. Without hydraulic presses to force the bonding, the result was the Royal Navy's Armstrong-style lead fragment injuries.

"Electroplating is currently too extravagant—and technically insufficient too," Zhan Wuya said.

"One idea—might work. The Americans used it on 3-inch Schenkl cannon shells."

Since the lead skin falling off injured people, and they couldn't prevent it, the best solution was to substitute something that wouldn't cause injury when it detached.

Schenkl shells used papier-mâché driving bands on the shell bases—a paper-pulp mixture. It had sufficient strength and flexibility for rifling engagement, but the fragments shattered at muzzle exit wouldn't injure anyone.

"Is this paper pulp difficult to make?"

"1860s technology—shouldn't be hard. Just paper pulp and glue. No ready formulas, though—experiments are needed."

"Assign it to the Chemistry Group—they have experience with this."

Mid-discussion, He Ming from the Military Group suddenly burst in, his face serious.

"What happened?" Wang Luobin sensed trouble.

"According to prisoner confessions—pirates will likely attack us soon!" He handed over a document. "This is the Security Group's interrogation bulletin."
