# Chapter 121: Ambitions of East Gate Blowing Rain and Solitary Seeking Marriage

In the second-floor meeting room—featuring public standard measures in the hall below—the East Gate Market Administration Office held its first meeting. The conditions were crude: the walls were only whitewashed with limestone and were not yet fully dry from the rushed construction. The floorboards were raw wood, as the Industrial Department hadn't found lacquer trees yet, and modern paint was a thing of the far-distant future. There was no ceiling or paneling whatsoever. The only piece of modern equipment was a single lightbulb hanging high from the roof. Yet the furniture was luxurious—in the 21st century, it would be worth several million at least. Rosewood painting tables, red sandalwood official-hat chairs, and huanghuali round stools were arranged haphazardly into a conference setup. All of it was loot from the Gou Manor.

There were seven or eight attendees, all interested in commercial work. Some had experience, while others were pure hobbyists. The leader was a young man who claimed to have worked as an urban management auxiliary officer. He had adopted a completely new name upon learning he'd head the East Gate Market: "Dongmen Chuiyu" *(East Gate Blowing Rain)*.

Beside him sat his deputy: he wore an iron-gray uniform-style shirt, black trousers, and a black cap with an armband reading "Administrative Law Enforcement Auxiliary." His face was murderous—he had the look of a street vendor terminator. Like Dongmen Chuiyu, his original name was unknown. In future Republic historical records, he would appear under the bizarre name "Dugu Qiuhun" *(Solitary Seeking Marriage)*. These two would create an entirely new commercial model in Ming-dynasty Lingao County.

In the not-too-distant future, the transmigrators' commerce would span all the seas, with their overseas trading network covering Europe, Asia, and Africa. But at this moment, their entire commercial operation occupied the unpaved dirt lot below their building. Fortunately, Wen Desi had declared that commerce was a Committee priority—whatever money or materials were needed would be provided.

Where the flag points, trade opens the path. Historical colonial expansion invariably used commercial trade as a breakthrough. Trade brought not just profits but became a crucial means for colonizers to establish footholds. For the transmigrators—having already seized territory by force—the next step was increasing local contacts, transforming from fierce, murderous pirates into merchants with abundant novel goods. The attraction of wealth would draw ever more wary locals to their side, ultimately linking their interests together.

The transmigrators themselves also needed trade support, especially for basic necessities like grain and supplementary foods, which had to come from local farmers. Relying on imports carried major uncertainties. Ancient Romans often experienced political upheaval when Egyptian grain ships were delayed—a situation absolutely to be avoided.

The meeting first reviewed yesterday's grain procurement. When scouts reported farmers beginning to deliver grain to landlords, the transmigrators immediately set up grain purchasing stations at East Gate Market. The local rice price was 1.3 *liang* of silver per *shi* *(94.4 kg)*. Calculating a typical 70% milling rate, the unhusked grain purchase price was set at 0.8 *liang* per *shi*. This price didn't account for transportation and profit margins—the Commercial Department estimated local unhusked grain prices at under 0.5 *liang* per *shi*. Offering 0.8 *liang* was already remarkably high.

Procurement went smoothly. Nearby commoners—from small farmers to major grain holders—seeing their eagerness to pay silver for grain, were all tempted. Initially, there were just scattered individuals, but recently, over 100–200 people came daily, shoulder-carrying or cart-pushing sacks and baskets of grain. The Commercial Department's seven or eight people couldn't cope, so the Agricultural Department staff were called to help.

Initial confusion occurred because locals habitually used the *dou* *(peck)* as the grain measurement unit—ten *dou* to one *shi*. The *dou* came in official and private versions of varying sizes. The tops of the *dou* were open—should the surface be level or heaped? How high of a heap based on eye estimation? Everyone was stumped. After some confusion, they decided to immediately implement new weights and measures and purchase by weight. The price was set at 0.8 *liang* per 100 kg, termed a "metric *shi*." A floor scale salvaged from the ship was used. Surprisingly, this measurement change provoked no seller objections or protests. From their perspective, if buyers wanted to purchase grain, what units they used was their business. This amazed Dongmen Chuiyu—no wonder landlords used "small out, large in"—commoners had no awareness of the importance of measurement standards.

Comparatively, commoners showed a keen interest in preventing grain weight fraud. Initially, inexperience and chaos meant that the purchased grain contained mixed chaff, even husks and sand, leading to losses. Someone suggested making grain probes for sampling. Wu Nanhai urgently trained them on grain quality and moisture content, reducing quality fraud.

"...As of today, we've purchased 90 tons of unhusked grain. 2,100 kg of peanuts," Dongmen Chuiyu reported the procurement status to the attending Committee members.

"How much more can you purchase?" Wen Desi asked. 90 tons of unhusked grain milled to brown rice would be barely 70 tons. It looked like a lot, but with more and more mouths to feed, plus commoner relief, it was somewhat tight.

Yu Eshui opened his notebook. "Purchasing capacity remains. According to county gazetteer records, during the Wanli era, Lingao's autumn grain tax principal was 7,646.927 *shi*; newly reclaimed land added 6.079 *shi*, for a total of 7,686.079 *shi*. That's just the principal. Adding miscellaneous surtaxes, meltage fees, and official layer skimmings, the actual delivered grain was surely over 10,000 *shi*. Now—in the late Ming—when wealthy households' land and population concealment is most severe, substantial acreage likely wasn't grain taxed. So I estimate Lingao's total autumn grain output at 50,000–70,000 *shi*. Purchasing 3,000–5,000 *shi* is no problem."

Someone questioned, "Is stockpiling this much grain necessary? Gou Manor yielded over 1,000 *shi*. Plus, the salt village is already selling salt to the mainland, trading salt for Guangdong grain. We could also buy grain from Vietnam."

Wu Nanhai took food issues very seriously and immediately rebutted, "The more grain, the better. Grain in hand, peace of mind. Guangdong, Vietnam—those are distant waters. If the supply gets cut, it'll destabilize morale."

Wen Desi added, "At this stage, grain is a harder currency than silver. In any famine, grain prices skyrocket while silver devalues. Don't forget—this is the Little Ice Age. Natural disasters are frequent. We're not just a few ships and a few hundred people anymore. Think county-scale. Prepare for every contingency."

"I also flag the trade balance and silver reserves for the Committee's attention," Cheng Dong spoke for Finance. "Currently, our trade shows a severe deficit—silver is flowing out rapidly. After Gou Manor, our silver reserves rose to 15,000 *liang* (old system). In these few days, nearly 1,000 *liang* flowed out. This can't continue—circulating currency also has demands."

"Xiao Zishan went to Guangzhou. Have him withdraw a few tens of thousands from Gao's?"

"No need," Wen Desi said. "Lingao is small—too much silver influx isn't good. We have another substitute—salt." Salt had historically served as currency. He planned to use it for partial grain and labor payments.

But some opposed this: to commoners, silver was clearly more attractive than salt, as it was easier to carry and use. Commoners had tasted the benefits of cash purchasing—they wouldn't like a sudden forced barter.

"Open a salt shop." Dongmen Chuiyu had a sudden inspiration. "Specialized salt sales. They sell grain with their left hand, get silver, and spend it back to us with their right. Haha, I'm such a crafty merchant—"

"Good idea. Using grain and salt as equivalents isn't sustainable long-term. We control county salt production now—perfect for currency recovery." Cheng Dong nodded approval.

Dongmen Chuiyu struck while the iron was hot and quickly handed over a document. "This is our Commercial Group's East Gate Market development plan. Please approve promptly!"

"Development plan?" The Committee members were startled. Their free market outside Bairren Fortress was meant only for promoting trade and local relations. Few had seriously considered how to manage it. They'd imagined it like domestic free markets: farmers and vendors coming to sell goods—at most, maybe exempting stall fees.

"Indeed, a development plan," Dongmen seized the moment, standing. "Committee members, allow me to present this comprehensive plan. I believe that with this plan, under the Committee's correct leadership, guided by Director Wen, and strongly supported by Commissioner Cheng—"

"Cut the crap! We're in the Ming Dynasty—still doing this routine?!" Dugu Qiuhun was impatient.

"—our East Gate Market will become all of Lingao's, no—all of Hainan's most prosperous commercial market!"

Dongmen Chuiyu had unofficial civil service experience and couldn't be bothered by Qiuhun's grumbles. After his preamble, he quickly hung a newly drawn plan on the blackboard behind him. He'd visited the Construction Engineering Group, sweet-talking endlessly and offering several packs of cigarettes to get this done.
