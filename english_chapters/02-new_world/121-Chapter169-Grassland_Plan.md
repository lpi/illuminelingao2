# Chapter 169: Grassland Plan

Huang Xiong participated in the expedition as the 8th Squad Leader of the 3rd Company. He had never witnessed such a lavish march. The units followed the coastline, with the Navy's *Fubo* cruising nearby, maintaining pace. At every bivouac, supply ships quickly beached—wheeled field kitchens rolled down wide gangplanks.

The field kitchens were ingeniously constructed from thin iron plates, complete with stoves and chimneys. Originally designed to be horse-drawn, for this operation they were transported by ship. Firewood gathered by the soldiers was quickly ignited, and crates of provisions were unloaded from the vessels.

Water was pumped from a dedicated transport ship—an extravagance that astonished Huang Xiong. He knew the Australians "processed" everything—including drinking water. They never drank raw water from rivers or wells, and they strictly forbade their subordinates from doing so as well.

For logistics organizer Ma Qianzhu, this wasn't unusual. The transmigrators lacked bleaching powder for field water purification. A coastal march meant difficult freshwater supply—Lingao's west was notoriously water-scarce. Ship transport was safe and convenient, saving the soldiers time and energy on water collection.

The crates didn't contain rice or flour—they held paper-wrapped blocks marked with Arabic numerals and strange words: "Grassland-1," "Grassland-2," and so on. The paper wrappers had different-colored bands. Huang Xiong watched curiously as the cooks unwrapped them, revealing grayish or brownish blocks. They looked decidedly unappetizing. But once boiling water was added, a strange fragrance arose. The appearance remained bizarre, but the aroma made mouths water—especially for soldiers who had been marching all day under heavy packs.

"What's this?" he asked the cook stirring the pot.

"Grassland-1 and -2."

"What *is* it?"

"No idea. Chief Ma got it directly from the Farm." The cook sniffed the rising steam. "Smells great, though. I don't know the ingredients."

"Flour paste? I can't eat wheat." One Lingao local complained.

"Flour paste? Dream on. I bet it's sweet potato powder."

"Can't be," Huang Xiong said. "On regular days we eat white rice—but on campaign we eat potatoes? Nobody would do that." He knew that normally soldiers were treated like beggars, but combat required proper feeding.

"Chow's ready! Chow's ready!" The cook banged his ladle against the pot rim.

Soldiers lined up by unit number—1st Platoon 1st Squad first, then 2nd Squad—proceeding down to the 3rd Platoon 9th Squad at the end. The New Army officers demonstrated officer-soldier equality, lining up with the soldiers ever since training began. Now it was habitual. Though some officers complained—daily white rice plus salted fish was a luxury for soldiers, but for officers, it was monotony—some had tried to sneak to the cafeteria for extras. Ma Qianzhu discovered this and strictly forbade it, ordering officers to eat with the soldiers. He led by example.

After persevering for several days, Ma Qianzhu found that unlike the five-kilometer runs (which got easier with persistence), the food situation only grew worse. Finally, he decided that officers would receive evening supplements. For this expedition, officers' packs contained 125 grams of canned luncheon meat—making all the other transmigrators green with envy.

Huang Xiong queued for a portion of the paste. He studied it momentarily, closed his eyes, and spooned it in. The richness of the flavor almost overwhelmed his taste buds. Such deliciousness existed in this world! He quickly finished everything and rushed to check for leftovers. The pot was already mobbed—everyone holding up their bowls demanding "more."

The cook—facing such enthusiasm for the first time—couldn't decide who should receive the remaining scrapings. Finally, he added water and distributed it as soup.

Dongmen Chuiyu nodded, writing in his notebook: "Grassland-1 and -2: highly satisfactory."

After the meal, the Medical Team's female nurses landed, carrying Red Cross boxes and asking about pains and discomfort. Immediately, many claimed foot pain or stomach aches.

Tian Liang spotted Guo Fu among the nurses—he claimed stomach pain too. The report of mass stomach complaints terrified Dr. He ("River Horse"), who was still aboard the ship. Post-meal mass stomach aches? Food poisoning? Even mass diarrhea was unacceptable. A military demonstration turning into a trail of diarrhea would be a massive embarrassment. He personally landed with his medicine kit.

"Your stomach's perfectly fine." Dr. He slapped Tian Liang's belly—now it truly hurt.

The stomach farce quickly ended. The units resumed the march. Field kitchens were loaded back onto the ships. Soldiers packed up everything, including burying feces and garbage. Hygiene work was never neglected.

These two hundred-some men marched along barren roads toward Baitu. The weather was clear. Soldiers advanced to the rhythmic beat of drums. Occasionally they passed farmers and merchants. Sometimes they passed villages. Seeing orderly troops pass, people watched—but didn't flee. The transmigrators' "righteous" reputation had clearly spread county-wide.

Roadside village gentry and elders, courting goodwill, sent representatives bearing tea, grain, chickens, and pork to "entertain the troops." Xi Yazhou always spoke with them politely, then dismissed the sweating elders—but accepted nothing. Huang Xiong found this incomprehensible. Disciplined armies simply didn't loot or disturb civilians—but refusing *offered* gifts?

He mentioned this to Old Tiger, who laughed. "Meat? Ask the Medical Team if they'd take it."

"Why not?" Huang Xiong wondered. Did Australians eat special meat?

"You're still new. You'll understand eventually."

Near dusk, the units had covered two-thirds of the distance. Tomorrow meant mountain marching. According to the maps, Baitu was under fifteen kilometers away in a straight line. Xi Yazhou ordered a bivouac, preparing for the next day's assault.

"Set up camp! Cadets, supervise!" Xi Yazhou ordered.

The Military-Political School cadets were distributed among the platoons for observation—watching the transmigrator officers' command and management methods. Headquarters also had cadets. Once the order was given, they sprang into action.

Bivouac training had been drilled countless times. Officers, cadets, and soldiers all knew their responsibilities. After site selection, platoons self-organized. Under cadet coordination, they assigned work sectors and tasks per regulations: digging sinusoidal trenches, piling excess soil into berms, placing barbed wire atop the berms, and setting up wooden corner towers. All grass and shrubs within one hundred meters were cleared.

Bivouacs always meant defense first—this ancient Roman principle was also adopted by the transmigrators, even with their superior technology and training.

Soldiers cut poles. Two shelter-halves tied together formed a two-man tent. The bivouac was zoned by platoon—with drainage ditches and movement paths between zones. An emergency plan pre-assigned each platoon's assembly positions. Everything was well-organized.

Seeing fifteen- or sixteen-year-old cadets managing affairs competently, Huang Xiong was astonished. He himself could do this, but only because of years of military experience. These cadets had barely spent two months with the bald people. Though still somewhat rough around the edges—with time and combat experience, they would become qualified officers.

He quietly asked one cadet, "Where did you learn all this?"

"The Chiefs taught us. Also from this—" The young cadet pulled a worn-covered book from his satchel: *Infantry Regulations*.

"Just from reading?"

"The Chiefs taught directly from this book. Everything's in here—digging trenches, setting up camp, march formations—" The cadet spoke reverently about the regulations book, claiming "it has everything."

*Just from the military manual!* Huang Xiong thought skeptically. Wasn't this just fighting battles on paper, like Zhao Kuo from the tales? He recalled that Australians did seem to love books. Though soldiers couldn't enter headquarters, he had peeked inside. Most of the contents were books and paper scrolls—exactly like scholars' studies.

Were the Australians planning to fight wars from books? It seemed utterly unbelievable.
