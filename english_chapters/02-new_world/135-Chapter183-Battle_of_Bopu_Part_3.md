# Chapter 183: The Battle of Bopu (Part 3)

The *Countess of Scarborough* hugged Lingao Point, drifting slowly into the bay on the tide while continuously firing. The white searchlight beams kept the ship illuminated. The Easterners ashore had obviously made her their primary target. Shells flew constantly. Fortunately, the enemy lacked heavy artillery. The Spanish galleon's solid oak hull withstood most hits, though some shells penetrated. But casualties mounted. The deck was strewn with dismembered bodies, and blood ran in the deck scuppers. Aragonés was reaching his limit. At this rate, without recruiting Chinese sailors locally, he'd have to limp back to Manila.

"This Devil's light!" Aragonés cursed. "Haven't they succeeded yet?" he asked Li Siya again. Even her usually calm face showed strain. Besides the Spanish firepower, Liu Xiang had committed significant resources. All landing parties were veteran pirates—many were desperados and deserters from the government navy. By her assessment, the *Countess of Scarborough*'s firepower was unmatched on China's coast. While maybe not capable of destroying Liu Xiang as boasted, suppressing shore fire should have been easy. Combined with elite pirates, capturing ships should have been a certainty. The meticulously planned operation wasn't going any better than Zhu Cailao's disaster.

A distinctive shrieking whistle cut through the air. Both of them started. A pointed shell punched clean through the broadside. Splinters, blood, and body parts flew from the breach. Screams echoed.

"Fire!"

At Bai Yu's command, another 70mm pointed shell screamed from the muzzle. The two converted trawlers' four 70mm rifled guns targeted the *Countess of Scarborough* with rotating fire. Rifled pointed armor-piercing shells had many times the penetration of round shot. No oak planking could withstand them.

The *Countess of Scarborough* finally broke. These suddenly appearing shells had destroyed nearly one entire broadside. Nine of the sixteen guns were completely disabled. Below-deck gunners had lost over half their number.

"Fire the signal rocket. Retreat." Aragonés finally ordered the withdrawal. Though the tide hadn't turned yet and exiting the bay wouldn't be easy, if he didn't retreat now, he might never leave. The alliance with Liu Xiang could go to hell. Losing the ship meant losing everything he'd staked. What awaited him was the Manila Governor's fury and creditors' prison.

"Captain, some of our rowboats haven't returned—"

"Forget those filthy natives. Come about!"

"Not enough rowers in the boats."

"Get everyone who can move to row!" Aragonés exploded. "Move!"

Dozens of sailors slid down ropes into rowboats. With long oars pushing, the Spanish galleon laboriously turned, beginning retreat. Aragonés ordered operational guns to keep firing—partly to suppress the enemy, partly to consume ammunition. Lighter is better when fleeing.

"Devils!" He ground his teeth at the massive silhouette deep in the harbor, feeling a great chill.

Li Siya stood beside him. She'd considered stopping Aragonés's retreat—if he fled, Liu's five double-masted ships' few guns couldn't suppress the enemy at all. Ships and men would all be lost here. But now wasn't the time for loyalty. She casually pulled up her cloak's hood and inconspicuously withdrew from the poop deck.

The Spanish retreat completely broke the pirates' morale in the bay. Two of five double-masters had already been sunk by harbor guns. The other three, seeing the Spanish flee, also turned about. One exploded while fleeing, smoke and fire rocketing skyward. Shore pirates immediately panicked. Many dropped weapons and rushed toward beach sampans. At the few remaining sampans, fierce fighting broke out. Many were killed. Overcrowded escape boats became uncontrollable amid chaos and rocking. When pursuing transmigrators continued firing with rifles from the beach, some capsized. The sea was full of floating, struggling heads. Others, seeing no hope, fled into the nearby mangroves to survive.

As various forces gradually consolidated and command coordination smoothed, the infantry platoon rushed from Bairren arrived. Xi Yazhou had led soldiers in forced march to Bopu, heart churning with anxiety, not knowing the port's status. Along the way, thunderous gunfire and wildly sweeping searchlights were terrifying. He feared heavy transmigrator casualties.

Reaching the camp, though devastated all around, seeing Wu De revealed that twenty or thirty transmigrators were wounded, mostly minor. Native laborers and soldiers had suffered more.

Since it wasn't yet dawn and combat had been chaotic, arriving forces only secured intersections and key points, guarding against enemy escape or second attack, waiting for daylight. Li Haiping suggested launching trawlers to pursue, sink or capture the galleon. But everyone felt the situation was unclear; better to stay defensive for now.

While discussing next steps, battlefield cleanup, and treating wounded, suddenly came commotion—then cannon, rifle, and battle cries. Ten-plus minutes later, all sounds ceased, with occasional screams.

The pirates huddled in mangroves, seeing no escape, had tried breaking out. The waiting marines and guns slaughtered them. All killed. Even wounded received bayonet coups de grâce.

After an hour's fierce fighting, fires in Bopu Harbor gradually died. Only one exploded double-master still burned and drifted. The water was covered with debris and corpses. Of approximately 400 landing pirates, Chinese and foreign, over half would never see tomorrow's sun. Wounded were everywhere, moans and screams rising and falling. The medical team from Bairren and nursing school students were overwhelmed.

Wu De directed firefighting while requisitioning laborers and supplies from Bairren for battlefield cleanup. He personally visited the quarantine camp. Several hundred Baitu relocatees, men and women, young and old, were there. Some shells had hit during the battle, damaging buildings, causing a dozen casualties. The camp had briefly panicked. Wu De reassured everyone: pirates had attacked and been repulsed. He had stretcher teams evacuate wounded for treatment.

After dawn, forces began large-scale sweeps of surrounding areas. Few survivors remained. Fewer than fifty prisoners. The seriously wounded weren't worth transmigrators' moral debate—New Army soldiers dispatched each with a bayonet. Only those who could walk to the aid station survived.

Executive Committee members toured the beach under marine escort. After the night's fierce battle, everyone felt they'd survived catastrophe. Many were pale. Overall, there was less vomiting than after the first counter-encirclement victory. Apparently, everyone was growing accustomed to bloody scenes. The New Army soldiers, though also mostly first-timers, were equally unfazed by gore—people of this spacetime had seen too much death.

Ma Qianzhu walked while chatting, boosting morale. In his view, this battle's intensity was just the beginning. More severe tests awaited.

"Commissioner Ma, battle statistics are ready." Planning Committee's work was famously precise, efficient, and merciless.

Ma Qianzhu reviewed them, then addressed everyone: "This battle—we're seriously in the red."

Everyone was stunned.

"Don't find this funny." Ma Qianzhu irritably tapped his folder. "If you think a few hundred sheet-metal knives, some matchlocks, and a dozen leaky sampans compensate for 1,900 bullets, 214 shells, and several hundred kilograms of powder?" He added finally: "20 New Army soldiers killed. 15 laborers killed. 10 permanently disabled."

The final casualty figures were indeed shocking. New Army soldiers were carefully trained seeds of their future army, painful to lose. Laborers at least spoke some Mandarin and had adapted to local work methods, building basic trust.

"Those plague-carrying pirates!" Li Haiping was heartsick at the Marine Company's heavy losses.

"If you insist on training your own marines, of course training is insufficient. Land fighting still relies on—"

Wei Aiwen's words weren't finished before Naval personnel glared as if ready to devour him alive.

Xi Yazhou, seeing a brawl imminent, quickly intervened: "What's the point of this now? Everyone calm down. Let's review the battle, patch holes, figure out what to do next."

"Marines need at least two companies," Li Haiping immediately proposed. "Bopu's defense burden is too heavy. Guard posts are too scattered. And there's the tower to man."

Ma Qianzhu silenced about-to-speak Wei Aiwen: "Navy vacancies must be filled immediately. Expansion needs comprehensive consideration. Let's first discuss Bopu's defenses."

Bopu's defense was still weak. Too few gun emplacements. Heavy guns insufficient. Lingao beacon tower proved its enormous value in battle—commanding overview of the entire battlefield with real-time situation reports. The searchlight provided excellent battlefield illumination. By comparison, the 12-pounder's effectiveness was limited. The artillery team believed: tower guns should be 24-pounder or larger. The transmigrators' cast heavy guns, limited by lifting capacity, hadn't made it to the tower and were placed in temporary pier emplacements. These hasty emplacements proved defensively inadequate and lacked infantry protection. In combat, they were quickly overrun—dozen marines all killed, causing the battle's heaviest casualties.

The 12-pounder mountain howitzer again proved its tremendous value. Its mobility—three or four people could drag it running—made it the transmigrators' most reliable area-effect weapon. Lin Shenhe noted that with one or two mountain howitzers at those temporary emplacements, they might not have fallen so quickly.

Li Di, Bai Yu, and other gunners also pointed out: too few shell types. Solid shot caused limited damage to enemy ships. Canister was only effective at close range.

"Without explosive shells, at least we need incendiaries. Oh, and chain shot."

"With chain shot, we could've broken the Spanish galleon's masts—she couldn't escape!"

"Primitive incendiaries aren't hard, right? Just a red-hot iron ball. That would work. At least it could set ships on fire."

"Besides guns, the port itself needs other defenses." Li Haiping suggested. "Can we make mines? I know contact mines are difficult. What about command-detonated mines? That shouldn't be too technically challenging?"

"It's not easy either." Lin Shenhe shook his head. "Command-detonated mines need electrical detonation—we can substitute light bulbs, and our stocks are sufficient. But the wiring needed is too much. Actually, contact mines are easier. We should focus our efforts there."

After discussion, they decided to build two three-story brick-and-concrete gun towers near the pier. *Fengcheng*'s tall profile could also function like the beacon tower in the harbor. The Executive Committee decided to add one or two rotatable heavy guns on her. They'd also consider blocking devices at the harbor entrance.
