# Chapter 140: East Gate Market Police Station (Part 1)

Clear skies, cloudless. Lingao's winter was approaching. The previously sweltering weather had cooled considerably. With the autumn harvest nearing completion, busy commoners now had leisure time.

Bairren's population had increased. The usually empty simple road attracted many pedestrians due to its convenience.

East Gate Market's commercial activity had greatly enhanced transmigrator-local connections. Besides salt, the rice mill produced clean, attractive rice—with honest operations showing exactly how much rice, bran, and husks resulted from each batch. No skimming or cheating—far superior to village workshops. Best of all: flexible payment. Silver was obviously accepted, but unhulled rice, milled rice, bran, even straw could offset processing fees. This attracted nearby grain households. Outsourced processing accounted for sixty percent of mill operations—daily processing fees alone brought over ten *shi* of rice plus considerable husks. With convenient processing, good roads, and no taxes—East Gate Market was becoming Lingao County's grain processing and wholesale center. During routine inspections, Dongmen Chuiyu discovered grain households from neighboring counties coming here to trade. Truly—profit made people risk life and limb.

East Gate Street's roadside plots had been partially sold. Several shops were under construction—mostly opened by county gentry. Besides the commercial opportunities, this gave connections with the short-hairs—if problems arose, shopkeepers could negotiate directly. Bricks, tiles, and timber were ready-made—continuously transported from Damei Village's Gou Manor demolition site. Beyond the transmigrators' own use, most were cheaply sold to lot buyers.

Lin Quan'an—the first peddler to trade with short-hairs—had become the area's biggest food supplier. After the Gou Manor reconnaissance, he had earned a twenty-tael reward. With the mass migration to Bairren Fortress, his food supply scale had doubled. He had built a shop at East Gate Market, hired an accountant, and employed four or five workers, daily carting through villages collecting live pigs, poultry, eggs, and vegetables. Lin Quan'an was already planning: soon he would return to Fujian for his wife, or build a house in his hometown and take a concubine for Lingao... Such glorious prospects made him float.

One annoyance: his workers' food was too good. His heartache was not for the short-hairs' money—theoretically, well-fed workers made him more money—but this set bad examples. Several workers had already quit to join the short-hairs. Though Lin Quan'an earned well, capitalist nature still made him resist improving employee conditions. Someone would always work.

But recently the situation had changed. The autumn harvest was nearly finished. Lingao did not grow wheat—post-rice-harvest peasants usually took short-term work. Previously, off-season day laborers required no wages—just meals. But now the short-hairs were mass-recruiting at East Gate Market. Off-season laborers all went to them. Mainland migrants coming to Lingao mostly became short-hair long-term workers. Result: the labor market was unprecedentedly tight. Under the short-hairs' benchmark effect, entire labor market prices rose.

Wage increases made markets livelier. Even neighboring county peddlers were attracted. Besides merchants, locals who were not starving brought families to Bairren to gawk: they could not enter the fortress, but walking around the trenches and barbed wire—glimpsing from a distance was fine. Button-front short clothes, strange rattan helmets, long bayonet-mounted muskets, buildings on the beach with giant pipes below... More adventurous visitors followed the simple roads to Bopu Harbor—seeing the legendary steel ships.

Commoners' fear of short-hairs diminished. Dongmen Chuiyu found that Chinese commoners' commercial instincts were truly strong. Not just merchants at East Gate Market—roadside tea vendors appeared. All three blockhouses along the route had tea stalls. Military Group soldiers now frequently faced merchant harassment—besides vegetable and poultry sellers, they had to chase away flirtatious women. Not that their revolutionary will was strong—they simply could not enjoy such fortune.

Subsequently, security issues emerged. Busy places attracted all sorts. Besides overt and covert prostitutes, gambling stalls appeared, then pickpockets and thieves, then beggars. Various underworld trades gradually surfaced.

The most serious problem: theft. Daily, several unlucky victims lost money or goods. Even Li Mei's Welfare Society shop was burglarized. Dugu Qiuhun's "East Gate Market Comprehensive Law Enforcement Squad"—though daily catching thieves—were not professionals. Ming commoners all looked similar to them; language barriers compounded the problems—basically futile. Occasionally catching someone, the prisoner would kneel and gabble in incomprehensible dialect, sometimes wailing and rolling on the ground—eventually they had to be released. Then came brawl incidents from gambling disputes.

Soon, the first bloodshed alarmed the transmigrators: the market witnessed scenes they knew well—street fights.

Seventeenth-century gang fights were not different from twenty-first-century ones—just more dangerous looking. No watermelon knives, but fire-hardened bamboo spears, sharpened wooden clubs, and naturally bricks. Instantly, the bustling market became chaos—people fleeing, chickens squawking, dogs running—wails rising. Soon, a bamboo shed cluster near East Gate Street caught fire. By the time Dugu Qiuhun's enforcement squad had donned full equipment and Military Group reinforcements arrived—the crowds had scattered. Seven corpses remained—plus devastation: over ten stalls burned.

Dugu Qiuhun's mouth twisted with fury. Other arriving Committee members were also shocked. Since opening, East Gate Market had been all positive news: increasing peddlers, growing customers, people buying lots... In short, this had been the best example of transmigrator-native harmony.

Now this example looked like this—the damage was not severe, but market brawls with fatalities definitely damaged their reputation. Most embarrassing: after half a day's investigation, Dugu Qiuhun could not identify the perpetrators—could not even determine cause and effect. Helplessly, he approached the Committee—requesting police training.

"This enforcement squad isn't working!" Dugu Qiuhun finally recognized the key problem. "We can't communicate with locals—can't understand ground-level situations."

"Can the Security Group assign people for patrol?" Xiao Zishan was not enthusiastic about training local police—he felt locals could not yet be trusted.

"Security Group can't spare anyone for us." Dugu Qiuhun knew well—he had visited several times. Seven or eight people were overwhelmed with prisoner interrogation, personnel vetting, and file organizing. No time for patrol assistance—plus, they would face identical language barriers.

"We really can't spare anyone. The Security Group is basically internal security now." Ran Yao said helplessly. "Training police—I think it's entirely feasible. With larger controlled populations—we need law enforcement institutions for social order."

The transmigrators' first police institution—"East Gate Market Police Station"—was thus established. Dugu Qiuhun served as station chief. Mu Min became station instructor—meaning: instructing station operations. She had done security work; East Gate's main problem was security.

The station reported to the Security Group for oversight; funding came from site management—i.e., East Gate Industrial-Commercial Bureau.

"But I have no money!" Dugu Qiuhun pleaded to civil-affairs-responsible Xiao Zishan. "The station even uses our Industrial-Commercial Bureau offices. East Gate Market doesn't collect taxes—we can't fund expenses!"

"Then collect some security fees. Current police stations also charge businesses."

"How can that work? That's arbitrary fee collection! Besides, we're in the key phase of attracting investment—"

"Heh, stop crying poor." Xiao Zishan snorted. "What about your Industrial-Commercial Bureau's land sales income? You didn't give those shop lots away for free."

Dugu Qiuhun was momentarily speechless. The Industrial-Commercial Bureau's slush fund indeed had over one hundred taels from lot rentals. The Committee had not issued land policy, so transactions used "land-lease" terminology—prices were low. These funds should theoretically be remitted—but unclear policies meant the Financial Department could not book it. The money stayed at the East Gate Industrial-Commercial Bureau.

"But that's embezzling public funds. Besides, without land policy, spending money can't be properly reimbursed."

Cheng Dong thought for a moment: "How about this—your Industrial-Commercial Bureau first fills out a deposit slip. Clearly state the income source. I'll book it as non-routine income. Then I'll fully return it as East Gate's operating expenses. You won't need to carry silver back and forth."

"Okay, that works. Let's do that." Dugu Qiuhun left happily with the problem resolved.

"You really have solutions." Xiao Zishan said.

Cheng Dong shook his head repeatedly. "Our fiscal system also needs reform."
