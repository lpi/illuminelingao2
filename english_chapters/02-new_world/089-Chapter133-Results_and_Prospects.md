"—The above is my financial report." Xiao Zishan finished presenting to the stern-faced group. Finally, he added superfluously: "I guarantee not one cent was embezzled!"

"Whether your finances are problematic—we'll know after the Financial Department audit. Stop with the guarantees." Ma Qianzhu did not trust self-proclaimed oaths. If nobody was currently embezzling, it was only because embezzlement was currently unnecessary.

"Now I'll discuss the various departments' progress, requests, and problems." Ma Qianzhu retrieved his notebook.

**As of today, November 10, 1628—D+71—Transmigrators' work progress:**

**Communications:** Basically completed the Bairren Fortress-centered wireless network, with 35–40 km coverage. Established long-range radio station in Guangzhou; 15W station at Salt Field Village.

*Next plan:* Complete Bopu Port–Bairren Fortress, Damei Village–Bairren Fortress, and Salt Field Village–Bairren Fortress wired telephone installation. Establish telephone exchange at Bairren Fortress.

*Problems:* Insufficient wire and insulation materials.

Industrial and Communications departments had jointly concluded: telephone wire could be self-produced—the premise being raw materials (iron or copper wire). Insulation could use glass.

**Energy:** Completed 630 kW generation capacity—hydro: 200 kW; thermal: 420 kW (Bopu and Bairren each have one 213 kW camel-type boiler generator). Other sources: 10 kW. Completed Bopu–Bairren power distribution network. Installed wind power at Salt Field Village.

*Next plan:* Bairren Waterfall Hydroelectric Phase Two—add one 200 kW unit.

*Problems:* Construction materials and labor shortage.

**Construction:** One 16-chamber rotary kiln; one lime kiln; two combined brick-tile machines; one crude electric grinder. Maximum annual brick-tile capacity: 30 million pieces. Additionally: 1 ton/day pozzolanic cement. One vertical cement kiln, 85% complete—upon completion: 55 tons/day Portland cement.

*Problems:* Lacking coal and iron ore for cement. Cement and steel shortages prevent concrete construction.

**Transportation:** Completed Bopu–Bairren–Lingao county seat simple road.

*Next plan:* Construct Bairren Bridge; open Salt Field Village–Bairren simple road; dredge Wenlan River's Bopu–Bairren section for navigation.

Current vehicles: 12 four-wheel-drive farm trucks; 2 Beijing-212 jeeps; 4 750cc sidecar motorcycles; 10 125cc motorcycles; 200 bicycles. The Industrial Department had also reconditioned 17 captured handcarts and self-manufactured 10 two-wheeled horse carts. Additionally, there were 2 boats offloaded from the *Fengcheng*—for Wenlan River transport. However, river depth was limited (1m at low water)—lacking suitable shallow-draft vessels, water transport remained minimal.

Large construction machinery was showing severe wear—especially the hydraulics. These parts could not be repaired at current industrial levels. At present work intensity, wear parts would be exhausted within 18 months. Cars and motorcycles were in good condition—but the fuel supply outlook was concerning. Diesel reserves were plentiful; gasoline, being volatile, was nearly depleted—alternative energy was urgently needed. Lubricants were well-stocked. The Agricultural Department was developing alternatives—their target: castor oil. Four-wheeled cart manufacturing had stalled—they lacked the metal for steering and suspension leaf springs.

**Manufacturing:** Completed machine shop infrastructure and equipment installation—built on Zhan Wuya's existing shop plus additional equipment. But currently severely under-utilized—waiting for materials.

Wood/bamboo/rattan processing was thriving. Safety helmets had achieved batch production. Bopu's timber processing and woodworking had reached stable scale: one drying kiln; one dry-distillation kiln. Producing various-sized planks, furniture, wooden components—plus wood tar, tannin, and charcoal. Despite lacking jute, local flax and hemp had successfully yielded sturdy rope.

**Chemical Industry:** Controlled Lingao's main saltworks: Ma'ao Saltworks. Using traditional methods—1 ton/day salt. Near-term goal: improve and expand to 5 tons/day crude salt, 1 ton/day food salt.

One 800-ton synthetic ammonia/combined soda process system and one coal coking chemical system were being installed. These were large, complex multi-component systems with extensive piping—installation was very complicated, and progress was slow. Fortunately, the transmigrators could not yet supply coal at scale anyway. The Chemical Department had planned a crude electrolytic salt plant at Bopu—producing salt, caustic soda, and bleaching powder. They had requested Bopu generator expansion.

With synthetic ammonia not yet operational, the Chemical Group could only utilize existing materials—successfully making ammonium-sawdust explosives from stored ammonium nitrate. Currently they were concentrating on granulating the captured Gou Manor gunpowder. They were also trial-producing nitrocellulose and mercury fulminate from the finished nitric acid they had brought. Due to the danger involved—they had requested a safer, separate location for an explosives factory.

**Mining/Metallurgy:** Controlled one construction quarry. Abundantly available minerals: clay, limestone, quartz sand, and lignite.

Four small converters and supporting forging/rolling/cold-drawing equipment were installed. With sufficient pig iron supply—they could produce 10–15 tons/day crude steel. Currently only intermittently operating one 1-ton converter—raw materials consisted of captured iron cannons, weapons, iron shot, plus damaged steel tools. Fuel: charcoal—high consumption—only producing urgently needed hardware and tools. Blast furnace construction required massive quantities of iron ore, coke, and limestone—and once lit, could not be easily halted. With their unstable raw material supply—construction was postponed.

**Civilian:** One crude paper mill was operational—using rags, waste cotton, and straw—producing rough daily-use paper. Plan: recruit mainland paper masters for improvement. After acid-alkali products entered batch production—a modern paper mill would be built. This would meet not just the transmigrators' office and daily paper needs, but allow mass export to the mainland and overseas.

Operational or soon-operational: textile mill, garment factory, food factory, ceramics factory.

Temporarily non-operational due to material issues: glass factory, sugar refinery, cigarette factory. Material issues were being resolved.

...

"Overall, our industrialization is mainly blocked by three key problems: electricity, coal, and iron." Ma Qianzhu summarized. Building industrial systems—even targeting nineteenth-century levels—remained extremely difficult.

The pig iron issue: if Guangdong procurement channels opened, a stable long-term supply was achievable. Coal: the Committee had decided to quickly send people to Vietnam for coal. He suggested using barges for a one-time 1,000-ton purchase. Coal as primary chemical feedstock justified some diesel consumption.

"With sufficient coal and steel—the Industrial Department can replicate steam engines. With adequate prime movers, industrial capacity immediately rises a level." Ma Qianzhu explained. Steam engines were not efficient—but they were simple and easy to manufacture—suited to the transmigrators' current situation. Besides driving generators, they could directly power machinery. The Committee also planned to use them as future ship propulsion.

Beyond steam engines, the Industrial Department needed to mass-produce hardware and tools—demand was enormous during the construction boom—and supply could not meet demand.

Next, Wu De reported as labor department head: "Labor remains tight. As of midnight today—directly controlled human resources:

Transmigrators: 478

Bairren Production Team One: 141

Bairren Production Team Two: 605 (from former Gou Manor)

Prisoners: 153 (Gou family servants, guards, relatives)

Slaves: 176 (purchased in Guangzhou; 98 transported back)

Indirectly controlled human resources:

Salt Field Village: 200 households, approximately 800 people

Damei Village: 50 households, approximately 250 people

Population structure: native labor had many prime-aged adults, but gender ratios were skewed. Especially in production teams—Team One: male to female ratio 9:1; Team Two: 5:1. The villages were similar—only Salt Field Village had normal ratios; Damei Village had the same problem.

Reason: Lingao had large floating populations. It was a major migrant destination. Single men came for reclamation and short-term labor—mostly from Guangdong and Fujian, but investigation revealed some from as far as Jiangxi, Huguang, even Beizhili and Shandong.

Such population structure was beneficial in the short term—male prime adults were the construction mainstay. But in the long term, places lacking women meant men would not settle and establish families. Future immigration must prioritize gender balance.
