# Chapter 62: The Reconnaissance Squad

"Lingao." Beiwei murmured, holding his Russian-made infrared binoculars. The image was somewhat fuzzy, but the outlines were clear.

Beiwei had traveled extensively across China. From perfectly preserved Pingyao in Shanxi and Fenghuang in Hunan to ancient cities reduced to foundation traces, he had seen all kinds of old fortifications. But a county seat like Lingao was a first: oval-shaped, longer east-to-west than north-to-south. Figuratively speaking, it was like an olive.

The entire county seat faced south, backed against Gaoshan Ridge, facing the Wenlan River. Here the river curved from south toward the northeast, forming a bend that embraced the city walls. "Using the river as a moat"—no separate moat was needed.

By eye, the walls stood roughly seven meters high. The perimeter was short—Beiwei estimated around 1.5 kilometers. Small but well-fortified: each gate had watchtowers, apparently with cannon positions, and the walls were entirely brick-clad. The Ming Dynasty had invested heavily in urban fortification; even this remote small county was formidably defended. Beiwei recalled a trip to an ancient city site in the "Greatest Nation in the Universe" (South Korea); their so-called "city walls" of slapped-together rocks and mud were not even as high as his elementary school's fence, and their city gate looked like a railway underpass. Truly worthy of a nation that claimed to have spread civilization's sparks to the Four Ancient Civilizations before retiring to a peninsula.

*(Note: When first built in the early Ming, Lingao's walls were only one *zhang* high. During the Jiajing era, to resist *wokou*, the walls were raised to two *zhang*, watchtowers were added, and the walls were clad in brick.)*

Through infrared binoculars, he could see the walls lined with bonfires and lanterns, soldiers patrolling back and forth—apparently tight security. But even someone with no study of ancient warfare could spot major defensive weaknesses. The east and west gates sat at the "olive's" pointed ends, completely exposed with no flanking cover—attackers could concentrate on the gates without worrying about crossfire from the flanks. The south gate, facing the Wenlan River, was at the most prominent point of the "olive's" midsection.

Outside the east gate, vague structures were visible but completely dark—lifeless. Over the Wenlan River south of the south gate stretched a long multi-arch stone bridge—the Linjiang Bridge, built during the Yongle era by Vice-Magistrate Lu Sheng on the foundation of the Yuan-dynasty Taiping wooden bridge. It had nine arches.

*(Note: Also called Wenshui Bridge; repaired during the Qing, raised and widened in the 1950s, used until the late 1960s, demolished in 1970.)*

"Looks like the county already knows we're here," Li Jun said quietly.

"No talking. Stay alert." Beiwei adjusted the binoculars' focus.

At dusk, Ma Qianzhu had found Beiwei and ordered him to lead a small reconnaissance squad upriver inland, pushing straight to Lingao's walls.

"Move as fast as possible to the county walls. Monitor the town's activity," Ma Qianzhu had instructed. "Surveying along the way is not your mission."

Upon receiving orders, Beiwei immediately drafted three well-rested personnel from the Military Group and one from Communications. They selected essential equipment, prepared briefly, then departed after nightfall.

"Your mission is not combat. Focus on monitoring. Do not kill unless necessary."

Given this mission, the squad wore camouflage. Besides rifles, they brought a scoped Saiga-308, infrared binoculars, and a 2-watt radio.

Night cross-country might challenge ordinary people, but not soldiers—especially those equipped with low-light night-vision goggles. The slight difficulty was that they had no map of this timespace's Lingao. Judging position during movement was hard. So Beiwei decided to follow the river: according to the current timespace's geographic data, following the river upstream twelve kilometers reached the county seat, with landmarks like Bairren Rapids as reference. Combined with compass and map reading, even without a guide, they would not get lost.

On normal roads, twelve kilometers was a three-hour walk even for civilians. Currently pathless, seeing that the staff reconnaissance trip had shown the Wenlan's banks had no complex terrain, it would take four hours maximum.

Actually, they moved faster than expected. With night-vision in use, the squad marched along the river without rest. In three hours, they had spotted Lingao's lights.

They selected a small hill across the river—a copse of mixed trees positioned between the south and east gates, overlooking the walls across the water. It was excellent for monitoring both gates. The squad built an observation post and spread snake-repellent powder around. September nights in Lingao were already cold; dew was heavy. They erected small rain-cape shelters and began rotating watch.

"Captain, Command on the radio. They want a situation report," Li Yunxing, serving as radioman, reported.

"This is Beiwei at the radio."

"This is Ma Qianzhu. How are things?"

"Good. Recon squad reached Lingao at 21:12, lunar September 1st." Beiwei checked his watch. "Currently observing."

"Current Lingao situation?"

"On alert. Approximately twenty personnel patrolling and standing guard along the south wall from west to east."

"Continue monitoring. Report any developments immediately. Over." Ma Qianzhu ended the call, glancing at the ship's clock—9:30 PM. Over ten hours had passed since D-Day H-Hour. They had unloaded massive quantities of material and equipment; the beach base had taken shape. The current camp could resist attack by several hundred local armed forces. But reports from everywhere were not optimistic. Basic building materials were critically short; most facilities built with great labor were temporary. Many essential civilian installations could not be established.

Local contact: zero. Though Military Group perimeter guards had found extensive signs of human activity, they had not yet encountered any locals. The beacon-tower lookout spotted occasional sail traffic at sea, but Changgong Bay—Lingao fishermen's main fishing ground—had no boats at all. Clearly, the alarm had scared them off.

At the first day's summary meeting, many Committee members felt the original "turtle strategy" was too conservative. D-Day events proved that staying holed up in Bopu Port hindered base development. The current state, according to Wang Luobin, was a death spiral: no building materials → cannot build production base → no production base → cannot produce building materials → no building materials. Breaking this cycle required rapid expansion—establishing an industrial base in a suitable location.

The recon squad's report showed locals were panicking, only closing their gates for self-defense—no attack on the transmigrators was forthcoming. This was the perfect opportunity to rapidly expand control and upgrade the base.

The meeting decided: at dawn tomorrow, dispatch a second reconnaissance squad to survey and assess nearby terrain and resources.

"We also need a team to survey and design the Bopu–Bairren Rapids highway." Wen Desi's colored pencil drew a line on the map's transparent overlay. "We will survey, design, and build simultaneously. Except for essential personnel and equipment to continue unloading, throw all labor and machinery into this project. Try to connect the two locations within three to four days. By D+5, we can begin construction at Bairren Rapids."

"Both survey teams will need Military Group protection, right?" He Ming asked. "The Military Group requests activating ten militia into active service."

Wen Desi frowned. Manpower was already stretched thin; once road-building began, labor would be even scarcer. But the Military Group was indeed overstretched—twenty-one people handling land and sea security and observation. After a full day without rest, four had been sent scouting; the others were still at towers and posts, snatching only catnaps.

"Fine, you can have the people." Wen Desi made his decision. "Two guards per survey team." He glanced at He Ming. "That's workable?"

He Ming nodded: "No problem. The organization has a labor shortage now. Military Group personnel will also participate in work when not on duty."

"You're exhausted from a full day of guarding."

"Bai Yu, Zhao De, Chen Haiyang, and I discussed adjusting the Military Group's duty schedule—everyone on guard duty must contribute two hours of labor daily. I will lead by example."

Dawn gradually lightened. D+1's morning arrived upon the First Reconnaissance Squad. Everyone wore camouflage cloaks; dew had soaked them through.

Through binoculars, Beiwei watched city-wall personnel yawning as they took down and extinguished lanterns. Torches had died, trailing wisps of blue smoke in the dawn light.

The vague structures outside the east gate visible at night proved to be temples. Open ground surrounded the city—extensive wilderness interspersed with rice paddies and scattered village clusters.

Wei Aiwen slowly crawled to Li Jun's observation position. "Li-ge, let's make a move."

"What do you want to do?"

"Storm the county seat."

"Just the five of us?" Li Jun glanced at the three sleeping under the camouflage shelter. This kid Wei was a real left-deviation adventurist.

"We've got five semi-autos. Afraid of some primitives? Rush in, spray some bullets, and they'll all run."

"Then go put on a raincoat first."

"Why?"

"Dressed like us, we would definitely be taken for demons and doused with dog blood and filth."

"..." Wei Aiwen had known it was impossible anyway. His real motive was wanting to fire his weapon. After getting the SKS, he had pestered for a Russian R14 scope, then bugged Beiwei for practice. Yesterday during guard duty, he had "dry-fired" dozens of times; now he was itching to test his marksmanship.

Their talking woke Beiwei. "Forget it. The Committee ordered reconnaissance, not combat. Reckless shooting would expose our intentions. Besides, this mission is partly reconnaissance, partly training the team. Were you not so exhausted on arrival that you collapsed and slept half the night before waking?"

"I covered half your shift, you know. You owe me," Li Jun said. "I'm over thirty—night shifts are murder on the body..."
