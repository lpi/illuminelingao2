# Chapter 134: Quarantine Station (Part 1)

The so-called Capture Protocol Manual was actually a background document compiled by Committee—just as a spy infiltrating enemy territory needs a complete new identity, transmigrators also needed this to explain their origins and purposes.

The complete materials were compiled under Yu Eshui's supervision—mainly elaborating Wen Desi's Song-dynasty-remnants-developing-Australia version from dual-trade negotiations, adding many details. Maximum consideration was given to contemporary psychology and cultural factors. Of course, even the best historian couldn't 100% grasp authentic social conditions and mentalities—so the manual had been continuously revised since D-Day. Guangzhou Forward Station personnel and self-appointed "Naval Transport Brigade" crew were first to receive trial versions.

"If during normal interactions with natives you discover issues, contact headquarters immediately. This manual will continue being revised." Xiao Zishan said. "If captured—remember the confession script and three defensive layers."

Reason for coming to Ming—three protective layers. First layer: obviously for trade. If torture threatened, could confess that Australia had civil war; they'd fled turmoil to Ming. If still disbelieved and torture continued, confess: transmigrators were the losing side in Australia's civil war.

Regarding iron ships, machinery, weapons—transmigrators' public position: brought from Australia; manufacturing knowledge unknown. Civilian commercial technology could be revealed if life-threatened.

Overall, Committee's capture policy: *Confession permitted; defection forbidden*. Under worst circumstances, captured transmigrators could confess—including the transmigration truth—though captors might not believe it. But they must not actively serve other regimes or forces using their mastered technology, information, or capabilities.

"This is rather vague. What counts as 'active'? Captured traitors would claim they were forced." Bei Wei had been silent throughout—but couldn't help commenting on capture policy.

Xiao Zishan smiled bitterly: "Capture policy is sensitive—so wording is deliberately flexible."

"I disagree with this." Bei Wei shook his head—but didn't elaborate.

"Bottom line: avoid capture. Never mind falling into Eastern Depot or Brocade Guard hands—even tossing you in a county jail for days would be unforgettable!"

*Deng Yingzhou* returned. Xiao Zishan accompanied the ship—nothing left to do in Guangzhou. Everything was handed to Guo Yi's team. Excessive personal involvement in Gao Ju dealings would hinder station development.

Purchased slaves—except sick, very young, or frail ones—were all crammed aboard. A 78-ton ship carrying nearly 100 people was quite packed. Fortunately, the voyage was only days—they'd have to endure. Comparatively, transmigrators' tolerance during the voyage was clearly lower than the people locked below deck. Everyone was sickened by the constant urine stench from the hold—remarking that slave trading really wasn't easy work. Nobody cared about pirates anymore—taking the fastest route straight to Bopu.

Before the ship arrived, the entire Medical Department mobilized for quarantine work—now officially named "Purification." This was the first large-scale population import from the mainland. Anticipating future mass immigration, Committee had built an immigrant quarantine zone at Lingao Point.

Guo Sanniang and Tian Sanwu climbed from the foul hold with the crowd—gulping fresh air. During these two days at sea, only those whose turn to empty chamber pots could climb on deck for air. Everyone else crammed in the small hold space—the smell was beyond description. Fortunately, sailors provided sufficient water and dried provisions daily. For non-seasick Guo Sanniang and Tian Sanwu, days weren't too terrible.

"Sanniang, where do you think this is—"

"No talking!" At the gangplank stood a tall, burly man—short hair, short clothes—holding a long stick.

Tian Sanwu was startled. What law forbade speaking? But having sold himself into servitude, better obey. He quickly shut up.

Slaves emerging from the hold—before understanding what was happening—were driven toward a wooden-barrier corridor. At the corridor entrance: tables on both sides; beside them, bamboo basket things resembling steamers.

"Men go left! Women go right!" A short-hair at the entrance shouted through a horn-shaped device. "You—yes, you! You're a woman—why going to the men's side!"

"My son—"

"Your son won't escape. Go right!"

Tian Sanwu and Guo Sanniang were separated at the corridor. After a year-plus of wandering, these teenagers had developed deep bonds. Now parting, Tian Sanwu felt sour. He saw Guo Sanniang's eyes also glistening with tears.

"Put all belongings on the table. No hoarding items." The speaking short-hair, seeing Tian Sanwu and the girl across exchanging longing glances, smiled: "Don't worry—you can meet later." He hung a cord-tied bamboo tag around his neck.

"Don't lose it! You'll need this for eating and retrieving luggage. You don't have any?"

Tian Sanwu shook his head. A wandering child—what luggage? His begging pot had been discarded before boarding. Others were similar—besides ragged clothes, nothing. Only a few had copper coins, combs, or tattered clothes—all tossed into numbered steamer baskets.

At the corridor's end: a large pool partitioned with wooden boards, filled with clear water.

"One by one—crawl through the pool!" A short-hair on a platform directed. Everyone exchanged confused looks. Bathing? Why crawl? Tian Sanwu crawled into the pool—water was shallow. Crawling kept his head above. But they also had to submerge their heads—crawling underwater until they couldn't hold breath. Finally climbing out—gasping.

Before catching breath, a squad of robust temporary workers—personally commanded by Shi Nianren—grabbed them like chickens, dragging them to long benches. Each bench seated ten people. Above: frames holding long wooden stocks like yamen punishment cangues. Once locked, these ten people were immobilized like slaughtered chickens on racks. Waterlogged and terrified, people panicked—what law had they broken to be pilloried before saying a word?

Temporary workers—with short-hair masters present—worked briskly, hands rough. Moments later, five rows were fully locked. Quite a spectacle. Some younger children, not knowing what would happen, burst into tears. From the other partition came girls' shrieks and sobs. Tian Sanwu thought of Guo Sanniang—was she alright?

"They're going to beat us—" the boy beside him stammered. Water drops dripped continuously from disheveled hair.

"Beat us?!" Tian Sanwu was alarmed. His buttocks had barely a few ounces of flesh—paddles would break bones.

"If they were paddling, they wouldn't have us sit. Just a figure of speech. Ah, these masters have strict rules—pillorying us upon landing."

Pillorying Tian Sanwu understood—county yamen gates always had prisoners displayed in cangues and chains. His current appearance was indeed similar. Some prisoners died from days of pillorying. He grew frightened:

"We haven't done wrong—why pillory us?"

"That's why it's called intimidation!" The boy whispered. "Right or wrong—first terrify you into submission. Then you'll obediently behave."

Tian Sanwu wondered about the women's side. Masters had paid good money for girls—probably wouldn't make them suffer too much? While thinking, the other partition erupted in piercing cries and pleas—making everyone shudder. What was happening?

The other side looked identical—just that barbers had arrived first. Barbers were selected from relocated villagers—sturdy women given brief haircutting training: shave heads bald. They'd practiced on local pumpkins, watermelons, and laborers. Two per team: one held heads; one first snipped bulk hair with scissors, then razor-shaved down to blue scalps. After each person, razors were dropped into small crocks worn at necks—filled with high-proof baijiu, rotating three razors. The women, having never witnessed such scenes—were masters making them nuns?—panicked. Crying started somewhere; immediately spread everywhere.
