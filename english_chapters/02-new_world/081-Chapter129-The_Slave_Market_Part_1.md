# Chapter 129: The Slave Market (Part 1)

Among them, besides Xiao Zishan, none had engaged in time-travel commerce before. Witnessing this so-called "Crystal Dawn Jade mirror"—obviously nothing but a plastic-framed Wenzhou egg mirror of the type sold in heaps at wholesale markets, with even the best quality costing perhaps ten yuan apiece—fetching 150 *liang* here was genuinely shocking.

Guo Yi and the others, seeing so much silver exchanged for a glass mirror for the first time, stood speechless, shaking their heads and temporarily unable to process it. Xiao Zishan spoke quietly. "Well? Feeling more confident now? Guangzhou isn't like other regions—it's this timeline's wealthiest city in all of East Asia."

Yan Maoda nodded, sighing endlessly. "I never imagined Guangzhou would be so prosperous in this era. I'm entirely confident about opening a jewelry company here now."

A shop clerk approached to solicit their business. Yan Maoda, wanting to gauge the market, asked to see pearls—the transmigrators had brought large quantities of freshwater cultured pearls from that other timeline. The clerk retrieved several trays from the cabinet. The largest specimens measured nearly an inch in diameter; the smallest resembled pomegranate seeds. Most were quite round; some were elongated ovals. Even in the limited indoor light, the pearl luster was impressive.

The small ones were priced at ten to twenty *liang* each. The largest carried an asking price of 4,000 *liang*. Yan Maoda, having studied pearl history during his jewelry trade career, knew that historical dynasties placed enormous value on pearls. These were natural pearls—exceedingly precious. But one large pearl selling for 4,000 *liang* still astonished him.

Most remarkable was a tray of slightly elongated purple pearls. Yan Maoda examined them closely. The clerk explained that these were of Western origin, a rare color; at this size, they cost 200 *liang* each.

Exiting the shop, they walked into a nearby alley where there were fewer people. Yan Maoda spoke. "Just selling our hundred kilograms of freshwater pearls would yield enormous profits."

"But they don't look quite as nice," Lu Rong observed.

"Pearl color indeed isn't as fine," Yan Maoda acknowledged. "But that's not a serious obstacle. The problem is that tray of purple pearls. Those are Australian seawater pearls. I never expected Guangzhou would have them."

"They were probably harvested from there? Sailing from Southeast Asia to Australia isn't terribly difficult."

"Probably. This means someone has already reached Australia—or at least its offshore islands."

"Developing Australia might actually be worth considering..."

Chatting and laughing, they continued sightseeing along the way. Lu Rong developed strong interest in the street food but feared falling ill, so he restrained himself, mouth watering. Ahead, the street scenes grew desolate—occasional patches of wasteland appeared, yet voices could still be heard. Liu Gang halted. "Ahead lies a slave market. Nothing worth seeing there—just scenes of families being torn apart. Very tragic. Gentlemen, let us walk elsewhere."

Xiao Zishan hesitated. Before departing for Guangzhou, the Committee had privately discussed purchasing people. Lingao's local labor supply was limited, and they needed external migration. But the immediate issue wasn't labor—rather, it was the gradually surfacing "physiological needs" of many transmigrators.

These physiological needs—food and sex—represented human nature. For a long time after D-Day, everyone had worked exhausting hours, nervously guarding against possible attacks, leaving them physically and mentally drained. Naturally, no one had raised this issue. Recently, however, situations had stabilized. Leisure time increased, but entertainment remained scarce. Over five hundred people—mostly young men in their prime—inevitably harbored sexual thoughts. The problem was that only about a dozen had wives or girlfriends. Most relied on watching adult videos for relief—a practice that added fuel to fire rather than providing genuine release. Despite generally positive developments, some disharmonious incidents had occurred: voyeurism during women's bathing, secret upskirt photography—repeatedly. Most seriously, someone had attempted the nighttime rape of Salina—though the perpetrators had badly underestimated this formidable ATF agent's capabilities. Salina emerged only slightly shaken and entirely unharmed; of the three would-be attackers, she sent one to the hospital.

Ran Yao quickly identified the perpetrators. For stability's sake, the matter was suppressed. The three offenders were dispatched far away to Bopu Camp to prevent encounters with Salina that might spark further conflict.

The incident was resolved, but the Committee recognized the dangerous warning signs. The camp contained multiple women, but very few were single. In other words, the transmigrator group couldn't internally satisfy its members' needs for male-female interaction. If future rape incidents occurred—or if adultery problems arose—the Committee would face not just a crying woman but also an enraged cuckolded husband. How would they handle such situations? What would be the consequences? It was unimaginable.

If the perpetrators possessed slightly more awareness—like those three, who at least understood their comrades' wives were off-limits—and instead turned to raping village women, what then? Rape was what commoners hated most. From the Red Army through the PLA eras, rapists had been executed. Would the transmigrators also execute rapists? That seemed to violate the Committee's unspoken principle that "all people are equal, but some are more equal than others."

Even setting rape aside—what about visiting prostitutes? Never mind whether Lingao even had brothels; contracting STDs would be extremely troublesome. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were precisely when syphilis was massively entering coastal China. If someone was unlucky enough to be "hit," the Medical Group would waste precious penicillin on treatment.

In short, failing to address physiological problems meant harboring major hidden dangers.

Some had proposed solutions. Xiao Zishan had suggested prioritizing recreational facilities—nightly movies, sports competitions, and the like. But this was merely palliative, with limited effect. Others had proposed bolder measures: establish a brothel with strict hygiene protocols to prevent STD transmission. The Committee would issue monthly "pleasure vouchers," and beyond that allowance, it would be self-funded.

This proposal was the most efficient, but most Committee members couldn't accept it. Brothels were backward, cruel institutions. How could twenty-first-century civilized people establish one! As for distributing prostitution vouchers—unthinkable. *(Note: Apparently several German cities have recently issued free prostitution vouchers. Rather awkward. German citizens are quite fortunate.)*

After secret deliberations and consultations, the Committee reached a decision: act quickly and purchase women from the mainland. Under the designation of "female servant," they would be assigned to single men. Nominally, these women were for housework; practically, the men could do whatever they wished.

This proposal also faced opposition. Xiao Zishan had objected based on simple logistics: he managed internal affairs. If pseudo-wife distribution was adopted, the current collective dormitory system would collapse—men with "servants" would certainly refuse to share rooms any longer. This meant expanded housing construction.

After multiple nights of discussion, debate, and hearings, the "female servant" plan was finally approved. Thus, Xiao Zishan's Guangzhou trip gained another task: buying women.

It sounded titillating—but it was by no means easy. Human trafficking required professional slave dealers. But their merchandise was expensive. He had consulted Gao Ju and learned that an ordinary-looking twelve or thirteen-year-old girl cost seven to eight *liang* minimum. Pretty and clever ones ran at least twenty *liang*. Higher-quality ones—like Yangzhou's famous "thin horses"—had no ceiling; seventy to eighty *liang* was the floor, and prices sometimes reached hundreds.

Moreover, slave dealers controlled the supply. Famine refugees or destitute girls selling themselves—nine out of ten fell into their hands. Outsiders couldn't easily intervene, short of massive famine driving refugee floods.

Now, hearing Liu Gang mention a slave market ahead, he thought it worth investigating. Even if no suitable women were available, purchasing children would help. Wu Nanhai had specifically emphasized that cultivating the transmigrators' own talent must begin with children. Only thorough worldview reformation—instilling entirely new knowledge and concepts—would truly work.

"Let's take a look. I'm interested in purchasing some household servants," Xiao Zishan said, striding forward.

Of course, this wasn't a professional marketplace—merely wasteland cluttered with refugees from various regions. There was a ruined temple and even some overgrown graves. Makeshift shelters had been thrown up everywhere. Refugees from Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian sat or lay about, ghostly and blank-faced. Some could still shuffle with begging sticks. Some cooked salvaged food scraps, producing the stench of rotten soup. The air hung smoky and fetid—strange odors neither moldy nor burnt. Against the collapsed temple wall lay a row of rigid corpses covered with tattered mats; only pairs of cracked, dried feet protruded. Ashes of burned paper money remained nearby... Three to four months ago, such scenes would have shocked them. Now they had grown accustomed to this timeline's everyday presence of death.

The grounds were patrolled by local militia maintaining order, and a gruel-dispensing shelter operated—some evidence of local government relief. However, well-dressed figures came and went throughout—all present to purchase people.
