# Chapter 124: Guangzhou Trip (Part 4)

The future blueprint Xiao Zishan sketched for the Qiwei Escort Bureau was essentially to restructure it into an armed freight company. Late-Ming social order was already crumbling; long-distance transport without armed escorts had become impossible.

Sun Kecheng was dumbfounded. Such grand claims—businesses extending everywhere, with bureau routes following! He didn't have nearly enough martial brothers and disciples for that. Even with the ubiquitous forces of officials, bandits, and local tyrants to contend with, he couldn't possibly cultivate relationships with all three factions.

"No problem." Xiao Zishan remained unconcerned. "For now, just open one new route—Guangzhou to Haikang and Xuwen."

"Haikang, Xuwen?" Sun Kecheng appeared puzzled. Haikang was Leizhou Prefecture's seat, while Xuwen was a subordinate county. Both were remote backwaters by Guangdong standards. The main products were salt and sugar; wealthy households were scarce. The Australian merchants dealt in precious rarities—doing business in Leizhou would surely mean losing money.

"Correct." Xiao Zishan nodded. Opening this route served two purposes. First, establishing land connections between Hainan and Guangzhou: Bopu Port faced Xuwen's Denglong Point directly across the water. If sea routes were ever blocked, the transmigrators could cross from Bopu and travel overland via Leizhou to Guangzhou. Second, it would provide access to local sugar. The Leizhou Peninsula's climate and soil were ideal for sugarcane. Since the Han Dynasty, sugar mills had operated there. By the Ming Dynasty, local cultivation and sugar production were highly developed. Around 1700, annual crude sugar output would reach 10,000 tons—mostly exported. Sugar ranked among Ming-Qing China's most profitable overseas trade goods, and the transmigrators couldn't afford to ignore it. Though they currently lacked the capacity to directly control the Leizhou Peninsula, establishing purchasing stations and securing supply chains was entirely feasible.

What Xiao Zishan wanted from the Qiwei Bureau was to open branch offices in both Haikang and Xuwen within one month. Subsequently, they would establish mule-and-horse inns or cart services at key villages along the routes, forming relay-style transport lines. All funds for branch office establishment would be provided by the transmigrators. Additionally, 3,000 *liang* would go to Qiwei for recruiting personnel, cultivating local officials, and covering miscellaneous expenses.

"One month is too tight." Sun Kecheng shook his head repeatedly. "Qiwei has no routes in Leizhou—we'll need scouts to blaze trails. Front to back, this requires two to three months."

"Two months, then. This is urgent." Wu Nanhai had informed him that sugarcane harvest ran from autumn through winter. If routes could be opened in time, they could establish purchasing stations in Leizhou this season. By next spring, they would be mass-exporting white sugar. The transmigrators' export commodities would be secured.

"That's manageable." Sun Kecheng, however, didn't appear particularly enthusiastic. "Forgive my bluntness: you gentlemen come from afar. Leizhou is remote wilderness. Doing business there—please reconsider..."

Xiao Zishan found himself touched. In that other timeline, countless people had devoted their cleverness to defrauding investors—polishing others' work as their own, easily bilking billions in taxpayer money. Yet here stood this struggling bureau chief urging him to "reconsider" his investment! Human character truly varied enormously.

"No need for concern—we have our reasons." Xiao Zishan understood that without legitimate justification, these upstanding bureau people couldn't be won over with money alone. Fortunately, sugar purchasing provided a ready excuse. "Leizhou produces sugar. The Australians have desperate need for sugarcane products. One round trip doubles the capital. We intend to establish purchasing stations in Leizhou."

Sun Kecheng's expression cleared with sudden understanding. He praised their "foresight" repeatedly and readily agreed. Xiao Zishan then laid out three requirements: first, quickly recruit personnel and expand the bureau's ranks; second, help locate reliable local shop managers and clerks for opening businesses; and third, establish a regular contact system. Gao Di's martial arts training at the bureau made him ideal for this role. They agreed that Huifu Street and the Bureau would communicate every seven days, with emergencies handled the same day. Arrangements settled, Xiao Zishan handed over bank drafts from Gao Ju. The partnership was thereby sealed.

Over the following days, Xiao Zishan shuttled between the Qiwei Bureau and the Gao mansion. He required the locals' assistance for countless matters. He also witnessed firsthand Gao Ju's enormous influence as a Guangzhou merchant. Many issues required nothing more than sending a steward bearing his calling card, and it was done. More convenient than modern leaders' handwritten notes or phone calls.

Swiftly, Guo Yi and the others completed their *baojia* registration, formally establishing their legal residency. In reality, household registries and records had long since become defunct in late-Ming Guangzhou. *Baojia* functioned mainly as a security measure. As for their origins, naturally they couldn't claim Australian merchant status. They were registered as townsmen of the Gao family. With Gao family stewards intervening, the semi-official local wardens dared not delay and processed everything immediately. Xiao Zishan knew these "minor officials"—whether past or present—were the trickiest sort. At critical moments, they could poison any situation. He immediately produced a generous five-*liang* tip packet. The recipient beamed, becoming ever more deferential.

The procurement delegation members—except for a few who stayed to guard the ship—moved into the Huifu Street mansion. After two days' rest, everyone began clamoring to go sightseeing, eager to discover what this seventeenth-century southeastern metropolis actually looked like.

Xiao Zishan knew that blocking them would only breed resentment, but letting them swarm out uncontrolled would certainly cause trouble. These people were too well-nourished, and their behavior didn't match their surroundings. He divided them into groups of five or six, each accompanied by two Qiwei escorts for safety. Every person received one *liang* of silver and 1,000 copper coins as pocket money.

Escorts, owing to their connections in both the underworld and the legitimate world, had evolved a unique guarantee system. When underworld figures who had "made friends" with bureaus entered cities for medical treatment, sightseeing, or shopping, bureaus customarily sent escorts to accompany them—providing good food, drink, and entertainment—then politely escorted them out. One condition applied: city visitors couldn't cause trouble. No crimes; not even visiting brothels or gambling houses, or the escorts wouldn't accompany them. Underworld acquaintances followed this rule. Over time, urban constables and investigators, upon seeing outlaws with escort accompaniment, customarily refrained from questioning or searching them. Xiao Zishan recognized that the transmigrators were too conspicuous. Groups roaming freely would immediately attract yamen investigators. Escort accompaniment was far more prudent.

Everyone departed in high spirits. Bei Wei took several trainees—also accompanied by escorts—but not for sightseeing. They were surveying Guangzhou's terrain, producing accurate maps of city roads, yamens, granaries, gates, and key facilities. Xiao Zishan, Guo Yi, and several others—guided by Liu Gang—browsed the streets casually, primarily investigating future commercial development possibilities.

The group changed into local clothing, exited Huifu Street, walked through several alleys, and emerged into the bustling market. Shops lined both sides of the streets, and the prosperity was remarkable. Merchants from all regions had gathered: Nanjing, Beijing, every province, even foreign countries. Goods ranged from ancient bronzes to fashionable silks, embroideries, cloth, and household items—plus Western-origin chiming clocks and various curiosities. Shops were categorized by trade, each clustering in a street section. After breakfast, every street thronged with people. By the *si* hour period—nine to eleven in the morning—the crowds became overwhelming. There were people buying, people gawking, people marveling, and people simply watching other people. They surged back and forth amid laughter and chatter. It was truly more impressive than any film or television drama could capture. Everyone stared spellbound, thinking: in less than twenty years, amid the Ming-Qing civil wars, how much of this southeastern metropolis's three centuries of accumulated wealth would go up in flames or be plundered away? How many of these living, working people would become bleached bones? Sighs arose unbidden.

The further they walked, the more crowded it became, and the busier the commerce. Everyone hardly knew where to look. Liu Gang knew the routes intimately—when passages grew too congested, he guided them through side streets. Walking along, Yan Maoda spotted a large jewelry shop beside the street and signaled his interest. Everyone was curious; they entered to browse. The Cantonese proprietor was showing a customer a mirror—that pink plastic frame instantly reminded Xiao Zishan: wasn't this the Wenzhou mirror he had bulk-purchased from wholesale markets? Now it was being sold in jewelry shops.

"This mirror must cost 150 *liang*? Can't you lower the price?"

The merchant answered with extreme deference. "Truly impossible. Even at Gao's shop, you won't find such Crystal Dawn Jade mirrors now. If you want ordinary Black Jade mirrors, those run just 100 *liang*. Frankly, even Master Gao doesn't know when more Crystal Color Jade mirrors will arrive! Such rare pink ones—in ten to fifteen days, they'll probably cost 200 *liang*."

Clearly, Gao wasn't merely retailing; he was also wholesaling. Clever: as long as Australian merchants kept supplying goods, controlling wholesale distribution covered far more territory than selling from just one shop. Per-unit profit decreased, but total sales volume surged.

The customer examined the mirror again. "Fine—I'll take it. This mirror is truly remarkable—it reflects so clearly!"
