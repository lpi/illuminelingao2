# Chapter 130: Quarantine Station (Part 1)

The so-called Capture Protocol Manual was actually a background document compiled by the Committee. Just as a spy infiltrating enemy territory needs a complete new identity, transmigrators also needed this to explain their origins and purposes.

The complete materials had been compiled under Yu Eshui's supervision—mainly an elaboration of Wen Desi's "Song dynasty remnants developing Australia" cover story from the dual-trade negotiations, with many additional details. Maximum consideration had been given to contemporary psychology and cultural factors. Of course, even the best historian could not one hundred percent recreate authentic social conditions and mentalities—so the manual had been continuously revised since D-Day. The Guangzhou Forward Station personnel and the self-appointed "Naval Transport Brigade" crew were the first to receive trial versions.

"If during normal interactions with natives you discover any issues with the materials, contact headquarters immediately. This manual will continue being revised." Xiao Zishan said. "If you are captured—remember the confession script and the three defensive layers."

The reason for coming to the Ming—three protective layers. First layer: obviously for trade. If torture was threatened, they could confess that Australia had experienced civil war; they had fled the turmoil to the Ming. If still disbelieved and torture continued, they could confess the final layer: the transmigrators were actually the losing side in Australia's civil war.

Regarding the iron ships, machinery, and weapons—the transmigrators' public position was that these had been brought from Australia; manufacturing knowledge was unknown. Civilian commercial technology could be revealed if their lives were truly threatened.

Overall, the Committee's capture policy was: *Confession permitted; defection forbidden*. Under the worst circumstances, captured transmigrators could confess—including the transmigration truth—though their captors might not believe it. But they must not actively serve other regimes or forces using their mastered technology, information, or capabilities.

"This is rather vague. What counts as 'active'? Captured traitors would all claim they were forced." Bei Wei had been silent throughout—but he could not help commenting on the capture policy.

Xiao Zishan smiled bitterly. "Capture policy is sensitive—so the wording is deliberately flexible."

"I disagree with this." Bei Wei shook his head—but did not elaborate.

"The bottom line: avoid capture. Never mind falling into Eastern Depot or Brocade Guard hands—even getting tossed in a county jail for a few days would be an experience you'd never forget!"

The *Deng Yingzhou* returned. Xiao Zishan accompanied the ship—there was nothing left for him to do in Guangzhou. Everything was handed to Guo Yi's team. Excessive personal involvement in Gao Ju dealings would only hinder the station's independent development.

The purchased slaves—except for the sick, very young, or frail—were all crammed aboard. A seventy-eight-ton ship carrying nearly a hundred people was quite packed. Fortunately, the voyage was only a matter of days—they would have to endure. Comparatively speaking, the transmigrators' tolerance during the voyage was clearly lower than that of the people locked below deck. Everyone was sickened by the constant stench of urine rising from the hold—remarking that slave trading really was not easy work. Nobody cared about pirates anymore—they simply took the fastest route straight to Bopu.

Before the ship arrived, the entire Medical Department had mobilized for quarantine work—now officially named "Purification." This was the first large-scale population import from the mainland. Anticipating future mass immigration, the Committee had constructed an immigrant quarantine zone at Lingao Point.

Guo Sanniang and Tian Sanwu climbed from the foul hold with the rest of the crowd—gulping fresh air. During those two days at sea, only those whose turn it was to empty the chamber pots had been allowed to climb on deck for air. Everyone else had crammed into the small hold space—the smell was beyond description. Fortunately, the sailors had provided sufficient water and dried provisions daily. For the non-seasick Guo Sanniang and Tian Sanwu, the days had not been too terrible.

"Sanniang, where do you think this is—"

"No talking!" At the gangplank stood a tall, burly man—short-haired, short-clothed—holding a long stick.

Tian Sanwu was startled. What law forbade speaking? But having sold himself into servitude, it was better to obey. He quickly shut his mouth.

The slaves emerging from the hold—before they could even understand what was happening—were driven toward a wooden-barrier corridor. At the corridor entrance stood tables on both sides, and beside them were bamboo basket things resembling steamers.

"Men go left! Women go right!" A short-hair at the entrance shouted through a horn-shaped device. "You—yes, you! You're a woman—why are you going to the men's side!"

"My son—"

"Your son won't escape. Go right!"

Tian Sanwu and Guo Sanniang were separated at the corridor. After a year and more of wandering together, these teenagers had developed deep bonds. Now parting, Tian Sanwu felt a sour feeling rise in his chest. He saw Guo Sanniang's eyes glistening with tears as well.

"Put all belongings on the table. No hoarding items." The speaking short-hair, seeing Tian Sanwu and the girl across the way exchanging longing glances, smiled. "Don't worry—you can meet again later." He hung a cord-tied bamboo tag around Tian Sanwu's neck.

"Don't lose it! You'll need this tag for eating and retrieving your luggage. Do you have any?"

Tian Sanwu shook his head. A wandering child—what luggage would he have? His begging pot had been discarded before boarding. The others were similar—besides ragged clothes, they had nothing. Only a few possessed copper coins, combs, or tattered spare clothes—all of which were tossed into numbered steamer baskets.

At the corridor's end was a large pool partitioned with wooden boards, filled with clear water.

"One by one—crawl through the pool!" A short-hair on a platform directed. Everyone exchanged confused looks. Bathing? Why crawl? Tian Sanwu crawled into the pool—the water was shallow. Crawling kept his head above the surface. But they were also required to submerge their heads—crawling underwater until they could no longer hold their breath. Finally climbing out—gasping.

Before he could catch his breath, a squad of robust temporary workers—personally commanded by Shi Nianren—grabbed them like chickens being caught for slaughter, dragging them to long benches. Each bench seated ten people. Above them hung frames holding long wooden stocks like yamen punishment cangues. Once locked in, these ten people were immobilized like so many fowl on slaughter racks. Waterlogged and terrified, people panicked—what law had they broken to be pilloried before saying a single word?

The temporary workers—with short-hair masters present—worked briskly, their hands rough. Moments later, five rows were fully locked. It was quite a spectacle. Some younger children, not knowing what was to come, burst into tears. From the other partition came girls' shrieks and sobs. Tian Sanwu thought of Guo Sanniang—was she alright?

"They're going to beat us—" the boy beside him stammered. Water drops dripped continuously from his disheveled hair.

"Beat us?!" Tian Sanwu was alarmed. His buttocks had barely a few ounces of flesh on them—paddle blows would break bones.

"If they were paddling, they wouldn't have us sit. I was just speaking figuratively. Ah, but these masters have strict rules—pillorying us the moment we land."

Pillorying Tian Sanwu understood—county yamen gates always had prisoners displayed in cangues and chains. His current appearance was indeed similar. Some prisoners died from days of pillorying. He grew frightened:

"We haven't done anything wrong—why pillory us?"

"That's why it's called intimidation!" The boy whispered. "Right or wrong—first terrify you into submission. Then you'll obediently behave afterward."

Tian Sanwu wondered about the women's side. The masters had paid good money for the girls—surely they would not make them suffer too much? While he was thinking, the other partition erupted in piercing cries and pleas—making everyone shudder. What was happening over there?

The other side looked identical in setup—it was just that the barbers had arrived there first. The barbers were selected from the relocated villagers—sturdy women who had been given brief haircutting training. Their task: shave heads completely bald. They had practiced on local pumpkins, watermelons, and volunteering laborers. Two per team: one held the head steady; the other first snipped the bulk of the hair with scissors, then razor-shaved down to blue scalps. After each person, the razors were dropped into small crocks worn at their necks—filled with high-proof baijiu—rotating through three razors per barber. The women, having never witnessed such scenes—were the masters making them into nuns?—panicked. Crying started somewhere; immediately it spread everywhere.
