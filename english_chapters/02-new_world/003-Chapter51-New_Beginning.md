# Chapter 51: New Beginning

"Captain, there's fire on the beacon tower!" reported Mei Wan, who was on lookout.

Beiwei looked up. A bonfire had already ignited on the tower; in the dim pre-dawn sky, a column of thick smoke rose straight into the clouds.

Though this situation had been anticipated, he still felt a pang of disappointment—it would have been better to silently neutralize the lookout post. But his proposal had been vetoed by Xi Yazhou—preparing for special operations took too much time. The transmigrators needed to begin landing quickly, establishing a foothold before word spread. The Qiongzhou Strait had been a major maritime thoroughfare and fishing ground since ancient times. Once the sun was fully up, a fleet this far ahead of its time couldn't be hidden from anyone. Taking out the beacon tower or not—the difference was only an hour or two.

"Ignore it. Continue sounding." Beiwei ordered. Getting the ships into harbor as fast as possible was what truly mattered.

Still, the crew was somewhat tense. While recording depth readings, Mei Wan quietly asked Beiwei:

"Will Ming troops come as reinforcements?" Once the beacon was lit, forces would converge from all directions—this was a common trope in movies and novels.

"They won't." Actually, Beiwei himself wasn't entirely certain. Yu Eshui had solemnly assured them that Lingao town had no garrison; the beacon served only as early warning. Though Beiwei didn't fear small Ming military units or any local force, less unnecessary bloodshed was always better.

The boat progressed, sounding depths and dropping navigation markers to chart the channel for the ships. The tide was rising; waves pushed into the river. With almost no need to paddle, the current carried them to the dock below the beacon tower. Beneath the tower were low tile-roofed buildings with a flagpole by the door—this was presumably the Bopu Patrol Office mentioned in intelligence.

The patrol office entrance was deserted. On the tall flagpole, a lantern marked "Patrol Office" still hung, not yet extinguished.

Beiwei raised his hand: "Fix bayonets! Recon squad, target: building ahead. First, second, third squads—with me!" At his command, he thumbed off the safety and was first to leap from the boat onto the dock.

Though everyone executed this assault by the book, the first Ming government office the transmigrators occupied was empty. The bed mats in the side rooms still held residual warmth; in the kitchen, a pot of water sat on the stove, fire still burning. The occupants had fled mere minutes ago.

The patrol office's job was inspection and warning—naturally there was no need to fight desperately against fierce pirates. They knew the terrain; they could simply vanish. Pirates never stayed long. They'd return after the bandits departed—the patrol office held nothing but tables, chairs, and kitchen utensils, worth little. Pirates knew there was nothing valuable here either, so they didn't even bother entering.

But this group of twenty-first-century transmigrators not only searched everywhere and examined everything with great interest—to them, these were all antiques—they also meant to stay. Buildings backing onto the beacon tower—the coastal high ground—plus a dock: this was a ready-made landing command post.

Beiwei ordered one squad up the beacon tower to search, extinguish the fire, and stand guard. Another squad took positions on the patrol office roof to cover the surroundings. He reported via walkie-talkie to the flagship: landing successful, Bopu Patrol Office occupied, no casualties.

Report complete, he summoned two squad members: "Return to the boat. Deploy smoke markers along the channel to guide the following ships into harbor."

In the *Fengcheng*'s superstructure, those who had been tensely watching the smoke column all relaxed. Bopu Port—Lingao's gateway—was open to the transmigrators.

Ma Qianzhu suppressed his excitement and said with affected calm to Meng De: "Begin!"

The order was immediately transmitted to all vessels. On every ship, the same command echoed: "Weigh anchor!"

Two fishing boats led; two brought up the rear. The *Fengcheng* and the self-propelled barge sailed abreast; the North American Branch's sailboat unfurled its white sails. The fleet churned white wake and sailed majestically toward the harbor. Behind them, a red sun burst above the horizon, painting the sky crimson. The South China Sea glittered golden. For the first time, the dawn of the New World shone upon the transmigrators. Those on deck rose involuntarily, hearts overwhelmed with emotion:

*I am witnessing history. I am also making history!*

This feeling intoxicated them. Someone began singing "Ode to the Motherland":

> *The five-starred red flag flutters in the wind,*
> *How bright the songs of victory;*
> *Singing of our dear motherland,*
> *From now on toward prosperity and strength...*

First one person, then many, then everyone. Loud and clear, the singing soared to the heavens, resounding through the New World.

"Sound the whistle!" the Executive Committee ordered as they approached the harbor.

"WHOOOOO—" The steam whistle sounded—a trumpet from another timespace's civilization, proclaiming a new era's arrival.

Though everyone was eager to set foot in the New World, for now they had to remain aboard until dock construction was complete. Professional engineers and unskilled laborers—the latter organized into five-person teams—moved in batches onto small boats and ferried ashore.

The engineers first needed to establish a port area as a staging base for pushing inland.

As a seaport, Bopu's geography wasn't ideal. Though the bay had a ten-meter-deep channel and Red Stone Island plus silted sandbars served as natural breakwaters, the shelter wasn't all-weather—the northwest was almost completely exposed. Northwest winds would create heavy swells. The transmigrators couldn't use it as a permanent base; annual typhoon-driven storm surges also made it unsuitable for settlement.

Modern Bopu Port was at the bay's southern end, where water was deepest. The engineers selected the same spot for landing and cargo staging. Normally, such a port required breakwater construction, various docks and piers, unloading machinery, and extensive warehousing. For the transmigrators, this was pure fantasy.

Using landing craft for ship-to-shore transport was possible but painfully slow. Manually building piers would take forever and require specialized equipment. So before crossing, Yan Quezhi and several engineers had agreed on the simplest method: floating docks.

Modern floating docks were mostly used for small-craft passenger embarkation, rarely for cargo. But anyone with military-history knowledge knew that the Normandy landings had used floating docks extensively (the famous "Mulberries"), enabling the Allies to land 100,000 tons of supplies and 50,000 vehicles without capturing a port. Though the floating docks suffered heavily in a subsequent storm and quickly became unusable, their effectiveness was fully proven.

The transmigrators couldn't match Normandy's scale—their floating docks didn't even have breakwaters—nor did they need such magnitude. They just needed to transfer personnel and materials ashore quickly. So the floating docks used sealed 200-liter drums arranged in rows, connected with angle iron into small units. Connection points had scrap tires hung as bumpers; corrugated steel sheets were welded on top. According to the Engineering Group's calculations, each unit could support forty tons' buoyancy—sufficient for ordinary vehicles, machinery, and materials.

The drawback of these drum-dock units was connection difficulty. Standard military pontoon bridges had specialized bolts for precise joining. These drum docks, though fitted with angle-iron frames and pre-welded connection ears, had unpredictable tolerances.

The fishing boats towed floating-dock units into the bay one after another. Without military high-powered motor boats, only the small motorboats from the *Fengcheng*—limited in power—could push and pull the units roughly into position. The *Fengcheng*'s anchorage was a full 150 meters from shore. They had enough units, but assembly proved far harder than anyone had imagined. Wave motion made bolt alignment difficult; the engineers had no experience; in the chaos, people focused on work and fell overboard. Fortunately, all wore life vests and carried whistles; the Landing Command organized strong swimmers on rowboats to patrol and rescue. The Engineering Department managed not to become the first group with casualties.

The grapnel anchors installed during pontoon construction proved decisive. Four small grapnels per unit significantly reduced pontoon pitching. By late morning, a 150-meter-long, 8-meter-wide floating pier had taken shape—though these units still occasionally showed ankle-crushing gaps in the waves, accompanied by terrifying straining sounds.

Executive Committee members watched from the *Fengcheng* as the transmigrators' first project was completed. Hearts brimming, Ma Qianzhu announced: "I propose naming this pier 'Project One'! A monument should be erected here, to be recorded forever in the crossing nation's history!"

"A monument is fine," Wen Desi replied. "But we'll need to replace this with permanent facilities before next year's typhoon season. If a typhoon carries it away, we'll lose badly—all those drums and steel!"

Ma Qianzhu was about to respond when a foreign woman popped onto the bridge, camera clicking away. Everyone was momentarily stunned—then remembered this was Ding Ding's Western girlfriend Panpan. Ding Ding followed, holding a recorder, asking Ma Qianzhu for his feelings about the landing. This restless journalist had already recruited some people who knew printing, preparing to publish the transmigrators' first newspaper. He'd even allocated shares and given his future publication an unimaginative name: *The Lingao Times*.

"No particular feelings." Ma Qianzhu wore an uncooperative expression. His heart was actually surging today—he just disliked interviews. He'd rather quietly write memoirs later than be poked with a recording device.

"Director Wen? Please share your thoughts." Ding Ding immediately pivoted. Panpan turned and snapped a burst at Wen Desi.

"A historic day," Wen Desi said.
