# Chapter 164: Drilling Troops

Life in the Military-Political School's cadet squad resembled their time in quarantine—highly regimented. They rose at 5:00 a.m. alongside the Training Battalion soldiers for morning runs. While the Training Battalion completed a five-kilometer cross-country run, the cadets circled the training grounds ten times.

Mornings were devoted to study, continuing the lessons from their quarantine days: literacy and arithmetic. Unlike in quarantine, where Salt Village "fake baldies" had taught them, now the "real baldies" provided instruction. The children quickly learned the term others used for their Australian masters: "Chiefs."

The Chiefs' classes were far more interesting than simple literacy and arithmetic. Someone taught them to read a shiny small disc studded with Arabic numerals—the same kind from their arithmetic lessons—and two constantly moving needles. According to the instructor, this device was called a "clock," used for telling time. A single glance revealed the exact hour. It was far more convenient and accurate than incense clocks, water clocks, or sundials.

"This must be a treasure—even our village's Master Huang doesn't have one! He's the county's top gentry!"

"Who is this Master Huang of yours?" The instructing Chief pursed his lips dismissively. "Even Beijing's Imperial Palace has nothing like it."

"Then it's priceless? A tribute fit for the Emperor—the Chiefs could become high officials!"

Xiao Zishan smiled helplessly. The commoners' logic reflected the simplest understanding: the best things belonged to the Emperor. Centuries of Chinese dynasties had plundered the finest possessions from their subjects for one surname's exclusive enjoyment. Anything labeled "tribute" was guaranteed to be of highest quality.

"The clock's purpose is precise time control," Xiao Zishan redirected. "Before, people only knew the approximate time from the sun's position, night watches, drum towers, or noon cannons. With clocks, you know the exact time at any moment. You know precisely how much time any task has taken."

"What's the use?" someone asked. "When I herded the landlord's cattle, I was out all day. Left at dawn, returned before dark. That's it."

"Just learn to read the clock for now. As for its uses—you'll understand naturally later."

Xiao Zishan knew that explaining this to youths from four centuries past was difficult. Except for astronomical and calendar specialists, traditional agriculture rarely required precise timekeeping. Precise timing was a requirement of modern science.

This phase was dedicated to "general education." Rather than teaching complex advanced science, the priority was to quickly adapt newcomers to the transmigrators' terminology and habits. Only barrier-free communication could enable effective command.

Afternoons were for drill—just like the recruits. The main focus was formation training. With forty days of "quarantine Mandarin" under their belts, they understood the instructors' commands. Though some were still confused about left and right, being pulled out and beaten for incomprehension was now rare.

Evenings mirrored the recruits' schedule: political education and repeated indoctrination, plus extra general knowledge classes.

Compared to regular recruits, the cadets' class load was heavier—recruits only had literacy and arithmetic in the evening or during inclement weather. Ma Qianzhu had high expectations but decided against excessive special treatment for now. He would let them be tempered in the Training Battalion's collective environment to observe who would become the future backbone of their forces.

Tian Liang struggled. He wasn't particularly bright and had received beatings in quarantine for poor grades. Now things were even harder. The final specialty exams landed him in the infantry track. The Ruan brothers' excellent grades earned them spots in the artillery track. Then one day a blue-uniformed Chief arrived. Upon learning the Ruan brothers were fishermen's sons, he reassigned them to the "Navy"—roughly equivalent to "water forces."

Afterwards, the branches diverged. The Ruan brothers now studied artillery firing tables and various shooting methods, spending every morning pushing cannons around and drilling gun operations endlessly. The most amusing part was learning to harness limbers: cannons and limbers were attached via specialized leather straps to draft horses. Small guns needed one horse; the largest needed eight. To become familiar with horses, the artillerymen periodically visited the Farm for stable duty. Afternoons were spent with slide rules, compasses, and surveying equipment.

Tian Liang practiced shouldering wooden guns, donned rattan armor for bayonet drills, rehearsed squad formation changes, dug trenches, built earthworks, and constructed walls.

Every few days, instructors led field marches, constantly training against hypothetical targets. Sometimes they practiced short-distance charges—sprinting forward and stabbing enemies upon reaching positions.

The forced marches were the most grueling. Everyone shouldered dozens of kilograms, trotting fifteen kilometers on mountain paths or paddy dikes, arriving within time limits, immediately fortifying, then splitting into opposing teams. Combat drills included simulated shooting using training rifles. These weren't just weighted sticks anymore—they were iron-weighted replicas. Everything except the firing mechanism was complete: barrels, touch holes, and bayonet mounts. Simulated shooting required full muzzle-loading procedures: bite the cartridge, load, cap—nothing skipped. Instructors criticized any non-standard movements. After shooting came bayonet and hand-to-hand combat drills. Combat continued until one side expelled the other. The losers handled bivouac construction and cooking. Sometimes training became real fighting—bloody noses, cracked skulls, and broken bones were common.

At such moments, the trainee nurses proved their value—casualties became their practice specimens. Those "Technical School" girls had all become Medical Group nursing students. Shi Niaoren planned to train some as qualified doctors, secretly teaching several clever girls a strange language: Latin.

These trainee nurses had little equipment or medication. Their regulation Red Cross medical kits—despite being the latest models from four hundred years in the future—were essentially empty. Besides alcohol, cotton, splints, suture needles, and simple Chinese medicines, there was nothing useful. All modern drugs were personally controlled by the Medical Group doctors. Fortunately, those who survived to their teenage years in this era were products of natural selection, possessing decent constitutions. Simple treatment plus rest allowed them to recover.

During one exercise, Tian Liang spotted Guo Fu. She wore the same clothing as the other nurses, but her hair was growing out, and she wore a brimless soft cap. An armband on her sleeve bore strange embroidery: a blue snake coiled around a stick—the Rod of Asclepius, the insignia worn by every nurse.

During that exercise, Tian Liang fought especially hard, hoping for a minor wound so he could see Guo Fu and chat with her. But his exceptional valor sent his opponents to the infirmary while he remained unharmed. He could only watch Guo Fu frustratedly from a distance.

Once the cadets adapted to the training, instructors added night assembly tricks. Deep sleep would be shattered by emergency assembly. Failure to assemble with full equipment within ten minutes meant a ten-lap penalty. That was manageable. The worst were the night marches. Everyone wore a white cloth strip on their back for single-file navigation in darkness.

Ancient armies rarely fought at night. First, ancient communications couldn't control nighttime marching directions, let alone combat. Second, without proper maps, even daytime navigation was problematic without guides—at night, it was impossible.

Precisely *because* ancient armies avoided night combat, the transmigrators trained for it. For the numerically inferior but training-superior New Army, night fighting effectively negated the enemy's numerical advantage.

Night training wasn't just marching. It involved squad-level tactical movement in darkness, coordinating entirely via whistles, fifes, and bugles. In necessary cases, they used signal rockets. The Red Army and Eighth Route Army had no walkie-talkies, yet they still dominated night battles.

Then came wilderness survival. Bei Wei's training curriculum originally covered everything from tropical and subtropical environments to the snowy north. But considering there would be no development in the Northeast for several years, the focus was on local areas and South China. Slide projectors proved invaluable—especially for plant and animal identification. First pictures, then field observation. Then came compass use, wilderness direction-finding, weather prediction, shelter construction, and first aid. Finally, soldiers in squad units were sent into the mountains for ten days to complete various tasks. Each person could bring one dagger, one *jin* of raw rice, and some salt. To prevent trainees from harassing civilians during wilderness training, Bei Wei's special team monitored them covertly—simultaneously training themselves.
