# Chapter 106: Military Athletics

Xi Yazhou's cadre training focused on the militia. Militia could serve as armed forces and, after thorough education, become a reserve pool for grassroots cadres—modern China's rural grassroots cadres basically came from the ranks of military veterans. This approach had proven effective.

Currently, salt-village tasks were growing heavier. Salt workers, seeing the big iron ship delivering grain and cloth plus armed newcomers, felt more secure. Scattered refugees gradually returned. People needed relief; supplies needed distribution; production needed expanding—plus guarding against troublemakers. All of this urgently required large numbers of grassroots workers.

Xi Yazhou positioned this training institute not just as a literacy class or militia camp, but as basic cadre training.

In his vision, the current militia scale was insufficient. The salt village had over 200 able-bodied men—fully capable of universal militia service—preparing sufficient cadre resources for the transmigrators' future expansion. Balancing daily labor and militia training, Xi Yazhou decided to adopt a proven militia system: a small core militia plus ordinary militia. The former would be elite, handling standing duties; the latter would supplement during mobilization.

But he knew starting directly with military methods would not work. Salt workers' thinking was simple—precisely because of that simplicity, they would be skeptical of unfamiliar things. Formation, commands, discipline—basic elements of modern armies—were foreign to them. Hasty implementation might not yield good results. Plus, they were nearly 100% illiterate. Illiterate soldiers were not a big problem in this era—but as future grassroots cadres, illiteracy was unsuitable.

Xi Yazhou's entry point was the combat skills young men found interesting. Though he was not an expert, the transmigrators included all types—skills were diverse. Xi Yazhou first thought of Bei Wei—reconnaissance-soldier background, proficient in capture and combat. Then there was Li Jun—a former armed police riot squad member, definitely skilled in riot-control techniques. Both were urgently requisitioned to Ma'ao base.

Bei Wei's combat skills, once demonstrated, stunned the salt workers. No flashy moves—clean, efficient takedowns. Tan Chengqing knew those strikes in real combat would cause internal injuries if not death. He had never seen such martial skills.

Li Jun's style was completely different—ferocious attacks, but non-lethal techniques, focused on restraint. He showed a special trick: over a dozen young men attacked him with sticks; he used only a short rod and a wicker shield, charging through them, scattering everyone, knocking down several.

These two contrasting fighting styles greatly interested the salt workers. Many immediately wanted Bei Wei as their teacher. Bei Wei and Li Jun thus became the salt-village militia's lead and deputy instructors. Every evening, dozens of able-bodied young men could be seen sparring in pairs, shouts filling the air.

As combat training deepened, Xi Yazhou proposed gradually introducing formation combat skills. To strengthen their understanding, one day he proposed a mock battle between the work team and the militia—no firearms, only cold-weapon simulation. Tan Chengqing objected that no one could match the two instructors—so Bei Wei and Li Jun could not participate. Xi Yazhou readily agreed. They set the terms: twenty versus twenty.

For safety, Bopu's wood factory shipped new products: full-body wicker-armored sparring gear. The travelers had standard training rifles. The militia either removed spear tips and wrapped the ends, or—most preferring shorter weapons—used wicker shields and wooden sticks.

Rules were simple: in a 100m × 100m area, each side had one flag-bearer. Victory came by capturing the enemy's flag or forcing two-thirds of opponents out-of-bounds.

The travelers did not adopt special formations—twenty people were too few. They used a simple two-row formation, ten per row. The militia had no formation—just a chaotic cluster.

At the signal, Tan Chengqing led the militia in a mass charge straight at the work team's front. These days they had received combat training; some found weapons cumbersome—they went unarmed, ready for a martial-arts display.

Their charge shattered against the immovable human wall. The front-row transmigrators, following commands, stepped back half a pace. When the militia closed in, a unified thrust—militia charging at the front, hit by this fierce strike, stumbled and collided, many falling chaotically. Some transmigrators were also knocked down, but gaps were quickly filled by second-row replacements. Fallen men scrambled up to take second-row positions.

Tan Chengqing, seeing that frontal assault was ineffective, led several men to flank. Second-row transmigrators immediately split, defending both wings. Another thrust blocked the flanking attempt. Xi Yazhou watched: the militia had no formation whatsoever—not even street-brawl level. Rear men pushed front men; everyone wildly swung weapons—hitting not transmigrators but their own.

The militia scrambled like headless flies. The work team, initially wavering slightly from the first charge, now steadily thrust in coordinated volleys—looking irresistible.

"Such a dense formation—one brick could crack several skulls," Bei Wei remarked.

"If salt workers had that skill, they'd have broken the formation already." Xi Yazhou studied the scene. The travelers maintained stable formation; thrusting was practiced—several months' training. Comparatively, the militia lacked formation and discipline. Tan Chengqing, in the chaos, could only lead by example for one flanking attempt. His orders were drowned in confusion. From start to finish, he had been fighting alone at the front—collecting countless thrusts and rifle-butt blows to his armor, gaining nothing.

Within five minutes, the situation had completely reversed. The previously confident militia were routed. The work team, thrusting their way forward, quickly captured the flag.

Though this victory was unsurprising to Bei Wei and Xi Yazhou, seeing this mostly-otaku team—having only trained physical fitness and formation for half a year before crossing—achieve such results gave Military Group leaders full confidence in future army effectiveness.

Of course, the transmigrators' physical advantages were also major factors. Participants were all over 170 cm, averaging 60 kg—fighting militia who averaged under 160 cm and under 50 kg—the advantages were obvious. Plus, these otaku had trained physically for months before crossing and done hard labor since D-Day—their strength and endurance had greatly improved.

This exercise enhanced the militia's respect for discipline and formation. Xi Yazhou's formation training was smoothly implemented. No one questioned the purpose of "eyes front," "about face," "left turn," "right turn," "forward march"—facts were more persuasive than theories.

Of course, formation training encountered many difficulties. The biggest problem was confusing left and right. Just teaching which hand was left and which was right exhausted Bei Wei and Li Jun. Intuitive methods like "left foot wears sandal, right foot barefoot" were tried countless times. Daily correction consumed massive time.

Military formation training shapes soldiers' distinctive bearing—establishing an imposing military image. Recruit training starts with formations because this is the necessary path from civilian to qualified soldier. Strict formation training develops good military posture and bearing. High-intensity, high-standard formation life cultivates fearlessness, self-sacrifice, and forges the qualities of an imposing, steadfast, brave, tenacious military man. It raises obedience awareness and strengthens organizational discipline.

The travelers' future enemies all possessed powerful cavalry. To defeat cavalry with infantry in face-to-face battle, armies they personally cultivated must possess the strongest combat will and the highest organization and discipline.

How to train and organize future regular armies was something they would explore and experiment with using this sixty-man militia.

Xi Yazhou, seeing formation training implemented, also started a football team. Every evening, everyone practiced. The sixty-man militia was split into six groups for round-robin matches. Every three days completed one cycle; winners received prizes. Through matches, he gradually introduced football rules from the other timespace, teaching various tactics to cultivate teamwork and discipline.

For entertainment-starved villagers, this novel sport was very attractive—it quickly became a village craze. Especially for children—within days, kids everywhere were chasing inflated pig bladders. Ball sports' competitive and confrontational nature was compelling.

When they realized that winning required physical training, without much prompting, the militia voluntarily imitated work-team members' daily long-distance runs.

However, Xi Yazhou found makeshift footballs unsatisfactory. So he introduced rugby to the militia. Compared to football, rugby had more intense contact—players frequently in direct bodily collisions—matches were thrilling. Rugby's fast pace and precise timing requirements were also intended to instill precise time concepts through competition.

The militia young men immediately loved this sport. The result: Xi Yazhou had to request Bopu wood factory to produce special rugby protective gear. Weekly Saturday-afternoon rugby matches became the salt village's regular event. The militia cleared land outside the village, leveled and compacted the ground, and even built wooden bleachers—the young men quickly discovered that many young women came to watch matches, making eyes at them. This female attention greatly increased their testosterone secretion; matches became ever more intense and heroic. Before long, a young man named Lin Fu became the salt village's male and female idol—in eleven matches, he had repeatedly scored solo tries. The concept of "sports star" thus effortlessly slipped into this timespace through the back door.

Xi Yazhou's sports initially aimed only at military training. He never imagined the future Rugby League would become world-famous as the "Salt-Field Cup."
