# Chapter 172: After-Action Review

On the village beach, inside the headquarters tent, the Baitu expedition's squad-and-above officers, NCOs, and cadets gathered. Medical team nurses poured tea. Everyone was pleased: despite minor embarrassments, the battle had followed textbook procedures perfectly. There were zero casualties.

"We must develop a habit—a post-action review after every operation. Speak freely—no taboos."

The native NCOs naturally remained silent—their sense of hierarchy was still strong. Xi Yazhou didn't force it: everything takes time.

"Bivouac and sentry arrangements satisfactory?"

"All arranged."

"This was our first large-unit combined operation. There were many problems. When the enemy cannon fired—all platoons wavered. We were lucky the enemy cannon was garbage—otherwise, if they'd hit someone, we'd have had a total collapse."

"There are no veterans—they're all newbies."

"We need more adaptation training under fire. Get them accustomed to explosions."

"The key is more combat experience—"

"Combat will come. But in the current state—there's a ninety percent chance of breaking at first contact. Running away is still better than paralysis, just waiting to die! Those 1st Company soldiers burying their faces in the dirt—really embarrassing. Were they playing ostrich?" Xi Yazhou's criticism was brutal.

Wei Aiwen's face reddened. As the 1st Company Commander—and the Demonstration Company with an excellence rate of over sixty percent—the biggest embarrassment was his company.

"On returning—I'll strictly rectify this!" Wei Aiwen's tone was low. "Those showing cowardice will be removed to logistics."

"It's their first time in combat—fear is understandable. If we remove them, how do we replace them? Retrain from scratch?"

"I also think it's unnecessary," Xi Yazhou said. "If a unit is weak, commanders should look for the reasons within themselves, not blame the soldiers!"

Wei Aiwen felt like he was sitting on pins and needles—this was turning into a struggle session. He stood up. "I'll make a deep self-criticism—"

"Forget it, Little Wei, relax." Others pulled him down.

"Skip the self-criticism. On returning—everyone submit new training plans and methods. Improve quickly. Also, you platoon commanders—don't think your men passed. The lack of embarrassment was luck—it doesn't mean you have strong troops."

Old Tiger You and others grimaced assent. Post-battle reviews weren't pleasant.

"Also, shooting. In the checkpoint battle, the volleys were very ragged. At two hundred meters, with three platoons firing, there were only a dozen hits? With Minié rifles—this score is unacceptable!"

"Soldiers don't grasp elevation sights well—many aren't accustomed—"

"Returning—emphasize sight-adjustment shooting. Otherwise, against cavalry—we're dead."

Huang Xiong marveled: these bald people's military style was truly different. Winning battles didn't mean rewards and banquets—instead, it meant nitpicking every detail. Can such leadership inspire men to fight and die?

Huang Xiong didn't deny this New Army's many shocks—especially the weapons, which were arguably peerlessly sharp. But the military philosophy and methods seemed childishly naive. Probably overseas barbarian thinking differed from Chinese thinking.

"The 12-pounder mountain howitzers exceeded expectations. Drawback: insufficient ammunition. Even for low-intensity combat, it was barely enough. Unit mechanization is low, but the establishment is at a mechanized standard. Soldiers carry artillery equipment besides their weapons and gear—it's too exhausting. Without village liaisons acting as porters, many soldiers would have straggled." Ying Yu summarized the artillery situation.

"The mechanization shortage can't be solved quickly," Wen Desi said. "Raising or buying horses won't happen overnight—Hainan isn't horse country."

"I know—Wu Nanhai can't conjure horses," Ying Yu said. "My suggestion: with few horses, expand the artillery personnel—"

"Damn—substituting men for beasts?"

"That's the idea."

The transmigrators exchanged glances. This was the most despised aspect of the old-army system—disliked a hundred times more than the Bannermen system.

"I know it's terrible—but how else do we ensure gun mobility?"

There were no alternatives. Unless we buy horses in an emergency. But Guangzhou horse purchasing was difficult—officials investigated closely, and markets had few horses.

"Adding gunners makes sense." Xi Yazhou avoided saying "substituting men for beasts." "Currently each 12-pounder has six gunners. Increasing to ten reduces the individual burden. Also adds firepower."

"Best to develop lighter, shorter weapons for artillery—easier to carry. Maybe carbines."

"But enemies might overrun artillery positions. Having only short weapons is inappropriate."

"Six gunners use short weapons; add four standard riflemen."

"This proposal works," Ying Yu agreed.

"Also—our ration standards have problems. Theoretically, it's 0.75 kilograms per day—actually many eat 1.5 kilograms. This undermines our logistic standards. Needs revision."

"A fat-and-protein-deficient diet causes this," Dongmen Chuiyu—as Agriculture's ration observer—said helplessly.

"Any feedback on the Grassland Plan rations?"

Wei Aiwen started speaking, but Xi Yazhou interrupted, calling on the distracted Tian Liang.

"Tian Liang—tell us: how's the past two days' food?"

Tian Liang hadn't expected it—he reflexively stood and saluted.

"Reporting, Chief!"

"Don't shout. Just tell us."

"Very—good." He swallowed. This was honest: eating full meals of fine grain—what dissatisfaction could he have?

"Sit. Do all the soldiers say this?" Xi Yazhou surveyed the room.

Everyone nodded. One squad leader smiled embarrassedly and stood:

"Reporting, Chief—the brothers said that if there was meat, it would be even better."

Laughter. The atmosphere lightened visibly.

"Wanting meat is good. Currently it's difficult—but when we're richer, brothers will eat meat daily!" Xi Yazhou wrote a blank check.

"Really? Chief... Xi?" The squad leader was stunned with excitement. Huang Xiong was secretly amused: trusting officers' words? Only if the sun rose from the west. Soldiers eating meat daily—where was such good fortune?

"Of course." Xi Yazhou nodded, seating him. "The soldiers probably have no complaints. What about the officers?"

"No fat!"

"Grassland-1 and -2 are good. -3 and -4 are bland. Without luncheon meat—can't eat them."

"Best make oil jars like fish sauce. Add some when cooking."

"Too few vegetables. Eating like this, we'll eventually start suffering from 'internal heat'!"

There was much food feedback—but not as intense as expected. This was because they hadn't tried Grassland-5—instant rice cakes. Dongmen Chuiyu had eaten one—the taste was horrifying.

After the meeting, the village elders were brought to the headquarters tent, kneeling, then helped up by Wen Desi.

Transmigrators needed Baitu's people and property. But forcibly relocating over five hundred people from comfortable homes to a strange place—resistance was obvious. After Wen Desi's arrival, officers agreed: more work on leadership to pacify commoners. Avoid violent incidents during transit.

The three entering elders represented the village's major surnames—two were Fujianese. One was surnamed Lin, a carpenter. Another surnamed Lu, a blacksmith. Both brought entire clans—the village's dominant power. The last was a Cantonese man surnamed Zhang—a shipwright—who came only with his wife and children.

The Lin clan built ships—but with mediocre skill, making only small boats. Shipwright Zhang was the core technician. The best-selling 400-*liao* ships—only Zhang could build them. Knowing his minority and outsider status, Zhang kept his shipbuilding secrets close—he took no apprentices. Crucial work like lofting was done personally. Others just labored; they didn't understand the principles.

The village residents—besides the Lin and Lu clans—were mostly landless farmers and craftsmen escaping Guangdong and Fujian. Real power was in Lin and Lu's hands. Shipwright Zhang's technical value gave him a voice. After touring and interrogating ordinary villagers, Wen Desi understood that most villagers were exploited. Workshops, tools, ships... all production facilities belonged to the Lin and Lu families.

Understanding this, Wen Desi planned on dismantling their power structure. Shipwright Zhang was clearly the easiest to peel away.

Wen Desi spoke reassuringly: all property would just relocate to Bopu. Private property would be protected. At Bopu, they'd continue shipbuilding under transmigrator protection and all labor would be paid. Housing and grain supply would be arranged.

They obviously didn't believe him—but belief wasn't necessary. Wen Desi just needed to reduce hostility.
