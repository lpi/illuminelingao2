# Chapter 67: Some Training

Guo Yi got a tetanus shot in the infirmary and had several stitches put in his head. Hippo had originally wanted to start an IV drip with antibiotics to prevent infection, but he realized they had no resupply of antibiotics—and Ming Dynasty bacteria had no drug resistance anyway—so he stingily gave only some pills. Guo Yi stepped outside for fresh air and saw the already-treated Xue Ziliang sitting on a rock outside the medical tent, sullenly smoking. The man had just been sent back from the dock. Salina had been transferred to the ship's infirmary—her condition was more serious. Xue Ziliang had wanted to follow but was refused. No matter how he shouted and jumped at the dock, the guard Ye Mengyan wouldn't let him aboard the launch.

"I'm her colleague! I have a right to know! I protest!"

"I also most strongly protest and deeply regret this." Ye Mengyan's acne had turned bright red. "No boarding the ship—that's the rule."

Xue Ziliang fumed for a while, then blurted: "I demand to see your superiors!"

"Leadership is busy—in a meeting discussing problems." Ye Mengyan droned. "You should return to the infirmary. I advise you not to continue down this erroneous path."

Xue Ziliang noticed the "soldier's" posture was full of openings—he couldn't even hold a rifle properly. *One move and I'd have you on the ground in three seconds!* he thought furiously. But though somewhat arrogant, he wasn't stupid. He knew that causing a scene here wouldn't get any "American friends" special treatment. Watching the launch pull further away, with nowhere else to go, he returned to the infirmary area and squatted by the wall waiting for Guo Yi—currently his only acquaintance.

"Guo, what should we do?" The ABC looked helpless. "I never expected to become an American in King Arthur's court!" *(Note: Reference to Mark Twain's work where an American goes back to medieval England and defeats knights with barbed wire, machine guns, and poison gas—possibly the ancestor of modern transmigration novels.)*

"Just accept it and move on." Though Guo Yi himself hadn't recovered from this enormous upheaval, seeing Xue Vinnie's dejected face gave him a bit of malicious pleasure. Then he felt that was inappropriate—it sounded like cursing Salina to die. After all, Salina was closer to Xue.

As for himself—while the suturing needle pierced his skin, his soul was already considering the future. As a proper civil servant, Guo Yi knew that actively aligning with the organization was essential for personal advancement at any time.

Speaking of the Crossing Company bigwigs, Guo Yi had compiled files on all of them. The head honcho was Wen Desi; there was also Wang Luobin, an industrial engineer, and Xiao Zishan—an unemployed sales manager...

These people—before, Guo Yi could make one phone call and summon them for a chat; tell them 8 o'clock and they wouldn't dare arrive at 8:01. Now, obviously, he couldn't even call them—let alone make an appointment. They were probably all Politburo Standing Committee-level figures now. *What a monkey coronation.*

After much thought, Guo Yi decided to first find Ran Yao—at least an acquaintance. And as "Security Group Leader," obviously leadership. Coming from the police system himself, that should be professionally appropriate. Not knowing how to find him, he wandered aimlessly through the camp. Sure enough, it wasn't hard—after asking a few people, his lack of an armband got him grabbed by vigilant masses and delivered straight to the Security Group, directly to Ran Yao.

The Security Group office was in a newly erected tent. These administrative tents clustered near the power station, around the distribution room outside the patrol office, inadvertently forming an administrative zone. The Security Group tent was outermost. At the entrance sat someone with a "Security" armband, a Type 54 pistol in a faux-leather-and-cardboard holster on one hip, a baton on the other, an '80 helmet and riot shield by his feet.

Ran Yao was writing something behind a desk. Seeing Guo Yi enter, he showed no surprise.

"Sit."

Guo Yi surveyed the small tent: besides some computers, there were radios charging, and several wooden ammunition crates with English labels stacked to one side.

"Why'd you come yourself?" Ran Yao handed him a card from the desk. "I was going to send someone to deliver your ID. Without documents, camp life is difficult—you can't even get food."

"Mm, thanks." The card was ordinary employee-badge style, with his photo attached. Besides personal information, there was a printed barcode: his number was "Lin-0001."

*0001*, huh... Guo Yi smiled bitterly. "Lin" probably meant "temporary." Clearly, he hadn't been fully accepted by this group he'd called "bandits" just hours ago. Though expected, he still felt deflated. He didn't know how to begin—his face hadn't been toughened enough yet.

"Since this is another timespace, and we can't go back... I still hope to work for the organization, do what I can..." Guo Yi stammered.

"Want to join the Security Group?" Ran Yao nodded.

"Yes, I think my expertise is relevant here." Guo Yi spoke more fluently now, introducing his education and work experience. The more he said, the more confident he became. Ran Yao was probably from criminal investigation; specialized state-security personnel were rare—he was unique. The 21st century needed talent most; surely the 17th century needed it even more...

"Here's the thing," Ran Yao said approvingly. "Someone like you—our Security Group would welcome warmly. However, your situation isn't for me to decide."

"I understand." Guo Yi's words held a trace of bitterness. "A department like Security surely requires testing first." He suddenly stood, saluted, and declared loudly: "I'm willing to accept any organizational examination!"

Ran Yao was startled by his action—*Is this guy traumatized?* "Sit, sit, Comrade Xiao Guo, don't get excited."

Guo Yi's face flushed. He quickly sat down. "Sorry, I just..."

"No problem, no problem." Ran Yao produced a sheet of paper. "Per the Internal Affairs Committee's orders, you're currently assigned to the Human Resources Group. Note that every morning there'll be a work order telling you your task. Now take this paper to the Planning Committee office to collect your things."

He stood, wearing a sincere smile, and patted Guo Yi's shoulder: "Comrade Xiao Guo, actually I'd love to have you here immediately, but rules are rules. Before your status is regularized, first get some training at other posts—it's all serving the revolution."

On the dirt road to Survey Point 4 toward Bairren Rapids, a Beijing 212 jeep was speeding along. Inside were Wang Luobin—the Committee member in overall charge of technical matters—and Mei Wan and Li Xiaolu from the Construction Engineering Group.

The car bounced over the rough dirt track. This wasn't even a road yet—just some passable segments the Engineering Group had temporarily marked for the Bopu–Bairren Rapids highway survey.

Since the highway survey began that morning, Wang Luobin had traveled between these survey points several times, sometimes by car, sometimes on foot. In planning, Bairren Rapids would be the transmigrators' main production and living base. The location was highly advantageous: beside the Wenlan River—Lingao's largest—convenient for industrial and domestic water supply and drainage. In modern times, this was the Bairren Rapids hydroelectric station site. If a power station could be built in the 20th century, so could one in the 17th. Building the base near a power station enabled local power use, eliminating huge costs for power lines and ongoing protection. Bairren Rapids was eight kilometers from Bopu Port and four kilometers from the Lingao County seat—all three could support each other. The three bases, aligned along the Wenlan River, facilitated control of farmland on both banks.

To develop the Bairren Rapids base, massive equipment and supplies had to be transported to the site. The Bopu–Bairren Rapids simple highway thus became a top-priority project.

The car jolted badly. Wang Luobin gazed out the window at the scenery, listening to the wind howl, deeply moved. He'd traveled the route all day. He didn't actually understand surveying or road-building, but he grasped the project's difficulty. The Construction Engineering Group concentrated all the transmigrators' surveying, planning, and construction technical personnel—each with specific expertise, able to thrive in a specialized society. But here, where generalists were needed, they struggled. Today's discussions on surveying and road design had already exposed many problems. But the transmigrators needed this road. As the full Commissioner of Industry, Communications, Energy, and Transportation, he had to coordinate this first project under his command while training this team—the Committee needed construction talent. The more he thought, the more motivated he became, jotting notes in his pocket notebook.

Wang Luobin glanced at Li Xiaolu. She'd turned up her collar, head tucked in, apparently dozing. He smiled slightly, thinking this woman seemed somewhat listless. She rarely spoke during work, but her work quality was high.

Soon the car lurched; Li Xiaolu woke.

Mei Wan, driving, slowed down; the ride stabilized. Wang Luobin asked: "Engineer Li, from your preliminary survey, how should we build this road?"

Li Xiaolu said: "The whole route isn't very difficult. There's gradient, but it's gentle—relatively flat ground. The main problem is that our maps are all modern; actual surveying shows significant discrepancies. We can't do desktop route selection."

Mei Wan interjected: "So now we're basically correcting the map before marking the route."

"Exactly," Li Xiaolu said. "If the map were accurate, I'd spend a few hours tonight on desktop route selection; tomorrow we'd do on-site selection, marking, and start construction."

Currently, her survey team had mapped only three kilometers. A professional survey team needed at least seven people; the Committee had given her twelve, but most didn't know surveying. She had to teach from scratch: how to set lines, hold ranging poles, read levels. The survey team had become a teaching team. All morning they hadn't covered 500 meters. In the afternoon, once everyone was familiar, progress finally accelerated.
