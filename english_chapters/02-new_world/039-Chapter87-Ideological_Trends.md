# Chapter 87: Ideological Trends

Wu De's other task was preventing escapes. Once outdoor labor began, someone would likely try escaping. He had to completely eliminate this—one successful escape would give others similar hopes.

So before outdoor labor started, he requested from the Committee: the Military Group guards assigned to watch prisoners must be expert marksmen, ideally with scopes and night-vision.

"Why such capable people?" He Ming was puzzled.

"If someone escapes, instant kill on detection." Wu De explained. The more crisp, ruthless, and merciless the suppression, the more effective. Once fear was sufficient, guards wouldn't even be needed.

Next, he dispersed those who'd said they'd join the pirates, placing them in various labor teams, instructing them to report directly if anyone discussed escaping.

He promised nothing and gave no benefits. Wanting trust required demonstrating the courage of selling oneself completely.

Perhaps that battle had impressed too deeply, or perhaps their previous lives differed little from now—anyway, aside from reports of a few small landlord-rich peasants complaining no one had come to ransom them and their farms had no workers, there were no unusual situations.

Fu Bu'er, wounded in the leg, didn't join the others as laborer but recuperated with other wounded in tents. Days consisted of bandage changes and meals. Food wasn't bad—rice gruel was thin but unlimited. Seeing several white-coated pirate physicians checking wounds daily, Fu Bu'er was quite impressed: *doctors have parental hearts*. His fear gradually lessened.

Originally twenty-odd wounded prisoners; some died after surgery; some healed quickly and were sent to labor teams. Fu Bu'er's laborer Ma Peng had only a sprained ankle—soon sent away. Previously, Fu Bu'er wouldn't have given this laborer a second glance; now his departure felt like a loss. Now, he had no familiar face nearby.

Days later, Ma Peng found an opportunity to visit. He was working for the pirates—he didn't call them pirates anymore but respectfully called them "Chiefs." This term was novel to Fu Bu'er. Ma Peng now logged and dug daily. Every meal had white rice gruel; every two or three days, salted fish too. Only six hours of work daily—being forced to bathe was annoying, but he'd gotten used to it. Overall, life was passable. Hearing pirates fed white rice and fish surprised Fu Bu'er: his household fed laborers year-round sweet potatoes, giving rice and salted fish only during busy seasons as reward. Though it didn't concern him, he still grieved at the pirates' extravagance.

Ma Peng told many incredible things: machines that moved by themselves, making thousands of brick blanks in moments; a smoke-belching, roaring thing the "Chiefs" forbade approaching—supposedly the source of all power, constantly fed firewood, using more fuel daily than an entire village for cooking. Also: cooking stoves on four-wheeled carts; magical saws cutting large trees at once...

He spoke excitedly; Fu Bu'er wasn't surprised—he'd seen many wonders himself these days. He had mental preparation for pirate novelties now.

"...The Chiefs say, whoever works well and wants to stay can become a 'worker.'"

"Worker? That's becoming a pirate."

"Not becoming a pir—" Ma Peng whispered, "That's not qualified enough. Called 'worker'—I don't know how to write it—anyway, three meals daily, meat every meal, one day off per month..." Ma Peng looked envious.

"What! You want to join the rebels?" Fu Bu'er watched his laborer sliding toward the rebel abyss. Ma Peng's life or death wasn't his concern—he just feared losing a worker. He quickly reminded him this was a perilous path.

"I wouldn't dare. Master's right—that's execution. But I hear some are willing. Besides, the county magistrate can't deal with them—what can commoners do?" Ma Peng, after ten-odd days working for pirates, seemed more articulate. "Either way, it's just work..."

"Ma Peng, you're harboring foolish thoughts!" Fu Bu'er scolded. "When court troops arrive, they'll all be ashes! If you attach to pirates, you'll be branded as rebels!"

Ma Peng opened his mouth, apparently unsure what to say.

Fu Bu'er seized the chance to ask about news from home. Ma Peng said he'd been working continuously—hadn't seen village people. Moreover, the pirates' worksites were many and large; he was often driven around different sites for days. He'd lost track of locations. Fu Bu'er was anxious—even for ransom extortion, shouldn't they send word? Why were the pirates silent?

Ma Peng had work waiting and hurried off. Fu Bu'er's leg had mostly healed; he could walk now. Previously, he'd dared not go outside—fearing pirates would kill him for trying to escape. Now, seeing Ma Peng moving freely, he took a stick as crutch and left the tent to look around. Barbed wire surrounded the tents on all sides. Seeing this made him shiver—during the battle, blood-covered bodies hanging on barbed wire had been too terrifying to forget.

Outside the wire stood a wooden guard tower. Below, a bored young pirate stood, rifle with bayonet slung on his back. Fu Bu'er had seen this weapon's power—firing densely like rain; one volley killed everyone nearby. Such powerful firearms—not just their militia, even regular troops would struggle. But Fu Bu'er also knew expecting regular troops to rescue them was fantasy. Ming troops wouldn't bother about commoners' lives. If they came to suppress bandits, they'd first behead hostages to falsely claim credit—he'd heard countless such stories in Guangzhou. *"Guest troops are like bandits."*

Suddenly, a strange roar came through the air—like firecrackers exploding. Then rumbling thunder. Looking toward the sound, he saw a red steel beast roaring, spewing dirty black smoke, gnawing the earth with incredible power. This scene hadn't appeared even in his worst nightmares. Fu Bu'er's face went pale; he nearly collapsed.

Watching iron plates creak, this behemoth slowly moved. Then a screech—a giant scoop suddenly rose from the earth, soil and stones cascading like a waterfall. Everything was heart-stopping.

Fu Bu'er couldn't speak with shock. Such power—what could resist it? Forget Qiongzhou Prefecture's thousand-odd troops—even mobilizing several provinces' armies for joint suppression, what could they do? With such power, building massively here—if not for permanent residence, why?

At this thought, his mind became confused. Was this fortune or disaster? He couldn't tell. He squatted on the ground, helpless and bewildered.

Wu De took the latest issue of *Prisoner Ideological Trends* draft to report to the Committee. The Committee had high expectations for these prisoners—seeing them as seeds for future regime-building. So they required weekly Monday reports on prisoner ideological states, for policy adjustment.

The Committee Building—though actually a simple prefab building, everyone habitually called it Office Building for prestige—had completely changed. Barbed wire on all sides was removed; high walls built. A wooden double-gate had guard posts. Two rows of single-story buildings flanked the office building—with bricklayers among prisoners, building old-style brick-and-wood tile houses was no problem. The courtyard was entirely paved with gray bricks; left and right, two flower beds; a Beijing 212 jeep parked there, plus scattered motorcycles and bicycles. At a glance, it looked like some county's Party Committee compound from the 1960s–70s.

Wu De didn't enter the main building but went straight to an eastern tile-roofed room. The black-on-white sign at the door read in neat art lettering: "Document Printing Office." This was where the Committee edited and printed documents and internal publications.

Internal publications had started when the Committee moved to Bairren Rapids. Though Dingding had clamored to launch the *Lingao Times*, the Committee had refused, citing timing not ripe. Instead, he was assigned internal publications. These ranged from all-transmigrator circulation to Committee-only. *Prisoner Ideological Trends* was Committee and Theory-Policy Group only—five copies per issue.

The printing room was dark—to save electricity, lights stayed off unless needed. Large room: a fast mimeograph machine; a big table from the ship, spread with stencils, steel plates, and styluses. Two computers and several Epson 24-pin printers in the corner. Paper boxes and printed documents piled against walls.

No one inside. Wu De picked up a proof from the table—looked like a small single-sheet newspaper. The masthead had two wobbly, tadpole-like brushstroke characters. Looking closely: *Lingao Express*. Below: "Written by Xi Yazhou."

Xi Yazhou's head had apparently healed—he was writing mastheads now. Wu De read. The newspaper reported extensively on "The First Counter-Encirclement Victory"—exaggerating that local authorities had mobilized a 3,000-man army, completely annihilated by Divine Army might within half a *shichen*. Though bylined "Military Commentator," the wargame-manual-like style was clearly Xi Yazhou's hand, wounded on D-Day.

Then an editorial, bylined "Special Commentator": *The reactionary Ming government will be completely eliminated by our brilliant, great Crossing Party.*

Then a theory article introducing Marxism—this "Mr. Ma" became a hermit born in the Wanli reign. Bylined: Du Wen. Though long, with many statistics, Wu De still couldn't understand what it actually said. Probably Marx himself wouldn't know either.

On the back page, another article: *Blood and Tears of Lingao Peasants*—many tragic farmer experiences. Wu De found it familiar—wasn't this excerpted from Xiao Guo's *Interrogation Summary* that he'd copied to him? Truly, all writing was plagiarism. It had added embellishments; the imagination was outrageous. The author wisely didn't sign.
