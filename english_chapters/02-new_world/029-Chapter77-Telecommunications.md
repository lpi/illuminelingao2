# Chapter 77: Telecommunications

Construction of transmigrator housing also commenced. Compared to previous infrastructure projects, this was simpler—prefab buildings were assembled like blocks—not difficult to build.

The residential zone's foundation was raised two meters—first, to protect against possible floods; second, for defensive advantage if attacked. The entire foundation's slopes were stone-faced; the surface was hardened. The prefabs used the block-layout common in new villages—all buildings uniformly oriented north-south, arranged around a central plaza in seven clusters, numbered clockwise in Arabic numerals. Clusters One through Five were male singles dormitories; Cluster Six female singles; Cluster Seven for families. Each singles unit housed four people; families got one unit each. As originally planned, interiors were fitted for comfort: electric lights, power outlets—though no furniture yet, as lumber had to prioritize infrastructure. Even so, many were delighted—for the first time in over ten days, sleeping in a real room, laptops could finally charge, evenings no longer boring...

The residential plaza had rows of drying racks installed. The row of buildings at the plaza's north end housed toilets and washrooms. Brand-new flushing toilets were unloaded from ships—not home-style seated toilets, but squatting toilets commonly called "Turkish-style"—the Committee felt fixtures not touching skin were more hygienic. Flushing water came directly from the river, stored in a simple tower behind the toilets. Bairren Fortress began dual-quality water supply from its very founding.

Washrooms and toilets shared drainage facilities. This wastewater flowed by gravity through storm drains to the downwind agricultural zone, where Wu Nanhai had built a large biogas digester. All city sewage was processed there.

The entire residential zone's perimeter was banked with a man-high low wall of earth and stone—usable for resistance if necessary. There was only one entrance, with sturdy wooden-plank gates atop steps. Beside it stood a two-story duty station of stone and cement mortar—actually a bunker, manned 24/7 by Security Group personnel.

Committee office conditions also improved. A two-story steel-frame prefab complex rose from the ground. Interior fittings were more impressive—furniture taken from the *Fengcheng*—these previously old-fashioned pieces now looked both luxurious and impressive, making many envious. The offices even had a LAN! Rumors circulated that some Committee members played networked games every night in the office building.

This put great pressure on the Communications Group, which had just received an office in the Committee building. Many came to Group Leader Li Yunxing demanding network ports in every room. Others worried there were not enough routers—with one port per room, people could not go online simultaneously. Some suggested just opening wireless service—most people's laptops had that capability anyway.

This request was ruthlessly rejected by the Committee. Ma Qianzhu instructed him to establish a communication center at Bairren Fortress as soon as possible.

The Communications Group's pre-crossing plan actually adopted the now-obsolete PHS system (known as "Little Smart" in China). In practice, this system was not ideal—often a "Hello? Hello? Damn!" situation. But as crossing communication equipment, it had simple structure and low power consumption. As for poor signal—17th-century air had no radio interference, no towering buildings or high-voltage lines.

Li Yunxing had brought a discarded local telecom PHS base station and controller, plus two laptops, decommissioned telecom servers, various communication cables, interface equipment, communication protocols, and management software—a complete communication management suite. Enough to build a wireless communication network in this timespace.

This PHS base station and controller could support over a thousand handsets within a radius of dozens of kilometers. Adding a few remote modules could extend range further—sufficient for internal base communication for a considerable period.

They also had over a thousand PHS handsets, all bulk-purchased from the same batch—for interchangeable spare parts and repairs.

He estimated the current base station's transmission power at about 50W, covering approximately 15km. To meet Committee requirements, coverage should reach 35–40km, requiring a base-station power amplifier boosting each channel to 200W. This would also significantly increase the system's fading margin. For balance, tower-top amplifiers were needed, increasing uplink signal by about 12dB. Overall estimate: the base station would use 230V/50Hz AC, requiring 7–10kW. He submitted a report to the Committee for power allocation—but with the locomobile station already providing 200kWh, this modest power should not be a problem.

The Communications Group requested Engineering Team help to erect a tower structure in the city and install array antennas. This would reduce echo noise from surrounding buildings. Of course, there were no high-rises currently, but higher was always better.

Director Wen proposed integrating all wireless resources as soon as possible—enabling radios, phones, and walkie-talkies to intercommunicate. For this reasonable request, Li Yunxing racked his brains, convened his team to research, and finally adopted a crude solution: using the air public interface protocol to provide trunking dispatch for everyone's walkie-talkies. He temporarily built a server from industrial microcontrollers, simulating walkie-talkie signals as phone signals to feed into the exchange. This required not only microcontrollers but also an additional antenna due to PHS and walkie-talkie frequency differences.

The PHS launch restored a familiar feeling for everyone. On handset distribution day, the Communications Group office was mobbed. Everyone wanted a so-called lucky number.

"I want 888888!"

"I want 168168! 'All the Way Rich'!"

"Bullshit—that is mine."

"Xiao Shao, remember? I once treated you to dinner. Save me one with 8s!"

"You people are so vulgar—just want 8s. Skinning?"

"It means 'prosper'! 'Fortune!' You do not know? Illiterate!"

"You are the illiterate—your whole family is illiterate. You are not even Cantonese—why ape them?" These two nearly came to blows.

"I want 6s—give me ones with 6!"

Someone was creative: "I want 444444."

"Then you might as well get 514514," someone joked. (Note: 514 creates a homophone for "I want to die" in Mandarin.)

Shao Zong sat behind a desk with a big box on it, shouting: "Do not crowd—one at a time! We are drawing numbers here—no choosing! Whatever you draw, that is yours. Hey hey hey—no taking one, looking, and throwing it back! No manners!"

"Hey Xiao Shao, can I get a nicer-looking one? This phone is hideous." A female voice.

"I want a flip phone. Why are these all candybars? So old-fashioned!" Women chattered—their interest was not in numbers but the pile of handsets—rummaging through them.

"Yeah, no color choices either... If I had known, I would have brought the one I left at home..." These phones were bulk-purchased—only colors differed; all same model. No wonder the women were dissatisfied.

The Communications Group struggled to maintain order. Just as chaos peaked, Guo Yi, who had been working nearby, stepped forward:

"Everyone do not crowd." Though he had not done public-security work, he was from that profession—never eaten pork but seen pigs run. Seeing this was a chance to perform, he immediately helped maintain order. One hot-tempered guy tried to shove Xiao Guo but got his joint locked until tears flowed. With such a pitiful example, the unruly crowd quickly calmed.

Number-drawing ended quickly. Besides a few lucky ones getting "8s" and "6s," most got ordinary numbers. Some believers who did not draw lucky numbers cursed resentfully, approaching the lucky ones to trade personal supplies for numbers.

"Business opportunities exist everywhere..." Shao Zong contentedly carried the desk back to the office. Just like in another timespace, the Communications Group—future Crossing Telecom Company—had already reserved so-called lucky numbers. Li Yunxing and Shao Zong calculated: once Crossing Telecom restructured, they would release these numbers to the market. *Oh boy—would that not be a fortune?*

Seeing the person who had helped maintain order leaving without a number, he hurried to catch up:

"Brother, what is your name? Why did you not get a phone?"

"Well..." Guo Yi scratched his head, a bit embarrassed. "I have a temporary ID. Cannot get a phone yet."

"Oh!" Shao Zong slapped his hand in realization. "You must be Guo Yi."

"You know me?" Xiao Guo was puzzled—he should be unknown here.

"Mm, others do not know. But our group leader brought back an internal bulletin. I have read it."

"Oh? What does it say?" Guo Yi was very concerned about his future. Internal bulletins surely represented this bold group of time-traveling adventurers' leadership's views and policies on him.

"Well..." Shao Zong thought uncomfortably. "Cannot really say—it is classified..."

*Damn—they really learned fast—mastered this game instantly.* Xiao Guo cursed internally, but his face remained utterly sincere: "No problem—just asking casually."

"I will spill a bit then." Shao Zong felt being too principled was inhuman. "The three of you—the Committee means to treat you differently. Just remember that."

*Treat differently?* What did that mean? Guo Yi fell into deep thought.
