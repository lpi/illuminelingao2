# Chapter 100: Li Minority Work (Part 3)

Per pre-planned protocols, after entering mountain terrain, everyone switched to a combat-ready stance, with advance scouts ahead. Mountains weren't precipitous. Along the way, small mountain-plots of nearly-harvest rice were visible; gentler slopes showed cultivation traces—the green forest like a patchy carpet, occasionally revealing yellow patches. This was the Li's *shanlang* cultivation—a nearly slash-and-burn primitive agriculture. Distant slopes showed scattered villages. With time to spare, they didn't hurry, walking and admiring scenery. Though autumn, Hainan's year-round summer-like climate meant flowers bloomed, vegetation flourished—exceptionally beautiful. Compared to the desolate wasteland outside the mountains, this was a different world. Atop a ridge, everyone stood gazing around. Wen Desi couldn't help praising:

"Such a wonderful place."

"Much prettier than along the Wenlan River." Everyone agreed, wiping sweat, pointing at surrounding scenery.

"What's that?" On a nearby hillside stood exceptionally tall, upright trees—striking because, amid lush greenery, they'd already shed leaves.

"That's silk-cotton." Wen Desi said. As someone living in Guangzhou, he couldn't not recognize the city's official flower.

"Silk-cotton—I know! Beautiful flowers. I saw many when visiting Panzhihua." Mu Min said.

"Haha, correct. Panzhihua city is named after silk-cotton."

"Why have these trees all shed leaves? Southern trees usually don't defoliate."

"They're naturally deciduous." Fa Shilu explained. "Their native habitats have distinct wet/dry seasons; before dry season, they shed leaves to conserve water." Though an agronomist, he'd also worked in plant protection; he knew this area.

"This tree is very useful," Fa Shilu continued, "excellent fiber source."

"Good though it is, it can't be spun into cloth."

Silk-cotton fibers, compared to herbaceous cotton, were much shorter—unsuitable as textile material. But it grew rapidly; the wood was light and soft; fibers were short and fine, hollow over 86%, not easily water-soaked, pressure-resistant, warm, naturally antibacterial, and resistant to insects and mold—useful for filling pillows and lifejackets.

Travelers had sporadically found silk-cotton trees along the Wenlan River, but this was their first time seeing such forests. If developed, there was great potential.

"Boss Wen, I'd like to collect some samples." Fa Shilu requested.

"Fa Engineer, please ask Team Leader Lu—" Wen Desi said. "I'm just a member; no command authority."

"Right, right, I keep forgetting." The agronomist smiled sheepishly. Wen Desi's Committee-Chairman title always made him forget.

"Old Fa, you say silk-cotton can't be spun—but I heard Li weaving technology was historically advanced? Even Huang Daopo learned spinning from Hainan's Li." Accompanying him for sample collection was Cui Yunhong, carrying much equipment: laptop, transient electromagnetic meter, anchor-bolt tester, ultrasonic detector... even an African-aid-version small hand-crank generator—no choice when everything needed power. While Fa collected samples, he'd do some geological survey.

"Not all silk-cotton can't be spun." Fa Shilu carefully avoided trunk thorns, pulling out measuring tape. "Some varieties can be spun—just not comparable to herbaceous cotton. Also, some so-called 'silk-cotton' is actually Sea Island cotton."

"Sea Island cotton?"

"A high-quality long-staple cotton. Native to Central and South America. Named because it was once widely distributed along America's southeastern coast and nearby islands." Fa Shilu explained. "Hainan Island has a similar long-staple cotton—very close to this American Sea Island cotton."

"I've seen cotton—short, grass-like, one annual planting. How could it resemble silk-cotton?"

"Haha, because cotton can be annual or perennial." Fa Shilu knew most people in the original timespace couldn't distinguish grains—many mistook wheat seedlings for chives; seeing actual cotton was already rare. "In natural conditions, cotton can grow into perennial woody plants. Perhaps because, like silk-cotton, its seeds have cottony fibers, it was mistakenly called 'silk-cotton.' The Li's weaving material should be this perennial woody cotton." He continued: "I've seen scattered cotton trees like this. Quite common on the island. Our department is considering how to handle the cotton issue."

"This is silk-cotton, right?"

"Regular silk-cotton." Fa Shilu was somewhat disappointed. If this were a Sea Island cotton forest, they'd have struck gold: this long-staple cotton could not only produce fine-spun fabric with silk-like texture and feel, but was also essential raw material for future tire-industry cord thread.

"It can be used for guncotton." Zhang Bailin, standing guard nearby, interjected. "Any fiber works for guncotton."

"That's not quite right—" Fa Shilu was speaking when he suddenly saw two or three people approaching in the distance—their dress clearly non-Han: Li people. He quickly gathered his things and retreated to the main group.

Two native soldiers approached, calling out from a distance. They wore cloth shirts; their lower bodies were wrapped in triangular cloth strips like loincloths—resembling Japanese fundoshi *(this was traditional Li male dress)*. At their waists were hook-knives—traditionally carried by all Li men, serving as both tool and weapon—with crossbows and arrows on their backs. Lu Rong spoke with them in Qiongzhou dialect, learning this was within a *dong*'s territory; the *dong* chief lived ahead in a place called Nanan Village *(this village is fictional)*.

While talking, the prisoners behind grew agitated. Despite the heavy salt packs, they rushed over. Both sides met—embracing, weeping—these two soldiers were from their village! Early morning, hunters had reported a strange party approaching—not many, not official troops, not individual or small-group Han peddlers. The *dong* chief, also a Ming-appointed local administrator responsible for maintaining order, had sent people to investigate.

From conversation, they learned that of the thirty Li soldiers originally sent, five had escaped back. Throughout Li territory, word spread that a powerful pirate force from the sea had formidable firearms. Han peddlers from Han areas had embellished the Bairren Rapids battle; by now, the transmigrators' terrifying reputation was widely known.

Learning these were the "pirates" with supernatural power, the two soldiers showed fear. Lu Rong quickly explained that they weren't pirates but merchants; fighting at Bairren Rapids was forced self-defense. This visit had two purposes: first, return these eight prisoners; second, trade. Lu Rong opened a salt packet—snow-white refined salt gleaming in the sunlight. Salt's power was tremendous. After licking to confirm it was real salt, both soldiers ran off at full speed.

Lu Rong ordered everyone to wait. If Public Security Group's intelligence from Li prisoners was accurate, salt's power would suffice. Still, everyone was tense—fearing revenge attacks. Twenty-plus SKS rifles could handle one or two hundred people, but conflict would be hard to manage afterward; any casualties on their side would be irreparable loss.

Shortly, ten-plus Li soldiers arrived, escorting a middle-aged man who was dressed far more elaborately than the near-naked soldiers, in what appeared to be traditional Li brocade, his head decorated with pheasant feathers—apparently a headman. Per prisoners, this was their *dong*'s *aoya* *(note: Li language for "old man"; before Liberation, common Li addressed upper-class headmen thus)*—second only to the local administrator.

This *aoya* spoke excellent Qiongzhou dialect. He approached alone to the clearing between both groups, first driving his hook-knife into the ground.

"What does that mean?" Lu Rong was somewhat nervous.

"Apparently—no hostile intent." Wen Desi recalled watching an Amazon rainforest exploration documentary where expedition members encountering forest natives also placed machetes on the ground to show friendliness. "Just do the same." *(note: this is fictional)*

So Lu Rong walked out and placed his machete on the ground. Not just he—everyone in the party was sweating—he was only fifty-plus meters from those soldiers; one crossbow bolt to an area not protected by stab-proof vest, and the arrows were tipped with *jianxuefenghou* (blood-sealing-throat) poison.

They talked for ten-plus minutes, then he returned—somewhat helplessly. "He won't let us enter the village. They'll buy the salt; prisoners he'll ransom with goods we want."

Wen Desi thought: returning empty-handed was useless. But Lu Rong was team leader; interfering in decisions seemed to violate Committee command-authority policy.

So he asked tentatively: "Try negotiating more? Offer some gifts—"

"Gifts!" Lu Rong laughed. "A year-plus of retirement—I'd forgotten standard practice." He returned, and both talked more. Shortly, Lu Rong came back beaming:

"Done. He agrees to take us near the village—but we can't enter. We can only trade outside the village. But he agrees to let us meet the *dong* chief."

This breakthrough cost one small fruit knife. The fruit knife wasn't tool-grade steel, but still a steel knife—incomparable to their crude iron hook-knives.

Apparently, commercial bribery worked everywhere.
