# Chapter 129: Ziming Tower

A good idea meant rolling wealth—and instantly, everyone's eyes went wide with greed.

"Regarding procurement—we still don't know the full extent of what Guangzhou has to offer. But as a major trade hub, the available goods must be plentiful. My thought is this: we should procure as many upgradeable primary products as possible here."

Zhang Xin's proposal was essentially the classic international trade exploitation method: purchase primary products, export finished goods. Using Guangzhou as their base, they would bulk-purchase baijiu, tobacco, pig iron, cotton cloth, raw silk, crude sugar, and timber—all semi-processed goods. These would then be processed in Lingao into high-grade industrial products for export, earning the scissors differential. This approach would be far faster and more economical than building complete agricultural and industrial systems from scratch.

"Didn't Xiao Bailang say we have Zentraedi-level technology? Since our technology far exceeds theirs, we shouldn't be focusing on low-level manufacturing." Zhang Xin continued elaborating his vision. "In my view—and this includes the current lumber yard—Lingao isn't particularly timber-rich. But Guangdong-Fujian forestry remains thriving even in the twenty-first century. Why not procure timber here? With timber, we can mass-produce paper. Days ago, Guo Yi and I checked the markets—writing paper is expensive, and bulk quantities move fast."

"There's a shipping capacity issue," Xiao Zishan pointed out. "Diesel reserves are limited—we must conserve. Shipbuilding lacks experience, and the dockyards need major infrastructure work."

Zhang Xin smiled, shaking his head. "I don't mean to say the Committee is disconnected from the masses—" Except for Guo Yi, everyone nodded in agreement. "But sometimes you're inflexible—determined to manufacture everything yourselves. Even toilet paper you tried producing yourselves. The result? You don't know that men with wives and girlfriends are using dry leaves just to conserve toilet paper for their women?"

"Such things are happening?" Xiao Zishan was taken aback. "The toilet paper supply isn't problematic." As Internal Affairs commissioner, he knew toilet paper—seemingly trivial—greatly affected quality of life. Shortages could damage morale. Pre-transmigration stockpiling and post D-Day distribution had been tightly managed—calculated daily, distributed weekly. But self-production remained incomplete.

"Commissioner Xiao—having something and having *enough* are two different things." Zhang Xin shook his head helplessly. "Men with women nearby will naturally sacrifice a bit for them." His view was simple: "Buy ships, don't build!"

"Buy ships? Guangdong sand junks?"

"I don't know what sand junks are exactly—" Zhang Xin waved his hand. "But Guangdong's timber resources are abundant, and there are many maritime merchants—shipbuilding must be well-developed here. We can order ships locally and solve our immediate needs."

Indeed, the *Deng Yingzhou's* tonnage was too small. As Qiong-Yue maritime transport scaled up, capacity expansion was imperative. Build or buy? This question, like so many others from the old timespace, had sparked internal Committee debate. The industrialists insisted on building—whether wooden, iron, or cement ships—as a way to accumulate experience and train workers. The Commercial Trade faction advocated buying—quickly expanding capacity first.

The final result had been the purchase of the *Deng Yingzhou*—the buy faction slightly prevailing. The reasoning: the industrialists also urgently needed mainland raw materials. Self-building would require months before launch, and they lacked many critical materials.

But the *Deng Yingzhou's* commissioning had not eliminated the fundamental disagreements. The build faction argued that after the initial small-boat trade phase, once industrial capacity increased, shipbuilding could begin—the *Deng Yingzhou* was merely transitional. The buy faction countered that short-term industrial focus on shipbuilding was counterproductive—buying should continue and intensify.

How to reconcile these factions gave Xiao Zishan a headache. Personally, both sides made sense—buying and building were both urgent. But how to explain this to the Committee?

Then came a sudden inspiration: "The Guangzhou Forward Station essentially equals a subsidiary. Production capital like ships—subsidiaries can self-invest."

Rather than proposing "buy don't build" at the Committee—triggering a second round of debate—he would let the Guangzhou Station solve it themselves.

"We can decide ourselves?" Guo Yi could barely believe his ears.

"Yes, you decide." Xiao Zishan graciously patted his shoulder. The Guangzhou Station was isolated on the mainland, bearing both trade and intelligence responsibilities—its affairs were too complex and numerous for the Committee to micromanage. Moreover, multiple departments were involved—remote control would mean unclear command authority.

"Also—how do we handle Gao Ju's interests?" Yan Maoda raised a concern. "Previously, he was our distributor. Now we're opening direct retail—he won't be happy about that."

"Didn't you say when discussing the jewelry house that we'd operate non-overlapping lines? Glassware—let him handle that."

"The problem is he'll probably request that the Committee let him distribute the new products too. Merchants are greedy." Guo Yi was worried.

"We stay wholesalers—let him do the retail. Retail is the hard part—it needs local merchants." Zhang Xin said.

"Segment the channels." Xiao Zishan pondered for a moment, then explained his thinking.

"Channel segmentation?!" Zhang Xin and Yan Maoda understood the concept immediately—but had doubts. Channel marketing strategies had only emerged in China during the 1990s.

"I know what you're thinking—but my channel marketing concept isn't overly complex. It's a two-track approach." He elaborated on the details.

Gao Ju, as the Australian goods agent, had already opened doors to Guangzhou's luxury market. He possessed local connections that the transmigrators lacked. So luxury goods could continue using the agency model: mainly glassware—mirrors, drinkware, tea sets. Glass had endless uses; new products could flow to him continuously.

Salt, sugar, iron products, soap, cigarettes—as mass consumption goods—were low-priced and high-volume. For these, they would use the trading house wholesale model: letting small and medium merchants and peddlers handle distribution. Additionally, they would use Guangzhou and Macau as windows for organizing large-scale exports.

"That's good—" Zhang Xin's words were interrupted by a coquettish voice from outside: "Then where's my role?"

Everyone knew without turning: Special Agent PEPI had arrived. Today she wore a blue Confucian scholar robe—lips red, teeth white—alluringly beautiful yet radiating a carefree elegance. She truly deserved her "hundred transformations" reputation.

"Weren't you assigned to run Ziming Tower?" Guo Yi was somewhat displeased. She really knew how to make dramatic entrances. He could not help teasing: "With your skills—won't you dominate the scene and drive the city mad? Intelligence gathering will be child's play."

"Ziming Tower is trivial." PEPI lightly flicked her long sleeves with a "not taking a single cloud" elegance. "Intelligence is trivial too. Creating Guangzhou's new fashion era—*that's* the real matter."

Indeed! This woman truly treated the Forward Station as her personal performance stage.

"Then go ahead and create—nobody's stopping you." Little Guo was growing annoyed.

"Ah, what can I say about you men?" Miss P's eyes rippled—making everyone's skin crawl. "Fashion requires an interconnected industry chain. Ziming Tower leads trends and builds the brand—but you need a fashion boutique for material support."

"Great idea!" Yan Maoda immediately threw his support behind her. He had already been planning to use his twenty-first-century materials and jewelry industry expertise to open a jewelry house selling new-style pieces. If Miss P's Ziming Tower succeeded, it would be a living advertisement. He spoke excitedly: "I can design complete new jewelry sets for Miss P! Mark my words—they'll sell massively!"

Guo Yi hesitated—an unexpected proposal, but feasible—the premise being Ziming Tower's success. He nodded. "I think it could work."

Xiao Zishan also agreed. Thus "Zizhen Studio" was settled. Guo Yi and Yan Maoda were raring to go—ready to deploy all their jewelry company skills.

The radio clicked again—Industrial Committee this time—requesting that Xiao Zishan recruit professional craftsmen in Guangzhou.

"Masons, carpenters, shipwrights—shipwrights?" Xiao Zishan was puzzled: were they starting a shipyard after all? "Potters, blacksmiths, coopers..."

A dozen trades were listed. Xiao Zishan thought: indeed needed. These were basic crafts, but mastering the fundamental handwork techniques was essential.

This could go through Sun Kecheng. Xiao Zishan noted the tasks in his notebook.

"The radio's become a treasure." Xiao Zishan smiled. "Lingao now has clairvoyance *and* clairaudience."

Guo Yi nodded. "Now if Guangdong plans any punitive expeditions, the Committee will know immediately. One-way transparency."

"But what about intelligence collection? How good is Ming-era secrecy?"

"Though I'm not a Ming history enthusiast—personally, I believe maintaining secrecy in a medieval environment is very difficult." Guo Yi said. "Warfare involves grain, ships, troop movements. Even in modern war, these cannot be completely concealed."

"Nevertheless—the Ming has the Brocade Guards and the Eastern Depot. Don't get complacent."

Everyone nodded gravely—those two agencies' terror echoed even four centuries later in another timespace.

"Our knowledge of these organizations' current historical status is limited," Xiao Zishan said. "But both the Brocade Guards and Eastern Depot surely have personnel in Guangzhou. Stay constantly vigilant. Avoid any actions that might arouse suspicion."

"We'll be careful."

"About the Capture Protocol Manual—has everyone memorized it?"
