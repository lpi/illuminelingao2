# Chapter 50: Port Construction (Part 3)

At last.

Dong Shiye gazed at the barren beach less than 300 meters away, the green tree clumps, the warm autumn morning sun—quite comfortable. *Damn God, I've finally reached the ancient times.* But wait—*why did I want to come to ancient times?*

The question flashed through his mind, then he was shoved forward by people behind him. The deck was chaotic and packed. There was a dock, sure—but it wasn't the Shiliupu Passenger Terminal. No comfortable covered gangway with handrails. Just vertical metal ladders and large cargo nets—as a former president of his university's military-enthusiast club, Xiao Dong naturally recalled Normandy landing photos: American GIs had climbed down these same nets to landing craft, to liberate Europe and, incidentally, pick up local girls. Looking at pictures hadn't seemed like much. Now, standing on the heaving deck and peering over the side—several stories down, faintly blue sea, floating dock and small boats bobbing—two glances and his head spun, legs trembling.

The floating dock didn't have enough area. Many people had to transfer ashore via the ship's rowboats. People climbed down the cargo nets into boats; constantly, strange-shaped packages were lowered on ropes from the deck. "Don't panic, don't panic—watch the boat!" "Stop boarding—the boat's going to sink!" The calls never stopped. Everyone felt the same: get ashore fast, carve out our own era.

Then came the first accident. A fat man passing luggage slipped, hit his head on the gunwale, and tumbled into the sea. Deck and water immediately erupted: "Xi Yazhou fell in!" "Save him!"

Amid the chaos, the PA kept blaring: "C0071, C0077, C0081... logging assignment!"

C0081? That was his group. Dong Shiye checked his armband.

"That's us." The speaker was a dark-skinned, muscular man with an entrenching tool strapped to his pack, lounging against the bulkhead. "I'm Liu Zheng..."

Names were exchanged. Assigned to the same group—comrades in a single trench.

"Logging?" Fresh work. Though Dong Shiye was an outdoor enthusiast, had read plant guides, and chopped firewood—he'd never held a proper axe.

"Never done it." Liu Zheng smiled bitterly. "Holy fucking shit! I clearly listed my specialty as wilderness exploration! Logging counts as wilderness exploration?"

"We don't even have tools!"

"Tools won't be a problem—they'll have prepared those. The thing is, logging is skilled and dangerous work! Any professional loggers here?"

The called groups nearby all wore grim expressions. Obviously not.

They'd just fished out Military Group chief Xi Yazhou and sent him to the ship's infirmary when another man-made bottleneck appeared.

Ever since that morning when Meng De—half by luck—had steered the ship into the harbor and dropped twin anchors at the deep-water berth marked by the recon team, this "half-baked" in the Committee's eyes had upgraded to "capable." He'd become Landing Commander Ma Qianzhu's chief consultant.

The entire fleet's unloading work was now under his command—he'd organized the loading and understood that cargo-ship unloading was highly technical work. A 10,000-ton general cargo ship carrying 5,000 tons, using ship or shore cranes at a well-equipped port, could unload 200–500 tons per hatch daily, emptying completely in four to six working days.

Knowing the transmigrators lacked practical experience and couldn't match professional longshoremen in strength or skill, Meng De had spared no packaging expense during loading—all miscellaneous cargo was pre-unitized into group loads.

"Group loads" commonly meant containers, but due to the *Fengcheng*'s size constraints and port-equipment issues—unloading containers at a port with no professional equipment was challenging—they'd brought few containers.

More common for cargo ships were cargo pallets, net bags, and bulk bags, grouping loose items. Though lacking containers' advantages, this greatly facilitated handling.

The *Fengcheng* had four derrick sets, eight cargo winches rated three-five-ten tons, plus one sixty-ton heavy-lift. Most cargo was no problem. Operating the winches was also skilled work. Fortunately, three months of sailor training meant they'd at least seen a pig run even if they hadn't eaten pork. They got the winches working—just with slow, clumsy movements, repeated swinging that scared the transmigrators queuing on deck. Everyone dodged the derricks, creating chaos. No matter how Du Wen exhorted "revolutionary heroism, fear neither death nor hardship" over the PA, it had no effect.

After about ten minutes of struggling, the first cargo pallet finally hung in the air and then touched down on the floating dock. Still shaken, transmigrators didn't spare applause—cheers all around.

Less than fifteen minutes after the applause, everyone on board was dumbfounded. The crane operators had only focused on dropping cargo, filling the dock space below the derricks in moments. People queuing couldn't disembark. Worse, they'd forgotten to first lower the three-ton and ten-ton Dongfanghong forklifts that were lashed to the deck. The landed pallets—each over a ton—couldn't be pushed or lifted by the workers below.

Now things got lively. Meng De ran all over the deck, sweat dripping. The Committee mentally demoted him back.

Ma Qianzhu thought fast: have the landing craft come, lower the forklifts onto the landing craft, ferry them ashore, then drive around back to the floating dock. This roundabout finally solved the cargo backup from sequencing errors.

The unloading department redesigned the route, painting directional arrows on the pier—guaranteed one vehicle coming while one left, greatly improving efficiency. This arrangement was like Chinese roads—completely disregarding pedestrian rights. No one dared compete for space with forklifts on that narrow, floating pier—especially with a dozen diesel-powered mini farm trucks for export to Vietnam running back and forth, showcasing their rugged durability and outstanding overloading capacity: bouncing on the swaying pontoon, rolling across the pebbled beach all day. Those who drove farm trucks on the beach in those days later received special permission to embroider a badge on their uniform sleeve: "Farm Truck Assault Commendation."

Dong Shiye followed the crowd, shakily climbing down the cargo net, transferring to a rowboat, and finally setting foot on solid ground. Dizzy for a moment, he followed to the registration point, checked in, deposited his pack, scanned his ID card, and received one logging axe. This thing was big and heavy; he didn't know how to hold it, so he just shouldered it like a dwarf.

The groups assigned to logging all felt lost. The issued tools were wildly varied—from two-man saws and logging axes to ship's fire axes—everything but someone who knew how to use them.

Just then, from the registration point came a burly man in black military wading boots, one hand carrying a large duffel, the other a big axe—striding over impressively.

"Brothers," he bellowed, "I'm Wu Kuangming, Timber Group leader. Everyone follow me."

After landing, the Committee had dispatched a second-wave resource-survey team of Military and forestry personnel to scout the estuary region. Conclusion: timber resources here were extremely scarce. Some tall trees grew by the coast, but for windbreak and erosion control, this natural forest shouldn't be logged. Farther upriver along the Wenlan, mature tree stands were rare. Small mixed woods were everywhere but yielded nothing usable—good only for firewood and pole shelters.

Finally, they decided to fell trees within the mangrove forests at the river mouth. The mangroves along the estuary and bay were quite dense, with complete vegetation—from shrubs to small trees to large arbors. Particularly at the estuary's edge near the beach were stands of ten-meter-plus *Bruguiera gymnorrhiza* (sea-lotus trees)—relatively easier to harvest. So the first logging site was established here.

"Relatively easier" still meant wading into semi-swampy mangrove flats. Small sandbars crisscrossed the water, covered with various mangrove species, branches tangled, emitting a moldy stench. Everyone felt slightly daunted.

Wu Kuangming had several crates of tall rubber boots brought over and ordered everyone to change.

"We're going in to log shortly. Everyone be careful." He warned, "Do NOT go deep into the forest—there are no paths. If you fall into a tidal channel and yell for help, we won't even know where you are!"

He led the team wading in and stopped by a sea-lotus tree, axe in hand, addressing everyone: "Trees are good things—anyone who's played *Age of Empires* knows that. You only play *StarCraft* and *Red Alert*? Then why are you here? Jump in the sea and swim back. When felling: swing the axe at an angle. First swing down from above, then up from below—when the tree falls, always shout a warning! While you're cutting, constantly listen for others' calls! Don't let a tree crush you—if it cracks your skull and kills you outright, fine. But if you hurt your spine and end up paralyzed, you'll earn the New World's first disability certificate. I'm going to get ropes now. Then I'll teach everyone how to drag logs."

Wu Kuangming walked to the Planning Committee office point to requisition a bundle of rope and some hooks for the forest. The Building Group was already impatiently waiting at the cutting site for fresh lumber.

"When will there be timber?" The one called Zhuo Tianmin seemed very anxious. Thirties, fair-skinned and pleasant-looking—clearly a family man supporting a household, not much like a construction foreman.

"What's the rush? We haven't even gathered enough log rollers to get the containers ashore yet. Think this is *Age of Empires*—we click a mouse, swing an axe, and get +10 wood?"

"Should be +12 wood—you just researched Rope Tech, haha..." The logging crew laughed together.

"I have +100 Wood tech." Like a magic trick, Wu Kuangming pulled a high-powered Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style chainsaw from his duffel, tugged the cord heroically—amid motor roar and blue smoke—and with a wicked grin advanced on a big tree. He swung hard.
