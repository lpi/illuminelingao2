# Chapter 116: East Gate Market

Led by Chuyu, Wu De's team quickly found the secret vault—hidden behind wall paneling. It was fitted perfectly, seamless. Even careful examination revealed nothing. Chuyu didn't know the opening mechanism. The transmigrators didn't bother looking for it. Wang Ruixiang grabbed a fire axe—hacking and chopping until a gap opened in the paneling.

Unexpectedly, opening the vault revealed the manor's master—Gou Xunyi. He'd been hiding in this study vault all along.

Behind the paneling: a staircase descending to an underground chamber containing five locked rosewood cabinets. The room also had water jars and dried provisions—enough to last ten days or more. Gou Xunyi looked better than Saddam Hussein when captured—though trembling all over, he wasn't exactly disheveled.

This Gou Xunyi struggled for composure—couldn't stop shaking, couldn't stand steady. Such local tyrants—accustomed to ruling their domain, arrogant to everyone except county officials and gentry, practically petty emperors who killed without blinking—now captured alive by enemies. Immediately deflated. He tried to speak, to plead—but words stuck in his throat.

Everyone had imagined this county-dominating, pirate-colluding tycoon as some heroic figure. Seeing him like this—contemptuous.

Wu De ordered him dragged to the mass meeting. He stayed with careful assistants, smashing open the rosewood-cabinet locks. Inside: various ledgers, contracts, receipts, plus bundles of letters tied with string. Nobody found these particularly interesting—but hidden so carefully, they must be important. This wasn't the place for sorting—take them back for experts.

The chamber also had large chests. Three contained Spanish silver dollars—blindingly white and totaling over ten thousand *liang*. Two smaller chests held gold jewelry. One item caught Wu De's attention: a plastic compact mirror—wasn't this exactly what Wen Desi had mass-sold to this era? How Landlord Gou had obtained it was unknown.

Gou the Elder's fate had long been decided. At the meeting deciding the Gou Manor attack, the Gou family was sentenced to "death." Whether to exterminate the entire clan had sparked debate—the "kill all" resolution passed narrowly, with many still uncomfortable. But now—Gou the Elder's family had mostly fled or died—just this lone target remained. No one would lose sleep.

Gou Xunyi was dragged onto the platform. The crowd below roared in fury: "Kill him! Kill him!"

Obviously, the atmosphere building had worked. Passions ran high. Xi Yazhou signaled Gou Buli. That man immediately grabbed dirt and trash—hurling it at Gou Xunyi. Following his example, countless bricks and stones rained down. The transmigrators had already moved aside.

Trussed like a dumpling, the Gou patriarch couldn't dodge. Amid chaotic clamor, Gou Xunyi—terror of the county—was stoned bloody, killed on the spot. When Zhang Xingjiao lifted the bloody pulp of a head high—dancing on stage like an Indian doing a war dance—the crowd plunged into vengeful, bloodthirsty frenzy.

Many who'd had grudges or public grievances against Gou family members were dragged up from below, beaten and kicked to death. The transmigrators stood surrounding, many feeling extremely uncomfortable.

Clever observers had already guessed the Committee's intention behind this terror-by-mob: this was the best pledge of allegiance from former Gou Manor—now Damei Village—residents. Henceforth, they had no choice but to bind themselves tightly to the transmigrators' chariot.

While this cruel farce played out, Wu De had already left the scene. He needed to discuss transport and distribution of seized goods with inventory-chief Dai Xie.

Damei Village's Gou compound would be completely demolished—salvaged bricks, tiles, and timber used as building materials. Damei Village—based on its land-carrying capacity—would keep fifty farming households. Everyone else—including craftsmen—would relocate to Bairren Fortress as directly-controlled population. Remaining villagers would have Village Committees and militias organized per salt-field model.

Dai Xie was overwhelmed. Besides items to ship to Bairren Fortress, appropriate relief supplies had to remain for local villagers. Quantities of furniture, daily goods, and clothing would be distributed to the commoners.

He discussed it with Xi Yazhou: some had suggested letting people take what they wanted, but that favored the bold and strong. The timid and weak, even if they grabbed something, would have it seized—and might even be hurt by the strong. Therefore, distribution would be organized by the Planning Committee.

Arrangements complete, Wu De led the main force and supplies out of Damei Village. Xi Yazhou stayed behind—helping establish local government. Zhang Xingjiao recommended several close allies as leaders: Ma Bangping, a small trader with some literacy; Jin Changman, formerly a Gou tenant, about forty. Both had village standing.

Gou Buli also wanted a position in the new Village Committee—but Xi Yazhou knew he was unreliable—sent him straight to the migrant column.

Transporting Gou Manor goods and relocating people lasted nearly half a month. Meanwhile, the Engineering Team built a road from Bairren Fortress to the county seat. Even the observation post on the hill outside the city—formerly a discreet lookout—was now openly formalized. They built a three-story, all-brick blockhouse on the hilltop. From the roof, high-powered binoculars could see details of the magistrate hearing cases and administering beatings in the yamen. Combined with cordless phones—almost live broadcasting.

Lingao County had now gone completely deaf and blind—ignoring massive construction across the Wenlan River. County residents had grown accustomed to these rumbling steel monsters. Though no one dared approach the construction machinery, whenever engines started, crowds always gathered at a distance.

Some wealthy gentry even had sedan chairs carry them with wives, concubines, children, and servants to small hills, where they'd erect awnings, set out rattan chairs—watching construction while sipping tea. Like watching a peep show.

For commoners, changes went beyond this. The number of farmers coming to the market outside Bairren Fortress multiplied. The transmigrators' enormous appetites attracted droves of nearby farmers.

First: a chicken, a duck, some eggs, or a load of vegetables. Then: cloth women had woven. Later: a pig.

The transmigrators were fair to all—prices slightly above market—always paying in good pre-Tianqi-reign coins. This sent everyone rushing. More and more came.

This was short-hair territory—short-hair ferocity was well-known. Neither bandits nor county officials dared cause trouble. The area was peaceful. This year's autumn harvest had been decent—some semblance of tranquility.

With growing numbers, people built stalls on the market ground—setting up stoves, selling simple vegetarian food and tea, offering overnight lodging. Sellers with money in hand wanted to buy things too. So peddlers selling cosmetics, household goods, and farm tools gathered. Then fortune tellers and letter writers.

Recently, Wu Nanhai on inspection had spotted a few painted women—even prostitutes had arrived. Wu Nanhai felt emotional—nearly teared up. Our market has finally made it!

In under a month, the once-empty plot outside the East Gate had magically sprouted a sea of bamboo shacks. By twenty-first-century standards, it couldn't compare to even a remote township market. But for the transmigrators' Commercial Department—already impressive.

At the edge of this bamboo-shack sprawl, near the East Gate moat, stood a two-story, all-brick building—conspicuously tall. This was the new Bairren Fortress East Gate Market Administration—also the Commercial Department's office.

The front had a verandah—shelter from sun and rain. The main entrance hall held a stone counter displaying three types of measuring instruments: mass standards—one-kilogram, fifty-gram, and one-gram stone weights; a one-meter ruler; and a one-liter vessel when filled with water.

Promoting new standardized measures was a key Commercial Department task. Though Qin Shi Huang had begun unifying measurements, in reality, measurements throughout Chinese history were never truly unified. Each industry, each region—though using the same names—had different actual values, sometimes widely divergent. This caused endless disputes and conflicts. Dynasties of officials and merchants had exploited these discrepancies for profit.

The Commercial Department decided to begin here—at the still-nascent East Gate Market—pushing modern standardized metric measurements. All transmigrator purchases and sales in the East Gate Market used these new standards. For transactions between locals—lacking sufficient new equipment to supply the market—there were no mandatory requirements yet.
