# Chapter 433 Batteries and Timekeeping

The Crossing Group's desire for telegraph machines was indeed immense, but Dr. Zhong correctly pointed out that the Crossing Group's leapfrog development in mechanical and chemical engineering was not yet sufficient to support the development of electrical science. The development of electrical science had a long way to go.

Currently, the Crossing Group had established an electrical application system far surpassing this space-time, including a simple power generation and distribution network, wireless radio, semi-automatic/manual telephone exchange systems, and cellular systems. But all of this was built on equipment from the 21st century.

Compared with the mechanical industry, which could now manufacture various simple machine tools, standard parts, and bearings, the Crossing Group's electrical industry was essentially a blank slate. Forget the simplest equipment—even mass-producing electrical wire had only been barely completed recently. The insulating material used a crude mixture of raw lacquer and tung oil as the basic raw materials. This material was currently barely usable for telephone lines. Zhong Lishi believed that using it for wired telegraph would probably not be too problematic. What he chose to develop was precisely wired telegraph.

Why make wired telegraph first? Dr. Zhong explained it this way: First, wired telegraph was the easiest communication equipment to manufacture using crude methods. Many people had seen simple wired telegraph equipment in *The Mysterious Island*. Dr. Zhong believed that although the manufacturing process on Mysterious Island was overly simplified, the basic concept was correct. With his abilities and the equipment he controlled, he should be able to manufacture better equipment. Manual exchange telephones might seem technically simple, but the manufacture of telephones themselves required overcoming some technical difficulties. Second, wired telegraph had a low error rate and reliable transmission. Although the radio environment in this space-time was very clean, there were always various weather-related interferences. In fact, most commercial, civilian, and military telegrams in the past had been sent via wired telegraph networks.

If Dr. Zhong had crossed over alone and naked, doing this work would be very difficult—he would have to rebuild an entire system of crude chemical industry and also rely on a metal smelting industry that, while primitive, at least existed, to manufacture wired telegraph. And manufacturing electrical instruments would be an extremely difficult task. But now he had various testing instruments and equipment brought from another space-time, and a fairly modern industrial system. Manufacturing wired telegraph wouldn't be too hard.

First, he needed to sort out the power source. The Crossing Group's power supply system was AC, which obviously didn't meet the requirements of a basic telegraph machine. Therefore, the power source problem had to be solved. This problem wasn't originally a big one—whether hand-cranked generators or lead-acid batteries, the Planning Commission's warehouse had plenty in stock. But Dr. Zhong decided to develop a power source entirely based on the Crossing Group's industrial foundation. The 21st-century inventory would run out someday.

For the battery, he decided to use the technically least difficult Daniell cell. This type of battery consisted of a copper cylinder and a porous container inside it. The copper cylinder was the positive electrode, while a zinc rod inside the porous container served as the negative electrode. Dilute sulfuric acid was poured into the porous container, and saturated copper sulfate solution was outside.

This battery was quite successful in design. It didn't have the acid mist problem common in early batteries, could work for a long time without supervision, and had stable voltage output. Additionally, the electrodes of this battery wouldn't be corroded and could be used for a long time.

The Daniell cell was the main power source for telegraph machines until 1875. Although its output voltage was only 2 volts, a ten-cell battery was sufficient to power a telegraph machine for long and stable operation. The biggest drawback was that it couldn't be recharged. After discharging, the liquid had to be refilled and maintained, causing significant environmental pollution and affecting operators' health. However, compared to the voltaic pile, which could only serve as a laboratory toy, this battery had high practical value.

All the raw materials for the Daniell cell could be provided by the Crossing Industry. Zinc was the "Japanese lead" of this space-time. The Crossing Group had imported large quantities of low-purity Japanese lead from Guangdong and re-smelted and purified it—the Manufacturing Committee had originally planned to use it to make tinplate.

After Dr. Zhong drew the design, the machine factory quickly manufactured a prototype. The battery's outer container was made of glass. Glass had better corrosion resistance and leak prevention than ordinary materials; the drawback was fragility. Fortunately, a typical wired telegraph machine wouldn't be moved around.

After the finished product was made, Zhong Lishi conducted a short-circuit spark discharge test to verify that this battery could work. He connected two rubber-coated copper wires from the two electrodes of the battery, then put on protective gloves against electric shock and slowly brought the two copper wires close together, touching. A very tiny electric spark, barely visible to the naked eye, flashed for an instant when the two wires made contact. This spark was very small and had to be observed carefully to be detected.

Then he used a multimeter to measure the battery. The output voltage was stable at 2 volts—the Daniell cell was a complete success. Dr. Zhong immediately named this battery the "Zhong Model 1 Battery." The reason for calling it "Model 1" was that he planned to continue appropriating later achievements—such as rechargeable lead-acid batteries.

The Zhong Model 1 Battery still had room for improvement. Subsequently, using information he had seen in technical materials, he processed and manufactured zinc sulfate solution to replace the dilute sulfuric acid in the battery. This approach was said to extend the life of the zinc rod in the battery. He had the machine factory make another prototype, planning to use two batteries simultaneously to see if this claim was valid.

After Dr. Zhong focused on researching batteries and wired telegraphy, Lingao had to continue using the traditional method of sounding steam whistles. Timekeeping work had not been emphasized by the Crossing Group in the past; they simply continued using Beijing time brought from another space-time.

Before crossing over, the Transmigrators, except for a few special-purpose locations, had replaced their timepieces with mechanical ones and also brought a large quantity of mechanical watches as reserves. All public and private timepieces were uniformly calibrated to Beijing time calculated from the Greenwich time shown on the marine chronometer aboard the *Fengcheng*.

To provide public time announcements for natives and Transmigrators, steam whistles were sounded four times daily at 6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00 at the thermal power stations in Bairen Castle and Bopu. Within Bairen Castle and Bopu Harbor, the Lingao wired broadcasting station provided hourly time announcements.

Now they realized that continuing to use this time system was no longer necessary. First, Lingao and Beijing were not in the same time zone. Second, on the future political map of the Crossing Group, Beijing—located in the far north, with poor natural environment and no access to the sea—didn't enjoy any special status. Some extremists had already proposed changing its name to "Youzhou" once the crossing enterprise succeeded in China.

After several discussions, the research group led by Wang Luobin concluded that they could start using local time in Lingao, which was the time of the East 7th time zone.

"To be honest, I don't see what practical significance switching from East 8th to East 7th has for us—other than satisfying some people's inexplicable preferences." Ma Qianzhu didn't understand this change driven more by psychological than practical factors.

"There's no harm in it anyway," Wang Luobin said. "At least timekeeping will be more precise. After all, there's a one-hour difference. Besides, some people even want to use Lingao time instead of Greenwich time."

"No, absolutely not. If we change that, a whole pile of technical materials would have to be modified. Too troublesome." Wen Desi wasn't interested in this proposal either.

Wang Luobin didn't want to change Greenwich time either. Right now, the most precise time they had was the Greenwich time on the *Fengcheng*'s marine chronometer. If they switched to Lingao time, it probably wouldn't be as precise as this original time.

"We need to establish an observatory in Lingao," Wang Luobin said.

The significance of establishing an observatory was of course not to observe Halley's Comet or look for signs of extraterrestrial life. The basic purpose of the Crossing Group's observatory was the same as the ancients'—mainly to serve precise calendars and timekeeping.

"Not just an observatory, but also a weather station," Ma Qianzhu suggested. "Weather forecasting is very important to us. We need not only a weather station but also a meteorological monitoring network."

"And hydrological stations," Wen Desi remembered that Yanque Zhi had mentioned to him the need to collect hydrological data on Lingao's main rivers. At minimum, full-watershed observation stations needed to be established in the Wenlan River basin.

"Alright, let's make this a systematic long-term plan." Wen Desi spread out the large-scale map of Lingao. "The observatory can be located in the Gaoshan Ridge area."

"Isn't that area planned for animal husbandry?"

"Besides animal husbandry, the observatory and weather station can also go there. I propose making the Gaoshan Ridge area our construction priority for the next phase," Wen Desi said. "We'll relocate our research institutions and archives to the mountainous area—it's easier to secure. If an enemy launches an attack, Bairen Castle could become a battlefield. With flat ground on all sides, it's hard for us to defend comprehensively."

There was also the issue of typhoons in Lingao. So far, the Crossing Group hadn't experienced a typhoon. According to warnings from several amateur meteorologists, late summer and early autumn was the peak period for typhoons hitting Lingao. Although Lingao was one of the coastal areas of Hainan Island with relatively fewer typhoons, the power of typhoons wasn't to be underestimated. They often caused flooding. The Crossing Group's main bases were either at harbors or by rivers, making them vulnerable to disasters. The Gaoshan Ridge area had much less wind damage and was less likely to suffer flooding. As for mudslides, the people at the Grand Library had searched through all the materials and found no such records in the Gaoshan Ridge area. Overall, it was a safe place.

Gaoshan Ridge had abundant water sources, a good natural environment, and milder temperatures than the Wenlan River basin. The geological conditions were also very stable—during the era of "dig deep tunnels and store plenty of grain," the local garrison had excavated large wartime caves there. Gaoshan Ridge had certain feasibility as a strategic reserve base for the Crossing Group.
