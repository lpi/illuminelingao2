# Chapter 216 - Bamboo-Reinforced Concrete

The solution was to treat the bamboo reinforcement with materials. The Bopu chemical plant was already capable of producing wood tar and coal tar. These two products were quite ancient in industrial chemistry.

Using a simple distillation apparatus, many different chemical products could be extracted from them. Recently, due to steelmaking needs, the Metallurgy Department had been coking at Bopu, accumulating considerable coal tar. This black, dirty coal tar had been used by the chemical plant to make incendiary tar bombs, coat telegraph poles along roads, and as waterproofing for shipbuilding. Much of it still remained stored in ceramic jars. Besides coal tar, the chemical plant had also received large quantities of wood tar produced when the timber processing plant made charcoal. It was piled up everywhere in the temporary warehouses.

Ji Situi hadn't yet installed the distillation tower, and the distilled products required acid and alkali washing processes, so they couldn't be processed immediately. But with so much material piled up in the sheds—to say nothing of the smell—someone had to be assigned to guard it. Both locals and transmigrators had designs on these materials. The natives' ideas were relatively harmless—basically planning to use it as fuel or for waterproofing ships. But the transmigrators each had their own wild schemes, and some half-baked chemistry experiments by amateurs were dangerous enough to give Ji Situi cold sweats.

Hearing Mei Wan's request for help, Ji Situi expressed great enthusiasm—better someone use the stuff than let it sit. Coal tar was the most basic of preservatives; using it to treat bamboo reinforcement was more than adequate.

Mei Wan first soaked the prepared bamboo strips in wood tar. This process wasn't just for coating them with tar—Mei Wan also hoped that through this method, the dried bamboo could absorb the creosote in the wood tar, making the material no longer absorb water while also providing anti-rot and anti-insect effects.

After soaking for several days, once the bamboo reinforcement was confirmed to be fully saturated, it was removed and coated evenly with coal tar on the surface. Of course, in the original timeline this treatment process would have been much more complex, but the transmigrators' chemical capabilities were still limited, so they could only use the simplest methods.

After treatment, the bamboo reinforcement itself still required physical modifications to serve as suitable material for bamboo-reinforced concrete. One drawback of bamboo was its overly smooth surface—not only was it difficult to secure when tying the reinforcement, but the concrete adhered poorly and was prone to shifting and bubbling. The solution was to modify the bamboo's shape by cutting notches in it. Another method was wrapping wire around the bamboo reinforcement.

Fortunately, though the Metallurgy Department's steel reserves couldn't supply rebar, supplying eighteen-gauge iron wire was more than adequate. Processing wire was convenient—wrought iron rods were placed in steel dies and pulled multiple times with powered machinery. The process was simple and consumed little raw material. Upon hearing that the Construction Corporation wanted to experiment with bamboo-reinforced concrete prefabricated panels, the Metallurgy Department immediately expressed strong support, readily agreeing to supply as much wire as needed—after all, various departments had been demanding wire lately: Linggao Telecommunications needed to lay telephone lines, and the Light Industry Department was about to start producing sewing needles.

The entire Construction Corporation threw itself into the work of tying reinforcement. This job required some technical skill—if Mei Wan himself hadn't come from construction sites, he really wouldn't have been able to handle it. What's more, this wasn't steel rebar but smooth bamboo. Several people led the Construction Corporation's regular construction workers, wrapping and winding bamboo strips over and over. Their only reference was a few blurry printed pictures. None of the transmigrators had done this work before, and soon someone had drawn blood and was gloriously wounded.

"Lord, this is way more trouble than steel rebar," Yan Quezhi complained.

Bing Feng nodded: "This stuff saves materials but not labor. And the strength is compromised. If it were really as good as they claim, why wasn't it widely adopted?"

Mei Wan was somewhat regretful by now but couldn't show it: "Right now we're solving the problem of having something versus having nothing. We're even mixing our own concrete—in the old days, we'd just have called a commercial concrete company to send over a few mixer trucks and been done with it."

The first prefabricated panel was tested after three days of curing. It proved fully usable as a lightweight floor panel. This result was quite encouraging.

"However, believe it or not, this stuff still shouldn't be used for load-bearing components," Bing Feng remained somewhat apprehensive.

Though that was true, this substitute was immediately put into production—Baireng City was experiencing a new construction boom, with buildings going up everywhere. Having prefabricated concrete components was an enormous convenience for the Construction Corporation. Mei Wan immediately conducted comprehensive training for the native construction workers, teaching them to tie reinforcement and make prefabricated panels. Soon, the first batch of cement floor panels went into the construction of "New Countryside" and the stadium.

Due to the use of machinery, the entire project progressed rapidly. After all, a single excavator's hourly earthwork output would take dozens of workers a full day. For the tamping work, Mei Wan also used a combined approach of steamroller compaction and manual tamping, with construction continuing through the night. At night, over a dozen gas lamps and countless torches illuminated the construction site brightly. All personnel worked in two shifts, day and night without distinction. The site rumbled with machinery and bustled with voices around the clock.

"This project really has the atmosphere of a great campaign," Bing Feng said. He had just finished supervising a section of the project and dragged his exhausted body back to the shelter of the construction headquarters tent. Though the outside temperature was still below 10°C, he wore only a dirt-and-dust-covered T-shirt. Having slept only four or five hours a night for three or four consecutive days, his eyes were red.

"Have some Wong Lo Kat." Yan Quezhi brought over a large plastic bottle filled with herbal tea made according to Nanhai's personal recipe—though the transmigrator canteen had been transferred to the General Office, it was still the original Agriculture Department staff who did the work.

"I'd rather drink plain boiled water than that stuff." Bing Feng shuddered at the smell of the herbal tea. This wasn't like the canned tea from the other timeline, which at least had sugar and flavoring added. Though it tasted strange, it was still tolerable.

Bing Feng gulped down the lightly salted physiological water specially prepared by the Health Department, then wiped his sweat with a towel, finally letting out a long breath:

"I dream of drinking Coca-Cola." He lamented. The small pleasures of the other timeline had now become remote and unattainable. Sometimes he truly regretted coming here. Wasn't this the same as before—no, worse than before. At least back then he could drink as much Coke as he wanted.

"Seal each completed section with stones immediately, don't wait for other sections." Mei Wan directed at the site every day, eyes red, voice hoarse from shouting.

"Manager Mei is really giving it his all," Bing Feng said to Zhuo Tianmin. The latter didn't respond, looking worried and distressed—he hadn't been home in three days. Though he'd entrusted his son to Wu De's woman, he still felt uneasy.

Yan Quezhi said: "I just don't understand—why is the Chairman so eager for this thing? Is it really needed right now?"

"The military parade, brother."

---

"Military parade?"

"Yes, for the natives coming to the conference. To demonstrate our power." Bing Feng had recently been busy finishing the Army Club project and knew the Army had been drilling formations since the New Year.

"Wasting resources and exhausting the people, wasting resources and exhausting the people," Yan Quezhi disapproved. "If you ask me, wouldn't expanding the hydroelectric plant be more urgent? The cost of building this huge reviewing stand would be enough to build two big dams on the Wenlan River."

"You don't know how much the Executive Committee has invested in this." Bing Feng pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. "Want one?"

"What, you've got cigarettes?" Yan Quezhi took it from him and discovered it was a hand-rolled cigarette. The rough paper was obviously a local product, though the tobacco inside was golden yellow.

"This is tobacco the Foreign Trade Company brought from Macau. I got hold of a little and rolled it myself."

"I think they're building this thing just to satisfy the leadership desires of those Executive Committee big shots. Ma Qianzhu is probably itching to shout those lines—'Comrades, greetings! Comrades, you've worked hard!'"

"Don't wrong Manager Ma—even if anyone were to shout that, it wouldn't be his turn. Director Wen is the Executive Committee Chairman. At most Ma would shout 'Please review the troops'—he's the Chief of Staff, after all."

"I notice they're quite united on this matter."

The two of them puffed away. Truth be told, this tobacco tasted nothing like cigarettes—it was sun-dried tobacco, not the flue-cured tobacco commonly used in modern cigarettes. Combined with the rough rolling paper, it was merely better than nothing.

"This is special supply goods from the Foreign Trade Company—where did you get it? They don't sell it in the canteen."

"Living off the land," Bing Feng shrugged. "This is military tobacco allocated to the Army. Haven't we been helping the Army build their club lately? I've been directing at the site, so they've given me quite a lot."

"You're engaging in corruption—"

"The Army is poor. The Navy's the real power," Bing Feng said somewhat enviously, exhaling a puff of smoke and coughing a couple of times. "If I didn't get seasick, I'd have joined the Navy too. The life they live—"

"We construction people have it hard," Yan Quezhi looked at Mei Lin directing workers laying stone blocks, sweating profusely, and Li Xiaolü taking level readings with a surveyor's instrument—a group of people at work. "Even women are working on the site."

"You're quite chivalrous, aren't you? What, interested?"

"Not at all," Yan Quezhi quickly denied. "She barely says three sentences a day besides work, and always looks like men owe her five million. Even if I were interested, I'd lose interest."

"True," Bing Feng said. "We need to train some people—at least get some construction foremen and technicians trained. That way we won't have to be on site every day ourselves."

"Aren't they supposed to build a school after the conference? Let's apply to start a department there: Civil Engineering."

"I don't care about foremen. Can I at least get a secretary? Someone to rub my shoulders and pound my legs after work—call it a perk."

"Hehe, there aren't even forty girls about to graduate from the nursing school. Would we get a turn?"

"True. Manager Mei might get one, though."
