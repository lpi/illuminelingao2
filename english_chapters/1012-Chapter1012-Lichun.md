# Chapter 1012 Lichun

"Unfortunately no finished products have been delivered yet, so we can only leave it empty for now." Zhou Ke said regretfully.

"Anyway, warships in the past could fight without this stuff—Nelson didn't have a fire control director either." Lin Shenhe knew this was purely some people's bizarre hobby erupting. With their current industrial capability and potential enemies' warship and cannon performance, naval combat firing range was at most 2,000 meters. They fundamentally didn't need ballistic computers; equipping gunners with telescopes, artillery firing tables, and slide rules was already cutting-edge technology.

Technology points beyond cutting-edge obviously weren't so easy to reach—this empty fire control director tower was proof.

But this wasn't his concern. He only handled cannons and shells. What aiming equipment the cannons used was for the Precision Instruments Department to consider.

As the tour was ending, Lin Shenhe suddenly thought of a question:

"Has this ship been named?"

"Not yet. The Navy said they'll hold the naming ceremony after sea trials."

"Did the Navy say what they're planning to call it?"

"Reportedly someone proposed Yukikaze or Shigure..."

"Damn, too creepy." Lin Shenhe got goosebumps all over. There really were quite a few IJN fans in the Navy. Since there were proposals for Yukikaze and Shigure, needless to say, Nowaki would probably be nominated too.

"I think we could use mountain and river names, like Taihang, Taishan, Kunlun—impressive!" Zhou Ke gestured as he spoke.

Lin Shenhe shook his head: "A ship this small probably can't carry such names." He actually preferred names like "Fearless," "Indomitable," "Furious," "Enterprise"—but the 1630-class equally couldn't live up to such grandeur. Although building ten-thousand-ton battleships in this dimension seemed excessive, at least warships over four or five thousand tons were needed to show majesty. By comparison, names like Shigure were more appropriately scaled.

Installing cannons on the 1630-class lead ship took three days, during which nearly half the Senators from the Mechanical Department were mobilized to solve problems—especially all Senators with fitter certificates. Constantly adjusting and fitting parts became the main theme of installation work. To improve efficiency, several mobile equipment units were specially transported to the dockside assembly site. The cannon carriages, rails, and even mounting bolts all brought Zhou Ke endless trouble. Standardized production had been promoted for over two years, yet still had many problems in actual use—workers weren't performing well, and materials were even worse.

Zhou Ke maintained calm composure—in overseeing the shipbuilding outfitting plan, he had become accustomed to endless problems. In his words: when installing equipment, he never expected success on the first try.

Through everyone's collective efforts, all cannons were finally installed and operating normally. Although fire control equipment didn't produce a ballistic computer, at least before formal sea trials it was equipped with some simple devices like artillery slide rules and observation mirrors.

The artillery observation mirror was manufactured by Lin Hanlong. The observation mirror was mainly used as a reticle. Structurally it was a Keplerian telescope, not difficult to manufacture. But to obtain relatively large field of view and light throughput, a relatively large aperture was needed. For Lin Hanlong, although this was challenging, it wasn't insurmountable.

Most difficult was lens tube sealing—although they had no cold fir optical cement or rubber gaskets, they had to use complex copper gaskets, vulcanized cowhide gaskets, and finally seal with eucommia rubber. Although the proposal to widely plant eucommia as a rubber substitute was rejected, eucommia rubber was still used in small areas where performance requirements weren't strict. Fortunately, eucommia had always been cultivated in China, making raw material collection convenient.

The lens tube installation buffer structure used vulcanized cowhide. Although operational performance wasn't ideal, it was barely usable. Lenses were originally planned to use lead glass or naturally smelted quartz crystal—Hainan itself had rich natural quartz crystal deposits. But Lin Hanlong's experimental smelting attempts never produced suitable products, so he had to settle for existing products.

The rangefinder was originally the Optical Workshop's breakthrough project, but Lin Hanlong discovered many currently insurmountable problems during experiments—especially the lack of quality optical glass and processing methods. Even if manufactured at this stage, quality couldn't be guaranteed.

The Planning Bureau's warehouse had one-meter rangefinders for 37mm cannons and half-meter rangefinders for mortars bought in bulk from military surplus stores on Taobao in the old dimension—ranging 4-5 kilometers with precision sufficient for ship cannons, nearly a hundred units. But the Navy ultimately decided not to use these "precision equipment."

"For military equipment, as long as it's usable, we must base it on domestic production." Naval People's Commissar Ming Qiu stated at the 854 Modification technical meeting.

Finally, artillery rangefinders were simplified to a simple bearing plate system. Specifically, angle plates with sights were installed at bow and stern. Using sights to aim at targets, then calculating the distance between warship and target from the difference in angles displayed at bow and stern—this technology appeared in the 19th century, quite fitting the Senate Navy's current technical level.

Wind vanes and anemometers were also installed in fire control equipment to measure crosswinds and headwinds. Wind direction and speed were important reference data when calculating firing solutions.

The final piece of equipment was a quadrant, made of tin-bronze, used to measure cannon inclination angles in the vertical plane within the 0-1500 mil (0°-90°) range, check cannon sighting devices and cannon angles. It could also set cannons to required firing positions. Combined with ranging and plotting, it could determine enemy ship speed. More importantly, the command platform could use limit stops on the quadrant to determine ship cannon safe arcs, preventing friendly fire on one's own ship during intense combat.

After all fire control equipment was installed, the ship finally received its delayed name: "Lichun." Whether this meant 24 1630-class ships would be built sparked discussion among Senators. Naval personnel cheered joyfully; the Army was worried. The Planning Bureau spokesperson's answer to the Senate was: "Currently there's no plan to begin building a second batch of 1630-class ships." However, he acknowledged that preliminary preparation for laying the second 1630-class's keel had begun, just waiting for Senate approval of the "Second Naval Vessel Outfitting Program" budget.

However, from this ship's naming, clearly there were internal plans within the Navy Ship Administration Bureau to build larger warships. The Navy denied this; Naval People's Commissar Chen Haiyang stated: Currently there were no plans to build new warship types.

August 10: 200 crew members and shipyard technical personnel and workers boarded the warship. Under the command of Outfitting Committee Chief Li Di, they went to sea for the first trial voyage. August 11: The ship conducted scheduled 360-degree turns both port and starboard and speed change trials in the Qiongzhou Strait. That evening it anchored at Hongpai Harbor on the Maniao Peninsula. August 12: "Lichun" conducted full-speed official trials in the same waters under escort of 2 8154 cruisers, including sailing with steam engines and sails in various sea conditions.

August 22: Former *Haitian* Captain Lieutenant Commander Li Ziping of the Navy was appointed as "Lichun's" first captain. A series of sea trials followed. August 29: 130mm main gun firing tests and ballistic tests were conducted in the sea near Hongpai Island. The fore and aft main guns fired salvos toward Hongpai Island direction 4 kilometers away; the distant rumbling cannon fire could be heard even inside Maniao Fort.

September 1: Having completed firing tests, *Lichun* returned to Bopu. Eight days later, *Lichun* officially completed and entered service, was handed over to the Navy, and raised the naval ensign. Its ship registry port was the Navy's Kaohsiung Harbor.

At this point, Kaohsiung naturally didn't exist at all—but this didn't prevent Kaohsiung from being one of the main bases in the Senate Navy system.

All sea trials went smoothly. Although several malfunctions occurred during navigation tests—especially the steam engines and boilers occasionally having small problems—none were serious issues. With slight repairs and adjustments, testing could continue.

After a month of intensive testing, *Lichun*'s complete data was:

Light displacement: 1,091 tons. Standard displacement: 1,160 tons. Normal displacement: 1,359 tons. Full load displacement: 1,519 tons. Actual power output: 489 horsepower. Maximum speed under standard sea conditions at full power: 12.5 knots. Maximum sail speed: 15 knots. Coal carried at maximum displacement: 359 tons. Maximum powered range: 5 knots/5,000 nautical miles.

Ship personnel, excluding marines: 149 persons. Additionally could carry one marine platoon with all their weapons and equipment for extended periods. For short voyages, could carry one company with attached light artillery and gun crews.

Li Ziping's overall assessment of *Lichun*: Excellent machinery, storage, and cabin space; sufficient accommodation and work space; the ship's slow, steady rolling made it a good firing platform. An excellent seagoing vessel—comfortable, capable of firing in the worst weather.

Overall, Li Ziping was quite satisfied with this ship—it was far superior to the transmigrators' first self-built warship *Haitian*. In sailing performance alone it was much more stable than *Haitian*. Large-caliber cannon firing effects were also satisfactory. Whether using armor-piercing or explosive shells, target destruction far exceeded their psychological expectations.

As for living conditions—the hard indicator Senators cared most about—there was also a quantum leap. Especially in Senator officer cabin arrangements, *Lichun* was much more spacious than the "Zhenhai" class. Not only could the captain traditionally enjoy a private cabin, but Senator officers also had double rooms. The ship's galley had also been upgraded.

"Give me three months and I'll have this ship at full combat capability." he told Chen Haiyang confidently.

"You don't have three months—only thirty days to familiarize with equipment and train your crew." Chen Haiyang said. "Once Mid-Autumn Festival passes, Operation Engine will fully commence."
