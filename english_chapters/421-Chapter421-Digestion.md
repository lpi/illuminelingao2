# Chapter 421 Digestion

Chen Haiyang nodded and had someone receive it. As usual, he said some words of encouragement and reassurance. Then Shi Shisi presented gifts. These were specially selected from the treasures of each family for today's ceremony: a pair of excellent Japanese katanas, a pair of flawless white Hetian jade lions, a wine set consisting of a gold-inlaid jeweled ewer and four jade cups with gold trim. Finally, there was a box of small gold ingots, each weighing one *tael*, a full fifty in total.

Chen Haiyang took a brief look and thought to himself: *These pirates really do have substantial resources!*

However, he had already heard complaining from the sailors who arrived earlier, saying that they had been in arrears for one or two months. It seemed that while there was no money for paying soldiers, the leaders' personal purses were still quite full.

Since this was a gift publicly presented, it was a symbol of submission. Chen Haiyang naturally accepted it. He ordered it to be received and handed over to the Planning Commission to be recorded and stored.

After receiving the gift, Chen Haiyang slowly scrutinized them before speaking: "Since you leaders have come to serve my Lingao, you are now our people of Australia. From now on, we are one family. 'Working together with one heart' is not just words; it must be truly achieved. Do you understand?!"

"Yes, we little ones understand!" Shi Shisi started to sweat on his back.

"Please proceed to the Commercial Hall for a banquet, leaders." A smile appeared on Chen Haiyang's face. "A reception to wash the dust off the road for you leaders!"

After the ceremony ended, Lin Baiguang led the leaders to the cafeteria in Bopu, where a reception banquet had already been set up. As for the men, women, old, and young on the ships, the staff from Yang He's Quarantine Camp came over to count the number of people and register them in a roster, then lead them to "purification" and meals. As for the inventory of materials, since there were still people's private property on the ships, the Planning Commission did not board the ships to count the grain and materials for now, only sending people to stand guard at the gangways of each ship.

Eighty sea-going ships of various sizes, the smallest being a large sampan capable of carrying over twenty people, the largest reaching over four hundred tons, were all *Guang* ships and *Fu* ships common in this area.

With the Navy adding this many ships, not only did the maritime military strength greatly increase, but the shipping capacity, which had always been felt to be lacking, could also be solved. The situation of having to use ships as both warships and transport vessels was finally relieved.

As soon as the reception banquet ended, Chen Haiyang had already begun to plan the distribution of these ships at the Naval Department. There were now too many miscellaneous ships under the Naval Department, and a good reorganization plan was needed.

But things were not so simple. These ships were still the private property of the leaders up to now. Their defection was not an unconditional surrender, but a kind of "joint venture." As the Chairman of the Board, one couldn't just strip shareholders of their means of production at will. The result of doing so would be that no one would come to "join the venture" in the future.

In terms of power, the pirate leaders were now at an absolute disadvantage; it was no longer possible for them to resist or flee. But winning people's hearts was a long and arduous task.

What the Transmigrators needed was "absorption," not "alliance." This keynote was the basic principle for absorbing natives into the Crossing Group, so giving them the status of allies was not considered.

This batch of defecting pirates were not prisoners of war stripped of everything, nor were they desperate refugees, but an organized and established armed gang.

To completely absorb them, this group of leaders would naturally be unwilling—this kind of gang had a strong nature of private ownership; everyone regarded ships and sailors as their private property. Therefore, how to "reform" this established group of pirates became an urgent issue.

"Little Wei, this job is handed to you," Ma Qianzhu said in the office. "Use your brain and help us digest this team of over a thousand people without indigestion. Understood?"

"Yes, General Secretary Ma, just watch me on this matter." Wei Aiwen was full of confidence.

Wei Aiwen's absorption plan was very traditional. In short, it was "reassure the upper level, win over the middle level, and strive for the lower level."

The most important thing was to win over the lower level. They were numerous and had always been in a neglected position when distributing benefits. They had no great common interests with the leaders and might even have many complaints. Winning them over was relatively easy.

Once the lower level was won over, the middle-level elements would be fence-sitters, and the upper-level elements, even if they had complaints, would be unable to resist due to losing grassroots support. At that time, treating them well as an example or directly "humanely destroying" them was entirely up to the Transmigrators' interests.

As for the upper-level elements, Wei Aiwen believed they could also be differentiated—the leaders' demands were not consistent. In the report submitted immediately after landing, Lin Baiguang pointed out that the ideas of this group of leaders were currently not consistent. Someone like Fatty Hu wanted to find a comfortable nest and enjoy a peaceful retirement; Lin Dan was anxious to find his wife and children; Shi Shisi wanted to climb this big tree and continue to make money...

"We divide and conquer, and we can absorb them quickly," Wei Aiwen expounded his thinking to Ma Qianzhu.

"You have full authority over this matter. That includes Ren Fu and He Xin's group—put effort into them too. We lack ships, and we lack sailors even more. We need to win over the sailors and the technical backbones among them as soon as possible."

"Also, there's the issue of the leaders' treatment," Wei Aiwen hesitated. "This matter also needs to be addressed. The sailors are easy to deal with; they can be given the same provisions as Navy soldiers. What about these bosses?"

The Crossing Group had already implemented a worker classification and technical grade system among the natives, but for administrative personnel and Army and Navy soldiers, they still adopted communist-style supply systems. Officers and administrative personnel only received a bit more allowance, not much different from ordinary soldiers and workers.

"Don't worry about this for now; the Executive Committee needs to consider it." Ma Qianzhu thought of how the administrative rank system he proposed at the meeting had been shot down. "Now we're in a good situation. What treatment do you assign to this group of people?"

First was the issue of salary treatment. They didn't rely on this to make a living under Zhu Cailao; robbery and trade were the sources of income...

Thinking of this, Ma Qianzhu's eyes lit up: *Right! Forcing them to become Navy captains or fleet commanders and live on salaries would result in low enthusiasm and complaints. It would be better to let them play to their strengths and do their old business.*

"Their place is not in the Naval Department, but in the Foreign Business Committee!"

He sat down again and began drafting a proposal for handling this batch of people.

In the evening, a meeting was held by the Executive Committee. At the meeting, Ma Qianzhu expounded on his views and ideas.

"This proposal is good; otherwise, this group would be quite difficult to handle. Having them lead troops might not be reliable either."

"Hmm, just let them do their old business!"

So someone proposed reconsidering the establishment of the "Southeast Asian Company." This so-called "Southeast Asian Company" had been envisioned by the Executive Committee for quite some time. Its purpose was to conduct direct maritime trade with Southeast Asia, obtain agricultural, forestry, and mineral resources from there, and later, when their strength increased, to undertake colonial expansion work—similar in nature to the East India Company.

However, this idea was shelved because the Naval Department had few ships suitable for long voyages, and they also lacked personnel familiar with this field. Now having the leaders under the great sea merchant Zhu Cailao do this was just right.

"In the past, one, we didn't have enough ships, and two, we were afraid that if conflicts arose locally, we wouldn't be able to protect ourselves with few people and ships. But now, with this new force joining, the conditions for direct trade in Southeast Asia are ripe," Ma Qianzhu said.

Li Haiyang was very excited: "When necessary, we can also have them conduct privateering in local waters. Strike at the Europeans' trade there."

"It's not time for that yet," Wen Desi objected. "Privateering will arouse enmity. Our presence in Southeast Asia is still a blank; we shouldn't do this before establishing a foothold. The Dutch, Spanish, and English are not people to be trifled with. If there's a real conflict, we have no foothold there and could easily be defeated by them. Also, privateering is a kind of piracy. This group is already part-merchant, part-pirate. If they taste the sweetness of robbery and simply become pirates in Southeast Asian waters, we might not be able to control them. Then there would be endless troubles."

Wen Desi continued: "Whether it's privateering or pioneering colonies, we shouldn't do it before we have the ability to truly intervene in Southeast Asian affairs. Just ensure the safety of our own trade."

In Wen Desi's concept, the ships of the Southeast Asian Company would trade in convoy formation. Every voyage would form a large escort fleet—similar to the annual maritime circuit trade conducted by the Venetians in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Such a large fleet, with sufficient personnel and military force, would be able to protect itself during voyages. Neither Europeans nor other maritime groups would be a concern.

"We in the Navy don't understand trade matters," Chen Haiyang said. "I just want to know: what is the Executive Committee's attitude towards their personnel and ships? Allow them to retain their original units and command system, or disband and reorganize completely?"

"Beiping-style retention of units," Ma Qianzhu said.

That meant, nominally retain the units, but actually gradually strip the leaders of their control over the original personnel through infiltration and adjustment of personnel structures.

"According to the figures from the roster and the verification results sent by the Quarantine Camp," Wu De opened the folder, "there are a total of 1,803 people. Among them, 230 are women, children, and the elderly over fifty. In fact, on average, each ship has fewer than 20 sailors."

Obviously, even counting the women, children, and elderly, and excluding the small vessels that only needed a few people, they were still seriously short of manpower.

"So, to get these ships running again, sailors must be supplemented." Wu De looked at the Planning Commission's ship inventory list. "Excluding small sampans and such, at least 1,500 more people need to be supplemented for these ships to operate fully."
