# Chapter 1541 - Shopkeeper Huang

"Cock-a-doodle-doo..."

With the high-pitched crowing of roosters, Nanbao Town—the southernmost Chinese settlement in Lingao County, which had flourished due to mining and trade with the Li ethnic area—began to slowly wake up. White smoke drifted from chimneys. Small shops took down their doorboards to prepare for the morning market. National Army soldiers on night duty rubbed their red eyes as they descended from the watchtowers.

An officer on duty emerged from the guardroom, keys in hand, yawning as he unlocked the gate at the town entrance. This place bordered the Li area, with the nearest Li stockade less than two kilometers away. Han-Li conflict on Hainan Island was extremely sharp during the Ming dynasty. Agricultural counties like Lingao had historically been hotspots for land disputes between Han and Li people. Several major Li uprisings in the Ming dynasty had occurred in the northern Qiongzhou region.

Although the Li and Miao Affairs Office believed the likelihood of local Li uprisings was low after a three-pronged infiltration strategy of trade, missionary work, and education/healthcare, necessary precautions were still maintained. After all, their control over the Li areas was still weak, with considerable uncertainty. Nanbao was not only a window for Li trade but also home to the important Nanbao Coal Mine. Though the coal quality was low, the lignite, stone, and clay produced here were in high demand for agriculture and construction.

Therefore, after the public order war in northern Qiongzhou ended, the General Military Department stationed a National Army platoon here, maintaining a relatively high level of alertness.

As the town gates opened, miners rushing to early shifts and peddlers heading to the Li areas trickled out, and the streets gradually filled with people.

Sima Qiudao, draped in a patched robe, climbed out of a bed made of two tables pushed together. The sky was turning pale; it was getting late. He had to dress quickly, or the girls living upstairs wouldn't be able to come down to cook breakfast.

The place he lived in was a two-story building along the street, one of many "shophouses" built by the Cooperative in Nanbao. However, the Cooperative had clearly overestimated Nanbao's development potential. After the establishment of the Nanbao Mining Company, the local area had boomed for a time. But as coal from Hongay and Qiongoshan began pouring into Lingao via sea transport, Nanbao's low-calorific coal was relegated to being mere fertilizer feedstock. If not for the huge demand from the agricultural sector, the Nanbao coal mine would have had almost no extraction value.

Fortunately, Lingao's construction industry had huge demands, so the stone and clay mined by Nanbao Mining Company enjoyed brisk production and sales. Consequently, the scale of Nanbao Mining didn't expand further—Nanbao's coal reserves weren't large, and the high transport costs of stone and clay limited their sales radius. The originally planned Nanbao Phase III and Phase IV were cancelled by the Planning Commission.

Checkered by the lack of a leading enterprise, Nanbao's population growth slowed significantly. In recent years, though small enterprises processing rattan, Chinese herbal medicines, leather, and kapok for Li trade had started up, their scale was small and their capacity to absorb labor limited. The Planning Commission didn't arrange mass migration here; as for free migrants, they preferred the booming banks of the Wenlan River—no one wanted to run to this "frontier" region of Nanbao.

Since Nanbao's development wasn't as good as expected, it naturally couldn't support too much commerce. Many shophouses built by the Cooperative thus became rental housing. After Sima Qiudao's group arrived in Lingao, the local contact arranged for them to stay here.

The house was a two-story building with a three-bay frontage, plus a small courtyard and several side rooms in the back. The street in front wasn't busy, but it was close to the main road, and the back door led to a quiet alley. Transport was very convenient. Huang Zhen, responsible for scouting houses, had taken a fancy to it immediately.

Huang Zhen was known as "Bronze Pen, Iron Abacus." He looked well-fed and had the air of a merchant. For this operation, he counted as the "Shopkeeper" coming to Lingao to open a business.

Nowadays, many merchants came to Lingao to open shops, but most were in East Gate Market or Bopu; very few came to Nanbao. So when he showed an intention to "invest and open a shop" in Nanbao, the local Cooperative director had enthusiastically shown him all over town, and Huang Zhen finally chose this place.

For Sima Qiudao, the house was decent—clean, tidy, and comfortable enough. The only drawback was that it was a bit small for the number of people they had brought.

For this major mobilization of the Central Plains martial arts world, seven or eight people, led by Huang Zhen and Sima Qiudao, had arrived in the first wave alone. More were still to come.

Asking these men and women from prestigious sects to shave their heads, undergo "purification," and become naturalized citizens was naturally out of the question. But "independent employment" would be too conspicuous anywhere else. They could only hide in this so-called "shop."

It wasn't just the number of people; several "heroines" had come along too. Though all were children of the *jianghu*, men and women had to be separated—especially since their masters were all respectable elders in the martial arts world—so they couldn't all sleep in a communal bunk. Thus, two of the three upstairs rooms were given to the women, and one was reserved for the operation's key figure who had yet to arrive: Zhuo Yifan, head disciple of the Wudang Sect. The rest had to squeeze into the rear side rooms, and even Huang Zhen could only rest in the accountant's nook on the first floor.

Sima Qiudao found the crowd too noisy, so he simply slept in the main hall on two Eight Immortals tables pushed together, finding it quite carefree.

He went to the well in the backyard to wash and saw Huang Zhen already rinsing his mouth. Huang Zhen was over fifty; judging by his build and dress, he looked like a merchant, with an abacus under his arm and a writing brush stuck in his sash—a rather odd appearance. Seeing his portly figure and slow movements, one wouldn't guess the level of his martial arts.

But Sima Qiudao knew Huang Zhen was the head disciple of the Mount Hua Sect leader. In terms of martial arts, perhaps only Zhuo Yifan here was stronger.

"Shopkeeper Huang." For secrecy, they had changed how they addressed each other. "You're up early."

"Ah, Sima." Huang Zhen spat out the water. "Not early anymore. A businessman can't sleep in. As they say, rise at dawn, sweep the courtyard. Only when you and the shop are clean will customers feel welcome and business prosper."

Sima Qiudao thought to himself: *Stop pretending!* Huang Zhen liked to present himself as a merchant normally; for this infiltration into Lingao, he was playing the shopkeeper role to the hilt.

However, in a martial arts world that stressed sect lineage and seniority, Huang Zhen's status was far above a junior from the Qingcheng Sect like him. So Sima Qiudao remained outwardly respectful: "You are right, Shopkeeper."

As they spoke, a woman came out of the house, seemingly still half-asleep, rubbing her eyes. Seeing Huang Zhen and Sima Qiudao in the yard, she hastily curtsied.

"Miss Nan, you're up early too," Huang Zhen greeted with a smile, squinting.

The woman called Miss Nan was no longer young by the standards of this time, looking about twenty-five or twenty-six. She wore a pale green skirt with a pale red vest, her waist slender and her figure graceful. Her dark eyes sparkled, lively and expressive, as if they could speak. Her face was beautiful, with a hint of a smile at the corners of her mouth that instantly made one feel close to her.

Women didn't wash at the well platform. Even a daughter of the *jianghu* had to maintain the dignity of a respectable sect; she couldn't be too unruly outside.

"Not early at all. It'll be broad daylight soon. If I don't cook, everyone will have nothing to eat when they get up." Miss Nan pursed her lips in a smile and went to the kitchen to measure rice.

Seeing her go in, she whispered to Huang Zhen, "Shopkeeper Huang, are we just going to hole up here for the next few days?"

The smile vanished from Huang Zhen's face. "Didn't Seventh Master say? We listen to his instructions for everything. This isn't the Ming; it's extremely dangerous here."

"Seventh Master" was their local contact. They knew very little about him, only that he was with the Brocade Guard and had been undercover in Lingao for years.

"Old Shi said this place is a dragon's pool and tiger's den. I scouted their lair, East Gate Market, yesterday—it didn't seem like much."

"Zixiao, don't underestimate the Cropped-Hairs. Over the years, countless Green forest figures have wanted to come to this booming place to make a fortune. Every one of them has gone and never returned, like stones dropped into the sea. Several were great bandits who roamed the two capitals and various provinces, yet rumor has it they stumbled in Lingao too." Being older, Huang Zhen was naturally more cautious. "Seventh Master said there are many secret agents from the Interview Bureau here, and they don't follow *jianghu* rules. Our ways don't work here. We must be extremely careful in every move and absolutely not act rashly."

"Yes, I understand." Sima Qiudao was somewhat unconvinced. He had gone to East Gate Market a few days ago to meet Xin Nachun. Make no mistake, he was shocked by its prosperity and the orderly streets, but he didn't see the "sentries every three steps, guards every five," the forest of swords and heavy security he had imagined.

When he wandered the streets of East Gate Market, he didn't even sense a trace of danger. The Short-Hairs and strange clothes were countless. The Cropped-Hairs were so good at winning hearts; no wonder the court was helpless against their years of occupying Lingao.

"Zixiao," Huang Zhen felt the younger man was being too reckless and cautioned him, "Old Shi exhausted himself sending us here, even pulling out someone like Seventh Master from his pocket. We must not fail his high hopes. We must get to the bottom of this matter! Report to the court above, save the myriad people below!"

Sima Qiudao nodded, feeling a bit more pressure. They had been infiltrating Lingao for over a month now, just holeing up like this. Sometimes he wondered what he was doing here.

But the purpose of this trip was known only to the Wudang Sect's head disciple, Zhuo Yifan, who had not yet arrived.

Even someone like Huang Zhen was just an advance party member.
