# Chapter 1221 - Jin Wushun's Whereabouts

"Your next step must be to leave here as soon as possible," Mendoza warned. "The Australian transmigrator who was bidding on you particularly hates white people—he won't let this go."

"Of course—I want to go to Manila immediately!" Marina said hastily. "But I have no money and don't know how to get there..."

"Let Mr. Lando take you." Mendoza sighed. "Because Mr. Lando bought you, he can't stay here either."

Marina felt somewhat guilty and said quietly: "Thank you so much."

"Think nothing of it. Saving a Spanish noblewoman's honor is my privilege." Mr. Lando twirled his small mustache. "I've grown tired of this place anyway. Perfect time for a change of scenery. We'll depart in a week—there's a Chinese merchant ship going to Manila."

"What about my two maids?"

Miss Mendoza lowered her head and said sadly:

"They were sold several days ago. Widow Tolosa was sold to an Australian nobleman to be a Spanish tutor. The two maids were probably also sold to Australian nobles."

"Could I ransom the maids? I'll pay everything once I reach Manila."

"I'm afraid that would be very difficult," Miss Mendoza said. "The Australians like white slave women."

Marina knew Mendoza was right. She could only silently resolve to find a way to ransom them later. For now, escaping this terrible place was the priority—she wished she could sprout wings and fly away.

"This noble young lady has some conscience at least—she can still think about her maids." On the other side of the wall, Li Yan, head of the Intelligence Bureau's Ming Department, was monitoring their conversation from a dark room and commented.

Lando's "temporary residence" was actually a luxury suite in the Dongmen Market trading house, fully equipped with surveillance facilities and a monitoring room. Under the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's orchestration, Lando's Manila infiltration plan was proceeding in an orderly fashion.

"You don't understand—this young lady has traveled across the ocean to marry a stranger. Her accompanying maids are practically family. How could she not care about them? Besides, there's still Widow Tolosa," Jiang Shan said, sipping mint-flavored ramune soda and carefully listening to their conversation with a smile.

"She deliberately left her out?"

"Perhaps." Wang Ding said. "Elites always consider themselves naturally superior—everyone else is just grass. Widow Tolosa obviously isn't someone she likes."

"What about Widow Tolosa?" Li Yan asked. "Did someone really buy her to be a tutor?"

"Of course she's still in the quarantine camp, under the Government Office's management." Jiang Shan seemed to be evaluating the new flavor of soda, savoring it as he spoke. "Widow Tolosa just dresses like an old woman."

"Miss Mendoza and Lando are both talented actors." Li Yan was full of praise. "I know Lando, but I never expected Miss Mendoza to be so professional. She really spoke with genuine feeling."

"She's not acting—that's genuine emotion." A trace of a smile appeared at the corner of Jiang Shan's mouth. "When the fake becomes real, the real becomes fake. Miss Mendoza is currently in that state—but it's fine. It makes her more believable."

"With this little lady paving the way, Lando's work will be much easier." Though Li Yan headed the Ming Department, actual work wasn't divided so strictly. He'd contributed considerably to this Manila infiltration plan. "But I need to go calm Xiao Bailang down."

"He was deliberately making trouble," Jiang Shan said with displeasure. "We'd clearly communicated with everyone that bidding on this Spanish girl should be kept moderate..."

"I think it was actually a good thing—now it's become real as well. Look how effective! Just like shooting a movie!" Wang Ding was quite pleased. The idea of putting Marina up for auction had been his.

"The next step is up to Lando." Jiang Shan said. "Let's see what secrets the Spanish in Manila are hiding."



Shi Niaoren returned from the auction to his office at the General Hospital and lit a cigar. On his desk sat the thick medical examination booklets for this batch of slave women that had just been delivered—several large volumes. He decided to look through them in a few days. The stuff gave him headaches. Later he'd have to train some graduate students specifically to review such things. Speaking of which, Ma Jia had written asking him to commit to taking Guo Fu as a graduate student.

*Graduate student! Your Guo Fu's level, even generously estimated, is just vocational school—and the crash course kind at that!* Although the Hospital Director thought this privately, he also knew that among naturalized medical personnel, Guo Fu was already in the top five. If not her, there was hardly anyone worth training.

The atmosphere at the auction had shown him the transmigrators' "ambitions," making him deeply worried about future maternal and infant healthcare at Lingao General Hospital. He opened the latest quarterly report on transmigrator sperm vitality. Overall sperm vitality had risen by several percentage points compared to the previous quarter.

At this rate, before long transmigrator sperm vitality would return to normal levels. Considering that most transmigrators were young, a few middle-aged, and that since D-Day they'd been living exceptionally healthy lives, their sperm quality would necessarily be better than in the old timeline. Moreover, their hormone levels were high, their libidos strong, and maid coverage was approaching universal. The second baby boom would come faster and stronger than the first.

He clearly remembered the number in the "Transmigrator Children Registry": fifty-one, with thirty-five registered pregnant women. So many children and pregnant women—just maternal and infant healthcare alone was overwhelming the General Hospital. Never mind that the maternal and infant department also handled external outpatient services and deliveries: prenatal checkups and hospital births took up a huge amount of manpower.

No matter how he calculated, the medical personnel currently in training weren't enough. Enrollment had to be expanded.

"What a headache." When Director Shi thought about having to go cap-in-hand to the Planning Commission again for extra funding and personnel, he couldn't help but sigh. It seemed Deng Bojun's Guangzhou revenue-generation plan had some merit after all—at least that would be self-financing, without having to beg for everything.

While he was pondering, a nurse came knocking: "Dr. Ning requests your consultation."

"Which patient?" Shi Niaoren asked.

"A burn patient sent from Jeju Island—special care in the burn ward."

"I understand. I'll be right there."

The patient Shi Niaoren was going to consult on was Jin Wushun. Feng Zongze had been determined to save her life, and after the Executive Committee heard of this case, they too instructed the General Hospital to do everything possible to save her—to let her live on as a banner, a beacon.

With the Executive Committee's instructions, all parties naturally spared no expense. A 901 gunboat was immediately dispatched from Hong Kong at full speed to Jeju Island. On board were medical personnel and necessary drugs and equipment—including a transmigrator doctor, Ning Jinghai, who had originally been scheduled to make rounds in Taiwan but was now sent directly to Jeju Island.

When the ship arrived at Jeju Island, Jin Wushun was transported aboard as quickly as possible. Under the direction of personnel from Lingao General Hospital, a special isolation ward had been set up on the ship with thorough disinfection. For the following weeks of the voyage, medical staff would care for the Senate's hero here, stabilizing her condition so she could safely reach Lingao and receive treatment from the Australian Chiefs—as if blessed by divine intervention.

According to Ning Jinghai's diagnosis, though Jin Wushun's burns were severe—second degree—they hadn't damaged her tendons. However, based on knowledge from his medical school days, there was still a possibility of further necrosis of the wound tissue. Currently, Jin Wushun didn't need to consider skin grafting or flap repair urgently—of course, the only place in this timeline with conditions for such treatment was Lingao General Hospital, and surgery certainly couldn't be performed on Jeju Island. But during the long voyage, Jin Wushun still needed continued debridement and dressing changes, and once fresh granulation tissue formed, skin grafting surgery could be performed.

Though the burned skin had already been excised by Feng Zongze, and theoretically new skin could grow on its own, anyone with basic medical knowledge knew that Jin Wushun's now-unprotected wounds were wide open to all sorts of pathogenic microorganisms. She needed a substitute for her original skin as protection.

Therefore, before departure, Ning Jinghai had formulated a plan to use specially processed deep-sea fish skin for xenograft transplantation to protect the wound surface. As Jin Wushun's new skin tissue grew, the foreign skin would naturally shed after completing its mission.

In the medically undeveloped 1970s of the original timeline, using animal skin to rescue burn patients had been a widely-used technique in burn departments. Under the Senate's leadership in this new nation, industrial safety standards were far below old-timeline levels, with accidents of all kinds occurring frequently. To rescue workers burned in various industrial accidents, the transmigrators, limited by conditions, had revived this method. The Health Department's pharmaceutical and equipment factory used fresh skin from large deep-sea fish. After descaling, disinfecting, soaking, and then immersing in glutaraldehyde—used for sterilization and leather tanning—to remove antigenicity, it was stored in cold storage and cut to size as needed. For this purpose, the ship's lower hold had been packed with ice from Hong Kong's cold storage as ballast, to keep the fish skin refrigerated.

The 901 gunboat set sail, and the test for the rescue team began. According to the burn treatment principles in Ning Jinghai's medical textbooks, serious burn patients had to pass three critical hurdles: shock, infection, and skin grafting. In the two to three days immediately after being burned, safely passing the shock phase was crucial, because after burns, massive amounts of body fluid (including protein and water) are lost from the wound.

Jin Wushun had already safely passed this hurdle on Jeju Island, thanks to Feng Zongze's unstinting use of his personal supplies and careful nursing. During those days, besides closely monitoring her blood pressure, pulse, and respiration, on the fluid replacement question, the transmigrators and local inexperienced naturalized medics, based on their intuitive physiological knowledge, advocated breaking with convention and appropriately increasing blood transfusions.
