# Chapter 1268 - The Push

"Once Zheng Sen returns to them, although he has no strength himself, he is a banner that can be used for rallying—moreover, he is a child easily manipulated. There will definitely be ambitious men coming to support him. At that time, the entire Zheng group won't just be a 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' in Zhangzhou Bay, but a situation like the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods," Jiang Shan analyzed.

"Is it necessary to make it so complicated for an eight-year-old child?" Wen Desi expressed objection at the meeting. "Do we need to be sentimental towards the indigenous people?"

Jiang Shan said in a respectful yet dignified tone, "Releasing Zheng Sen disrupts the enemy; keeping him in our hands disrupts ourselves."

"There really are quite a few people with 'Madonna Complex'..." General Wen commented on this but ceased to object.

The directive that Zheng Sen could be released had just been conveyed to Kinmen Island. As the person in charge of intelligence and political security on the front line, Xu Ke was also in favor of letting Zheng Sen go with both hands. Like many Elders, he felt that killing an eight-year-old child was really unjustifiable.

However, Xu Ke believed the release shouldn't be a simple release; otherwise, the Zheng group, the Ming Dynasty, and various coastal powers would think this was a sign of weakness and that the Senate feared the Zheng group. Therefore, the release had to have conditions attached, such as collecting a ransom—this was how they planned to handle the captured family members currently.

Now, since someone was willing to risk their life to rescue him, that was even better. It saved the trouble of demanding ransom. Why not go with the flow and let them escape?

Xu Ke decided to help them a little. As to whether they could escape, it depended on their luck and ability. If the escape failed, the "trouble" would be solved naturally, and no one would have anything to say.

While he was considering this, someone brought in a summary of the investigation into the deaths, injuries, and captures of middle and upper-level personnel of the Zheng group over the past few days. The General Staff currently required solid evidence for death records of important enemy figures, preferably a corpse or head for positive identification, or at least cross-referenced oral testimonies from multiple people on both sides.

According to this policy, they had currently compiled a list of middle and high-level personnel of the Zheng group killed in Operation Overlord. First on the long list of those killed was Zheng Zhilong's brother, Zheng Zhihu. This Zheng army's number one brave general, known for "Dragon's Wisdom and Tiger's Courage," defended to the last moment in the offensive and defensive battles on Kinmen Island. Even after his personal guards and servants were all killed or fled, he refused to flee despite being wounded by gunfire, and was finally bayoneted to death by the swarming Marines.

Below Zheng Zhihu was Zheng Zhilong's clan cousin Zheng Zhipeng, killed in the fireship battle. Aside from these two, several lesser-known members of the Eighteen Chi were also on the list.

Following them was a batch of names of main Zheng army generals. Xu Ke was familiar with many of these names. In the old timeline, some of them later surrendered to the Manchus and fought against their former comrades; others followed Zheng Koxinga north to Nanjing, west to conquer Taiwan, and either died on the battlefield or passed away with regrets... Behind every person was a story that historians could write volumes about.

Now, all of this would cease to exist. They had become just a cold string of names on this battle report. Xu Ke couldn't help but sigh.

As for Zheng Zhilong himself, there was still no complete evidence to prove his life or death. However, Zhang Tumu, who arrived from Kaohsiung yesterday, had the headless corpse exhumed and fingerprints taken. Xu Ke also sent men to Zheng Zhilong's residences in Anping and Zhongzuo Garrison to try and lift fingerprints from personal items in his inner chambers for comparison.

Before long, the identity of the mysterious headless corpse would be known. Xu Ke was ninety-nine percent sure this person was Zheng Zhilong.

He looked at the schedule on the desk. Exactly one week had passed since D-Day. The "Special Search" operations in Anping, Greater and Lesser Kinmen, Xiamen Island, and other places were drawing to a close. The seized gold, silver, and valuables had all been shipped out. Through interrogating prisoners and offering rewards for informers, the Planning Agency Special Search Team had unearthed dozens of hidden gold and silver hoards in Anping and other places, seizing 170,000 taels of gold and silver and 100,000 strings of cash.

A few days ago, an engineering unit using metal detectors was sent from Lingao specifically to conduct metal detection in the residences and government offices of important Zheng group figures in Anping and other places to see if there were any secret hoards left.

The search operation had shifted to bulk goods. With a spirit of "nothing in the world should be wasted," the Planning Agency Special Search Team began a large-scale search and clearance of less valuable bulk goods. Even various dilapidated ships abandoned in the harbor were not spared; they were patched up and towed away by tugboat teams. These ships would all be towed to Hong Kong to be dismantled for ship timber for new vessels.

Starting next week, the expeditionary force of Operation Overlord would begin a gradual withdrawal. Within a week, everyone, including prisoners and local civilians, would be transported to Kaohsiung for resettlement. Before that, Zheng Sen's escape had to be arranged.

He thought for a moment, rang the bell to summon the orderly, and had him summon the naturalized cadre responsible for the official prisoner camp and the labor camp informers to receive a task.

"Young Lord—"

"Call me Fusong," Zheng Sen stopped Tō Tarō who had snuck in from using the title, whispering, "Speak quickly."

"Yes!" Tō Tarō nodded excitedly. Having caught wind that the Vagabonds were about to flee and would take all prisoners with them before leaving, Tō Tarō decided that time was of the essence and he must launch the rescue immediately.

Originally, they intended to use the "substituting a plum for a peach" method, but gave it up because a reliable boy couldn't be found in a hurry. The Japanese mercenaries discussed it and decided that delay would be fatal, so they would use an inside-outside coordination approach to break out of prison directly.

They observed the perimeter of Camp Alpha beforehand. Camp Alpha was protected by two fences: the outer one was a bamboo fence made of sharpened bamboo poles, and the inner one was barbed wire.

The bamboo fence was easy to destroy. They had hidden sharp blades, and Honda was a master swordsman; cutting the bamboo fence was not a problem. The difficulty lay in the barbed wire inside. Not only was it covered in iron barbs, but it also had bells hung on it that would ring incessantly at the slightest disturbance. However, they soon found a countermeasure—Wang Dachui proposed digging a trench under the barbed wire with shovels to crawl under.

But this seemingly simple plan had an insurmountable obstacle: sentries patrolled between the two fences. Pairs of sentries walked along the path between the fences. No matter where they started digging, they wouldn't have enough time to dig the trench, get the person out, and refill it before the sentries circled back—if they didn't refill it, it would be discovered immediately, and once discovered, escape was impossible.

They also considered killing the sentries—but several watchtowers stood around Camp Alpha. Although simple, the sentries stood high above, seeing every move below clearly; it was hard to hide from them.

No matter how these men planned, they couldn't be sure of getting Fusong out silently.

Just as they were at their wits' end, things suddenly took a turn. Ning Liujin, who had been coerced by them into participating in this operation, said he found a suitable boy in the labor camp who was willing to be the Young Master's body double and go into Camp Alpha to swap him out—only he wanted fifty taels of silver for his parents.

"What do his parents do?"

"Just civilians on the island—his father is sick and can't work," Ning Liujin trembled so much he couldn't speak smoothly. "The family added a younger brother recently, too many mouths to feed, so he came to the labor camp to work. I saw him looking miserable all the time and working hard; probably short of money..."

As he spoke, he mentioned the boy's name, but Tō Tarō's group had no impression—there were many people in the labor camp from diverse sources; some weren't transferred from the prisoner camp but were island civilians responding to recruitment to earn money.

"This is a beheading offense; is he willing?" Wang Dachui played with the wakizashi in his hand. "Kid, are you trying to screw us?"

"Dare not, dare not..." Ning Liujin's face turned pale. "If it doesn't work, then forget it..."

"Tell me," Tō Tarō stopped Wang Dachui. "Why is he willing?"

"Master, this is buying a life with fifty taels of silver." Ning Liujin squeezed out a bitter smile. "Why wouldn't he be willing? His death could save his whole family—besides, he won't necessarily die."

Tō Tarō mused for a moment, then suddenly drew his wakizashi and stabbed fiercely towards Ning Liujin's ribs. Ning Liujin screamed, and a foul smell arose; he had lost control of his bowels and bladder.

But the tip of the blade didn't pierce his body; it only pierced his clothes, grazing the skin and passing through. Although it missed by a hair's breadth, Ning Liujin didn't lose a single hair.

Ning Liujin collapsed on the ground, trembling all over, unable to say a word.

"Did you inform the Vagabonds?"

"No... no... this lowly one dares not..." Ning Liujin kowtowed repeatedly.

"Bring that boy tonight," Tō Tarō said. "I want to question him personally."

That night, Ning Liujin indeed brought the boy. Tō Tarō saw his height and build were similar to Fusong's, only his skin was dark and rough, clearly from a poor peasant background. Fortunately, the swap would happen at night; this difference should be enough to fool the sentries.

Asking his age, he was much older than Fusong, already eleven. He did speak a fluent local dialect. Tō Tarō half-believed Ning Liujin's story. He questioned the boy repeatedly, threatening and tricking him, but the result was still the same story Ning Liujin told.

Tō Tarō was still skeptical. He called Honda over to discuss if it was a trap.

Honda's answer was simple: "If Ning Liujin informed on us, we and Young Master Fusong are already finished. Since we are not finished, we might as well gamble."
