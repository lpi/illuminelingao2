# Chapter 138: New System (Part 1)

"Finding them wives—let's shelve that for now." Ma Qianzhu said.

"Now let's discuss finding women for ourselves—"

"No, that's not for discussion either. I want to talk about labor utilization." Ma Qianzhu interrupted. "We've brought all these people to Bairren—feeding and housing them, making them work. Then what?"

"Then continue working, obviously."

"I mean—hmm—" He paused, choosing words carefully. "Land, labor systems, compensation, and governance structures."

Wen Desi requested to speak:

"Before discussing labor systems or such topics, I think we should first establish status hierarchies for natives. Otherwise, differential treatment can't be discussed."

Currently, transmigrators classified directly controlled native laborers into three tiers:

**Slaves:** No personal freedom; forced labor; provided clothing and food; no wages. Included captured prisoners—until screened and reformed, they remained at this level.

**Laborers:** Personal freedom; work assigned by transmigrators; free food and housing; currently also provided clothing. Transmigrators paid wages for labor.

**Workers:** Basically same as laborers—but 20% higher wages.

These tiers were mobile: slaves could be freed to laborer status; hardworking laborers could be promoted to worker status. Social mobility stabilized society—at least among the governed.

In Committee's plan, the "worker" class would become their ruling foundation—producing qualified industrial workers, low-level administrators, and soldiers.

Workers enjoyed benefits and were Committee's hope—but few laborers sought worker status. To date, workers numbered under one-quarter of Production Team One. Most still thought like hired hands—not truly ready to board the "pirate ship."

Where was the problem? Wu De concluded: the worker system's limited effectiveness was mainly insufficient incentives. Workers only got 20% extra wages. Though promised housing and private plots—nothing had materialized. Even first-wave workers still lived in tents and sheds like everyone else. As for private plots: Lingao's wastelands were abundant—but lacking irrigation infrastructure, required huge human labor. For laborers working 12+ hours daily—no time or energy for cultivation.

Finally, transmigrators still wore the "pirates" label. Though county officials now coexisted peacefully—this didn't mean locals recognized their legitimate rule. Getting 20% extra for the risk of "joining pirates"—risk-reward clearly disproportionate. Peasants might not understand economics—but could calculate such basic sums.

"Should we quickly seek amnesty? Become reassuring good short-hairs?"

"No—amnesty isn't that easy. Zheng Zhilong's amnesty took years to achieve—and he was a Fujian native with extensive local connections. We're complete outsiders. If officials view us as barbarians—same treatment as the Jurchen Wild Boar Skin—then there's nothing to negotiate."

The solution was reverse thinking. Since risk couldn't be reduced—increase rewards. When risk and reward balanced—naturally people would take risks. A nearby example: Zheng Zhilong continuously recruited sailors and soldiers in Fujian precisely because piracy brought greater benefits to locals.

"Currently, a mere 20% income increase doesn't create significant differentiation among laborers."

Starting point: implementing worker housing policy. Committee members who'd lived in rural China understood peasants' enormous enthusiasm for building houses. After household responsibility reform, improving peasants almost universally built new houses. Even today, many peasant families—despite children settled in cities—still built village houses for them.

Having one's own home—temporary dwellers couldn't feel belonging. Only with personal houses would people view places as homelands—striving to build and protect them. Otherwise, they were merely passing through—others' property meant nothing.

The production team housing under construction outside South Gate embodied this experiment. Committee instructed Engineering to build these as genuine villages—not mere collective dormitories.

Construction Group comprehensively considered rural habits, land efficiency, and material conservation—producing apartment building designs. Each building: three floors; three residential units per floor. Each unit: one 14㎡ bedroom, one 16㎡ main room, one 10㎡ kitchen. No in-unit toilets—shared toilet per floor. Sewage piped to biogas pools for treatment. No water or electricity or independent drainage—but designs reserved positions for future installation.

Apartments primarily housed families. These unit sizes were tight for large families—but suitable for 4–5 person households.

Buildings used brick-concrete construction. First-batch floor slabs were wooden; Engineering planned future use of precast concrete slabs—reducing fire risk.

"What about property rights?" Viewing blueprints and renderings—someone asked.

"Since land policy isn't finalized—temporarily, houses only get house deeds. After land policy confirmation—supplementary land deeds will be issued."

Land ownership had transmigrator disagreements: most wanted confirmed private ownership; some insisted on state ownership; others proposed copying this timespace's policy—selling land-use rights rather than ownership—minus the strange term limits.

Committee didn't plan welfare housing for laborers—free things were undervalued. Each unit cost sixty *liang* silver; anyone could buy; installment payments accepted; workers got 10% discount.

Needless to say—workers with mortgages would defend transmigrators' existence more than anyone—otherwise, their housing dreams would shatter. Committee members had seen local tenant farmers', laborers', and small farmers' housing conditions—such apartments were unattainable in several lifetimes.

"I have a question." Xiao Zishan asked. "Peasants typically raise livestock. For apartment residents—what about livestock? If they want pigs or chickens—they can't keep them in hallways?"

"Livestock sheds and pigsties are collective style." Project explainer Mei Wan clarified. "Separate from residences—better for hygiene. Similarly, this new village has collective granaries—minimizing pest and rodent losses."

"With such worker benefits—laborers will all want to convert. There should be conditions."

"Correct." Wu De nodded approvingly. "We need to make worker status somewhat difficult—creating competition."

His drafted worker application conditions:

1. Personnel with transmigrator-recognized specialized skills willing to serve. E.g., craftsmen, scholars, soldiers.

2. Those serving as laborers continuously 12+ months who wished to continue.

3. Those with major meritorious contributions.

"But currently having just worker and laborer levels to differentiate people is no longer suitable for us." Wu De said.

Regardless of differential treatment—labor models were identical collective labor. Except rare skilled craftsmen and intellectuals—most people worked according to daily dispatches based on various departments' labor requests, arranged by Wu De.

This system—during current massive construction—ensured sufficient labor for every priority project, while strengthening control over laborers.

As many enterprises prepared for production—specialized industrial workers would emerge. Industrial workers were specialized—daily dispatching was inconvenient for production organization, making specialized workforce training difficult.

Migrants from Gou Manor (Production Team Two) contained many family units—completely different from mostly single Team One. If men were laborers—what about women and children's status? Currently, many women and children also worked—how to calculate their wages? For families with multiple or young children—nurseries alone weren't practical. Nursery resources and expenses—which budget category?... Countless issues reminded Committee: they needed a civil administration system to manage their first batch of subjects.

Transmigrators had many choices for civil administration. Salt Field Village and Damei Village used village autonomy models—village committees managed affairs. This had ready templates—worked well. But under such systems, entrenched interests were too powerful—major positions would be monopolized by few. Most typically: Salt Field Village—politics almost entirely controlled by the Tan brothers. Though the Tan brothers were their protégés, seemingly loyal—still inferior to direct control.
