# Chapter 2002 - The Progressive Young Master Shi

Lying in bed, Huang Ping's eyes gleamed with alertness. He couldn't fall asleep for a while, his mind still full of the investigation's findings.

Though he hadn't studied tax law for very long, he still understood the concept of "tax avoidance."

Legal tax avoidance wasn't a modern concept—it existed in ancient times too. Take the most basic tax the government collected, the land levy: there were all sorts of tricks involved. The Huang family used to be "gentry" in Lingao, and Huang Ping had been the personal servant of the Second Young Master Huang, so he knew some of those tricks.

The Shi family's schemes weren't news to him: when the Australians changed the tax rules, the Shi family adapted accordingly—finding loopholes in the regulations.

"No wonder the old wealthy can keep getting richer and richer," Huang Ping thought. For ordinary common folk, just looking at these regulations would make their heads spin, let alone figuring out the angles.

The fact was, ordinary folk couldn't even read more than a few characters, much less parse these convoluted regulations!

Actually, though Zeng Juan's question today was somewhat embarrassing, it touched on the key to the Shi family's tax avoidance. This Second Young Master Shi had truly digested the tax code thoroughly: Sanya was tax-exempt. Property tax was administered by location—remit money from Guangzhou to Sanya, and naturally not a single fen of property tax need be paid. This move was not only clever but also quite difficult to execute: even among the major households in Guangzhou, few were familiar with the tax regulations, let alone aware of the tax incentive policies of Sanya, hundreds of li away. Yet the Shi family was remarkably well-informed!

It seemed the Shi family was even more formidable than the Liang family. Huang Ping thought to himself—no wonder Elder Wang sent him here to audit the accounts. At first, he'd thought it was making a mountain out of a molehill. The Elders truly saw things clearly!

The next day, Huang Ping requested the local tax department to mobilize copyists to transcribe Tianrui Garden's account books.

"All account books, transcribe every one," Huang Ping said. "And all transaction vouchers must be individually registered and catalogued."

Night had grown late, yet the lamp on the desk was still lit. Wang Qiyi rubbed his face and gulped down a large mouthful of strong tea just to feel somewhat awake. Working late into the night was something he detested, but when the report from Zeng Juan and Huang Ping's team arrived, two city government meetings were waiting for him. There was no choice but to push the report to tonight.

The situation was now clear. The Shi family had first transferred large amounts of liquid assets through Delong to their Sanya branch, Tianrui Garden, then used the advantages of the joint venture and investment incentives to relocate their main production to Sanya, achieving legal tax avoidance. But this was unavoidable—Sanya's tax exemptions for investment attraction had been established Council of Elders policy since Wang Luobin was in charge. While mainland merchants like the Shi family weren't numerous, countless merchants from various Hainan counties had established branch offices in Sanya or moved their businesses there entirely. The snow-white sugar, gorgeous silk and porcelain, the Australians' various novel goods, plus their enormous import demands—all of it made European nations pay increasing attention to this new trading port with a better location and lower tax rates. Sanya's positioning as a free port had also brought row upon row of Western trading houses along the main avenue, constantly expanding higher and wider.

The wind had grown cool, yet Wang Qiyi still gently fanned his palm-leaf fan. When property taxes were reassessed at the start of the year, the Shi family had produced Delong remittance receipts demanding exemption from the liquid capital amount estimated based on their real estate. Nobody paid attention at the time. If Meng Xian hadn't mentioned this case as an example over drinks, saying that their business format wasn't just good but excellent, Wang Qiyi probably would never have known about it. Joint venture, factory construction, remittance, transfer—the Shi family had walked these steps quite carefully and steadily.

Everything looked legal and proper—had his suspicions been unfounded? The Council of Elders' tax rates weren't high. To save these few taxes, going through all this trouble and even uprooting their original establishment didn't match the mentality of the typical natives who generally preferred stability. So where exactly was the problem?

His gaze returned to the account registers on his left that he'd just skimmed through. Zeng Juan and Huang Ping had transcribed a copy of the current period's general ledger and the subsidiary ledgers they deemed crucial. Their conscientious and diligent work attitude pleased Wang Qiyi. There weren't many registers—just two or three volumes. Wang Qiyi felt he shouldn't let his subordinates' hard work go to waste; he should read through them carefully.

Hmm? Isn't this cash flow a bit too high? Just as Wang Qiyi was preparing to give the Shi family a verdict of "law-abiding citizen," the cash flow of Tianrui Garden's Hong Kong warehouse in the final ledger made his eyes light up, and he sat bolt upright from his chair. Hong Kong warehouse... Sanya warehouse... workshop... raw materials... Wang Qiyi spread open all three ledgers and picked up his pen to compare them one by one.

So that's how it is! Before he'd even reached the final few figures, Wang Qiyi basically understood this Second Young Master Shi's sleight of hand. The warehouse Tianrui Garden leased on Hong Kong Island was nominally a transit warehouse for the Sanya factory's mainland operations. In reality, the Shi family was using it to play middleman, making large profits on the price differential. The silk products and porcelain the Shi family purchased from the mainland would be recorded in Tianrui Garden's books via telegraph, but the goods would only be shipped to the Hong Kong warehouse, then sold under Tianrui Garden's name. The payments were also remitted through Delong to Sanya, where they enjoyed the local reductions or even exemptions. Afterward, the tax clearance certificates would be brought via Dabo ferry to Hong Kong Customs for tax offset. Finally, buyers only needed to pick up the goods in Hong Kong or have the Shi family ship them abroad. Thanks to the tax exemption benefits, the Shi family could push down the prices at the Hong Kong warehouse considerably, so business was quite good—judging by the cash flow, sales had grown by more than ten percent in the past six months.

"Tsk tsk, Young Master Shi, oh Young Master Shi, your courage is still too small," Wang Qiyi twirled his pen, clicking his tongue with some regret. Why insist on selling under Tianrui Garden's name? Buy under the parent store's name, sell under the parent store's name, then record the sales revenue as accounts receivable at the parent store, while having buyers remit the actual payment directly to Tianrui Garden's account in Sanya. Tianrui Garden, as a branch, is still the same family as the Guangzhou store—moving goods between the two without payment wouldn't count as a sale. Why not take advantage of that? That way you wouldn't have to pay a single fen of business tax, which would be even better than the fifty percent reduction you're enjoying now in Sanya. Alas... what a pity, what a pity. Wang Qiyi shook his head, not quite satisfied.

Eh? Wait, I think my perspective has drifted. Tossing aside his pencil and reining in his wandering thoughts, Wang Qiyi stretched comfortably, then sank back into his chair. The Shi family's little scheme was clear now, but punishment was impossible. If one had to point out a problem, it would be that their tax registration didn't fully list their main business activities—operating beyond scope. The maximum fine would be just one or two taels of silver.

"Look at you, building your little fiefdoms, carving out territories. Talk about 'developing local economies,' but once you become a local official, you forget where your loyalties should lie. Now look at the results—compete and fight, exemptions still not enough, add subsidies too!" Wang Qiyi found himself increasingly enjoying a sense of schadenfreude and couldn't help laughing out loud. "Try to bypass the Finance and Taxation Bureau and do things yourself? Get ready to be slapped in the face by seventeenth-century natives!"

"Elder, what's so funny? Could it be that Elder Zhang is coming?" The guard who'd come in to pour water, Mi Suisui, seeing Wang Qiyi sitting there fanning himself and laughing alone, teased casually.

"What do you little brats know? Go play somewhere else." Wang Qiyi was quite good-tempered, especially with these young men not much older than his own daughter. "I'm writing a note—deliver it to Comrade Huang Ping's dormitory first thing tomorrow morning."

After sending off the guard, Wang Qiyi sipped his tea while considering whether to arrange to meet this Second Young Master Shi sometime. This young gentleman was capable—though tax matters ultimately came down to human affairs, with no conceptual barriers that couldn't be crossed, to so quickly apply the Council of Elders' epoch-spanning technological capabilities to tax avoidance, to precisely identify the gaps in tax management coordination—that was real talent. Such talent, left in the private sector to make money for his family, was too wasteful. He should be brought out to serve the Council of Elders. There had always been voices within the Council calling for sending people to Europe to engage in speculative trade, to fleece a few harvests. But it wasn't worthwhile for an Elder to go personally. Perhaps sending people like this would be better—let them fund themselves while the Council provided necessary intelligence. If they made money, the Council would take half; if they lost money...

He reined in his galloping thoughts. This matter deserved heavy emphasis in the internal report, to serve as a proper reminder to those Elder county and city leaders who howled as if their lives were being threatened at the mere mention of "coordinated management"—let them understand what "thinking nationally as a whole" meant. Want to bypass the Finance and Taxation Bureau and handle things yourself? Get ready to be schooled by seventeenth-century natives.

"Elder, someone came from Director Ai's side to ask if you've looked at the special expense application?" A messenger had arrived and stood at the doorway asking.

"What special expense regular expense?" Wang Qiyi was in the middle of drafting notes in his head and immediately lost his good temper at being interrupted.

"It's that 'Memorandum on Promoting Family Life for Naturalized Cadres' from Elder Du..."

"Oh, that one." Only then did Wang Qiyi come to his senses. Since they were operating under the banner of "Finance and Taxation Bureau," besides collecting money, they also had to spend money. Now that the system was gradually being perfected, some off-budget expenditures for Guangzhou City needed clear budgets and approvals for disbursement.

This so-called "Memorandum on Promoting Family Life for Naturalized Cadres" was issued by an Elder named Du Yibin, who was currently the County Administrator in Enping. By rights, Enping County's situation wasn't exactly stable—and somehow this Elder had inexplicably sent such a memorandum to Liu Xiang.

The content wasn't complicated, really. It was essentially about finding wives for the naturalized population.

The gender imbalance under Council of Elders' rule had persisted for a long time. Even after the Operation Engine large-scale population importation, the shortage of marriageable women and the sky-high bride prices remained unsolved. Never mind ordinary commoners—many male naturalized citizens didn't have wives either, becoming "leftover men."

Too many leftover men were an unstable factor for society. This was especially true for Fubo Army soldiers. Though they'd established something like a "Two-Five-Eight Regiment" marriage program for officers and senior NCOs, the reality was too many monks, too little porridge—there were still many who couldn't find spouses. As for ordinary soldiers, there was basically no hope.

Officers and soldiers served for many years, risking their lives. Not being able to even marry a wife, having to rely on monthly "joy tickets" to address their sexual needs, with no family life, no offspring—this had a great impact on morale.
