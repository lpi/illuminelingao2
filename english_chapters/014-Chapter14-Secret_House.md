# Chapter 14 - Secret House

Chapter 14 Secret House

The Transmigrators were busy establishing a camp on the tidal flats of Bopu Harbor. Meanwhile, in Guangzhou, Master Gao was experiencing a "thrill" he had never had before.

According to the agreement with Wen Desi, Master Gao was responsible for receiving the first batch of "advance personnel" of the Transmigrators in Guangzhou and arranging for them to stay in that secret house.

Late at night, Master Gao came to the backyard of the secret house with a few trusted servants.

"Master, will they really come?" A servant asked tremblingly holding a lantern.

"They will definitely come." Master Gao pretended to be calm, but his palms were sweating.

Suddenly, a strange light appeared in the center of the yard. The light grew brighter and brighter, forming a huge aperture.

"Coming! Coming!" The servants were so scared that they retreated.

A figure walked out of the aperture. It was Wen Desi.

"Master Gao, long time no see." Wen Desi smiled and greeted.

"Master Wen, you are finally here." Master Gao hurriedly went up to him.

Following Wen Desi, people walked out of the aperture one after another. There were men and women, all carrying big bags and small bags, looking dusty.

These were members of the Guangzhou Station sent by the Transmigrators. Their task was to establish an intelligence and commercial network in Guangzhou to provide support for the base in Lingao.

Among them were Guo Yi (leader of the commercial group), Lin Baiguang (intelligence officer), and a few female members.

"There are... so many people?" Master Gao was a bit dumbfounded. There were dozens of people! How could this small yard accommodate them?

"Don't worry, Master Gao." Wen Desi comforted, "We will only stay here temporarily. We will disperse after dawn."

"That's good, that's good." Master Gao wiped his sweat.

Wen Desi introduced the person in charge of Guangzhou Station, Guo Yi, to Master Gao: "This is Manager Guo. He will be responsible for all business contacts with you in the future."

Master Gao looked at this young "Manager Guo". He looked refined and polite, much easier to deal with than the unfathomable Wen Desi.

"Manager Guo, please give me your advice in the future."
"Master Gao is polite. We rely on your care."

After exchanging pleasantries, everyone began to busy themselves with settling down.

The interior of this secret house had been transformed by Master Gao. The original furniture was moved away, replaced by bunk beds to maximize accommodation capacity.

"Conditions are a bit rough, everyone just make do." Guo Yi said to the team members.

"It's better than sleeping on the beach." A team member joked.

In the next few days, the members of Guangzhou Station began to act in batches.

Some went to rent new houses and shops as open activity strongholds.
Some went to the market to investigate prices and business information.
Some began to make friends with people from all walks of life to collect intelligence.

Master Gao observed the actions of these "Australians" with cold eyes and was secretly frightened.

These people acted in a disciplined and planned manner, with clear division of labor and efficient execution. They were definitely not ordinary merchants or refugees.

Especially that Lin Baiguang, who wandered around tea houses and restaurants all day, chatting with all kinds of people. In just a few days, he figured out the situation of the officials and merchants in Guangzhou city clearly.

"These Australians have great ambitions!" Master Gao sighed in his heart.

One day, Guo Yi found Master Gao: "Master Gao, we want to buy some servants."

"Servants?" Master Gao was stunned, "You have so many people, why do you still need servants?"

"We are all scholars and businessmen, not good at rough work." Guo Yi explained, "Moreover, we need some locals to help us handle some chores and run errands."

"Oh, I see." Master Gao nodded, "This is easy. There is a human market in the west of the city. There are plenty of people selling themselves as slaves."

"We want young, healthy, honest and obedient ones." Guo Yi added, "Preferably those innocent families who can't survive."

"No problem. I'll ask Steward Yan to take you there."

Steward Yan took Guo Yi and a few team members to the human market in the west of the city.

This was a place full of misery. Skinny men, women and children were inserted with straw marks (a sign of selling oneself) on their heads, squatting by the roadside waiting for buyers. Their eyes were numb and hopeless.

Looking at this scene, the Transmigrators felt heavy in their hearts. Although they knew that life in ancient times was hard, seeing it with their own eyes still shocked them.

"This is the feudal society!" A female team member whispered, tears welling up in her eyes.

"Put away your sympathy." Lin Baiguang said coldly, "We are here to survive and develop, not to be philanthropists. Buying them is the greatest saving for them."

Guo Yi nodded and began to select.

He followed the principle of "better lack than abuse" and selected more than a dozen young men and women. These people looked relatively healthy and had clear eyes, not like slick people.

After paying the money and signing the contract of selling oneself, these people became the first batch of "servants" of the Transmigrators.

Guo Yi took them back to the secret house, let them take a bath, change into clean clothes, and gave them a full meal.

"From today on, you are the people of our Australian firm." Guo Yi said to them, "As long as you work hard and are loyal, we will not treat you badly. You will have food to eat, clothes to wear, and wages to take."

These new servants looked at the white rice and fat meat in front of them, seemingly in a dream. They knelt down and kowtowed: "Thank you, Master! Thank you, Master!"

Looking at the dark heads on the ground, Guo Yi felt a sense of responsibility rising in his heart.

Starting from this secret house, the power of the Transmigrators began to take root in the most prosperous city of the Great Ming.
