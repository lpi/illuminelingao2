# Chapter 371 - The Foshan Journey (Part 20)

Liu San's Foshan journey could be called a fully-loaded return. Not only had he procured enough raw materials to make summer medicines, he'd also purchased many precious medicinal ingredients rarely found in Lingao or even Qiongzhou—especially musk, bezoar, and rhinoceros horn. The musk was particularly notable: all from Henan's Dushengxing, a firm renowned for genuine goods. Liu San had previously only seen samples of this brand's musk in university reference collections. Seeing it now with his own eyes and actually purchasing some—his excitement was considerable.

Even the *pian zai huang* he coveted was obtained. This medicine was retailed through a Foshan pharmacy at extremely high prices—one tael of silver bought only a small sliver. Even then, Liu San wanted to buy more but was refused—stock was limited, with a five-piece per customer limit.

"Sold it all to you, sir, what would people with emergencies do?" The clerk firmly declined. "This can save lives!"

Liu San left dejected, though he rather admired this traditional commercial ethic.

As for various Chinese medicine processing equipment, he bought countless items. Plus the many pharmacy clerks recruited. Yang Shixiang was somewhat alarmed: grantedRunshitang had done several big deals, but surely they didn't need this much manpower and equipment?

"Elder brother, before long you'll find we don't have enough." Liu San smiled with extreme confidence. Yang Shixiang wanted to counsel restraint. Then he reflected: though this man was very agreeable and they'd become sworn brothers, he was an out-and-out "cropped-head." And every cropped-head was supremely self-confident—understandably so, given their accomplishments.

Thinking how since befriending this Doctor Liu, his fortunes had steadily improved and even his business dealings had become remarkably smooth—Yang Shixiang didn't know Li Yongxun's affair was pure coincidence, assuming Liu San had hidden cards he'd played only when seeing his brother resist. His admiration for these Australians now bordered on worship.

As long as the Australians remained in Lingao, his business would surely prosper ever more. Yang Shixiang could vaguely feel this.

Before leaving Foshan, there was naturally more socializing. Hearing of their departure, Yang clan elders each hosted a farewell banquet. Even Lin Ming sent gifts. Three days of farewell wine before they finally set out.

Foshan to Guangzhou was only a few dozen *li* by water. Liu San's party didn't need to escort goods; the seven or eight masters and servants hired a river clipper for the return journey. Qiwei handled everything, and by this era's standards, the trip was quite convenient and comfortable. The connections at every stage were remarkably precise, making Liu San suspicious—did Qiwei have radio transmitters?

"Nothing unusual about it." The "full-escort"—yes, that was the exact term, not "armed escort," since this man's job wasn't bodyguard work.

"All by carrier pigeon." He explained.

Using their year-old network, Qiwei had integrated its branches, waystations, cart shops, boat services, and warehouses. At major junctions throughout the province, they established relay stations. Information was transmitted by carrier pigeon three times daily—morning, noon, and evening. Not as good as telephone or telegraph, but remarkably accurate for the times.

Reaching Guangzhou, they boarded the *Guangjia*. The Foshan-purchased medicines had already arrived at Qiwei's pier warehouse. The escort handed over the warehouse receipt. Liu San and Yang Shixiang verified nothing was missing or damaged, stamped the form, and loaded the ship. Even Liu San was impressed by the efficiency.

The party took the Gao Guang Shipping line back to Lingao. Just entering port, they saw the newly renovated passenger pier already had fences up, plus several new stone buildings. Several people in Naval uniforms stood watch at the fence.

After descending the gangplank, they realized these dark-skinned natives weren't Navy at all. Each wore an armband reading: "Customs."

"How novel." Liu San remarked. Though he'd known Customs was established during the institutional restructuring and a man named Ma Jia was appointed Customs Chief, Customs had always had weak presence among transmigrators. For quite a while, the Customs Bureau consisted only of Ma Jia plus one native customs officer.

Ma Jia had painfully discovered his impressive-sounding Customs had nothing to do. First, transmigrator imports and exports required no duty or tonnage tax. The Naval Department was the local maritime hegemon; the "one-fifth" tribute from fishermen wasn't their affair. As for the few merchants trading in Lingao—the Trade Department had adopted tax-free policies to encourage them. Besides, most were petty traders with little worth taxing. Ma Jia looked at his *Customs Law* and *Customs Tariffs* and could only sigh to the heavens.

Equally downcast was Fu Bowen—yes, the Ninth-Rank minor military officer of Bo-pu Patrol Inspector who had fled into the county town after D-Day. This petit official had lost all face and couldn't stay in the city anymore. Under County Magistrate Wu's stern prodding, Fu Bowen neither dared resist nor willing to lose his rice bowl, and after much hesitation had reluctantly returned to Bo-pu.

The "cropped-head rebels" were quite generous. They welcomed his return—part of a private agreement between the parties. The transmigrator collective honored the treaty, returning the Patrol Inspector's original building, even leaving the installed glass windows intact. Electricity was gone, but they generously provided a gas lamp.

Even his twelve-archer establishment was restored—though "restored" was in quotation marks. The transmigrators had provided a ready-made twelve-man squad. Fu Bowen knew none of them—all transmigrator-selected men, essentially serving Ma Jia. This squad brazenly moved into the Patrol Inspector station, drawing Patrol Inspector pay. Fu Bowen wisely gave them no orders.

Thus the transmigrator Customs and the Ming Patrol Inspector coexisted in one place—essentially two signs, one staff. All current taxation and passenger inspection was done under the Bo-pu Patrol Inspector's name. Fu Bowen was like certain nominal leaders: just signing papers without handling actual operations.

Fu Bowen understood his position perfectly. He was a hollow figurehead. And everyone around was hostile territory—especially after his recent trip home, where he personally witnessed rows of head-boxes at the county gate. Those names that once made children cry and cities close their gates—now their heads were neatly displayed in wooden cages on poles, grimacing while crows pecked at them.

These cropped-heads could eliminate even the most troublesome bandits—what was a small county city to them? Fu Bowen simply went with the flow. Each morning he drank tea, practiced swordplay, read books, and perused the cropped-heads' newspapers. Meals were at the Bo-pu cafeteria—decent food, sometimes with excellent wine, better than county wine shops. He'd developed a taste for convenient paper cigarettes, abandoning his old dry-tobacco pipe.

He arranged for family to exchange some of his monthly salary for Lingao Grain Circulation Vouchers for consumption. Before he knew it, this spending kept growing until his meager salary could barely cover it. At which point Ma Jia would discreetly provide some vouchers. Fu Bowen accepted without qualms—accepting money was official custom.

Ma Jia seemed idle. Besides drafting various customs regulations and maritime law provisions, he occasionally visited Fu Bowen's station—part of his assignment, monitoring this Ming minor official stationed at a sensitive transmigrator location.

This day, Ma Jia and Fu Bowen were playing chess. Midway through, a customs officer burst in:

"Chief Ma! Cargo's arrived!"

"Cargo?!" Ma Jia leapt up. "Cargo arrived" meant large taxable shipments—a first for Bo-pu Customs.

"No tax exemption certificate?"

"None. I asked the *Guangjia* people—the shipper is the owner of this county's Runshitang. This cargo was imported from Foshan. Worth a fortune. All medicines!"

"Stay calm." Ma Jia ordered. "Have Ji An meet me at the pier."

Ji An had recently been promoted from ordinary transmigrators. With ten years as a customs broker, he knew import-export procedures better than regulation-quoting Ma Jia.

"Master Fu, I'll be right back." He excused himself and hurried to the pier. Ji An was already there.

"How does it look?"

"Needs appraisal." Ji An said. "Then check the tariff schedule."

"Just ask the cargo value." Ma Jia's head hurt at appraisal—commodity manuals had everything, but no one could identify these medicines...

"Without invoices here, how do we verify truthfulness?" Ji An was speaking when Liu San, who'd already cleared customs, came running back.

"What's going on?"

"Collecting import duty." Ma Jia was quite excited. "Finally we have major imports..."

"These are Health Department pharmaceutical materials!" Liu San nearly jumped. "You're taxing this too?"

"Isn't this Runshitang's cargo?" Ma Jia asked. "If it were Health Department imports, there'd be a Health Department notification. Besides, this shipment is clearly Runshitang's!"

"It's Health Department cargo. Runshitang is now a Health Department joint-venture enterprise." Liu San argued confidently. "Taxing goods crucial to public health and popular welfare?"

"Never heard of it." Ma Jia shook his head. Ji An shook his too. The Health Department-Runshitang joint venture had been approved by the Executive Committee and registered with the Foreign Trade Committee, but hadn't been formally notified to various agencies. Customs naturally didn't know.

"Call External Trade Committee—we're registered there."

Phone calls confirmed the registration. But both sides disagreed about whether joint ventures were fully tax-exempt. The Executive Committee had never specifically clarified this. However, the Women's Cooperative enterprises all paid business tax and income tax. Ma Jia believed this precedent showed: enterprises with private shares weren't tax-exempt. Runshitang had native half-ownership, so naturally import duties applied.

Liu San refused. While goods were half-owned by Yang Shixiang and profitable, fundamentally Runshitang served the transmigrator collective. Taxing it would dampen merchant enthusiasm.

Ji An held a third view. Since Runshitang was jointly operated with the collective, and general medicines were for public health, taxation was unnecessary. But ginseng and deer antler—purely tonics, luxury goods—should definitely be taxed at high rates. He proposed taxing this portion at higher rates.

Three people, three opinions, faces flushed with argument. Fortunately Yang Shixiang had gone to supervise unloading and missed this dispute.

Finally, after Executive Committee coordination, they agreed: prioritize merchant courtesy, with all duties waived. The entire medicine shipment cleared customs. But per Ma Jia's insistence, the shipper had to pay unloading fees—transmigrator dock workers weren't free for private service.

Ma Jia signed the release but remained wary of Liu San's behavior. Recently the transmigrator collective had developed some unhealthy tendencies. Starting with Navy private clubs and Army following suit, every department was scheming. This joint venture—wouldn't it be Health Department's profit-making "tertiary industry"?

Yang Shixiang was unconcerned—he'd never expected loading costs to be covered anyway.

Goods unloaded, he sent a servant to ask about hiring porters locally. Liu San said:

"No need for that trouble. There's a noon ox-cart to Bairren City. From there, anywhere's convenient."
