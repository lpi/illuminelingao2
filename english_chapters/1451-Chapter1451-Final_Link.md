# Chapter 1451 - Final Link

Mu Min stayed at Su Wan's place until very late before returning to the Police Headquarters. It was less than two hours before dawn, so Mu Min took a nap on the rattan chair in her office.

An hour later, the telephone rang ear-piercingly.

"So sorry to call you so early," the voice on the phone was Salina, "The identification report for the railing sent over is out. It has what you want."

"It's okay," Mu Min was fully awake, "I'll come over right now."

The so-called Identification Center was actually just a few small rooms in the Police Headquarters, containing some big, black, and rough experimental equipment produced in Lingao. The identification methods here were few and backward. Limited by equipment and personnel, some identifications had to be done at the Heavy Industry Central Laboratory. However, even these pitiful means were enough to dominate in this time-space.

Salina was wearing an isolation gown, wearing protective goggles and a mask produced in Lingao, and her gloved hands were carefully manipulating the rotten wooden stick on the table.

Salina's position as Director of the Identification Center was purely forcing a duck onto a perch—the logic of this appointment was that the identification technology level of US law enforcement agencies was much more advanced than China's, so the pigs Salina had seen must be much more than the pigs Ran Yao, Mu Min, and these domestic police officers had seen.

Salina did not disappoint, learning and applying flexibly, managing to open this Identification Center somehow. Of course, relying solely on reading books and watching CSI, the experience of former police officers was far from enough. Many technical means used by this center still relied on the support of professionals from the Biology and Chemistry Laboratories of the Council of Elders.

"Found something good?"

"Complete fingerprints, you'll definitely like them." Salina giggled and picked up a sample box from the table, containing several small glass slides for extracting fingerprints, "The fingerprints are very clear, simply perfect. Although we don't know whose they are, it can be seen that they were left by a person holding this railing with both hands."

"Holding the railing?!"

"Quite correct." Salina smiled meaningfully and made a baseball swing motion.

Mu Min thought of the autopsy report and Su Wan's analysis. Lin Xiaoya's abdominal bleeding was caused by being beaten before falling. In this way, the murderer had used this railing as a stick to commit the assault.

Mu Min put on gloves and looked carefully at this railing. From the diameter, length, and weight, it was easy to hold and wave. In fact, its weight wasn't very heavy; the wood used for the railing wasn't any high-quality wood to begin with.

"The railing was actually corroded and broken. Although there was also external force, the external force was small—just a light snap could break it." Salina pointed to a blackened and decayed fracture.

"What about the other end?"

"Both ends of the railing are fixed by being stuffed into holes in the stone balustrade. After the railing cracked from the middle, it was easy to pull out. Very handy as a weapon."

Mu Min nodded. She had roughly outlined the process of the entire case: the murderer arranged to meet Lin Xiaoya on the roof of the Service Agency for a talk, then attacked her with this stick. After seriously injuring her, pushed her off the roof to her death.

This could explain why the autopsy results showed both abdominal injuries and back injuries. She didn't commit suicide, nor was she simply pushed to fall to the ground.

Judging from the location of the crime, the disposal afterwards, and this "locally sourced" weapon, it was very likely an impulsive killing rather than a premeditated murder.

"Pity we don't have a fingerprint database! And no suspects. Unless we check against fingerprint files one by one—"

"No, we already have a suspect." Mu Min shook her head, "But I have to spend a few days applying to get the fingerprints—I'm afraid I might not even be able to get the fingerprints."

Salina's movement paused for a moment: "Really related to an Elder?"

Mu Min answered with a nod.

"Too shameful. Scum of humanity!" Salina cursed through gritted teeth.

"Any other discoveries?"

"None. No footprints were collected on the roof, nor any valuable fragments—if we had an evidence vacuum cleaner, DNA lab, we could definitely collect more powerful evidence..." Salina said with some regret.

"The evidence is actually enough." Mu Min said, "Next depends on the law."

Salina hesitated for a moment and asked: "Cheng Cheng told me that even if we can collect enough evidence to prove that an Elder committed murder, the Elder won't be held legally responsible—"

Mu Min frowned: "Who is Cheng Cheng?"

"I can't pronounce her full name, the pronunciation is too complicated. She works in the Great Library and is Panpan's friend."

"Did you talk to her about this case?"

"No, I know the rules here—police all over the world possess no right to casually tell others about case details." Salina shook her head.

Mu Min realized that the case must have been told to Cheng Yongxin by Panpan. She didn't know Cheng Yongxin, but whoever she was, she and the Great Library obviously had nothing to do with this case—Panpan's behavior was problematic. To put it seriously, it was a severe violation of discipline.

"Don't mention this matter to anyone else for now, okay?"

"What if Director Ran asks?"

"Then tell him whatever you know." Mu Min knew that pure-blooded Europeans and Americans like her were a delicate existence within the Council of Elders group, and it was not suitable to complicate their situation.

"OK, but you still haven't answered my question, Mu. Elders don't have to be responsible?"

"Strictly speaking, they still have to be responsible, just very lightly. Have you read the Common Program?"

"No, my reading of Chinese legal documents is not good enough yet..." Salina said, "That is to say, Elders will only receive very light punishment, even symbolic?"

Mu Min nodded: "Roughly so." She realized the subsequent conversation would become very sensitive because Salina was the first "victim" of this law. Continuing deeply, she would lose control of the direction.

"What a barbaric law." Salina was indignant, "Despicable! Shameful! Inhumane!"
"This is the decision of the Council of Elders." Mu Min unconsciously glanced outside the door, "Don't forget you are also an Elder."

Mu Min decided not to bullshit here any longer, to avoid getting herself wrapped in. She returned to her office, first asked her secretary to send an urgent cipher telegram to Ran Yao who was in Wenchang, reporting on the progress of the entire case investigation, then asked for instructions on whether to enter the stage of investigating the Elder.

After sending the telegram, Mu Min took a nap. When she woke up, it was already bright daylight. She asked her secretary to buy breakfast and began to organize a complete set of materials. When the materials were almost organized, the Confidential Room sent Ran Yao's reply urgent telegram.

There were only two words on it: "Agreed."

She immediately instructed her secretary to call the General Affairs Office duty room to make an appointment with Xiao Zishan for her.

"Tell the duty room, I am free at any time."

Every time Xiao Zishan met an Elder, regardless of who came, he would stand up to welcome, smiling all over his face, exchanging warm greetings whether acquainted or not—never giving people the feeling of cold treatment.

Mu Min's appointment this time was treated the same as usual. After exchanging greetings for a moment, he invited Mu Min to sit on the rattan chair in the office. The secretary brought two cups of General Affairs Office special supply mineral water—too many people came and went in the General Affairs Office, so to implement the principle of frugal office work, tea and beverages were uniformly not prepared.
"Presumably Director Xiao also knows why I came to visit," Mu Min didn't know what plans Xiao Zishan had on this matter, or what agreement had been reached within the Executive Committee, so she opened her mouth carefully, "It's about the 831 case."

"Of course, of course." Xiao Zishan leaned forward slightly, "So, there is progress in the case."

"Yes. Because the case is relatively major and involves an Elder, I wanted to report to you first. I hope to get your support on some matters..."

"You are too polite," Xiao Zishan nodded, "Please speak. As long as it is within my ability, I will definitely not refuse."

Immediately, Mu Min roughly described her investigation situation of the case:

"...The case details are roughly like this. Currently, the chain of evidence has basically formed. If we want to continue the investigation work, we must be allowed to summon Elder Yang and his life secretary."

She opened the confidential briefcase, took out a file bag stamped with "Top Secret" from inside, and placed it on the tea table in front: "This is all the investigation materials on the case so far."

"If the Executive Committee decides to make other arrangements for this case—"

"No, the Executive Committee has no new arrangements for this," Xiao Zishan smiled and did not take the file bag on the tea table, "The Executive Committee's attitude towards the 831 case has always been consistent, which is to find out the truth."

His fingers tapped lightly on the file bag: "I won't accept this document for now. The Executive Committee wants a formal case investigation report. Since you want to ask Elder Yang a few questions, I will arrange a special meeting. Wait for my notice. As for his life secretary, you can summon her at any time—the General Affairs Office will communicate well with him."

"Thank you. In addition, *Lingao Times* has requested to interview the progress of the case several times. Currently, we have declined on the grounds that the case is under investigation. But Panpan is pushing very hard from her side, and always with sets of rhetoric—can we reveal some case details appropriately?"

"It's not appropriate to report case details before the truth is out, right? I don't approve. Hasn't the Propaganda Department already issued a document explicitly forbidding reporting on this case?"

"I understand. Thank you, Director Xiao."

"You are welcome. Serve the Council of Elders!"

Sending away Mu Min, Xiao Zishan considered for a long while on the rattan chair, then made a phone call to the Arbitration Tribunal:

"Ma Jia? I want to meet with you—there is a matter that is quite tricky and may involve an Elder. Want to consult the opinion of your Law Society. Yes, I know the *Common Program*, but this matter looks a bit like undercurrents surging. It's not something we can muddle through just by holding a copy of the *Common Program*."
