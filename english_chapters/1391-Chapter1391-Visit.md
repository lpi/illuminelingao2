Phoenix Mountain Villa had specialized ice cellars, not only storing ice but also storing large amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables, and meat. The fresh lychees of Phoenix Mountain Villa were quite famous within Hangzhou's gentry circle. Although the prices were outrageously high and purchases were limited, one still had to pre-order to buy them.

The guests munched on lychees while tasting fine wine and delicacies, all of them becoming tipsy. Seeing that the masters' spirits were up, Cai Shi quickly went down to call the songstresses up to serve.

The trend of performing plays was extremely prevalent in the late Ming Dynasty. Almost all gentry and wealthy families kept their own opera troupes, but Zhao Yingong disliked the high expenses of keeping an opera troupe—just preparing "costumes" and hiring instructors were huge expenses. If the Council of Elders knew, it would inevitably be another disturbance. Back then, a few people at Leizhou Station were yelled at and threatened with death just for getting a few more maidservants.

But not keeping an opera troupe made dealing with gentry somewhat inconvenient. "Australian gadgets" were still relatively weak in entertainment. So Zhao Yingong kept a team of female musicians.

These female musicians were all carefully selected from refugees selling themselves. Each practiced a type of traditional instrument. The Council of Elders didn't object to this matter; after all, there was the excuse of cultivating traditional music talents, which was very attractive to certain Senators who liked to "express feelings for tradition." The maid training class also intentionally included musical instruments in the maid training curriculum.

Zhao Yingong also intended to curry favor with the General Office, sparing no expense to invite famous teachers from performance troupes to teach. Now although their skills were still a bit immature, the masters listening to the music only used this for pastime—the drunkard's intention was not on the wine.

A middle-aged servant woman in green led six girls over, bowing together to the banquet. All were young girls with double-bun hairstyles, the younger ones thirteen to fifteen, the older ones sixteen or seventeen, all wearing sky-blue tight-sleeved shirts and pale red sleeveless jackets. They were truly delicate and refined, free from vulgarity. Each held a musical instrument in hand, gracefully bending knees before the banquet. Their postures were graceful; no matter how knowledgeable and experienced the masters were, their expressions couldn't help but be moved.

"This greeting ceremony is quite unique. Is it Brother Zhao's family etiquette?" Wen Huai was greatly amused.

"This is a new custom from Guangdong." Zhao Yingong said with a smile, then suddenly frowned and asked: "What, only brought six people over?"

The servant woman seemed a bit uneasy, bowed her head and reported: "Replying to Master, Miss Xihua said they missed too many classes practicing songs these days, fearing delaying their studies, so she kept them back."

Zhao Yingong showed displeasure, slowly put down the cup in his hand, stared at the servant woman and said: "She said that?"

Under his gaze, the servant woman could hardly stand, barely supporting herself from kneeling down, and trembled: "This servant dares not lie."

Zhao Yingong was silent for a moment and said: "Withdraw."

The servant woman retreated hurriedly. Under the tree beside the banquet, twelve round stools were originally placed, now only half were occupied, looking somewhat empty. Wu Zhixiang felt Zhao Yingong lost some face and hurriedly said: "Let's listen to the music first."

Zhao Yingong nodded slightly. The clapper knocked lightly a few times; pipa and zither started first, followed by someone accompanying with flute and xiao. Tuning strings slightly, a burst of light, gentle, slow, and smooth melody rose leisurely like flowing water and floating clouds.

However, among those present, except Wen Huai who was from a well-off family, the others had at least kept a few female musicians at home. Upon listening, they felt the level of these few little girls of the Zhao family was at most "passable." They couldn't help but be secretly surprised. Master Zhao's usage and enjoyment were famously high-end and grand in Hangzhou; unexpectedly, the female musicians at home were just so-so—disappointed expressions appeared on their faces.

Although the female music was not excellent, fortunately, it didn't affect the masters' leisure mood for resting. After some toasting and exchange, the several masters who were already slightly drunk were supported down, and sedan chairs were arranged for them to go home respectively.

Only this Wu Zhixiang was unwilling to bid farewell—he had another purpose for coming here.

Shortly after Zhao Yingong's filature went into production, the raw silk produced had quietly flowed into the market. To see the market reaction to this kind of raw silk, Zhao Yingong quietly sent people to sell a batch of raw silk anonymously to "weaving workshops" to collect user feedback. As a result, this batch of raw silk received great acclaim as soon as it appeared. This silk not only belonged to top-grade "fine silk" but was also whiter, finer, and smoother than the best "Qili Silk" on the market.

The key was that the price of this silk was quite low, only ten percent more expensive than the locally produced "fat silk."

Whether it was silk guild bosses or weaving workshop owners, they were all attracted by this cheap and high-quality raw silk for a time, inquiring everywhere where this raw silk came from. But this raw silk disappeared without a trace—although the raw silk price on the market had begun to rise slowly after thorough exploitation of sericulture households, the price was still on the low side. Moreover, Zhao Yingong's purpose for reeling silk himself was for export; checking the general market reaction was enough.

Wu Zhixiang, however, immediately guessed where this raw silk was produced—unlike other Jiangnan gentry closely associated with Zhao Yingong, Wu Zhixiang had dealt with "Australians" much more in Guangzhou and seen much more Australian goods. He had also visited the Great World construction site in Guangzhou and been to several new "factories" opened by Guangzhou Station. He deeply knew the Australians' "ingenious skills" were far above everyone else. This was most likely made by an Australian factory. And the matter of Cihui Hall running a filature was registered in the prefecture yamen, not a secret. Wu Zhixiang understood completely with a little association.

Although Wu Zhixiang was regarded as a profligate son of a rich family, he actually had some ambition to do a career. It was just that he naturally wasn't the material for studying, always very difficult in imperial examinations. Although there was some progress in seeking official position in Jiangnan this time, it seemed eventually he could only enter officialdom through the path of Imperial College student—this kind of background was very looked down upon in officialdom at that time. So Wu Zhixiang was no longer very enthusiastic about becoming an official.

Attracted by Australians, initially, it was just for those playthings of "ingenious skills." Slowly, Wu Zhixiang developed a strong interest in Australians as a whole. Especially the Australians using their skills seizing the power of creation to create much more wealth than before, doing things predecessors could hardly do—this shocked Young Master Wu especially.

Australians are also human, I am also human, and we are all of Huaxia lineage. What they can do, I can also do. Wu Zhixiang didn't know since when he harbored such a thought in his heart.

Wu Zhixiang lived in Guangzhou for a long time and intended to do foreign firm business. He knew the sericulture industry in the Pearl River Delta also had considerable scale, only the raw silk quality was inferior to Jiangnan, and export price was also inferior to "Nanjing Silk." If he could get Australians' help to raise silkworms and reel silk in the Pearl River Delta, maybe he could open up a new situation!

"You want to visit Cihui Hall's filature?" Zhao Yingong was a bit surprised—he had never met a Ming "upper class person" interested in factory workshops. let alone upper class, even ordinary common people had no interest.

"Exactly! Brother Zhao please fulfill little brother's wish!" Wu Zhixiang looked sincere, "Little brother knows the newest raw silk on market is produced by Cihui Hall. To tell the truth: Little brother also wants to set up industry in Guangdong!"

"Easy to say, easy to say." Zhao Yingong's brain spun a few circles quickly. Wu Zhixiang belonged to "pro-Australia personnel." From risking warning Guangzhou Station in the past to actively selling rice to Hangzhou Station and buying shares in Merchants Bureau this time, all fully proved this person was "heart turning to Council of Elders."

Of course, his attempt was nothing more than relying on Council of Elders to start industry and manage to get rich. But being able to realize Council of Elders' advanced nature in technology and productive forces was already commendable, belonging to "object that can be reformed and united." And Council of Elders itself also intended to spread private light industry in Pearl River Delta region. If people like Wu Zhixiang were willing to come out and invest, the change and driving force to the whole social level atmosphere would be huge.

"No harm letting you see—only if inside information of this filature spreads out, sending I am an outsider here after all, afraid some things ignorant mob might be shocked and discuss..."

"Little brother swears to heaven, absolutely won't tell outsiders anything about this place." Wu Zhixiang said solemnly.

If it were anyone else, Zhao Yingong wouldn't trust this kind of oath. But Wu Zhixiang was after all a local who passed tests of Guangzhou Incident and Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign back then. Although not counting as "comrade," at least he was "fellow traveler" level. Immediately agreed to Wu Zhixiang's request.

Going down the mountain this time, Zhao Yingong didn't call for a sedan chair. The two walked down the mountain together. Phoenix Mountain Villa's location wasn't high and steep, and had stone paved paths built. Walking down took only twenty minutes. Zhao Yingong intentionally didn't use sedan chair or litter, just wanting to see if this young master was lazy physically.

Lazy people couldn't do practical work. No matter how much capital and sincerity he had, he could only be a paying "shareholder." Only people who could do practical work could become Council of Elders' "collaborators."

On the way Wu Zhixiang was full of interest, lingering on scenery along way from time to time, also chatting about his own ideas with Zhao Yingong occasionally. Arriving at foot of mountain, two people walked a long way under scorching sun without shelter, yet he showed no look of fatigue or boredom. He had vibrant vitality that many local young scholars didn't have. This made Zhao Yingong appreciate him quite a bit.

Two people arrived at factory gate. Here smell of coal smoke and waste water stink could already be smelled. A burst of strong stink attacked, Wu Zhixiang couldn't help frowning, covering nose with hand.

"Smell is indeed unpleasant," Zhao Yingong smiled, "Smell inside is even bigger. If body is unwell, better not go in..."

Wu Zhixiang shook head: "No hindrance, little brother can hold."

In the factory workshop, last batch of cocoons in stock was being processed. Water boiled in huge cocoon cooking pots; steam emitted from gaps between tightly closed pot cover and barrel. Although roof of cocoon cooking workshop constructed large skylights that could open and close for ventilation and heat dissipation, temperature inside workshop under midsummer scorching sun was still up to fifty degrees. Workers inside wearing full set of work clothes were all blackened by sweat.
