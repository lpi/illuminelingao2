# Chapter 2284: Beheading Plan

Liu Youwang said: "He is a *Juren*, you are also a *Juren*; this is just suitable!"

Chang Qingyun didn't know what Liu Youwang's "just suitable" meant; had to vaguely say: "...Yes..."

Liu Youwang got up stretching waist; a burst of sweat stink mixed with wine stink pounced on face, becoming more dense. Chang Qingyun dared neither cover nose, nor make disdainful appearance.

"Sun Qiaoniang, you recognize?"

Chang Qingyun secretly cried bad; bracing scalp said: "Just lives next door to me... is Registrar Sun’s daughter."

"I, want to marry Sun Qiaoniang as wife..." Liu Youwang said.

Chang Qingyun heart tightened; dared not take his words.

"...Although I am Camp Manager, also can't do matter of forcefully occupying other's woman—moreover she is official family's daughter. More or less leave some face. So plan to marry home bright media uprightly." Probably feeling itchy, Liu Youwang scratched chest, "Just this little girl stubborn very, insisting resolutely not marry without elder making decision. Registrar Sun, happened to hang himself dead again; this place only her a distant cousin and a little mother, neither proper elders; no one can make decision. I see, you just count as Sun Qiaoniang’s adopted father. Her father was a *Juren*, you are also *Juren*, not counting disgracing her."

Chang Qingyun dumbfounded: What routine was this?

"This... Student and Registrar Sun family never knew each other ah..." Chang Qingyun shook head repeatedly, "No relative no cause, how Student act as her elder? Sun family also can't agree..."

"Fart! You live right next door to his daughter, what never knew each other?" Liu Youwang said, "Whether Sun family willing or not counts a ball! You don't chatter! Just settled like this! Go back tidy up, change a body of clean clothes. Evening I call Qiaoniang to kowtow you as adopted father!"

Chang Qingyun had heart to refuse; however he knew Liu Youwang’s methods; if he said a "No" word, he had plenty of ways to torment self. Had to lower head answering.

Liu Youwang picked up a stack of token coupons, flinging casually, thrown on ground.

"You take these token coupons, get a body of good clothes first! Get some good wine and food again! You count as my adopted father-in-law too, have to be decent!" Saying so laughed loudly.

Chang Qingyun flew into rage; had heart to curse loudly "Villain unreasonable!" yet dared not open mouth; containing shame enduring humiliation picked up token coupons retreating out.

Returning to lodging soul lost spirit scattered. Chang Qingyun had no heart to paint anymore; lying down on bed, heart resentful uneven. This Hair thief really trampled scholars ah! He thought in heart, forcing official family own wives and daughters to sell smiles didn't count; now came to force marriage again! He fundamentally didn't believe any "Bright Media Upright Marrying." Liu Youwang this person background humble not to say; this person's character consistently extremely bad. In camp coercing and bribing, occupying women was common matter; all day long drinking and partying, playing tired then discarding. This so-called bright media upright wedding probably was because Sun Qiaoniang resisted firmly not complying; he feared bearing crime of "Rape" so made it. Australians punished subordinates raping extremely strictly; this Liu Youwang probably had some scruples.

Self coming to be this "Adopted Father," wasn't it aiding King Zhou to do evil!

Sun family and him had no dealings; let alone when Registrar Sun lived, even becoming neighbors in this camp, he and Qiaoniang didn't speak few sentences. However at this moment, Liu Youwang’s "Forced Marrying," made him feel skin-cutting "Pain of Destroyed Nation."

Rabbit dies fox grieves; to what extent scholars had to be trampled, Hair thieves could be satisfied?!

He thought about whether to go find True Hair to sue through Zhao Fengtian. But he was just a captive; Liu Youwang was a senior "Fake Hair." Even suing, even suing down Liu Youwang, Australians wouldn't punish him with heavy crime—he wanted to marry bright media uprightly! Self would form feud with Liu Youwang instead.

Must do them like Yi Haoran! Otherwise, really thinking we scholars were easy to bully?!

Originally he quite disapproved of Yi Haoran’s behavior, resentful he dragged self into water hard. This moment long lost hot blood filled his chest again.

However thinking again, he cooled down. Self was just a scholar; hard butting Liu Youwang this Devil Star besides being pulled to interaction to strip pants suffering whips publicly or worse—hanged alive, letting Hair thieves laugh at self "Not measuring own strength"—wouldn't have other results. Wanting to do must do Hair thieves painful! Let them see scholars not to be bullied!

Thinking here, he desperately wanted to see Yi Haoran.

Yi Haoran lobbying in Dragon Mother Temple, provoked Cai Lan six gods no master. On spot he didn't let Cai Lan join gang—right now he still couldn't trust Cai Lan; dared not reveal true intention to her. But he could tell, this little woman's heart already rekindled flame of revenge. And agreed to contact again through Jiang Qiuchan in future.

As long as having this flame, once time arrived, naturally would be useful!

Yi Haoran felt everything smooth, spirit rising even more. Now he already had Jiang Qiuchan—Cai Lan this line leading directly to Hair thief belly heart; also got support of warriors like Jiang Suo, Song Ming. Conditions to do a big job already ready. Next, was how to do a shocking earth shaking great deed!

Three people discussed on small boat. Song Ming’s opinion was contacting various "Old People" in city—now these scattered officials and generals existed everywhere in city, number not few. Some even became Fake Hair. He proposed one side contacting all these people, one side sending people to Guangxi side to contact; asking Court to send great army over; here inside city after contacting well riot together, cutting pass seizing gate, recovering Wuzhou.

Under current status that Two Guangs officers and soldiers defeated completely, if having magnificent feat like recovering Wuzhou, comparable to Guangdong Victory in past.

However Yi Haoran quickly denied his plan. Right now Guangxi side already routed not forming army; expecting them to send surprise troops over mountains and ridges again was almost impossible. Furthermore even if able to seize Wuzhou, light packed partial division definitely couldn't hold. And this plan wanting to succeed must recruit past scattered personnel widely. Plot involving more people, possibility of being sold bigger—especially under current war situation, receiving how many loyal and righteous scholars after all, this had to be weighed carefully.

Yi Haoran’s train of thought was completely different. He believed right now they had few people, but had route able to reach Hair thief belly heart directly; greatly could imitate past event of Hou Dagou springing raid on Wuzhou.

This past event Yi Haoran didn't know in past; learned only when reading former "Pacifying Yao" materials in Xiong Wencan Shogunate. Said in Seventh Year of Tianshun Hou Dagou led seven hundred people besieging Wuzhou Prefecture; attacking many times not overcoming. So pretended to retreat. Commander-in-chief Chen Jing relaxed guard. Then on November 13th this day deep night, Hou Dagou suddenly led elite soldiers climbing city from foot of Tea Mountain (North Mountain); entered city under reception of inside response; randomly raided Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen heavily guarded by heavy troops. Conquered Wuzhou Prefecture in one stroke. After entering city, righteous army looted everywhere, released prisoners; executed Wuzhou Prefecture Instructor Ren Qu, Administration Commissioner Song Qin; captured Chen Jing; took Deputy Commissioner Zhou Shu as hostage; then quickly retreated from Wuzhou city.

Yi Haoran believed, their current situation was similar to Hou Dagou: only having small amount of elite soldiers, but having inside response. Defense in city lax; imitating Hou Dagou old trick, had seven points certainty.

"Mr. Yi’s meaning is..." Whether Jiang Suo or Song Ming, all dumbfounded by this bold plan.

"We sneak attack entering city, taking down Xie Erren in one stroke!" Yi Haoran killing aura surging said, "If convenient, capture him alive, take to Guangxi to offer captive; if tense, take his head!"

Current situation, even if unable to recover Wuzhou; beheading or capturing a genuine True Australian, to Court naturally was rare good news; participating personnel needless to say everyone having great merit! Jiang Suo never mind; Song Ming’s eyes lit up immediately—this was much simpler than his "Recovering Wuzhou" plan, also much easier! He also knew gap between Ming army and Australian army; once garrison inside and outside city reacted, mere few thousand partial division might not be opponent of Australian. If unable to take down Wuzhou city, some of them not only no merit, instead had crime.

Comparing down, Advisor Yi’s plan of one hit then retreat was much more brilliant.

"Just taking down Xie Erren is not easy either..." Jiang Suo said, "National Army now has hundreds of people inside Wuzhou city; although many holding standard spears, training not good either. But Wuzhou still has a company outside city; inside city also has National Army. Even if we raid Three Headquarters successful, even if National Army inside city too late to block, Fubo Army outside city acting up, we also hard to escape..."

Fubo Army’s combat power, they had witnessed; no one had certainty to retreat with whole body under their pursuit.

"So we have to find some things to do for them at Sanheui."

"Advisor’s meaning is?"

"Sanheui now has more than four thousand captives gathering; if able to incite them to riot, Hair thief army outside city will be pinned down."

"This is a good method." Jiang Suo nodded, "Just how to make captives riot? Australians manage captives very methodically."

"This has to wait for opportunity." Actually this was also the strip Yi Haoran felt most thorny. Several thousand captives in captive camp, Australians neither abused, nor lacking food and clothes. Why riot? He pulled Chang Qingyun on boat now, but asking him to incite riot, neither had this guts, nor had this ability.

"If unable to incite riot, sending people to set fire directly how about?" Song Ming proposed. Sanheui captive camp was all brick wood grain grass construction, very easy to catch fire; once causing big fire, inevitably inducing chaos; garrison outside city equally could be pinned down.

This method was much easier than inciting riot. But Yi Haoran had been to camp, knew setting fire wasn't that easy either. Australians managed camp extremely methodically; between various longhouses were certain intervals; also prepared water buckets soil bags. If fire points not many not prosperous, very easily would be extinguished.

However he unwilling to sweep their interest at this moment, said: "This is also a method. Everyone think again. regardless of what method, as long as able to drag garrison outside city, we have winning chance!" He narrowed eyes slightly, said, "We think again, think again."
