# Chapter 696 - Fleet Departure

Now he was a dignified Australian-Song Navy Lieutenant. Although Shi Shisi had no concept of the Great Song and no clear idea how big an "Lieutenant" commission actually was, the title sounded impressive. Paired with a dignified uniform, a sword, and the professional officer temperament forced upon him by the transmigrators, he felt much more dashing than a Ming general.

Shi Shisi was on leave today; naval officers routinely had one day off per week. Shi Shisi returned to his own home and had a feast. While on duty, alcohol consumption was strictly rationed, which was painful for the former pirate who loved to drink. On his day off, naturally, he had to drink his fill.

It just so happened his orderly had hunted a rabbit, taken it to the East Gate Market Cooperative Restaurant, and asked the cook to prepare it. He also bought plenty of good wine. Shi Shisi then ate and drank heartily.

Full and slightly drunk. Such a leisurely afternoon on a day off with neither training nor sea duty was truly comfortable. Shi Shisi decided to nap blissfully in his chair, then go to the Violet House in East Gate Market for a bath, and in the evening drink with a few brothers at the Violet House—Hu Wumei, who had gone to Sanya a few months ago, had recently returned to Lingao on business, so everyone could gather and relax properly.

Since preparartions for the counter-encirclement campaign began, although the Navy didn't have many combat missions, patrols, transport, and escort duties kept them busy enough. The 5th Special Service Vessel Squadron commanded by Shi Shisi had been responsible for escorting the salt transport fleet between Manyan and Bopu—monotonous and boring. Shi Shisi wasn't afraid of fighting at all; he envied Li Guangfa. Li Guangfa's Special Service Vessel Squadron had at least shelled government troops in Chengmai—though that was the extent of it.

"Master! Master!" Just as he was drowsy, a woman's voice rang in his ear. Shi Shisi opened his eyes impatiently; it was his wife calling.

"What is it?" He really wanted to slap his wife to punish her for disturbing his sweet dream.

"A messenger from headquarters is here!" The woman was a bit panicked.

"Quick, call him in!" Shi Shisi sobered up instantly. Headquarters suddenly sending a messenger on a rest day meant an emergency had occurred—either an immediate meeting or setting sail.

"Setting sail?"

"Probably!" Shi Shisi wiped his hands on his uniform. Probably feeling his appearance wasn't fit for reporting, he roared at the orderly running in from the outer room, "Quick, pour me water!"

The messenger entered, saluted, and notified him of a meeting at the Naval Command in one hour.

"...We'll be setting sail after the meeting. You'd better pack your luggage and instruct your orderly to send it to the ship."

Shi Shisi would never forget the scene. The early morning sun had just peeked over the horizon, casting crimson light on the masts of the two-masted and three-masted ships. All warships of the Pearl River Estuary Detachment preparing to set sail had raised Rear Admiral Chen Haiyang's flag.

There were four squadrons of Special Service Vessels anchored at Navy Anchorages No. 1. A total of 16 vessels, varying in style and even tonnage. But every one was decorated beautifully, covered in flags. Decks and hulls were cleaned spotless. In the distance at Anchorage No. 2, there were two patrol boat squadrons; their beautiful streamlined hulls stood out like cranes among chickens.

At the "Big Pier"—as everyone called the civilian pier beside the huge stone embankment—five Special Service Vessel Squadrons were loading cargo. These Special Service Vessels were clumsy or unmaneuverable ships, specifically used for transshipping cargo and Marines. Many boxes marked with different numbers, symbols, and colors were loaded onto pallets, covered with nets, and hoisted by cranes.

Lined-up Marines, wearing "copper basin hats" made of coconut shells, waited in queues to board. The copper basin hat was the newest summer sun helmet. Although some transmigrators thought soldiers wearing it looked exactly like North Vietnamese commandos, it was more suitable for the subtropical summer climate than rattan helmets.

Every ship was lowering flat-bottomed boats, like bees released from a crowded hive. Noisy human voices, the creaking of pulleys and ropes, the sound of oars striking water, traveled across the surging sea surface to several nautical miles away. As the sun rose, the half-hoisted sails changed colors—first black, then blue-gray, finally white.

Various small boats in the bay gathered in a cluster, then scattered, forming groups of three or five, then separating and regrouping again. They were busy moving supplies and transporting personnel. The oars of rowing boats rose and fell; thick smoke and steam constantly poured from small, medium, and large Daihatsu landing craft. They alternately docked at the pier and alongside the big ships. Sailors shouted and whistled to each other. The water surface was speckled with garbage thrown from the ships.

Shi Shisi leaned on the bridge of his flagship, *Ling-Special 51*, greedily watching this tense, lively, and orderly departure scene. Beside him stood a young naval cadet, Pan Yong, the trainee executive officer on board. To enable captains, mostly of rough origins, to properly handle ship administration, the Admiralty designated many naval cadet internship positions as executive officers on ships, responsible for actual administrative and personnel management.

"Xiao Pan! This fleet is truly magnificent." Under Zhucailao, Shi Shisi had seen fleets a hundred times larger than this, but how could those ships compare to this dignified naval detachment! Just a gathering of many tattered fishing and cargo boats—like a big village.

"Yes, Captain." Pan Yong said respectfully. "The Daihatsu squadrons aren't departing together, otherwise it would be even more magnificent."

"Daihatsus are too small. It wouldn't be worth it if a few capsized in waves. Besides, they're coal-burners. We'd have to specially refuel them along the way."

Steam cranes rumbled as they hoisted the Daihatsu boats participating in this long-range voyage one by one, loading them onto the deck of the *Big Whale*. The *Big Whale* carried four Daihatsu boats on deck; other Daihatsus would be transported over after the Hong Kong base was completed.

The Marines participating in the Pearl River Estuary expedition consisted of two companies, additionally equipped with a Marine artillery company having two 12-pounder howitzers. This Marine detachment was named the Hong Kong Detachment. The Detachment Commander was Shi Zhiqi. This Detachment Commander wore a pair of black plain-glass spectacles, tied firmly behind his head with a string. He stood majestically on the *Big Whale*'s bridge, scanning the embarking Marines.

The name "Haibing" (Marines/Sea Soldiers) was disgusting—reeked of Japanese devils. But comparatively, the term "Haibing" was at least closer in meaning to his hopes for this force than "Naval Landing Force." In Shi Zhiqi's mind, the Marine Corps had no "Navy" in its name. It was more like the USMC—an independent branch alongside the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Shi Zhiqi's status in the Navy wasn't high because he missed the Navy's most glory-winning Second Defense of Bopu. The first time he wasn't on shift; the second time he was lying in the clinic with dysentery, hearing gunfire resounding through the sky outside but unable to move due to abdominal pain. He missed a great opportunity to earn merit—even just as a participant, he would have gained significant seniority advantages.

Not having fought in battle seriously affected his promotion in the Navy. Fortunately, he had a sailor's background, so he served as leader of the specialized team maintaining the Sacred Ship and concurrently as an instructor in the naval training class. He had a middling status. With Shi Zhiqi's capability, becoming a captain once large motorized ships were launched in batches wouldn't be a problem, but he wasn't content with that and set his sights on the Marine Corps.

He originally had great interest in the Marine Corps and planned to make a big splash in this field. So he joined the Marine Corps.

Shi Zhiqi had no interest in Old Di's strange German-style tastes. Germany might boast about its Army, and use submarines to cover its shame in the Navy, but its Marine Corps was practically a zero. Just as no one would be a fan of the Philippine Army.

After joining the Marines, he quickly gained great prestige and became a primary officer thanks to skills brought from his sailor profession.

For this Pearl River Estuary operation, Shi Zhiqi spent great effort to become the Detachment Commander. Of course, this also benefited from his former sailor status. Chen Haiyang believed a Marine detachment commander who understood navigation was much better in coastal combat than an officer who only knew infantry tactics.

Behind him stood Le Lin, captain of the *Big Whale* and also commander of the patrol boat detachment. He wore a snow-white US Navy uniform—naturally from his private collection. Though old, it was washed spotless and looked very handsome. He was gazing into the distance through binoculars.

"Now you're really going home." Of course, Hong Kong Island in this timeline had nothing to do with the Hong Kong Le Lin once lived in.

Le Lin showed a smile full of expectation: "I'm going to build a mansion on Victoria Peak! Be the Governor!"

"Hey hey, on what grounds do you get to be Governor?"

"Because I'm a Hong Konger. Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong."

"This Hong Kong has nothing to do with you." Shi Zhiqi said. "If we wanted, we could call it Wen Island, Ma Island, or Stone Island. Just not Hong Kong Island."

"Hehe, anyway I want to be Governor!" Le Lin was very interested in this topic, talking at length about what construction he would do on Hong Kong Island. Shi Zhiqi nodded and listened with a perfunctory smile. In his view, this young man's dream was too simple—what did a place like Hong Kong Island count for? Just a tiny island. His, Shi Zhiqi's, ideals were far grander.

At this moment, he saw a Small Daihatsu liaison boat puffing black smoke as it headed from the pier toward Chen Haiyang's flagship *Ling-Special 11*. This Daihatsu flew another personal flag. Needless to say, this was the boat of Navy Informal Advisor Wen Desi—he was currently heading to the flagship.
