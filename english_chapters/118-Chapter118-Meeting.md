# Chapter 118 - Meeting

The people in the village were scared out of their wits all day long. First, there was the earth-shaking cannon fire, then the shouting of killing. Because the stockade was broken too quickly, the villagers found that a large number of troops had entered the stockade without receiving any news. The men busily looked for tools to resist, while the women hurriedly smeared pot ash on their faces. Fortunately, the troops entering the stockade did not disturb the residential houses but went to attack the stockade master's residence, so everyone breathed a sigh of relief. For most people, the stockade master was an extremely hateful person. It would be best if his whole family died. But they were also afraid of suffering collateral damage. So every household was anxious. Hearing the call for every household to go to a meeting, knowing they couldn't refuse, they had to walk towards the crossroads. For a time, the entrance of the Gou family residence was crowded with heads.

The transmigrators piled rubble and broken bricks in front of the steps, placing the blown-off door planks on top to make a meeting platform. Poles were set up across the air, and gas lamps were hung. Although it was not yet late, the gas lamps everywhere were already lit, making the whole street dazzlingly bright. The summoned common people looked at these lamps, brighter than a hundred lanterns, with both fear and amazement.

The villagers saw that the solid and majestic gate had been blown beyond recognition, and the stone lions that always bared fangs and brandished claws were blown lying on the street. Several young men winked at each other, feeling some pleasure. However, groups of short-hairs wearing iron helmets and green or flowery clothes held fowling pieces, standing like a forest on all sides. The three-edged short swords on the fowling pieces glittered in the sunlight, some even with bloodstains, looking very scary. A few sharp-eyed ones had already discovered that the "waste" and "sour scholar" of their village, Zhang Xingjiao, dressed as a short-hair, was also aside—this person had come back once a few days ago, bringing some rice and salted fish to distribute to some people, saying he was working for the short-hairs after being captured. Everyone originally thought how could he, a scholar, betray the "Confucian moral code" he preached all day to succumb to thieves; probably he was captured and couldn't help himself. Now it seemed he had thoroughly defected to this gang of pirates. At this moment, they couldn't care about contempt. Those who had been kind to him in the past hurriedly greeted him and tried to get close. Those who had offended him in the past hurriedly hid in the crowd, deeply afraid that he would see them and, with evil arising from the gut, forcibly link them to the Gou family to kill with a borrowed knife.

The meeting began. Wu De first went on stage to speak. He first said that their side were descendants of Huaxia from overseas, sharing the same roots and origin as everyone. Then he reiterated the slogan "Eradicate the violent and eliminate evil, protect the territory and comfort the people"—this slogan had now been approved by the Executive Committee as the main propaganda slogan at the current stage. He emphasized the victory of their battle at Bairen Beach. Local tyrants and evil gentry like the Gou family, who had a bad track record and harmed the locality, would be beaten one by one until they could no longer harm the common people. He called on the masses to boldly expose these people, including their lackeys. When he said this, there was a great commotion below. The common people were actually not very interested in slogans, but eliminating the stockade master and settling accounts with those lackeys who usually lorded it over others was indeed a very satisfying thing. Some people who usually relied on having kinship or friendship with the lackeys in the stockade became anxious upon hearing this.

"Bring up the Gou family's lackeys!" With an order, the captured Gou family's martial arts teacher, stockade head, accountant, Qingke, butler, personal attendant, and even the fat head cook of the big kitchen, as well as several of the Gou family's same-clan relatives, wearing colorful paper high hats, were escorted to below the stage, all bowing and scraping in a gesture of pleading guilty. These figures, who usually lorded it over others and were arrogant in the stockade and even the county, were now dejected, all sticking their buttocks up in a miserable state. Laughter came from the crowd, first from a few people, then this laughter slowly infected everyone, and the whole venue laughed loudly. Xi Yazhou and others seemed very excited. Demonizing the opponent was indeed a useful move.

Next, Tan Chengqing from Salt Field Village spoke. He had studied in Du Wen's Peasant Training Institute for about ten days and was already quite skilled in mass speeches. He spoke methodically, embellishing Gou Xunyi's actions in Salt Field Village, and then expressed that the people of Salt Field Village and Damei Village were all good subjects of the Great Ming and could absolutely not tolerate the perverse acts of local tyrants and bullies like the Gou family. He also cited classics, mentioning many examples of the founding emperor of this dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, striking down powerful landlords—doing this was to eliminate the common people's worry that this move was suspected of "rebellion." Of course, Tan Chengqing didn't know these things; they were all materials prepared for him by the intellectual Zhang Xingjiao.

Then Zhang Xingjiao went on stage to speak from personal experience. His encounter was known to everyone in the village, but hearing his emotional accusation in person still made many people show sadness. Wu De saw Zhang Xingjiao taking out something like a thigh bone as he spoke, crying while talking, and then wailing loudly on the stage holding it, causing the people below to sigh and weep too. He couldn't help but be puzzled and asked Xiong Buyou beside him:

"What is Old Zhang saying?"

"He says his family's ancestral grave was dug by the Gou family, and the remains of several generations of ancestors are left with only this bone."

"Didn't he say in the past that the ancestral grave was dug and even bones couldn't be found?"

"He's making it up," Xiong Buyou said, "He just found this bone from some wild grave pile just now."

"Old Zhang is really a teachable talent. Really can make things up."

"Not really making it up. It's a fact that the ancestral grave was dug by the Gou family. As for this bone, it counts as a propaganda prop. Nothing extraordinary about faking a bit in propaganda."

Zhang Xingjiao became more and more excited on stage, finally demanding: Drag these people onto the stage and hand them over to the common people for struggle and criticism. The Salt Field Village militia, who had been rubbing their hands for a long time, immediately dragged these people onto the stage. Zhang Xingjiao grabbed the collar of the Feng Shui master Qingke, scolding while enumerating his crimes, and occasionally punching him. This Qingke old man had already received many stick blows from Zhang Xingjiao just now. Receiving this beating again, he was in pain and fear, unable to stand up, collapsing on the ground with incontinence. The common people became more excited as they watched, crowding forward continuously.

Zhang Xingjiao had secretly connected with several villagers who usually had great feuds with the Gou family in the afternoon. At this time, they also stood up one after another, exposing many crimes of these people, from seizing fields and properties, usury exploitation to molesting women, and unleashing dogs to bite people. Major and minor matters, trivialities were all there. But these things rarely involved Gou the Elder and Gou the Second themselves. Listening to this, Wu De felt it wasn't powerful enough, and the atmosphere wasn't rising. Just as he was thinking of a way, he suddenly saw someone striding onto the stage and kicking a Gou family clan master fiercely. This half-old man was already unstable in center of gravity and immediately fell on his back. The common people below let out a gasp of surprise. Up to now, no one dared to hit the Gou family people. Everyone looked closely and saw it was the Gou family's cook: Gou Buli.

Gou Buli actually had no dealings with Zhang Xingjiao, and there was no gratitude or grudge between them. It was just that Zhang Xingjiao knew this cook had a habit of stealing food and things—this was nothing extraordinary, as the old saying goes, "If the cook doesn't steal, the five grains won't yield." Although surnamed Gou, he was from out of town. Relying on his craft and strength, he was very unpopular among the Gou family's servants. The steward would give him trouble from time to time, often beating him with boards or deducting wages. A few months ago, he couldn't stand it and stole some silver money preparing to run away, but was caught by the Gou family clan master managing the house, beaten half to death, and locked in jail. He had a feud with the Gou family, and personally fit the characteristics of a thorough proletarian who feared nothing, making him a perfect object for the transmigrators to use.

Gou Buli was originally a bit nervous standing on the stage. Looking back at the corner of the stage, Xi Yazhou nodded at him, so he mustered up courage and started speaking:

"I am a poor cook, cooking for the masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies of the Gou family for many years. The climate has been bad these years, either drought or rain, typhoons and hail coming in turns. Everyone lives hard on weekdays. Putting a piece of sweet potato in porridge counts as celebrating New Year. (Note: This is no exaggeration. Before rebelling, Hong Xiuquan's greatest wish was to eat white rice porridge with sweet potatoes every day. The poverty of ordinary people can be imagined.) What about this Gou family? I am a low-ranking cook and don't know many principles. Just let me talk about what I know of their family's eating.

"The first-class chefs used by his family are all masters who can make dozens of dishes from a pig. A plate of stir-fried meat uses a piece of meat from the back of a live pig; the rest is unwanted. Fish must be gasping, shrimp must be jumping. Rice must be milled three times. The cooked rice is all white rice, without a single grain of coarse cereal or sweet potato added! Tired of eating white rice, they make deep-fried cakes, a big stack at a time... Drinking wine aged ten years, ginseng soup from Liaodong, half a foot long. The most hateful is Gou Xunyi's son, Young Master Gou. This little one deserving to be sliced, since childhood, eating steamed buns, doesn't eat if hot, doesn't eat if cold. When neither cold nor hot, he asks two beautiful maids to hold a corner each and bring it to his mouth. He bites a mouthful in the middle, and throws the rest to feed the dogs—"

Wu De frowned and asked Xi Yazhou in a low voice: "Who made this up? Fabrication should have a limit too?!"

Xi Yazhou remained calm: "It was done by Du Wen leading Zhang Xingjiao and others. Not bad, right? You think it's outrageous, but the common people love this tune."

"Isn't this nonsense..." Just as Wu De was speaking, the Gou family clan master kicked to the ground suddenly stood up and said tremblingly:

"Nonsense! No such—" Before he finished, several Salt Field Village militia beside him brought sticks down together, stuffed a hemp nut into his mouth, and dragged him aside.
