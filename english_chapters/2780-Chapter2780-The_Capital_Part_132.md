# Chapter 2780: The Capital (Part 132)

Third Sister listened to the report from the person who went out to inquire about the news, her brows slightly furrowed.

When the other party finished speaking, she opened her mouth and said: "Is it certain?!"

"It can't be fake! They've already hooked up!" The comer was none other than Zhao Liangjian. Ever since he put in great effort during the rescue work, he had now been absorbed by the He Lian Sheng (Union Victory) as an "Associate." Although he had no title or position, people in the *Jianghu* valued silver and loyalty most, and He Lian Sheng had plenty of both, so he was naturally happy to serve.

These days, he and his partners scattered in the Capital, inquiring about various suspicious news everywhere, and monitoring various places according to the list.

The place he monitored was the residence of "Mr. Zhou" at Wanggong Factory provided by Liu Sha.

Unexpectedly, the monitoring didn't yield any clues about the residence, but instead brought out a new case.

"What is this person's background? Is there anyone behind him?"

"Whether there is anyone behind him is hard to say, but he has a reputation in the *Jianghu*. He engages in the dirty business of seducing and occupying women and reselling them. People call him 'Jade-Faced Pan An,' and his real name is Pan Cheng'an."

"Jade-Faced Pan An?" Third Sister sneered, "Presumably he is very handsome?"

"Speaking of which, he is just of average appearance." Zhao Liangjian said, "It's just that he understands women's hearts most thoroughly, is good at various little tricks, and his skills in the bedchamber (sexual arts) are also very impressive. If a woman falls into his hands, it's like maggots attached to the bone; she can never shake him off."

"That formidable?"

"Exactly." Zhao Liangjian said, "Otherwise, how could he work in this trade."

"Although this trade is despicable, one actually needs some real skills." Third Sister said, "Tell me the whole story in detail."

"In this residence are two concubines of some Mr. Zhou..." Zhao Liangjian said that Pan Cheng'an had been eyeing the Zhou residence for a long time because there was no male master here for a long time, only two young women with young children. It was the best target to start with.

Unexpectedly, although it was "fat meat," it was not easy to start. Pan Cheng'an spent several months before catching their opportunity to go out for incense offering and used his "charm technique" for the first time.

As for the specific process, Zhao Liangjian was also unclear. However, seducing and occupying women had its routines, nothing more than those few tricks. In short, after going back and forth, Pan Cheng'an and You Rong had mutual affection.

"About two months ago, the two met privately in a nunnery in the south of the city, and Pan Cheng'an succeeded." Zhao Liangjian said, "Recently, presumably he is going to instigate her to pack up her valuables and run away privately."

"Didn't you say that the defense of this residence is very strict? Apart from the two concubines strolling in the temple fair to burn incense on the first and fifteenth of every month, even the servants rarely go out."

"Third Sister, you, dragging your old self, have also worked as a guard in inner courtyards. You know the affairs of female relatives best. Which big household doesn't have strict doors, but which one can prevent these things! As long as this thought arises, even in the Imperial Prison, they can still get things done."

After listening, Third Sister didn't know how to respond. This matter seemed related and yet unrelated to capturing "Mr. Le" (Zhou Lezhi) or the more mysterious "Mr. Zhou." Whether to intervene became a dilemma.

Logically speaking, since no traces of "Mr. Le" or the more mysterious "Mr. Zhou" had appeared in the Zhou residence right now, then whatever happened in the residence should not be interfered with, so as not to alert the enemy; but watching helplessly as bad people abducted women and pushed people into the fire pit without saving them violated the moral values of bodyguards.

"Can the matter be settled without making a sound?"

"Probably not." Zhao Liangjian said, "It's easy to eliminate Jade-Faced Pan An, but many peers in the Capital know about him doing this case."

If Pan Cheng'an suddenly disappeared, everyone would know that someone secretly interfered in this matter. This potential surveillance point would have no meaning.

"Then we can only allow him to abduct the woman out." Third Sister let out a breath unwillingly and muttered, "These disappointing ones! Can't live without a man?!"

Zhao Liangjian had long perceived that Third Sister intended to manage this matter but couldn't due to the mission, and was in a dilemma. He thought for a moment and said: "It doesn't matter if Third Sister intends to manage this matter. After Pan Cheng'an succeeds, most likely he will sell this woman to southern guests on the tribute grain boats. We can just intercept the person at that time."

"How do you know he will sell her to the guests on the tribute grain boats?"

"This residence is a place the Wanping County Yamen has given instructions about; ordinary people dare not cause trouble." The Zhou residence was a place Wang Yehao had specially sent a card to the Wanping County Yamen to take care of, so ordinary petty thieves and villains dared not make a move. Therefore, "seizing the door to tie up people" was unlikely—this was a suicidal act at the foot of the Emperor. But if the female relatives packed up valuables and ran away privately, it had nothing to do with the yamen.

"...Although so, one must also guard against the victim using official channels to demand the person. Therefore, once he succeeds, he will sell the woman far away. Only in this way can the beginning and end be clean, without implicating himself."

"Good grief, this bunch of demons and monsters!" Third Sister frowned in disgust, "Fine, let's follow your idea. You send me news anytime regarding matters over there."

***

Zhou Lezhi listened to Xu Yong's report and stopped the pen in his hand. He slowly put it down, pondered for a moment, and asked: "Who do you think they are?"

"Nine out of ten they are *Kai Tiaozi* (abducting women)!" Xu Yong said urgently.

Zhou Lezhi remembered what Wang Zhi said about You Rong matter, and then remembered similar words Liu Sha said before disappearing; he couldn't help but hesitate.

This matter was not groundless; he had heard of it long ago. But he had no hard evidence, and with his identity as an "apprentice," it was inconvenient to intervene directly. If he reported it to Master Wang, he was afraid the matter would become unbearable and humiliate the master's school.

Originally, the master was quite open-minded about women. He always said "stay if agreeing, leave if not agreeing," and also said that if You Rong or Yui were unwilling to follow him one day and wanted to marry someone else, he would not oppose it. Not only would he not oppose it, but he would also give a generous dowry.

Zhou Lezhi didn't insist on letting You Rong and the others "keep watch" (remain chaste). After all, whether the master was still alive, and if alive, whether he could return were unknowns. It was not surprising that thoughts arose in their hearts under such "care" which was tantamount to house arrest.

You Rong was one thing, but the problem was she was Zhou Newton's "birth mother." Although he, Wang Zhi, Xu Yong, and the Liu brothers all knew that both Newton and Juli were fakes brought by Liu Sha, living together for these years, the master had deep affection for these two children. If You Rong took Zhou Newton away or some accident happened during the abduction, how would he explain to the master?

"Whether You Rong is a red apricot reaching over the wall (having an affair) or bewitched by others, those seeking her must be villains. If she really falls into their hands, I'm afraid it will be eternal damnation." Zhou Lezhi said in a deep voice, "This matter should not be delayed; we must report to the Master quickly."

"Yes!" Seeing Mr. Le's firm attitude, Xu Yong was greatly excited and nodded vigorously, "If she is really abducted, and the Gentleman returns and loses his family member, none of us can explain it well."

"Call Wang Zhi here."

Wang Zhi had been greedy for reading novels these days, and the matter of sending New Year's goods that Zhou Lezhi instructed him to do had been dragging on. Hearing Zhou Lezhi calling him at this moment, he thought it was still about this matter, so as soon as he came, he hurriedly defended himself: "Sir! It's not that this lowly one doesn't do it, but these few days my legs hurt..."

"I see it's not your legs hurting, it's your butt itching!" Zhou Lezhi scolded laughingly, "Let the steward give you forty strokes of the board and you'll be comfortable all over!"

"Sir, show mercy! This lowly one will go do it right now!" Wang Zhi said hurriedly. Although Zhou Lezhi was usually amiable and cute, and young, he was a first-class popular person in front of Master Wang. The key was that he was different from the previous Mr. Zhou; he "knew how to be a master."

"Wait!" Zhou Lezhi pondered and said, "You take Xu Yong with you this time."

"Yes, yes." Wang Zhi nodded repeatedly.

"Pretend to be a young servant carrying things. Don't show your face."

"This lowly one understands!"

"When you arrive at the residence, don't just put down things and leave. You must investigate carefully." Zhou Lezhi said in a deep voice, "Especially inside You Rong's room!"

Wang Zhi was stunned and said: "This, I'm afraid, is inappropriate."

"How is it inappropriate?" Zhou Lezhi said, "Didn't you say she was 'very restless'?"

"Yes, this lowly one did say so. But after all, she is Mr. Zhou's concubine and has a son at her knees; her status is unusual. When we lowly ones go to send items, at most we look at the curtain and pay respects in the courtyard, saying a few words. How can we investigate strictly? Not to mention the distinction between men and women, the hierarchy of high and low cannot be disordered either."

Zhou Lezhi thought Wang Zhi's words made sense. Whether Wang Zhi or Xu Yong, they were both "servants." How could they investigate You Rong, who was half a master? Let alone entering the room.

Speaking of which, he himself was also just an "apprentice," and You Rong and Yui were both "mistresses." Even if he went personally, he couldn't "investigate strictly."

But at this moment, he had nowhere to find a woman of high status to help. Immediately he said: "Since it's like this, you two go first. If you can't go into the room, just walk around privately in the courtyard. See if there are any suspicious places." He suddenly remembered something and instructed again, "If there is really something with You Rong, there is probably someone secretly assisting her. If not the servants in the family, then it's some three aunts and six grannies (meddlesome women). You examine and question the people serving in the residence carefully!"

At this point, Wang Zhi also knew the matter was urgent. He hurriedly agreed. Then he said: "The two families serving in the Zhou residence are both the Master's household servants, most reliable. I'm afraid outsiders are seducing her."

"I can take charge of this matter; you just ask." Zhou Lezhi said, "If anyone is dishonest, just come back and report to me."

"Yes!"

"Xu Yong!" Zhou Lezhi said, "I'll trouble you to guard the residence these few days. Someone will definitely come to replace you within three days."

"Yes, this lowly one understands!" Xu Yong hesitated and said again, "If something happens within three days and this lowly one cannot handle it alone, what should be done?"

"Didn't your master teach you? The Capital is at the foot of the Emperor; no matter how arrogant the thieves are, they dare not break into the door to seize people. You just need to watch and make sure no one runs out!" Zhou Lezhi laughed, "But you think quite thoroughly!"

"Many thanks, Sir." Xu Yong was very happy. Being praised by this brain trust of the Master was a matter of great face. It also concerned his future status in the Stone Old Man (Shi Weng) group.
