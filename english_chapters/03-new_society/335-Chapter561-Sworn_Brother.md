# Chapter 561 - Sworn Brother

The banquet was exquisite. The Yang family had come from the prosperous lands of Guangdong, and their refinement in enjoyment far exceeded that of local gentry and landlords. With their finances recently much improved, the quality of their living had risen accordingly. The banquet table held few dishes, but each was meticulously prepared. The wine was specially purchased from the mainland—Lanling wine, a premium liquor commonly enjoyed by wealthy Ming Dynasty people.

Yang Shixiang had the attending apprentices heat the wine, then dismissed them. Only he and Liu San remained in the study—he had some important matters to discuss.

Since forming a sworn brotherhood and partnership with Liu San, Yang Shixiang's business had grown ever larger, practically bringing in bushels of gold daily. Precisely because of this, he paid increasingly close attention to developments within the transmigrator collective. The Australians were not only his investors, major clients, and technical advisors, but were essentially his patrons. To some extent, the Australians' rise or fall also determined Runshitang's prospects.

Liu San often came to Runshitang on matters related to traditional Chinese patent medicine manufacturing and sales, but rarely had the opportunity to sit down for casual conversation and gossip.

Yang Shixiang was eager to learn the details of the "Female Servant Revolution." This affair wasn't as airtight a secret as the transmigrators imagined. In fact, rumors emerged within days, saying the Australians had caused internal turmoil over women. Some even stated with certainty that the trouble arose because the leaders inside had each taken dozens of wives while the lower ranks had none. Others said the Australians didn't lack women, but had fought over a woman of celestial beauty, competing for her affections until conflict erupted.

Yang Shixiang was quite surprised by this news—he hadn't expected the Australians to be short of women! Ships arrived from Bopu Harbor every ten days or so carrying one or two boatloads of refugees, including many women. The Australians numbered at most a thousand; one each should be easily managed.

His sworn brother Liu San had a wife—Yang Shixiang had even sent a gift specifically to Wuyunhua, and was rather awed by the robustness and presence of Australian women. He had a vague sense that his sworn brother was somewhat henpecked.

After three rounds of wine, Yang Shixiang finally broached the subject obliquely.

Liu San started—this matter had even reached the county town. Good news never leaves home, but bad news travels a thousand *li*. He nodded slightly:

"Indeed, it's true."

"What was the outcome?" Yang Shixiang quickly asked.

"Everyone is satisfied." Liu San's expression as he said this bore no trace of satisfaction, leaving Yang Shixiang puzzled.

"From your manner, brother, you don't seem satisfied at all."

After a few cups of wine, Liu San couldn't help venting his complaints about his girlfriend. Any man could relate to such grievances.

"So you're not permitted to take a concubine." Yang Shixiang looked at his somewhat dejected sworn brother and thought this wasn't really a big deal. He said, "What's difficult about that? Since you can't bring one home, just set up another household outside."

Liu San was startled—he hadn't expected Yang Shixiang to suggest this. After hesitating a moment, he shook his head:

"That won't work. For now, we're not allowed to establish residences outside Bairren City. Besides—"

Besides, if his wife found out about such audacious behavior, wouldn't she immediately come storming over, causing a scene for the whole city to see? Thinking this, he realized it was completely unfeasible.

Of course, there was no Women's Federation here to back up Wuyunhua. The women among the transmigrators were not only few in number but couldn't be said to be particularly united or harmonious with each other. If it really came to a fight, apart from Du Wen, probably no one would come to help Wuyunhua. Liu San realized that when it came to gender relations, he could actually do whatever he wanted.

But if he really did that, years of feelings between them would be completely destroyed. Liu San couldn't bear that.

"Forget it, let your younger brother work on this slowly," he said listlessly.

Yang Shixiang had already had an idea in mind: if Liu San truly wanted this, his wife's family had relatives in Zhangzhou who had recently crossed the sea to join him. There were several girls of marriageable age in the family; arranging for one to become Liu San's concubine wouldn't be difficult.

Since Liu San wasn't willing, Yang Shixiang didn't press further. What he was eager to know was: had the Australians been fatally affected by this disturbance?

There were many rumors outside—some said the Australians had fought among themselves, with corpses strewn throughout Bairren City; some said the Australian leaders had set a Hongmen banquet trap, lured in the troublemakers, then gave a signal by dropping a cup, whereupon both sides opened fire with arquebuses, killing hundreds at once; others said all the main leaders had been killed and a different group was now in power...

One rumor came particularly close to the truth: the East Gate Grand Official who managed East Gate Market had rebelled against the leaders, leading his men in an attempt to storm Bairren City. At the city gate, both sides exchanged gunfire; the East Gate Grand Official was outnumbered and he and all his men were killed. Some people even colorfully described how gunfire had echoed through Bairren City all night...

The natives weren't very familiar with Dugu Qiuhun, so the story got switched to Dongmen Chuiyu instead. After Dongmen Chuiyu was transferred and disappeared from East Gate Market, this gave the rumor an air of credibility.

Liu San frowned upon hearing how wild the outside rumors had become—what was the Political Security General Administration doing? Didn't such rumors seriously damage the transmigrator collective's great, glorious, and correct image?

He had to expend considerable effort to explain to Yang Shixiang that these were all rumors. As for demonstrations and the like, such things were nothing. Not only had the transmigrator collective's strength not been damaged, but after experiencing this storm, it would become even stronger.

For this, he had to explain the electoral system and the transmigrator collective's basic political system, lest his sworn brother fail to understand.

Only after quite a bit of explanation did Yang Shixiang feel at ease. He wasn't interested in political systems, but understood from Liu San's words that this was merely "civil struggle"—no actual fighting that had damaged their core strength. He relaxed and said with a laugh:

"Then I was overly worried. As long as the core strength wasn't harmed, that's good."

Liu San then mentioned his plan to develop new medicines. His next step was to develop and manufacture Ten Drops Water and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water, two summer medicines, as well as attempt to manufacture Fengyoujing. All were urgently needed for the Yulin development.

Yang Shixiang had complete faith in every new medicine Liu San proposed. Now the traditional Chinese patent medicine business was so good that he was seriously considering relocating the pharmaceutical workshop from the city to the "Private Enterprise Park" outside Bairren City. Runshitang's workshop was already overwhelmed.

"That would be excellent," Liu San thought. This had been planned all along—keeping the factory at Runshitang in the past was merely for convenience. Since Yang Shixiang was now proposing it himself, that was all the better.

"Now that I have some money, your elder brother wants to build a big workshop like those in your Australia! To really do something grand." Yang Shixiang was deeply impressed by the Australians' factories. After a few cups of wine, he grew somewhat excited. His mood had been very good lately: his cousin Yang Shiyi had completely changed his attitude—not only frequently sending letters and gifts, but also becoming much more polite in his language. He was even very courteous to the old manager Liu Benshan whom Yang Shixiang had sent to oversee business in Foshan. Moreover, he had repeatedly indicated that purchases no longer required cash payment and credit limits could be increased. After years of being looked down upon by relatives, Yang Shixiang could finally hold his head high.

The impression that cooperating with the Australians meant great enterprise had been deeply imprinted in his mind. Now that he heard the Australians' core strength was unharmed and they could still stay in Lingao, he could continue pursuing great achievements with this sworn brother.

"Your foolish elder brother wants to install those, um, machines in the factory," Yang Shixiang said. "Last time I visited the mill and saw your water mill—it was so fast and good. Everyone says you Australians are the most ingenious. Surely you have machines for making medicine too?"

"There are indeed machines." Liu San nodded. He had long wanted to open a pharmaceutical factory that used machinery-assisted processing, rather than the current manual operations. Runshitang currently employed over twenty medicine workers, plus more than a dozen casual laborers and apprentices. Using machinery-assisted production could reduce personnel by two-thirds. The labor savings could then be used for expanded reproduction.

Old medicine workers who had long handled medicinal materials understood drug properties and pharmacology intimately. Having such talent continue doing simple manual labor was obviously wasteful.

"What machines are needed?" Yang Shixiang was extremely interested in mechanized production, but had no concept whatsoever of what machinery was needed for processing medicinal materials.

"There are many machines of various types," Liu San thought he would need to submit an application himself. Manufacturing equipment for medicines should receive priority. But Runshitang was a joint venture, so he wasn't sure how pricing would be determined. He could only prepare the groundwork first:

"The price probably won't be cheap."

"Expensive doesn't matter, as long as it works well—silver just sitting there won't breed baby silver!" Yang Shixiang had money in hand, and his words couldn't help taking on a dandyish tone.

"Since elder brother has this intention, I'll take care of it as soon as I return." Liu San was quite excited. This was a classic example—a model of native capitalist cooperation with the transmigrator collective. Those people in the Executive Committee would definitely give some favorable policies for future propaganda purposes, and might even set up a "model case."

Becoming a positive model would make everything so much easier.

Actually, whether Runshitang could become a "model" had little to do with Liu San himself—Liu San's shareholder status was nominal; the true shareholder was the transmigrator collective itself. But he still very much hoped Runshitang could keep growing bigger and stronger, becoming a pharmaceutical giant in the new world.

Liu San's sworn brotherhood with Yang Shixiang had begun merely as a means of strengthening cooperation. However, over more than half a year of discussing pharmacology, exchanging medical knowledge, going out together to purchase medicinal materials and manage business, the two had built a deep friendship. Moreover, his sworn brother's entire family cared for him deeply, showing constant warmth and concern, just like true family. This made Liu San feel warmed. He naturally had to look after his sworn brother's interests.

"Then I'll trouble my worthy younger brother with this," Yang Shixiang said excitedly. "I'll instruct Manager Liu right away to find more workers from Foshan—"

Liu Benshan was now Runshitang's manager in Foshan, overseeing all Runshitang affairs in Guangdong.
