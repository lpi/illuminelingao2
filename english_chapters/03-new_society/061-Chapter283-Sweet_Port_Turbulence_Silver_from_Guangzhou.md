# Chapter 283: Sweet Port Turbulence – The Silver from Guangzhou

At the villa, Chu Yu removed her rain cape and hung it under the eaves, then hurried back to unfasten Wu De's rain jacket buttons. Beneath her blue cloth dress, she was completely soaked, covered with mud. Her legs were bare—just muddy feet now. Her hair was plastered into wet strands, her lips blue with cold, her body shivering. But on her back was a bundle.

"What are you doing here? I told you I was on a business trip!" Though moved, Wu De couldn't help scolding her. "Coming out in this heavy rain—trying to get sick?" But there was already affection in his words.

"I was born a servant—where would I get such delicate sensibilities?" Chu Yu didn't seem to mind. She ignored her wet clothes. She took down the bundle. "I saw Master forgot this. Since you're on a business trip to territory under the officials' control, I hurried to bring it."

Opening it, he found a dark stab-resistant vest. Whenever Wu De went to the countryside or the quarantine camp, he'd wear this for protection. Recently, as conditions improved and weather grew hot, he rarely wore it anymore.

"Master always wears this protective garment on business trips. I saw you forgot it and rushed over." Chu Yu beamed. "I thought I wouldn't make it in time. Put it on."

Wu De was caught between laughter and tears. Wearing this thing today wouldn't matter, but once the sun came out, he'd cook to death. Still, Chu Yu's heartfelt concern touched him deeply.

"Alright, I'll bring it along."

"Remember to wear it—"

"I'll remember." Wu De decided to be agreeable all the way. "You should hurry back now. I'll be setting out shortly."

"Master," Chu Yu dried her dripping hair and nestled into his embrace, saying softly, "please come back safe and sound—"

Wu De felt a warmth in his heart. Nothing pleased a man more than having a woman devote herself completely as her anchor—even if she wasn't beautiful.

"I'm just going to Guangzhou for business, not into mountains of swords or seas of fire."

"What Master does is rebellion." Chu Yu looked up at him, her eyes clear and bright. "Guangzhou isn't like Lingao—it's under officials' jurisdiction. Please be careful. Chu Yu wants to serve Master for a lifetime."

Wu De had wanted to deny the rebellion thing, but on second thought—why deceive himself? He nodded solemnly.

The *Ascending Peace Island* left port, heading northwest toward Guangzhou Bay. An hour later, Bopu Port had vanished below the horizon. Only the lighthouse at Lingao Point could still be faintly seen.

As evening approached, the wind grew more violent, mixed with rain. Wu De checked his watch: 17:05, but the sky was already dark as dusk. The sea was rough, and the 70-ton *Ascending Peace Island* bobbed like a leaf, appearing and disappearing among the waves.

Wu De sat in the captain's cabin, watching the sea through the glass window. The so-called captain's cabin had no leather high-back chair—just a rattan chair fixed to the deck.

"Sir, the rain is too heavy. It's dark—can't see a thing. Should we stop and put in somewhere?" The first mate walked in to report. His rain cape and bamboo hat were soaked, his lips blue with cold.

This first mate, Wang the Bearded, had originally been a small boat owner doing coastal trade until he was robbed by the Red Hairs at sea. So he'd become a pirate—unfortunately, on his very first raid with his bosses, he'd been wiped out by the transmigrators. After months of honest labor in the reform brigade, he'd passed political screening and been recruited by the Navy. After further vetting, he was appointed first mate on the *Ascending Peace Island*.

"Have a drink to warm up first." Wu De unslung his canteen. "What's our speed?"

The first mate took a big gulp of liquor. "7 to 8.5 knots."

"Wind strength?"

"20 knots."

So the rain was heavy, but wind hadn't increased. This relieved Wu De slightly.

"Can't stop the ship. We need to sail day and night to make it in time," Wu De said. "Split the sailors and marines into two shifts for sleeping in rotation."

"Yes, sir!" Wang the Bearded hurried out.

Wu De put on his seaman's cap, fastened his rain jacket, and climbed up to the aft castle. The six trainees on their first voyage were curled up on deck, vomiting. Several were deathly pale.

Seeing their commander approach, the trainees struggled to stand. Wu De stopped them. "Grab a rope and stand! First learn to keep your feet on deck!"

He walked to the forward railing, wanting to observe conditions in the distance. The wind seemed to have strengthened. Rain pelted his face like a torrent. Wu De wiped his face, steadied his footing, and used binoculars to observe—in the murky darkness, only vague patches of light and shadow were visible.

The cold rain soon numbed his skin. Fatigue set in. Wu De hastily shook his head to clear it, then returned to the cabin to study charts under the swaying lantern light.

Night sailing in this era, with virtually no navigational facilities, in a ship without radar, GPS, or gyrocompass, was extremely dangerous. Wu De had chosen the safest route, but the danger of grounding remained ever-present.

"Sir! Wind's too strong—the sails can barely take it. Rain's too heavy—water's coming into the lower hold faster!" Wang the Bearded reported. His rain cape had been torn apart by the wind.

"Sea conditions?"

"Wind 25 knots, wave height 3.3 meters!"

"Order! Lower sails! Secure all lines! Maintain course!" Wu De commanded.

"Marine squad leader! Have your men work in five-man shifts. All pumps running—help with drainage! Non-essential personnel, everyone below deck!"

Wu De stepped out. The deck was alive with activity. Sailors in short pants, barefoot, were lowering sails and tightening cables. Marines with blue armbands were pumping water.

Just then, a wave lifted the bow high. Seeing it, Wu De immediately shouted, "Hold on!!!"

Before he finished, the ship plunged into the trough. Seawater swept across the entire deck.

Wu De was knocked down. He grabbed a rope and struggled to his feet. "Count heads! Report losses!!!"

"Sailors—no casualties!!!" "Marines—no casualties!!" "Forward hatch damaged!! Taking water!!" "Midship hold—taking water!!"

"Forward hold—plug the leak! Midship hold—pump!"

"Man overboard!!!" Along with a sharp whistle blast, the stern lookout gave the alarm.

Wu De looked at the trainees pumping on deck—only one remained.

He ran to the stern. Following the lookout's direction, he saw two figures floating face-down about 100 meters away.

"Sir, do we rescue them?"

"How? In these seas? Besides, those two kids are already gone. Their first time at sea..." Wu De said angrily. "Go—get the rest of those boys down to the mid-hold!"

At midnight, the wind raged and rain lashed. Wu De went down to the mid-hold. Off-duty sailors and marines were eating. The four surviving trainees were huddled in a corner, quietly sobbing.

Wu De sat beside them. "You all know now?"

The four said nothing, just kept crying.

"The sea is like this. You've only seen her calm side. Today's waves weren't even the worst."

"Not even the worst—dear heaven..." One trainee stopped crying and stared.

"That's right. Look at them over there—not bothered at all." Wu De pointed at the sailors eating and joking. "The sea can only be conquered by those who don't fear hardship or death. Only by going through this can you become real men."

"I don't want to be a naval officer anymore, boo-hoo..." This one was probably fourteen or fifteen—clearly in shock.

Wu De sighed. "Get some rest. In two hours, you're back on watch! Anyone who doesn't want to be a trainee—I'll arrange your withdrawal when we get back!"

Back in the captain's cabin, Wu De ate dinner: four rice cakes, one dried fish, one pomelo, and a cup of water. *These damned field rations!*

A night of wind and rain, and at dawn, the sky began brightening. Wind and rain had subsided. The *Ascending Peace Island* resumed normal sailing and arrived at Guangzhou Bay early on the third day.

The handover point was at the Guangzhou docks. Qiwei Escort Agency personnel provided escort, mobilizing almost half the agency's manpower.

Zhang Xin came to the dock and supervised loading the iron chests containing 50,000 taels of silver onto the ship.

"This is 50,000. We're in contact with the Gao family to raise more cash, but funds are hard to mobilize right now..."

"This tight? Doesn't the Gao family owe us over a hundred thousand in payments?"

"Our accounts receivable are close to 180,000," Zhang Xin said. "But by convention, the first settlement isn't until the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. Merchants with goods out haven't collected payment yet. It's the same everywhere—nobody can produce much cash. Lending interest rates in Guangzhou are very high. Even if the Gao family scrapes together tens of thousands, we'll have to pay interest."

"How high?"

"Going market rate is 20% a month. The Gao family would probably accept 15%."

"Monthly interest of 20%?" Wu De nearly shouted. Annual rate was 240%!

"Even at this rate, as long as we complete the cargo turnaround within a month, we'll still make money. If it comes to that, we can consider short-term borrowing!" Zhang Xin pulled out a document. "This is another proposal from the Guangzhou Station. It's a bigger matter and might be too slow to save the immediate crisis. But if we implement it, future cash flow will be much more comfortable."

"Good, I'll take a look."

Time was pressing. The *Ascending Peace Island* didn't linger. After loading the silver and making minor repairs, they replenished fresh water and immediately set off for Leizhou.

On the ship, Wu De opened the copy. It was a proposal suggesting that the Station's subordinate enterprises accept deposits from families of officials and wealthy households in Guangzhou and throughout Liangguang and Fujian.

"Deposits?" Wu De was so startled he jumped out of his chair. Only four words came to mind: "Pure fantasy!"
