# Chapter 345 - Products of the Pharmaceutical Factory

While Huang Dashan was trial-producing Sweet Potato Kvass, Shi Niaoren was washing bottles at the pharmaceutical factory. Glass bottles—long-requested from the Planning Committee—had finally arrived. Most were produced by the glass factory; some were recycled and sterilized. Thousands of bottles in various sizes were arranged in rattan baskets, filling the pharmaceutical factory's entire courtyard. Specifications ranged from 500ml containers for physiological saline down to small medicine vials.

The entire staff spent half a day washing bottles. The cleaned containers were then wheeled into the steam room for high-temperature steam sterilization—currently the most effective large-scale sterilization method available to the pharmaceutical factory.

With these bottles, the factory could finally produce finished products. Previously, there had been nowhere to put the output. Zhao Yanmei had established an all-glass distillation room, used for producing medical distilled water and extracting Chinese herbal medicine concentrates for injectable use.

Shi Niaoren studied this somewhat ungainly but not overly complex distillation apparatus, marveling at the glass factory's advancing capabilities. The array of intricate shapes, thick and thin pipes, multi-way connectors, and valves was impressive. Alcohol lamps flickered with blue flames beneath evaporating dishes containing yellow and white plant flowers. Liquid bubbled gently; steam traveled through pipes, passed through serpentine glass condenser tubes, and finally dripped into collection bottles.

The whole scene had an otherworldly quality—neither science fiction nor fantasy, but rather like a mad scientist's underground laboratory from some low-budget film.

"What's being produced here?"

"Distillation and extraction of honeysuckle—medicine for heatstroke prevention, specifically for summer heat colds." Hu Yicheng was on duty in the distillation room today, grateful to escape the basement strain cultivation facility. "Liu San says this can serve as a base liquid for Shuanghuanglian preparations."

"Is this safe?" Shi Niaoren murmured. Chinese medicine injections contained unclear ingredient profiles and numerous impurities. Injecting such mixtures into humans invited allergic reactions—and if one occurred, resuscitation might not be possible.

Hu Yicheng anticipated his concern. "This is for oral concentrated liquid. At worst, drinking it causes diarrhea. It definitely won't kill anyone."

"The risk still troubles me." Shi Niaoren sighed.

"After this batch, we're preparing to make Bupleurum Injection. The difficulty is somewhat lower. Liu San has dried a substantial supply in the courtyard. It's quite effective for fever and colds."

"Your efficiency with this equipment seems limited."

Liu San emerged from inside. "We've already ordered another set. The glass factory is fabricating it now. This time we're planning steam heating—far more efficient than burning alcohol lamps, and easier temperature control." He gestured toward his workspace. "Minister, please come sit."

He led Shi Niaoren into his Traditional Chinese Medicine pharmaceutical workshop.

This workshop occupied a large room of approximately one hundred square meters with high ceilings. A row of earthenware pots on stoves bubbled with Chinese medicine. The operating table was crowded with equipment—hay cutters for slicing herbs, mortars of various materials, sixteen-tael scales for Chinese medicine—items both familiar and unfamiliar to Shi Niaoren. Some Liu San had brought himself; others had been custom-made locally.

Shi Niaoren inhaled the medicinal aroma filling the air and found a stool.

"These are medicines I've compounded personally." Liu San enthusiastically presented a row of paper boxes and small porcelain bottles arranged on the table.

"This is Hemostatic Powder." He picked up a small porcelain bottle. "Made from Japanese Thistle—*Cirsium japonicum*. Functions include cooling blood and stopping bleeding: for bleeding syndromes caused by blood heat running recklessly—hematemesis, epistaxis, metrorrhagia, hematuria, and similar conditions. Also disperses stasis, detoxifies, and reduces swelling: for heat-toxin carbuncles, administered orally or applied externally..."

"Enough—stop reciting your Chinese medicine textbooks." Shi Niaoren regarded the bottle skeptically. He knew Chinese medicine had a characteristic whereby virtually every medicinal material could claim effectiveness against an enormous list of symptoms—yet genuinely critical applications were rarely so broad. "Does it actually work?"

"Absolutely. For field bleeding, immediately find Japanese Thistle, prepare a water decoction for oral administration—effective instantly. Crushing for external application also stops bleeding."

Shi Niaoren considered that some component must be reducing blood clotting time. This warranted organized research—future military operations would create substantial demand for hemostatic drugs.

"Additionally: tincture extracted with ethanol can lower blood pressure and inhibit human tuberculosis bacilli."

"Promising."

"This is Gastritis Pill—for stomach pain, acid reflux, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and similar conditions. The primary ingredient is Cuttlebone, obtained from the seafood processing factory. It can also be made into hemostatic medicine; very effective for knife wounds."

"This is Pig Bile Pill." Liu San continued. "It treats many things, but I know the Dean isn't interested in comprehensive lists. However, there's one use you'll definitely appreciate."

"Oh? What's that?"

"Cough suppression." Liu San said. "Pig bile powder's cough-suppressing effect has passed pharmacological testing. It also treats night blindness."

"Opium Tincture." Liu San produced another bottle bearing a danger mark. "Can be used for cough suppression, diarrhea control, and pain relief."

"What about addiction potential?"

Liu San spread his hands. "Difficult to say without animal testing. But I studied with Dean Zhao and Little Hu, consulted medical references, and prepared it according to pharmacopoeia specifications. Harmfulness should be minimal as long as usage is controlled."

"Don't produce it as a general panacea," Shi Niaoren instructed. "Divide it into three products. Diarrhea and pain relief medicines should be tablets—convenient for administration. Cough medicine should be syrup. Regardless of formulation, minimize opium content while maintaining efficacy—to prevent addiction."

Opium addiction wasn't as severe as modern hard drugs, but withdrawal remained extremely troublesome.

"Understood. We'll modify the formula." Liu San noted the request casually, then produced a small wooden box and opened it with theatrical mystery. "Dr. Shi, care to sample?"

Shi Niaoren looked inside. The box contained a dried, semi-withered leaf rolled into balls.

"Betel nut?" He picked one up and placed it in his mouth. Extremely bitter.

"Coca leaf."

"Mmh..." Shi Niaoren nearly spat it out.

"Relax—it won't cause addiction." Liu San grinned mischievously. "Or at worst, no more addictive than betel nut."

Shi Niaoren knew perfectly well that in South America, chewing coca leaves was practically a national pastime. Indigenous people used it to sharpen their minds, eliminate fatigue, increase stamina; also to ward off cold, treat illness, and relieve discomfort from stomach cramps, rheumatism, headaches, and other ailments. It was a mass consumer product.

"These leaves were picked from coca trees at the farm. The trees are still small—we only got a tiny amount. Everyone received a small share." Liu San said. "Once yields increase, we can harvest in quantity."

"What's the purpose of pursuing this?"

"Coca leaves are also medicinal." Liu San replied. "Using these instead of cigarettes as a diversion for soldiers and laborers—wouldn't that be preferable?"

"That's—" Shi Niaoren found the proposal rather extreme. Still, coca leaves did offer genuine stimulant effects and had real utility for military and labor applications. "Perhaps excessive?" Coca leaf was, after all, a mild drug—even if not strongly addictive.

"The Americans supplied Amphetamine to their soldiers during World War II, and they were much bigger believers in 'universal values' than us. Coca leaf is far less toxic than Amphetamine." Liu San produced another bottle and poured Shi Niaoren a full cup of dark liquid. "Try this."

"What is it?" Shi Niaoren's guard went up instantly.

"Cola."

"Cola? That's rare nowadays." Shi Niaoren examined the liquid suspiciously, took a sip—and indeed, it tasted like Cola. Somewhat sweeter, lacking carbonation—like Cola that had been sitting too long and gone flat.

"You made this yourselves?"

"Correct. Contains coca leaf distillate." Seeing Shi Niaoren's alarm, Liu San hastened to add: "In very small amounts. Almost negligible. Once we have baking soda, we can put Cola into production."

Strange indeed: Shi Niaoren reflected that soda water hadn't materialized, yet Kvass and Cola had both appeared. He decided not to pursue further inquiry, lest something else strange require him to serve as guinea pig.

"How is the willow bark extraction I mentioned previously progressing?"

Willow bark had been a commonly used antipyretic and analgesic in both Europe and Asia since ancient times. Its active component was salicylic acid—the foundation from which the modern drug Aspirin was developed.

Aspirin was chemically synthesized, still beyond the transmigrators' current capabilities. But extracting active compounds from willow bark wasn't particularly difficult and could deliver useful results.

"We're working on it. Some has been extracted. But willow trees are scarce here," Liu San reported.

"We should ask Wu Nanhai to plant more along the rivers. They'll beautify the scenery while serving as raw material." Shi Niaoren knew the effective medicinal compounds in willow bark and leaves were present in very low concentrations; extracted products would have limited potency. But Aspirin was an extraordinarily useful analgesic and antipyretic with anticoagulant and anti-rheumatic properties. At the current stage, it was the closest thing to a panacea.

Liu San said, "I have a request. I hope the Minister will raise it with the Executive Committee."

"Oh? What request?"

"Acquire the herbal medicine shop in the county seat."

"Runshitang?" Shi Niaoren knew Liu San frequently visited this pharmacy to purchase medicine and process materials. Their cooperation seemed harmonious. "Aren't you working well together?"

"Shopkeeper Yang's thinking is sound, and he's reliable enough for routine matters. But since I'm not the owner, many decisions aren't mine to make. Several skilled professionals there are being underutilized." He poured himself a cup of "Cola." "Besides, the pharmacy's foundation is too thin—they can't even participate in medicine markets, and precious materials are never stocked. As a partner, they're too weak. They need an infusion of resources. I originally wanted to invest personally, but I have no silver..."

"You want the Executive Committee to acquire it, then install yourself as shopkeeper?"

"I don't want to be the shopkeeper—being the owner who guides their operations is enough. Shopkeeper Yang inside lacks broader vision, but he's eager to learn. A trainable talent."
