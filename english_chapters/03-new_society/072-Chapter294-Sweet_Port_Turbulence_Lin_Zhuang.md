# Chapter 294: Sweet Port Turbulence — Lin Zhuang

"Listening to Brother Zhanfeng's words in the tea stall, you seem quite familiar with Lin Zhuang?" Chen Tianxiong went directly to the point.

"More than familiar," Xiao Zhanfeng said. "He was originally my neighbor!"

It turned out that Lin Zhuang's and Xiao Zhanfeng's families had originally lived on Hai'an Street. Because Xiao Zhanfeng's father owned little land at home, he engaged in modest commerce and actually prospered. To enable his children to study and distinguish themselves, he relocated to the county seat for access to better private schools.

"Lin Zhuang has been a king of children since youth," Xiao Zhanfeng laughed. "He loves the spotlight, talks of loyalty, enjoys making friends. Originally quite decent. What a pity!" He shook his head. "This person fell in with the wrong crowd and developed bad habits. The few hard-earned coins he made stoking fires at the sugar mill were either squandered in 'private doors' or donated to others at gambling tables."

"I see." Chen Tianxiong reflected that this was merely personal morality. Eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling didn't necessarily indicate incapacity; a proper gentleman wasn't necessarily talented. If Xiao Zhanfeng's insight extended only this far, it was rather superficial.

"...This is still a minor matter," Xiao Zhanfeng's face flushed slightly—he rarely drank distilled spirits. "It's just that bad habits inevitably compromise virtue. Take this occasion for example—"

This time, when Lin Zhuang took the lead filing suit at the county *yamen*, the sugar mill workers had pooled funds—the *yamen* gates open like the character 'eight': don't enter without money, even if you're in the right. Regardless of whether a lawsuit could be won, managing relationships up and down required customary expenses.

"This Lin Zhuang is something! Using the lawsuit as pretext, he collected substantial funds from the workers, embezzling at least half for himself. When the lawsuit was lost, he claimed everything was spent, swallowed the remaining funds, and left everyone destitute."

"That's not all. Later, Third Master Zhu gave him silver to maintain the sugar mill workers in readiness for causing South China trouble. Who knows how many times he collected silver before and after. Yet recently, I watched him lose over ten taels in a single sitting at the casino. Meanwhile, the old and young camped before Zou Monk Temple drink moldy rice porridge every day—letting him take the lead, these sugar mill workers must be blind."

This assessment differed dramatically from the "still a decent person" Zhou Shizhai had reported earlier—this was practically character assassination.

"Isn't the rumor outside that he's still a decent person?"

"Heh—ordinary people don't know his tricks. He also plays the part well, wearing ragged clothes all day, looking miserable. Actually, you need only visit Aunt Ai's place on the county's back street to see what his lifestyle really is. Couldn't be clearer."

"Who is Aunt Ai?"

Xiao Zhanfeng paused and smiled. "Right—you've only been here a few months, so naturally you wouldn't know."

Aunt Ai was a locally famous procuress who presided over a large "private door"—most of the county's clandestine prostitutes lodged with her. Besides women, she also operated a casino—a den of iniquity for Xuwen County's underclass.

"Are you quite familiar with Aunt Ai?" Chen Tianxiong asked abruptly, testing whether he was honest. A person possessing minor flaws didn't particularly trouble Chen Tianxiong, but he feared hypocrites. Xiao Zhanfeng spoke enthusiastically about others, but his words implied familiarity with casinos and "private doors"—perhaps he wasn't the upright gentleman he appeared.

"Not familiar with her, but very familiar with someone inside her establishment." Xiao Zhanfeng seemed unaware of Chen Tianxiong's testing and answered high-spiritedly. "I'm a pauper—Aunt Ai's eyes are extremely mercenary."

It turned out he had a distant female relative—widowed for many years—who now worked as a kitchen maidservant there. Xiao Zhanfeng often went to visit her.

As for why he frequented Aunt Ai's establishment, he kept silent—obviously nothing praiseworthy. Chen Tianxiong suspected it mostly involved some ambiguous relationship with this widow. It would be indelicate to press further.

He immediately dropped the subject, and they chatted about everything under heaven. Xiao Zhanfeng showed intense interest in South China's mechanized sugar production. Chen Tianxiong explained some basic principles to satisfy his curiosity. Unfortunately, everything Xiao Zhanfeng had studied since childhood consisted of the Thirteen Classics—"science and technology" was a distant concept. He hadn't even read ancient Chinese technical treatises, making explanation quite laborious.

"Viewed this way, my generation are truly frogs in a well!" Though Xiao Zhanfeng failed to understand eight sentences out of ten, he listened with rapt attention and finally uttered this conclusion.

"It's just that South China's current situation is concerning." Judging the time ripe, Chen Tianxiong steered back to the topic.

Xiao Zhanfeng said inscrutably: "How so?"

Chen Tianxiong immediately recounted the matter of Third Master Zhu preparing to incite sugar mill workers to cause trouble.

Xiao Zhanfeng nodded. "I've also heard rumors of this. However, I believe this matter won't erupt. Even if it does, it will be loud thunder but little rain."

"Why so?"

"Hasn't Shopkeeper Chen heard of 'nurturing bandits to enhance one's importance'?"

These words gave Chen Tianxiong a revelation. Xiao Zhanfeng said proudly: "What sort of material is Lin Zhuang? A thing with a hard mouth but soft spine. Setting aside that if the matter erupts, the *yamen* will investigate—at minimum, detention for a few days and a beating is inescapable. Even if Third Master Zhu intercedes at the *yamen*, suffering is inevitable. Besides, if South China is truly toppled, isn't he afraid of Third Master Zhu burning the bridge after crossing?"

"Correct, correct!" Chen Tianxiong suddenly understood—this scholar's vision was indeed sharp. Once South China fell, Third Master Zhu would no longer need to give Lin Zhuang silver to maintain the sugar mill worker team; instead, the workers would be grateful to Third Master Zhu directly. How could Lin Zhuang, a person who relied on intermediation and playing both sides for profit, continue his game?

"Then, in Brother Zhanfeng's view, how should this matter be resolved?" Chen Tianxiong felt genuine respect.

"Just call me Zhanfeng." Xiao Zhanfeng probably rarely received such deference and couldn't help feeling that "a scholar dies for his bosom friend." He immediately poured out all his views on the matter.

"Third Master Zhu also knows Lin Zhuang is unreliable, so he organized another group—Zhao the Chicken Foot's gang of hoodlums. They're desperadoes who fear nothing; unfortunately, their numbers are too small to accomplish anything. So to cause trouble at South China, sugar mill workers and hoodlums depend on each other. If the sugar mill workers don't riot, the hoodlums can't fish in troubled waters." Xiao Zhanfeng tapped and sketched on the table with his chopsticks. "How could Lin Zhuang not know Third Master Zhu's calculation? If Zhao the Chicken Foot's people cause trouble, the sugar mill workers will inevitably take the blame. So he keeps stalling, just to extract more benefits from Third Master Zhu. But in case Lin Zhuang is forced by Third Master Zhu to act, things will get big."

Chen Tianxiong listened intently. Comparing the beginning and end, wasn't Xiao Zhanfeng's current statement contradicting his earlier "the matter won't erupt"? Reflecting silently, this man was a scholar after all—"making shocking statements" was probably habitual.

But there was no need to puncture it now. Overall, his analysis made sense, and he mentioned many details they hadn't originally grasped. Being local, he naturally saw things more clearly.

"So—"

"So as long as Lin Zhuang is subdued, Zhao the Chicken Foot's gang achieve nothing."

"That's precisely my intention!" Chen Tianxiong said. "But I hear it's already too late. They say they'll burn incense and swear oaths at Zou Monk Temple in three days..."

"Everyone in Xuwen knows this." Xiao Zhanfeng was dismissive. "Shopkeeper Chen, consider: if violence were truly imminent, it would proceed through secret networking, gathering suddenly to burn incense and launch the action when the time came. How can there be an affair where the incense-burning is known throughout the city three days in advance? Besides, Lin Zhuang's so-called incense-burning and oath-swearing is merely 'swearing an oath'—nowhere does it say they'll act immediately."

He grew more animated as he spoke. "Lin Zhuang was merely pressed urgently by Third Master Zhu, making a gesture—counting as earning his silver. So three days hence, he definitely won't move. Do you think a leader would still be soaking in private doors gambling and whoring just days before taking action?"

So this was the true meaning of Xiao Zhanfeng's claim that "this matter won't erupt—even if it does, it will be loud thunder but little rain." Chen Tianxiong nodded inwardly—this person did possess ability.

"So there's ample time to subdue Lin Zhuang."

"Does that mean Lin Zhuang isn't at Zou Monk Temple?" Chen Tianxiong asked.

"How could he be there!" Xiao Zhanfeng said. "Ever since Third Master Zhu recruited him, he's been lodging at Aunt Ai's place. Living quite comfortably. He's probably still there now."

"Then I would like to meet him and 'make a friend.'" Chen Tianxiong cupped his hands. "I must trouble Brother Zhanfeng for guidance!" He added: "I'm an outsider, completely in the dark here—I rely entirely on your assistance."

"Easy enough, easy enough!" Xiao Zhanfeng bowed in return. "Whatever service I can render, I'll do my utmost."

Seeing that he didn't decline at all, Chen Tianxiong recognized him as someone willing to take responsibility. He produced ten taels of silver and placed them on the table.

"Listening to your words is better than reading ten years of books," Chen Tianxiong said. "Brother Zhanfeng's life is hard. Please accept this bit of silver for household expenses. There will be further thanks in future!"

"Cannot accept." Xiao Zhanfeng refused flatly. "I absolutely will not take money. Please take it back. I spoke these words because I consider you, Shopkeeper Chen, a friend. If the conversation weren't agreeable, even ten thousand taels wouldn't induce me to bother speaking."

Here was a person with backbone, though the latter words sounded somewhat boastful to Chen Tianxiong. He immediately pocketed the silver again. "In that case, I'll return tomorrow. At that time, I'll ask Brother Zhanfeng to lead the way so we can subdue Lin Zhuang."

"What's so difficult? Going today is also possible."

"No need," Chen Tianxiong said. "I still have matters on hand to attend to. Since the situation hasn't reached that stage, tomorrow will suffice."

Chen Tianxiong returned to the sugar firm with Zhou Shizhai. Though he hadn't seen Lin Zhuang today, befriending someone like Xiao Zhanfeng was a significant gain. Chen Tianxiong preferred letting matters cool before proceeding. After a moment's thought, he invited Zhou Shizhai inside.

"Master Zhou!" He went straight to the point. "What's your assessment of this Xiao Zhanfeng today? Is he trustworthy?"

Zhou Shizhai had worked as an escort for years and possessed extensive experience judging people.

"Trustworthy." Zhou Shizhai was unequivocal.

"Mm, I also think this person is usable." Chen Tianxiong said. "But one cannot lack vigilance toward others. Ideally—this is the critical moment—please take a few local brothers to inquire about Xiao Zhanfeng's background."

"All right. I'll go immediately." Zhou Shizhai departed at once.

That evening, the sugar factory workers who had gone to lobby the sugar mill workers returned one by one. A single day's efforts naturally produced limited effects, but the news they brought back was clear: many unemployed workers were depressed and saw no hope for the future. Though Lin Zhuang supplied moldy rice daily for bare subsistence, everyone felt that living on charity like this was no long-term solution.

Plans for burning incense and swearing oaths did indeed exist. And recently, someone had been constantly inciting them to storm the South China Sugar Factory, claiming that once South China was destroyed, Leizhou's sugar mills would recover. The sugar boiling masters were most enthusiastic about this—after all, restoring old methods benefited them most, so they were willing to take risks. But ordinary workers felt that storming a sugar factory and engaging in smashing and fighting amounted to "violating the King's law." Even if old methods were restored, it was still just a mouthful of rice—their enthusiasm was correspondingly tepid. Plus, the leader Lin Zhuang maintained an ambiguous attitude and never declared his position. Without someone leading, no one was willing to stick their neck out—hence the deadlock.

Viewed this way, Xiao Zhanfeng's judgment that "incense-burning" was only "oath-swearing" and not "launching action" was completely accurate. Chen Tianxiong immediately instructed these messengers to continue activities tomorrow, hinting to unemployed workers: South China was willing to recruit workers, not only paying wages but also providing relief for entire families.

Regardless of how many unemployed workers they might attract, at minimum it would sow confusion—though Lin Zhuang had apparently never truly unified the people. This ancient labor leader still harbored too many selfish calculations and could accomplish nothing.

Viewed this way, the matter was eighty or ninety percent settled. Buying off Lin Zhuang tomorrow probably wouldn't require much effort.

The next day, still accompanied by Zhou Shizhai, the two dressed as an outside merchant and his servant. First, they secretly took a sedan chair to the "Dachang Rice Shop" in the county seat—this was where Liao Daxing had originally worked as a shop assistant, so the relationship between the two establishments was special. South China's rice was all purchased from there, and Boss Zhu of the rice shop was naturally extremely attentive to such a major customer.

To avoid potential spies, after the two arrived, they sent a shop assistant to invite Xiao Zhanfeng. After Xiao Zhanfeng arrived, Chen Tianxiong's group was led by him to Aunt Ai's establishment.

Entering through the front door and exiting through the back. Behind the rice shop was a small alley. Walking dozens of meters, they turned onto a long street paved with extremely smooth bluestone slabs. Looking around, rows of buildings were quite orderly. Pedestrians on the street were dressed considerably more neatly than in Lingao—thanks to the booming sugar industry, Xuwen was considered quite a prosperous place.

However, "private doors" were never in lively locations. Xiao Zhanfeng led the way, turning past the county *yamen* entrance and entering a quiet area behind the county seat. Roads here were mostly lined with the rear walls of large households' compounds. Fire walls towered high, with only small doors opening one by one. Pedestrians were scarce.

Turning a few more corners, they walked up to a double-opening small door. Xiao Zhanfeng stopped and said: "This is it."
