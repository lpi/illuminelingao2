# Chapter 527 - Verbal Sparring

"There must certainly be some accounting."

Xiao Zishan immediately stepped forward to announce that the caretaker cabinet's first order of business would be to establish a "Maid Countermeasures Committee," with Wen Desi appointed as chairman, tasked specifically with discussing procurement, training, and allocation mechanisms for personal secretaries and formulating the corresponding policies and regulations.

"The Committee's office will be located in Room 1111 of the Executive Committee compound. A dedicated forum will also be opened on the internal BBS for discussion! We guarantee no posts will be deleted. We hope everyone will participate enthusiastically," Xiao Zishan's voice rang out.

"Cut the crap—don't let discussions drag on for another six months or a year," Sun Li shouted. "Give us a deadline!"

"By Lunar New Year's Eve, the proposal discussions will be completed. Immediately after the Spring Festival, personnel will be dispatched to handle matters. Of course, solving everything at once will be difficult," Xiao Zishan said. "It can only be done gradually, in batches. We ask for everyone's understanding…"

"We've 'understood' for a year and a half now. Please allow us a moment of *not* understanding," Shan Liang said, glowing with vigor, his words ringing with force. The sensation was wonderful; his self-regard had never been higher. "How many people are in this first batch? Who qualifies for it? By what criteria? Where are the standards—the conditions? Are there measures to ensure fairness and reasonableness, so the masses don't lose out?" He turned to face the crowd and shouted, "Xi Shi goes to the leadership; the homely ones go to the masses—does everyone agree to that?!"

"No!" Sun Li leaped out to lead the chant; the others, finding it reasonable, joined in. The quality of indigenous girls was something everyone had observed: not quite unbearable to look at, but mostly just enough to satisfy physiological needs. Of course, there were always a few exceptions in any crowd—and who could guarantee those exceptions wouldn't be snapped up by the leadership first?

Xiao Zishan knew that Shan Liang and his company were angling to earn political capital today. But the question struck at something critical; it had to be answered seriously.

"That question…" Xiao Zishan was about to say the matter needed to be decided collectively. But Wen Desi waved his hand and stepped forward again.

"Comrades!" he bellowed, raising his voice. No one had expected the famously measured Director Wen to suddenly unleash such a passionate cry—loud enough to be heard clearly by everyone without a microphone.

"I have been appointed chairman of the Maid Countermeasures Committee—an honor the organization has conferred upon me, and I would be remiss to decline!" Wen Desi was all smiles. "I would like to offer my personal thoughts on this matter. Does anyone object?"

The Law-Studies Club members broke into applause; the others hesitated, then applauded halfheartedly.

Wen Desi was entirely unfazed by the tepid reception. He continued, passionately laying out his proposal:

"My personal view is this: to resolve this issue effectively, fairly, reasonably, and efficiently, we must introduce an ISO quality-management system…"

Seeing the cold response, Director Wen promptly translated theory into practice. With a sweep of his hand, his voice rose several more degrees:

"Everyone draws lots! Whatever number you draw is your number. You select girls in order of rank. Number one picks first! But whoever is ranked first is not allowed to dawdle. You have one day to pick a girl from the candidates; if you don't, you forfeit—and drop to the bottom of the current round.

"The previous person must finish before the next can pick. If you want to trade—fine. Handle it yourself and register at the, uh, relevant department. You may only trade *before* you've used her! Once used, she's yours. No regrets after trading, either. We are comrades, not a wife-swapping—er, secretary-swapping club. Everyone must keep this in mind: do not corrupt our pure social mores or comradely friendship! Also, trading only—no gifting. The collective needs you to produce the next generation!

"You may also trade your selection-priority number! For example, if you're number one and you're willing to trade with number 250… fine—he becomes number one, and you become 250. You must both register and notarize the exchange; no reneging.

"Do not touch anyone else's designated secretary. How to punish violations will depend on the group's wishes. If I draw a number in the top fifty, I will relinquish that rank and drop to the very end. Or—if I happen to draw something in the top ten, I'll put that rank up as a prize for everyone to draw again… whoever draws it trades with me, and I'll throw in a jar of my personal, homemade, secret-recipe rice wine—excellent for strengthening the body, indescribably marvelous. That's how a mature man handles things."

Before anyone could recover, An Xi was the first to shout, "Chairman Wen has devoted such painstaking thought and care to us, the masses! Truly, truly…" Evidently realizing that "dearer than our own parents" would sound too sycophantic, he improvised: "Truly he is our bosom friend!"

"Oh, please," Wen Desi smiled. "Don't call me Chairman anymore—I'm just an ordinary transmigrator now! This is merely a humble suggestion, for everyone's reference—and for the caretaker cabinet's consideration."

No one applauded or cheered. The Law-Studies Club members felt that An Xi's words were far too low-level, far too saccharine; they were too embarrassed to echo them.

Ma Jia thought: An Xi's boot-licking skills are only beginner-level, but his "shamelessness" has reached grandmaster. Though the man was usually quite capable in his work, one had to stay wary of him.

The rank and file in the plaza were skeptical but intrigued. Director Wen's proposal was operationally feasible and easy to understand; tempers cooled. Some murmured discussions broke out; others asked about details. The atmosphere grew somewhat lively, and the confrontational mood dissipated considerably.

Shan Liang and his cohort watched the fickle masses toss their "people's representatives" aside as quickly as they might discard yesterday's news. They grew anxious. Yet Wen Desi's scheme clearly appealed to the rank and file; Shan Liang could not find an opening to challenge it. He was scratching his head when Cheng Mo, having just received a phone call, suddenly remembered something. He squeezed forward and bellowed:

"Comrades, do not be deceived by the Executive Committee! Have girls blinded your hearts? What was our purpose in coming to the Executive Committee? Was it just for a few girls?" He declaimed passionately, "If I say your awareness is low, it truly is. Girls are only the surface. What we are really opposing is people using authority to feather their own nests!"

The crowd's attention was immediately recaptured. Seeing the favorable turn, Cheng Mo was about to continue when Shan Liang, unwilling to let his thunder be stolen, jumped in:

"Chang Shide, the corrupt element hidden among the people, is a case in point. If you say Leizhou is dangerous—isn't Wen Tong, director of the South China Sugar Refinery, in danger too? Isn't Xiao Gui, the chief technical engineer, in danger? Isn't Zhan Tianxiong from Political Security in danger? Leacing Wen Tong aside—Xiao Gui worked tirelessly supervising the installation of sugar-refining equipment; his life was even threatened. He has no girl. Why should Chang Shide, who embezzled public funds to buy his own girl, have one? Who approved Old Chang's girl purchase? Nobody! Who approved Old Chang's use of a girl? Nobody!"

Xiao Zishan's expression turned ugly. He had been watching Director Wen's grand snow job wrap things up, only for a wrench to be thrown in midstream. After a moment's thought, he said:

"The various issues everyone has raised certainly exist. That is precisely why we dissolved the Executive Committee and are preparing to convene the Second General Assembly. At that assembly, everyone will discuss and resolve these problems together." He paused. "Therefore, the caretaker cabinet's second order of business is to establish a preparatory committee for the Second General Assembly."

"Who are the members of this preparatory committee? Will it just be a few Executive Committee people chatting casually again?"

"How the preparatory committee is constituted—who composes it—will be decided by the entire transmigrator community," Xiao Zishan said. "We plan to open a dedicated discussion forum on the internal BBS. Once a concrete framework emerges, we will vote to elect the committee members."

"The preparatory committee must include representatives from us, the masses. Otherwise, you Executive Committee types will just hijack it."

"First of all, we are not Executive Committee members—we are caretaker-cabinet members," Xiao Zishan said, a little irritated but maintaining a civil front. "Second, the preparatory committee members will be elected by the entire transmigrator community. There is no 'hijacking.'"

Shan Liang's voice boomed: "This matter must be settled today. We, the masses, demand that an independent supervisory committee for the preparatory committee—and for the future General Assembly—be established immediately. The election will be held right here! Its sole job will be to supervise the entire process!"

Xiao Zishan frowned; so this was Shan Liang's real aim all along. These provocateurs were clearly angling for "supervisory committee" positions. The matter was troublesome; he was in no position to promise or refuse on his own. Just as he was about to glance at Director Wen and the stone-faced Executive Committee members to see what they had to say, Ma Jia suddenly stepped forward:

"'We, the masses'? I'm sorry—I don't wish to be represented by you. I oppose this approach!" His face was full of righteousness, his voice ringing. "I am one of the organizers of this demonstration, but I want to state my position here: the Executive Committee has made mistakes, but its achievements are primary. I absolutely refuse to allow certain people to exploit the Executive Committee's errors to throw the transmigrated collective into chaos for their own unspeakable purposes. I am confident that no one here wants to be used as a firebrand! Everything must be built upon justice, order, and the rule of law!"

Ma Jia had wanted to add, "We absolutely must not allow mob politics," but decided that such a line would be taken too personally and might affect the overall situation. Better left unsaid.

An Xi, quick on the uptake, immediately followed suit: "We refuse to be represented!"

The Law-Studies Club members promptly joined the chorus:

"Stability above all!"

"Down with the careerists!"
