# Chapter 446 - Cooperation Partner

"Yes. Qiuhong once served as the fence for a bandit in the county. After we exterminated that bandit, the wealth conveniently fell into Qiuhong's hands."

"Does Chen Minggang know about this?"

"Of course he knows. However, I've come to understand some of their *jianghu* rules," Zhou Botao reported. "For this kind of thing, customarily the Fast Squad and Militia Squad should each receive a share. Chen Minggang should have at least offered a portion for the two squads to 'get a whiff.' Swallowing it all directly—they call that 'injuring the Tao.' Strictly speaking, it's a very serious breach."

"Let's hold off on releasing that matter for now. Wait until we need the Six Rooms to turn on each other like dogs before using it." Ran Yao paused. "But if there are any smaller tidbits, release a few first to stir up some internal conflict."

Zhou Botao understood perfectly. He immediately instructed his subordinates to pull out all the black materials on the Three Classes and Six Rooms collected over the past year—these had accumulated considerably. Since Gou Er's account books had been partially deciphered, many details of old incidents had been added, lending greater credibility to the rumors. He selected appropriate pieces and spread them one by one in complete sets.

A wind of suspicion immediately began to blow through the Lingao County Yamen. Lingao was a small place; rumors didn't take a day to travel from East Gate Market to the county seat. The "public duty" crowd in the county couldn't help but mutter—people who ate the yamen's rice harbored particularly many suspicions. Many old matters that had been fine when left unmentioned suddenly surfaced, bringing all manner of past grudges floating to the surface.

Beyond these rumors, news also spread that Chen Minggang was preparing to have the Australians undertake this year's tax collection. This information was released by Chen Minggang's apprentice on his orders. If the plan succeeded, so much the better; even if the Australians weren't prepared to wade into these murky waters, he intended to use the tiger's authority to frighten people with this grand signboard. After all, nobody was likely to dare ask the Australians directly whether it was true. Afterward, he could simply fabricate some money and grain figures to present to them.

Wang Zhaomin had no interest in these rumors, but the news about Chen Minggang attempting to draw the Australians into tax collection made him break out in a cold sweat. The rumor was now spreading vividly—it probably wasn't baseless. He hurriedly summoned Chen Minggang and demanded a straight answer: was there any truth to this?

"There is indeed such a thing." Chen Minggang answered openly. Though he maintained a respectful posture before Private Secretary Wang, his expression was brazenly arrogant—clerks in such remote places, because local administration depended so heavily upon them, often didn't even acknowledge the Magistrate, let alone a private secretary like Wang Zhaomin.

"How dare you!" Wang Zhaomin was so furious his beard scattered. "What manner of people are these Hair Bandits? You dare collude with them? When the Imperial Court's heavenly army arrives in the future, let's see how you extricate yourself!"

"Replying to Private Secretary Wang: if I can't extricate myself when that time comes, naturally there are taller men than this lowly one to hold up the sky." Chen Minggang's face turned thoroughly brazen.

Wang Zhaomin was instantly struck speechless. Speaking honestly, in this Lingao County Yamen, who could claim to be clean with no dealings with the Hair Bandits? Such a person probably couldn't be counted. For petty clerks, accepting a few circulation coupons was easily explained away. But for someone in his position, when the time came, he feared he couldn't explain things so simply.

Wang Zhaomin was, after all, a veteran private secretary with considerable composure. He said gravely: "Old Eight, I advise you to be sensible! This group of Hair Bandits is absolutely not benevolent. If you provoke them, I fear the one who suffers in the end will only be yourself!"

"Whether I suffer or not is a matter for later. For the immediate matter at hand, Private Secretary Wang has to devise some solution, doesn't he?" Chen Minggang showed no weakness. He knew perfectly well the Australians weren't easy to handle. But relying on his thorough knowledge of the county's money and grain affairs, even if the Australians possessed heaven-reaching abilities, without his help they couldn't collect grain. "Reasonable Burden"? That scheme was clever enough, but the grain it gathered was extremely limited—counting only as the government's "voluntary donation"—impossible to sustain long-term.

The immediate matter naturally referred to the upcoming autumn grain collection. Not just grain but also the surcharged Liao Supplies, as well as the county's miscellaneous taxes and poll money. All these things combined constituted the county's topmost priority. Wang Zhaomin had been racking his brains over this very issue.

The grain tax itself was manageable; Wang Zhaomin knew that with diligent pressing, it could generally be completed. Moreover, after the Australians exterminated the bandits this year, the powerful local landlords who had previously colluded with them had restrained themselves considerably. Openly opposing the government was something they probably wouldn't attempt. But now they had a better option—the Australians.

If they openly used the Australians as backing—just as they had colluded with bandits in the past—grain collection would become hideously difficult again.

It seemed that, no matter what, without cooperating with the Australians, this autumn tax would likely encounter enormous trouble. Thinking of this, Wang Zhaomin couldn't help but secretly curse Chen Minggang for his selfish maneuvering, approaching the Australians about autumn grain collection on his own initiative. Now, if Wang Zhaomin wanted to discuss cooperation with the Australians, they likely wouldn't give him the time of day without a steep price.

Xiong Buyou returned and reported his conversation with Chen Minggang to Wu De. Hearing that Chen Minggang also wanted to exploit the Crossing Group, Wu De was somewhat surprised—people fishing for money in boiling oil apparently existed everywhere.

"Looks like we've become quite the delicacy. Both Wang Zhaomin and Chen Minggang want to borrow our signboard." Wen Desi smiled upon hearing this.

"This way, we can properly negotiate the price." Wu De said. "Wang Zhaomin originally had no intention of cooperating with us—he just hoped we'd make a gesture. Now with Chen Minggang stirring the pot, he has no choice but to come to us. Saves us some effort."

"It looks like Chen Minggang will offer better terms."

"Should we cooperate with him?"

"I don't think that's necessary." Wu De didn't hesitate. "We didn't come to Lingao to play at being officials; we came to control the county yamen. There's no need for so many twists and turns. Besides, given our level of understanding of this society, if we try to outwit them professionally, we're probably no match for this gang of clerks."

Even the Magistrate himself couldn't fully comprehend the various official businesses within the county yamen, let alone outsiders like them. As foreign athletes competing against locals who knew all the rules, no matter how skilled they might be, they would still lose if they kept fouling.

To handle this situation, only brute force would work—destroying the old order, establishing new rules, and compelling everyone to operate under the new system they prescribed.

"Of course, in terms of data, we temporarily still need to rely on their expertise," Wu De continued. "Don't break with him openly just yet. See how sincere this fellow really is. In the meantime, we should prepare for takeover ourselves."

"Cooperate with Wang Zhaomin?" Xiong Buyou didn't much like this private secretary; he still felt someone like Chen Minggang, who talked prices and conditions directly, was more straightforward.

"Of course! That's the proper path." Wu De said with certainty. "Clerks are base people. We need to establish our own image; how can we mix with them? Wang Zhaomin and Wu Mingjin are dignified official lords. Their status in the common people's hearts is entirely different."

The leader is always good; it's the crooked-mouthed monks below who recite the scriptures wrong. This theory wasn't unique to modern times—since ancient days, Chinese common people had thought this way. For the Transmigrators to reverse such thinking wasn't something achievable overnight.

Because the autumn grain collection was imminent, various parties held a joint meeting. The meeting decided, with very Chinese characteristics, to establish a special County Yamen Leadership Working Group, directly controlled by Wu De's Civil Affairs Commission.

"Manpower and resources are at your disposal," Wen Desi told Wu De. "You can also direct the intelligence department. If necessary, dispatching the Special Reconnaissance Team is permissible as well—I've already spoken with Bei Wei. Available anytime. Concentrate our strength to take down the county yamen this time!"

"The responsibility is enormous," Wu De acknowledged. "But I will do my utmost. Also—find me a few ruthless individuals."

"Certainly," Wen Desi said. "Name whoever you want."

So Wu De transferred Zhou Dongtian over. Zhou Dongtian had been working on printing recently, his face perpetually smeared with ink. Because they were also testing lead type, he came directly to Wu De's office.

"Old Zhou," Wu De said, "I know you did odd jobs for Ran Yao. Recently you might have to perform this sideline on a larger scale."

Zhou Dongtian grinned, revealing white teeth.

That day, Zhang Youfu came to find Xiong Buyou, reporting that Private Secretary Wang wished to meet with the Crossing Group's big boss secretly at his humble abode. Xiong Buyou guessed it probably concerned the autumn tax collection again.

The following evening, at Zhang Youfu's manor, both sides held a secret meeting. Wang Zhaomin was pleased to see that not only Xiong Buyou had come but also a major figure—he recognized Wu De, knowing this person wielded great power among the Australians, belonging to the "Giant Scoundrel" tier.

After exchanging pleasantries, Wang Zhaomin cut to the chase: Was the recently rumored matter of Chen Minggang inviting them to undertake the autumn tax collection true?

"You could say there is, or say there isn't." Xiong Buyou spoke vaguely.

Wang Zhaomin cursed inwardly at this Hair Bandit's cunning but had to ask patiently: "What does 'both is and isn't' mean?"

"Chen Minggang did indeed come to mention this to us, but we are still deliberating and haven't reached a conclusion."

"Haven't reached a conclusion" meant there was still room for maneuvering. Wang Zhaomin understood this meant bargaining. He had to summon every ounce of his wits.

"What is the Noble Group's intention?"

"Chen Minggang promised several conditions," Xiong Buyou said. "Quite generous."

"Chen Minggang, that county termite, is nothing but a despicable petty person. Can the Noble Group truly trust him?"

Xiong Buyou laughed. "We trust him. We suspect he hasn't the nerve to cheat us either."

Wang Zhaomin pointed out earnestly that the so-called cheating didn't refer to discrepancies in money and grain figures. Rather, Chen Minggang would use the Transmigrators as cover to bully others, extorting everywhere he went.

"...You are new to this place and unfamiliar with the Great Ming and the local county situation. Base people like this have controlled county administration for more than a day—they are intimately acquainted with everyone high and low. If they borrow the Noble Group's prestige to play tricks and harm the common people, it would be greatly detrimental to the Noble Group's reputation!"

Wang Zhaomin knew the Australians valued their reputation relatively highly, so he could only try to move them from this angle.
