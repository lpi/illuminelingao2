# Chapter 299: Sweet Port Turbulence — Persuasion

The door stood open. Looking through, numerous sedan chairs were parked in the courtyard. The sounds of shuffling cards and rattling dice drifted faintly from the hall—evidently a gambling gathering was in progress. Many vendors selling cooked food extended from outside the door to inside; some apparently occupied the second courtyard as well. People entering and leaving were a motley assortment.

"Gambling operates openly here?" Chen Tianxiong was somewhat surprised.

"Correct. Aunt Ai's lover heads the county's criminal division. The advantages are numerous."

Xiao Zhanfeng explained that the kickbacks this gambling house paid annually amounted to around ten thousand, so no one ever questioned it. Looking through the doorway at the several gambling tables inside, Chen Tianxiong asked: "Can anyone enter?"

"Yes. The first courtyard allows free entry and exit. Regulars go to the back, but someone must introduce you."

So they went inside to look around. Pai Gow and Fantan were being played. Chen Tianxiong's aim was observing the environment, not gambling. Xiao Zhanfeng whispered: "He's usually inside the second gate."

"How do we get in?"

"A regular must introduce you. Follow me—let's go out first."

Exiting the door, they entered a small path alongside. Xiao Zhanfeng knocked on a door. A middle-aged woman emerged and seemed quite familiar with Xiao Zhanfeng. He introduced her: "This is my relative, Aunt Liu."

Xiao Zhanfeng spoke a few sentences in dialect with his aunt, then turned back: "Come inside first. That fellow Lin messed around until midnight last night and hasn't risen yet. I'll eat something first."

"How much longer will he be?"

"Should be soon—face-washing water was just sent in." Xiao Zhanfeng led them to a secluded spot. After a while, Aunt Liu brought a steamer basket of various dim sum.

"Would you gentlemen like some?" Xiao Zhanfeng grabbed a broken bun and stuffed it in his mouth. "No, we both ate this morning." Chen Tianxiong reflected that this scholar showed no qualms about eating brothel leftovers.

Xiao Zhanfeng guessed what they were thinking. "You must be laughing at me—a scholar, reduced to begging for food at a brothel. When a man is poor, his ambition shortens. When down and out, having rice is good enough—what dignity is there?"

After he finished, Aunt Liu led them through the woodshed to a moon gate.

"Passing through here takes you inside the second gate." Xiao Zhanfeng whispered. "After you enter, just observe—don't speak. When Lin Zhuang comes out, we'll approach him directly."

They followed Xiao Zhanfeng through the moon gate into a large hall. It was livelier here than outside—exquisite ivory chips instead of cash. Chen Tianxiong gradually discerned the values: Heaven-character chips were a hundred taels; Earth, fifty; Man, ten. The betting capital here approached five thousand taels from this small county seat. The wealth from the sugar industry was beyond imagination.

Xiao Zhanfeng pulled Chen Tianxiong to stand behind a Fantan table, waiting for Lin Zhuang. To avoid attention, Chen Tianxiong purchased small chips and placed random bets. Unexpectedly, his random betting won considerably—over a hundred taels by the first half's end.

Someone like Chen Tianxiong, betting randomly without any system and continuously winning, drew the entire venue's attention. Under dozens of gazes, his luck continued. By the term's end, he had netted over two hundred taels.

Chen Tianxiong stood slowly. "Pure luck!" He tossed the head money generously, giving the casino face—but there was no need to gamble further.

Almost an hour had passed with Lin Zhuang still absent. Xiao Zhanfeng whispered: "He's already here, but seeing your luck booming, I didn't dare disturb..."

Xiao Zhanfeng signaled with his eyes: that one is Lin Zhuang.

He saw seated beside the table a man about thirty, with rough hands, burn scars, grayish complexion, and vacant eyes—the look of excessive wine and women. Though seated, he held few chips and hesitated over betting.

"Old Lin! Why not place a bet?" The banker called.

"If you're treasuring your last coins, step down! Your luck's running cold."

Lin Zhuang couldn't decide. If these last taels were lost, he would be penniless. However reluctant to leave—especially reluctant to part from Little Jinxiu—he would be swept out immediately. The several hundred people before Zou Monk Temple were running out of food today. No silver meant no rice. To request more from Third Master Zhu, he would have to wait until at least the incense-burning.

After prolonged deliberation, he yielded his seat and ordered cold tea. Calculating how to extract more silver from Third Master Zhu, someone suddenly patted his shoulder: "Master Lin!"

Lin Zhuang turned and saw Zhou Shizhai watching with a smile. "Were you calling me?"

"Yes! Aren't you Master Lin Zhuang?"

"Yes, that's me." His eyes rolled over Zhou Shizhai. Seeing the man's dignified bearing, Lin Zhuang asked politely: "Does brother have business with me?"

"My master wishes to make your acquaintance. He's in the Warm Pavilion—please."

Lin Zhuang grew alert. If South China had found someone to deal with him, he couldn't cry for help and no one would listen. This wasn't Hai'an Street; the Haiyi Guild held no weight here.

He declined hastily: "I appreciate your master's kindness, but I have matters requiring attention—"

Before finishing, Zhou Shizhai grasped his wrist. "Master Lin—better come now. My master is very busy!" His smile remained warm, but his eyes were cold.

Sharp pain shot from Lin Zhuang's wrist; half his body went numb. He was escorted into the Warm Pavilion. Chen Tianxiong sat with his back to the light.

"This is our Master Chen." Zhou Shizhai introduced.

Lin Zhuang was half a *Jianghu* person. Knowing his situation was precarious, he quickly knelt and kowtowed.

"Stand up." Chen Tianxiong said.

"Yes—thank you, Master Chen." Lin Zhuang stood carefully, seeing Zhou Shizhai guarding the door, thinking he would suffer today.

Chen Tianxiong spoke forthrightly: "I was entrusted by South China's proprietor to speak with you. The matter between Haiyi Guild and South China Factory—bridges are bridges, roads are roads—originally has nothing to do with you sugar mill workers. I advise you to do fewer meaningless things. Avoid damaging harmony!"

"Wouldn't dare." Hearing this was someone from South China, Lin Zhuang's legs went soft. He collapsed to his knees, kowtowing repeatedly. His involvement in Third Master Zhu's affairs was known throughout Xuwen. The opponent might not dare move against Third Master Zhu, but crushing a mere fire stoker was effortless. How could he know if they intended using him as the "chicken" to warn the monkeys?
