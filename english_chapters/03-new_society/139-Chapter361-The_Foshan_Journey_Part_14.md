# Chapter 361 - The Foshan Journey (Part 14)

"Yes, I believe this presents a good opportunity for the Society to serve the court. I'm an old soldier myself—I fought for over ten years in Europe. I haven't cast cannons, but I've certainly fired them. I know the basic principles of artillery and can offer assistance."

"Excellent! And what of the cannon founders? There's no one here who knows how to cast Western cannons."

"The Portuguese won't part with their founders—requesting the Superior's intervention won't help. If you want craftsmen from Goa, you'll have to wait until next year."

"What shall we do then?" Li Luoyou had assumed that with Jesuit backing, hiring Portuguese founders would be straightforward. He hadn't anticipated they simply couldn't locate anyone. He turned inquiringly toward the Englishman.

"Don't look at me." Quark Qiong raised both hands. "The East India Company's founders are in India as well—where would we find any here?" He produced a pipe, packed it with tobacco, and puffed away thoughtfully. "But I do have an idea."

"What idea?"

"Borrow cannons! Have the Jesuits negotiate to borrow a few cannons from the Portuguese. Let the craftsmen measure them in person, then cast copies to identical dimensions. I'd wager there are no craftsmen in the world more skillful than the Chinese—show them the genuine article, and they'll figure out how to reproduce it."

This was a feasible approach. But borrowing cannons from the Portuguese required official government approval—it would necessitate considerable maneuvering. Li Luoyou felt confident about this; he had already arranged a marriage for his nephew with a strategist in Governor-General Wang Zunde's retinue. Through that connection, negotiating cannon-borrowing and casting shouldn't prove overly problematic.

"Borrowing cannons still requires approval from the Macao Municipal Council. The Jesuits cannot command the Council."

"I believe it will be fine. If Governor-General Wang Zunde issues an order, the Council won't dare refuse."

"But which cannons should we borrow?" Though enthusiastic, Li Luoyou remained an amateur in these matters.

"I think the twelve-pounders from the last campaign would be suitable," Quark Qiong offered. "I hear the Chinese army used them to kill the Tartar king."

"He was merely a barbarian chieftain. Hardly a king!"

"For pure defense, such large-caliber cannons are certainly most suitable. But they cannot be employed in field battles." Ma Yangchun, being a veteran, possessed far more experience than average. "When infantry requires fire support, these cannons prove too heavy. We must cast three-pounder and six-pounder pieces..." He noted that carts called carriages would be necessary to render them mobile in battle, enabling effective infantry support and cavalry defense.

Li Luoyou shook his head repeatedly—not in disagreement, but from knowing the Ming military situation too intimately. Never mind the shortage of horses; even if they possessed them, weren't soldiers cheaper than horses? A soldier's monthly pay amounted to only one or two taels; a horse cost dozens. Equipping artillery teams as foreigners did would prove unaffordable.

"Father, the court's demand for heavy cannons is great at present. Besides, the court lacks horses."

"Not just war horses—even draft horses are inadequate." Ma Yangchun had observed that in China, apart from the government, military, and a few wealthy individuals, horses were almost never seen. And the horses here were mostly small—he had initially believed the Chinese preferred using young horses, only later realizing otherwise.

"It seems we can only cast heavy cannons." Ma Yangchun considered the constraints. "But the largest in the Portuguese Macao batteries are merely eighteen-pounders..."

"That's close enough. Transporting the twelve-pounders during the Tianqi reign cost enormous effort."

They resolved to request the Macao Municipal Council loan them an eighteen-pounder, a twelve-pounder, and a six-pounder—one of each. Gun carriages and mounts would also be borrowed for replication. Li Luoyou still harbored hope—surely Xu Guangqi, with his learning, would recognize the importance of light field artillery?

Li Luoyou withdrew his abacus and roughly calculated expenses to establish pricing baselines for future cannon contracts.

"With a foundry established, I shall first preach the Gospel to the workers. Through them, I'll spread the Lord's word..." Ma Yangchun shifted from soldier back to priest. "Recently there is good news."

"What good news, Father?"

"The Lord's flock has grown. Do you remember Brother Lu Ruohua?"

"Of course—he escorted the cannons to the capital with the Portuguese."

"Not that one—that's Lu Ruohan." Ma Yangchun shook his head. "I mean Father Lu Ruohua, who went to Qiongzhou to spread the Gospel last year."

Li Luoyou vaguely recalled such a person. "John's missionary work there has achieved great results?"

"No, not John."

John was the famous Ming Catholic Wang Hongwei's son, baptized under that name. Wang Hongwei and Xu Guangqi had been the Jesuits' main hopes for missionary work in the Great Ming.

Ma Yangchun held his rosary, eyes raised heavenward. "Truly a miracle! Thanks be to God! The miracle expected in Ding'an City of Hainan Island instead occurred in Lingao City. The Lord's will is truly mysterious."

He praised Lu Ruohua's missionary achievements in Lingao at great length: hundreds baptized, a church and monastery established. He enthusiastically declared the Australians on the island to be a pious flock devoted to spreading the Gospel.

"Lingao? Australians?" Li Luoyou's expression grew serious. Australian goods had been famous throughout Guangdong for a year now. And he had heard about Australians arriving on iron ships to land at Lingao, building fortresses just as the Portuguese had once done in Xiangshan Ao. But after landing, this group had remained quiet—apart from sending ships to trade in Guangzhou, selling various exotic wares and purchasing supplies, they hadn't committed any outrageous acts.

"Indeed—the Australians now residing in Lingao. I hear they've built a fortress there called Bairren." Ma Yangchun knew considerable detail because of Lu Ruohua's correspondence.

"They probably wish to repeat what the Portuguese accomplished," Quark Qiong observed. "Honestly, I'd quite like to see these strange people."

"I hear there are your countrymen among them," Ma Yangchun said with a smile. "Brother Lu reports meeting several English-speaking women."

"Australians fancy English women?" Quark Qiong laughed heartily. "I really should visit—it's been so terribly long since I've tasted a female compatriot's company."

Ma Yangchun smiled. "Perhaps they are fond of the English. Brother Lu's letter says many of them know European languages, but almost everyone speaks English."

"That's truly strange." Quark Qiong's curiosity was piqued. "I cannot imagine what use learning English would serve for anyone outside England?"

In this era, intellectuals employed Latin; common people used their own tongues. French hadn't even spread to the French countryside. Yet here in the East was a group where everyone could speak some English—a phenomenon defying all social norms that no one could comprehend.

"God protect them—they're all believers in the Lord and haven't fallen into heresy..." Ma Yangchun crossed himself, then addressed Quark Qiong earnestly. "Mr. Quark, the Lord's door is always open for lost sheep..."

"Father—" Quark Qiong recognized another attempt was coming to reconvert him to Catholicism from the Church of England. Faith or its absence made no difference to this Englishman. As he'd once confessed when in his cups: if necessary, he could believe any religion at any moment, or abstain from belief entirely. This Englishman didn't believe in God at all—a thorough "no King, no God" gold-worshipper who placed faith only in glittering gold.

"Let's not discuss this," Li Luoyou interjected, changing the subject. "Australian goods are exquisitely crafted—some appear European yet even superior. I would very much like to examine their craftsmanship."

"I'd like to see it too," Quark Qiong agreed. "Trade with them directly. And witness the legendary iron ships for myself. But the Ming court won't permit us to travel inland. And the seas aren't safe."

Li Luoyou said, "Mr. Quark, if you wish it, we can visit Lingao together next month. On my ship."

"Yes, I shall definitely go." Quark Qiong, ever seeking fresh trade opportunities, accepted readily.

The three chatted late into the night before dispersing. The next morning, Li Luoyou first dispatched men with birthday gifts to the Lin residence, reaching an understanding with Lin Ming. Ma Yangchun began giving catechism lessons to several branch employees. Li Luoyou felt that having his staff embrace the faith proved beneficial—at minimum, it provided them spiritual sustenance and forestalled idle thoughts.

At dinner, Yang Shiyi came to call. After the meal, the two closeted themselves in the study for a lengthy discussion, finalizing the ginseng transaction. Yang Shiyi's smile nearly split his face—he was acquiring Li Luoyou's ginseng at sixty taels per *jin* and would wholesale it at one hundred taels. Retail prices approached two hundred taels per *jin*. He profited on both ends.

Quark Qiong had to remain confined in the trading house owing to his appearance. Li Luoyou knew how to entertain foreign merchants—good food, fine drink, and occasionally a woman for diversion. Quark Qiong, far less particular than transmigrators, accepted everything with appreciative smiles. Besides eating, drinking, and enjoying himself, his other occupation was examining product samples that Manager Cheng collected daily from various shops, selecting styles Europeans would favor. Sometimes he would draw designs and patterns himself to commission custom orders.
