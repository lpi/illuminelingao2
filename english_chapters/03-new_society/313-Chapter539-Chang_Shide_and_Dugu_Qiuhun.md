# Chapter 539 - Chang Shide and Dugu Qiuhun

The charges originally prepared against Chang Shide were severe. Shan Liang and his cohort had pushed for "embezzlement of public funds," but the Senate Standing Committee—and the Executive Committee majority—rejected it.

A faction led by Ji Tuisi argued that Chang Shide's conduct wasn't even illegal. When the Executive Committee dispatched him to Leizhou, they had placed no restrictions on fund usage. The mission was results-oriented: as long as he succeeded, how he spent the money was his discretion. At worst, the fault lay with the Executive Committee's loose authorization, not Chang Shide's spending.

Some even suggested that Shan Liang's crusade was driven by jealousy. The Leizhou team had risked their lives, seized the sugar market, opened trade with Vietnam, secured a food lifeline, and discovered the Hongji coal deposits. Given these monumental achievements, spending a few dozen taels of silver on women for personal enjoyment seemed trivial. Fixating on it, they argued, would only demoralize frontline personnel.

Shan Liang insisted on "separating merit from fault," demanding corruption be nipped in the bud. But as the hearings approached, his support evaporated. The new Executive Committee showed zero interest in prosecuting a hero. Left with no choice, Shan Liang downgraded the charge to "misappropriation of funds."

Ji Xin knew acquittal was inevitable. The sum in question—a mere ten taels—was absurdly low. Even under Ming law, it wouldn't qualify as a crime.

Before the hearing, following Ma Jia’s instructions, Ji Xin circulated background dossiers to the juror Senators. These files detailed the Leizhou Station's brutal operating conditions and the current work assignments of the five slave girls. It was standard procedure, but the subtext was clear: *Look at what they achieved. Look at what they endured.*

Merit didn't erase fault, but it certainly provided context.

When Mu Quan read the bill of inquiry, stating "...willfully misappropriating public funds totaling a staggering ten taels of silver," laughter rippled through the room.

"Does the accused have anything to say?" Ma Jia asked.

Chang Shide rose, calm and collected. "I wish to make a statement."

"Permission granted."

Chang Shide didn't dodge. He admitted that purchasing the women included personal gratification. But he argued that the women were essential station assets. They handled housekeeping, logistics, and daily operations—work that required personnel regardless. His use of them was merely "value-added."

"These women primarily serve the collective; serving me is secondary," Chang Shide said. He listed their contributions, then played his ace. "During our darkest hour, when thousands of rioters threatened to burn us alive and chop us into meat paste, when even our paid indigenous staff wavered... these five women stood firm. They vowed to live and die with the station. Why? Has anyone considered that?"

The Senators looked blank.

Chang Shide raised his voice. "Precisely because I had bedded—er, taken them in!"

The room erupted in laughter.

"Trust built on physical intimacy is the strongest bond in this timeline," Chang Shide continued with a straight face. "Slave girls regard being 'taken in' by their master as the ultimate favor. It buys absolute loyalty. We must adapt to local customs to survive."

"So you also opened the chrysanthemums of the Wen brothers?" a Senator shouted. "The files say they're loyal too!"

The room roared.

"I have no such predilection," Chang Shide deadpanned. "But you're welcome to try."

Ma Jia banged his gavel. "Order! Questions must be recognized!"

Chang Shide continued his performance, mixing absurdity with logic, charming the room completely. Shan Liang fumed in silence. The man was turning a corruption trial into a stand-up comedy routine.

Finally, Chang Shide made his closing offer. Since his use of the women was controversial, he offered to purchase them personally.

"They will continue to serve the station, but I will reimburse the collective. Of course, certain services can only be provided to me; I regret they cannot serve the public."

More laughter.

"This is my small contribution. Thank you." Chang Shide sat down.

The vote was a formality. 19 to 6: Not Guilty.

Ma Jia announced the verdict: the charge of misappropriation was not sustained. However, acknowledging the private benefit, Chang Shide was ordered to pay the full purchase price of four slave girls—eight taels total—into the Treasury within fifteen days. (One girl was deducted as his standard "maid benefit.")

Chang Shide accepted the ruling unconditionally. He shook hands with his entourage, looking every inch the victorious statesman.

During the recess, Ji Xin stepped outside for a smoke. He found Ma Jia drinking water by a tree.

"That guy can talk," Ji Xin said. "He turned the whole room around."

Ma Jia smiled forcefully. "Eloquence matters. But didn't the response feel a bit... orchestrated?"

"The lobbying," Ji Xin murmured. "The interest groups are flexing their muscles."

"It's unavoidable," Ma Jia said, pouring the dregs of his water onto the roots of the tree. "The key is balance."

Ji Xin wasn't sure how that balance would be held, but Ma Jia seemed confident.

Then came Dugu Qiuhun.

The atmosphere shifted instantly. The questioning was sharp, the hostility palpable. The initial charge of "rebellion" had been dropped after fierce opposition from the Army and Police, but the remaining charges were serious: "unauthorized mobilization of armed forces," "intent to inflict bodily harm on transmigrators," and "intent to destroy public property" (for the Telecom Building plan).

After Ji Xin read the charges, Dugu Qiuhun stood up. He looked haggard but defiant.

"I mobilized the police to maintain order," he stated. "To prevent the situation from escalating."

"In addition to being Precinct Chief, I am the Outer Perimeter Security Commander. I have the authority to handle emergencies. When there is a protest march, I have the duty to prevent vandalism, looting, and arson. Therefore, I cannot accept the charge of 'unauthorized mobilization.'"

Shan Liang jumped in immediately. "On what basis did you presume the demonstrators would commit vandalism? Isn't that a 'presumption of guilt'? Do you have so little faith in your fellow transmigrators?"

"Every protest in the world requires police containment," Dugu shot back. "What makes you think transmigrators are special?"
