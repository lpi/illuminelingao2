# Chapter 540 - Hailin's Scheme

He glared hard at Shan Liang for a moment, then raised his voice: "I think not."

"This whole affair is a smear and a frame-up against me personally," Dugu Qiuhun shouted, proclaiming his innocence. "Someone plotted to entrap me! From start to finish, I never destroyed public property! I didn't even enter Bairen Fortress—who smashed the bamboo at the Farm coffee-house gate? Seizing the Telecom Building was only a precaution; how can that be called intent to destroy public property? This is a trumped-up charge!"

That charge is indeed a bit of a stretch, Ma Jia thought. It would have been better to accuse him of "intent to disrupt public order."

As for "intent to inflict bodily harm on transmigrators," Dugu Qiuhun also refused to accept it.

"I have always treated comrades with the warmth of spring, reserving winter's cruelty only for enemies…" Before Dugu Qiuhun could finish, a chorus of jeers erupted. He pressed on regardless: "I would certainly never extend my claws toward my comrades."

A Senator immediately challenged him: why had he ordered the police to bring rifles into the city? As everyone knew, over ninety percent of the population inside Bairen Fortress were transmigrators. Whom were the rifles meant for?

Clearly, he had too many points he could not explain away, and the case file contained plenty of testimony against him—especially the indigenous policemen's depositions about the order to carry guns. Not just one person's testimony—several—an ironclad case.

The Senators were visibly angered. Someone had actually tried to bring armed indigenous personnel to suppress transmigrators! The thought that transmigrators might have scattered in panic—or even been shot dead—under indigenous truncheons and gunfire… the prestige so painstakingly built among the indigenous population would have been utterly ruined.

Under the barrage of questions, Dugu Qiuhun ran out of arguments and abandoned his defense, reiterating only that his loyalty to the transmigrated collective was "as clear as the sun and moon." At that point, someone rose to speak:

"The Dugu Qiuhun incident appears accidental but has deeper factors behind it." The speaker held forth eloquently. "I personally believe Dugu Qiuhun is a person without guile, comparatively loyal to the transmigrated collective. But sometimes simple-minded people easily transform loyalty to an organization into personal worship…"

Ma Jia frowned. The speaker was Hailin—a heavyset man in his thirties, now working in Wu Kuangming's Forestry Bureau, in charge of the wood-processing plant.

Hailin's remarks were clearly calculated. Dugu Qiuhun's greatest object of admiration was, of course, Ma Qianzhu. Ma Jia had been waiting for someone to fire this opening shot—and here it was. His gaze shifted to Ji Xin's face; the two exchanged a glance.

"…This affair amply demonstrates that the First Executive Committee made serious errors in personnel matters. I cannot help but wonder: how did Dugu Qiuhun—a man with no military background, no police background, not even hobbyist-level knowledge, lacking even the most basic concepts of respecting rules and obeying orders—climb to the post of East Gate Market Precinct Chief? Let alone concurrently hold as important a position as Bairen Fortress Outer-Perimeter Security Commander."

Every Senator present heard the gunpowder in Hailin's words. Xiao Zishan shifted uneasily.

"—Punishing Dugu Qiuhun severely has merit, but it treats the symptom without curing the disease. Dugu Qiuhun is just an ordinary transmigrator. Why did he end up where he is today? What exactly supported him in the notion that 'whatever I do is right'? Comrades, this deserves our deep reflection!"

His gaze turned toward Shan Liang, but Shan Liang pretended not to see and looked away.

Hailin's speech stirred a wave of whispers. Hailin stood there as if waiting for someone to respond—to rise and second him—but no one asked for the floor. Ma Jia asked, "Do you have anything else to say?"

Hailin had no choice but to continue: "To prevent a second Dugu Qiuhun within the transmigrated collective, a thorough investigation of this incident from the root is imperative. Only by digging out the source can we guarantee internal stability and unity. I have finished."

Hailin was somewhat disappointed. His rhetoric was all prompting; he had expected Shan Liang, that street politician, to leap up and demand an inquiry into the leadership responsible for Dugu Qiuhun's appointment—or, even better, to call for "rooting out the hidden hand behind Dugu Qiuhun." He had expected Shan Liang and several others who held strong views on the cadre-appointment system to respond. To his surprise, not one person stood up.

Several more people spoke—nothing but condemnations of Dugu Qiuhun's "lack of organization and discipline." No one mentioned anything about a "hidden hand." It was as if the Senators had all conspired to refuse to utter the words "leadership responsibility."

Strange, Hailin thought. When did Ma Qianzhu become so popular? Distracted, he opened the text materials distributed before the session. Unlike other Senators, who had read them carefully upon receipt, Hailin had not bothered—he had already studied much of the material and felt confident.

Flipping through casually, he noticed a new document he had not seen before: an "Independent Investigation Report on the Dugu Qiuhun Incident," authored by the Arbitration Tribunal. Hailin was startled—the Arbitration Tribunal had also produced an investigation report?!

He hurried to read through it and immediately understood why the Senators had shown no interest in his speech. The report merely listed, without a single word of conclusion, the entire process of Ji Xin's independent investigation: interview records, site records… But between the lines, the implication was crystal clear.

Everyone found Dugu Qiuhun's conduct reprehensible; but no one liked being used as someone else's gun.

---

As the hearing neared its end, Hailin requested the floor again:

"Dugu Qiuhun's behavior during the public demonstration shows that some people see only certain Executive Committee members, not the transmigrated collective as a whole." He stressed the phrase "certain Executive Committee members." "Power is corroding the body of the transmigrated collective. Today, a mere precinct chief dares to deploy indigenous forces to suppress transmigrator citizens. Tomorrow, once we have built army groups—vast land and naval forces—the military we ourselves created may take up arms as the swift blade of a handful of scheming careerists, cutting us down. To prevent this, Dugu Qiuhun absolutely must not be treated leniently. He must be severely, swiftly, and heavily punished. I propose that Dugu Qiuhun be immediately stripped of all positions, deprived of his Senatorial status, and ordered to undertake deep self-reflection until the Second Executive Committee approves his release. Furthermore, Dugu Qiuhun shall be permanently banned from holding any military, police, or other armed-forces post."

No one objected. Ma Jia then called for a vote.

The Senators' verdict: "unauthorized mobilization of armed forces without authorization"—guilty; "intent to inflict bodily harm on transmigrators"—guilty; "intent to destroy public property"—not guilty.

"Dugu Qiuhun is convicted on two counts!" Ma Jia struck his gavel. "Sentencing will be announced on a future date. Court is now adjourned!"

Dugu Qiuhun cried out, "I refuse to accept this! I am innocent!" He was then led away by Political Security officers. The Senators filed out of the screening room, conversing among themselves in twos and threes.

Ji Xin was packing his things, ready to leave. His task was complete; he had no interest in what final sentence Dugu Qiuhun would receive or what secrets lay behind the incident. Ma Jia called to him:

"Come back with me. We can talk on the way."

On the walk back to the Customs Building, Ma Jia raised the question of Dugu Qiuhun's sentencing. Because the incident involved too much, Ma Jia felt it best to consult the Executive Committee before passing sentence.

"We need to present a proposal for the Executive Committee's review," Ji Xin said.

"Nothing more than stripping him of all administrative posts," Ma Jia said. "As for revoking his Senatorial seat—that's going a bit far."

"Why not include it and then have 'grace descend from on high'?" Ji Xin joked.

"Ha ha—that's one way to do it," Ma Jia said. He thought: that would fully demonstrate Executive Committee unity. He knew very well that today's hearing had gone this smoothly because Ji Xin had carried out his directive of "don't let it blow up." His trust in Ji Xin rose considerably.

"In the future judicial system, what do you have in mind?" Ma Jia began sounding out his career intentions. He had made up his mind: this talent must be kept close—ideally, as a trusted adviser.

"I don't want a position in the judiciary," Ji Xin said without enthusiasm. "I want to go to the Education Bureau—specifically to educate indigenous children. If you'll support me, I'd also like to set up an Indigenous Rights Protection Association."

Ma Jia was taken aback. Choosing education was surprising enough, but an Indigenous Rights Protection Association was utterly outlandish. Transmigrators' attitudes toward the indigenous population varied widely: some viewed them as partners; others treated them purely as cannon fodder and labor. But no one had ever put indigenous rights on his lips.

"We have freedom of association now. If you want to establish it, I certainly won't object," Ma Jia said. "But I doubt many will join your protection association—"

"Whether anyone joins doesn't matter. I alone am enough. The main thing is to have an official name for external purposes," Ji Xin said. "In the future, legal disputes between indigenous people and transmigrators will only multiply. I want to help them defend their rights—to keep them from being bullied by transmigrators."

"That's admirable. It can promote social harmony." Ma Jia thought this could curb transmigrators' reckless exploitation of their status to oppress the indigenous population.

Ji Xin shook his head. "Whether society is harmonious or not isn't my concern—we have the power to make every indigenous person harmonious if we choose. I just think everyone is born of a mother. They are human beings too; they should have their basic rights."
