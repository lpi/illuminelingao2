# Chapter 340 - Worker Grade System

"Specific details are in the documents distributed to each ministry and commission office. Please submit your comments to the Ministry of Education's OA system after reviewing them."

"Setting schools aside for the moment—isn't it time to organize worker grading?" Zhan Wuya, representing the Industrial and Energy Committee, spoke up.

Wu De pressed his forehead. "I'd actually forgotten about that! You're right. The Ministry of Education is implementing diplomas; professional titles must be addressed as well."

The current wage distribution system used standards formulated uniformly by the Labor Affairs Office under the Civil Affairs Committee, then disbursed through Delong Bank. Only three or four wage grades existed; compensation was essentially identical regardless of job function. Under this structure, neither the difficulty of work nor individual merit could be reflected, and no meaningful income differentiation existed.

Zhan Wuya nodded. "Job-title rankings are essential for incentivizing workers to learn skills and advance. Moreover, we're about to overhaul wage scales. Without grades, the only option is seniority-based pay, which inevitably breeds resentment."

"Capable people receive no better treatment while everyone coasts on tenure—is that the situation?" Wu De understood the problem intimately.

"Exactly. The Industrial and Energy Committee now employs over a thousand workers. This matter must be put on the agenda." Zhan Wuya produced a rolled document from his bag. "This is a technical grade scheme for industrial workers that we've drafted internally."

Under the proposed system, an industrial worker would begin as an Apprentice. During the apprenticeship, no wages were paid—only a small stipend for pocket money. Upon completing the apprenticeship and passing a skills assessment, the worker became a Helper. Helpers were not regular employees; they received only a "Labor Allowance" equivalent to fifty percent of a regular worker's wage. After one full year as a Helper—contingent on passing another skills assessment and holding a Class C Diploma—a worker could be promoted to Level 1 Regular Worker.

Attaining regular status meant entering the formal wage system. Payment became a proper *salary*, not "pocket money" or "allowance," and treatment improved significantly. Thereafter, with diligent work and a defect rate below the standard threshold, advancement of one level per year was possible. Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4. Each promotion brought a corresponding wage increase. Beyond Level 4, further advancement required technical examinations.

A Level 4 Worker who passed the skills assessment and held a Class B Diploma could be promoted to Technician. Technician ranks ran from Level 1 to Level 4, but each level required examination. Exams were administered annually.

Above Level 4 Technician, a worker holding a Class A Diploma could sit for the Assistant Engineer assessment. For most technicians, Assistant Engineer represented the terminal rank. Only those who subsequently passed the Secondary School Diploma examination could attempt the Engineer assessment.

By Zhan Wuya's calculation, a naturally gifted indigenous worker—quick-handed and eager to learn—would require approximately ten years at minimum to reach Assistant Engineer. Engineer would depend entirely on individual learning capacity. Ordinary workers could probably advance only to Level 3 or 4 Technician.

Wu De reviewed the proposal. "Seems reasonable. Planning to submit it to the Executive Committee for discussion?"

"Not yet. I'm gathering informal feedback first. I value your input especially, since human resources fall under your leadership."

"Very well." Wu De considered. "I'm not an expert on worker grading systems. But tell me—are you planning a uniform structure, or different tracks by job type?"

Respect flickered across Zhan Wuya's face. "By job type, naturally."

A uniform system would be inequitable. If all workers were paid solely by grade regardless of occupation, those in high-skill or high-danger positions would be severely shortchanged. A Level 3 Packer and a Level 3 Lathe Operator were obviously not equivalent. Yet technical content alone couldn't be the only criterion. Stevedores on the docks performed low-skill work, but their labor was extraordinarily demanding—they required grain rations far exceeding those of lathe operators.

"Different job categories will have different base salary levels," Zhan Wuya confirmed. This was complex work. It would be unrealistic to expect Zhan Wuya or anyone else in the Transmigration Group to develop such a system from scratch. Fortunately, abundant historical precedent was available—the Grand Library contained numerous relevant materials and regulations, requiring only adaptation to current circumstances.

"Regardless of job category, the average income of an industrial worker should at minimum support a basic household of four."

A heavy-labor worker needed between 3,500 and 4,000 kilocalories daily. If intake consisted purely of carbohydrates, that meant at least twenty kilograms of grain per month. In Lingao Grain Circulation Coupons, the currency they had issued: 40 Yuan.

His wife—southern agricultural women worked no less than men, and Hainan women were famously capable of heavy, exhausting toil—would need at least fifteen kilograms of grain.

Assuming two dependents at twelve kilograms each per month: the total came to 40 + 30 + 48 = 118 Yuan in Lingao Grain Circulation Coupons.

At that level, of course, the family would barely survive. However, the transmigrators' labor policy mandated that women also work. Female wage income could cover other expenses: clothing, household necessities, occasional fish and meat. If children or elderly family members could also work, income would increase further. This would encourage more labor to enter the market, while preventing utter destitution. The transmigrators wanted their people able to afford at least *some* consumer goods.

"When I served on naval vessels," Wu De said, "crew members faced a problem upon promotion: professional rank ceilings. Each post had a maximum military rank. To advance higher, one had to change positions. Do you understand what I mean?"

"We've considered that as well. Depending on a job category's technical content, each has a different maximum promotion level." Zhan Wuya nodded. "Categories with very low technical content have no Technician ranks, let alone Engineer—unless the worker is willing to transfer to a different job category..." This design was intended to incentivize workers to acquire new skills.

"You're being somewhat idealistic here. When workers reach a certain age, marry, have children, and their burdens grow heavy, asking them to retrain and switch careers is no simple matter. Might this create a permanent underclass of low-skill workers trapped in low-income brackets?"

"That's unavoidable." Zhan Wuya reflected. "We're not here to practice egalitarianism or build a socialist welfare family. Differentiating income by ability level is necessary."

"True. But we must calibrate carefully. Don't unconsciously slide into a welfare-state mentality." Wu De's tone was measured. "Compensation cannot be too low—that damages employees' health and the next generation of laborers, and depresses productivity. But it cannot be too high, either. 'It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but hard to go from extravagance to frugality.'"

The transmigrators could not spin straw into gold. Advanced technology did not automatically translate into wealth. The primitive accumulation of this new nation would require external plunder and internal exploitation just like any other.

A chill ran down Zhan Wuya's spine. "Honestly, it feels strange."

"Strange to speak so nakedly? Heh." Wu De laughed. "That only proves our petty-bourgeois sentiments remain too strong." He paused. "However, low-income families must also be looked after. Provide more basic welfare. Sometimes small gestures are more effective than wage increases."

"Such as...?" Zhan Wuya couldn't immediately think what benefits, beyond money and goods distribution, could be offered to workers. Wu De's expression suggested he had something specific in mind. Well, this was Wu De's domain; Zhan Wuya would simply follow instructions.

Wu De's labor welfare plan was outlined in a Sacred Ship brand notebook in his pocket. Alongside it was a more detailed labor system proposal. The notebook bulged with key points and ideas. Whenever he had free time, he took it out to ponder. Though objective conditions didn't yet permit implementation, the blueprint was gradually taking shape. Once the moment was right, he would submit it to the Executive Committee.

"Hippo! That bastard! Went to do a hygiene inspection and never came back! Does he know what I'm doing? And He Ping—came back from the voyage, got a few rest days, and simply vanished!" Shi Niaoren hadn't seen either of them for several nights of "professional study"—their euphemism for AV viewing sessions.

"If they won't watch, fine. Let them regret missing Little Sora's 'uncensored' edition!" He consoled himself while sorting through a chaotic assortment of samples.

"The variety in the AV world is truly remarkable. Little Sora's technique is exceptional!" Shi Niaoren reminisced about the previous night's "professional study" while his hands continued cataloguing the specimens.

"This is the thirtieth sample. The last one." He performed the microscopy with weary resignation. "This sample absolutely reeks." His gaze flicked to a nearby petri dish containing the culture specimen from the immigrant who had died that morning. Shortly, he would need to check carefully for *Vibrio* bacteria. The thought made him verify his mask was properly positioned.

The sudden-death victim remained in the underground morgue—temperatures were slightly cooler there, but the body couldn't be preserved for long. Shi Niaoren had to confirm quickly whether death had resulted from epidemic disease. If not, there would be time to organize an autopsy tonight. If so, immediate cremation was necessary. Corpse disposal was—once again—the Health Department's burden. He sighed. He had already quarreled repeatedly with Executive Committee higher-ups about body disposal. They seemed to think the sea was a natural dumping ground and suggested he simply transport corpses to Bopu for ocean disposal. He had pointed out repeatedly that the Health Department required a dedicated incinerator to burn medical waste and bodies of suspected infectious cases. Currently, dragging them to open ground for burning polluted the environment and failed to achieve complete incineration. It was practically a recipe for creating pathogen transmission sources.
