# Chapter 413 Lin Baiguang's Crisis

"But Big Boss—"

"I know. If I don't stop him, others might follow his example." Zhu Cailao's expression was grave. He thought for a long while before seeming to make up his mind: "Manager Wang, tell the granary immediately to distribute the stored grain to every branch and every ship. Issue all the grain in the granary and have the whole army cook! Prepare for battle."

"Ah?!" The leaders looked at him. Only Wang You, the General Manager of the Old Camp, was not surprised. Although they had obtained a batch of grain in the last ten days or so, and some people had run away, the grain supply had only barely held out. It was a drop in the bucket; the whole army would run out of grain in just these few days.

"Big Boss! We are short twelve large ships now! Should we wait for the ships that went to Lingao to return before discussing..."

"Waiting for He Xin to return would be too late. God knows what happened to them." Since the fleet took the outer ocean route, once it was delayed, various factors were possible. Continuing to sit and wait would not solve any problems and would instead lead to a desperate situation of complete grain exhaustion. Wang You clearly pointed out how bad the current situation was.

"We can't avoid fighting; the grain is about to bottom out," Zhu Cailao said coldly. "We're going to attack Min'an right now!"

"Missing a dozen large sea-going ships isn't a big deal. Small ships can fight just the same. For attacking such a land-based place, small ships are even more agile."

"Big Boss! What about that Australian envoy? Is that kid fooling us?"

"Envoy?" Zhu Cailao waved his hand impatiently. "Keep him on Nanri—he can't run without a ship. I don't have time to deal with him now!" He shouted, "Tell the brothers to eat a full meal and set sail tomorrow morning. After conquering Min'an, swords will not be sheathed for three days! Wealth and women go to the brothers first!"

"Thank you, Big Boss!" the leaders responded with a roar.

He Xin's fleet had a smooth journey all the way. Taking the outer ocean route, they arrived at Bopu Port in just six days. He Xin actually knew nothing about navigation; he had attained his position through nepotism. Therefore, Ren Fu, the general manager of the flagship, was the *de facto* commander.

He Xin was led to meet Wen Desi. Wen Desi said a few polite words, complimented He Xin as "young and promising, full of heroic spirit," and gave him a valuable gift, making He Xin dizzy with delight. After eating and drinking gluttonously in the commercial hall, he was led to a luxurious suite to stay. In the room, two prostitutes with outstanding looks selected by Dongmen Chuiyu were already waiting.

Ren Fu and the sailors also had special personnel to receive them. First, they bathed, then each was given a set of clothes and treated to good food and drink. The sailors had long since had their mouths fade out of flavor on Nanri Island. Upon arriving in Lingao, there were fresh vegetables, chickens, and ducks. As for wine and rice, they were supplied openly. Everyone felt that coming to Lingao this time was "hitting the jackpot." Wei Aiwen went into battle personally, leading the cadets from the Military and Political School who were interning in the General Political Department. Ostensibly they were doing "reception," but in reality, they were conducting face-to-face propaganda work. They vigorously publicized how the Crossing Group treated the poor well, and how everyone had "clothes to wear," "food to eat," "houses to live in," "could marry wives," and "were not bullied"—things related to the vital interests of ordinary people. To fully demonstrate the superiority, they also organized them to visit the residences, factories, farms, and schools of the Bairen and Bopu communes, plus the East Gate Market.

In order to give them a full understanding of the superiority of the Crossing Group's new society, this group was also taken to the Lingao county seat to give them a stark contrast.

He Xin was accompanied daily by special personnel from the Foreign Business Committee and toured the East Gate Market. Whatever he took a slight fancy to, the escort bought immediately. If he fancied any woman hanging a yellow ticket, she was guaranteed to be sent to the commercial hall at night. This made He Xin, who had only mixed his way up in the pirate gang through nepotism, so happy he didn't know north from south. Eating, drinking, and enjoying were secondary; he had always been looked down upon in the pirate group, but this time someone attached such importance to him and looked up to him, giving him great psychological satisfaction. As for buying rice with the loan, he simply threw it to the back of his mind—not that he forgot, but since buying rice meant returning, delaying the purchase for a few days meant he could enjoy this gentle land for a few more days.

In fact, even if he were a person with a strong sense of responsibility, he wouldn't have been able to leave. As soon as the ships entered the port, the Navy sent people to move the ships and seal the fleet's exit route. The Marines were also on standby to take over the ships at any time—similar drills had been done countless times in their boarding training.

"I really don't understand the people from the Political Security Bureau. Why go to all that trouble: entertaining them with meals, and treating them to whoring at public expense? Just arrest them all and take over the ships," Old Di complained. He was the company commander of the Marines responsible for monitoring the ships.

The General Administration of Political Security's explanation was: this is to ensure the safety of enemy-work personnel.

No one could guarantee that there were no spies of Zhu Cailao or other forces in Lingao. If they detained the ships and arrested the people directly, and the other side sent news out overnight, it would reach Nanri Island in at most a week. The Crossing Group's face of "fake negotiation, real poaching" would be completely exposed, and Lin Baiguang would die without a burial place.

Now, dragging He Xin down with fine wine and women, if things were done slowly, it wouldn't be the Crossing Group's problem.

After eating, drinking, and playing for several days like this, Ren Fu was, after all, an old bandit of many years. Thinking that they came this time to buy grain and gunpowder, if they delayed any longer, it would be terrible if they botched the big matter. He Xin was a relative of the imperial family and naturally could get away with it when the time came, but the responsibility would fall on him. He immediately went to persuade He Xin: the tens of thousands of brothers in the fleet, and the Big Boss, were waiting for grain. It was important to finish the business and go back as soon as possible.

Only then did He Xin come back to his senses. Thinking of what the Big Boss had said to him when he left, he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat and hurriedly asked to see Wen Desi.

Unexpectedly, Wen Desi was gone. Every time he asked someone to arrange buying grain, the Australians always made excuses—either the manager had no time, or there weren't enough porters. Only then did He Xin feel something was wrong. Moreover, because he lived alone in the commercial hall, there was no one around to discuss things with. Ren Fu never showed up again after coming once.

He Xin had no choice and made up his mind to go back to Bopu first. As a result, just as he stepped out of the room, the clerk outside greeted him:

"Where is Master He going? The little ones can send someone to serve you."

"Nothing, I'm going to the East Gate Market to buy cigarettes." He Xin wasn't completely a straw bag; he immediately thought of an excuse.

"The cigarettes will be sent over in a while; no need to trouble Master He's honorable steps."

"Bullshit, I want to buy them myself," He Xin raged.

"Master He had better go back to the room first, lest the little ones can't bear the responsibility..." The clerk smiled apologetically but didn't give an inch.

"Bastard, what do you mean? Am I a prisoner?!"

"Not at all, Master He is a distinguished guest of the Chiefs. You'd better go inside first. We'll send the cigarettes immediately. If you feel bored, just say the word, and we'll have someone come and show Japanese shadow plays."

As they spoke, three or four clerks surrounded him, bowing and scraping, each wearing a smile that made one shudder. He Xin couldn't help but take a few steps back, knowing in his heart that the Big Boss had fallen for the trap of this gang of Kun!

Returning to the room helplessly, He Xin thought despairingly that this luxuriously furnished and comfortable room was nothing but a gilded cage. Ren Fu and the brothers under him had mostly likely already fallen victim to their vicious hands! As for himself, he didn't know how long they would let him live. Thinking of this, his mood instantly fell into a bottomless abyss. He actually lay on the bed and began to cry bitterly.

"What pirate leader? Turns out he's just a little sissy!" Wu Fo spat in the monitoring room next door to express his contempt.

"He rose through nepotism; he's not an authentic pirate leader," someone beside him said.

"Have the Swallows arrived?"

"They're here, waiting downstairs."

Wu Fo went down the hidden stairs. In a secret room of the commercial hall, two prostitutes were waiting for him.

These were carefully selected by the Intelligence Committee from the registered prostitutes. Not only were they required to have good looks and exquisite figures, but they also had to be bold and careful, and good at dealing with situations. They received a small allowance every month on the condition that they must await the orders of the intelligence department at any time.

"Listen," Wu Fo said to the prostitutes in the room. "From today on, you are to follow this Master He all day long, whether he eats, sleeps, or goes to the toilet. Whatever he says or does, report to me at any time."

"The maidservants understand."

"After the matter is done, there will naturally be benefits for you. Now go and serve him well."

Wu Fo finished assigning the task and hurriedly rode his bicycle straight to Bopu.

The situation in Bopu was already under control. Ren Fu and his sailors had been secured.

"Make Ren Fu appear in public regularly; act as if he hasn't disappeared, understand?" Wu Fo instructed the staff. "Arrangements must be made every day for him to go on board to take a look and say a few words. Let the ordinary sailors continue to live on the ships; their movements will be monitored by people from the Political Department."

"What if they want to seize the ships?"

"That's why Ren Fu must be controlled separately. He is not allowed on board at night to prevent him from passing news to the sailors. You must keep in contact with Minister Wei at all times."

As for He Xin, besides sending two prostitutes to serve him personally, many activities awaited him every day. He Xin spent his days either eating and drinking in restaurants or wandering the streets with prostitutes. How could he have such interest? But Wu Fo unceremoniously threatened him with something more terrifying than death: saying that if he dared to show the slightest reluctance outside, he would sell this pretty boy to a Westerner's *xianggong* house to be a "boy." Then he showed him gay S&M movies for a whole night. Anyone who dared not to cooperate would end up like that in the foreigner's *xianggong* house. The scenes in the movie that night almost made He Xin faint; for several days he felt his anus was in danger.

To protect his anus, He Xin had to perform perfunctorily every day, trying his best to act out his debauchery. After a few days of fine wine and women, what little sense of responsibility he originally had was gradually worn away. Thinking that his days were likely numbered, he simply abandoned himself to even greater dissipation. This made the people of the Intelligence Committee feel very gratified; everyone concluded that this method might be promotable in the future.

As for the ordinary sailors, they didn't feel anything improper about the happy days of good food, good drink, and women to sleep with in Lingao; it would be best if such days never ended. Even if they went back in a hurry, the credit would belong to He Xin and Ren Fu, and they would still have to risk their lives fighting battles.

Although everyone found it strange why the grain and gunpowder hadn't been loaded yet, they had always believed that "the leaders decide the big matters," so the sailors didn't care.

The Intelligence Committee stepped up its collection of intelligence on Zhu Cailao's maritime movements. Lin Baiguang did not carry any communication tools to contact Lingao. To know the development of the situation, the intelligence department had to rely on itself to collect information. The Guangzhou Station began to concentrate its energy on collecting news about Zhu Cailao, Nanri Island, and Min'an.

Zhang Xin sent Zhang Dabala to Fujian to inquire about news: he had been a pirate and knew a lot about the situation inside, so it was easy for him to get news.

"Zhu Cailao is going to Min'an. You find a place to hide near Min'an. As soon as Zhu Cailao retreats in defeat, send a pigeon back!"

Zhang Dabala was puzzled. Zhu Cailao had been stationed at Nanri recently; everyone knew this. But how was it apparent that he was going to attack Min'an? And how did they know he was bound to lose?

"Yes, but this Big Boss Zhu's combat power is not weak. If he conquers Min'an, what should I do?"

"He can't conquer it; he is bound to lose," Zhang Xin said with full confidence. "How about you bet your monthly silver for this month and this business trip's expenses with me? I'll give you five to one odds."

"Forget it, you guys have magic arts. I won't bet." Zhang Dabala muttered to himself and crossed himself. "God bless! Evil spirits disperse!"

Zhang Xin laughed secretly: *his being a believer is really creative.*

Zhu Cailao's fleet finally launched an attack on Min'an in August of that year. The attack lasted for four days. The offensive on the first day went very smoothly. His fleet of sampans and small boats entered the Min River under the cover of the large ships' artillery fire, routing the intercepting Ming troops and local militia along the way, driving straight for Min'an Town.

Min'an is ten kilometers from Luoxing Pagoda and more than thirty kilometers from Fuzhou. From Hou'an below Luoxing Pagoda to Tingtou, mountains stretch continuously on both banks, and the river flows tortuously. The gorge at Min'an Town has the most perilous terrain; the river channel is deep and narrow, only 600 meters at its narrowest point. It is the choke point guarding the mouth of the Min River. The Ming army set up temporary artillery emplacements along both banks of the river here, deploying dozens of cannons to intercept the fleets going upstream. Local militia conscripted from various places along the river guarded both banks. Every time the pirates tried to land and advance, they would be intercepted and killed by the militia. But encouraged by the promise of three days of unbridled looting, the pirates did not flinch and attacked fiercely all the way, disregarding casualties.

Min'an is the gateway to Fuzhou and the main sea exit for Fujian. Once it fell, not only would the tens of thousands of merchants and civilians and countless wealth in Min'an turn to ashes, but Fujian's sea exit would also be closed. For a time, Fuzhou was shaken. Merchants and civilians in Min'an fled one after another, and the situation was in chaos.

However, Zheng Zhilong had already arrived with his army and subsequently engaged Zhu Cailao's main force outside the mouth of the Min River. At this time, Zheng Zhilong was equipped with dozens of large ships carrying heavy cannons sponsored by Xiong Wencan, forming an advantage in both quantity and quality. The two sides engaged repeatedly at the mouth of the Min River, and Zhu Cailao suffered repeated defeats. Morale was greatly shaken. By the evening of the second day, with some ships fleeing the battlefield, Zhu Cailao's fleet finally collapsed completely. Seeing that the situation was irretrievable, Zhu Cailao immediately gathered the remnants of his army and retreated towards Nanri Island, preparing to gather the remnants there and regroup.

Zheng Zhilong did not intend to let him go just like that and immediately launched a pursuit. Under Zheng Zhilong's pursuit, Zhu Cailao's forces collapsed all the way. Ships were either lost or captured. Less than one in ten ships retreated to Nanri Island. Anyone could see clearly that Zhu Cailao's destruction was only a matter of time.

Fleeing all the way from Min'an, groups large and small constantly left the fleet in the chaos, either to find a way to live elsewhere or simply to surrender to the victor, Zheng Zhilong. This was not rare among maritime groups. This kind of alliance could expand rapidly when the wind was smooth, but once they suffered a defeat and the situation was bad, they would immediately fall apart.

In such a situation, Zhu Cailao led the remaining more than one hundred ships and retreated to the sea surface off Nanri Island.

These ships were smoking; some masts were broken, and some sails still had arrows stuck in them or traces of being pierced by lead and stone projectiles. The hulls were scarred, riddled with holes and bloodstains everywhere. These ships appeared so tense and panicked that they had completely lost their normal formation, caring only about scrambling to escape for their lives.

As for the pirates on the ships, after days of bitter fighting, they were frightened by the collapse like a landslide. Most people let themselves be tossed by the waves, silent as cicadas in winter. Panic-stricken eyes searched the distant ocean surface from time to time.

The news of the defeat had reached Nanri Island one step earlier than them—it turned out that since the morning of the day of the battle, ships that had left the main force had been fleeing back to Nanri Island continuously. By the time the whole army began to retreat from Min'an, sharp-eyed and quick-handed leaders had already rushed back to Nanri to transfer their families and property. Some simply began to let their soldiers loot the granary and the Old Camp. The Old Camp was only barely preserved by the desperate resistance of Zhu Cailao's personal guards.

More and more ships began to weigh anchor and flee. Those clansmen and same-surname "branches" of Zhu Cailao still held the idea that perhaps they could pick up the pieces and stage a comeback, organizing their men and horses in the chaos to wait for the main army to return.

Lin Baiguang was still trapped in the Old Camp at this time. He had originally thought to escape during the chaos when someone besieged the Old Camp, but unexpectedly, the sound of gunfire and killing outside lasted for a while and then gradually died down. Upon inquiring, he was told that the Old Camp and the granary had been held.

Now he became an ant on a hot pan. From the personal guards he was familiar with, Lin Baiguang knew that many people had already run away with their ships. He couldn't help being burned with anxiety—those running now were non-direct line troops. The more that left, the more the remainders would be die-hard loyalists. How could he move them? Moreover, the few small leaders he had socialized with these days had no news at all. He didn't know if they had gone to Min'an with Zhu Cailao and lost the battle, or stayed on Nanri. He knew nothing about whether they were dead or alive, ran away, or were still on the island.

Lin Baiguang knew that the longer he stayed in the Old Camp, the more unfavorable the situation would be. Once those leaders ran away or died in battle, his attempt to control the fleet would fail completely. And once Zhu Cailao returned, Nanri Island would become a Shura field for the final decisive battle with Zheng Zhilong, and nine out of ten chances, he would die in the chaotic army!
