# Chapter 306: Sweet Port Turbulence — Dying Struggles

"Richangji, seven thousand *shi*," Feng Guangfeng followed up immediately. "I'll deliver the silver shortly."

With two firms now committed, the others who had been observing likewise pledged their quantities—some three thousand, some five thousand, some ten thousand. The total exceeded one hundred fifty thousand *shi*. Chen Tianxiong knew that most were holding back; these figures were merely stones cast to test the waters.

However, had they been overly enthusiastic, South China Sugar would have been forced to disgorge some of the sugar already collected to distribute among them, which would have meant losses. This way, everyone was satisfied.

"With this Sugar Industry Guild established, what becomes of the Haiyi Guild?" someone posed the sharp question. If Master Zhu forbade them from joining and insisted on maintaining the Haiyi Guild, how would they handle him?

The representatives shifted uneasily in their seats, exchanging whispers.

Everyone understood that Master Zhu wouldn't surrender easily; a vicious fight was inevitable. He possessed money and the ability to direct various dark forces. He was not to be underestimated.

To this, Chang Shide replied that South China Sugar would handle the matter properly. Specific negotiations would be conducted by the factory. If Master Zhu sought trouble with anyone, South China Sugar would stand behind them, never breaking its word.

"I believe everyone is aware: South China Sugar possesses the capability to support its promises."

Chang Shide spoke decisively. The attendees, though somewhat uneasy, accepted the assurance.

"The meeting was a success," Wen Tong remarked to Chang Shide afterward. "But why not form a joint-stock company directly? Why commence with proxy purchasing and sales?"

"Let them taste the sweetness first," Chang Shide explained. "At the outset, they don't trust us sufficiently. Once this year's business concludes and they recognize the benefits of following us over that worthless Haiyi Guild, discussing a joint-stock company will become feasible."

"The next step is consolidating our gains, especially guarding against Zhu An's counterattack," Chen Tianxiong reminded them. "Master Zhu remains on Hai'an Street. A centipede dies but never falls. His dormancy might be merely waiting for an opportunity to strike. We need a response plan immediately."

"Ideally, we neutralize him swiftly, lest long nights breed many dreams." Chang Shide warned: whether the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild could ultimately be established depended on South China Sugar's ability to eliminate Master Zhu's power rapidly.

"We could simply dispatch him, but that might make these sugar merchants feel 'the fox mourns the death of the rabbit.'" Chang Shide propped his chin on his hand. "We hesitate to throw at the rat for fear of shattering the vase."

"Set that aside for now. Make Feng Guangfeng the liaison. Inform them all funds must be remitted within three days, or the contracts are void," Chen Tianxiong said. "This money serves as their pledge of allegiance, preventing wavering."

"Right. I'll have Liao Daxing handle it, and instruct Liao Diahua to prepare men and carts to collect silver on Hai'an Street."

This was no small sum. Chen Tianxiong calculated after the meeting and was astonished—these merchants would hand over 375,000 taels of silver! Nearly 15 metric tons!

"Truly substantial!" Chen Tianxiong felt the importance of a bank even more keenly. Leaving aside paper currency, if remittance services existed, a single draft would resolve everything. As matters stood, moving and storing 15 tons of silver presented a considerable headache.

Since commencing sugar acquisitions, South China Sugar had expended massive time and energy on storing, guarding, and dispensing silver. All silver shipped in was "Official Treasure" re-smelted in Guangzhou furnaces—uniform purity, fifty taels per ingot. This simplified packing, transport, and counting.

But in actual practice, it became complex. Sugar payments were fractional; one couldn't employ fifty-tael ingots for everything. The factory had been obliged to purchase silver shears and scales. Whole ingots were clipped into fragments. The process was tedious and incurred substantial wastage.

As for the silver arriving from the sugar firms, it would undoubtedly consist of broken bits of varying purity. Liao Daxing had already warned them to engage assayers promptly; mistaking debased silver for pure "snowflake" silver would mean enormous losses.

"The Executive Committee has established a bank in Guangzhou," Wen Tong circulated a recent internal bulletin. "I think we can request a local branch here."

"Call it South China Sugar Bank!" Chang Shide was struck by sudden inspiration. "We'll soon have nearly 400,000 in cash—isn't that a reserve?"

"The name is inappropriate," Chen Tianxiong objected. "Financial systems must adhere to the Executive Committee's unified framework; we shouldn't establish our own parallel structure. Besides, we aren't finance professionals. Best to let experts handle it."

Chang Shide, sharp as ever, understood immediately. "Right, right. Let's telegram the Executive Committee to open a branch." He added, "Leizhou's sugar industry genuinely requires banking services."

"Yes," Wen Tong agreed. "After controlling sales, the next step is assisting farmers to increase production."

Increasing production required promoting new planting techniques and sugar cooperatives. Gaining farmers' trust wouldn't be easy, but they had built a sound reputation during this acquisition war. With a bank, they could employ financial instruments to issue low-interest loans supporting production.

While they discussed, Zhou Shizhai requested an audience.

"Someone intends harm to South China Sugar," he stated without preamble.

They exchanged glances. What they had anticipated had arrived—Master Zhu was indeed bent on destruction. Desperate like a cornered dog, he might resort to despicable methods.

"What's the situation?"

"Liao Diahua's men have learned that Zhao Jijiao's people are purchasing oil and dry firewood—they're a gang of punks who don't cook. What would they need that for? Probably arson. They've been spending lavishly lately, gambling and whoring, clearly recipients of a substantial payout."

Zhou Shizhai mopped sweat from his brow. "Additionally, rumors are circulating in the Leizhou underworld that South China Sugar holds hundreds of thousands in silver but maintains weak defenses. Kidnapping a few managers could extort an enormous sum."

"Vicious. Using unseen silver to entice others to do their dirty work," Chen Tianxiong commented.

"Don't joke. Being kidnapped would be humiliating." Wen Tong's expression was grim.

"If Li Siya kidnapped you, you'd probably enjoy it. Incidentally, she's your clansman."

"Stop jesting," Wen Tong said anxiously. "Li Siya or Li Sisu—what if we actually get kidnapped?"

"Kidnapping isn't our greatest concern," Zhou Shizhai observed. "Scattered bandits can accomplish little, and the managers carry weapons. The genuine worry is bandits banding together to raid—that must be guarded against."

"Banding together?" Chang Shide inquired. "How so?"

Zhou Shizhai explained that while no large bandit armies operated in Leizhou, small groups of four or five abounded, robbing lone travelers. Some bands numbering under a hundred raided farming villages. To assault a firm like South China Sugar, they would require four or five hundred men. Bandits valued numbers; even if they lacked genuine fighters, they would drag along farmers to pad their ranks and cow civilians.

"Hai'an Street is wealthier than us. Why don't they rob them?" Wen Tong found it peculiar.

"Fear of death," Zhou Shizhai answered simply. Hai'an Street maintained hundreds of local militia paid by the shops. Well-fed and well-compensated, they fought competently. Bandits needed strong teeth to bite that bone.

"We are newcomers. Bandits don't know our strength. If incited to believe there's a fortune here, they might assemble a substantial force. We must guard against it." Zhou Shizhai now fully considered himself part of the Transmigration Group.

"What about our militia? Can they hold?"

"Yes," Zhou Shizhai confirmed. "With Comrade Bei training them, they should hold for some time."

The transmigrators were less confident. They understood the militia's limitations: workers were occupied with factory tasks, leaving scant time for training. Beiwei's arrival had only marginally improved matters.

"Don't worry excessively. This is the county seat's doorstep. Bandits won't dare linger—hit and run. As long as we deny them initial success."

"True, but we must protect ourselves," Chen Tianxiong agreed. "Until this is resolved, don't venture out casually. Strengthen gate guards. Keep militia on standby. Even when Liao Da, Liao Er, or the Wen brothers go out, assign armed escorts."

"Beware of arson as well," Chang Shide added. "The factory is reasonably secure; construction makes arson difficult, and fires won't spread. But the workers' village housing the displaced—straw sheds. One spark and it's catastrophe. Deaths would be terrible."

"Old Wen, arrange for Liao Daxing to inspect it. Give them a warning!"

"Also—" Chen Tianxiong recalled something. "Telegram Guangzhou and Lingao. The sea situation may not remain tranquil. We eliminated one Gu Dachun, but Wang Dachun or Li Dachun might covet this prize."

"Mm. And the Gu pirates aren't entirely exterminated. Their main force is destroyed, but they still possess silver and men. They might return seeking revenge."

Lingao had transmitted a summary of enemy intelligence based on interrogations from the Chrysanthemum Islets battle. The Gu gang still retained approximately twenty or thirty men and a single-masted boat for liaison purposes.

"Since we have prisoners, why didn't the Navy simply eliminate them at their base?" Wen Tong asked.

"Too difficult," Chen Tianxiong explained. The pirate nest wasn't a water fortress on an island but ordinary fishing villages along the coast, intermixed with regular fishermen. Distinguishing friend from foe was problematic.

"Well, I believe they will come." Chen Tianxiong leaned back in his chair. "Xiao Zhanfeng mentioned that Master Zhu keeps a concubine who is Gu Dachun's sister."

The atmosphere grew tense. In the following days, patrolling militia extinguished several fires ignited by thrown incendiaries. Thanks to fire prevention measures, only walls were blackened. Intelligence from Liao Diahua confirmed the arsonists were Zhao Jijiao's gang—punks with no grudge against South China Sugar, clearly hired by Master Zhu.

Arson attacks became frequent, occurring once or twice nearly every night. Finding the factory and merchant house difficult to burn, targets shifted to the workers' living quarters.

The most perilous incident occurred in the workers' village. A straw shed was ignited at night. The factory watchtower sounded the alarm; the fire brigade extinguished it within ten minutes.

The arsonist was apprehended on the spot by workers. Recognized as one of Zhao Jijiao's punks, realizing there was no escape, he slammed his head against a rock, then lay howling on the ground, covered in blood. The enraged workers fell silent.

"What is he howling about?" Chang Shide inquired.

"Essentially that we're bullying him, beating him without cause. If we don't compensate for his injuries, he'll die at our gate," Liao Daxing replied with a bitter smile. "These punks fear nothing. If provoked, they might actually hang themselves at your door, generating a lawsuit that ruins you."

"Oh?" Chang Shide recognized the type—a "hobnailed rascal." Sending them to the *yamen* meant release soon after. Even with money expended, at most a beating and pillory—which they didn't fear. Punks often colluded with *yamen* runners. Even if officials wished to act, subordinates would obstruct them, reducing major matters to minor ones. Punishment was elusive.

While pondering what to do, Ma Sanqiang pushed through the crowd and shouted: "Boss, this man burned our house and injured a child inside! I ask the Boss one question: will you handle this?!"

Chang Shide grasped the situation instantly. A punk's life versus the hearts of a host of sugar workers—the choice was obvious.

"Of course I'll handle it!" Chang Shide declared decisively, waving his hand. "Attend to this 'gentleman' properly. Make it clean!"

Several special forces soldiers brought by Beiwei stood among the crowd. Hearing this, they moved instantly. One stepped on the man; another seized a handful of mud and straw, stuffing it into his mouth. The screaming thug gagged and went limp from asphyxiation. The two soldiers wrapped him in a straw mat and carried him away in silence.
