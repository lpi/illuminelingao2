# Chapter 449 - Abuses

"However, the Capital Warehouse Official Rice doesn't all need to be shipped to the capital," Wang Zhaomin explained. Originally, during the Hongwu reign, autumn grain really had to be transported thousands of *li* to the capital. The "Grain Chiefs" within the *Lijia* system bore responsibility for grain transport, and the manpower and material resources consumed were staggering. Grain Chiefs often went bankrupt from this burden.

Later, considering local needs and the desire to reduce losses from round-trip transport, regulations were modified. Part of the money and grain was shipped to the capital, part was directly transferred to wherever money and grain were needed within the prefecture, and part was kept in Qiongzhou Prefecture granaries as reserves—entered only into the Board of Revenue's accounts.

"That is indeed much more convenient," Wu De nodded. If shipping only to Qiongzhou Prefecture, whether by land or sea, the distance was quite short. Even at Ming dynasty capability levels, it shouldn't prove too difficult.

"If only it were that easy!" Wang Zhaomin shook his head. Having served as a private secretary for over a decade, he had never seen grain collection and payment in any county be a simple matter. He couldn't help but deliberately show off to demonstrate his expertise—somehow, Wang Zhaomin now found the Australians' opinion of him increasingly important.

"Just within the quota of Capital Warehouse Official Rice to be shipped to Qiongzhou, one thousand five hundred seventy-nine *shi*, one *sheng*, nine *he* is transferred to Changhua as provisions. Another two thousand one hundred eighty-one *shi*, nine *dou*, two *sheng*, five *he* is turned over for Prefecture official and troop provisions. So the county must transport grain to five different places: Qiongzhou Prefecture, Changhua County, Danzhou, Wanzhou, and Lingshui County. The expenses for shipping and acceptance tallying are uncountable." Wang Zhaomin assumed an expression of concern for the country and people. "The disturbance to the populace is extreme!"

*Still have to go to Changhua?* Wu De thought. *That's actually along the way. Since establishing round-island sailing and constructing Changhua Fort and Yulin Fort, we've opened regular round-island shipping routes. Transporting grain to Changhua will be effortless.*

"Why must grain also go to places like Danzhou and Wanzhou?"

"Because these places all have Prefecture Granaries."

The official granaries of Qiongzhou Prefecture weren't all located in the prefecture city. During the Ming dynasty, Qiongzhou Prefecture maintained five granaries, four of which were established in outer counties—such as the Guangji Granary in Wanzhou and the Nanfeng Granary in Lingshui.

The dispersed grain storage locations were mostly in critical strategic areas, especially locations vulnerable to "Li unrest"—facilitating nearby grain access for punitive expeditions should conflict arise.

The brown rice payable by each county had to be transported to these granaries for tallying. Wang Zhaomin explained: Lingao had to hand over one thousand *shi* to Danzhou, one thousand two hundred *shi* to Wanzhou, and nine hundred *shi* to Lingshui. The provisions transported to Changhua for the Changhua Thousand Household Post amounted to one thousand five hundred *shi*. Only the remainder was transported to Qiongzhou Prefecture city.

"Transporting grain thousands of *li* is secondary; there are also various tricks during acceptance tallying at the granaries." Wang Zhaomin continued. Whether it was a military granary or a prefecture granary, the managing officials were all "unranked" petty officials. But forget about such unranked petty officials—even the tallymen and head granary laborers, if not properly greased, would cause endless trouble during grain acceptance. Either they'd find fault with rice quality or insist the weight was insufficient. If the acceptance period passed, a penalty for missing the deadline was unavoidable.

"So that's how it works!" Wu De nodded. It seemed the Crossing Group's undertaking of county taxes was still going to be a challenging affair. Just grain transport and acceptance concealed such tricks; the schemes in other stages could only be imagined.

Thirteen hundred *shi* was retained in the county for officials' salaries and daily administrative expenses. From this, provisions for county garrison troops—five hundred seventy-two *shi* and two *he*—and provisions for the Bopu Port Inspection Station—seventeen *shi*, eight *dou*, six *sheng*—had to be deducted. In reality, even for a small county like Lingao, this modest amount of grain kept in the county was completely insufficient for expenses. Beyond maintaining basic administrative operations, the county essentially couldn't accomplish anything it wished.

Wu De thought: *Undertaking grain tax seems to require a batch of natives familiar with local conditions to assist. This Wang Zhaomin needs to become a key target for recruitment.*

Thinking thus, he nodded: "Thank you, Private Secretary Wang, for your instruction."

"Not at all, not at all." After demonstrating his expertise and seeing this Australian big boss listening with rapt attention and a grave expression, Wang Zhaomin's spirits immediately lifted. "Just some superficial observations."

"Regarding this grain collection matter, we still need Private Secretary Wang to provide more guidance," Wu De said. Seeing that the hour had grown late and there remained much to discuss, he ordered supper to be prepared.

Originally, Wu De intended to win over Wang Zhaomin, so this supper wasn't prepared by Zhang Youfu's maidservants. The stove, utensils, seasonings, and ingredients all came from the Women's Cooperative Restaurant in East Gate Market. The two cooks were originally refugees from Guangdong with excellent skills; after the Crossing Group's training, their abilities had improved further. Hearing that a big boss was entertaining an honored guest, they summoned every ounce of their expertise to prepare delicious dishes.

The fare wasn't rare in the modern timeline—just Cantonese morning tea dim sum. Lingao didn't lack seafood locally, and the Tianchu Sauce Garden supplied various modern condiments, so the dim sum produced differed little from its modern counterparts. But in this timeline, such items became extraordinarily rare "delicacies."

Due to the lack of wheat flour, these "Cantonese Dim Sum" weren't sold publicly—used only for Transmigrators' own consumption and for entertaining native dignitaries. Wang Zhaomin had naturally never tasted them. Seeing the semi-transparent dumplings served up, wrapping crimson shrimp meat and emerald green peas, he was already somewhat stunned. Placing one in his mouth, Wang Zhaomin closed his eyes to savor it carefully, unable to speak for a long time.

Because it was a late-night snack, no wine was prepared, but the cigarettes and tea were of premium quality. After the meal, Wang Zhaomin smoked a cigarette and pondered for a long while before smiling: "I truly cannot fathom you people!"

This was relatively intimate talk, quite different from the polite remarks exchanged thus far. Wu De understood that Private Secretary Wang's psychological defenses had loosened somewhat. He had deliberately created a relaxed atmosphere precisely to speak frankly with Wang Zhaomin and probe whether there was any possibility of subduing him for their own use.

"How so?"

"With your food, clothing, and expenditure, Australia must be a prosperous land of rich people and a wealthy state. Instead of remaining comfortably in your own homeland, you insisted on leaving your native soil to come to this remote, impoverished backwater of Lingao. What exactly is the reason?"

Wu De laughed dryly several times. *I can hardly tell you right now that it's to 'Unify the Six Directions and Gather the Eight Desolations'—you'd think I was mad. Even a more modest goal—entering the Central Plains—would scare you to death.* He could only say: "Not something to share with outsiders."

Wang Zhaomin, however, thought: *Probably this group were dignitaries in Australia. Either they lost in domestic factional struggles or failed in palace intrigues, so they had to lead their followers and kin across the sea to take refuge in the Great Ming. Seeing them build roads, construct houses, and dredge harbors, they clearly intend to settle here long-term.*

*If so, I could persuade them to write a memorial showing submission—'Internal Attachment.' With their intelligence and various exquisite Australian goods, if they campaigned in the capital beforehand and then presented themselves before the Emperor, the Court probably wouldn't refuse. If the Court allowed them to settle in Lingao, it would resolve an immediate crisis.*

"Having arrived in the Great Ming, does the Noble Group plan to remain in this corner of Lingao for the long term?"

"What insights does Private Secretary Wang have?"

Wang Zhaomin voiced his views. Wu De disapproved inwardly—such amnesty or recruitment schemes were out of the question for now. Seeing him uninterested, Wang Zhaomin could only sigh and cease speaking.

Wu De, however, couldn't afford to chill his heart, so he said: "Private Secretary Wang, it's not that we fail to recognize what's good for us. Though our learning is shallow, we still understand that 'A common man is innocent, but possessing treasures becomes a crime.'"

Wang Zhaomin was startled, recognizing the sense in his words. With what the Australians possessed, if the Court learned of it—never mind the Emperor—wouldn't officials high and low view them as an enormous piece of fat meat? The difficulties, exploitations, and extortions that would follow could only be imagined.

"Yes, yes—the Noble Group's concern is well-founded."

They dropped this issue and continued discussing the details of grain collection. Wang Zhaomin's main purpose this time was to discuss "Private Fees"—the customary benefits the Magistrate received through the grain collection process.

These benefits weren't solely for the Magistrate; the Assistant Magistrate, Jail Warden, and other auxiliary officials in the county all needed to wet their lips somewhat, though the bulk went to the Magistrate. As for Private Secretary Wang, he too had a benefit—customarily around one hundred taels of silver.

In the past, though Tax Farmers existed, they didn't monopolize everything. The collection had to be aggregated at the county, where Wang Zhaomin customarily presided over distribution of the shares. Now that the Australians were monopolizing the process, these fees had to be clarified beforehand.

These benefits naturally came from "Floating Collection." According to Wang Zhaomin, Lingao's customary Floating Collection was an additional 3 *dou* to 3 *dou* 5 *sheng* per *shi* of principal quota, depending on the harvest year.

Within this Floating Collection, 1 *dou* constituted "Private Fees"—the benefit for county officials, normally amounting to 800 to 1000 *shi*.

Wu De nodded. This figure was quite different from the numbers obtained by the Social Investigation Team—it seemed lower. He would have to instruct the Social Investigation Team to conduct another focused sample survey later.

"Though the customary wastage rice is 3 *dou* per *shi* of principal quota, in reality, bitterness and joy are unequal." Wang Zhaomin reminded him. "Some grain households don't pay even one *he* of wastage rice, while some must pay seven or eight *dou*. Whether to pay, and how much—these tricks are all in the clerk's hands. His benefits are found therein."

"I accept the matter of Private Fees," Wu De agreed on the spot. "When grain collection ends, the payment will be presented together." With that, he rose and went to the next room. His accompanying guard retrieved an envelope and returned to the room, handing it to Wang Zhaomin with both hands.

"What is this?" Wang Zhaomin feigned surprise.

"A Letter of Appointment." Wu De spoke with evident sincerity. "We have just arrived here as people from overseas, knowing nothing of these intricacies. Since we are entrusted by the county to undertake tax collection this time, we still need Private Secretary Wang to guide and support us. This is the Letter of Appointment for an 'Advisor.'"

"No need, no need—where is the necessity." Wang Zhaomin declined very politely, thinking: *How could I casually accept such a thing? Wouldn't it become evidence of accepting a 'puppet office' later?*

But seeing Wu De insistent, and fearing refusal might anger the other party, he had to accept it first, thinking he would simply burn it upon returning home.
