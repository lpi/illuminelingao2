# Chapter 502 - The Sycophant

Two or three armed escorts were transferred from the Qiwei Escort Bureau to serve as guards. Like the grain shop's clerks, they handled only their professional duties and did not participate in intelligence work. Qiwei remained merely a joint venture; although the transmigrated collective had achieved effective control over its finances and management, its personnel still came from the old society and had not undergone the collective's "purification" process. Their reliability was a notch lower.

That said, escort bureau men possessed sufficient professionalism. They were more than adequate for security work. Lin Baiguang had always believed that intelligence operatives depended primarily on their brains and eyes, not their fists.

Gao Di was quick-witted and eloquent, so Lin Baiguang appointed him "external affairs manager"—the equivalent of a modern sales director. Chen Tong was earnest and dependable, so he was assigned as "household manager."

As for Lin Baiguang himself, he would be the "proprietor." His cover identity was that of a merchant from Guangzhou opening a grain shop here. All necessary documents would be handled by the Guangzhou Station.

To match his status, and with Executive Committee approval, he was assigned two "maidservants." These young women were also graduates of the intelligence training program; their additional duties were to serve as radio operators and cipher clerks.

"These are your staff, not your 'domestic secretaries,' you know," Hu Qingbai joked when processing the transfer paperwork.

"Do you really think I'd do something so tiresome?" Lin Baiguang scoffed. Not every man treated his reproductive organs' needs as supremely important.

Hu Qingbai missed his point entirely and continued, shaking his head, "Logically speaking, you're a merchant—it won't do for you to have no wife at home…"

"That's where you're wrong," Lin Baiguang replied. "The people at the Grand Library Historical Materials Section say that in ancient times, shopkeepers and proprietors customarily did not bring their families along. Even the wealthiest bosses left their wives in their hometowns, returning only once every few years."

"If I had that much money, I wouldn't want to be a grass widower. What's the point of making money if not to enjoy life…"

Lin Baiguang did not take the bait. In his view, Hu Qingbai failed to understand that one's career was a man's greatest source of excitement; the fleeting pleasures derived from women were nothing in comparison.

After completing the paperwork, he visited the Political Security General Administration to hand over his duties. Now that he had assumed command of an intelligence station, his chain of command had shifted from the Internal Affairs Commission to the Intelligence Commission. His position as director of the Enemy Work Department would have to be temporarily relinquished to avoid neglecting his responsibilities. Additionally, there was a small ceremony to attend.

In the Political Security General Administration's conference room, all staff assembled in crisp uniforms and buckled into their armed belts. The Political Security Administration wore the Year-One naval uniform, differing only by blue collar tabs.

"…To all departments: In recognition of Comrade Lin Baiguang's outstanding contributions to enemy-work operations, this commendation order is hereby issued to commend his exemplary service… Chairman of the Transmigrators' General Assembly Executive Committee: Wen Desi. November 1629."

After Ran Yao finished reading the commendation order, Lin Baiguang offered a formal salute and received it with both hands. A round of hearty applause filled the conference room. A personal chairman's commendation was unprecedented for the entire department—and given Lin Baiguang's achievements, it was well deserved.

"It's a pity we have no medals, and designations like 'First-Class Merit' or 'Second-Class Merit' feel too simplistic. I'd be embarrassed to award those to indigenous personnel, let alone to you. So I applied for a chairman's commendation instead," Ran Yao said apologetically.

After the ceremony, Ran Yao and Lin Baiguang held a private meeting in the office to discuss the handover of the Enemy Work Department. Lin Baiguang requested that certain enemy-work assignments be transferred along with him to the intelligence station, including intelligence-gathering tours across Guangdong and the search for the families of Lin Dan and Xu Cheng in order to continue rounding up Zhu Cailao's remnants.

"That portion of the work can be reassigned to you," Ran Yao agreed. "I'll coordinate with the Intelligence Commission to give you a separate radio call sign. You can continue reporting directly to the Political Security General Administration and requesting assistance."

"Thank you very much." Lin Baiguang then briefed Ran Yao on the ideological state and areas of concern regarding the recruited remnants of Zhu Cailao's organization. Though this was no longer within his purview, he maintained close personal relationships with these individuals and had amassed considerable firsthand insight into their thinking. Since he would be leaving Lingao for a time, a proper briefing was essential lest the work go unattended.

He also requested one person. This individual, however, was a "political prisoner"; although he likewise toiled in the labor-reform camp, Dugu Qiuhun—who oversaw public security forces and managed labor-reform operations—had no jurisdiction over him. Without Political Security General Administration approval, the man could not be released.

"Oh? Who do you want?"

"He Xin."

"That weakling?" Ran Yao was surprised. He knew of He Xin—a pirate, certainly, but a quintessential dandy who had risen through the ranks on a woman's coattails. He possessed no notable skills to speak of.

"He Xin is useless if he stays in Lingao. He can barely cut it even as a laborer. But in my hands, he could prove quite useful," Lin Baiguang said.

"All right, he's yours." Ran Yao approved.

Lin Baiguang's interest in He Xin had been piqued during idle conversations with Shi Shisi and others.

"As for He Xin—eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and high society diversions—he's a master of them all. He'd make an excellent sycophant," Shi Shisi had once joked. "He spent his days keeping the big bosses entertained. But the moment fighting started, he'd get the runs. He was terrified of cannon fire—didn't even want to stay at headquarters, even though the grand master sometimes had to take the field himself. He spent every day skulking around the commissariat."

It turned out He Xin was the son of a fish-trading family in Fujian. After his parents died, he had no interest in the business; within a few years, eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling had squandered the entire inheritance. With nowhere else to go, he sought refuge with his female cousin.

Thanks to his gift of gab and his flair for revelry, he had carved out a small niche within Zhu Cailao's organization, though in practice he functioned as a professional entertainer—a retainer, a hanger-on for the bosses.

A born sycophant and social companion might be of use. Lin Baiguang's grand ambition was to penetrate deeply into Ming society—not among the common rabble, of course, but to cultivate relationships with wealthy merchants, officials, and similar figures. He was confident in his own social skills and tact. What he lacked was familiarity with the debauched diversions of this era. Since He Xin was versed in every aspect of decadent amusement, he could serve as an assistant.

Lin Baiguang continued to probe discreetly about He Xin. Shi Shisi and the others did not particularly dislike the "pretty boy"; though he had advanced thanks to a woman's patronage and was a sycophant, he was not a treacherous or cunning character.

Since he wasn't treacherous, the situation was manageable. Lin Baiguang thought: as long as He Xin wasn't rotten to the core, there was no harm in trying to bring him to heel.

He promptly issued release documents and instructed Gao Di, who had returned to Lingao with him on business, to prepare a private room at the detention facility in Bopu, complete with clothing and personal items.

He himself boarded the public ox-cart to Nanbao, bound for the labor-reform camp there.

After the opening of the Nanbao mines, the labor-reform camp originally located at the Bairen Quarry had been relocated to Nanbao—it was no longer appropriate to keep it near the transmigrated collective's central hub, and blasting stone in the densely developed Bairen Rapids area was unsafe anyway.

Lin Baiguang crossed the drawbridge spanning the deep moat. Sharpened, fire-hardened bamboo stakes lined the bottom of the trench. Beyond the moat rose a barbed-wire fence enclosing twenty or thirty long, low brick-and-timber barracks. Wooden guard towers stood at intervals along the perimeter.

In the open area within the barbed wire stood a wooden platform that sent a chill down one's spine. Strange frames fitted with iron shackles hung from its structure—unmistakably instruments of punishment. Little wonder the indigenous people trembled at the mere mention of this place; evidently, "human rights" were not a priority here.

Fu Youdi hurried out at a trot to greet the visiting official.

"I want He Xin. Bring him to me immediately—I'm taking him away."

Fu Youdi looked apologetic. "Sir! That man is classified as a 'indefinite-term' serious offender. The serious inmates are all at the quarry right now, except for the sick ones. Could you wait until they return from work this evening, and I'll have someone send him to you—"

"I want him now," Lin Baiguang said.

"Then I'm afraid you'll have to come with me to the quarry."

The labor-reform camp's quarry was situated at the foot of a small hillside not far from the main compound—a separate facility reserved for prisoners. Guard towers kept constant watch, and armed soldiers formed a perimeter. Three or four hundred inmates gathered and transported rubble blasted from the rock face. To maintain hygiene and ease identification, every head and beard had been shaved bare. They labored almost naked; the meager scraps of cloth on their bodies served not for modesty but to protect them from scrapes and cuts.

Each gang of prisoners was overseen by a supervisor marked with numbered colored flags, wielding a rattan switch.

The scene reminded Lin Baiguang of the film *Spartacus*. This was nothing short of naked slave labor.

"Are there any female prisoners here?"

"No. Women are a scarce commodity in Lingao—how could we waste them here?" Fu Youdi explained that female prisoners were kept at a different labor site. They performed spinning, cotton-carding, and hide-tanning work. Nanbao served as a window for trade with the Li minority; kapok, cotton, kudzu vine, hemp, and hides flowed out of the Li territories in a steady stream. The Light Industry Ministry had established a primary processing plant here, staffed by convict labor.

"Bring over inmate 16280505130080." At Fu Youdi's command, a subordinate descended into the work area. Before long, a filthy, stark-naked prisoner was escorted up.

"You are He Xin?" Lin Baiguang examined him. Apart from darkened, roughened skin, he appeared reasonably healthy—not at all the broken wreck Lin Baiguang had expected. Only his face was caked with dust and grime.
