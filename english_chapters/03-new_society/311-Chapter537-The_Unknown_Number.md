# Chapter 537 - The Unknown Number

"A pack of bastards!" Dugu Qiuhun said through clenched teeth. "I did all this for the transmigrated collective—and these traitors hiding behind the banner of democracy! The collective will be ruined by them sooner or later!"

Ji Xin waited until Dugu Qiuhun's emotions had stabilized somewhat, then asked him to describe that night's events.

"There's nothing to tell. I've talked to Ran Yao about it several times," Dugu Qiuhun said. "I was just thinking of leading the squad in to quell the riot—all for the sake of protecting the Executive Committee." At this, he grew agitated again. "Director Ma has poured out his heart's blood for all transmigrators. A bunch of people lounging around criticizing—making trouble over a few women. Is the great transmigrator cause more important, or are their genitals? Is there no justice left?!"

Ji Xin thought: this fellow invoking Ma Qianzhu at every turn was a very bad thing. He coughed to interrupt. "Let's stick to your own affairs. Don't bring up other people."

But the reminder had no effect. Dugu Qiuhun still could not go three sentences without mentioning Ma Qianzhu, which made Ji Xin groan inwardly. Wasn't this handing ammunition to the anti-Ma faction? Dugu Qiuhun was seriously lacking in judgment.

He instinctively glanced around. Could there be eavesdropping devices here? But on second thought, Ran Yao probably did not have the nerve—bugging conversations among transmigrators, if exposed, would be a major political incident; whoever touched it was finished. Ran Yao would never touch that high-voltage wire, nor did he have any need to.

Besides, this was the Army Club. The Army had always been Ma Qianzhu's sphere of deep influence; Dugu Qiuhun's ties to the Army were also close. The Army would never allow such a thing on its turf.

Ji Xin set the matter aside and focused on asking about the events of that night.

"I've told you many times. You can read the materials—Ran Yao must have given them to you."

"I know. But I want to hear you tell it again," Ji Xin said. "Go over it once more—don't leave out any details."

"Fine."

So Dugu Qiuhun recounted that night's events. Ji Xin listened carefully. Overall, nothing diverged from the written materials—except when Dugu Qiuhun mentioned "someone called me," at which point Ji Xin interrupted him.

"So you learned about the march only after receiving a phone call?"

"Of course. I was sleeping outside the city. As Outer Perimeter Security Commander, I sleep at the precinct every night, ready to respond to emergencies at any moment. Little did I expect I was protecting a pack of bastards…" Dugu Qiuhun began griping again.

Ji Xin asked, "Who made the call?"

"Lots of people called." Dugu Qiuhun sounded indifferent. "Everything was in chaos—several calls came in. Some on my cell phone, some to my office phone." He rattled off several names—some Ji Xin knew, some he did not. He questioned him about the identities of each. Finally, he asked:

"Who told you that people were 'besieging the Executive Committee'?"

"Every call said that—"

"That's not right," Ji Xin corrected him. "One person you just mentioned said 'protest march.'" He added, "Think carefully again—what exactly did each caller say?"

"What's the difference?"

"A very big difference." Ji Xin said. "Besieging the Executive Committee" and "staging a protest march at the Executive Committee" might sound like the same thing, but the perceived urgency at the time would have been completely different.

Prompted by Ji Xin, Dugu Qiuhun struggled to recall each call's content. Too many days had passed; memory was difficult. But he was certain of one thing: there was indeed one call whose caller he did not know.

"It definitely wasn't someone I knew," Dugu Qiuhun said with conviction.

"Whose number was it?"

"I don't know—very unfamiliar."

"Do you still have the number?"

"It's on my cell phone. My phone's service has been cut—I can't even chat with anyone. Boring as hell. Bah!" Dugu Qiuhun was indignant.

Ji Xin relaxed slightly. Had the phone been confiscated, evidence at many links might have been lost or destroyed, making investigation impossible. The fact that Political Security had not seized the phone at least indicated Ran Yao was clean in this matter. Ji Xin had already made up his mind: if Political Security was really stirring things up in this affair, he would rally the masses to "smash Political Security to bits," whether Ma Jia agreed or not. He was not afraid of anything.

Dugu Qiuhun showed him the phone. Ji Xin copied down all the incoming-call numbers from that time window.

Obviously, this call from an unknown source was highly suspicious—even though Dugu Qiuhun could not confirm that "besieging the Executive Committee" came from that call.

Ji Xin decided to pursue this angle and investigate further, gathering more facts.

Before leaving, he reminded Dugu Qiuhun once more: "Get your chronology straight. At the hearing, talk only about your own affairs." Ji Xin suddenly dropped his voice to a whisper. "Stop mentioning the Director!"

Dugu Qiuhun started, then nodded in sudden realization. He said with some regret, "How stupid of me! It's all in the written record by now!"

Ji Xin left the Army Club with the interview transcript and headed straight for Lingao Telecom to request a meeting with Li Yunxing.

In Li Yunxing's office, Ji Xin presented his commission authorizing him to adjudicate the Dugu Qiuhun case and asked for Li Yunxing's cooperation in the investigation.

"No problem." Li Yunxing readily agreed. "Damn—Dugu Qiuhun really lost his mind. I heard he was originally planning to take over the Telecom Building and cut communications? That's lawlessness!"

Ji Xin was puzzled. This detail appeared only in Li Yayang's deposition. Only Dugu Qiuhun and Li Yayang knew. All materials in this case were still classified—how did Li Yunxing know?

"Li Yayang told you, I suppose?" Ji Xin feigned nonchalance. "He's been dragged down hard in all this."

"It's all over Bairen Fortress. Who's Li Yayang?" Li Yunxing said with interest. "Someone else got implicated?"

"It's all over the Fortress?" Ji Xin was startled.

"That's right. I heard it from someone else too." Li Yunxing seemed quite interested and kept asking whether there was any inside scoop.

"Nothing yet." Ji Xin was evasive. He handed over the list of numbers he had copied. "Could you help me check who these numbers belong to?"

"You don't need me for that, do you?" Li Yunxing said. "Don't you have an internal phone directory? Every cell-phone number is in there."

"Please check for me—it'll have more credibility. This is evidence for the hearing."

"Easy enough." He told an indigenous clerk to identify the owner of each number.

Ji Xin also requested: could he pull the numbers called to and from Dugu Qiuhun's phone during the incident's time window, along with exact times and call durations? He was afraid Dugu Qiuhun's phone records might be incomplete or that he had deleted something.

"All right." Li Yunxing nodded. "But you'll need to give me a warrant."

"Here is an Arbitration Tribunal search warrant." To facilitate the investigation, Ma Jia had provided him with several blank legal documents, all pre-stamped. He simply filled in the date and grounds, added his personal signature, and it was ready.

"Wow—the Arbitration Tribunal is efficient. You've even got search warrants." Li Yunxing took the warrant like a rare treasure, turning it over and over. Then he made an internal call to Shao Zong, instructing him to immediately pull Dugu Qiuhun's call records from the server.

Fifteen minutes later, Shao Zong brought the materials.

"Nothing missing?" Li Yunxing knew this was no trivial matter and did not take it lightly. He asked again.

"It's all there—printed straight from the computer," Shao Zong said. "Since it's for evidence, otherwise I wouldn't have fired up the printer."

"Many thanks," Ji Xin said. "Could I have a desk? I need to cross-check."

Li Yunxing arranged for him to have an office. Ji Xin took the printout and the list of number owners supplied by the indigenous clerk and began cross-referencing.

The phone records matched the server records. Almost every number on the ownership list belonged to one of Dugu Qiuhun's friends, colleagues, or acquaintances. Ji Xin noticed that one number had no name—only the brief notation "public phone."

He took the number to Li Yunxing. Li Yunxing told him: there were several public PHS phones around Bairen Fortress. The transmigrated collective's manually switched telephones could not connect to cell phones, so for convenience, public cell phones had been set up, chained inside special boxes. They were seldom used.

"How many locations have them?"

"One in the Executive Committee compound, one in the canteen, one in the Recreation Hall, and one at the coffee house on the Demonstration Farm."

"The Executive Committee compound?!" Ji Xin exclaimed.

"Yes, in the Executive Committee's classified-communications room." Li Yunxing gave him a puzzled look.

"Oh." Ji Xin thought it probably was not that number. The classified-communications room would certainly have strict usage-logging procedures. Anyone trying mischief would not use it.

"This number is the one in the Recreation Hall," Li Yunxing said. "I know it without checking the directory."

"Thanks." Ji Xin hurried out. He went straight to the Recreation Hall.

The Recreation Hall was a facility inside Bairen Fortress for all transmigrators' entertainment. Its interior resembled a hybrid of an internet café and a library. Besides locally printed books and newspapers, it had computers for accessing the intranet and playing games, plus PS3s, Xbox 360s, PSPs, and other gaming consoles, along with TVs, DVD players, sound systems, karaoke equipment, and similar entertainment devices. It was the place transmigrators visited most frequently in their spare time.

The public phone sat in a corner. Here, a crank telephone and a PHS handset encased in a plastic sleeve and chained to the wall stood in plain sight.
