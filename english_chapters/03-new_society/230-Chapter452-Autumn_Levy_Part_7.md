# Chapter 452 - Autumn Levy (Part 7)

Zhou Botao's subordinates had proposed a crude but direct method: simply drug Zhou Qi unconscious and deposit him in Qiuhong's bed, then lure Chen Minggang over. Though rough, it would certainly prove effective. Even if Chen Minggang recognized it as a setup, for the sake of his reputation he would have to expel Zhou Qi.

However, this approach would produce severe aftereffects—Chen Minggang would immediately realize someone was targeting him, putting him on guard. Moreover, after conducting a site inspection, Zhou Botao had concluded that the operation wouldn't be feasible. Six or seven of Chen Minggang's men were stationed around Qiuhong's residence keeping watch, with another four or five servants inside the courtyard. Too many people were involved. Chen Minggang was no fool.

Operating outside proved equally difficult. According to surveillance reports, Qiuhong seldom ventured out—Chen Minggang generally forbade her from leaving anyway. She wasn't a local and had no acquaintances in the county to visit. Lingao was a small place with no decent temples—even the common leisure activity of making temple offerings, typical for women in ancient society, was unavailable.

With her secluded thus, nothing could be done. They couldn't penetrate the residence, and they couldn't draw her out. Unable to devise a superior plan, Zhou Botao could only have the Special Propaganda Team continue spreading rumors and gossip.

Zhou Qi himself remained completely oblivious. Since the autumn levy began, he had been extremely busy. Chen Minggang had delegated most of the work to him. Zhou Qi interpreted this as a sign of his master's trust—he had been anxious about the incident with Qiuhong being beaten, but now felt somewhat reassured that his standing with his master hadn't diminished.

Though they had played the "land survey" card this year, his master had already briefed them that the key lay in "negotiating terms" with the major households.

"Our own share of benefits—that must be negotiated first," Chen Minggang had instructed him. "But we must also keep the Australians satisfied. The major households need to surrender some of the land they've previously underreported, hidden, or falsely registered—only then can this matter be concluded satisfactorily."

As for how much each household would surrender, the specific amounts were negotiable, but Chen Minggang had prepared a list with minimum requirements. Each household had to report at least some acreage according to their scale; attempting to bribe their way out without reporting a single *mu* was absolutely unacceptable.

Chen Minggang understood clearly: to borrow the Australians' authority, he had to produce tangible results. Operating purely on bribes wouldn't work under the Australians' watchful gaze.

Zhou Qi grasped his master's intentions perfectly. Thus, these past days he had been rushing about the countryside, spending virtually all his time negotiating terms and bargaining.

Naturally, matters weren't progressing smoothly. Chen Minggang's demands were harsh: not only must each household report some hidden land, but the tribute rice amounts had also increased. In the past, some grain households had paid no tribute rice or only a token amount; this time, Chen Minggang was uncompromising, insisting they pay in full according to the prescribed quotas.

"If we don't squeeze them hard now, we may never encounter another opportunity like this," Chen Minggang had instructed him. "Don't fear pushing too hard or speaking harsh words. With the Australian masters behind us, what is there to fear? We're not afraid of things turning ugly—Dang Namen was so arrogant, yet his head still ended up hanging from the city gate!"

While all this was true, Zhou Qi didn't wish to proceed this way. His master was his master; he was himself. Whether he could ever become a yamen clerk himself remained uncertain—given the current situation, he probably had no hope. Chen Minggang had three sons, the eldest already twenty. His master was still relatively young and could easily continue for another decade, after which the position would naturally pass to his own son. Who knew what attitude that junior apprentice-brother would adopt toward him then?

He wasn't an official clerk—when all was said and done, he remained merely an unregistered hand. Ancient times also placed great weight on "establishment." Zhou Qi operated on the principle that more friends meant more options, so he remained consistently courteous to the major households and always made clear upfront that these demands came from "above," not from his own initiative.

"This humble one also has no choice," he would say with a pleasing smile to the major households. "Look at me—I'm thirty years old without even a wife, just scraping by. Please, gentlemen, show some understanding!"

These words amounted to a hint: The benefits aren't flowing to me. Direct your blame where it belongs.

**Liu Family Village.**

"So you're saying we absolutely must report additional acreage to get through this?" Liu Guangbiao inquired.

Liu Youren had dispatched Liu Guangbiao to negotiate terms with Zhou Qi on behalf of the Liu family—this way, should negotiations collapse, room for maneuver would remain.

"Exactly." Zhou Qi nodded definitively. "The Australians wish to conduct a land survey. They can't merely make thunder without producing rain, can they? They require some face, at minimum."

"Hmm, that makes sense." Liu Guangbiao studied Zhou Qi intently, attempting to discern some trick from his expression, but Zhou Qi's face remained wreathed in smiles, deferential and obliging throughout.

"Old Seventh, just draw the line—what's the price?" Liu Guangbiao asked.

"Let's not rush to discuss prices. First, may I inquire about Third Master Liu's intention—how much does Liu Family Village plan to report?" The amount of additional land reported directly affected the private fees. This point couldn't be mistaken.

Zhou Qi possessed Chen Minggang's bottom-line list. He had handled grain payment matters for Liu Family Village before and knew they had less than four hundred *mu* on the tax register. But Liu Youren actually owned over two thousand *mu*.

"How about five hundred *mu* total of assessable land?"

---

"How much land Master Liu actually possesses, you know better than I," Zhou Qi replied slowly. "Besides, with the vast Jialai Plains right there, you can scarcely claim you possess only five hundred *mu*—the Australian chiefs aren't fools, you realize."

Liu Guangbiao understood this meant offering to report just one or two hundred extra *mu* wouldn't suffice. He probed, "Old Seventh, what you're suggesting is—"

"At minimum, half must be reported. Twelve hundred *mu*."

"Twelve hundred *mu*!" Liu Guangbiao acted as though terrified. "How is that acceptable? That's far too... too..."

"Third Master Liu!" Zhou Qi emphasized his tone. "Don't be heartbroken. With half reported, you still retain the other half! If you consider that excessive, when the Australians come out to survey the land themselves—then I'm afraid every fraction of every *mu* will be recorded in their registers..."

Liu Guangbiao recognized this as an opening bid, awaiting his counter. He pondered for a moment.

"Just name your price—what's the maximum reduction?"

The two sides haggled back and forth, finally settling on terms: Liu Family Village would newly report two hundred thirty *mu*, bringing their total assessable land to just over seven hundred *mu*. As for tribute rice, both parties agreed that this year's rate would be three *dou* three *sheng* per *shi* of base levy—also an increase; in the past, Liu Family Village's tribute rice had been merely one *dou* two *sheng*. Of the increase, one full *dou* constituted Chen Minggang's "private fee." This amount was unprecedented.

After seeing Zhou Qi off, Liu Youren, who had been listening in the back hall throughout, slowly emerged. Liu Guangbiao hurried to greet him.

"Third Uncle! What do you think—"

"It's acceptable. You handled this well." Liu Youren sighed. Though Zhou Qi's tone had remained respectful, Chen Minggang's crew truly possessed enormous appetites this year. In the past, a mere eight or ten taels of silver would have settled matters. This time, besides adding tribute rice and reporting hidden land, they had even dared to embed their private fees within the tribute rice itself!

"These Australians are truly causing endless harm!" Liu Guangbiao said bitterly. "Chen Minggang never dared be this brazen before!"

"Mm." Liu Youren said nothing more. By now he fully understood. This so-called land survey was probably indeed the Australians' idea—but Chen Minggang had exploited it, transforming it into a tool for extortion and enrichment. Otherwise, there would be no need to pressure everyone to report hidden land, and reporting too little wouldn't do—Chen Minggang also understood the Australians couldn't be casually fooled; there had to be tangible results.

He only found it strange that the Australians would permit Chen Minggang and his gang to run amok. Given their capabilities, if they surveyed the land themselves, wouldn't it prove more accurate? And less disruptive to the populace...

Liu Youren suddenly realized: if the Australians truly surveyed the land themselves, major households like his would have no room for maneuvering whatsoever! They would probably have to report every last *mu* exactly as it stood. Come to think of it, having a parasite like Chen Minggang around offered certain advantages.

Still, the resentment from being extorted couldn't be shaken off.

"To think I must humble myself before such petty men!" he said bitterly. It seemed that to avoid being bullied, he would need to establish direct connections with the Australians. If even Chen Minggang wasn't afraid to associate openly with the Australians and serve as their instrument, why should he—a rural landowner with a purchased *jiansheng* degree—be afraid?

"When Chief Xun arrives, treat him well," he instructed Liu Guangbiao. "Draw closer to him, cultivate a relationship. Inform him about this situation."

"Yes, your nephew understands!"

"Also, the Meilan matter—you need to devote more thought to it. I'm thinking that when Chief Xun comes this time, have Meilan serve him..." At this point he realized the impropriety. Meilan wasn't a maidservant; she couldn't simply be thrust upon someone. That would actually make them look down on her.

"Your nephew will devise something." Liu Guangbiao understood immediately.

"Has her father agreed?"

"The opportunity to befriend an Australian master—her father is beside himself with joy." Liu Youren knew, of course, that his nephew was speaking nonsense and had probably employed some combination of threats and inducements. But this was immaterial: Liu Meilan's family was insignificant within the clan, and no one cared about their opinions.

"When the memorial rice is distributed at year's end, give her family a bit extra," Liu Youren said. "And the dowry for Meilan's wedding—let it come from the common fund. Let her marry in proper style."

"Third Uncle thinks of everything!" Liu Guangbiao smiled. "Not only her family can receive more—every branch can receive substantially more memorial rice this year. The harvest was truly excellent. Better than all our neighbors! Joining the Tiandihui was absolutely the right decision, sir."

Speaking of the harvest, Liu Youren's mood finally brightened somewhat: Fortunately, this year's harvest had been exceptional!

First, the weather had been favorable without major disasters. Second, after joining the Tiandihui, Chief Xun had proven genuinely devoted, employing numerous methods to assist their farming. Some techniques he found unremarkable, but others were quite extraordinary. The paddies had already been drained for sun-drying, and though Liu Youren was a landlord, he was well-versed in farming. Examining this year's rice ears, he observed not only more stalks per plant but also notably heavier heads. He casually selected one and counted—not only were there far more grains than before, but there were remarkably few empty or shriveled heads.
