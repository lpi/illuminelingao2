# Chapter 465 - Autumn Levy (Part 20)

Wu Mingjin and Wang Zhaomin exchanged glances. This was not something that could simply be "settled." Wang Zhaomin said, "The matter is this: investigating, arresting—these all require warrants and orders. You gentlemen are not Ming subjects, and you hold neither official rank nor commissions..."

"This case will naturally remain under the county's primary jurisdiction," Xiong Buyou replied. "We will merely assist from the side."

Wang Zhaomin understood that so-called "assisting from the side" meant the Baldies still wanted to control the handling of this matter. Well, that was fine too—might as well toss this hot potato back to its original owner. He also wanted to see what the Australians were really up to.

Wu Mingjin coughed and excused himself, saying he was unwell and needed to rest briefly. Xiong Buyou understood this was the official way of saying "You may proceed, but I wash my hands of it." What came next could be discussed with Wang Zhaomin alone. This was a common stratagem in official circles.

Wang Zhaomin thought this case absolutely could not have the Australians presiding over court hearings. The only option was to delegate a county official to take the lead, with the Australians directing from behind.

"Send for Magistrate Sun," Wang Zhaomin ordered.

This assignment naturally fell to the Jail Warden. The position of Jail Warden had existed only since the Ming dynasty, evolving from the County Lieutenant of the Song and Yuan eras. His duties were roughly prison and patrol matters—essentially public security work. In places without a Patrol Station, he also handled patrol, suppression, and bandit-catching duties. Entrusting this matter to him was entirely appropriate.

The Jail Warden's rank was very low—not even a rating on the nine-grade system, counted as "unranked." Still, being unranked was still being an "official," which required formal court appointment.

Those who served as Jail Wardens were among the most frustrated of scholars, mostly selected from the ranks of "students by purchase." If *juren* who failed to pass the *jinshi* examination could still "make the selection" for county magistrate or county assistant posts, purchased students could only hope for trivial positions like Registrar, Education Officer, or Jail Warden. Promotion prospects were minimal.

Thus the county's Jail Warden, Sun Ruiwu, had become a typical official who saw everything in terms of money. Unfortunately, the locality was truly poor, local powers and bandits were formidable, and his meager office offered limited pickings.

The Australians' arrival had brought Sun Ruiwu good fortune. Because of his lowly rank, he was often dispatched as a sacrificial lamb to handle Australian affairs on Wu Mingjin's behalf. Each such assignment brought its rewards. The various pleasures of the East Gate Market made him all the more unable to resist. Thus, under the double stimulation of cash bribes and material enjoyments, Jail Warden Sun sank ever deeper into collaboration. Whenever the Australians had any activities, he was always the first to appear, performing his duties with great enthusiasm. He had become known around the county, mockingly, as the "Australian Jail Warden."

Sun Ruiwu himself was entirely unbothered by this reputation. Every day he enjoyed life at the East Gate Market, getting along very well with Dugu Qiuhun. The two frequently "corrupted" together. This purchased student had long forgotten whatever sage teachings he had once studied, having tossed any concern about barbarian-civilized distinctions to the winds.

"That won't work." Unexpectedly, Xiong Buyou objected to the usual arrangement. "Secretary Wang, Jail Warden Sun's rank is too low. This case involves the county's gentry and major households. Without a person of adequate stature presiding, I fear public sentiment won't be reassured."

"Then what does Master Xiong suggest?"

"It would be better to have County Deputy Wu preside, with Magistrate Sun assisting."

"That makes sense." Wang Zhaomin thought this was reasonable enough. As long as his master did not have to be the face of it, whether Sun the Jail Warden or Wu the County Deputy made no difference.

He sent for both officials and briefed them on the situation. Hearing that this case was for the Australians, Jail Warden Sun immediately agreed wholeheartedly. Wu Ya, however, paused to think before saying, "Gentlemen chiefs, this knife-and-arrow intimidation case—the case itself is straightforward. The difficulty lies in handling it..."

Wang Zhaomin cleared his throat and said: *Since you're discussing official business, I won't intrude further.* And he slipped out.

"I've heard a bit about the difficulties," Xiong Buyou said. "However, this matter is of great importance. We must investigate thoroughly and give the county a proper accounting."

"Yes, yes. Since Chief Xiong puts it that way, we shall comply fully." Wu Ya knew there was nothing in this for him—he and the Jail Warden were just there as figureheads. "Where does Chief Zhou plan to set up his office?"

"In the county yamen, naturally. Let's use the Second Hall—"

"That's not appropriate." Wu Ya shook his head. "Chief Zhou has no official rank in the Great Ming—he's a commoner. Unauthorized use of the Second Hall would itself be a crime. Besides—"

Besides, Wu Mingjin was still the "lord of a hundred *li*." He could not be summoned at will like a servant. And in the past, holding court and trying cases was a serious and weighty matter—it could not be treated too casually.

"I think we should conduct the case in the Flower Hall," Jail Warden Sun suggested.

"My thought exactly." Wu Ya nodded.

The Flower Hall was part of the inner compound. However, whenever the county had cases involving morality issues or gentry and major households, they were generally tried in the Flower Hall rather than publicly in the Main or Second Halls—this was to preserve the parties' dignity.

Because it was part of the inner compound and not an officially designated court area, Zhou Dongtian could conduct proceedings there without any problem.

"Good." Xiong Buyou nodded. "Let's do that." He cupped his hands. "This case involves many people. Secrecy regarding developments is essential. We will be implementing security measures at the yamen shortly. Please don't be alarmed."

"Security measures?" Neither Wu Ya nor Sun Ruiwu had anticipated this. They were greatly startled. What were they planning to do?

"Don't worry," Xiong Buyou reassured them gently. "This is unavoidable, ha ha." With that, he made a phone call:

"Begin."

---

The several dozen guards stationed outside the yamen immediately moved into the compound, completely controlling all entrances and key points within. No one in the yamen could leave; entry was still permitted.

Meanwhile, following Xiong Buyou's phone call, three army squads that had been standing by moved swiftly to Lingao County's three city gates, immediately taking control. They did not openly take over city defense but stationed themselves in the guard chambers behind the gates to monitor the militia.

The NCOs of each squad had spent weeks memorizing faces. By now they had committed to memory the faces of Lingao County's clerks and all their "public service" confederates. Wu De's orders to them were: these individuals could enter the city but were not permitted to leave.

"If anyone tries to leave the city, detain them immediately and send them to the county yamen. Understood?"

"Yes! Understood."

Inside the yamen, as key departments came under control, the clerks working there grew uneasy and emerged to inquire. Sun Ruiwu had to come out and calm everyone, telling them not to panic.

Zhou Dongtian sent for the Head of the Constables.

Lin Changsan, head of the Constable Squad, was a sharp-featured man in his thirties with a blade-shaped face and a pair of small, very keen eyes. His arms were well-muscled—befitting a veteran constable whose specialty was administering punishments.

Arriving at the Flower Hall and paying his respects, Lin Changsan saw two of the county's officials seated above, while an Australian man in his thirties or forties sat in the lower position. His eyes were ice-cold—clearly not someone to be trifled with.

Zhou Dongtian scrutinized the constable chief. "Bring me the roster! Assemble the entire squad of constables. I want to call roll."

"Yes, yes." Lin Changsan hurried out to give orders. Before long, all the constables had assembled.

Zhou Dongtian opened the roster and was startled. The list was densely packed with fifty or sixty names, yet only about twenty men stood below awaiting roll call.

"What's this? Not everyone is here?"

"Your Honor may not be aware," Lin Changsan said carefully. "The numbers in the roster don't count. These are all nominal constables."

Because yamen runners enjoyed exemptions from labor service and grain levies, some people paid to have their names registered on the roster without ever actually serving.

"...Only those with payment amounts noted beside their names are the ones who actually work."

Zhou Dongtian counted—twenty-four names had payment records. He called the roll. All present and accounted for.

"Each of you immediately prepare a complete set of constable uniforms. Now!"

The men looked at each other in confusion, not knowing what this was about. Lin Changsan glanced toward Jail Warden Sun. Sun Ruiwu waved impatiently. "Do as he says! What are you dawdling for?"

"Your Honor, this servant only has this one set of official clothes."

"Then take it off!" Sun Ruiwu ordered.

The constables had no choice but to comply. Before long, all the uniforms had been collected.

These clothes were immediately put on by the students from the Political Security rapid-training program they had brought along.

"Alright, everyone look sharp! Get these clothes on." You Guotuan barked orders.

You Guotuan was a staff member of the Security General Administration. In the modern timeline, he had been an unremarkable ordinary citizen. But in the seventeenth century, he had become a zealous advocate of violent methods. He consistently maintained that only the most ruthless and merciless approaches could effectively establish rule. Originally he had served in the army, but the Political Security General Administration, thinking he would create "unhealthy tendencies" among the troops, had transferred him to their own department.

Sure enough, once at the Political Security General Administration, he thrived. He quickly drew attention from his colleagues with his brutal rhetoric. Of course, his ruthless style had not yet had the opportunity to manifest itself.

"Alright, now you are all county yamen constables. According to the plan, secure all the key points!"

In moments, Lingao County seat and the county yamen were completely under the transmigrators' control.

The constables, crowded together in the Flower Hall, gazed uneasily at Zhou Dongtian as he issued his strange commands. Lin Changsan wore an expression of terrified sycophancy, practically ready to prostrate himself. Zhou Dongtian sneered inwardly: *You think you can fool people with that act, pretending to be harmless? Too bad—this old man isn't some naive novice who thinks he radiates authority.*

"Gentlemen," Zhou Dongtian said slowly, "you are all hereditary professionals, experts in the application of torture. Tomorrow during the interrogation, I'll be relying on you heavily!"
