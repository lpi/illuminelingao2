# Chapter 304: Sweet Port Turbulence — Suing for Peace

This meant, naturally, that apart from a small faction closely aligned with Master Zhu, he represented the prevailing sentiment of the majority of sugar firms.

Setting aside the veracity of this statement, Feng Guangfeng's arrival at the very least indicated that the Haiyi Guild had begun to fracture internally. Some members were seeking their own path forward.

"What is the purpose of your visit?"

Feng Guangfeng hesitated briefly before divulging the substance of the confidential discussions among the many sugar firms of the Haiyi Guild over the preceding days.

Except for Master Zhu's Riyicheng, all other firms within the Haiyi Guild had concluded it was time to make peace with the South China factory. The immense strength the factory had demonstrated—both in mobilizing capital and in dispatching pirates—made them realize with painful clarity that Master Zhu's attempt to strangle the newcomers was akin to a mantis trying to halt a chariot.

Therefore, they proposed a truce. The Haiyi Guild would accept South China Sugar as a member, extending all the privileges of the trade: hereafter, the company could acquire sugar throughout Leizhou at will, provided it adhered to the guild's agreed pricing, without obstruction from other members. Likewise, their sugar could be shipped out freely, with no interference from the guild.

In exchange, they hoped South China Sugar would reduce its acquisition price to 1.8 taels, while the Haiyi Guild raised theirs to 2 taels. This would attract farmers who hadn't yet sold to return to Hai'an Street.

"This is unreasonable, I know," Feng Guangfeng acknowledged. "But these past days, almost no guild members have received any sugar stocks. Your factory has acquired abundantly this season and profited handsomely. We implore you to show mercy and leave a path for your colleagues to survive!" He bowed deeply once more.

Wen Tong found these conditions absurd—this was suing for peace? Offering a seat in the Haiyi Guild was supposed to be a great concession? As for free acquisition and shipping, wasn't South China Sugar already operating freely? Of course, this "freedom" had been won by the Transmigration Group's guns. The Great Ancestor's dictum—"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"—truly pierced to the essence of things.

"Boss Feng!" Wen Tong considered for a moment. "This is curious logic. The scarcity of sugar stocks is a consequence of the Haiyi Guild lowering prices of its own accord. What does it have to do with us? If you wish to purchase sugar now, simply raise your prices. We give you our word not to raise ours further."

"This—" Feng Guangfeng was rendered speechless. The argument was well-founded and irrefutable. He himself recognized that asking them to adjust prices lacked any legitimate basis.

"...Is joining the Haiyi Guild so rare a privilege?" Wen Tong laughed. "Isn't our factory prospering quite nicely as things stand? You've witnessed the fate of those who attempted underhanded schemes. You people! Naive! Truly too naive! To still harbor such notions at this stage!" He laughed heartily, projecting an aura of command. "Had my employer not wished to be magnanimous to the utmost, the Haiyi Guild would have been reduced to ashes long ago."

The laugh was unrestrained and sweeping, dispelling the gloom of months of anxiety. Even Zhou Shizhai, whose martial cultivation typically kept him "unmoved," allowed himself a smile.

Had this been spoken a fortnight earlier, Feng Guangfeng might have dismissed it as bluster. Now, his back was drenched in perspiration.

"Yes, yes," Feng Guangfeng bowed again. "Regarding past events, we were blind, our judgment clouded by greed! We caused great offense! But we still beseech the managers to facilitate this matter. The large and small members of the Haiyi Guild will be eternally indebted!"

This presented a dilemma. An outright refusal might drive them closer together, compelling them to follow Master Zhu to the bitter end. It would also squander the perfect opportunity to absorb the Haiyi Guild. But agreeing would mean breaking faith with the Leizhou farmers.

This matter demanded caution. Wen Tong and Chen Tianxiong exchanged glances. Wen Tong said, "How about this: Boss Feng, please return for now. We need to deliberate before reaching a decision."

"Yes, then this humble one awaits favorable news." Feng Guangfeng understood that such a momentous matter wouldn't receive an immediate promise. Terms would inevitably be stipulated, which was only to be expected.

Chen Tianxiong nodded. "If we need to contact you, where should we send word?"

"Go to the Dachang Rice Shop and ask Boss Zhu to relay a message. He is my fellow townsman."

"Boss Zhu... isn't he from Qinzhou?" Chen Tianxiong inquired deliberately. "I recall the owners and shopkeepers of the Haiyi Guild hail predominantly from Shantou and Guangzhou."

"I am not from those parts," Feng Guangfeng made no attempt to conceal it, explaining how, as a clerk at Richangji, he had been chosen by the owner to marry into the family and inherit the business.

Chen Tianxiong already knew this from his investigations. Seeing him speak without evasion suggested Boss Feng was honest. This disposition was favorable.

"We need to take control of this organization—the Haiyi Guild," Wen Tong declared after seeing Feng Guangfeng out.

Several key figures of the South China factory had assembled in the room. Mei Lin had returned to Lingao; Xiao Gui and Beiwei were uninterested in commercial matters and hadn't attended. Chang Shide, fresh from Lingao, was present.

"Naturally. Otherwise, we could simply eliminate them," Chen Tianxiong agreed. His thinking ran deeper than Wen Tong's. Intelligence gathering had provided him with a thorough understanding of the Haiyi Guild's scale and capabilities. The twenty-one sugar firms each possessed a minimum capital exceeding ten thousand taels. Their combined capital surpassed five or six hundred thousand taels. If this money could be directed by the Transmigration Group, it would greatly benefit the factory's next phase of expansion.

Direction didn't mean possession. That would constitute naked robbery. Merely joining the "Haiyi Guild" as a member wouldn't permit direction. Although Master Zhu exercised a degree of control over the guild, he merely managed to facilitate communication and unity; business was still conducted individually.

"If we're going to do this, we make it a holding company," Chang Shide proposed, his suggestion causing a stir.

"Haha, we think alike." Wen Tong beamed. "Of course, we'll be Chairman and CEO."

"What CEO? This habit of abusing English abbreviations must cease. Call it keeping pace with the times! Just say Chief Executive Officer," Chen Tianxiong remarked solemnly.

"Fine. But persuading this group to join a joint-stock company will be difficult. Human hearts are complex."

"That's precisely why the present moment is opportune," Chen Tianxiong explained. "We ride the momentum of the great victory at Chrysanthemum Islets. While they're paralyzed with fear, we push it through in one decisive stroke. Once they recover their composure, we may no longer be able to control these sugar magnates!" He sipped his tea. "Complex hearts don't matter. The key is to hold firm to the word 'profit.'"

The Haiyi Guild had united against South China Sugar for profit; now they sought peace and prepared to abandon Master Zhu, also for profit. As long as the South China parent company could provide sufficient profit, these merchants would gladly comply.

"However, execution is difficult. The key is finding someone among them who understands both the trade and the wider world. Only then will our words carry weight with them. Otherwise, if they're all provincial bumpkins, we'll merely be shouting at the wind!"

"Someone with prestige, too," Wen Tong added. "Those who perceive clearly often hold no power. Those without power speak in vain."

This resonated with everyone. Their knowledge of the Haiyi Guild's internal affairs remained limited. Xiao Zhanfeng had offered some insights, but as an outsider, he knew little.

Wen Tong asked, "What about Feng Guangfeng? He seems sincere."

"He won't do," Chen Tianxiong replied. "He's a live-in son-in-law. The ancients looked down upon such men most. And he's not a fellow townsman to most guild members. Additionally, he's a minor player; his words carry no weight."

Everyone felt slightly disappointed. Then Chang Shide laughed: "I have it! In any trade guild, while they claim to protect industry interests, it's invariably the few large firms benefiting while the small firms suffer—"

"We recruit the small firms!" Chen Tianxiong grasped the insight instantly.

They immediately summoned Liao Daxing and inquired about the firms comprising the Haiyi Guild.

"Four major firms. The remainder are small," Liao Daxing replied. Having served as a grain shop clerk for years, he knew the fundamentals.

"The largest is naturally Master Zhu's Riyicheng." Actually, Riyicheng hadn't originally been the largest. When Master Zhu inherited it, it had ranked last among the major firms.

"...It prospered because he founded the Haiyi Guild. He unified the scattered elements of Hai'an Street—and seized considerable benefits for himself."

"There must be conflicts between large and small firms, correct?"

"How could there not be! Consider the public account. The Haiyi Guild collects a common fund for dealings with officials, pirates, and hiring guards. Originally, it amounted to ten thousand taels annually, apportioned with large firms paying one share and small firms half a share."

"...Later, it increased to twenty thousand taels annually—"

"The large firms claim they pay, but actually don't, or pay reduced amounts, correct?"

"Yes, small firms grumble about it privately." Liao Daxing nodded. "Actually, only Riyicheng truly pays nothing. Large firms paying less is accurate. Furthermore, only Heaven knows the guild's actual expenditures. Everything is managed by Master Zhu's people."

"How do you know this so thoroughly?" Chen Tianxiong was intrigued.

"It's not difficult. Boss Feng and Boss Zhu are fellow townsmen and drink together frequently. I overheard it. Boss Feng is quite a character!" Liao Daxing spoke of Feng Guangfeng with evident admiration.

"Good person, skilled in business. It's rare to find someone not obsessed with money! Several small firms respect him and don't look down upon him as a live-in son-in-law."

Understanding the guild's structure and maladies confirmed that recruiting the small firms was viable. The question that remained: how?
