# Chapter 436 - Transportation Issues

The forging shop had originally possessed a crude, makeshift free-fall forging hammer, but its efficiency was low. It barely sufficed for current needs. As industrial standards continued to rise, the machine factory's enthusiasts were prepared to abandon this crude equipment and construct a hundred-ton hydraulic press. Later, they realized this goal was too ambitious and decided to begin with more primitive means: manufacturing a steam forging hammer. This device was not technologically sophisticated, but it was effective enough. The Jiangnan Shipyard had two steam forging hammers built around 1880 that remained in service through the 1990s. Even when the bases deteriorated, Jiangnan was reluctant to dismantle them and kept patching them up for continued use.

With a steam forging hammer, forging many large workpieces became considerably easier. The entire apparatus's slide rail stood five meters high, constructed entirely of steel, mounted upon a foundation of granite plus reinforced concrete. The forging hammer on top weighed one ton and was driven by a steam-operated slide valve.

Compared to the free-fall forging hammer the machine factory had previously designed and manufactured, this hammer's forging capacity and work efficiency improved three to four times over. Using the old hammer had been laborious—one constantly operated the steam engine to lift the hammer, then used a cam clutch to control the drop. Each forging strike was separated by long intervals, preventing continuous forging and causing great difficulties for heat treatment.

The forging shop quickly finished processing the low-carbon steel jaw plate, then manufactured the toggle plate and eccentric shaft using the same method. After completing the eccentric shaft, they took it to the lathe for turning to achieve the greatest possible circularity. Finally, they manufactured two large flywheels with a diameter of 1.2 meters, to be connected to the power source.

These behemoth components were loaded onto ox-carts and hauled slowly to Nanbao. Because ordinary four-wheeled ox-carts had limited carrying capacity, they were placed on specially made large flatbed carts with sixteen wheels, pulled by twelve oxen. Regardless of what this contraption was actually for, the convoy alone attracted crowds of onlookers and spirited discussion—the folk along the road were amazed at how wastefully the Australians used steel.

The equipment was installed in the newly constructed Workshop No. 1 at the Nanbao Mining Site. Workshop No. 1 was a large-span iron truss factory building designed by Bingfeng, three stories in height. The structure employed reinforced concrete columns for support. The floor was poured with concrete and had iron rails installed for ore carts.

An overhead crane was installed on the workshop ceiling to deliver a large hopper for loading the crusher's materials. In Zhan Wuya's view, a belt conveyor would actually be optimal, but they lacked a suitable substitute for now. Using deerskin would be too extravagant.

At last, Xiao Gui arrived to install the steam engine. The system was finally complete. The massive apparatus, weighing approximately ten tons in total with its steel and giant base, stood in the center of the workshop. Not only were the native workers impressed—even the Transmigrators themselves found it awe-inspiring.

As Xiao Gui ignited the boiler, the steam engine slowly began to turn. Under the transmission of the large gearbox, the final stage delivered power via belt to the crusher's flywheel. As the flywheel's rotational speed gradually increased, the crusher officially commenced operation.

Workers used flatbed rail cars on tracks to bring in a load of large rocks. The overhead crane, driven by steam-powered pulleys, quickly hoisted a massive rock and dropped it into the crusher. *Clank-clank, clank-clank*—the crusher operated at a steady pace. The movable jaw plate slowly opened and closed. As the jaw opened and closed, the huge rock sank deeper and was clamped ever tighter. The rock began to crack, throwing off many chips. With a boom, a plume of white smoke rose, and the rock shattered into several pieces.

Everyone present was startled, but the machine factory men knew this operation was completely normal.

The jaw plate continued its slow, relentless compression. The rocks, now smaller after cracking, were clamped ever tighter in their descent, continuing to endure the compression of the movable and fixed jaw plates, constantly fracturing further.

Crushed stone and powder began appearing at the discharge port. Thick dust filled the air. Then a large pile of crushed stone tumbled into the hopper car positioned at the discharge port.

Below the discharge port ran a track with a series of hopper cars connected nose to tail, stopped beneath the discharge port. They were connected by cable to a winch driven by a steam engine. After one car was filled, the operator started the machine to pull the train, allowing the second car to move under the discharge port—and so on until the entire train of hopper cars was full. Then they switched to the second train.

The filled hopper car train was pulled up to the loading station on the slope. Using the height difference, they tipped directly into the ox-cart's cargo bed and hauled away. The entire process minimized the need for manual loading and unloading.

Zhan Wuya calculated that for crushing construction-grade gravel alone, the crusher could process approximately fifty tons of crushed stone per day. If this work were performed by hand, three or four hundred workers would be required at minimum.

But now, including the boiler maintenance workers and crane operators, one shift required only twenty workers. The difference in labor efficiency could only be described as earth-shaking.

For the local people, however, this rumbling stone crusher represented terrifying power. If it could reduce such hard boulders to powder, what could these Australians not accomplish?

But the amazement did not end there. After the crusher was proven workable on the first day, over the following half month, the Nanbao Ore Processing Plant installed three more crushers in succession. This had an almost devastating effect on the locals.

The result was that the Crossing Group's work in the area proceeded with remarkable smoothness. Local gentry and common folk practically obeyed their every word. And many people who had not previously been interested in becoming mine workers now came seeking odd jobs. Even landlord and gentry households sent household slaves or collateral nephews to work—all to establish connections with the Mining Office.

With sufficient crushed stone, the transportation department's road hardening work progressed rapidly. Shan Daoqian used crushed stone for the roadbed to increase its load-bearing capacity, then applied coal slag and fine sand for road surface leveling on top. After several rounds of compacting, the road became smooth as new—even superior in quality to some low-grade rural roads elsewhere.

Besides the construction machinery roller, Shan Daoqian also cooperated with the machine factory and vehicle factory to develop animal-drawn road rollers. These were simple—just a giant stone roller with animal harness. Slightly more complex were animal-drawn road graders, water sprinklers, and paving machines. Currently, all could be pulled by horses, oxen, or human power. This specialized equipment not only reduced wear on construction machinery but, being self-producible, was not nearly so precious. The Transportation Bureau ordered several sets at once, deploying them simultaneously on multiple road sections.

Shan Daoqian applied to Wu De for several dozen worker positions, established the Road Maintenance Engineering Office, built maintenance stations along the routes, and formulated rules for regular, scheduled inspection, maintenance, and upkeep of the highways.

"There's another matter—we need to establish traffic rules," Shan Daoqian said, approaching Wu De.

Originally, Lingao required no traffic rules. Apart from pedestrians, there were at most a few sedan chairs and a few wheelbarrows, with an occasional horse passing through. Even if the dirt roads were narrow and uneven, traffic accidents were virtually unknown. But now circumstances had changed. The Crossing Group's arrival had greatly increased the complexity of road conditions. Besides the ever-increasing pedestrian traffic, there were ox-carts, livestock, bicycles, automobiles, and motorcycles. Road construction had also introduced new issues—intersections and bridges, all requiring some degree of control. There had already been several traffic accidents recently.

"Let the police handle it," Wu De said. "Dongmen Chuiyu is just the man for this."

Dongmen Chuiyu, having long managed the East Gate Market, already possessed some experience with such matters. He said: "I don't believe we need overly complicated traffic regulations for now. First, common folk will not remember them, and publicizing them will prove difficult. Second, we lack sufficient manpower for on-site investigations and enforcement."

When Liu Bang entered Guanzhong, he had established only three simple laws. Though from a legal studies perspective this represented a major regression, it was easy for the masses to understand and accept during the founding stage.

Dongmen Chuiyu established the basic principles: "Keep right, pass on the left, separate lanes for fast and slow."

According to the rules, pedestrians, sedan chairs, and livestock used the slow lane. Horse-drawn carts, ox-carts, and motor vehicles used the fast lane—logically speaking, motor vehicle speed differed vastly from ox-carts, but motor vehicles rarely traveled the roads lately, so this would not cause traffic chaos.

Herds of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, were not permitted on the road and could only walk below the roadbed. Large herds on the road could easily cause traffic jams.

Shan Daoqian added: "However, motor vehicles should avoid honking horns to prevent startling the livestock. And expecting heavy ox-carts on the road to yield is absolutely wishful thinking. Just pass them yourself."

"There need to be some penalties. Pedestrians should walk on the roadside. What if someone simply insists on walking in the middle?" Dugu Qiuhun asked.

"Fines won't work," Dongmen Chuiyu said, resting his chin in thought. "First, implement the concept of 'hit and die with no liability.' For injuries, deaths, and property damage caused by traffic violations, no compensation will be given—"

"Wait, that's not the main point," Shan Daoqian interrupted. "I agree with what you're saying, but right now we first need to discuss general minor violations. Given our current authority, even if we actually hit and killed a few commoners, no one would dare seek an explanation."

"Send them to the reform labor team!" Dugu Qiuhun offered this method.

"That would also increase the labor force." Dongmen Chuiyu thought it viable. After all, minor violations these days were all compensated with labor, from three days to three months.

Shan Daoqian said: "I propose this: anyone caught violating traffic rules gets assigned to our Transportation Bureau."

The Transportation Bureau had numerous projects and matters to attend to, and free labor was always welcome. Not only could they build bridges and roads, but violators could also be used to direct traffic.
