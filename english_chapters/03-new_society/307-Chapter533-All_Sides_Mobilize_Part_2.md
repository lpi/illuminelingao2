# Chapter 533 - All Sides Mobilize (Part 2)

Among the civilian officers, those like Pan Da and You Laohu—who either possessed specialized skills, or were crack shots, or excelled at close combat, fierce and willing to kill—still held respectable standing in the Army. Others, though their zeal for military affairs had landed them company-commander positions, had little voice within the service. Only Wei Aiwen, thanks to the theatrical prowess he had displayed early on, had used "political work" as his magic wand to climb to the head of the Political Department—the highest-ranked of the lot. Zhang Bolin, leveraging his fanaticism for artillery (the Army's guns were still muzzle-loaders at this stage, which limited the usefulness of a modern artillerist like Ying Yu), had doggedly studied forward-loading cannon operation, drill, and tactical employment under Lin Shenhe, thus carving out a place for himself in the Army's artillery branch.

These two naturally became the heads of the Young Officers' Club. Because of their ages, the club was later nicknamed the "Class of '80 Party." The Class of '80 was ambitious: by and large, they fit the four criteria of "fiery youth, gleaming boots, young officers, and glittering bayonets." Their heads swam with visions of the German counterattack at Kharkov, "Spring Awakening," each dreaming of wearing the Oak Leaves with Swords to the Knight's Cross, in gleaming riding boots and impeccable breeches, standing atop a King Tiger tank commanding legions to advance.

Reality was different: they wore featureless, minimalist gray cotton uniforms; their cloth shoulder boards drooped limply; their Sam Browne belts—unless they had brought their own, like Wei Aiwen—were locally made, not only homely but reeking of animal hide when wet. Their uniforms bore no decorations; a few who had fought in the defense of Bopu were entitled to sleeve stripes.

Day-to-day life meant endless drilling—no tanks, no Blitzkrieg. Every morning, the first task after rising was to take their companies to the parade ground. Before that, they had already been drilled themselves by former PLA veterans at the Training Cadre. Then bespectacled history enthusiasts, armed with wall charts, would lecture all Army officers on how nineteenth-century armies had conducted "firing by ranks," along with basic tactics and battle formations. On these subjects, everyone started from zero—whether former professional soldier or twenty-first-century glasses-wearing bookworm—but results after training showed that professional standards were hard to surpass: companies led by veterans invariably outperformed those led by the Class of '80.

Transmigrators who had chosen the military path in this new timeline discovered that their martial prowess was just as lamentable here as in the old timeline; their command ability had risen slightly, but displaying any kingly aura was clearly out of the question. Everything the Army needed came with difficulty—soldiers' clothes, shoes, weapons, ammunition—all depended on the Planning Commission's packed schedule. Every rifle, every cannon had to be fought for; training ammunition was counted and conserved; ration distribution was calculated down to each man's allotted fish.

The soldiers seemed clumsy; hands that had gripped hoes did not adapt to weapons overnight, and becoming a qualified soldier was a long road. A simple "eyes right" drill could take a whole day to teach. After a day of drilling on the parade ground—voice hoarse, throat parched, arms aching from all the corrective slaps—their companies still could not march a basic formation.

After drill came barracks inspections and heart-to-heart talks with the men. Then, every week without fail, the five-kilometer route march; every month, "support for construction"—the Executive Committee's logic echoing that of socialist nations and the Romans: soldiers participating in public works not only made efficient use of labor but also built physical endurance.

The Army they had toiled to build amounted to only a regiment; they themselves were mere company commanders. And the Army received little attention. All this was a far cry from their grand dreams of becoming "generals at twenty" commanding vast armies.

Reality had educated the Class of '80: a powerful army had to be built with one's own hands, not conjured by bootlegging "inventions" of one or two new weapons and teaching the troops a handful of new tactics to become invincible.

And so the militarist ideals of the Class of '80 crumbled, and the Young Officers' Club was born.

The Club's credo was to build an unprecedented grand army: in scale like the Soviet Army, in equipment and uniforms like the WWII Wehrmacht, in logistics and firepower like the U.S. Army.

But the transmigrated collective's Hainan base and the strategic situation it faced had led the Executive Committee and the military to adopt a Navy-centric force-building philosophy. The Army's scale was compressed to a level just sufficient to control the county and defend the base. Including the Training Cadre and auxiliary units, the Army numbered no more than three thousand.

Such a small force created problems analogous to the Weimar Republic's Reichswehr: few officer billets, especially at senior levels. Promotions and rank advances were painfully slow. The Navy already had indigenous captains and naval lieutenants; the Army still had not produced a single indigenous captain at company level. This grated on the Class of '80. Indigenous personnel already had naval lieutenants on par with themselves; if indigenous naval officers later reached lieutenant commander, wouldn't they in rank actually outrank Army officers?

Wei Aiwen spoke passionately from the podium: "…Our environment is fraught with peril. On land, we face the Great Ming and the Jiannu; at sea, Zheng Zhilong, Liu Xiang, and all manner of foreign brigands. And what is the state of our Army?" He struck a pained expression. "A measly dozen-odd companies, not a single horse allocated to the establishment! Artillery hauled by men, ammunition carried on backs, not even the shadow of a machine gun!" He paused for breath. "The Executive Committee often says the military must exercise patience for the sake of economic construction. We have exercised patience—without a word of complaint."

Growing more agitated as he spoke, he continued, "Although obeying orders and following commands is a soldier's basic principle, I must solemnly state this view here: certain individuals on the Executive Committee have allowed their personal bias toward the Navy to create a reality in which naval development far outstrips that of the Army."

He enumerated the evidence: "Since the Typewriter went into production, the Army has not received a single one—yet the Navy? Even special-duty boats and transports without official ship names have them! Look at the number of cannons: to this day, the largest and best heavy guns produced have all gone to the Navy. Even in sheer quantity, the total projectile weight of the Navy's few transports in a single volley exceeds that of our entire Army artillery! Comrades—is this normal?!"

"It is not!" Zhang Bolin shouted loudest of all. The magnificent sight of naval warships under full sail conducting salvo drills had cut him to the quick—by comparison, his own 12-pounder dragged to the range by "substitute beast soldiers" looked wretchedly shabby.

"Comrades, who advances under fire and plants the victory banner on the enemy's bastion? Who, in the hour of crisis, defends the regime with bayonets? The Army—only the Army!" Wei Aiwen swept an arm out and tilted his head aside. "Let the Navy try sending a battleship to stand guard at Bairen Fortress!"

"Long live the Army!" came the shout from below, boots stamping hard on the floor.

"Comrades, history tells us: navies are often unreliable. Who stabbed the Second Reich treacherously in the back? The pampered sailors at Kiel Harbor! Who, when the Russian Empire was teetering, fired the fatal opening shot? The sailors of the *Aurora*!" Wei Aiwen's agitational skills had matured since becoming Political Department head. "The Army soldiers who fought four years in the muddy trenches, bleeding and dying, were betrayed just like that!"

So fervent was his delivery that he seemed to be the imagined betrayed German soldier himself. The mood infected the sparse audience, and one after another they joined the shouting.

"The Army's scale must be expanded! Armaments must be strengthened!" He swung his arm down emphatically. "We have exercised patience for economic construction far too long. Now the Army must make its voice heard!"

…

Qian Duo was on the late-night watch at the Training Cadre—he was a roving sentry. After his first patrol, he reported nervously to the duty officer, You Laohu: the conference room at Training Cadre headquarters still had people inside; though the doors and windows were shut tight, he could hear commotion and singing.

"It's nothing," You Laohu said nonchalantly. "Director Wei got drunk. They get together once a month to drink; they drink too much, get high, and talk nonsense. Ignore them."

After Qian Duo left, You Laohu considered whether to log the report in the watch journal. Sentry reports were supposed to be recorded by regulation. But then again, Wei Aiwen's use of the conference room was already on record, and their entry and exit from the Training Cadre compound was logged as well; there was no need for him to be redundant. You Laohu looked down on the group's hush-hush theatrics but had no desire to spread word of it. They were all comrades-in-arms; some solidarity was in order.

Evening vespers had just concluded. Wu Shimang, dressed in a black robe with a silver cross around his neck, walked slowly out of the church with the dignified gait befitting a respected clergyman. At the door, the parishioners who had just finished vespers bowed to him; some even kissed his hand. He smiled warmly, made the sign of the cross over them, and crossed a stretch of wasteland—land the Church had recently purchased for future expansion. Wu Shimang had advised Lu Ruohua to buy extra land early, lest future prices become unpredictable.

"The land already cost me two hundred piastres. How much higher could prices go?" Lu Ruohua was unconvinced; the land price already rankled him.
