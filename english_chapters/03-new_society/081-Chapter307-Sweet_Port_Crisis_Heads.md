# Chapter 307: Sweet Port Turbulence — Heads

Master Zhu invariably slept in the courtyard adjoining his study. This wasn't because he loathed his wife—she had passed away years before—but rather for the convenience of managing his affairs. He remained in his study until very late each day. Checking accounts, composing letters to out-of-town clients and branch staff, and reading correspondence constituted his principal daily occupations. He was especially meticulous about personally verifying the accounts submitted by shopkeepers, scrutinizing them for any omissions or, worse, embezzlement.

As an employer, Master Zhu could scarcely be called generous. Providing his staff with food and a modest stipend for clothing and bathing was deemed sufficient; consequently, most of his employees hailed from the poorest districts of Guangdong—people who would labor for little more than their daily meals. As for how their families survived or how they might eventually support wives and children, such matters never concerned him.

Consequently, mischief among the staff occurred from time to time. Unfortunately for the miscreants, no one could match Master Zhu's shrewdness. No matter how artfully the accounts were doctored, he invariably found the threads of deceit. Furthermore, he was an expert judge of expression; if a shopkeeper's demeanor aroused suspicion, that man would soon find himself packing his bags. For decades, no one had ever succeeded in taking advantage of him.

This morning, Master Zhu woke early as was his custom. Rising at dawn was an ingrained habit, particularly since the struggle with the South China factory was raging, rendering his sleep fitful. To guard against extreme measures from the "Australians," he had doubled the night watchmen and guards stationed around the mansion.

As he stirred, the concubine sleeping beside him woke as well. Having a woman at his side served less for carnal pleasure and more for the convenience of being attended to at night and in the morning. Unlike other wealthy men who lusted after beauty and maintained numerous maids and concubines, Master Zhu often remarked: "Women are a burden—both physically and financially."

Today, Qiuhan was attending him. Thanks to Gu Dachun, Qiuhan's status within the household had risen, so the "privilege" of serving the master fell to her with increasing frequency.

Qiuhan rose quickly, dressed, and hurriedly washed in the outer room. When she returned to the bedroom, she was neatly groomed. She spoke softly: "Master, won't you sleep a while longer?"

"No more sleep!"

This exchange was a daily constant.

Qiuhan retrieved a thin lined jacket and draped it over his shoulders, helped him sit on the edge of the bed, and put on his socks, leggings, and shoes. Then she assisted him in standing, tied his sash, and helped him into his long gown. Next came combing his hair and arranging it in a bun.

Suddenly, a scream rang out from outside, followed by the clatter of a copper basin striking the ground. Master Zhu frowned. Qiuhan hastily set down the comb and went to investigate.

Moments later, Qiuhan returned, her face stricken with panic.

"Master! Under the eaves of the study... there are many boxes!"

"Boxes?" Master Zhu didn't immediately comprehend, but something was clearly amiss. He strode out of the bedroom and discovered eleven wooden boxes arranged neatly beneath the eaves of his study.

His heart constricted instantly. Master Zhu remembered with certainty that these objects hadn't been present the previous night. Where had they come from?

"Open them!" At his command, a servant who had arrived stepped forward and lifted the lid of one box. The servant suddenly shuddered violently, nearly flinging the lid away. He set it down swiftly, his voice trembling:

"Master, it's a human head!"

Screams erupted from the women gathered outside.

"What is this shrieking? Get out here!" Master Zhu waved his hand impatiently and approached the boxes himself.

Inside lay a complete human head preserved in lime. The bloodstains were fresh; it must have been severed recently. Master Zhu had never seen this man before. *What does this signify?* He was perplexed.

The boxes were opened one after another. All contained heads. Suddenly, his heart nearly seized. He unmistakably recognized the half-charred head of Qiuhan's brother—Gu Dachun—eyes half-closed.

He turned to Qiuhan, who was shrinking away. "Come here and look!"

"Your servant dares not—"

"Come here!" he roared impatiently.

Qiuhan fainted the instant she beheld her brother's head. After being revived, she crawled to Master Zhu's feet, weeping and imploring him to avenge her brother.

As for the remaining heads, Qiuhan identified them one by one. They were all key members of the Gu family pirate gang, all connected by blood in some fashion.

Qiuhan fainted from weeping again, but Master Zhu had no mind to attend to her. He was enveloped in a bone-chilling cold. He collapsed into the chair in his study, unable to stand for a long time.

The appearance of all these heads here meant one thing: the Gu family pirates had been annihilated. But that was secondary. Who could, in a single night, silently evade the night watchmen and guards to place eleven boxes of heads neatly beneath his study eaves?

This cold, precise action demonstrated the mastermind's absolute confidence. They regarded his guards as nothing whatsoever. Moreover, they knew his every movement perfectly. They had struck in the dead of night, quietly bypassing all security to accurately locate one specific courtyard among many in the darkness. This reality alone was sufficient to make him shudder.

This was a ruthless and pragmatic threat—a warning: the South China factory was not without means to deal with him. And he had exhausted his options.

***

On the same day Beiwei led his men to deliver "gifts" to Zhu An, Wen Tong initiated his move against the Haiyi Guild's merchant houses. Liao Daxing, bearing gifts and trailed by attendants, visited the sugar firms on Hai'an Street one by one, presenting six-item gift baskets.

This marked South China Sugar's first public appearance on Hai'an Street. Although most owners politely declined via servants claiming "the master is out" when Liao Daxing's card was presented, none refused the gifts. A few received him, exchanging pleasantries before seeing him out.

This probe confirmed Chen Tianxiong and the others' assessment: the attitude of most Haiyi Guild merchants had softened. Once news of Gu Dachun's annihilation at sea became widely known, Master Zhu's prestige on Hai'an Street would plummet. The Haiyi Guild sugar firms would shift their stance within days.

The tale of the eleven heads at the Zhu residence spread through every teahouse in Xuwen. Storytellers embellished it vividly, and listeners devoured it with relish. Although the Haiyi Guild cautioned the teahouses on Hai'an Street against permitting guests to spread such rumors, the Haiyi Guild wasn't the government. People spoke, and those willing listened.

A heavy, tense atmosphere pervaded Hai'an Street. In stark contrast, owners, shopkeepers, and stewards of various sugar firms were feasting, attending plays, and drinking with courtesans daily. In these settings, they conferred urgently in whispers, exchanging opinions.

The backbone of the Haiyi Guild, Master Zhu, was rarely glimpsed at these gatherings. He was "ill." As for the nature of his illness, the Zhu household maintained strict silence. Even had he not been "ill," he could scarcely have wielded his former persuasive authority. Their unity had crumbled! Everyone in the Haiyi Guild recognized this: two-thirds of the crushing season had elapsed, yet their sugar warehouses remained empty. The South China factory displayed no signs of collapse; their ships continued entering and departing Hai'an Harbor, shipping sugar ceaselessly. With the number of farmers selling sugar steadily dwindling, everyone grew panicked. The consensus prompted action: this deadlock could not persist.

"Report, Master," Wen Qing bowed to Chen Tianxiong and Wen Tong, who were engaged in their customary "after-dinner chess game." "Someone is asking to see you. Boss Zhu of the Dachang Rice Shop brought him. Shall we receive him?"

Chen Tianxiong was contemplating his move, hesitating with a "Horse" piece in hand.

"Who is it? Didn't you inquire?"

"He claims to be from the Haiyi Guild—"

"Should we see him?" Wen Tong asked.

"No reason not to. Show him in."

Zhou Shizhai, watching in silence, spoke up: "Exercise caution. It's after dark. In case..."

"Rest assured," Chen Tianxiong replied. "Master Zhu lacks the nerve for a 'dagger concealed in a map' assassination." He smiled. "Besides, with you here, brother, what have we to fear?"

The visitor wore traveling clothes and a bamboo hat, seemingly attempting to obscure his face. When he removed the hat, Chen Tianxiong nodded in recognition.

"Boss Feng, a nocturnal visit. What instruction do you bring for us?"

"I wouldn't presume!" The visitor was Feng Guangfeng, proprietor of "Richangji." Hearing this stranger address him by name, he was momentarily startled. "Indeed, I am Feng Guangfeng." He bowed with hands clasped. "Is this Manager Wen?"

"This is Manager Wen. I am merely a humble clerk," Chen Tianxiong said.

Greetings were exchanged. Chen Tianxiong preferred that the visitor not remember him too distinctly, so he withheld his name and deliberately positioned himself in the shadows.

"Two managers!" Feng Guangfeng spoke earnestly. "This misunderstanding between the South China factory and the Haiyi Guild... The Haiyi Guild has caused you great offense. I have come specifically to offer apologies."

Wen Tong responded, "The sugar business is ultimately one family, regardless of north, south, east, or west. We hope for your guidance and care in the future, brother."

"You are too gracious," Feng Guangfeng said. "I have come this time..."

"One moment," Chen Tianxiong interjected. "Is Boss Feng here representing 'Richangji' or the 'Haiyi Guild'?"

The distinction was significant. Feng Guangfeng dared not respond carelessly. After a pause, he declared, "Naturally, the Haiyi Guild!"

"So the Haiyi Guild is aware you are here?"

"Not everyone—" Feng Guangfeng hastened to clarify. "However, most members of the Haiyi Guild, high and low, would be pleased to see me here."
