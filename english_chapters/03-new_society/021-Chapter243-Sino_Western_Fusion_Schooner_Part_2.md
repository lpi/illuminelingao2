# Chapter 243: The Hybrid Schooner (Part 2)

Regarding armaments, a barbette was installed at both bow and stern, each mounting a 70mm rifled gun. Above each barbette stood a retractable canvas frame for protecting the cannon when not in use—the same structure installed on fishing boats by Lin Shenhe's artillery trial group. The sole improvement was that the naval gun carriage's recoil system had been changed from the original block and tackle to a rail-mounted recoil-absorbing carriage. The gun carriage was installed on rails where wheels could slide. When firing, recoil was counteracted by sliding backwards along the rails. At the rails' end, hardwood buffer blocks utilized rebound force from the wheel collision to return the cannon to position—steel wasn't used to prevent sparks. With more advanced mechanical capabilities, Lin Shenhe could have introduced more complex gear, roller, and hydraulic systems for better buffering—on warships, weight and volume restrictions for solving gun recoil were much looser than in the field.

This system had undergone preliminary testing at Lingao Cape fort and was deemed adequate. Installation on Ship Zero also served as a sea trial.

The gun emplacement was rotatable, manually pushed from below deck. A speaking tube facilitated directing rotation angles. The 90-degree angle toward the deck was mechanically limited—preventing enemy use if the cannon were captured, and preventing accidental friendly fire.

Though barbette protection wasn't perfect, no contemporary cannon could exceed the 70mm rifled gun's range. The gun shield was made of riveted rolled iron plates, impressively protective by the era's standards. Wen Desi and the navy group had initially wanted to lay rolled wrought iron armor plates on Ship Zero's deck—creating the first protected cruiser with a turtleback deck. After calculating required quantities, Wen Desi abandoned the idea. Only an armor belt around the ammunition room was installed as a safety measure.

For auxiliary weapons, Li Yunxing had proposed multi-barrel volley guns, but these were cumbersome and slow to load. Following Lin Shenhe's suggestion, mature technology was used instead: six 2-pounder light mortars—one on each side, one at bow and stern, with two on mast-top platforms. These compact cannons mounted on freely rotating gimbals could rotate 360 degrees, elevate to 80 degrees and depress to 40 degrees. They fired iron sand, scrap iron, and canister shot totaling under one kilogram. With short range—similar to a modern 12.7mm heavy machine gun—they were designed to kill at close range: shredding enemy rigging and deck sailors, and when necessary, sweeping away boarding parties. Of course, the Transmigration Navy's guiding philosophy was engaging from maximum distance rather than exhausting close-range broadside slugfests.

Since Ship Zero wasn't prepared for full broadside batteries, its below-deck space was considerably larger, greatly improving endurance and cargo capacity. Crew living conditions far exceeded ordinary sailing warships: more cabins, sanitary facilities, better lighting and ventilation. Wen Desi even prepared retractable hammocks for ordinary sailors. To transmigrators, these were merely bare minimums. Wen Desi understood his group's weaknesses: plenty of courage and ambition, but limited tolerance for hardship. Without proper food, drink, and sleep, expecting them to undertake long-distance adventures was fantasy.

Regarding rigging, the shipbuilding team decided to temporarily use Chinese-style hard sails (junk rig). Hard sails suited the transmigrators' current capabilities, as they hadn't mastered soft sail technology. Sewing complex sails was a specialized technique requiring specific tools and huge space. Not only was this technique unknown in China—even Macau might lack sailmakers. The Planning Committee warehouse had no sail canvas and would require imports, with Macau's availability uncertain.

Chinese-style hard sail manufacturing requirements were much lower. Hard sails were flat panels; soft sails and jibs were complex curved surfaces requiring professional sewing. Soft sails required specially made canvas; hard sails, with supporting battens, had no stringent material requirements—ordinary cloth, grass mats, or reed screens could substitute. Even if slightly damaged, they could continue operating, and temporary repairs were conveniently easy.

Hard sails had high wind efficiency. Acting like airplane wings, they utilized wind from "eight directions." When struck by crosswinds, the lift vector roughly aligned with sailing direction, providing high efficiency. Even oblique headwinds allowed zigzag progress. Sheets tied to one side allowed angle adjustment. The ability to quickly raise and lower sails and tackle crosswinds made hard sails convenient, though raw speed was slower than soft sails.

Operation was convenient too. Without complex running rigging, ordinary people needed almost no training to set and furl sails. Furling was extremely fast—cutting the main halyard brought sails crashing down in seconds. Raising was slower and more laborious due to batten weight, but required no special skills. Hard sails needed minimal adjustment during navigation, saving manpower.

Though soft sails were the trend for large oceanic vessels, Ship Zero's missions would merely circle coastal areas—going south to the Philippines or north to Japan. Chinese hard sails suited the complex sea conditions and changeable winds of the continental littoral.

"We'll use hard sails as a substitute for now, switching when we have manufacturing capabilities," Wen Desi said. Reality dictated the choice—soft sail rigging also required much higher sailor skills. Ship Zero needed immediate deployment.

"We'll use steam engines in the future—why need sailing ships?" Li Di asked.

Wen Desi shook his head. "For at least twenty years, large sailing ships will remain our ocean transport backbone—they don't need fuel. Steamships lack advantages for bulk cargo; they're inefficient and coal-hungry. Long-range voyages require overseas coaling stations. As for producing steam turbines—that depends on how fast we climb the tech tree."

Sailing ships actually remained in use until the 1950s before being eliminated by world shipping markets. Before that, they remained the best vehicles for long-distance bulk cargo transport.

"I really want to pilot our ironclad soon," Le Lin said. The naval enthusiast spent all free time at the shipyard despite not understanding shipbuilding technology.

"Actually, it's not that difficult. Iron-hulled ships are easier to build than wooden ones," Wen Desi said. "With sufficient materials and trained workers, building thousand-ton iron-hulled ships is straightforward."

"CEO Wen, should we build another 70-ton class soft-sail rigged ship as a training ship?"

The speaker was Ming Qiu of the Maritime Department, serving as naval advisor. Honestly, after modern warships, seeing the Navy's vessel turning out as a sailing ship felt strange—especially those odd gun emplacements Ming Qiu vaguely recalled from late Qing Dynasty forts. Though reality was disjointed from experience, the basic idea of building a navy remained consistent: people were always the most critical component. Training sufficient sailors was pressing. Ming Qiu had seen a visiting South Sea Fleet training ship and felt the method excellent.

"That makes sense. I'll discuss with the Executive Committee for materials allocation to start a training ship—but this requires Foreign Trade Company support." Actually, Ma Qianzhu had already sent people to Macau to see if relevant materials and artisans could be collected.

Just then, a European sloop with a long bowsprit like a swordfish, hanging a long row of sails, was sailing crookedly in the waters outside the shipyard. The sails hung disorderly, with people crawling on them; faint shouts drifted over on the sea breeze.

"Whose boat is that?" Wen Desi was startled.

"Li Huamei's *Hangzhou*," Chen Haiyang reported. "We reported to the Executive Committee last time—she's teaching sail and rigging handling techniques."

"She seems very active." Wen Desi said thoughtfully. "Didn't Meng De report she wasn't willing to instruct?"

"She refused formal instruction. This isn't strictly teaching—seems to be recreation."

"Using this for recreation is quite unique." Wen Desi was filled with distrust.

After Li Huamei arrived in Lingao, the Executive Committee had doubts about her intentions, so they hadn't decided how to treat her—only sending Foreign Affairs Ministry personnel to provide hospitality. Bored in port, Li Huamei naturally established relations with Bopu's naval personnel. Relying on her reputation, beauty, straightforward temperament, and fast ship, she quickly won over most of the navy crowd—except for a few former PLA officers who maintained revolutionary vigilance. They often took her boat for spins, calling it "learning ship handling." Li Huamei was generous, teaching experience and occasionally performing ship handling techniques. Her prestige soared; she won numerous fans. Every expanded Executive Committee meeting, someone would put in good words for her. This made the committee keenly feel the powerful charm of a woman.
