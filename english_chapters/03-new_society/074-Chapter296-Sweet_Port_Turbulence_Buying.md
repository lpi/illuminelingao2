# Chapter 296: Sweet Port Turbulence — Buying Off

Seeing this ancient "worker leader" turn ashen-faced, Chen Tianxiong felt a surge of disdain. He had thought the man could at least mobilize a few hundred workers and counted for something, but he hadn't expected such a pathetic display. Xiao Zhanfeng's description of him as "all bark and no backbone" was spot-on.

"Stand up and speak," Chen Tianxiong said with a hint of disgust. "South China Sugar understands the suffering of you sugar mill workers. That's why my boss sent me to make friends with you, so we don't damage our friendly relations."

Hearing that they wouldn't take his life, Lin Zhuang finally recovered his wits. Carefully parsing Master Chen's words, the matter seemed still open for discussion. He answered carefully: "Your Honor sees clearly! We sugar mill workers have always lived hand to mouth, barely keeping heads above water. Now that everyone's income is cut off, and many have families to support, life is truly difficult. To make ends meet, we had no choice but to accept Third Master Zhu's silver. We harbor nothing against South China Sugar..."

He was shrewd enough not to mention that South China had forced sugar mills to close and caused workers' unemployment, lest he anger his counterpart.

Chen Tianxiong remained silent, watching how he would continue.

"As for rumors that sugar mill workers are going to cause trouble at South China—absolutely untrue. I stake my reputation on it."

"So the widespread rumors about sugar mill masters burning incense and swearing oaths to attack South China are false?"

"There are plans to burn incense, yes." Lin Zhuang knew this couldn't be denied. "But it's not as rumors say! It's just to help everyone stick together through hard times—not specifically targeting South China."

These remarks barely held together, but Chen Tianxiong had no intention of debating right or wrong—there was no right or wrong in this matter anyway.

"That so many sugar mill workers have fallen to this state—South China acknowledges some responsibility. My boss often sighs about this, saying he let everyone down! To remedy this, my boss is now willing to hire everyone into the factory. As long as they can work, regardless of sex, age, or infirmity, they'll receive wages. Since you're the leader, I'll make the decision for him: after the matter is done, I'll give you a separate bonus. What do you say?"

These words were clear enough. Though Lin Zhuang still felt suddenly overwhelmed, the meaning was plain: South China was willing to employ all unemployed sugar boilers. For everyone, this was enormous benefit—at least several hundred people's livelihoods would be guaranteed, and he could justify himself to them.

But while good for everyone, it wasn't necessarily good for him. Once everyone entered the factory, what use would he, the leader, be? His current benefits would vanish. Besides, he had taken over two hundred taels from Third Master Zhu. Now, without doing what he'd promised and defecting to South China instead—wouldn't that make him a standard "turncoat"? South China was not to be trifled with, and neither was Third Master Zhu.

He couldn't help hesitating, not daring to agree.

"You have concerns?" Chen Tianxiong saw his expression shifting and knew his thoughts. He didn't press, letting him state his own terms.

"Master Chen, Your Honor sees clearly! This is naturally a huge blessing for our sugar mill workers. But Third Master Zhu has been warm-hearted these past two months. I'm afraid if I go back and say this, not everyone will listen to me..."

Chen Tianxiong laughed loudly. "What a joke. Refusing South China's white rice to eat the Haiyi Guild's moldy leftovers? Is there truly such a loyal person?"

Lin Zhuang had bitter words he couldn't speak. The silver Third Master Zhu allocated might have bought everyone white rice, but since he had pocketed more than half, he could only buy the cheapest moldy stale rice. When workers complained, he blamed the Haiyi Guild for giving too little. Thus, Third Master Zhu's standing among workers wasn't necessarily high.

Now if he told everyone, most would be willing to go to South China. Then there would be no explaining things to Third Master Zhu. Even if Third Master Zhu didn't make him suffer directly, demanding he return all the silver would force him to death.

Lin Zhuang looked helplessly at Zhou Shizhai, then at Chen Tianxiong, unable to answer.

Just as he hesitated in silence, his eyes suddenly lit up—Chen Tianxiong placed a small chest on the table and lifted the lid. Inside were rows of neatly stacked silver dollars, brand new and gleaming. In addition, there was a pile of broken silver and a few medium ingots—estimated around a hundred taels. This was clearly prepared for him.

"This is five hundred 'Double Pillar' silver dollars," Chen Tianxiong said. "Converted, nearly four hundred taels. Consider it a settling-in allowance from South China for the unemployed workers, to be distributed once recruitment succeeds. Additionally, another hundred taels is a personal gift to you."

Speaking a number was one thing; having solid silver before one's eyes was another matter entirely. Chen Tianxiong knew nothing moved hearts like real gold delivered in person. These silver dollars were specially prepared for this purpose. He was very patient, letting Lin Zhuang think all he wanted.

"There's no need to force anything," Chen Tianxiong said. "If you have difficulties, speak frankly."

"Oh... yes, yes..." Lin Zhuang snapped out of his reverie.

He had spent time in the underworld, after all. In a flash, he conceived another approach.

"Master Chen!" He put on an extremely sincere expression. "Please understand! Since the sugar mill workers entrusted me, I must find them a proper way out. Now that South China is willing to employ them—endless gratitude! I thank the honorable boss on their behalf!" He bowed deeply, then changed the subject. "It's just that I, the middleman, have difficulties. To speak honestly—there must also be an explanation for Third Master Zhu's side. Otherwise, if I damage his face, a lowly fire stoker like me cannot bear the responsibility!"

"What difficulties? Just say them!" Chen Tianxiong figured he was angling for more personal benefits.

"I only beg the honorable boss to understand," he said. "Please allow the incense-burning and oath-swearing at Zou Monk Temple tomorrow to proceed as scheduled..."

"Oh? And then?" Chen Tianxiong remained noncommittal.

"Burning incense is just going through motions to stall Third Master Zhu and avoid his badgering—a delaying tactic. I will then talk it over with the workers. When the time is ripe, I'll send word. At that time, the honorable boss just needs to dispatch capable people to recruit directly. It's just—" he whispered, "I won't be able to stay in Xuwen afterward. I must ask for some travel expenses..."

This speech sounded comprehensive. In reality, it was still playing both sides. His calculation: use incense-burning to stall the Haiyi Guild; take South China's money and make empty promises; then leak rumors to Third Master Zhu that South China was attempting to "co-opt" unemployed workers. Third Master Zhu would naturally have to pay more to keep things under control. Though the truth would eventually surface, he could muddle through for a while. If it really didn't work, he would simply pack and leave.

This scheme naturally couldn't deceive Chen Tianxiong.

"Burning incense and swearing oaths is absolutely not allowed." Chen Tianxiong vetoed it immediately. Though merely a ceremony, it was a clear declaration of hostility toward South China. Afterward, using force would look like bullying; using soft tactics would look undignified—extremely passive either way.

"If it's not allowed, I really can't explain it to Third Master Zhu. I beg the honorable boss to understand and grant me a way to live!"

Chen Tianxiong snorted. "Master Lin! I advise you to think clearly. Don't think you can play both sides." He sneered. "My boss sees the unemployed workers are pitiful and wants to give them a way out. Since you're unwilling... if you want to take people to burn incense and swear oaths, go ahead. South China won't stop you."

Lin Zhuang grew greatly anxious. If Chen Tianxiong stormed off, the matter was irretrievable. Once fighting started, he would become a sacrificial pawn for the Haiyi Guild. Whether Third Master Zhu would protect him afterward—regardless of who won or lost—depended entirely on that man's conscience.

"Wait—let's discuss this!"

"Discussion doesn't matter." Chen Tianxiong suddenly laughed, closing the silver chest. "I know you're a man of the world, so I'll speak plainly. I just want one word from you: yes, or no?"

The gleaming silver dollars were practically put away. It seemed that with just one word, the matter would be dropped. Giving up such an opportunity felt unbearable. He answered hastily: "I'll think of a way. I'll definitely get this done."

"Good—that's straightforward!" Chen Tianxiong knew he had taken the bait. "My boss said: since we're recruiting, there must be a roster. There will be settling-in allowances upon entering the factory. You'll naturally distribute those; we won't question it. Can you provide a list?"

A roster—he naturally had one. This was Lin Zhuang's meal ticket. Third Master Zhu had seen it initially and, knowing he had hundreds of people to deploy, had been willing to give silver. This Master Chen ostensibly wanted to calculate allowances, but actually wanted to see his strength. This was worth showing off. Besides, payments like wages always meant a twenty-percent handler's cut. Lin Zhuang knew this. He grew excited: "I have it, but there's only one original copy. I'll have to find someone to copy it..."

"No problem. I have a clerk here."

Lin Zhuang took a worn blue cloth bundle from his shirt and opened it carefully. Inside was an old document folder holding a coarse bamboo paper booklet with "United in Heart and Mind" written on it.

"This is the roster—originally made when we sued at the county *yamen*." Lin Zhuang said. "Names were written by a hired scrivener, but everyone pressed a thumbprint behind their own."

The booklet was greasy and filthy. Opening it revealed names listed row by row, each followed by dense red thumbprints, along with the individual's *Du*, *Tu*, and village household registration. Some names had notes of job types like "Sugar Boiling" or "Fire Stoking." It was undoubtedly the genuine roster.

"One hundred seventy-four people in total. About twenty apprentices with nowhere to go aren't in the booklet."

"Wait a moment; I'll have someone copy it." He handed the original to Xiao Zhanfeng next door, instructing immediate copying.

Xiao Zhanfeng carried an ink box and began at once. To avoid sitting in boredom, Chen Tianxiong had someone bring wine and dishes, pulling Lin Zhuang to drink. He worked to appease him while learning much about Third Master Zhu and the Haiyi Guild.

When the wine was finished, the roster was copied. Chen Tianxiong returned the original and said: "Go back and think carefully. The morning after next, I'll await your news!" He pushed a fifty-tael ingot forward. "Take these fifty taels first."

Lin Zhuang was overjoyed but still had to be polite. "There's no such rule!"

"Rules are made by people. My rule: take fifty taels first, so you'll have energy doing things for me."

"Certainly, certainly." Lin Zhuang was already speaking without restraint.

The matter done, there was no need to stay. The three left Aunt Ai's establishment and returned to Dachang Grain Firm. Xiao Zhanfeng asked: "Is what Lin Zhuang said reliable?"

"Naturally not." Chen Tianxiong said. "But I have an ambush waiting. He'll get a nasty shock returning to Zou Monk Temple."

"What if he doesn't go back? You gave him fifty taels—maybe he'll squander it here again."

"This is his critical juncture—wouldn't he have to go back and think things over?" Chen Tianxiong was confident. "I'd wager he's lost all interest in gambling and whoring."

He stopped. "Zhanfeng, I think you shouldn't go home either. Move to South China Sugar. We need a clerk for paperwork. A few taels monthly, and you'll have a place to settle."

"Many thanks." Xiao Zhanfeng politely declined. "However, it's better I maintain free agent status for now. Whatever I say or do will be more convenient."

Chen Tianxiong considered and agreed—the man was thoughtful.

"Take this silver and use it first." Seeing he was truly destitute, though rejected once yesterday, Chen Tianxiong still produced some broken silver. "Consider it a loan from me!"

"No, no." Xiao Zhanfeng shook his head. "It's not that I'm being pretentious! Now is not the time to take your silver! When the time comes for me to speak out, if people say I took your silver, not only will my words carry no weight—everything I said before will be dismissed as hot air!"

"No one knows about this," Chen Tianxiong dismissed the concern.

"Heaven knows, Earth knows, you know, I know—how can you say no one knows!" Xiao Zhanfeng said with conviction. "A true gentleman stands straight and walks upright. If something is true, it's true; if not, it's not."

"Very well—I won't press you." Chen Tianxiong couldn't help feeling genuine admiration for this old intellectual.

"But your current situation—food and clothing are worrying. You can't keep troubling Auntie Liu every day."
