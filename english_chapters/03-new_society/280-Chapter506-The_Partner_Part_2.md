# Chapter 506 - The Partner (Part 2)

Lin Baiguang explained the logistics: a site had already been identified, and the coal was destined for export, not local sale. The Hai family would be silent partners, collecting dividends without the burden of management.

Sensing Lin’s confidence, Hai Shuzu raised no further objections. Though doubts lingered, his precarious situation left no room for hesitation. They drafted the agreement on the spot.

In name, Hai Shuzu would be the principal investor, while Lin’s team handled operations. Accounts would be settled annually.

"Regarding your current debts," Lin added, "I am willing to advance the necessary funds to settle them immediately."

"I will certainly repay you," Hai Shuzu said hastily. His pride stung; he had already accepted so much charity.

"No rush," Lin waved a hand dismissively. "Consider it an advance against your future dividends. We can deduct it from the year-end settlement."

"And the interest?"

"Come now," Lin laughed. "I am a merchant, not a usurer. Let us not speak of interest between friends."

With the letter of intent signed, Lin Baiguang wired his report to the Executive Committee. He requested funds and specialized personnel be dispatched to Qiongshan immediately. Ma Qianzhu, seeing a long-awaited plan finally bearing fruit, promptly authorized five thousand taels for startup costs and ordered the Long-Range Exploration Team to deploy range. They already possessed data on the region's coal deposits; now they needed to pinpoint the extraction sites.

Silver in hand, Lin Baiguang moved quickly. He disbursed funds to Hai Shuzu to settle with the shareholders. The total claims amounted to just over a thousand taels—a manageable sum. The investors were paid in full, and the turmoil at the Hai residence finally ceased.

The servants who had joined the mob were dismissed. After their back wages were cleared, each was given a severance of five taels and shown the door. It was a small price for Hai Shuzu to reclaim his dignity.

Families of the passengers who had perished received condolence payments of five to ten taels. Strictly speaking, the Hai family bore no liability for acts of piracy, but the gesture silenced the wailing at the gates and prevented any pretext for official intervention.

The Hai household viewed Lin Baiguang as a godsend, a savior who had pulled them from the brink of oblivion. Overcome with gratitude, Hai Shuzu proposed they become sworn brothers.

For a scion of the Hai clan to offer such a bond to a grain merchant of unknown lineage was an extraordinary honor. Lin Baiguang accepted readily. He knew that in this era, sworn brotherhood carried profound weight. Effectively, Hai Shuzu had stepped one foot onto the transmigrators' "pirate ship."

The exploration team, dressed in Ming attire that did little to hide their odd mannerisms, set out daily under the escort of loyal Hai servants. They quickly identified several potential mining sites on wasteland.

"The land is cheap," Hai Shuzu reported. "Mostly ownerless scrub. We can file a claim at the yamen and purchase it for a pittance. Existing owners will take a few days to negotiate with."

"No hurry. Just ensure secrecy," Lin cautioned.

"I understand. If word leaks that we're mining, prices will skyrocket." Hai Shuzu hesitated. "There is one thing, Brother Lin..."

"Speak freely."

"I worry about appearances. I was on the verge of ruin, and now suddenly I have cleared my debts and am opening a mine. People will talk. If they suspect illicit dealings..."

Lin Baiguang suppressed a sigh. The man was fastidious to a fault.

"I understand you have a large ship outstanding?" Lin asked.

"Indeed. If not for that ship, I wouldn't be in this mess. Come, drink." The crisis averted, Hai Shuzu’s mood had lifted enough to break out the home-brewed liquor.

Lin Baiguang drained his cup to show sincerity. The liquor was rustic but mellow.

Hai Shuzu recounted the saga of his lost ship. Lin listened patiently, feigning contemplation. "So, the ship is with the Australians in Lingao?"

"Yes. They invited me to retrieve it. I wanted to go—perhaps recoup some losses—but my family feared for my safety." Hai Shuzu smiled bitterly.

"I have heard of these Australians in Guangzhou. They are strange, yes, but they are businessmen who follow rules."

"That was my argument! Why would they kidnap a man of modest means when they possess such wealth?" Hai Shuzu shook his head. "Their goods are famous even here in Qiongzhou. A single glass mirror is worth half my fortune. If not for my mother's weeping, I would have gone just to see their wonders with my own eyes."

"A reputation for wealth is a double-edged sword," Lin noted inwardly.

"I happen to know merchants who trade with them," Lin lied smoothly. "If you cannot go, I can arrange for an agent to handle it. Bringing the ship back should be simple."

This was the perfect cover. The return of the ship would provide a plausible explanation for Hai Shuzu’s sudden liquidity, shielding him from suspicion. Hai Shuzu caught on immediately.

"The costs you incur should be recorded," he said hurriedly. "We will settle them from the dividends."

"What costs? We might even turn a profit." Lin regretted that Hai Shuzu hadn't seen Lingao himself—the propaganda value would have been immense—but this would suffice.

"If the ship returns safe, that is blessing enough. I will sell it immediately. I am done with the sea." Hai Shuzu shuddered.

Lin Baiguang instructed Chen Tong to return to Lingao, accompanied by Hai Ji, the steward. Hai Ji was the only literate and reliable servant left.

Although the "owner" hadn't come, the man known as "Ma Jia" at the Admiralty Court processed the case according to procedure.

The file for the five-masted ship was thick, covering the vessel, cargo, and salvage calculations. Hai Ji stood before the court, heart pounding, as Ma Jia read the judgment. He expected a ruinous ransom.

Ma Jia’s technical jargon flew over his head, but Hai Ji grasped the essentials: the "salvage fee" was one-fifth of the total value. The Australians were willing to buy the cargo at market rates to offset this fee.

Hai Ji nodded frantically. To him, these were powerful pirates; he wouldn't dare negotiate. He signed the papers and pressed his thumbprint where directed.

To his shock, he was handed a stack of documents and a chest containing 1,174 taels of fine silver.

"This is the balance from the cargo sale," Chen Tong explained. "After deducting the salvage and storage fees. Here is the itemized receipt."

Hai Ji stood dumbfounded. The pirates were *paying* them?

"The prices are based on Guangzhou market rates," Chen Tong smiled. "Don't think we shortchanged you."

"Not at all! I wouldn't dare!" Hai Ji stammered, waking from his daze.

"Now for the ship," Chen Tong said. "Follow me."
