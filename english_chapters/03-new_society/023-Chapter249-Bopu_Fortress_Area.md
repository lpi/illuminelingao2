# Chapter 249: Bopu Fortifications

Lin Shenhe raised binoculars to watch the drifting small boat in the distance. When the firing angle was raised to 10 degrees, the shell's splash point was not far from the range-finding boat at maximum distance—five kilometers. This was still using black powder; with nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin mixed propellant, range would probably be even greater.

"It's a pity the fire control system is so poor." Li Yunxing sighed. Relying on visual aiming and range table calculations to hit a moving point target at sea, a 5% hit rate at this distance would be very lucky. The biggest contradiction the Ordnance Design Bureau encountered was that their cannons' range greatly exceeded their fire control capabilities.

"Add a scope to the cannon," Bai Yu joked.

"I'd like to, but there are no suitable lenses. It'll be good when the industrial department can produce optical glass for direct-fire sights."

"That's probably impossible for the next few years. We'll still rely on calculation—make the firing tables well, solve the calculation equations. It will always be useful for gunners to memorize them."

"But this cannon is truly exhilarating!" Wang Ruixiang caressed the polished, shiny cast steel cannon. "Thick enough!"

"The Planning Committee only allowed two of these 150mm cannons." Lin Shenhe was regretful. "To defend Bopu, two are really not enough. We'll have to cast more smoothbore cannons."

"I think casting fewer is good—casting too many miscellaneous cannons is wasteful. We shouldn't be satisfied with this primary level," Bai Yu said. He had formally studied weapon manufacturing and lacked enthusiasm for old-fashioned guns.

"True, but there are still too few cannons. Bopu needs fortification." Ying Yu shook his head. As artillery commander, he belonged to a cross-service branch; gunners from both army and navy trained in his artillery company. He was responsible for Bopu's firepower arrangement. "Adding these two, there are only six cannons available for the fortress. What use is this?"

"Casting new cannons isn't hard, but we should standardize. Currently it's too random—some marked by caliber, others by shot weight. Stockpiling ammunition is too difficult," Li Yunxing suggested.

"Of course, we should equip everyone with rifled cannons." Ying Yu looked down on smoothbores. "The Army can use imitated Japanese Type 92 Battalion Guns plus mortars. The Navy can use 70mm or 100mm breech-loading rifled cannons."

Lin Shenhe found a clean stone and sat down. "Given our current industrial capacity, let's take it step by step. For the new army's artillery, we'll still use smoothbores—the Army needs large numbers with high usage frequency, but our materials are poor and ammunition manufacturing capacity weak. Smoothbores don't have high requirements and are simple to manufacture. It won't hurt if they're lost. Classification will follow traditional shot weight. I think four types suffice: 6-pounder and 12-pounder cannons, and 12-pounder mountain howitzers and 24-pounder howitzers."

"Are mortars not needed?"

"The 24-pounder howitzer serves that purpose," Lin Shenhe said. "Huge siege cannons belong to a special category and aren't listed as regular equipment."

Wang Ruixiang remembered the infantry's killer. "Speaking of mortars, we can use trench mortars."

Lin Shenhe said, "Technically not difficult. The problem is ammunition—fuses. Without reliable fuses, it's better not to play with that."

He continued, "As for the Navy, breech-loading rifled cannons—at least rifled cannons—are the trend. The industrial department can provide few warships, and qualified sailors are hard to train. Ships and people are precious, so use long-range, high-lethality rifled cannons for self-protection against strong enemies."

"I agree. Equipment depends on our industrial capacity and the enemy's level. Being too advanced occupies too many resources and affects industrial upgrading," Li Yunxing said.

"Let's return to the command post."

Everyone descended from the gun emplacement and returned to the fortress command post. The newly completed post was located atop the Bopu beacon tower hill, in the same place as the heavy artillery emplacement. This artificial hill, over 25 meters high with a 45-degree slope, had been transformed into the entire Bopu Fortifications' main support point. Besides original lookout posts and searchlights, structures like the command post, soldier barracks, and ammunition depots had been added.

To transport building materials and heavy cannons to the beacon tower, the Construction Company excavated a winch slide on the hillside, using an electric winch to pull cargo buckets to the top. Finally, this winch track was expanded into a covered concealed tunnel for personnel, supplies, and infrastructure—telephone and power lines were moved inside as well.

Barbed wire was erected around the top platform, and trenches were dug. The Navy stationed a marine platoon here: one artillery squad and two infantry squads.

The Bopu Camp at the beacon tower's foot was reinforced accordingly, with original crude wooden watchtowers upgraded to brick and stone blockhouses. The Machinery Department batch-cast 12-pounder howitzers for these blockhouses, installed on old naval gun carriages using pulley blocks to buffer recoil. The fired shells were mainly canister shot, used effectively as giant machine guns.

Beside the trestle bridge leading to the *Fengcheng*, a four-story brick-and-cement fort was added, mounting a 32-pounder cannon and a 12-pounder mountain howitzer. A platoon was usually stationed there.

Finally, there was the *Fengcheng* itself. Its tall superstructure could play a role similar to the beacon tower in the port, and the ship possessed multiple searchlight sets. It was suitable as a battery. Moreover, the *Fengcheng* was extremely valuable, so installing cannons served dual purposes. Another 150mm cannon was installed on the *Fengcheng*'s foredeck using Lin Shenhe's newly developed recoil mechanism, rotatable by manpower.

To strengthen *Fengcheng*'s protection, the Executive Committee issued "Fengcheng Management Regulations": all unused cabins must be locked; portholes—except those needing periodic ventilation—must be completely closed and locked. All movable items must be registered in ledgers and couldn't be used at will. The gangway must be retracted before dark every day.

Besides these support points, a fort and navigation light were built on Lingao Cape—a fort had been built there during the Westernization Movement.

"We can also manufacture naval mines to seal off all firing dead angles. Basically, the port area will be impregnable," Li Yunxing said. "For safety, it's best to use controllable electric mines."

"Wire, oh wire," Lin Shenhe said. "Wire is first-class material. Using it for mines will get you skinned alive by the Director-General."

"But isn't wire already in trial production?" Li Yunxing had seen this news in internal communications long ago.

"You trust enameled wire soaked in seawater?"

"Enameled wire?" Li Yunxing was disappointed. But on second thought, it made sense—modern cable insulation materials were either plastic or rubber, neither of which existed here.

"Manufacturing fixed moored mines should be possible," Lin Shenhe said.

Moored mines themselves didn't have much technical content. Using casting to manufacture the mine body, filled with black powder—30KG of black powder was enough to destroy any contemporary ship. A buoyancy reserve gap was left inside; anchor chains for tethering could be made of iron.

The slightly more difficult part was the fuse. Multiple fuses needed to be set for effective impact; they had to be cheap, easy to obtain, and reliable. The weapon team decided to tackle moored mine manufacturing after artillery work ended.

"Honestly, regarding moored mines—if the situation isn't critical, it's better not to lay them; future trouble is endless." Chen Haiyang, looking at the defense map, said, "These things tend to go missing once laid. Nowhere to find them. Clearing is troublesome and strenuous with poor effect."

He sighed. "Naval mines are particularly durable. A ship hitting a fifty-year-old mine will still explode. The Yangtze Estuary channel is still being swept for mines—residual mines from the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression are still there."

"I guarantee our mines absolutely cannot last fifty years; they'll become ineffective within a few years at most," Lin Shenhe said jokingly.

While discussing the defense plan, the sentry reported Li Haiping had arrived.

Chen Haiyang looked at Li Haiping's application, brows knitted tight. Though the Executive Committee meeting Li Huamei was almost certain, he couldn't reply to the promises made by junior officers.

"Guns—absolutely cannot be given," Chen Haiyang said. "I don't have this power; even the Executive Committee must discuss collectively regarding giving firearms to natives. Your promise overstepped your authority."

Li Haiping said anxiously, "She's training sailors for us. We have to give benefits."

"Benefits come in many forms; why focus on guns?" Chen Haiyang said. "I can't decide this. I'll help report during the meeting; the Executive Committee will decide."

"That's too bureaucratic! We urgently need friends! What about just visiting the *Fengcheng*? Not entering cabins, just walking on deck."

"Whether friends or not isn't our Navy's business. Your application to visit the *Fengcheng* also needs Executive Committee agreement."

"Damn, what kind of business is this—"

Just then, the telephone rang. Chen Haiyang picked up, said "Yes" several times, then repeated Li Haiping's application.

"Correct, Li Huamei's attitude seems changed, so—huh? Yes, yes, okay. I understand!" Hanging up, he told Li Haiping:

"Count yourself lucky. The Executive Committee agrees to let you take her aboard to visit, but she cannot enter cabins! The Executive Committee has a task requiring her cooperation."
