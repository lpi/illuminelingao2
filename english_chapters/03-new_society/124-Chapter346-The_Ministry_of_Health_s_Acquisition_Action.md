# Chapter 346 - The Ministry of Health's Acquisition Action

"In medicinal materials and pharmacology, I'm superior to him. But regarding medicinal material trade and pharmacy management in this timeline, I'm a complete novice. This arrangement leverages both our strengths."

"Will he agree? What's Runshitang's financial situation?"

"I've felt him out," Liu San said. "Runshitang is Shopkeeper Yang's personal property. His family has been in the business for generations. His father established this shop after arriving from Guangdong. Business has been mediocre in recent years—just getting by. Shortly after the old man died and Shopkeeper Yang took over, a shipment of medicinal materials was seized by pirates. Things have been tight ever since."

"This is his ancestral property. Ancient people may find selling family assets unacceptable."

"I've considered that. Acquisition via equity would work best. We leave Shopkeeper Yang with a minority share, keep the signboard unchanged, retain most personnel, and he continues as shopkeeper *and* shareholder—preserving his face. Naturally, we hold the controlling stake."

Liu San elaborated: "Once I become the owner, I can directly supervise operations openly, focusing my energy on Chinese patent medicine production. We'll use their existing business channels to first establish medicinal material procurement links in Qiongshan County. Then, leveraging their connections, we visit the mainland—Shopkeeper Yang has several uncles operating pharmacies or practicing medicine over there. We tour everywhere, cultivate relationships, acquire materials along the way, and recruit professional Chinese medicine processing talent to bring back."

Shi Niaoren nodded. "This approach is sound. How much budget?"

"Purchasing the shop—including livelihood assets and inventory—shouldn't exceed two hundred taels of silver." Liu San said. "But expansion and renovation will add considerably..."

"How do you plan to expand? Establish a dedicated Chinese medicine processing factory?"

"Unnecessary. With facilities this excellent at the pharmaceutical factory, why would I relocate to a county seat reeking of pig and chicken manure?" Liu San had clearly thought this through. "I intend to merge the processing specialists from the pharmacy into the pharmaceutical factory's Traditional Chinese Medicine workshop. The pharmacy itself would handle only drug sales, procurement, and distribution..."

"Distribution?"

"Indeed. Lingao has abundant wild Chinese medicinal resources. Take the Alpinia oxyphylla the resources department discovered recently. The honey locust found by the circumnavigation expedition can also be exported beyond our own needs." Liu San continued: "After acquisition, I plan to relocate the main headquarters to East Gate Market and build a magnificent grand pharmacy. The old shop in the county seat becomes a branch. Later, we open pharmacy branches in markets throughout the county—the Ministry of Health's 'Medicine to the Countryside' initiative can operate under the guise of 'Resident Physician' services at these pharmacies. This approach is less labor-intensive than traveling village to village, and local people will find it more trustworthy..."

"You've certainly thought this through."

"I'm not finished. Through the medicinal materials export channel, we gradually extend our network to key locations on the mainland. We build brand recognition. We begin selling the pharmaceutical factory's specialty medicines, enhancing the Transmigration Group's prestige and the reputation of 'Australian Goods.' If the Executive Committee ever decides to establish a Cult of Light or similar organization, pharmacies selling specialty medicines could serve as missionary outposts..."

Hearing Liu San's ambitious comprehensive plan, Shi Niaoren marveled once again: *There are capable people in the Transmigration Group!* Such talent had been hiding in his own Ministry of Health all along.

"When you put it that way, failing to fight for this budget would be unconscionable." Shi Niaoren smiled. "Setting aside future plans—how much budget do you need for acquisition plus relocation and construction?"

"Here's the budget list. Approximately four hundred taels of silver should suffice: converted inventory value, working capital, new premises, and launch expenses."

"Four hundred taels it is. I'll approve it. The Planning Committee shouldn't object—silver isn't a first-grade material, and the amount is modest." Shi Niaoren allowed himself a small joke.

Liu San packed a box of various homemade medicines for clinical trials. Shi Niaoren reflected that this effectively meant skipping animal testing and proceeding directly to human trials—a true "Great Leap Forward" in pharmaceutical development.

Emerging from Liu San's workshop, Shi Niaoren found Hu Yicheng still enthusiastically fiddling with something. He approached for a closer look: several large wide-mouthed glass jars. One, sealed with gauze, contained suspicious green cilia floating at the bottom; a jellyfish-like bacterial film drifted on the liquid surface, accompanied by milky-white translucent gelatinous bacterial masses. The smell wasn't unpleasant—rather sweet and sour.

The other jars were unremarkable, filled with dark red liquid. The liquid was somewhat turbid, with foam and scum on the surface.

Noticing Shi Niaoren's attention, Hu Yicheng hastily offered: "Minister Shi, would you like a cup?"

Shi Niaoren hesitated. Nothing about this looked drinkable. "What is this?"

"Kombucha. A health and nutritional beverage." Hu Yicheng wasn't particularly invested in Kombucha's alleged benefits; this was merely a hobby to pass the time when the distiller sat idle. Sugar and tea were now abundant, and Huang Dashan's laboratory had strains to spare, so he'd improvised some side projects to practice his craft.

Shi Niaoren was inclined to decline—but then remembered his salt soda plan remained unrealized. Though Kvass had been Huang Dashan's creation, the producing enterprises were the Agricultural Committee and Ministry of Light Industry. The Ministry of Health claimed no involvement. But Kombucha presented possibilities...

Hu Yicheng watched his superior's expression shift through several configurations, unable to gauge the depth of his thoughts. *Minister Shi certainly has mastered the art of looking like a leader. How does one cultivate that gravitas?* While admiring this, he noted Shi Niaoren's expression settle into something righteous and resolute.

"Give me a cup."

"Of course, of course." Hu Yicheng poured hastily. Observing what appeared to be a steeling of resolve, he added quickly: "It's perfectly safe—we tested the components. No harmful substances. Everyone drinks a bit during late-night work sessions. Whether it provides benefits is unclear, but it definitely causes no harm."

"It's fine." Shi Niaoren tilted his head and drank the liquid that resembled black tea.

The taste proved far better than expected—sweet and sour. If there was any distinctive character, it resembled sour plum soup mixed with black tea. Served chilled, it would probably be quite good.

"Not bad," Shi Niaoren pronounced. "What's the cost?"

"Effectively nothing: just tea leaves and sugar. Huang Dashan provided the strain; we culture it ourselves." Hu Yicheng was puzzled—this was just casual tinkering. Why ask about costs?

"Little Hu, this is a 'Health Supplement'—yes, *Health Supplement*!" Shi Niaoren's enthusiasm surged—whether from the Kombucha he'd just consumed was unclear. "Something this beneficial shouldn't remain confined to the laboratory. We must let the broad masses enjoy it! We should distribute it to our laborers as a nutritional product..."

"*This* beneficial?" Hu Yicheng was startled. With Minister Shi's level of expertise, he surely knew Kombucha was essentially marketing fluff—in the same category as snake oil. Did Minister Shi genuinely believe it was some kind of panacea?

"Calculate with Huang Dashan immediately. Acquire more fermentation vessels. Prepare for mass production. I'll discuss sugar and tea quotas with Wu Nanhai." Shi Niaoren considered further. "Make the drinking liquid cleaner—filter it. Aim for clear, transparent appearance."

"Yes, yes." Hu Yicheng couldn't have imagined Kombucha would suit Minister Shi's purposes so perfectly. "That would be easy to arrange..."

"Once it's ready, I'll have Xiao Zishan distribute it to everyone as a health beverage." Shi Niaoren emphasized the word *health* with particular weight. "Find Dashan. Collaborate on drafting something about Kombucha's health benefits. I'll arrange for printing and post copies in the cafeterias..."

Liu San, having secured Shi Niaoren's approval, felt his confidence surge. He changed into the blue cloth outer clothes he wore for house calls and herb-gathering, donned a bamboo hat, shouldered his army-green canvas satchel, and set off toward the county seat.

Runshitang occupied a location on County Front Street—the only proper commercial street in the county seat—not far from the East Gate settlement. Since the Transmigration Group and County Yamen had reached their tacit understanding, both sides coexisting peacefully, transmigrators could freely enter and exit the county seat. Initially, Wu Mingjin and his colleagues had been extremely nervous, summoning street and neighborhood heads along with Baojia chiefs from the settlements outside the three gates. They had instructed inns, shops, and households within the city walls to forbid Australians from staying overnight; anyone demanding to stay must be reported to the County Yamen for registration. Discerning observers recognized this "defense" as farcical. Did the Australians require "inside coordination" to take the city?

Fortunately, the "Australians" showed no interest in staying overnight. They invariably arrived by day and departed by night. After the first few weeks, transmigrator curiosity about this Great Ming county seat had been thoroughly exhausted. Recently, apart from a rare few visiting on business, almost no one entered the city.

But while no one entered the city, more and more people *left* it. Not only did Australians avoid the city—local county residents were visiting less frequently as well. With its convenient, safe transportation and diverse merchandise, East Gate Market was attracting growing numbers of local villagers. Backed by full transmigrator support, its popularity continued to rise while the County Market grew increasingly depressed. Many shops had sent personnel to open branches or set up stalls in East Gate Market; some had simply relocated entirely.

Runshitang's operations remained adequate. It was the only local pharmacy, with no competition. Scattered medicine vendors and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who prepared their own medicines generally purchased supplies here—because most Chinese medicinal materials required processing (*Paozhi*) before use, and in Lingao County, only Runshitang had properly processed materials.

Since Liu San had begun planting medicinal herbs at the farm, he had learned from laborers assisting in the herb garden that such a pharmacy existed in the county seat. Professional curiosity naturally drew him to see what a Great Ming pharmacy looked like. Once conditions stabilized, he had paid a visit.

The shopkeeper and staff of Runshitang had initially regarded this "Hairless Thief" visitor with respectful distance. But over time, they discovered that although he was an overseas person, his knowledge of medical principles and medicinal properties was extensive—particularly his expertise in medicinal materials. Common ground bred warmth.

Because medicine remained in short supply, Liu San frequently dispensed Chinese medicines personally. Since his self-produced materials were incomplete, he came here to purchase—making him one of the shop's major customers.

Runshitang's storefront was impressive: high rooms, open porches. A large gold-character plaque hung on the lintel—though after long years, the gilding had chipped. Weeds grew beneath the entrance steps.

The entire property featured a front shop and rear courtyard, with an attached residential compound. Clearly, substantial money had been invested originally. Liu San had heard from the shop assistants that Runshitang's founder had come from a pharmacy-owning family in Guangdong. When he'd arrived in Lingao, he'd harbored grand ambitions of establishing a thriving enterprise. Reflecting on this, Liu San couldn't help feeling a twinge of melancholy.

He climbed the bluestone steps and felt a wave of cool air wash over him—delightfully refreshing in the hot, muggy weather.

"Mr. Liu is here!" A shop assistant's greeting echoed from the dim interior. He was thoroughly familiar to them by now.

Someone emerged to welcome him: Liu Benshan, the shop's manager. Liu Benshan was past fifty; by his own account, he had apprenticed under the old shopkeeper from age eleven—making him a true "old retainer." He handled most of the shop's routine affairs.

"Business is thriving!" Liu San cupped his hands in greeting, exchanging the customary pleasantries.

"Thanks to your blessing! Thanks to your blessing!" Liu Benshan took this in stride. Since his apprentice days, Runshitang's business had been just like this: neither prospering nor collapsing, merely persisting. It had faced serious crises several times; each time, he had thought they wouldn't survive—yet somehow they had muddled through.

Liu San surveyed the shop interior. Various implements were arranged neatly on the dark wooden counter, polished spotless. The bronze fittings on the medicine drawers behind gleamed brightly. No matter how depressed the business, standards were maintained. This was precisely why he liked coming here: no sloppiness, no carelessness.

Had this been a shoddy operation, he wouldn't have bothered with acquisition—he would simply have opened his own shop and driven them out of business.

A young shop assistant served boiled Prunella tea. Because business was poor, the shop hadn't recruited new apprentices in years. This so-called young assistant was in his early twenties. Ancient custom emphasized lifelong employment: once hired, so long as the business survived and the employee committed no serious violations, everyone simply carried on together.

Runshitang's business had deteriorated steadily since the old shopkeeper's passing, so staffing had remained static at six or seven people—front counter and back courtyard combined, handling all operations.

Liu San sipped the tea. The shop's Prunella tea was authentically prepared and thoroughly chilled with well water—fresh, smooth, and refreshing. Excellent for dispelling summer heat.

"Shopkeeper Yang isn't in?" Every previous visit, Shopkeeper Yang had emerged promptly to receive guests. He was keenly interested in Australian medicine—particularly the technique of injecting liquid medicine directly into the body with needles. He frequently inquired about the underlying principles. Liu San had explained some basic elements of modern medicine: intramuscular injection, intravenous and arterial delivery, microbial infection, antibiotics. Shopkeeper Yang's appetite for knowledge seemed insatiable. Traditional Chinese medicine shops typically didn't separate medicine from medical practice; shopkeepers and assistants generally possessed at least rudimentary medical skills. Naturally, they were deeply intrigued by these unprecedented new techniques.
