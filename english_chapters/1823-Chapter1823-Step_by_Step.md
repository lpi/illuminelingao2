# Chapter 1823 - Step by Step

A buzz of discussion immediately arose among the teahouse customers.

Gao Chongjiu raised his hand to stop Zeng Juan, then continued asking: "Since she went missing, why didn't you go search? Why didn't you come to the police station to report it?"

"Officer... this humble one—how dare we trouble the authorities with such household trifles? The shop is so busy we just didn't have time to pay attention."

Gao Chongjiu laughed and said to those around them: "Listen to this—this is his own daughter! Missing for two days and he says he 'didn't have time to pay attention'?"

A wave of disdainful murmuring immediately rose from the crowd in the teahouse. Cao Xueguang felt as if he'd been placed on a roasting rack, deeply regretting that he'd listened to his wife and sold Mingnu off as a servant girl.

In this era, selling off children and wives as slaves wasn't uncommon, but it was mostly among the lowest classes of poor families, or those suddenly struck by disaster who had no choice. The Cao family's teahouse business wasn't bad, and they hadn't suffered any calamity. Selling their daughter for no good reason like this—once word got out, it wouldn't sound good at all.

So Boss Cao hurried to say: "Yes, yes. This humble one was confused. I'll go report it right away."

Madam Cao Huang panicked at the mention of reporting. In her understanding, involving the government was a very serious matter. Not only would it cost money, but if things went wrong, there'd be physical suffering too—yamen had always operated on "forty blows for the righteous, forty blows for the wrongful." She blurted out: "She ran off to play. Not coming back for days is normal for her. This girl has grown wild. Who knows—maybe she was tricked by some good-for-nothing wastrel and ran off with him! How dare we trouble the authorities!"

Zeng Juan flew into a rage, pointing at her nose and cursing: "You shrew! My niece is only ten years old! How dare you smear her virtue and ruin her reputation!" He rolled up his sleeves to attack.

Li Ziyu hurried to restrain him. Madam Cao Huang was still defiant: "She runs out constantly. Call her home and she won't listen. If that's not a man on the side, what is?!"

Some tea patrons who knew the Cao family situation shook their heads. One interjected: "Boss lady, you should speak with some conscience..."

Boss Cao was mortified. He knew that if this continued, not only would he face legal trouble, but it would badly affect the teahouse's business too. He quickly shushed his wife and said: "Mingnu is indeed missing. As for how she went missing, this humble one doesn't know either. Perhaps she was snatched by kidnappers. I'll go report it to the authorities right now."

"So you're confirming what you told Zeng Juan this morning—that she might have been taken by 'kidnappers'—is true?" Gao Chongjiu said.

"Yes, yes, it's true, it's true." Boss Cao hurried to nod.

"Then there's no need to report. Young Master Zeng has already filed a report today. Look at you two! The parents care less than the uncle!"

"Yes, yes, yes." Zeng Juan's brother-in-law could only nod and bow repeatedly. Madam Huang glared at Zeng Juan several times but unwillingly lowered her head.

Several idle busybody patrons cheered: "Well said, Ninth Master! Ah Juan is a fine uncle indeed!"

Gao Chongjiu saw the conversation had gone about far enough. He added a few instructions—"Hurry up and search for her. Don't just focus on doing business all day" and "Keep a close eye on the other two children!"—before leading Li Ziyu and Zeng Juan out.

Once outside, Gao Chongjiu fished out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, drew one out, and Li Ziyu hurried to strike a match and light it for him: "Ninth Master, what do you think..."

Gao Chongjiu took a drag: "No doubt—the couple sold the child themselves. But they won't admit it now, and we have no evidence. We can only stop here for today."

Zeng Juan grew anxious: "What do we do?! That woman is a vicious shrew. Without giving her some suffering, she probably won't tell the truth. If we arrest them both and give them a good beating, we'll definitely get the whereabouts out of them."

Li Ziyu quickly shook his head: "No, no. Absolutely not."

Gao Chongjiu blew out smoke rings and said: "Back when I was working under the Ming, just being connected to a case was enough to chain her to the cellblock and make her kneel on the chamber pot. She'd have no choice but to tell the truth. But now it's Great Song's realm. We can't do that."

Li Ziyu explained: "Extorting confessions through torture is not how Great Song handles cases. Doing that violates regulations."

"Then what do we do?" Zeng Juan had thought that once the police went to the teahouse, finding Mingnu's whereabouts would be a simple matter.

"Even without Ming methods, if we really wanted to force him to produce the body-sale contract and reveal Mingnu's whereabouts today, it wouldn't be difficult," Gao Chongjiu said leisurely. "But Ah Juan, what if he didn't sell Mingnu as a servant girl?"

In Guangzhou city, besides wealthy families buying servant girls, there were two other types who bought girls. One was the "contract mothers," similar to Yangzhou's "raising thin horses."

This was essentially a business of cultivating concubines to marry off to wealthy men. Contract mothers were usually aging concubines whose looks had faded, or concubines expelled by the main wife after their master died. Some had also transitioned from being brothel madams or "procuresses." The process was no different from training high-class prostitutes: finding girls from poor families when young, buying them cheaply, and then as both adoptive mother, agent, and trainer, raising them according to the standards for concubines in wealthy households. They were taught arts, etiquette, speech, and deportment. Usually attended by servant girls. Compared to typical high-class prostitutes, they were equally accomplished in looks, voice, and skill, yet were "of clean background"—satisfying the moral sensibilities of some scholarly families.

The other type was being bought by a brothel to be trained by the "procuress" as a "*pipa* girl."

In Gao Chongjiu's view, if she'd been sold as a servant girl or bought by a contract mother, that was manageable. What he feared most was that she'd been bought by a brothel.

Zeng Juan said in shock: "They... they couldn't have sold Mingnu to a brothel! No matter what, my brother-in-law is still her biological father!"

"Hard to say." Gao Chongjiu said slowly. "If she really was sold as a servant girl, why would your brother-in-law act like this? I can see he's not just hiding something—he's hiding something big."

"If she really was sold to a brothel, what do we do?!" Zeng Juan was suddenly at a loss. Though he'd had no dealings with brothels, he'd heard those places were dens of filth. Madams and pimps were vicious. Even young masters from wealthy families who wanted to redeem a prostitute would be extorted for huge sums.

"...Getting the person back won't be hard. But if we force it out of him today in front of all those people, your brother-in-law's teahouse probably won't survive. You and he will have torn all pretense of civility. Never mind anything else—are you prepared to take those three children home to raise?" Gao Chongjiu's cigarette glowed and dimmed. "Besides, if Mingnu spent time in a pleasure quarter, that wouldn't sound good either. I advise you to leave some room for maneuver—this is for the three children's sake too."

Zeng Juan knew he was right, but not knowing Mingnu's whereabouts still left him dejected.

Li Ziyu saw his downcast expression and consoled him: "Ninth Master is right. Whatever else, Boss Cao is still the biological father of your three nephews and nieces. If you really ruin him completely, how would they get by?"

Gao Chongjiu said: "Just rest easy. Your niece was definitely sold—since it's not an abduction case, there's nothing to worry about. Whether she was bought by a wealthy household as a servant girl or by a contract mother, there must have been a broker as middleman. One inquiry and we'll know. If worst comes to worst and she was bought by a brothel, the pleasure houses in Guangzhou city all have their connections. I already sent someone to make inquiries this morning. There'll be news soon."

"Then I'm in your debt, Ninth Master and Brother Yu." Zeng Juan knew he'd already incurred enormous debts of gratitude to Gao Chongjiu and Li Ziyu today. With his status as a small candle shop proprietor's son, he naturally couldn't repay them. Perhaps only by passing the civil service exam could he repay them later if something came up. The pressure on his shoulders grew heavier still.

"Still, today wasn't fruitless." Gao Chongjiu chuckled, then turned to ask Li Ziyu: "Ah Yu probably already understands."

Li Ziyu was bewildered at first, then immediately understood: they had filed the case as an "abduction case" based solely on Zeng Juan's retelling of Madam Cao Huang's words. Serious scrutiny wouldn't hold up—this was what he'd been worried about all along. The Australians were extremely strict about regulations. If he got disciplined for this, or worse, lost his job, what then?

But today's exchange with the Cao couple at the teahouse had made them publicly admit that Mingnu's disappearance might be connected to "kidnappers"—coming from the "guardians'" own mouths, this was far more useful than Zeng Juan's secondhand account. Li Ziyu's biggest worry about "fabricating testimony" no longer existed.

This Gao Chongjiu really was methodical, establishing firm footing at every step. Li Ziyu thought, inwardly admiring him.

"Since it's still early, let's ask around the shops on this street to see if anyone's seen Mingnu." Li Ziyu said.

This investigation, in Gao Chongjiu's view, was really unnecessary. But on second thought, he realized Li Ziyu had his reasons. Since the case was filed as "abduction," naturally they had to follow abduction case procedures. Useful or not, they had to go through the motions.

*A sensible person,* he thought.

The three distributed Mingnu's portrait along Six Banyan Street. Several shop workers said they recognized Mingnu but couldn't provide any more useful leads—naturally there were no leads to begin with. Gao Chongjiu and Li Ziyu alike were just going through the motions. Only Zeng Juan followed along, full of suspicion.

Soon Li Ziyu entered the shop run by Miss Dong.

"I know this little girl. She often stood in front of my shop staring at the food and drooling. But her parents were very stingy with her—they never bought her anything. I felt sorry for her and secretly gave her cakes a few times." Dong Mingdang took the portrait and studied it before saying.

"Oh? Have you seen her recently?"

"Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her for several days. Is Officer Li looking for her?"

"She's missing now. We suspect she was kidnapped. If you see her, please contact us immediately."

"My mother and I were once forcibly abducted from Shandong. The suffering of being helpless and stranded far from home—this servant understands only too well. Whatever I can do to help, I'll certainly try my best."

After completing their round, Gao Chongjiu told Zeng Juan to go home and wait for news. He and Li Ziyu still needed to return to the bureau—there was paperwork to handle.
