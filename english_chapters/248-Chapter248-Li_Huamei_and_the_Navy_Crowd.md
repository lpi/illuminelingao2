# Chapter 248: Li Huamei and the Navy Crowd

At the same time, on the *Hangzhou*, Li Huamei was ruthlessly mocking Le Lin, who was at the helm, telling him his steering would only drive the ship onto the reefs. Le Lin's crisp US Navy uniform was drenched by the splashing spray, and he had to endure the beauty's merciless teasing; he looked miserable. Then she shouted at the navy men who had been clinging to the masts and yards for over an hour without unfurling the sails, just hugging the timber and shivering: "How long are you country bumpkins going to hug them? Planning to take the masts as wives?!"

Li Haiping was trembling up there. Climbing yards on a mast swaying left and right more than ten meters above the deck was not a job for ordinary people. Although he had climbed up, once at the top, he didn't dare traverse the yards, let alone furl the canvas. He clutched the rope net deathly tight, feeling his body constantly rising and falling, complaining incessantly in his heart—he didn't expect this sailing ship business to be so un-fun. It seemed he would have to be a die-hard steam ironclad partisan in the future.

Looking at Lao Di next to him, the man was even more miserable than himself. Lao Di originally worked in the Army, but somehow wanted to join the Marines. Relying on two years of service in the coastal defense troops, he became a company commander of the Marine Corps as soon as he defected to the Navy. This person liked to talk about military hardware—K98s, Tiger tanks, and 88mm cannons never left his mouth, for he belonged to the rare Germanophile faction among the navy enthusiasts. He had always claimed climbing masts was a piece of cake, but he didn't expect to lose his nerve the first time he got on the ship for sea training. At this moment, he hadn't even climbed onto the yard, hugging the mast halfway up with his eyes closed tight. *Damn*, Li Haiping thought, normally we modern people shouldn't be afraid of heights; no matter where we are, we have to climb a few floors...

"Alright, you all come down. Seeing you like that is really distressing." Li Huamei had apparently lost hope for them.

"My leg cramped a bit today, can't exert strength," Lao Di emphasized objective factors as soon as he hit the deck. "Really, look, it's still numb now—"

"It's truly God's blessing that you guys can live till now in Lingao." Li Huamei laughed. "And like this, you still want to sail ships yourselves? You can't even climb masts."

It was depressing yet irrefutable. Li Haiping was speechless. However, he noticed she was greatly appreciative of the detailed division of duties for each sailor and the continuously conducted drills. At the same time, she was extremely interested in the Derringer pistols equipped by the navy men. He watched this, secretly delighted; as long as she had a weakness or desire, she would be easy to handle.

Mund, panting and with his clothes rubbed black by the mast, protested: "Who said a captain must be able to climb masts? Does a captain have to shovel coal into the boiler himself?" Speaking of this, he suddenly realized Li Huamei didn't know what a boiler was, so he corrected himself, "We are high-quality talents who have mastered technologies more advanced than climbing masts!"

Although Li Huamei smiled without speaking, she knew in her heart this was not false. She already knew from her Young Miss that the Australians possessed many fresh gadgets, but the feeling of experiencing them personally was completely different. The shock brought by the appearance of that huge iron ship in the bay was unparalleled. The largest ships she could see at sea in the past were merely the large galleons of the Spanish and Portuguese. Compared with the iron ship before her eyes, those sea monsters of over a thousand tons were simply the difference between whales and sharks. Just the bulwarks, taller than city walls, amazed her.

As for the pistols and rifles they used, she didn't know who else in this world could possess firearms that could fire without matchcords, wheellocks, or flints—what secret was hidden in those small copper pieces? This interested her more than the iron ship. Not to mention the binoculars worn by every officer—they could see farther and clearer than all the telescopes owned by Europeans from the entire East Indies to Macau.

There were also things not so scientific. The strangest was a small box that could talk to people far away at any time. At first, she thought it was a trick, but when she truly heard the voice coming from the box and saw them talk endlessly with it, a great sense of fear welled up in Li Huamei's heart—such a thing, what was it if not witchcraft?

But these people showed no sign of playing with witchcraft—Macau was a bizarre colonial commercial city with all kinds of cultures and beliefs, naturally including people practicing various witchcrafts, so Li Huamei knew a thing or two about it. This group of people, let alone witchcraft, didn't even have a bit of religious belief; their usual speech and behavior were that of a bunch of atheists.

In the few days she stayed at Bopu, almost every day there were things that surprised her. She discovered new things she had never heard of, from big things like the iron ship to small things like the paper they used, and even strange habits: for example, these people always carried a pack of coarse paper with them. Besides using it for the toilet, they usually used this paper as handkerchiefs to wipe their mouths.

Overall, she felt the Australians were more like Europeans in their understanding of technology, the items they used, and clothing habits, and even their speech and manners were similar. But they were indeed of Chinese descent. Later, hearing these navy men say they were descendants of Song Dynasty immigrants made her believe her judgment even more firmly.

If Li Huamei grew up in a family with a mix of Chinese and Western cultures and thus could take two distinct cultures calmly, then what the Australians possessed was a brand-new culture she had never felt before. This turned her originally passive mindset of just accepting the Young Miss's task into a strong curiosity.

"That iron fast ship of yours is indeed good." Li Huamei agreed. "But it seems you can't build another one."

"That's now. Watch in a few years, our cruisers will cover the entire China Seas." Li Haiping was full of pride, completely forgetting his ugly state on the mast.

"Really? Then will you sell me one?"

"This," Li Haiping hesitated slightly, "needs our leaders' agreement; what I say doesn't count. However," he said solemnly, "if you are willing to be our chief naval instructor, giving you one in the future won't be a problem!"

Li Huamei giggled. "I'm teasing you. Those few iron fast ships of yours are treasures, don't think I don't know. I'd better go earn my money. Just casually teaching you to climb masts is a piece of cake; just sell me a few guns in the future."

"Okay, okay!" Li Haiping nodded repeatedly, forgetting he wasn't the head of the navy. "As long as you help us train, what do a few guns count for—"

Just then, the rumbling sound of cannons came from Lingao Cape, and pillars of white smoke rose into the sky. This was the Ordnance Design Bureau of the Industrial and Energy Committee test-firing cannons. This was the 150mm muzzle-loading rifled cannon newly cast for the Lingao Cape Fort at Bopu. It was the largest caliber cannon manufactured by the Design Bureau since D-Day. When firing 48-pound Minié shells, the maximum range could reach almost four kilometers—a quite terrifying figure at the time.

Everyone excitedly picked up binoculars to look into the distance: sure enough, several sampans were anchored in a line on the sea surface at a certain distance from the Lingao Cape beacon tower. Red flags were planted on the sampans. Water columns constantly rose on the sea surface near the sampans, rocking the small boats.

"What kind of accuracy is this? More than ten shots, and not a single one hit." Li Haiping said with a dark face. "Looks like we need to triple the training shells in the next budget application, otherwise the enemy will rush to our faces before we hit them."

Several navy men chimed in.

It was Lao Di who knew the ropes: "What are you shouting blindly about? This is calculating the artillery range table. You think those boats are targets? The cannons are firing from near to far."

"Those are range-finding boats—" Le Lin said.

Li Huamei snatched Li Haiping's binoculars and looked for a long time, eyes shining. "This cannon is very good, the gunners are also strong. Shooting quite accurately."

This was equivalent to a slap in the face for the critics. However, they were used to Li Huamei's sarcasm and didn't mind. Anyone could see that Li Huamei's interest in cannons was strong—she had been at Bopu for nearly a week and hadn't yet seen the Transmigration Army's cannons fire.

"If you are willing to sell me cannons, I'll help you train sailors!" Li Huamei put down the binoculars and said this heavily.

"Deal!" Li Haiping patted his chest again. Several lechers of the Maritime Power Department laughed secretly at each other—the mermaid finally took the bait. There were also a few with stronger organizational discipline, including Le Lin, who were somewhat worried: the Executive Committee hadn't approved this matter yet, and even the Navy's own leaders hadn't agreed, so how could they casually promise others?

"I'll be responsible for reporting this to the leadership! They will definitely meet you in the next few days."

"Ya, quite the bureaucratic airs," Li Huamei curled her lip. "I don't even care. What Executive Committee members? Worth a few small silver coins? Just monkeys wearing hats!"

The navy crowd laughed heartily together; making fun of leaders has always been the favorite entertainment of Chinese people.

"Rather than meeting some Executive Committee Chairman, I want to go up on the big iron ship to take a look—" Li Huamei suddenly gave a charming sigh. "So big—"

The crowd of lechers immediately thought crookedly, all indulging in mental fantasies.

Mund immediately stated: "We'll go talk to the leaders again. Letting you go up to see the ship is nothing big."

Although the intimacy between the navy crowd and Li Huamei rose in a straight line, due to the caution of the high-level officials, the places where Li Huamei could actually move were still limited. Except for sailboats, she couldn't board any powered vessels, from the *Fengcheng* to the landing crafts. When appointing the main leaders of the naval organs, Ma Qianzhu very wisely chose only former PLA naval officers, hoping to use their self-awareness educated by the Party over many years to implement the will of the Executive Committee.

In this way, two factions unconsciously formed within the navy: one was the naval organ group composed of former professional officers like Chen Haiyang, and the other was composed of naval enthusiasts and former naval soldiers. The two major groups of the future navy began to take shape at this time.
