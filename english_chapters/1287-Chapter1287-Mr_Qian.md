# Chapter 1287 Mr. Qian

Since being captured, Qian Taichong had stayed in Lingao for more than two years. He came from a poor family. Although he saved a little money by working as a tutor for children and a traveling advisor to marry a wife and have children in his hometown, he hadn't even reached the level of a well-off family. Therefore, no one redeemed him after he was captured. Seeing the officials and advisors in the camp redeeming themselves and returning home one by one, while he could only stay in the prisoner camp working every day, he felt extremely resentful.

Chang Qingyun, who was captured with him, "almost wanted to die" because he was used to living a pampered life and couldn't do the hard work in the prisoner camp. Because Qian Taichong had more interactions with him on weekdays, and he was a knowledgeable Juren master, Qian Taichong took care of him in many ways and often helped him do some of the hard work. This moved Chang Qingyun to tears. He stated many times that as long as he was released, he would become sworn brothers with Qian Taichong, and their families would be friends forever in the future.

Later, Chang Qingyun's family redeemed him. Chang Qingyun vowed that as soon as he returned, he would raise money to redeem Qian Taichong as well. Qian Taichong thus waited eagerly in the prisoner camp for Chang Qingyun to redeem him.

Unexpectedly, Chang Qingyun was never heard from again after leaving. In the end, it was he himself who accumulated enough points by working to gain freedom—by then it was already the spring of 1632.

After obtaining freedom, Qian Taichong declined the retention of the civil affairs cadres in the prisoner camp to settle down and work locally, and decided to return to the mainland. In the past few years, he had seen too many things about the Australians on the construction sites of the prisoner camp, and felt more and more that the Australians would sooner or later be a major trouble for the Imperial Court. He had endured hardships and slept on brushwood for a few years here with the *Kun* thieves, and it was time to go back and serve the Imperial Court.

With a little travel expense issued by the prisoner camp and a little luggage left when he was a prisoner, Qian Taichong took a public carriage from Lingao to Qiongzhou to find his former employer, Shi Bangyao, the Left Administration Vice Commissioner of Guangdong and Intendant of Hainan Circuit.

Since the disastrous defeat at Chengmai, Shi Bangyao had been living in seclusion in the Circuit Intendant Yamen in Qiongshan County. He didn't go to the office or receive guests every day, acting as a "prisoner of Chu", which was considered "non-violent non-cooperation" with the Australians. Remembering old feelings, he still met with this former advisor and expressed that he was in an unpredictable situation and could no longer retain him. However, Shi Bangyao had served as the Prefect of Zhangzhou in Fujian and had dealings with Zheng Zhilong, so he wrote a recommendation letter for Qian Taichong and gave him twenty taels of silver, telling him to go to Fujian to defect to Zheng Zhilong so that he could at least make a living.

"The *Kun* thieves have become like a prairie fire in Qiongzhou," Shi Bangyao instructed him at the time of departure, "It's a pity that the Imperial Court is now besieged by floating bandits and Eastern barbarians, and cannot attend to this, allowing this bandit to grow big. Sir has been trapped by the *Kun* thieves for a long time. Now that you have escaped from the cage, you will definitely be able to do great things in the future."

With this encouragement and a warm heart, Qian Taichong arrived in Anping, but he didn't expect that Zheng Zhilong wouldn't see him at all—Zheng Zhilong was now a hot figure, and people recommended by various big shots to eat idle rice were like crucians crossing the river. Qian Taichong was just a Licentiate and had no fame. Zheng Zhilong already had forty or fifty advisors around him, so he recommended him to Zheng Zhipeng.

Zheng Zhipeng didn't take Qian Taichong seriously either, and just let him be an assistant clerk advisor. The work was simple, the person was leisurely, and the treatment was naturally not high. It was purely giving him a meal for Shi Bangyao's sake.

For the destruction of the Zheng family this time, Qian Taichong was not as surprised as others. In his opinion, it was not surprising that the *Kun* thieves, who had already become a force in Qiongzhou Prefecture, wanted to destroy a mob-gathered sea lord like Zheng Zhilong—Qian Taichong observed coldly in Zheng Zhipeng's tent for a few months and knew that the Zheng Group was just a maritime merchant group. Everything was for profit pursuit, and there was not much political foresight. Compared with the *Kun* thieves, it could be called a difference between clouds and mud. Once war started with the *Kun* thieves, defeat was inevitable.

This contrast actually strengthened Qian Taichong's determination to oppose the *Kun* thieves. Like ordinary Chinese literati, he had an ambition to do a great career in his chest. Under the old social system, it was difficult for him, a small poor Licentiate, to achieve anything. Now that the Zheng family was severely damaged, the family was torn apart, and the legitimate son Zheng Sen had no one to support him, it was a great opportunity for him to come forward to turn the tide.

As long as he could support Zheng Sen to the position of the head of the Zheng family, and then plan slowly—Qian Taichong had the idea of being the "Grand Tutor" of the Zheng family himself—maybe he could plan a new world in this southeast sea area!

The people gathered around the young master of the Zheng family now were all bottom-level figures of the Zheng Group. Matos and Tong Tailang were loyal indeed, but they knew very little about officialdom affairs, and they were simple-minded and easily used. It would be much more convenient for him to manipulate them.

At this time, seeing that the Japanese had already delivered himself to the door, he gave a faint smile of feigned profundity and took out the article he had calculated over and over again in his stomach these days.

"Mr. Tong! It's rare that you are loyal and unswerving." Qian Taichong nodded repeatedly, "You want to support the young master to ascend the throne. Your heart is pitiful. But running around like this is completely useless."

Although he hadn't been in Zheng Zhipeng's tent for a long time, he knew the situation of the Zheng Group very clearly, so he was not surprised by the situation of the Zheng family's generals falling apart after Zheng Zhilong's death.

"...Young Master Sen is young, and the General was in his prime and did not prepare teachers and subordinates for him. So now the only thing Young Master Sen has is the identity of the General's legitimate son," Qian Taichong said, "He has no power of his own. He is not worth mentioning to the generals of the Zheng family, so no one cares about his identity as a legitimate son. Young Master Sen's mother is Japanese, which is even more 'not of our race' in the eyes of many generals, and there is no maternal family power to support him."

"Then what should be done?" Tong Tailang was a little anxious.

"Hehe, don't worry. There is still one person who cares about Young Master Sen. It's just that he still doesn't know about Young Master Sen's predicament now, otherwise I guarantee that he will definitely do his best to help Young Master Sen."

"Who is it?!"

"Fujian Governor Zou Weilian."

Tong Tailang had heard of Zou Weilian's fame—not only had he heard of it, but he had also accompanied Zheng Zhilong to visit him. He knew that this person was the chief official of the entire Fujian Province and a very powerful "Daimyo". But he knew that Zheng Zhilong and Governor Zou had always been harmonious on the surface but discordant in heart, not as harmonious as the former "Governor Xiong".

"Governor Zou and the General were always at odds..."

"That was then, this is now." Qian Taichong felt it was a bit difficult to explain to a Japanese person, "Before, the Master was alive. Now that the Master is gone and heroes are rising together in the Zheng family, he has other considerations."

When Zheng Zhilong was alive, the Zheng family as a whole was a huge threat to him, the Fujian Governor. Now that Zheng Zhilong was gone and the Zheng family was falling apart, although the confidant trouble was eliminated, the situation of heroes chasing the deer was not what he was happy to see. The split Zheng family would inevitably fall into the flames of war fighting each other, and the Fujian coast would suffer collateral damage. The situation in the southeast coast, which had been roughly peaceful, would also deteriorate again. By then, it would be difficult for Zou Weilian to explain to the Imperial Court.

A large but weak Zheng family was the situation Zou Weilian hoped to see. If he put himself in his shoes and thought about it, as the Governor of Fujian Province, what he most wanted to see was a unified but internally divided Zheng Group. In this way, all forces within the group would strive to please and win over the government, and he, Zou Weilian, would have room for skillful maneuvering. It would be good for the Imperial Court and for him personally.

For Zou Weilian, it was not easy for him to win over others in the Zheng family. The leading figures of the Zheng Group all had their own teams and forces. If Zou Weilian wanted to win them over, he would have to pay a great price; once supported, it was unknown whether they would become another Zheng Zhilong. Instead of letting an adult with insatiable desires succeed, it was far better to save worry by letting a young child without desires take the throne.

Moreover, Qian Taichong thought with a sneer, the people of the Zheng family who were fighting for power and profit in Zhangzhou Bay right now hadn't thought of it: Zheng Zhilong could have today because he had a great relationship with putting on the official skin. Zheng Sen was not only Zheng Zhilong's legitimate son, but also the heir to Zheng Zhilong's hereditary military position. Now, the young Zheng Sen was a court-appointed official, while the other generals of the Zheng family were just some "grassroots civilians".

Zou Weilian coming forward in the name of the Fujian Governor to support Zheng Sen who was "inheriting the position" not only had an excuse on the official side, but from the private side, he was protecting the legitimate rights and interests of "orphans and widows". It could be called open and aboveboard. It also gave Zou Weilian sufficient excuses and opportunities to intervene in the Zheng Group with justification.

Zou Weilian supporting Zheng Sen cost very little, but the restraint on the Zheng Group was great.

With Zou Weilian's intelligence, he shouldn't have failed to think of this. Qian Taichong was very confident in his deduction—and he knew that the Fujian Governor had sent people to inquire about the whereabouts of Lady Tagawa and Zheng Sen. Obviously, this Lord Governor still attached great importance to this mother and son.

Tong Tailang prostrated himself in admiration of his analysis and immediately expressed his willingness to listen to everything "Mr. Qian" said, as long as Fukumatsu could sit on the throne of the family head.

"We shouldn't be anxious now," Qian Taichong was confident and had long calculated the next plan several times, "Those gathered in this county school who refuse to disperse are all loyal and righteous people to the young master. We shouldn't ignore them. Distribute some of the money, rice and silver sent from various places to them in the name of the young master."

"But we don't have much money and rice..."

"The General was as rich as a country when he was alive. Would his legitimate son care about this little thing?" Qian Taichong smiled slightly, "We need to stabilize people's hearts."

"Mr. has brilliant views!"

"There are a few scholars outside who have some knowledge and can share weal and woe with the young master. We should pull them over to be used by the young master. You send someone to quietly invite these few people tonight." Qian Taichong said and gave him a note.

There was not a single person surnamed Zheng on the note. Qian Taichong believed that it was not appropriate to let members of the Zheng clan get involved at this time, lest someone intend to use their bloodline to seize leadership. In this place of Southern Fujian, the concepts of hometown friendship and clan were very strong. He was not only of a different surname but also from a different hometown, so he had to be even more on guard.

Wait until the wood has become a boat, then consider absorbing the Zheng family members.

"All according to Mr."
