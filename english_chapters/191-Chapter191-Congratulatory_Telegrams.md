# Chapter 191: Congratulatory Telegrams

For movie screenings, the Engineering Department had selected an open slope within Bairren Fortress weeks earlier. They'd carved tiered steps into the hillside, paved them with brick and stone, and installed wooden benches. About 400 could sit; packed tight, 500 was possible. The screen came with the 16mm projector. For easy setup and storage, they'd built a fixed screen frame. Anticipating regular screenings, they'd constructed a dedicated projection room with electrical wiring. The sound system was the projector's accompanying portable speakers—convenient to set up and take down.

Mei Wan had specially built a VIP section directly facing the screen, with an overhanging rain canopy. To give the cinema multiple uses, a semicircular stage was constructed below the screen frame for meetings and performances when not screening films.

Two hours before showtime, crowds had already gathered on both sides of the screen. Many came straight from the cafeteria holding lunchboxes. Electric lights weren't bright enough, so several gas lamps had been temporarily hung, illuminating everything brilliantly. Families came in pairs; those with children brought them along. The cafeteria had set up a stand beside the cinema, offering free juice and betel nut—the only available snacks. A bustling scene of harmonious society.

When music started playing in the newly built outdoor cinema, the noisy chatter instantly died down. Everyone waited breathlessly. The film title appeared on screen:

"The Matrix."

Everyone was floored. Was this satire or entertainment? But even so, everyone watched with rapt attention. As Keanu Reeves struck cool poses on screen, many "workers" living within Bairren Fortress were drawn by the shockingly powerful audio effects. When they discovered a gigantic "shadow play" was being performed here, nobody wanted to leave. Some hurried back to bring wives and children.

As news spread that the "chiefs" were watching an unprecedented "shadow play," workers and families from Bairren Commune rushed over. They didn't dare sit on the tiered steps inside but the cinema was open-air—they could see clearly from the perimeter.

Luo Duo quietly slipped into the VIP section. Besides Xiao Zishan, Ma Qianzhu and several other commissioners were seated there. Wen Desi and some other commissioners were absent—per leadership protection protocols, Xiao Zishan and Ma Qianzhu watched the first half, then Wen Desi's group would watch the second half. Not all present simultaneously.

"Commissioner Ma, many workers and family members have gathered around the cinema. Quite a lot of them. Should we mobilize more militia for security?"

Luo Duo had volunteered to be today's Bairren Fortress security duty officer since he wasn't that interested in watching movies.

Ma Qianzhu frowned slightly: "No need. They're just here to watch movies. No need to be so nervous."

"I'm afraid if something happens—"

"It's fine. Since they're workers, they should all be trustworthy people."

"Alright." Luo Duo was about to leave when Xiao Zishan called him back: "No need to mobilize militia, but have the on-duty militia prepare extra No. 4 tear gas grenades."

"Right, I'll see to it immediately." Luo Duo replied in the crisp, efficient tone leaders preferred. Seeing Ma Qianzhu not objecting, he left.

On screen, Carrie-Anne Moss was flying through the air. Ma Qianzhu said: "You're still this vigilant toward these natives who are basically our own people. How are we going to carry out localization in the future?"

"Our longest-serving people have only been with us for three months. This isn't like modern society where there are many information sources to check their backgrounds. We have to stay cautious."

Ma Qianzhu snorted with laughter: "You call this caution, using pepper tear gas grenades? Pathetic."

"Better than nothing." Xiao Zishan chuckled.

The natives watching the "shadow play" weren't thinking about all this. The moving, lifelike images on the white cloth amazed and fascinated them: a Western man in a long black coat spinning gracefully through the air; giant, strange octopuses flying through the sky; tall buildings as dense as mountain forests; vehicles trailing blue flames... Everything was completely unprecedented, yet looked so real. Ma Peng watched entranced.

Then came the terrifying demon realm. Towers were dotted with red lanterns, each containing a drowned person. Monsters walked among the towers, long tentacles waving in the black night sky. Ma Peng shivered with fear—this must be Asura Hell.

Though the effects were extremely shocking, the ancients' comprehension was quite good. They understood this was merely light and shadow, not real. Though some wanted to peek behind the screen to see what kind of troupe could perform such realistic "shadow plays," nobody acted rashly.

"The natives seem really absorbed in the movie." Wu De had heard many commune members had gone to watch for free. Worrying about problems, he'd come to inspect. Seeing them all watching slack-jawed and mesmerized, he was somewhat surprised.

"Do they understand what's being shown?" Luo Duo was puzzled.

"Never mind them, even I don't understand The Matrix." Wu De said. "But these native folk are purely watching for spectacle."

"Yeah, they probably can't even understand Mandarin. At least this is Li Yapeng's Mandarin dub."

Luo Duo's offhand comment gave Wu De an idea. Judging by this, movies were extremely attractive to locals. If movies could be used as a medium to teach Mandarin, wouldn't that kill two birds with one stone? Currently, Zhang Xingjiao was leading evening classes at the commune teaching Mandarin, but results were poor. Most local workers realized that getting ahead with the "chiefs" required learning their language, but Ming-era Lingao, Fujian, and Cantonese dialects differed hugely from 21st-century Mandarin. Short phrases were manageable; unimpeded communication was very difficult.

This was a great idea. Wu De pondered what films would be good for them.

Just then, Neo on screen was delivering his classic lines:

...

I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change.

I don't know the future.

I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.

I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

...

With the speech finished, the movie ended. Knowing more was coming, most people stretched lazily, waiting for the next film. Just then, Ding Ding briskly mounted the stage below the screen. Dressed in Western suit and tie, hair slicked, face radiant—looking ready to attend someone's wedding.

"On this joyous New Year's Eve, the Executive Committee Propaganda Team and all staff of the Lingao Times wish you family happiness, all your wishes fulfilled, and a happy Spring Festival." He spoke loudly into the microphone:

"Now we'll read a few congratulatory telegrams and letters—"

"The Baitu Village Committee and supporting units send this message: Baitu villagers are striving for self-improvement, determined to rebuild our homes with our own hands. We're doing well with fish and rice. Our beloved transmigrator army is building us new houses."

Hearing Ding Ding's emotional reading of the telegram, Xiao Zishan nearly laughed aloud. This spacetime was quite surreal.

"Naval Maritime Infantry Company defending Bopu: Please rest assured, people of our homeland, we will maintain hundredfold vigilance over our territorial waters and protect the transmigrator regime at all times."

"Our overseas dispatch station sends greetings: Wishing all transmigrators a happy holiday." Then the screen displayed four men with faces pixelated, together holding a banner with crooked brush-written characters saying "Happy New Year."

"Fengcheng vessel's on-duty sailors extend New Year greetings to all transmigrators via telephone! Wishing everyone a happy holiday and all the best!"

"Salt Field Village Committee sends: In the new year, wishing everyone good health and all the best. Salt Field villagers never forget those who dug the well. We will unwaveringly follow the transmigrator general line, marching from victory to victory!"

After each one, transmigrators applauded warmly, stomped feet, and shouted. The surrounding native onlookers were completely baffled—what was that man on stage reciting that made the chiefs act like they were having fits?

The final message was from the Hainan Women's Cooperative. Besides holiday greetings, it announced new betel nut shipments available for purchase—Li Mei's first attempt at independently sourcing goods.

Ma Qianzhu sighed: "Honestly, it still feels like padding."

"Hmm?" Xiao Zishan didn't immediately understand.

"I look forward to some New Year's Eve when what we hear are genuine transoceanic telegrams—from the Americas, from Malacca, from Africa, from Japan... from our colonies, overseas bases, trading posts, and fleets." Ma Qianzhu's voice suddenly became emotional, even choking up.

"That day will come!" Xiao Zishan, infected by his grand ambition, said with full confidence.

Just then, strange hissing sounds suddenly came from outside. Looking up, a green flame streaked straight into the night sky, followed by a red one. In an instant, trails of rockets crisscrossed the starry canopy. Inside and outside the cinema, crowds were drawn by this unexpected show, exclaiming "Ah, ah" in admiration.

The rockets flew higher and higher, then exploded momentarily in the night.

Like thunder shaking the sky, bright red and dazzling white flames burst and scattered, illuminating each other. This was a fireworks spectacular unlike anything people of this spacetime had ever seen. People spontaneously cheered and applauded.

Not just Bairren Fortress—residents of the county seat and Bopu also saw this unprecedented spectacle on Lingao's soil. Many who'd gone to bed came running out to see this rare foreign marvel.

Lin Shenhe and his artillery team colleagues behind him didn't cheer or applaud, but they were equally excited. The rockets had finally been proven usable.

"What's the effective altitude?" Lin Shenhe asked.

"Maximum was 550 meters."

"Is it practical?"

"Yes, though according to the manual, altitude should be 2,500 meters."

The spectacular fireworks display actually served as a test for the artillery team's newly manufactured rockets. Of course, to suit the New Year's Eve atmosphere, some metal-powder incendiary compound had been added to the warheads.
