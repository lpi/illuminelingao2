# Chapter 422 Study Class (Part 1)

According to a 50% ratio of "mixing in sand," it was already possible to completely strip them of control. Combined with disrupting the units and distributing them evenly to achieve "you in me, me in you," the factions inside would be thoroughly disrupted.

"The sailors will have to go through a 60-day quarantine period anyway. Our Political Department will seize this time to conduct educational work and try our best to win the sailors over."

"How is the education of the people Ren Fu brought going?"

"There has been considerable progress." Wei Aiwen was in high spirits. "They belong to Zhu Cailao's central army system and are relatively trusted. It was difficult at first, but we seized on the officer-soldier contradictions within—"

Wei Aiwen said that in the entire ideological education work, the focus was on the "Speaking Bitterness" movement. Whose bitterness to speak of? The first was naturally the bureaucrats and evil gentry who oppressed the common people and made life unbearable, forcing everyone onto this path. As for the second, it was the sea lords. The focus was to expose and criticize the various acts of oppressing the masses within the pirate gang, so that the sailors fully understood that the sea lords and leaders were not their benefactors but bad elements who exploited and enslaved them...

"Stop, stop..." Wen Desi hurriedly called a halt. "I understand this line of thinking—estranging the relationship between the two sides. But these bigwigs will still be employed in the future; they're not to be directly taken out and shot. If they become too antagonistic, how can work be carried out later? Won't the sailors start dragging them out for struggle sessions as soon as they get on the ships?"

"Of course, we'll have discretion." Wei Aiwen said, "It won't be escalated; we just want them to see the true face. Besides, we also have study courses for these pirate leaders."

"Going to hold study classes?"

"Yes, hold study classes."

Shi Shisi and the others stayed in the commercial hall and were treated to good food and drink. Starting from the second day, it was constant touring.

"Touring—constantly organizing them to tour, let them fully appreciate the strength of our group and the superiority of our system!" Wei Aiwen instructed. "Facts speak louder than words."

First was the tour of the *Fengcheng*. Personally boarding this huge iron ship, these men of the sea became as curious as little children. Just a few steps onto the deck, they all rushed to the bulwark and looked down.

"So high!"

Some didn't believe it was made of iron. They touched it with their hands, knocked and scraped with the copper coins on their persons. Some even went so far as to lick it. Seeing the newly installed cast iron cannons on the deck, these people's eyes went straight. It was the same 150mm muzzle-loading rifled gun as on the Bopu Beacon Tower. The ammunition rails beside the gun positions, the shells, and the cranes used to load shells all aroused their boundless interest.

What interested them most were the sliding rails under the gun positions. Without much effort, two or three people could make the cannon rotate. They all had experience in naval battles and knew the power of being able to freely adjust the firing direction, marveling one after another.

"Damn, with this thing, Zheng Zhilong amounts to a fart." Shi Shisi couldn't contain his excitement. "Even the big galleons of the Red Hairs in Macau wouldn't be a problem."

Next, they toured the Bopu Commune and the shipyard. The first iron-hulled ship, Project 854, which had been in semi-shutdown due to material supply problems, became the best showcase of construction achievements for its completed sections.

Shi Shisi and the others personally walked into the dock, stroking rows of iron ribs as thick as small tree trunks and plate after plate of iron riveted onto the ribs with giant rivets, with expressions of utter disbelief.

Fearing it wasn't impressive enough, Wei Aiwen also showed them propaganda films for several consecutive days. Out of caution, Japanese secret movies were not shown; instead, it was a propaganda film edited from various resources.

On the animated screen, in the iron and steel complex, molten steel splashed; in the hydroelectric power station, huge water dragons gushed forth; steel giant ships slowly slid from the slipway into the sea; looms continuously spewed out cloth and silk; the sparkling lights and endless streams of cars in cities; the rosy-cheeked faces of modern farmers driving Dongfanghong tractors...

Then came rows of white-helmeted and white-armored Imperial Stormtroopers marching. Then the scene changed to the armored troops formation at the National Day parade...

The leaders, one by one, lost their ability to discern in the darkness. This greatly exceeded their capacity to understand the world. When the lights came on, Lin Baiguang was satisfied to see them each dumbfounded.

"Gentlemen, this is the place we come from!" Lin Baiguang said, full of energy.

A few people barely managed to squeeze some smiles onto their faces, while others showed expressions of wild joy amidst their stupor. The former seemed more attuned to the trend, while the latter had the potential for opportunism. The intelligence personnel responsible for observing their expressions wrote their intuitive comments under each person's photo.

After three days of visiting and study, according to Wu Fo's eavesdropping on their private conversations, the leaders were practically prostrating themselves before the Crossing Group. Pirates worshipped the strong. Almost everyone said in conversation that they had come to the right place by defecting to Lingao. Some were even ambitious, thinking that perhaps the Australians would take over the Central Plains and replace the Zhu Emperor, and everyone could become founding heroes.

In this atmosphere, the necessary disposition of the fleet became much easier. After letting them rest and relax for a few days, a special meeting was convened, headed by Wu De, to announce the policy to the defecting leaders.

All the defecting leaders, regardless of how many ships they brought, would each receive an independent residence. This type of residence was designed by the Lingao Construction Company for the gradually increasing native administrative cadres in the future. It was also an experiment for personal residences after the collective dormitory system of the Crossing Group was abolished in the future.

This type of cadre housing adopted the idea of row houses to save land and building materials. Each building was a two-and-a-half-story structure with a practical area of 240 square meters. It had running water, drainage, and a simple squat-type flush toilet, but no electricity. All houses also had small front and back yards.

All private property they brought would be protected and freely disposable.

The family members and children of the leaders would all live on shore. Minor children would attend school. Adult children would attend school or participate in work according to family requirements and personal wishes.

Private servants were not recognized locally. Therefore, all servants brought by the leaders would have their status abolished. Those willing to continue serving the leaders would be treated as employment relationships. Those unwilling would be treated as immigrants.

As for the sailors they brought, those who wished to return home or go elsewhere would be given traveling expenses for disbandment. Those willing to stay would be concentrated for 90 days of quarantine.

"After the quarantine ends, those willing to return as sailors will be reorganized and put back on ships; those unwilling will have other work uniformly arranged by us." Wei Aiwen explained the policy.

The people below began to grow uneasy. Servants were fine; there weren't many of them anyway. Many of the sailors were commoners who had been forcibly captured. If they were free to come and go, wouldn't a lot of them run away? They had already lost a lot of people after this catastrophe. If this was done, wouldn't there be no one to command?

Then Wei Aiwen continued to announce: "Now, some of your ships have many people, some have few. It's barely enough for sailing, but if there's a battle, it probably won't be enough. So the Navy will set staffing quotas for each ship and fill all vacancies. From now on, pay will be issued according to the roster after each ship is staffed."

"In the future, all your food and pay will be issued by the Navy. You don't have to worry anymore. No need to worry about rice and firewood." Wei Aiwen laughed.

Shi Shisi and the others, however, couldn't laugh. They naturally knew the tricks here. After reorganizing personnel, a large amount of "sand" would inevitably be mixed in. The tight-knit small groups originally formed by regional and kinship ties would be completely diluted. Even if there were still some familiar faces on their ships, they would no longer be the trusted followers they could command at will.

As for unified logistics, it sounded like a good thing, but in reality, whoever's pay you receive, you're their soldier. If the Australians controlled the pay and grain, the brothers on the ships wouldn't listen to them much anymore. Once pay and grain were controlled, they could only obediently follow the Australians' commands.

How could everyone not know the implications? But these conditions were open and fair, and could even be considered generous. Not to mention that they now had no people, no grain, and if they opposed, it would just prove they had "disloyal hearts." What the consequences would be for someone who had just changed allegiance, everyone was very clear.

After several days of visiting and study, they had a direct understanding of the Australians' strength. Not only did they have enough awe, but their ambitions and expectations also grew—looking at the Crossing Group's strength, they might not dare to say they could march to Beijing and become emperors, but occupying a corner of the southeast and establishing a feudal domain was probably achievable. By then, they would be founding heroes with ranks and titles, honored with their wives and children!

It would be better to show loyalty now—after all, crushing their little bit of power was effortless for the Crossing Group. Since they were selling themselves to seek refuge, they might as well sell completely. Thinking of this, Shi Shisi was the first to stand up:

"Since I have come to defect to Lingao, I am willing to offer all my subordinates and ships! I only wish to be a vanguard general, charging into battle for the Chiefs!"

Everyone was dumbfounded. Li Guangfa followed suit and stood up: "I am also willing to offer my ships and people. From now on, I will be of one mind with the Chiefs. Sharing the same boat through thick and thin."

"I am also willing. I've had enough of the days of drifting on the sea!" Fatty Hu also shouted.

With this, the remaining people who were not quite willing also had to chorus their agreement.

Wei Aiwen assumed the manner of a leader, pressing his hands downward: "Since everyone has come to Lingao, we are one family. Since we are one family, there's no need to be particular about whose is whose."

He continued: "Your ships will still be commanded by yourselves. For those who don't want to drift on the sea anymore, the Executive Committee also has policies."

According to the policy set by the Executive Committee: for those willing to hand over their ships, the Executive Committee would pay to purchase the ships. After handing over the ships, those willing to continue with the maritime business would be assigned to work at the Naval Department. Those unwilling to continue going to sea would be assigned elsewhere.
