# Chapter 510 - The New Equipment Testing Ground

"This weapon is really quite good," Huang Xiong said with admiration, standing in the temporary camp over a newly opened wooden crate. "Much better than the first generation."

Packed in the standardized E-type shipping crate were "Second-Generation Standard Spears"—designed specifically to arm the transmigrated collective's local irregular forces. The triangular steel spearheads, manufactured using modern heat-treatment processes, were coated with a protective layer of "Hell Oil," a black residue from the final stage of coconut-oil refining, used for industrial lubrication and rust prevention.

The spear shafts were lathe-turned and preservative-treated—tough and resilient, guaranteed not to rot or become worm-eaten for years even without fire-hardening. These standard spears had been manufactured expressly for issue to the militia; equipping them all with Minié rifles would be too extravagant.

Three hundred standard spears, three hundred cutlasses. Each man received two woven-rattan safety helmets—one for work, and one new model with steel reinforcing ribs on the crown and sides for use in combat. This was the militia-miners' only protective gear. Of course, with the Machinery Works' current processing capacity, mass-producing mail shirts, plate armor, or similar advanced gear was child's play—it was simply wasteful. Someone proposed making cotton-padded armor, but issuing such gear in Hainan would have the militiamen preferring to go bare-chested. Others suggested simple European-style protection: breastplates and pauldrons secured by crossed leather straps.

All these proposals were ultimately rejected. Since even the regulars did not use body armor, there was even less need to outfit the militia.

The miners had received basic military training under Wei Aiwen at the quarantine camp before their arrival and now possessed a foundation of organization and discipline. They were organized into military-style units—squads, platoons, and companies—and moved in squad-sized formations. One of Huang Xiong's primary duties was to drill them in basic close-combat techniques and simple tactical coordination, forming a defensive system with the infantry platoon as the core and the militia as supporting forces.

The transmigrated collective had not bothered to provide ranged weapons. Against enemies likely to be encountered in Qiongshan, thirty Minié rifles were more than sufficient for long-range interception. Huang Xiong even felt rifles might not be necessary.

"Give me these four hundred lads, drill them properly, and without rifles—just spears and cutlasses—we could take Qiongzhou Prefecture," Huang Xiong boasted. "A few petty mountain bandits? Let them come—perfect for blooding our blades." He was practically itching for action.

"Take Qiongzhou Prefecture?" Tang Menglong was skeptical. Qiongzhou Prefecture had over two thousand combat troops at Baisha—quite different from the county garrisons, which at most had a few hundred ragged garrison soldiers.

"Certainly." Huang Xiong did not bat an eye. Since joining the Australians and receiving officer training, he had become thoroughly indoctrinated with the gospel of "discipline and organization are everything." He now held the Ming military in contempt; even the Jurchens, whom he had once feared like tigers, no longer impressed him.

"Just you watch, Commander—three months and they'll be crack troops!" Huang Xiong thumped his chest.

"I'm counting on them to mine coal for me. Your drilling can only happen in their spare time," Tang Menglong quickly clarified.

Mining coal was backbreaking work; making them drill after a full day's labor would probably spark a mutiny. But if they weren't trained, these four hundred men would be a disorganized rabble, and no matter how grandly Huang Xiong bragged, thirty rifles probably wouldn't be enough if seven or eight hundred bandits attacked.

In the end, they agreed that each mining squad would rest one day in six. Half that day would be devoted to drill; the other half, to rest.

The four hundred coal miners now moonlighted as construction workers. Under Zhang Xingpei and Shan Daoqian's direction, they built the camp and laid roads. Though they had no construction machinery, they possessed an inexhaustible supply of black powder and sturdy, durable tools, which greatly reduced the volume of earth-moving work—otherwise the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task.

In fact, Xu Yingjie of the Chemistry Department, after nearly getting himself killed several times, blowing up the laboratory three or four times, and diving into the blast trench on numerous occasions, had succeeded in synthesizing nitroglycerin—all thanks to the dried coconut shipped in from Yulinbao. Coconut oil, whether cold-pressed or hot-pressed, now met the transmigrated collective's edible-oil needs and part of their industrial requirements. The moment glycerin—a versatile basic chemical feedstock—went into production, it was used for explosives research. Nitroglycerin was too dangerous for military use, but it was quite practical as a civilian blasting agent for mining and quarrying.

Xu Yingjie had developed a relatively safe dynamite by absorbing nitroglycerin with diatomaceous earth. The Navy, however, refused to transport it aboard ship—the "relative" safety was only relative.

Large prefab wooden-structure components could not fit on the transport boats; they were carried on rafts towed behind. Zhang Xingpei's construction team completed the Jiazi Coal Mine dock in under three days. Defensive works had not yet begun; for now, they had simply dug a trench and planted it with Lingao-manufactured standard defensive bamboo stakes. These were not hand-whittled but machine-turned at the Woodworking Factory, then roasted and preservative-treated by machine.

The Executive Committee was treating the Jiazi Coal Mine project as a rehearsal for the future development of Tiandu and Hongji—testing organizational methods, equipment, and management procedures. Though the Jiazi operation was modest in scale and of secondary importance, it received treatment on par with what the future Tiandu and Hongji projects would enjoy.

New products the Industry Commission was testing in this project included: modular prefab wharves, shipboard pile drivers, shallow-draft inland transport boats, mobile field-kitchen sets, portable Lancashire boilers, large-scale water-purification units, second-generation "Grassland Series" field rations, dual-use "combat/work" safety helmets, second-generation militia spears, and standardized defensive bamboo stakes.

Originally, they had planned to use steam-powered coal-cutting machines, but a quick calculation by the Industry Commission showed that mechanical extraction would be wasteful. With four hundred workers—of whom roughly two hundred were actually miners, the remainder being support personnel for track maintenance, loading and unloading, dock security, and boat crews—each mining squad's quota per shift was eighteen tons. Daily output thus reached 350 tons. With a coal-cutting machine, daily output could easily exceed 600 tons. The transport boats simply could not move that much coal.

Without mechanical extraction, the boilers that had been shipped in would mainly support daily operations: pumping water, draining, steaming rice, and providing hot water for bathing. The Ministry of Health reminded Tang Menglong to ensure the miners practiced good personal hygiene. The Ministry had also assigned a medic to the Jiazi Coal Mine.

The mining site soon completed its infrastructure. Installing the rails took considerable time—not because construction was slow, but because they had to wait for *Qionghai Coal* to deliver the necessary materials. Huang Xiong had long grown accustomed to the Australians' extravagance, but he was still astonished to see that even the rails and sleepers for the "iron road"—as well as the crushed stone for the roadbed—were all shipped from Lingao. For Shan Daoqian and the others, however, this was far more efficient and ensured material quality. If they quarried stone locally without a rock crusher, the dynamite-blasted rock would have to be broken by hand, and the resulting fragments might not be the right size. Cutting timber locally for sleepers would mean no preservative treatment, shortening their service life. As it was, *Qionghai Coal* simply made a few extra runs, and they expended a bit more labor on transshipment.

The Jiazi Coal Mine's basic construction took less than a month. Thanks to the power of explosives, even the working face had been opened up—the coal seam here was shallow. Following Tang Menglong's guidance, Pan Da used blasting to strip away part of the overburden.

He conducted a field survey of the local coal resources and generally concluded that this was an extension of the Changchang Coal Mine belt from the modern timeline. There were five or six coal seams; the first was buried relatively near the surface, and most of its reserves could be extracted by open-pit mining. However, total reserves were not large—roughly two million tons were accessible via open-pit methods.

Tang Menglong ordered a portion of the miners to conduct a trial extraction. Consistent with the records, the coal here was lignite—precisely what the steel industry needed.

The proportion of gangue, however, was quite high. From a sample of the first hundred tons extracted, gangue and other low-grade coal accounted for over sixty percent. Gangue could still be burned as boiler fuel; the remaining forty percent was lignite—though this lignite was considerably better than what the transmigrated collective extracted at Nanbao. Nanbao's lignite was mostly earthy lignite, too low in heat value even for fuel, let alone coking; it was mainly used by the Agricultural Commission as fertilizer. Here, at least, the coal was predominantly dark lignite, marginally suitable for coking—better than nothing.

This was not unexpected—Hainan's coal deposits had always had these characteristics. The Changchang Mine boasted proven reserves of 67 million tons, but actual lignite amounted to only 9 million; the vast majority was gangue and other low-heat-value coal.

In any case, Lingao already had a coal-washing plant. After sorting, the coal would be usable. But this meant the Jiazi Coal Mine would have to deliver ample raw coal to meet the steel industry's needs—after all, only four out of every ten tons shipped could actually be used.

"Such a pity. There's no good bituminous coal anywhere in Hainan or Guangdong," Tang Menglong said with some regret.

Fortunately, there was a consolation prize: deposits of kaolin, clay, and peat occurred in association with the lignite—all useful minerals. Unfortunately, transport capacity was too limited. Local processing had no outlet.

Transporting coal by transport boat was woefully inadequate—each vessel held only five or six tons when fully loaded. Even shuttling nonstop, they could not move two hundred tons a day. Coal had to wait at the Hai family dock's warehouse, piling up for days before *Qionghai Coal* could collect a full cargo. Shipping the associated minerals was out of the question.

Given the natural navigability of the Nandu River, these flat-bottomed transport boats represented the Bopu Shipyard's design and manufacturing limits for shallow-draft, heavy-load vessels. For now, they would simply have to make do.
