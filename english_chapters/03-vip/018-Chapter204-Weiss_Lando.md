# Chapter 204 - Weiss Lando

"Manager Wen knows this person?" Huang Shunlong seemed unsurprised. "She's quite a famous figure around here."

"How could I not." Wen Desi, recalling the humiliation of his capture, felt a strong urge to do unspeakable things to her—but revealing such thoughts would seriously damage his image. "She and we have quite a history," he said vaguely.

Saying they had a history could mean either that they had collaborated or that they had a grudge—it was a neutral expression.

"Hehe, Manager Wen need not hide it. This woman acts independently and is utterly ruthless. I imagine she's had some conflict with your people as well."

Wen Desi remained silent, essentially confirming it.

Huang Shunlong explained that all anyone knew here was that Li Siya was of mixed Portuguese and Chinese blood—no one knew who her parents actually were or where they lived. However, she resided in Macau's Portuguese quarter, in a spacious and luxurious house. Though she made her living in a blood-soaked trade, she could openly appear at gatherings of Macau's Portuguese elite, suggesting her parentage was hardly lowborn.

"This woman is extremely dangerous," Huang Shunlong lowered his voice. "She considers Macau her lair, so she acts with some restraint here. But once at sea, she's utterly ruthless. And she's full of cunning schemes. If you've crossed her, you'd best be very careful in your daily affairs."

Wen Desi responded vaguely, but managed to learn quite a bit more about Li Siya: her twin-masted clipper was called the *Lotus*. She wasn't currently in port, having likely gone to sea again. He even discovered her address. Wen Desi briefly entertained the thought of having Bei Wei conduct a special operation, but Huang Shunlong went on to say he wasn't certain whether Li Siya actually lived in that house. Though Huang Shunlong had married a Portuguese wife, the woman was of low birth and didn't add much to his standing with Portuguese high society. Her only advantage was that he could now do business with the Portuguese without hindrance. He knew little of the activities of Macau's Portuguese upper class.

Following Chinese custom, Huang Shunlong invited them to stay for dinner, but Wen Desi had no desire to linger. Zhang Xin was especially eager to find where they sold the sweet rice wine. After agreeing on the seals and secret marks for future contact, they took their leave.

After leaving, they made a circuit and returned to the rendezvous point—the cross in the square at the intersection of the main streets—and found that Bai Duoluo had already returned. He wore the peculiar smile characteristic of religious devotees and held a leather-bound Bible in his hands. Wen Desi wondered if the Jesuits had managed to brainwash him in just over an hour. As he was studying him, Bai Duoluo came forward in high spirits.

"Director Wen, I have good news."

"The local Jesuit Superior would like to meet you."

The term "Society of Jesus" immediately conjured in Wen Desi's mind an image of a sinister figure in black robes seated in a dark marble chamber. What did the Jesuit Superior want with him? Surely not to proclaim the Gospel of the Lord? Wen Desi reflected that the transmigrators had never really discussed their policy on religion. While he wasn't particularly fond of any of this era's religions, ideally they would establish some kind of "Holy Church" with himself as the Archangel—but with so many people making this crossing, that probably wasn't going to happen. This group of modern people might be mediocre at other things, but they were all devastatingly sharp when it came to political maneuvering.

"First, let's find somewhere you can tell me about your meeting with the priest," Wen Desi said.

In a hall of a small but exquisite church in the Portuguese quarter at the heart of the city, the scorching sunlight of South China filtered through the small panes of lead-latticed glass in the windows, casting dappled shadows on the marble floor. A man in a clerical robe sat beside a large desk, his head bowed as if in thought. The desk had gilded corners and was piled with books and documents. A finely carved ebony crucifix was prominently displayed upon it.

Behind him stood an ornate fireplace. Judging by the patterns and the distinctive veining of the marble, both the stone and the craftsmen who worked it might well have come from distant Italy. Of course, in South China, where temperatures never dropped below twenty degrees Celsius even on the coldest days, the fireplace served a purely decorative purpose—a symbol of the authority of the Society of Jesus's Superior in Macau. This Superior oversaw all Catholic missionary activities in China and East Asia, wielding such power within the Church that he need not even defer to the authority of the Bishop of Macau.

This solitary figure was Gerolamo Geranzani, Superior of the Jesuits in Macau.

At this moment, Geranzani sat alone. His body was frail—many years ago, while on a mission in Patani, he had contracted malaria. Though tobacco treatment had saved his life, the aftereffects still flared up from time to time. Yet a powerful spiritual fire blazed within this weakened frame—perhaps knowing that his remaining time was short, he felt an ever-growing urgency about missionary work.

"These fools!" he muttered to himself. "Whether they're from the Franciscan or Augustinian orders, they're all fools. They believe faith alone is the bedrock of everything. That martyrdom is glory. Must the 1596 debacle in Japan be repeated here in China?"

On his desk lay a letter from the Jesuits in Manila, regarding whether Chinese ancestor worship constituted idolatry—a question that had sparked considerable debate within the Church. Moreover, this controversy showed signs of spreading to the highest levels of the Curia. Ah well, though the Society of Jesus wielded great influence at the Papal Court, power and enemies were always proportional, not to mention the kings and nobles who all sought to use the Jesuits as their own instruments rather than God's.

"Let them debate," Geranzani thought to himself. "Best if this matter is never resolved." He knew very clearly that unless the Church adopted the position already advocated by the Jesuits in Beijing—that Chinese ancestor veneration was merely commemorative—the already sluggish missionary work in China would become even more difficult. He had been in Macau for years and understood exactly what ancestor worship meant to the Chinese.

Of the missionaries he had sent out, apart from Matteo Ricci who had achieved some success, eight or nine out of ten had been expelled by China's local officials. Others had simply disappeared without a trace—Geranzani knew that most of them had likely found their way to martyrdom.

Missionary work in China was far less successful than it had been in Japan. Though Ricci's efforts had won over a number of Chinese officials and intellectuals to the faith, and they had successfully entered China's capital and participated in the court's astronomical calendar revision and weapons manufacturing, the number of converts remained stubbornly stagnant. He knew very well that China's common people, officials, and intellectuals maintained a deep wariness of these foreigners with their strange appearances and customs.

He sighed, as if hearing footsteps outside the door.

"What is it?"

A door hidden behind a curtain quietly opened. A man dressed in black walked in softly:

"Your Eminence, Lord Lando has arrived."

"Mm, show him in."

---

Before long, an officer walked through the door.

The man appeared to be between thirty-five and forty years of age, tall and solidly built, with keen and alert eyes and a short black beard. He was dressed in the fashionable Spanish style, with a fitted vest and snowy lace ruffles. The heavy sword on the broad belt slung across his chest occasionally clanked against his boots. This attire, combined with his cold gray eyes, marked him as a professional soldier who lived by the blade.

He removed his hat and bowed to the Superior in the French manner. He then stood respectfully, his bearing dignified—every inch a man of status.

The Superior studied the man before him. His gaze was deep and inscrutable, revealing nothing of his thoughts.

*This dangerous fellow*, the Superior thought. *Can I really entrust this task to him?* This adventurer, who had appeared from who knows where, called himself Weiss Lando. Though he claimed to be a scion of a noble family from the Parma region of Italy, his Italian was dreadfully poor—so bad that Geranzani, as a fellow countryman, found it embarrassing. People had noticed that he would occasionally slip into English. Were it not for his appearance and his steadfast faith, the Superior would have genuinely suspected him of being a heretical Englishman.

Such adventurers were everywhere in the Far Eastern waters at this time—men with backgrounds and histories both real and fabricated, all hoping to claim their share of the spoils from this age of great navigation. The Superior thought: *Well, so be it. A man like this has no roots. Should anything go wrong, I won't need to explain myself to anyone.* He studied the officer carefully for a moment, then spoke:

"You are Weiss Lando?"

"I am, Your Eminence," Lando replied.

"It has been over three months since you arrived in Macau aboard Father Komage's ship. Are you finding life here agreeable?"

"Entirely agreeable," Lando answered candidly. "Save that my purse is rather flat..."

The Superior smiled. "No one ever feels their purse is fat enough." He picked up a rolled document:

"You participated in Aragonés's operation—"

"Yes, Your Eminence."

"The report you wrote for Father Komage was quite detailed. Evidently Aragonés's enemies defeated him without any need for your intervention."

"Yes, Your Eminence. Those Chinese had very heavy firepower. And strong will to resist."

"Australians, I believe? They call themselves Australians."

Lando shrugged. "They are unmistakably Chinese, though not of the Ming Dynasty."

"Is Aragonés's ship still under repair?"

"He spends every day in the taverns recruiting sailors. I imagine he'll have difficulty finding enough men—even if he's willing to recruit Chinese sailors."

"They'll send him men from Manila," the Superior said quietly. Though Portugal and Spain were currently under the same crown, relations between them could hardly be called cordial. Macau had yet to raise the royal standard. The Governor in Manila and the nobles there were constantly scheming to bring Macau under their rule.

As an Italian, Geranzani felt an instinctive distaste for the Spanish.

"You are a brave man," the Superior said. "Your loyalty to the Church is plain for all to see—" Something occurred to him. "I hear you've fought the infidels in Montenegro?"

"Yes, as a volunteer," Lando answered proudly. "I could have stayed home and lived in peace, but I went to that mountainous place instead."

"Very good," Geranzani continued. "The time has come for you to demonstrate your talents and distinguish yourself!"

The cunning Italian immediately assumed an expression of "loyal service": "Yours to command!"

"Not mine—the Church's."
