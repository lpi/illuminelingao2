# Chapter 202: Macau Tour

Having established a firm foothold in Guangzhou, Guo Yi and the others decided it was time to convert Lingao's stockpiled war spoils into silver. If they could also secure liquor orders, it would provide a major outlet for waste materials from the upcoming Leizhou sugarcane pressing season.

The Executive Committee approved this new expansion initiative. Considering that the land route into Macau required passing through the Barrier Gate, and that relations between the Ming government and Portuguese Macau had begun to sour, they decided on the simplest approach: entering Macau harbor by sea.

The Portuguese viewed Macau as the jewel of their East Asian trade and were extremely vigilant toward foreigners, but welcomed all Chinese traders—a favorable condition for entry. The Executive Committee also hoped to establish a trading house in Macau if possible, to enable direct overseas exports bypassing Guangzhou.

Macau in 1629 was at the peak of its trading history. The great triangular trade centered on Macau was the most profitable route in international commerce at the time, and the transmigrators naturally had designs on it.

The Guangzhou Forward Station had been allocated a 40-ton single-masted ship by the Executive Committee—between vessels captured at Baitu and ships purchased locally in Hainan, the Committee now controlled a considerable fleet. The sailors were recruited locally in Guangzhou and familiar with the Pearl River estuary's waters.

However, both Guo Yi and Ma Qianzhu agreed that since this Macau trip was the first exploratory mission, it was best not to involve newly hired locals. So they dispatched the 70-ton double-masted ship *Tongji* from Lingao instead. With the Forward Station's limited personnel, only Zhang Xin actually went—he had once worked at a small shipyard on the shores of Dongting Lake and wanted to personally examine Macau's shipbuilding and repair capabilities, as well as observe the Portuguese vessels there.

The remaining personnel were drawn from transmigrators in Lingao. When this news spread, many idle people wanted to see Macau for themselves—mostly hoping to sample foreign women. The justifications for joining were varied: "business inspection" and similar reasons that were clichéd even in their original timespace naturally failed to pass Executive Committee review. But everyone had their tricks: the Industrial Department proposed assessing European industrial technology levels; the Agriculture Department expressed interest in whether European or American agricultural products had been introduced locally; the Finance Department suggested investigating foreign currency systems; and Bair Duo of the Printing Office had a justification that made everyone fall over laughing—"I am a Catholic, so going to Macau will help me interact with the local Portuguese"... In the end, this inspection delegation ballooned to over thirty people, when originally the ship only needed about ten including sailors. Those who received approval were naturally overjoyed, stuffing various modern trinkets into their bags, preparing to emulate those European sailors in Africa and the Americas who used glass beads to seduce native women. Those who didn't get "Macau Tour" slots complained loudly, requiring department heads to pacify them with promises. The resulting turmoil need not be detailed further.

The Macau Commercial Inspection Delegation was led by Wen Desi, with Diana Mendoza accompanying as translator. Zhou Weisen also tagged along under the pretext of looking after his family member—it wouldn't do if this Western mare got disoriented among her compatriots and ran off.

The *Tongji* loaded various sample goods in Guangzhou and picked up Zhang Xin. Old Manager Shen, hearing that Proprietor Zhang was going to Macau, had offered to provide an interpreter to accompany them, but Guo Yi, fearing that their strange-looking group would attract attention, declined. Shen Fan wrote a letter of introduction for a client of his who operated a silk shop in Macau and spoke the foreigners' language. If they needed anything, they could seek his help.

Macau was very close to Guangzhou—strictly speaking, both Macau and Hong Kong could be considered Guangzhou's outer harbors. Administratively, the area belonged to Xiangshan County. Most transmigrators on the ship could recite the history of Portuguese settlement in Macau by heart, and some had even visited in their original timespace. Everyone was extremely curious to see what Macau looked like in this timespace.

As the ship exited the Pearl River estuary into the open sea, Mengde spotted Macau. Everyone gazed into the distance at a tombolo—a land-connected island. A narrow strip of land connected the island to the mainland in a lotus-like shape. Macau was very small; even modern Macau was only 16 square kilometers, and this Macau had not yet expanded its territory, being merely "a city built against the mountain, about four or five *li* in circumference."

On the lotus stem stood a gate structure—this was the Barrier Gate. Anyone traveling overland to Macau had to pass through this gate; theoretically, crossing the Barrier meant crossing the border. In reality, both Ming and Qing governments retained judicial and administrative authority over Macau; it was just that the Portuguese in Macau had long practiced self-governance, and Chinese officials rarely interfered. Macau didn't truly leave Chinese government control until after 1842.

Macau had inner and outer bays. Mengde and the others steered the ship toward the inner bay. From the ship, all of Macau was now clearly visible. This city had been formally permitted for Portuguese residence since 1583—nearly half a century now—and with support from enormous trade profits, urban construction had taken considerable shape. Tall Western-style walls surrounded the city, with prominent fortifications at key positions. The English and Dutch had repeatedly attempted to seize Macau, so the Portuguese Macau authorities took the city's defense very seriously. By 1623, all major fortifications had been completed.

Apparently the Portuguese Macau authorities paid little attention to Chinese ships—entering and leaving the bay was casual, with no interception or inspection. The *Tongji* entered the inner harbor easily. Several Portuguese ships were anchored in the bay. Two large ships with towering masts left a deep impression on everyone. By Wen Desi's estimate, these ships exceeded 1,500 tons—quite impressive for wooden vessels. These were presumably the great ships Portuguese merchants used to run the triangular trade routes. As for local Chinese medium and small wooden boats, they were too numerous to count in the harbor—mostly merchant ships transporting goods from Guangdong and Fujian.

Bai Duoluo, who had used his Catholic faith as an excuse to join the delegation, disembarked with everyone. He didn't know how Director Wen's foreign woman had negotiated with the Portuguese, but everyone went ashore smoothly. Bai Duoluo's English was decent, but here English was as useless as Chinese. As the group walked through the streets of this tiny territory, surrounded by foreign languages and sights, a sense of bewilderment arose in their hearts.

The city layout was completely different from traditional Chinese cities, more reminiscent of a small Spanish town—streets neat and orderly. The small city was centered on a cross-shaped main street. At the intersection stood a tall cross. The buildings along the streets were mostly Iberian-style small buildings with arcaded ground floors. Walls were painted white. From the street, one could see that windows along the way all had closed shutters. Someone thought of serenading beneath such windows with a guitar. Miss Mendoza said in English to Director Wen that this place reminded her of some inland towns in Venezuela. Director Wen thought this was not surprising—both were typical Iberian colonial cities.

As for the people on the streets, they had the quintessential flavor of a colonial city: Portuguese, Chinese, Blacks, and mixed-race people of all combinations were naturally present. There were even many Japanese, mostly wearing Portuguese servants' livery, scurrying back and forth. Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch throughout East and Southeast Asia employed Japanese as servants, craftsmen, sailors, and soldiers. There were also some dark-skinned people with curly hair who looked somewhat like Indians. Shifty-eyed, shabby Southeast Asian natives were also numerous. The streets were bustling and lively: nobles on horseback; ladies in two-person sedan chairs wearing veils and shawls, followed by umbrella-carrying Black slaves. Even thousands of miles from their homeland in this colony, they maintained their original airs. As for sailors of various skin colors in ragged clothes, they naturally formed part of the street scene too—all of them drunk, staggering about. At the gates of wealthy residences sat servants in livery with rattan canes, giving a hard whack to any drunkard who tried to barge in.

At this time, Macau's population had grown considerably. The permanent Portuguese population including their Black slaves numbered around one thousand. Additionally, there were uncounted local Chinese, as well as Indians and Malays stopping over briefly for trade or as sailors.

The group strolled along the streets, looking around. They never found the legendary "tavern with Western hostesses," so Bai Duoluo suggested viewing the famous São Paulo Cathedral before it burned down. Everyone agreed. Following a rough sense of direction to the original site, they discovered major construction underway—the São Paulo Cathedral, or St. Paul's Church, was still being built. The ground was covered with stone and timber, but the craftsmen were all Japanese. Finding someone who spoke Japanese to inquire, they learned the church had been under construction since 1612. Everyone thought the efficiency was truly low—seventeen years of building and the church was still an unfinished shell. Who knew what these Japanese had been doing for seventeen years.

Bai Duoluo used his Catholic status to quickly extract some useful information from the Japanese workers. Most of these people were Kirishitans, and working here was both a livelihood and an offering. The Japanese workers were quite warm toward Bai Duoluo, this Chinese fellow believer. After haltingly reciting some Bible verses together in Latin, the Japanese craftsmen shared much about the local situation.

It turned out that one leg of the great triangular trade that had once made Macau prosperous had already been severed. According to the Japanese: in 1608, a ship from the Arima domain had violently clashed with the Portuguese while passing through Macau. The then-Governor of Macau André Pessoa had suppressed the mutiny of crew members on the Japanese ship, killing many people and executing their leaders. Only at the bishop's intercession had he spared the lives of fifteen prisoners.

When André Pessoa went to Japan to trade in 1610, he encountered fierce retaliation from the Arima domain. The regular trading ship was besieged by 4,000 men. In the end, in despair, André Pessoa ignited the ship's powder magazine. Portuguese trade with Japan had been severed ever since.
