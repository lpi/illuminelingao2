# Chapter 192: Sending Warmth

Movies and fireworks pushed the New Year's Eve celebrations to their peak. The cinema screened a Hong Kong New Year comedy next. Near and far, firecrackers punctuated the night. Ma Qianzhu had no interest in watching more movies. He rose to leave—he still had things to do.

Outside, Wu De was waiting with seven or eight laborers pushing wheelbarrows. Then Xiao Zishan and the others arrived. Several regularly visible Executive Committee commissioners split up to "deliver warmth."

As the transmigrator enterprise expanded, local employment had grown increasingly vital. Keeping these workers loyal became critically important. The Executive Committee divided responsibilities, with various commissioners visiting locations on condolence missions.

Wang Luobin headed to Salt Field Village, bringing New Year goods for Du Wen, who ran the Salt Field Peasant Training Institute and commanded the stationed detachment. He also carried military pay, condolence money, and letters for Salt Field Village soldiers serving in the New Army. Xiong Buyu and Yang Baogui went to Damei Village with a cartload of salt and several barrels of fish as gifts. Damei Village was slated to become an important livestock base for the Agricultural Department, so Yang Baogui went to survey local conditions. Both groups departed during the day and returned by evening.

Ma Qianzhu went to the hospital, where over thirty battle-wounded from Bopu were being treated.

Bairren General Hospital blazed with light. Upon entering, Ma Qianzhu found every doctor on duty—including veterinarian Yang Baogui. Not one had gone to watch movies or wander about. He was deeply moved. Rushing into the duty room, he grasped Shi Niaoren's hand.

"You've worked hard, Doctor Shi!"

Shi Niaoren startled, then recognized Ma Qianzhu. "Commissioner Ma works hard too! Coming to the hospital for inspection so late?"

"I'm here to visit the wounded." Workers were already carrying in condolence items.

"The Executive Committee is very thoughtful." Shi Niaoren had wanted to remind the committee, but clearly they'd thought of everything. "Your coming will greatly stabilize morale among the wounded."

"Why? There's been unrest?"

"Didn't I send a report on the wounded situation? Ten are definitely disabled." Shi Niaoren rang a small bell. A demure woman in a light-blue nurse's uniform with a brimless round cap entered. On her chest hung a blue snake-and-olive-branch badge—the Health Department had decided against the red cross due to its religious connotations, adopting the WHO symbol instead. Blue was chosen for nurse uniforms considering local customs—full white meant mourning and might distress the wounded.

"Make tea for Commissioner Ma."

The woman softly acknowledged and left. Shortly she returned with a cup of hot tea.

"Who is this? She doesn't look like a nursing school student assigned to you." Ma Qianzhu remained vigilant. The woman appeared thirty-five or thirty-six—women of that age were typically assigned to commune labor departments.

"She's Wu Nanhai's woman," Shi Niaoren said casually. "She also has a daughter, still at the farm. When I wanted her, that fellow wouldn't give her up."

"What?" Ma Qianzhu's jaw nearly dropped. He knew Wu Nanhai well—chubby, kindly-faced, a standard good person. So he was two-timing mother and daughter? Truly, appearances deceive.

Shi Niaoren saw his shocked expression and realized the misunderstanding. He hastily explained, "She came from Wu Nanhai's Agricultural Department. She's the mother-daughter pair Zhang Xingjiao brought back from Gou Manor a few months ago."

"Oh, them." He'd forgotten until reminded. Looking more carefully at this nurse, though thin, she had delicate features.

"In the inpatient ward, we currently have seventeen New Army wounded and eight worker wounded. Ten are definitely disabled." Shi Niaoren's voice grew somber. "These men are in very low spirits. There's a young soldier who keeps crying, asking why they saved him, why they didn't just finish him off on the spot."

"Why? Is the disability that severe?" Ma Qianzhu found this strange.

"He's an artilleryman. Half his face is severely burned—horribly disfigured." Shi Niaoren sighed. "We have no one here for plastic surgery—"

Ma Qianzhu nodded.

"All the disabled feel this way. Those who've lost legs or arms say their futures are hopeless—better to die cleanly—"

"Disabled veterans will naturally be supported by us. What is there to say?" Ma Qianzhu's expression hardened with resolve.

"The problem is they don't know that." Shi Niaoren sipped his tea. "Director, why weren't such policies clearly explained to everyone beforehand? It really affects morale."

Ma Qianzhu felt a pang of shame. "When you haven't faced it, you don't think of it."

"Good thing you've thought of it now." Shi Niaoren relaxed somewhat. "Since you're here, you might as well handle everything at once. Our medicine supply problem needs quick resolution."

"Tell me your requirements. We'll resolve everything at the post-holiday planning meeting."

"Truthfully, too few things can currently be produced locally. Medical standards will be hard to maintain." Shi Niaoren laid out the situation plainly.

So far, they could only supply distilled water, medical alcohol, cotton bandages, and absorbent cotton. Strictly speaking, the cotton bandages were substitutes, not comparable to proper gauze. The absorbent cotton had been made as a byproduct when Li Di was producing nitrocellulose.

"Having the Industrial Department produce these things simply doesn't work. They have no concept of medical products. We need a pharmaceutical supply factory under Health Department management."

"Done!" Ma Qianzhu knew this was reasonable and agreed readily.

"Also the glassware issue." Shi Niaoren pressed on. "The pharmaceutical factory will need large quantities of glassware as production equipment. I hope the Executive Committee can prioritize the Health Department when the time comes—I know glass will be our money-making item, but if we can mass-produce modern antibiotics, the impact would far exceed glass cups and mirrors."

"What did you say? Mass-produce antibiotics?" Ma Qianzhu grew excited. Having penicillin in this spacetime was like possessing atomic bombs. With this, transmigrators would have incomparable medical advantages, able to penetrate and transform every social stratum through modern medicine. When Western missionaries evangelized undeveloped regions, their methods were twofold: education and medicine. The results had been remarkable.

"Correct, antibiotics." Shi Niaoren confirmed. "The Health Department has many bacterial cultures, but current conditions don't allow mass cultivation and production." Reading Ma Qianzhu's thoughts, he added, "Actually, it's not just antibiotics. Many medications aren't difficult to manufacture. Then we can launch a medicine-to-the-countryside campaign—"

"Excellent! The masses lack medicine and doctors. That's what they need most!" Ma Qianzhu rose excitedly, then suddenly remembered his original purpose. "Come, take me to visit the wounded."

Ma Qianzhu toured each ward. Though stuck in the seventeenth century with simple conditions, the hospital's construction was anything but shoddy. The building formed a two-story ring around an open-air courtyard. The courtyard was paved with green bricks and furnished with benches where patients could sunbathe and breathe fresh air. The inpatient ward occupied the rear building, its wooden floors scrubbed spotlessly clean, its walls whitewashed bright. Patient rooms held four beds each with electric lighting for convenient care and observation.

Ma Qianzhu first visited the lightly wounded, distributing gifts. Nothing fancy—they had neither canned goods nor health supplements, not even candy. Just salt and rice tickets in red paper envelopes. The wounded were delighted nonetheless. Though injured, at least they'd survived without losing limbs. Here they ate well, drank well, and received treatment from the chiefs' doctors, cared for attentively by young nurses. They wouldn't trade this for working for any landlord.

The disabled ward was deathly silent. Ma Qianzhu handed out red envelopes but saw only gloomy faces. Finally someone spoke: "Thank the chiefs for your kindness—treating our wounds, having people look after us with good food and drink. Once we can move, we'll leave right away—"

"Leave?" Ma Qianzhu was startled, then immediately understood. These disabled soldiers thought his red envelopes were severance pay. Mixed emotions welled up. *Don't let heroes shed blood then tears.* These men might not be heroes, but they'd been wounded and disabled for the transmigrator cause. He raised both hands and spoke loudly.

"Don't overthink things." His voice was earnest. "You were wounded for the transmigrator collective. The collective will support you for life! Not just support—we'll make sure you live with dignity and honor!"

Several wounded heard this. Their eyes brightened slightly, then dimmed again. The young soldier with half his face bandaged said, "My face is ruined. Who'll want to marry me?"

"There will be someone. There definitely will." Ma Qianzhu spoke with conviction. "If truly no one's willing, I'll buy you a virgin bride!"

The moment he said it, he felt rather beastly. If Little Du were here, she'd definitely kick him in the groin.

"Really? You're not lying?!"

"Have we transmigrators ever lied? When have we ever deceived anyone?" Ma Qianzhu spoke boldly. "Not just you—all disabled brothers will get wives, houses, good lives. Our word is our bond." Seeing lingering doubt, he swore an oath. "If not, may Heaven strike me dead!"

"My hands still work. No need to support me—just find me a job I can do sitting down!" someone called out.

"I've only got one arm, but I can still drive a cart."

...

The wounded chimed in one after another, expressing determination not to be freeloaders. The atmosphere grew lively. Ma Qianzhu felt a surge of emotion: what fine comrades! Truly, working people had the most beautiful hearts. But arrangements for disabled veterans' employment weren't finalized yet—he couldn't speak carelessly. He raised his hands again. "We'll consider everyone's suggestions. We'll definitely let everyone live in peace. Your only job now is to recover. The transmigrators and the people will not forget you."

Wu De took several people to collect warmth-sending items from the Planning Committee. He'd planned this carefully. The commune had many people—he couldn't visit every household. But he knew exactly which ones needed visiting: bachelors and outsiders with no family, no property, no relatives. New Year was particularly bleak for them.

The bachelor dormitory was still awake. They maintained the tradition of staying up for New Year's Eve, keeping oil lamps lit, drinking a little wine, occasionally listening to distant firecrackers. Wu De's appearance surprised everyone. No one expected the commune's highest official to visit the dormitory on this night of family reunions. Even those asleep were woken.

Wu De spotted Lin Xing there too. This vice-director was also a bachelor without relatives. He'd changed into new clothes today with a New Year's picture posted by his bed—somewhat festive. Wu De smiled. "Your place actually has some New Year spirit."

"I've been working as a laborer since I was fourteen." Lin Xing returned the smile. "Finding joy in bitterness. No family, but I pretend I have one."

"Good, well said. No family, but pretend you have one." Wu De surveyed the commune members and workers staring at him with surprised eyes. "Since everyone's making a living at Bairren Commune, this place is your home now. Come, let's share a drink." He opened the wine jar he'd brought. "Fill up, everyone. Let's all drink a bowl together."

The wine was glutinous rice yellow wine from outside—sweet-tasting, low alcohol. Nothing difficult for Wu De. After drinking, the initially reserved workers gradually loosened up. Wu De seized the opportunity to distribute condolence items—nothing particularly good: betel nut, dried fish, dried sweet potato strips, sunflower seeds, and similar fare. But even this moved everyone deeply. New Year's Eve, and the shorthair big chief coming to visit rough laborers like them! Never mind the gifts—just the face was enough. When had they ever been treated so respectfully working for landlords?

Leaving the group dormitory, he visited families with elderly and children, giving each household a five-kilogram rice ticket and a one-bolt cloth ticket. By regulations, elderly and children of workers couldn't be assigned work and didn't qualify for cafeteria meals. Though workers could get extra work-point compensation for dependents, life was still tighter than average.

"Lin Xing, do you think families with many young children eat enough?" Wu De asked on the walk back after visiting the last household.

"They eat enough. Just eat worse." Lin Xing was candid.

"Oh? One worker's daily work-points shouldn't buy enough grain for that—"

"Certainly can't eat pure rice every meal. But each family has private plots for sweet potatoes and such. Adding that, it's enough."

"That's still too hard." Wu De felt the worker treatment was too harsh.

"Not hard at all." Lin Xing seemed puzzled. "Growing sweet potatoes doesn't take much labor. Three or four months yields plenty. In the past, everyone barely scraped by meal to meal. Sweet potato porridge was considered good food."

"The children are too thin." Wu De sighed.
