# Chapter 192: Sending Warmth

Movies and fireworks pushed New Year's Eve celebrations to their peak. The cinema then screened Hong Kong New Year comedy. Near and far, firecrackers could be heard. Ma Qianzhu had no interest in watching more movies. He stood up to leave—he still had things to do.

Walking outside, Wu De was waiting with seven or eight laborers pushing wheelbarrows. Then Xiao Zishan and others arrived. Several regularly visible Executive Committee commissioners split up to "send warmth."

As the transmigrator enterprise expanded, they increasingly needed to employ locals. Keeping them loyal became critically important. The Executive Committee roughly divided responsibilities, visiting various locations on condolence missions.

Wang Luobin went to Salt Field Village, bringing New Year goods to Du Wen who was running the Salt Field Peasant Training Institute and the stationed detachment. He also brought military pay, condolence money, and letters for Salt Field Village soldiers serving in the New Army. Xiong Buyu and Yang Baogui went to Damei Village, bringing a cartload of salt and several barrels of fish as gifts. Damei Village would become an important livestock base for the Agricultural Department, so Yang Baogui went to survey local conditions. Both groups departed during the day and returned by evening.

Ma Qianzhu went to the hospital, where over thirty battle-wounded from Bopu were being treated.

Bairren General Hospital was brightly lit. Entering, Ma Qianzhu found all doctors—including veterinarian Yang Baogui—on duty at the hospital. Not one had gone to watch movies or wander around. He was particularly moved. He rushed into the duty room and grasped Shi Niaoren's hand:

"You've worked hard, Doctor Shi!"

Shi Niaoren was startled, then saw Ma Qianzhu. He quickly said: "Commissioner Ma works hard! Coming to the hospital for inspection so late?"

"I'm here to visit the wounded." Workers were already bringing in various condolence items.

"The Executive Committee is very thoughtful." Shi Niaoren had wanted to remind the Executive Committee, but now he saw they'd thought of everything. "Your coming will greatly stabilize the wounded's morale."

"Why? There's been unrest?"

"Didn't I report on the wounded situation? Ten people are definitely disabled." Shi Niaoren rang a small bell. A demure woman in light-blue cloth nurse's uniform with brimless round cap entered. On her chest was a blue snake-and-olive-branch badge—the Health Department had decided not to use the red cross as their symbol due to its religious connotations, adopting the WHO symbol instead. Blue was chosen for nurse uniforms considering local customs, avoiding distressing the wounded—full white was for mourning.

"Make tea for Commissioner Ma."

The woman softly acknowledged and left. Shortly she brought Ma Qianzhu a cup of hot tea.

"Who is this? She doesn't look like a nursing school student assigned to you." Ma Qianzhu was still vigilant. This woman appeared thirty-five or thirty-six—women of this age were all assigned to commune labor departments.

"She's Wu Nanhai's woman." Shi Niaoren said casually. "She also has a daughter. Still at the farm. When I wanted her, that fellow wouldn't even give her up!"

"What?" Ma Qianzhu's jaw nearly dropped. He knew Wu Nanhai well: chubby, kindly-faced, a standard good person. So he was two-timing mother and daughter? Truly, appearances deceive.

Shi Niaoren saw his shocked expression and realized the misunderstanding. He hastily explained: "She came from Wu Nanhai's Agricultural Department. She's the mother-daughter pair Zhang Xingjiao brought back from Gou Manor a few months ago."

"Oh, them." He'd forgotten until reminded. Looking more carefully at this female nurse, though thin, she was delicate-featured.

"Currently in the inpatient ward, there are 17 New Army wounded and 8 worker wounded. Ten are definitely disabled." Shi Niaoren said. "These men are in very low spirits. There's a young soldier who keeps crying, asking why they saved him, why didn't they just finish him off on the spot."

"Why? Is the disability that severe?" Ma Qianzhu found this strange.

"He's an artilleryman. Half his face is severely burned—disfigured horribly." Shi Niaoren sighed. "We have no one here for plastic surgery—"

Ma Qianzhu nodded.

"All the disabled feel this way. Those who've lost legs or arms say their future lives are hopeless—better to die cleanly—"

"Disabled veterans will naturally be supported by us. What is there to say?" Ma Qianzhu looked resolute.

"The problem is they don't know that." Shi Niaoren sipped his tea. "Director, why weren't such policies clearly explained to everyone beforehand? It really affects morale."

Ma Qianzhu felt somewhat ashamed: "When you haven't faced it, you don't think of it."

"Good thing you've thought of it now." Shi Niaoren relaxed. "Since you're here, might as well handle everything at once. Our medicine supply problem needs quick resolution."

"Tell me your requirements. We'll resolve everything at the post-holiday planning meeting."

"Truthfully, too few things can currently be produced locally. Medical standards will be hard to maintain." Shi Niaoren said.

So far, they could only supply distilled water, medical alcohol, cotton bandages, and absorbent cotton. Strictly speaking, cotton bandages were just substitutes, not comparable to gauze. The absorbent cotton had been made as a byproduct when Li Di was making nitrocellulose.

"Having the Industrial Department produce these things simply doesn't work. They have no concept of medical products. We need a pharmaceutical supply factory under Health Department management."

"Done!" Ma Qianzhu knew this was reasonable and agreed readily.

"Also the glassware issue." Shi Niaoren said. "The pharmaceutical factory will need large quantities of glassware as production equipment. I hope the Executive Committee can prioritize the Health Department when the time comes—I know glass will be our money-making item, but if we can mass-produce modern antibiotics, the impact would far exceed glass cups and mirrors."

"What did you say? Mass-produce antibiotics?" Ma Qianzhu grew excited. Having penicillin in this spacetime was like having atomic bombs. With this, transmigrators would have incomparable medical advantages, able to penetrate and transform all social strata through modern medicine. When Western missionaries went to undeveloped regions for evangelism, their methods were just two: education and medicine. The effects were remarkable.

"Correct, antibiotics." Shi Niaoren confirmed. "The Health Department has many bacterial cultures, but current conditions don't allow mass cultivation and production." Seeing through Ma Qianzhu's thoughts, he added: "Actually, it's not just antibiotics. Many medications aren't difficult to manufacture. Then we can do a medicine-to-the-countryside campaign—"

"Excellent! The masses lack medicine and doctors. They need this most!" Ma Qianzhu stood up excitedly. Suddenly remembering his original purpose: "Come, take me to visit the wounded."

Ma Qianzhu visited each ward. Though stuck in the 17th century with simple conditions, the hospital's construction was anything but shoddy. The hospital was a two-story ring-shaped building with an open-air courtyard in the center. The courtyard was paved with green bricks with benches where patients could sunbathe and get fresh air. The inpatient ward was in the rear building, with wooden floors throughout, scrubbed spotlessly clean. Walls were whitewashed. Patient rooms had four beds each, with electric lighting—for convenient care and observation.

Ma Qianzhu first visited the lightly wounded, giving them gifts. Nothing special really—they had neither canned goods nor health supplements, not even candy. Just salt and rice tickets in red paper envelopes. The wounded were all delighted. Though injured, at least they'd survived without losing limbs. Here they were eating and drinking well, being treated by the "chiefs'" doctors, cared for by young "nurses" attentively and thoroughly. Wouldn't trade this for working for a landlord.

The disabled ward was deathly quiet. Ma Qianzhu handed out red envelopes but saw everyone looking gloomy. Finally someone spoke: "Thank the chiefs for your kindness, treating our wounds, having people look after us with good food and drink. Once we can move, we'll leave right away—"

"Leave?" Ma Qianzhu was startled, immediately understanding these disabled soldiers thought his red envelopes were severance pay. Mixed emotions welled up. Don't let heroes shed blood then tears. These men might not be heroes, but they'd been wounded and disabled for the transmigrator cause. He raised both hands and said loudly:

"Don't overthink things." Ma Qianzhu said earnestly. "You were wounded for the transmigrator collective. The collective will support you for life! Not just support—we'll make sure you live with dignity and honor!"

Several wounded heard this. Their eyes brightened slightly then dimmed again. The young soldier with half his face bandaged said: "My face is ruined. Who'll want to marry me?"

"There will be someone. There definitely will." Ma Qianzhu said resolutely. "If truly no one's willing, I'll buy you a virgin bride!"

After saying this, he felt rather beastly himself. If Little Du were here, she'd definitely kick him in the crotch.

"Really? You're not lying?!"

"Have we transmigrators ever lied? When have we ever deceived anyone?" Ma Qianzhu spoke boldly. "Not just you—all disabled brothers will get wives, houses, good lives. Our word is our bond." Seeing lingering doubt, he simply swore an oath: "If not, may Heaven strike me dead!"

"My hands still work. No need to support me—just find me a job I can do sitting down!" someone said.

"I've only got one arm, but I can still drive a cart."

...

The wounded all chimed in, expressing determination not to be freeloaders. The atmosphere grew lively. Ma Qianzhu felt a surge of emotion: what fine comrades! Truly, working people have the most beautiful hearts. But arrangements for disabled veterans' employment weren't finalized yet—he couldn't speak carelessly. He quickly raised his hands again: "We'll consider everyone's suggestions. We'll definitely let everyone live in peace. Your only job now is to recover. The transmigrators and the people will not forget you."

Wu De took several people to collect warmth-sending items from the Planning Committee. He'd long planned this. The commune had many people—he couldn't visit every household. But he knew exactly which ones to visit: bachelors and outsiders with no family, no property, no relatives. New Year was particularly bleak for them.

The bachelor dormitory was still awake. They maintained the "staying up for New Year's Eve" custom, keeping oil lamps lit, drinking a little wine, occasionally listening to distant firecrackers. Wu De's appearance surprised everyone. No one expected the commune's highest official to visit the dormitory on this night of family reunions. Even those asleep were woken.

Wu De saw Lin Xing there too. This vice-director was also a bachelor without relatives. He'd changed into new clothes today with a New Year's picture posted by his bed—somewhat festive. Wu De smiled: "Your place actually has some New Year spirit."

"I've been working as a laborer since I was fourteen." Lin Xing smiled. "Finding joy in bitterness. No family, but I pretend I have one."

"Good, well said. No family, but pretend you have one." Wu De looked at these commune members and workers staring at him with surprised eyes. "Since everyone's making a living at Bairren Commune, this place is your home now. Come, let's share a drink." He opened the wine jar he'd brought. "Fill up, everyone. Let's all drink a bowl together."

The wine was glutinous rice yellow wine from outside—sweet-tasting, low alcohol. Nothing difficult for Wu De. After drinking, the initially reserved workers gradually became animated. Wu De took the opportunity to distribute condolence items—nothing especially good: betel nut, dried fish, dried sweet potato strips, sunflower seeds, and such. But even this moved everyone deeply. New Year's Eve, and the shorthair big chief coming to visit rough laborers like them. Never mind the gifts—just the face was enough! When had they ever been treated so respectfully working for landlords?

Leaving the group dormitory, he visited families with elderly and children, giving each household a 5-kilogram rice ticket and a 1-bolt cloth ticket—by regulations, elderly and children of workers couldn't be assigned work and didn't qualify for cafeteria meals. Though workers could get extra work-point compensation for dependents, life was still tighter than average.

"Lin Xing, do you think families with many young children eat enough?" Wu De asked on the walk back after visiting the last household.

"They eat enough. Just eat worse." Lin Xing was candid.

"Oh? One worker's daily work-points shouldn't buy enough grain for that—"

"Certainly can't eat pure rice every meal. But each family has private plots for sweet potatoes and such. Adding that, it's enough."

"That's still too hard." Wu De felt the worker treatment was too harsh.

"Not hard at all." Lin Xing seemed puzzled. "Growing sweet potatoes doesn't take much labor. Three or four months yields plenty. In the past, everyone barely had enough meal to meal. Sweet potato porridge was considered good food."

"The children are too thin." Wu De sighed.
