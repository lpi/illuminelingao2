# Chapter 205 - The Missionary Question

"Yes, Your Eminence." Lando remained perfectly respectful. But the Superior knew very well that beneath this man's seemingly deferential cleverness lay a kind of arrogance he couldn't comprehend—as if Lando himself were omniscient and omnipotent like God, though he worked hard to conceal it.

*This scoundrel*, he thought. *If God permits me to live long enough, I'll hand him over to the Inquisitors in the Philippines and let those fanatical Dominican friars deal with him.*

For now, however, he assumed an air of nonchalance: "Very well, remember this—you must not allow him to triumph over Nicolás. Whatever else Aragonés wants to do, let him. Except—" He thought for a moment. "The Australians over in Qiongzhou Prefecture—"

"You mean those strange Chinese on Hainan Island."

"Yes, call them what you will. You understand my meaning." He considered further. "If Aragonés is sensible, he won't provoke them again. But if he does, you may lend them a hand—I imagine they'd welcome your assistance."

"Yes, Your Eminence."

"Go see Father Komage. He'll give you fifty silver pesos, and then you may proceed."

"Your Eminence, if I'm to board Aragonés's ship, I'll need to settle my hotel bills here, not to mention my tab at the tavern. I'm an old soldier, penniless as they come, and undertaking a dangerous mission requires considerable funds."

"Father Komage gave you one hundred silver pesos last time."

"That money's already spent. You know I have no savings here—just to survive, I've gone into debt."

Geranzani pondered for a moment, then walked reluctantly toward a Chinese lacquer cabinet inlaid with mother-of-pearl and secured with three locks. From inside he produced a money pouch and weighed it in his hand.

"Take it. This is two hundred silver pesos."

Lando bowed to the Superior and stuffed the pouch into his pocket.

"Very well, you may go." The Superior made the sign of the cross over him solemnly. "When serving God, you need not scruple about anything. You know: the Society of Jesus has the authority to absolve even the gravest of sins."

Lando bowed deeply, kissed his ring, and withdrew.

When the sound of the door behind the curtain closing reached his ears, the Superior let out a soft sigh.

Without looking in any direction, he ordered: "Ambroise, please show Manager Wen and his party in."

Lando descended a staircase known only to those within the organization and emerged into the courtyard. Quite pleased with himself, he patted the money pouch at his waist—serving the Jesuits really was a wise choice. Such generous people.

Just as he was thinking this, he noticed a priest leading several people toward him. Lando's heart stirred. He quickened his pace and slipped into the shadows beneath the eaves of the corridor.

When he saw their close-cropped hair and the blue training uniforms they wore, he smiled faintly. He waited until they had entered the building before emerging.

"Well, well," Lando murmured thoughtfully. "You Australians!"

---

"Welcome, Manager Wen." Geranzani rose to greet these oddly dressed figures. He had long heard they were people who wore strange clothing, but examining them up close, their attire was simple and the fabric unremarkable, though the style bore some resemblance to European fashion. As for their extremely short-cropped hair, he actually found it rather agreeable.

Wen Desi gave a slight bow. The priest before him wore an elegant black cassock, had black and slightly curly hair, and wore a warm, charming smile.

Geranzani's Chinese, by the standards of the time, was quite good, though an accent was unavoidable. The combined differences of era and nationality made communication rather laborious. Wen Desi proposed they switch to a language both parties could understand accurately.

"Let us speak Latin." With that, he called Diana Mendoza over—this Master's graduate in English Language and Literature also knew Latin.

Miss Mendoza, meeting a genuine priest for the first time in this timeline, became so excited she forgot herself and immediately knelt to kiss his ring. This surprised and delighted Geranzani—evidently there were quite a few of the Lord's faithful among the Australians. Moreover, this beautiful congregant was clearly not Chinese—her appearance reminded him of the women from his homeland, equally charming and vivacious.

With such a good start, the ensuing discussion naturally became "friendly and constructive." Geranzani was extremely interested in the transmigrators' origins, particularly this Australia they mentioned. This was an age of geographical discovery, and Europeans were fascinated by such news—every new geographical discovery meant fresh opportunities for wealth, land, and power. Wen Desi, of course, refused to reveal where this so-called Australia actually was: knowing European greed, once they learned such a fine place existed, they'd swarm there immediately. In fact, Australia had already been discovered by this time—in 1606, Spanish navigator Torres had sailed through the strait between Australia and New Guinea; that same year, the Dutchman Willem Janszoon aboard the *Duyfken* had touched Australian shores, earning it the name "New Holland." However, these discoveries had produced no significant impact—the discovers considered New Holland barren and worthless. It wasn't until 1770, when British navigator Captain Cook discovered the fertile east coast, that Australian colonization truly began. Naturally, in this timeline, the transmigrators had claimed Australia as their future exclusive territory.

Wen Desi not only spoke vaguely but even performed a geographical sleight of hand, relocating Australia to the vast center of the Pacific Ocean—if they were interested, they could go sail around in circles searching for it.

As for their national history, it was simply the story from the *Captive's Handbook*.

Unexpectedly, this fabrication aroused the Superior's intense interest. He kept pressing with questions, forcing Diana Mendoza to frequently pause and think before translating into English—Wen Desi could understand English well enough. As it turned out, the fellow had taken Australia for the lost continent of Atlantis.

Then he posed more questions: Where had Australia's church come from? Who was its leader? Where had its scriptures originated? Was the Australian church aware of the Curia's existence? Since the Australian Bible had been translated into Chinese, who had done the translation? This barrage of questions nearly made Wen Desi roll his eyes—this Superior's thirst for knowledge was truly insatiable.

Fortunately, Bai Duoluo hadn't completely lost his bearings and talked nonsense, Wen Desi thought. Otherwise, after his rambling, I'd have no way to spin my tale. He at least knew what was important: when speaking with the priest, he had claimed to be of humble status with little knowledge of national affairs, deflecting every question with professions of ignorance.

Wen Desi hadn't prepared much for fabricating the transmigrators' religious system, but he didn't want to leave the Jesuits with the impression that they were enthusiastic about the Catholic Church—though many people, himself included, hoped to use Catholicism to develop an entirely new religious system to replace the religious beliefs in their future territories. Since they might cooperate, he should set his price high—you want to do missionary work? Fine, but you'll have to pay an adequate price.

Having decided on his approach, Wen Desi said the church had always existed in Australia, but as for when it had arrived and the origins of its scriptures, even the local church itself couldn't say. As for more details about the church, he himself didn't really understand them either, since he wasn't a believer.

His casual description clearly disappointed the Superior. Geranzani had originally thought this country that had appeared out of nowhere might be a lost Christian nation like the legendary Prester John's kingdom. He hadn't expected that those in power weren't Christians at all. Looking at the seven or eight visitors, apart from one Bai Duoluo and the Latina woman before him, there probably weren't many believers among them.

The subsequent conversation focused mainly on the transmigrators' presence in Hainan. Wen Desi didn't conceal their intentions on this matter, only making their strategic objectives sound smaller—their purpose in occupying Linggao was to use the location's geography for trade with the Ming Dynasty. He specifically pointed out that the transmigrator collective had goods the Ming people loved, enough to exchange for large quantities of silver and other commodities. Some products might also appeal to Southeast Asians and Europeans, but they lacked sufficient ships and sailors, so they hoped to find foreign agents in Macau.

Wen Desi was very careful to conceal the transmigrators' ambitions regarding foreign trade routes. He knew this was an extremely sensitive matter for middlemen like the Portuguese. However, providing profitable goods was something the Portuguese would welcome, just as Chinese merchants supplied them with raw silk, silk fabrics, and porcelain that could be sold at high prices in both Japan and Manila. He wasn't clear to what extent the Jesuits were tied to Portuguese commercial interests, but undoubtedly some entanglement of shared interests existed between them.

Geranzani thought that the Australians' appearance had given his missionary work an entirely new opportunity. Though Australia wasn't the Christian nation he had imagined, judging from these people's attitude, they not only had considerable knowledge of the Church but were tolerant and approving of it. If these Australians could gain power over Hainan Island, the Lord's flock on this eastern island would greatly increase. Better yet, if the Jesuits could persuade their leaders to be baptized, perhaps someone here would become Hainan's Saint Stephen. (Note: King of Hungary, who after baptism made Hungary a Christian nation.)

Hainan Island was no unfamiliar place to Geranzani in Macau: as early as 1560, Father Gogo had ventured onto the island. In 1563, three Jesuit priests not only entered Hainan but even penetrated into the government's forbidden territory—the Li minority regions. In 1584, Franciscans from Spanish Philippines, en route to their mission in Vietnam, had shipwrecked on Hainan's coast, been arrested by local authorities there, and were later released and returned to Manila.

The greatest advantage for Hainan missions was Wang Honghui. It was this native of Ding'an in Qiongzhou, serving as Minister of Rites in Nanjing, who had planned and guided Matteo Ricci's entry into Beijing in 1598. Though on the surface Wang Honghui had brought missionaries into Beijing to help revise the calendar, the deeper reason was that this quasi-Catholic hoped to use this opportunity to help Ricci conduct missionary activities. His son had subsequently converted to Catholicism, taking the Christian name Paul. This meant the Church had for the first time obtained the support of influential local figures for missionary work in Hainan. Geranzani knew that Paul had visited Macau several times recently, requesting that priests be dispatched to Ding'an County for missionary work. If they could also obtain such powerful missionary support in Linggao County on Hainan's northwest coast, this would be nothing less than a major breakthrough in Eastern missionary activities. Geranzani was elated at this prospect.

His thoughts were entirely as Wen Desi had anticipated: Geranzani indeed expressed his hope for missionary work. Wen Desi, following his mental script, said this wasn't something he could decide on his own.

"According to our system, such important matters must be decided by a vote of the Five Hundred."

"A parliament of gentlemen, then?"

"Precisely." Wen Desi thought that while there were certainly some among the five hundred who had come with Communist ideals, most of them still just wanted to be lords over others.

"You have five hundred gentlemen in Linggao!" Geranzani exclaimed. "Portugal doesn't have that many gentlemen in all of Macau!"

Wen Desi smiled modestly in response.

"Since your polity constrains such decisions, I am willing to await the result. However, before you reach the correct conclusion, might you permit me to send a servant of God back with you? I assure you, he will not engage in missionary work until he receives formal permission."

Wen Desi hesitated briefly, thinking that a missionary who didn't know the language couldn't cause much of a stir—they could just assign someone to keep an eye on him. Besides, you make your offer and I'll make mine. Let's have an equal exchange.
