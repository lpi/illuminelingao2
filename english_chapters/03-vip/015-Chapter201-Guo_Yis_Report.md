# Chapter 201: Guo Yi's Report

As night fell over Guangzhou, lanterns lit up in homes across the city. But for shopkeepers closing up for the day, this was the anxious hour of tallying the day's labors. Old Manager Shen of Zizhenzhai was among them—his brow furrowed as he examined the ledger, his expression uneasy, punctuated by occasional sighs. An outside observer would surely assume the old man was worried about Zizhenzhai's dismal business. After all, it had been nearly half a month since the shop opened after the Lantern Festival. The general situation should be clear by now. But reality was quite different from what outsiders might imagine.

Old Manager Shen had only come to Zizhenzhai to fulfill a promise. Though he'd witnessed the shop's capabilities, he didn't believe that Guo Yi—a man with no background and no influence—could quickly establish himself in Guangzhou's fiercely competitive business circles. These several proprietors had each demonstrated remarkable abilities during the opening preparations, yet Shen still harbored worries, fearing the bosses might overreach, spreading themselves too thin across multiple ventures. However, Zizhenzhai's transformation in the month after opening had completely exceeded his expectations.

On the thin ledger spread across the table, certain figures leaped out: "January 20th: One pair of Western crystal cups, fifty taels silver, on account; Mr. Liu of Liu Residence. One exquisite chiming clock, one hundred taels silver, on account; Mr. Wang of Baixianlou. Three Dragon-Eye Pearl necklaces, 1,200 taels, Mr. Chen of Chen Grain Depot, on account. Three Southern Barbarian Seven-Color Mood paintings, 600 taels silver, Young Master He of the Commander's Residence, paid in full..." The ledger total exceeded 12,112 taels.

In forty years in the trade, Shen Fan had certainly seen such figures before. But this was merely Zizhenzhai's sales in just over ten days since opening. Even for someone of Shen Fan's vast experience, Zizhenzhai's money-making prowess was truly terrifying. He had only introduced Guo to some wealthy acquaintances in Guangzhou, yet the proprietor could perfectly gauge their preferences and produce items that captivated them. His ability to read people and understand their desires left Shen in awe.

As for the other two proprietors—one spent all day at the workshop site supervising workers making liquor, while the other tinkered with jewelry alongside craftsmen. Shen had seen many proprietors and managers in his time, but never one who could mix so easily with smoke-blackened craftsmen, laughing and joking together. He'd never imagined that Proprietor Yan was actually a craftsman by background, with exceptional skills that would earn him good wages even at the largest local jewelry house. How had Proprietor Guo—clearly from a wealthy family by his bearing—come to partner with a craftsman for business?

These thoughts he kept to himself, never showing them outwardly. Each day he received visiting dignitaries at the shop, handled managers and servants sent to select goods, and dispatched capable assistants with samples and catalogs to make calls. With his own introduction and Baohengxiang's experienced staff, business proceeded smoothly.

What surprised him most was that Proprietor Guo, who rarely interfered with shop operations, had implemented an entirely new system before opening. First, all staff were divided by function into sales, laborers, and craftsmen, each category with different levels earning different treatment. Sales personnel earned more than laborers; craftsmen were paid according to their abilities. This system was completely novel to Shen Fan.

Sales personnel, besides fixed monthly salaries, earned commissions on their sales—commissions to be calculated and paid after the three festival settlements each year. Shen Fan roughly estimated his own earnings and was shocked: under this new system, his commission for this month alone would exceed thirty taels—while his highest annual salary before retirement had been only 240 taels. Shen Fan shook his head, thinking he must be confused, and recalculated on the abacus. The same result.

At this rate, wouldn't he earn over 300 taels in commissions annually? Shen Fan was almost dumbstruck. His current monthly salary was already generous—360 taels per year, the highest among all jewelry shop managers in Guangzhou. Add commissions on top of that...

He shook his head repeatedly. This wouldn't do. As manager, how could he take commissions? Better to let the young salesmen—Proprietor Guo called them "business staff"—earn it.

As for the craftsmen and laborers, Proprietor Guo treated them well too, paying generously for good skills. The highest-paid jewelry craftsman could earn nearly ten taels monthly; even the lowest made five *qian*.

Finally, Proprietor Guo announced year-end profit sharing: annual profits would be divided into thirteen shares. The proprietors took ten shares; all sales staff shared half a share; craftsmen and laborers shared half a share; one share went to the "common fund," kept in the shop for staff emergencies like illness or death. The final share was "retirement money"—those who worked diligently and eventually lost the ability to work would be supported in their old age and given proper burials from this fund. When the system was announced, the whole shop was astounded. Could there really be such kind-hearted proprietors? Shen Fan didn't doubt the proprietors' sincerity. He was worldly-wise and knew that Proprietor Guo's kindness wasn't feigned—he genuinely cared for the workers. Everywhere else, shops provided staff with only two meals a day, but Proprietor Guo had said: "How can you expect people to work hard on just two meals?" And changed it to three meals. Three meals a day. Shen Fan sighed—he had toiled for over twenty years to become a manager before enjoying this privilege. At Zizhenzhai, even apprentices enjoyed it. They'd truly found a good proprietor.

As for other miscellaneous benefits—they were too numerous to list. The jewelry workshop was too hot, so they installed large windows for ventilation. Wooden buckets of cooling herbal tea were placed inside. A well was dug in the courtyard with stone troughs so workers could wash after work. Now they were building rows of new rooms on empty land—"dormitories" for the staff, so everyone wouldn't have to squeeze into makeshift bedding in the workshop, shopfront, and corridors.

With all this effort invested, no wonder everyone at Zizhenzhai was so motivated. Even old Wang, the lowest-ranked night watchman and gatekeeper, made his rounds diligently each night. The staff's faces all radiated energy and enthusiasm. Shen Fan had never felt this kind of spirit before. This wasn't effort driven by survival necessity, but a genuine attitude of working for oneself.

Seeing Zizhenzhai flourish so rapidly, he was truly happy for his benefactor. But amid the happiness, he felt an indescribable unease. Such smooth sailing might not be an auspicious sign. Shen Fan sighed softly and gently closed the ledger.

At this moment, Guo Yi was in the secluded safe house, writing rapidly:

"Report to the Executive Committee: ...Having arrived in Guangzhou nearly three months ago, through the joint efforts of our team and Naval Department colleagues, we've overcome initial difficulties and put trade roughly on track. To avoid direct competition with Gao Ju, we've decided not to directly operate the egg mirrors. We've reached an agreement with Gao Ju: he will continue distributing the egg mirrors. His control and regulation of the market is excellent, with a stable supply-price system. From the perspective of accelerating payment collection, having Gao Ju continue as distributor is appropriate.

"Currently our main profits come from various decorative glassware. These products have a narrow profit margin—Portuguese imports from Macau of similar products create some competition. Moreover, glassware is merely a rare curiosity here; most people have no interest. However, there is great demand for window glass in the luxury market—we saw small amounts of flat glass used in a wealthy family's garden pavilion windows. Reportedly, the original purchase price was extremely high, but foreign ships are reluctant to trade this item due to heavy breakage during transport. The market has demand but no supply.

"Market testing of 'Guoshi Wushuang' liquor as presentation gifts has been satisfactory. Most recipients were captivated by the glass bottles. Currently 'Guoshi Wushuang' is the most fashionable gift in Guangzhou's business and official circles, trending toward high-end gift status. However, the first batch of bottles is completely exhausted and we cannot continue shipping. Request the Executive Committee urgently arrange bottle production.

"The newly developed 'Tang Princess' for the European market is complete as samples. We will soon test-market in Macau. If sales are favorable, request the Executive Committee allocate all inventory items catalogued JC-0083 (porcelain vases) to the Forward Station.

"Experimental sales of 16-page AV albums through certain special channels have played an important role, greatly alleviating our initial cash shortage. Considering these goods' special nature and unsuitability for long-term trade, request the Executive Committee arrange tobacco and simple light industrial goods production as soon as possible. Quality tobacco can be purchased locally in Guangzhou.

"Additionally, the Leizhou outpost establishment is nearly complete. Currently we've opened a Qiwei Escort Bureau branch in Haikang County seat, with a lodging house for mules and horses. We've acquired three pressing mills—one water-powered, two animal-powered. Five sugarcane plantations with 1,200 standard *mu* of sugarcane fields combined. In Xuwen County seat we've opened one warehouse, acquired two pressing mills, four sugarcane plantations with 1,400 standard *mu* of sugarcane fields combined. Local sugarcane harvesting has begun. Request the Executive Committee urgently dispatch specialists to Leizhou to oversee sugar operations."

He exhaled, glancing at Zhang Yuchen who was chatting enthusiastically with Zhang Yu over the radio. This otaku had become a genuine "ham" (radio hobbyist). Though lacking QQ, he'd learned to chat with the girl using Morse code. His enthusiasm was such that he never wanted to get off the radio, requiring a strong worker to pedal a bicycle outside every day to charge the batteries.

"With all that enthusiasm, Li Chiqi will murder you," Guo Yi muttered, then checked his notebook and continued writing:

"Personnel recruitment: besides staff and craftsmen recruited for the Forward Station, we've also recruited approximately thirty craftsmen in various skills through local managers. They've agreed to work in Lingao but are unwilling to bring their families, and have stated they'll work for one year first, then decide whether to continue based on conditions. Once their terms are confirmed, we'll sign contracts with them. Please dispatch a ship to collect them as soon as possible.

"Regarding purchasing people in Guangzhou, we've established a cooperative relationship with local gentry member Liang Cunhou. We recruit famine refugees under the pretext of land reclamation, and he handles dealings with officials. As a gesture of cooperation, the Forward Station has donated 1,000 taels to the charitable hall he manages under the name Zichengji. Currently there are no fewer than tens of thousands of refugees in and around Guangzhou. How many can Lingao accommodate?

"Finances: cumulative sales to date have reached 12,000 taels silver. Due to differences between local trading practices and what we're accustomed to, major retail customers all use credit systems. Sales and profits are difficult to convert quickly to cash; the ledger figures are high. The Forward Station has already consumed substantial funds in establishing outposts and shops and recruiting personnel. We request permission to withdraw 10,000 taels from payments due from Gao Ju for our next phase of activities and operating expenses.

"Request the Finance and Currency Committee urgently establish expense procedures and reimbursement protocols for the Forward Station so we can standardize our financial system."

Guo Yi paused at this, thinking of the thick ledger of transactions and many handwritten receipts in the safe. These past months, money had flowed like water—and this timespace had no invoices, just handwritten chits for every expense. He could honestly say not a single *wen* had been spent on himself, and he could vouch for the other Station personnel too. But this couldn't continue indefinitely. Better for the Finance Department to establish procedures so everyone could follow regulations—otherwise, any future questions would mean inextricable trouble.

"...Outpost construction: besides the major commercial firm Zichengji, there is one jewelry shop Zizhenzhai (local manager, trustworthy), and one high-end entertainment establishment Ziminglou. The above three establishments currently break even operationally. Overall projections estimate revenue of approximately 20,000 taels over the next three months without new goods..."

Guo Yi rubbed his aching shoulders and continued: "Intelligence construction: the street intelligence collection network led by Gao Di has begun operating. Gao Di is usable, but his father's attitude is ambiguous. If possible, it would be best to send his parents to Lingao for utilization, lest he waver—

"National and Guangdong official and gentry directories have been obtained and will be sent back with the ship. Channels for obtaining *dibao* (official gazette) copies have also been established.

"The Forward Station has spent 2,000 taels to renovate a three-story pavilion on busy Gaodi Street in Guangzhou, temporarily named Ziminglou, for use by intelligence specialist PEPI. Agent PEPI has created considerable sensation among Guangzhou's officials and gentry. Reportedly she is quite close to He Rubin, the Guangzhou Commander's son, and frequently visits the Commander's residence." When the figure known as Pei Lixiu first appeared before the public at Ziminglou, the sensation could only be described as earth-shattering. The carefully arranged lighting effects had been well worth the effort. Unexpectedly, Ming dynasty celebrity-chasers were just as fanatical as modern ones. But if they knew PEPI was actually... Guo Yi suddenly felt an urge to throw down his pen and burst into laughter.
