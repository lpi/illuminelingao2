# Chapter 194: Wei Aiwen's New Year Party

"Absolutely, no question about it." Wei Aiwen smugly recounted his political work organizing the "Speak Bitterness" rally, also praising Wang Tao's abilities.

Wu De nodded with a smile. "Little Wei, though I'm Navy, I've spent over a decade in the PLA. Allow me some seniority to give you advice: your approach to political work is heading down the wrong path."

"Speak Bitterness is the wrong path?!" Wei Aiwen's face immediately reddened, full of disagreement.

"Speak Bitterness isn't the wrong path, but your version is about *technique*, not *heart*." Wu De spoke evenly. "Technically speaking, you and Wang Tao coordinated well and got results. But political work should be done with heart."

"Are we not doing it with heart?"

"Using heart means caring about soldiers and the masses in daily life, caring about their hardships." Wu De's expression grew reproachful. "You should think more about these soldiers. Many are orphans—families destroyed, no relatives. Aren't holidays hard for them? Some came fleeing from the mainland—their relatives are still back home, alive or dead unknown. Haven't you seen soldiers secretly crying at night? You should know what new recruits feel missing home. Holidays require special consideration. You think giving them one good meal, distributing rice and salt tickets—that counts as caring?"

Wei Aiwen nodded slowly. "I understand. It's basically emotional investment."

"'Investment' isn't my preferred term, but roughly right." Wu De continued. "Soldiers who see you as a good commander—in battle, you tell them to charge through minefields and they won't hesitate. They'll take bullets for you without frowning. But if you usually act high and mighty, in battle they'll just go through the motions. If you mistreat them, expect friendly fire."

Wei Aiwen said, "When I first arrived at my unit from boot camp, my squad leader even washed my feet. I felt so awkward. And that squad leader was a real sleazeball too!"

"That squad leader made the same mistake you're making now." Wu De pressed his point. "Squad leaders washing soldiers' feet is one way of caring for new recruits—but washing feet isn't the same as caring. If your squad leader usually treated his soldiers poorly, what use was washing feet once? Casually washing feet once and expecting soldiers to trust and obey you? That's formalism."

Wei Aiwen felt he'd suddenly learned much. He spoke sincerely. "A'De, with your rich experience, you should really guide us more."

"What can I teach? The military's first priority is unity." Wu De rose. "Go take care of your business."

"Alright, I'll head down to the troops. I'm just a bachelor anyway—New Year's Eve has nothing better to do. About the labor assignment on the third—"

"Won't forget. Don't worry."

After Wei Aiwen left, Wu De removed his coat, lay on the bed, and continued considering post-holiday employment reform. This also involved civil administration. Xiao Zishan's Internal Affairs Commission currently had no involvement in managing locals. The administrative system was somewhat confused—it needed unification. Establishing a proper school was also urgent. Many commune children had no schooling. Purchased orphans needed education; commune children needed it even more—they were the future...

Thinking and thinking, he fell asleep.

Wei Aiwen called Dongmen Chuiyu on the road, asking him to organize a battalion party.

"Great, let's do it now. These soldiers are bored waiting for New Year and are doing handstands and somersaults. Oh, Wu Nanhai just sent four or five baskets of Fujian tangerines to the battalion, as thanks for the work. I saved three *jin* for you—"

"Don't save any for me. Dongmen, that's not good. Special treatment." Wei Aiwen was still in an elevated state from Wu De's lecture. "Officers and soldiers all equal. Distribute per head evenly—soldiers first, officers after."

"Damn, you serious? Fine, you get the last share then." Dongmen's laughter came through the phone.

"That's fine. You'd better not be taking Army tangerines to kiss up to Ma Big Shot."

"Relax. Don't want to eat tangerines? Hurry over."

The New Army's party was held on the parade ground—the advantage of Hainan's warm weather. A bonfire blazed in the center. Barracks walls were plastered with red Spring Festival couplets and New Year pictures. Everyone who wasn't asleep sat around the fire. The only officers present were Dongmen Chuiyu and Old Tiger You. Wei Aiwen was surprised to also see Luo Duo, wearing a security duty officer armband and carrying a rifle. Soldiers were cracking sunflower seeds, gnawing dried sweet potato strips, eating tangerines, and happily listening to Wang Tao's storytelling.

Dongmen Chuiyu spotted Wei Aiwen and tossed him a tangerine. "You're here too? Welcome! Welcome!"

Wei Aiwen smiled at Dongmen, then snapped to attention and gave the soldiers a smart salute. This flustered them into standing to return the salute.

"Sit down, everyone continue having fun." He scanned the crowd. Wu De's reminder was truly right. If he'd told everyone to go back to sleep or spend a cold, empty New Year's Eve, where would this lively atmosphere be?

Wang Tao had just finished a segment of "Court Battles"—Liu Baorui's classic storytelling. As an amateur enthusiast, he'd put in considerable effort. Of course, at this point in history, not even Qianlong's grandfather had been born. So except for changing some obviously Qing-dynasty elements to Ming, names like Qianlong, Heshen, and Liu Yong remained unchanged—just treating it as a story from some imaginary dynasty. The soldiers listened entranced. Between segments, everyone demanded more. Wang Tao modestly declined: "Can't eat all the good food at once. Let's invite Company Commander Wei for a performance. Everyone give applause!"

Enthusiastic applause rang out—though the clapping styles varied. This was still new to them.

Wei Aiwen didn't demur. He walked to the center and cleared his throat. He'd been a KTV regular and company cultural backbone, knowing many songs. But pop songs were too soft—better to do a military song. He recalled a favorite: "Cavalry Song of the Grasslands." First he mentally reviewed the lyrics, humming through once, cutting and replacing inappropriate parts, then began singing:

*Grasslands, oh grasslands,*
*Vast grasslands stretching endlessly!*
*Heroes ride across the grasslands,*
*Ai hei, soldiers charge forward.*

*Ai hei, soldiers charge forward.*

*Girl, please watch,*
*The road ahead lies smooth and wide,*

*See how far this road stretches,*

*Ai hei, songs never cease along the way.*

*Ai hei, songs never cease along the way.*

*On roads we've traveled,*
*Fields stretch wide around us,*

*These are all our farms,*

*Ai hei, everywhere a new scene appears.*

*Ai hei, everywhere a new scene appears.*

*But we see,*
*Smoke rising on the horizon,*

*Enemies hiding beyond the forest,*
*Ai hei, like dark clouds covering blue sky.*

*Ai hei, like dark clouds covering blue sky.*

*Girl, rest assured,*
*We're ready to meet the enemy,*

*See, cavalry galloping forth,*
*Ai hei, infantry charging forward.*
*Ai hei, infantry charging forward.*
*Ai hei, the transmigrator regime leads us.*

*Ai hei, the transmigrator regime leads us.*

This song was originally the choral finale of Soviet composer Knipper's Fourth Symphony, "Epic of the Komsomol Fighter." The lyricist was young poet Gusev. Their collaboration won a prize in the 1934 All-Union Komsomol Song Competition. Soon, choirs and singers at home and abroad began performing it.

The song combined military grandeur with romantic color, plus passionate defense of the new regime—very fitting. From the soldiers' enthusiastic applause, he knew he'd sung well. This song could be promoted in the troops going forward.

After singing, Wei Aiwen joined the crowd. Old Tiger You slapped his shoulder, praising the performance, then quietly asked how things went with Wu De. Wei Aiwen naturally boasted about how his silver tongue had convinced him.

Meanwhile, soldiers took turns singing regional ditties, doing human pyramids and handstands, having great fun. Old Tiger You said, "I need to go. My mother's waiting to stay up for New Year together."

"Filial son, haha."

"That's just being a proper person." He tucked the two tangerines just distributed into his clothes, then whispered, "You heard about the domestic secretaries?"

"Heard about it. You want one too?"

"Of course. I told my mother I'd get a princess to serve her. Now look—it's my mother serving me." Old Tiger You was somewhat embarrassed. "Get a domestic secretary first so she can rest."

"Princess... honestly I'm not that interested." Wei Aiwen shook his head. Those small builds? Some women still had bound feet—looked uncomfortable just seeing them.

The next morning, Wu De woke. Chuyu attended to his washing, then he ate the sesame-filled *tangyuan* she'd made herself. Seeing her radiant face running about, even wearing a flower in her hair, he suddenly thought: *Why be so conflicted? New Year, new beginnings—just take her already.*

By the other spacetime's standards, Chuyu was merely delicate, nothing special in figure—couldn't really count as a beauty. His requirements for women weren't high anyway. The Executive Committee had discussed assigning "domestic secretaries"—that could be implemented too. Let everyone enjoy normal life instead of always eating in cafeterias...

Just as he was thinking, Chuyu brought over two tangerines and knelt before him. "Chuyu wishes Master boundless blessings for the new spring."

"Get up, get up. Just give New Year's greetings normally." Wu De sometimes couldn't handle her formality. He accepted the tangerines. Using tangerines for New Year greetings—this must be regional Chaoshan custom.

But Chuyu didn't rise, just smiled. "New Year's greetings without red envelope gifts?"

"Fine, fine, here." Wu De had prepared many red envelopes yesterday. Contents were meager—each just a one-*jin* salt ticket. But locals, influenced by Cantonese customs, valued the tradition.

Watching Chuyu cheerfully bustling about the room, he smiled silently. A thread of homesickness surfaced. He said to himself:

"Ah, when can we accomplish great things and return home to visit?"

Then he reconsidered: even if they immediately captured Guangdong, his homeland in this spacetime had nothing to do with his real home.

Looking out the window, dawn was just breaking. Commune cadres were already coming to pay New Year's respects. He went out to visit familiar households in the commune and check the group dormitories. New Year breakfast was cafeteria sesame *tangyuan* for everyone. Wu De looked around—no household seemed to be struggling. This made him quite happy.

After breakfast, though it was a holiday, there was nothing to do for entertainment. Wu De routinely visited the various construction sites, all dependent on commune labor supply. Per schedule, the brick kiln and quarry wouldn't stop work—the labor-reform team would continue production. The Bopu Baitu Village housing project also continued—this village was mainly for shipbuilding work, so housing was still at Bopu port. The village kept its Baitu name. Wu De didn't request a vehicle. Taking his bodyguard Yuan Qiushi, he walked along the highway to Bopu to check project progress.

At the construction site, Wen Desi and several Building Department people were climbing a tall sand pile, pointing and discussing, apparently debating something.

"Mr. Wen, good morning! Oh, right—Happy New Year!"

"Happy New Year to you too!" Wen Desi called from above. Wu De saw Building Department chief Mei Wan and several others he didn't recognize up there.

Wu De climbed the sand pile. Wen Desi was holding a rough sketch, discussing with the Building Department. Leaning over, he saw structural plans for Baitu Village's new buildings.

"What? Changing the design for the new village buildings?" Wu De noticed the structure differed from the standard residences already built in Bairren Commune.

"Bairren Commune's current Standard Residence A has a drawback—low defensive capability. No problem in our core area, but somewhere like Bopu needs to consider defense. Another issue you might not have noticed: farmers aren't used to multi-story buildings, and the A-type design didn't consider residents' need for drying clothes and goods."

This B-type residence arranged all houses in a square surrounding formation, totaling thirty-eight households. Each unit had two sixteen-square-meter floors with an additional ten-square-meter rooftop terrace and six-square-meter small room. The structure resembled townhouses. Corner towers on all four corners had shared toilets on the ground floor. Wastewater and excreta were piped into a biogas pit. The central area was a four-hundred-square-meter threshing ground with a communal well.

These buildings had no windows or doors facing outward on the ground floor—only opening to the inner threshing ground. Rooftop terraces had external crenellations. Corner towers could station sentries and store village communal supplies. If enemies invaded, everyone could shelter inside with water and grain for short-term defense. The residential area had only one entrance gate, with a gatehouse featuring firing ports.
