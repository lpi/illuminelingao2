# Chapter 222: The Security Regiment

China's traditional labor levy system, though nominally based on formulas like "one in five men drafted" or "one in three men drafted" with exemptions for only sons, in practice often resulted in wealthy households shifting their burdens onto the poor. Labor service not only paid nothing but required workers to provide their own food and clothing. Poor families often faced complete ruin from the massive burden and the loss of their primary breadwinner.

Spring was approaching—the traditional busy farming season. Taking labor away affected both wealthy and poor households severely.

From the start, Wu De believed that unpaid conscription was inappropriate and might even risk inflaming tensions with Lingao's local people. By comparison, hired labor was more suitable.

Currently, their labor crews were actually hired—though all were volunteers who came on their own. If they relied solely on volunteers, the transmigrator collective's labor needs would never be met. Now, using administrative means to have villages provide workers was much more convenient. It also allowed accurate estimates of available labor.

Thus it was agreed with the villages: all villages would be classified into large, medium, and small based on population. First-tier villages would supply ten workers, middle-tier five, and lower-tier two. Villages with genuinely few able-bodied men could apply for exemption—though this required on-site inspection to confirm. Villages would self-report their tier, but village sizes were common knowledge, making trickery on this matter unwise.

This meant that, excluding very small villages, the roughly three hundred villages attending the conference could provide about one thousand able-bodied men. These workers would be managed uniformly by the transmigrator collective, with a service term of one year. After one year, they could return home and their village would send replacements. Those who didn't want to return could continue serving.

Workers would receive compensation—Wu De emphasized this point. Each worker would receive the same treatment as the transmigrators' current labor crews: food rations and wages at year's end.

The villages had assumed that supplying workers would also require providing their food. Hearing that workers wouldn't need village support and would even receive wages, they were practically moved to tears by the transmigrator collective's generosity. These "baldies," though engaged in the business of murder and arson, were far better than the government when it came to caring for the common people. Approval ratings rose again.

Next came the matter of establishing the Bairren Security Regiment. On this issue, there had been extended negotiations between the *yamen* and the Executive Committee. Though the *yamen* had virtually no control over what the transmigrator collective wanted to do, having such an armed force established right under their noses was obviously not what Magistrate Wu hoped for. But forming the Security Regiment was the transmigrators' first step toward gradually absorbing and integrating the county's militia, so they refused to back down. In the end, they only promised to limit the Security Regiment to one thousand men within three years and to nominally accept the *yamen*'s Sheriff as its titular commander.

The Security Regiment's soldiers would come from two sources. First, the conscript workers from villages—the transmigrators would select some from the men sent by villages to serve as regiment soldiers. Second, village militia. Under the plan, each village would organize militia units based on its size and population. Villages without militia would have the transmigrators help equip and train them. Village militia would be rotated in batches to the Bairren City public office for Security Regiment training and would share in county-wide security duties. This militia service term was three months.

The Security Regiment's primary missions were bandit suppression and pirate defense. The Bairren public office would also establish a county-wide early warning communication system, restoring and repairing the beacon towers previously built to guard against Japanese pirates at bays where pirates could easily land. Once pirates landed, the Security Regiment would deploy to intercept them.

This approach was essentially the same as the six-village joint defense organized by Huang Family Village, only the transmigrators had expanded it county-wide. It would give each village basic self-defense capability against small bandit or pirate groups. The transmigrator regime wanted to maximize improvement of the county's security situation without excessively consuming their core forces. The only solution was to organize a militia system—back in the day, the CCP had used this very method to completely pacify areas plagued by bandits. Of course, the Executive Committee was well aware that this militia system couldn't withstand government army suppression—after all, government forces held the moral authority of the imperial court. But for defending homes and fighting bandits and pirates, it was feasible.

This detailed explanation received unanimous approval from the village delegates. Wu Ya also secretly admired how many clever methods the "baldies" had. But he also silently cursed the village representatives: when the county had tried to organize regional joint defense in the past, villages either pleaded poverty or made excuses—it never came together. Now the short-hairs arrived, burned and looted one Gou Family Manor, and suddenly everyone was obedient. Truly shameless.

The delegates then raised the issue of militia treatment during Security Regiment service. After all, militia were able-bodied laborers too, and sending some away would naturally affect production. Wu De was prepared for this: militia serving short-term rotations would receive thirty *yuan* in circulation vouchers per month—enough to buy thirty big *jin* of rice. As compensation, this was quite generous. Those wounded in combat would receive treatment from the transmigrators; the disabled would be supported by the transmigrator collective; the fallen would also receive compensation. If they left behind orphans and widows with no one to care for them, the transmigrator collective would provide for them too.

When this condition was announced, the venue erupted. Everyone was discussing animatedly. Over the years, village militia fighting bandits had resulted in frequent deaths. Villages would just give some burial money and call it done. For single outsiders, even that money was saved—they'd just be buried in a cheap thin coffin. The "baldies'" promises were simply too good—so good as to arouse suspicion.

Huang Bingkun muttered, "This is just to trick militia into fighting for them. Even the court doesn't offer this. Are they bodhisattvas?"

"Exactly—fighting wars this way, even the court couldn't afford it, let alone them!"

Suspicion aside, the conference delegates didn't question further—after all, the transmigrators were now Lingao's masters. Whatever they said or did was up to them, and everyone had to take them at their word. Some people, especially those who had dealt with the transmigrator collective, believed the transmigrators would keep their word. After all, they hadn't broken any promises since coming ashore.

By now the meeting had reached noon. Though the morning had been entirely spent listening to speeches, since it concerned each village's vital interests, every delegate had listened attentively. Though there was occasional discussion, order had been maintained. Now hunger was naturally beginning to affect their attention. At this point, Li Yuanyuan came up again to announce a meeting break and that meals would be delivered.

Lunch arrived on handcarts. Male and female students distributed meals to the delegates. Each person received a polished wooden box. When opened, the food was far richer than anyone had imagined—rice with sliced cured meat, greens, and the legendary scrambled eggs with tomatoes. Very substantial. Next came a bamboo tube with a stopper. Huang Bingkun opened it and smelled a light soup, apparently made from some kind of fish and seaweed. He took a sip and found the flavor incredibly fresh and sweet—these baldies really did eat well.

As Huang Bingkun ate, he looked around. He noticed the young men and women distributing food seemed to speak Cantonese. He knew Hainan Mandarin, which wasn't too different, so he tried asking, "Are you the bal—I mean, the Australian lords' household staff?"

The young men and women just smiled without answering. Only one youth with a small white cloth band with some pattern on his arm said, "We are students of the National School."

"Students?" Huang Bingkun was puzzled. The "baldies" ran schools? What did they run schools for? Teaching murder and arson—they certainly wouldn't be lecturing on the sages' books, or they wouldn't have become sea pirates.

But he couldn't say this in front of these "little baldies." He asked again, "What is this place used for?"

"This place?" the leading "little baldy" said. "This is a cinema. Normally it's a place to show shadow plays."

"What are shadow plays?"

The student paused, then smiled. "Tonight we'll treat all delegates to a viewing. You'll understand then."

Huang Bingkun wanted to extract more information, but these "little baldies" were tight-lipped, only smiling without answering.

*They looked like children from good families. Who knew what potion they'd been fed to make them call bandits their fathers!* Huang Bingkun sighed to himself.

After lunch, Li Yuanyuan announced a half-hour break. Everyone could walk around the venue or relieve themselves, but must not cross the lime lines around the venue perimeter. Huang Bingkun took the opportunity to survey the venue's surroundings. Walking a circuit along the lime lines, he tried to see more of Bairren City's interior. The most prominent thing he saw was a tall iron tower in the city center.

The tower's base was hidden among several distinctive gray buildings. The tower itself was built from black steel, as high as twenty men standing on each other's shoulders. It narrowed as it rose, ending in a sharp point. There was a gleaming tip at the top.

*These "baldies'" homeland must be skilled at smelting and forging iron—that is why all their objects are made of iron.* No wonder people said the baldies were constantly smuggling iron implements from the mainland to the island.

But Huang Bingkun couldn't figure out what use this entirely iron tower served. To him, it seemed a complete waste—so much iron could be put to considerable use for anything else. He tried to get closer for a better look, but was immediately blocked by a man in gray clothes with a belt at his waist. The man swung his long blue-black musket across, and Huang Bingkun clearly understood he should retreat behind the line.

The color of this musket was similar to the pistol recovered from the scene where Third Brother had been killed. Unfortunately, after Father fired it once, it never fired again—they didn't know how to load the ammunition. Huang Bingkun pondered: he needed to find an opportunity to properly test this kind of musket. Weren't they forming the Security Regiment? He made up his mind—when the time came, he would personally lead militia to participate, to see exactly what made the "baldies" so formidable in battle. If there was an opportunity, he'd also get hold of one of these muskets.
