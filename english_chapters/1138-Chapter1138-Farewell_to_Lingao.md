# Chapter 1138 - Farewell to Lingao

This indicated the visitor was only on a short-term visit, not a permanent posting. The visitor was likely a Company VIP tasked with inspecting trading post operations and auditing accounts.

Li Siya already had a plan. This incoming East India Company inspector would be an important means for her to complete her mission.

In the early summer night, the starry sky appeared exceptionally brilliant. The Milky Way, which had become a chaotic blur in the old timeline's sky, was distinct and sparkling here.

On the roof of Taibai Observatory, Zhong Xiaoying was bent over the transit instrument's eyepiece, recording the astronomical time of meridian passage.

After recording the last datum, Zhong Xiaoying handed the record to her adoptive father, then curiously leaned in to observe the starry sky through the astronomical telescope.

"So beautiful!" Zhong Xiaoying couldn't help exclaiming as she gazed at the beautiful starry sky. The stars seen through the telescope were even brighter and more brilliant. "Adoptive Father, you're truly amazing!"

The young girl's eyes were filled with adoration.

"Someday when we can achieve electrification, what you see will be even more beautiful..." Zhong Lishi said to Zhong Xiaoying. "Father must return to Gaoshan Ridge tomorrow to develop a new large clock and won't be back for a month. You must take good care of yourself, and the daily recording of astronomical time must not be neglected—the Committee will send a Committee member and several students to work with you. You know the Committee member coming; it's Uncle Yuan from Fangcaodi. He has an astronomical observation group..." Zhong Xiaoying nodded vigorously and said to Zhong Lishi, "Adoptive Father, come back early. Daughter still wants to learn from you..."

Thinking that he would leave for Taiwan tomorrow, looking at the innocent Zhong Xiaoying, Zhong Lishi really couldn't bear to deceive her. He had to say he was going to participate in a top-secret research project. But if he told Zhong Xiaoying the truth, it would only make her worry—this girl somehow knew that malaria in Taiwan was very severe, and had been worried about her friends from the Maid School who had been sent to Taiwan with their masters.

At dawn, Lingao Port awoke from its slumber. This day was destined to be exceptionally busy. On the docks, workers bustled ceaselessly, hoisting crates of supplies onto transport ships moored at the pier.

Zhong Lishi was at the berth of the transport ship nicknamed "Spanish Whore," directing dock workers to gently hoist boxes and straw bales of various sizes into the cargo hold. He instructed those heavy-handed workers to be especially "gentle" with these boxes. Because the cargo in these boxes was none other than the clock mechanism parts ordered by the Taiwan Region and the calibrators for Tainan timekeeping.

Zhong Lishi's trip to Taiwan had another important mission besides installing clock mechanisms and debugging calibrators: to survey the southern cape of Tainan in preparation for building a lighthouse. This lighthouse was crucial for navigation safety along Taiwan's coast. For this, the Executive Committee had specially dispatched Liu Zheng and other Remote Exploration Ministry Committee members to go along.

Watching over ten crates of cargo safely hoisted into the hold, Zhong Lishi's hanging heart finally relaxed halfway. Whether these treasures could reach their destination safely depended on sea conditions during the voyage.

Zhong Lishi boarded the "Spanish Whore." A sailor led him to his assigned cabin. It was a two-person cabin, quite cramped—similar to a train sleeper in the old timeline, with two facing bunk beds. However, on this ship of only 200 tons burden, this was exceptional treatment; sailors and soldiers slept in hammocks. Zhong Lishi's bunk was an upper one.

Zhong Lishi had just stowed his luggage under the bed when someone pushed the door open and entered. It was Liu Zheng of the Remote Exploration Ministry. Liu Zheng had been running around all these years; his skin was darker than a construction worker's in the old timeline, but his body had become more robust and solid. Seeing Zhong Lishi, he greeted him with his explosive voice: "Long time no see! Dr. Zhong! We'll be companions on this trip!"

He looked around the cabin. "This ship's conditions are a bit poor, but at least it's our Remote Exploration Ministry's own ship. Not easy."

"Doesn't this ship's registry still belong to the Navy?" Zhong Lishi asked. When boarding, he'd seen the Navy's "Lin-Te" [Lingao Special] number painted on the stern.

"The Navy agreed this ship is ours to use whenever we want—which is pretty good." Liu Zheng took out a cigar, glanced at Zhong Lishi who was about to stop him, and smiled. "I won't smoke, just smell it. I know the rules on board."

Zhong Lishi asked, "There's a question I've never quite understood..."

"Ask away!"

"How did this ship get such a nickname?"

Liu Zheng laughed loudly. "Everyone wants to use transport ships, and capacity is tight. Unless it's an emergency mission that can commandeer a dedicated ship, you have to wait for a ride. In all of Lingao Port, only this ship of ours is on standby anytime. We in the Exploration Ministry don't use the ship often, so it's vacant a lot. When there's an urgent need, it's available on call—this one uses it, that one uses it. The brothers all say 'This ship is like a whore, taking turns being abused by everyone,' so it got this name." With that, both let out loud laughs.

While they were joking, the door pushed open again. In came Fang Jinghan, his poker face also tanned, bearing traces of years working in the wild. Seeing Liu Zheng already there, he was startled. "Old Liu! How are you already on board? Didn't Sister-in-law say she was coming to see you off?"

"I don't want her sending me off. Fussing and nagging, inevitably shedding tears again." Liu Zheng waved his hand. "Don't know which idiot told her Taiwan has headhunting natives. She was crying and sniffling telling me not to go..."

"You have a child now, right? A wife naturally feels differently," Dr. Zhong consoled him.

"Aren't I going to expand the living space of our Great Han nation for the child's sake!" Liu Zheng said seriously.

Fang Jinghan said, "Big Liu, for this field survey in Tainan, we must appear amiable to avoid alerting the natives..."

Liu Zheng waved impatiently. "I know, I know. I'm not a Nazi. As long as they submit and naturalize, we're all one family. Otherwise," he made a beheading motion, "they can only be passed down as a historical term."

Zhong Lishi knew both these men were "Huaxia Society" Han chauvinists, so he didn't interject much. They proceeded to discuss the field survey—he would participate too, though Dr. Zhong felt his physical constitution might not hold up.

"Not a big problem," Liu Zheng said. "I read a few European survey records. The road to the southern cape isn't too rugged. We'll bring laborers; at worst we'll have laborers carry you on a sedan chair. The problem is there are many natives, and they're quite fierce. They weren't fully subdued until the Japanese occupation."

Zhong Lishi felt surveying from a sedan chair was a bit comical, but if his physical strength really failed, he'd have to do so. He said, "For safety, we definitely need the Expeditionary Army escort. Pay attention to methods. These natives aren't completely unreasonable. Try to pass peacefully; getting the data is what matters."

Everything was ready. The 60th Convoy was fully equipped, quietly waiting in the harbor for the order to depart. Hearing the deep bell toll from the harbor Customs Clock Tower, the Convoy Commander issued the order to sail. Sailors cast off mooring lines and retracted anchor chains. Tugs slowly pulled the sailing ships one by one from the pier, and loudspeakers on the dock began playing the "Warship March." Soldiers and sailors on board waved goodbye to friends and family on shore.

Zhong Lishi leaned on the gunwale, gazing at the seeing-off crowd, involuntarily thinking of Zhong Xiaoying at home. At this moment, a familiar shout suddenly came from the crowd. Zhong Lishi looked toward the sound and discovered Zhong Xiaoying desperately squeezing through the crowd, shouting loudly at him, "Honorable Father! Honorable Father! Why did you lie to me!"

Zhong Lishi couldn't explain to her in the moment, only waving desperately and shouting back: "Go back! Wait properly for my return! I will definitely come back!"

Amidst her shouting, Zhong Xiaoying suddenly dove into the sea below the breakwater. Amidst gasps of surprise, she surfaced over ten meters away and swan fiercely toward Zhong Lishi's ship.

Zhong Lishi was momentarily flustered, shouting stammeringly: "Quick! Quick! Save her!"

Lifeboats in the harbor immediately approached to fish her out, but Zhong Xiaoying paid no heed, swimming relentlessly after the ship. Zhong Lishi sighed helplessly: "Signal them to let her board."
