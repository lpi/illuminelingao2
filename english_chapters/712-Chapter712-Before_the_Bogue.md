# Chapter 712 - Before the Bogue

Guided by *Haitian*, the fleet quickly passed Furong Shoal and continued upriver. Most transmigrators in the fleet were entering the Pearl River Estuary for the first time, sailing these waters. Chen Haiyang had previously navigated the Pearl River many times—during his service in the South Sea Fleet, he had repeatedly commanded warships into Huangpu Port. But the Pearl River of this timeline was very different from the old. The river was far wider, water and sky merging as one, vast as an ocean. Everywhere were bays, tributaries, and small sandy islets. The alluvial plains on both banks, fed by converging waters, created the illusion of an inland sea dotted with islands. The rivers that fragmented the land made it difficult to distinguish them from the waters encircling the islands. Everywhere were small patches of cultivated fields. The late rice was flowering; the fragrance of rice blossoms filled the air. Villages and market towns were scattered along the banks with almost no roads—only boats for transportation. The large and small rivers formed a complex network connecting towns and villages. Occasionally, one could glimpse masts and sails appearing amid the distant rice paddies.

This breathtaking subtropical rural landscape had almost vanished in the old timeline's Pearl River Delta. The transmigrators in the fleet gazed hungrily at the scenery. Wasn't this the very essence of "a broad river's waves, the wind carrying rice-blossom fragrance to both shores"? China's land had always been this beautiful and bountiful. The more beautiful the scenery, the stronger their desire to seize it for themselves!

On the river surface were some inland transport vessels and fishing boats. Seeing such an imposing, well-equipped fleet approaching, they scattered into the surrounding bays and tributaries. Chen Haiyang ordered several captured for questioning about river conditions.

According to the captured boatmen and sailors, no government naval patrol ships were on the Pearl River. If there were any official armed vessels, it was only a few small boats from the tax station at Zini.

Most government warships were scattered in large and small bays between Xiangshan and Huangpu. At the Bogue, about a dozen government warships were stationed. Besides naval vessels, numerous large ships were moored at Great Huangpu—over 2,000 in total. Ever since war with the "crop-heads" began, many long-haul merchant vessels dared not set sail, especially those bound for Vietnam and Siam that had to pass through the Qiongzhou Strait—now a "war zone." Except for a few bold, well-informed shipowners, no one risked the journey.

As for Guangzhou's defenses, reportedly the troops had strengthened their vigilance, and many sandbag artillery positions had been built along the riverbank. The Yaniangxie Battery at the Bogue had also added gun emplacements and reinforced its garrison.

Once Chen Haiyang had grasped the general river defense situation, he concluded that Guangzhou hadn't established particularly elaborate defenses—of course, even the most elaborate defenses by 17th-century standards had little value. The navy he commanded was at least at early 19th-century levels. If not for the special-service boats' outdated design and small tonnage, he wouldn't even need this many vessels to enter the Pearl River.

Chen Haiyang ordered: "Release all captured boatmen, give each a souvenir."

The captured boatmen and merchants had expected that even if they weren't taken hostage, they would lose their boats and cargo. To their surprise, the crop-heads were quite polite. After questioning, they were allowed to depart. Each person aboard even received an "Australian face-washing cloth"—a towel—as a gift. Towels were among the most popular and widespread Lingao industrial products.

The people aboard stared dumbly at the towels in their hands—embroidered in blood-red thread with "Commemorating the Australasian Song Navy's First Entry into the Pearl River"—and watched the fleet sail away under full canvas. They felt as if they'd experienced some strange dream.

The fleet headed straight for the Bogue. Chen Haiyang decided to take this Pearl River stronghold—the gateway to Guangzhou—in the first battle. The Bogue, part of Dongguan County in both Ming-Qing and modern times, bordered Lingding Bay to the east and Lion Bay inland. It comprised roughly 8 kilometers of Pearl River waterway and both banks. This was the Pearl River's critical chokepoint and Guangzhou's gateway. Historically, the Bogue's security had profound psychological significance for Guangzhou's safety. Once foreign enemies seized the Bogue, all Guangzhou would be shaken. Hence, defenses here had been quite elaborate throughout history. Yet the Bogue stronghold had never withstood even a single frontal assault by foreign enemies. Not only had the British and Japanese, with their superior ships, guns, and tactics, breached this chokepoint, but even local Chinese pirates during the Jiaqing era had easily broken through. Chen Haiyang knew that in 1637, the Englishman Weddell had destroyed and occupied the Yaniangxie Battery with just a few ships. Given his forces, taking this place wouldn't require much effort.

While the Pearl River Special Expeditionary Fleet advanced, the Bogue's defenses had been greatly strengthened. Although Guangdong Commander-in-Chief He Rubin was besieged at Qiongshan and Wang Zunde was too ill to administer affairs, the efforts of Li Fengjie, Guangdong local officials, and Ming military commanders had significantly reinforced the entire Bogue region.

Leading the Bogue defense were Xu Tingfa, Supervising Regional Commander of Guangzhou Coastal Defense; Chen Qian, Bogue Garrison Coastal Defense Commander; and Fan Wencai, Dongguan County Magistrate. Since the Bogue was within Dongguan County, Fan Wencai felt duty-bound and had personally moved with his staff to Taiping Market in front of the Bogue Garrison to work. He had conscripted several thousand laborers to construct fortifications at the Bogue.

Xu Tingfa was an experienced coastal defense veteran who knew the Bogue's defenses were extremely weak. Yaniangxie Island originally had only one earth-and-stone battery, gradually constructed since the Wanli reign and badly deteriorated in many places. The cannons mounted were mostly old Foulangji guns and *fakang* guns, not only underpowered but rusted from years of outdoor exposure. Besides the Yaniangxie Battery, there was only one earth-and-stone battery on Upper Hengdang Island opposite Yaniangxie, mounting four Foulangji guns. The crossfire these two batteries could generate was pathetically weak. And these two batteries could barely cover the eastern channel. The western channel had no defenses whatsoever—only past Upper Hengdang Island, south of Dahu Mountain Island, was there a makeshift Dahu Battery that could somewhat impede ships passing through the western channel.

These three batteries together had only 36 gun positions—all Foulangji guns cast during the Wanli reign or earlier, plus even older *fakang* guns. The three batteries' garrisons totaled only 120 men, merely guarding the cannons and fortifications.

Beyond these three batteries, all the Ming forces could use to defend the Bogue were Chen Qian's Bogue Garrison troops: a peacetime strength of 640 soldiers and 10 warships mounting 120 guns.

This was barely enough to intercept merchants and intimidate common folk. So for actual combat, reinforcements were needed. Wartime strength would expand to 2,000 troops. Xu Tingfa knew the crop-heads were renowned for their powerful ships and guns—far superior to ordinary pirates. So while consulting with Fan Wencai about cleaning and restoring old cannons and repairing batteries, he also ordered newly cast Red Barbarian cannons shipped from Foshan and other places, expanding gun positions.

Gun positions at Yaniangxie Battery increased by 60, reaching an unprecedented 72. Upper Hengdang Island not only had its original battery refurbished but was also scheduled to receive a new battery facing the western channel, mounting 12 guns. Dahu Mountain Battery was also expanded. The Bogue Garrison itself was reinforced with an earthen wall, preparing to mount 18 additional guns.

Besides reinforcing and expanding the batteries, Xu Tingfa, Fan Wencai, and others also built Western-style fortifications following Sun Yuanhua's *Xi Fa Duntai* specifications. Additionally, temporary sandbag-and-earth batteries were hastily constructed at Dajiao and Shajiao, each mounting 2 Red Barbarian cannons and 10 Foulangji guns.

According to Xu Tingfa's ultimate plan, batteries would also be built along the Luwan shore west of Upper Hengdang Island, creating crossfire with the Upper Hengdang Island western battery, thus thoroughly sealing the western channel.

So many batteries required enormous funds and labor. Without more than a year, they couldn't be completed—yet the crop-head invasion could come at any moment. Xu Tingfa and his colleagues agreed to first build temporary sandbag batteries and get the guns mounted. At least this would provide some deterrent effect.

Neither Xu Tingfa nor Chen Qian believed these defenses could stop the crop-heads' great iron ship or armored fast boats. However, these two types of ships seemed few in number; the crop-heads mostly used sailing vessels. Against sailing ships, the Great Ming navy still had some confidence—after all, in recent years Guangdong's navy had frequently fought various maritime bandits and gained considerable experience.

The moment Chen Haiyang's expeditionary fleet passed Dajiao, the Dajiao and Shajiao batteries spotted this formation-tight fleet. Combined with the red flags on the masts and the black-smoke-belching landing craft, identifying the newcomers was obvious.

At 11:23 on September 20th, Dajiao Battery's Red Barbarian cannon fired for the first time. Afterward, the other guns at Dajiao and Shajiao batteries joined in a continuous roar.

Chen Haiyang ordered the formation tightened. *Haitian* had already reported intelligence on these two batteries: the best cannons at Dajiao and Shajiao were merely 12-pounder guns cast in imitation of English naval guns, with maximum range of about 1,000 meters—nowhere near enough to hit the fleet. This was merely for show.

He could simply ignore the bombardment and sail straight through. However, Chen Haiyang's mission was to teach Guangdong's local officials a lesson and demonstrate the transmigration faction's strength. Such provocation naturally demanded fierce retaliation.

He raised his telescope to observe the two batteries: extremely crude temporary positions built from sandbags. The number of guns was also limited. He issued the order to eliminate the Dajiao and Shajiao batteries.

"Attack Dajiao Battery first! All long-gun squadrons, free fire. Alternating fire by odd-even sequence! Carronade squadrons, await my command to engage!"

The special-service boats assigned to this expedition included squadrons equipped with either long guns or carronades. Though carronades were inexpensive and highly effective at close range in naval combat, their effective range was too short—generally needing to close to around 130 meters to be most effective.

*Notes:*

*1. The Bogue's defense system was formally established during the Wanli reign. The Ming defenses described here roughly follow the Qing-era Bogue coastal defense system.*

*2. The names of the Bogue officials are, of course, fictional. However, Chen Qian is a historical figure—according to "History of Sino-British Relations," the Guangdong Commander-in-Chief in 1637 was indeed Chen Qian. Whether he ever served as Bogue Garrison Commander is unverified by the author—including whether such a position existed.*

*3. Carronades were large-caliber short naval guns invented by the British. Short range, high power.*
