# Chapter 2296: Dividing Spoils

"Didn't think dozing off someone delivers pillow." Yi Haoran smiled, "Wonderful ah."

"I also feel among it has opportunity to take advantage, just don't know how to use."

"How to use Student also wants to think well. But now this Sanheui is already silk shirt removed clean, letting me and others do whatever we want." Yi Haoran usually rarely spoke frivolous words; this moment couldn't help starting driving car (making dirty joke).

"Sir loves joking."

"Really not joking." Yi Haoran said, "Right now, first help him settle this matter of three hundred *dan* grain." He asked: "This Liu Youwang wants how much silver one *dan*."

"Two taels is fine—he anxious to sell off. Wants ready money, must be gold silver."

"Easy to say." Yi Haoran thought, this business ready made someone does; that was exactly Jiang Rongxian. Matter of joint capital buying grain he already participated in; right now this deal could get grain immediately; also could resell once while taking advantage of high grain price.

"Also this Opera Chest problem, also not easy to handle... I am not local person either." Chang Qingyun said.

"Wuzhou city I am familiar than you; let me help you look." Yi Haoran agreed fully.

Conspiracy started with tight gongs dense drums. To reduce Luo Yangming’s suspicion on himself, Yi Haoran every day besides Rice Firm - Dock two points one line, didn't run everywhere, also extremely rarely met outsiders. Jiang Suo rushing back from Gou Er place responsible for running contacting work.

During this period their private activities, besides contacting Gou Er bandit gang and Song Ming’s remnant department, also successively gathered some lost scattered personnel. These people mostly were scattered soldiers wandering braves and small officials having blood debt civil anger, impossible to be forgiven by Hair thieves. Yi Haoran coerced with this, plus temptation of "Merit," letting them join into this conspiracy.

Now he through layer layer control, mastered a gang of about one hundred people. Inside had many people working under Australians; many people working in Security Team, assisting National Army’s night patrol and standing sentry. Also some people, through National Army’s on spot supplement, directly entered National Army being soldiers. Also some, simply drilled into City Government office serving as messenger.

Through these people, Yi Haoran smoothly found out night shift, patrol situation of City Gates and Three Headquarters etc places. This was crucial to their raid.

Through traitors they also got weapons. After Wuzhou Recovery, whether confiscated defeated soldiers surrendered soldiers' weapons or battlefield cleaning recovered weapons, mostly piled in warehouse near dock waiting for sending back. Heavy fire weapons like cannons mostly already transported back Guangzhou as resource recycling. Better quality light fire weapons, sabers spears and armors distributed to Village Braves Militia of various villages, using for armed self defense.

Just like this remaining not transported away weapons still not few. Whether Xie Erren, Luo Yangming or Qian Duo, in their eyes, this wasn't pile of broken copper rotten iron without value. But to Yi Haoran and them, this was best equipment to arm riot personnel. Jiang Suo even got several suits of armors for Gou Er bandit gang, burying in hidden place outside city in advance.

Chang Qingyun through Yi Haoran’s relation contacted Jiang Rongxian. Shopkeeper Jiang hearing had such good chance, immediately agreed following Chang Qingyun to go to Sanheui to see.

This going business immediately hammered down; Jiang Rongxian not only bought all grain embezzled by Liu Youwang and others, also bought all various cloth, miscellaneous goods down. At once let them income almost one thousand taels silver.

Liu Youwang whole life never saw so many white flowering silver. He surrounded official box full of silver looking and looking; holding silver ingots of different sizes different shapes in hand, rubbed unknown how many times. Whole body shivering. So much silver! Don't say himself, even his Liu family’s eighteen generations ancestors added together, probably never earned this much silver!

Thinking back then, self was a little beggar almost starving to death no one cared, wandering begging in Lingao; don't say able to ask silver money; even getting a bowl of proper cooked rice, was today luck exploring shed. Who thought self today surprisingly had such a situation!

All were Chief’s kindness! Liu Youwang at this moment, almost grateful to Senate adding nothing more. All say kindness like giving birth parents—actually Liu Youwang had completely no impression to speak of towards parents; also couldn't say gratitude. Gratitude to Senate was emitted from inner heart.

Thinking here, his tears instantly fell down. Chang Qingyun at side somewhat surprised, asked: "Old Master why sad?"

"I am not sad, is gratitude." Liu Youwang said, "Senate’s kindness truly mountain high water deep! Imperial Grace vast and mighty!"

Listening to his nondescript metaphor, Chang Qingyun secretly funny; heart said Hair thief if giving more kindness to goods like you, Great Ming would have save!

He holding laugh, persuaded: "Old Master says right; all is Chief’s kindness deep thick."

"Fart, you received what Chief’s kindness?" Liu Youwang mood extremely good, taking Chang Qingyun to joke, "You since are Juren Old Master, Grandfather Father must be Wealthy East Big House family."

Chang Qingyun slightly awkwardly smiled, said: "My home where counts as Wealthy East! Otherwise come here being what Advisor! But since captured by Chief, still can get sparing life dragging living in world, isn't it Chief’s great great grace..."

"Speaking is also; if Chief also same style as your Great Ming’s officials, one sentence is: 'Pull out behead', your this head estimated already rotted clean."

Chang Qingyun hehe dry laughed two sounds: "If head all rotted clean, how to handle errand for Old Master."

"Speaking also right; so Senate are all our great benefactors. Old Chang you are truly a capable person na." Chang Qingyun three down two down settled buyer of grain for Liu Youwang, making Liu Youwang look at him more with new eyes; in words also close much.

"Old Master praises wrongly, praises wrongly."

"That Opera Chest..."

"All on Student body; guarantee Old Master satisfied!"

"Good good," Liu Youwang patting his own belly; had heart wanted to take an ingot silver from box rewarding Chang Qingyun, but unwilling; hesitated for good a while then said, "You leave first."

Liu Youwang watching Chang Qingyun leave, heart secretly annoyed. Early knew this Chang Qingyun was such talent, should force him out early "Assisting" self; why need mix with Jiang Yougong? This one thousand some taels silver vainly want to share to him four hundred taels; thinking huge unwillingness in heart.

Thinking here, he more thinking more annoyed; felt Jiang Yougong this goods "Not authentic." Had heart wanted not to share to him. But thinking this Sanheui still had to rely on his protection; had to swallow this thought back. However, he left a back hand; only said sold grain; didn't mention sold cloth miscellaneous goods; swallowed two hundred taels silver first.

Jiang Yougong where knew Liu Youwang’s mind; hearing grain sold out, immediately came over discussing how to send silver to Zhu Si.

Directly holding silver to Zhu Si’s lodging was not working—Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen where National Army Battalion HQ located had many people mixed eyes; one hundred silver heavy heavy, not good to carry not good to hide. Australians very vigilant to subordinates taking bribes; and current pay and provisions used all silver dollar circulation coupons. This one hundred taels silver once seen by people, this Zhu Si couldn't explain.

"Inviting him here giving him isn't it fine?" Liu Youwang said, "My place absolutely safe."

"He collecting silver here of course safe; but how bring back? This is one hundred taels silver. Heavy heavy can't put in pocket; need to prepare special box—returning to Battalion HQ, someone seeing how to say?"

"Could it be still have daring to ask him?"

"This but hard to say ah," Jiang Yougong low voice said, "You always should know, Chief everywhere has eye lines..."

This sentence made Liu Youwang who lived comfortably recently scared out a body cold sweat. Senate everywhere having ears eyes eye lines this matter, naturalized citizens more or less knew a bit; however, never had people daring to discuss these matters publicly.

"This I of course know; otherwise how say my place safe? Anyhow not a single naturalized citizen."

"Problem is city inside everywhere are!"

"This is hard."

Two people both fell into silence. Liu Youwang no experience; Jiang Yougong didn't have either: he defected to Hair for these years, not that didn't meet corruption things; but first didn't have such big amount; second Lingao long gone silver this saying; all using circulation coupons; instead convenient much. Great Ming’s experience possessed not few; but no way to apply directly.

"This matter you also no use!" Liu Youwang said, "I see, better invite Mr. Chang to discuss!"

"Also only so." Jiang Yougong said, "I avoid a bit first; avoiding he seeing people many unwilling to open mouth."

Chang Qingyun called back hearing was this matter, brain instantly turned a few turns. Heart calculated properly, then opened mouth asked: "Method has; but also only can be temporary..."

"You say first!"

"Method not sending silver directly many are; just under Australian rule mostly can't use. But right now has a method usable." Chang Qingyun said, "Fine a substantial shop without too much interaction with Australian..."

Specific operation was depositing silver into this shop; other party issuing a secret mark small seal would do. When needing, directly write a strip, stamp small seal; as long as within quota, shopkeeper seeing this seal would give silver directly.

Wanting more complex method of course also had; not only could deposit withdraw silver anytime; also could wash money white. But Chang Qingyun thought no this necessity—now was war time state; making too complex, instead would attract people suspicion.

"This method good! Then how say only can temporary?" Liu Youwang asked.

"Australians all use circulation coupons; now war affairs tense; this matter temporarily shelved; wait war affairs calm, naturally want to assume; at that time silver withdraw exchange will be troublesome..."

"You TM worry blindly JB!" Liu Youwang laughed, "This not count matter! I deposited silver have to give silver; others care his ball."

He thought thought, said: "This method good; I see my that part also can save like this; otherwise placing by body also not peace heart; afraid people check, afraid people steal. According to your this method much proper! Just handle according to your idea!"
