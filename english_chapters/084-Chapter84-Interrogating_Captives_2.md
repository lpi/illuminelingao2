# Chapter 84 - Interrogating Captives (2)

"This lowly one is named Zhang Xingjiao, originally a Tongsheng (child student)." That person knelt on the ground trembling. Guo Yi and the others didn't impose their set of equality concepts on these captives; unequal pressure was advantageous to them instead.

"Tongshen (Boy body)?" Mu Min frowned, "Virgin? Does he practice Boy Kung Fu?"

Xiong Buyou almost laughed out loud: "It's Tongsheng, a scholar who hasn't passed the examination for Xiucai."

Everyone looked at this person carefully. Although dressed in rags and with dark skin, careful observation showed his hands and feet were not rough or large; he was not a man of hard labor background.

Zhang Xingjiao saw they had some smiles and sighed self-mockingly: "This lowly one failed in studying, making the deputy masters laugh. My family was originally local natives here, farming for generations, passing down a few mu of fields from ancestors. There is a big clan named Gou in the village. Because several wealthy households appeared in the clan and could speak with the clerks in the yamen, they tyrannized the village. My father was angry but couldn't do anything, so he supported me to study, hoping I could pass the examination for a title to support the household and not be bullied by his family. But this lowly one is useless, failing the exam all the time."

Probably feeling ashamed, his face also turned red: "Studying requires money. The family sold a few mu of land, and household expenses were already tight. The plow ox at home suddenly died. Everyone said it was done by the Gou family. We had no evidence, and secondly didn't have the power to engage in a lawsuit with him. Father was angry and anxious, and fell seriously ill. Where do farm households have spare money? Out of helplessness, we sold the remaining four mu of land with a contract. Could have sold for a few more coins, but the Gou family relied on familiarity with the clerks in the yamen, forcibly stopped other big households from buying, and suppressed the land price severely. The money got from selling land was not even half of usual..."

"Forced buying and selling." Mu Min nodded sympathetically.

"The land was sold, but after father knew this, he was even more angry. Dragged on for a few months, money was spent, and the person was gone—" Zhang Xingjiao wiped tears, "This is not all. The Gou family was so bad-hearted that they colluded with the Shiye (private advisor) managing money and grain in the yamen, not transferring the tax registration of that four mu of land. My family's land was sold, but still had to pay money and grain taxes every summer and autumn. Where in the world is such unreasonable thing?"

Such a thing exists? Several people felt very surprised. This was quite common in the middle and late Ming Dynasty, called "Property gone but grain tax remains": land is sold, but the tax burden does not decrease at all, while the buyer does not have to pay tax and grain. Often causing farmers to be forced to flee after losing land.

"These years, the court's money and grain taxes are particularly heavy, plus Liao supplies tax. This really suffers small households like us! This lowly one asked the buyer why the tax was not transferred? It was clearly written on the document. The head of the Gou family said he had already spoken to the Shiye managing money and grain in the yamen; the non-transfer of tax had nothing to do with him. This lowly one ran to the city in vain for a few trips, but was scolded by the Shiye instead, saying this lowly one was a crafty person."

The tent was silent. Those captives sitting on the ground waiting for interrogation were deeply moved by what he recounted. Most people had grievances of one kind or another. Hearing him speak miserably, some wept silently, some bit their lips tightly, remembering their own encounters, hearts filled with resentment and indignation.

"Sold land still forced to pay taxes. Once the deadline for payment arrived, yamen runners came to the countryside to arrest people with fire warrants and summons, holding water-fire sticks, iron chains, and handcuffs, like wolves and tigers. Once at home, without allowing explanation, beat people on sight, smashed pots and bowls on sight, arrested this lowly one to the county for 'chasing and comparing' (flogging to urge payment). Comparing every three days, beating this lowly one until no skin was intact, and then cangue for public display... Was originally unable to live, fortunately, a few schoolmates from the years of studying who were studying in the county school begged the instructor and admonisher for mercy, saving a small life. Returning home, that Gou family colluded with the runners again, in the name of paying tax grain on behalf of this lowly one, coerced this lowly one, and seized the few fen of house foundation and grave foundation of this lowly one's family with false money and real contracts. Pity my family's ancestral graves for generations were all dug up by him..." Speaking of this, he pounded his head on the ground, crying loudly without stopping.

Going to fight this time, the big households in the village felt that since he had no long possessions and no family property, it didn't matter if this person died, so they forcibly tied him up with three other people and sent them to the city as militia. He was originally in the route attacking Bopu. Because he was weak and couldn't run fast, he was caught.

Asked a few more who wanted to join, the stories were largely the same, all people forced by big households and the government to be unable to go on, everyone having blood feuds. Everyone sympathized with them after listening.

"This matter should be reported to the Executive Committee." Mu Min wiped her red eyes, "The common people are too bitter. Land reform must be carried out!"

Guo Yi also sympathized in his heart, but he had no interest in land reform. He also expressed his sympathy for Mu Min's lament to avoid being called cold-blooded, but he didn't say a word about land reform and the like—who knows what the leaders think! Newcomers should be more cautious in speech. But from this matter, he had an idea. This idea, combined with the content of the Executive Committee's post-war review meeting last night he heard from Shao Zong today, he felt there was a great possibility of being adopted.

"Strike big households?" Wen Desi looked at Xiao Zishan with some surprise.

"En," Xiao Zishan nodded, "More precisely, strike local tyrants and evil gentry."

"Zishan, we discussed it at the time, not engaging in that land reform set."

"We don't do land reform, just strike big households. Frankly speaking, it's doing that set of enforcing justice on behalf of heaven, robbing the rich to help the poor." Xiao Zishan took out a few pages of paper, "This is Guo Yi's suggestion and some materials he obtained during the interrogation process. Utilize the data mastered from interrogation to strike a batch of big households with public indignation. First, gather people's hearts and warn the stubborn locals not to confront us; second, obtain a large amount of grain and materials."

These few pages recorded the situations of big households with misdeeds provided by captives, including population, defense, fields, property, etc. Very detailed, some even included how many pigs and cows in the family, and where gold and silver might be hidden. Simply a detailed robbery guide. Transmigrators only need to follow the map, it's not hard to make a fortune.

Naturally, the so-called robbing the rich to help the poor has mainly been helping one's own poverty since ancient times. But this set of things has great attraction for common people. Although common people actually won't get much benefit, subverting the daily order that oppresses them and knocking down the people high above to the ground is still full of temptation for many people.

The Executive Committee discussed it. This suggestion received strong support from a group of radicals. For the moderates, the original "hunting" was randomly looking for attack targets, likely killing some people who shouldn't be killed and damaging the interests of a group of people who shouldn't be damaged, burying hidden dangers for future administrative construction. After adopting this plan, the "hunting" plan can become clear in target, coupled with the slogan that can attract and agitate the people: "Eliminate violence and pacify the good, rob the rich to help the poor". Simply had the effect of finishing touch. Both sides felt satisfied, and looked at student Guo Yi with new eyes.

"We indeed need to hit a few big households to supplement materials." Wu Nanhai, as the person in charge of agriculture and food departments, lowered his voice and said to everyone, "Originally I wanted to remind about the grain issue."

He opened a notebook: "Our grain reserve is based on 1 kg per person per day, continuously supplying rice and flour for 60 days. The total reserve is 35 tons. After D-Day, most people are actually rationed at 600-800 grams per day, because we can ration relatively more protein and fat, including canned food, instant food, and sea fish, reducing the demand for carbohydrates. Thus the daily grain consumption is 350 kg, so grain consumption is less than expected. The reserve can last about 15 days more than expected. But this number does not include captives.

"The number of captives Wu De reported to me today is 138. Calculated at 300 grams per person per day—if they are to do heavy physical labor, this ration is actually not enough—starting tomorrow, 40 kg more grain will be consumed every day. This is not a small number. Sources of grain must be opened up as soon as possible."

"What about our own grain planting plan?" Xiao Zishan knew Wu Nanhai's Agriculture Team brought countless essences of modern agriculture.

"In the past, there was no manpower. Now with more captives, it's easier to handle. Hainan in the 21st century can have three harvests a year. But now is the Little Ice Age. I'm still not clear how cold Hainan is exactly. Have to ask captives before deciding what to plant."

"I remember it snowed in Hainan in the Ming Dynasty."

"This should be a special case, but the temperature being a few degrees lower is certain. Two harvests a year should be possible. Hope to allocate more captives to me. To be honest, I'm not very assured about otakus farming..."

Xiao Zishan noted his request in his own notebook.

"Also salt. Must find a source or produce it ourselves as soon as possible. The Agriculture Team has one ton of salt, enough for temporary use, but now because many pickled products need to be made, consumption is quite fast. Other departments also have needs and all apply to the Agriculture Team, which makes it hard for me."

"Salt shouldn't be hard to handle, right? I remember Hainan is one of the places where large-scale sun-drying salt started earliest in China. There are many salt fields along the coast of Beibu Gulf and Qiongzhou Strait."

"Must start construction of a salt field as soon as possible."

"This is easy to say," Wang Luobin was full of confidence, "When I was a child in Guangxi, I often went to play at the seaside salt fields and know how to dry salt." He frowned, "But drying salt is hard labor work. It's okay if it's mechanized production. If using manpower, the labor force is not enough now."

"No need to trouble, we can go rob..." Yu Eshui opened a book, "According to the county annals, there is an official salt field on the Maniao Peninsula not far from us. Presumably, the salt there is enough for us to use."

"Go rob salt. The chemical department needs this very much. Have to allocate some manpower."

"Let's sort out what projects need to be satisfied exactly. Then talk about how to distribute manpower."
