# Chapter 1140 - Arrival in Kaohsiung

Of course, in Wei Bachi's secret diary, he depicted a grander blueprint. His imagination didn't exceed the All-Union People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs. In his diary, his ideal General Administration Bureau was itself an empire: possessing its own armed forces, laws, factories, farms, and social organizations. And he, Wei Bachi, Empire Senator, was the General Administration Bureau's chief architect, builder, manager, maintainer, and guardian of its order. A cold, ruthless decision-making machine, a strict administrator...

Since the Organization Department had no intention of establishing such a prominent position, plus the bubbling lust for power in his self-statement, Wei Bachi continued as a foreman in the Lingao Construction Corporation. However, when using "forced labor," Wei Bachi was more often appointed as organizer. At the start of Operation Engine, the dual effect of Wei Bachi's skills plus foreman experience led to his appointment as Mayor of Kaohsiung, organizing the development of the Kaohsiung area.

Appointing such a person as mayor mainly resulted from Headquarters' current positioning of Kaohsiung. Currently, the primary purpose of Kaohsiung Base was population purification and transshipment. Large numbers of refugees transported from Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Zhejiang would be concentrated here for purification and quarantine, then most would be transshipped to Hainan to fill the Committee's schools, farms, factories, and construction sites.

Wei Bachi's primary task, besides managing the refugee camps, was to fully exploit the refugees' labor during their quarantine camp stay—the Planning Committee disliked people eating for free. So during the days refugees waited for quarantine and transshipment, Wei Bachi had to arrange labor for them to develop the Tainan plain—the Committee had high hopes for agriculture in this region.

This task was very difficult. First, refugee mortality was high. Amidst the chaos of the late Ming, plagues were frequent: smallpox, cholera, typhoid... every imaginable infectious disease was found in the refugee camps. Especially virulent smallpox, transmitted via respiratory tract, had extremely high mortality. As weather warmed, various infectious diseases entered outbreak periods. For this, the Ministry of Health stipulated refugees in collection points must undergo 12 days of preliminary quarantine locally before boarding ships. Even so, transmission couldn't be completely isolated. Second, arriving refugees were mostly exhausted and weak; regaining ability to work required considerable recovery time. And when refugees finally passed the quarantine period safely and recovered some physical fitness, it was often time to leave Taiwan.

So while the total population under Wei Bachi's jurisdiction was large, the actual usable labor force wasn't much. Especially few were capable of heavy manual labor. Relatively speaking, only refugees transshipped from Jeju Island refugee camps were physically fit enough to be fully utilized. This caused severe delays in many Tainan development projects Wei Bachi wanted to undertake.

Standing on the Fengshan observation platform, Wei Bachi could see magnificent, continuous wooden buildings extending from the coastline inland. They looked quite imposing. According to the precise tables updated daily, the resident population inside rarely dropped below forty thousand.

But Wei Bachi knew these people's current contribution to the Committee was pitifully small, while the attrition rate in the refugee camps was alarming.

Every day, over a dozen people were transferred from quarantine camps to the isolation zone. Once sent to the isolation zone, they were divided into different wards by disease. Isolation wards for the most terrifying, highly infectious diseases were built separately on sandbars. People who died in the isolation zone were cremated on a designated desolate sandbar. Even the isolation wards themselves would be burned down periodically and new ones built.

Epidemics were a ticking time bomb always weighing on Wei Bachi's heart. And the land reclamation and water conservancy statistics tables sent by the Planning Committee made him frown even more.

What was more deadly was that every ship from Lingao brought files, notices, and statistical forms from various ministries and commissions. Wei Bachi found himself drowing in a terrifying sea of paperwork.

Wei Bachi was no longer so jubilant about being "Governor of Taiwan." Although he had the most "subjects" and strongest military force, the situation he faced was also the most complex. Thinking of the pile of documents on his desk and the locked "confidential dispatch box" full of papers on a ship entering port, Wei Bachi groaned in despair—he hadn't had the interest to let his life secretary into the bedroom for many days.

"A knife not sharpened soon rusts," he muttered, watching the convoy entering the harbor. Several days ago he'd received a telegram from the General Office notifying him that Committee members were coming to Kaohsiung for several projects.

"And building a lighthouse too. Do they think I don't have enough to do?" Wei Bachi's mood worsened.

White smoke puffed from the Kaohsiung Harbor battery, followed by the boom of cannons. This was the salute welcoming the Committee members. Wei Bachi stood up, adjusted his cotton-linen blend tropical uniform, put on his pith helmet, and walked briskly toward the pier where the "Spanish Whore" was docking. behind him, a group of life secretaries and attendants followed.

Wei Bachi and Liu Zheng's group had only met a few times at annual meetings and Committee assemblies with little professional interaction. By comparison, he was very familiar with Zhong Lishi; the Taibai Observatory had been built by convicts under Wei Bachi's command.

The Committee members exchanged pleasantries on the pier. Dr. Zhong instructed again that unloading must be done with extreme care. Then, surrounded by attendants, they got into Wei Bachi's "official vehicle"—thanks to the Jeju Island campaign, over a hundred horses had been shipped from Jeju. Li Chiqi and Minister Hong immediately reported to the General Office to allocate the stock of "official use" carriages to various places. Because Wei Bachi dealt with diplomatic matters involving Dutch and other foreigners, he was allocated two.

Before getting in the carriage, Dr. Zhong glanced at the newly built Kaohsiung Customs Building. The two-story red brick building predictably had a clock tower built on it—this time it wouldn't have to be empty.

The carriage started and sped along the cinder-paved road. As a naval port and coaling station, Kaohsiung had piles of cinders and ash from warships, so road hardening was well done. New telegraph poles lined the main road. Workers with "Lingao Telecom" on their backs were climbing poles to lay telegraph lines.

The carriage drove along the newly paved "Senate Avenue" toward "City Hall"—which was also Wei Bachi's "Mayoral Mansion." This building was the work of Zhang Xingpei of Lingao Construction Corporation. It looked no different from a small town city hall in Europe or America in the old timeline. Zhang Xingpei excelled at prefabricated wooden structures. Because they were quick to assemble and aesthetically practical, they were widely used in new zone development. From Kaohsiung City Hall down to refugee dormitory longhouses, all used this architecture.

City Hall was built on a stone foundation half a person high, coated with white lime outside, looking imposing and beautiful in the sunlight. Even by Committee members' standards, this official residence was quite good. Of course, this City Hall also couldn't do without a clock tower.

In front of City Hall was Kaohsiung Civic Square. Half the square's ground was paved with crushed stone. A deep trench cut through the middle. Workers were laying bricks at the bottom. Around the square, plots had been marked with bamboo poles and white lime lines, preparing for the construction of various public and commercial buildings. Some plots already had temporary bamboo sheds; others had started construction. Gravel, cement, yellow sand, and lime were piled everywhere. Professional construction workers and labor teams from Lingao shuttled back and forth; steam pile drivers and work chantys echoed each other.

"This is the main drainage canal. A new city must be solid from underground up." Wei Bachi had been in low spirits, but since he'd created all this, he couldn't help boasting before the Committee members. He pointed frequently at construction sites. "Lot of rain here; if drainage isn't done right, there'll be problems." Then he pointed at surrounding buildings, introducing their functions. The two largest plots were reserved for the Agricultural Committee and the Navy. Both had established offices here. Currently, local construction in Kaohsiung mainly revolved around these two departments.

On these two plots, temporary bamboo sheds had been built and "Office" signs erected. Naturalized officers and cadres went in and out; couriers with documents arrived constantly. It looked extremely busy.
