# Chapter 2816 Banquet

"Going to war—swords and spears have no eyes. Some will always lose their lives. That's fate!" Old Master Chen said with emotion. "When Little Five from our family went to be a soldier, his parents cried their hearts out. I told them to stop crying—if he's fated to die, no amount of crying will bring him back. If he's fated for this fortune, he'll come back even through a mountain of swords and sea of fire. We're fisher folk. Once out to sea, we never know if we'll return. The only difference is, before we risked our lives just to survive; now we can risk our lives for fortune."

He pointed at the Private tending to the guests: "When Little Fa came back on leave this time, the family asked if he should apply for discharge. I said there's no need. Our family has such a big business—someone has to protect it. We can't just rely on others." He glanced meaningfully at a middle-aged couple busy serving food and drink in the distance, seemingly with some disdain, or perhaps some pity. "I'm old. Can't go to sea anymore. Can only sit at home putting on appearances. If I were ten years younger, I'd want to go out and try my luck too."

Then he asked the village head: "Heard they're recruiting immigrants again?"

"That's right," the village head said. "This came up at the commune meeting the other day. Those willing to go get money, positions, and land..."

The stationed police looked mysterious: "This hasn't been officially announced yet..."

The village head was quite dismissive: "What's so mysterious about it? Plenty of people have emigrated these past two years. The house your guy lives in now was originally assigned to Old Zheng the Donkey. He took his whole family to Jeju Island. Not many in the village know how to handle livestock; he counts as one. Heard he didn't want to go and was literally dragged there." The village head lowered his voice for the last part, seeming to realize the secret was unseemly. The words were barely out when he felt it was improper—there were two Fubo Army NCOs here, practically half-officials themselves.

"Being dragged there isn't bad either," the militia captain said indifferently. "He went crying, but now he's laughing. He went there to enjoy his blessings! A while back during militia target practice, we happened to be at the same range as the Cavalry Training Squadron. Heard all the immigrants from Lingao to Jeju Island became cadres, were given houses and grain, and specifically manage horse-breeding. More women than men there. They say at matchmaking sessions, it's groups of women picking them. That old bachelor is blessed now!"

At such topics that all men love to hear, everyone stirred. They began exercising their imagination in a babble of voices, even recounting legends about Senators selecting personal secretaries. The air was filled with merriment.

Just as the topic was careening toward Political Security Bureau tea sessions, Tan Shuangxi cut in timely: "Have many people emigrated these past two years? I mean not just our village, but other places too."

"Lots," the accountant's face was red from drinking. "The Senators' territory has expanded so much; officials are needed everywhere. Where do the cadres come from? Naturally, only the most trusted. Lingao is where the Senate rose to power. Everyone here counts as a founding loyalist. Sanya, everyone knows, so I won't say more. The past two years it was mainly Taiwan and Jeju Island. At first, just for work. Over time, they brought their families over and simply never came back. A poor *xiucai* who came to Lingao on the same boat as me started teaching in the quarantine camp, then was sent somewhere... what's it called... Kaohsiung! Came back once to move and chatted with me. Said things were pretty well built over there. Lots of people who can do hard labor but few who can manage, so plenty of chances for promotion. He signed up to emigrate. A few days ago, I saw his name in the newspaper—well look at that... Deputy Principal of Kaohsiung National School. In Lingao, you think his Class A diploma could get him teaching at Fangcaodi? A few from our village left too. Old Zheng the Donkey... the village head already mentioned. And that guy from the east end of the village, went to the fishery cooperative in Hongji and got some minor position, married a local woman. Probably won't come back either."

The militia captain took a sip of tea, used his finger to pick up fish crumbs from the oil paper package and licked them, then said with satisfaction as everyone stared at him in a daze: "Heard it's not just one wife."

Everyone laughed together. It took a while before things quieted down.

"They say this immigration drive is to the south, called something... I didn't catch it. Anyway, in the Hongji direction. The terms are quite good: a moving subsidy upfront, then a hundred *mu* of land. You build your own house over there, but bricks, tiles, and timber are all free." The militia captain lowered his head, looking at the wine in his cup and muttering, "If I hadn't been scared witless fleeing disasters... I'd want to go too."

"It's not too late for you. They say for those going to Nanyang, land is free to claim. Claim it and it's yours; farm as much as you can. Just don't work yourself to death."

...

The sun gradually sank below the horizon, dyeing the blue of the sky deeper. Golden afterglow lit up the clouds at the horizon, gilding the beach, buildings, and people by the sea. Flocks of birds returning to roost began circling above the village, more clamorous than before. Women shielding their eyes with their hands called for their children to come home for dinner.

Isn't the south just the sea? Tan Shuangxi had never imagined one day moving to a faraway foreign land. But at this moment, he felt that place whose name he didn't even know must be as beautiful as this village at this very moment.

The silence lasted a long time. It was broken by Chen Kefa, who had been quiet for ages: "Fate is something you earn yourself."

He didn't look at the others. He picked up a chopstick of fried dried fish, then unhurriedly drank a sip of wine before continuing to speak to the fish heads on the plate, head bowed.

"Is becoming an official in Jeju Island good? Sure, you get a position. But you have to command a bunch of people who don't even understand what you say. Easy? Not easy. Those are... they don't even count as Miao or Yi. Who knows when they'll go crazy and draw knives; they won't hold back at all. You still remember those Jin siblings from the newspaper, right? Is becoming an official in Taiwan good? Sure. But the miasma from land reclamation has killed many too. The sailors told me on the boat. Is Hongji good? Sure. Heard there are more women than men, and you can marry as many as you can support. But coal mining—any day the mine could collapse, and you won't even find a corpse. You all think fishing earns a lot. Sure it does. But fishermen all know, the moment we go to sea, we've already got one foot in the gates of hell. Set out on a cloudless day; haven't even cast the nets yet when a rogue wind and freak wave capsizes the boat. Our family—which generation hasn't lost several people at sea? Six months ago, Fourth Uncle also died at sea. Pricked his hand on a fish spine, didn't think much of it. Started feverish, headed back. Didn't live to see shore. There's no easy work under heaven. If you want a good life, you have to risk your life to earn it. Besides, you still have a choice, don't you?"

"If you ask me, what's the difference between life now and before? It's that now you can risk your life for a good life—go to Jeju Island, go to Taiwan, go fishing, join the army... Before, you wanted to risk your life to make an exchange, but was there anywhere to make that exchange? When I first joined the army, did I do it to risk my life for fortune? No. It was because the family really couldn't make ends meet. No choice!"

Whether from the wine or not, Chen Kefa's eyes started reddening. He grabbed the bottle and downed two cups in a row. Night had shrouded the village. The sea breeze with a touch of coolness swept through the courtyard. A gust made the kerosene lamp's flame sway, passing across the Private's face. In the alternating light and shadow, two tear tracks flashed for an instant.

"Is being a soldier good? Sure. Enough to eat and wear, travel everywhere, gain experience, learn some skills. Besides, this life was won by us shouldering rifles; I don't regret it. But I'm scared. Scared that one day I won't come back. Even more scared that I'll come back but my brothers in the unit won't. The moment I got home, I went out to sea. I was afraid Elder Sister Li would come looking for me. Only dared to come back to the village after you'd been to Li Anze's home. I'm scared Elder Sister Li will ask me: you came back; how come my brother didn't? Even if she doesn't ask, there'll always be someone in my heart asking..."

Here, he couldn't go on.

Silence all around. Even the children playing between the banquet tables had quieted down. The village head, seeing the heavy mood, hurried to smooth things over: "Life and death are fated; wealth and honor are decreed by heaven! Don't overthink it. Just do your job well in the army! Earn an officer's future later, and your family will bring glory to its ancestors!"

Chen Kefa's face was also a bit red. He gave a cold laugh: "Bringing glory to ancestors, naturally. Alive, it's glory; dead, it's honor. What's not good about that? I accept it."

These words didn't sound quite right. Tan Shuangxi was afraid something might happen next that could ruin this send-off atmosphere for the new recruits. He immediately cut in: "What's all this talk about life and death? Our Fubo Army goes out to battle—when have we not been overwhelming, sweeping everything before us like a storm? The only time casualties were a bit higher was during the bandit suppression later. Now bandits are handled by the National Army. When we form up for battle, we never lose..." He spoke so urgently his face flushed. He almost said, "the chance of dying in battle is very small."

These words were rather awkward. Zhang Laicai immediately followed up: "Brother Chen is right. Before, it was sitting and waiting to die, not even a way out! Since the Senate came, everyone has a way out, right?"

Everyone hurried to smooth things over. The table quickly recovered its merry atmosphere. But Tan Shuangxi had a vague feeling Chen Kefa still had words unsaid. He knew one thing, though: Chen Kefa wouldn't apply for discharge. He would go back to the unit.

In the night sky, the Milky Way spanned the heavens, stretching from Scorpius and Sagittarius in the south to Altair and Vega at the zenith. To the southeast, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars also adorned the night sky. Beneath this vast firmament, the inky boundless sea surged onto the beach again and again before retreating into the ocean. The night wind swayed a kerosene lamp. The faint glow cast the frozen figures in time very long.
