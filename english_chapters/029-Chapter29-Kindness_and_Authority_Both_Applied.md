# Chapter 29: Kindness and Authority, Both Applied

The four visitors spent the rest of that day very productively. The table of food and wine sent over by Master Gao consisted of the "Four Great Courses"—twelve dishes.

The cuisine differed somewhat from modern Cantonese cooking, but the natural ingredients and careful preparation made for rich, fresh, succulent flavors. A thick soup of "Xi Shi's Tongue" clams was particularly excellent, drawing appreciative nods from everyone.

Beiwei thought: *Being a leader really is great. Where would ordinary folks get a chance to indulge like this in the Ming Dynasty?* While he was musing, Gao Qing's wife, Gao Xian, brought out from the kitchen a freshly reheated main dish—a full plate of meatballs the size of pigeon eggs, floating in a shallow clear broth, glistening and tender, sprinkled with bright green scallions.

Wen Desi picked up his spoon first and put one in his mouth. One bite, and fresh, clean flavors filled his palate, with a subtle tingle of Sichuan pepper lingering in the aftertaste. Director Wen had mixed in social circles in his own timespace; though not one for lavish banquets every other day, his dining experience was among the best of the transmigrators. But this mouthful stumped him—he couldn't identify what it was made of. It seemed like chicken but also like seafood. He asked:

"What is this?"

"This is 'Land and Sea Treasure.'" Gao Xian replied softly. "It's made from soft-shelled turtle meat, silver fish, chicken, frog, and white shrimp, all mixed together. Does it please you, sir?"

"Excellent—truly delicious."

"Mm, indeed very good."

"The landlord class really does live decadently." Engineer Wang wore an envious expression—clearly wanting to be decadent but unable.

"Such a fuss over some meatballs!" Beiwei curled his lip.

"Almost every dish has Sichuan pepper—it somewhat ruins what would otherwise be wonderful flavor." Wen Desi shook his head regretfully. "The ingredients are so fresh and natural..."

"This seems to be a Ming-era cooking habit. The Ming was also an important market in the Southeast Asian spice export trade."

"That entrepôt trade is worth doing."

As they were talking, Gao Xian brought out six small plates of cured snacks to accompany the wine. She came to warm the wine, but found the jar of Jinhua wine sent with the meal completely untouched. She hesitated:

"The masters don't drink wine?"

"We don't drink." Because they feared alcohol might cause problems, they didn't touch a drop in Ming-era timespace.

"If the masters don't wish to drink wine, I have some flower essence I distilled myself. Diluted with water, would that suit?"

"Flower essence—like cologne?" Everyone was startled.

"Yes, I distilled it myself. Right now I only have rice-leaf and perilla. If the masters don't mind, please try some."

When brought out, it turned out to be aromatic essential-oil liquid distilled from plant leaves and flowers. Ming-era distilling technology was already mature; small alembics, besides making liquor, were commonly used to make flower essences.

Diluted with clear water, it had an elegant, refreshing fragrance.

But Xiao Zishan was growing suspicious. This Gao Xian was supposedly a tenant farmer's wife who did menial work at the Gao household—yet she knew how to make flower essence and understood fine recipes... He studied this woman more carefully and found that in her movements and bearing there was a certain refinement, not the awkwardness of her husband.

Intent on investigating, he stopped her and asked: "Sister Gao, you've served in a grand household before, haven't you?"

Gao Xian startled visibly and said quietly: "Yes, I've always been at the Gao mansion..."

"That can't be right. At the Gao mansion you did rough work. How would you know the recipe for 'Land and Sea Treasure'? And where did you learn to make flower essence?"

Gao Xian became even more flustered, stammering: "I... the other servant women taught me... forgive my presumption, sir..."

"How old are you?"

"This servant is thirty."

Xiao Zishan looked at her face—darkened now, but still showing traces of youthful beauty—and thought of Gao Lujie's appearance, and the age difference between this couple. He understood seven or eight parts of it, though there was no need to speak it aloud now.

After a moment's thought, he glanced outside the hall. No one else was there; Gao Qing was probably working in the back courtyard. He said:

"These past days—has Gao Qing often gone to Master Gao's?"

"..." Gao Xian started violently but said nothing. Xiao Zishan knew he was right: Master Gao must regularly have Gao Qing report on them.

"And Steward Yan comes often too?" Xiao Zishan continued slowly.

"Never came... only occasionally..."

"Which is it—never, or occasionally?!"

"It's... occasionally, just visiting as acquaintances..." Gao Xian lied with difficulty. Under this barrage of questions, she was already panicking. Master Xiao's words implied he knew everything, including her past—but how could that be? While she was in turmoil, she saw Xiao Zishan's expression darkening. Knowing things were bad, she dropped to her knees before the table:

"This servant deserves death. I shouldn't have deceived the masters..."

Beiwei had been a revolutionary soldier under the red flag; he couldn't stand seeing this. He was about to speak when Wen Desi stopped him. Though Xiao Zishan's questioning was sudden, it was part of their plan to win hearts.

"He's come quite a few times, hasn't he? I imagine he's even looked into the courtyard where we stay."

"No, no." Gao Xian's face went pale with fear.

"And he's promised you—if one day we return to Australia, he'll take you back into the Gao household. Is that so?!"

Gao Xian trembled all over—*the masters know everything!* She silently cursed her husband for his lack of backbone. Every time Steward Yan coaxed and threatened, he agreed to let him search around. Though nothing had been discovered, this was still the crime of betraying one's masters!

"This servant deserves death. It's all my husband's fault..." Gao Xian prostrated herself in confession, confessing everything about Steward Yan's visits and words during their absences.

"My husband is soft-eared and weak-minded; he was foolish to heed that man's nonsense," Gao Xian said, now sobbing. "I beg the masters, considering his age and his leg ailment, to spare him the household punishment. This servant is willing to take double punishment on his behalf."

Everyone listened, finding it matched their prior estimates. Seeing her beg so pitifully for her husband, they couldn't help but feel sympathy. *You don't know how sweet the new society is until you've been in the old one.*

Xiao Zishan deliberately waited a long while, then heaved a theatrical sigh:

"Sister Gao, since your whole family came under us, have we ever wronged you?"

"You put me to shame, sir. The masters' kindness—our whole family is endlessly grateful."

"When your provisions ran short, we gave extra monthly rice. When the children grew and had no spending money, we gave them wages. I don't ask for gratitude—I only hoped that having traveled ten thousand *li* to find a foothold here, we'd have a peaceful place to rest. I'd prefer not to be scrutinized in every detail."

Gao Xian said nothing, only sobbed and kowtowed repeatedly.

"Get up."

"I dare not. Please punish this servant severely to uphold household discipline."

Xiao Zishan thought this woman really had her routines down—clearly not an ordinary farmer's wife.

"Without rules, nothing succeeds. You and Gao Qing were at fault, but we hadn't set rules beforehand. We'll count this as ignorance, not crime. Get up."

"Thank the masters for their grace." Gao Xian heard the change in his tone and figured they wouldn't be thrown out. A beating she could endure; she was afraid of angering the masters and being expelled. Even if Master Gao took them back, there'd be no good days ahead for them.

"Do you understand what comes next?"

"Yes, this servant understands."

"I know you're not from a small household. You understand propriety far better than Gao Qing. From now on, guide him well—teach him to know his place!"

"I understand, I understand." Gao Xian nodded repeatedly.

"As long as you serve diligently and loyally, whether or not we return to Australia, we won't leave you without a future. Make the most of this chance."

"This servant thanks—" Gao Xian was about to kneel again in gratitude, but Xiao Zishan stopped her—*better not to play the grand landlord too much in front of everyone.* "Go call Gao Di."

After Gao Xian left, Xiao Zishan turned to the others: "How was my performance?" He was eager to shift the atmosphere in the hall. He didn't want to leave an impression of being tyrannical. *Performance*—yes, just a performance.

Wen Desi's jaw dropped: "Zishan, are you really from poor-peasant stock?"

"Of course."

"You're a Golden Horse Award-winning actor." Engineer Wang also marveled.

"You scared that poor woman. Wasn't that overkill?" Beiwei felt some sympathy.

"It was a bit much, but for *kindness and authority, both applied*, this is the minimum." Xiao Zishan nodded. "We're surrounded by eyes. If we don't change this situation, we can't carry out any work later."

Wen Desi said: "The favors we gave them before were 'kindness.' Now it's time to show 'authority.'"

"Yes," Xiao Zishan explained. Since they couldn't yet remove these "eyes," they could only turn them around.

"Will this be enough?"

"It's just the beginning. Loyalty isn't built with a few words. Recruiting followers is hard."

To gain loyalty: first, one must have power—no one is loyal to a weak individual or organization; second, there must be benefits—with benefits comes motivation. Before, they had given benefits; now they had to demonstrate power. At the right moment, results would follow naturally.

"I read that the time-travel predecessors had it easy—a few words and their followers would kowtow."

"Maybe we don't have that 'main-character aura'?"

"You can have it—I don't want it..."

The atmosphere at the table lightened again. Xiao Zishan secretly exhaled in relief. Actually, he hadn't been entirely confident about this conversation, but he had exploited the woman's fear of her past.

After a while, Gao Di arrived. Though young, he was sharp. Seeing his mother's reddened eyes, he knew something had happened. He hurriedly brought his account book to pay respects.

Wen Desi asked casually about the household situation and reviewed the account book—just a simple ledger; with the house's minimal expenses, it was quickly understood. He praised the boy a bit, and seeing his unease gradually fade, asked:

"Do people from the Gao household come often lately?"

"Often!" The boy didn't hide it, nodding vigorously. "That Little-Hat Yan comes all the time, always whispering with Father."

"Little-Hat Yan?" Wen Desi was momentarily confused, then realized he meant Steward Yan—who regularly wore a six-panel cap.

"What do they talk about?"

Gao Di hesitated slightly. Xiao Zishan said: "Just tell us."

"It seems Little-Hat Yan always asks about the masters' affairs," Gao Di said. "But Father won't let me listen when they're talking."

"Are the Gao household people good to you?"

"Good?" Gao Di didn't quite understand the question. "I don't know if they're good or not. I've never served the Gao household directly. The accountants treat me well, and there are some children I often play with."

"All Gao household servants?"

"Yes—some born in the house, some like me."

"Among those children, are there any you're especially close with?"

"Quite a few—Little Li, Little Qian, the Wang brothers..."

"Good. Come to the study later and make a list." Wen Desi instructed.
