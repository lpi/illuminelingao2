# Chapter 694 - Forcing Peace through War

Finally, at the end of the letter, he wrote that if peace talks were agreed to, a mission would be dispatched from Lingao in a few days. As for the negotiation venue, it could be set in Macao. If Guangdong had a response, they could also entrust the Jesuits in Macao to forward the letter.

"In this humble official's opinion, currently our only option is to negotiate pacification." Li Xijue said cautiously.

Unable to suppress, the only choice was to pay indemnity. Wang Zunde's heart was shrouded in pain. He knew very well that the task of managing this pacification would likely not fall to him. Moreover, the Emperor might not necessarily permit him to offer pacification.

Neither able to suppress nor pacify. He couldn't even speak of any viable countermeasures. This feeling of powerlessness enveloped him, keeping him silent for a long time. He only started when Li Xijue quietly reminded him that he should submit a memorial to the Emperor.

Such a massive defeat could not be concealed no matter what. Once others submitted their memorials, he would lose the initiative even more. Li Xijue could only remind his patron that this matter should be handled sooner rather than later; delay was impermissible.

Wang Zunde nodded. Although he couldn't think of how to write this memorial, what Li Xijue said was entirely correct.

A sense of mental exhaustion clouded his mind. He simply nodded and said: "as you say, sir." saying this, he waved his hand weakly for Li Xijue to leave.

"Secretary Lü's letter—"

"Discuss it another day."

After coming out, Li Xijue gathered the other staff members for a discussion. Everyone agreed to draft the memorial first and submit it to the court as soon as possible, to at least leave themselves a way out. Immediately, a staff member specializing in drafting memorials was arranged to work overnight. Meanwhile, people were sent to Guangzhou city to discuss aftermath arrangements with Governor Li Fengjie and others.

As for peace negotiations, Li Xijue didn't have the audacity to make decisions on his own, and Lü Yizhong's letter couldn't be leaked. He only secretly sent someone to Macao to see if the Australians would go there for further discussions.

The most difficult issue was He Rubin's remnant forces currently trapped in Haikou: several thousand troops surrounded in the Haikou and Qiongshan area, with no food inside and no reinforcements outside, their communication completely cut off. Under the siege of the bald bandit army, it probably wouldn't be long before the entire army was annihilated.

The number of commissioned military officers killed in Chengmai was already shocking. If He Rubin were also killed or captured, it would shake the court and the public even more than the government army's great defeat at Chengmai—comparable to the defeat and death of Lu Qin in the sixth year of the Tianqi reign. That would truly shake Guangdong and Guangxi.

Li Xijue pondered during the staff meeting: "If only we could safely withdraw Commander He and the others."

"With the strait blockaded and our naval forces at a disadvantage, how can they cross?" A staff member shook his head repeatedly.

The bald bandit navy had demonstrated their superiority in small-scale skirmishes blockading the Qiongzhou Strait; the Guangdong navy was powerless to contend with them.

"We must first send spies to sneak into Qiongzhou and make contact with Commander He. After all, we need news on how many troops remain and the state of their morale and supplies."

"What good does knowing do? If we don't quickly pacify the bald bandits, I fear Commander He's troops..."

"Should we report to the Governor-General and have him quickly summon Regional Commander Chen to Zhaoqing for consultation, to see if more troops can be gathered to rescue Commander He?"

Chen Ting was the Guangdong Vice Regional Commander, stationed in Nan'ao. Although nominally a "Vice Regional Commander," he was not actually under He Rubin's command. He was a high-ranking military officer independently guarding a region.

"He has so few troops, what use would they be?" Li Xijue held no hope for any military solution to the stalemate—since twenty thousand government troops failed to take Lingao and suffered a devastating defeat, a mere few thousand would be even less effective.

Silence filled the heated pavilion. The staff and adjutants of the Governor-General's yamen looked at each other. After thinking it over, besides "pacification," there was really no other plan to implement.

In the operations room of the Navy Command Building at Bopu, standing before a wall hung with a huge chart of Guangdong and Hainan, Chief of Naval Operations Chen Haiyang was convening a staff meeting.

Participating in the meeting were the Navy's staff team and several transmigrator officers. Two non-naval officer transmigrators also attended as non-voting delegates; one was Naval Advisor Wen Desi. As an authority on Age of Sail navies and shipbuilding, his voice carried great weight. The other was Xu Ke, who worked at the Intelligence Bureau. This person's current title was Naval Intelligence Staff Officer, specifically responsible for collecting and organizing naval military intelligence. However, according to Xu Ke, he was a "do-anything handyman" at the External Intelligence Bureau.

This unprofessional naval staff team highlighted the Navy's predicament of professionalization. Transmigrators who had served in the navy were fewer than those in the army to begin with, and there were absolutely none who had been staff officers. This meant most staff work fell on the shoulders of the two highest naval authority heads: the People's Commissar of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations, both of whom came from regular naval officer backgrounds. As for Li Di, the naval officer who couldn't go to sea, he had been acting as Fortress Commander and Harbor Master. Now Chen Haiyang simply appointed him Chief of Staff to learn staff business.

Of course, Li Di's academic performance in staff business wasn't great and was still at a beginner's failing level—an amateur naval officer who knew little about basic naval operations had too many lessons to make up to become a professional staff officer.

The Navy had already undertaken the mission of blockading the Qiongzhou Strait. Strictly speaking, this couldn't be counted as blockading the strait, because the Navy actually only blockaded government-controlled ports in Qiongshan County like Shenying Harbor, to prevent the government remnants from receiving reinforcements from the mainland. Other ships entering or leaving the strait were ignored.

Any vessels entering or leaving these ports were seized and escorted to Manyan for processing. All cargo ships attempting to ship goods in or out of Qiongshan ports were confiscated. If it was confirmed to be a civilian ship commandeered by the government, the owner was allowed to redeem the vessel at a low price.

This blockade was devastating to the material circulation of Qiongshan. True, the Fubogun didn't blockade ports in Wenchang and other places still in government hands, but ports in other prefectures and counties were of no help to Qiongshan's own transport—in Hainan's prefectures and counties, bulk cargo transport relied almost entirely on coastal shipping. Given the terrible state of the post roads, long-distance land transport of goods was virtually impossible.

Seeing that the blockading bald bandit warships were mostly small and medium-sized vessels and not numerous, Tang Yunwen attempted several times to break the blockade at sea. The result was a crushing defeat every time—the Navy's ships were incomparable to the Ming navy's medieval level in both equipment and training standards. Finally, the naval ships completely retreated into the Baisha Naval Camp and ceased sorting out.

In this way, Qiongshan was effectively under siege. Although Qiongshan itself didn't lack stored grain, and the summer grain harvest would soon come to market, this despair of losing contact with the outside world caused the morale of the government troops trapped in Qiongshan to plummet further.

The preliminary objective of the maritime blockade had been achieved. The Executive Committee believed the state of war could not continue like this and must be ended as soon as possible—the war's impact on the economy was too great, especially the stagnation of foreign trade. Originally, large amounts of materials, manpower, and money could be obtained from the Guangzhou Station direction every month. Now, apart from a small amount of population and materials still arriving from Foshan, Leizhou, and other places, this channel was basically cut off.

The loss was not only the transport channels but also the commercial network. Before the situation became clear, commercial partners on the mainland were too terrified to continue distributing "Australian goods." As a result, exporting goods to Lingao also became a business with potentially high risks, becoming expensive.

Originally, the Executive Committee planned to wait for Xiong Wencan to come for pacification, and for both sides to hold peace talks. However, it seemed it would still be a stage before Old Xiong could come to serve as Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi—according to historical progression, he wouldn't arrive to take up the post of Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi and Governor of Guangdong until the fifth year of the Chongzhen reign. The transmigrators couldn't wait. They decided to launch "peace work" as soon as possible to end the state of war between the two sides—at the very least, to restore the circulation of goods.

Although many transmigrators doubted how Wang Zunde or Li Fengjie planned to deceive their superiors to cover up this great rout and then sue for peace, the Executive Committee believed that was their business and unrelated to the Yuan Laoyuan—provided they had the willingness to sue for peace.

The Executive Committee had held a secret meeting regarding the development of the post-war situation. They invited about thirty transmigrators to discuss and predict how the situation would develop. The transmigrators believed the possibility of Guangdong officialdom fighting again was extremely small, but they had to guard against the other side potentially adopting the routine of "neither fighting nor making peace, neither surrendering nor leaving."

"During the Opium War, after realizing military means couldn't fight the British at all, Qing local officials dared not sue for peace privately, nor were they willing to throw their lives away in battle. So they adopted such turtle tactics," Yu Eishui warned at the meeting. "If the Guangdong government adopts such methods, the threat to us would largely be the greatest."

In this way, the transmigrator group would have no other method but to follow the British example of constantly expanding the scale of war until forcing the Emperor himself to make a decision to sue for peace. However, the transmigrator group's war potential and war machine could not be mentioned in the same breath as the British in 1840. The last straw that broke Daoguang's resistance—bringing troops to the walls of Nanjing and cutting off grain transport—required long-range projection capabilities that the Navy could not achieve.

"Additionally, we must consider that Qiongzhou itself is too remote and not a critical place on the Ming map. Its fall for five or six years isn't particularly critical to the Ming regime, which is already putting out fires on all sides. They can completely afford to leave it be for now. For us, this means falling into a long-term state of war—even without armed conflict."

Therefore, the keynote of the meeting was to take advantage of the chaos in Guangdong officialdom to quickly spread the flames of war to the foot of Guangzhou, the richest city in South China, forcing Guangdong officialdom to sue for peace before an even worse situation occurred—since Qiongzhou Prefecture was just a borderland, invading the Pearl River Delta directly should be able to shock the officials everywhere in Guangdong. At the very least, Li Fengjie would definitely be unable to sit still. As long as he couldn't sit still, he would have to sue for peace.
