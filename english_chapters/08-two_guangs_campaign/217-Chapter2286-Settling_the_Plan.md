# Chapter 2286: Settling the Plan

If the scale was large enough, maybe Hair thieves would even transfer troops from city to reinforce. This way could weaken number of defenders in city, beneficial for their one stroke breaking in.

However, these days he calculated back and forth, this bit of capital in hand was still not enough. Not to mention thirty percent assurance, even ten percent didn't have.

Fortunately current situation was developing towards direction beneficial to him. Following need of bandit suppression and pacifying Yao Chaos battles, Wuzhou garrison was continuously diluted from clustering state. Wuzhou Integrated Squadron, most combat capable in Wuzhou National Army Battalion, was transferred to North Guangdong to participate in war; another squadron because had to execute West River patrol, was in state of leaving early returning late. Because of war loss, continuously drawing people to supplement, Replacement Squadron originally garrisoning Yangming Gate was already consumed invisibly exhaustedly. Wuzhou permanent defenders actually only left Qian Duo’s company and a squadron at Sanheui.

Even so, Yi Haoran still couldn't make up determination: although during day defenders in city only had one infantry company, but this company had best equipment, strongest combat power. As long as Qian Duo’s company was still in city, he would always hesitate to pelt rat for fear of smashing vase.

However this time huge grain transfer gave him a chance. Without doubt, transfer of ten thousand *dan* grain was definitely a big matter for Wuzhou Hair thieves up and down. If could attack grain boats seizing opportunity, inevitably could cause huge shock; not only could play role of tuning tiger leaving mountain, also could severely dampen Hair thieves' morale.

Because Yi Haoran often went to dock helping Wen Iron Head calculate accounts—he this porter head now loading and unloading goods for Australians, subordinates already expanded to several hundred people, acting exactly like local biggest porter head; just relying on past management mode of distributing bamboo chips already couldn't attend to it; plus Australians were particular about document management, everything had proof, Wen Iron Head this illiterate naturally couldn't handle, so often asked Yi Haoran.

Yi Haoran naturally didn't decline; one, this way could let him go out with right title and smooth words; two, calculating accounts at dock could observe many details of Australian shipping.

He roughly knew, Australians liked large formation transport, organizing large scale boat fleet to transport large amount of materials at one time; every time transporting would send many "Steam Launches" to escort; not only guns and cannons sharp, boats also had soldiers accompanying. Whether setting ambush on shore or intercepting on water was very hard to oppose; at most just harassing boat fleet a bit.

Every time large scale boat fleet arrived port unloading, Qian Duo would deploy troops to vicinity of dock to carry out alert; had to wait until goods all unloaded entering warehouse then would withdraw.

This time Australians were very likely also loading ten thousand *dan* grain to Wuzhou at one time; scale would exceed any boat fleet of past. Naturally would also dispatch more men and horses to alert—defense inside city inevitably empty.

He planned to use Gou Er’s men and horses to feign attack on boat fleet outside city, attracting attention of alert troops outside city; Song Ming’s men raid Prefecture Yamen, devising to capture or kill True Hair.

"Is this workable?" Chang Qingyun was somewhat doubtful, "General Song has only fifty men under hand; entering city raiding Prefecture Yamen still has thirty percent possibility; but Gou Er’s men and horses although having hundred and ten people, are all disciples of crowing cock and stealing dog; how can bear this heavy responsibility?"

"Method always exists."

Chang Qingyun seeing him equivocating, knew he didn't trust himself completely, couldn't help somewhat discouraged. Said:

"Originally I shouldn't ask."

Yi Haoran said serious face: "Brother Chang, not that I can't trust you! Some things you don't know might be better. In short our hearts are together, force used in one place is fine!"

"You speak reasonably," Chang Qingyun nodded, "Want me to do what?"

"Your thing, still at Sanheui." Yi Haoran said, "Sanheui has a National Army squadron, must create some big matters, dragging this squadron is fine."

"This matter speaking easy, doing however hard." Chang Qingyun frowned saying, "Although in camp are all captives, but right now worry not eating and wearing, also no worry of life; wanting to call them turn over is impossible to do."

"Why need them to turn over? As long as camp chaotic is fine!" Yi Haoran said gloomily.

To protect chaos, easiest way was nothing more than arson. Summer heaven dry things dry; camp also mostly grass wood structure temporary building; once fire started inevitably would cause large scale spreading.

"Australians prevent fire very tight in camp; this matter afraid not easy."

"If easy, still need Master Chang you to preside over big situation?" Yi Haoran said, "In camp we also have several brothers; at that time all can help you a bicep force!"

Chang Qingyun knew accepting this task was nine deaths one life. Not to say once Australians caught him inevitably no life road; even on spot not caught, after fire started camp lacked order, thousands of people rushing like wolf rushing like boar, trampling each other; wanting to escape a life out from inside was even not easy.

He said generously: "Since so, Student just risks a life to do is fine!"

Yi Haoran praised: "Mr. Chang indeed forget body for country!" He turned head looking at broad river surface, excited said: "Sir rest assured, Student is also not person cherishing body; at that time you and I walking together on Yellow Spring Road, won't be lonely." Finished speaking laughed loudly.

Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly: "Sir good heroic spirit!"

Yi Haoran shook head said: "Not I have heroic spirit, really is I can't bear seeing this great good rivers and mountains fall into barbarian hands anymore! Although time luck heaven mandate, Great Ming now has nothing. Just speaking before eyes: Australians already deep into Guangxi; probably not using long, Bagui Great Earth all want to surname Hair. Even if can accept this Xie Hair beheaded, to Two Guangs dangerous situation is just cup of water cart of firewood, just mantis arm stopping cart, ant shaking tree—even so, I also unwilling to let Hair thief look down on Huaxia scholars!"

After Chang Qingyun left, Yi Haoran plotted alone for long time, only feeling this matter however plotted only had thirty forty percent assurance, yet needing quite a few people to send death—dying all were Court's loyal and chaste scholars...

If directly let Cai Lan go assassinate? Whether poisoning or assassination, to Cai Lan all weren't hard things. Although she must die without doubt, but she was person should have died early, also nothing pitiable.

However he pondered again and again, decided not to risk this; one, Cai Lan could act as last killer mace; two, he through Qiuchan, roughly knew this little woman already had some subtle emotion with Xie Erren. If forcing her to move hand, messing up would sell himself.

Cai Lan listened to Jiang Qiuchan’s entrustment, knew matter wasn't this simple. Qiuchan didn't know what Yi Haoran plotted; she knew clearly one clear two.

Heart secretly anxious, but again had no method. Thinking come thinking go, only could secretly pay attention to official documents and letters Xie Erren dealt with daily.

Originally Xie Erren didn't bring work to her lodging; however following favoring her day more than day, this Senator to avoid running morning and evening often worked here; also specially tidied out East Wing Room as specialized office.

Cai Lan usually very careful: never showed any interest in office; when Xie Erren working in office, she even tea and stewed tonics only delivered to door.

But Xie Erren didn't have that much suspicion as she imagined. Not only rarely locked door when leaving, also would bring documents to bedroom to read, or simply reviewed official documents on bed, drafting on notebook. Sometimes these things would be left in bedroom.

During day Xie Erren often had to go out; most time was meeting or working in Prefecture Yamen; inside yard besides her and Qiuchan only had two servant women—these two servant women wouldn't enter room without greeting. So Cai Lan wanting to peek official documents letters wasn't hard matter.

Right on second night after Luo Yangming reported his suspicion on Hao Ran, she saw that External Check Letter drafted by Zhao Fengtian in office—just placed in document basket waiting for Xie Erren to sign then send out.

Seeing "Hao Ran" two characters, Cai Lan immediately pulled document out reading.

Although she didn't understand what was External Check, Australians' documents were simple white easy to understand; three words two sentences then understood: was Wuzhou here writing letter to Teng County’s Australian yamen asking if locally had such person Hao Ran, specifically what situation again.

Teng County naturally impossible to have this person Hao Ran; even if Qiuchan immediately wrote a letter home, asking husband family to help cover lie; leave aside whether her husband family willing or not to cover lie for a man of unknown origin; even willing, Australians adding slight interrogation would also expose horse foot.

Once exposed, consequence need not ask known. Yi Haoran immediately would expose identity, arrested and interrogated. What he plotted in Wuzhou was very big; taking down would be a big case; not only herself would be implicated, Jiang family also couldn't run away...

She pondered for moment, then made a risky decision; pulled this official letter out from document basket, took directly to main room, quietly lit on candle burning away.

Luo Yangming naturally didn't know External Check Letter just disappeared without shadow without trace. His work was very busy. Since discussing good specific fundraising plan with Prefect Xie, he through Aftermath Bureau revealed "Fundraising" intention out. Sure enough, immediately attracted interest of quite a few big merchants. Many people asked him details of this matter, but people truly willing to join weren't too many. Luo Yangming wasn't surprised at this: in military chaos horse confusion time merchants were more willing to pinch silver in hand watching, instead of releasing out to earn money. Moreover recent war situation tense; bandit armed forces once even moved to Wuzhou suburbs; news of Yao Chaos also transmitted continuously. Following worsening of situation, all kinds of rumors also appeared, "Australian not True Dragon Son of Heaven, can't sit Dragon Court" "Yao people all don't recognize Australian as Emperor"... news like these spread full city. Zheng Ergen leading police caught some people spreading rumors, but couldn't interrogate out anything; all were people transmitting people, heard from street.

Such various kinds, making originally high position "Australian Stock" start to fall; many people originally wanting to place bet and add bet changed mind.

Fortunately merchants willing to risk were still not few; Jiang Qiuchan’s brother Jiang Rongxian first expressed attitude willing to fund, driving several Silk Guild peers; Shopkeeper Da Xinxuan of Chengyu Firm also entered share of several hundred taels silver. Thirteen thousand taels silver needed for purchasing grain were gathered very quickly.
