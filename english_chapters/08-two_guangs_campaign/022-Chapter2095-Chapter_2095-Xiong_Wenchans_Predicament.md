# Chapter 2095 - Xiong Wenchan's Predicament

"The largest vessel remained at Zhaoqing and did not proceed upriver," the courier reported. "The two paddlewheel steamships are moored outside Fengchuan."

Xiong Wenchan waved dismissal. He ordered his servants to summon his staff, then settled into his armchair and closed his eyes to rest. That the pirates had pursued so quickly didn't surprise him—dawdling wasn't the Australian style. They acted with lightning speed in everything. Now with momentum behind them, naturally they wouldn't linger en route. They'd sail straight up the river and strike Wuzhou!

Anyone with even basic knowledge of the Two Guangs' geography and military arrangements understood that Wuzhou was the linchpin between Guangdong and Guangxi. It was the key position the Australians must seize—and therefore the place he must defend.

If this city fell, not only would Guangxi's gateway be thrown open, but any future court counteroffensive into Guangdong would become as difficult as ascending to heaven! The Emperor would never forgive him then! Xiong Wenchan knew well that His Majesty had a foul temper and frequently executed high officials. Beyond hanging himself and dying with the city, he had no other options.

At this thought, Xiong Wenchan broke into a cold sweat. He had little time left—he must devise a plan quickly!

Since the pirates had taken Guangzhou, he'd sent agents to the capital. Lavish spending of gold and silver on court grandees served two purposes: first, to buy himself time—ideally, a transfer out; second, to gauge the court's attitude toward the pirates—whether his "conciliation" strategy faced obstacles.

This had already cost him enormous sums—not that he was unattached to money. In his time as Fujian Governor, he'd accepted massive bribes from Zheng Zhilong. But compared to his official cap and his life, money meant nothing. Keep the cap, and gold and silver would naturally flow in again.

Xiong Wenchan didn't want to fight and wasn't good at fighting. As Fujian Governor, he'd pacified Zheng Zhilong. Later, as Governor-General of the Two Guangs, the court had also expected him to pacify Liu Xiang and those pirates based at Lingao. The court had cast Xiong Wenchan as the capable minister who could pacify the Fujian-Guangdong coastal waters—but this mission far exceeded his abilities.

The likes of Zheng Zhilong and Liu Xiang, even the Portuguese—these sea raiders who dominated the Fujian-Guangdong waters were, for the Ming, merely skin ailments. This judgment wasn't entirely wrong, because what these factions sought was only "wealth." But the Australians—like the Jurchens—had proclaimed their own dynasty name, making them an "enemy state."

Conciliation had always been premised on strength. Xiong Wenchan had pacified Zheng Zhilong by leveraging all of Fujian's fiscal resources. Though Zheng Zhilong ruled the seas of Fujian and Guangdong, he lacked the strength to conquer all of Fujian Province. Accepting pacification had been his wisest choice. Thus Zheng became Xiong's chess piece, his enforcer. Xiong was happy to supply and bolster this enforcer.

He had managed to win over Zheng Zhilong, but he couldn't win over the Australians. The Australians weren't Central Plains natives—they had neither hometown sentiments nor local ties; he couldn't court them through feelings of native place. As for wealth, they were already rich as nations; even the Two Guangs' finances couldn't match them. As for allowing them to occupy territory—their appetites were far greater than Zheng Zhilong's, who'd been satisfied with Zhangzhou Bay.

What price could he, Xiong Wenchan, offer to make these Australians accept pacification peacefully?

The only thing that could bring the pirates to the negotiating table was a victory.

But such a victory was easier said than done! He was perfectly clear: whether in open battle or defending a fortress, government forces were no match for the pirates. Even with his current superiority in numbers, he had few chances of winning.

Some of his staff and officers held optimistic views—believing Wuzhou's walls were strong, provisions were ample, and the garrison of over ten thousand, backed by all of Guangxi for supplies, could hold out a year or more as long as court funding arrived on time. Others adamantly opposed defending the city: Guangzhou too had been "strongly fortified with many troops" plus numerous gun batteries along the river below Humen for layered interception—yet in the end, they'd failed to stop the pirates, who'd reached the city walls. Their proposal was to abandon Wuzhou immediately and retreat to Guilin.

Neither argument seemed reliable to him.

"Master, the gentlemen have arrived..." his attendant whispered. "They await your pleasure."

Xiong Wenchan opened his eyes: "Show them in!"

His staff was large, but this was a council of war—sycophants and flatterers weren't invited. Only those with strategic and military ability came.

As the staff entered the hall, they prepared to bow. Xiong Wenchan coughed and waved:

"With the war situation so perilous, we can dispense with formalities. Be seated—let's get to business."

"Yes, sir."

The staff took seats on both sides in order of precedence. Xiong Wenchan summarized the recent courier reports and said:

"I expect the pirates will attack Wuzhou within a few days. Do any of you gentlemen have countermeasures?"

The staff glanced at each other, murmuring but saying nothing. Xiong Wenchan had seen this scene too many times. Even if they did offer advice, there'd be nothing new: his advisors either suffered from "Australia-phobia"—paling at the mere mention of Australians—or only knew how to flatter, offering nothing constructive. His ears were filled with two types of voices: "We can't beat the Australians, Your Excellency—let's flee!" and "Your Excellency's genius will surely crush the Australians beneath Wuzhou's walls."

Only Chang Qingyun was somewhat reliable. At least he could clearly explain how formidable the Australians were and offer some sensible strategies. Xiong Wenchan had wanted to hold Zhaoqing, but Chang had bluntly stated Zhaoqing couldn't be defended—though at Antelope Gorge there might be a chance to destroy the Australian fleet with fire-ships. Moreover, he had early on advised Xiong to transfer the Eastern and Western Mountain Anti-Yao Garrison Commanders to Wuzhou. This had at least given him a substantial, combat-capable core force at Wuzhou.

So he turned his gaze to Chang Qingyun's face.

Chang seemed to have anticipated this. He waited a moment; seeing no one else offer a plan, he cupped his hands and said: "Your Excellency, I have someone to recommend—he has a strategy to defeat the pirates."

"Oh?" Xiong Wenchan's spirits lifted; the other staff were startled too. "Who is this? Bring him to me at once."

"This gentleman is surnamed Chang, given name Pu, courtesy name Junbin—a man of South-Zhili. He is distantly my kinsman. He was formerly the magistrate of Enping County. After the city fell, he fled here. He has a stratagem to break the pirates and wishes to present it to Your Excellency."

Xiong Wenchan knew the name Chang Pu—Enping being a county under Zhaoqing's jurisdiction—but wasn't familiar with him. In the Ming, governors-general typically handled only military affairs; a county magistrate was under the Provincial Administration Commissioner's jurisdiction, having little to do with him.

This man had been a county magistrate, had lost his city, yet had neither died fighting nor committed suicide—and now he came offering strategies? Xiong Wenchan secretly sneered.

Still, scorn aside, he was now desperate enough to try anything. Besides, hearing what County Magistrate Chang had to say cost nothing. He readily agreed: "Very well! Send for him at once!"

That afternoon, news that the Fubo Army was about to reach the city walls spread throughout Wuzhou. The entire city was on edge. Ming soldiers stationed there had long heard of the Fubo Army's prowess and dreaded the imminent battle. Wuzhou's civilians, though they'd heard the Fubo Army maintained strict discipline, knew that warfare inevitably brought collateral suffering. As for the officials, they lived in constant terror.

Outside Wuzhou's outer residential district stood a grain warehouse dealing in the transshipment of Guangxi rice to Guangdong. Seated in the counting house was the warehouse's manager, named Luo Yangming. A native of Sanshui, he had come to Wuzhou a few years ago to run the grain business—a common practice in these parts. After a few years of trade, business flourished. He'd made money, built a warehouse and residence, brought his family from Sanshui, taken a local concubine—in essence, settled here.

Everyone knew him as a grain merchant. In truth, Luo Yangming was an intelligence operative of the External Intelligence Bureau, under the "Mountain and Sea Routes" intelligence system, ordered to go underground in Wuzhou.

His work had two objectives: first, managing the grain trade and transshipping grain to Lingao; second, gathering local intelligence and developing networks in preparation for the Council's Northern Expedition.

The first task posed no difficulty. He was a merchant's son; his family had run a rice shop in Sanshui. He was thoroughly familiar with the grain trade—had many connections—and found it easy to get started. The second task wasn't hard either. Medieval societies had weak counterintelligence awareness and even weaker techniques. For someone trained in intelligence work, whether going underground or conducting reconnaissance, neither was difficult.
