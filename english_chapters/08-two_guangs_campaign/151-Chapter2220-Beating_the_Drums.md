# Chapter 2220 - Beating the Drums

When Huang Chao received Wang Chuyi's letter, something about it troubled him. But stretched thin as he was and unfamiliar with conditions in Yangshan, he could not properly assess the situation. Though he had reservations about Wang Chuyi's approach, having entrusted the county to him, it was only right to let the man gain experience—the Elders could not micromanage everything. After analyzing the contents of the report, he concluded that Wang Chuyi's plan carried limited risk; at worst, there might be a minor setback—nothing that would throw the entire county into chaos.

He immediately wrote back approving the plan but cautioned Wang Chuyi: "Exercise extra vigilance. Do not be too lenient with such bandit-strongman groups. Avoid excessive magnanimity. Do not extend mercy to bandit-strongmen who have incurred great popular resentment."

The letter ran several thousand characters. He wrote until the small hours, covering every point and concern he could think of, lest Wang Chuyi overlook something.

After finishing, he handed the letter to the signals clerk for encoding and dispatched a courier to deliver it. Meanwhile, he summoned Zhen Huan.

"Take your entire company and set out immediately. Arrive in Yangshan before the twenty-eighth of the seventh month, ready for combat that day," Huang Chao said. "Once there, you are under County Magistrate Wang Chuyi's command."

Zhen Huan nodded. "Understood. I'll make arrangements and depart at first light tomorrow."

With the reinforcements settled, Huang Chao felt somewhat reassured. As long as Zhen Huan arrived with the Mountain Company in time, any mess Wang Chuyi made could be salvaged.

News that County Magistrate Wang would personally attend Sun Dabiao's "Golden Basin Hand-Washing" assembly at Dalang Market spread quickly. Sun Dabiao told everyone he met, so delighted his beard quivered with each retelling.

"At last I have an official status. I'll spend the rest of my days living peacefully under Australian rule."

He sent people to the county seat to buy an old residence, demolished it entirely, and began building a grand new mansion. He dispatched agents throughout the countryside to purchase good farmland. Every day, porters streamed out of Dalang Market carrying household goods to the county seat. He was clearly preparing a comfortable nest there.

All of Dalang Market was in a bustle. Not only were belongings being moved out of his residence, but several shops under his name had closed—managers and clerks dismissed. He retained only the largest, calling it his "retirement nest egg." Greenwood heroes who had been lying low now emerged to offer congratulations and host banquets. Everyone knew: Sun Dabiao was washing his hands, handing over Dalang Market, and becoming a rich gentleman.

Meanwhile, Wang Chuyi secretly deployed his forces while sending orders to the Yonghua Yao territories: fifty able-bodied men were to report immediately to the county seat to reinforce the Provisional First Squadron.

Scouts dispatched to Qinglian Market kept close watch on the situation. Apart from drilling his troops, Feng Haijiao showed no unusual activity—indicating no collusion with Sun Dabiao. Still, Wang Chuyi remained uneasy. The moment Zhen Huan's Mountain Company arrived, he sent them straight to the outskirts of Qinglian Market—to keep an eye on Feng Haijiao and prevent any sudden sally, and to be ready to attack once Sun Dabiao's reorganization was complete.

In the midst of these feverish preparations, word came: Pan Tianshun, the Eternal Chief of Sankengling in Yonghua, had arrived with the reinforcement troops.

"Show him in," Wang Chuyi said.

Pan Tianshun entered the hall and was about to kneel when Wang Chuyi stopped him. "No need to kneel. Sit down and talk."

"Your Honor! Please save the people of Yonghua!" Ignoring pleasantries, Pan Tianshun threw himself to the floor with a heavy thud and kowtowed three times in rapid succession.

Wang Chuyi was startled. He hastened to help him up. "Eternal Chief—what is this about?"

Pan Tianshun was one of the more "loyal" Eternal Chiefs in the Yonghua Yao territory—he had never wanted open conflict with the government. His participation in the Eight Pai Yao uprising had been purely because years of exploitation by Sun Dabiao had inflamed popular fury beyond containment.

Though the Australians had pardoned the rebellion, they had not eliminated the devil Sun Dabiao. Worse, the very man who had been driven out by the Yao was now back at Dalang Market, openly running his "business." The Yonghua Yao folk still suffered under his extortion.

This had long since brought popular resentment in Yonghua to a boil. The younger men wanted to march out and finish Sun Dabiao for good. But the Eternal Chiefs and elders had suppressed that tide: they had already fought the Australians once—and been utterly outmatched. Had Elder Huang not shown mercy, the able-bodied men of Yonghua's villages would have been decimated. Besides, an Australian squadron was now stationed in Yonghua. Before the villages could even muster, the Australians would crush them.

Yet the resentment continued to swell—especially after word spread that the Australians intended to pacify Sun Dabiao and give him an official post. Even "moderate" figures like Pan Tianshun found it intolerable. Later, when the Australians opened a salt shop in Yonghua and sold salt at fair prices, some of the anger subsided—but the Yao territory was seething with hidden currents that could explode at any moment.

Pan Tianshun had been worried sick. He knew that if Yonghua rose again, the momentary satisfaction would be followed by brutal Australian retaliation—and the Australians' fighting power far surpassed Ming's soldiers. One misstep, and the Yonghua Yao would be doomed forever.

Tormented by these anxieties, Pan Tianshun had several times prepared generous gifts to present to Wang Chuyi—but each time, disagreement among the villages had prevented him from going. Now, with Wang Chuyi suddenly demanding reinforcement troops, Pan Tianshun saw his chance. He personally led fifty warriors, determined to unburden himself to this "Elder."

"Though Yonghua's people were briefly misguided and followed the Eight Pai Yao in rebellion—it was only out of desperation!" Pan Tianshun refused to rise. "Sun Dabiao left us no way to live... Your Honor, every day you hang slogans and sing songs, saying the Australians' coming is like sunshine in winter—but that sunshine never reaches us in Yonghua..." His voice cracked, and he began to weep.

He grew more agitated as he spoke, pouring out his grievances between sobs. "Everyone has no salt... A tiny bit of salt costs a fortune in trade goods, but without salt, we can barely walk... Children have no salt to eat, neither do the old... People go to graveyards to dig up nitre salt to eat... Many have died from it..."

Wang Chuyi felt embarrassed. He had learned of these things from the Yonghua squadron commander's reports. But in his view, subduing the Three Tyrants of Yangshan in one blow was the priority—a once-and-for-all solution. The people could endure some hardship in the meantime. He had not expected the Eternal Chief's reaction to be so intense.

"Since the Wanli era, when we Yonghua folk accepted County Magistrate Zhao's pacification and became subjects of the court, we have always been obedient to the government, never daring to cross the line. Whatever the officials demanded—public or private—as long as we could provide it, we gave our utmost. Now Ming's officials are gone, and you Australians have come to be emperor—we dare not be anything but loyal. Only, if things go on like this, we'll have no way to live..."

These words weighed heavily on Wang Chuyi. He too had come from poverty; he knew the wretched plight of honest, humble folk who endured abuse with nowhere to turn for justice. He quickly helped Pan Tianshun to his feet. "Say no more—I know all this. You'll have to bear it just a little longer. The skies will clear in a matter of days."

"Does Your Honor mean Sun Dabiao's 'Golden Basin Hand-Washing'?" Seeing the magistrate's warmth, Pan Tianshun wiped his tears and rose.

"Exactly. After this Reorganization Assembly, he will leave Dalang Market, and our troops will take over. Buying salt and selling mountain goods will no longer be difficult for you."

"Thank you, Your Honor." Pan Tianshun dried his eyes but could not help adding, "Though Sun Dabiao is leaving, now he has an official title and a squadron under his command—he's become a soldier... I fear there will be more trouble later..."

He explained that Sun Dabiao, though he had nominally transferred his shops, keeping only one general store, had actually arranged for relatives and cronies to take them over. In reality, he still controlled them. His men were openly boasting that in three to five years, they would return.

"Please don't think me presumptuous, Your Honor. You'll be here two or three years at the shortest, four or five at the longest, before you're promoted elsewhere. When a new magistrate comes who doesn't know the old affairs, and Sun Dabiao is a deeply rooted local snake—won't Dalang Market still be his domain...?"

Wang Chuyi nodded. "You speak truly. But rest assured: the Three Tyrants of Yangshan will all eventually pay for the blood they owe. So don't worry—the Council of Elders has its own plans."

He did not elaborate further. "The men you've brought will be incorporated into the Provisional First Squadron. That squadron is composed mainly of you Yonghua Yao; I trust your attitude toward Sun Dabiao is not in question. I need you to keep a tight watch on Sun Dabiao's men. Understood?"

The implication was clear enough. Pan Tianshun's spirits rose. "When it comes to dealing with Sun Dabiao, every one of us Yonghua folk can fight like ten!"

"Don't boast. Besides, I'm not asking you to attack them. Just keep your eyes on his men." Wang Chuyi paused. "Squadron Commander You will assign the specific tasks. This time, don't go back—you carry authority; stay with the squadron as its backbone. At the critical moment, I'll be counting on you."

"Yes, I understand!" Pan Tianshun stood invigorated.

Wang Chuyi issued a chit instructing the warehouse to select serviceable Ming-era swords, spears, armor, and firearms and distribute a portion to the Provisional First Squadron. He also ordered preparations for wine and meat to celebrate the Reorganization Assembly, along with five hundred silver dollars for military pay.
