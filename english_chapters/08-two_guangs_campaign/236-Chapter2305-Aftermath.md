# Chapter 2305 - Aftermath

"We are the main cadres in Wuzhou currently; let's not sigh and groan first." Seeing them all lapsing into the slackness that follows extreme tension, Zhao Fengtian reminded them, "There are many things to do now. We have to hurry and get started. Don't forget the grain fleet is arriving tomorrow..." He checked his pocket watch. "It's already 4:00 AM. There's not much time. Let's discuss, split up, and get the aftermath work done as soon as possible."

"The aftermath work is nothing, and transporting grain isn't critical," Zhu Si frowned. "The problem is, how do we report to our superiors?"

This question touched the core of the problem. Whatever happened, such a big incident in Wuzhou could not be hidden. After all, a Senator being captured was unprecedented. The higher-ups would inevitably take action. Zhao Fengtian knew that Elder Xie could no longer hold the position of Wuzhou Director; he would likely be "transferred back to Lingao for another appointment" or simply sent for "vacation-style recuperation."

They were all senior naturalized cadres and knew that even if a Senator made a sky-high mistake, they would only be stripped of authority and placed in idle retirement. But they wouldn't be so lucky.

Qian Duo, Zhao Fengtian, and Zhu Si all bore responsibility in this matter, but there was room regarding the magnitude of that responsibility. Comparatively, Qian Duo was a Volte Army officer. The army always protected its own, and frontline warfare was tight. If he were transferred to the front line, even a sky-high matter would turn into nothing. But for local military and political cadres like Zhao Fengtian and Zhu Si, escaping wouldn't be so easy.

Zhao Fengtian pondered for a moment and said, "This matter is of grave importance. Chief Xie hasn't fully regained consciousness yet. Some things still need his decision. We don't need to be too anxious right now. Do the work at hand well, and wait for him to wake up before discussing—he is still the highest administrative chief of Wuzhou. The big ideas must come from him. It's not appropriate for us to make decisions first."

Everyone agreed. They divided the labor on the spot. Qian Duo readjusted the city's defenses and immediately sent men to Sanhezu to understand the specific damages. Zhu Si was responsible for organizing the battlefield cleanup and continuing to purge any possible remnant enemies in the city.

After they dispersed, Zhao Fengtian ordered Luo Yangming to be invited into the office.

"Thanks to you this time!" Zhao Fengtian held his hand, not knowing what to say for a good while. "Sit, sit!"

"I was lucky," Luo Yangming didn't stand on ceremony, plonking himself into a chair and smiling bitterly. "I gambled right."

"In the end, you were prepared, and we were unprepared. We were paralyzingly careless," Zhao Fengtian said. "What do we do now?"

These words carried heavy weight, but it was natural for Zhao Fengtian to ask. If there was one beneficiary in this matter, it was Luo Yangming.

Luo Yangming was a Hidden Cadre. Aside from reporting situations, he was not responsible for any specific decision-making work. Now, with the merit of bravely rescuing a Senator, he sat securely on the fishing platform (was in an unassailable position).

After the event, the Senate would inevitably send an investigation team down to inquire. Luo Yangming's report would be the most critical. When dealing with follow-up issues, they naturally had to value his opinion. Zhao Fengtian mentally calculated his work interactions and conversations with Luo Yangming and felt there were generally no problems.

Luo Yangming was certainly not stupid and understood the meaning in Zhao Fengtian's words. He thought for a moment and said, "This matter should still take Chief Xie's intention as the standard..."

Zhao Fengtian sighed, "I'm just worried about Chief Xie's attitude."

The Liangguang campaign had been advancing triumphantly, with reports of victory everywhere. Although there was Yao unrest in Northern Guangdong and bandit disturbances everywhere, the overall situation was booming. No major blunders had occurred. Wuzhou had genuinely produced a massive scandal this time. Once reported, Elder Xie's time in Wuzhou was done, needless to say; he would surely have to step down and go home. In the future, within the Senate, he would likely be a marginalized character. With Zhao Fengtian's experience, Elder Xie's first reaction upon waking would surely be to try his best to conceal this failure.

If Xie Erren wanted to conceal it, the worst consequence would be getting sidelined after exposure—the same result as confessing frankly. So nine out of ten times, Elder Xie would do this.

But as subordinates, they would be very passive. Chief Xie would definitely require them to cooperate in concealing the truth. But once exposed, the consequences would be unimaginable. The best result would be a transfer to Jeju Island or Taiwan Island. That was a completely different matter from being a cadre in Guangdong.

If they opposed him directly, even if Xie Erren was sidelined and became an idle Senator, it would still be effortlessly easy for him to deal with a few naturalized cadres.

Furthermore, if they concealed it, Luo Yangming's great merit would go down the drain. How could he let the matter rest? He was a vertically managed cadre; a single official document could be sent directly to Lingao.

Luo Yangming had mixed in the business world for many years and done underground work for a long time; he was best at understanding the meaning within words. Zhao Fengtian's worry was not unreasonable. As Xie Erren's direct subordinates, they were indeed in a tough spot.

He thought for a moment and said, "Presumably, the Chief won't be that muddled. The commotion was so big; I'm afraid more than just a few of us know..."

Zhao Fengtian nodded. "I thought of that too. It's just that when the time comes, the Chief's will—"

"We naturally must explain the situation fully to the Chief," Luo Yangming said. "Presumably, the Chief understands the key points within."

"That is the only way." Zhao Fengtian thought. Luo Yangming was right; trying their best to persuade Elder Xie not to conceal it was the best policy.

"...Right now, we should clarify the case as soon as possible, especially the backgrounds of that Hao Ran, as well as Cai Lan and Jiang Qiuchan. We also caught some captives in the city; interrogate them all together. Try to make the matter clear so we have something to say when reporting," Luo Yangming reminded.

"I'll instruct Zheng Ergen to handle this immediately. Even if they are made of iron, we'll pry open their mouths!" Zhao Fengtian said murderously.

Luo Yangming originally wanted to remind him "don't kill them, or it will be hard to explain," but on second thought, he swallowed the words back. He said, "There is one thing I need your help with."

"Speak."

"This time, the dock foreman Wen Tietou and his men exerted great effort. There were quite a few casualties. They aren't naturalized citizens; in the end, they did it for money. The pensions and rewards cannot be scrimped, otherwise, it's easy to chill people's hearts..."

"I can make the decision on this," Zhao Fengtian said. "But you must be responsible for telling them to keep it secret."

"Rest assured, I only told them we were saving a generic high official, not a Chief—anyway, they don't recognize Elder Xie."

"Draft an application for how much money is needed and how to distribute it. bring it over, and I'll arrange it immediately." Zhao Fengtian smiled bitterly. "Another huge expense!"

Xie Erren "woke up" when the sky was thoroughly light. Actually, he had woken up on the stretcher, but he really didn't have the face to sit up immediately and say he was "fine."

A naturalized doctor examined his body; aside from some flesh wounds, there were no major issues. But he still feigned grogginess and lay there until dawn before barely opening his eyes.

Seeing he had "woken up," the orderly watching over him immediately went out to notify others. Before long, Zhao Fengtian arrived.

"Chief!" Zhao Fengtian came over and held his hand tightly. "Are you alright!"

"I'm fine, I'm fine, just my head is still dizzy." Xie Erren touched his head—there was indeed a lump there. He didn't know what had hit him, but it was now bandaged with gauze. He feigned calm. "A small injury. How is the situation in the city?"

"The enemies who infiltrated have been wiped out by us. We also caught quite a few captives and are interrogating them together. Everything is normal in the city; no main cadres were casualties."

"What about Sanhezu?"

"The enemy failed to capture it and has fled. Qian Duo sent men to check the specific situation."

"That's good."

After saying this, the two fell into an awkward silence. Although they tacitly avoided mentioning Xie Erren's capture, both understood that there had to be an explanation for this matter.

After a long while, Zhao Fengtian whispered, "Chief, how do you think we should report this to the superiors?"

Xie Erren smiled bitterly. "How to report? Naturally, report it as it is! You guys can't shoulder this responsibility."

"Chief..."

Now that the topic was broached, Xie Erren stopped being secretive and vented, "Don't I know the nature of the Senate? Besides Luo Yangming, I'm afraid there's more than one plant placed in this Wuzhou City! Right now, they are probably busy writing reports under the lamp! Hmph, pervasive! They just don't know how to guard against Ming spies!"

Zhao Fengtian hurriedly said, "Chief! Chief!" He originally wanted to tell him "don't talk nonsense," but the other party was a Senator; how could he tell him "don't talk nonsense"? But spewing anger at the Senate like this all the way... if he spat out some Senate secrets, he would be fine, but would Zhao himself survive hearing them?

However, Xie Erren's lack of intent to conceal gave him a huge sigh of relief. once Xie Erren's tone calmed down a bit, Zhao Fengtian said, "Chief, the enemy was merely a small force infiltrating the city for harassment. Although the commotion wasn't small, it didn't cause any serious consequences. Moreover, it exposed the enemy's lurking organization in the city, removing hidden worries for Wuzhou. The gains outweigh the losses."

Xie Erren was a reporter originally; how could he not understand the meaning in Zhao Fengtian's words. His heart was clear as a mirror: the routine of covering up failure and shifting blame probably wouldn't work this time—too many people knew. It wasn't easy to muddy the waters completely. He could only make the matter of his capture look a bit "better."

He suddenly thought of Cai Lan, and a surge of hatred welled up in his heart. He asked, "Have the relevant suspects been arrested?"

"They have all been arrested." Zhao Fengtian saw the fierce light in his eyes and knew his thoughts. "Interrogation is underway. I will report to you after we investigate thoroughly to the bottom."

Xie Erren nodded silently and asked again:

"Who chased them to the city wall?"

"It was Luo Yangming, leading the dock porters."

"I didn't expect this Hidden Cadre to have such a move. Truly a talent!" Xie Erren suddenly felt a wave of deep loneliness, feeling that he had lost interest in everything between heaven and earth. The painstaking efforts of these days had turned into bubbles in the blink of an eye!
