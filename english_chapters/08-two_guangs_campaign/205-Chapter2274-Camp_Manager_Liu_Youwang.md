# Chapter 2274: Camp Manager Liu Youwang

Yi Haoran couldn't help being astounded. Chang Qingyun shook his head quietly, pressing his voice extremely low, saying: "This is the Sun family. His family old master was originally a Ninth Grade Registrar in the county. Australians fought over; old master hanged himself with a rope. Leaving only a distant nephew, a concubine, and a daughter raised by the legal wife. Australians originally sent them back to hometown; this nephew seeing military chaos, and bringing several female dependents, afraid the road was unsafe, voluntarily stayed here—this was originally not wrong either. Just days long, wolf heart and dog lungs thoughts were born..."

Turns out this nephew was extremely poor in the captive camp. Seeing other families' female dependents selling smiles, quite enjoying it, thoughts arose, so he occupied the uncle's concubine, forcing her to sell smiles.

"...A few days ago the Camp Manager Master here took a fancy to the Sun family Miss. This girl is called 'Qiaoniang', truly born with proper appearance, and knowing books and understanding propriety! Alas no heavenly justice, reduced to captive prisoner aside, taken fancy by the Camp Manager here again. This thief eagerly wishes to climb up the pole; these few days forcing bitterly..."

"Actually such matter!" Yi Haoran was angry now. Seeing Chang Qingyun face full of panic, he realized he lost composure, hurriedly lowered voice saying: "Hair thieves allowing selling smiles is one thing, isn't this forcing good into prostitution?"

"Forcing good into prostitution, so what," Chang Qingyun whispered lonely, "People are knife and chopping block." He looked at the door, suppressing voice to like mosquito sound: "You come in seeing here calm and tranquil, organized; down below dark without sun, matters injuring heaven and harming reason are many..."

"Didn't say Australians manage matters most methodically..."

"Words are not wrong, but that is in Lingao!" Chang Qingyun said, "This is Wuzhou. Stewards of the whole camp only the Camp Manager is an Chen Australian; rest are all local yamen worms, every one a good hand at getting money and making trouble, fawning on above and bullying below. You were also long in yamen shogunate; should know these people's methods."

The two were relatively speechless, only heard next door long and short crying. Yi Haoran felt compassionate in heart, whispered: "Who is the Camp Manager here?"

"Is a Chen Australian coming from Qiongzhou. Called Liu Youwang." Chang Qingyun said, "I seen him entering and exiting wearing National Army clothes, probably a military officer."

"Liu Youwang..." Yi Haoran felt this name somewhat familiar, seemed heard somewhere. Thought for half a day but really couldn't remember.

Just speaking, suddenly sound came from outside: "Master! Master!"

Yi Haoran froze, somewhat nervous. Chang Qingyun gestured him not to panic.

"This is my family servant Chang Qing." Saying so he added a sentence, "He doesn't recognize you."

Yi Haoran remembered; the most useful young servant beside Chang Qingyun was called Chang Wei.

Chang Qingyun got up to go out. Returned in a short while, face somewhat nervous: "Chang Qing said Camp Manager Liu wants me to go over—don't know what matter. You go quickly. If someone asks, hard to fob off."

Yi Haoran was also somewhat nervous. If interrogated by the Camp Manager here, fear it wouldn't be so easy to muddle through. Immediately nodded: "I'll go back right now."

Yi Haoran came out from the captive camp back to the shop, thinking secretly. Felt the harvest of this trip was big. First he understood management in captive camp was not strict, entry and exit very casual; secondly captive camp steward was greedy for cup and fond of sex, this was a shortcoming to utilize. Finally, he knew dissatisfaction existed in the captive camp.

Right now, he still didn't know what use these three points had for him, but these were all Australian soft ribs. Australians' military edge had fully taken Wuzhou now; a battalion originally stationed near Wuzhou had marched to the front. And from news gained through chatting with Iron Head Wen usually and reading Australian "newspapers" he knew: Australians were continuously transferring troops to upper reaches of West River, about to launch action against Guangxi.

Right now Wuzhou Prefecture city was no longer a frontline city; relatively speaking, military force would inevitably be empty. Although there was still a Fubo Army company stationed in Wuzhou now, once the front was tight needing reinforcement, this company would inevitably be transferred to fill gap... Yi Haoran thought, that time would be our chance!

Chang Qingyun was called to Liu Youwang’s residence. He was Camp Manager; residence was the flower hall renovated from past parade ground supply for reviewing Masters.

This "Camp Manager Master" feared by everyone in camp, although a "Chen Australian," actually was just over twenty. His original name was Ergou (Two Dog). Lost father and mother at ten, nowhere to go, could only beg plus petty theft to live in Lingao. Did not expect Australians came, surprisingly luck turned.

Although only fifteen, not yet an adult, was also pulled as able-bodied man to participate in attack on Bopu. When troops fled, small age and weak body, was caught as captive. Later stayed in Nanhai Farm all along. When Huang Chao raised chickens in the farm back then, selected a few people as his apprentices, also called Liu Ergou to be among them. This name Liu Youwang was given by Huang Chao back then—thinking Liu Ergou becoming a naturalized citizen wouldn't need to live like a dog, but obtain a new life full of hope, thus named Youwang (Has Hope).

Liu Youwang was clever and smart, but loved playing petty tricks, disliked reading, full of marketplace air. Age slightly older added a fault of lust. Fifteen sixteen molested female workers, obscenity towards village women, causing storm in the farm, also suffered several beatings, making people hate and dogs dislike. finally really couldn't stay down. So Huang Chao wrote a recommendation letter, getting him to Fubo Army to be a soldier.

Originally thought being a soldier could temper people. Didn't expect Liu Youwang’s old habits didn't change. Being a soldier for several years, most monthly military pay spent on yellow tickets, rank couldn't go up either. After Two Guangs strategy started, old soldiers like Liu Youwang originally could be promoted to officers, but his bad reputation was outside; General Staff Political Department directly deleted him from promotion list, changed to National Army to be officer. Turning around all the way to Wuzhou, coming and going became this Camp Manager post.

If others, taking this errand inevitably would have resentment; after all being Camp Manager in rear couldn't build merit and career. Liu Youwang was like fish in water. Captive camp guards, stewards mostly served by local Wuzhou clerks—back then when he wandered begging, was quite familiar with this kind of people in yamen. Clerks also had heart to hold him up; Liu Youwang fell into it enjoying tirelessly at once.

Captive camp Camp Manager seemed a very humble post, affairs complex again, but benefits inside were many. Token coupons, grain and cloth issued to captives, none couldn't be manipulated up and down. Highest he reached in troops in past was only Sergeant; surroundings were all comrades, officers had absolute authority again. Even having heart couldn't play tricks. Arriving at captive camp had position of "Under Chief Xie one person, above captive camp multitudes"; big and small affairs, life and death almost all decided by his one word.

Such absolute power and the flattery of yamen scoundrels quickly made several years of troop education lose effect. Started just holding back some grain and cloth; later accepted bribes. Captured officials mostly carried valuables, couldn't endure suffering of labor, so bribed with valuables to avoid. Once this head opened, appetite became big. Thinking oneself followed dragon earliest; naturalized citizens joining gang several years later than self all became regional high officials and officers. Self only mixed a National Army officer. In resentment, doing various illegal dealings had not much psychological pressure. Captive camp could be called "Heaven high Emperor far"; he simply "closed door to be Emperor."

Yi Haoran going to captive camp was just a glancing calm over water; Chang Qingyun was familiar with situation very much. Although he received preferential treatment in captive camp, dared not not to try every means to flatter this "Current Manager."

Tidied clothes, Chang Qingyun said: "Student Chang Qingyun, specially come to visit..."

"Oh, is Old Chang, please come in quickly."

Liu Youwang’s voice came from inside.

"Many thanks Officer." Chang Qingyun dared not neglect, walked carefully inside.

Liu Youwang lay slanted on a Xiangfei couch, not wearing National Army uniform nor "Cadre Suit," but imitating local rich people's leisure dressing, wearing a Daoist robe, yet chest open and bosom exposed, barefoot. Matching his short hair, giving people a bizarre feeling.

On the high table beside Xiangfei couch cups and plates were messy. Few plates of side dishes for wine were left little; five or six empty tin pots thrown on ground.

Air filled with smell of wine. Towards Liu Youwang drinking in daylight, Chang Qingyun was long not surprised; only air also filled with a faint smell of rouge and powder—just now probably had woman accompanying by side.

"Camp Manager Liu..."

"Old Chang, you sit!" Liu Youwang had no official airs, waving hand, "Sit, sit!"

"Yes, yes." Chang Qingyun heart apprehensive. He served as clerk in camp, actually chance to see him not much. If not for this sudden painting errand, usually almost couldn't see Liu Youwang.

Although he didn't see Liu Youwang much, he understood this type of people quite well. Rising from humble and poor, wind and cloud meeting grasped power, heart both inferior and violent, quite twisted. Slightly careless would inexplicably "offend dragon scales." He in camp for months, knew quite a few captives in camp because inadvertently angered him, some beaten half dead, some simply "died of sudden illness." Therefore twelve ten thousands of respect and caution.

"Old Chang," Although Liu Youwang drank quite some wine, speech was still clear, "Inviting you this time, is want to ask you to help a favor."

"What words saying Camp Manager Master." Chang Qingyun hurriedly said, "Just need to send someone to order."

"This is big matter, how can be so casual!" Liu Youwang shook head repeatedly, "You are a scholar, must have learning."

"Dare not dare not."

"Don't be polite, heard you are even a *Juren* Master—truly not ambiguous!" Liu Youwang stuck up thumb, "Our county for decades only produced those few *Juren* Masters!"

Chang Qingyun somewhat embarrassed, could only keep being polite.

"Since you are *Juren* Master, with neighbor Registrar Sun family can be counted as equal..."

Chang Qingyun stunned, didn't know what meaning this words had. Had to say: "Student and Registrar Sun never knew each other; don't know what fame he passed exams for, probably at least also a *Juren*."
