# Chapter 2269: "Niece" Visits

Yi Haoran handed the bundle and umbrella to Ah Chun and asked, "Is the Master at home?"

"The Master went to the Rehabilitation Bureau." Ah Chun arranged the things properly, then went to the back to fetch water for him to wash his face. "Did the Sir have a smooth time collecting debts this time out?"

"In chaos and turmoil, the shopkeepers ran to who knows where!" Although Yi Haoran used debt collection as a pretext for going out to roam, he did visit some places to avoid the shop owner's suspicion. "Fortunately, the market has recovered a bit now, and I did collect a little silver money."

"Collecting accounts is a good thing." Ah Chun said as he poured face-washing water. "Sir, go rest in the back. The business on the counter is extremely quiet now; can't wait for one or two customers all day."

Although the rice shop didn't do retail, having fewer customers, in peaceful times, besides bulk wholesale, various rice shops and rice peddlers also had small amounts of wholesale purchases, so there were always people coming in and out of the front. Now there were few visitors.

However, this Luo Yangming paid no attention to his own business; instead, he entered and exited the Rehabilitation Bureau daily to handle miscellaneous duties. Not to mention the boss lady Ah Tao, even Yi Haoran felt it inexplicable—could it be this shopkeeper didn't want to run the rice shop anymore and prepared to curry favor with the Hair thieves to become a fake Australian too?

Yi Haoran returned to the account room, put the collected silver money into the money box, then opened the account book to balance and register the collected accounts. This was just a few strokes. Business was light these days; there were basically no accounts to keep or calculate.

In the past, he would mostly find Li Wensheng or the accountants and shopkeepers of neighboring shops to "kill a few games" of Xiangqi or play a round of "Ma Diao" to kill time.

However, today he had absolutely no interest in this. The excitement brought by the reunion with Jiang Suo had not yet dissipated. He knew from Jiang Suo’s words that there were quite a few officials and soldiers scattered inside and outside Wuzhou city, among whom many had infiltrated the Hair thieves' government offices to work. If these people could be gathered, it would be a force not to be underestimated. They could be put to great use.

How to gather these people? Yi Haoran originally just wanted to win over Chang Qingyun and rely on him to develop a network in the captive camp. But now his ambition was bigger—people in the captive camp were usable, but rushing from Sanheui required crossing the Gui River, and there was the hindrance of Dayun Gate. To coordinate from inside and outside, having people outside the city alone wouldn't work; there must be people inside the city too.

He calculated again and again in his heart, thinking about how to open his mouth when seeing Chang Qingyun, and what means to use to move those scattered officials and soldiers in the city to participate. Suddenly he heard Ah Chun calling outside:

"Mr. Hao! Mr. Hao!"

Yi Haoran hurriedly responded and walked out. He saw Ah Chun standing at the entrance of the small courtyard looking in. Seeing him coming out of the room, he mistakenly welcomed him:

"Mr. Hao! Someone outside is looking for you."

"Oh? What person?" Yi Haoran was a bit strange; he had no relatives or old friends locally, and very few people in Xiong Wencan’s staff knew him.

"It's a woman," Ah Chun gestured, "Says she is your old relative?"

"Relative?" Yi Haoran froze for a moment before remembering it was Jiang Qiuchan. Since Jiang Qiuchan asked someone to introduce him to "Yuxin," they had not met. Yi Haoran prided himself on being an upright gentleman. Jiang Qiuchan was a newly widowed woman. Even with the title of "Cousin Uncle," it was inappropriate for the two to meet. So he had never gone to find her.

Why did she suddenly run to the shop to find him? Yi Haoran was suspicious in his heart, but dared not show it, so he had to say: "I'll go out right away..."

The person coming outside was indeed Jiang Qiuchan. She wore a blue cloth skirt and jacket, saving all makeup and ornaments, only a wooden hairpin and a white flower on her hair bun. A bamboo basket was placed beside her. Seeing him come out, she hurriedly stood up and curtsied deeply.

"Cousin Uncle..."

Yi Haoran hurriedly returned the curtesy, saying politely: "Why did Niece go out alone? It's chaotic and tumultuous outside..." Immediately he greeted, "Come, come, sit inside."

"Thanks for Cousin Uncle's concern. The streets are fairly peaceful now."

The rice shop had a reception room specifically for entertaining customers. Reasonably, female guests were not received, but there was no business right now, so borrowing it temporarily was fine.

Ah Chun served tea and immediately withdrew again. Yi Haoran felt slightly awkward. Looking at this "Cousin Niece," although her complexion was somewhat pale, her spirit was okay.

"Niece came to the shop today, originally to find the Madam..."

The Madam in her mouth was naturally Luo Yangming’s official wife Ding A-tao. Yi Haoran had long heard her say that she had dealings with Ding A-tao before marriage, and relied on this relationship to recommend Yi Haoran here.

However, today Ding A-tao took Wen Yun, accompanied by the old shopkeeper Li Wensheng, to offer incense, and was not in the shop.

"The Madam went out to offer incense."

"Ah Chun told me just now. Since only Cousin Uncle is in the shop, I can only entrust the things to Cousin Uncle." Ding A-tao pointed to the basket on the table, "This is some needlework she asked me to do. It's done now; please ask her not to disdain it."

"Easy to say, easy to say."

Jiang Qiuchan hesitated, seeming to have something to say but unable to open her mouth. After a long while, she whispered

"Niece has a matter, wanting to ask Cousin Uncle to make a decision."

Hearing she wanted to consult him on something, Yi Haoran’s heart settled. He laughed: "We are relatives, no need to be so polite. Just ask."

"Cousin Uncle originally served in Viceroy Xiong's Yamen; do you know a thing or two about the Australians?" Her voice was pressed very low. She knew Yi Haoran’s origin and knew this identity could not be leaked.

Yi Haoran was shocked in his heart, pondering her meaning? Thinking again that they had shared adversity, Qiuchan asking this must have a reason and wouldn't have malicious intent.

He also lowered his voice, saying: "Know a thing or two. Wonder what Niece wants to ask?"

"The matter is like this..."

Jiang Qiuchan’s maiden family opened a silk shop in Wuzhou. Although not a big business, it was a century-old shop. It had dealings with the Yamen usually. This time, retained personnel in the Yamen sent word that the newly arrived Australian Prefect Master Xie wanted to hire a "Companion Woman."

"...It is said this Master Xie took a fancy to a woman surnamed Cai, now kept in his Yamen. Because no one takes care of her, he wants to find a woman of good family origin who is also educated and sensible to accompany and care for her." Qiuchan said, "My maiden family brother heard about it and said he wanted to recommend me for this job."

Her husband had passed away, and she was dragging a son alone with no income. In times of military chaos, she couldn't return to her husband's home in Teng County either. Although she had a maiden family in Wuzhou, she was a married daughter after all. Living in her maiden family inevitably had the embarrassment of living under others' roof, so she wanted to take this job.

However, this was serving beside Australians after all. Whether Qiuchan or her maiden family, they knew very little about Australians. Although retained personnel in the Yamen commented not badly on Australians, they somewhat distrusted the mouths of servants.

Thinking back and forth, she remembered Yi Haoran—since he had fought Australians, he naturally understood Australians a lot. Asking him should be more reliable.

So it was like this! Yi Haoran thought, this was a decent job. It could earn food and clothing for the mother and son. In his dialogue with Jiang Suo, he learned a lot about Australians, knowing that Australians were passable in private morality. They also acted with propriety. Qiuchan doing this job wouldn't have risks.

Suddenly his gaze jumped. Surnamed Cai? He seemed to remember something and hurriedly asked: "Is this woman's maiden name Cai Lan?"

"Exactly." Qiuchan was somewhat puzzled, asking: "What, Cousin Uncle knows her?"

"Can't say I know her," Yi Haoran said, "Her husband and I have met a few times."

Cai Lan was Xing Chenghuan’s wife, and Xing Chenghuan was Wuzhou Prefect Hu Duhua’s correpondence advisor. Because of official business, they had interactions. Once at a banquet hosted by the Viceroy's Office, the two sat adjacent. In casual talk after wine, he learned he had a fiancée named Cai Lan, already brought to Wuzhou preparing for marriage.

"...If I knew Wuzhou would suffer this military disaster, I wouldn't have brought her here no matter what." After saying this, the already flushed Xing Chenghuan sighed heavily.

This matter left a deep impression on him. Because of the war, Xing Chenghuan didn't pay respects and marry Cai Lan, let alone consummate the marriage. It was said to be "afraid of delaying her." At the time Yi Haoran was quite moved, feeling he was an upright gentleman. Later hearing he martyred himself when Wuzhou fell, Yi Haoran respected him even more.

Unexpectedly, the fiancée he left behind was now willing to be a Hair thief's concubine! Thinking of this, Yi Haoran’s face changed slightly. However, he thought again, if Qiuchan could get to this shameless lowly woman's side, it would be equivalent to placing eyes and ears in the Hair thief leader's room.

Thinking of this, Yi Haoran calmed his mind and smiled: "Based on my knowledge: Australian character is passable. Definitely not fierce and stubborn people. You are now orphans and widows, hard to support the household. Doing this job has absolutely no harm."

Jiang Qiuchan looked relieved. It could be seen she really wanted to do this work.

"With Cousin Uncle's words, Niece is at ease."

"Not at all, not at all. Niece serving Australians in the future, maybe Cousin Uncle will have to rely on you." Yi Haoran laughed loudly. Then lowered his voice, "Only Uncle's matter is not enough to tell outsiders..."

"Niece knows." Qiuchan nodded, "There is one more matter Niece wants to trouble Cousin Uncle with, only hard to open mouth..."

"Oh? What matter? We are all family." Yi Haoran was in a very good mood.

"It's Liheng..."

Qi Liheng was her son, six years old this year.

"He has reached the time for starting education..."

Originally as a scholar's son, this matter of starting education could naturally be done by the father. However, now this child had no father. Although there were a few private schools and community schools in the city, she couldn't take out money to pay tuition now. Frankly, she wasn't assured letting a fatherless child go to such places where fish and dragons mixed to study.

"...I know Sir must have excellent learning and is upright. Can I invite Sir to start education and explain books for my dog son..." Qiuchan feared he would find it troublesome, so she hurriedly added, "Tuition, I will pay after I receive wages."
