# Chapter 2145 - Wild Thoughts

This explanation finally restored some measure of confidence to Xie Erren. He immediately ordered the battalion to enter the city and station themselves at various gates and critical locations throughout. Qian Duo's militia squad became redundant and was disbanded on the spot. The original Fubo Army officers and men returned to their units. As for the militiamen, those willing to return home received severance payments;those willing to continue military service were temporarily organized into a supplementary company under the National Army Wuzhou Battalion's command.

Xie Erren inventoried the forces under his command: one regular army company, one National Army battalion plus supplementary company—totaling over five hundred men. Though falling short of "mighty horses and sturdy troops," this represented a dramatic improvement from the initial trembling "naked run" state.

Once his anxieties eased, he remembered the female assassin detained at the Earth God Shrine. He immediately instructed that he would "interrogate" her tonight.

Finding Zhao Fengtian too verbose, he'd switched to a different secretary. Though male, this new secretary demonstrated far superior perceptiveness. Hearing the director's order, a "knowing" lascivious smile immediately appeared on his face, indicating he would definitely "handle the matter properly."

Actually, Xie Erren himself harbored no lecherous intentions for the moment—he felt overwhelmed by responsibilities.

In previous days, he'd trembled constantly over security concerns. Now that a National Army battalion had arrived, with a Fubo Army battalion operating outside the city, though far from "impregnable," conditions no longer constituted "precarious eggshell stacking." Various policies he'd previously contemplated could finally see implementation.

*There truly are quite numerous matters requiring attention...* Xie Erren extracted a notebook from his pocket.

"So opportunities exist for operations in Wuzhou?" Rotten-Eye Hu spoke impatiently.

"Indeed." Gou Xunli nodded. " Right now constitutes excellent opportunity."

The sworn brothers conversed in a crude mountain stronghold nestled among the continuous mountains east of Wuzhou—not far from the prefecture seat. This region featured intermixed Yao and Han settlements. Though proximate to the prefectural capital, government influence remained minimal—a domain where largest fists determined right. Bandits essentially faced no government encirclement concerns.

Yet bandit existence proved far from comfortable. Not only did Han and Yao villages interlock here, but due to Yao uprisings, the government had repeatedly conscripted Wolf Troops from Guangxi for "Yao suppression," resulting in interspersed Wolf-Zhuang stockades as well. All villages existed as fortified stockades, each maintaining militias and braves. Villages constantly engaged in conflicts and armed disputes over land, water resources, forests, and miscellaneous other reasons.

Within this atmosphere, villages maintained heavy guard, and common folk possessed rich experience in armed conflict. Whether plundering or kidnapping for ransom proved exceedingly difficult for bandits. Sometimes they'd even suffer counterattacks from intended "fat sheep." Even "side business" ventures encountered extreme hardship.

Were it not for the golden waterway of the West River with its bustling shipping traffic, and Gou Xunli's numerous schemes occasionally generating profit, they'd find supporting the stronghold's two hundred-plus members utterly impossible.

For Rotten-Eye Hu, "revenge" or "Imperial Court" held little interest. Though the Bald Thieves had slaughtered many of his brothers, he harbored no delusions about striking stones with eggs. The sole factor capable of attracting his continued collaboration with this sworn brother remained the single word: "wealth."

When they'd been trapped in Guangdong previously, Master Shi had recruited them to operate in the Yao districts of Lingao receiving "knights-errant." Though the plan ultimately failed when heroes from various walks were arrested or killed successively, Rotten-Eye Hu viewed sworn brother Gou the Second with renewed respect—serving high Imperial Court officials wasn't something ordinary greenwood heroes could curry favor with.

Don't be deceived by greenwood outlaws' usual proclamations of "fearing no officials"—in reality, the notion of "accepting amnesty to become official" held tremendous appeal. Rotten-Eye Hu had followed Gou the Second risking life and limb these years, firstly because circumstances left no alternatives, secondly because Gou the Second had been government-recruited several times, sustaining his persistent fantasy—perhaps wealth and success lay ahead.

If this opportunity enabled scoring big in Wuzhou, regardless of whether the court granted merit awards, merely looting enough for several years' expenses would suffice. Should matters proceed smoothly, accumulating lifetime wealth became possible—worst case scenario, he'd retire from this profession and relocate to the prosperous gentle lands of Jiangnan, living out remaining years. Beats continuing to muddle along in this decrepit, damp mountain stronghold.

"I've inquired thoroughly. The Fake Balds within the city number barely above two hundred. Including bailiffs they've recruited and temporarily formed militia teams, total strength reaches merely five hundred." After meeting Yi Haoran and returning, Gou Xunli increasingly believed this adventure held promise—Yi Haoran not only knew the Bald situation intimately but nursed hatred toward the Bald Thieves. Employing him as guide and liaison with authorities promised ninety-percent certainty. However, this advisor had raised one concern: Since they intended lobbying Xiong Wencan, their side required a concrete strategy enabling Lord Xiong to contemplate support possibilities.

"Second Brother, I'm not lecturing you, but the Bald Thieves' combat capabilities far exceed ours." Rotten-Eye Hu said. "These years, we brothers have suffered considerable losses at their hands! You claim they possess barely two hundred Fake Balds, yet fully reckoned, our stronghold also musters two hundred brothers—half of whom require temporary summons from home! Even storming a single stockade proves laborious. Taking such meager forces to Wuzhou—isn't that sheep walking into tiger jaws? If Viceroy Xiong doesn't dispatch troops, I consider this extremely precarious!"

"Counting on Viceroy Xiong's troop deployment proves unreliable." Gou Xunli shook his head. "This resembles conducting business—without presenting substantial goods, why should Viceroy Xiong believe us?"

"That's true..." Rotten-Eye Hu experienced some disappointment. "Then what's the discussion?"

"In the past, requesting Viceroy Xiong's troop deployment was mere fantasy—but presently he's as precarious as eggshell stacking. As long as we produce minor merit allowing him to conceal faults before the Imperial Court, he'll definitely offer substantial capital!"

Rotten-Eye Hu leaped to his feet with a "teng," pacing within the thatched "Hall of Gathering Justice," appearing somewhat excited, and asked: "Tell me, how do we proceed?!"

"Right now along both West River banks, Yao rebellions have erupted, rendering the Bald Thieves unable to attend to everything—I heard from city spies that the Bald Thieves originally intended stationing heavy troops in Wuzhou, but over ten days ago they suddenly received news and retreated in panic, leaving merely a thousand-odd men at the Ximatan drill ground west of the city..."

"Brother, you're trying to kill people without paying blood debts," Rotten-Eye Hu shook his head repeatedly, somewhat frightened. "Ximatan lies only five or six *li* from Wuzhou. With the slightest disturbance, they can reinforce Wuzhou. Our few men aren't sufficient to fill their dental gaps! Impossible, utterly impossible!"

"You know one aspect but not the other." During this Wuzhou reconnaissance, Gou Xunli had gleaned considerable intelligence. "The Bald Thieves at Ximatan aren't present daily—the entirety of Wuzhou Prefecture encompasses more than just Cangwu County! Days ago, they departed to receive surrendering subordinate counties of Wuzhou, and presently most remain absent."

"But they'll return eventually..."

"What if they can't return?"

"?" Rotten-Eye Hu's eyes widened. "You possess some brilliant stratagem?"

"Brilliant stratagem? I lack one, but the current situation proves exploitable."

The so-called situation was known to Rotten-Eye Hu—news of the "Yao Rebellion" having reached locally.

Yao ethnic distribution in Guangdong had contracted significantly during the Ming Dynasty, primarily concentrating in northern Guangdong: Lianzhou, Yingde, Ruyuan, Yangshan, and similar prefectures and counties. However, substantial numbers of Yao stockades and caves still existed in mountainous areas along the West River in Wuzhou, Zhaoqing, and vicinity. They'd once besieged Wuzhou, even breaching the city once, capturing several court officials.

Though subsequent Viceroys had arrived for "Yao suppression," basically subduing Yao peoples around Wuzhou, Yao power in surrounding mountainous regions remained formidable. For hundreds of years, conflicts with government and Han villages persisted constantly, accumulating profound grudges.

News of riots in "Eight Rows Twenty-Four Valleys" of Lianshan and similar locations had also reached locally—this place lay merely three hundred-plus *li* from Lianshan County. Rotten-Eye Hu knew: the rioting Yao people of Lianshan and other areas were establishing local connections, inciting local Yao to rise in response.

"You're suggesting alliance with the Yao people?" Rotten-Eye Hu shook his head repeatedly. "This isn't easily managed! Which of these Tusi and indigenous officials proves easy to handle! Besides, what do we use to persuade them?"

"With such enormous bait as Wuzhou, won't they be moved?" Gou Xunli sneered.

"The reasoning sounds correct, yet..." Rotten-Eye Hu regarded him. They maintained no dealings with Li people [Yao]. Usually, though well water didn't violate river water, conflicts occasionally erupted. Speaking of profound hatred proved inaccurate, yet friendship was equally absent. Could it be this brother wanted him personally lobbying the Tusi? Though Yao stockades didn't constitute dragon pools or tiger dens, lobbying at this juncture offered no guarantee the Yao wouldn't execute him as a spy.

Rotten-Eye Hu knew this sworn brother's nature—discussing resourcefulness earned passing marks, yet risking personal life entering tiger dens lay utterly beyond consideration.

Observing his doubt, Gou Xunli smiled. "Brother, don't harbor suspicions! I possess my own plan."

Gou Xunli's plan proved simple: attempt inciting Yao riots maximally, creating chaotic situations.

"The Yao people of Lianzhou have continuously dispatched personnel establishing local connections. I believe even without our incitement, they'll rise in rebellion." Gou Xunli said. "Once the Yao people rebel and create chaos, they'll inevitably descend mountains attacking villages. The Bald Thieves newly acquired Wuzhou; according to their temperament, suppressing bandits and stabilizing localities constitutes primary tasks. Therefore, this Bald Thief Director will inevitably dispatch troops pacifying the Yao. This thousand-odd force must guard against Ming troops approaching from Guangxi while suppressing on all sides—how can they still attend to Wuzhou city?"

"The Bald Thieves possess extreme power; I believe these Yao people can't resist long either..." When speaking, Rotten-Eye Hu retained lingering fears. The desperate past of being pursued by small Bald Thief units with no heaven-path or earth-road, lacking even time to close eyes for sleep, remained vivid in memory.

"As long as a gap of ten days or half a month exists, we'll possess opportunity."

"What opportunity?"

"Sneak attack on Wuzhou."

Rotten-Eye Hu's jaw nearly couldn't close, thinking this sworn brother must have gone mad. Wuzhou was a dignitary prefecture seat! Forgetting his own meager forces, even the arrogant Bald Thieves besieged it with several thousand men and bombarded it with cannons for days before capturing Wuzhou.

"Brother..." He stammered slightly. "This matter... proves unreliable..."
