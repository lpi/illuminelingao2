# Chapter 2089 - Receiving the Surrender

If they couldn't swiftly establish control over the counties subordinate to Zhaoqing Prefecture, and the Yao tribespeople inhabiting both banks of the West River began revolting, it would certainly impede the Council's pacification work in western Guangdong and tie down valuable Fubo Army forces.

Two major tasks confronted Zhu Mingxia: rapidly occupy Wuzhou to establish Council rule over all of western Guangdong, and simultaneously "pacify the Yao" to keep the mountain settlements quiescent.

From Zhaoqing to Wuzhou itself, there were no longer any defensible positions remaining. Though the shoals downstream of Wuzhou prevented the river gunboat *Zhujiang* from proceeding further, large landing craft alone would suffice to breach any enemy defense line. If river transit proceeded smoothly, taking Wuzhou would be a matter of hours.

However, the tactical and equipment adaptations demonstrated by Ming forces during the Antelope Gorge breakthrough made Zhu Mingxia realize that, despite its utter decay, the Ming military still harbored a few insightful individuals exploring ways to improve combat equipment and tactics at low technological levels. Though these improvements were far too minor to negate the Fubo Army's fundamental advantages, under certain favorable circumstances they could still inflict casualties. He needed to prepare accordingly.

"The entire brigade will rest at Zhaoqing for two days," Zhu Mingxia ordered firmly.

Since the liberation of Guangzhou, the First Brigade had been in constant motion by boat. Though river travel conserved physical energy, prolonged inactivity caused poor circulation and muscle stiffness. Some proper exercise at Zhaoqing would benefit the next phase of operations.

The First Brigade's headquarters was established at the Naval Battalion barracks outside the East Gate. Though the "surrendered" county registrar and local gentry had kowtowed and begged him to relocate to the famous local scenic spot "Seven Star Crags"—a gentry member had even offered his villa as his personal residence—the location stood too far from the West River. Zhu Mingxia chose the Naval Battalion quarters instead.

Maintaining close proximity to one's troops at all times was the surefire method for sustaining command authority. Zhu Mingxia practiced this principle regardless of which time-space he commanded in.

Within the Naval Battalion compound stood several temples. The brigade headquarters was established in the Northern Emperor Temple—though called a temple, it was really just a modest courtyard. A conference table in the main hall, maps covering the walls—that constituted the command center.

"Have all units arrived?" Zhu Mingxia asked, studying the operational map.

"Third Infantry Battalion and brigade direct-support units have arrived. Eighth Infantry Battalion is expected to arrive in full strength by 1600 hours," the staff officer reported crisply.

"And the National Army units taking over Zhaoqing administration?"

"En route. They should arrive tomorrow morning. First contingent: two companies."

"Too few." Zhu Mingxia dropped the comment without elaboration. "Have the surrendered officers and generals arrived?"

"All waiting outside, sir."

Not many Zhaoqing officials had surrendered. The only civil official was the Gaoyao County registrar; among garrison officers, merely a squad leader; among Guard officers, only a *zongqi*—all minor figures without significant influence.

"Have them wait in the courtyard."

The surrendered officers gathered in the courtyard. Aside from Gaoyao County Registrar Lan Rutian, who had surrendered voluntarily through intelligence channels, most had been too low-ranking to qualify for evacuation. When the city fell, unable to escape yet unwilling to die, they surrendered. Guard officers predominated among them.

They mostly looked bedraggled—especially the Guard officers. After the city fell, the various garrison settlements had erupted in violent riots. Officers with heavy blood-debts had mostly been slaughtered by enraged soldiers and civilians. These men had been minor figures—not deeply resented—but many had been beaten and robbed in the chaos; some had nearly lost their lives. Had the Fubo Army not arrived swiftly to restore order, they might not have lived to "submit to the Song."

When Zhu Mingxia appeared on the steps, the civil and military officers led by Lan Rutian were momentarily startled. Zhu Mingxia wasn't wearing a senior officer's dress uniform but standard field fatigues—except for the peaked cap distinguishing him from enlisted men, he was virtually indistinguishable from the ordinary soldiers standing guard in the courtyard.

"Colonel Zhu Mingxia, Brigade Commander, First Mixed Brigade, Fubo Army!" the adjutant announced in a loud, authoritative voice.

Only then did the surrendered officers realize this unprepossessing figure was a "pirate" high official. Lan Rutian stepped forward promptly, leading them in the ceremonial court bow.

Zhu Mingxia waved his hand dismissively: "No need. Everyone, rise."

"Yes!" A unified chorus echoed through the courtyard.

"Your decision to forsake darkness and embrace the light—on behalf of the Council of Elders and the Fubo Army, I extend a warm welcome!" Zhu Mingxia stood on the steps without bothering to establish a formal seat of authority.

"We thank the General's benevolence..." Lan Rutian led a deep bow of gratitude.

"You are...?" Zhu Mingxia asked directly.

"This humble official is Lan Rutian, registrar of Gaoyao County—formerly of Ming-dynasty Gaoyao County."

"Good. I understand you were already one of our comrades—working covertly for the Council?"

"Yes. Last year, this humble official came over from darkness to serve the Council of Elders faithfully," Lan Rutian replied respectfully.

"Good." Zhu Mingxia nodded with satisfaction. "I hereby appoint you Deputy County Magistrate of Gaoyao County, acting in charge of county administration!"

"Yes! Thank you, sir, for this opportunity!" Lan Rutian dropped to his knees and knocked his head on the ground three times, tears of gratitude streaming down his face.

Though the surrendered officers didn't fully comprehend what "Deputy County Magistrate" meant precisely, they understood it corresponded to something like a county deputy magistrate—essentially second-in-command of the county. For a former registrar—languishing at the very bottom of the official hierarchy—this represented a leap of three ranks. Under the Ming system, a registrar rising to county magistrate or deputy magistrate was nearlyimpossible; such cases were exceedingly rare exceptions.

"Since you're acting county head, let me first give you several assignments," Zhu Mingxia said briskly. "First: relief and comfort for the people. I've inspected the city—rioters and bandits have caused some damage. Some homes have been burned; some people have been robbed of food and property. You must arrange immediate relief. Corpses must be promptly collected and buried. Second: take our cadres and immediately assume control of the prefectural and county administrative offices. Seal the storehouses and archives. The clerks and runners of the old offices must report for duty immediately—no staying home. Third: additional troops will arrive shortly. Joint Logistics transport capacity can't keep pace yet, so you'll coordinate with my logistics officer on provisions—he'll specify exact types and quantities. Expenses will be handled through our requisition vouchers, to be settled with Joint Logistics later. How are grain reserves here?"

"Adequate, sir—there are several government granaries locally with substantial stocks."

"Good. These three matters. Go handle them promptly. Security will remain my concern. When the National Army arrives tomorrow, local security and defense will transfer to their responsibility."

"Understood, sir." Lan Rutian had memorized each task meticulously. At Zhu Mingxia's dismissal, he bowed again and withdrew expeditiously.

"As for the rest of you," Zhu Mingxia surveyed the dozen-odd Guard officers of varying heights and builds—most disheveled and bedraggled—"I can see that Zhaoqing's liberation caused you considerable suffering."

An awkward silence ensued, then an older man stepped forward cautiously: "Reporting, sir: this is all because we failed to lead our troops properly..."

Zhu Mingxia nodded but didn't elaborate on the point: "Now that you've surrendered to our Council, as long as you serve the Council faithfully, bright futures await you all."

"Thank you for your benevolence, sir!" they chorused gratefully.

"I understand that Guard-origin officers are often related to each other through family connections?"

This puzzled them somewhat, though it was undeniably true. Guards stationed long in one place often intermarried within the garrison. Over time, most families had some connection. Hereditary officers were even more so—practically cousins all.

"Sir, that's correct. Most garrison households are related in some fashion."

"So you likely have acquaintances and relatives throughout Zhaoqing Guard's various settlements and camps scattered across the prefecture?"

"Yes, sir." The quicker ones already guessed what Zhu Mingxia was driving at.

"In that case, I must trouble you with an important mission." Zhu Mingxia signaled an orderly, who brought out a tray piled with official letters.

"You'll depart immediately. Each of you take a few servants and proceed to the various settlements and camps to persuade their Ming officers and soldiers to surrender to the Council."
