# Chapter 2322 - Going to Wuzhou (I)

A steam-powered armed *Daihatsu* boat, belching black smoke and white steam, was navigating the West River.

It was neither escorting a convoy nor patrolling the river bank at cruising speed. From the moment it left the Sanshui wharf, the stoker fired up the furnace to full power, raising the boiler steam pressure to speed along.

In the noisy cabin, two simple camp beds were set up. Two shirtless men wearing only shorts sat facing each other, flipping through documents spread out on the beds.

The cabin windows were open, allowing the river breeze to blow in, but it failed completely to dispel the stifling heat inside. The steam boat on the West River surface in August was like a tin oven.

Chen Baibin threw down the document in his hand: "I can't take it anymore, I have to go out for some air, I'm about to be roasted."

Ji Xin also nodded: "I also feel it's too hot. About to get heatstroke." Saying this, he put the documents into a confidential briefcase and locked it in the safe inside the cabin.

The two walked out of the cabin and came to the foredeck, where a canvas awning had been set up. Several sailors were operating a Hotchkiss 37mm revolving cannon, nervously watching the river surface. Seeing them come out, the boatswain immediately came over to salute.

"You continue your mission, we just came for some air." Ji Xin originally felt a bit dizzy and chest-tight, but now on the deck with the river breeze blowing, he immediately felt much better.

Although there was an awning on the deck, the wooden deck was still scorching hot. The sailors were sweating like rain, yet they still wore summer uniforms and heavy steel helmets according to regulations, merely lining the helmets with a sweat-absorbing towel.

*What fine soldiers,* Ji Xin thought. *We dragged them out of a life of ignorance and hunger, and trained them into qualified soldiers from scratch. All the great achievements of the Senate rely on such ordinary people to complete. But what about many of us? We just treat them as consumables that can be mass-produced.*

He thought of the dying wounded soldiers waiting for evacuation he saw in Sanshui, and the piles of identity tags transported in gunny sacks... *The war situation in Liangguang, it seems, is not as easy as we imagined.*

He had always held some hidden worries about the Senate's decision-making. That was, the randomness of decision-making was too great. The personal emotions of Senators often influenced the direction of policy. In his view, going north seemed a bit too early; accumulating strength for a few more years would be more ideal. Of course, he wasn't unaware that going north was actually stimulated by certain external factors. The Senators were now generally inflated with ego, almost unable to suffer even a little loss. He also understood why some people who held the same view as him also supported going north, because a lethargy had appeared among the Senators in Lingao. This tragic past event similar to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fighting into the "Little Paradise" to enjoy wealth was quietly replaying in Lingao. People without ambition in Lingao City were content with enjoyment, while those with ambition were busy fighting for power. If a large-scale campaign wasn't launched to accelerate the machine of the Senate, inertia and decay would sooner or later take away the Senate's vitality.

From this point of view, fighting a war in Liangguang for a year or two might not be a bad thing. At least it got all the Senators moving. They wouldn't have the time and energy to engage in internal friction.

However, the Wuzhou Incident right now would inevitably be another big tear-up within the Senate. He held the railing, silently thinking about how to start the investigation when he arrived in Wuzhou.

Chen Baibin spoke up: "Director Ji..."

Ji Xin's current formal position was the Director of the "Special Investigation Bureau". Actually, this bureau was just him alone, without even clerks or an office. It was purely a rank treatment. Usually, he worked in the judicial department, mainly providing legal services to naturalized citizens and indigenous people, sometimes also guest-starring as a judge, prosecutor, and lawyer.

Because of his surname (Ji, homophonous with "chicken" or distinct organ in slang), people couldn't well call him "Old Ji", and calling him "Little Ji" was even worse, so they simply respectfully called him "Director Ji".

"What is it?" Ji Xin came back to his senses and asked.

"Regarding the Wuzhou matter this time, how should we proceed?" Chen Baibin was somewhat hesitant. Although he had participated in the investigation of the Hangzhou Station, that business trip didn't have too many complex inside stories regarding either Hangzhou Station or the Senate internally. Zhao Benren was also relatively cooperative. He followed the work process assigned to him by Zhao Manxiong, operated according to norms, and quite smoothly took down the investigation and inspection work of Hangzhou.

This time was starkly different. When he knew the investigation team leader was Ji Xin, Chen Baibin knew he had a troublesome matter on his hands—ordinary investigations wouldn't ask this person to come out.

"Investigation work has a process, you are not a recruit anymore..." Ji Xin said.

"I'm not saying how to do it, but..." Chen Baibin felt he couldn't express his meaning correctly, and couldn't help scratching his head and cheeks, "but what kind of stance should be held to do it."

Ji Xin looked at the river surface, smiled silently, and said: "Good, Little Chen, you understand this set now. It seems the Political Security Bureau really trains people."

Chen Baibin's face turned a bit red, defending: "It's not what you think, I just want, want to grasp the spirit of the Senate better."

"Little Chen, is it okay if I call you that?"

"Of course, I'm not even thirty yet."

"Really young." Ji Xin smiled, and explained, "I truly envy your youth. Your main idea of grasping the spirit of the Senate is correct, but I'm afraid it's very difficult, because regarding this current matter, there is basically no specific consensus within the Senate—naturally, there's no spirit of the Senate to speak of."

"But this case is very subtle." Chen Baibin was worried. Like Ji Xin, he had already read the Political Security Bureau's report on the Wuzhou Incident.

"The case is actually not subtle." Ji Xin said, "Senator Xie made a mistake and wants to cover it up."

"Correct, the problem is: the Political Security Bureau's secret report seems to be possessed by many Senators—not just us. I'm worried..."

"What are you worried about?" Ji Xin understood his meaning. The case before them wasn't complex, but there were too many people waiting to eat "human blood buns" (exploit the tragedy). Once the conclusion came out, it would inevitably be used by various parties, and the investigation team members would be at the forefront of the storm.

"I'm worried that after our report comes out, it will trigger a huge debate within the Senate."

Ji Xin nodded: "This is inevitable."

"So I think..."

"Think of being able to come up with a conclusion that everyone is satisfied with?" Ji Xin said.

"I feel avoiding meaningless arguments is what the Senate needs most right now."

"Your idea is very good, but unrealistic." Ji Xin shook his head, "This matter seems to be Xie Erren's personal affair, but behind it, many issues are involved. What ability and virtue do the two of us have to suppress the general trend? Can't be done."

Chen Baibin fell silent. He pondered for a good while. Originally he thought Ji Xin had already "fully comprehended the spirit of the Senate", but now it seemed there was no such thing.

"Then we only have to investigate realistically?" Chen Baibin said, "Completely taking facts as the criterion."

"Correct." Ji Xin nodded, "The more thorny and internally complex the case, the more we must base it on facts. Only stating objective facts is the best way for us investigators to protect ourselves. As for conclusions, you can let others make them."

"What I worry about most now is that many people know the truth. What if the conclusion we reach is different? Do we report according to the [secret] report, or report according to our investigation? Xie Erren definitely did a lot of preparation work in Wuzhou."

"Of course, report according to our on-site investigation. Otherwise, why send us?" Ji Xin said, "I understand what you mean. But going to Wuzhou, we must forget the content of this secret report. Everyone knows some things, but everyone pretends not to know. Why do we have to know?"

"I know certain things, but I know I don't know certain things, but the Senators all know I know certain things..."

"Haha," Ji Xin laughed, patting his shoulder, "Don't say this tongue twister. Wuzhou doesn't have washing powder (reference to Colin Powell's UN speech/WMD). Anyway, you remember: just act as if that report doesn't exist. We follow the steps based on Xie Erren's formal report, execute the investigation process, and then record and report truthfully."

The *Daihatsu* boat arrived at Wuzhou Wharf at noon. Xie Erren personally came to the wharf to welcome them. The three exchanged handshakes of comrades and brothers for a while.

"It must have been hot on the way. In this big summer, it's hard for you guys to ride this tin shell to Wuzhou! Hard work, hard work!"

"It's all for work." Ji Xin said lightly, "Let's hurry into the city, it's too hot here."

"Good, good." Xie Erren said repeatedly, and greeting his men, immediately two two-person bamboo silk sedan chairs were carried over, "It's some distance to the county yamen, sitting in this sedan chair saves effort and is cool."

Chen Baibin still hesitated a bit, but Ji Xin crawled into the sedan chair very calmly. Under Xie Erren's urging, Chen also entered the sedan chair.

Three bamboo silk cool sedan chairs were carried from the wharf all the way into the city. Chen Baibin saw that although there were traces of war everywhere on the city walls and streets, the street surface was level and clean, and most shops along the street had opened their doors. The complexion of the common people wasn't bad either. The preconceived impression of Xie Erren "indulging in pleasure" and "neglecting government affairs" diminished a lot—regardless of whether this scene on the street was created by rush whitewashing, having this execution ability meant he was a talent at least.

The sedan chairs carried them all the way into the San Zong Fu (Three Directors' Prefecture). Xie Erren had cleaned up the small courtyard where he and Cai Lan originally lived here for their accommodation on this business trip. Such a century-old mansion naturally had a coolness, a different world from the outside. Walking in, the two felt refreshed all over, with wind under their armpits.

"This place is not bad." Chen Baibin said, looking around. The room was not only cleaned and tidy, but all kinds of stationery were also readily available. Potted green plants were also prepared, adding a bit of coolness. Although there were no electric fans or air conditioners, living in it in summer was very comfortable.

"The bathroom is in the wing room. To be honest, the conditions are relatively simple, just take a shower." Xie Erren was enthusiastic to the point of being excessive, "Prepared banana cloth pajamas for you, especially cool. We don't have ice here."
