# Chapter 2322 - Going to Wuzhou (I)

A steam-powered armed *Daihatsu* boat, belching black smoke and white steam, navigated the West River at full speed.

It was neither escorting a convoy nor patrolling the riverbank at cruising speed. From the moment it left the Sanshui wharf, the stoker had fired the furnace to full power, raising boiler steam pressure to drive the vessel along as fast as possible.

In the noisy cabin, two simple camp beds had been set up. Two shirtless men wearing only shorts sat facing each other, flipping through documents spread across the beds.

The cabin windows were open, allowing the river breeze to blow in, but it did absolutely nothing to dispel the stifling heat inside. A steam boat on the West River in August was like a tin oven.

Chen Baibin threw down the document in his hand. "I can't take it anymore. I have to go out for some air—I'm about to be roasted alive."

Ji Xin nodded. "I feel it too. It's too hot. Heatstroke is imminent." As he spoke, he placed the documents into a confidential briefcase and locked it in the cabin's safe.

The two men walked out of the cabin and made their way to the foredeck, where a canvas awning had been set up. Several sailors were manning a Hotchkiss 37mm revolving cannon, nervously watching the river surface. Seeing them emerge, the boatswain immediately came over to salute.

"Continue your duties—we just came for some air." Ji Xin had felt a bit dizzy and chest-tight, but now on deck with the river breeze blowing, he immediately felt much better.

Though there was an awning on deck, the wooden planks were still scorching. The sailors were sweating profusely, yet they still wore summer uniforms and heavy steel helmets according to regulations, merely lining the helmets with sweat-absorbing towels.

*What fine soldiers,* Ji Xin thought. *We dragged them out of lives of ignorance and hunger and trained them into capable soldiers from scratch. All the great achievements of the Senate rest on such ordinary people. But what about many of us? We treat them as consumables that can be mass-produced.*

He thought of the dying wounded soldiers awaiting evacuation he'd seen in Sanshui, and the piles of identity tags transported in gunny sacks... *The war situation in Liangguang, it seems, is not as easy as we imagined.*

He had always harbored hidden misgivings about the Senate's decision-making—namely, that there was too much randomness in it. The personal emotions of Senators too often influenced policy direction. In his view, going north had come too early; accumulating strength for a few more years would have been more prudent. Of course, he understood that the northern campaign had actually been spurred by external factors. The Senators were now generally inflated with ego, almost unable to suffer even a minor loss. He also understood why some who shared his view had nevertheless supported going north: a lethargy had set in among the Senators in Lingao. A tragic repetition of history, similar to when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fought its way into the "Little Paradise" only to squander their opportunity in pursuit of wealth, was quietly playing out in Lingao. Those without ambition in Lingao City were content with comfortable enjoyment, while those with ambition were busy fighting for power. If a large-scale campaign weren't launched to accelerate the Senate's machinery, inertia and decay would sooner or later sap its vitality.

From this perspective, fighting a war in Liangguang for a year or two might not be a bad thing. At least it got all the Senators moving. They wouldn't have the time or energy for internal friction.

However, the Wuzhou Incident would inevitably trigger another major rupture within the Senate. He held the railing, silently considering how to begin the investigation once he arrived in Wuzhou.

Chen Baibin spoke up: "Director Ji..."

Ji Xin's current formal position was Director of the "Special Investigation Bureau." In practice, this bureau consisted of him alone, without even clerks or an office. It was purely a rank designation. Usually, he worked in the judicial department, primarily providing legal services to naturalized citizens and indigenous people, sometimes serving as judge, prosecutor, and lawyer.

Because of his surname (Ji, homophonous with "chicken" or a vulgar anatomical term in slang), people couldn't very well call him "Old Ji," and calling him "Little Ji" was even worse, so they simply addressed him respectfully as "Director Ji."

"What is it?" Ji Xin came back to his senses.

"Regarding the Wuzhou matter—how should we proceed?" Chen Baibin was somewhat hesitant. Though he had participated in the investigation of the Hangzhou Station, that assignment hadn't involved too many complex internal stories, either regarding Hangzhou Station or within the Senate. Zhao Benren had been relatively cooperative too. He had followed the work process assigned by Zhao Manxiong, operated according to procedure, and completed the Hangzhou investigation quite smoothly.

This time was starkly different. When he learned the investigation team leader was Ji Xin, Chen Baibin knew he had a troublesome case on his hands—ordinary investigations didn't require this particular person.

"Investigation work follows a process. You're not a recruit anymore..." Ji Xin said.

"I'm not asking how to do it, but..." Chen Baibin struggled to express his meaning correctly, scratching his head in frustration, "but what stance should we take in doing it?"

Ji Xin gazed at the river surface and smiled silently. "Good. Little Chen, you understand these things now. Seems the Political Security Bureau really does train people."

Chen Baibin's face reddened slightly. "It's not what you think. I just want to... want to grasp the spirit of the Senate better."

"Little Chen—is it alright if I call you that?"

"Of course. I'm not even thirty yet."

"Really young." Ji Xin smiled. "I truly envy your youth. Your basic idea of grasping the spirit of the Senate is correct, but I'm afraid it's very difficult. Regarding this current matter, there's essentially no specific consensus within the Senate—naturally, there's no spirit of the Senate to speak of."

"But this case is very delicate." Chen Baibin was worried. Like Ji Xin, he had already read the Political Security Bureau's report on the Wuzhou Incident.

"The case itself isn't actually delicate," Ji Xin said. "Senator Xie made a mistake and wants to cover it up."

"True, but the problem is this: the Political Security Bureau's secret report seems to be possessed by many Senators—not just us. I'm worried..."

"What are you worried about?" Ji Xin understood his meaning. The case before them wasn't complex, but too many people were waiting to feast on "human blood buns." Once the conclusion came out, it would inevitably be exploited by various factions, and the investigation team members would find themselves at the forefront of the storm.

"I'm worried that after our report comes out, it will trigger a huge debate within the Senate."

Ji Xin nodded. "That's inevitable."

"So I think..."

"You think we should try to come up with a conclusion that satisfies everyone?"

"I feel that avoiding meaningless arguments is what the Senate needs most right now."

"Your idea is admirable but unrealistic." Ji Xin shook his head. "This matter appears to be Xie Erren's personal affair, but behind it, many issues are involved. What ability do the two of us have to suppress the general trend? It can't be done."

Chen Baibin fell silent. He pondered for a good while. He had originally thought Ji Xin had already "fully comprehended the spirit of the Senate," but now it seemed there was no such thing.

"Then we can only investigate based on facts?" Chen Baibin said. "Completely taking facts as our criterion."

"Correct." Ji Xin nodded. "The thornier and more internally complex the case, the more we must ground ourselves in facts. Only stating objective facts is the best way for us investigators to protect ourselves. As for conclusions, let others draw them."

"What worries me most now is that many people know the truth. What if the conclusion we reach differs from what they know? Do we report according to the secret report, or according to our own investigation? Xie Erren has definitely done a lot of preparatory work in Wuzhou."

"Of course we report according to our on-site investigation. Otherwise, why send us?" Ji Xin said. "I understand what you mean. But going to Wuzhou, we must forget the content of that secret report. Everyone knows certain things, but everyone pretends not to know. Why do we have to know?"

"I know certain things, but I know I don't know certain things, but the Senators all know I know certain things..."

"Haha." Ji Xin laughed, patting his shoulder. "Don't say this tongue-twister. Wuzhou doesn't have washing powder." (Reference to Colin Powell's UN speech/WMD.) "Anyway, remember this: just act as if that report doesn't exist. We follow the steps based on Xie Erren's formal report, execute the investigation process, then record and report truthfully."

The *Daihatsu* boat arrived at Wuzhou Wharf at noon. Xie Erren personally came to the wharf to welcome them. The three exchanged handshakes befitting comrades and brothers.

"It must have been hot on the way. In this scorching summer, it's hard on you guys riding this tin shell to Wuzhou! Hard work, hard work!"

"It's all for work." Ji Xin said lightly. "Let's hurry into the city—it's too hot here."

"Good, good." Xie Erren said repeatedly, and beckoning to his men, two two-person bamboo silk sedan chairs were immediately carried over. "It's some distance to the county yamen. Sitting in these sedan chairs saves effort and keeps you cool."

Chen Baibin still hesitated a bit, but Ji Xin climbed into the sedan chair quite calmly. Under Xie Erren's urging, Chen also entered the sedan chair.

The three bamboo silk sedan chairs were carried from the wharf all the way into the city. Chen Baibin observed that though traces of war remained everywhere on the city walls and streets, the street surface was level and clean, and most shops along the street had opened their doors. The common people's complexions weren't bad either. His preconceived impression of Xie Erren as someone who "indulged in pleasure" and "neglected government affairs" diminished considerably. Regardless of whether this streetscape was the result of hasty whitewashing, having this level of execution ability meant he was at least a man of talent.

The sedan chairs carried them all the way into the San Zong Fu (Three Directors' Prefecture). Xie Erren had cleaned up the small courtyard where he and Cai Lan had originally lived, preparing it for their accommodation during this business trip. Such a century-old mansion naturally possessed a certain coolness, a different world from outside. Walking in, both men felt instantly refreshed, as if a breeze had risen beneath their arms.

"This place is quite nice," Chen Baibin said, looking around. The room had not only been cleaned and tidied, but all kinds of stationery were readily available. Potted green plants added a touch of coolness. Though there were no electric fans or air conditioners, living here in summer would be very comfortable.

"The bathroom is in the wing room. To be honest, conditions are relatively simple—just a shower." Xie Erren was enthusiastic to the point of excess. "I've prepared banana cloth pajamas for you—especially cool. We don't have ice here, unfortunately."
