# Chapter 2198 - The Relief of Lianzhou

Fang Yuanwu, the headman of the Junliao Pai on Jinfeng Mountain, had long noticed the Australians encircling Yanxi Mountain. When he saw the black smoke rising from Yanxi, he understood that Li Sanjiu wanted him to attack, striking the Australians' flank and rear to cover his breakout.

"Tell everyone to take up arms and prepare to descend the mountain!"

At his command, the warriors immediately seized their swords and spears. These two hundred men were relatively elite compared to the other *pai*'s forces—all able-bodied adults, each wearing rattan-woven armor. Though such armor offered limited protection, it was lighter and more breathable than iron, well-suited for mountain terrain.

"Headman! If everyone charges out, what about the loot?" a subordinate asked.

Over the past few days, they had plundered extensively around Lianzhou, amassing piles of goods and valuables in their camp, all awaiting transport back to their settlement.

"If we win, no one will dare touch it. If we lose, we'll have to run—who will care about loot then!" Fang Yuanwu hefted his broadsword. "Everyone, rout the Hair-Clippers first!"

Fang Yuanwu was known for his daring and ferocity, commanding considerable prestige among the Yao. When he raised his blade and shouted, his men swarmed down the mountain after him.

Fang Yuanwu had fought government troops many times and had seen their firearms. He knew muskets were devastating—a single volley could cut down many. But firearms could not sustain fire. If they could weather one or two volleys and close to melee, they could often rout the soldiers—or at least fight to a draw. If the soldiers' volleys pinned them down, however, they would not merely lose but be routed utterly.

Yang Zeng lowered his binoculars. He had known since the previous night that Yao were on Jinfeng Mountain. Consulting the map, it was easy to understand why the enemy had positioned a force there—this Li Sanjiu actually had some skill, displaying an intuitive grasp of terrain and mutual support between units.

"Order the artillery to fire," he commanded.

The six 12-pounder mountain howitzers were already loaded, crouching silently in the grass. At the order, the gun captains inserted their friction primers.

The firing parameters had been preset—if the enemy on Jinfeng Mountain were to attack, that slope was their only route.

At the company commander's order, the six mountain howitzers spat fire in sequence. Cast-iron shells screamed toward the Yao below, smashing into the crowd and bouncing along, reaping lives as they went.

Fang Yuanwu was utterly unprepared when the cannonade began—he was stunned. When he came to his senses, carnage surrounded him: corpses and severed limbs everywhere, blood pooling in all directions.

Fang Yuanwu had seen artillery before, but in this region, the terrain meant that government "pacification" forces typically did not bring heavy guns—at most, Crouching Tiger cannons or small Frankish pieces. As for the wooden cannons used in private feuds—whether made of lychee wood or ironwood—the bore could not be made too large nor the powder charge too heavy. Often they served only to make noise.

The Australians' bombardment far exceeded anything they had imagined.

Watching his men scatter in all directions, Fang Yuanwu grew frantic. "Everyone, charge!" A cannon firing one volley required considerable time to reload; if they rushed forward quickly, they would not suffer a second barrage.

But his estimate proved wrong. By the time he managed to rally his men, the second volley was already screaming toward them. Amid the wails and shrieks, his force dissolved into fleeing rabble. Fang Yuanwu himself could hold out no longer and was swept away in the rout.

"National Army Wuzhou Squadron, advance. Annihilate them completely."

The Wuzhou Squadron moved swiftly and soon wiped out Fang Yuanwu's two hundred men entirely. Apart from Fang Yuanwu himself, who escaped with a few trusted men thanks to his knowledge of the terrain, virtually none slipped through.

Watching this from Yanxi Mountain, Li Sanjiu's spirits collapsed. Two hundred men—obliterated in the time it took to drink a cup of water. Faced with such overwhelming disparity, Li Sanjiu suddenly awakened from his dreams. Becoming a tribal chieftain was utterly impossible now; plundering Lianzhou was out of the question; demanding ransom from the city was no longer his concern. Right now, survival was paramount—escape was impossible by day; he could only hold out until nightfall, then break through and vanish into the mountains. Let the Australians try to hunt them there.

He was shouting for everyone to "hold the position" when shells came arcing toward the hilltop.

Though the 12-pounder mountain howitzers had limited range, their high angle of elevation allowed them to lob shells onto Yanxi Mountain. In moments, the camp was engulfed in smoke and thunder. The already rattled Yao force dissolved into chaos.

"Everyone, stay calm!" Li Sanjiu bellowed while leading his bodyguards toward the stockade gate—the chokepoint on the mountain's approach and the route the Hair-Clippers would inevitably take. They would concentrate their main force there.

Indeed, just as they reached the gate, they collided head-on with soldiers of the Li-Miao Company. Li Sanjiu roared, brandishing his broadsword and charging at the fore. But the Li-Miao Company wielded double-barreled shotguns. A hail of buckshot swept over them, and Li Sanjiu's bodyguards fell nearly to a man. Li Sanjiu himself was wounded, barely dragged to safety by his remaining guards. The Yao camp on Yanxi Mountain was suddenly leaderless.

Amid the chaos, the Fubo Army's main force surged up the mountain, systematically clearing each position. The encampments fragmented; each *pai* and *chong* fled on their own. But ambushes awaited at every descent—volleys of musketry followed by bayonet charges from the flanks routed each fleeing group in moments.

By nine in the morning, the Yao force on Yanxi Mountain had ceased to exist. Only a few hundred survivors huddled in the "Old Camp" where grain was stored—the terrain there was so rugged that the Fubo Army could not storm it immediately. But they were completely surrounded; their fall was only a matter of time.

Despite his wound, Li Sanjiu was not seriously hurt. Yet all thoughts of becoming a "tribal chieftain" had vanished—his only concern now was how to break out. If he could reach the mountains, neither Ming forces nor Australians could touch him.

While he was mulling this over, a messenger approached. "Pan Tianshun of Yonghua is here."

Li Sanjiu knew Pan Tianshun. That the old man had climbed the mountain now meant one thing: he had come to persuade a surrender.

"What do you want here!" Li Sanjiu glared at Pan Tianshun, aching to behead the old man and dismember him to vent his fury—but in his current situation, that would be suicidal. He could only swallow his rage.

Pan Tianshun was terrified—Li Sanjiu was no gentle soul! Moreover, he and the Yonghua elders had sworn blood oaths with this man. If Li Sanjiu flew into a rage and killed him, no one would say he was in the wrong. But his entire village was now in Australian hands; when they ordered him up the mountain to negotiate, he dared not refuse.

Pan Tianshun managed to convey Yang Zeng's terms: they were to surrender immediately and submit to judgment. Provided they surrendered promptly, their lives would be guaranteed; after the fighting ended, each would be allowed to return to his own *pai*, with no further obstruction.

"And if we refuse?" Li Sanjiu asked.

"If... if you refuse..." Pan Tianshun glanced furtively at the headmen and *tianchang gong* around them. "The Australians will set the mountain ablaze... leave no one alive... kill everyone..."

At these words, the various *pai* and *chong* leaders began murmuring among themselves. Before the Fubo Army's assault, some had still nursed hopes of breaking through to the mountains and regrouping—but after the chaos of battle, none harbored such illusions anymore.

Li Sanjiu did not wish to surrender—once they did, their lives would be in enemy hands. Whenever government troops came to "pacify" the Yao, they always claimed to "pardon followers"—but in practice the killing was brutal. Not only headmen but ordinary Yao were often slaughtered. As the ringleader, his death was certain.

He wanted to resist, to find some way to break out. If they could reach the mountains, neither Ming troops nor Australians could touch them. But he commanded a coalition, and even his own *pai*'s warriors might not obey him now. The only reliable men were his dozen-odd diehards—half of whom had just been killed or wounded.

Seeing the leaders and headmen eyeing him with increasingly hostile looks, Li Sanjiu felt a chill. Were they planning to offer him up as the scapegoat? If they bound him and handed him over, he was finished!

As fear gnawed at him, the *tianchang gong* of Majian Pai sidled up and whispered: "Surrender. If we don't, the Eight Pai's able-bodied men will all die on this mountain. Even if the Australians don't strike, the Han villages below will wipe out every *pai*."

In ordinary times, Li Sanjiu—effectively the master of Majian Pai—would not have given this man a second thought. But now he had no choice but to bow. While there is life, there is hope. Surrender first, make plans later.

Pan Tianshun brought back the news of victory. The Eight Pai Yao were willing to surrender; the siege of Lianzhou was lifted.

Between those who surrendered and those captured in battle, over a thousand Yao warriors were taken prisoner. Excluding the several hundred who had fled, the force was virtually annihilated. Because the Eight Pai had committed nearly all their able-bodied men to this campaign, their headmen and elders had mostly come to Lianzhou as well. Their casualties were heavy too—at least a third had died or been wounded in the fighting.

"Treat the wounded and bury the dead," Huang Chao ordered. "Issue road passes to the prisoners and let them return home. The *pai* and *chong* headmen will be held as hostages—assign them to the Yangshan Provisional National Army Platoon for custody."

Road passes were necessary because returning to the Eight Pai required passing through Luming Pass; without a pass, they could not get through.

"Is it wise to release them all?" Fu Debang asked worriedly. "Won't they just rebel again?"

Zhou Liangchen hurried over to offer advice: seize this opportunity to slaughter all the prisoners—solve the Eight Pai Yao problem once and for all.

"The Eight Pai have suffered tremendous losses—over six hundred of their warriors killed in action alone. That's no small number," said Huang Chao. "The entire Eight Pai probably have no more than five thousand adult males."
