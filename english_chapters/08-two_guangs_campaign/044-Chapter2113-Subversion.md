# Chapter 2113 - Subversion

Watching the deepening dusk outside the window, Xiong Wencan summoned a servant.

"Have all the advisors arrived?"

"They are waiting in the garden."

"And the gentlemen?"

"Also waiting in the back."

"Mm." He nodded, stroked his beard, and glanced at his reflection in the Australian crystal mirror.

In the mirror, Xiong Wencan had shed his voluminous official robes and changed into military attire.

He nodded slightly. Two servants immediately began to buckle on his armor—an ordinary set, only slightly finer than what a common soldier or household guard might wear.

Once dressed, he inclined his head. One servant immediately opened the door for him—without raising a lamp. Several others followed closely as he descended the steps.

At the foot of the stairs, a servant in a blue coat and small cap was already kneeling. Seeing him emerge, the man immediately kowtowed.

"Xiong Yi, I'm troubling you this time."

"Master speaks too graciously. This servant will not fail the mission."

"You only need to hold until dawn. After that, ask no questions of what follows. Find your own path to survival." Xiong Wencan's voice was low. "Your family will be provided for; they shall not go cold or hungry. If, after this battle is over, fate still binds us as master and servant, return to the old estate in Yongning Guard. Arrangements will be made for you there."

Xiong Yi kowtowed again. Xiong Wencan said nothing more and led his retinue toward the rear.

At the faint light of dawn, the staff officers who had spent the night in anxious unease had not received any summons. Instead, they had gathered on their own at the front hall of the yamen. Nearly all wore traveling clothes, ready to accompany the Governor-General in his breakout.

They more or less understood that the besieging Hair-Bandits were limited in number. Apart from controlling the key waterways of the Xi and Gui Rivers, their land blockade was incomplete. With enough men to provide cover and fast horses, breaking out was entirely feasible.

Xiong Wencan's target was large, but as Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, he had his central guard regiment and over a hundred household guards. When the time came, they could pile bodies if necessary to get him out. If they stuck close, their own chances of surviving the breakout were at least eighty or ninety percent.

Yet the Governor-General still hadn't appeared. Only his personal servant Xiong Yi showed up from time to time, issuing instructions to the underlings about preparing supplies.

If Xiong Yi was here, the Governor-General must be here too.

Some who were on familiar terms with Xiong Yi quietly inquired after the Governor-General's "honored health." Xiong Yi's answer was: "The Master was deliberating strategy late into the night and talking with several of the advisors. He didn't retire until the fourth watch and is still sound asleep."

The Prefect of Wuzhou and the Magistrate of Cangwu wore mournful expressions, doing their best to accommodate the various demands of the Governor-General's staff. Unlike the others, they couldn't run. Once the city fell, they would either take their own lives or "surrender to the Hair-Bandits."

Per routine, the Governor-General's yamen served breakfast. The assembled officials were holding their teacups, chit-chatting and picking their teeth, when suddenly the rumble of artillery resumed outside. The staff officers and local officials waiting to see Xiong Wencan grew agitated—at a moment like this, was the Governor-General really still in bed, ignoring the cannon fire?

In a private residence within the city, Luo Yangming cocked his head to listen to the artillery, a faint smile playing at the corner of his lips.

His wife, however, paced back and forth in the room, wringing her handkerchief in anxiety. Since the siege began, she hadn't applied makeup, and her hair was hastily pinned. Seeing the smile on her husband's face, Ding A'tao was convinced he was going mad.

A few days earlier, when the neighborhood heads had organized merchants to "reward the troops," it was supposed to be a simple matter of each household chipping in some silver. But her husband had not only contributed the silver, he had personally bought wine and meat and accompanied the neighborhood head up onto the walls to deliver the food and drink to the soldiers—spending several more taels in the process. This sort of sticking-your-neck-out-to-be-chopped behavior, then coming home with a smile, was the first time Ding A'tao felt her husband might be losing his mind.

In recent days, he had also been consorting—for no apparent reason—with the head of the city's constable force. Ding A'tao had always kept her distance from such "official gate" types—they were all sharks who devoured people without spitting out the bones. In the past, her husband had maintained only enough contact with yamen personnel to ensure peaceful business dealings—cordial but not close. Now, through Wen Tietou's connections, he was sparing no expense to cultivate these people, handing out ten, twenty taels of pure silver. What was the point?

This silver had been saved up over years, cent by cent. Watching her husband spend so freely made her heart ache.

She had been raised on "three obediences and four virtues" and never dared interfere in her husband's affairs. But she truly couldn't see the necessity of any of this. If the city fell into chaos, what use would these swaggering constables be?

Mad as he might seem, his speech and actions in daily life appeared normal. But every time he heard cannon fire—while everyone else panicked—he would smile. Ding A'tao had secretly wept again that night: how bitter was her fate! A few years of peaceful life, then war and chaos again. Just when she most needed her husband, he was showing signs of losing his mind.

If he really went mad, what would she and her children do?!

Luo Yangming had relaxed after sending the intelligence from the city wall. He didn't know what measures the bosses would take, but now that the Elders had received the information, they would certainly act. Xiong Wencan's scheme was sure to be thwarted. And he himself had been actively working inside the city.

His activities were essentially subversion: rallying and turning the city's armed forces. His focus was the local constables and the garrison soldiers.

Both groups were composed of locals—especially the constable-recruited "militia," who were almost all Cangwu County natives, at most from nearby suburbs. Their families and relatives were in the city or on its outskirts; they couldn't afford to go to extremes. Moreover, after the influx of "guest troops," these locals had been marginalized. Not only were their pay and provisions unreliable, but they were constantly bullied by the better-armed outsiders. The two sides had deep-seated conflicts, virtually at daggers drawn.

Once Xiong Wencan lit his fires, Wuzhou would be destroyed—and these men's families, homes, and property would burn with it. Emotionally and logically, they were the group least willing to see the city torched. That made them his prime targets.

His channel for subversion was Wen Tietou. Wen Tietou had rushed into the city to warn his "brother-in-law," only to find himself trapped inside. He was now staying at the Luo residence and had become an invaluable assistant.

Wen Tietou was a dock boss who had to deal with all sorts of people; he was well acquainted with yamen personnel and had connections in the local garrison. He was an ideal conduit.

But Luo Yangming couldn't openly announce that he was a Hair-Bandit spy. First, people wouldn't easily believe him. Second, these types were utterly shameless and faithless. They might swear solemn oaths and invoke heaven and earth, then turn around and betray you without a twitch.

After much deliberation, Luo Yangming decided to approach the head of the Rice Merchants' Guild first.

The rice wholesale business was lucrative, and the guild head had been sick with worry over the war and siege. When Luo Yangming came to him expressing concern that "if the battle goes badly, Wuzhou might be reduced to ashes," the guild head immediately understood his meaning.

This unspoken understanding was widespread not only among the merchants but also among the gentry and magnates. In medieval siege warfare, the support of local elites was crucial. They controlled vast social and material resources and wielded considerable influence. In mobilizing the populace, they were extremely effective. Several desperate Ming-era sieges had been sustained only because the local gentry had thrown their full weight behind the defense.

But conversely, if the balance of power was lopsided and the enemy was quietly offering terms, these same people might secretly negotiate and open the gates. The Hair-Bandits' power in the Two Guangs was overwhelming. Their reputation for being "strict but fair"—lenient to those who surrendered promptly, devastating to those who resisted—was well known. Resistance never ended well for the leading gentry.

"What you say is true," the guild head said softly. "I've thought the same. We cannot let the people of Wuzhou fill the ditches for nothing."

"Only, I wonder..." Luo Yangming feigned timidity.

"Rest assured," the guild head's eyes narrowed. "The other local notables understand as well. It's just—" His voice dropped to a whisper. "Why does Brother Luo raise this matter? Could it be...?"

In the guild, Luo Yangming was only a middling merchant, not especially active. For him to suddenly broach such a topic meant someone was pulling the strings.

"Precisely so." Luo Yangming knew that without showing some cards, the other man wouldn't trust him. "I've been trading rice with Guangdong and have considerable dealings with Dachang. I'm well acquainted with several of their managers and supervisors."

Dachang was an Australian enterprise—an open secret in Guangdong and common knowledge in Wuzhou. As a major rice trading center, Wuzhou had many rice merchants who had done business with Dachang. The guild head nodded slightly.

"...Before Wuzhou was besieged, someone from Dachang came to the city and spoke with me at my residence," Luo Yangming continued. "He said that once hostilities began, Wuzhou—being the key to both provinces—would inevitably see fierce fighting. If everything were to be destroyed, what a catastrophe that would be!"

The guild head nodded. "What you say is true." He sighed. "If anyone else were commanding this city, it might be manageable. But with Governor Xiong himself holding the city... and the situation as it is, he's surely determined to fight to the death. With all the guest troops inside, and the most respected elders having retreated to the mountain strongholds, the remaining gentry simply don't have the face to speak up. Even if they did, it probably wouldn't help."
