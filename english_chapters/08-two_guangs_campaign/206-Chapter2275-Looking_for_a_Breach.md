# Chapter 2275: Looking for a Breach

Having resolved to pursue the Cai Lan route, Yi Haoran devoted his efforts to Qi Liheng. This child was also the seed of learning—young but remarkably intelligent. In just half a month, he had memorized the "Hundred Family Surnames" fluently and started on the "Thousand Character Classic," already recognizing two or three hundred characters.

Though Qiuchan still bore the pain of losing her husband, seeing her son so intelligent and eager to learn brought her some measure of comfort. Her respect for Yi Haoran deepened accordingly. Noticing that the food at the shop was ordinary, every few days she would prepare one or two side dishes herself and have her brother from her maiden home deliver them as offerings for Master Yi. Sometimes, when no one from her maiden family was available, she came herself. Seeing that Yi Haoran's clothes were ragged, she altered some of her late husband's old garments and gave them to him.

Under normal circumstances, Qiuchan's behavior would have been considered rather "improper." But her family had been merchant folk who never paid much attention to such things. Moreover, after great upheavals, social customs often loosened; various "relaxations of ethical codes" emerged constantly. Compared to those, Qiuchan's actions were hardly out of line.

Yi Haoran took the opportunity to inquire about Cai Lan's situation. Jiang Qiuchan suspected nothing and recounted her entire experience as an "accompanying woman" in thorough detail.

Since Cai Lan had been released from prison and temporarily detained in the Earth God Temple, her sharpness had gradually faded. She was originally just a modest young lady from a humble family, raised without hardship or much experience of the world. After her family's decline, she had traveled thousands of *li* to seek refuge with her fiance, only to arrive just as Wuzhou fell and her fiance took his own life. With no way forward, she had conceived the thought of assassinating the Hair thief leader, then dying in martyrdom for her husband.

The strike she had delivered with all her strength before Dragon Mother Temple had exhausted every last bit of her sharpness. When she then suffered a brutal beating in the prison, it shattered the spirit of a woman accustomed to being spoiled—truly, as they say, she could neither live nor die. By the time Xie Erren released her for preferential treatment, though her heart still regarded him as her "husband's killer," she had unconsciously added a few threads of gratitude.

Detained in the Earth God Temple for several days, she not only had her injuries treated but was allowed to bathe and change clothes, with good food supplied daily. At first, Cai Lan still feared this Hair thief Xie plotted misconduct. She refused to wear the fine clothes he sent, wearing only her own old garments. At night, she dared not undress to sleep, and she secretly sharpened a hairpin, hiding it on her person, prepared to use it for suicide if the Hair thief tried to force himself upon her.

But Cai Lan waited bitterly for many days, and the Hair thief seemed to have forgotten her entirely, never showing his face. Thus the resolve she had gathered with such difficulty leaked away again. As the days passed and her will eroded, she no longer held the determination to die.

When Xie Erren heard that her spirit had dissipated and that she had stopped insisting on wearing her old clothes and torn garments, he knew the process was five or six parts complete. So he had her moved from the yamen to the Three Headquarters—where not only were there more buildings, but the environment was far better than the prefectural yamen.

"...She now lives alone in a small courtyard there. Her daily needs are all provided for, and there are servant girls and women to attend her. It's just that her days pass drearily—all she can do is amuse herself with calligraphy and painting. When I go in to keep her company, she seems quite happy. But she sighs from time to time..." Jiang Qiuchan said.

Yi Haoran listened carefully, then asked: "In your opinion, is this Cai Lan finding favor with the Australian?"

Qiuchan started in surprise. This Master Yi had always presented the face of a modest gentleman and had never asked about such domestic gossip. That he would suddenly come out with such a question...

Yi Haoran also realized his inquiry was somewhat abrupt, but it was something he had to know. His mind raced, and he suddenly remembered: Chang Qingyun was also among Jiang Qiuchan's benefactors. He could make good use of this point.

Feigning deep distress, he sighed: "Ah, this is not something I should be asking about. This Miss Cai is also a woman of bitter fate. It's just that there is a difficult matter at hand, and I must seek her help to accomplish it."

Seeing her benefactor speak with such a solemn face, Qiuchan believed him seven or eight parts. She hurriedly asked: "What difficult matter does Sir mean?"

"A former colleague of mine from Governor Xiong's Shogunate, Master Chang Qingyun..."

"What? Master Chang's whereabouts are known?" Qiuchan was excited.

Chang Qingyun had done her a great kindness. Back then, if he had not stood forward, Qiuchan would have been violated right there in the street. In an era when a woman's reputation and chastity were considered greater than life itself, Chang Qingyun's grace was even greater than Yi Haoran's. Though she was but a frail woman, she was someone who dared to act and who cherished kindness and righteousness. She would absolutely not ignore a benefactor in trouble.

"Yes." Yi Haoran nodded with affected gravity. "Master Chang failed to break through the siege. He was captured by the Hair thieves and is now imprisoned at the Sanheui parade ground..." He paused deliberately and sighed.

"What's happened?" Jiang Qiuchan pressed. "Has Master Chang met with some misfortune?"

"He is a *Juren* Master and was also Governor Xiong's advisor and friend. The Hair thieves hate scholars most of all. A *Juren* in that camp—what good could possibly come to him?" Yi Haoran said heavily. "He suffers every abuse, barely dragging out a feeble existence."

"How terrible." Jiang Qiuchan's heart grew heavy at once. She twisted her handkerchief tightly in her hands. "He must be suffering greatly."

"A few days ago, I received word that Master Chang has endured so much torture in the camp that his body has broken down. He's now bedridden with illness. I went to great lengths to find connections, and today I finally managed to slip into the camp. When I saw his condition—truly, nothing but skin and bones. If this continues, he probably won't last long!"

"How dreadful!" Jiang Qiuchan said. "Sir wants to rescue Master Chang..."

"Indeed I do," Yi Haoran nodded. "But as you know, I'm merely a fish that slipped through the net. Being able to keep myself safe already counts as tremendous good fortune. How could I have the means to save him? The only option is to open another path. If Miss Cai has found favor with the True Australian Senator, she might be able to say a word on his behalf—perhaps that could secure Master Chang's release."

This reasoning was airtight. Jiang Qiuchan could not help but believe him. Sure enough, a layer of worry colored her face.

"Sir speaks rightly. With Master Chang in trouble, both emotionally and morally, this servant should exert herself to save him. It's just that this matter cannot be accomplished in one step," Qiuchan said. "Though True Australian Senator Xie provides her with brocade clothes and fine food, Miss Cai is unhappy every day, often weeping. Moreover, when this servant goes to her, I always arrive in the morning and leave before dusk. Whether she has received his grace and favor, I don't know and dare not ask."

"Then what do you usually do when you're together?"

"Nothing special. I keep her company in conversation to ease her boredom. We also do needlework together, play chess, play leaf cards. Sometimes I accompany her in painting." Qiuchan frowned, trying hard to recall. "Actually, she speaks very little and rarely mentions her own affairs. This servant dares not ask too many questions."

"Has she never mentioned the True Australian?"

"Not a single word."

"And her fiance?"

"Also never mentioned." Qiuchan frowned. "She only sheds tears suddenly from time to time."

"Is her makeup and appearance usually tidy?"

"Actually, yes, quite tidy..." Qiuchan started to say, then suddenly exclaimed: "Speaking of which, she must..."

"Yes," Yi Haoran nodded. "Allow me to ask one more indelicate question. In your opinion, is Cai Lan still a virgin?"

This was somewhat difficult to answer; it touched on personal privacy and concerned reputation and chastity. Qiuchan pondered for a moment before saying: "No."

"Then that settles it." Yi Haoran tapped his fan against his palm. "I knew Cai Lan's fiance. He was a most upright gentleman. When Cai Lan came to seek refuge with him, because the war made things dangerous, he feared that if he met with misfortune, it would ruin her future. So he refused to complete the marriage with her. They never consummated their union."

"I see." Qiuchan grew thoughtful. "She is also a woman of bitter fate..."

"Cai Lan had no choice in the matter. Humans are not sages—how can anyone be without fault? There is no need to judge her harshly." Yi Haoran knew that Qiuchan too had her own sorrows. He could not reproach her with grand righteousness—otherwise, if she applied the logic to herself and turned rebellious, the whole plan would fail. "If things are as you describe, she may have some chance of success in asking Senator Xie for this favor."

"Yes," Qiuchan said. "To rescue Master Chang, this servant will certainly do everything in her power. It's just that Miss Cai's moods are unpredictable. Other matters are easy enough to manage, but asking the Australian for something—that won't be so simple. Let this servant think of a careful approach..."

Yi Haoran nodded. "You are a true heroine among women. I trust you in this matter. However, Master Chang is no ordinary captive. If something goes wrong, you—being a local with family—might come to harm. It would be better for me to speak directly." Seeing Qiuchan's doubtful expression, he explained: "As I told you, I have old ties with her fiance Xing Chenghuan. I still have a folding fan with an inscription that Master Xing gifted me back then. If I could meet her face to face, I could surely persuade her..."

Naturally, Yi Haoran couldn't actually have Qiuchan handle this matter, because Chang Qingyun was living quite well—there was no "skin and bones" to speak of. Besides, getting Chang Qingyun out wasn't actually difficult; there was no need for such elaborate scheming.

Qiuchan was secretly moved by his consideration, but still somewhat hesitant: "If Sir says so, this servant naturally believes you. But Sir is a man. How could you enter her courtyard? Just to enter the Three Headquarters, one needs to pass a waist-pass inspection..."

"I naturally cannot enter. But she can come out."

"Come out?" Qiuchan was puzzled. "She is practically under house arrest in the Three Headquarters. She never steps outside the courtyard. And she's so depressed and unhappy..."

"If she doesn't step out, is it because the True Australian has forbidden her to leave?"

"Actually, no," Qiuchan remembered something. "A few days ago, Senator Xie sent people to ask if she wanted to go out for a walk—he would send people to escort her. But Cai Lan was unwilling."

"Perfect." Yi Haoran thought to himself: *Heaven is helping me!* "All you need to do is persuade her to go out and burn incense. I see that Dragon Mother Temple outside the city is an excellent place."

Women in situations like Cai Lan's usually harbored bitter depression in their hearts. They could hardly be expected to have interest in touring mountains or enjoying scenery. But burning incense and worshipping the gods offered considerable comfort to their troubled psychology.

"She's an outsider, so she probably doesn't know about Dragon Mother Temple's efficacy. You're a native of Wuzhou—you must know many tales of the Dragon Mother Temple's miraculous powers. Tell her more about them and encourage her to burn incense. She'll most likely be willing to go."
