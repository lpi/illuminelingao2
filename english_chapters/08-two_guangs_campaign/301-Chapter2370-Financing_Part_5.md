# Chapter 2370: Financing (Part 5)

"This... these are documents to be delivered to General Manager Zhou." Secretary Zhou's tone was flustered. Her previously arrogant attitude disappeared without a trace. It looked like she was trying hard to think of words to say, "He... General Manager Zhou hasn't been in Guangzhou recently! I couldn't send them! I had no choice but to store them all first and send them to him together when General Manager Zhou returns!"

Chu He ignored her. He casually tossed his own memorandum to Little Pu and rummaged through the rest. There were a full dozen or so memoranda and letters of various kinds in the file basket. Judging from the signatures, they were all from Senators with very unfamiliar names, some he knew and some he didn't. Among them was conspicuously the document from Senator Ren Youzi who just left dejectedly.

Chu He straightened up and let out a long breath. Fire was almost coming out of his eyes. In an instant, he even had thoughts of killing someone. Although he "willingly degenerated" and was covetous of comfort, being a "slacker" for several years, he had cultivated enough "self-cultivation of a slacker."

However, at this moment, he was completely shocked. So this was his status in the hearts of the naturalized citizens! From D-Day until now, which naturalized citizen didn't regard Senators as gods? Even those highest-level naturalized cadres, the life secretaries of big shots, at most would "treat with courtesy." No one dared to be so disrespectful to a Senator!

And now, the plan he had spent countless time and effort drafting had been thrown into such a file box. Although this was not a trash can yet, he could imagine that a pile of memoranda stuffed together regardless of date would end up the same as job resumes in an HR filing cabinet—thrown away directly as garbage!

For a moment, Chu He's blood surged, and his face was flushed red. Pu Zhixian's hand touched his gun handle, ready to take down this secretary who didn't know the heights of heaven and earth as soon as Senator Chu gave the order—or simply give her a few slaps and make her kneel down and apologize.

"Little Pu!" Chu He barely controlled his emotions. In an instant, countless thoughts turned in his mind. According to his impulse, killing Secretary Zhou on the spot wouldn't be enough to vent his anger. But killing a naturalized cadre in the office, unless the other party was a traitor or a spy, no matter how justified he was, he would be tainted.

Seeing Pu Zhixian eager to act, he waved his hand to stop the guard.

"Good! Very good!" Chu He spat out these words from his lips, grabbed several documents, and turned around to leave. Secretary Zhou wanted to stop him, but she was intimidated by his "murderous gaze" and didn't dare to move, stammering. Pu Zhixian glared at her fiercely, turned around, and followed.

"Chief! You... we just let it go like this?" Pu Zhixian asked, chasing out.

"This isn't over. Let's find a place to reason!" Chu He walked out of the building with anger, and the guard hurried to keep up.

"Go find Manager Gao and tell him to prepare a vehicle!"

"Yes!" Pu Zhixian responded. In a short while, Manager Gao came over with a sedan chair.

"Chief! They are digging roads everywhere in the city. Carriages can't get through. Only sedan chairs..."

Chu He ignored him and got directly into the sedan chair, shouting: "Go!"

Pu Zhixian hastily asked: "Chief! Where are we going?"

"Go, to the Municipal Government!" Chu He shouted, then muttered in a low voice: "If Liu Xiang also TM puts on airs, I can only go back to Lingao to make a scene!"

The sedan chair had just started when Chu He suddenly shouted again: "Stop!"

The sedan carriers didn't understand why but stopped again. Chu He sat in the sedan chair for less than a minute, his mind turning several more times. What was he going to Liu Xiang for? Say what? Was he going to cry to Liu Xiang? In the final analysis, Liu Xiang was just the mayor of Guangzhou, not Zhou Wei's superior—even if he was Zhou Wei's superior, what could he do to Zhou Wei? At most, he would ask him to come and apologize, and drink three times the wine as a penalty. Besides, was this Secretary Zhou so rampant because of petty people gaining power, or was it Zhou Wei's instruction? Of course, whether true or false, Zhou Wei would not admit the latter...

What about finding Wen Desi? The situation was the same as with Liu Xiang. It couldn't directly solve any problems. What he wanted was not to vent—if he wanted to vent, he would have done it on the spot in the office. Why bother "begging others to uphold justice?"

Pu Zhixian saw the Chief's expression changing in the sedan chair, biting his teeth without saying a word, and hurriedly asked: "Chief! Where are we going now?"

"To the Municipal Government!"

Chu He thought, no matter what, this matter must be made big. If it wasn't made big, it would be equal to him wimping out. Only by making it big would Zhou Wei be willing to pay a sufficient price. Otherwise, if you don't even dare to make a scene, why would anyone pay attention to you? Thinking of this, he had already figured out the next steps properly.

"Yes!" Just as the sedan chair was about to set off, Chu He stopped Pu Zhixian again, "You go find Senator Ren Youzi who just left—he must also be staying here. Ask him to go to the Municipal Government immediately—I'll be at Mayor Liu's—and say I have urgent business with him!"

Liu Xiang was at the Municipal Government. Not only was he there, but several major Senators of Guangzhou were also there. They gathered together, and the main purpose was naturally to "make money."

Guangzhou's biggest test was over, but there was still a pile of aftermath to deal with: refugees needed relief to get through daily life, merchants needed loans to reopen business, and for so many days, medical staff, soldiers, police, cadres at all levels, and the Jia Heads and Group Heads on the streets had all been working day and night. Quite a few people had sacrificed themselves. The dead needed pensions, the living needed rewards, all of which required money.

But where would the money come from? Economic activities in Guangzhou had completely stopped these days, and merchants were nearly bankrupt—big merchants like Gao Ju were not as desperate as small and medium merchants, but they had also lost more than half a year's income. This meant that in the taxation field, the once-hopeful industrial and commercial taxes were completely hopeless—not only hopeless, but in order to nurture the fish, loans had to be given to merchants to help them get through the difficulties.

Expecting funding from higher authorities was impossible. Too much reliance on Delong's policy loans was also not possible. Cheng Dong sent instructions every week: banks should pay attention to currency exchange risks and the possibility of hyperinflation.

In terms of local revenue, the "spoils of war" had almost been spent, and Ai Zhixin's grand blueprint for "tax reform" was pretty much bankrupt. Fortunately, the two deputy directors he had been anxiously waiting for had finally arrived.

Both Wang and Zhang were veterans of the tax system. Although their academic qualifications were not as impressive as Ai Zhixin's, their practical experience was second to none in the Senate. Whether Ai Zhixin or Liu Xiang, they were all waiting for them to come and "turn stone into gold" for Guangzhou, digging up the silver hoarded by the old money.

"What? Senator Chu He requests an audience?" Liu Xiang was somewhat bewildered when he heard the secretary's report—because he didn't know him at all, nor had he heard of him.

"A few days ago, the General Office sent a Senator itinerary telegram. Senator Chu He came to Guangzhou on business..."

After the secretary's reminder, Liu Xiang remembered that there seemed to be such a thing.

"Did the telegram say what he came for? What does he want to see me about?"

"The telegram didn't specify, but it seems to be related to the Nanyang Company."

"For Nanyang Company matters, he should go to Zhou Wei. What's he looking for me for?" Liu Xiang was not fond of these "slacker" Senators who didn't attend to their proper duties. Needless to say, this Senator Chu He was probably one of the Senators who recently came to ride Zhou Wei's hot coattails. A few days ago, Ai Zhixin joked that if you threw a brick in the First Guesthouse now, nine out of ten times you would hit a member of the Southbound Faction.

"He said he had a very urgent matter to report to you. It concerns the unity of the Senate." The secretary said, then lowered his voice, "I saw him very angry; there might be something going on..."

Liu Xiang nodded. Although he didn't know what had happened, since he came to the door, there must be something urgent.

"Please show him to the reception room. I'll go see him in a moment."

Ai Zhixin asked: "Mayor Liu! What's up with this Chu He?"

"Not clear. But the secretary said he seemed quite anxious." Liu Xiang stood up and said, "Just in case, I'll go see him. You all wait here for a moment; it shouldn't take long."

"...Just such a mere secretary, actually able to isolate inside from outside, block sight and hearing, deceive superiors and hide from subordinates, destroy unity! If this continues, what will become of us! What will become of us!" Chu He was "impassioned," half sincere, half affected, waving the stack of proposals in his hand, "Look! Look, the proposals we Senators spent effort writing have all been thrown into a file box. The oldest has been sitting there for half a month! Is this preparing to sell waste paper or throw it in the trash? Where has the Senate's mail delivery system gone? Who gave her such great power? Is this TM still a Senator's secretary? A eunuch of the Directorate of Ceremonies or a Director of the Eastern Depot?!"

"Outrageous! This is too improper!" Liu Xiang already understood the details of the matter. To be honest, he was not surprised at all. Because this kind of thing was not rare. Although he himself couldn't be sure whether this was Zhou Wei's intention or the secretary's arbitrary behavior, he had to show a "stand together against a common enemy" stance on this matter.

"I'll immediately send someone to find Zhou Wei and have him come and explain clearly in person!" Liu Xiang picked up the phone without hesitation and shook it a few times, "Quick, immediately send someone to find Zhou Wei! Have him come to the Municipal Government! What?" He frowned, "He went to Foshan?! He won't be back until tomorrow. Okay, I know. You notify him: I invite him to come to Guangzhou Municipal Government tomorrow evening. Yes! That's right." Then he shook the phone a few more times: "Connect me to Wu Mu! What? He's not there either?" After a moment, he said: "Then go invite Mu Min, and ask her to come to my meeting room immediately!"

He put down the phone: "When he comes tomorrow, I'll talk to him! Although I can't control Nanyang Company matters, this happened on Guangzhou's territory, so I also have jurisdiction." Speaking, he softened his tone, "Sit down first, drink some water, and calm down."

"I'm heartbroken! Heartbroken!" Chu He had clearly gotten into character, just short of tears streaming down his face, "The Senate may not be called a big family, but at least everyone is in the same boat. What is happening now?! It's so difficult even to meet someone! I think this Senate is done for!"
