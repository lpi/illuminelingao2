# Chapter 2263: Gui River Bridge

Following a round of applause—an etiquette newly fashionable since the Australians came—Xie Erren cut a red silk ribbon—also a new gadget brought by the Australians, announcing the resumption of traffic on the Gui River Floating Bridge which had been interrupted for many days.

Although the Gui River Floating Bridge was just a pontoon bridge, it had great symbolic significance for the local people of Wuzhou. After a period of warfare, life was finally back on track.

Bridge repair could be described as godspeed: originally, the gentry and commoners in the city thought it would take at least a year or half. Unexpectedly, the first thing the Rehabilitation Bureau did after raising money and grain was to repair the floating bridge. Not only were many refugees recruited to participate, but the Australian navy stationed here also participated in the bridge repair.

Xie Erren mobilized the commoners to find those surviving pontoon boats, and asked the sailors stationed locally to salvage several sunken boats from the water, repairing them one by one. When they really couldn't find any, they searched for boats of suitable size from the captured official boats and civilian boats abandoned by owners. Finally, they managed to gather 56 pontoon boats for bridging. Local blacksmiths forged the missing chain links, and re-hammered and connected the salvaged iron chains on site, sitting on boats loaded with wind furnaces and anvils.

After busy work like this for dozens of days, the floating bridge was finally repaired and unblocked at the end of May in 1635. The next day, Xie Erren held this grand "Opening Ceremony."

Xie Erren put down the scissors, and immediately firecrackers exploded loudly. A group of Rehabilitation Bureau members and local large households who came to watch the ceremony stepped forward to offer congratulations. The ordinary commoners here were also beaming with joy. Many people even rushed to snatch the cut silk ribbon when it fell—it was said that getting it would bring good luck or cure diseases. Xie Erren was happy to see this kind of "superstition" and didn't order it to be stopped.

Yi Haoran was also in the crowd watching the ceremony. Ever since he wandered near the West Gate of Wuzhou last time and saw Master Qiao coming out of the Rehabilitation Bureau located in the City God Temple, he had been very cautious. Because Master Qiao had spoken with him face to face and knew his identity. If recognized by him, his cover identity would be exposed immediately.

Fortunately, Master Qiao was very cautious at this juncture. Except for going to the Rehabilitation Bureau and the Rice Grain Guild for discussions, he rarely left his house. As long as Yi Haoran paid a little attention, he could avoid him in time.

Even so, Yi Haoran felt fearful—he was now not only a fugitive former advisor but also involved in Gou Xunli’s conspiracy. Once captured, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Yi Haoran was over fifty years old, with rich experience. His skill in recognizing and distinguishing people had entered the realm of transformation. Upon contact with Gou Xunli, he knew he was a "treacherous and evil person," definitely not of the kind sort. Whatever "Lin Gao gentry" he claimed to be was mostly gilding himself; nine out of ten he was a character like a local tyrant.

Originally, he looked down on such people and would not cooperate with them. But Gou Xunli’s deep-seated hatred for the Hair thieves was real. Since he was unwilling to flee with his tail between his legs and wanted to fight the Australians well, this was a god-sent help—at least, he didn't have to worry about Gou Xunli betraying him.

Borrowing the opportunity of collecting debts for the rice shop to go out of the city, he met secretly with Gou Xunli several times at the Dragon Mother Temple. He listened to Gou Xunli’s attempt to "do big things." At first, Yi Haoran only felt he was indulging in fantasy, especially his attempt to "capture the Hair thief chief alive." It made Yi Haoran feel even more unreliable.

But unexpectedly, this wretched man actually mentioned the past event of Hou Dagou to him. Yi Haoran was instantly moved.

The past event of Hou Dagou launching a surprise attack on Wuzhou in the seventh year of Tianshun, killing and capturing multiple officials, was something Yi Haoran had seen when reading the prefecture gazetteer during idle times in the shogunate. Of course, this Hou Dagou was a Yao "great bandit." The Imperial Court mobilized troops and sent a famous official like Han Yong to take command before suppressing it. In comparison, Gou Xunli was just a bandit leader...

However, he thought again, Hou Dagou was just an ordinary Yao barbarian at the beginning of his uprising. Not necessarily much better than this Gou Xunli. Since ancient times, heroes often came from the grassroots. Judging him by his origin was inevitably shallow.

If he could really capture or behead a true Australian, it would be no less than a great boost for the Imperial Court and government troops who had been repeatedly defeated by the Hair thieves. He himself would also establish an unworldly merit!

Although Yi Haoran was old, his heart for establishing merit and career had not been extinguished. At this moment, the Imperial Court was in danger, and the two Guangs were seeing imminent fall into the hands of Hair thieves. He was unwilling to stop here and flee. Immediately, he agreed to cooperate with Gou Er.

Although the two sides formally partnered up, Gou Xunli himself couldn't say accurately how to catch a true Australian. What he could think of was to imitate Hou Dagou's past event.

The problem was that neither Yi Haoran nor Gou Xunli was clear on how Hou Dagou fought into Wuzhou back then. Presumably, it used the method of surprise attack with light troops and coordinating from inside and outside.

After the two discussed, they set a plan: Yi Haoran would organize internal support in the city, and Gou Xunli would prepare outside the city. When the time was ripe, they would coordinate inside and outside, take Wuzhou in one breath, and capture or kill Xie Erren!

With such thoughts, Yi Haoran walked around Wuzhou city every day in his spare time from working at the rice shop. While looking for like-minded people, he spied on the Australians' flaws, waiting for a suitable opportunity.

However, this opportunity never came. Especially after the main force of the Wuzhou National Army arrived, the number of garrison troops in the city increased sharply, and all key points were guarded by troops. There was also a Fubo Army company armed to the teeth in the city. No matter how he looked at it, he felt unassured.

The opportunity for a surprise attack didn't come, but news came that Teng County and other subordinate counties of Wuzhou Prefecture had fallen successively. His originally very small hope of government troops counterattacking from the Guangxi side was completely shattered. Fortunately, news of bandit uprisings and Yao riots in various places in Guangdong came subsequently, rekindling his hope.

He learned from grapevine news on the street and boatmen coming and going on the Xijiang River: the riots affected a very wide area, and the entire northern Guangdong region fell into chaos. The Australians had insufficient troops and were recruiting soldiers everywhere right now. Sure enough, not long after, he heard local yamen runners say in the teahouse that the Australians were recruiting new soldiers from the government troop captives at Sanheui Parade Ground, forming some "National Army," said to be preparing to fight the Yao people.

Since the Australians had insufficient troops, Wuzhou, even as a key town, probably couldn't invest too many troops. Maybe they even had to withdraw troops to participate in search and suppression and patrols along the river. In this way, there might be an opportunity to exploit!

But this excitement didn't last long. Yi Haoran soon discovered that he was a loner in Wuzhou City. To coordinate from inside and outside, he, an over-fifty scholar, was unable to do what he wanted; he had to find helpers.

But where were these helpers? Sanheui Parade Ground was the largest captive camp for Hair thieves in the Wuzhou area. Captives captured from various places were sent here for centralized detention and screening. There were fully as many as a thousand people.

Yi Haoran originally had designs on them. As long as he could get a sum of silver, it shouldn't be hard to go in and incite the captives to revolt. And the guard of this captive camp was not strict; usually, only the Security Team—the former Militia corps—guarded it, but outsiders were forbidden to enter or leave. This made Yi Haoran somewhat embarrassed—after all, he was not some Jianghu hero who could fly over eaves and walk on walls; it was impossible to swim and climb walls to enter the captive camp. Furthermore, he didn't have such a sum of silver either.

At this time, he remembered Chang Qingyun—as a member of the captives, he should also be in the captive camp at Sanheui. If he could get his assistance, the matter of infiltrating the camp area would be half done.

He remembered seeing Chang Qingyun working as a bookkeeping gentleman at the construction site near the Gui River Floating Bridge on his way to meet Second Master Gou at the Dragon Mother Temple. Why not go look for him? Since he didn't expose him last time, evidently his conscience was not yet dead. If he reasoned with him, maybe he could get his help.

Unexpectedly, when he came, he didn't find Chang Qingyun, but happened to run into the Australian Prefect's "ribbon-cutting ceremony." Seeing Master Qiao was also there, Yi Haoran dared not move around casually, only mixing in the crowd pretending to watch the bustling scene.

Seeing that pretty-boy-like Hair thief "Prefect" looking like a human but acting like a dog "cutting the ribbon," with a group of local large households around him—merchants were one thing, but several local gentry large households also mixed in, bowing and scraping to this true Australian, a look of ugly flattery. It made Yi Haoran burn with anger in his heart, unconsciously cursing "clowns jumping over beams"! Unwilling to watch more, he squeezed towards the outside of the crowd, thinking to go check the nearby city wall repair site to see if Chang Qingyun was there.

Work on the floating bridge site had ended, but he already knew that the Australians drove the labor corps composed of captives out to work every day, doing everything from repairing city walls, clearing ruins, salvaging sunken ships, to loading and unloading supplies. Then Chang Qingyun would likely continue to be his bookkeeping gentleman at other construction sites.

As long as he could come out, he would have a chance to meet Chang Qingyun. Dayun Gate, not far from the Gui River Floating Bridge, was a key point of contention between the two sides and was most severely damaged. Nearby markets and wharves were also affected by the war, a complete mess. Sunken ships and ruins had not yet been cleaned up. As a bookkeeping gentleman, Chang Qingyun was very likely at a construction site near here.

With this purpose, Yi Haoran wandered outside Dayun Gate. Dressed as an accountant and carrying an account book, no one suspected him.

However, he walked once along the Gui River outside Dayun Gate. Wherever laborers were working, he leaned close to take a few looks, but never saw Chang Qingyun. He felt somewhat disappointed—where did he go?

He heard people say that every now and then, returning transport fleets would transport captives from Sanheui Parade Ground away—said to be sent to Guangzhou. could Chang Qingyun have been sent away?

While hesitating, he suddenly heard someone calling: "Sir, take a boat? Sir, take a boat?"

This was a ferryman by the river soliciting business. Although there was a floating bridge, it was already very far from here. Some unwilling to detour often paid a few coppers to cross the river. Yi Haoran didn't mind, waving his hand: "I'm not crossing the river."

"Sir, better cross the river." The other party actually entangled relentlessly.

Yi Haoran looked disgusted. Just as he was about to stiffen his face and scold the short, dark, and thin boatman in front of him, he suddenly froze!
