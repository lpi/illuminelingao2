# Chapter 2172 - Strategy and Judgment

Facts proved that Zhu Mingxia and the others had still underestimated the moral baseline of a feudal society. Xiong Wencan was now treating a dead horse as a live one; as soon as the strategy of "unleashing soldiers to become bandits" was released, various "official bandits" emerged one after another. Not only did the scattered Ming troops in Guangdong quickly turn into bandits, but a considerable number of government troops who had originally surrendered and were "temporarily guarding the cities" also transformed into various bandit groups; many officers and soldiers who had retreated to Guangxi also returned to Guangdong in droves.

Most deadly were some local "tuhao" (local tyrants) and "xiangxian" (village worthies). Originally, they held the mindset of "guarding the villages," but the rampancy of bandits made them impatient to join this carnival of plunder. Especially in some mountainous counties where conflicts between locals and guest settlers (Hakka) already existed, the chaotic times immediately turned the situation into a chaotic brawl of mutual expulsion and looting.

The situation was tangled and chaotic, but Xu Ke judged from various circumstances that although this mass disturbance was dazzlingly messy, it lacked a backbone. At least so far, no leader like Li Zicheng or Zhang Xianzhong had appeared to gather these forces. Although Guangxi was fully "encouraging" and giving material support, there was no sign of a high-level leader returning to Guangdong to "preside over the overall situation." Therefore, in the short term, these bandit gangs could not condense into a sufficiently large force; apart from harming the common people, they would not have much impact on the overall situation.

However, if this bandit chaos were prolonged, at some stage, the waves would wash away the sand, and a leader with deep popularity and outstanding methods would inevitably emerge. At that time, the "bandit gangs" would evolve into "roving insurgents"—the Li, Zhang, and Cao groups of the late Ming were largely upgraded step by step in this way.

It was based on this judgment by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau that Zhu Mingxia, after asking for instructions from Xi Yazhou, proposed the operational plan for the Public Security Rectification of West Guangdong.

The plan was not complicated. The main objective was to restore the security status around Lianshan, contain the "Yao disturbance" within the Lianzhou area, and curb the trend of the Yao uprising expanding. At the same time, they would suppress bandits along the route, restore normal order in various counties, and use cannons to deliver naturalized citizen county magistrates and National Army companies into the counties to rebuild order.

"...The core of the mission is to prevent the expansion of the Yao disturbance and restore local order," the staff officer responsible for the briefing spoke with assurance at the combat meeting.

The specific combat plan was to form the Sui River Detachment, with Yang Zeng's 8th Battalion and an artillery battery as the core. They would first proceed to Sihui, then go up the Sui River to take over Guangning and Huaiji—the Ming garrison troops originally stationed in these two places had already scattered, and social order had fallen into chaos.

After occupying Huaiji, they would split their forces to advance on Lianzhou, using both suppression and pacification to trap the Yao armed forces as quickly as possible, preventing them from spreading to the neighbors and allying with bandit gangs.

According to the General Staff's deduction, the Yao armed forces could possibly head west—going south to Wuzhou to merge with the Yao people in Guangxi; or east to Ruyuan to instigate local Yao uprisings, which would directly affect the flank of the Central Route Army; or advance toward the West River to instigate the Yao people in Luoding to rise up.

If the Lianshan Yao people wanted to go west down to Wuzhou, they would either take the route west through Hezhou or go south through Huaiji. Hezhou was garrisoned by Guangxi Ming troops; although the government troops were happy to see the Yao people rebelling in Guangdong, they would not let them pass through. Huaiji was their inevitable route down to Wuzhou. Moreover, the Sui River, which flows through Huaiji, Guangning, and Sihui, originates in Lianshan. The detachment could advance to conquer Huaiji and strike directly at Lianshan, or retreat to hold Guangning relying on the Sui River and Sihui. They could also coordinate with the Central Route Army in Qingyuan. If things changed, they could rush back to Zhaoqing in a few days by sailing downstream.

"For this operation, it is thirty percent military and seventy percent political," Zhu Mingxia spoke after the staff officer finished reporting the combat plan. "Especially you gentlemen of the National Army. After arriving at your stations, you must do your utmost to cooperate with the work of our cadres. You must not only suppress bandits but also gather the hearts of the people. As for specific work, listen to the arrangements of the local cadres after arriving at the station—obey their leadership!"

Just as Zhu Mingxia was holding the combat meeting for the officers, in another building in Zhaoqing, Huang Chao had just crawled out of bed. He had only arrived in Guangzhou from Hainan a few days ago. He had been terribly seasick along the way, eating almost nothing, and was practically carried into the Guangzhou Municipal Government Guesthouse. Before he could have a good rest, he boarded a ship to Zhaoqing the next day.

"No matter how bad the Eight Row Yao are making things, at least let me catch my breath..." Huang Chao had complained to Wen Desi, who came to see him off to his "new post," before boarding the ship.

"Don't you claim to have researched the Ming Dynasty Yao problem? When you were the County Director in Lingshui, your 'Li Pacification' results were quite good. The situation is very tense now," Wen Desi didn't offer pleasantries but spoke directly. "The Eight Row Yao in Lianzhou are making a big fuss. These problems cannot be completely solved by force alone; a two-pronged approach of military and administration is needed. The Senate is not at ease assigning a naturalized citizen county magistrate, and neither am I."

So Huang Chao got on the boat like this—speaking of which, he was "burdened by his reputation," and could blame no one else.

Huang Chao, before D-Day, was a finance graduate from a certain university of finance and economics. After graduation, he worked as a civil servant in a township for a few years. Later, unwilling to accept the boredom of township life, he signed up for the transmigration and became a member of the transmigrators. After D-Day, because Huang Chao's parents ran a medium-sized chicken farm in the old timeline and Huang Chao had helped at home since childhood, he was considered familiar with the poultry business. Thus, he was temporarily assigned to the Agriculture Department, responsible for looking after the few poultry brought from the old timeline.

After staying in the Agriculture Department for a while and getting bored, he caught the wave of external assignments and was transferred to serve as the Director of the Lingshui County Office. He became the "County Magistrate."

In Lingshui County, there were very few Han Chinese, with a registered population of only a few thousand; most residents were Li people. To achieve anything in Lingshui County, "Pacifying the Li" was an unavoidable hurdle.

Huang Chao had been a township civil servant and knew the grassroots situation like the back of his hand. He was also a person who loved learning. He cram-read a lot of relevant books, checked a lot of materials in the Great Library, and started a sideline in policy research and strategic studies. He published several articles such as "Research on Hainan Li People," "A Brief Talk on Lingshui Governance Experience," "Research on Liangguang Local-Guest Relations," "Research on Ming Dynasty Yao Disturbances," and "Research and Countermeasures on Liangguang Ethnic Problems," acting like the Senate's ethnic issues expert.

Relying on the methods he learned as a township civil servant and the accumulation of hundreds of years of data, plus the cooperation of a small but combat-capable garrison and missionary personnel sent by the New Taoism and Jesuit groups, his governance in Lingshui was impressive, and he carried out a lot of construction. He suddenly made a name for himself in the majestic Administration Council. He was considered an "administrative talent proficient in ethnic issues."

Such a talent naturally couldn't work in the basically stable rear area of Hainan. Once the plan for the Mainland Campaign was passed, he was transferred back to Lingao on the grounds of training cadres for the Northward Detachment—of course, he knew this was just an excuse. Nine times out of ten, the Administration Council would transfer him to Guangdong to serve as a local official. The Yao power in Ming Dynasty Guangdong was enormous; the advance of the Fubo Army couldn't fail to trigger a chain reaction.

Sure enough.

The day after the news of the Eight Row Yao uprising reached Lingao, Huang Chao and his wife Huang Su both took leave and took their son out for a picnic, playing until dark before returning home. Upon arriving home, they found a naturalized cadre from the Organization Department had been waiting in front of his house for most of the day.

"The head of the Organization Department asks you to report to the Department early tomorrow morning! There is a new appointment."

The next day, he received the new appointment at the Organization Department: Lianzhou Administrative Commissioner.

At this moment, this Lianzhou Administrative Commissioner had not yet recovered from fatigue. Large ships made him seasick, but what about small boats? They were also suffocatingly uncomfortable—because of the need to save time, he rode on an upstream patrolling *Dafa* gunboat. Not only did it not stop along the way, but to prevent possible attacks, he had to stay in the cabin for a long time, having enough of the engine noise and the smell of coal smoke.

"How is it? Do you feel any better?" With a greeting, the door was pushed open. A senior Fubo Army officer entered—it was Bei Wei.

"Okay, okay." Huang Chao waved his hand weakly. "This journey was pure torture."

"Have a glass of energy drink." Bei Wei signaled the orderly to bring tea.

"I won't drink that stuff—it's coca water. It feels good going down, but drink too much and you get addicted." Huang Chao picked up the teapot on the table and drank several cups in one breath, feeling his head was less dizzy.
"You came to find me in such a hurry not to ask about my health, right?"

"Haha, concern between comrades is normal." Bei Wei sat down. "You are about to take office soon. Old Zhu will also launch an attack on Lianzhou soon—you are both the parent official of Lianzhou and an expert on ethnic issues, so I want to talk to you specifically about the current Yao disturbance problem."

"I've read Xu Ke's report. I think his analysis is already very much in place."

"Now it's not just a Lianzhou problem. You know that after the Defense of Yao East and West Mountains Assistant Regional Commander withdrew, the troop strength in Luoding Prefecture is empty, and there have already been cases of Yao people descending the mountains to plunder villages. We received intelligence that someone is linking up among the Yao people in Luoding, seemingly trying to incite the Yao people to launch a riot, but there is no definite evidence for the time being." Bei Wei said very seriously, "And you have seen our combat plan: the main force is placed north of the West River, advancing to Lianzhou to suppress the Yao disturbance—if the Yao people in Luoding rise up in riot, we will be attacked from front and rear, which will be very passive. There is also the issue of smooth navigation on the West River; once Luoding Prefecture is in chaos, the West River channel will inevitably be greatly affected. So some people suggest we take preemptive action against the Yao people in Luoding—you are the expert in this area, I want to hear your opinion."

Huang Chao was instantly dazed. Not that he didn't know—he had studied the Yao monitor problem in Liangguang and had his own judgment on the situation in Luoding—but once this judgment was spoken, it would inevitably affect the South China Army's military deployment and operational strategy. If something went wrong, it wouldn't be a joke.
