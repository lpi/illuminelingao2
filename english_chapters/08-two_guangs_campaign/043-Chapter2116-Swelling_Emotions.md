# Chapter 2116 - Swelling Emotions

This kind of change was partly due to the "spy" that the intelligence officers had mentioned, and partly evidence that the high officials and generals in charge were not all incompetents.

Who would have thought Xiong Wencan had such ability? Zhu Mingxia mused.

He had originally felt no particular interest in capturing Xiong Wencan. Now, suddenly, he found himself wanting to take Xiong Wencan alive and exchange views—to see how this top-tier figure of seventeenth-century China perceived the Council of Elders.

Over the years, the Elders had encountered many natives of this time-space, but most were common folk from the lower strata. High officials and intellectuals were exceedingly rare. Though Zhao Yingong had connected with the Revival Society in Hangzhou, his relationships with those gentlemen had always been superficial. Even with considerable behind-the-scenes collaboration, personal ties had never deepened much—an Elder simply couldn't truly integrate into that circle.

After Gao Shunqin was kidnapped and brought to Lingao, he had been kept under house arrest for years. The Elders treated him as a living specimen for understanding the mindset of traditional high-ranking Ming officials; all conversations with him were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed in detail.

But Gao Shunqin was merely a regional inspector. He was on an entirely different level from a provincial viceroy like Xiong Wencan. Though Xiong Wencan had been much maligned by later historians, he was by any measure one of the capable officials of the late Ming. What such a man thought of the Council of Elders was a question that both the External Intelligence Bureau and the Grand Library found intriguing.

Zhu Mingxia couldn't help recalling what a certain county office director had said to him during the Qiongnan campaign.

"Battalion Commander Zhu, have you seen BBC's *Walking with Cavemen*? At the end of the last episode, the presenter holds a sapiens infant and says: 'If I took her back to modern society and raised her as my daughter, psychologically and physiologically she would be indistinguishable from my biological daughter.' The difference between us and the natives isn't the difference between sapiens and apes, or between sapiens and Neanderthals. It's the difference between modern people after centuries of scientific and social development and their ancient counterparts. We can look down on and mock their backwardness, not because we're smarter, but because we stand on the accumulated knowledge of centuries of human scientific explosion. Many people think that with a few centuries of accumulated advantages, they can easily lord it over everyone. But being the masters isn't so simple. The natives aren't apes—they learn too. Sometimes we have to learn from them. In fact, right now, we're living off inherited capital, using the achievements of our predecessors to dress ourselves up, without any real innovation or development. And many people can't even be bothered to copy properly—they just muddle through, imagining they're invincible. This sort of complacency is dangerous. Sooner or later, it will catch up with us."

Since the start of the Two Guangs campaign, Zhu Mingxia had come to appreciate those words more deeply. The enemy was learning. Their methods might be clumsy, but they were still causing the Fubo Army considerable trouble. Meanwhile, too many of his own people were growing complacent. He thought of the many proposals for upgraded weapons that had been rejected, and felt a twinge of frustration. But then, considering the army's consumption rates, he conceded that the State Council's decisions weren't entirely without merit.

Perhaps more challenging battles would be better for the force's development. Zhu Mingxia sensed that the Council of Elders had developed a strange overconfidence about war. Many people seemed to think that commanding troops was like playing *Age of Empires*—as long as your technology was a few ages ahead, you didn't need to worry; victory came easily and without casualties.

It had reached the point where not just significant casualties, but even minor setbacks in operations would prompt Elders on the BBS to demand investigations, claiming "incompetent command." Some even went from questioning the capabilities of naturalized officers to doubting the command abilities of Elder officers themselves.

This perfectionist attitude toward war—holding "inquiry meetings" and "hearings" over trifles—had generated considerable backlash among the Fubo Army's officer corps. Elder officers were openly displeased; naturalized officers grumbled in private, saying the bosses "didn't know the cost of running a household" and were "picking nits."

Zhu Mingxia knew well that war involved too many uncontrollable factors. No battle ever went one hundred percent according to plan. Even in this time-space, where they enjoyed absolute technical and organizational superiority and won virtually every engagement with minimal losses, every after-action review still uncovered oversights and failures of execution.

"Fight by the plan, zero casualties, win every time—that's asking too much," Zhu Mingxia muttered to himself.

"What are you saying?" Xu Ke happened to walk over and ask.

"Nothing." Zhu Mingxia coughed. "What did the survey find?"

"Old Xiong really shelled out!" Xu Ke's voice was emphatic. "Preliminary count of abandoned Nanyang rifles on the battlefield: fifty-one. Adding those we didn't find and those the routed troops took, this force had at least a hundred Nanyang rifles. We found plenty of ammunition on the bodies too—estimate at least forty rounds per man."

"Any other discoveries?"

"Nothing else critical." Xu Ke lit a cigar. "You can see the Ming have made progress."

"I agree." Zhu Mingxia nodded. "They fought with discipline."

"The intelligence about a spy seems more and more likely." Xu Ke said. "Whoever it is probably served in our forces. Look at these trench constructions—no one could dig like this without our training. And positioning enfilade fire points at the ends of communication trenches? That's professional."

"But we have no reports of missing officers."

"Maybe a soldier or NCO." Xu Ke said. "Could also be someone who faked his death. The battlefield is full of surprises—you can't have one hundred percent certainty about everything."

"You're right." Zhu Mingxia was silent for a moment. "It looks like the enemy is getting stronger..."

"If you ask me, a stronger enemy is a good thing. Right now the troops are winning too easily. Fight only counterinsurgency campaigns, and an army will degrade." Xu Ke said. "Think about it—how many years has it been since the army fought a real, formal battle with major formations?"

"Not since Shandong have we had a proper fight." Zhu Mingxia understood his meaning. Years of technologically lopsided counterinsurgency were actually harmful to combat readiness.

"So a bit more complexity, more difficulty, even more casualties—I think it's acceptable. We might even deliberately execute more complex tactical and operational maneuvers. Some might call it overkill, but I'd say it's worth it—consider it a live-fire exercise."

Zhu Mingxia laughed. He hadn't expected Xu Ke, a naval intelligence officer by background, to share so many of his views. He nodded. "You're right."

He recalled that Xu Ke had been quite marginalized among the Elders. In the past, some policy disagreements had left him ostracized by many Elders. Though he had landed his preferred military intelligence work—nominally the director of the General Staff's Military Intelligence Bureau—in practice he was little more than a one-man band running a paper company. Much of the actual work was done by the External Intelligence Bureau. Among the Elders, he was an obscure figure.

Still, his work was solid. Key point: every operation, Xu Ke was on the front line. From pre-battle intelligence preparation to post-battle battlefield surveys and prisoner interrogation, he participated whenever possible.

But this line of work rarely earned honors. If something went wrong, though, you'd quickly find yourself under fire—such was the nature of secret work.

"You really have the patience for this job," Zhu Mingxia couldn't help saying. "Not much glory, but plenty of opportunities to get criticized."

"The *I Ching* says, 'The dragon lies hidden—do not act.' This is my time to keep a low profile. The organization will remember me. Some people just love to blow hot air, especially the so-called 'soy sauce faction'—always pointing fingers at things that don't concern them while accomplishing nothing themselves. I'm not afraid to offend anyone. Many of those people were going nowhere in the old time-space. Do you think crossing over suddenly made them successful? Hardly! I've worked in institutions; I've noticed that in every workplace, the people with no future are always the ones who love to gossip. They're always talking about others' shortcomings, never realizing that anyone who actually does things will make mistakes. They were so afraid of making mistakes in the old time-space, so timid, that of course they got nowhere. They brought that mindset here, so no wonder they're still irrelevant. Look at those who dared to take the lead—haven't they all risen to positions of real power?"

Inside Wuzhou, though it was already deep night, the city was extremely tense. The fall of Bangshan meant that another major route out of Wuzhou—the Gui River—was now cut off. The roads to Hexian, Zhongshan, and Mengshan were severed. The Ming forces had already occupied Changzhou Island on the Xi River waterway. Now the garrison in Wuzhou was trapped.

At this moment, the garrison and minor officials in the city were in a state of utter panic. Wuzhou's garrison was not large—ever since the scorched-earth plan had been finalized, the elite forces including the Dongxi Mountain Regional Commander and the Central Route Deputy had withdrawn to Tengxian and Hexian.

The daytime bombardment and the fall of Bangshan both signaled that Wuzhou could not hold. Though night had fallen, officials, clerks, and soldiers were busy packing their belongings, ready to flee. Order in the city was on the verge of collapse; from time to time came the clamor of rioting soldiers and the wailing of civilians.

Yet amid this besieged, precarious Wuzhou, Xiong Wencan felt no panic. The fall of Bangshan was entirely within his expectations. The scorched-earth plan was already prepared. He still had several hundred elite guards at hand, enough to cover his escape by land. The grain and valuables in the city had largely been shipped out; the main forces had left Wuzhou. At this point, how many officials and civilians remained in the city was of little consequence to the bigger picture.
