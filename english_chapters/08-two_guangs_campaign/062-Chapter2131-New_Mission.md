# Chapter 2131 - New Mission

Xu Ke nodded: A-Tao had once been pawned off to someone as a concubine. This was not a glorious thing. Returning to a hometown full of acquaintances, it was inevitable that someone would bring up old matters, which would be embarrassing.

"I still want to stay in Wuzhou and continue working for the Senate," Luo Yangming said. "I have done business and lived here for many years, and Wuzhou can be considered my second hometown. I have grasped a lot of local situations and know people well. As for whether to arrange for me to do public work or continue opening a rice shop, I will listen to the Chief's arrangement."

Xu Ke nodded and said, "Since your identity in Wuzhou has not been exposed, then continue to stay undercover and continue serving the Senate as a rice shop manager."

Luo Yangming nodded: "Yes!" He thought for a moment and said with some worry, "It's just that a lot of the rice shop's inventory was forcibly requisitioned by the government office, and the shop has suffered great losses..."

"This rice shop was opened with funding from the Intelligence Bureau, right?"

"Exactly."

"I recall that the Intelligence Bureau didn't give you any more operational funds later on. For all these years, you have been operating with this capital to reach the current situation."

"It is all thanks to the vast fortune of the Senate..."

"Fortune or not, let's not discuss that for now. You used the wealth generated by this shop to conduct intelligence activities, which was a matter of course. Therefore, the Bureau will not fuss about profits and losses with you—of course, it's best not to lose the principal." Xu Ke smiled and patted him on the shoulder: "Don't worry, the Senate won't be that nitpicky. An upright body does not fear a slanted shadow. If you act uprightly, you will naturally stand firm."

"Yes, thank you for your understanding, Chief."

"Do you have difficulties continuing operations now?" Xu Ke asked. "Raise them, and I will try my best to arrange a solution."

"Yes, but I can handle it for the time being," Luo Yangming said.

Xu Ke nodded and gave him an envelope.

"The specific contact methods are in this envelope," he said seriously. "From now on, you are under the dual leadership of the 'Center' and the 'Political Security Bureau.' But this doesn't matter; your work remains the same: collecting intelligence."

Specifically, he transferred from being an "intelligence agent" of the External Intelligence Bureau to a "hidden cadre" of the Political Security Bureau. The reason for the "dual leadership" was mainly considering that Wuzhou was still a "frontline city," and intelligence work against the enemy was still heavy. Therefore, he had to monitor the situation inside the city and also pay attention to collecting intelligence transiting between the Great Ming ruling area and the Yao area.

When Luo Yangming returned to the city, it was already noon. His stomach was very hungry, but his mood was very happy, as if the pent-up feelings of many years had dissipated. Especially Chief Xu's comment today that "your contribution to Wuzhou will be remembered and praised by people even decades or centuries later" made him spiritually invigorated. The Chiefs often said: "Serve the Senate and the People." In the past, he couldn't fully understand why "the People" had to be added. Now he fully understood: if conquering Wuzhou was only expanding territory for the Senate, then his utmost efforts to save Wuzhou from the disaster of Zhurong (fire) was truly "serving the People."

Walking along, Luo Yangming saw that order inside and outside the city had been roughly restored. Fubo Army soldiers, local yamen runners, and militia squads patrolling the streets. Porridge sheds had also been set up in front of several temples and government offices to supply porridge and boiling water to refugees. Some commoners had already started cleaning up the ruins of their own homes. Although shops hadn't opened yet, the originally tense and terrifying atmosphere in the city had been swept away.

When he returned home, the whole family, including Wen Tietou, was looking forward to his return. Seeing him return safely, they all breathed a sigh of relief. His wife and concubine hurriedly came up to dust off his clothes and fetch face-washing water. Looking closely, there were tear stains on both their faces. Luo Yangming felt a warmth in his heart and smiled, "I didn't go to a tiger's den or a wolf's lair, why worry like this?"

Seeing his relaxed expression and smiling face, everyone knew that his meeting with the "Bandit Runts" went smoothly and there was no disaster. A stone was finally completely put down. Wen Tietou said, "Master! Just now the Rehabilitation Bureau sent someone over, saying there's a meeting at the Military Control Commission after lunch. I told him the Master was called away by the Bandit... Australians, and didn't know if you could get there in time..."

Ding A-Tao worriedly said, "Having just gone, and having to go again, I don't know what medicine they are selling in the gourd..."

"It doesn't matter," Luo Yangming drank the tea brought by his concubine. "This is also expected, after all, I count as a member of the Rehabilitation Bureau."

"In my opinion, the master might as well resign from this errand. We are not big businesses like Master Qiao; what good is there in getting mixed up in this? The Australians will definitely conscript labor and grain. These are all difficult errands that can't be done without acting against one's conscience—offending people." Ding A-Tao supervised the maid to bring up the food, personally served him rice, brought it over, and persuaded him.

Luo Yangming smiled, took the rice bowl, and started eating. Seeing the "Mistress" stop talking, Wen Tietou spoke up, "Madam shouldn't say that. The directors in this Rehabilitation Bureau are all seasoned, shrewd people. The Master is just following along to handle things. If the sky falls, there are these tall ones to hold it up; what is the Master afraid of? Besides, this Rehabilitation Bureau is government-run. Don't look at the Master as just a small Bureau Director; he is also a semi-official figure now. With an official label, what business isn't easy to do?"

Ding A-Tao said, "For small families like ours, it's best to dutifully guard this family property and live our days—speaking of which, this time can be counted as facing a calamity..."

She felt heartache over the several hundred *dan* of rice forcibly requisitioned by the government office. Luo Yangming said, "Those several hundred *dan* of rice are gone, so be it. Fortunately, our whole family is safe and sound. Wealth goes, person stays happy! By the way, is Shopkeeper Li back?"

He thought of Li Wensheng, whom he hadn't heard from since he left the city. However, since Chief Xu specifically called him to meet, it was likely he had arrived safely outside the city.

"He's back," Ding A-Tao said. "He's an old man. After tossing and turning all night, he was tired and sleepy. I let him go back to his room to rest—he's probably still sleeping right now."

"Let him rest. Shopkeeper Li this time is..." Luo Yangming was excited for a moment and blurted out, but suddenly realized this was inappropriate. Not only could he not casually talk about sending Li Wensheng to contact the Chiefs, but Li Wensheng himself also needed to unify his story with him.

seeing him stop halfway, everyone was puzzled. Wen Tietou had many thoughts. Thinking of driving the commoners out of the city the night before the city fell, Li Wensheng clearly could have hidden in the shop but inexplicably followed the refugees out of the city—there must be something strange here.

Luo Yangming didn't say much more. After lunch, he got up and went to the Military Control Commission. A-Tao was worried and told Wen Tietou to follow along. Luo Yangming waved his hand: "It's useless for him to follow—besides, he has a gang of brothers at the docks who need taking care of. It's better to let him go back quickly." After saying that, he called the accountant and issued rice tokens for several hundred *jin* of rice to Wen Tietou:

"The shop just suffered from officials and bandits, and can't maneuver much for a while. You go distribute this rice to the brothers for now; let them cope for a moment."

Wen Tietou was overjoyed. He was a small foreman on the docks. According to the rules, he had to take care of the food and clothing of his brothers. Originally, he wanted to ask his "brother-in-law" for help, but since his "brother-in-law's" shop also suffered great losses this time due to the war disaster, and he wasn't a real "brother-in-law," he found it difficult to open his mouth. Immediately he said, "Thank you, Master, for the help! This rice, consider it borrowed by me. When the market improves, I will return it all at once!"

"We are all relatives, no need to be polite." Luo Yangming saw his wife was very reluctant, knowing she felt heartache over the money, but he had no intention to comfort her now and went straight out the door to the Prefectural Yamen.

The directors of the Rehabilitation Bureau had already gathered in the conference room of the Wuzhou District Military Control Commission—the former flower hall of the Prefectural Yamen.

This was originally the place where the prefect met guests and held banquets. The directors were mostly local "village worthies" and were naturally familiar with this place.

Originally, although the decoration and furniture of the flower hall couldn't be counted as magnificent, they were quite graceful and elegant. Right now, it was a mess: in yesterday's chaos, some rogue soldiers rushed into various government offices to loot, and the Prefectural Yamen was not spared. Calligraphy, paintings, displays, furniture, and chairs were all swept away or destroyed. Even several window shutters were broken, and many messy knife marks were left on the pillars.

The chairs in the conference room right now were temporarily scraped together, appearing disorganized. Even the tea bowls and cups didn't match in color. Luo Yangming noticed that three large maps were hanging on the wall: the Wuzhou District Map, the Cangwu County Map, and the Wuzhou City Map. He couldn't help but feel particularly affectionate—he was responsible for secretly receiving and arranging the staff who came to survey and map back then.

As for the other directors, they naturally couldn't understand the mysteries of these maps. However, it secretly surprised them that the Australians, who were newcomers, already knew the situation of Wuzhou Prefecture like the backs of their hands.

The newly appointed "Great Song Wuzhou Prefect" was a young man—according to the standards of Great Ming officials and gentry, Australians, whether "True Bandits" or "False Bandits," could be counted as young men.

Xie Erren first introduced himself, and then a local surrendered petty official introduced the directors of the Rehabilitation Bureau one by one.

The directors of the Rehabilitation Bureau were mostly big merchants of Wuzhou. Some were rice merchants, and the other part were "Pingma Hong" (Weighing and Commission Firms).

This Pingma Hong was actually a brokerage house. However, Wuzhou's Pingma Hong was slightly different from brokerage merchants in other places who "ate the seller and then ate the buyer" and relied on brokerage licenses to act wildly and oppress traveling merchants—it was more of an "agency" nature.

This commercial form was related to Wuzhou's geographical environment. Wuzhou was located at the confluence of the West River and Gui River. The distribution of native products inside and outside the province was frequently carried out in bulk transactions in Wuzhou. Whether it was grain transported from Guangxi or salt transported from Guangdong, most trade settlements were made in Wuzhou. This gave rise to a kind of Pingma Hong that specialized in buying and selling on behalf of customers and relied on commission income to serve merchants from the upper and lower rivers.

Pingma Hong mainly accepted the entrustment of the incoming goods party to sell native products on their behalf at market prices, and also purchased native products on behalf of the purchasing party locally. In order to show the honesty of the intermediary, fair trading, and mutual satisfaction, like using a balance scale for silver without deviation, they were called Pingma Hong.
