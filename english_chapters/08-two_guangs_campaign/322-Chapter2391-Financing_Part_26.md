# Chapter 2391: Financing (Part 26)

Cheng Dong thought this wasn't right. This way, what was the point of the Guangzhou Exchange? Wouldn't all transactions be absorbed by the black market? He said: "If that's the case, it won't be good for the Guangzhou Exchange's development."

In the meeting hall, the finance sector crowd whispered among themselves. Ren Youzi hurried out to explain:

"Everyone can rest assured about this. Our intention is also not to let black market trading run wild. At first, we'll set up teahouses around the exchange, providing venues for traders to negotiate and aggregate information. Let them gather around the Guangzhou Exchange from the start. By the third public offering, it will become registered stock. Dividend distribution will be based on registration, and trade transfers must be conducted at the exchange. Additionally, we suggest minimizing stamp duty and transfer fees at the beginning to cultivate their habit of trading at the exchange."

Meng Xian expressed confusion: "Then why are the first and second phases bearer shares? Wouldn't it be better to standardize transfers through formal institutions from the start?"

Chu He almost laughed out loud. Formal institutions—he was just short of saying Delong Bank outright. Looks like Meng Xian not only wanted to eat the issuance fees but also had ideas about transaction fees. Really treating himself as a securities broker.

Of course, there would definitely be securities brokers in the future, but this broker couldn't be given to Delong to run. At most, Delong would just be one of the shareholders.

Before he could speak, Ren Youzi immediately came out to vaguely decline: "We can study this further. I think the first two phases aren't large in volume. It won't have much impact either way."

"You don't need to worry about stamp duty," Ai Zhixin said leisurely with a calm attitude. "At this stage, we're not counting on the securities market to support finances through taxes and fees. Our opinion is: stamp duty involving securities trading should exist, but for now, collection is temporarily suspended, with a buffer period of several years. The goal is to provide good service, release water to raise fish, set the items first, and resume collection when adjustment of the stock market is needed in the future. Also, I think the Guangzhou Exchange should first do well as a trading intermediary and registration office. When others negotiate transactions, we serve as witnesses and collect a brokerage fee. A 0.3% or 0.2% brokerage fee is just a handling fee, isn't it?"

Cheng Dong expressed agreement: "I also agree with Director Ai's thinking. However, since there are no securities brokers at this stage, we don't need to collect transaction handling fees. In the future, if business is conducted in other regions, it won't be too late to collect when trading through Delong. The exchange should initially only be responsible for trade intermediation and registration transfer. Let's first collect a 0.2% intermediary fee and see how it goes. As for registration fees, one yuan each time, with account opening fees calculated separately. Just have your Nanyang Company do the market maker business off-exchange. We'll cooperate by publishing guidance prices. When the third issuance comes, then establish the whole set of systems for commissioned quotes, matched transactions, and so on. What do you all think?"

Chu He heard this and thought Cheng Dong's plan was excellent. First, it gave the Guangzhou Exchange preparation time to establish trading systems without delaying the Nanyang Company's first and second phase financing. Second, it separated the Guangzhou Exchange from the riskiest part of the entire financing scheme—the stock price manipulation—so if anything happened, it would mainly be the Nanyang Company's responsibility.

No matter what, if problems arose, they couldn't be directly implicated to the Senate's official head.

Zhou Wei looked around at all the Senators' attitudes, which were now clear in his mind. So he said: "This thinking is good. Our Nanyang Company supports proceeding according to this plan. I suggest we immediately begin stock issuance to individual Senators, while also letting word out to prepare public opinion for the next phase's first bond issuance to natives. Senator Meng, Senator Ding, what do you think?"

Meng Xian immediately said: "No problem. Serving the Senate is Delong's duty, it's just this underwriting fee issue..."

Zhou Wei smiled stiffly: "Ah... we can discuss that."

Chu He was in great spirits these days. The Nanyang Company financing case was officially approved, and along with it, the proposal to establish the Guangzhou Securities Exchange had been approved. Based on the current situation, he and Ren Youzi would very likely be responsible for this work. Because the day before, Cheng Dong had privately talked to him, inquiring about his views and suggestions on the project. You could say it was 80-90% certain that he and Old Ren would get this project.

However, according to Cheng Dong's plan, although the securities exchange would have dedicated personnel in charge, they would also need to take on some other finance sector work—in fact, for quite a long time to come, this side job would be the main business. That is, Old Ren would have to continue doing his auditing—soon he would be promoted to director of the "Cheka" Guangzhou branch. As for his own work, although not officially announced, Cheng Dong had clearly told him: it had already been processed through the Organization Department to transfer his affiliation from the education department back to the finance department.

"...As for specifically what your side job will be, we still need to discuss. Of course, you can also propose your own ideas. Currently, both the Central Reserve Bank and Delong urgently need professional Senator cadres like you to serve..."

"I'll follow the leadership's arrangements." Chu He immediately stated his position. "Specific side jobs can be arranged based on my expertise."

"That's good." Cheng Dong didn't say what specific work would be arranged. "Since that's the case, wait for the Organization Department's notification. As for your exchange's specific work arrangements, you and Old Ren can coordinate among yourselves. The exchange's location—Liu Xiang's opinion is to still arrange it at the Great World side. After all, our customers are mainly Guangzhou citizens."

Since things were basically settled, Chu He decided there was no time to waste. He should first talk to Ren Youzi, for both sides to share their thoughts on future exchange work. After all, they would be work partners from now on. A good cooperative relationship needed to be established.

He immediately had Little Piao go find Senator Ren, but unexpectedly Senator Ren came looking for him.

"Chu He!" Ren Youzi also had a "spirits lifted by happy events" appearance. The face that had always been overcast and made various Senators and naturalized cadres cringe at the sight actually had a smile on it.

"Old Ren! Was just about to send someone to find you..."

"Don't bother, I also have something to find you about." Ren Youzi sat down by the small conference table with a plop, taking a document from his briefcase.

"Take a look. This is the basic charter and structure I drafted for the Guangzhou Securities Exchange. It's fairly simple. Take a look and give your opinions."

Chu He opened it and saw the beginning was a standard eight-legged essay:

"To resolve the contradiction between capital supply and demand and liquidity, a securities market will naturally emerge. The securities exchange will solve the docking problem of fundraising and investment through securities issuance and trading as the implementation method, thereby resolving the contradiction between capital supply and demand and capital structure adjustment issues. The Guangzhou Securities Exchange, as a profit-making corporatized tangible centralized trading market, starting from the actual situation of the year, will integrate functions of registration and settlement, issuance approval, trade organization, and self-regulation, committed to providing capital market services for various enterprises..."

Did you just take an old document and replace some words? Chu He silently complained.

He continued reading. Below were five major functions listed: standardized governance, stock transfer, value discovery, direct financing, and credit enhancement. The specific wording was basically all old routines, nothing new. Chu He just skimmed through.

More important was the exchange setup below:

"...The exchange has 17 internal departments, namely: Board of Directors Office, Supervisory Board Office, Discipline Inspection Office, General Office, Trading Department, Settlement Department, Surveillance Department, Legal Department, Issuance Department, Registration Department (preparatory), Finance Department, Internal Audit Department, Human Resources Department, Equity Business Department, Debt Business Department, Innovation Business Department (preparatory), and Administrative Center..."

"I wonder if Cheng Dong has talked to him and told him this newly established securities exchange only has us two 'full-time' staff members." Chu He thought, this configuration is way too luxurious.

Complaining aside, the setup itself was quite methodical, properly done step by step. It's just that there was no possibility of implementation at present—it could only count as a "long-term plan."

Next were the conditions for listing on the securities exchange, six items total, no different from the old spacetime. Then came the listing process, which Chu He was more concerned about because this was the work to be done immediately.

"...Sponsor securities firm prepares materials and submits to the issuance review committee for review - after approval, receive approval document - disclose prospectus - public inquiry - disclose issuance announcement - pricing issuance - collect funds, arrival processing, share registration, apply for listing - listing committee review - disclose listing announcement - listing. All investors who successfully purchase stocks will receive physical stock certificates on the listing day (refer to paper currency printing and anti-counterfeiting standards)..."

"Old Ren, your plan is good, very professional!" Chu He first fully affirmed it, then unsurprisingly came a "but..."

"Hey, hey, hey, you don't need to say it, I understand what you mean. This plan is empty talk, right?"

"No, no, don't put labels on yourself." Chu He thought this smooth operator wasn't easy to deal with.

"I know what you mean," Ren Youzi said. "It's just that we don't have these conditions right now. Don't worry, I'm not saying this plan needs to be implemented immediately either—that's obviously impossible."

"That's good, that's good." Chu He nodded repeatedly.

Ren Youzi continued: "What exchanges solve is the pricing problem. The actual fundraising operation is still conducted off-exchange. The earliest exchanges were either taverns and coffee houses, or under big trees—just places for negotiating business. Actually, ancient China had similar trading sayings too, like for buying and selling bulk goods and livestock, most business was talked about in teahouses. Stocks, bonds, these things, sound fancy, but essentially there's not much difference. So, we don't need to apply old spacetime exchanges to before. The Senate doesn't need an exchange with such complex functions at all."

Chu He thought: your plan and what you're saying are two completely different things! After all that, you just plan to make a "long-term plan"?
