# Chapter 2321 - Planning of the Industrial Park

Though the energy department lacked silicon steel, generators with iron cores could still be manufactured—merely with higher energy consumption and lower efficiency. They proved useful in situations where electricity was essential. Steam engines were less efficient, but driving these generators posed no problem.

As for water supply, the north side would receive water diverted from Huoshaopo Reservoir to Liwu Reservoir. The south side would be served by Chunjiang Reservoir, while the main urban area of Danzhou would draw from Beimen River.

Of course, these reservoirs and supporting main and branch canals existed only on paper at present. Fortunately, the overall scale wasn't too large. According to the Planning Commission's calculations, they could be completed within the First Five-Year Plan.

For railways, Danzhou West Station would be established within the industrial park. Though the site selection between Baimajing and Yangpu hadn't been finalized, the general requirement was to penetrate as deep into the industrial park as possible. As a hub station serving the industrial park, the track layout should allow factories to share single-track spurs, with trains running loops between facilities. Danzhou West would connect eastward to Danzhou Station, then extend from there to Lingao and Nanbao, accessing the wider rail network.

...

Naturally, such a magnificent blueprint was more "inspiring" than practical. As for how many projects could actually be realized, and in how many years, neither the chemical industry sector proposing the initiative nor the Planning Commission approving the plan held any real confidence. But both sides maintained a façade of "complete confidence" in public.

Precisely because of these hidden worries, Ji Tuisi approached the project cautiously, afraid of bungling some crucial step. If problems really emerged, the chemical industry sector might as well forget about having any voice in the future—they'd just have to work honestly and keep quiet.

But clearly no one else understood his concerns. People constantly offered commentary on the overall plan. Some felt it was "too conservative" and suggested adding steel plants, timber processing plants, brick and tile factories, and cement plants within the industrial park as supporting facilities. Additionally, light industrial enterprises should be included to absorb workers' family members.

...

"...The last item is also what everyone cares about most. The Government Administration Council has given us a reply, agreeing in principle that our administrative level in the Danzhou Industrial Park Management Committee will be county-level, equal to Danzhou."

"Why not Region-level? At least it should be Deputy Region-level!"

"When Gezhouba and Three Gorges were built, they were deputy ministerial-level units, and the heads of subsidiary companies were bureau-level! The entire Hubei province had to cooperate! Our project's significance to the Senate is greater than the Three Gorges, isn't it? Making it Region-level isn't excessive at all!"

"It's not that we want official hats—if the level is too low, our words won't carry weight!"

"If you ask me, there should be a dedicated Industrial Committee or Joint Conference in the Government Administration Council! One with full authority to handle all industrial matters. Other departments shouldn't be allowed to interfere—they can only cooperate according to our requirements!"

"Whoever dares not to cooperate, cut their water and electricity first, cut their fertilizer and pesticide, cut their shells and explosives. Let's see which department dares to be arrogant in front of us after that!"

"They all say doctors are the most arrogant in the Senate—no one dares claim they won't get sick and fall into a doctor's hands in their lifetime. But without medicine, how can doctors be arrogant?"

"Hahaha..."

...

Ji Tuisi maintained a wooden smile on his face. These weren't remarks he was hearing for the first time. To be honest, casually spouting nonsense in private didn't matter much. But this was a formal "seminar." According to regulations, there had to be "meeting minutes" copied to relevant departments and archived in the Great Library.

He signaled to Xu Yingjie, who was responsible for recording. Xu silently nodded and refrained from writing.

"Everyone, let's not stray further and further off topic." Ji Tuisi waved his hand, reining in the runaway discussion. "A defining feature of modern society is systematic cooperation. We shouldn't overly emphasize the importance of any particular department or individual—it's detrimental to unity."

Someone muttered below: "Unity my ass..."

Ji Tuisi shot him a fierce glare. Fortunately, his remaining authority was enough to make the other party shut up.

"The personnel establishment and staffing of the Management Committee are currently being compiled. However, Ming Lang told me that the allocation of Senator cadres is three: one chief, one deputy, and one chief engineer. A chief to oversee everything, a deputy specifically for external coordination, and a chief engineer specifically responsible for technical issues. His suggestion is that we discuss specific candidates first, then report them according to a two-to-one or three-to-one ratio."

This was to be expected. Despite all the enthusiastic chatter about ranks, when it came to specific administrative positions, there was little enthusiasm. This magnificently named "Management Committee" had numerous and miscellaneous responsibilities, and also required maintaining external coordination with multiple Senate departments. The degree of trouble involved was daunting.

Seeing the group fall silent, Ji Tuisi chuckled to himself. "Since we've reached this point, everyone can discuss it slowly later. Just propose candidates before the specified deadline."

"Why must we follow two-to-one? Wouldn't it be fine if we just recommended someone here?"

"Because of organizational principles, I suppose." Caught off guard by this question, Ji Tuisi answered.

"Why should Ming Lang decide who becomes the head? We decide ourselves and that's it. Why take off one's pants to fart—an utterly unnecessary step?"

Ji Tuisi couldn't immediately think of how to respond. Ever since Ming Lang had become Director of the Organization Department, he had single-handedly created many rules regarding cadre appointment, removal, assessment, and establishment. The Senate had been operating according to these rules for years. Though debates had arisen about details like candidates and position settings, no one had ever questioned the rules themselves.

He thought for a moment, then said: "Since everyone has doubts, we can record this question in the meeting minutes and make an inquiry."

"You don't need to inquire about this, nor find Ming Lang. I can tell you right now." Ma Qianzhu smiled after reading the meeting minutes. "Old Ji, it seems your study of the Common Program is also quite insufficient."

"To be honest, I'm indeed not very interested in these rigid rules," Ji Tuisi said.

"Because any position held by a Senator cadre must go through three steps: 'nomination,' 'Organization Department review and filing,' and 'Senate approval.' Ming Lang actually cannot decide who becomes a leader. The one who ultimately decides the appointed candidate is the Senate."

"I understand now that you've explained it."

"'All power belongs to the Senate' is the core idea of our regime. You are a Senator, I am a Senator, everyone is a Senator. The power of Senators is maintained by all of us jointly." Ma Qianzhu spoke slowly. "Once things are explained clearly, everyone naturally understands. Anyway, these candidates are generated within the industrial sector. Proposing a few more does no harm."

"Then regarding this new plan..." He was asking about increasing construction material enterprises like steel plants and timber plants.

"That's easy to accommodate." Ma Qianzhu nodded. "We all understand building materials. Transport costs exceed production costs. To launch such a large industrial park, these projects are like reservoirs—all early supporting projects. By rights, they should be launched in the first batch. Although not listed in the meeting, they can be added."

Ji Tuisi wondered why Ma Qianzhu was being so agreeable today. Usually, when launching a new project, he'd wear a bitter expression for half the day.

Ma Qianzhu seemed to read his surprise. He smiled and said: "To be honest, the scale is a bit large. I don't know if we can digest it. But not eating won't do either. We are too poor..."

"That's true. It wasn't easy muddling through all these years. I feel the momentum is obviously lagging."

"I originally thought taking Liangguang would give Hainan room to breathe. But looking at the current situation, we were too optimistic. The situation in Liangguang fears it cannot be pacified quickly. This pacification campaign will probably drag on for a year or a year and a half. Guangzhou is staring down an emerging plague... truly burnt head and smashed forehead." He spoke somewhat helplessly. "If we had streptomycin, this plague would be nothing. Now we can only rely on quarantine to resist as best we can. A plague—how many people will be left destitute and homeless? A land and people of many disasters..."

"It's also our first time ruling such a large territory and traditional city. It's inevitable that things won't go smoothly." Ji Tuisi tried to reassure him. "Fortunately, Liangguang is taken. At present, at most it's indigestion—we just need to digest slowly."

"I'm precisely worried about indigestion." Ma Qianzhu picked up a document and handed it to Ji Tuisi. "Look at this matter!"

Ji Tuisi took it and looked. It was the report on the Wuzhou Incident.

He had actually already seen the matter in internal briefings, but what Ma Qianzhu showed him was a top-secret document. It detailed various "stories" of Director Xie in Wuzhou.

"...This, this... too incredible!" Ji Tuisi was shocked after reading. However, it also resolved the doubts he had held after seeing the original Wuzhou Incident report.

"This Old Xie—too unreliable." Ma Qianzhu spoke heavily. "Originally, when he signed up to be a local chief administrator, Prefect Liu said he was unreliable. At the time, I felt that talent was rare, and Senators willing to work in local areas were few. He is actually quite capable. I just said to give him a chance to try. Didn't expect this person to be so unorganized and undisciplined. Getting to today's state—I bear responsibility... a lesson! A lesson..."

Ji Tuisi thought: *What exactly does Ma the Eunuch mean by this heartbroken performance?* He could have simply not shown him this top-secret report. Since he had shown it, there was obviously some intention behind it...

But for the moment, he couldn't figure out Ma Qianzhu's intent, so he didn't immediately state his position, just agreed vaguely: "If things are really as the secret report says, the nature is indeed very serious. How does the Senate plan to handle it now?"

"Ji Xin and Chen Baibin have been sent to investigate. Everyone trusts these two relatively more." Ma Qianzhu said. "As for Xie Erren, Wuzhou is relatively important. Before the matter is investigated clearly, it's not appropriate to make any changes—we need to avoid unsettling morale."

"I completely agree with this point." Ji Tuisi actually had absolutely no interest in getting mixed up in this matter. He cared far more about the industrial park project.
