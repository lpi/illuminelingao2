# Chapter 2321 - Planning of the Industrial Park

Although the energy department lacked silicon steel, generators with iron cores could still be manufactured, merely with higher energy consumption and lower efficiency. They were very useful in occasions where electricity must be used. Steam engines had lower efficiency, but driving these generators was no problem.

As for water supply, the north side supply would be diverted from Huoshaopo Reservoir to Liwu Reservoir. The south side supply would be responsible by Chunjiang Reservoir, while the main urban area of Danzhou would be supplied by Beimen River.

Of course, these reservoirs and supporting main and branch canals were currently on paper. Fortunately, the overall scale was not too large. According to the Planning Commission's calculation, they could be completed within the First Five-Year Plan.

For railways, Danzhou West Station would be established within the industrial park. Although the site selection between Baimajing and Yangpu had not been decided, the general requirement was to penetrate as deep into the industrial park as possible. As a hub station serving the industrial park, the track layout should try to allow factories to share the same single-track spur, with trains running loops between factories. Danzhou West would connect eastward to Danzhou Station, then extend from Danzhou Station to Lingao and Nanbao, accessing the rail network.

...

Naturally, such a magnificent blueprint was more "inspiring." As for how many projects could be realized and in how many years, neither the chemical industry sector proposing the initiative nor the Planning Commission approving the plan had confidence in their hearts. But both sides showed a "full of confidence" attitude in public.

Precisely because of this hidden worry, Ji Tuisi was cautious about this project, afraid of messing up in some link—if problems really occurred, the chemical industry sector shouldn't mention any voice in the future, just work honestly.

But everyone obviously couldn't understand his worry. They constantly commented on the overall plan. Some felt this plan was "too conservative" and suggested adding steel plants, timber processing plants, brick and tile plants, and cement plants in the industrial park as supporting facilities for park construction. Additionally, add some light industrial enterprises to absorb workers' family members.

...

"...The last item is also what everyone cares about most. The Government Administration Council gave us a reply, agreeing in principle that our administrative level in the Danzhou Industrial Park Management Committee is county-level, equal to Danzhou."

"Why not Region-level? At least it should be Deputy Region-level!"

"When Gezhouba and Three Gorges were built, they were deputy ministerial-level units, and the heads of subsidiary companies were bureau-level! The entire Hubei province had to cooperate! Our project's significance to the Senate is greater than the Three Gorges, right? Making it Region-level isn't excessive at all!"

"It's not that we want official hats; if the level is too low, words won't carry weight!"

"If you ask me, there should be a dedicated Industrial Committee or Joint Conference in the Government Administration Council! Handling all industrial matters with full authority. Other departments cannot interfere and can only cooperate according to our requirements!"

"Whoever dares not cooperate, cut water and electricity first, cut fertilizer and pesticide, cut shells and explosives. See which department dares to be arrogant in front of us in the future!"

"They all say doctors are the most arrogant in the Senate—no one dares to say they won't get sick and fall into doctors' hands in their lifetime. But without medicine, how can doctors be arrogant?"

"Hahaha..."

...

Ji Tuisi revealed a dull smile on his face. He hadn't heard these remarks for the first time. To be honest, casually talking nonsense in private didn't matter. But this was a serious "seminar." According to rules, there must be "meeting minutes" copied to relevant departments, and archived in the Great Library.

He signaled Xu Yingjie, who was responsible for recording. Xu silently nodded and didn't write.

"Everyone, don't stray further and further." Ji Tuisi waved his hand, gathering back this runaway divergent discussion. "An important feature of modern society is systematic cooperation. Everyone shouldn't overly highlight the importance of a certain department or person—it's detrimental to unity."

Someone muttered below: "Unity my ass..."

Ji Tuisi glared at him fiercely. Finally, his remaining prestige was still there, making the other party shut up.

"The personnel establishment and staffing of the Management Committee are currently in specific compilation. However, Ming Lang told me that the allocation of Senator cadres is three: one chief, one deputy, and one chief engineer. A chief in charge overall, a deputy specifically for external coordination, and a chief engineer specifically responsible for technical issues. His suggestion is we can discuss specific candidates first. Report candidates according to a two-to-one or three-choose-one ratio."

This was also proper meaning. Don't look at everyone chatting enthusiastically about ranks; when it came to specific administrative positions, there was little enthusiasm. This magnificently named "Management Committee" had many and miscellaneous things to do, and also had to maintain external coordination with multiple departments of the Senate. The degree of trouble was daunting.

Seeing the group silent, Ji Tuisi laughed secretly and said: "Since getting this way, everyone discuss slowly later. Just propose candidates before the specified date."

"Why must we follow two-choose-one? Wouldn't it be fine if we recommended someone here?"

"Because of organizational principles, I suppose." Caught off guard by someone asking this, Ji Tuisi answered.

"Why should Ming Lang decide who becomes the head? We decide ourselves and that's it. Why take off pants to fart—an unnecessary move?"

Ji Tuisi couldn't think of how to answer for a moment. Ever since Ming Lang became the Director of the Organization Department, he single-handedly created many rules regarding cadre appointment, removal, assessment, and establishment. The Senate had been running according to these rules for years. Although there had been debates about details like candidates and position settings, no one had ever questioned the rules themselves.

He thought for a while and said: "Since everyone has doubts, we can record this question in the meeting minutes and make an inquiry."

"You don't need to inquire about this, nor find Ming Lang. I can tell you right now." Ma Qianzhu smiled after reading the meeting minutes. "Old Ji, it seems your study of the Common Program is also very insufficient."

"To be honest, I'm indeed not very interested in these rigid rules," Ji Tuisi said.

"Because any position held by a Senator cadre must go through the three steps of 'nomination' - 'Organization Department review and filing' - 'Senate approval.' Ming Lang actually cannot decide who can be a leader; the one who finally decides the appointed candidate is the Senate."

"I understand with your explanation."

"'All power belongs to the Senate' is the core idea of our regime. You are a Senator, I am a Senator, everyone is a Senator. The power of Senators is maintained by us jointly." Ma Qianzhu said slowly, "Once explained clearly, everyone naturally understands. Anyway, these few candidates are also generated within the industrial sector. Proposing a few more candidates does no harm."

"Then this new plan..." He was asking hoping to increase construction material enterprises like steel plants and timber plants.

"This is easy to say." Ma Qianzhu nodded. "We all understand building materials. Transport costs are greater than production costs. To launch such a big industrial park, these projects are like reservoirs, all early supporting projects. By right, they should be launched in the first batch. Although not listed in the meeting, they can be added."

Ji Tuisi thought, why is Ma Qianzhu so easy to talk to today? Originally, for launching a project, he would have a bitter face for half a day.

Ma Qianzhu seemed to see his surprise, smiled and said: "To be honest, the scale is a bit large. Don't know if we can digest it. But not eating won't do either. We are too poor..."

"That's true. It wasn't easy to muddle through till now all these years. Feel the momentum is obviously lacking."

"Originally thought taking Liangguang would let Hainan breathe a bit. But looking at the current situation, we are too optimistic. The situation in Liangguang fears unable to be pacified in a short time. This security war will probably serve to be fought for a year or a half. Guangzhou is eyeing the start of a plague... really burnt head and smashed forehead." He said somewhat helplessly, "If we had streptomycin, this plague would be nothing. Now, we can only rely on quarantine to resist hard. A plague, how many people will be destitute and homeless—land and people of many disasters..."

"It's also our first time ruling such a large territory and traditional city; it's inevitable not to be smooth." Ji Tuisi persuaded, "Fortunately Liangguang is taken; at present, it's at most indigestion—just digest slowly."

"I'm just worried about indigestion." Ma Qianzhu said, picking up a document and handing it to Ji Tuisi. "Look at this matter!"

Ji Tuisi took it and looked; it was exactly the report on the Wuzhou Incident.

He actually had already seen the matter from internal briefings, but what Ma Qianzhu showed him was a top-secret document. It detailed various "stories" of Director Xie in Wuzhou.

"...This, this... too incredible!" Ji Tuisi was shocked after reading. However, it also solved the doubts he originally had after seeing the Wuzhou Incident report.

"This Old Xie, too unreliable." Ma Qianzhu said heavily, "Originally when he signed up to be a local chief administrator, Prefect Liu said he was unreliable. At that time I felt talent was rare, and Senators willing to work in local areas were few. He is actually quite capable too. Just said give him a chance to try. Didn't expect this person to be unorganized and undisciplined to such a degree. Getting to today's state, I have responsibility... a lesson! A lesson..."

Ji Tuisi thought, what exactly did Ma the Eunuch (nickname for Ma Qianzhu) mean by this heartbroken style? He could have totally not shown him this top-secret report. Since showing him, obviously there was some intention inside...

But for a moment, he couldn't figure out Ma Qianzhu's intention, so he didn't state his position immediately, just agreed vaguely: "If it's really as the secret report says, indeed the nature is very serious. How does the Senate plan to handle it now?"

"Ji Xin and Chen Baibin have been sent to investigate. Everyone trusts these two people relatively more." Ma Qianzhu said, "As for Xie Erren, Wuzhou is relatively important. Before the matter is investigated clearly, it's not suitable to make any changes, to avoid unstable morale."

"I completely agree with this point." Ji Tuisi actually had absolutely no interest in mixing in this matter; he cared more about the industrial park project.
