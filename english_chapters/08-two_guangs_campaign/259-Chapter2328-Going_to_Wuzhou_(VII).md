# Chapter 2328 - Going to Wuzhou (VII)

Chen Baibin looked at the materials on the table. Xie Erren moved very fast, cleaning up all retained personnel who could prove Cai Lan had a special relationship with Xie Erren. Of course, whether Zhao Fengtian, Zheng Ergen, or Luo Yangming, all could prove Cai Lan's existence. But once they gave relevant testimony, it would mean standing on the opposite side of Xie Erren.

Except for Luo Yangming who could receive the protection of the Political Security Bureau, the other two would inevitably struggle in the Senate's cadre system in the future. Chen Baibin had roughly understood Ji Xin's meaning: to protect naturalized cadres.

Who else could prove the special relationship between Cai Lan and Xie Erren? He thought and thought, simply recalling Jiang Qiuchan mentioned in Luo Yangming's report. According to the statement in his report, Jiang Qiuchan also served in the San Zong Fu for a time.

He immediately told Ji Xin this idea.

"Just right," Ji Xin said, "Here is a material just sent by Zheng Ergen, which is the conclusion of their investigation report on the Sanhezui camp." He handed the report to him as he spoke.

Chen Baibin flipped through it roughly. It basically matched the sporadic information about Sanhezui they obtained in interrogation, and confirmed their deduction: Liu Youwang acted illegally, Jiang Yougong aided the tyrant, and Chang Qingyun added fuel to the fire.

But the following content was interesting. Two small ox-horn secret stamp chops were searched out from Jiang Yougong's corpse and Liu Youwang's personal items. After identification and inspection, they were found to be from the Ruijin Tang Silk Shop in Wuzhou city.

Jiang Rongxian, the boss of Ruijin Tang Silk Shop, confessed that these two secret stamp chops were vouchers for the illicit money they obtained from reselling grain and materials from the camp kept at the counter.

"This Liu Youwang really has big guts!" Chen Baibin was startled. Although Chen Baibin had seen quite a few naturalized citizen corruption cases, and there were ones with amounts larger than this, daring to be so lawless and acting willfully while on the front line and in a prisoner camp, this was the first time he saw.

"The one pulling strings was Chang Qingyun, interesting right?"

"Isn't this very normal? Chang Qingyun was Liu Youwang's lackey."

"Chang Qingyun was an outsider, unfamiliar with people and places in Wuzhou—for this kind of private black transaction, even if he knew Ruijin Tang had this strength and went to the door himself, Jiang Rongxian wouldn't dare to accept."

"Then... it was Yi Haoran?!"

"Although we don't have direct evidence, it was likely him. Reading his confession, I feel this Yi Haoran is very ghostly. He confesses whatever aspect we master; if we don't master it, he won't say anything..."

Chen Baibin laughed dryly a few times, thinking *does this need saying! The confession we got was definitely 'processed'.*

"Jiang Rongxian's younger sister is Jiang Qiuchan. For a time Jiang Qiuchan's son was sent to Yi Haoran to study. So Jiang Qiuchan is not only a 'distant vine-tendril relative' with Yi Haoran, but they also trust each other very much. Yi Haoran downplaying the relationship between him and Jiang Qiuchan is problematic in itself."

"So speaking, Jiang Qiuchan is also a key figure."

"Correct." Ji Xin nodded, "Luo Yangming said in the report that Jiang Qiuchan also served in the San Zong Fu. Although what she did specifically is unclear, it likely has to do with Cai Lan."

"Yi Haoran, Chang Qingyun, Jiang Qiuchan, Cai Lan..." Chen Baibin drew a relationship diagram between them on white paper casually, "This is a web!" He lost his voice.

"Correct." Ji Xin nodded, "Yi Haoran sat in the grain shop's accounting room, actually controlling the overall situation through this web—this person is truly a genius!"

"Then this Jiang Qiuchan..."

"Already gone." Ji Xin said lightly, "According to Zheng Ergen's arrest report, Jiang Qiuchan is no longer in Wuzhou now. According to her brother, she took her son back to Teng County more than ten days ago."

"Hehe, didn't go back earlier, didn't go back later, going back at this time, truly very coincidental." Chen Baibin said, "We immediately send a document to Teng County, ask them to arrest Jiang Qiuchan!"

"I already asked Zheng Ergen to send a document to the police station in Teng County, but I highly doubt whether Teng County can find her. The current situation is chaotic, and our regime institutions are very imperfect. She can easily hide by changing her name."

"So, this line is also broken."

"En." Ji Xin remained noncommittal, "Now there is an even stranger thing: according to Jiang Rongxian's confession, three secret stamp chops were carved in total at that time, all handled by Chang Qingyun, so the specific holders are unknown."

"There were three?"

"Correct, we know two, who has the other one? Probably only Liu Youwang knows—but this Liu Youwang just won't speak. No matter how he is interrogated, saying one sentence over and over: 'Beating me killing me is fine, but absolutely won't betray friends'."

"Didn't expect this person to be quite loyal (Jianghu loyalty)."

"Not only is he loyal, he also loves the Senate incomparably." Ji Xin said, "I look at his confession, he is truly full of love for the Senate—not to beg for life, purely sincerely, from the bottom of the heart."

"Sincere and yet does so many bad things! This digging at the foundation is almost digging the wall down!"

"Little Chen, you don't understand the thinking mode of these people. To them, this isn't called digging the foundation, but the 'treatment' of being an official. Don't look at Liu Youwang's destitute background, almost starving to death before we came. But toward the style of wealthy people and officials in this spacetime, he not only envied but also identified with it. Now that he became an official, he also regards these as matter of course. Do you think just relying on our bit of political education and system design can make them reborn? Many people can't do it... Liu Youwang is just a relatively stupid one among those who can't do it."

"No matter how loyal he is, we must dig the third person out!"

Ji Xin nodded. According to speculation, if this third person was a naturalized citizen, it would be nothing more than one of several important naturalized cadres in the city. But this case was handled by Zhao Fengtian and others from beginning to end. They neither tried to hide the existence of this third person nor secretly sent Liu Youwang to the Western Heaven. It showed they were not one of them. *Maybe, it's someone else?* After all, until now, they hadn't found out the real mastermind behind the Wuzhou riot.

"Who the third person is, we can investigate slowly later. This is not the key point." Ji Xin had now roughly combed through the pulse of the entire Wuzhou Incident, and had a rough understanding of the roles played by various parties in this event. Although the third person was important, it was not his purpose for coming here.

"But we have no other clues anymore. Cai Lan and Xie Erren's relationship... just let it go like this?" Chen Baibin was suddenly somewhat discouraged.

Ji Xin felt quite conflicted about whether to investigate Cai Lan and Xie Erren's relationship clearly. Clearing it up would help clear the air in the Senate's future work and remind Senators; but if cleared up, Xie Erren would be discredited in the Senate. It would be a fatal blow to his personal political future.

Xie Erren obviously also saw this interest relationship clearly and used many means to cut off the direct connection between Cai Lan and him. No matter what the secret report said, the basis for the Senate's final handling of this matter was still Ji Xin's relevant report. As long as Ji Xin's report couldn't verify it, then he would be considered having cast off this fatal charge.

However, since Cai Lan appeared in the secret report, the investigation must have a conclusion. Otherwise it would be questioned. How to grasp this degree was where Ji Xin felt most difficult now.

Directly finding several important naturalized cadres to talk and forcing them to tell the truth was certainly not difficult, and Luo Yangming wouldn't refuse. But this violated his original intention of "protecting naturalized cadres".

He flipped through the materials in hand again and again, suddenly discovering an item in the draft of the "Weekly Report" sent by Luo Yangming to the Political Security Bureau: "Dragon Mother Temple Assassination Case".

Ji Xin was stunned—such a thing happened in Wuzhou? He actually didn't know at all, and no one mentioned it to him! Looks like the water in Wuzhou is really deep.

He checked the date; it happened shortly after the recovery of Wuzhou. Pulling out the report to read in detail, it turned out someone attempted to assassinate Xie Erren in front of the Dragon Mother Temple.

This immediately aroused his interest—especially this report mentioned the assassin was a woman!

"Look quickly! There is a problem here."

Chen Baibin took the report, read it once, and said excitedly: "This person must be Cai Lan!"

Ji Xin said: "Whether it is or not is hard to say yet. But indeed very likely."

"Did Xie Erren report this matter to the Senate?"

"Probably didn't report. Otherwise the number of guards arranged for him should have increased. But this doesn't count as a problem either; after all, in the Yellow Zone, anything can happen."

"We immediately ask people around him to understand."

"I think, those people around him probably have concerns speaking. There is a more suitable person here." Ji Xin said, "He had a guide when he went to the Dragon Mother Temple."

Although He Dongli acted as a guide to accompany Xie Erren to tour the whole city, he didn't accept the title of "Consultative Bureau Committee Member". This wasn't because he worried about the counterattack of Great Ming or the like, but because He Dongli prided himself on being a scholar and was unwilling to work together with a group of big merchants.

So he mostly closed his door to read at home. His family had some properties outside the city. Although in turmoil of war, the security in the suburbs was still fair, and grain and vegetables were not lacking. Xie Erren intended to win him over, occasionally inviting him out to chat, asking him to do work on local scholars and gentry, and afterwards gifting some wine, meat, money and rice. Life passed peacefully.

The Wuzhou riot a few days ago really gave this Mr. He a scare. He wasn't afraid of the return of the Great Ming government, but that breaking the city would inevitably lead to great chaos. A well-to-do family like his would probably suffer devastation—an army with strict discipline like the Australians was unique.

This scare made He Dongli shut his door and decline guests even more, living in seclusion.
