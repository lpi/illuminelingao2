# Chapter 2261: Fratricide

"He cannot hear you, nor can he speak." Zhan Zhekun put his hands behind his back and said leisurely, "Don't waste your energy."

Feng Haijiao suddenly realized: "It's you?!"

Zhan Zhekun nodded silently, seemingly indifferent to the thunderous door-banging outside—when Xin Laonan renovated this temple, he treated it as his last stronghold. Not only were the walls thick and solid, but the doors and windows were also all hard wood wrapped in iron sheets, with door bolts and top door bars added. No matter how many people were outside, flesh and blood plus a few swords and spears couldn't smash it open.

"Zhan Zhekun! I advise you to be sensible; I brought several hundred brothers up the mountain..."

Zhan Zhekun couldn't be bothered to argue with him, turning his head to ask: "Has the smoke been released?"

"Replying to Master, released! League Chief Xie has already sent back news."

"Take him down!" Zhan Zhekun ordered, "Tie him up tightly!"

Attendants on both sides immediately came up and tied Feng Haijiao firmly. At first, Feng Haijiao was not afraid; after all, he had thirty or forty brothers outside the temple, and the three stockade gates were also in his hands, still having the strength to fight. However, after a short while, he heard shouting and killing rise from all sides outside. Exclamations, screams, pleas for mercy, and the clashing of swords and knives mixed together, rising and falling. During this time, it went back and forth several times, and gradually the fighting outside subsided. Feng Haijiao’s face fluctuated between bright and gloomy. However, listening to the sounds outside gradually subsiding, and someone coming in to whisper something in Zhan Zhekun’s ear, the treacherous advisor's brows instantly relaxed. He couldn't help lamenting in his heart: "Finished!" He slumped down completely.

Zhan Zhekun ordered the temple door opened, only to see a mess of flesh and blood outside. From the temple entrance extending to outside the temple, thirty or forty corpses were thrown about in disorder, and more than ten captives knelt aside, extremely dispirited. The battlefield was filled with a stench. Zhan Zhekun smiled slightly, seeing Xie Wendong directing minions to clean the battlefield, and asked: "Are the brothers' casualties heavy?"

"Only three died, seven or eight injured," Xie Wendong complimented, "Advisor truly has a clever plan!"

In fact, this so-called clever plan was not rare. The secret lay in the herbal tea at the foot of the mountain. Although there were no fierce drugs like rhubarb or croton in this herbal tea, double the amount of cooling herbs was added. Drinking ice-cold herbal tea while sweating all over from a long trek, some people couldn't hold it before reaching the mountaintop. Although most people didn't have the urgency to relieve themselves on the spot, the colic in their abdomens made it difficult for them to exert their due combat power. Not to mention Xie Wendong’s main force outnumbered them by fully more than double. Swarming out from behind the temple, they instantly beat this group of stomach-aching minions into flowing water.

"What about the various stockade gates?"

"The main gate has been taken, all slain." Xie Wendong said, "The minions below still don't know what happened..."

Zhan Zhekun asked: "Have Feng Haijiao’s command arrow and seal been obtained?"

"All obtained."

"Good, send someone immediately with his command arrow to the main gate; I will arrive shortly."

"Yes, small one understands!"

The one hundred minions commanded by Mo Chong rested for an hour (two hours) before slowly climbing the mountain. Just passing the second stockade gate, every one of them also had abdominal colic, complaining incessantly. Mo Chong used this excuse to rest at the second gate. Until seeing the smoke rising on the mountaintop, knowing the mountain had succeeded, he secretly rejoiced—he had been instigated to defect by Bi Xuansheng for a long time.

Then he followed the pre-arranged plan, urging the team to climb the mountain. Arriving at the main gate, troops had already been arranged inside. As soon as they entered the stockade gate, they were surrounded. These people had mostly joined Feng Haijiao recently and hadn't received much benefit from him. Plus with abdominal colic, Mo Chong persuaded slightly from the side, and they all laid down their weapons and surrendered. Only the stomach pain was unbearable, inevitably resulting in defecating on the spot, making the place stink to high heaven. Fortunately, the mountain stockade was prepared, having boiled stomach-warming and cold-dispelling medicinal soup. After giving the surrendered people a drink one by one, the abdominal pain and diarrhea gradually stopped.

Although the stomach didn't hurt anymore, being unarmed and sitting on the ground facing swords and spears, plus the corpses and human heads on the ground, the minions were all panic-stricken, fearing for their little lives.

Zhan Zhekun now ordered people to carry out plates full of silver. This made the minions' eyes light up instantly.

"Brothers!" He glanced at the group sitting on the ground, "Feng Haijiao received amnesty and owed a debt of gratitude as high as heaven and thick as earth. Instead of repaying the Emperor's grace and benefiting the common people, he acted perversely, colluded with Hair thieves, and brought disaster to the people and hometown! Viceroy of Two Guangs Lord Xiong has ordered his beheading, transmitting the head to the three Lianyang counties as a warning to others!"

This murderous official speech chilled the minions below, fearing they would also become "rebel partisans."

"...However, Lord Xiong has the virtue of caring for life. Punish the ringleaders only; as for the coerced followers, as long as they repent, they can be spared—not only spared, but can continue to serve the Imperial Court."

After saying this, he clapped his hands, and someone brought trays full of silver, shining brightly.

"As long as you are willing to exert effort for the Imperial Court, not only can the death penalty be waived, but there are also heavy rewards." Zhan Zhekun scanned the audience, "Who is willing to serve the Imperial Court and wipe out the remnants of Feng Haijiao?"

"This small one is willing!" Mo Chong was the first to stand up. He knew this was a good opportunity to offer a petition of surrender. Although fighting with past brothers was unavoidable, compared to the large sum of reward silver and Feng Haijiao’s concubine promised by Bi Xuansheng, it was worth the risk. Moreover, they were fighting few with many, high against low; not to say easy as catching it with hands, there wasn't much risk.

"Good, Brother Mo forsakes darkness for light, refreshing!" Zhan Zhekun waved his hand, "Bring wine! Reward another fifty taels of silver!"

Before the voice fell, someone brought a gleaming large silver ingot and a cup of wine to Mo Chong. Mo Chong knew next it depended on whether his tricks ran deep. He drank the wine in the cup in one gulp, picked up his sword and turned to the minions saying: "Who is willing to go with me to beat those dog-fucked things?!"

Because Feng Haijiao’s troops expanded rapidly and he himself had no talent for managing the army, the conflict between new and old was quite deep. Now provoked by Zhan Zhekun’s few words, plus the stimulation of "heavy rewards," these minions' eyes turned red one by one, all standing up saying they were willing to go fight. Immediately led by Xie Wendong and Mo Chong, taking more than a hundred people, they rushed down the mountain mightily.

The second gate and the Great West Gate were both one-way stockade gates, only able to defend against enemies from down the mountain, having no defense capability against enemies coming from behind. Coming down from the mountain were "own people" led by Mo Chong, plus having Feng Haijiao’s command arrow, the minions left at the checkpoints were unprepared. Ambushed by Mo Chong, the defenders of the second gate were annihilated instantly. These "new brothers" usually had deep contradictions with "old brothers." Once they saw blood, they killed smoothly. Without urging, they rushed down along the mountain road. Without effort, they slaughtered Feng Haijiao’s subordinates at the Great West Gate completely.

Xie Wendong and his group rushed down the mountain, encountering the family members, property, and porters led by Bi Xuansheng at the foot of the mountain. This group of bandits had long killed until their eyes were red, charging straight in to slaughter and rape. Even Xie Wendong couldn't stop them. In the chaos, Bi Xuansheng was almost killed. Fortunately, Zhan Zhekun was prepared, personally leading troops to follow, thus gathering the team. However, outside the Great West Gate had long become like a Asura field.

Although casualties were heavy, most of the dead in this chaotic battle were Feng Haijiao’s men. As for the killed porters, they were dispensable people. Feng Haijiao’s years of savings and the unit's family members were all captured. Plus the absorbed Feng unit troops and the boats and grain captured at Hu Bay, Yang *Juren* made a solid fortune.

"Behead Feng Haijiao and his main leaders and trusted aides, dead or alive. Use lime to dry the heads."

"All Feng unit minions captured in the temple and various stockade gates are to be beheaded."

"Surrendered minions and porters, those willing to stay in the stockade stay; those unwilling are issued ten days of grain and left to their own devices."

"Captured family members without masters are all distributed to the brothers on the mountain."

"Everyone in the stockade, old or new, high or low rank, is rewarded four taels of silver each."

"Reward Mo Chong one hundred taels of silver, Xie Wendong three hundred taels..."

...

Zhan Zhekun arranged various miscellaneous matters here, managing everything in good order. On one side he called Bi Xuansheng over.

"There is still a difficult matter for you to make a trip."

"What difficult matter?" Bi Xuansheng asked. He established great merit this time. Yang *Juren* and Zhan Zhekun praised him highly, not only rewarding him with a large sum of silver but also giving him two of Feng Haijiao’s concubines. For a time he was full of ambition, feeling his strategy was unparalleled. His head was full of fantasies of serving the Imperial Court and saving the three Lianyang counties from water and fire. Zhan Zhekun giving him a task naturally also valued his excited mental state.

"Make a trip to Yangshan County seat."

Now, no matter how excited Bi Xuansheng was, he couldn't help feeling like a basin of ice water was poured over his head. Yangshan County seat was under the Hair thieves' rule. He was Feng Haijiao’s advisor; running to the county seat, wasn't that throwing himself into the net?! Moreover, this new female magistrate of Yangshan County was tyrannical and fond of killing. Since taking office, the bandits and bandit families she slaughtered numbered five hundred if not a thousand.

Thinking of the miserable state of Sun Dabiao’s gang being tortured to death after capture in the rumors, Bi Xuansheng felt cold air rising from his feet, and his body couldn't help trembling. Could this Advisor Zhan be wanting to borrow a knife to kill a man, getting rid of him too? Preparing something unfavorable to Yang *Juren*?

"Don't be afraid." Zhan Zhekun saw his fear, inevitably somewhat disappointed, so he had to comfort him, "Although you are Feng Haijiao’s advisor, his men have been almost wiped out now. There are few living Sun Dabiao people who recognize you. As long as you use an alias and change your appearance, you won't be seen through."

"Master is right, right," Bi Xuansheng cheered up slightly, saying, "What does the Master want the student to go to Yangshan for?"

"Give a gift."

"Give a gift?" Bi Xuansheng was greatly puzzled, "Give to whom?"

"Of course, give to the female magistrate in the county."

Bi Xuansheng opened his mouth wide, unable to close it for almost a minute, then he stammered and asked:

"Master means which... which... Magistrate Master?"

"Of course, the Hair thieves' Li barbarian female magistrate in Yangshan County." Zhan Zhekun said leisurely.
