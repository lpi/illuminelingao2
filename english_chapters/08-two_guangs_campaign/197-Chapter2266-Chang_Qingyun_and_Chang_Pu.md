# Chapter 2266: Chang Qingyun and Chang Pu

Yi Haoran said generously, "What difficulty is there in this? Business is quiet in the shop now anyway. Teaching Liheng to study is a small matter. It won't take much effort—as for tuition, mention it no more. It's not easy for you mother and son to live at home. The days are still long; saving a few more copper coins will be good for getting Liheng a wife in the future! If your niece-in-law's husband knows in the underworld, he will surely be grateful to you."

Qiuchan’s eyes were slightly red, and she whispered, "Sir! You are truly the benefactor of us mother and son!"

"Don't be like this! Don't be like this!" Yi Haoran was afraid she would make some noise and attract Ah Chun, so he hurriedly waved his hand, "Only this matter still needs to be reported to Shopkeeper Luo..."

"Ah Tao is a close friend of my boudoir; she will naturally help with this matter." Jiang Qiuchan was very confident.

Immediately it was agreed to choose a day to start education. The place for studying was set in the Yuxin Rice Shop. Every morning, a fellow from the Jiang family would bring the child over and pick him up again at noon.

Sending away Jiang Qiuchan, Yi Haoran was uncontrollably excited: Heaven is truly helping me! what a good day today is? I met Jiang Suo when going out, and encountered such a matter after coming back! The Great Cause has hope!

A few days later, Qiuchan indeed sent the child to study. He reported to Luo Yangming, and the boss just laughed. Obviously, his mind was not on the rice shop, and business was entirely entrusted to the old shopkeeper Li Wensheng to manage.

Because the child was still young and the world was not peaceful, the daily lessons ended before noon. The Jiang family sent a fellow to pick up the child, and Yi Haoran had basically nothing to do in the afternoon. Every now and then, Qiuchan would personally visit, bringing soup or dim sum. Yi Haoran originally felt that Qiuchan was still in mourning, and such frequent interactions would inevitably attract gossip. He should remind her to avoid suspicion more or less. Considering this was needed for the "Great Cause," and he had a teacher-student relationship with her son, he didn't mention this matter. He waited quietly for Jiang Suo’s news.

Chang Qingyun returned to his quarters at Sanheui, his heart agitated and confused.

Today he encountered Jiang Suo by the Gui River Floating Bridge.

He knew Jiang Suo; he was a team officer of the house guards trained by Viceroy Xiong. His whereabouts were unknown after the Battle of Bang Mountain. He originally had no dealings with Jiang Suo and was dismissive of such low-level military officers. If he hadn't heard that he was a "surrendered Australian," having a bit of curiosity, he probably wouldn't even have remembered his name. In fact, he had almost forgotten what he looked like now.

However, Jiang Suo did not forget him. He stopped him when he was about to step onto the floating bridge, expressing he wanted to "talk" with him.

Chang Qingyun didn't want to talk to him. Although he was a captive now, his life was still comfortable. Although the Hair thieves despised Daming scholars, they still had to use their reading and writing abilities. Chang Qingyun could write and calculate, so he received very good treatment in the captive camp. Even the fake Australian officers guarding the captives called him "Mr. Chang." He rarely went out for labor, and even if he did, it was all clerical work, without needing to exert physical effort. Chang Qingyun estimated that the Australians probably still used the old set of methods: wait for the situation to pacify and ask everyone to pay ransom; those without money would accumulate points to redeem themselves. No matter which, he could escape safely—this time, the travel as an advisor could be considered to have passed with fright but no danger. When he returned to his hometown, he would never come out to be an advisor again; the psychological shadow the Australians gave him was too deep.

However, Jiang Suo’s next sentence made him feel like falling into an ice cave.

"Since Sir is unwilling to talk with this small one, could it be you are willing for this small one to send a letter, reporting that Sir is Master Chang himself?"

Although the big fire when Wuzhou city broke didn't cause a disaster destroying the whole city, quite a few families were ruined and people died because of it. Therefore, the common people hated Xiong Wencan and others to the bone, especially Chang Pu who offered the plan of burning Wuzhou, who was spurned by thousands and cursed by ten thousands. Mentioning "Master Chang under Xiong Wencan," the common people all gritted their teeth, wishing to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin.

Very unfortunately, Chang Pu who offered this plan was named Chang, and Chang Qingyun was also named Chang. Moreover, they were both under Xiong Wencan’s command at that time. After Chang Qingyun was captured, he spent enormous effort to tear himself apart from Chang Pu. Thanks also to the Australians not harboring the thought of "borrowing a head for use," otherwise just these two points would be enough for him to die seventeen or eighteen times.

"What nonsense are you talking! The one who offered the vicious plan was Chang Pu; he was the magistrate of Enping. What does it have to do with me? As long as one was in Viceroy Xiong's Shogunate, no one didn't know." Chang Qingyun inevitably became flustered and exasperated. Chang Pu disappeared before the city broke; didn't know if he ran away with Xiong Wencan or died in the chaotic army. If it really caused a disturbance, he couldn't clear himself even with mouths all over his body.

"Hehe, even if you aren't him, was this Chang Pu not recommended to Xiong Wencan by you?" Jiang Suo sneered, "He was originally a deposed official. Losing the county seat, he was already a person awaiting punishment, just fleeing with the main army. You, however, recommended him to Xiong Wencan. This is surely not false, right? Isn't it known upon asking?"

This was like five thunders striking the crown. If getting serious, he really couldn't slide past. He originally knew about Chang Pu offering the plan to burn Wuzhou—not only did he not dissuade, but he felt this plan was feasible and recommended Chang Pu to Xiong Wencan.

"You, what do you want..." Chang Qingyun panicked.

"Don't want anything," Jiang Suo looked at the soul-lost Chang Qingyun with contempt, "There is an old acquaintance who wants to make an appointment to see you."

Chang Qingyun couldn't remember clearly how he crossed the floating bridge and returned to the captive camp. He was in a trance, walking with one foot deep and one foot shallow back to his quarters in the captive camp.

The Sanheui Captive Camp was large in scale. It was originally the parade ground of the government troops. Wuzhou was a military key town, with many troops stationed usually. Thus there were many barracks, enough to accommodate a huge number of captives. Not only officials and soldiers captured in the Wuzhou campaign were detained here, but personnel captured in Guangxi operations and clearing actions around Wuzhou were also mostly sent here for screening and detention. At the peak, there were fully six or seven thousand people. Some people were released after screening, some were sent back to Guangzhou to wait for "allocation." Originally this place also sheltered some refugees, now mostly repatriated. Currently, there were about four thousand captives here, used as laborers.

As a "clerk," Chang Qingyun occupied a small room alone, which was both bedroom and office. He stumbled back into the room, closed the door, and fell onto the broken bed.

The "old acquaintance" Jiang Suo mentioned was needless to say someone under Xiong Wencan’s command in the past. He could roughly guess the purpose of wanting to see him—mostly to "do big things."

Doing big things in Wuzhou under this Australian rule was naturally a matter of losing one's head.

When Chang Qingyun was proud, he also had emotions of "why cherish life for fame and merit," with fierce aspirations. However, since the disastrous defeat at Chengmai, failing to commit suicide in the chaotic soldiers, and finally getting captured with hands tied to live ignobly, his blood filled with passion receded by half. When Xiong Wencan decided on the fire plan and abandoned the city to flee, Chang Qingyun requested to stay to "coordinate inside and outside" in a moment of hot blood, preparing to martyr himself for the city, both to wash away the shame of being captured by Australians back then and to repay Xiong Wencan’s grace of selecting him initially.

However, when the fire really burned up, Chang Qingyun regretted it again: just as he regretted in the chaotic army back then why he followed the glorious army across the sea to conquer the Hair thieves.

He had no dissatisfaction with the current captive life. Enduring a year or so like this, the Australians would naturally let him run.

Better to report this! This thought suddenly surfaced in the depths of his heart. However, thinking of Jiang Suo’s words, Chang Qingyun slumped down again.

The relationship between Chang Pu and himself was known to everyone in Xiong Wencan’s staff—just in this captive camp, there were no less than a dozen people who knew. If Jiang Suo was captured and firmly insisted the plan of burning Wuzhou was offered by him, how could he defend himself?! Even if the Australians believed the plan was thought up by Chang Pu, it was exactly himself recommending this person to Xiong Wencan that made burning Wuzhou possible—even in Daming, he would be "frenzied and devoid of conscience." If Australians cut him in two with one knife, absolutely no one would feel he was wronged.

Chang Qingyun’s hands and feet were ice cold, sweat appearing on his back. Not until the bell for serving dinner rang outside did he barely support his body, forcing up his spirit to go out for food.

The captive camp provided two meals daily. Those going out to work were provided one meal outside by the employer unit. Naturally, there wouldn't be anything delicious in these two meals, nothing more than the stocked grassland dry ration paste, rice porridge, and sweet potatoes, accompanied by military standard pickled vegetables. Fresh vegetables were all procured locally, not cooked either, just washed clean and braised in the porridge or paste. Talking about taste was out of the question, but one could eat one's fill.

Chang Qingyun fetched a basin of paste and returned to his room, eating paste while thinking of countermeasures. Suddenly someone outside shouted: "Chang Qingyun! Chang Qingyun!"

Chang Qingyun froze. Usually everyone in the captive camp called him "Sir," even fake Australians were no exception. Why did someone suddenly call him by name? He felt some indignation in his heart and got up to welcome the person.

Going out to look, it was an unfamiliar fake Australian cadre. He dared not neglect, bowing: "Student is Chang Qingyun. Wonder what orders the Superior Officer has?"

"You are?" The comer looked him up and down, "Clean yourself up and follow me immediately!"

Chang Qingyun shivered in fright. Could it be that someone went to report his conversation with Jiang Suo this afternoon? Or had Jiang Suo already reported to the Australians that he was the instigator of burning Wuzhou?

"After all what errand?" He gathered courage and asked carefully.

"You'll know naturally when you go, why so hesitant!" The comer was obviously quite impatient, "The sky is about to get dark. If we don't go, we won't catch the city gate!"

Even though full of apprehension, Chang Qingyun could only set off with the comer. Leaving the captive camp and crossing the floating bridge, they entered Dayun Gate. The group walked along the street for not very far before arriving in front of a pitch-black government office.

Although the sky was already dark, Chang Qingyun still recognized this place. It was where the "Three Headquarters" in Wuzhou City was located. This was once where Xiong Wencan was stationed. As a member of the Shogunate, Chang Qingyun had also lived here, familiar beyond familiar.

Strange, why send him to the Three Headquarters? He knew this place had become a barracks since the Australians entered the city, stationing many troops.
