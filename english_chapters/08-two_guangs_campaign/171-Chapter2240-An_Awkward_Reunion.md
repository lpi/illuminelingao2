# Chapter 2240 - An Awkward Reunion

Peng Shou'an continued his recommendations, mentioning several other influential families. Among them was the Tang clan.

"The Tang ancestor was Tang Jian, who led troops south to capture Yangshan at the dynasty's founding. He left his fifth son here to establish a branch line. Though this branch never distinguished itself in official circles, the bloodline has endured for generations. Today, several thousand clansmen live together—making them one of the county's most powerful clans."

Such a great clan, in a place like Yangshan, was essentially a militia unto itself. One word from the patriarch could muster four or five hundred men.

Bi Da turned to Luo Yiming. "How have these families treated us?"

"Except for the Ouyangs, none will pay reasonable contributions. Nothing but endless stalling." Luo Yiming shook his head. "The Ouyang family's old residence is inside the city walls, so they've been somewhat more cooperative."

"I understand." Bi Da now had the full picture. She turned to Peng Shou'an. "Mr. Peng, I'll need you to visit all of these families."

"I can certainly pay calls, but given the current situation, a visit alone may not move them..."

"Naturally, I won't send you empty-handed." Bi Da smiled. "Wait for my word. I'll prepare a generous gift for you to bring."

Both Peng Shou'an and Luo Yiming looked puzzled. *This lady magistrate arrived with nothing. Where would she get a generous gift? The county treasury is nearly bare.*

After seeing Peng Shou'an out, Luo Yiming couldn't contain his curiosity. "County Magistrate! What gift? The county has nothing..."

"Even if the county had something, I wouldn't squander it on these moneybags and patriarchs." Bi Da's voice was firm. "In our position, groveling with lavish gifts—never mind whether it would work—even if it did, who would actually be in charge of Yangshan afterward?"

Luo Yiming breathed easier. *So the County Magistrate hasn't lost her head after all.*

"But then...?"

"Right now, our prestige in Yangshan is gone. The 'generous gift' I speak of is about restoring it." Bi Da had thought this through clearly. In their current state, local power brokers wouldn't give them the time of day. Even if they could be persuaded to help, the cost would be astronomical. They might solve the immediate crisis—but the long-term consequences would be disastrous. The only solution was to rebuild their authority.

"We have an elite unit at our disposal. We should make full use of it." Bi Da's eyes gleamed. "Win a reputation in Yangshan. Then these fence-sitters will know which side to back."

"I understand, County Magistrate!" Luo Yiming nodded eagerly. "So—what exactly do we do?"

"What's the situation at Dalang Market now?"

"Still Sun Dabiao's territory—though it's mostly ruins. Sun Dabiao has his main force camped there, and he's gathered a lot more men."

"Then we take Dalang Market first."

Dalang Market was a strategic pass on the road to the Yao region. Capturing it would carry powerful symbolic weight—seizing Sun Dabiao's lair—while also restoring control over Yonghua. Moreover, controlling Dalang Market held major economic significance: the annual salt trade into the Yao region alone generated substantial revenue. Holding Dalang Market meant holding Yonghua's economic lifeline.

"But we don't have the numbers," Luo Yiming said. "Pan Tianshun has volunteered several times—says he'll return to Yonghua and raise forces to fight Sun Dabiao. I think we could let him handle it. We provide fire support; after the victory, the Yonghua Yao garrison Dalang Market."

Bi Da shook her head. "We can't hand this job to Pan Tianshun—and we certainly can't give him Dalang Market. With Dalang Market in our hands, we hold the initiative. If Pan Tianshun's people hold it, the initiative passes to them. Setting aside the economic value of that pass—they'd be positioned to attack or defend at will. The next time we need their cooperation, we'd have to threaten them with an army—or hand over a truly generous gift."

Luo Yiming saw the logic. If the Yonghua Yao ever rejoined the Eight Ranks Yao, losing Dalang Market would leave Yangshan wide open.

"Then let's have Pan Tianshun bring his survivors along when we attack Dalang Market," he suggested. "If he wants to return home and raise troops, how can he get back without taking Dalang Market?"

"Tell me, Comrade Luo—how long has Pan Tianshun been saying he wants to go back and raise troops?"

"Quite a while now—since the day County Magistrate Wang was wounded."

"There's more than one road back to Yonghua. He could easily take his men via Libu Market—longer, but perfectly doable. Why hasn't he left?"

Luo Yiming was stumped. *Why hasn't he left?* There always seemed to be some reason for delay—and he himself hadn't wanted Pan Tianshun to go, since that would mean losing what little armed strength they had.

"He's lingering around the county seat waiting for us to give him legitimacy..." Bi Da said.

"Legitimacy? What legitimacy can we give him?" Luo Yiming was more confused than ever.

"Exactly what you just proposed—let him fight, then garrison Dalang Market. Perhaps he even wants a title—'Mayor of Dalang Market,' or something. If he controls Dalang Market, it becomes official and proper." Bi Da paused. "And setting aside any ulterior motives—the salt trade alone is worth a fortune every year."

Laid out this plainly, Luo Yiming finally understood. He had felt warmly toward Pan Tianshun—they had "forged camaraderie in blood"—and had thought of the Yonghua Yao as "our people."

"So you mean...?"

"Of course Pan Tianshun has done nothing against us—he's even rendered service to the Council. But the Yao villages are one of the county's local power factions. He and we are, at present, only 'friends'—not 'comrades.'"

They were still talking when someone came to report: "Company Commander Zhen is here."

"Show him in." Bi Da nodded. "Comrade Luo, please stay. We can discuss the offensive plan."

Rapid footsteps echoed in the corridor, and Zhen Huan strode in. He had enlisted to follow Bi Da—but over the years, he had rarely seen her. Bi Da seemed always to be avoiding him. Whenever his company was stationed somewhere, Bi Da would mysteriously be transferred away. During their posting in Kaohsiung, they had finally spent some time in the same place. Yet every time Zhen Huan tried to see her, she was always "down in the countryside" or "on temporary assignment" in some village. Once, he tracked her down directly to the village where she was posted. For the first time in years, they sat face to face.

But this long-awaited reunion left Zhen Huan with no pleasant memories—let alone any "rekindling of old feelings." Bi Da had been coolly indifferent. Their conversation was flat as water. No matter how Zhen Huan tried to steer the talk, Bi Da never responded—she had no interest in reminiscing about the past, nor did she want to discuss the future.

At one point, Bi Da's coldness had broken Zhen Huan's heart. Back in the village, they had been the acknowledged couple—tenderly, passionately in love. Now Bi Da seemed like a different person entirely, as if she had forgotten everything. No matter how Zhen Huan cajoled or insisted, he couldn't move her an inch.

After that meeting, they had been apart again for a long time. Both were reassigned to the Lianyang region. Zhen Huan had searched for every opportunity to see her—but combat missions kept him busy, and the chance never came.

Now she had come to Yangshan as County Magistrate—at last, they could see each other every day!

In that eager frame of mind, Zhen Huan burst into the office.

"Bi Da!" he called out, his voice thick with feeling—then spotted Luo Yiming and realized he had been rash. A flush of embarrassment crept up his face.

"Company Commander Zhen, you're just in time. I was about to send for you." Bi Da's tone remained calm and professional. "We're about to discuss our next military action. We'll need your company."

"At your command! Ready to die!" Zhen Huan immediately blurted out an awkward declaration of resolve.

"You didn't even ask to see my authorization before saying that. A bit hasty, don't you think?"

"Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it..."

Now it was Luo Yiming's turn to feel awkward. Though he didn't know the history between the female County Magistrate and the Mountain Company commander, their words and manner made it clear their relationship was "not simple." And knowing both were Li cadres from Hainan, he pieced together the rest.

Bi Da remained composed. "That statement is against regulations." She took a document from her drawer—an order signed by Huang Chao. "Here are your orders."

Zhen Huan took it without looking and stuffed it in his pocket. "Bi Da, tell me—who are we attacking?"

"Section Chief Luo and I have tentatively decided to take Dalang Market—strike a blow at Sun Dabiao's bandits and reassert control over Yonghua township." Bi Da summarized what they had just discussed. "What do you think?"

"I support every decision you make!" Zhen Huan declared.

Bi Da sighed in exasperation. Luo Yiming stifled a laugh and smoothed things over. "Since Company Commander Zhen has no objections, let's discuss the battle plan."

"Good." Zhen Huan grew focused. "What's the enemy situation in the county now? Section Chief Luo, give us a rundown."

"Alright." Luo Yiming drew back the curtain covering the wall map. "The enemy situation isn't complicated. There are three main bandit groups: Sun Dabiao's, Feng Haijiao's, and a new one we know little about. There are also plenty of small scattered groups—low numbers, poor equipment.

"Since burning Dalang Market, Sun Dabiao has swelled into the county's largest bandit force. Many local bandits and riffraff have joined him, and he's absorbed scattered bands from other counties. His strength has ballooned to nearly six hundred. According to our scouts, these out-of-county stragglers brought weapons—firearms—so Sun Dabiao's equipment is much better than before. He also recently received a title from Xiong Wencan—some kind of 'Garrison Captain.' So these new arrivals may have official Ming backing—possibly even remnants of regular troops."
