# Chapter 2380: Financing (Part 15)

"This Chu He, well, he's been in Jeju Island too long. These years, his mind was probably all on women and children. His way of thinking is still the same as when we just landed—solve problems as they come. But it's already '35, seven years since crossing, everyone's a leader of some size. You're still the same old way, will that work? Who doesn't have two empty bowls waiting for meat—if the Nanyang Company does well and harvests lots of stock leeks, what does it have to do with Liu Xiang, Zheng Shangjie, or Mu Min? Oh, if they screw up their fancy moves, it would keep these several people busy for a while. Looking at history, after which financial storm wasn't there a mess, with the administrative agencies having to clean up? Liu Xiang is eyeing the big households' silver not to contribute it all to the central government for 'coordinated allocation.' He's good, not even leaving taxes for the local government. He just doesn't think about it—if everyone is to support you, on what basis?"

"These twists and turns, I'm afraid Senators not working locally can't wrap their heads around it." Zhang Xiaoqi said, "Always feeling it's all for the Senate, what's there to haggle about!"

"Where your butt sits determines what you consider. This is also human nature. Gradually they'll come around." Wang Qiyi sighed, "Since ancient times, the fiscal distribution between central and local governments has always been a big topic. Handle it well, and the nation is prosperous and the people are strong. Handle it poorly—the Ming Dynasty is a classic example."

They were both tax cadres in the past and hadn't handled financial work, but taxation and finance are inseparable, so they were quite knowledgeable about fiscal issues. How the Senate should overcome the flaws of the old spacetime, leverage strengths and avoid weaknesses, and copy the homework well—this had always been a question the three Senators at the Tax Bureau were considering.

Hearing that a telegram had come, Zhou Wei felt anxious. Without even having time to carefully read the telegram details, he hurriedly showed his identity and signed for the telegram. Only when he returned to his bedroom and dug out the codebook from his luggage did he notice the sender was his wife Huang Qi.

"Wife, you've really done me in!" Thinking that Secretary Zhou was personally selected by his wife, Zhou Wei felt a surge of grief and indignation.

Following the general merchant-confidential codebook used by Senators—so-called merchant-confidential is a classification level, meaning encrypted information of this level can be transmitted over public networks, commercial networks, or general commercial means—Zhou Wei decoded the ciphertext into two strings of meaningless English letters. Then, following his agreement with his wife and doing a simple dictionary substitution, Zhou Wei could finally see the full text of the message:

"CGCI@GZ"

"GD#D3AUT#42y"

This was the third layer, knowledge-based proxy...

Zhou Wei's brain turned for a moment, and he finally understood the information his wife wanted to convey. He was immediately moved to tears of gratitude: "Wife! You're truly my lucky star!"

The first sentence's CGCI was the abbreviation for China Gold Coin Corporation in the old spacetime, but Zhou Wei and Huang Qi had long agreed to use this to refer to the Central Reserve Bank being prepared by the Senate. The meaning of @GZ was of course even clearer. The whole meaning was: the Senate has argued out a preliminary result, the Central Reserve Bank is about to be established, and the location is Guangzhou!

The establishment wasn't surprising, because ever since the Administrative Affairs Yuan Finance Meeting decided to issue precious metal currency and corresponding paper exchange notes to replace food distribution vouchers, the creation of a professional central bank was already a done deal.

Once the Central Reserve Bank was established, Delong, which was acting as the central bank, would inevitably undergo some kind of adjustment. Its role should be positioned as a national commercial bank. Were there any new opportunities here? Unfortunately, there was no time to think about it now.

The second sentence, GD was of course Guangdong. D3AUT was a deliberate misspelling of "drought." Because English vowels have no pattern, and each vowel can make all sounds, this was a small point Zhou Wei and Huang Qi joked about in daily conversation. So they agreed that when using formal words to communicate, they would spell directly according to American IPA phonetics. Naturally, consonants like dr- were written as 3 based on the principle of similar phonetic symbol shapes. The 42y behind was simple. The entire string meant "Guangdong major drought for two years."

This second sentence should be what he asked his wife to pay attention to and inquire about in Lingao—what stances Liu Xiang's group had taken in major meetings in Lingao, what they cared about most.

"Major drought for two years" was actually information that was easy to overlook, because this information was practically public knowledge to the Senators. Anyone could go to the Big Library to look up relevant ancient disaster records. Information being too easy to obtain instead made many insensitive people not think in this direction when considering matters.

So, Liu Xiang and his people, along with their "accomplices" in Lingao, had been pressing the Senate for grain recently?

No wonder in the previous two meetings, he seemed completely uninterested in all my explicit and implicit benefit transfers...

Now that I know your pain point, I'll have to carefully calculate. Meeting tomorrow evening? There's still time!

Little Tan walked in: "Chief, this is the joint proposal regarding the Nanyang Company that was just delivered."

With no one he could use at the moment, he had to use this accountant as a secretary for now.

"Put it on the desk." Zhou Wei saw the thick document bag placed on his desk, like a yellow bomb package.

Speaking of it, these people originally came to peddle their own plans. No matter how bad they were, just brushing them off would do. Zhou Wei was confident he had at least that much ability—worst case, draw a few more big pies. Now that it had come to this, this proposal had become actual "hard goods." The cost he would have to pay wasn't something drawing big pies could solve.

With this mood, he quite heavily tore open the document bag. Inside was a messy pile of papers, mostly handwritten, simply stapled together. Judging from the handwriting and revision marks, it seemed they had just pieced together their individual proposals without even having a general outline.

Looking at this was worse than looking at the memoranda they each sent separately.

He casually flipped through, with little interest. Most of his "little brothers" had already put forward proposals or suggestions for these things, some more thorough and professional. Other proposals were obviously not practical at first glance.

What Zhou Wei was most concerned about now was Chu He and Ren Youzi. He already knew the ringleaders were these two...

Chu He's proposal was very meticulous, specially put in a paper bag with "Draft Plan for Nanyang Company Fundraising" written neatly on it. Then he started looking for Ren Youzi's proposal but didn't find it.

"Huh? Why isn't his draft in here?" Zhou Wei found it strange. He called Little Tan over.

"Is there still the memorandum left from that time in the document basket?"

"Those memoranda were all taken by Chief Mu—as evidence..."

"Oh oh, look at my brain." Zhou Wei patted his head.

"But I have a copy of the specific memorandum names here." Little Tan took out the copy of the registration book.

Fortunately, he thought of keeping a backup at that time. Zhou Wei thought.

"Bring it immediately."

The copy detailed each Senator's memorandum with their specific names. Ren Youzi's memorandum was titled "Preparing the Guangzhou Stock Exchange to Serve Nanyang Company Fundraising."

"So that's what it was!" Zhou Wei thought. No wonder his proposal wasn't in this joint draft. He probably figured it out!

Blunder, truly a blunder!

He racked his brain in the office for a long time, then suddenly looked up and called: "Little Tan!"

Little Tan had just left not long ago. Hearing the chief call, he hurried back—ever since Secretary Zhou was arrested, the staff at Zhou's office had been highly nervous, fearing being dragged into some sensational case.

"Go to the guesthouse quietly tonight..."

At 6:30, sounds finally quieted down for a moment in the large conference room of Guangzhou Municipal Government.

Chu He, who was in charge of the main presentation, had talked until his throat was smoking. He finally finished explaining the "overall plan" hastily put together at the tavern. Because it was too last-minute, the plan didn't even have a formally copied version, so Chu He had to start speaking with just draft paper, occasionally asking the small partners in corresponding fields to supplement details.

He lectured while inwardly cursing. What the hell is this! Decorum, decorum, one after another looking too ugly! Not professional at all!

But he could only say this in his belly. After all, he was still counting on his fellow sufferers' support.

"Thank you, Comrade Chu He! Everyone, let's take a thirty-minute break, have dinner, and at seven o'clock, let's discuss again." Liu Xiang spoke up: "Little Zhang, take everyone to the cafeteria. I've notified them to keep food. Also, have the staff bring boxed meals for me, Director Wang, and Director Ai. The three of us will stay here, eating while carefully reading everyone's valuable opinions."

Zhang Yunmi immediately closed the meeting notebook and cheerfully led the seven Senators straight to the cafeteria. After everyone had left, these three also quickly rushed to the nearby restroom to empty their bladders. Only after feeling thoroughly refreshed did they scatter—Liu Xiang didn't actively smoke, which everyone knew after spending time together. When meeting, if you smoked, Old Liu wouldn't say anything to your face, but he would personally go open windows for ventilation. With this stance, you wouldn't have the nerve to keep smoking one after another! Wang Qiyi also didn't smoke—perhaps all fathers with daughters were like this. But this meeting had really dragged on too long. Ai Zhixin had been holding it in unbearably, and now was strolling to the municipal government's small courtyard to satisfy his craving.

In the conference room, Liu and Wang, waiting for their boxed meals, each refilled their tea and started chatting.

"How is it?!" Wang Qiyi asked first. The whole Nanyang Company matter—Wang Qiyi actually had more of a spectator mentality—he was very invested in his work in Guangzhou, so much so that many people forgot he was a centrally-dispatched cadre. He came locally to cooperate, not subordinate to Liu Xiang. The whole thing, in his view, was the local faction contributing people, effort, and supplies, and when credit was given in the end, they could probably only appear in the "acknowledgments." Hence their reluctance and desire to make a fuss. However, from his centrally-dispatched perspective, however the two sides made a fuss actually didn't matter. In the end, the benefits would definitely go to the central government. The difference was just seeing both sides' styles and eating manners, to assess what attitude to take when dealing with these people in the future.
