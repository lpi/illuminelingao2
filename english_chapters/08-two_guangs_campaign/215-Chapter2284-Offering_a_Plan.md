# Chapter 2284: Offering a Plan

Luo Yangming didn't chase asking anymore; he thought in heart, now Teng County already liberated, just asking Zhao Fengtian to send a letter to Teng County, could check clear this Advisor Hao's background.

Ding A-tao asked back instead: "What happened to Advisor Hao? Could it be having some fault?"

"Where where," Luo Yangming said, "I see he has much ability, not like an ordinary scholar. Now military chaos horse confusion, better ask Australian to check steadier."

These words made Ding A-tao take heart; she had good feeling for Mr. Hao consistenttly, moreover introduced by best friend. Own husband now was figure on official use; if really checked out some "Unresponsive Matters," wouldn't it make everyone very ugly. Second day early morning, quietly wrote a note, sealed well giving Wen Yun, asking her to take simple gifts to Jiang family.

"You say to Miss Jiang, this gift is returning Australian Dim Sum she sent last time; here also has a letter, hand to her personally together, understand?"

Sent away Wen Yun, Ding A-tao heart somewhat panicked. A few days ago, city arrested several "Bandits," said to be spies sent by government, all beheaded for public display. Since this Prefect Xie took office rarely killed people; suddenly beheading several in one breath was first time; could it be situation outside had some unstable place again?

She had heart to talk her worry with Li Wensheng, but this old shopkeeper always blindly spoke some comforting words—moreover he was same as herself, dwelling in city for long time; what situation outside exactly not necessarily knew more than herself...

She suddenly remembered Wen Iron Head. He this boat runner and brothers under hand now all running boats for Australians on river; things known should be more; might as well ask him when having chance.

News of Luo Yangming chasing questioning "Mr. Hao" background caused Jiang Qiuchan’s nervousness. "Mr. Hao's" background she couldn't be clearer. This Luo Yangming now was person on official face; really wanting to chase check, afraid couldn't conceal. In case Yi Haoran identity exposed, taken to government, harming life not to say, also involving that corpse in dry well of husband family backyard; at that time afraid herself couldn't dodge either...

Thinking here, she took opportunity of picking up child from school to see Yi Haoran, telling him this news quietly.

"...This Shopkeeper Luo although is a business man, yet handling affairs for Australian very hard; in case he detects something, reporting you to government, wouldn't it be accident!"

Yi Haoran didn't expect Employer Luo surprisingly would suspect himself. Asked a few more sentences; roughly guessed was own "Offering Plan" attracted other party's suspicion.

This was actually miscalculation! He thought secretly, didn't expect this Luo Yangming so ghost! But he also raised suspicion: reasonably speaking, this kind of business man mostly held concept of one thing less better than one thing more; even detecting suspicious points, high probability also pretending confusion. How could think of inviting government to interfere? Himself in Luo family trading firm never did things sorry to his family.

Just suspicious he suddenly remembered Chang Qingyun told him, Australian "Spies sitting and scouting spreading under heaven." Could it be this Luo Yangming was Australian’s spy too?

While contemplating, Qiuchan low voice said: "Otherwise, Mr. Hao you evade first—now road to Teng County already through; you just say want to go home, hurry resign job going to Teng County. My husband family is right in Teng County, also big household; I write a letter for Sir; Sir take to seek refuge, evade temporarily."

"Teng County now also in Hair thief hands; if this Luo Yangming really wants to investigate, isn't it matter of a paper document." Yi Haoran shook head saying, "If I go, wouldn't it immediately fulfill his suspicion?"

"Then..."

"I in Wuzhou consistently abide by law and behave myself; Luo Yangming now busy with grain transfer matter; at this critical confuse juncture afraid can't attend to manage this matter." Yi Haoran knew, running away immediately at this moment was safest; but he couldn't let go plan plotted for long time; he was plan coordinator; once running away, this big matter considered wasted!

He considered for moment, feeling safe for now; Luo Yangming not necessarily would really go investigate anything. But seeing panicked appearance of woman before eyes, he felt necessary to comfort her, avoiding exposing horse foot under panic.

"You don't worry," Yi Haoran comforted her saying, "Student heaven big crime is nothing more than being Xiong Wencan’s staff—I wasn't some Red Man in Shogunate; even taken down just squatting a few days in Sanheui, can't harm life. Other matters, you don't need to worry even more. Also, your brother's matter now also has brow; within three five days, probably Senator Xie place will have explanation."

He said matter of his "Offering Plan," also said: "...Shopkeeper Luo originally suffered from money shortage; this method he has to use. Go back tell your brother, ask him to contact actively as soon as possible, occupying this first opportunity!"

"This matter not anxious, Sir you here..." Jiang Qiuchan still felt not reassured; Yi Haoran quick witted moved, said: "When you go accompany Cai Lan, say this matter to her—no, not wanting her to beg favor, just want her to pay attention to this matter; if any news tell you ASAP is fine..."

Jiang Qiuchan thought herself still had Cai Lan this aid, heart loosened, said: "I entering mansion tomorrow will speak with her!"

"Mr. Hao says so?" Cai Lan asked in low voice.

"Exactly!" Jiang Qiuchan somewhat nervous, "Beg sister pay attention; if any change, please inform one or two in advance."

"I know." Cai Lan nodded, "You don't need to fear, ten thousand matters have me."

Having Cai Lan this sentence, Jiang Qiuchan naturally reassured. Since Cai Lan went to Dragon Mother Temple, attitude towards Senator Xie had obvious change. Common saying goes: Man chasing woman, separated by mountain; woman chasing man, separated by paper. If woman used heart on man, man rarely not falling into gentle township. Senator Xie work busy, lacking was exactly tenderness between man and woman. Cai Lan although small door small household background, traditional woman works were all learned; also able to go up hall and down kitchen. Every day not only preparing soup and water personally, also sewing and mending for Senator Xie. Servant women all said secretly: this little girl accepted fate.

This effort going down, Senator Xie now almost every day came to Three Headquarters to stay overnight. Sometimes "Spring night bitter short," getting up late, simply worked here during day too. Administrative center of Wuzhou gradually had trend of shifting to Three Headquarters. Cai Lan’s "Exclusive Favor" momentum was blazing. At critical moment as long as she willing to come out to mediate, could turn bad luck to good luck.

But Zhao Fengtian didn't quite approve this shift: although Three Headquarters had many organizations, also troops stationed, place bigger than Prefecture Yamen several times; garrison mostly National Army, unfavorable for strict security.

But Xie Erren didn't mind; here was Wuzhou's "City within City"; surrounding had hundreds of National Army and naturalized citizen cadres encircling; if here not safe, where else safe! Therefore towards Zhao Fengtian’s advice just laughed it off.

Luo Yangming came to find him, reporting thought of "Raising Fund Buying Rice." Xie Erren listened feeling also a method, asked:

"This gang of merchants, wanting them to pay money definitely has dividend; we selling rice over saying back to bottom is for stabilizing rice price; how much dividend can give them?"

"I preliminarily calculated. Price of this batch of brown rice arriving Wuzhou is one tael three mace per *dan*." Luo Yangming took out notebook, "City flat in flat out, directly engaging as registered residence rice rationing, only can sell one tael five mace per *dan*; earning two mace per *dan*. Ten thousand *dan* also just earning two thousand taels silver."

"This gang of merchants inevitably unwilling." Xie Erren nodded saying, "This I understand. Benefit they covet, at least fifty percent profit."

"Yes," Luo Yangming said, "But right now their condition universally not good; silver placed in hand can't earn money; can force them a bit."

"Forcing a bit is easy; just next time asking them to pay money again, afraid won't be that happy." Xie Erren somewhat hesitant.

Luo Yangming said: "I actually have a method, just need Chief to make decision."

"You speak to see."

Luo Yangming’s method speaking came not rare; after ten thousand *dan* grain arrived, six thousand *dan* taken out as registered residence rice rationing; remaining three thousand *dan*, sold according to current "Market Limit Price."

Seven thousand *dan* rice fair price rationing, could support grain consumption of Wuzhou for a month; and selling according to "Market Limit Price," current retail price was two taels eight mace.

"...These grain, not released by big plate small plate, but handed to various grain shops to act as agent. After sales finished, then distribute dividend according to each family funding quota. Agent grain shops, every *dan* sold take one mace agent fee."

This way three thousand *dan* rice could profit four thousand five hundred taels; deducting three hundred taels agent fee, still had four thousand one hundred taels net profit. Enough to pay various returns; City Government could also keep a part as funds—City Government's current financial situation of stretching collar exposing elbow also always made Xie Erren headache.

This plan both could stabilize registered residence rice supply, maintaining social stability; and could guarantee investor's interest; also could alleviate fiscal distress situation; one stone three birds.

Xie Erren thought this Intelligence Agency spy really had two brushes! Was a talent in administration! Pity now he was still Political Security Bureau’s hidden cadre, couldn't reuse. However, he still somewhat worried:

"Just this way, registered residence rice quota equals less one third; next time rationing don't know when to come..."

"Right now front line war affairs smooth; as long as able to support pass one or two months, Guangxi pacified, grain from Guangxi side will come over. Even if can't come, rural summer grain around Wuzhou soon to appear on stage; as long as grasping tight collecting Reasonable Burden, won't lack grain. Further down, is autumn harvest..."

"In past days could Wuzhou surroundings collect grain?"

"Can," Luo Yangming said without hesitation, "I opened rice shop here for many years; August starting has summer grain appearing on stage; although not counting much, can also acquire quite a lot. Wuzhou's summer tax collected according to Ming system okay; adopting Reasonable Burden apportionment collecting okay..."

Xie Erren heart moved; how did self forget "Imperial Grain National Tax"!
