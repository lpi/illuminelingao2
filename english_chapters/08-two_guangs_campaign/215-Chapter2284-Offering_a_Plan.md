# Chapter 2284: Offering a Plan

Luo Yangming didn't press further. He thought to himself that Teng County had already been liberated—he need only ask Zhao Fengtian to send a letter there and Advisor Hao's background could be verified.

Ding A-tao asked instead, "Has something happened with Advisor Hao? Has he done something wrong?"

"No, no," Luo Yangming said. "I just see that he's quite capable—not like an ordinary scholar. With all the chaos of war, it would be safer to have the Australians check on him."

These words alarmed Ding A-tao. She had always had a favorable impression of Master Hao, and moreover, her best friend had introduced him. Her husband now held an official position; if the investigation turned up anything "irregular," it would be embarrassing for everyone. Early the next morning, she quietly wrote a note, sealed it properly, and gave it to Wen Yun, asking her to bring some simple gifts to the Jiang household.

"Tell Miss Jiang that these gifts are in return for the Australian pastries she sent last time. There's also a letter here—hand it to her personally. Understood?"

After Wen Yun left, Ding A-tao felt somewhat uneasy. A few days earlier, the city had arrested several "bandits" who were said to be spies sent by the Ming government. All had been publicly beheaded. Since Prefect Xie had taken office, he had rarely executed anyone; suddenly beheading several at once was unprecedented. Could it be that the situation outside had become unstable again?

She thought of sharing her worries with Li Wensheng, but the old shopkeeper always offered nothing but empty reassurances. And like herself, he had lived in the city for so long that he probably knew no more about what was happening outside than she did...

She suddenly thought of Wen Iron Head. That boatman and his crew were now running boats for the Australians on the river; he ought to know more. She might as well ask him when she had the chance.

News that Luo Yangming was inquiring into "Master Hao's" background made Jiang Qiuchan nervous. She knew Master Hao's true background all too well. Luo Yangming now held an official position; if he really pursued the investigation, the truth could hardly be concealed. If Yi Haoran's identity were exposed and he were hauled before the authorities, not only would his life be at risk, but the corpse in the dry well at her in-laws' house would come to light too—and then she herself could not escape involvement...

With this in mind, she took the opportunity of picking up her child from school to see Yi Haoran and quietly relay the news.

"...This Shopkeeper Luo, though a businessman, works very hard for the Australians. If he detects something and reports you to the authorities, it would be a disaster!"

Yi Haoran hadn't expected Employer Luo to be suspicious of him. He asked a few more questions and roughly guessed that his "offering a plan" must have attracted the man's attention.

A miscalculation, he thought. He hadn't expected Luo Yangming to be so shrewd. But he also found this curious: typically, businessmen adhered to the principle of "the less trouble, the better." Even if they noticed something suspicious, they would most likely pretend ignorance. Why would Luo think of involving the authorities? Yi Haoran had done nothing to wrong his household.

His suspicion aroused, he suddenly recalled what Chang Qingyun had told him: that the Australians had "spies and informants scattered everywhere." Could Luo Yangming be one of the Australians' spies as well?

While he was contemplating this, Qiuchan whispered, "Perhaps you should lie low for a while, Master Hao. The road to Teng County is open now. You could say you want to go home, quickly resign your position, and head for Teng County. My in-laws are right in Teng County—a prominent family. I'll write you a letter of introduction. You can take refuge there temporarily."

"Teng County is also in the Hair thieves' hands now. If Luo Yangming really wants to investigate, it's just a matter of sending a document." Yi Haoran shook his head. "And if I leave now, wouldn't that immediately confirm his suspicions?"

"Then..."

"I've been law-abiding and well-behaved here in Wuzhou. Luo Yangming is busy with the grain transfer right now; at this critical juncture, he probably can't spare attention for this." Yi Haoran knew that fleeing immediately would be safest, but he couldn't abandon a plan he had been developing for so long. He was the coordinator of this conspiracy; if he ran, the entire enterprise would be ruined.

He thought it over and felt safe for the moment; Luo Yangming might not actually investigate anything. But seeing the panic on the woman before him, he felt he should calm her fears—lest her anxiety betray them.

"Don't worry," he said reassuringly. "The worst crime I could be charged with is having been on Xiong Wencan's staff—and I was no important figure in his Shogunate. Even if they catch me, it just means a few days squatting in Sanheui. It won't cost me my life. As for other matters, you needn't worry at all. Oh, and your brother's situation is looking promising. Within three to five days, there should be an answer from Senator Xie's office."

He explained his "offering a plan" idea and continued, "Shopkeeper Luo was suffering from a shortage of funds; he'll have to use this method. Go back and tell your brother to make contact as soon as possible so he can seize the opportunity!"

"My brother's business isn't urgent—what matters is you, Sir..." Jiang Qiuchan still felt uneasy. Yi Haoran thought quickly and said, "When you go to attend Cai Lan, mention this to her—no, don't ask her to intervene. Just ask her to keep an ear out for any news and let you know immediately..."

Realizing she still had Cai Lan as an ally reassured Qiuchan somewhat. "I'll speak with her tomorrow when I go to the mansion!"

---

"Master Hao said this?" Cai Lan asked quietly.

"Yes!" Jiang Qiuchan was somewhat nervous. "I beg you, sister, to keep an eye out. If anything changes, please give us some advance warning."

"I understand." Cai Lan nodded. "Don't be afraid. Whatever happens, I'll handle it."

With these words from Cai Lan, Jiang Qiuchan naturally felt reassured. Ever since Cai Lan's visit to Dragon Mother Temple, her attitude toward Senator Xie had changed noticeably. As the saying went: *When a man chases a woman, they're separated by a mountain; when a woman chases a man, only a paper screen lies between.* When a woman set her heart on a man, he rarely escaped the gentle trap. Senator Xie was busy with work and starved for the tenderness between man and woman. Though Cai Lan came from a humble background, she had mastered all the traditional womanly arts; she could manage a household and work in the kitchen. Now she personally prepared soup and tended to his comforts every day, and even did his mending. The servant women whispered among themselves that the young miss had finally accepted her fate.

With such devoted attention, Senator Xie now came to the Three Headquarters to stay overnight nearly every evening. Sometimes, when "the spring night is all too brief," he rose late and simply worked there during the day as well. The administrative center of Wuzhou was gradually shifting toward the Three Headquarters. Cai Lan's "exclusive favor" was blazing hot. At any critical moment, if she were willing to intercede, she could turn misfortune into blessing.

Zhao Fengtian, however, didn't quite approve of this shift. Though the Three Headquarters housed many organizations and stationed troops, the compound was several times larger than the Prefecture Yamen. The garrison was mostly National Army, which was less than ideal for strict security.

But Xie Erren didn't mind. This was Wuzhou's "city within a city"; hundreds of National Army soldiers and naturalized civilian cadres surrounded it. If this place wasn't safe, where would be? He simply laughed off Zhao Fengtian's concerns.

Luo Yangming came to present his "fundraising for grain" proposal. Xie Erren listened and found it reasonable, then asked:

"These merchants—they'll want dividends if they're putting up money. But the whole point of selling this rice is to stabilize prices. How much dividend can we offer them?"

"I've done preliminary calculations. The cost of this batch of brown rice arriving in Wuzhou is one tael three mace per *dan*." Luo Yangming took out his notebook. "If the city sells it at cost as ration rice, we can only charge one tael five mace per *dan*—a profit of just two mace per *dan*. Ten thousand *dan* would yield only two thousand taels of silver."

"The merchants will definitely refuse." Xie Erren nodded. "I understand. They expect at least fifty percent profit."

"Yes," Luo Yangming said. "But conditions are generally poor right now. Silver sitting idle earns nothing. We can push them a bit."

"Pushing a bit is easy enough. But the next time we ask them for money, they might not be so willing." Xie Erren hesitated.

Luo Yangming said, "I actually have an idea, but the Chief will need to decide."

"Let's hear it."

Luo Yangming's proposal wasn't unusual: after the ten thousand *dan* of grain arrived, six thousand *dan* would be allocated as ration rice, and the remaining three thousand *dan* would be sold at the current "market ceiling price."

Seven thousand *dan* of rice at fair prices could support Wuzhou's grain consumption for a month. The "market ceiling price" for retail sales was currently two taels eight mace.

"...This grain wouldn't be released in bulk, but distributed to various grain shops to sell on commission. After sales are complete, dividends would be distributed according to each investor's contribution. The grain shops acting as agents would take a commission of one mace per *dan* sold."

This way, three thousand *dan* of rice would yield four thousand five hundred taels in profit. Deducting three hundred taels in commission fees still left a net profit of four thousand one hundred taels—enough to pay investors their returns, with a portion left over for the City Government's funds. The City Government's current financial straits were another constant headache for Xie Erren.

This plan would stabilize the ration rice supply, maintaining social order; guarantee investor returns; and alleviate fiscal difficulties—killing three birds with one stone.

Xie Erren thought to himself that this Intelligence Agency spy really had talent! A genuine administrator! A pity he was still an undercover Political Security Bureau cadre and couldn't be openly employed. Still, Xie Erren had some concerns:

"But this way, the ration rice quota is reduced by a third. Who knows when the next shipment will arrive..."

"Right now the front lines are going smoothly. If we can just hold out for another month or two, Guangxi will be pacified and grain from that side will flow in. Even if it doesn't, the summer harvest from the countryside around Wuzhou will soon be ready. As long as we manage the Reasonable Burden collection properly, we won't lack grain. And after that comes the autumn harvest..."

"Have we been able to collect grain from the Wuzhou area recently?"

"Yes," Luo Yangming said without hesitation. "I've run a rice shop here for many years. Starting in August, summer grain comes to market. Though it's not a huge amount, we can acquire quite a lot. Wuzhou's summer tax can be collected according to the Ming system, or we can adopt the Reasonable Burden levy..."

Xie Erren's heart stirred. How had he forgotten about "Imperial Grain and National Taxes"?
