# Chapter 2214 - Brotherly Loyalty

"It's no trouble. I will speak with Secretary Bi myself. I'm sure he will be pleased."

Zhan Zhekun piled on further flattery, extolling Bi Xuansheng as a "brilliant young talent" who would surely "accomplish great things" and "assist *Bazong* Feng to rise to greatness." Not only did this puff up Feng Haijiao, who now fancied he had recruited some prodigy, but even Bi Xuansheng half-believed it himself.

Now that he was officially a soldier, titles had to be distributed. Feng Haijiao appointed his dozen-odd head men as "Squad Commanders" and "Platoon Commanders," then threw a feast for the entire gang. Only the commoners of Qinglian Market suffered, saddled with still more "contributions."

At the banquet, Zhan Zhekun and Bi Xuansheng ladled on flattery until Feng Haijiao forgot all bounds, repeatedly boasting that he would seize Yangshan county seat and show Governor-General Xiong his mettle.

Having assumed the rank of *bazong*, Feng Haijiao raised his banner at Qinglian Market and began "recruiting soldiers and acquiring horses." He dispatched men to the surrounding villages demanding they "contribute grain and pay." In the midst of this activity, someone reported that Sun Dabiao of Dalang Market had sent a man with an invitation: "*Bazong* Feng is requested to come and discuss business."

In the past, when Sun Dabiao "requested," Feng Haijiao would set out at once—Sun Dabiao was the wealthiest of the three sworn brothers. When Feng's "business" was slow and he was short of pay and provisions, he often had to beg his "Elder Brother" for help. Any large spoils also had to be fenced through him.

But now Feng Haijiao had grown arrogant. He was an "official." Sun Dabiao, a mere "commoner," should come to him, not the other way around. Besides, Sun Dabiao had not even congratulated him on his new post—how tactless! Feeling aggrieved, he refused to see the messenger: "Tell him that I am occupied with official duties. If he has business, he may come here to discuss it."

His subordinate assented and was about to withdraw when Bi Xuansheng said: "Wait!" He stopped the man and turned to Feng Haijiao: "Master, I hear this Master Sun is your sworn brother?"

Before coming here, Bi Xuansheng had gathered considerable intelligence from Xie Wendong—especially on Feng Haijiao's background. He knew exactly who Sun Dabiao was.

"That's right. He's elder by age; I call him Elder Brother."

"In that case, your reply may be... inadvisable..."

"F*** your mother—what's inadvisable?!" Feng Haijiao had pegged Bi Xuansheng as a smooth-talking pedant whose eloquence had prompted him on a whim to make the man his "secretary." Now this single word "inadvisable" rubbed him the wrong way. He glared at Bi Xuansheng as if to say, *If you can't explain yourself, I'll have your head.*

Bi Xuansheng was genuinely frightened, but he knew that backing down now would mark him as a weakling—making it even harder to speak up later. He cleared his throat and feigned composure: "Master, you now hold an official post—you are not an ordinary man. But since you and Master Sun have sworn brotherhood, you are brothers bound to live and die together. The word 'loyalty' must be observed. If word of this spreads, those who understand will say it is a matter of rank; those who do not will say you lack loyalty..."

"Me? Lacking loyalty?" Feng Haijiao was, after all, a *jianghu* man. The mere suggestion of a "disloyal" reputation softened him, though he continued to bluster. Bi Xuansheng pressed the advantage: "Now that you are an imperial officer, Master, you surely seek great accomplishments. They say it takes brothers to fight a tiger. Master Sun is your sworn elder brother; if you can win him over, he would be an immense asset. I beg you to reconsider."

Feng Haijiao's mind turned. Bi Xuansheng had a point. Though his sworn brother had been battered by the Yao and lost heavily, he was still a centipede that dies but never falls—he had men and resources. Offending him served no purpose; winning him over would be helpful. His anger turned to delight; he clapped Bi Xuansheng heavily on the shoulder: "No wonder they say scholars are full of cunning ideas—you really do have insight!"

Bi Xuansheng's shoulder ached from the blow. Inwardly he cursed the "ruffian," but outwardly he maintained a calm expression: "Not at all—it is the Master's farsightedness and openness to counsel."

"Very well. I shall condescend... just this once." Feng Haijiao stood, paced, and told his attendant: "Tell the messenger I will come tomorrow. Have him prepare wine and meat."

From Qinglian Market to Dalang Market was only half a day overland. In the past, they often visited without fanfare—bringing only a few followers for protection against enemies or Yao raiders. Usually, they walked; sometimes they used a simple two-man sedan chair.

This time, Feng Haijiao wanted to make an impression—his first outing since becoming an officer. A proper entourage was essential. A sedan chair was too shabby, but such things were rare in Yangshan: decent palanquins could be found only in the county seat or among local gentry, not in a bandit's nest like Qinglian Market.

Feng Haijiao eyed the decrepit palanquin his men had scrounged with displeasure. Once again, Bi Xuansheng was quick: "Master, you are now an imperial military officer. By regulation, you should ride a horse. Forget the palanquin."

Horses they did have. They selected the most spirited steed; now Feng Haijiao had a mount. Behind the horse came a red silk canopy and a name-banner; a few dozen lackeys formed an escort. At the front, imitating the magistrate's procession, they found a brass gong and beat out the rhythm of "Make way, soldiers and civilians!" The cavalcade set off in grand style.

The spectacle was imposing. Yangshan's roads were already nearly deserted after the Yao uprising; once Feng Haijiao's procession appeared, not a single traveler remained.

As Feng Haijiao marched, he posted his "proclamations" everywhere. This was Bi Xuansheng's idea—the only way for the populace to learn that Feng Haijiao was now an imperial officer, which would facilitate levying grain and pay.

"...If any refuse even after the proclamation is posted, slaughter a few to make an example!" Bi Xuansheng said.

"I hadn't realized that for your young age, you've got some ruthlessness in you." Feng Haijiao was impressed.

"Not at all—it is the Master's tiger-like authority." Bi Xuansheng bowed his head in reply, inwardly laughing: *This puts him on the fire. Now that he's the lightning rod, the Hair-Clippers' attention will be drawn to him, and Master Yang can buy a bit more breathing room.*

Wherever they encountered a village or town, they demanded "grain and pay." Larger settlements with stockades closed their gates and refused entry; smaller ones suffered—every stop, they extorted grain and provisions; even the poorest lost a few chickens and ducks.

Traveling at this pace, progress was slow. What should have been an overnight journey stretched into the following noon. Sun Dabiao and Zhang Tianbo, fearing something had happened on the road, sent men to investigate.

The investigation revealed that their sworn brother had "become an official." Sun Dabiao immediately summoned the messenger he had sent earlier and berated him: Why hadn't he mentioned this? Was he deliberately withholding information? The messenger protested that he had never even seen "Second Master Feng"—he had only relayed messages through others. As for "Second Master Feng's" new post, no one had told him—and Qinglian Market had seemed normal.

"Normal? Are you blind?!" Sun Dabiao was livid. He threw the proclamation his men had brought back at the lackey's face. "He's posting proclamations all over! And you say everything's normal? Normal, my foot! Drag him out—forty strokes!"

The lackey wailed innocence but was hauled away and flogged mercilessly. Soon, cries of agony and pleas for mercy echoed from the courtyard. Still not satisfied, Sun Dabiao stepped onto the threshold and bellowed: "Hit him harder! Teach him to keep his eyes open! And his ears!"

He stomped back into the hall in a huff.

Zhang Tianbo understood his sworn brother's state of mind perfectly: They had intended to bring Feng Haijiao along to submit to the Hair-Clippers. Instead, Feng had preemptively accepted Ming's pacification! Though people like them didn't much care whose pacification they received, Feng Haijiao had been utterly disloyal—accepting a "*bazong*" title without a word to his brothers! Now Sun Dabiao's bargaining chips with the Australians had shrunk dramatically.

Zhang Tianbo, too, was annoyed with his "Second Brother," but the deed was done. Venting anger served no purpose. He urged: "Elder Brother! Now that Second Brother has accepted the court's pacification, fuming does no good. Let us think of a countermove. When he arrives, how do we speak? Where do we stand?"

"Where do we stand? Do I open the middle gate to receive him? Kneel and call myself 'commoner'?" Sun Dabiao spat. "XTLM—this Feng Haijiao is a piece of work! And I swore brotherhood with him! Now that he's pulled this stunt, how can we even talk about the Hair-Clipper pacification? Even if we do get pacified, and the Australians order me to suppress him, do I do it or not?! How could Feng Haijiao be so reckless!"

Zhang Tianbo soothed him: "Elder Brother, don't be angry! At least Second Brother came—that still shows some brotherly loyalty. Let's not haggle for now; let's hear what he has to say."

"I suppose that's all we can do." Sun Dabiao was dejected, but resentment churned within: Ming had been generous with his sworn brother—handing out a *bazong* just like that! The Australians, on the other hand, had only offered a *baojia* headman's position—the difference was like heaven and earth! He seethed with envy, jealousy, and fury toward both Feng Haijiao and the Australians.

Zhang Tianbo's thoughts were different. He realized their situation was now delicate. Feng Haijiao had not only accepted Ming's pacification but was flaunting it openly. Whether or not that was his original intent, he had openly declared war on the Hair-Clippers. Pacifying Feng was now highly unlikely.

With Sun Dabiao's strength depleted and Feng Haijiao's support gone, extracting better terms from the Australians had become far more difficult.
