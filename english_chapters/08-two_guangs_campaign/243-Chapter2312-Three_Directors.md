# Chapter 2312 - Three Directors

"These proposals, reports, and applications involve various matters, but the core is all about the resource allocation of our department. And without exception, more than 90% were vetoed. Many were directly vetoed at the General Assembly and Standing Committee meetings. So, these vetoes represent the will of the Senate."

Ma Jia was puzzled for a dozen seconds before he understood; many forgotten past events flooded into his mind. He smiled:

"No wonder you were so keen on drafting various reports, memorandums, and proposals for me to submit after the Lingao Disturbance! You clearly knew that everyone had opinions about us back then, and nine out of ten sent up would be waste paper. So the foreshadowing was here."

Zhao Manxiong nodded: "Comrades are very sensitive to matters concerning the freedom and power of Senators, and their natural distrust of us is understandable. We don't care about comrades' misunderstandings—in short, our work is worthy of the Senate." He said slowly, "Everyone's distrust is one thing, but the work that needs to be done still must be done."

"Old Wang!" While Ai Zhixin called out to Wang Qiyi, who was engaging in getting off work, in high spirits, "Shall we have a meeting in the conference room in five minutes?"

Although the tone was inquiring, Wang Qiyi knew this was a notification, not a consultation. He said helplessly: "Alright."

Today was originally the rest day for his eldest daughter Wang Muqing to come home from Foshan. From his daughter's previous letters, Wang Qiyi learned about the current situation in Foshan and the various conflicts between young Senators arising from work. His daughter's low mood could also be seen at a glance.

To be honest, this wasn't too unexpected for Wang Qiyi. After all, in the years at Fangcaodi (Aroma Grassland) School, the young Senators were all classmates. They all "came on the same boat," so they were born with an intimacy close to siblings. Now suddenly stepping into administrative posts, conflicts arising from different concepts were inevitable—the impact and tearing sense caused by this incompatibility of three views far exceeded those small conflicts during school days.

Today he originally wanted to get off work earlier, first "wash the dust" for his daughter with his wife, and then have a good talk with his daughter in the evening. Listen to her confusion and give some guidance on work and dealing with people. For this matter, Zhang Xiaoqi specifically left early and went back to the dormitory.

Ai Zhixin suddenly inviting him to a meeting couldn't be for some trivial matter; something important must have happened to discuss with him.

Could it be that there was new information on the counterfeit currency case? Counterfeit currency in the market had suddenly increased recently. Although it was mostly used in relatively remote rural areas and would be exposed at a glance during the day, in relatively remote local markets, utilizing the common people's unfamiliarity with circulation coupons, it spread quite widely.

Although the Economic Crime Investigation Division of the Police and the Finance and Tax Bureau had seized quite a few personnel trafficking and using counterfeit currency recently, the source of this counterfeit currency could never be found.

He organized the documents on the table properly and locked them in the safe. Picking up his thermos cup brewing the "Senator Health Tea" specially supplied by Runshitang, he went to the conference room.

As soon as he entered the conference room, he was stunned. His wife Zhang Xiaoqi was also there—what was going on?

"Sorry, the matter is urgent. So I specially sent someone to invite Deputy Director Zhang as well. Hope I didn't delay your business..."

"I'm still waiting to pick up my daughter to go home for dinner. If Director Ai has something, say it quickly," Zhang Xiaoqi said impatiently.

"You guys look at this report first." Ai Zhixin pretended to be mysterious and took out a document from a kraft paper bag.

Zhang Xiaoqi didn't take it at all, pouting to signal Wang Qiyi to take it. Deputy Director Wang hurriedly bowed and stood up to take the document. He was startled as soon as he saw the header. He quickly sat down and read the document from beginning to end. He seemed a bit disallowed to believe it, so he read it again from the beginning. It took a long time before he put it down and said: "Is this true?!"

"Xie Erren wrote this himself, how could it be fake?" Ai Zhixin said.

"This counts as big news! The first time since the Senate created the world." Wang Qiyi was too surprised. A Senator was actually surprise-attacked and captured by the enemy within an occupied prefectural city. This was a terrific major event! It wouldn't be excessive to call it the number one scandal.

"At least he wasn't taken away. If he were really taken away, who knows how many variables would be added!" Ai Zhixin said.

Zhang Xiaoqi listened inexplicably. She couldn't wait for Wang Qiyi's explanation anymore and hurriedly picked up the document to read.

"What is going on with this Xie Erren?" After finishing reading, she couldn't help commenting, "We met him before he went to Wuzhou. He spoke well and logically. He also had quite a few ideas when we discussed finance and taxation; he wasn't a mediocrity. How did he fall to such a state?"

"According to his report, the military strength in the city was insufficient, giving the enemy a loophole—that batch of grain from a few days ago became the tool for the enemy to lure the tiger from the mountain. Fortune truly toys with people!" Wang Qiyi sighed. This batch of grain was procured by the Finance and Tax Bureau, costing quite some effort at the time.

"Insufficient military strength in the city is certainly a fact, but here is another report." Ai Zhixin took out another document. "This was sent by the Tax Special Commissioner we sent to Wuzhou, delivered back by a special messenger."

"Damn, what are you being so mysterious about." Wang Qiyi took it and flipped through it. His face underwent the change just now once again.

"F*ck, what is this matter!" He couldn't help cursing aloud.

"What is it?" Zhang Xiaoqi frowned.

"See for yourself! This Xie Erren is simply comparable to Old Zhang!" Wang Qiyi said, "The hat of 'Disgrace of the Senate' is going to be worn by him!"

Zhang Xiaoqi's face became very ugly after reading. She put down the report and asked Ai Zhixin: "Director Ai, is this news reliable?"

"Of course reliable," Ai Zhixin said. "Of course, this is a private memorandum written by our Tax Special Commissioner. It belongs to our Bureau's documents. Whether it can be made public is in our hands, unless..."

"Unless the Senate wants to investigate this matter." Wang Qiyi interjected.

"Exactly." Ai Zhixin nodded. "If this document gets out, Xie Erren is completely finished. I'm afraid he will be dismissed and recalled immediately, and then criticized in a hearing."

"Immediate dismissal, I don't think so." Zhang Xiaoqi shook her head. "He has worked in Wuzhou for so long after all and is familiar with the local situation. Most likely he will be retained for a period of time—but being sidelined in the future is certain."

"No matter how it's handled, this ending probably won't be much better than Old Zhang's." Ai Zhixin plopped onto the sofa. "The Senate hates people who make mistakes over women the most..."

Wang Qiyi coughed quickly, and Ai Zhixin stopped expanding on the topic immediately.

Zhang Xiaoqi frowned and said, "We don't need to care what mistake he made. What about this memorandum?"

Wang Qiyi didn't make a sound. After a long silence, he said: "Throwing this memorandum out is a heavy bomb; Xie Erren would be completely finished. My personal opinion is to cure the sickness to save the patient—he counts as a qualified dispatched local Senator; talent is hard to come by."

Ai Zhixin nodded and said, "Currently the Senate hasn't said they want to investigate him. In my opinion, we don't need to report this memorandum temporarily—just archive it as a general memorandum—anyway, this kind of memorandum is sent to us every week."

Cooperation between Senators dispatched to local areas and the Finance and Tax Bureau was generally pleasant—after all, they not only controlled the allocation of funds but also bore the work of rebuilding the tax system for the local government. They were out-and-out "Gods of Wealth." From any angle, the Finance and Tax Bureau had no need to "beat a drowning dog."

"I'm afraid this matter isn't that simple." Zhang Xiaoqi frowned. "Don't forget, there are quite a few vertically managed departments in Wuzhou. Especially that Political Security Bureau whose eyes and ears are everywhere. They definitely have people in Wuzhou. By now, probably even more detailed reports have already arrived in Lingao!"

"Whether they want to report is their business. We can't help if they want to be the bad guys..." Ai Zhixin spread his hands. "It's just Xie Erren's bad luck."

In the end, this matter had no conflict of interest with the Finance and Tax Bureau. They had no grudge or enmity with Xie Erren, nor any special friendship or interest involved.

"In my opinion, that old fox Zhao Manxiong may not necessarily bring out the material." Wang Qiyi said leisurely, "Maybe he wants to cover it up even more."

"Oh?" Ai Zhixin became interested.

"We actually know the situation in Wuzhou very well. Wuzhou is now just an empty shell." Wang Qiyi was very interested in Wuzhou, the gateway to Liangguang, considering it one of the important growth points for Guangdong's fiscal revenue. He had been paying attention to the layout in Wuzhou and knew the situation there relatively well.

"Take the garrison for example. It's said to be a battalion configuration for Wuzhou, plus a dedicated company. In reality, it was long transferred to pieces. Given Wuzhou's importance, what use is this little military strength?" Wang Qiyi said, "I don't need to mention the rest. The Political Security Bureau didn't even set up a branch bureau—they didn't take Wuzhou seriously at all."

"Speaking of which, Xie Erren being captured this time was mainly due to insider infiltration. Isn't counter-infiltration and counter-espionage the job of the Political Security Bureau?" Zhang Xiaoqi said, "In this matter, Zhao Manxiong and Wu Mu have seriously neglected their duties."

"It's just unprofessional. What professional work can a few cosplay enthusiasts do?" Ai Zhixin opened fire without scruples, incidentally puffing out his chest a bit, seemingly to show that he was the "professional."

"Professional or not, we don't understand. But I feel their interest in counter-espionage is far less than in surveillance." Wang Qiyi said somewhat playfully. He personally felt very uncomfortable about the Political Security Bureau—especially knowing they had Hidden Cadres among his Finance and Tax Bureau cadres.

Originally, the discussion of this matter would have ended here; it was nothing more than a few people roasting the situation. However, at this moment, Zhang Xiaoqi's eyes suddenly lit up, saying: "This is actually an opportunity!"

The two men in the room asked in unison: "What opportunity?"
