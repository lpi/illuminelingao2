# Chapter 2312 - Three Directors

"These proposals, reports, and applications cover various matters, but at their core, they all concern our department's resource allocation. And without exception, more than ninety percent were vetoed—many directly by the General Assembly and Standing Committee meetings. These vetoes represent the will of the Senate."

Ma Jia was puzzled for a dozen seconds before understanding dawned on him. Forgotten events flooded back into memory, and he smiled.

"No wonder you were so keen on drafting all those reports, memorandums, and proposals for me to submit after the Lingao Disturbance! You knew perfectly well that everyone had grievances against us back then, and nine out of ten submissions would be discarded as waste paper. So that's where you were laying the groundwork."

Zhao Manxiong nodded. "Our comrades are very sensitive to matters concerning Senators' freedom and power. Their natural distrust of us is understandable. We don't concern ourselves with their misunderstandings—in the end, our work is worthy of the Senate." He spoke slowly. "Everyone's distrust is one thing, but the work that needs doing must still be done."

"Old Wang!" Ai Zhixin called out to Wang Qiyi, who was preparing to leave for the day. "Can we have a meeting in the conference room in five minutes?"

Though the tone was questioning, Wang Qiyi knew this was a notification, not a consultation. He said resignedly, "Alright."

Today was supposed to be when his eldest daughter Wang Muqing came home from Foshan for rest leave. From her recent letters, Wang Qiyi had learned about the current situation there and the various conflicts arising among young Senators at work. Her low spirits were evident between the lines.

To be honest, this didn't surprise Wang Qiyi much. After all, during their years at Fangcaodi School, the young Senators had all been classmates. They had "come on the same boat," giving them a natural intimacy akin to siblings. Now, suddenly thrust into administrative posts, conflicts arising from different approaches were inevitable. The impact and tearing sense caused by this incompatibility of worldviews far exceeded those petty squabbles from school days.

He had originally planned to leave early today, first to welcome his daughter home for a "dust-washing" dinner with his wife, then to have a long conversation with her that evening—listening to her confusion and offering guidance on work and interpersonal relations. Zhang Xiaoqi had specifically left early to return to the dormitory for this purpose.

Ai Zhixin suddenly calling a meeting couldn't be for some trivial matter. Something important must have happened.

Could there be new information on the counterfeit currency case? Counterfeit circulation coupons had suddenly proliferated in the market recently. Though mostly used in relatively remote rural areas and easily detected in daylight, they had spread widely in outlying local markets by exploiting the common people's unfamiliarity with the new currency.

Although the Economic Crime Investigation Division and the Finance and Tax Bureau had apprehended numerous individuals trafficking and using counterfeit currency, the source remained elusive.

He organized the documents on his desk and locked them in the safe. Picking up his thermos cup brewing the "Senator Health Tea" specially supplied by Runshitang, he headed to the conference room.

As soon as he entered, he was stunned. His wife Zhang Xiaoqi was there too—what was going on?

"Sorry for the urgency. I had to send someone to invite Deputy Director Zhang as well. I hope I haven't disrupted your plans..."

"I'm supposed to pick up my daughter for dinner. If you have something to say, Director Ai, say it quickly," Zhang Xiaoqi said impatiently.

"Please take a look at this report first." Ai Zhixin produced a document from a kraft paper bag with theatrical mystery.

Zhang Xiaoqi didn't take it, instead gesturing for Wang Qiyi to receive it. Deputy Director Wang hastily stood and accepted the document. The moment he saw the header, he started. He quickly sat down and read the document from beginning to end. Seeming unable to believe it, he read through it again. A long moment passed before he set it down and said, "Is this true?!"

"Xie Erren wrote it himself—how could it be fake?" Ai Zhixin replied.

"This is major news! A first since the Senate founded its empire." Wang Qiyi was genuinely shocked. A Senator had been surprise-attacked and captured by the enemy inside an occupied prefectural city. This was an enormous scandal—calling it the number one disgrace wouldn't be excessive.

"At least he wasn't taken away. If they'd actually carried him off, who knows how many complications would have followed!" Ai Zhixin said.

Zhang Xiaoqi listened with growing bewilderment. Unable to wait for Wang Qiyi's explanation, she hurriedly snatched up the document to read.

"What is going on with this Xie Erren?" she couldn't help commenting after finishing. "We met him before he went to Wuzhou. He spoke coherently and logically, had quite a few insights when we discussed finance and taxation—he was no mediocrity. How did he fall to such a state?"

"According to his report, the city's military strength was insufficient, giving the enemy an opening—that shipment of grain from a few days ago became the lure for drawing the tiger from the mountain. Fortune truly toys with people!" Wang Qiyi sighed. That grain had been procured by the Finance and Tax Bureau, costing considerable effort at the time.

"Insufficient military strength is certainly a fact, but here's another report." Ai Zhixin produced a second document. "This was sent by the Tax Special Commissioner we dispatched to Wuzhou, delivered by special messenger."

"Damn, what are you being so mysterious about?" Wang Qiyi took it and flipped through. His expression underwent the same transformation as before.

"What the hell is this?!" He couldn't help cursing aloud.

"What is it?" Zhang Xiaoqi frowned.

"See for yourself! This Xie Erren rivals Old Zhang! The title of 'Disgrace of the Senate' is going to land on his head!"

Zhang Xiaoqi's face turned ugly after reading. She set down the report and asked Ai Zhixin, "Director Ai, is this information reliable?"

"Absolutely," Ai Zhixin confirmed. "Of course, this is a private memorandum written by our Tax Special Commissioner. It belongs to our Bureau's internal documents. Whether it gets made public is in our hands, unless..."

"Unless the Senate decides to investigate," Wang Qiyi interjected.

"Exactly." Ai Zhixin nodded. "If this document gets out, Xie Erren is finished. He'll likely be dismissed and recalled immediately, then subjected to a hearing."

"I don't think immediate dismissal is likely." Zhang Xiaoqi shook her head. "He's worked in Wuzhou for quite some time now and knows the local situation. Most likely he'll be retained temporarily—but being sidelined afterward is certain."

"No matter how it's handled, this ending probably won't be much better than Old Zhang's." Ai Zhixin collapsed onto the sofa. "The Senate hates people who make mistakes over women the most..."

Wang Qiyi coughed sharply, and Ai Zhixin immediately stopped elaborating.

Zhang Xiaoqi frowned. "We don't need to concern ourselves with what mistake he made. What about this memorandum?"

Wang Qiyi was silent for a long moment before speaking. "Releasing this memorandum would be a heavy bomb—Xie Erren would be completely finished. Personally, I believe in curing the illness to save the patient. He's been a qualified dispatched local Senator—talent is hard to come by."

Ai Zhixin nodded. "Currently the Senate hasn't indicated they want to investigate him. In my view, we don't need to report this memorandum for now—just archive it as a routine memo. These weekly reports arrive from everywhere anyway."

Cooperation between locally dispatched Senators and the Finance and Tax Bureau was generally pleasant—after all, they not only controlled fund allocation but also bore responsibility for rebuilding the tax system for local governments. They were, in every sense, "Gods of Wealth." From any angle, the Bureau had no reason to "beat a drowning dog."

"I'm afraid this matter isn't so simple." Zhang Xiaoqi frowned. "Don't forget, there are quite a few vertically managed departments in Wuzhou—especially the Political Security Bureau, with eyes and ears everywhere. They definitely have people in Wuzhou. By now, even more detailed reports have probably already reached Lingao!"

"Whether they want to report is their business. We can't help it if they want to play the villain..." Ai Zhixin spread his hands. "It's just Xie Erren's bad luck."

In the end, this matter had no conflict of interest with the Finance and Tax Bureau. They had no grudge against Xie Erren, nor any special friendship or stake involved.

"In my opinion, that old fox Zhao Manxiong may not necessarily release the material," Wang Qiyi said thoughtfully. "Perhaps he wants to bury it even more than we do."

"Oh?" Ai Zhixin's interest was piqued.

"We actually know the situation in Wuzhou quite well. Wuzhou is just an empty shell right now." Wang Qiyi had long considered Wuzhou, the gateway between Liangguang, as one of the important growth points for Guangdong's fiscal revenue. He had been tracking developments there and knew the situation relatively well.

"Take the garrison, for example. It's supposedly a battalion configuration for Wuzhou, plus a dedicated company. In reality, it was long ago fragmented and transferred piecemeal. Given Wuzhou's importance, what use is such meager military strength?" Wang Qiyi continued. "I needn't mention the rest. The Political Security Bureau didn't even establish a branch office there—they didn't take Wuzhou seriously at all."

"Speaking of which, Xie Erren's capture was mainly due to insider infiltration. Isn't counter-infiltration and counter-espionage the Political Security Bureau's job?" Zhang Xiaoqi said. "In this matter, Zhao Manxiong and Wu Mu were seriously derelict in their duties."

"Just unprofessional. What professional work can a few cosplay enthusiasts do?" Ai Zhixin fired without restraint, puffing out his chest slightly as if to demonstrate that he was the "professional."

"Professional or not, we wouldn't understand. But I get the sense their interest in counter-espionage falls far below their enthusiasm for surveillance." Wang Qiyi spoke with a hint of sarcasm. He personally felt very uncomfortable about the Political Security Bureau—especially knowing they had Hidden Cadres planted among his Finance and Tax Bureau staff.

Ordinarily, their discussion of this matter would have ended there—nothing more than a few people venting about the situation. But at that moment, Zhang Xiaoqi's eyes suddenly lit up. "This is actually an opportunity!"

Both men asked in unison: "What opportunity?"
