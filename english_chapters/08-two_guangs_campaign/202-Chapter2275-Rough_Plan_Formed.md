# Chapter 2275: Rough Plan Formed

Luo Yangming, as a member of the Aftermath Bureau, knew the current situation of Wuzhou best. The shortage of grain was secondary; the key problem was the interruption of trade—before taking Guangxi, this was a deadlock.

Wuzhou's rise and foundation relied entirely on trade. Without trade, many city residents fell into a state of unemployment. To stabilize the situation, Xie Erren did not allow shops to close, nor allowed reducing staff, and even forced shops and workshops to open for business every day, saying it was to "maintain the market surface."

Luo Yangming naturally understood Senator Xie's difficulties—this was to maintain stability. But this stability was very reluctant, relying entirely on the constant blood transfusion from the Senate and the Aftermath Bureau.

Merchants inside the city had been tormented once by Xiong Wencan. After Xie Erren entered the city, a series of aftermath measures also spent a lot of money and grain. Plus the soaring prices of all goods, inside and outside Wuzhou city, except for the homeless relying on relief to live, common people in the marketplace all had complaints. Luo Yangming saw it in his eyes and was anxious in his heart.

However, the Senate in Wuzhou, even with thousands of skills and ten thousand clever plans, couldn't solve this fundamental problem. Right now, besides maintaining as much as possible and waiting for the situation to improve, there was no other way.

The two talked about some details again. Zhu Fuyuan then took his leave.

"...Is it returning to Sanshui right now, or..."

"I still have to stay in Wuzhou for a few days." Zhu Fuyuan said, "Staying at Maoyuan Inn in the west of the city."

Luo Yangming knew Zhu Fuyuan nine out of ten had other missions. It was inconvenient to ask more, so he saw him out.

Yi Haoran was reckoning accounts in the account room, but calculating in his heart what the guest from Dachang Rice Shop came here for. Leaving aside the Hair thief background of this rice shop, since it was a rice shop, what it did was naturally grain business. This Boss Zhu coming locally was probably also for grain.

Speaking of grain, Yi Haoran knew that right now grain was short in Wuzhou, and people's hearts in the marketplace were unstable. This Zhu Fuyuan's arrival was mostly related to this.

Could it be that Hair thieves on the Guangxi side had major progress? Yi Haoran’s heart suddenly lifted. Xiong Wencan had reached a desperate situation right now. Even if he could immediately recover Wuzhou, the Imperial Court probably would hardly forgive him for the fault of losing territory. Could it be that Viceroy Xiong surrendered under this desperate posture?!

Thinking carefully, it was not impossible. Yi Haoran read Military Geography Records familiarly, knowing deeply that Wuzhou was not only the gateway to Guangdong but also one of the vital points of Guangxi. Communication between Xijiang basin and the interior mainly relied on this water transport line of Wuzhou-Lijiang-Lingqu-Hunan. After the Fubo Army occupied Wuzhou, they effectively cut the main artery of communication between interior Ming troops and Guangxi Ming troops directly. Although there were still a few roads from inland to Guangxi, in terms of convenience and cheapness, they were far inferior to this water transport line. If Guangxi Ming troops couldn't recover Wuzhou, even with an army of a hundred thousand, they could only be trapped in Guangxi, unable to move.

In the desperate situation where both personal and Guangxi futures were hopeless, if Xiong Wencan was unwilling to commit suicide to martyr for the country, indeed there was only the road of surrender to walk.

Yi Haoran’s heart tightened at once. If so, Two Guangs would be beyond redemption!

However, he was powerless regarding Xiong Wencan’s movements and the overall situation of Two Guangs. Yi Haoran felt a strong sense of frustration in his heart at this moment. Even if he had divine plans and clever calculations, being able to kill one True Australian, what help would it be to the overall situation?

Thinking of this, he unconsciously felt somewhat irritable. Suddenly a thought arose in him. He had long heard Chang Qingyun say that the status of True Australians was incomparably noble, even more prominent than Qinwang of Daming—after all, Qinwang could not interfere in politics, while Australian True Senators could solidly manage and discuss politics. If he could capture a True Australian alive in Wuzhou and take him to Guangxi, Hair thieves would inevitably hold back like shying at shooting a rat for fear of breaking the vase. Whether the Imperial Court fought or made peace, there would be a bargaining chip in hand.

Wanting to capture a True Australian alive, if it were a second person, they would probably think he was indulging in wild fantasy. Although Xie Erren did not live in deep seclusion, his guards were strict. Because Cai Lan assassinated him back then, he also knew he was not so loved by people. Not only did the number of outings reduce drastically, but every time he went out, he was also equipped with multiple guards.

Yi Haoran felt there was a chance. Because he had already grasped the line of Cai Lan through Jiang Qiuchan.

Although Jiang Qiuchan knew nothing of his intention, nor was he clear about Cai Lan's real thoughts right now. But with this line present, he virtually had eyes and ears that could reach directly to Xie Erren’s side.

Just doing so, he must let Qiuchan "join the gang." He himself couldn't get to Cai Lan's side, nor infer her thoughts.

Thinking of this, he unconsciously felt some hesitation. After all, this was a matter of extreme risk. Regardless of success or failure, Australians would inevitably investigate afterwards. He and Jiang Suo and others could just leave, but Qiuchan couldn't run away; nine out of ten she would lose her life.

Pondering again and again, Yi Haoran raised his head.

Never mind! Although Qiuchan was pitiable, her husband was dead, and she already extended heirs for the husband's family. She was originally a person who lost chastity; now having a chance to be loyal to the Imperial Court, in the future she wouldn't lack the glory of commendation... This honor after death was enough to compensate.

Thinking of this, Yi Haoran felt relaxed at once. Jiang Qiuchan was a very suitable person: she had studied, was a woman who understood reason and knew shame; whether being almost insulted or her husband being killed, both were caused by Hair thieves besieging the city; finally, expecting retreating soldiers back then showed she was calm and composed, not a timid and fearful person. Not to mention he had saved her back then—right, Chang Qingyun also saved her.

As long as explaining with great righteousness, for avenging national hatred and family grudge, she could be persuaded.

"Old friend, today have to trouble you." Yi Haoran was dressed as an accountant going to the countryside to collect accounts as usual.

Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly: "Still old friend, I'm almost becoming an old ghost." Seeing Yi Haoran’s grizzled beard and "awe-inspiring" righteousness, he couldn't help cursing secretly in his heart, how did he provoke such a madman! Seeking death himself wasn't enough, insisting on pulling someone as a cushion!

"Old friend, saying this you are forgetting your roots." Yi Haoran didn't mind, "Back then in the city if I didn't save you from death, you would have died in the hands of Wolf Troops long ago. Where could you still be a peaceful clerk here?"

"Okay okay, all my fault." Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly, "Sanheui was a parade ground in the past, now it's Australian captive camp. Inside besides people are houses, what is there to see?"

"Sanheui is the key lock outside Wuzhou city; naturally I want to take a good look." Yi Haoran said, "You just lead the way."

After Yi Haoran controlled Chang Qingyun, the first thing was to ask him to lead the way to Sanheui parade ground. In Yi Haoran’s view, the Sanheui captive camp was the biggest hidden danger for Australians. Such a place gathering several thousand people, only a few *li* away from Wuzhou; once a riot broke out, it could immediately affect Wuzhou and threaten Xijiang waterway.

Australians presumably knew this themselves too, so the first thing after entering the city was repairing the floating bridge. In case of emergency, they could quickly send troops to pacify.

"It is okay for me to take you in, only you have to listen to my instructions, don't speak or move indiscriminately. To avoid attracting suspicion." Chang Qingyun said helplessly, "On the Sanheui side, Australians have a company of National Army guarding—this doesn't matter much, they only manage perimeter guarding, ignoring matters inside entirely. But inside this camp there is also a Detective Team. This gang is mostly old scoundrels from the yamen in the past, sharp-eyed and black-hearted. If they spot a flaw, they will sell you upon turning around!"

"I understand." Yi Haoran nodded.

"Only this identity of yours is awkward..."

"No hindrance, I'll just go in using the identity of a rice shop accountant. There are many who know me in Wuzhou city; if making up an identity, it would be easy to cause suspicion instead."

"Using what reason to enter?"

"How about reminiscing about old times with you?"

"Cannot do! Cannot do!" Chang Qingyun waved hands wildly. His eyeballs rolled, saying: "Old Yi, did your employer handle military rice for government troops in Wuzhou back then?"

"As long as local grain merchants, which one didn't handle." Yi Haoran heard Li Wensheng and Madam talk about this many times, knowing not only the Luo family, grain merchants in the city all suffered big losses, hating Xiong Wencan and the government to the bone.

"Then you should know who specifically handled it at that time, right?"

Yi Haoran naturally knew; the name of the specific handler had long been cursed "to die a bad death" thousands of times by Ding A-tao.

"Know is knowing, but although he is life or death unknown, being Governor Xiong's trusted aide, probably ran away long ago..."

"That is it. Since you are an accountant, just say you heard this person was captured by Australians, specially coming to find him to collect debt."

Yi Haoran paused, clapping hands and laughing: "Old friend! You indeed have some devilish cleverness!"

"Where, where," Chang Qingyun sneered, "Almost becoming a ghost, still have to be somewhat clever?" He instructed, "Taking you in is easy, just have to adapt to circumstances inside, absolutely don't ruin matters!" He asked again: "Do you have prepared human affairs on you?"

"Human affairs? Heard Australians don't practice this..."

"Australians don't practice, but the stewards and little ghosts holding power inside are all local yamen scoundrels. I take you in originally as something that can't see light; without bribing a bit, they inevitably will make trouble."

"Old friend thinks thoughtfully, I did bring some silver money."

"If needing use, I naturally will remind you; just follow old rules."

The two spoke clearly, then walked across the floating bridge, coming towards Sanheui parade ground.

Sanheui was originally a sandbar washed out on the Gui River. After Wuzhou established the Viceroy of Two Guangs, to "pacify Yao," a large number of troops were stationed all year round. So a parade ground was set up at Sanheui, not only convenient for reviewing and training garrison troops but also a main camp for local garrison troops. Thousands of troops were stationed all year round.

So here there were not only martial arts hall, grand review platform, and parade ground, but also many barracks and living facilities. After occupying Wuzhou, this place became the main captive camp of the Guangxi frontline; captives transported from various places gathered here for detention and transit.

Given the resources in Xie Erren’s hands, he naturally couldn't conduct very thoughtful and detailed management of the captive camp. Could only use surrendered personnel to "self-manage," including maintaining order, distributing rations, organizing personnel labor, etc., all responsible by old clerks experienced in prefecture and county yamens in the past. Internal guard personnel were undertaken by retained personnel mainly consisting of Fast Class and Strong Class yamen runners.
