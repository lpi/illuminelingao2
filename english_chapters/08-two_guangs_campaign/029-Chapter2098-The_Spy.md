# Chapter 2098 - The Spy

A prolonged siege was impossible—Zhu Mingxia had no time to play the waiting game with Xiong Wencan.

Zhu Mingxia had not mentioned it, but since the enemy intended to burn the city down, he could just as easily strike with the same abandon: seal Wuzhou completely, then rain Hale rockets upon it.

They had long known from combat experience that a barrage of a hundred or more rockets was devastating to defender morale—enough to cause an entire army to rout almost instantly.

But doing so would inevitably bring calamity upon Wuzhou. Rockets bombarding the walls while the city was packed with incendiary materials would certainly result in a conflagration engulfing everything.

And then the stigma of cruelty would fall on the Council of Elders, not on Xiong Wencan.

Now the four of them had to vote on this very issue: Should they delay the assault and let Xiong Wencan play the butcher, or should they seize the initiative on the battlefield, leveraging their superior weaponry to deliver a thunderbolt strike and swiftly capture Wuzhou?

First to speak was his old subordinate, Zhu Quanxing, who supported using rocket bombardment. He said, "It's not as if we haven't set fires before. When we burned down the Wuyang Postal Station, I don't recall the people of Guangzhou holding a grudge. As long as we move fast and exploit the chaos caused by the rockets to take Wuzhou quickly, their arson plan has no chance of succeeding."

Xu Ke disagreed: "Back then, the natives saw us as nothing more than pirates. Now we're the legitimate successors of Chinese civilization. We can't descend to the same inhuman depths as Xiong Wencan."

In truth, Xu Ke had no desire to see Wuzhou reduced to ashes. Over these years since the transmigration, he had witnessed far too much death and suffering. But when it came to military matters, he always hoped to stand on the side of justice.

Zhu Mingxia said, "We can strive to avoid setting fires. But if fire is unavoidable, the initiative to light it should rest with us. Our soldiers mustn't die in vain because of the enemy's schemes. Only through a swift and decisive victory can we minimize casualties among both civilians and troops!"

"Shijie!" Jiang Suo let out a sharp cry and sat up with a start.

"Sir!" A soldier came running over, concern in his voice. "What's wrong?"

Jiang Suo slowly came back to his senses, staring at the campfire before him. He had been having nightmares again.

The scene in the nightmare was always the same:

Shijie—his senior martial-sister—was hanging from the gallows erected in the threshing ground outside Master Luo's estate. The woman Jiang Suo had loved had become a cold, lifeless corpse.

Jiang Suo didn't know how many times he had dreamed of this scene, only to awaken drenched in cold sweat. Sometimes he would also dream of Uncle Zhou, who they said had been shot through the head—his eyeball flying out of its socket. Jiang Suo even dreamed of Master Luo. None of these dreams were good ones.

Countless times, the dead of Sanliang Market would stand before him in his dreams. Shijie would silently weep, not saying a word. This time, Jiang Suo dreamed of those dead again. He jerked awake by the fire, and the sheepskin blanket draped over him slid off.

"It's nothing. Any movement from the Australians?" Jiang Suo wiped his sweaty brow. The sky was still pitch black, but the morning star had already appeared. In no time at all, dawn would break.

"They've set up camp on Changzhou Island. No sign yet that they intend to land and attack the city."

"Keep watching. Report any movement to me immediately."

The Australian scouts had crept up to the position at the summit of Bangshan at dusk the day before, quietly dispatching several sentries. But they had been detected by concealed lookout posts he had placed, and the garrison had immediately returned fire. According to reports, several had been hit, but no bodies were left behind. Jiang Suo knew that dawn was minutes away. Soon, the Australians would launch their assault. And the Bangshan position—guardian of the Gui River waterway—would naturally be their first priority.

"Bring me something to eat." His stomach was already growling. The soldier acknowledged the order and soon brought back several lumps of cold, hard "battle rice" wrapped in reed leaves.

---

He had no chopsticks, so Jiang Suo shoveled the dried, stiff rice into his mouth with his fingers, chewing as he fixed his gaze tensely on the foot of the mountain.

Jiang Suo felt as if he had crossed into another lifetime. He had once been a traveling performer and martial artist. Later, he became a prisoner of the Australians. Later still, he became one of their soldiers. And now he stood against the Australians, ready to fight them head-on. In just a few years, Jiang Suo had experienced more than most people did in a lifetime.

Five years had passed. The beautiful face of Qingxia had grown blurry in Jiang Suo's memory; all that remained was the final twitching of her body as she was strung up on the gallows. He didn't know where Yunniang and the others had been sent by the Australians. Master Ban had vanished without a trace—whether he was even still alive, Jiang Suo had no idea.

As for him, after the Australians had seized and "purified" him, he had been exiled to a village on the southern coast. There, winter never came; it was always a sweltering summer. Half the villagers were exiles like him; the other half were migrants from the north.

The work was simple but grueling. They dried salt on the beach, fished the sea, and harvested seaweed. Though a road connected the village to the outside world, it was usually deserted—only the pitch-black utility poles and the iron wires strung between them stretched off into the distance. Standing at the village entrance, all that met the eye was the endless ocean. Once a month, the Australians' ships would arrive, bringing grain, mail, and daily necessities, and hauling away the salt and various sea goods they had gathered. Life was hard but peaceful.

The villagers naturally did not look down on him as an exile. Because he knew a bit of martial arts, they elected him captain of the militia. In that little village, Jiang Suo worked hard, and the people grew fond of him—and he grew fond of the village atmosphere. Once, when pirates attacked, he helped the villagers resist and held out until Australian reinforcements arrived. If it came to laying down his life for those villagers, Jiang Suo would not hesitate.

If not for those dreams that haunted him night after night, Jiang Suo might have settled down and taken root in that village. The village head's daughter was fond of him, and the head was happy to take him as a son-in-law. If not for those dreams, Jiang Suo would have married in that little village, fathered children, and lived out his days in quiet obscurity.

But the village was steeped in the Australians' presence. This was Australian territory. The village head was a "cadre" appointed by the Australians. Whether exiles or not, all migrants shaved their heads and wore "Australian clothing." The notices and newspapers printed by the Australians were posted on the walls of the village office. Even the words they used to speak to one another were "Newspeak" introduced by the Australians.

It drove Jiang Suo mad. Combined with the nightly dreams of his lost Qingxia, he teetered on the edge of breakdown. A wild thought seized him: perhaps if he killed a few Australians, he would stop dreaming of Qingxia, stop dreaming of the people hanged on the gallows in Sanliang Market. The villagers around him were all "false-hair" naturalized people; the true Australians were the Elders. And Jiang Suo knew that only by killing those true-hairs might he find release from his nightmares.

But killing a "true-hair" was no easy task! Elders seldom visited remote villages like this—it was merely one of many settlements on the southern coast of Qiongzhou Island, part of the Council of Elders' "human resource reservoir." Besides salt production, the village had almost no output or value. Although from time to time able-bodied men from the village would be conscripted and sent off somewhere to fell timber, mine ore, build dams, or dig canals—engaging in all manner of physical labor—even if one might encounter an Elder on such jobs, it was only a glimpse from afar. There was no way to get close.

After living in the village for several years, Jiang Suo gradually learned that there were only three paths to approach an Elder: enlist in the military, pass the examinations, or be recruited for work and then promoted. But the examinations were nearly impossible for him, and recruitment and promotion were equally dim prospects. The only route left was the military.

Every year, the village held recruitment drives, though the number of new soldiers was small—just a few each year. And most of them were assigned to the National Army, which Jiang Suo knew rarely saw combat; their duties were roughly equivalent to what the county *zhuangban* militia had done in the old days. The chances of encountering an Elder there were only slightly higher than now.

Moreover, each time the draft was held, Jiang Suo was never on the "eligible list"—because he was an exile, and by regulation, no exile could be drafted until after five years.

But for the Guangdong and Guangxi Campaign, conscription was opened across the Council's entire territory, and "exiles" like Jiang Suo—those who hadn't yet served five years—were included. The village head thought that staying on as a mere militia captain offered no future; better to try his luck in the army, where he might earn a proper career. If he died, well, his daughter could easily find another husband.

And so Jiang Suo enlisted. As fate would have it, because he had been drafted from a coastal fishing village, he was assigned to the Naval Infantry.

After several months of training, he was posted to the Pearl River Task Force, assigned as a marine attached to the detachment. They were stationed in Hong Kong, on standby to move on Guangdong at any moment.

During those waiting days, although Jiang Suo frequently saw Elder-officers, he never once threw caution to the wind and moved against them. He didn't know why he wanted to assassinate the Australians—was it revenge for Qingxia, or to escape the nightmares? He couldn't say. In all fairness, those Australian Elders were good people who cared for their men and shared in the hardships of the common soldiers. The people had benefited greatly from their benevolence. Especially his comrades—many of them had been pulled back from the brink of death by the Elders, given a second chance at life. Killing them would be an act of treachery. But wasn't their killing of Qingxia just as treacherous? Jiang Suo felt torn. Several times, when opportunity arose, he had hesitated. Without the urge to kill, Jiang Suo was a model soldier—hardworking in training, with a strong sense of discipline, highly regarded by the Elder-officers. But the urge would resurface, unbidden, and Jiang Suo knew full well: to kill an Elder who appreciated him was betrayal, but to let Qingxia go unavenged was betrayal too.
