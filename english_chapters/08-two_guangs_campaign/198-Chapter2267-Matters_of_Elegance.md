# Chapter 2267: Matters of Elegance

Doubts aside, the Australian orders couldn't be disobeyed. Under the urging of the escort personnel, he braved himself to walk in.

The Three Headquarters was now the headquarters and barracks of the Wuzhou National Army. Entering the main gate, he saw many National Army soldiers walking back and forth. The naturalized citizen who brought him led him into a service alley, going all the way to the back.

Walking through five or six layers of courtyards, they turned a corner before coming out from a side door. Chang Qingyun looked closely and recognized: this was the place where Xiong Wencan used to rest, three elegant rooms, with garden stones and vegetation dotted in the front and back courtyards. The front courtyard also had a small pond, keeping goldfish and lotus flowers. Secluded and quiet, a good place.

At the entrance of the service alley, there was also a wooden sentry box with guards standing duty. The cadre who sent him took out documents before they were allowed to enter the courtyard.

Such a place would naturally not be where ordinary soldiers lived. Could it be... inhabited by an Australian leader?!

Chang Qingyun instantly broke into a layer of cold sweat on his back again—he understood the Australians too well. They didn't put scholars like them in their eyes, let alone him being just a *Juren*. So it was impossible to call him here to recruit him.

Could it be that the matter of Jiang Suo appointing a meeting with him was exposed? On second thought, it shouldn't be. Neither Jiang Suo nor he did anything, not even saying prohibited words. Even if Australians were omniscient, they couldn't speculate out of thin air on things that hadn't happened at all... Besides, with his status, whether handling him over to the Australian factory guards for interrogation or directly executing him was just a matter of one sentence. The Australian leader wouldn't come to interrogate him personally at all.

While in fear, a fake Australian wearing Australian-style "cadre clothes" came out from inside, walked over and asked: "You are Mr. Chang Qingyun, right?"

The comer was dignified in appearance and neatly dressed, obviously not an ordinary fake Australian. Calling him, a prisoner, "Mr." was extremely polite. Chang Qingyun hurriedly bowed to the ground, "Dare not, student is Chang Qingyun."

"Looking for you today because there is a matter," saying this, the fake Australian nodded to the escort personnel, who immediately withdrew.

"This, don't know what matter student is to labor for."

"Come in and talk."

Chang Qingyun was led into the room. He had been here before. The middle room was originally where Xiong Wencan received guests. On the two sides, one was a study, one was a bedroom. Originally the furnishings here were very exquisite because of the Governor's stationing. Now not only was the arrangement clean and neat, but the furnishings were better than in the past. Chang Qingyun clicked his tongue secretly—Australians were known for simplicity; unexpectedly there was such a luxurious Senator!

"I am Zhao Fengtian, Secretary of the Wuzhou City Office." The fake Australian who brought him in introduced himself, "You sit for now."

Chang Qingyun inclined his body and sat down.

"Calling you here is to ask you to help with a favor." Zhao Fengtian said, "To be honest, originally shouldn't trouble you, just that we have no scholars here, and a more suitable candidate cannot be found locally in Wuzhou..."

Hearing this made Chang Qingyun bewildered, so he had to stand up and say: "Whatever matter the Superior Officer has, just order. Student will certainly serve."

"Heard you are a talent, not only of *Juren* origin, but poetry and painting are also both superb."

Chang Qingyun’s face reddened, hurriedly saying: "Dare not, dare not, a bit of brush and ink plaything, matters not fit for the stage..."

"Don't be humble." Zhao Fengtian’s face had a trace of disdain, but his words were very magnanimous, "I was also a commoner of the Great Ming in the past, knowing this *Juren* of yours didn't come easily." He said, "Now there is an errand for you to do—not troublesome. As long as you do it well, when the situation stabilizes, naturally release you home first, and also give you travel expenses."

"Student knows the Senate's preferential treatment policy." Chang Qingyun had a bottom in his heart; ten out of ten it was a matter of playing with writing and ink, "Don't know what kind of errand?"

"Sir, please look." Zhao Fengtian led him to the rear hall. He saw a large painting table placed facing the back courtyard here. On it were listed various painting tools and paper and silk, many of which were top grade. Many books and painting scrolls were placed in the painting vat.

Zhao Fengtian picked up a scroll of painting silk from the table, unrolled it, and pressed it with paperweights on both sides. It was a blue-green landscape painting.

Chang Qingyun was not considered a famous master in painting—to him it was just a hobby, used to pass time usually. But even so, he could see the level of this painting was really not good: the composition was obviously imitated from a certain famous master, yet the brush strokes were weak and the brush intent messy. Although using top-quality painting silk and brush and ink pigments, the painted thing was really unbearable to look at.

"How does Sir think of this painting?" Zhao Fengtian asked.

Chang Qingyun was suddenly alert: Calling him here with such great trouble, and in a place like the Three Headquarters, with painting tools so exquisite... this painting was nine out of ten from the hand of some Hair thief high official.

Since ancient times high officials and rich merchants mostly liked to pretend to be elegant. Chang Qingyun had seen much. Probably Hair thieves were no exception.

He thought for a moment and said: "This painting obviously came from the brush of a novice, yet has quite some talent, also not easy. If given time, must become a great master!"

Zhao Fengtian laughed: "Sure enough, a scholar knows how to talk. Just say painted badly and be done with it, why say must become a great master."

"Yes, yes." Chang Qingyun agreed repeatedly, thinking in his heart: you can say this, I can't!

"Let me tell you the truth, this painting was painted by our Chief." Zhao Fengtian said, "His painting skills... you also saw..."

"No wonder, no wonder." Chang Qingyun said repeatedly.

"No wonder what?"

"Although the painting cannot be said to be good, it has an air of a hero."

Zhao Fengtian glanced at him, didn't comment further, but the disdain on his face was overflowing in words.

"...Just as you said, he is a novice. Even if studying diligently and training hard now, he can't paint well in a short while. Moreover, his official duties are busy, and he doesn't have this time..."

Chang Qingyun originally thought the true Australian wanted to find someone to teach him painting or such, but hearing Zhao Fengtian’s words it didn't seem like it.

"...So want to ask Sir to ghostwrite."

So it was ghostwriting! Chang Qingyun thought, this was easier than teaching a true Australian to paint. Spreading it out wouldn't count as "clinging to the powerful" or "bowing and scraping." The reputation would be better.

"This is easy." Chang Qingyun said, "Just don't know what kind of painting to paint, and what size. Student knowing it can also draft a mental plan."

"No rush." Zhao Fengtian said, "This ghostwriting is not asking you to paint at will. Sir please look." Saying this he took out another scroll from the painting vat and unfolded it on the table.

Chang Qingyun looked with one glance; this was a freehand orchid. Three or five strokes of extremely simple outline. Painted fairly okay, only the brush strokes were tender, appearing painted by a woman. There was no inscription on the painting.

"This..."

"The painting painted by Sir, the painting intent should echo with this painting."

So that was it! Chang Qingyun suddenly realized. No wonder they called him to ghostwrite. With the uncouthness of Hair thieves, not to mention painting, even this painting intent might not be understood.

"Student understands." He nodded, "This is not hard. Only, how does the Superior Officer want to echo? Must have a tenet."

"This..." Zhao Fengtian pondered for a moment, "You just go paint, as long as it's positive and upward!"

"Yes, yes." Chang Qingyun saw him wanting to speak but stopping. Adding the two paintings, his heart understood more than half. This was a woman's matter!

Combining with the furnishings and layout here and those exquisite painting tools, Chang Qingyun guessed that this place was nine out of ten where the Australian Wuzhou Prefect Xie Erren kept a mistress in a golden house! Only he could have this qualification and ability.

Unexpectedly this true Australian was so elegant. Chang Qingyun lamented, turns out among Hair thieves not all were rough embryos only knowing fleshly pleasures.

"Whatever painting tools you need, just make a list. I will prepare them for you here. Is it convenient for you to paint at Sanheui?"

"Convenient, convenient!" Chang Qingyun nodded repeatedly, "Only need a painting table."

"This is easy, I'll have someone send one over." Zhao Fengtian said, "You just paint diligently. If there are paintings needing your echo in the future, they will naturally be sent over then. Take this one with you first—how many days to finish painting?"

"If materials are complete, one day is enough."

"Good. Then the afternoon of the day after tomorrow I'll send someone to retrieve it—don't soil this painting, the Chief values it very much."

"Student understands."

"I will inform the administrator in the camp, telling them not to assign work to you in recent days. You just do your best to paint."

Chang Qingyun returned to Sanheui, his heart even more chaotic. Jiang Suo’s matter hadn't been thought through, and this time the Australians made such a scene again! Didn't know if it was fortune or misfortune?

He didn't know much about Xie Erren. But listening to public praise usually, he was a not bad Australian official. At least with Wuzhou under his rule, the market was peaceful and people harmonious. Wonder whose daughter of a thousand gold this Senator Xie hid? Probably having both talent and beauty; otherwise, this Senator Xie wouldn't be so infatuated for her.

The next day, a painting table and painting tools were indeed sent to him from the city. The steward of the camp was also very polite, stating: "Mr. Chang just paint; leave other matters to others to do."

Preferential treatment was not only this. Originally clerks like him only had two meals a day; only those going out for physical labor had three meals supplied. Yet this day he not only enjoyed lunch, but it was delivered by a special person—actually a "boxed meal" that only fake Australians could eat, with meat and vegetables, and a bowl of soup. Allowing Chang Qingyun, whose stomach turned sour from eating relief ration paste for many days, to have a good feast.

Wine and food satisfied, he picked his teeth while thinking. Being useful to Australians now was naturally excellent. But Jiang Suo's side also had to be dealt with; otherwise, with that rash fellow, he might really run to report him if things went wrong. After all, he dared to lead troops to defend Bang Mountain, a desperate place, back then.

He knew the Australian rules: most particular about "ruling the country by law." If Jiang Suo really made a scene, even if he served Xie Erren, the other party had no ability to protect him—not to mention he was a "second-time" captive.

Thinking of this, he made up his mind: go meet the "old acquaintance" Jiang Suo mentioned, see exactly who he is, and what he has to say. Then make a decision.
