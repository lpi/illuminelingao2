# Chapter 2133 - Fundraising for Rehabilitation

This "bear more burden" was considered "within expectations," so although the directors of the Rehabilitation Bureau all looked miserable, half of them were feigning it.

Since ancient times, the key to fundraising for charity lay in the handling. As long as the task of raising funds and grain was handled by the Rehabilitation Bureau, there were naturally ways to shift the burden.

This "Grand Rehabilitation Fundraising" in Wuzhou followed the old model of "Reasonable Burden." Roughly speaking, it was raised by the Rehabilitation Bureau itself, mainly levied from various trade guilds and local wealthy households in Wuzhou.

Slightly different from "Reasonable Burden," the past Reasonable Burden was a relatively general levy, taking a village, a town, or a trade guild as a unit and giving a figure. The internal allocation ratio was distributed by these entities themselves.

But the allocation ratio for this Reasonable Burden was quite detailed. Not only was it specific to each trade guild, but even gentry households and business names were called out one by one. Basically, no rich person in the city was spared.

Because the seats in the Rehabilitation Bureau were mainly occupied by the Rice and Grain Guild and the Weighing and Commission Guild, to prevent them from using their power to shift the burden, these two largest trade guilds in Wuzhou had to jointly bear forty percent of the total "Reasonable Burden." Other guilds shared the rest proportionally according to their economic strength. Finally, twelve percent was borne by local gentry households who owned large amounts of land.

The specific ratios and figures were naturally not dreamed up by Xie Erren instantly—Luo Yangming had been undercover locally for many years, focusing on collecting economic and social intelligence on Wuzhou. The details of Wuzhou's commercial system and "village worthies" were naturally the most important of the important points. So it was only natural that Xie Erren could produce this.

The directors were dumbfounded. This allocation ratio could be called both accurate and ruthless. Roughly speaking, the figure allocated to each village worthy was enough to make them feel the pain of being skinned, but not enough to break bones or tendons.

In ordinary times, everyone would just bear the pain and pay up. However, this time Xiong Wencan had already led the officers and soldiers to toss them around once. Now that the Senate was coming for "Reasonable Burden" again, this skinning was a bit too much, and everyone felt the dizziness of excessive blood loss.

"Don't rush to cry poverty to me," Xie Erren felt that his smiling face while cutting flesh must look extremely handsome right now. "The Senate is crystal clear about the foundation of Wuzhou City. This ratio definitely doesn't wrong anyone—those with more money pay more, those with less pay less, those with no money don't pay. So don't come telling me this is inappropriate or that won't work. Within three days, have all the money and grain ready."

Master Qiao, the Deputy Director of the Rehabilitation Bureau, originally didn't want to speak. Seeing everyone stripping him with their eyes, he had to bite the bullet, stand up, cup his hands, and report:

"Chief! It's not that we want to bargain with you, sir. These allocated ratios and amounts wouldn't be anything in the past, and we wouldn't dare say an extra word. It's truly that this time the officers and soldiers—the Ming Army brought disaster to the people in the city. All the big households suffered heavy losses. Just in my shop, three thousand *dan* of rice was requisitioned without a single copper coin in return! They also scraped away several hundred taels of silver... Every household here, big or small, has suffered losses. Some shops were looted empty by the officers and soldiers, and can't even do business anymore... Now to allocate these again, I'm afraid... afraid..."

Xie Erren frowned. *My first project just came out, and you guys come to challenge me? You really don't take me, a Senator, seriously.* He was unhappy, his face immediately darkened, and he said, "So, you're saying everyone can't go on living?"

Master Qiao trembled; this tone was bad. He somewhat regretted coming out to say these words, but he was the head of the Rice and Grain Guild and the Chief Headman of the Southern City. If he didn't stick his neck out, he wouldn't be able to mix in local circles anymore. He added:

"Master... The Chief came here to govern, and the desire for order is very urgent. But Wuzhou has just suffered from the fires of war, and all parties have suffered losses, not just the common people suffering from hunger and cold. It is better... better... to prioritize preserving vitality—I beg the Master to reduce or exempt a little... The whole city of Wuzhou will be grateful for your virtue..."

Xie Erren was very unhappy. Sure enough, none of these old moneybags were good things. It seemed they wouldn't listen without tasting the flavor of "dictatorship." Instead, he smiled faintly and said, "In that case, how much does Master Qiao think should be reduced?"

Master Qiao was a seasoned old fox. Seeing Xie Erren smiling instead of getting angry, but with fierce light in his eyes, he knew this refined-looking Bandit was also a Crude One. However, words had already been spoken to this point, and there was no way to shrink back. He had to steady himself and say, "I dare not speak rashly about how much to subtract—I only beg the Chief to consider preserving Wuzhou's vitality and reduce or exempt one or two parts as appropriate. The people of the whole city will be grateful..."

"What 'people of the whole city'? It should be said that you people will be grateful, right?" Xie Erren sneered.

Master Qiao could only bow his head in silence. The whole atmosphere suddenly became somewhat stiff.

Luo Yangming felt things were going to go bad. Just as he was about to come out to smooth things over, suddenly someone beside him walked out with a bent waist, first bowed ninety degrees to Xie Erren, and said, "Chief, it's not that we want to challenge the Chief. It's truly that this time everyone has been plagued bitterly by the officers and soldiers! Even my shop had several hundred *dan* of grain snatched by the Puppet Ming Army, and now I don't know what to do! But no matter how difficult it is for us, it's never harder than for the refugees on the streets. The grain and funds the Chief wants to raise, we will definitely prepare in full!"

Luo Yangming looked closely; it turned out to be Da Xinxuan. Xie Erren thought this kid was sensible and asked, "You are..."

"This small person is the shopkeeper of 'Yuxin Firm,' Da Xinxuan." Da Xinxuan bowed deeply, very humble.

Xie Erren thought for a moment and remembered that this business name was in the materials. It was a rice and grain firm that also engaged in weighing and commission. Crucially, the financier behind this firm was the Wu Zhixiang family, a business partner of the Senate.

Because of Wu Zhixiang, the Wu family had close contacts with the Senate's enterprises in Guangzhou. Besides having rice and grain business dealings with Dachang, they also acted as a weighing and commission firm to purchase various materials for the Senate in Wuzhou.

Because of the background of "Senate business partner," Xie Erren couldn't help but be polite. He immediately raised his hand and said, "Sit down and speak, sit down and speak."

Da Xinxuan did not sit down, but said, "It is truly that each family has suffered different degrees of damage. Some shops, although big households, suffered heavily from the poison of the Puppet Ming officers and soldiers because big trees catch the wind. If we collect according to this share, even if we force them to hang themselves or jump into the river, they won't be able to gather it. This would inevitably harm the Senate's virtue of loving life. This small person is bold to beg the Chief not to limit the share of each family, but allow us to allocate it ourselves—in short, this grain and money will not be short a single coin or a single grain, and will be prepared for the Chief within three days."

His words were both earnest and well-reasoned. Xie Erren didn't know how to refute for a moment. Thinking again, *Anyway, as long as the money and grain are in hand*, he also had to give the Wu family and the bureau directors some face. If things became completely deadlocked right from the start, future work would be hard to carry out—after all, counting the soldiers, he only had a little over a hundred people, and he still had to rethink on this group to handle affairs.

Immediately he nodded: "In that case, I will grant your proposal. Only, this money and grain must be prepared properly within three days!"

Da Xinxuan hurriedly said, "We will definitely get it done." Master Qiao and the other directors immediately echoed in agreement. Luo Yangming was a hidden cadre, focusing on observation and monitoring. Naturally, it was inconvenient for him to speak casually, so he mixed in with the crowd.

With the matter of money and grain settled, the following matters became easier. Xie Erren immediately ordered the disbandment of the militia squads previously formed by various *she* in the city for defense needs—these people were temporarily conscripted citizens engaged in industry and commerce or farmers from the four suburbs. Their combat power was low, and morale was not high. Gathering over a thousand people together without engaging in production, although useful for public security, consumed a large amount of money and grain. The cost-effectiveness ratio was too low, and they wouldn't be of use if the Ming Army counterattacked or if bandits needed to be suppressed.

"Any damaged street barricades must be repaired immediately. Any missing watchmen must be replaced as soon as possible. The security in the city still relies on everyone's joint efforts."

Everyone was in favor of this matter. After all, for every day the militia squads existed, everyone had to spend an extra day's money and grain. Maintaining public security was obviously more meaningful to them than to the poor and refugees.

The third item was about industry and commerce in the city. All industry and commerce in the city were to resume business within a limited time. Those whose shops, goods, or personnel suffered significant damage during the war could report it and be exempted from part of the commercial tax. Those unable to resume business in the short term must report within fifteen days. Otherwise, the shops would be confiscated.

Xie Erren believed: Wuzhou was a key commercial town. As long as commercial circulation could be restored as soon as possible, money and grain would be no problem. Moreover, industry and commerce itself solved the problem of employment. Wuzhou had a large non-agricultural population to begin with. If industry and commerce could not be restored quickly, this time bomb of a massive unemployed population would be strapped on again.

"...Starting today, the selling prices of grain and cloth will implement a daily government guidance price. Increases or decreases must not exceed ten percent of the guidance price. Hoarding and unwillingness to sell are strictly prohibited! Those who hoard for speculation or drive up prices will be dealt with according to military law!"

Xie Erren said sternly, sweeping the entire flower hall with a gaze he believed "could kill." Everyone dared not say much, but muttered in their hearts: *With war raging right now, the grain source from Guangxi has been cut off. Grain reserves decrease with every bit sold. How can 'no price increase' be maintained? Isn't this forcing everyone to sell at a controlled low price?!*

But everyone knew this was the Australians' move to buy people's hearts. Resistance was impossible, and one might end up being the unlucky chicken killed to scare the monkeys. So they all agreed submissively.

Next, some rehabilitation affairs were discussed, especially the thousands of corpses abandoned inside and outside the city, which all needed to be collected and buried. Except for some corpses claimed and buried by families, many deceased were either guest troops from outside or poor people from other places making a living in Wuzhou, mostly doing odd jobs or short-term labor. Even their names were unknown after death. Even if there were employers, some were unwilling to identify the bodies to avoid bearing funeral expenses.

These corpses all had to be collected and buried. Xie Erren planned to arrange a labor team composed of prisoners to work on the collection. However, another task would require the labor team: cleaning up weapons left on the battlefield.
