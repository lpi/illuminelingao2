# Chapter 2180 - Ambush (Part 1)

Sending away the envoy, Yang Jinghui consulted with his nephew, the advisor, and others. With their strength, attacking the county seat would probably not be a problem, but they knew the county seat was a tough nut to crack. Although there was a lot of oil and water (profit) there, asking the village braves to swarm up the walls might be difficult. After thinking it over again and again, he decided to go to the various market towns in the county to extort them again.

"If the merchants and people in the town do not comply, we simply break the town and loot it thoroughly. Raise the banner of 'Oppose the Hair Rebels, Support the Ming'! Gather heroes from all directions!" Yang Jinghui said smugly.

Master Bi hurriedly said, "Master, do not be anxious. Regarding the matter of raising the banner, in this student's humble opinion, it is better to delay a bit."

"Why?" Provincial Graduate Yang was immersed in his fantasy of "rectifying the country" and "bringing glory to his ancestors," and disapproved of Master Bi's "remonstrance." "Once this banner is raised, we will be the Righteous Amy serving the King. The whole county will inevitably follow the wind—do they dare not obey Commander Xiong's royal orders and flags?"

"What Master says is true," Master Bi said quickly. "However, this student is just worried that once Master raises this banner, the Short Hair Rebels will inevitably mobilize heavy troops to come. The Yang Family Village is weak on its own; even if heroes and righteous men from the whole county come to join, they may not be a match for the Short Hair Rebels. Commander Xiong is far away in Guangxi; distant water cannot quench a nearby thirst..."

Right now, it was at most local tyrant trouble-making or armed fighting, counting as banditry at worst—this was all within the scope of local control, and the matter could be treated as big or small. But once the banner of "Opposing the Short Hair Rebels and Supporting the Ming" was raised, it would be so-called "firing cannons to rebel." The Short Hair Rebel local officials would have to report it, which would inevitably attract a massive suppression campaign by the Short Hair Rebels.

Although Master Bi had never studied to be a Private Secretary, he had dealt with local officials' Private Secretaries a lot. He was very clear about the routine of glossing over faults. The routines of officials simply haven't changed since ancient times; presumably, this Short Hair Dynasty wouldn't be any different from the Great Ming.

His bucket of cold water brought Magistrate Yang, whose fire for "promotion and wealth" and "defending the Dao and eliminating demons" was burning fiercely, to some understanding.

Granted, the people sent by Commander Xiong bragged extravagantly, but currently, government troops were far away in Guangxi. If he really raised the banner and the Short Hair Rebels decided to "kill the chicken to scare the monkey," that would truly be calling to heaven with no answer and to earth with no response. At that time, there would be no share in "bringing glory to ancestors," but "cutting off sons and grandsons" would happen very quickly!

After thinking deeply, he decided the banner couldn't be raised, but he couldn't just leave it unclear either. Anyway, with Commander Xiong's official proclamation in hand, he considered himself to have the title of righteousness, leaving the merchants and people no choice but to comply.

Immediately, he rallied his troops and went everywhere to "inform" various villages and market towns. Intimidated by his might, many villages and towns handed over grain and paid levies one after another. Currently, the Australian-appointed County Director was weak and couldn't do anything about him for a while. Yang Juren's arrogance became even more rampant, acting as if there were "two mandates in one county."

Only Shijian, because it had a Hair Rebel garrison, had merchants who refused to pay grain and money. Yang Juren heard that there were only thirty National Army soldiers in the town, plus a militia unit of over a hundred local commoners. Seeing it as a soft persimmon, he planned to conquer the place, firstly to kill the chicken to scare the monkey, and secondly to demonstrate his "Anti-Hair Rebel" achievements.

A ragtag mob of over five hundred men was organized. Because they had to confront the Hair Rebels head-on, not only did all two hundred-plus "elites" brought by Yang Erhu go into battle, but many "Greenwood Heroes" who came to join were also included. Along the way, many commoners preparing to go to Shijian to "drink soup" (get a share of the loot) joined in—even many people from Hakka and Yao villages who were usually at odds with each other came. The team suddenly swelled to over a thousand, marching majestically toward Shijian to "get rich."

However, Shijian was not easy to chew. The town originally had earthen walls for protection, and after the Australians arrived, they added fortifications, specifically transporting in several cannons. Yang Erhu commanded his men to charge, but a row of cannon shots from the earthen wall battery sent the whole army routing. Obviously, "taking it in one drum beat" was impossible.

Erhu then proposed setting up an old camp in the abandoned stronghold on the mountain north of Shijian, planning for a long siege. To gather grain, he sent people to loot everywhere for several days. He also sent people to Shijian to "persuade surrender," offering conditions: as long as the National Army left the town, he would immediately gift five hundred taels of silver as a "reward," and he would absolutely not obstruct wherever the National Army went—naturally, this was rejected.

Unexpectedly, before the siege could even begin, news came that the Hair Rebels had sent troops from Sihui to reinforce. Yang Erhu was a man who had served as an officer and gone into battle; as soon as he arrived at Shijian, he sent *Ye Bu Shou* (scouts) to reconnoiter in all directions to avoid being caught off guard by Hair Rebel reinforcements.

So shortly after the 2nd Company landed, the Yang Jinghui uncle and nephew received the news. Hearing that the incoming troops were in good order and well-equipped, Yang Erhu knew it must be the Hair Rebels' elite Fubo Army moving out, so he hurriedly discussed with Master Yang and his subordinates.

Everyone knew the Hair Rebels were formidable, but few had personally experienced just *how* formidable. However, even Yang Erhu himself and his gang of brothers from Zhaoqing only knew that the Australians' cannons were powerful; they hadn't really fought face-to-face with Australian soldiers with real swords and guns. Since they heard the incoming team had no cannons, everyone was relatively calm—as long as there were no cannons, they could always put up a fight.

After discussion, they decided to take advantage of the opportunity while the Hair Rebel fleet was delayed and the cannons hadn't arrived yet to eat up this adventurous Hair Rebel force in one go. Shijian probably couldn't be taken in time, but eating up a unit of Hair Rebels would be enough to "shake the whole county with awe." It might even force the Hair Rebel County Director to "abandon the city and flee," allowing them to "recover the county seat."

With this plan, Yang Jinghui and Yang Erhu immediately led over three hundred "elites" and two Tiger Crouch cannons from the old camp, rushing to set an ambush by the roadside, preparing to annihilate this troop in one go.

"They're coming! The Hair Rebels are coming!" A village brave lying in wait ran into the woods out of breath, pointing panting at the east side of the mountain road and shouting.

"How many men and horses are coming? Are there cannons?" Yang Erhu asked.

"Reporting to Second Master, the Hair Rebels are still two *li* away from here. Not many people. There are two scouts clearing the way in front, and behind them, there are only thirty-odd men. Neither cannons nor horses, but everyone has that kind of repeating firelock of theirs."

"Understood, you may withdraw."

Hearing that only thirty-odd men came, Yang Erhu hesitated slightly. Obviously, the Hair Rebels were advancing in echelons of a vanguard, main body, and rearguard to avoid being eaten up completely on the mountain road.

If they attacked now, fighting with many against few, they could certainly eat up this group of men, but the enemies behind would be alerted, making them difficult to fight.

Everyone looked at him, waiting for Yang Erhu's decision.

Yang Erhu thought for a moment and turned to Yang Juren: "Uncle, your nephew thinks it is time to act. We have ten times their number, and I am in the dark while they are in the light. The mountain road here is steep; even if the Hair Rebel firearms are sharp, they cannot deploy them. We will concentrate fire with muskets and Tiger Crouch cannons, then charge out. The Hair Rebels will certainly be panicked, and we can break them in one drum beat. As for the troops behind, we will see the situation. If the enemy formation is in chaos and retreats, we will chase and kill them; if their formation is not chaotic and they still want to come this way, we will simply concentrate the whole team and set an ambush outside Shijian."

"Good, we'll do as Nephew says! Pass the order: later, one tael of silver for every Hair Rebel head! For those wounded, if they are my family's tenants, this year's rent is fully exempted; if not tenants, reward ten taels of silver! If anyone unfortunately dies in battle, my Yang family will support his wife and children for a lifetime! Everyone attack!"

Once the order was given, the regiment braves immediately got excited, rubbing their fists and wiping their palms, ready to do a big job.

Yang Erhu called out-

"Third Brother! You were a *Ye Bu Shou* (scout). Take a few brothers and sneak over quietly. Capture their scouts and interrogate them for information. Don't alert the troops behind."

The man Yang Erhu called "Third Brother" was not a member of the Yang family. His surname was Shao, the third child in his family. Polite people called him "Third Master" or "Third Brother"; impolite ones called him "Old Shao the Third" (Shao Laosan). Shao Laosan was a village rascal in his youth. After growing up, he joined the army, daring to fight and kill, with a black heart and ruthless hands. He mixed his way up to squad leader in the battalion. Originally, he was not the same kind of person as the children of local gentry like Yang Erhu, but Yang Erhu valued his ruthlessness and paid special attention to winning him over on ordinary days, even becoming sworn brothers.

"That's easy!" Shao Laosan said immediately. "I'll go and be right back!" He immediately picked seven or eight regiment braves and went into the mountain forest.

On the narrow mountain road, the 1st Platoon's two point men, Li Luhu and Xiong Pi, held machetes, hacking away the weeds and shrubs by the roadside while paying attention to the movement on both sides of the mountain road.

Both were new recruits who hadn't joined the army long ago. Their first battle was the attack on Guangzhou some time ago. The Fubo Army expanded quickly; most of the veterans who had participated in actual combat before landing in Guangdong had already been promoted to commanders at various levels as seeds. The lowest were squad and platoon leaders. Li Luhu was from the Southern Metropolitan Region, twenty years old, who came to Lingao on Master Zhao Yingong's immigrant ship. Xiong Pi was of Guangdong Danka (boat people) origin. When the two first arrived at the recruit camp, they fought several times due to the language barrier, and subsequently arranged fights over various trivial matters. But in the big melting pot of the army, these things were nothing. After carrying guns together, suffering corporal punishment together, and taking several military stick beatings together from the company commander on the drill ground, they had settled down.

This section of the mountain road was not too difficult to walk. The road ran north-south. To the west was a cliff, not too steep; falling down would at most result in being bloodied by thorns and shrubs, but it wasn't that easy to fall to one's death. To the east was a dense forest. If ambushed, the only thing the enemy could use was this dense forest. According to the infantry manual, Li Luhu held his gun on alert, and Xiong Pi held a machete to clear the vines blocking the center of the mountain road—the Australian instructors attached great importance to regulations; one even had to follow regulations to shit and piss. The green recruits had quite a few complaints about this. Li Luhu, who had worked in his hometown in the south, was a bit better off, but Xiong Pi, who was used to being free and unfettered on the boat, grumbled quite a lot. He didn't know that the regulations he resented so much today would save his life, nor did he know that in the future he would become an "old fogey" who held regulations as sacred.

In the woods on one side of the road, Shao Laosan was leading a few regiment braves, creeping quietly closer from the dense forest. In the early summer mountain forest, the vegetation was lush. Shao Laosan's hands and feet were very light, and the regiment braves were also good at walking mountain roads. He was confident that even if he touched the edge of the woods, the Hair Rebel scouts wouldn't discover him.
