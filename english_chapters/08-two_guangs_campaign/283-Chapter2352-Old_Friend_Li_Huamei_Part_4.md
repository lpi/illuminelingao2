# Chapter 2352: Old Friend Li Huamei (Part 4)

The case itself wasn't difficult. Guo Yi knew that the reason this case was "tricky" and was specifically handed over to him to handle was, to put it bluntly, that it involved a "Senator."

Li Mo was okay, but Li Huamei had to be protected—unless she sought death herself. But from the current point of view, she wasn't stupid.

Actually, even Li Siya, if she hadn't been involved in the murder case in Kaohsiung back then, the Senate wouldn't have needed to treat her as an "enemy." As for the kidnapping of Chairman Wen back then, to be honest, Chairman Wen didn't take it to heart nowadays.

In fact, even if she defected now, there was a high probability that the Senate would forgive her. After all, such a knowledgeable, smart, and capable woman was rare in this spacetime.

He personally agreed with Zhou Botao's judgment and some ideas back then: wait for an opportunity to sow discord between the two Lis, promote the expansion of the rift between them, and finally achieve "reverse use."

However, how to sow discord between them specifically, and what kind of opportunity to look for to start, still needed some consideration. Li Siya was a very smart woman, and Li Huamei was not a brawny woman either.

The headquarters of the Political Security Bureau was still located in the old county town of Lingao. Its scale was not large, and its appearance was very low-key. Not only was the portal simple, but there were even no sentries standing guard outside the door. The wooden gate was closed all year round and only opened when vehicles entered or exited. Personnel entered and exited through a small side door.

Even the wooden sign of the agency was not hung on the gate; only a simple house number. In Lingao, the one publicly hanging the agency sign was the County Branch of the PSB located in Bairen City—which was basically the only external window channel locally.

Xu Yanliang's arrival had long been informed to the PSB through the liaison of the General Security Bureau, so as soon as he reported his name, the door opened immediately. After verifying his "work contact form," the guard gestured to him, "Please follow me."

It was the first time Xu Yanliang had come to this agency, which was full of mystery and was cursed by the Senators to no end. As soon as he entered, he couldn't help looking around. The courtyard was ordinary; the main office building was just a two-story red brick building, and there were rows of bungalows on both sides. The courtyard was paved with bricks, and there were two flower beds planted with flowers.

Looking at the appearance, it was just the look of an old county agency in the 70s.

The doors and windows here were all closed, and the courtyard was very quiet. But if satisfied listened carefully, one could hear faint voices of people talking, very vague and distant.

"Please go this way." Xu Yanliang was not taken into the building, but went around a corridor on the side of the building. At the end was another door. After going through some procedures, he was handed over to a second guard.

"This PSB is really particular!" Looking at the guard wearing a black uniform and blue collar badge, Xu Yanliang secretly complained.

Guo Yi's office was located in Zhou Botao's original office. This office originally had no decoration, and after Guo Yi moved in, he only replaced some of the furniture. Xu Yanliang originally thought he would see a dignified and solemn office image of a spy chief in movies and TV dramas, maybe with some statues, flags, or "mottoes." But the office in front of him was no different from offices in other departments: snow-white limewater walls, heavy and sturdy office furniture, and a desk lamp with a green glass shade.

Guo Yi stood up to welcome him: "Comrade Xu Yanliang, hello! I am Guo Yi."

Xu Yanliang subconsciously reached out his hand, and the two shook hands. He suddenly felt a bit incredulous; was this person in front of him the famous "Proprietor Guo"?

Speaking of the popularity of Senators, apart from the dozen or so main Senators holding high positions, Guo Yi was considered the one with the highest popularity among ordinary Senators. Although he had been away from Lingao for a long time, everyone in the Senate knew him. Opening up the trade window in Guangzhou added a layer of legendary color to him. No wonder Xu Yanliang was a little excited.

The person in front of him looked like a young man in his early thirties—of course, Xu Yanliang knew his real age was nearly forty. Wearing a black uniform, with an elegant and calm temperament, he fit the temperament of both a big shot in the business world and an official of a powerful agency.

"I am Xu Yanliang." Xu Yanliang said, "Secretary of the Board of the Nanyang Company."

"I know this," Guo Yi smiled, "Please sit down."

The two took their seats. Guo Yi reached out and pulled the bell rope, and a female staff member came in from outside.

"Please give Senator Xu a cup of tea."

"Ah, thank you. You are much younger than I imagined."

"I think we are all like this." Guo Yi said, "Actually, I am thirty-eight years old this year."

"This has to be said to be very magical." Xu Yanliang said. "This is probably the reward the Creator gave us for abandoning everything to come here."

Guo Yi smiled and didn't speak. Xu Yanliang suddenly remembered that he didn't come to this parallel universe spacetime voluntarily.

"Sorry."

"It's nothing," Guo Yi said. "Although this was not my original intention, I am also very satisfied with my life here."

Before he finished speaking, the female staff member brought tea. She left without saying a word after putting down the drink.

"Alright, let's get to the main topic. We received an application regarding your company's intention to include Li Huamei in the 'training' list. Regarding her, we happen to have some important materials in hand, so we specially invited you over."

"Yes, we are currently short of captains like her, but after checking her file, she is now a 'key focus object,' so we made the application. I also want to know, what exactly is wrong with her? Is it because she came from a pirate background? Her surveillance level is even higher than Liu Xiang's; this is too strange."

"Hmm, I understand your thoughts. However, according to the materials we grasp, this captain has very close ties with the Li Siya group and is very likely a spy Li Siya planted in Lingao. In recent years, the General Bureau of Political Security has intercepted quite a few letters from Li Siya to her, so we have been monitoring her. These are the relevant materials; you can take a look—there are some 'highlights' in them, please have a look." Guo Yi said and handed over a thick file folder.

Xu Yanliang possessed the essential skill of quick reading for leadership positions. After quickly browsing the materials, he felt a bit unable to let go.

"So, she is a spy?"

"Basically, you can say that."

"Then why not arrest her?" Xu Yanliang became suspicious. could it be that these materials were concocted by the PSB?

"One reason is because of Senator Qi. The second is that she hasn't done anything to harm the Senate after all."

"This is such a pity!" Xu Yanliang wrung his hands, "She is so capable and very smart! We originally thought very highly of her!"

"I understand your feelings." Guo Yi said, "Our suggestion is that you can continue to use her, but you cannot put her in a key position. We also ask you to cooperate in monitoring her. We have planted spies around her, but this is far from enough."

"We can cooperate in monitoring her. But you must inform us of your specific monitoring personnel." Xu Yanliang said quickly.

"That's no problem." Guo Yi said, "However, talking to you about this today, the purpose is not to monitor her, but how to enable her to get rid of the current situation—to be a naturalized cadre openly and honestly."

"You mean..." Xu Yanliang hesitated, "Turn her?"

"Yes. Specifically, what means should we use to exert influence or even control over Li Huamei? If we can make her consciously or unconsciously break away from Li Siya's influence and further transmit information processed by us to that side through her, that would be ideal. Not only can we use this step to grasp the situation of the Li Siya group, but we can also let her play a full role."

"I am very much in favor of turning her, but I don't have any specific methods to come up with immediately. Maybe we can only influence her imperceptibly in work." Xu Yanliang said, "As the employer, we will try our best to cooperate with your work."

"Thank you very much then."

"Regarding cooperating with your work, I also have an idea." Xu Yanliang had been planning this idea for a long time and had communicated with Zhou and Wang. He originally wanted to talk to Zhao Manxiong. Now that Guo Yi, the second deputy director, was here, he might as well talk to him first.

"Please go ahead."

"Our Nanyang Company officially hung up its signboard a few days ago. You may also know that our company's business scope is very wide, and in the future, it is very likely to have colonial management work. It's almost the role of the East India Company—actually, it's a small government."

Guo Yi nodded.

"...Since it is a small government, security work naturally has to keep up. Political security is currently a deficiency, and it is also an indispensable department in the future. So I hope the PSB can set up a special organization within our company; the name doesn't matter, to be responsible for this business."

No matter how negative the views on the PSB within the Senate were, the importance of political security work could not be denied. No matter how they guarded against it, the PSB would definitely extend its hand into the Nanyang Company and establish a surveillance network.

If they took extreme measures to "clean up the house" and "nip it in the bud," it would instead arouse suspicion of the Nanyang Company from the outside: what exactly is such a huge company with countless privileges afraid of others knowing?

At first, they considered "setting up a separate portal" in the political security sector and kicking out the PSB system, but they soon realized that "setting up a separate portal" would make the Senate more uneasy than "cleaning up the house."

The closed nature of the Political Security Bureau had already made them a target of public criticism. One must know that this was just an agency, while the Nanyang Company would be a company possessing many colonies and fleets, and even a huge "security" force in the future. What impression would a "fully equipped" "Australian East India Company" give to the Senators?

Xu Yanliang considered it again and again and decided to take the initiative to propose letting the PSB set up an agency in the Nanyang Company. The condition was that it must be transparent to the Nanyang Company.
