# Chapter 2265: "Niece" Visits

Yi Haoran handed over the bundle and umbrella to Ah Chun. "Is the Master at home?"

"He went to the Rehabilitation Bureau." Ah Chun arranged the items properly, then went to the back to fetch water for washing. "Did you have any luck collecting debts today, Sir?"

"Everything's in chaos—the shopkeepers have scattered who knows where." Though Yi Haoran used debt collection as his excuse for roaming, he did make a few legitimate visits to avoid arousing suspicion. "Fortunately, the markets have recovered somewhat. I did manage to collect a little silver."

"Collecting accounts is always good." Ah Chun poured the washing water. "Go rest in the back, Sir. Business at the counter is dead quiet—we might go all day without seeing a customer."

Though the rice shop didn't do retail, in peaceful times various rice shops and peddlers would come for small wholesale purchases, keeping a steady flow of visitors at the front. Now there were hardly any.

Yet Luo Yangming paid no attention to his own business, spending his days coming and going from the Rehabilitation Bureau handling miscellaneous duties. Even his wife Ah Tao found it baffling, let alone Yi Haoran. Could the shopkeeper be abandoning the rice trade to curry favor with the Taipings and become a fake Australian himself?

Yi Haoran returned to the accounting room, placed the collected silver in the money box, then opened the ledger to balance and record the day's collections—just a few strokes of the brush. Business was so slow there was hardly anything to calculate.

In the past, he would spend his free time playing Xiangqi with Li Wensheng or the accountants from neighboring shops, or pass the hours with a game of "Ma Diao."

But today he had no interest in such diversions. The excitement from reuniting with Jiang Suo hadn't yet faded. He knew from Jiang Suo's account that quite a few officials and soldiers were scattered throughout Wuzhou, many of whom had infiltrated Taiping government offices. If these people could be gathered, they would form a force not to be underestimated—one that could be put to great use.

How to gather them? Originally he had intended merely to win over Chang Qingyun and use him to develop a network inside the captive camp. But now his ambitions had grown. People in the camp were useful, but Sanheui required crossing the Gui River and passing through Dayun Gate. To coordinate an inside-outside attack, having people outside the city alone wouldn't suffice—he needed operatives inside as well.

He turned the problem over in his mind, considering how to approach Chang Qingyun and what means might move those scattered officials and soldiers to join the cause. Suddenly he heard Ah Chun calling from outside:

"Mr. Hao! Mr. Hao!"

Yi Haoran responded quickly and stepped out. Ah Chun stood at the entrance to the small courtyard, looking in. Seeing him emerge, he hurried over.

"Mr. Hao! Someone's here to see you."

"Oh? Who is it?" Yi Haoran was puzzled—he had no relatives or old friends locally, and very few of Xiong Wencan's staff knew him.

"A woman." Ah Chun gestured. "Says she's a relative of yours."

"Relative?" Yi Haoran froze for a moment before recalling Jiang Qiuchan. Since she had arranged his introduction to "Yuxin," they hadn't met. Yi Haoran prided himself on being an upright gentleman. Jiang Qiuchan was a newly widowed woman; even with the title of "Cousin Uncle," it was improper for them to meet frequently. So he had never sought her out.

Why had she suddenly come to the shop to find him? Suspicion stirred in his heart, but he dared not show it. "I'll go out right away."

The visitor was indeed Jiang Qiuchan. She wore a plain blue cloth skirt and jacket, forgoing all makeup and ornaments—only a wooden hairpin and a white flower adorned her hair bun. A bamboo basket sat beside her. Seeing him come out, she rose and curtseyed deeply.

"Cousin Uncle..."

Yi Haoran hastily returned the courtesy. "Why has Niece come out alone? It's chaotic and dangerous outside..." He gestured welcomingly. "Please, come sit inside."

"Thank you for your concern, Cousin Uncle. The streets are fairly peaceful now."

The rice shop had a reception room for entertaining customers. Ordinarily, female guests weren't received there, but with business dead, borrowing it temporarily was acceptable.

Ah Chun served tea and withdrew. Yi Haoran felt slightly awkward. Looking at his "Cousin Niece," he noted that though her complexion was pale, her spirits seemed fair.

"Niece came to the shop today hoping to see the Madam..."

The Madam she mentioned was naturally Luo Yangming's wife, Ding A-tao. Yi Haoran had heard that she and Ding A-tao had known each other before her marriage, and it was through this connection that she had recommended Yi Haoran here.

But Ding A-tao had gone out today with Wen Yun, accompanied by the old shopkeeper Li Wensheng, to offer incense.

"The Madam went to offer incense."

"Ah Chun mentioned that. Since only Cousin Uncle is here, I'll have to entrust these things to you." She pointed to the basket on the table. "Some needlework she asked me to do. It's finished now—please ask her not to think poorly of it."

"Of course, of course."

Jiang Qiuchan hesitated, seeming to have something to say but unable to find the words. Finally, she spoke softly:

"There's a matter I'd like to ask Cousin Uncle's advice on."

Hearing she wanted his counsel, Yi Haoran relaxed. "We're family—no need for such formality. Just ask."

"Cousin Uncle served in Viceroy Xiong's Yamen. Do you know much about the Australians?" Her voice dropped very low. She knew his origins and understood this identity had to be kept secret.

Yi Haoran's heart skipped. What was she getting at? But reflecting that they had shared adversity, Qiuchan must have a reason for asking and surely meant no harm.

He lowered his voice as well. "I know a thing or two. What does Niece wish to ask?"

"The matter is this..."

Jiang Qiuchan's maiden family operated a silk shop in Wuzhou. Though not a major business, it was a century-old establishment with connections to the Yamen. This time, retained personnel in the Yamen had sent word that the newly arrived Australian Prefect Master Xie was looking to hire a "Companion Woman."

"...Apparently, Master Xie has taken a fancy to a woman surnamed Cai, whom he keeps in his Yamen. Since she has no one to look after her, he wants to find a woman of good family who is also educated and sensible to serve as her companion and attendant." Qiuchan explained. "My maiden family brother heard about it and wanted to recommend me for the position."

Her husband had passed away. She was alone with a son, with no income. In these times of military chaos, she couldn't return to her husband's family in Teng County. Though she had her maiden family in Wuzhou, she was a married daughter after all—living under their roof carried an inevitable awkwardness. She wanted to take this job.

However, this meant serving alongside Australians. Neither Qiuchan nor her family knew much about them. Though the retained Yamen personnel spoke favorably of the Australians, she somewhat distrusted the words of servants.

After much deliberation, she remembered Yi Haoran. Since he had fought against the Australians, he would naturally understand them well. Asking him should be more reliable.

So that was it! Yi Haoran thought. This was respectable work that could provide for mother and son. From his conversations with Jiang Suo, he had learned that the Australians were generally decent in their private conduct and proper in their behavior. Working this job shouldn't pose any risk to Qiuchan.

Suddenly his attention sharpened. Surnamed Cai? Something stirred in his memory. He asked urgently: "Is this woman's name Cai Lan?"

"Indeed." Qiuchan looked puzzled. "Does Cousin Uncle know her?"

"I wouldn't say I know her," Yi Haoran replied, "but I've met her husband a few times."

Cai Lan was the wife of Xing Chenghuan, who had served as correspondence advisor to Wuzhou Prefect Hu Duhua. Through official business, they had crossed paths. Once, at a banquet hosted by the Viceroy's Office, they had sat beside each other. During casual conversation after wine, Xing Chenghuan mentioned he had a fiancée named Cai Lan, already brought to Wuzhou in preparation for their wedding.

"...If I had known Wuzhou would suffer this catastrophe, I would never have brought her here, no matter what." With that, the already flushed Xing Chenghuan had sighed heavily.

The encounter left a deep impression on Yi Haoran. Because of the war, Xing Chenghuan never formally married Cai Lan nor consummated their union. He reportedly held back "for fear of burdening her future." At the time, Yi Haoran was moved, seeing him as an upright gentleman. When he later heard that Xing Chenghuan had martyred himself when Wuzhou fell, Yi Haoran's respect only deepened.

And now, the fiancée he had left behind was willing to become a Taiping's concubine! The thought made Yi Haoran's expression flicker. But then he reconsidered—if Qiuchan could gain access to this shameless, lowly woman's side, it would be like placing eyes and ears in the Taiping leader's own chambers.

With this in mind, Yi Haoran calmed himself and smiled. "Based on what I know, the Australians are generally decent people—definitely not fierce or cruel. Now that you're a widow with a child and struggling to make ends meet, this job should be perfectly safe."

Jiang Qiuchan visibly relaxed. Clearly, she truly wanted this work.

"With Cousin Uncle's assurance, I feel much easier about it."

"Think nothing of it. With Niece serving the Australians in the future, perhaps Cousin Uncle will have to rely on you one day." Yi Haoran laughed. Then, lowering his voice: "Only, my situation must not be mentioned to outsiders..."

"Niece understands." Qiuchan nodded. "There's one more matter I'd trouble Cousin Uncle with, though I hesitate to ask..."

"Oh? What is it? We're family."

"It's about Liheng..."

Qi Liheng was her son, six years old this year.

"He's reached the age to begin his education..."

As the son of a scholar, such matters would normally have been the father's responsibility. But this child had no father. Though there were a few private schools and community schools in the city, she couldn't afford tuition now. Frankly, she wasn't comfortable sending a fatherless child to such places where all sorts of people mixed.

"...I know Sir must be a man of excellent learning and upright character. Might I trouble you to begin Liheng's education and explain the texts to him?" Fearing he might find it bothersome, she quickly added: "I'll pay the tuition once I receive my wages."
