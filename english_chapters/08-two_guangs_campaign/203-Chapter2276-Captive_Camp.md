# Chapter 2276: Captive Camp

Yi Haoran followed him to the Sanheui parade ground, seeing Australian barbed wire fences erected around the parade ground, layer upon layer. Several wooden structured towers were also built. Lanterns were suspended, with sentries carrying live ammunition on top. Yi Haoran couldn't help sighing secretly.

There were guard towers and abatis at the entrance, but interrogation was not rigorous. Chang Qingyun had a waist pass for entry and exit; taking it out to flash a bit, then saying to the sentry: "This is an accountant friend of mine from the city, coming to the camp to collect a debt." The sentry didn't interrogate either, just nodded and let them in.

Defense lax! Yi Haoran thought secretly; saying so, there was an opportunity here!

Entering the camp, it was like entering a small town. Original barracks were naturally allocated as dormitories to settle captives. Even on the parade ground, longhouses were built with timber and straw to shelter captives. These longhouses were built using waste materials from cleaning ruins after the Wuzhou battle, very crude. But the capacity ratio was very large.

Longhouses and barracks were divided into groups of different sizes. Between groups, bamboo fences more than a person high separated them, tops sharpened and hardened by fire. Each group had a separate door and guard tower. Small paths connected groups. Arranged in perfect order.

Coming in from the entrance, there was a straight main road paved with river sand. On both sides were bamboo fence walls and doors of groups. A signboard hung at the door of each group, writing the group number and accommodated number in large characters.

There were guard posts at the door, several able-bodied men sitting or standing, all wearing past government troop uniforms—only the ink character on the the patches on front and back changed from "Brave" to "Security." These people either carried iron rulers or wore waist knives; there were also spears and shields in the guard post, but looking at their appearance, they were very lax. Some dilly-dallying, chatting, playing leaf cards, napping on the table; all kinds were present.

Gates of various groups were all wide open; seeing people coming in and out, no one interrogated either. A few able-bodied men guarding the gate recognized Yi Haoran; they greeted him when he walked past.

Yi Haoran was secretly happy in his heart. Seeing few people in various groups, and even fewer pedestrians on the road, those present were also hurried. He asked: "Where did people go?"

"It's daytime now, all went out to work." Chang Qingyun said, "Australians don't let people eat white rice..."

"Working on what?"

"Didn't you see all? Repairing city walls, clearing ruins, all done by us. Now also tell them to cut wood, dig ditches, load and unload goods..."

"Wait, you said load and unload what?" Yi Haoran suddenly interrupted him.

"Load and unload goods." Chang Qingyun said impatiently, "What's strange about this?"

"Load and unload what goods?"

"Of course Australian goods." Chang Qingyun said Australians had boat convoys arriving in Wuzhou every day recently, bringing many goods, now all stored in the Three Headquarters.

"Old friend, what do you say Australians transport so many goods to Wuzhou for?"

"Need that be said? Naturally for use in frontline fighting."

"But inside this Wuzhou city, although Hair thieves increased troops, it's only a few hundred people. For a few hundred people, need transporting goods in such large quantities?"

Chang Qingyun hadn't thought about this problem. He thought and said: "Probably for use in attacking Guangxi."

Yi Haoran nodded. Now commercial travel in Wuzhou was not connecting; Australians suddenly transporting quantities of goods over, could only be pre-stocking for war—seemed Governor Xiong's luck was more bad than good.

Walking all the way, saw a crossroads ahead. Turns out this camp used two roads, north-south and east-west, intersecting perpendicularly as main roads. Clearly a captive camp here, yet at the crossroads there were actually a dozen or so stalls, selling snacks, tea and wine, and letter writing and fortune telling... Looking roughly, it resembled a rural market town.

"There are also people doing business here?!" Yi Haoran was really surprised this time—long heard Australians were most skilled in the art of merchants, didn't expect they actually did business to this extent!

"Aren't Australians most skilled at doing business?" Chang Qingyun was not surprised, "These stalls are all allowed to open by Australians; goods sold are also provided by Australians..."

"But aren't these all captives, where comes money?"

"Going out to work, Australians will give you score points," Chang Qingyun entered the palace a second time, very familiar with this Australian set, "Then give you a kind of ticket, can be used as money in the camp..." Saying so he pulled out a paper piece about an inch size from his pocket.

Yi Haoran took it to look; it was a white paper strip, "Token Coupon" in Song typeface on top, "One Fen" in Regular script below.

"Sesame cakes sold at the sesame cake stall here is three Fen." Chang Qingyun said, "Spending two Fen can buy a bowl of vegetarian rice noodles. Although camp provides meals, doesn't guarantee full, nor guarantee good. Working much gets hungry fast; having this can buy some food, more or less supplement. If accumulating much, calling a woman to do business isn't a hard thing either."

"There are also fireworks women here?!" Now Yi Haoran’s mouth almost couldn't close.

"Not counted as clearing the bright road." Chang Qingyun said, "Counted as secret doors, but Australians won't interfere if knowing."

Yi Haoran didn't know whether to laugh or cry. In his view, since becoming a captive prisoner, being driven to work was perfectly justified—going to work, at any rate having a bowl of rice to eat, at least wouldn't starve to death.

Didn't expect here not only had food and drink, but even prostitutes. How was this still a captive camp! No wonder thousands of people in this captive camp could actually be peaceful.

"Hair thieves fake mercy, fake benevolence."

"This statement is wrong," Chang Qingyun shook his head, "Australians are not fake benevolent, actually calculating shrewdly. Driving with whips, everyone takes slowdown as ability; how many overseers do you need to make people work hard? Now having this calculating points to issue rewards, if you want to eat more, enjoy more, naturally will exert effort. Using fewer overseers, and not making workers breed resentment, isn't it brilliant?"

"Old friend, looks like you do this prisoner of Hair thieves with quite some flavor and taste." Yi Haoran’s words contained sarcasm.

Chang Qingyun also felt a slip of tongue, coughed dryly a few times: "A bit of experience gained only."

Passing the "market" at the crossroads, Chang Qingyun led him to turn into the gate of a group. There were five longhouses and several independent small huts in this group. Although looking carefully all were built with extremely simple waste materials plus bamboo poles and thatch, the appearance was still regular.

People here were slightly more than in front, moreover there were old people, women and children, completely different from groups mainly consisting of male young adults seen in front.

Once Chang Qingyun came in, someone greeted him. Chang Qingyun greeted all the way.

Yi Haoran felt houses here seemed slightly better than houses in the groups he saw in front.

"Said correctly, detained here are all officials and family dependents captured from various places. Australians value them more, rarely asking them to work; houses are also slightly better."

"Which building does Old Friend live in?"

"Just here." Chang Qingyun pointed to an independent small hut by the side, "Since here, just come into humble abode to sit."

The building Chang Qingyun lived in was divided into east and west two rooms. He lived in the west room. The door was woven bamboo strips, walls were reed mats. Pushing the door to enter, on the mud floor there was only a bamboo couch, a desk, an old chair directly. Could be called crude to the extreme, only heavily swept clean inside. Whether the old blanket on the bamboo couch, or the Four Treasures of the Study on the desk, or the conical hat and straw raincoat hanging on the wall... all arranged neatly.

What made Yi Haoran most strange was that in the middle of this room actually placed a gigantic painting table, on which placed various painting tools and papers, extremely exquisite.

"Unexpectedly your place is so tidy!" Yi Haoran couldn't dream in a dream that inside this Australian "prison camp" was such an appearance! Although he hadn't squatted in a big prison, he had been an advisor for many years, seeing much and knowing much, witnessing various prison cells. None wasn't dark and damp, dirty and smelly unbearable. Didn't expect there was actually such a clean and tidy prison cell!

"Can't tell Old Friend is a person loving clean and knowing how to tidy up..." Yi Haoran praised, "And also has elegant interest!"

"Hehe," Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly gesturing him to sit, "I love clean is true; knowing how to tidy up, how can be mentioned! In the past served by young servants—now although Chang Qing is also in the camp, cannot serve me at all times. Australians are most particular about hygiene; if they find a 'non-compliance', inevitably pants stripped at crossroads to suffer whips—I can't afford losing this face, can only do it well myself."

Yi Haoran nodded. He was very interested in the painting table in Chang Qingyun’s small hut, walked around the painting table once, seeing several painting scrolls on the table, and an unfinished flower-and-bird painting spread flat on the surface.

Chang Qingyun skilled in calligraphy and painting, Yi Haoran knew. Back then in the Shogunate, there were also quite a few people singing poems and paintings with him. But now he was squatting in a big prison; even if Australians treated him well, they wouldn't specially get pigments and painting paper for him.

"Old Friend has not small elegant interest, finding joy in suffering ah." Yi Haoran laughed, saying so picked up a painting scroll by the side wanting to open.

"Careful! Careful!" Seing him about to open the painting scroll, Chang Qingyun hurriedly stood up saying.

"What?" Yi Haoran was baffled.

"Must be careful is right." Chang Qingyun took down the painting scroll in his hand, cautiously spread it open on the painting table, "Hair thieves value these paintings extremely; if soiled, it would take my life..."

Yi Haoran felt a chill in heart. Chang Qingyun saying so, obviously this painting belonged to some Hair thief; otherwise, he wouldn't be so careful. And this painting table and painting tools, mostly related to this painting too!

He looked carefully; saw this was a small sized freehand flower-and-bird. Painting orchids.

To be honest, even with Yi Haoran’s vision, the level of this painting was not high. Wouldn't be Chang Qingyun’s handiwork. Moreover, brush strokes were delicate and weak, appearing rather like a woman's handiwork.

Because there was neither inscription nor signature on the painting, nor poetry, couldn't tell what famous thing it was.

"This..." Yi Haoran looked at Chang Qingyun with inquiring gaze.

"Don't know painted by what person," Chang Qingyun shook head. Saying so told his encounter a few days ago once, "Just took back yesterday, sent new ones again. I looked, unexpectedly all orchids, rather somewhat confused." Saying so he opened several other painting scrolls.
