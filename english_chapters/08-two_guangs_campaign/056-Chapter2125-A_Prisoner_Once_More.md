# Chapter 2125 - A Prisoner Once More

"The troops at Bangshan were household retainers personally trained by Governor Xiong. The commander was Company-Captain Song Ming."

The figure in the shadows seemed to murmur something; someone immediately left the room.

"Where is Song Ming now?"

"On the day you took Bangshan, he fell into the river while crossing. His retainers pulled him out—I heard he was unconscious. After that, no one knew whether he lived or died."

"Anyone else?"

Chang Qingyun hesitated for a second about whether to mention Yi Haoran and Jiang Suo. Then he thought: their identities and actions weren't secret; why cover for them? "Another was the company-captain of the retainer unit, one Jiang Suo."

"Where did these retainers come from? Who trained them?"

"They were all trained by Jiang Suo." Chang Qingyun knew what interested them: how the retainer unit came to be drilled in "Australian methods."

"What's Jiang Suo's background?"

"That, I truly do not know—" Seeing their expressions, an old memory sent a chill down his spine. He hurriedly added: "Jiang Suo is a student of Yi Haoran, who serves on Governor Xiong's staff."

The figure in the shadows seemed to say something else; the recorder immediately sent a slip of paper outside.

No doubt they were sending men to search for Yi Haoran and Jiang Suo. Whether those two had escaped...

"What's Yi Haoran's background, and how did Jiang Suo come to know him?"

Chang Qingyun had tasted the iron fist of the Council of Elders before; he dared not hold back. He explained Yi Haoran's history, how he had been sent to purchase "Australian muskets" and had brought back Jiang Suo along the way; how the two of them had been dispatched by Governor Xiong to Guizhou to recruit retainers and then to Guangxi to "train troops." He rambled on, afraid that leaving out any detail would anger the interrogating "cadre."

"Tell us everything you know about Jiang Suo."

Chang Qingyun described his impressions: Jiang Suo was extremely reclusive, rarely interacting with anyone except Yi Haoran. He was meticulous in his work, thoroughly familiar with Australian firearms, techniques, and drill. He showed no interest in women, no taste for luxury, and was utterly indifferent to money.

"...A strange fellow."

Half an hour later, the interrogation concluded. The examiners called two soldiers to take him out. As he was led away, he heard the man in the shadows speaking:

"Arrange it like this... All POWs, regardless of whether they're literate, go to the isolation camp first. Make sure they're kept busy—they should contribute to rebuilding Wuzhou during isolation. At the same time, screen them carefully. Anyone who looted, murdered, abetted atrocities, or is widely hated—if there's an accusation, investigate. Once confirmed, they go into a separate group. We'll hold war-criminal trials. The Council of Elders is building rule of law in Guangdong; don't let emotion rule..."

Chang Qingyun hadn't yet stepped through the door, so he heard every word. His instinct told him the speaker must be a real Australian—only a real Australian would speak with such unhurried authority, and only a real Australian would speak of scholars with such casual disdain.

"A prisoner once more! A captive!" Chang Qingyun burned with shame. It would almost have been better to be trampled to death in the chaos or cut down by rioters when the city fell. Instead, he had clung to life, and—just as at Chengmai—his legs had gone weak at the sight of the guns. Captured by the Hair-Bandits, he lacked even the courage to dash his head against the wall. And before his captors, not only could he not utter a single "no," he had eagerly spilled everything, falling over himself to ingratiate.

Head bowed, too ashamed to meet anyone's gaze, he let the soldiers lead him to the wall, where a row of sally ports had been converted into a makeshift detention center for prisoners requiring "custody" after initial screening. At that moment, Chang Qingyun felt utterly desolate. After his capture at Chengmai, they had been held in a POW camp, forced to endure the humiliation of having their hair shaved and being bathed, and to labor every day building roads. For someone like Chang Qingyun who had never "done manual work," it was "nearly death." If not for Qian Taichong's constant care, he might well have died of exhaustion before his family's ransom arrived.

Given the Hair-Bandits' habits, he would likely have to go through all of that again—only this time without Qian Taichong.

Thinking of Qian Taichong, Chang Qingyun felt a pang of guilt. When he was ransomed, he had promised Qian Taichong that once he reached the mainland, he would raise money to ransom him too. But after getting out and doing the math, he had been reluctant to part with the money—especially after hearing that his family had sold farmland to pay his ransom. The thought pained him so much that he had simply put the matter out of his mind.

He wondered what had become of Qian Taichong... Could he have been worked to death by the Hair-Bandits by now?

If so, this was his own retribution...

Chang Qingyun sighed in despair. When the retained yamen runners brought food and water for the prisoners, he didn't touch it.

Just as Chang Qingyun sat with eyes closed, agonizing over what to do, the old man distributing food roused him—a veteran clerk from the yamen with whom he was acquainted.

"Master Chang, just accept your fate. Never mind that no one knows whether Governor Xiong is alive or dead right now—even if you hadn't been captured by the Australians, the court would have arrested you for trial. Working on his staff, you'd probably be implicated! Earlier, Master Yi said he had a plan—and what came of it? All for nothing. Even if you won't think of yourself, think of your wife and children at home. At least the Hair-Bandits don't slaughter innocents."

He was right. Having been captured, his integrity was already lost; better to cling to life. Perhaps with his battered body he could still serve his parents, support his wife and children...

"You're an educated man who understands reason. I've watched the Austr—the Australians; they're quite reasonable, and they treat people decently. If Your Honor just bows his head a little, it'll pass..."

After all, his hair had already been shaved once; shaving it again was no great matter. And he had done roadwork before. Maybe he could survive it again.

Having thought it through, Chang Qingyun resigned himself. He took a wooden bowl, ladled out a bowl of porridge from the bucket, and drank it down.

That afternoon, he and the other prisoners were marched outside the city to clear rubble. With two prior experiences as a POW, Chang Qingyun's movements were practiced; he even anticipated orders before they were given. Within days, he had become a model "reform-through-labor activist."

Xu Ke studied the interrogation transcripts. Clearly, Jiang Suo was the "spy" mentioned in Lone Wolf's intelligence. Piecing together information from various sources, this man seemed to have served in the Fubo Army at some point. Xu Ke ordered an inquiry sent by telegram to the Fubo Army General Staff's Political Department in Lingao, requesting a check of military desertion and defection records for anyone named "Jiang Suo."

"If the Political Department has nothing, we'll have to comb the service rosters—that'll be like searching for a needle in a haystack," Xu Ke thought. "I wonder if Lone Wolf knows anything about this Jiang Suo."

The contact signal for Lone Wolf had already been sent. As soon as he entered the city, Xu Ke had applied the External Intelligence Bureau's emergency contact protocol: a coded symbol painted on the spirit wall of the Cangwu County yamen. If Lone Wolf saw it, he would find a way to make contact.

But so far, no one had appeared. Xu Ke worried: could Lone Wolf be dead?

The city had been in chaos before and during the assault; many had died. If he really was dead, that would be a tremendous loss...

He was lost in thought when he saw the newly appointed Wuzhou Military Government Director, Xie Erren, hurrying out with his entourage. Spotting Xu Ke in contemplation, Xie Erren came over with a smile and greeted him:

"Well, I'm about to leave your jurisdiction. I'll be counting on your strong support from now on."

Xie Erren had just arrived from Zhaoqing the day before. As Wuzhou's military government director—and future mayor—he had heavy responsibilities. But for most of the journey, he had essentially been working for Xu Ke. The Guangdong campaign involved a vast area and many prisoners; a thousand loose ends, far too much for Xu Ke's small team to handle alone.

"Nonsense—you're the one with the heavy burden." Xu Ke gazed at Wuzhou's battered walls. "Holding Wuzhou won't be easy."

"With the Council of Elders and the Fubo Army behind me, these are minor matters!" Xie Erren brimmed with confidence.

Before crossing into this timeline, Xie Erren had been a reporter at *Oriental Monday* in a southern city, making a living by digging up embarrassing stories from other provinces. Before the Crossing, he had heard through a contact in the police that a group of pyramid-scheme cultists had rented an abandoned camp for a "great training session."

Having gone three months without a cover story, he sensed a scoop: "interest value, proximity, sensationalism"—all the boxes checked. If this story broke, a department head position was a sure thing, maybe even a seat on the editorial board the following year.

So Xie Erren volunteered to go undercover. Every day he trained alongside five hundred people, stifling laughter as he waited to see these fools embarrass themselves. Then, on D-Day, he turned out to be the fool.

Though he hadn't suffered an immediate mental breakdown, he did spend a period in depression—nearly killing himself.

After working as basic labor for over half a year, he finally accepted reality: there was no going back; he might as well make the best of life in the Ming Dynasty and become an "aristocrat."

Though he was a hundred times more professional as a media practitioner than Ding Ding—watching the *Lingao Times* put out by Ding Ding every day felt like reading a school newsletter—when the chance came to choose a new career, he decisively abandoned media work.

"I've spent my whole life as a mouthpiece, taking money to speak for others. Now I should be the ruling class, deciding what people can and can't say!"

Firmly believing that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," Xie Erren was enthusiastic about all agencies of force. But the military was too professionally specialized; as a keyboard military enthusiast, he had no real prospects there. The Political Security Bureau, with its shady work, offered no chance to satisfy his craving for the spotlight—and it was too easy to get sucked into political struggles. As a former *Oriental Monday* reporter, he had seen far too many examples of political failure.
