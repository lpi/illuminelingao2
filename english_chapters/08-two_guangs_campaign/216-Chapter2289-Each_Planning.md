# Chapter 2289: Each Planning

Of course, regarding tax issue, several Financial Bureau big bosses in Guangzhou had policies; for "Front Line City" like Wuzhou, mainly still controlled by Central, allocated by Central, but locality could also share a part. And looking at current Wuzhou status, Finance and Tax mouth very likely just walked a procedure, allocating summer grain to Wuzhou...

Thinking here, Xie Erren instantly had confidence. Nodded saying: "Your idea not bad! You go back consider details again, touch bottom among merchants again."

Luo Yangming agreed immediately. Then said his suspicion about "Mr. Hao" a bit again, hoping to send a letter to Teng County side "External Check" his background.

"This is simple," Xie Erren wrote down in notebook casually, "I look after Old Zhao to send a document when drafting documents in afternoon is fine." He said again, "If you really suspect, just detain him is fine; passing hall one trial, won't know everything?"

"He didn't do bad things; why arrest him for no reason? I feel he is a talent capable of practical affairs, also an upright gentleman; if no problem can use him. In case he has some sinister intention, arresting only when having evidence makes it easy to make him open mouth."

"Okay, you are expert, I won't interfere your train of thought." Xie Erren mood not bad, "This external check at most a week can have result. You just wait for news."

Luo Yangming got arrow of command, coming back then started handling. Since wanting to raise funds, had to select objects of raising; wasn't easy matter. He suddenly thought, this idea was proposed by Mr. Hao; might as well ask him, seeing what statement he had; if he was really an old fox, maybe could drag out fox tail from this.

Thinking here, he called Li Wensheng and Yi Haoran both coming without exposing voice and expression; said matter that Chief already agreed raising capital from merchants to buy grain. Pretended mysterious saying again:

"Currently this is still secret; Chief handed this matter to me to handle. Have to have this charter: You two I know, are people having gully in chest; please advise one or two."

Li Wensheng didn't know True Meaning in Employer's heart, smiled: "What good to advise on this! As long as having silver to earn, various merchant families not rushing coming like flies seeing blood—once news released, our shop threshold will be stepped broken."

Yi Haoran kept wariness instead; he knew this Employer already suspected himself; even if he wasn't Australian spy, now was serving Australian too. Self must respond carefully.

He recalled various things before; decided regarding this matter shouldn't avoid, otherwise appearing harboring ghost in heart instead. Immediately proposed slightly showing excitement: "This matter truly is benefiting country benefiting people! With Student's humble view, among local merchants, richest is Pingma Firms; but now they mostly hiding and concealing; having silver won't take out either; next is Rice Valley trading firms—Employer is clearer than anyone about situation of this trade; then is Silk Cloth Guild. Silk cloth business eats capital very heavy; although trampled by Xiong Wencan once, always have some capital remaining..."

"Sir words have reason." seeing him not concealing, pointing topic to Silk Guild in three five sentences, Luo Yangming was very smart, immediately thought of Jiang Qiuchan—Miss Jiang was Ding A-tao’s best friend; Hao Ran was recommended to own shop by Jiang Qiuchan through Ding A-tao’s relationship...

So it was like this. Luo Yangming thought, this was throwing peach repaying plum, wanting to drag Jiang family a hand. Maybe still had some benefit inside. Thinking here, his suspicion on Mr. Hao lightened slightly—at least on this matter he bad no conspiracy, purely skirt string relation style seeking profit only.

"Silk Guild is not bad; just who specifically to undertake?" He asked deliberately.

Hao Ran laughed drily a few times, said: "As far as Student knows, Ruijintang Jiang family always willing to depend on Senate actively; Master can pay attention."

Luo Yangming nodded slightly: "Shopkeeper Jiang? Since he took over his father's business shop didn't have any special improvement either; talent of guarding success."

"Yes, exactly because only can guard success, now military chaos horse confusion, he wanting to guard success afraid can't guard either; willing to come out to gamble."

"Since you recommend his family so, then tomorrow I go see him."

"This, where needs Master to go see; send A-Chun to pass a word, he inevitably comes to visit." Yi Haoran said intentionally making anxious look.

Seeing him so anxious, Luo Yangming reassured somewhat instead. Always this Mr. Hao even if government old person, he a scholar trapped here, couldn't make any big trouble. Just wait for Teng County external check result coming out; knocking him then looking at situation.

"Now I am suspected at Luo Yangming's place; things must speed up." Yi Haoran observed surroundings carefully, confirming no one noticing them, low voice whispered.

"General Song sent Zhang Yong to contact me." Jiang Suo propped pole, "He there all proper. I here also settled manpower well, only waiting to move hand. Just Advisor Chang side has no news; not seeing him come out for quite a few days."

Yi Haoran hearing Chang Qingyun had no news, unconsciously worried secretly: this Juren Chang consistently lacked bone spirit; self coerced him with handle; in case this person couldn't endure inner pressure to report would be ten thousand matters resting.

Happened currently quite a few matters still needed him this person convenient to walk to contact. This was also reason why he wanted to risk pulling him into gang back then.

"Want or not find people to contact him..."

"Temporarily not; place he stays people many eyes mixed; too eye-catching."

"This doesn't hinder; having a newly joined brother, serving right in Sanheui. Let him go look first—if no abnormality, sending a letter quietly inviting him out is fine."

"Good, just do as you said."

Turns out this Chang Qingyun was forced to be "Adopted Father" of Sun Qiaoniang; that night counted as holding "Wedding." Liu Youwang was a boor, didn't care about what three media four betroals routine; however people holding stinky feet in camp were many. Liu Youwang wanting to "Marry," immediately someone came to arrange auditorium; someone came to send congratulatory gifts; not yet night, even wine banquet set up.

Chang Qingyun originally unwilling to be "Adopted Father," but dared not resist either; also confusedly put on new clothes. Two strong servant women guarding Sun Qiaoniang came to "Kowtow Adopted Father." This girl life or death unwilling to bow; was pressed kneeling down forcefully kowtowing three times hard. Chang Qingyun shame hard to bear; turned face sideways dared not look at her.

Next was a toss; Chang Qingyun was like marionette; others wanting him to do what did what; completely lost feeling; as if having a nightmare.

This farce until nearly third watch considered stopping. Liu Youwang and his fox group dog party naturally drank to unconsciousness; Chang Qingyun this "Adopted Father-in-law" was also poured to seven ups eight downs. Until second day afternoon woke up on bed of own dormitory.

Wine woke, Chang Qingyun was full heart of regret. Self not only had no courage to help Sun Qiaoniang protect chastity; instead aided King Zhou to do evil, acting as what "Adopted Father." Still drank dead drunk swallowing anger on "Wedding Banquet."

Originally he wanted to find Yi Haoran immediately to discuss riot matter; however that night spread news of Sun Qiaoniang committing suicide. Liu Youwang thundered with rage; involving Chang Qingyun also arrested; baffled suffering a beating. Released after two days.

Sun Qiaoniang’s suicide gave Chang Qingyun huge stimulation; her miserable helpless cry for help "Master save me" when dragged away after forced to kowtow seemed to echo in his ears all the time. Chang Qingyun this life didn't have many times of heroic intense; having was also three minutes heat. However this time, he made up mind; even sacrificing life had to do with Hair thief to end!

Once receiving meeting news internal line passed to him, Chang Qingyun found an excuse leaving Labor Camp, contacting with Yi Haoran.

Yi Haoran at this time already knew matters in camp; seeing Chang Qingyun, in three words two sentences knew already not Ameng of Wu (not same person as before); then told him current action plan quietly.

Core of plan was exactly that suggestion of Gou Xunli: raiding Prefecture Yamen, capturing or beheading Xie Erren. Speaking simple doing not easy. Garrison inside and outside Wuzhou City although not many, stationed echoing each other; various contacts convenient; troop reaction speed very fast. Wanting to sneak attack wasn't so easy.

Biggest obstacle was the Infantry Company stationed in Three Headquarters; this was core of Wuzhou Garrison. Could say, as long as this company existed, they shouldn't think about raiding successfully inside Wuzhou City.

Secondly was four squadrons under National Army Wuzhou Battalion. Although equipment training level of these four squadrons uneven; majority soldiers even had no muskets; but combat power of these people however bad, bandits under Second Master Gou were not opponents. Only war soldiers under Song Ming could fight a battle.

Australians defense inside city, Yi Haoran roughly figured out: Wuzhou itself very small; Luo Yangming’s rice shop was also responsible for rationing of military food; plus Wen Iron Head often came to shop to chat; from his mouth could also get quite a few news.

"...This True Hair usually lives and works in Prefecture Yamen; night goes to Three Headquarters to stay overnight. Neither of these two places is easy to start hand." Yi Haoran said lightly.

Three Headquarters not only had Line Infantry Company, also had part of National Army; could be called heavy troops guarding. And City Defense Command and National Army Wuzhou Battalion Headquarters were set in Cangwu County Yamen next to Prefecture Yamen. A strongest National Army squadron directly guarded Prefecture Yamen and adjacent Nanxun Gate and Dezheng Gate. One place having alarm, various places could come to aid in very short time.

Wanting to imitate Hou Dagou old trick, sneaking attack entering city, arresting great officer was almost impossible. Even if luckily breaking into city, would fall into heavy siege quickly, sending death in vain.

Wanting plan to succeed, had to "Tune Tiger Leaving Mountain." This kind of chance could be met not sought; Yi Haoran wanted to pull Chang Qingyun into gang, also had attempt of wanting to make trouble in Sanheui; whether organizing riot or arson, could pin down a National Army squadron here.
