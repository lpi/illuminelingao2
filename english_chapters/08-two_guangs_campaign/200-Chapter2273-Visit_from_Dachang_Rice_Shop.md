# Chapter 2273: Visit from Dachang Rice Shop

The next day, Yi Haoran met Song Ming at the Dragon Mother Temple. This young general no longer had the spirited and heroic appearance of a few months ago, appearing aged and down and out. Standing under the steps of the Dragon Mother Temple, he was no different from the multitude of sentient beings coming to offer incense and seek comfort because of hard times.

Song Ming and Yi Haoran had a life-and-death friendship because of the Bang Mountain relationship back then. After meeting, without empty words, Yi Haoran went straight to the theme, telling him his attempt.

"...This matter concerns greatly, and risks are extremely high. If General is unwilling to participate, Student won't force..."

Song Ming waved his hand, whispering: "Sir, why say such words! We eat the Lord's salary, strive to kill enemies; horse leather wrapping corpse is a matter of course."

Yi Haoran’s heart warmed: Turmoil reveals loyal subjects. Ancients truly didn't deceive me!

Song Ming told him that he and the remaining few dozen people were hiding in a broken temple in a mountain col at the eastern foot of White Cloud Mountain, less than ten *li* from Wuzhou.

Forty-seven soldiers under command. Not many, but all elite combat soldiers—both his own personal soldiers and the "New Army" house guards commanded by Jiang Suo gathered later. Weapons and armor were complete, and there were also some firearms.

At that time, possessing nearly fifty fully armored and equipped personal soldiers and house guards was elite combat power, enough to charge into battle formations and overcome enemies to win victory.

"...Although close to Wuzhou, it is a secluded place in the mountains. We hibernate here temporarily, considered quiet too."

"What about provisions? I heard Zhang Yong say relying entirely on rich households 'assisting'; fear it's not a long-term plan either."

Since ancient times, an army without provisions is not stable. Although Song Ming had few subordinates, monthly provisions were not a small number. Relying only on nearby rich households, over time would inevitably become a burden—rich people could do anything to get rid of a burden.

"What I worry about is exactly this." Song Ming nodded, "Old saying rabbits don't eat grass by the burrow; this is a reason Jianghu heroes all understand. Thus I dare not demand too much in the surroundings now, to avoid causing changes, only can send people far away to hit grain."

So-called hitting grain was robbery. In various armies at the end of Ming, this was considered normal, nothing rare. Yi Haoran didn't find it strange either, only worried: "You have few people, and have to go far to hit grain. If harvest is big it's fine; if harvest is small, it won't cover dry rations on the road! If losing a few more brothers, then it's a big loss."

"Sir is right, only right now can only do so." Song Ming sighed, "If can have a merit on body, wouldn't be so embarrassed."

Actually he had long thought of gathering remnants to retreat to Hunan. However, the officialdom of Two Guangs had collapsed; Xiong Wencan and a group of bigwigs' whereabouts were unknown. Retreating to Hunan, he still had no place to settle—might even be expelled or eliminated by local village braves. This was also the main reason Song Ming was willing to follow Yi Haoran to take risks.

Yi Haoran understood tacitly. The two agreed on how to contact each other, then dispersed.

Yi Haoran was different from bureaucrats; he wouldn't discuss for a long time without decision, nor look forward and backward—if so, he would have died on the way of fleeing from Liaodong back then. Coming out of Dragon Mother Temple, he went non-stop to the city to inquire about the latest news of Hair thieves.

Hair thieves erected a newspaper reading board in front of the Wuzhou Municipal Government, posting "Lingao Times," "Yangcheng Express," and a local newspaper "Wuzhou Highlights." Except for Wuzhou Highlights, the other two newspapers took several days to arrive once, so newspapers didn't update daily, but updated once every seven days.

Yi Haoran went to read newspapers at fixed times, with the purpose of nothing else but grasping Hair thieves' movements. For him trapped in Wuzhou, these three newspapers were his only source of news currently. From eighteen provinces under heaven to all Guangdong and even the entire Wuzhou, news was all complete, very convenient.

He actually didn't quite understand why Hair thieves wanted to distribute these things facing commoners and the masses: they neither served as officials nor engaged in commerce; the farthest place they went in a lifetime was probably the county seat or prefecture seat. Even if literate and knowing news of the Imperial Court and distant places, what use was it?

Regardless of Australian intentions, Yi Haoran had to admit that Hair thieves' news was both accurate and fast—compared to Daming's official news sources like Residence Reports and Pond Reports in the past, simply could be called godspeed. And the "news" reported comprehensively on newspapers gave him a rare viewpoint to grasp the overall situation.

As for right now, although Hair thieves occupied Guangdong and eyed Guangxi covetously, the occupied places were unstable, alarms everywhere. The situation was not peaceful. Judging from the endless stream of boat convoys coming and going on river surfaces like Xijiang and Guijiang, Hair thieves were utilizing waterways to move troops everywhere to suppress, seemingly tired of running around. Right now Hair thieves' military force in Wuzhou was empty; exactly a good chance to strike!

He looked leisurely and contentedly at news of riots everywhere on the newspaper, secretly rejoicing in his heart. Suddenly a voice came from beside his ear: "Mr. Yi!"

The voice was very familiar. Yi Haoran was startled, turned his head to look, it was indeed Ah Chun. Couldn't help relaxing his heart, saying: "Why are you not in the shop?"

"Madam asked me to run errands." Ah Chun said, "Mr. Hao, didn't you go out to collect accounts? Why came to the city?"

Yi Haoran originally said he went to a certain town to collect accounts as an excuse—recently he went out to collect accounts almost every day. Everyone didn't mind; after all, there was no work in the shop. Him going out once, more or less could collect some account money back, always good for the shop.

"Accounts not collected. I saw it was still early; came back to the city and walked around to relax." Yi Haoran responded calmly.

"Authorized Advisor has such interest. Now in military chaos, Madam instructed us to go on the street less if nothing to do. Advisor you go out of city to collect accounts also be more careful. Heard these days floating corpses often drift by the riverside—all said to be robbed and killed by bandits and thieves."

"This I know." Yi Haoran smiled, "What matter did you go do for Madam?"

"What matter can be done? Just asking Master to hurry back." Ah Chun said with a face of indifference, "Master is not at home all day, no one manages matters in the shop. Look, a traveling merchant finally came to the shop to discuss business, but the shopkeeper went out again. Only Madam and Concubine Wen are at home..."

Luo Yangming basically went out at dawn and didn't come back until dark. Not only Li Wensheng, even Ding A-tao was full of complaints about him. Yi Haoran didn't mind, saying: "Since so, you go deliver the letter. I'll go back first to receive the guest."

"Okay, Advisor you go back quickly. Madam must be anxious!"

Yi Haoran couldn't care to read newspapers anymore, hurriedly returned to the shop. Saw Wen Yun looking around at the door. Seeing him back, hurriedly patted her chest saying: "Thank Heaven and Earth, finally a man came back! Not a single man at home, happened to have a guest come."

Yi Haoran smiled: "Is Ah Chun not a man?"

"What man does Ah Chun count as, he is even a few years younger than me," Wen Yun face full of disdain, "If not for Madam forbidding me to go out, I would rather go find Master myself..."

"Where is the guest? Let me go chat with him for a moment first." Yi Haoran put down the umbrella and account book, asking.

"Just in the living room behind the account room." Wen Yun said, "He sits there dryly alone. Madam forbids me to greet him, only sent a cup of tea. Can't let him sit dryly like this, so asked Old Mama Kong who helps in kitchen to serve outside..."

"You go reply to Madam, say I'll help greet for a while first, Master will come back shortly."

"This is good now!" Wen Yun patted her chest, "Otherwise Madam would scold me again!"

Yi Haoran wondered: "Master not at home, why does Madam scold you?"

Wen Yun said: "Madam says I'm useless, can't keep Master's heart..."

Yi Haoran smiled: "You are wronged to death. Master goes out to handle serious business, not for romance between sons and daughters."

"Wronged to death also get scolded!" Wen Yun pouted her nose and mouth and went inside.

Yi Haoran entered the living room—called living room, actually just a small wing room, used to receive customers. Furnishings extremely simple. A middle-aged man sat upright on the official hat chair.

Judging from his exquisite yet low-key dressing, he was a successful businessman. Yi Haoran dared not neglect, cupping hands: "This Master..."

The comer waited in the living room for quite a while. Not to mention seeing Luo Yangming, not even a person came out to greet. Yet his responsibility couldn't allow him to flick his sleeves and leave. Just feeling irritable, suddenly saw a middle-aged scholar come out to greet, stood up to return courtesy:

"Dare not, humble surname Zhu, given name Fuyuan, runner for Dachang Rice Shop..."

"Oh, is it Dachang Rice Shop of Guangzhou?" Yi Haoran said.

Zhu Fuyuan blinked his eyes, said: "Sir knows humble shop name?"

Yi Haoran secretly cursed himself for being talkative. Didn't this admit he had stayed in Guangzhou? he hurriedly covered up: "Honorable shop name implies loud fame, heard of, heard of..."

"Oh..."

Yi Haoran feared he would continue questioning, hurriedly introduced himself: "Humble surname Hao, given name Ran. Accountant of this shop. Now Master and Shopkeeper are both out. Have sent someone to deliver letter. Please Master Zhu wait a moment longer."

"Easy to say, easy to say," Zhu Fuyuan took out a handkerchief from his sleeve, wiped the sweat all over his head, "I came here specially to see Master Luo; waiting a while longer doesn't matter."

This aroused Yi Haoran’s interest. Because he knew Luo Yangming’s background slightly from chats with Li Wensheng and others; he wasn't a big merchant in Wuzhou City, just a medium merchant doing local rice and grain business.

Wuzhou's rice shops all purchased from Guangxi and sold to Guangdong. But Yuxin’s Guangdong business went to Sanshui at the farthest. Never heard Li Wensheng or Ding A-tao mention he had dealings with Guangzhou rice merchants. Furthermore, Dachang had great fame in Guangzhou. Although didn't know if it had Hair thieves' capital, Dachang colluding deeply with Hair thieves was no secret in Guangzhou.

A runner gentleman of a Guangzhou rice shop with connections to Hair thieves, specially running to Wuzhou to see Luo Yangming who never had business dealings in the past, exactly what intention?

He intended to fish for the other party's words, so he entertained diligently. Seeing sweat beads continuously on his forehead, he ordered Old Mama Kong to bring herbal tea, and specially sent melons and fruits for him to relieve heat. Then chatted some gossip about Wuzhou local customs and conditions.
