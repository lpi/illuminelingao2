# Chapter 2323 - Going to Wuzhou (II)

"Too thoughtful," Ji Xin praised after looking at the room, "Old Xie, you really have a taste for life."

This was originally a casual compliment, but to Xie Erren, who had a guilty conscience, it sounded like something was off. He gave a dry laugh and said, "This courtyard was originally a place where I came to stay for a while to relax. I also receive comrade Senators here. Of course, I have to make it comfortable. There are orderlies here—transferred from the army. Very reliable people. Just ask them to do whatever you need."

As he spoke, he called out, and four sturdy young men came over, all wearing the National Army uniforms and equipped with pistols.

"These are the chiefs from the Central Government. From now on, you will listen to the commands of the two chiefs. Take good care of their daily life, and be responsible for security when going out. Understood?"

The four stood at attention together and gave a loud "Yes".

"You guys rest first, I won't disturb you much. Let me know when you start the investigation, I will fully cooperate."

Chen Baibin felt that Xie Erren spoke calmly and was hospitable. There was absolutely no sense of worry or hasty response like Zhao Yingong when the Hangzhou Station was investigated back then. H unconsciously had a somewhat favorable impression of him.

Ji Xin nodded and said, "No hurry, let's officially start work from tomorrow."

The words "No hurry" made Xie Erren's heart skip a beat again, and he couldn't help but wonder what these words meant. He perfunctorily agreed: "Good, good, then I'll go to work first."

Watching Xie Erren leave hurriedly, Chen Baibin whispered: "This Senator Xie looks quite capable."

"To be the chief administrator of the Wuzhou area, naturally he must have some ability." Ji Xin said.

An orderly came in and brought the luggage of the two inside. According to the rules, the life luggage of a Senator could only be opened by his maid. The orderly only sent the boxes in and retreated. The two organized the luggage themselves. The main house had three rooms; the middle one counted as the office, and the east and west rooms were their bedrooms.

The orderly brought tea in: "Report! The bath water is ready."

Saying that, he turned to leave. Ji Xin stopped him and took out a sheet of white paper.

"Write down the names and simple resumes of all the personnel in your service group."

"Yes, Chief!" The orderly was somewhat baffled, but the chief's order was greater than the sky. He immediately took the pen and wrote crookedly on the white paper.

Ji Xin took the paper and read it once, put it in the folder, and asked: "You are the squad leader Zhou Chuyi?"

"Report Chief! Yes."

"When did you arrive in Wuzhou?"

"A week ago, Chief!"

"Why were you sent here?"

"Superiors said Wuzhou applied to transfer us here to serve the chiefs."

"What was the specific situation of the courtyard when you came here? I mean, the layout and furnishing of the house."

"Same as today!" Zhou Chuyi answered crisply, "After we came, we just cleaned every day, waiting for the chiefs' arrival."

"Alright, you may go."

The orderly retreated. Ji Xin stood up and said: "I'll go wash first."

"Okay, just right I also need to pack up my luggage."

Chen Baibin lived in the east room. It could be seen that the furniture in the room was re-furnished because there were still marks left on the wall by the past furniture arrangement. From the marks, what was placed here in the past was not the current simple single bed, but a medium-sized Babu bed (traditional canopy bed).

He opened the clothes trunk by the bed, and a faint fragrance immediately emitted from inside. Chen Baibin had received relevant training in Lingao and immediately smelled that this was the scent of incense used by women to scent clothes.

*A woman lived here?* He was somewhat puzzled.

Returning to the central hall after organizing his luggage, Ji Xin had already changed into pajamas and slippers and returned, drying his hair with a towel.

"You go quickly, the bathroom here is really nice." Ji Xin said, "Not only is there a bathtub, but also a Japanese-style small courtyard! This Old Xie really enjoys life."

Chen Baibin returned from the bath and saw Ji Xin already starting to flip through a pile of documents.

"What is this?"

"These are the documents related to the Wuzhou Incident that Xie Erren just asked someone to send over. Also materials on several cases they are currently investigating."

"The quantity of these documents is quite large." Chen Baibin flipped through a few books casually, "But these documents are done very well, very detailed. Just don't know how the reliability is..." He lowered his voice.

"This depends on us to discover." Ji Xin said, "Before finding problems, tentatively consider them reliable."

"Where to start?"

"First is to comb through the process of the incident. How the enemy came in, how they rushed into Senator Xie's office, how they kidnapped him, and then how he was rescued on the city wall. This process needs to be investigated clearly. Every detail must match the report. Those that don't match must be recorded. We start with text materials first, so that in the next step when we talk to relevant personnel, we can have a definite target and also know if they are lying."

"Understood."

"The Wuzhou Incident also involves a riot at the Sanhezui Labor Camp. The Wuzhou side is still investigating this matter themselves. We won't intervene in the specific investigation for the time being. Wait for them to come up with a conclusion, then we review it."

"Looking at the statement in the secret report, the matter at Sanhezui is not simple."

"This case at Sanhezui involves quite a few things, but I personally feel it won't necessarily involve Xie Erren. The focus of the investigation is still in the city." Ji Xin looked around and asked, "How do you feel about this courtyard?"

"The layout is very comfortable."

"And?"

"Relatively exquisite."

"Don't you feel there is a smell of rouge and powder (femininity) here?"

Chen Baibin widened his eyes: "You also have this feeling?" He immediately mentioned the scent of incense he smelled when putting away clothes just now.

"If I guessed correctly, a woman lived here, and this woman's status was not low." Ji Xin said, "Besides the furniture furnishings being exceptionally exquisite, look at what this 'conference table' in front of us is?"

Chen Baibin looked at the table. He could tell it was high-grade furniture made in this spacetime. The pattern was simple, and the size was large.

"This is called a painting desk. Ordinary people don't have it at home. Only wealthy and leisurely families prepared it for writing calligraphy and painting."

Xie Erren didn't paint. Preparing such a painting table specifically, this person's status was self-evident.

There were no female Senators in Wuzhou. A woman who could live in a key place like the San Zong Fu and had a not-low status, only Xie Erren's maid qualified for this.

But Xie Erren reportedly didn't bring a maid to take office considering Wuzhou was close to the front line before departure. So who was this woman?

They both had an answer in their hearts, that was Cai Lan, termed "retained personnel" in Xie Erren's report, and "mistress" in Luo Yangming's report.

"It should be that Cai Lan." Chen Baibin whispered.

Ji Xin nodded: "However, this place is so big, it's impossible for her to live alone. Have you seen all the houses in this courtyard?"

" haven't seen the East Wing yet."

"I just came out of the bathroom in the West Wing and went to take a look. There were several camp beds and simple furniture inside. It looks like the dormitory for our four orderlies. However, this room was obviously not used as a dormitory originally. Because there is soot accumulated from long-time burning of kerosene lamps on the ceiling."

Kerosene lamps were relatively rare items under the rule of the Senate. Generally, only Senators and high-level naturalized cadres used them. Four orderlies who only came/arrived a week ago had neither the qualification nor the time to leave these traces on the ceiling. In this Wuzhou city, the number of kerosene lamps could probably be counted on one hand, and there were at most three or four users.

"You mean Xie Erren worked in the East Wing."

"Yes. Such thick black soot traces cannot be from naturalized cadres. Only we Senators who like to work at night have such habits."

Chen Baibin understood his meaning. Xie Erren not only took in "Cai Lan" but also cohabited with her here for a long time.

This point, even the Political Security Bureau's top-secret report didn't mention—naturally, Luo Yangming who wrote the report couldn't know the privacy details of these Senators.

If so, then Xie Erren's matter was big. From the perspective of protecting the Senator's personal safety and confidentiality, cohabiting with an indigenous person who hadn't been vetted, wasn't rated, and wasn't even a naturalized citizen was a serious violation of discipline in itself. Not to mention such a person was close at hand to the Senate's confidential materials.

"It seems this glossed-over Cai Lan is an important breakthrough point." Chen Baibin said with some regret, "Pity she already committed suicide—really coincidental!"

Ji Xin nodded and didn't speak. He also didn't believe Cai Lan "committed suicide". But strictly speaking, the person was already dead, no need to struggle with this anymore. He said: "How Cai Lan died is no longer important now. But this matter pointed out the direction for us. We should start the investigation more from the aspect of naturalized citizens."

Naturalized citizens were just one aspect, he thought. Such a big courtyard, with such exquisite furnishings, definitely needed many service personnel. These service personnel were highly likely not naturalized citizens, but indigenous people. Their testimony would actually be more truthful. But where were they now?

He suddenly felt a chill on his back: these people might likely never be found again.

"Then tomorrow we find Luo Yangming to talk first. He is from the Political Security Bureau, and he wrote the report. It's easier to talk, there won't be too much whitewashing and covering up." Chen Baibin suggested.

"Luo Yangming is now the King Bomb (Joker/Trump Card). Us finding him to talk immediately is too direct. It might cause an overreaction—not only bad for Luo Yangming, but even worse for himself." Ji Xin opened his notebook, "I think, start talking with the captured enemy prisoners first. According to the report, two prisoners are relatively important, one named Jiang Suo, one named Yi Haoran. They were the commanders and organizers of the enemy. Starting from them fits the rules."
