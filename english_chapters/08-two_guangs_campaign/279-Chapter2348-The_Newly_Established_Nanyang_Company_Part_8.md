# Chapter 2348: The Newly Established Nanyang Company (Part 8)

Xu Yanliang looked through the roster while jotting down names and personal ID numbers in his notebook—with these numbers, he could access the personnel files of the people he was interested in for a more detailed understanding.

He was concerned about these people's administrative capabilities. That is to say, it was best if they had experience leading a team: to be a "manager" in a pirate group and lead several ships required strong ability; it wasn't something that could be done just by being fierce and combative. One had to have considerable skills. The more people and ships one led, the stronger their management level must be.

If one asked who among the shareholders and employees of the Southeast Asia Company led the most people and ships, that would naturally be Liu Xiang. From the end of the Tianqi reign to the early Chongzhen reign, in just a few short years, he expanded to become the number one rival of Li Kuiqi and Zheng Zhilong on the Guangdong seas, directly controlling three to four hundred sea vessels. This person's skills and abilities were evident. If he could take the field, the Nanyang Company would have twice the result with half the effort, no matter where they started to establish a colony.

However, Xu Yanliang thought with some regret that it was impossible to employ him—the Senate would never agree. Si Kaide had a similar idea back then, to send Liu Xiang and his team down to the South Seas to establish colonies. But this proposal was severely criticized in the Senate.

Liu Xiang and his main trusted aides, a total of fifteen people, were currently living the life of "farm owners" under the "strict surveillance" of the Political Security Bureau in Sanya. No matter how highly Xu Yanliang regarded them, it would be very difficult to employ them.

His gaze could only turn to those "managers" who had been mid-level leaders and had led a few ships. Most of these people stayed in the Southeast Asia Company as captains or heads of trading stations. There were also quite a few who transferred to work and live on shore, satisfied with just being a "shareholder" and receiving dividends.

He roughly looked at the whereabouts of these transferred shareholders; "farming" was the most common—this was not surprising. Whether it was Zheng Zhilong or other sea lords, they all had a great interest in land. In the history of the parallel timeline, they all purchased large amounts of farmland and estates in their hometowns.

Besides the characteristics of value preservation and stable income that land possessed, many of them were originally from peasant or small landlord backgrounds. The attachment to land was engraved in their bones.

In terms of the climate and land conditions in Southeast Asia, there were many areas suitable for agriculture, especially the Mekong Delta, which was developed by Chinese people who went down the South Seas during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

If these people were willing to take the lead in going down to the South Seas, it would be a major benefit for establishing colonies. Liu Xiang and his subordinates mainly came from the Chaoshan region of Guangdong. In the parallel timeline, Chaoshan was a famous "hometown of overseas Chinese" in China. It had long suffered from a shortage of land and a surplus of people, and wave after wave of commoners had gone down the South Seas since the Ming Dynasty. Xu Yanliang felt that as long as the policies were sufficient, these former pirates who had already settled down should be willing to take a gamble.

"The South Seas is the promised land for the Chinese. If given enough land, how could they not go?" Xu Yanliang thought. It was a pity that the Senate didn't have a *Homestead Act*; otherwise, one could claim wasteland just by staking a claim, which would attract a large number of landlords and poor peasants to colonize the South Seas.

"After landing for so many years, we can't even get a basic land law settled. The Senate is done for!" Xu Yanliang started complaining again.

"Old Xu, how is your reading going?" Wang Kai suddenly asked.

"Almost done," Xu Yanliang said. "I just feel that if the issue of land ownership isn't resolved, our colonial action won't have enough appeal. Back then, with just a *Homestead Act*, how many people in the US abandoned everything they had and dragged their families to push into the West to reclaim wasteland? Now we are engaging in colonization; what can we promise the commoners? We can't say, 'You go open up wasteland, but the land still belongs to the Senate'..."

"It's just that the dispute within the Senate is too big," Wang Kai said. "No one wants to touch it."

"But if the land issue isn't clarified, how can we recruit immigrants?"

"Anyway, there are too many poor people who can't get enough to eat. Let's just say vaguely 'go to the South Seas and you'll get land,' and let the Senate worry about the future matters." Wang Kai said, "I have something more headache-inducing here."

What Wang Kai found headache-inducing was the total share capital of the Southeast Asia Company. Although the shareholding of the Southeast Asia Company was clear: the Senate held 51%, and the various pirate groups that surrendered held 49%. But when it came to specific assets, Wang Kai was truly startled.

Out of the policy of "cherishing men from afar," the asset evaluation for the surrendered pirates was preferential. The ships invested as shares were classified into three levels: large, medium, and small. Each level was further divided into three states: good, medium, and poor. There were nine modes in total. Even the lowest valued "small-poor" ship was valued at thirty taels, while the highest grade "large-good" ship was valued as high as one thousand taels.

Of course, very few ships could be listed in the good-large level, but the massive number of small and medium-sized ships resulted in a very considerable figure. From its establishment to the freezing of assets before this restructuring, the Southeast Asia Company had cumulatively received over one thousand two hundred ships of various sizes as equity investment. The total valuation was nearly 530,000 taels—after the currency reform, the calculation unit of stocks changed from the silver "tael" to the silver dragon "yuan"—according to the Southeast Asia Company's stock face value of one tael per share at that time, 530,000 personal shares were issued.

Most of these "share capital" ships were actually eliminated, sold, or dismantled soon after being invested, and the recovered residual value was negligible. The company's real ship assets were actually only those 225 ships.

"Looking at this unassuming broken company, full of junk. It turns out the total share capital exceeds one million!" This time it was Wang Kai's turn to complain.

"Let it be one million. It's all hollow anyway," Zhou Wei said. "What about the shareholders and dividends?"

"There are about a thousand shareholders, with an average holding of about five hundred shares. Liu Xiang is the number one individual shareholder, holding 150,000 shares. Currently, seven hundred shareholders are working in the company."

"That's quite a lot!"

"Most pirates were ordinary commoners; they couldn't just wash their feet and go ashore like this. They still have to make a living at sea," Xu Yanliang said.

"As for dividends, the dividend paid by the Southeast Asia Company to individual shareholders last year was about 19 cents per share. Considering that nearly half of the shareholders hold between 100 and 200 shares, these people's dividends last year were only 2 to 4 yuan. As an investment, the annual return rate is less than 2%, which is really too low. Only major shareholders like Liu Xiang get a decent return."

"It's far worse than his original income."

"So most of them are still working for the Southeast Asia Company," Zhou Wei said. "However, with such investment returns, we will probably have great difficulty raising stocks. What about the company's revenue, operating costs, and profits?"

"I can't understand the revenue and costs either; we need to find a professional accountant to look at them. The profit is clear at a glance. The net profit in 1634 was 27,000 yuan. After deducting the company's retention, it was all used to pay dividends. The dividend for individual shareholders was over ten thousand yuan."

"This net profit is too low. Is it calculated wrong? Such a big company earning less than thirty thousand yuan a year? A ship running sea trade makes tens of thousands of silver in profit in one trip!"

"Net profit can be manipulated," Zhou Wei understood the situation somewhat. "For a company like the Southeast Asia Company, the Planning Committee implies they cannot make the net profit too high."

Wang Kai hesitated for a moment and said, "I feel that the Southeast Asia Company's historical burden is too great; it's not very appropriate to use it to raise stocks."

"I think our first step is to hire an accounting team to clarify all the accounts of the Southeast Asia Company. Figure out the specific operational situation. We also need to communicate with the Planning Committee," Zhou Wei said. "Fixed assets of the Southeast Asia Company are easy to handle, but we need to have a bottom line in our hearts about the company's specific operating costs and working capital situation."

Wang and Xu had no objections.

"Next, let's divide the work. Xu Yanliang, you go to Sanya as an advance party. Say hello to the Mayor of Sanya and look for a suitable place first. It's too late to build houses in a short time. However, the Southeast Asia Company has wharves and trading stations in Sanya. See if we can clear out some houses first to serve as offices and dormitories after the head office moves there."

"How many people are going in the first batch?"

"Most of the office staff at the Southeast Asia Company headquarters have to go now," Zhou Wei said. "Moving so far this time, most families will likely follow. I estimate almost a hundred people. Plus the families, service staff, and guards of the three of us, there will be another ten or twenty."

"I'll check the personnel files first, then talk to the headquarters staff to see how many of them are willing to move their whole families."

"You handle this," Zhou Wei said. "Needless to say, leaving Lingao for Sanya, probably quite a few cadres and staff won't be willing to go. Anyway, it's all voluntary. If cadres and staff don't want to go, write them recommendation letters and let Yang Yun arrange new places for them. Those who are willing to go will be the founding veterans of the Nanyang Company in the future; we definitely won't treat them poorly."

"Give employees incentive shares?"

"We'll discuss this later. No rush," Zhou Wei smiled. "Anyway, you just make promises first; don't say the specific benefits for now. Be cautious."

"This empty big pie is not easy to draw," Xu Yanliang laughed.

"Old Wang, what about you? Go run around the Planning Committee, the Ministry of Technology, the Industrial Sector, and the Agricultural Sector. See what their views and requirements are on the current material supply. Let's see which items have the strongest reaction and the loudest calls, especially those materials that are not in great demand but block key positions in the technology tree. Also, take a turn at the Remote Exploration Team. See if you can get them to organize a few remote explorations of the Southeast Asia region."

"That way, they will cover the personnel and expenses. Brilliant."

Zhou Wei smiled: "Anyone can see through our little tricks. The Exploration Team has long been drooling over the mineral resources in Southeast Asia. We are giving them a formal justification this time. Win-win."

"As for me, I have to find a few financial experts to have a good discussion," Zhou Wei said. "Our overall asset situation is very good now; the Southeast Asia Company is definitely a high-quality asset. It just lacks working capital and the return rate is too low. It needs to be packaged well."
