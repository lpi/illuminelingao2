# Chapter 2316 - Thoughts of Various Parties

"Since it involves her maiden family, it should still be investigated to the end. The losses at Sanhezu were so great; there cannot be no explanation. The matters inside must be investigated clearly." Luo Yangming immediately stated his position.

"This Jiang Rongxian is quite cunning. When we detained him for questioning, he pretended to be apprehensive and fearful, crying bitterly, but didn't confess a single key thing." Zhao Fengtian continued, "If we hadn't found out about the seals today, he probably would have slipped past, and those illicit money and goods would have been theirs for cheap!"

Luo Yangming knew this was Zhao Fengtian "setting the tone" for the Jiang family. However, leadership might "suppress first then praise" or "praise first then suppress," so there was no need to rush to state a position. Thus, he didn't pick up the conversation directly, only saying lukewarmly:
"Merchants seek only profit; it has been so since ancient times."

Zhao Fengtian couldn't see through Luo Yangming's meaning. His plan was to seize this matter to make a big fuss, pushing the main problems of the Wuzhou riot onto Jiang Yougong and Liu Youwang. So the Jiang siblings became important "witnesses."

Needless to say, once the case was handled via this path, the fate of the Jiang siblings needed no asking—Jiang Qiuchan was already deeply involved, and now her big brother was clearly involved too. Although they might not lose their lives, the Jiang family was basically finished.

However, Luo Yangming had shown intention to protect Jiang Qiuchan before this. After all, he was a Hidden Cadre of the Political Security Bureau, and his reports could go straight to Lingao. Although this was business, Chief Xie had too many weak spots here. Although he just stated "investigate to the end," if he defied Xie's wishes too much, a report sent up could at worst sideline Chief Xie, but he, the "Chief Secretary," would have to report to Fu Youdi (Director of the Political Security Bureau, though context suggests maybe head of discipline/audit or something similar, likely Fu Youdi is meant to be a terrifying figure).

He calculated slightly; Luo Yangming mainly protected Jiang Qiuchan, probably because of his wife's entrustment. There shouldn't be too much interest involvement with the Jiang family itself.

"For Liu Youwang's case, it seems we can only start investigating from the Jiang family." Zhao Fengtian said, "Jiang Qiuchan is a married daughter; she probably can't speak much in the family. She and her brother's cases can be handled separately."

Luo Yangming nodded: "You are right."

Zhao Fengtian looked at his watch: "It's getting late. I'll go arrange the public trial rally. This is also a heavy scene."

Ever since Yi Haoran agreed to cooperate, the Australians gave him some "preferential treatment," arranging solitary confinement, treating his torture wounds, and providing relatively superior food.

Sitting idly in the cell, Zhao Fengtian came to see him, holding the Four Treasures of the Study.

"Is the gentleman well?"

"My body is very well now." Yi Haoran sneered. "Many thanks for showing mercy."

"Not at all, not at all." Zhao Fengtian put down the brush, ink, paper, and inkstone on the table. "This is also each serving his master; presumably the gentleman understands."

"Winners becomes kings, losers become bandits; it is a matter of course since ancient times." Yi Haoran was indifferent for a long time, asking: "Where is Cai Lan now?"

"She has already martyred herself." Zhao Fengtian said, "I have arranged to handle her funeral well. Gentleman need not worry."

"Good." Yi Haoran looked up and sighed. Originally he had little affection for Cai Lan and little apology for dragging her into the water, always regarding her as a "person who should die." But hearing she had committed suicide now, guilt arose spontaneously in his heart.

A bitter-fated woman. Although the Australians attacked without the Way and caused her to be displaced, in the end, it was he who personally forced her to die. No matter how many books of sages and men of virtue Yi Haoran had read, he couldn't defy his own conscience.

"As for the whole Luo Yangming family, naturally there is no issue. Even his position in the Aftermath Bureau hasn't been moved. As for Jiang Qiuchan, she was merely used by you and Cai Lan. It was an unintentional fault. After the public trial, some punishment is inevitable, but she won't suffer great sin. In these things, we are trustworthy."

"Many thanks to Mr. Zhao for the trouble." Yi Haoran nodded calmly in thanks. "I wonder how many days this student has left?"

"Three to five days."

"This student's confession hasn't been written yet." Yi Haoran said, "Is there a draft?"

Zhao Fengtian came to see him personally for this matter; the specific effort just now was also for this. Seeing him cooperating very well, he took out the draft he drafted from his pocket.

"You just copy according to the draft."

Yi Haoran unfolded the draft and couldn't help sniffing at it. He originally saw Zhao Fengtian's behavior and conversation were not bad, thinking he was a scholar. Unexpectedly, not only was the calligraphy crooked and rotten, but the text was also very crude.

"This student's confession cannot be written like this." Yi Haoran said slightly proudly, "Wait for me to rewrite it."

Immediately he fetched water to grind ink, picked up the brush, and polished it according to the content of the confession, writing a new one.

"Take it."

Zhao Fengtian took it and looked. Not only was the calligraphy beautiful, but the article was also written wonderfully. He read it through briefly. Except for several metaphors and allusions he couldn't understand, the meaning of the whole piece was clear, not a bit different from the draft he wrote regardless.

"Gentleman indeed has great talent." Zhao Fengtian complimented, putting away both the written confession and the draft. He told Yi Haoran if he had any last words, he might as well write them down. If he wanted to write a testament to his family, the Australians could try to deliver it for him.

"Is it okay for this student to write anything?"

"Of course it's okay," Zhao Fengtian said. "Presumably the gentleman still has many words to say; might as well leave them all. In the future, perhaps someone can understand the gentleman's painstaking efforts."

Zhao Fengtian bid farewell and left, but Yi Haoran's heart surged with thoughts. Although he didn't understand why Zhao Fengtian gave him paper and pen, he indeed had the impulse to write down what he saw, heard, and thought.

Yi Haoran had been in Liaodong for many years and followed Sun Chengzong, so he could be called knowledgeable. However, he rarely had the mind to write about Liaodong affairs. Instead, the few years in Xiong Wencan's staff—especially the days after meeting Jiang Suo—gave him many reflections.

The Australians were just a handful of overseas barbarians of unknown origin. Saying "Descendants of Great Song," anyone with a bit of knowledge would sniff at it. If forced to say they were descendants of Hua Xia, maybe they could fit—after all, they had the appearance of Hua Xia commoners, spoke Chinese that was understandable though strange in pronunciation, and wrote Chinese characters... although their Chinese characters were not even as good as those written by a few Koreans Yi Haoran saw in the capital.

It was just such a small handful of people, relying on a big iron ship, who conquered cities and seized land in just ten years, repeatedly defeating government troops. By now they could even sweep across Liangguang, faintly surpassing the Eastern Barbarians (Manchus) and Roving Bandits to become the number one confidant danger of the Imperial Court.

Ever since he arrived under Governor Xiong, this matter always made him feel incredible. Speaking of the Eastern Barbarians, Old Nu (Nurhaci) was once the Dragon-Tiger General ennobled by the Great Ming, a local tyrant in Jianzhou, and had been sheltered by Li Chengliang for many years. Although he raised the flag to rebel and established a country explicitly, how the Eastern Barbarians rose and succeeded held no mystery for people like Yi Haoran who lived in Liaodong for a long time. Whether Old Nu or the current Huang Taiji, although their systems had unique points, they mostly imitated the Great Ming, copying the gourd.

However, these Kuns coming from the sea were different. From them, Yi Haoran couldn't see half a shadow of the Great Ming—let alone the Great Song.

Although Yi Haoran had strong interest in the Kun thieves, he couldn't find the door for a long time. Whether rumors, Australian goods, or Australian books, none could tell him the definite answer. Only until he met Jiang Suo was the door to knowing the Australians truly opened for him. Although Jiang Suo wasn't literate and stayed in the penal colony for a long time among the Australians, his experiences were more than many naturalized citizens. From his mouth, Yi Haoran obtained many deeds and systems of the Australians, and more or less understood how the Kun thieves governed the people, and what those Fake Kuns who willingly attached to the Kuns thought.

He long had the idea to record his hearings and thoughts about the Kun thieves with a pen. Now, this was probably the last chance.

Thinking of this, he sat down at the table and picked up the pen.

The formal report of the Wuzhou Incident finally arrived in Lingao after the Plague Report.

Because the news of the plague outbreak in Guangzhou was too explosive, it instantly attracted the attention of almost all Senators. So much so that the Wuzhou Incident report was delayed in the Senate for several days before being brought up for discussion.

Probably because the news was too impactful, and the Senators immersed under the huge threat of the plague hadn't recovered yet, the Senate was completely dazed when this matter was raised.

Probably knowing this matter was significant, and even more afraid that expressing opinions rashly would be seized by opponents as handles, the various factions in the Senate actually didn't rush to state their positions, only saying some absolutely correct clichés of "serious concern."

In the end, the only resolution reached by the Senate regarding this matter was to immediately establish a Wuzhou Incident Investigation Team to rush to Wuzhou to investigate the course of events.

However, on the key issue of who would serve as the investigator, all parties had considerable debate. Finally, it was decided that this thorny case would be investigated by Ji Xin—after all, he handled the maid disturbance back then, and all parties were satisfied with his integrity and investigation conclusions.

Because this matter also involved the issue of insiders, the Political Security Bureau sent Chen Baibin, who had served in the internal investigation work of the Hangzhou Station, to assist his work. After all, the handling of the Hangzhou Station back then was also quite subtle. Although Chen Baibin wasn't responsible for drawing the final conclusion, everyone was generally satisfied with his investigation, and he counted as a non-controversial figure.

"Presumably you can also see that the inside story of the Wuzhou Incident is probably not that simple." Xiao Zishan invited Ji Xin to the General Office for "tea and chat" before Ji Xin's departure.

"Indeed not simple, but not complicated to the point of being confusing and blurred." Ji Xin said frankly, "I think, on the contrary, many people view the matter as too complicated."

"Perhaps." Xiao Zishan nodded to express seconding. "Now everyone knows not to express opinions easily. Even Shan Liang and the others have to wait and see the wind direction."

"They think too much, so naturally they are hesitant." Ji Xin smiled slightly. "Actually, this matter is nothing. No matter how everyone considers and weighs it, there is always only one truth."
