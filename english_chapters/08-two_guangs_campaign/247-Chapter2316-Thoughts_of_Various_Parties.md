# Chapter 2316 - Thoughts of Various Parties

"Since it involves her maiden family, we should still investigate thoroughly. The losses at Sanhezu were too great—there must be an accounting. Everything must be investigated clearly." Luo Yangming immediately stated his position.

"This Jiang Rongxian is quite cunning. When we detained him for questioning, he put on a show of apprehension and fear, crying bitterly, yet didn't confess a single crucial detail." Zhao Fengtian continued. "If we hadn't traced the seals today, he probably would have slipped through, and that illicit fortune would have remained in their hands."

Luo Yangming recognized that Zhao Fengtian was "setting the tone" for the Jiang family. However, leadership might "suppress first then praise" or "praise first then suppress," so there was no need to rush to a position. Thus he responded lukewarmly: "Merchants have always sought only profit—that's been true since ancient times."

Zhao Fengtian couldn't read Luo Yangming's intent. His plan was to make a major issue of this, pushing the primary blame for the Wuzhou riot onto Jiang Yougong and Liu Youwang. That made the Jiang siblings important "witnesses."

Needless to say, once the case proceeded along this path, the Jiang siblings' fate required no asking—Jiang Qiuchan was already deeply implicated, and now her elder brother was clearly involved too. Though they might not lose their lives, the Jiang family was essentially finished.

However, Luo Yangming had previously shown intention to protect Jiang Qiuchan. After all, he was a Hidden Cadre of the Political Security Bureau, and his reports could go straight to Lingao. Although this was business, Chief Xie had too many vulnerabilities here. Though Luo Yangming had just stated "investigate to the end," if he defied Xie's wishes too much, a report sent up could at worst sideline Chief Xie—but he, the "Chief Secretary," would have to answer to Fu Youdi.

He calculated briefly. Luo Yangming was mainly protecting Jiang Qiuchan, probably at his wife's request. There shouldn't be much involvement with the Jiang family's interests.

"For Liu Youwang's case, it seems we can only start investigating from the Jiang family." Zhao Fengtian said. "Jiang Qiuchan is a married daughter—she probably has little say in family affairs. Her case and her brother's can be handled separately."

Luo Yangming nodded. "You're right."

Zhao Fengtian glanced at his watch. "It's getting late. I'll go arrange the public trial rally. That's quite an undertaking too."

Ever since Yi Haoran agreed to cooperate, the Australians had granted him some "preferential treatment"—solitary confinement, treatment for his wounds, and relatively superior food.

Sitting idle in his cell, he received a visit from Zhao Fengtian, who carried the Four Treasures of the Study.

"Is the gentleman well?"

"My body is quite well now." Yi Haoran sneered. "Many thanks for showing mercy."

"Not at all." Zhao Fengtian placed the brush, ink, paper, and inkstone on the table. "This is simply each serving his master—presumably the gentleman understands."

"Winners become kings, losers become bandits—it has always been thus." Yi Haoran was silent for a long moment before asking, "Where is Cai Lan now?"

"She has already martyred herself." Zhao Fengtian said. "I've arranged to handle her funeral properly. The gentleman need not worry."

"Good." Yi Haoran looked up and sighed. Originally he had felt little affection for Cai Lan and little remorse for dragging her into this, always regarding her as "someone who should die." But hearing now that she had taken her own life, guilt arose spontaneously in his heart.

A bitter-fated woman. Though the Australians' unprincipled attack had caused her displacement, in the end it was he who had personally driven her to death. No matter how many books of sages and worthies Yi Haoran had read, he couldn't silence his own conscience.

"As for the entire Luo Yangming family, naturally there's no issue. Even his position in the Aftermath Bureau hasn't been touched. As for Jiang Qiuchan—she was merely used by you and Cai Lan. It was an unintentional fault. After the public trial, some punishment is inevitable, but she won't suffer severely. In these matters, we are trustworthy."

"Many thanks for your trouble, Mr. Zhao." Yi Haoran nodded calmly in acknowledgment. "I wonder how many days this student has remaining?"

"Three to five days."

"This student's confession hasn't been written yet." Yi Haoran said. "Is there a draft?"

Zhao Fengtian had come specifically for this purpose; his earlier courtesies had served this end. Seeing Yi Haoran cooperating so readily, he produced the draft from his pocket.

"Simply copy according to the draft."

Yi Haoran unfolded it and couldn't help but sniff disdainfully. From Zhao Fengtian's bearing and conversation, he had assumed the man was a scholar. Unexpectedly, not only was the calligraphy crooked and clumsy, but the prose was crude as well.

"This student's confession cannot be written this way." Yi Haoran said with a hint of pride. "Allow me to rewrite it."

He fetched water to grind ink, picked up the brush, and polished the confession according to its content, producing an entirely new version.

"Take it."

Zhao Fengtian examined it. Not only was the calligraphy beautiful, but the writing was elegant. He read through it briefly. Apart from several metaphors and allusions he couldn't understand, the meaning was entirely clear and didn't differ from his draft in any substance.

"The gentleman indeed possesses great talent." Zhao Fengtian complimented him, putting away both the written confession and the original draft. He told Yi Haoran that if he had any final words, he might as well write them down. If he wished to write a testament to his family, the Australians could attempt to deliver it for him.

"Is this student permitted to write anything?"

"Of course," Zhao Fengtian said. "Presumably the gentleman still has much to say—you might as well leave it all. Perhaps in the future, someone will understand the gentleman's intentions."

After Zhao Fengtian bid farewell and departed, Yi Haoran's thoughts surged. Though he didn't understand why Zhao Fengtian had given him paper and brush, he indeed felt the urge to record what he had seen, heard, and contemplated.

Yi Haoran had spent many years in Liaodong and had followed Sun Chengzong, so he could be called well-informed. Yet he had rarely felt moved to write about Liaodong affairs. Instead, these few years on Xiong Wencan's staff—especially the days after meeting Jiang Suo—had given him much to reflect upon.

The Australians were merely a handful of overseas barbarians of unknown origin. This claim of being "Descendants of the Great Song"—anyone with a modicum of knowledge would scoff at it. If forced to say they were descendants of Hua Xia, perhaps that could fit—after all, they had the appearance of common Hua Xia people, spoke Chinese that was comprehensible despite strange pronunciation, and wrote Chinese characters... though their Chinese characters weren't even as good as those written by a few Koreans Yi Haoran had encountered in the capital.

Yet just such a small handful of people, relying on a great iron ship, had conquered cities and seized land in just ten years, repeatedly defeating government forces. By now they could sweep across Liangguang, faintly surpassing the Eastern Barbarians and Roving Bandits to become the Imperial Court's number one threat.

Ever since arriving under Governor Xiong, this had always seemed incredible to him. Speaking of the Eastern Barbarians, Old Nu had once been the Dragon-Tiger General ennobled by the Great Ming, a local tyrant in Jianzhou, long sheltered by Li Chengliang. Though he had raised the flag of rebellion and explicitly founded a state, how the Eastern Barbarians rose and succeeded held no mystery for someone like Yi Haoran who had lived in Liaodong for so long. Whether Old Nu or the current Huang Taiji, though their systems had unique aspects, they mostly imitated the Great Ming, copying the gourd.

But these Kuns coming from the sea were different. In them, Yi Haoran could not see even half a shadow of the Great Ming—let alone the Great Song.

Though Yi Haoran had strong interest in the Kun thieves, he couldn't find the door for a long time. Whether rumors, Australian goods, or Australian books—none could give him a definitive answer. Only upon meeting Jiang Suo was the door to understanding the Australians truly opened. Though Jiang Suo was illiterate and had spent a long time in the penal colony among the Australians, his experiences exceeded those of many naturalized citizens. From him, Yi Haoran learned many deeds and systems of the Australians, and came to roughly understand how the Kun thieves governed the people, and what those Fake Kuns who willingly attached themselves to the Kuns actually thought.

He had long wished to record with his brush what he had heard and contemplated about the Kun thieves. Now, this was probably his last chance.

Thinking this, he sat at the table and picked up his brush.

The formal report of the Wuzhou Incident finally arrived in Lingao after the Plague Report.

Because news of the plague outbreak in Guangzhou was so explosive, it instantly captured the attention of nearly all Senators. Consequently, the Wuzhou Incident report sat delayed in the Senate for several days before being raised for discussion.

Perhaps because the news was so impactful, and Senators immersed in the enormous threat of the plague hadn't yet recovered, the Senate seemed completely dazed when this matter was brought up.

Perhaps knowing the matter was significant, and fearing that hasty opinions might be seized as ammunition by opponents, the various factions in the Senate actually refrained from rushing to state positions, offering only safe platitudes of "serious concern."

In the end, the only resolution the Senate reached regarding this matter was to immediately establish a Wuzhou Incident Investigation Team to travel to Wuzhou and investigate the sequence of events.

However, on the crucial question of who would serve as investigator, all parties debated considerably. Finally, it was decided that this thorny case would be investigated by Ji Xin—after all, he had handled the maid disturbance back then, and all parties were satisfied with his integrity and conclusions.

Because this matter also involved the insider issue, the Political Security Bureau sent Chen Baibin, who had served in internal investigation work at the Hangzhou Station, to assist. After all, the handling of the Hangzhou Station affair had also been quite delicate. Though Chen Baibin wasn't responsible for drawing the final conclusion, everyone was generally satisfied with his investigation, and he was considered an uncontroversial figure.

"Presumably you can also see that the inside story of the Wuzhou Incident is probably not that simple." Xiao Zishan invited Ji Xin for "tea and a chat" at the General Office before his departure.

"Indeed not simple, but not so complicated as to be unfathomable." Ji Xin said frankly. "I think, on the contrary, many people are viewing the matter as too complicated."

"Perhaps." Xiao Zishan nodded in agreement. "Right now everyone knows not to express opinions easily. Even Shan Liang and the others are waiting to see which way the wind blows."

"They think too much, so naturally they hesitate." Ji Xin smiled slightly. "Actually, this matter is nothing special. No matter how everyone calculates and weighs, there is always only one truth."
