# Chapter 2358: Status of Sanya (Part 2)

"This road is paved quite well." Xu Yanliang looked at the road in front of him and praised it incessantly. The Venus Zero vibrated comfortably under his buttocks.

The road was paved according to the standard of a two-way four-lane road with separate lanes for fast and slow traffic. The road surface was made of cinder, while the sidewalks were paved with stone and bricks, laid out meticulously.

Flame trees were planted on both sides of the road as street trees. After these few years, they had grown lush and green. Cast-iron gas street lamps stood on both sides—this was infrastructure that no other place except Lingao had. Occasionally flashing wooden poles painted with "Lingao Telecom" in white Song typeface indicated that there were also telephones here—also something that no other place except Lingao had.

It could be seen that the investment in Sanya's infrastructure had cost a fortune. The perfection of various infrastructure facilities was not even inferior to Bairen City.

However, such a huge investment obviously didn't play much of a role. On the huge road, only their two rickshaws and more than a dozen bicycles of the guards were traveling. At first glance, one would think that traffic control had been implemented, and it was rare to see one or two rickshaws and carts walking on the road. As for the roadside, although there were some buildings, most were still open space. Many plots were planted with vegetables and various economic crops.

No wonder Tang Menglong said the land here was worthless!

"What's the use of paving the road well!" Tang Menglong said loudly, "I'm almost pitted to death by these things!"

"Why?"

"Let's talk when we get to the City Hall." Tang Menglong probably felt it inconvenient to talk while sitting in the rickshaw and waved his hand.

The convoy went east along the east-west "Senate Avenue," crossed the Xijian Bridge over the Sanya River, and arrived at "Longpo."

The buildings here were denser than in Hexi. Besides various "Australian-style" buildings, there were also some clusters of indigenous buildings mixed in, looking quite incongruous. Besides the artificially planted flame trees on both sides of the road, there were also patches of tamarind trees—some people in Hainan also called them sour plum trees, which were actually the tamarind trees commonly used as sour spices in India and Southeast Asia. This kind of tree was tall and could reach more than 25 meters.

The Sanya Municipal Office was on this avenue. According to the original design, this was to be a five-story blockhouse-style brick and stone building, serving as an administrative institution as well as a fortress, shelter, and warehouse.

However, during the implementation phase, firstly, Wang Luobin felt that the practicality of this blockhouse-style building was too poor, and the appearance was really uncomplimentable, difficult to play the role of "City Hall." Secondly, the General Construction Company had limited reinforced concrete precast slabs. Building such a high building would be too high in terms of both materials and construction costs. Finally, Ji Runzhi changed the plan on-site and built a two-story brick-wood structure small building with a clock tower in the American colonial style. The whole body was painted white with lime water.

According to Ji Runzhi's planning at that time, the entrance of the City Hall was a square serving as a market and gathering place. Two main streets were laid out in a cross shape centered on the square. The main cultural, educational, and administrative institutions of Sanya Special City were built around the square.

Standing beside the fountain cum public water intake in the center of the square at this moment, at first glance, it really had some flavor of a small town in the American South.

However, looking closely, the entire City Hall Square revealed an atmosphere of South American-style lazy decline: although the buildings were exquisite, most of them were somewhat damaged on the exterior. The white walls of the City Hall had turned yellow, and some places simply peeled off, exposing the red bricks and wood inside. There were few pedestrians on the square, scattered sparsely. It was quiet all around.

Xu Yanliang noticed the signs hanging on the buildings around the square; there were quite a few branches of agencies and enterprises set up here! However, the fronts of these buildings were very deserted, obviously with no business.

Tang Menglong invited him into the office on the second floor. The office was both large and exquisite. Pushing open the Regency-style lattice glass window, outside was a balcony overlooking the square.

"How is it? Grand enough, right?" Tang Menglong said, "These were all left by Engineer Wang back then."

"This style, in the 17th century, would be considered the treatment of a first-class colonial governor."

"What a pity! All wasted!" Tang Menglong complained again.

"You can't say that." Xu Yanliang comforted him, "It's nothing more than getting it done in one step."

"It was done in one step at first, but the follow-up maintenance cost is not small." Tang Menglong said as he rang a bell, and a maid with bright eyes and white teeth came in.

"Bring two bottles of kvass, chilled!"

Seeing Xu Yanliang's gaze cruising over the maid, Tang Menglong didn't care at all: "Once it gets dark in this damn place, there's nothing to do, so I have to..."

"I understand this, I understand." Xu Yanliang said hurriedly, "We are all men, I get it."

"It's good that you get it. Quite a few people in the Senate who are full and have nothing to do always make an issue of my many maids and children. Let them be expatriated for a few years; I'm afraid they would have even more maids and children than me!"

Xu Yanliang chuckled a few times and changed the subject: "Old Tang, where do you think is better to set up the headquarters of our Nanyang Company after moving here?"

"Didn't you annex the Southeast Asia Company? The Southeast Asia Company has a large trading station locally. Just in Hexi District."

"Hexi District?"

"Yes, the main urban area of Sanya is Hexi District." Tang Menglong said, "We are here in Hedong District."

He pulled open the curtain on the wall, revealing a map of Sanya.

"This is the full planning map of Sanya Special City made by Ji Runzhi back then. Although construction is in a semi-stagnant state now, the general zoning still follows his design."

Xu Yanliang walked over and scrutinized it, secretly surprised in his heart. He thought to himself that the grand blueprint drawn by the Senate back then was really ambitious!

According to this planning map, the entire Sanya Special City was divided into six districts: Hexi, Hedong, Jinling, Donghai, Yulin, and Tiandu. The specific planning was:

Hexi District: A long and narrow strip of land running north-south on the west bank of the Sanya River and east of the coast. It was the commercial and living center of Sanya City. The Xintiandi Avenue (equivalent to modern Jiefang Road) running through it from north to south was the busiest commercial street in the entire Special Zone;

Hedong District: The main body of this district was the long and narrow island running north-south between the Sanya River and the Linchuan River (Hedong Island). This island was located on the east side of Hexi District and did not directly face the sea, equivalent to the inner city of Sanya City. It was the administrative center and cultural, educational, and health center of the Special Zone; in addition, this district also managed the eastern suburbs east of the Linchun River and west of Dagou Ridge. This area was for parks, flower nurseries, orchards, sports fields, and middle-class villa areas;

Jinling District: Located in the area of Jinjiling in the north of Sanya City, that is, the north side of both Hexi and Hedong districts. The flat land here was relatively open and rich in water resources, and the east side was close to Tiandu, so it could serve as a manufacturing development zone;

The above three districts were directly managed by the Sanya Municipal Government.

Donghai District: Including Dadonghai and Luhuitou, it was a sanitarium and resort area directly under the jurisdiction of the General Office Sanya Management Office, mainly serving Senators;

Yulin District: Located east of Gou Ridge and on both sides of Yulin Port, including the Navy Yulin Base, Army Yulin Fortress, Yulin Port, and storage area, jointly managed by the military and the Port Authority;

Tiandu District: The area around Tiandu Town, a mining and metallurgical heavy industry zone, managed by the Tiandu Mining Bureau.

"Good guy, this is metropolitan-level planning!"

"Who says it isn't," Tang Menglong smiled bitterly. He added: "Speaking of convenience in handling affairs, it's still better to have the headquarters right here at the Municipal Square. The infrastructure here is the best—sewers, gas lamps, tap water... all available. Security forces are also the strongest—a National Army squadron is stationed over there. All entrances to the square are closed at night; safety is absolutely unquestionable."

Xu Yanliang nodded; safety was indeed the first consideration.

"...All agencies and enterprises of the Senate in Sanya have branches here, so it's easy for you to handle any business. Telegraph office, post office, customs... no need to run back and forth. No need to make phone calls either, just talk face to face." Tang Menglong picked up the towel brought by the maid and wiped his face, "You wipe your sweat too! There used to be a Senator Club in the east wing of the City Hall, originally for the leisure of Senators stationed in Sanya. Now it has been changed to the Municipal Agency Club. If you want to talk to someone, you don't need to look for them specifically; just shout in the club at night, and they'll come."

"None of them go home?" Xu Yanliang picked up a towel from his tray and wiped his face. The cold towel had a refreshing fragrance of jasmine, refreshing the heart and spleen. He suddenly felt relaxed.

"Most people don't have wives; they live in dormitories and eat in canteens. What else would they do at night if not coming to the club?" Tang Menglong opened the cork of the kvass and drank a few mouthfuls, "We are too remote here; it's honestly troublesome even to organize blind dates for naturalized citizens. Moreover, after becoming cadres, their horizons are different after all, and they look down on the girls from the farms over in Sanya..."

"It's good enough to have a wife; still looking down on them?"

"You don't understand this," Tang Menglong said, "Ordinary naturalized employees are satisfied if they can have a wife. Those who can come to this club are all cadres and technical personnel of a certain level. Shouldn't they be more cautious when looking for a wife? At least she has to be literate. Besides, some people have no intention of starting a family here at all; they all plan to endure here for a few years to gain some seniority."

"Taking office here can still be called 'enduring'? This is the Senate's Special City; there are only two in total on Hainan Island!"

"Hehe, look at the current appearance of Sanya—dead and lifeless. Old Wang was transferred away again, Senators all ran away one by one, leaving only me. Naturalized citizens are not fools either. Those with ambitions now all want to go to the mainland to make contributions and build careers; those without ideas who want to live their own little lives naturally find Lingao the best—at worst they have to go to Qiongshan. Without plane trees, you can't attract golden phoenixes. You can tell just by looking at these transfer applications." He smiled bitterly.

"This was originally the ends of the earth; Yazhou used to be a place for exiling criminals. It's not easy to make naturalized citizens change their minds in a short while." Xu Yanliang persuaded, "Before Pudong was developed, Shanghai people also said they would rather have a bed in Puxi than a suite in Pudong. When Sanya develops in the future, everyone will naturally be willing to come."
