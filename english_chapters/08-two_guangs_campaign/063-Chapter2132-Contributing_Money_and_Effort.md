# Chapter 2132 - Contributing Money and Effort

Weighing and Commission Firms (*Pingma Hong*) were spontaneously generated in upstream and downstream trade. They did not have official brokerage licenses from the Ministry of Revenue, so they did not possess monopolistic privileges. Competition among the various firms was fierce, necessitating support from traveling merchants known as "water guests." Therefore, during the process of purchasing and selling on behalf of clients, they often needed to advance payments for goods, making it a business that required considerable capital.

Most of the local grain merchants' origins could also be traced back to the Weighing and Commission Firms. After years of intermediary trading, they became very familiar with upstream and downstream clients. Once they accumulated enough capital, they specialized in one line of business. However, most of these grain merchants still maintained their old habits, waiting for "water guests" from Guangxi to bring grain to their doorsteps to stockpile, and then waiting for "water guests" from Guangdong to come and purchase. The only difference was that they earned the price difference instead of a commission.

Before entering the city, Xie Erren had roughly read the booklet "Overview of Wuzhou" compiled by the External Intelligence Bureau. This booklet gave a detailed introduction to Wuzhou's geography, culture, commerce, customs, livelihood, society, and "key figures," giving the cadres taking over the city a rough understanding of their subjects.

Benefiting from this booklet, he was very clear about the backgrounds of the "village worthies" attending the meeting, including their family members, reputations, approximate financial status, and so on. Generally speaking, the "village worthies" of Wuzhou were not much different from those in other places. Apart from a few with extremely good or bad reputations, most belonged to the level where they could be benevolent as long as it didn't harm their own interests: when encountering natural disasters, they would donate money and rice to provide porridge for relief, but this didn't stop them from using the opportunity to annex land and buy servants on a large scale; they would donate coffins for corpses on the road, but also have tenants arrested and beaten in the Yamen to force rent payments.

These bureau directors could not actually count as true "village worthies"—not a single local gentry family had come. Such reserve was excusable, but among the merchants who came, there were quite a few "connections" and "white gloves" of the Wuzhou gentry. For example, although no one from the Wu Zhixiang family, which had deep connections with the Senate, served as a bureau director, Director Da Xinxuan came from their patronage. He was essentially an agent.

"Sitting on the fence!" Xie Erren secretly despised them in his heart, but right now his forces were thin, and he lacked grain and money, so he had to make use of them. Therefore, he had to socialize and exchange pleasantries with them, highly praising the directors for their "public-spiritedness and righteousness" and their "benevolent acts" like setting up porridge sheds and collecting corpses. Then, he changed the subject and said:

"Now Wuzhou has encountered this great calamity, and devastation meets the eye inside and outside the city. The people are suffering from hunger and cold—all these rely on you gentlemen to contribute your efforts."

Everyone looked at each other uneasily, knowing the meaning behind his words. But since Director Xie had both guns and big labels, they had to go along with him. They responded immediately, "These are all things we should do."

"That old fellow Xiong Wencan set a fire when he fled, leaving the city dilapidated and the people with no means of livelihood..." Xie Erren first clarified the issue of responsibility: *It wasn't me who caused this mess requiring you to pay up, it's Xiong Wencan's fault.* "I've thought about it, and there are several urgent matters to be done right now."

As he was speaking, an orderly suddenly reported: The pai-jia heads of the twelve *she* (districts) inside Wuzhou city and the eleven *fang* (wards) outside the city had arrived and were waiting for orders outside.

"Invite them in as well to discuss matters together."

At his order, all the pai-jia heads entered. Most of the pai-jia heads were small businessmen with a touch of the underworld about them. They were familiar with the people on their turf and could deal with the Yamen; they were out-and-out "Earth Lord" local bullies.

The "Earth Lords" knew that no matter which dynasty's emperor was in power, they were indispensable for handling affairs. As for money, they couldn't be counted as big households, so they didn't have the apprehensive expressions of the bureau directors. Upon entering, they knelt and kowtowed in a chaotic manner.

"Everyone get up, my Senate doesn't practice this." Although Xie Erren said this, he actually enjoyed it quite a bit in his heart.

"...The things to be done right now are: first, public security; second, city defense; third, relief. Once these three are done, the rest will be easy."

There was nothing unusual about these three items. The Rehabilitation Bureau had met privately yesterday and come up with an eleven-point rehabilitation plan. These three points were included. It was just that since the Australian Prefect Master said so, everyone echoed in unison: "The Master is right!"

"How many refugees are currently in the city?"

Master Qiao, Deputy Director of the Rehabilitation Bureau, hurriedly took out a folded paper from his sleeve—the Rehabilitation Bureau distributed porridge on the streets and gave out bamboo tallies daily. From these numbers, they could roughly estimate the refugee population.

"Based on the bamboo tallies distributed at various porridge sheds, there are about four thousand odd mouths."

"Has it decreased by a lot?" Xie Erren breathed a sigh of relief when he heard there were only four thousand-plus people, because before entering the city, he had heard Zhu Mingxia say that over ten thousand refugees were rounded up leaving the city at night.

"Master, this is quite a lot." Master Qiao looked miserable: In the Tianqi-Chongzhen years, the entire Cangwu County only had 6,698 households and 27,424 people—and this included a significant portion of the rural population.

Although the Yellow Register numbers were inaccurate, and Wuzhou had a large migrant population due to being a regional commercial center, the population of the city proper plus the suburbs was only thirty to forty thousand. The ratio of over four thousand refugees was already very high.

After Wuzhou was liberated, refugees who left the city and had homes to return to or relatives and friends to rely on had already dispersed one after another. Those remaining were all homeless refugees with empty hands. Just satisfying the food and shelter needs of these people would take a lot of effort.

He glanced at the naturalized Deputy Director who had come to take over Wuzhou with him and asked:

"Is the exact number being tallied?"

"It is being tallied, but the refugees are very scattered, so it will take a few days," the naturalized Deputy Director said. "But the number Master Qiao mentioned is not too far off..."

"Where are the refugees living now?"

"Most are scattered in shelters in various temples within the city. In addition, some have been taken into the drill grounds outside the city. However, there are still quite a few refugees on the streets."

There were two drill grounds outside Wuzhou city: Sanhezui and Ximatan. Both had barracks for the original Ming garrison troops. The drill ground at Ximatan, located on the north bank of the Xun River 2.5 kilometers west of the city, was relatively far from the urban area and was now the station for Zhu Quanxing's 3rd Battalion. The drill ground at Sanhezui was used as a temporary detention center for Ming army prisoners, and Zhu Quanxing had also sheltered some refugees there.

"Whatever temples or other large buildings inside and outside the city can shelter refugees must open their doors wide," Xie Erren emphasized. "Not a single refugee is allowed to sleep on the streets, understood?!"

Refugees living on the streets hindered traffic and posed hygiene and security risks.

"Yes!"

"That's good." Xie Erren nodded and pointed to the secretary next to him. "Bring out the responsibility zone map."

The secretary immediately hung up a map. It was a map of Wuzhou city proper, with neighborhoods inside and outside the city marked clearly. Different sized areas were outlined in different colors. Looking closely, each area was numbered with Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, and a name was written next to it. Upon closer inspection, they were the names of the "village worthies" from the Rehabilitation Bureau.

While everyone was puzzled, Xie Erren explained, "These are your responsibility zones. Since you've come out to work for the people of Wuzhou, naturally you can't just sit and talk in the Rehabilitation Bureau—these are your responsibility zones; each person is responsible for one area. Don't be afraid; I will naturally send cadres to take charge. You and the pai-jia heads in your district just need to cooperate well with the cadre."

Xie Erren chuckled a few times, then continued:

"Each of you must take responsibility for your assigned area and patrol with the pai-jia heads of each *she* and *fang*. If you see refugees sleeping in the open, regardless of whether they are willing or not, they must be registered and sent to various shelters. If there are any omissions discovered by me, I will send them to your homes and ask you to support them like old masters..."

This startled everyone, and they hurriedly expressed that they would do their utmost. The bureau directors looked miserable one by one. *What kind of cadre is this? He's clearly an avatar of Master Xie. We might not see Master Xie once in a few days, but this 'cadre' assigned to the zones is someone we'll have to see all the time.*

Next, Xie Erren announced several rules:

After refugees are taken in, they will be registered and issued "Refugee Certificates." Refugees are not allowed to move around at will and must return to the shelters to spend the night. During the day, they will act collectively in groups of ten based on "Work Dispatch Slips."

The core policy of the relief and rehabilitation work was relief through work.

Starting immediately, relief stations would only provide two meals of thin porridge a day to the old, young, sick, disabled, and pregnant. All refugee men and women over thirteen years old would be organized into labor teams to work. Rations would be issued based on days worked.

Rations were calculated based on work points, implementing a system of more pay for more work. However, each person had to complete a certain basic workload every day in exchange for rations; the excess part could be settled in cash.

If refugees were simply driven to work, there would inevitably be situations of showing up but not putting in effort. Xie Erren didn't have that much manpower for supervision and management. Abusing local clerks and runners would inevitably intensify conflicts. In the end, it was decided to focus on "economic incentives."

Work points had specific workload requirements. This system had been implemented in Lingao for many years. There were mature precedents to query regarding how many work points should be assigned for what kind of work and how much workload, which was very convenient. This was also the confidence behind Xie Erren's dare to implement the work point system.

Xie Erren was actually calculating: *After the city wall is repaired and the ruins cleaned up, road and sewer renovation projects will begin. Anyway, the war has just stopped, and the common people don't dare to make trouble, avoiding a situation like Liu Xiang in Guangzhou, where demolition and construction for half a year led to complaints everywhere.*

Since the refugees contributed their labor, the required money and grain would naturally require the Rehabilitation Bureau to "contribute money if you have money."

"I know that none of you have mountains of gold or silver at home, nor mountains of rice or flour. Although it is to benefit the hometown, it's not building your own house after all, so taking it out still hurts..."

"Dare not, dare not." The village worthies said "dare not" while frowning in pain.

"Therefore, this money and grain will be shared by all the big households in the city—the common people have a thin foundation and can't stand the tossing, so I have to ask you gentlemen to bear more," Xie Erren said.
