# Chapter 2356: The Lonely Tang Menglong

The decline in Sanya's status was also reflected in the choice of mayor here. In the past, Wang Luobin served as the mayor here. after Wang Luobin was transferred back to Lingao to become the Chairman of the Senate, the mayor became Tang Menglong.

Of course, Tang Menglong was the first Senator to leave Lingao to serve as a regional leader—although what he governed was just a coal mine. But he could be considered to have very senior qualifications. However, on the level of the Senate, he had not held any too important positions since leaving the Jiazi Coal Mine. Before taking over as the Mayor of Sanya, his resume was only serving as the County Director of several counties in Hainan. He could be counted as having experience as a local chief executive. But these counties were all small counties with sparse populations and almost no industry or commerce. The so-called County Director didn't have much work to do, nor were there any construction tasks. Naturally, Tang Menglong didn't brush up any political achievements either.

With him serving as the Mayor of Sanya, one could imagine Sanya's actual status in the Senate right now.

"Old Tang himself is probably depressed enough," Xu Yanliang thought to himself. At any rate, with his qualifications, going to Guangdong to muddle through as the mayor of a prefecture city wouldn't be a waste of talent, yet he ended up here guarding the blue sky and sea. He didn't know how long this title of "Special City" could hang on.

However, if it were really a good place, he feared the Nanyang Company wouldn't be able to stay either.

Xu Yanliang somewhat understood the psychology of Zhou and the others. Whether it was Lingao or Guangzhou, they were just one of countless departments and enterprises fighting for resources. There might not be many benefits, but being stared at intently and observed with a magnifying glass was certain.

Coming to Sanya meant somewhat jumping out of the Three Realms and not being in the Five Elements. A vast world where much could be accomplished.

Moreover, Sanya had another advantage, which was infrastructure. Because it was designated as a "Special City" back then, and it was a blank sheet of paper easy to draw on, although the infrastructure condition couldn't compare with Lingao, it was much better than other counties in Hainan.

Furthermore, there were tax preferential policies here. Many merchants who had long-term trade relations with the Senate set up "branch companies" or established separate signboards and branches locally to avoid taxes. Although most of the "branches" here were just an office plus a sign, as long as it was profitable, these shell institutions would turn into "entities."

The key was how to attract these wealthy people to Sanya.

Xu Yanliang was imagining when the guard beside him whispered: "Director Xu, Mayor Tang is here."

Xu Yanliang looked closely and saw a modified Daihatsu boat coming towards the Anleyou Pier from the entrance of Dadonghai Bay, with Tang Menglong's Senator flag fluttering on it.

"He's coming really slowly enough," Xu Yanliang thought. He remembered someone roasting Tang Menglong for being a local chief executive for several years without producing many political achievements, but producing quite a few children. Almost enough to make up a squad.

But having a local leader like him was also good; at least he was relatively easy to cooperate with. if it were really a strong and opinionated one, the Nanyang Company wouldn't have it so easy in Sanya.

With such thoughts, he went down from the tower and waited for the arrival of this Marquis of a Hundred Li at the pier.

Although this Sanya Mayor was getting older, he kept his figure quite well. He stepped down from the small boat quite nimbly and came over waving enthusiastically all the way.

"Director Xu!"

Xu Yanliang hurriedly went up to welcome him, and the two held hands tightly. Those who didn't know would think they were comrades separated for many years; in fact, they were just nodding acquaintances in the Senate. If they hadn't met once during the Senate General Assembly, they would be complete strangers.

For Tang Menglong, since the Tiandu Mine got on track, Sanya had become a corner forgotten by the Senate. Even the Navy Senator stationed in Yulin was transferred away. Except for a few technician Senators who came occasionally due to mechanical problems, a second Senator couldn't be found in the entire Sanya.

Naturalized citizens, of course, there were many here. Among them, there were also quite a few "sensible" and "interesting" ones, but they were residents of this spacetime after all. They knew very little about the Senators' experiences, thoughts, and culture, let alone being able to talk freely and contentedly.

It was fine when handling government affairs usually, but once free, it was truly boring to the point of explosion.

He was tired of seeing the beautiful scenery of Sanya Bay and Dadonghai. He got tired of drinking too much coconut water. As for women, Tang Menglong used to think about having three wives and four concubines, but only after really having three wives and four concubines did he know it wasn't that wonderful. With the continuous increase of maids and children, family conflicts also increased day by day. Thinking of his four maids and seven Calabash Brothers left in Lingao gave him a headache. Therefore, he was now quite "Buddhist" regarding food and sex.

Now that a Senator finally came, and there would be quite a few Senators stationed here next, Tang Menglong's enthusiasm was not surprising.

"I'm so happy that your company chose Sanya as a base," Tang Menglong laughed. "I really dreamed of you guys coming."

"No way, so exaggerated," Xu Yanliang was a bit surprised by his enthusiasm. "This is a Special City; isn't it normal for our company to come here to look for development opportunities?"

"Right now everyone is anxious to go to the mainland; who still remembers there is a Special City here?" Tang Menglong shook his head repeatedly as he spoke, looking lonely. "Come, let me take you on a tour."

Xu Yanliang said yes repeatedly. Although he had learned a lot about the specific situation of Sanya by reading materials, it was better to see it with his own eyes. Besides, it was best not to let down the hospitality of the local landlord.

"Where you are now is the Anleyou Pier—now the dedicated export pier of the Tiandu Mining Bureau." Tang Menglong waved his hands around as he spoke, "To be honest, having such a thing on the shore of Dadonghai is quite a scenery killer."

The small town of Anleyou had long changed beyond recognition; this was the location of the Mining Bureau's pier management department. Rows of red brick houses served as offices and dormitories. Huge silos and various loading and unloading machines lined up along the pier. On the huge stockyard were piles of iron ore and other ores and stones screened from the ore dressing plant.

Like all similar mineral terminals, dust filled the sky here, and black dust and sewage were everywhere. More than a dozen steam engines spared no effort to spew black smoke and white steam. Xu Yanliang had already fully enjoyed the pollution status here on the observation tower.

"It's nothing. When the iron ore in Tiandu is finished, it will naturally turn into a resort area and hotels," Xu Yanliang said. "Speaking of which, this is the lifeline of the steel industry."

"The environment here is too poor; let's cross the sea to Yulin Fortress opposite."

The two immediately boarded the traffic boat and crossed Dadonghai. Xu Yanliang noticed that there were very few ships on the Anleyou Pier, mostly ships loading ore, so he asked about it.

"There are no local products here, and not much business can be done. Where would so many ships come from?" Tang Menglong said, "Iron ore is the biggest export here."

They soon reached Yulin Fortress. Yulin Fortress underwent a large-scale expansion during the development of Sanya and was now a fortress with two defensive walls, 10 bastions, and 12 towers. This fortress was designed according to the scale of deploying a full-strength infantry battalion. It was currently the Army's largest military base in southern Hainan Island.

The battalion commander of the 2nd Infantry Battalion stationed at Yulin Fortress was already welcoming Xu Yanliang at the gate. Originally, when a Senator arrived, the garrison would customarily have some red tape like "inspection" and "review," but Xu Yanliang had notified in advance not to do these. So only the garrison battalion commander and main officers came out to welcome him.

Xu Yanliang accepted their respects, exchanged a few polite words, and asked about the local garrison situation. The commander of the 2nd Infantry Battalion was the garrison commander here.

The garrison battalion commander was transferred here during the "military expansion and reorganization" not long before the Mainland Campaign. This reorganization replaced more than 80% of the veterans in the 2nd Battalion, so it was basically a brand new team now.

"...Now only the Light Infantry Company is composed mostly of veterans; the others are basically recruits. The veterans have all been promoted to sergeants," the battalion commander reported.

"How is the local security situation?"

"There are no large-scale battles, mainly executing counter-insurgency operations."

There were many Li villages distributed in the southern part of Hainan Island, and some villages were very close to Tiandu. Although many villages had been gradually "registered as households and citizens" through means such as missionary work, trade, recruitment, and delivering medicine and medical treatment, small-scale disturbances were not uncommon. Every time there was a disturbance, the 2nd Battalion had to mobilize.

"...In the early years, riots were very common. Even the local Tiandu Mine was attacked multiple times, and lone workers were killed and robbed. The situation has improved a lot in recent years," the battalion commander said. "There have also been several slave riots locally, but the scale was not large, and they were all suppressed."

"That's good." What Xu Yanliang worried about most was naturally the security issue. He suddenly thought of a question, "Are there pirate harassments here?"

"Not in recent years," the battalion commander said. "The Coast Guard is clearer about specific pirate harassments of ships. But pirates have never had landing battles."

"Coast Guard—is there no Navy stationed here?"

"There is a Special Service Boat Squadron stationed at Luhuitou Base. There is also a Coast Guard Patrol Boat Squadron locally. Right now, they are all under the command of the Navy Commander."

Another sign of Sanya's declining status was that the Navy lost interest in this place. Back then, in order to fight for military dominance in Yulin, both the Army and Navy were quite jealous of each other. The Navy also formulated a quite large-scale Yulin Port Naval Construction Plan. Things like Nanyang Fleet, Naval Petty Officer School... They also planned to move the Navy General Hospital here, and Senator Hong once wanted to build a joint logistics sanitarium.

Naturally, these were still just plans now.

Tang Menglong took him around Yulin Fortress. The coastal plain area of Dadonghai was very small. Except for Anleyou City and Yulin Fortress, there were no large settlements. There were only several fishing villages and a few camps used for "purifying" laborers. It could be said to be quite desolate.

"Where is the industry here?" he asked.

"Industry and commerce are all over in Sanya," Tang Menglong said. "There is too little land here to do construction."
