# Chapter 2144 - Reinforcements

For the past ten-plus days, Xie Erren had immersed himself in rehabilitation work. Initially, every challenge seemed insurmountable—grain shortages, funding deficits. Yet unexpectedly, the Rehabilitation Bureau personnel proved genuinely capable. Not only had they successfully raised partial grain supplies and funds, but numerous complicated matters had begun resolving themselves methodically. Though myriad problems persisted, he finally glimpsed dawn breaking through the darkness. His initial assessment of both the Rehabilitation Bureau and retained personnel had shifted measurably. He'd cautioned during orientation that these individuals were "usable but not trustworthy"—yet regarding "use," they'd demonstrated considerable effectiveness. Had he relied solely upon the skeleton crew he'd brought, corpse collection alone would remain incomplete.

Consequently, he'd abandoned his earlier practice of "sprinkling pepper"—deploying cadres everywhere as "supervisors"—instead assigning them more critical responsibilities. Grain procurement, for instance.

Grain procurement naturally didn't entail local acquisition. Wuzhou's reserves remained limited. According to Rehabilitation Bureau assessments, various grain merchants could barely maintain normal sales for another month; beyond that, sustainability evaporated. Xie Erren recognized, however, that wealthy landlords excelled at crying poverty—these projections likely contained at least a half-month buffer of exaggeration.

Even accounting for that buffer, a month and a half's grain supply wouldn't suffice. Several months separated them from autumn harvest, rendering grain taxes irrelevant. As for collecting "reasonable burdens" from rural landlords, his meager troop strength prohibited freely dispatching cadres to the countryside—banditry plagued the hinterlands severely. Beyond landlord willingness to pay, transporting grain back carried enormous risk.

The provisions Logistics had originally allocated for the 1st Brigade had been transferred entirely to local authorities, yet prisoners of war, labor teams, and refugees had consumed substantial stocks. Zhu Quanxing's battalion's grain supply also drew from these reserves. These "public grains" could at best guarantee normal rations for personnel "eating public grain"—diverting portions to market supply proved impossible.

Beneath the specter of "grain shortage," Wuzhou's grain prices crept upward relentlessly. Within days, prices reached his stipulated ceiling. Though none dared violate his price-control decree, every grain shop instituted rationing. Some avoided formal limits but simply opened for an hour or two daily. Citizens, stimulated by panic, rushed to purchase, amplifying tension further. Surface impressions of "stable public sentiment" notwithstanding, underlying panic had never dissipated. Were rural security not so precarious, many possessing farmsteads or countryside relatives would have fled long ago.

Since antiquity, grain formed the foundation of popular stability. Xie Erren understood his price controls treated symptoms rather than causes. Even issuing decrees commanding grain merchants to operate around the clock would prove futile—without ensuring rapid grain supply, Wuzhou would descend into chaos without external attack.

Desperate, Xie Erren conferred with Xu Ke. First, they prepared to institute "rationing by headcount" throughout Wuzhou. Second, they wanted Xu Ke to return to Sanshui and persuade Old Hong to release military rations.

"Rationing by headcount," in modern terminology, constituted "planned supply." During any famine era, such policies emerged. Unable to conjure grain from nothing, Xie Erren could only resort to this measure.

Requesting Xu Ke to retrieve grain naturally leveraged the Senator's substantial influence. Dispatching Zhao Fengtian back would merely result in "routine business as usual" from Sanshui. Xie Erren would inevitably need to file reports to District Mayor Wen of Guangdong Region first, then mobilize grain after approval—too protracted for Xie Erren's timeline. Better for Xu Ke to travel directly to Sanshui and "borrow grain," expediting matters significantly.

"Anything will suffice—even those military rations hard enough to kill. We can't afford pickiness."

"Making a Sanshui trip poses no difficulty for me," Xu Ke agreed readily. He'd been occupied these days interrogating captives and assessing Wuzhou and Guangxi conditions, originally planning to find opportunity returning to Zhaoqing for reporting. Another Sanshui detour mattered little.

"However, implementing headcount-based grain sales presents substantial challenges. The household registration system here remains unestablished. Beyond retained bailiffs, we lack police entirely. What basis exists for issuing grain ration booklets? Registered household population in Wuzhou alone approaches thirty thousand—Great Ming Yellow Register figures inherently lack accuracy, and after such warfare, with refugees fleeing, casualties mounting, outsiders flooding in... population flux has been enormous!"

Xie Erren shook his head. "Valid points, all. Yet constructing a police force doesn't happen overnight. The Qiongya Column sent me only Zheng Ergen as Wuzhou Police Chief. He brought exactly two officers. Presently we can only utilize retained bailiffs from Cangwu County and Wuzhou Prefecture for the temporary security team—this gang of yamen scoundrels can't be trusted for such meticulous work. First, they lack competence. Second, they'll definitely commit fraud, transforming good policy into catastrophe."

Xu Ke reflected silently: *Don't be deceived by Xie Erren's usual indulgence in romantic affairs—his problem assessment runs quite sharp.*

Xie Erren smiled bitterly. "Don't forget I worked as a journalist! What societal ugliness haven't I witnessed? Throughout history, grassroots operations remain identical. Personnel we trained ourselves inspire some reassurance, but handing matters to those clerks and runners would spell disaster—like shepherding sheep with wolves."

"Your plan, then?" Since police were unavailable and he didn't intend employing clerks, Xu Ke experienced some puzzlement.

"National Army!" Xie Erren declared. "The National Army will reach Wuzhou within days. Bei Wei informed me Wuzhou's National Army allocation will be a full battalion—not merely a company."

Given Wuzhou's critical transportation hub position and front-line status, Xie Erren had received battalion-level allocation.

"This battalion can initially serve police functions, at minimum launching police administrative work." Xie Erren had calculated thoroughly: first re-register household rosters, conducting city-wide census.

Xu Ke nodded. Though this diluted National Army version's quality invited skepticism, regardless, they proved more reliable than retained bailiffs. Crucially, Xie Erren currently depended upon retained personnel for numerous functions—prolonged reliance would inevitably breed arrogance and sloth. Once the National Army arrived, regime internal balance would establish itself, prompting retained personnel to exercise self-restraint consciously.

While conversing, the communications officer reported: "The National Army Wuzhou Battalion just arrived. The Battalion Commander is approaching now."

"Admit him immediately!" Xie Erren's spirits surged.

Moments later, a young officer strode in, snapped to attention, saluted crisply, and announced loudly: "Report! National Army Wuzhou Battalion Commander, Guangdong General Corps, Second Lieutenant Zhu Si, reporting for duty!"

Xie Erren observed the newcomer—very young, dark-complexioned, sturdy and capable. Pleasure filled him as he rose welcomingly. "The journey must have been arduous! How was it? Did you encounter difficulties?"

"We traveled by steamship with guns and cannons—none dared provoke us en route. However..."

"However what?" Xu Ke pressed. "No hemming and ha wing—speak plainly if you have something."

"Yes!" Zhu Si snapped to attention again. "Unidentified armed forces operated frequently along both banks. When we stopped for overnight rest, a sneak attack was attempted."

"Indeed." Xu Ke frowned. He'd known of West River bank disturbances, yet hadn't anticipated them affecting river shipping after mere days—this Yao rebellion's development pace proved alarming!

"Were they Yao cave forces?"

"Report: They didn't appear to be." Zhu Si explained. "Our battalion includes former Ming soldiers. According to them, these weren't Yao cave forces, though Yao people did appear in teams encountered multiple times."

"Local village militias and braves, then?"

"They suggested that as well, yet village braves and militias typically defend within their own settlements and strongholds. They rarely assemble in such large concentrations for joint operations."

Xu Ke reflected: *This constitutes novel development!* He realized this "Yao Rebellion" not only arrived with fierce momentum across wide regions but likely assumed new forms due to historical alterations caused by their own intervention. Relying solely on historical records to predict future trends no longer proved reliable.

*I should hasten to Zhaoqing and organize intelligence collected by troops properly.* Reaching this conclusion, he resolved to depart early tomorrow morning.

Xie Erren cared less about these matters—troop conditions concerned him more directly.

"How is the battalion's status?"

"Our battalion comprises three companies plus a directly subordinate platoon, currently at compiled strength of three hundred thirty-two men. Among them, three are ill—all minor ailments."

"Excellent, excellent." Hearing over three hundred had arrived, Xie Erren's confidence swelled.

"Weapons and equipment remain non-ideal. Only one company possesses Nanyang rifles; other companies carry standard spears..."

According to original plans, Cangwu County warranted only one company; recent circumstances prompted emergency expansion to battalion size. Zhu Si explained expanded forces consisted mainly of surrendered Ming troops received throughout Guangzhou Prefecture. Both training and discipline proved unreliable.

"They're all former Ming officers and soldiers... Can we trust them?" Xie Erren harbored some concern. These soldiers hadn't served long, lacking political education and internal vetting—what of loyalty?

Zhu Si appeared untroubled. "Though these former Ming soldiers recently submitted, the Chief needn't worry. First, they all possess traceable roots and families in Guangzhou Prefecture. Second, since submitting, the Senate cleared Pseudo-Ming wage arrears and issues generous military pay. Even fools should recognize which side merits their service. Third, our core company comprises naturalized citizens, all equipped with Nanyang rifles."

Xie Erren retained unease, and Xu Ke shared his reservations. However, to reassure Xie Erren and prevent unnecessary alarm, he murmured, "Old Xie, you needn't worry excessively. When the Manchus crossed the passes, didn't they rely upon Green Standard Army for warfare? Weren't Green Standard forces identical remnants of former Ming officers, soldiers, and peasant armies? The Manchus didn't necessarily conduct political education either. They conquered the realm relying on two simplest principles: 'timely payment' and 'clear rewards and punishments'..."

What Xu Ke didn't articulate was this represented only partial truth—during early Qing, Green Standard generals' defections occurred commonly. Yet Xu Ke believed Green Standard scenarios involved substantial personal command factors, with feudal army soldiers maintaining strong personal dependency on generals. Presently, the National Army incorporated Ming soldiers without officer cores, substantially reducing this danger.
