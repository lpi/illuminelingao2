# Chapter 2144 - Reinforcements

Xie Erren had been busy with rehabilitation work for the past ten days or so. At first, he felt that everything was difficult, lacking grain and money. Unexpectedly, the group of people in the Rehabilitation Bureau were actually capable. Not only did they successfully raise part of the grain and funds, but many complicated matters also began to be handled one by one. Although there were still various problems in front of him, he finally saw a glimmer of dawn. His original view of the Rehabilitation Bureau and the retained personnel also changed somewhat—he had warned them during class that these people were "usable but not trustworthy," but in terms of "use," these people were quite effective. If he relied solely on the few people he brought, he probably wouldn't have even finished cleaning up the corpses by now.

So now he didn't send cadres out everywhere like "sprinkling pepper" to be "supervisors" anymore, but let them handle more important things. For example: raising grain.

Raising grain naturally didn't mean raising grain locally. Wuzhou's grain reserves were limited. According to the Rehabilitation Bureau, the various grain shops could barely maintain normal grain sales for a month; any longer and they couldn't hold on. However, Xie Erren knew that rich landlords were best at crying poor, so there was at least half a month's water (exaggeration) in these words.

Even with the water, a month and a half of grain would be hard to last. It was still several months before the autumn harvest, so grain taxes couldn't be counted on. As for collecting "reasonable burdens" from landlords in the four countrysides, he didn't dare to send cadres to the countryside freely with his small number of troops—the bandit scourge in the four countrysides was severe. Let alone whether the landlords were willing to pay, even if they were willing, there was a huge risk in transporting the grain back.

The grain that Logistics originally transported for the 1st Brigade had all been handed over to the local authorities, but prisoners of war, labor teams, and refugees had consumed a large amount of the stock. The grain supply for Zhu Quanxing's battalion also came from this part of the stock. These "public grains" could at best only guarantee the normal food supply for personnel "eating public grain"; trying to divert a portion to supply the market was impossible.

Under the shadow of "grain shortage," grain prices in Wuzhou city slowly rose. In a few days, the grain price reached the price increase limit he had stipulated. Although no one dared to disobey his grain price limit order, every grain shop began to limit sales. Some shops didn't limit sales but only opened for one or two hours a day. Citizens were stimulated by panic and rushed to buy, which further expanded the tension. Don't look at the citizens' "stable mood" on the surface right now; in reality, panic had always existed. If not for the unstable security in the countryside, many who had farmsteads or relatives in the countryside would have run away long ago.

Since ancient times, grain has been the foundation of people's stability. Xie Erren knew that his price limit order was treating the symptoms but not the root cause. Even if he issued another order commanding grain merchants to operate 24 hours a day, it would be useless—if he couldn't ensure grain supply quickly, Wuzhou would fall into chaos without a fight sooner or later.

In desperation, Xie Erren discussed with Xu Ke. First, they prepared to start "rationing by headcount" in Wuzhou city; second, they wanted to ask Xu Ke to go back to Sanshui to find Old Hong to get some military rations back.

"Rationing by headcount," in the words of the old timeline, was "planned supply." Whenever there was a famine era, this policy would be introduced. Xie Erren couldn't conjure up grain for the time being, so he could only resort to this method.

As for asking Xu Ke to go back to get grain, naturally, it was also because the Senator had a lot of face. If Zhao Fengtian were sent back, Sanshui would just do "business as usual." Xie Erren would inevitably have to file a report to District Mayor Wen of the Guangdong Region first, and then mobilize grain after he approved it. This process was too long for Xie Erren. It was better to ask Xu Ke directly to go to Sanshui to "borrow grain," which would be faster.

"Anything will do; even those military rations hard enough to kill people are fine. We aren't picky."

"No problem for me to make a trip to Sanshui," Xu Ke agreed readily. He had been busy interrogating captives and understanding the situation in Wuzhou and Guangxi these days, and originally planned to find a chance to return to Zhaoqing to report the situation. Making another trip to Sanshui didn't matter.

"However, if you want to sell grain by headcount, this is not a simple job. The household registration system here hasn't been established yet. Apart from the retained bailiffs, there are no police either. What is the basis for issuing grain booklets? The registered household population in Wuzhou city alone is nearly thirty thousand—the figures in the Yellow Registers of the Great Ming are inaccurate to begin with, and after fighting such a battle, those who ran away, those who died, those who ran in from outside... the number of people coming in and out is very large!"

Xie Erren shook his head and said, "Isn't that what you said? However, building a police team doesn't happen overnight. The Qiongya Column only sent me Zheng Ergen as the Wuzhou Police Chief. As for him, he brought a total of two police officers. Now we can only use the retained bailiffs from Cangwu County and Wuzhou Prefecture in the temporary security team first—this bunch of yamen scoundrels, don't count on them to do such detailed work: first, they can't do it; second, they will definitely commit fraud, turning a good thing into a bad thing."

Xu Ke thought to himself, *Don't look at Xie Erren indulging in romantic affairs usually; he sees problems quite clearly.*

Xie Erren smiled bitterly: "Don't forget I worked as a journalist! What ugly things in society haven't I seen?! Since ancient times, the grassroots have always been the same. People we trained ourselves can be somewhat reassuring, but handing it over to those clerks and runners, that would be terrible—like shepherding sheep with wolves."

"You plan to?" Since there were no police and he didn't intend to use clerks, Xu Ke was a bit puzzled.

"National Army!" Xie Erren said, "The National Army will arrive in Wuzhou in these two days. Bei Wei told me that the National Army in Wuzhou will be allocated a battalion—not a company."

Because Wuzhou was located at an important transportation hub and was the front line, Xie Erren received an allocation of a battalion.

"This battalion can be used as police first, at least to get the police administration work started." Xie Erren had already calculated: first re-register the household registration and conduct a city-wide survey.

Xu Ke nodded. Although the quality of this watered-down version of the National Army was suspect, in any case, they were more reliable than the retained bailiffs. The key was that Xie Erren had to rely on retained personnel for many things now—over time, it would inevitably breed arrogance and laziness. Once the National Army arrived, the balance within the regime would be established, and the retained personnel would also restrain themselves knowingly.

While the two were talking, the communicator came to report: "The National Army Wuzhou Battalion has just arrived. The Battalion Commander is already coming over."

"Call him in quickly!" Xie Erren's spirits lifted.

In a short while, a young officer strode in, stood at attention with a snap, saluted, and said loudly: "Report: Commander of the Wuzhou Battalion, Guangdong General Corps of the National Army, National Army Second Lieutenant, Zhu Si reporting to you!"

Xie Erren saw that the comer was very young, with dark skin, a sturdy and capable lad, and was quite happy. He stood up to welcome him: "Hard work on the road! How was it? Was the journey smooth?"

"We took a steamship and had guns and cannons; no one dared to provoke us on the way—it's just..."

"Just what?" Xu Ke asked. "Don't hem and haw, speak if you have something to say."

"Yes!" Zhu Si stood at attention again. "Unidentified armed forces were frequently active on both banks. When we stopped to rest at night, there was an attempted sneak attack incident."

"Oh." Xu Ke frowned. He knew about the disturbances on both banks of the West River, but he didn't expect that in just a few days, it had already begun to affect river shipping—the development speed of this Yao rebellion was too fast!

"Was it Yao cave armed forces?"

"Report: It didn't look like it." Zhu Si said, "There are former Ming soldiers in our battalion. According to them, these people were not Yao cave men and horses, but there were indeed Yao people in the teams encountered several times."

"Were they local village braves and militiamen?"

"They said so too, but village braves and militiamen usually defend within their own villages and stockades; they rarely gather in such large groups to operate together."

Xu Ke thought, *This is a new situation!* He realized that this "Yao Rebellion" not only came fiercely and covered a wide range but also likely created a new form due to the changes in history caused by their own involvement. Relying solely on historical records to judge future trends was no longer reliable.

*I should rush to Zhaoqing as soon as possible and organize the information collected by the troops properly.* Thinking of this, he decided to set off early tomorrow morning.

Xie Erren didn't care about these things; he cared more about the situation of the troops.

"How is the troop situation?"

"Our battalion has a total of three companies and a directly subordinate platoon, currently with a compiled strength of three hundred and thirty-two men. Among them, three are sick—all minor illnesses."

"Good, good." Hearing that more than three hundred people had arrived, Xie Erren's confidence surged.

"The weapon equipment is not ideal. Only one company has Nanyang rifles; other companies all have standard spears..."

According to the original plan, Cangwu County was configured with only one company; now it was temporarily expanded into a battalion. Zhu Si said the expanded troops were mainly composed of surrendered Ming soldiers received in the Guangzhou Prefecture area. Both training and discipline were not very good.

"They are all former Ming officers and soldiers... Can we rest assured?" Xie Erren was a bit worried. These officers and soldiers hadn't been recruited for long, and without political study and internal cleansing, what about loyalty?

Zhu Si looked indifferent. "Although these former Ming officers and soldiers are newly submissive, the Chief need not worry: First, they all have roots and bottoms, with families in Guangzhou Prefecture; second, since they submitted, my Senate has paid off the Puppet Ming's owed pay, and the military pay is issued generously. Even if they are fools, they should know which side to sell their lives to. Third, our core company is composed of naturalized citizens, all equipped with Nanyang rifles."

Xie Erren was still a bit uneasy, and Xu Ke wasn't very assured either. However, to comfort Xie Erren and avoid his unnecessary panic, he whispered, "Old Xie, you don't need to worry either. When the Manchus entered the pass, didn't they rely on the Green Standard Army to fight? Wasn't the Green Standard Army the same remnants of former Ming officers, soldiers, and peasant armies? The Manchus didn't necessarily have any political study either. Didn't they conquer the world relying on the two simplest principles of 'paying on time' and 'clear rewards and punishments'..."

What Xu Ke didn't say was that this was only part of the truth: in the early Qing Dynasty, Green Standard Army generals defecting was a common occurrence—but Xu Ke believed that the personal dominance factor of Green Standard Army generals was relatively large there, and the personal dependency of soldiers on generals in feudal armies was very strong. Now, the National Army incorporated Ming soldiers without an officer core, so this danger was much smaller.
