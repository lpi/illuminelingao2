# Chapter 2142 - Gou Xunli's Return

Yi Haoran looked in the direction of the voice. The speaker was a middle-aged man, appearing to be in his early fifties. Although dressed as a scholar, he had a dark complexion and rough skin, clearly a man who had weathered many storms.

This person was not a relative of Qiuchan's family, but a retainer sent to "present silk" (offer condolences) on behalf of a wealthy distant relative. According to Qiuchan, this relative was a prominent local magnate, but he lived in a mountain stronghold in the countryside year-round. nowadays, with the chaos and war outside, he dared not leave the stronghold easily, deeply afraid of being kidnapped by "Great Heaven's Second" (bandits) as a "fat pig."

"This is..."

"My surname is Xun, my given name is the single character Li." Although the scholar spoke Mandarin, his accent was quite strange, not the Cantonese Mandarin accent common among locals.

Yi Haoran bowed with hands clasped: "Long looked up to, long looked up to."

This was originally just a polite remark, but unexpectedly, a bitter smile instantly appeared on this Xun Li's face.

This kind of expression could only be seen on the faces of people who had experienced the vicissitudes of life and drifted from place to place. Yi Haoran's heart moved; this Xun Li was no ordinary person!

As if knowing what he was thinking, Xun Li suddenly smiled faintly at him.

It was a smile of having seen through someone's secret, but without malice.

Sure enough, Xun Li stepped forward and bowed solemnly: "Long looked up to... Mr. Yi... Hao Ran's great name..."

When he said "Yi," his voice was suppressed extremely low, almost like a whisper, but Yi Haoran heard it clearly himself. He was startled and blurted out: "What?"

"Does Sir want everyone to know?" Xun Li whispered. "Please step aside to speak."

Yi Haoran was confused for a moment. Obviously, this Xun Li knew who he was. However, judging from his expression, he seemed to have no malice. So he quietly paced to the side.

His heart spiraled nervously. He hadn't been in Wuzhou for long and rarely associated with locals. logically speaking, no one should recognize him at all. How could this retainer of a local magnate know him?

Coming to the courtyard, Xun Li whispered: "Is Mr. Yi well?"

Yi Haoran whispered: "Who are you? Why do you know my name?"

Xun Li nodded slightly: "I am but a trivial figure. Mr. Yi is something of a figure in Viceroy Xiong's private staff; naturally, I recognize you."

"So you are also..." Yi Haoran thought and thought, but couldn't recall such a person among the advisors of Xiong Wencan's staff or the civil and military officials in Wuzhou—of course, he himself was not very familiar with these people. Especially when dozens of civil and military officials gathered in Wuzhou city at the peak, and their advisors and retainers numbered at least over a hundred.

"Whether I am or not is not important." Xun Li spoke unhurriedly. "It's just that now the funeral is over, what does Mr. Yi intend to do next?"

"What can I do now? I can only wait for the roads to be slightly safer, leave Wuzhou, and then make plans!" Yi Haoran dared not say he would run to Xiong Wencan, speaking vaguely.

"In my opinion, Viceroy Xiong's place is no longer a viable destination." Xun Li said, "He is now unable to protect even himself. His generals and officials have long been disloyal to him. Even if Mr. Yi has the heart to serve the country, Viceroy Xiong has the will but not the power."

These words were already very blunt. Obviously, the other party took a huge risk daring to say these words to him in Wuzhou city controlled by the Bald Thieves. This was both trust in his loyalty and an indication that the other party understood him very thoroughly. He nodded silently and asked back:

"Presumably, Mr. Xun is here to point out a clear road for this student."

Xun Li looked at him deeply: "A clear road, perhaps I can't say, it might possibly be a dead end—since the Bald Thieves landed in Lingao, everyone who opposed them has hardly escaped death. Is Sir still willing to walk this road?"

"I will walk it." Yi Haoran didn't hesitate.

"Then I will also tell you the truth," Xun Li glanced at the guests who were still drinking tea and chatting in the main hall, and whispered, "I am not some retainer—that retainer gentleman has already been killed by me."

"Huh?!" Yi Haoran was shocked again.

"Sir, listen to me." Xun Li said, "To be honest, I have gathered a hundred greenwood brothers outside the city now—all brave men who dare to fight and kill..."

Seeing Yi Haoran's expression change slightly, he added: "Sir, do not misunderstand. I am not a person of the grass and weeds (bandit). Back then, I was a member of the gentry in Lingao County. When the Bald Thieves landed in Lingao, I fought them to the death but was unfortunately defeated. My elder brother and nephew both died on the battlefield, and none of my family members were spared. Later, I fled to the Viceroy of Liangguang's office. When Commander He campaigned against Lingao, I was an advisor under his command..."

It turned out that this Xun Li was none other than the second brother of the Gou family, Gou Xunli (Gou the Second). Since failing to incite bandits to attack Hongji in Vietnam, Gou Xunli had tossed about locally for several years, and many people died. Although he and "Rotten-Eye Hu" pulled up a sizable team, they were beaten to pieces by the Australians' "bandit suppression," losing nearly eighty percent of their men. The remaining people didn't want to fight to the death with the Australians in Vietnam anymore. Someone who had fallen into banditry in Wuzhou in the past suggested returning to Wuzhou to be bandits—at least Wuzhou was a transportation hub with many merchants, and there were far more things to rob than in northern Vietnam.

Returning to Wuzhou meant a round of infighting: Rotten-Eye Hu was "brave and foremost," Gou Xunli used "divine strategy and wonderful calculation," and the bandits "exerted themselves to follow orders." Working together, they finally established a foothold locally. Gou Xunli was anxious to know news of his son and was unwilling to remain a bandit for the rest of his life, so he bid farewell to Rotten-Eye Hu and sneaked back to Macau to find Li Siya.

However, after tossing about for a few years, not only did they fail to touch a single hair of the Bald Thieves, but their knowledge of the Bald Thieves was also limited. Li Siya had lost interest in him; apart from providing three meals and a bed, she actually cast him aside, ignoring him completely.

Gou the Second stayed in Macau for over a month and only saw Li Siya once. Knowing he was useless to this woman, he had to slip back to Guangzhou dejectedly to see the situation.

In Guangzhou city, not only was Guo Yi's arrogance greater than before, but the Bald Thieves even built some "Great World" directly outside the city. The Guangzhou officialdom not only turned a blind eye to the Bald Thieves but even flattered them. A "Anti-Bald Warrior" like Gou the Second, let alone being reused, became almost like a "God of Plagues" that everyone avoided, becoming a stray dog.

Even worse, Gou Chengxuan, who originally followed Commander He as part of the Returning Home Corps, was missing, his whereabouts completely unknown. The Lai brothers were also completely silent. Gou Xunli relied on the little silver remaining in his hand to inquire about news in various yamens in Guangzhou, but couldn't find any specific news either. He only heard that his son didn't return to Guangzhou after leaving with Commander He, so presumably, he died in Hainan.

He cried bitterly. Sadness aside, he had to make other plans. Unexpectedly, news came out at this moment that Proprietor Guo was offering a reward of one hundred taels of silver for the heads of the Gou father and son. Without a head, an arm or a leg was also worth fifty taels. Rotten-Eye Hu wasn't forgotten either; fifty taels were offered.

Now, all the heroes in Guangzhou city were red-eyed. Naturally, he couldn't stay in Guangzhou—this place had faintly become the world of the Bald Thieves. He couldn't go back to Qiongzhou Prefecture either. He had no choice but to go back to Rotten-Eye Hu to be a bandit.

In the bandit gang, he held the status of "advisor" and was the sworn brother of Rotten-Eye Hu, considered a figure at the "leader" level. He lived a life that could be called "carefree" in the mountain stronghold, but compared to his past life as a "local gentry," it was far worse. Dwelling in the wilderness, living in crude houses, eating rough food, mingling with a group of vulgar mountain villagers all day, even the women snatched for venting were mostly ugly and crude. His family business destroyed, his son's life uncertain, and himself living such a life... The fire of revenge in him did not weaken with age but burned more and more vigorously.

Unexpectedly, this opportunity was delivered right before his eyes!

The bandits learned the news of the Bald Thieves capturing Wuzhou immediately. For bandit gangs, the time when a great army passed through and war raged was an excellent opportunity to get rich—like hyenas eating carrion behind a lion. Taking advantage of the Ming army's collapse and the fall of Wuzhou, the local bandit gangs made quite a fortune. Rotten-Eye Hu and his gang were no exception.

However, while hyenas could benefit from the lion's light when foraging, they couldn't get too close to the lion, especially since this lion was the Bald Thieves! Rotten-Eye Hu's gang had all suffered greatly from the Bald Thieves, so they were very cautious.

The bandits had informants in the city. Gou Xunli more or less knew a bit about the situation after the Bald Thieves entered the city. Driven by the fire of revenge, he paid even more attention to the movements of the Australians in the city. Wuzhou was broken, and the people's hearts in the city were unstable; recently, with the Yao caves rebelling, the main army of the Bald Thieves retreated from Wuzhou in a panic, leaving only a small number of troops in Wuzhou city. Gou the Second knew: the opportunity had come.

The bandits didn't have much passion for loyalty to the monarch and patriotism, but Wuzhou as a spoil of war was a "fat meat" that countless local bandits wouldn't dare to dream of. Moreover, if they really could win a battle in Wuzhou and kill a few True Balds or Fake Balds, the Imperial Court would definitely grant rewards—for bandits, "amnesty" to gain a status and "bring glory to ancestors" was also extremely attractive. Therefore, Gou Xunli didn't spend much effort to persuade Rotten-Eye Hu and the entire gang.

But their gang only had a hundred or so people. Rotten-Eye Hu and the others had fought with the Australians and knew their power well. Even if there were only a hundred or so "Fake Balds" in the city, they would definitely not be opponents in a pitched battle; as for roping in other bandit gangs to work together, Rotten-Eye Hu had tasted the bitterness of this kind of "joint venture" in Vietnam. It was okay to pull them in to boost momentum and attract the Bald Thieves' firepower, but to make them exert deadly effort was impossible.

"We need to borrow strength, but the various starts on the mountain are unreliable. We still have to rely on the Imperial Court!" Gou Xunli thought again and again and said to Rotten-Eye Hu.

"You mean, go find Xiong Wencan?" Rotten-Eye Hu blinked his scarred eyelids and asked.

"We are weak and isolated; going directly to Xiong Wencan won't work. We might not even see him." Gou Xunli said, "There must be someone to recommend us!"
