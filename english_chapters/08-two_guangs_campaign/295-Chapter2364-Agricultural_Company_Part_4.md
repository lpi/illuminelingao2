# Chapter 2364: Agricultural Company (Part 4)

"The current scale is enough." Hu Wumei nodded and said, "I have opened up six thousand mu of land now. With machines to help planting, about fifty or sixty male laborers are enough. The remaining people are sufficient for the plantation and factories. When busy, children and the elderly can also help."

"What if you don't use slaves?" Xu Yanliang asked, "Is there any difficulty?"

"Difficulty... well, not really... difficulty..." Hu Wumei was caught off guard by Senator Xu suddenly asking such a question. His mind reacted quickly, knowing from this sentence that Senator Xu did not approve of using slaves.

Unfortunately, this question came too fast. Although he promptly figured out the other party's thoughts, he hesitated in his speech. Xu Yanliang naturally detected it.

Obviously, this Farm Owner Hu was not resistant to using slaves. Or rather, because the benefits obtained from using slaves far exceeded the costs he paid.

He did not continue to discuss this issue in depth, but changed the topic: "You have six thousand mu of land in your farm now; do you want to open up more land?"

"Of course, the more land the better." Hu Wumei laughed, looking full of ambition. He knew Senators liked this attitude, "But having too much land is also inconvenient. Workers have to walk a long way to get to work and back. Wasting time."

"Why not set up a few more farms? Isn't it inconvenient for your workers to be concentrated here now?"

"I did; I set up a new farm over at the coconut plantation." Hu Wumei said, "With too much land, foremen must be set up, and this person is hard to find..."

Xu Yanliang nodded. He had no intention of expressing too many opinions on the production and management here. Originally, his work focus was not on agriculture either. Coming to Hu Wumei's place was nothing more than to understand the agricultural production situation in Sanya and to learn some lessons for future agricultural colonies.

"There is another question," Hu Wumei hesitated, "You, Sir, came from Lingao; do you know what the Senate's regulations on land are nowadays?"

"What regulations?" Xu Yanliang didn't react for a moment.

"It's just..." Hu Wumei was a bit nervous because he more or less knew that this land issue had always been a core issue within the Senate—although he never understood why such a simple matter of buying and selling land could not be settled by the Senate for so many years.

"This lowly one is just asking casually..." He stammered a bit, "Actually, it's not just this lowly one who has this question; people in Sanya and Lingao all want to know."

"Tell me about it. If I know, as long as there is no violation, I will naturally tell you."

Seeing him express his stance, Hu Wumei summoned up his courage and asked: "What exactly does the Senate mean regarding land deeds? This lowly one has been farming here for several years, yet still has no land deed. I asked several Senators, but none gave an explanation. Farming so muddily, my heart is not at ease."

Xu Yanliang's heart thumped. He thought that the issue of land ownership had to be faced after all. The Senate had been vaguely skirting around it for so many years, never issuing a clear plan, so that various departments could only implement some temporary measures regarding a series of issues such as land property rights and usage rights. Playing word games.

For those common people with small families, having a house to live in, dozens of mu of land to cultivate, light taxes, and a full stomach was already the best luck. Naturally, they wouldn't investigate who the property owner of the house they lived in and the land they cultivated was—anyway, even they themselves were "Senate's people."

But for those outside "investors" or "emerging classes" like Hu Wumei, their views on property rights were completely different. Who the land belonged to and whether they could dispose of it were the issues they were most concerned about.

Whether land was state-owned or private was an old issue argued in the Senate for many years. The only point all parties could agree on was "those with constant property have constant perseverance (stability)." The problem was how to define this "constant property," how to ensure the Senate's control over land, and ensure that the poor could also obtain land relatively fairly.

Although the future of the Senate was to build the country on industry and commerce, and the importance of land as a means of production would drop significantly, as the most basic means of human production and life, its scarcity and irreplaceability made it inevitably the focus of various social contradictions. This also made the Senate particularly cautious on this issue. For many years, "only discussing, not voting" was also to prevent major internal rifts caused by this issue. This was also one reason why many Senators were unwilling to mention this matter.

He could now act like other Senators, giving a vague laugh and saying some specious official jargon to muddle through. But Xu Yanliang thought for a moment and felt it was better to speak more thoroughly.

Xu Yanliang thought for a moment and asked: "What is the nature of the land you are cultivating now? Didn't the Senate give you written documents or certificates?"

"Yes, yes, only I can't understand the words on them." Hu Wumei laughed bitterly, "To be honest with you, Sir, if I could understand it, I would be willing to reclaim more land. But being so muddled, I dare not do it randomly..."

"Bring all your certificates here, and tell me about this land matter." Xu Yanliang said, "Actually, I don't understand it too well myself, but since you reported it to me, I will definitely submit this matter to the Senate as soon as possible."

In these years, this was the first time such a clear answer regarding land was given. Hu Wumei instantly got spirited and stood up: "Sir, please wait a moment; I'll go get the documents right away!"

Taking advantage of Hu Wumei's departure, Xu Yanliang asked softly: "Is there any exaggeration in what this person said?"

Yuan Fei smiled: "Don't listen to him talk nonsense. His slaves are not fifty or sixty, but at least two or three hundred, all in the coconut plantation. Coconuts alone can earn him a lot of money a year—if he used workers, how much more would the wages be! He saw that you, Sir, didn't like using slaves, so he specially understated it."

Xu Yanliang nodded; this was about what he thought. The production efficiency of slaves under the plantation economy was not low. It was no accident that those cotton and tropical crop plantations in the Americas were keen on using slaves, just as the demand for grain in Western Europe starting from the 16th century caused a large-scale rebound of serfdom in Eastern Europe.

"How much is a slave now?"

"Prices fluctuate. Generally, a young and strong male slave costs more than ten yuan. Females also cost seven or eight yuan. Those with good physique are more expensive."

"Are there many people using slaves here?"

"Many. Workers who don't cost money and only eat rice, who wouldn't want to use a few? But small households can't afford to buy and dare not buy; only big wealthy households buy them." Yuan Fei said, "Under the rule of the Ming Kingdom in the past, weren't there also people buying Nu Ke (bondservants) to farm?"

"What about the land matter he mentioned?"

"That's real. What old Hu cares about most is his land. This old bloke—insatiable greed!" Yuan Fei said without scruples.

Hu Wumei returned in a short while, took a tin box, carefully opened the padlock on it, took out a portfolio from inside, and carefully pulled out a few sheets of paper.

"This is the Mouth-share Field distributed to me and my family when I came to Sanya back then. At that time, there were fifteen people in my family registration, a total of 450 standard mu. This portion was additionally rewarded by the Senate, a total of 3,000 standard mu. All wasteland. And these..." He unfolded these vouchers one by one and put them on the table, pressing them down with teacups, "This is my Real Estate Certificate, this is the Reclamation Ticket given when I cleared wasteland later..."

Xu Yanliang picked them up one by one to watch. He saw that the styles and patterns of these "licenses" varied. Not only were the names of the land ownership nature different, but even the issuing departments were different.

The "Mouth-share Field" was stamped with the seal of the Civil Affairs People's Commission. There were no words about the nature of the land; it was just called "Mouth-share Field," only noting that it was 30 standard mu per person according to the registered population, regardless of gender or age.

As for the "Senate Reward," the certificate was actually an "Agricultural Production Land Tax Payment Certificate" issued by the General Tax Bureau. Xu Yanliang didn't know whether to laugh or cry; what kind of land certificate was this! It seemed the people in the Political Affairs Yuan racked their brains to avoid the land ownership issue.

The "Reclamation Ticket" was even stranger; the stamping department was actually the "Sanya Special City Municipal Government." Probably the person who came up with this system back then also felt it was not quite appropriate, so later seals of the Agricultural People's Commission and the General Tax Bureau were added.

Judging from these vouchers alone, they conform to many characteristics of real estate certificates; for example, they all have attached drawings, clear land boundaries, and even latitude and longitude noted. The problem is that in a legal sense, these have not a dime to do with land title deeds. Only a few Real Estate Certificates were standard, at least noting the "Real Estate Owner." Of course, for the land occupied by the real estate, only the area was recorded, without specific nature.

No wonder this Hu Wumei was muttering. To be honest, with the Senate doing things like this, gaining the trust of naturalized citizens was probably only because they were in troubled times and had no other choices.

Hu Wumei saw him sometimes surprised, sometimes sarcastic, and sometimes showing an incredulous expression, and couldn't help but feel apprehensive. He had studied these land documents countless times himself and always felt "something was wrong." Seeing Senator Xu silent for a long time, he emboldened himself to ask: "Chief, what do you think..."

Xu Yanliang shook his head: "This is also the first time I've seen these certificates. Truly an eye-opener!"

"Then these vouchers..."

"Since they are all stamped with big seals and issued by the Senate, they are naturally valid; you don't need to worry too much." Xu Yanliang hurriedly gave him a reassurance pill, "You don't need to think too much either."

"Yes, yes, thank you, Chief Xu." These words made Hu Wumei slightly relieved, but these messy documents were still a sore point for him. After all, these were not the clearly written land deeds like in the Ming Kingdom!

Xu Yanliang knew from the expression on his face that his guarantee was not convincing. To be honest, even he himself felt these words had no persuasive power.
