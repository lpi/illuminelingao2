# Chapter 2303 - Pursuit Battle

Luo Yangming quickly divided the force into two groups. Wen Tietou would take half the men to pursue along the base of the wall while Luo Yangming led the other half up onto the wall itself to search toward the North Gate. They would communicate between top and bottom using light signals. Since the enemy's ultimate goal was clear—they had to climb over the wall eventually—it made more sense to put half the men on top immediately rather than have everyone groping around at ground level. Luo Yangming judged that the enemy certainly had insiders on the wall, and where there were insiders, there would be traces.

Just as Wen Tietou was about to set off, Luo Yangming pulled him aside and whispered, "The person we're rescuing tonight isn't just some naturalized cadre. It's a Senator..."

"What?!" Wen Tietou couldn't help but shout, then quickly lowered his voice when he saw Luo Yangming's expression. "You mean... that... Chief Xie?!"

"That's him."

"How is that possible..."

"Possible or not, the man's been taken." Luo Yangming's tone was grave. "Just remember—once you encounter the enemy, you must risk everything to preserve Elder Xie's life. If you save him, it's wealth and glory reaching the sky."

"I understand!" Wen Tietou nodded. "Rest assured!"

Song Ming and Jiang Suo dragged Xie Erren along in a mad dash, following exactly the route Wen Tietou had predicted—along the base of the city wall. According to intelligence gathered beforehand, the Australians could only manage scattered patrols along the wall at night and couldn't closely monitor every section. The area at the foot of the wall was mostly desolate, dotted with abandoned graves and charity cemeteries. There were few people about, minimizing the risk of detection.

Xie Erren knew he was now a valuable prize, and the realization filled him with bitter regret. But there was nothing he could do. He was dragged through the darkness, stumbling and staggering, occasionally receiving a fierce blow from a stick to urge him faster. He couldn't even cry out in pain.

Xie Erren was, after all, a man of Senatorial dignity who had spent years doing desk work. He had grown soft, living like a prince. How could he endure such brutal handling? His mouth was stuffed, and gradually he found himself short of breath, dizzy. Even the kicks and beatings couldn't make him walk any faster.

Song Ming grew impatient with the slow pace. If they delayed too long in the city, the thieves would react and escape would become impossible. At his command, a burly personal guard hoisted Xie Erren onto his back and walked briskly onward.

Though drums pounded urgently throughout the city, they had encountered only scattered patrols and hastily added security personnel along the way. Because the attack had struck so suddenly, most of the temporary guards were cut down before they could react.

The group reached the north wall without further incident. The gate tower of the Great Cloud Gate blazed with lights—reinforcements had clearly been sent there. But no firelight was visible on the walls flanking the tower, only the lanterns and torches of patrols, which were somewhat denser than when they had first entered.

Soon the element of surprise would vanish completely, and breaking out over the wall would become nearly impossible. Both Song Ming and Jiang Suo breathed silent thanks when they spotted the still-unrestored gate tower of the Great Cloud Gate.

Wen Tietou pursued fiercely with a torch and soon discovered traces left by the attackers: a three-eyed gun. The firearm hadn't been discharged—the powder and shot were still properly loaded. There was only one reason for it to be abandoned by the roadside: it was too heavy, and the enemy was desperate to flee.

This realization filled Wen Tietou with renewed confidence. He immediately called to his men: "The enemy is just ahead! After them!"

The porters howled and gave chase. Wen Tietou added: "Bring that gun along! We'll give them a taste of it when the time comes!"

The trail left by the enemy grew more obvious: discarded weapons and equipment, and the corpses of slain patrol and security personnel. Wen Tietou ordered everyone to equip themselves with the scavenged weapons as they followed closely behind. When the lights of the Great Cloud Gate tower came clearly into view ahead, Wen Tietou felt a stab of anxiety. Fighting and killing were nothing new to him, but this time was different. These opponents had dared to attack Wuzhou at night—they were clearly desperate men, brave to the point of madness. His own brothers might not have that kind of courage. The thought made him hesitate.

Looking up at the city wall, he saw that the firelight from his brother-in-law's team had already pulled ahead. He remembered what Luo Yangming had told him privately: they were rescuing a Senator. If the rescue succeeded, needless to say, not only his brother-in-law but Wen Tietou himself would be set for life! Wealth and glory are found in danger. If he turned soft now, he would remain a dock foreman until the day he died.

That thought hardened his resolve. "The enemy isn't far ahead!" he shouted. "Everyone stay close!"

The road atop the city wall was far easier to traverse than the path below. They ran openly with torches and weapons. The moment they climbed onto the wall, they attracted the attention of sentries. Fortunately, the Detective Team armbands and Luo Yangming's pass did their work. Though there were brief delays, they didn't waste too much time.

Because the journey was smooth, Luo Yangming's team reached the Great Cloud Gate several minutes before Wen Tietou—nearly simultaneously with Song Ming's group arriving at the base of the wall below.

As soon as he arrived, Luo Yangming negotiated with the Volte Army sergeant guarding the gate, reporting the situation and urging an immediate search deployment on both flanks of the Great Cloud Gate.

But the sergeant regarded this sudden "Detective Team" appearing from along the city wall with suspicion. Upon seeing them, he ordered everyone to drop their weapons and kneel on the ground to await disposition. Fortunately, Luo Yangming often showed his face in public, and the sergeant recognized him—otherwise they might all have been arrested on the spot.

Luo Yangming spent several precious minutes explaining the situation, but skepticism never left the sergeant's eyes. No matter how Luo Yangming argued, the man refused to let them deploy a search, agreeing only to order the gate guards to pay closer attention to movements along the wall.

Luo Yangming watched the torches of the two groups the sergeant had dispatched move slowly along the wall. Sweat poured from his forehead in frustration. But he couldn't push any harder—if he said too much and triggered a confrontation, the porters he had brought would die for nothing.

Wang Ken and Mai Dang had been waiting anxiously on the wall. The cannons, gunshots, and commotion inside and outside the city told them something major had happened—clearly the work of the government troops they had helped enter. According to the prior agreement, these men would still need to exit through their sentry post.

Ever since the men in black had entered the city, the two brothers had been living in terror, afraid of discovery at any moment. The rope ladder dangling beneath their feet was ironclad proof of their collusion with the enemy. Even if it didn't mean "execution on the spot," they couldn't escape severe torture and eventual death.

Though it was dark and the rope ladder was hard to spot, if someone approached with a torch to patrol, it would be exposed immediately.

On one side was the government's promise of promotion and wealth; on the other was the possibility of losing their lives at any moment. The two brothers were out of their minds, pacing in circles on the wall.

Just as they were on the verge of panic, they suddenly heard three frog croaks from the base of the wall, followed by another three. Their spirits soared—they had finally come!

They immediately responded with two croaks. Moments later, a man in black climbed up the rope ladder. Wang Ken said, "You finally made it!"

The man interrupted him and whispered, "Any movement?"

"The commotion has been enormous—"

"I mean on the wall!"

"The alert drum was beaten over at the gate tower. The lights have increased a lot."

"Has anyone come to patrol?"

"That... no..."

"Good." The man waved his hand. More figures climbed up the rope ladder one after another. Then someone ascended carrying another person on his back. Wang Ken and Mai Dang watched with pounding hearts, feeling as if they were dreaming.

Luo Yangming talked until his mouth was parched and his lips cracked, but he couldn't get through to the sergeant. The man did, however, decide that strengthening wall patrols couldn't hurt, so he sent two Detective Team groups to patrol along the east and west sections of the wall.

Watching the torches of these two groups move slowly along the wall, Luo Yangming burned with frustration. But he couldn't argue further—if he said too much and provoked a conflict, the porters he had brought would die for nothing.

Jiang Suo breathed a quiet sigh of relief as the True Kun was hauled up onto the wall. The mission was half done. Just as he was urging the remaining men to climb faster, firelight suddenly flashed behind them at the base of the wall, accompanied by the sound of rapid footsteps.

Pursuers had arrived! Jiang Suo's heart sank. He drew his saber and whispered, "Ten men stay with me to hold the rear. We must ensure General Song gets the thief away!"

The men Song Ming had brought into the city were all his personal guards and family retainers—men who did not fear death. At his command, they immediately gathered around him. Some nocked arrows, others readied firearms, all prepared to engage in slaughter.

Wen Tietou had no idea an ambush awaited him. He charged forward through the darkness. When the lights of the Great Cloud Gate tower came clearly into view, firelight suddenly blazed ahead. He cried out a warning and threw himself to the ground in a tiger leap. An instant later, a volley of firearms roared.

The volley of muskets and arrows cut down seven or eight of Wen Tietou's men instantly. The air filled with wailing and screaming. Some turned and ran. Wen Tietou's ears rang. He felt something warm flowing down his head; touching it, his fingers came away black with blood.

He looked around. His brothers lay scattered on the ground—some crying in pain, some silent. But instead of breaking him, the sight ignited his fury. He bellowed, "Pu gai! F*cking get them!" Lifting his saber, he scrambled up and charged forward. The porters, who had begun to waver, were men who had seen their share of violence. Watching their leader charge, they shouted war cries and surged after him. Jiang Suo gave a mighty roar and led his men to meet them. Both sides crashed together in brutal melee.

Luo Yangming paced like an ant on a hot pan. The crack of bird guns made him whirl around. Looking back, he saw the flash of gunfire about a li away, right at the base of the wall. It had to be Wen Tietou's men engaging the infiltrators.

He turned urgently to the sergeant. "Look! There's action over there!"

The sergeant was startled as well. He squinted into the darkness. Though he couldn't see clearly, there were sentries at that position. He immediately ordered men to signal with lanterns to inquire—but there was no response.
