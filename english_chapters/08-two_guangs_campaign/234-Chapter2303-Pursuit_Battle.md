# Chapter 2303 - Pursuit Battle

Luo Yangming immediately made assignments, splitting the force into two groups. Wen Tietou took half the men to pursue along the base of the wall, while he took the other half up onto the city wall to search towards the North Gate. They used light signals to communicate between the top and bottom of the wall. Since the enemy's ultimate goal was clear—they had to climb over the wall eventually—it was better to send half the men up the wall first rather than have a large group running along the base. Luo Yangming judged that the enemy definitely had insiders on the wall; and since there were insiders, there must be traces.

Just as Wen Tietou was about to set off, Luo Yangming pulled him aside and whispered, "The one we're saving this time isn't some naturalized cadre, it's a Senator..."

"What?!" This scared Wen Tietou quite a bit. He shouted involuntarily, but seeing Luo Yangming's look, he hurriedly lowered his voice. "You mean... that... Chief Xie?!"

"That's him."

"How is that possible..."

"Possible or not, the man has been caught." Luo Yangming's tone was grave. "You just need to remember, once you encounter the enemy, you must risk your life to preserve Elder Xie's life! If you save him, it's wealth and honor reaching the sky!"

"I understand!" Wen Tietou nodded. "Rest assured!"

Song Ming and Jiang Suo dragged Xie Erren along in a wild dash. Their route was exactly as Wen Tietou had guessed: along the base of the city wall. According to the intelligence gathered beforehand, the Australians could only send people to patrol along the city wall at night and could not closely monitor every section. The area at the foot of the wall was mostly desolate, containing even abandoned graves and charity cemeteries; there were very few people, making it unlikely to attract attention.

Xie Erren, knowing that he would be a valuable commodity after being captured, was filled with annoyance and regret. However, he couldn't help himself now. He was dragged along in the dark, stumbling and staggering, occasionally receiving a fierce blow from a stick to urge him to walk faster. He couldn't even cry out in pain.

Xie Erren was, after all, of Senatorial dignity and had long done desk work; he could be counted as living like a prince. How could he endure such rough dragging? Moreover, his mouth was stuffed, and gradually he felt short of breath and dizzy. Even with the kicking and beating, he couldn't walk anymore.

Song Ming felt he was walking too slowly and feared that if they delayed too long in the city, the thieves would react and make escape difficult. With a command, a robust personal guard carried Xie Erren on his back and walked briskly.

Although the drumbeats in the city were rapid, they had only encountered scattered patrols and additional security personnel along the way. Because the incident happened suddenly, most of the temporarily added personnel were cut down before they could react.

The group successfully reached the north wall. The gate tower of the Great Cloud Gate was ablaze with lights. It looked like manpower had been increased there too, but no more firelight was seen on the walls flanking the gate tower; only the lanterns and torches of patrols were much denser than when they had entered.

Before long, the element of surprise from the raid would vanish, and breaking out over the wall would become difficult upon difficult. Both Song Ming and Jiang Suo secretly cried "a fluke" the moment they saw the unrestored gate tower of the Great Cloud Gate!

Wen Tietou chased fiercely with a torch and soon discovered traces left by the attackers: a three-eyed gun. This firearm had not been fired; the powder and lead shot were loaded properly. There was only one possibility for it being abandoned by the roadside: it was too heavy, and the enemy was eager to flee.

Thinking of this, Wen Tietou's confidence surged. He immediately instructed his subordinates: "The enemy is just ahead. Chase them quickly!"

The porters howled and chased along the way. Wen Tietou said:

"Take this fire gun along too. We'll give them a taste of it when the time comes!"

The traces left by the enemy along the way became more obvious: abandoned weapons and equipment, and the corpses of killed patrol and security personnel. Wen Tietou instructed everyone to equip themselves with the scavenged weapons and followed closely. Seeing the lights of the Great Cloud Gate tower clearly visible ahead, Wen Tietou felt nervous. Although fighting and killing was a common meal for him, this time was different from the past. The opponents dared to attack Wuzhou at night; needless to say, they were brave desperados. His own brothers might not have such courage. Thinking of this, he felt a bit timid.

Looking up at the city wall, the firelight of his "brother-in-law's" team had already pulled ahead. He remembered what Luo Yangming had told him privately: this time they were rescuing a Senator. If the rescue was successful, it went without saying that not only his brother-in-law but he himself would have wealth and honor settled for the rest of his life! Wealth and honor are sought in danger. If he turned soft now, he would just remain a foreman for the rest of his life!

Thinking of this, his courage steepened, and he shouted, "The enemy is not far ahead. Everyone stick close!"

The road on the city wall was much easier to walk on than the one at the base. They ran wildly with open torches and weapons. As soon as they got on the wall, they attracted the attention of sentries. Fortunately, the Detective Team armbands and Luo Yangming's pass worked. Although there was a slight delay, it didn't waste too much time.

Because the journey was smooth, Luo Yangming's team arrived at the Great Cloud Gate several minutes earlier than Wen Tietou—almost simultaneously with Song Ming's team arriving below the wall.

As soon as he arrived at the Great Cloud Gate, he immediately negotiated with the Volte Army sergeant guarding the gate, reporting the relevant situation and suggesting an immediate search be deployed on both sides of the Great Cloud Gate.

However, the Volte Army sergeant held a skeptical attitude toward this sudden "Detective Team" coming from the city wall. Upon seeing them, he ordered everyone to drop their weapons and kneel on the ground to await disposition. Fortunately, Luo Yangming often showed his face in public, and the sergeant recognized him, so he didn't arrest them all directly.

Luo Yangming spent several minutes explaining the current situation, but the sergeant's eyes constantly revealed suspicion. No matter how Luo Yangming explained, he was unwilling to let them deploy a search, only ordering the gate guards to pay attention to observing the situation on the wall.

Luo Yangming was so anxious that sweat poured from his forehead, yet he couldn't convince the other party. He knew very well that with his status, he indeed lacked sufficient persuasive power. He could bluff locals like the Detective Team, but it didn't work on the Volte Army.

Wang Ken and Mai Dang had been waiting anxiously on the wall. The cannons, gunshots, and various commotions inside and outside the city indicated that something big had happened—naturally, the work of the government troops they had helped enter the city. According to the prior agreement, these people still had to exit the city through their sentry post.

Ever since the men in black entered the city, these two brothers had been living in fear, terrified of being discovered—the rope ladder hanging down beneath their feet was ironclad proof of their collusion with the enemy. Even if it wasn't "execution on the spot," they couldn't escape severe torture and interrogation, eventually unable to escape death.

Although it was dark now and the rope ladder was hard to spot, if someone approached with a torch to patrol, it would be exposed immediately!

On one side was the government's promise of "promotion and wealth," on the other was the possibility of losing their lives at any moment. The two brothers were out of their wits, spinning around on the wall.

Just as they were helpless, they suddenly heard three frog croaks from the base of the wall, followed by another three. Wang Ken's and Mai Dang's spirits lifted—they finally came!

They immediately responded with two frog croaks. In just a moment, a man in black climbed up the rope ladder. Wang Ken said, "You finally came!"

The man in black interrupted him and whispered, "Any movement?"

"The commotion is so big..."

"I mean on the wall!"

"The drum for the general alert was beaten over at the gate tower. The lights have also increased a lot."

"Has anyone come to patrol?"

"That, no..."

"Good." The man in black waved his hand. More people climbed up the rope ladder one after another. Then, someone climbed up carrying another person on his back. Wang Ken and Mai Dang watched with trembling hearts, feeling as if they were dreaming.

Luo Yangming spoke until his mouth was dry and lips scorched without getting through. However, the sergeant felt his suggestion to strengthen wall patrols did no harm, so he sent two Detective Team groups to patrol along the east and west walls.

Watching the torches of these two groups move slowly along the wall, Luo Yangming burned with anxiety. But he couldn't argue further—if he talked too much and caused a mismatch of words leading to a conflict, the porters he brought would be killed for nothing!

Jiang Suo secretly breathed a sigh of relief seeing the True Kun had already been brought up the wall: the matter was basically half done! Just as he was urging the remaining men to climb quickly, firelight suddenly flashed behind the base of the wall, and the sound of rapid footsteps approached.

Pursuers arrived! Jiang Suo cried "bad" inwardly. He drew his waist saber and whispered, "Ten men stay with me to bring up the rear. We must ensure General Song takes the thief away!"

Those brought into the city were all Song Ming's personal guards and family retainers, men who did not fear death. Hearing his command, they immediately gathered around him. Some nocked arrows to bows, others readied firearms, ready to engage in slaughter at any moment.

Wen Tietou had no idea someone ahead was prepared for battle; he just charged forward in the dark. Seeing the Great Cloud Gate tower approaching, firelight suddenly flashed opposite him. He cried out that it was bad and threw himself to the ground in a tiger leap. Instantly, he heard the roar of firearms ahead.

This solid volley of musketry plus arrows instantly knocked down seven or eight of Wen Tietou's men. For a moment, wailing and screaming were everywhere. Some turned and ran back. Wen Tietou's ears buzzed. He felt a warm current flowing down his head; touching it, it was pitch black—blood.

Looking around, his brothers were lying in disorder on the ground; some crying in pain, some silent. This instead aroused Wen Tietou's bloodlust. He shouted, "Pu gai! F*cking get them!" With that, he lifted his waist saber, climbed up, and charged forward. The porters, who had begun to waver, had seen big scenes before. Seeing the leader charge, they also shouted war cries and pounced forward. Jiang Suo gave a great shout and led his men to meet them. Both sides immediately fell into a melee.

Luo Yangming was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. The sound of bird guns shocked him. Looking back, he saw the flash of gunfire about a *li* away, precisely at the base of the wall. It must be Wen Tietou's men engaging the infiltrators.

He hurriedly said to the sergeant, "Look, there's a situation over there!"

The sergeant was also startled. He gazed over. Although the night was dark and he couldn't see clearly, there were sentries at that position. He immediately ordered men to signal with lanterns to inquire, but there was no response.
