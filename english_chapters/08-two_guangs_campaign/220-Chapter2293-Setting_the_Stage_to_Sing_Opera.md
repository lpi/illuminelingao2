# Chapter 2293: Setting the Stage to Sing Opera

"Small one understands!" Zhang Yong knelt down seriously kowtowed a head, "Small one guarantees with life."

"You get up. This matter don't speak to others; at that time one person act according to opportunity is fine!" Song Ming said.

Inside Sanheui Camp, Chang Qingyun recently became "Red Man."

He becoming "Red Man" wasn't difficult; one, Zhao Fengtian once specially cared Liu Youwang, wanted to treat him well. Having this "Imperial Edict," Liu Youwang when discovering Qiaoniang hanged dead before his bed, scared soul fly spirit scatter, then in furious state also only gave Chang Qingyun a few slaps, instead of like other involved people receiving a sound beating. Two, Chang Qingyun served in Shogunate for many years; skill of coaxing people fawning horse was pure blue stove fire. In past he in captive camp still more or less maintained a few scholar’s integrity; although dared not resist, refused to wallow in mire either.

But since he made up mind joining Yi Haoran’s conspiracy, Chang Qingyun realized approaching Liu Youwang this camp big chief had huge benefit to overall plan. So then "Enduring Humiliation Bearing Weight" fawned on Liu Youwang. Just a few days effort, Chang Qingyun became Liu Youwang’s "Miepien Master" (Parasite guest), amusing him to add fun every day.

Liu Youwang chest without a drop of ink; where was opponent of Chang Qingyun this old fox mixing in officialdom for many years. He wandered Shogunates for years; various rich noble families amusement toys none not refined familiar in chest; compared to Liu Youwang only knowing drinking wine and insulting women for amusement, Chang Qingyun equaled opening a "New World's Door" for him.

Rich people's biggest enjoyment, naturally was keeping family courtesans family troupe, acting opera self amusement—speaking of which, this already wasn't entertainment ordinary rich people could enjoy. Chang Qingyun since wanted to urge him enjoy, naturally wanted to do big.

Under Chang Qingyun’s handling, very quickly found actors and musicians able to sing Kun Opera and local earth opera (predecessor of Cantonese Opera) among captives and refugees in Three Headquarters Camp. He knew Liu Youwang this person lust heart very heavy; urged Liu Youwang to search beautiful women in camp again, forcing them to learn singing. Liu Youwang then drank wine listening opera every day; at night forced actresses to accompany sleeping. For a time, young women inside camp everyone endangered. Whole Sanheui Camp complaints filled road. Chang Qingyun walking on road everyone looked sideways; everyone spat and cursed behind back; but daring to point and scold him face to face, not a single one. On contrary, he rocket general became burning hand hot figure in camp—any matter as long as he willing to come out speak a word with Liu Youwang, almost all could be settled.

These news, all transmitted to Yi Haoran's ears through internal line arranged in camp. Yi Haoran somewhat couldn't touch head; because task he gave Chang Qingyun, was devising to expand manpower, at that time committing arson inside camp, creating chaos, cooperating Gou Er bandit gang coming to raid camp assaulting Sanheui.

Didn't expect he surprisingly made such big noise! Although fawning Liu Youwang beneficial to developing work, but such high profile made Yi Haoran worry secretly, deeply afraid provoking some accident. Hurriedly sent people delivering letter, inviting him out quietly.

These days Yi Haoran for convenience of contact, also to avoid attention of people in grain shop, hinted Wen Iron Head could come to him helping manage accounts manage matters every day—Wen Iron Head wished him coming every day, immediately spoke with Luo Yangming. Luo Yangming had no heart to attend other things, also felt he under own uncle-in-law's hand, presumably couldn't make out any trick, agreed. So Yi Haoran left city every morning, moving near dock until afternoon coming back continue teaching Qi Liheng reading.

Yi Haoran didn't put on airs; quickly won good feeling among porters. From time to time Yi Haoran would also take initiative helping Wen Iron Head handle some matters, therefore moving up more convenient.

"You destroying reputation like this, exactly have what attempt?" Yi Haoran asked in meeting, "These days, Wuzhou inside outside city, your fame became smelly not smellable..."

"I now even life don't want, still care this pure reputation?" Chang Qingyun smiled,

"Even not wanting pure reputation, you seducing this Liu Youwang making opera troupe, mellow wine women. I probably also understand your meaning, nothing more than wearing down his will, letting anger in camp boil. At that time easier to start hand. But recently these news faintly transmitted into city; in case this Xie Hair feels this Liu Youwang civil anger too big, changing people how to do? At that time new official taking office, hard to guarantee not taking you doing method to calm civil anger; big situation inside this camp still needs you to preside..."

"You speak naturally reasonable; however, in Student's view, Xie Hair now can't attend to these things." Chang Qingyun spoke with fervor and assurance, "Right now transporting grain is his first class big matter; heaven big matter also waits after grain enters warehouse then say. This Liu Youwang however unbearable, anyhow also managed camp until now; fake public help private bad things done not few. But on official business he didn't make any mistake. To Xie Hair Liu Youwang is a capable cadre; changing general facing battle for 'Civil Anger' of us few captives refugees, he is not that stupid."

This speech said with reason with ground; Yi Haoran for a moment didn't know how to refute either; he somewhat didn't understand what medicine sold in other party’s gourd; heard Chang Qingyun say again: "I urge him making opera troupe, at that time naturally has use..."

"What use?"

"Tell you also no harm." Chang Qingyun chest had bamboo (confident), "This Liu Youwang and Wuzhou Battalion Battalion Commander Zhu Si, Squadron Commander, Platoon Leader responsible for guarding camp 3rd Squadron gang people are very familiar; these officers often came to camp. Do you know why they overly intimate with Liu Youwang like this?

"Could it be wine meat friends of same smell calling each other?"

"Sir indeed is upright gentleman." Chang Qingyun smiled, "If saying wine meat friends, also not wrong. But Liu Youwang this person wine quality very bad, person also vulgar, not an interesting host. This kind of person being wine meat friend is also boring tight. Zhu Si these people reason why willing to be wine meat friend with him, speak white is wine sex convenient inside camp."

These Yi Haoran suddenly realized. Camp inside not only had captives of Wuzhou Battle, also had refugees taken in, also family dependents of official families wandering here... not only plenty of women, had big family ladies, also had small family jasper.

Liu Youwang although official low post small, at this Sanheui had great power of life kill give take; no one dared disobey in camp. To these rough blanks fighting all year round, side only having men, simply was a gentle township. No wonder they wanted to associate with Liu Youwang.

"So it is!" Yi Haoran said, "This Liu Youwang indeed is a shameless villain!"

"Shameless yet how? This is a great good chance." Chang Qingyun said, "Having this opera troupe, these people coming probably will be more diligent. At that time with right title smooth words inviting them come watch opera together..." He smiled, "You feel how is this?"

Yi Haoran dumbstruck; didn't expect this Chang Qingyun still had this hand! He always headache this 3rd Squadron; although 3rd Squadron didn't count as elite, inside had part of backbone veterans, also dozens of Nanyang style rifles. Whether Gou Er’s mob could defeat this squadron in one stroke, he completely had no confidence.

But if taking name of watching opera listening opera, had possibility leading all these officers into camp, disrupting their command. Luck good, even could kill Wuzhou National Army Battalion Battalion Commander Zhu Si together!

Thinking here, Yi Haoran’s gaze involuntarily turned to admiration: "Sir truly has Great Talent!"

"Insect carving small trick only, where can count what Great Talent!" Chang Qingyun leisurely said, "Just I a scholar, at that time wanting to control whole scene afraid not easy; you must prepare some manpower is right..."

"Truth not conceal with each other, in camp we indeed possess some comrades, but manpower not many; wanting to take opportunity of singing opera catching them all solely in one net afraid force has pass not catching..."

"How can have no method?" Chang Qingyun sneered, "Could it be Advisor Yi feels dealing with Hair thief still need one saber one spear face to face calling array then works?"

"Your meaning is?"

"I am lobbying him getting a small kitchen himself, cook already found, but kitchen always needs a few helpers..."

Yi Haoran suddenly realized, heart secretly despised; this Chang Qingyun honored as Juren, methods thought all were dirty means not going on table. No wonder recommender would promote idea of "Burning Wuzhou"!

Dirty return dirty, this person’s management in camp, already exceeded his plotting these days several times. Yi Haoran had to be convinced. Immediately told Chang Qingyun about the few own people in camp quietly.

"...These few people are still reliable; you see if any method to recommend in."

"All are nameless soldiers then easy to say; if having some fame in camp, on contrary not good to recommend."

Just as Chang Qingyun said, Zhu Si these days often found various reasons going to Sanheui "Inspect Defense" or "Examine Training Situation," actually all were going to chase wine chase sex. This road, was exactly introduced to him by 3rd Squadron Squadron Commander.

This Squadron Commander Jiang Yougong, originally was a Banner General in Ming Army. Captured in Chengmai Great Battle. He originally was a bachelor scoundrel, mixing rice in army. After captured stayed in Fubo Army as soldier. Jiang Yougong was quite similar to Zhu Si, both were used to being soldier in old army. Did not quite adapt to new system of Fubo Army side, so not serving long cleared out of ranks, assigned to Farm as employee.

Because he was soldier background, became Farm Militia Captain. This time going north, Senate Great Expansion Army, Jiang Yougong re-enlisted, becoming National Army Squadron Commander.

If National Army composed of naturalized citizens, Jiang Yougong still dared not be too reckless. But the squadron he served as Squadron Commander was purely new organized squadron; soldiers besides NCOs and minority combat backbones were naturalized citizens, mostly came from surrendered guards around Guangzhou and Guangdong Garrison Soldiers. Didn't undergo too much rectification training—actually majority training unfolded completely only after arriving Wuzhou. 3rd Squadron stationed outside city alone; Jiang Yougong losing binding force in such troop could be called like fish getting water; guts gradually became big too.
