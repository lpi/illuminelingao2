# Chapter 2135 - Butterfly Effect

Xie Erren was halfway through the Wuzhou Paper-Wrapped Chicken when Xu Ke arrived in a hurry. Xie Erren instructed to set up a chair and cutlery, and ordered a few more dishes.

"No need to add dishes," Xu Ke waved his hand. "These dishes are enough. Just serve me a bowl of rice."

Seeing Xu Ke's complexion wasn't good, seemingly full of worry, Xie Erren asked, "Old Xu, why are you here so late? Something happened?"

"Yes." Xu Ke picked up the bowl and chopsticks, shoveled a large mouthful of rice into his mouth, and whispered while eating, "I just received a telegram from Zhu Mingxia. The scale of the Eight-Row Yao disturbance has begun to expand, and some Ming army garrison posts have collapsed. A portion of the Yao armed forces are gathering and will likely besiege various county seats."

"This is big trouble!" Xie Erren was startled. The various county seats had just been taken and were basically in an empty state. Some county seats didn't even have National Army troops; except for local forces like militia brave, they could be said to be empty cities.

The withdrawal of the Ming Army's East and West Mountain Anti-Yao Deputy Regional Commander and the Central Route Garrison Commander removed constraints on the Eight-Row Yao Uprising compared to history, causing the outbreak to be larger in scale and wider in scope. In the previous stage, many Ming army Wei-Suo garrison posts that had surrendered in Zhaoqing were besieged, and many stockades had already fallen.

"...In short, this Yao rebellion is fiercer and wider in scope than in history. Zhu Mingxia asked me to tell you to pay attention to city defense and surrounding security work—historically, Yao armed forces attacked Wuzhou many times and even breached it once..."

Hearing this, Xie Erren's hands turned icy cold, and more than half of his original lofty ambition vanished. *This is probably the so-called butterfly effect.* He hurriedly asked, "Wuzhou is a frontline city; are there reinforcements?"

"Zhu Mingxia wishes he could pull Zhu Quanxing's 3rd Battalion back right now. He didn't make that move considering Wuzhou's importance." Xu Ke said, "The 3rd Battalion will still stay in Wuzhou; you can rest assured on this point..."

"How can I rest assured!" Xie Erren was a bit annoyed. "How many people are in the 3rd Battalion? How can they cover the 9 counties and 1 prefecture of Wuzhou Prefecture! You know that inside this dignified Wuzhou Prefecture City of mine, there are only one hundred grunts!"

"Does this depend on your ability? Speaking of people, where aren't they lacking?" Xu Ke smiled and tore a chicken leg off the Paper-Wrapped Chicken to eat. "The National Army in each county will be expanded... I heard approval has been granted, allowing county and city administrative leaders to expand militia teams on the spot. They are also preparing to increase the quota by another five thousand Nanyang Rifles."

"That's more like it. But I haven't seen the shadow of the National Army yet."

"They have already arrived in Zhaoqing and will definitely reach Wuzhou tomorrow or the day after—the West River waterway is still very smooth right now," Xu Ke said.

Hearing that the National Army was about to arrive, Xie Erren felt somewhat relieved. Qian Duo's company belonged to the 3rd Battalion after all. Although he could use it, he couldn't control it; Zhu Quanxing could transfer it away with a single order. In comparison, the National Army made him feel more assured.

"The attack on Guangxi is going to stop now, right?"

"The formal order hasn't come down yet, but it definitely has to stop." Xu Ke said, "We only have this many troops. I will also return to Zhaoqing very soon."

"Now Old Xiong can be comfortable for a few days again."

"Old Xiong comfortable? I think Chongzhen will make him suffer soon—he might even end up committing suicide to escape punishment."

Hearing that Xu Ke was leaving, Xie Erren unconsciously felt a faint sense of loneliness at the bottom of his heart.

After seeing Xu Ke off, Xie Erren looked at the Wuzhou map in the main hall again and again. His situation was really a bit precarious. If the Yao rebellion spread to both banks of the West River, the transportation line behind him would be in imminent danger. At that time, he would be isolated in front of the enemy...

"This is really a bit bad."

Xie Erren started to feel guilty. Looking at this situation, he really couldn't muster up enthusiasm.

*Must repair the city wall as quickly as possible!* He thought. No matter what, as long as the city wall was there, there was a great guarantee of safety. After all, with the level of medieval armies, capturing a prefecture city like Wuzhou was still very difficult.

That night, Xie Erren slept in the rear yamen of the Prefectural Yamen. The thought that the previous owner of this yamen had committed suicide not long ago and he was living in his house made Xie Erren somewhat uncomfortable. However, he was exhausted from the day and fell asleep without much thought.

A dreamless night. When he got up in the morning, he felt energetic and full of vitality, very much in the mood to do big things.

After washing up, he hurriedly ate breakfast and came to the Second Hall of the Prefectural Yamen, which served as his office. Zhao Fengtian was already waiting in the main hall, and beside him was an elderly man, a local *Xiucai* (licentiate).

This Master Xiucai was in his fifties. He collected rent from some land outside the city and had some properties inside the city. He had always been indifferent to an official career. After passing the exams, he had no intention of taking the imperial examinations. Besides idling his days away at home, he traveled to visit mountains and rivers. Not only had he set foot all over the Two Guangs, but he had also been to many barren lands regarded as dangerous paths by locals—not to mention distant places, he had even been to the Wolf Stockades and Yao Caves within the Two Guangs. He was very interested in the geography, customs, folk sentiments, and products of the places he passed through, and was quite famous locally.

His surname was He, original name Shouren, but because he gave himself the alias "Dongli" (Eastern Fence), over time, everyone inside and outside the city called him He Dongli.

Xiucai He was not averse to Australians—he had not only been to Guangzhou but even to Hainan, and had gone all the way to Lingao. He had witnessed with his own eyes the stability and prosperity under the Senate's rule and had a great fondness for Australians. Therefore, when the great army arrived at Wuzhou this time, he maintained a passive attitude towards resistance: firstly, the disparity in strength was huge, and fighting would inevitably lead to defeat; secondly, he saw no necessity to resist. He did have feelings for the Great Ming, but these feelings were not deep enough to make him willing to destroy his family and sacrifice himself for it.

After Xie Erren entered the city, he needed to find a suitable guide to familiarize himself with the local customs. Zhao Fengtian checked the issued "Wuzhou Basic Situation Manual" and recommended this Xiucai He.

Xiucai He didn't decline and came upon invitation. He neither acted coy to show he was "forced to serve thieves" like some literati, nor was he as monkey-anxious to "piggyback on the dragon" as some others. His attitude was very calm and peaceful. After a few sentences, Xie Erren had a very good impression of him. Immediately, he asked him to be a guide to tour the entire Wuzhou City.

He Dongli naturally had no need to refuse. Xie Erren immediately instructed Zhao Fengtian to stay behind in the Yamen and picked a squad of guards to accompany him for protection.

Order on the streets had improved compared to yesterday. Refugees had formed teams and were clearing corpses and ruins one by one under the leadership of militiamen. Although the newly formed militia led by Fubo Army soldiers had average military appearance and discipline, their spirit and energy were somewhat presentable. Xie Erren's worry from last night diminished a bit.

The leading cadres saw him coming and immediately wanted to come up to report. Xie Erren waved his hands: "No rush, you guys work first."

Traces of the existence of the Culture and Propaganda Team also appeared. Walls had been painted with crooked slogans in limewater: "Soldiers and civilians cooperate, expel the Ming bandits"; "Puppet Ming kills and commits arson, Aus-Song cures the sick and saves people"; "Xiong Wencan burned Wuzhou City and killed Wuzhou people, willing to be the filial son and worthy grandson of the Puppet Ming local emperor"... Some places also had propaganda posters and notices pasted. Looking closely, the ink on the notices and the paste on the back hadn't dried yet—probably done just this morning.

This work efficiency was solid. Xie Erren nodded secretly—*Zhao Fengtian is indeed brought out by me personally; the propaganda work is spot on.*

The Wuzhou Prefectural Yamen was located in the south of the city, not far from the Little South Gate. Xie Erren only noticed after leaving the Yamen that the north side of this Wuzhou Prefectural Yamen was adjacent to the Cangwu County Yamen. The south and west sides of this Prefectural Yamen were close to the city wall, situated right in a corner of Wuzhou. Outside the western city wall was the surging Gui River.

Because he requested to climb the city gate to take a look first, He Dongli led him up the Little South Gate, which was closest to the prefectural office. Because the gate tower was named "Dezheng" (Virtuous Governance), it was also called Dezheng Gate.

During the siege, both the Big and Little South Gates were attacked by artillery fire, so parts of both yamens were damaged by shells falling into the city, but the damage wasn't huge. In comparison, the Dezheng Gate tower was severely destroyed. Artillery fire had almost completely destroyed this tower, leaving only a pile of ruins. At this moment, soldiers were supervising prisoner labor teams to dismantle the remaining wreckage and recover some building materials.

He Dongli said that this Little South Gate was only opened when Wuzhou City was rebuilt in the 12th year of Hongwu under Emperor Taizu of Ming. The previous Song and Yuan city walls only had four gates. It was only in the Great Ming that there were five city gates. They were the East Gate, West Gate, Big South Gate, Little South Gate, and North Gate. Based on the names of the towers built on the city gates, they were also called Yangming Gate, Nanxun Gate, Xijiang Gate, Dezheng Gate, and Dayun Gate.

During the Hongwu period, under Zhu Yuanzhang's auspices, a wave of capital construction was set off. The government offices and city walls of various prefectures, departments, and counties across the country were almost all built during this period. Especially the layout of city walls in various cities was basically maintained. Many Ming and Qing city walls preserved until the 21st century can almost be traced back to the Hongwu reign.

However, the newly built Wuzhou City in the Ming Dynasty was not considered too large in area. Although the area had expanded compared to the Song and Yuan periods, the circumference of the Wuzhou city wall was only 2.8 kilometers, not considered too big among Ming Dynasty cities, and even inferior to some important *Suo* cities. This was obviously disproportionate to its important commercial status, so Wuzhou's urban scope had long expanded to the banks of the Gui and West Rivers outside the city. The appearance of pontoon bridges on the Gui and West Rivers was a manifestation of transportation needs after this urban expansion.

Standing on the city wall of the Little South Gate, one could see a circumferential city moat below, which He Dongli said was also called the Dragon-Protecting Dike. It was over two *zhang* wide and over two *zhang* deep. There were wooden fences inside and outside the city moat—however, probably due to old age, many places were missing. Willows were still planted by the moat.

"These were all built in the early Chenghua years when Lord Han Yong was the Governor-General of the Two Guangs. These Wuzhou city walls were also repaired by his hand."

"Is that the Han Yong who broke the Dateng Gorge?" Xie Erren only learned about this person during historical training before taking office.

"Exactly."
