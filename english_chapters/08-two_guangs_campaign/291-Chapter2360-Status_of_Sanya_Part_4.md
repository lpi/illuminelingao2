# Chapter 2360: Status of Sanya (Part 4)

Tang Menglong then provided a detailed account of Sanya's population. The city had over fifty thousand registered residents, plus another ten thousand unregistered slave laborers, bringing the total population to nearly seventy thousand. This figure excluded the several thousand troops and short-term personnel who could not be counted toward the permanent population.

The numbers left a deep impression on Xu Yanliang. Setting aside Guangzhou, even Lingao—the Senate's vaunted "First Metropolis"—had fewer than two hundred thousand inhabitants.

The population concentrated primarily in three districts: Hexi, Tiandu, and Jinling. Of these, Jinling had the largest share. The district boasted ample flat land and abundant water, making it ideal for agriculture, and most farmers who had migrated to Sanya had settled there. Several of the Agricultural Reclamation Bureau's local farms were also located in this area. Tiandu ranked second in population, followed by Hexi.

The briefing continued until evening. That night, Tang Menglong played the gracious host, and the two men drank and conversed until they were thoroughly satisfied. Loosened by alcohol, Xu Yanliang revealed some of the Nanyang Company's future "ambitions," while Tang Menglong beat his chest and pledged "full support." They parted only after thoroughly enjoying themselves.

The following day, Tang Menglong offered to escort him to Hexi District. Xu Yanliang declined—he intended to meet with the Southeast Asia Company's staff at their Sanya trading station, and Tang Menglong's presence would prove inconvenient. He simply requested a guide. Tang Menglong assigned a secretary from the municipal government to accompany him.

The secretary was young, having graduated from Fangcaodi's administrative program only the previous year before being assigned to Sanya. When Xu Yanliang emerged from City Hall, he found the young man waiting at the foot of the steps with two Venus Zero bicycles and four guards, also on bicycles.

Seeing him appear, the secretary immediately snapped to attention and gave a nodding salute:

"Yuan Fei, Secretary of the General Office of Sanya Municipal Government, reporting for duty!"

The Sanya Municipal Government had few departments and even fewer cadres. This so-called secretary was essentially a jack-of-all-trades who handled everything.

"How old are you?" Xu Yanliang asked, unable to suppress a laugh at the rather immature teenager standing before him in an ill-fitting cadre uniform.

"Reporting to the Chief—seventeen!"

"So young. Why didn't you study for a few more years?"

"Reporting to the Chief..."

"Enough with the formalities. Just answer the question."

"Yes! Senator Teacher said I was 'rotten wood that cannot be carved,' and that I'd be better off starting work early. At least I could accumulate a few more years of seniority."

"Assigning 'rotten wood that cannot be carved' to serve as a secretary in Sanya—tell me, who is this unconventional Chief?"

"It's... it's Senator Yang Xinwu."

"Ah, him." Xu Yanliang nearly laughed again but restrained himself. "Can you ride a bicycle?"

"Of course!"

"Then send this wretched rickshaw back. We'll ride over."

"Yes, Chief!"

The group cycled along Senate Avenue, retracing the previous day's route. After reaching the pier, they continued onward. This area on the west bank of the Sanya River, stretching to the east coast, formed a narrow north-south strip. According to the simple urban plan, it was designated as Sanya City's commercial and residential center.

Not far from the pier lay the Trading Station District. In the seventeenth century, commerce and freight transport had not yet fully separated, and merchants engaged in trade typically traveled with their goods. Consequently, various nations established buildings called "trading stations" or "factories" in port cities.

These trading stations were generally organized by country, region, or company, combining accommodation, negotiation, and storage functions, while also offering currency exchange and remittance services. They typically employed fully enclosed management—partly to ensure the personal and property safety of merchants, and partly to facilitate local government oversight and taxation. From the earliest "Steelyard" of the Hanseatic League in London to the barbarian factories of the "Thirteen Factories" in Guangzhou, all were similar institutions. In earlier times, such trading stations also served consular functions.

Because Sanya was positioned as an "International Trade City," land near the pier had been specifically designated for trading stations. However, due to sluggish trade, only the British East India Company, the Dutch East India Company, and the Portuguese had established stations there thus far.

When Xu Yanliang arrived at the Trading Station District, he found it cold and desolate. Across the vast open expanse stood only a handful of small buildings with supporting warehouses. A few flags fluttered listlessly.

"That building there is the Southeast Asia Company's trading station," Yuan Fei called out, pointing to a distant structure as he pedaled.

The Southeast Asia Company's trading station was situated near its dedicated pier. It looked equally desolate. The pier's open-air cargo staging area was spotless—not even a broken crate in sight—only seagulls circling and diving in search of food. The heavy steam cranes and their supporting boilers stood cold, without a single spark. More than a dozen merchant ships lay moored at the trestle bridge, their sails furled. Some had even removed their masts. No sailors were visible aboard; only two bored guards stood watch by the trestle. The scene spoke of winter dormancy and depression.

"Is it always this quiet here?" Xu Yanliang felt increasingly disheartened as he surveyed the scene.

"It's winter now. Things will liven up when the wind shifts next spring," Yuan Fei replied.

Xu Yanliang stopped his bicycle, looked around the pier, and asked, "What ships come here?"

"Mostly British ships. Some Dutch as well. Portuguese ships rarely come."

"Rarely come, yet they still set up a trading station?"

"Few ships come, true. But the trading station itself is quite busy—local merchants often deal with the Portuguese here."

"Oh? Why is that?"

"Not sure," Yuan Fei said.

Xu Yanliang grew suspicious. It wasn't strange that Portuguese ships rarely came—they could sail directly to Macao for business without detouring to Sanya. But if few ships arrived, why had the Portuguese established a local trading station? And since many local merchants were supposedly "shell companies," why did they frequently interact with Portuguese merchants?

Since ancient times, no one rises early without the promise of profit. Behind these anomalies, there had to be some hidden interest.

Yuan Fei was about to lead him forward, but Xu Yanliang said, "Show me around Hexi first. We'll visit the trading station last."

If this was to become his long-term base, better to understand the situation thoroughly from the start.

The convoy passed through the pier area and headed north along Xintiandi Avenue. The commercial district here was far more prosperous than Hedong District, with a much stronger urban atmosphere. The shops lining both sides of the street were two-story "Qilou"—arcade buildings in the style of "Old Guangzhou" and "Old Haikou." These proved very practical in hot, rainy places like Sanya.

His interest piqued, Xu Yanliang dismounted immediately. "Let's walk and have a look!"

Yuan Fei naturally wouldn't spoil his mood and promptly led the way, with four guards flanking them as they strolled along the street.

The road construction here matched Senate Avenue's standards exactly. The sidewalks were paved with local stone. The Qilou buildings, varying in size and height, were also constructed of stone and red brick. Not only was the construction excellent, but the architectural design and appearance were quite refined—even superior to Bairen City. Xu Yanliang also noticed the gas lamps here. Compared to Lingao's simple geometric iron lamp stands, these featured complex and ornate patterns.

*The Senate really pinned high hopes on this place,* Xu Yanliang mused. Now, with the Senate's attention focused on the mainland, Sanya—once envisioned as a "pearl"—had inevitably lost some of its luster.

*How can it be made to shine again?* He fell into contemplation once more.

He wandered beneath the arcades, browsing shop after shop. Judging by their signboards, every trade imaginable was represented, and the shops were well-stocked. But he noticed that most establishments dealt in consumer goods—food, daily necessities, and restaurants. Their customers were primarily locals, and their capital was likely modest.

Logically, as a foreign trade port, there should have been a considerable number of firms engaged in overseas commerce—shops selling imported spices, textiles, and handicrafts, for instance. Such establishments were common in Guangzhou. Yet after walking several hundred meters, he had spotted very few. Clearly, foreign trade did not dominate here.

Seeing his solemn expression, Yuan Fei grew uneasy. Suddenly, Xu Yanliang asked:

"Are there any large businesses here besides these small trading firms?"

"Yes, yes—the biggest firm here is Qionghai Hao..."

"Qionghai Hao? Isn't that Li Luoyou's business?" The familiar name prompted Xu Yanliang to speak without thinking.

"Li Luoyou? No, no—the owner of this firm is surnamed Gu..."

"Oh, right, right. Called Gu... something-Cheng."

"Gu Baocheng."

"Right, Gu Baocheng." Xu Yanliang was puzzled. "Isn't he in Lingao?"

He knew this Gu Baocheng—he was Li Luoyou's favorite, more treasured than a son. Placing him in Lingao had been meant to build up a family business so he could live comfortably as a wealthy man. Why had he come to Sanya?

"This is the Sanya branch of Qionghai Hao. Master Gu isn't here—someone else manages the shop."

Xu Yanliang reflected that this firm was an old partner of the Senate and had proven its reliability. Although Li Luoyou's attitude had been ambiguous—he had fled north to Nanjing in a flash after Guangzhou's recovery—his firms in Guangdong had stayed put and continued operating normally.

"How is this branch doing locally?"

"Standard—they handle some maritime trade. The business isn't large. They have ships on the Kaohsiung route, and ships going to the Portuguese side."

"Anyone else?"

"There's also a branch of Dongshan Ju. Business was quite prosperous before, but word came a few days ago that their Boss Liu was arrested in Guangzhou. Their head office was sealed as well. Now Dongshan Ju is in complete chaos, top to bottom. They can't do business anymore."

"Who manages this firm now?"

"The shopkeeper here is named Chen Huamin—supposedly Boss Liu's cousin. A few days ago, he came to plead tearfully with our Chief for help."
