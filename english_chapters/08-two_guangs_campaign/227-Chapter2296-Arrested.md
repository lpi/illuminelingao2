# Chapter 2296: Arrested

Inside this team were some Ming Army Night Sentinels recruited to surrender; intelligence collected usually also counted accurate. Besides currently also had no ability to question if Detective Team’s intelligence accurate or not; only could reluctantly approve this result.

"Although having intelligence, we can't be careless either." Qian Duo thought in heart; he actually wasn't too worried about night: just as Zhu Si said, at night city gates closed tight, small group enemies grasping to city wall foot also useless. Instead was tomorrow daytime. Although nearby no large group enemies, but small group enemy troops also could take opportunity of tomorrow grain arriving port to conduct harassment.

Harassment although wouldn't go as far as destroying grain boat fleet, but at least could create panic atmosphere, also could delay boat fleet unloading. Although no threat, yet was a trouble. Especially Chief Xie right now regarded "Market Stability" very heavy, didn't hope happening things shocking common people.

If military force abundant some, he would dispatch a platoon to surroundings conducting a suppression work; not seeking wiping out how many enemies, at least could drive small group bandits active in Wuzhou suburbs out, making them unable to influence cargo transport. But now he truly couldn't draw out people.

"Just make do like this first." Qian Duo searched intestine scraped belly for half day, also couldn't think out where still could change out soldiers again.

Daytime although didn't announce martial law, but common people still could guess from certain spider silk horse tracks that big matter want to happen. Cautious ones, people having slightly thin property at home then simply didn't go out door.

Luo Yangming however as usual running outside, busy until feet not touching ground. Waiting until matters all arranged properly was already after four o'clock afternoon.

Although things should do all already arranged properly, other matters all had to wait after grain arrived then could spread fist feet. According to reason this moment could go back rest well. But he still didn't forget Yi Haoran’s external check problem; before going home went to Zhao Fengtian place one time again; received answer still was "No Reply."

"Even can't find, at least also should have a reply right." Luo Yangming felt strange. This obviously didn't comply with work flowma!

"You don't worry." Zhao Fengtian said, "These two days busy, wait grain entering warehouse I check for you from source. See exactly which link happened problem. I still that sentence, really not reassured just arrest him up, wait checking clear then release."

Luo Yangming hesitated for a bit; truth to tell although self had intuition Hao Ran was a suspicious character, but he always didn't have stuff could serve as "Crime Evidence" falling in his hand. Besides he usually often going out counted one.

Usually people Hao Ran most frequently contacted only had a Jiang Qiuchan; she was Wuzhou local person, having root having foot; husband also killed by Ming Army; no matter looking from which angle all had no possibility of acting as Great Ming spy.

Moreover no matter looking from which angle, Hao Ran all was a dignified upright square gentleman; wasn't some evil traitor disciple. Everyone in shop and home all had good feelings to him; even Wen Iron Head said "Mr. Hao is a good person."

Moment, he made up determination: at this juncture, rather wrongly arrest, cannot wrongly release. He lowered voice said:

"Old Zhao! Truth to tell I am still not quite reassured about him. Better according to your saying. Detain up first. Wait passing a few days having conclusion then release."

"Just like this then!" Zhao Fengtian seeing him so caring about Hao Ran this person, also couldn't help valuing up, "I notify Zheng Ergen immediately, telling him to arrest person."

Sent away Luo Yangming, Zhao Fengtian also felt somewhat not reassured; these days he always busy around grain transport work, indeed ignored External Check Letter problem. Even if Teng County’s objective condition couldn't do external check, Teng County County Office also would issue a reply letter over. Absolutely wouldn't be news completely none.

Could it be this letter lost at which link? Zhao Fengtian originally wanted to wait after grain transport work ended then go check; now thinking carefully however felt extremely suspicious; he thought: matter not suitable late, still go find a bit immediately relatively peace heart.

Thinking here, he immediately called people bringing official document receiving sending registry etc basic books over; also called confidential clerk managing receiving sending to check together.

According to flow, this External Check Letter after drafted in County Office becoming text, signed approved by Xie Erren, then loaded into special use official document bag sending to destination. Other party after receiving entered handling flow, then replied back. Every link had handover. One check then knew where problem happened.

According to Zhao Fengtian here file number, confidential clerk very quickly found out document was sent to Xie Erren’s office waiting for signing on that day. But, inside documents returned from Xie Erren office on second day didn't have this document!

Now Zhao Fengtian somewhat flustered spirit. Chief Xie although had quite a few problems, but on work aspect wasn't slack. Isides some relatively important things he would keep for a few days to consider, routine official documents like this "Waiting Because Received This" inevitably would be signed on second day.

"Check all registrations of following days! Until today!" Zhao Fengtian ordered.

Result still gained nothing. Zhao Fengtian not dying heart, checked all incoming document registrations from Teng County one time again; didn't have this document’s number either.

Now Zhao Fengtian completely stunned. Now only left one possibility: Chief Xie kept this document at his place, didn't sign and issue—this strictly speaking was not complying procedure; official document once generated number then must have whereabouts. He disagreeing this matter also had to return according to procedure; absolutely no practice of detaining document.

Hao Ran’s external check document surprisingly just disappeared like this? This also too strange!

He was old naturalized citizen cadre; knew this matter afraid very complex; couldn't help becoming nervous. Immediately ordered people finding Zheng Ergen coming.

"Old Zheng, you immediately send people, go to Luo Yangming’s Rice Shop, arrest a master inside called Hao Ran."

"Yes!" Zheng Ergen agreed, "After arresting, have interrogation direction?"

"Lock up first. This is preventive arrest."

"Understood. I send people go now."

After Zheng Ergen left, Zhao Fengtian drank several cups of tea in office, didn't sort out a clue either. This document exactly was what matter?! Now looking, problem only could happen at Chief Xie’s office side...

Recently this period, Chief Xie always handling work back and forth between Prefecture Yamen and Three Headquarters; document box also would carry with body. Also not good to judge exactly where happened problem.

"Only go to office to investigate and ask." Zhao Fengtian thought in heart, this document vanishing without cause must have reason; must check water falling stone out (get to bottom) no possible.

Yi Haoran this time was correcting tracing red (calligraphy practice) Qi Liheng wrote when coming to class in morning in room. He hit red circle on written good characters; also hit ink bar on few written bad ones; properly wrote model characters.

This homework also corrected about there; Yi Haoran thought in heart, this was also last time correcting window lesson for this child. Tonight was exactly moment of action; after a mixed battle regardless dead alive, he all impossible to come here teaching career solving confusion again.

Ah Heng was a clever child, quite had natural gift; could imagine his father should be a boundless future young scholar. Pity, age young then died in chaotic army hand.

If could give him time, teaching carefully, this child’s future on Civil Service Examination in future also couldn't be looked down. However right now national affairs day wrong, where still could contain a desk of scholar. Hair thief once stealing occupying Huaxia, Name Teaching (Confucianism) inevitably suffer disaster of extinguishing top; at that time probably even Sage Books no one would read again, let alone Civil Service Examination!

This child probably also would be delayed right; without father’s blessing protection, future life probably would be very arduous too. Amidst chaotic world, human nothing more than a floating duckweed leaf, following waves drifting flow only...

"Mr. Hao." Ah Chun appeared at door, expression somewhat nervous, "Outside have a few catching runners looking for you."

"Oh," Yi Haoran's brush paused a bit, said, "You wait a moment slightly, I come out now."

Finished saying, he wrote last few model characters well; put away brush ink; only then walked slow steps coming to shop hall; several Fake Hair police were waiting for him.

"You are Hao Ran?" Leading one asked.

"Student is." Yi Haoran mood calm, no waves.

"This is arrest document." Police took out a paper document.

Li Wensheng walked out from accounting room hurriedly, expression nervous and excited, asked: "This is what matter?! Why want to arrest Mr. Hao? What matter did he commit?"

Police said: "We handle errand by order. Exactly committed what matter, go to station then say."

"Reasonless without cause, how to take people? Mr. Hao is serving errand for our East Owner Master Luo; Master Luo is this Prefecture Aftermath Bureau’s Bureau Director; you don't act recklessly."

"Old Sir, you don't excited," Leading police pleasant face pleasant color, "This is arrest document; we are also public affair. Don't let everyone embarrassed."

Yi Haoran said: "Not important. Student didn't do loss heart matters; thinking come also no important things. Go then go. Not hinder matter." Finished saying he cupped hands saying to Li Wensheng: "Trouble you report to East Owner one sound; accounts are all at old place; last month account already inventoried clear. Also trouble inform Sister of Jiang family one sound; these few days can't teach Liheng. His window lesson notebooks I all corrected well, just on desk."

Li Wensheng seeing him attitude calm, words peaceful; faintly had meaning of "Farewell"; right now Two Guangs war affairs not settled; Wuzhou practiced "Military Law"; killing people like home common meal. Advisor Hao once arrested, fear not good tomorrow would head hanging high at city gate. He came these days, bringing out better in each other with people in shop, residence; each other all had affection. Li Wensheng even didn't want his chess friend dying of unnatural life bafflingly. Hurriedly said: "Sir don't gray heart; wait Master comes back I go report him, asking him think method rescue." Finished saying said to police again: "Several Errand Masters, my family Master is Aftermath Bureau Bureau Director; often running before Master Xie. Several Errand Masters please look after this Mr. Hao more; definitely have heavy thanks." Finished saying, called Ah Chun go to counter taking four silver dollars over.

"This four dollars money, giving several Errand Masters buying pair straw sandals to wear."

Several police all showed joy color on face; however leading one didn't fake color (kept stern face), said: "Money you keep up; we don't want. Who you find to appeal is your freedom. Person we naturally will treat well. Take away!"
