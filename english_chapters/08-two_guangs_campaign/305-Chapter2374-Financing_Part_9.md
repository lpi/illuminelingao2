# Chapter 2374: Financing (Part 9)

Zhang Yunmi had her own sedan chair. Actually, she didn't like this kind of pomp much; sitting in it wasn't comfortable—one could basically only sit upright. After all, the chair in this official sedan was a square, official's hat chair, hard and cold, without a bit of "ergonomic" concept, far from a service carriage.

However, in Guangzhou city, riding carriages was too limited by road conditions, so the Senators had no choice but to compromise and use sedan chairs as the main means of transportation. Zhang Yunmi rode a four-person sedan that originally belonged to some unknown official in the city.

She was just about to get in when Zhang Xiaoqi waved at her.

"Little sister, come sit with your elder sister!"

Actually, Zhang Yunmi didn't really appreciate Zhang Xiaoqi's enthusiasm. But she knew she was isolated and helpless in the Senate, and the "goodwill" of some Senators harbored ulterior motives. Therefore, she was vigilant everywhere. However, she still trusted Wang Qiyi and Zhang Xiaoqi, this model couple among Senators, relatively well—of course, part of this trust also came from her relationship with Wang Muqing.

Zhang Yunmi certainly knew that character didn't equal work ability, but she had seen Wang and Zhang's work ability and interpersonal skills firsthand—why was the difference between people so big? Involuntarily, she thought of her father again.

This couple had no issues with their character, and were rising "stars" in the Senate. Since they expressed friendliness and goodwill toward her, she naturally wouldn't refuse.

Zhang Xiaoqi's sedan was an eight-person grand sedan formerly used by the Guangdong Provincial Administration Commission. The inside was very spacious, and two people sitting together didn't feel crowded. Sometimes when going to inspect work or attend meetings together, the husband and wife would share the same sedan.

Wang Qiyi's buttocks hadn't even settled when he saw this scene and quickly got down swiftly to switch to Zhang Yunmi's sedan—no doubt, his wife had some private words to say to Zhang Yunmi again.

His wife was perfect in everything, just couldn't stand seeing little girls suffer losses. It was the same with Nan Wan'er, and the same with Zhang Yunmi.

With a shout of "Depart!" from the municipal government guard secretary, the procession of sedan chairs slowly set off. The target was the second spot they had just discussed for the snap inspection: the Police Bureau. The first inspection point was, of course, the Municipal Government! Enjoying the treatment of Senator personal inspection throughout—because there was no extra manpower. Now, they were going to the Police Bureau to do a snap inspection, and along the way, pick up personnel for the next targets.

The sedan bounced rhythmically. Zhang Yunmi silently reviewed today's meeting: originally the meeting was about fiscal and taxation issues, but halfway through, a Senator Chu barged in, and then the taste of the meeting changed.

Liu, Wang, Zhang, Ai... she understood every word each of them said, and understood the meaning, but felt vaguely that each of them had hidden meanings, saying one thing and meaning another.

This sudden "inspection" obviously contained some implication as well. Zhang Yunmi felt that she seemed to know something, but always felt there was still a veil in between, hazy and not clear.

"What? Can't figure it out?" Zhang Xiaoqi, who had come prepared, spoke up.

"Hm?" Zhang Yunmi was still trying hard to sort out their various stances and the "implications" of their statements—during her days in Guangzhou, she had come to understand some "coded language." Being suddenly called, she was a bit dazed.

"Speaking of, there really is something I don't understand." Zhang Yunmi knew that she invited her to ride together today because there was something to say, and since she had now spoken, she would just follow her lead, "Big sister, please help me explain. Especially his attitude."

"Speaking of this, I'm not sleepy anymore." Zhang Xiaoqi was originally prepared to give a lecture on "The Discourse on the Rong Mansion," and now she heard "his"! Hmm, interesting, already using direct references.

"You didn't fail to understand what happened today, did you?"

"Um... Big sister is clever! Now that you mention it, I did feel something was off from the beginning." After recalling, Zhang Yunmi said affirmatively: "I feel... everyone's reaction seemed a bit... indifferent... I think, this matter is very bad, but why did everyone seem like they were listening to a joke..."

Zhang Xiaoqi first felt a thump in her heart: why hasn't this girl figured it out? Thinking more carefully, why did this girl get sent abroad at such a young age? Wasn't it precisely because her father's life secretary was "the slave bullying the master"! This girl asking this question was empathizing! Then I should enlighten her! Zhang Xiaoqi's maternal instinct awakened, entering home education mode.

"Hey! It's just us sisters here, let's not speak in platitudes." Although she said this, she still lowered her voice, after all, the sedan carriers weren't their "sisters," and this sedan, frankly speaking, had no soundproofing effect at all.

"First, the victim isn't here; we don't need to get worked up, right?"

Zhang Yunmi nodded—but, not getting worked up doesn't mean it should be brushed off lightly...

"Second, let alone what it means for us; even the victim himself could have just shot that whatever secretary dead—of course, there would inevitably be a commotion. But, although there would be punishment in the end, ultimately it wouldn't be too heavy. Right?" Zhang Xiaoqi said lightly: "For an ant that can be crushed with one hand, what's there to be so angry about? Worked up the liver too much, need to stir-fry some liver tips?"

When these words came from Zhang Xiaoqi's mouth, Zhang Yunmi felt a slight chill—was this what Liu Xiang often called "the consciousness of the ruling class"? At this moment, the light from the guiding torch outside shone in, just hitting "Sister Zhang's" face—she was smiling warmly, but suddenly Zhang Yunmi felt a slight chill on her neck.

"...Mm." Zhang Yunmi quickly lowered her head. What was turning in her mind at this moment wasn't Chu He whom she had no impression of, but her own f***ed up past.

She gathered her thoughts and asked following Zhang Xiaoqi's words: "But, even if killing her results in just a penalty drink, wouldn't he have made an enemy of Zhou Wei?"

"Zhou Wei... this secretary doing things like this..." Zhang Xiaoqi quickly adjusted the characterization issue before continuing: "This grudge was formed long ago. Even without this incident, even if they later cooperated happily, wouldn't Chu He and his group still have a grudge? Later, when Zhou Wei and Huang Qi's proposals are inexplicably opposed at general meetings, they probably still won't understand when they offended people. That's why we always emphasize managing the people around you. When the people around you dig a pit for you, you fall in bafflingly, and you might still be in the pit wondering why the whole world opposes you. From ancient times to now, countless high officials and nobles have stumbled because of the people around them."

The reasoning was correct, but it had nothing to do with her... right? The father and daughter who had only been corresponding by letter had somewhat grown distant in their relationship. Zhang Yunmi suddenly felt a bit lacking in confidence.

"Then, why not handle it seriously? Everyone looked like there was nothing they could do! Clearly they could like..." Saying this, Zhang Yunmi originally wanted to use her own example, but stopped when the words reached her lips.

Zhang Xiaoqi quickly reached out to stroke Zhang Yunmi's back, looking like she was doting on her eldest daughter.

"This matter, it depends on who you want to deal with."

Zhang Yunmi didn't move, picking up the question.

"Isn't it just one person... uh... maybe two?"

"Let's talk about them one by one." Zhang Xiaoqi smiled slightly and slowed the rhythm of her stroking.

"This whatever Secretary Zhou, well, we actually don't have any way to deal with her."

"Not because she's capable, but because this mess has been put in the public eye." Zhang Xiaoqi analyzed: "Once it's out in the open, everyone has to follow the rules, both openly and secretly. They have to protect interests—not just Chu He's interests, but also Zhou Wei's. He Chu He is a Senator; isn't Zhou Wei also a Senator? When things are put into the 'public discussion' situation, what's being protected is the interests of 'Senators.'"

Zhang Xiaoqi paused to catch her breath and continued: "Even if Chu He didn't have the guts to kill anyone, if he had just given that whatever Secretary Zhou a few full-force slaps on the spot—there wouldn't be so much trouble here. When Zhou Wei comes back, we step forward, and Chu He himself throws a banquet, drinks three penalty cups, what can Zhou Wei say? It's not just Chu He's business; the people Zhou Wei offended, even if they don't applaud, definitely support it in their hearts! With Zhou Wei's personality, he might even personally help pour the wine."

The more she said, the clearer it became, but her heart also grew colder. Zhang Yunmi knew that back when her father's incident came out, Senators probably discussed it in this same tone.

The sedan was pitch black. Zhang Xiaoqi couldn't see this "little sister's" expression and continued:

"The difficulty is that Chu He really could endure. According to Old Liu, he didn't even give a slap. If he had slapped her a few times, when that secretary cries to Zhou Wei when he comes back, it becomes a personal grudge. Then whether Zhou Wei confronted it head-on, or hung this secretary at the guesthouse entrance and whipped her with a belt, the matter would be small and wouldn't concern us."

"But he just turned around and came to the municipal government. Coming is coming. If it were just trapping Old Liu alone, but coincidentally, we were having a meeting today, and he bumped into us. Since we bumped into the matter, we could hardly not express a stance... Speaking of expressing a stance, but when things are blown up, there's only one stance we can express."

Right, right, right, but why didn't they go for the kill? Back then I was considering my father's feelings and my own face... How did today's matter just blow over?

"But expressing a stance is simple; action is difficult. Little sister, let me ask you, what unit is Zhou Wei?"

"Ah! Nanyang Company? No other position, right?"

"Right, Nanyang Company... a commercial organization! Chu He's entry point for his complaint was not following administrative regulations... But, they're not an administrative unit!"

"But the Nanyang Company is a national policy company. According to our 'Supervision Regulations,' the personnel and administrative management of national policy-level enterprises under the Planning Committee's jurisdiction are referenced to Senate administrative agencies."

Zhang Xiaoqi nodded approvingly: "Little sister, you've been paying attention! You're right! But, there's still one problem here. This Nanyang Company, strictly speaking, hasn't been formally established yet. Besides Zhou Wei himself and the employees of the Southeast Asia Company, no one is its employee."
