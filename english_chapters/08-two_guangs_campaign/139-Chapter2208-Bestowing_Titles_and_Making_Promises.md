# Chapter 2208 - Bestowing Titles and Making Promises

"You say the Australians want to pacify me and Brother Feng?" Sun Dabiao narrowed his eyes.

One of his eyes was blind—the result of an arrow wound over twenty years ago while robbing salt smugglers. The arrowhead had come within a hair's breadth of killing him. Years of fighting for control of the salt route had left his face covered in scars, giving him a fearsome countenance.

"That's right." Zhang Tianbo nodded. He was nervous, uncertain what his sworn brother was thinking. He hastened to add: "I'm merely passing on the message. The decision is yours, Elder Brother."

Sun Dabiao stroked his chin, rather conflicted. Since ancient times, "murder and arson leading to pacification" had been the best outcome for *jianghu* brothers. But he was wary of the Australians. Why? Because many of his followers had fled north from counties further south, seeking refuge with him. They said that since the Australians took the provincial capital, they had ruthlessly "suppressed" all manner of *jianghu* folk along the way—capturing and killing them, hanging dozens or hundreds along the roads. No one had ever heard of any hero receiving pacification—Liu Lao-xiang might count, but he was a sea lord, a different breed from their "greenwood."

Now, the moment this Magistrate Wang took office, he suddenly wanted to offer pacification? Sun Dabiao could not help but be suspicious.

At heart, though, he badly needed this pacification—the current situation was truly dire.

Unlike Feng Haijiao, Sun Dabiao had always been counted among "law-abiding citizens" in Yangshan, though he had a name in the greenwood. He had never formally taken to banditry. Ordinarily, he did not waylay merchant travelers—unless they were foolish enough to smuggle salt into the Yao territories or refuse to pay passage fees.

Yet he was the undisputed local tyrant of Dalang Market. Anything he chose to meddle in, no one could stop. In Dalang Market, his word carried more weight than the magistrate's.

This time, however, the Yao uprising had dealt him a devastating blow. Over a thousand Yao besieged Dalang Market. Though he had been prepared, his few hundred men crumbled after a few clashes, scattering in all directions. He escaped with his life only thanks to a handful of die-hard brothers who fought to protect him. He had foreseen trouble and sent his family and portable wealth to the county seat, but his shops and residence in Dalang Market were looted clean. Worse, the Yonghua Yao—who had nursed years of resentment over his salt monopoly and price-gouging—set fire to his properties, burning half the street along with them.

Though he had returned to Dalang Market, he was a shell of his former self. He was not the only casualty—most of the merchants in Dalang Market had been ruined by the disaster. Only a few shops had limped back into business. Dalang Market had been his cash cow; now it could not yield a single drop.

He had lost his salt, his shops, his residence. At least he still had a few thousand taels saved up, plus the "prestige" accumulated over the years. But ever since the Yao sacked Dalang Market and sent him fleeing in disgrace, that prestige had diminished considerably.

If he accepted pacification, he could cloak himself in official authority; many things would be easier to do.

At this thought, his heart stirred. He asked about "Magistrate Wang's terms."

"CTM!" Hearing Wang Chuyi's conditions, Sun Dabiao burst into curses. "NND, what kind of terms are these? Make me a *baojia* headman? And disband my brothers—so they can be rounded up for his merit report? What kind of bird-brained official is this Magistrate Wang—does he even know the rules?!"

Zhang Tianbo soothed him: "Elder Brother! This isn't a one-shot deal. If he opens high, we counter low. Magistrate Wang may ask the sky; we can pay the earth."

"If I weren't busy rebuilding my house, I'd show this damned Magistrate Wang a thing or two." Sun Dabiao cursed freely, though inwardly he felt hollow. His current strength was depleted—only thirty or forty reliable men at hand; counting the scattered part-time bandits in the countryside, perhaps a hundred at most. Never mind showing the Australians anything—if the Yonghua Yao came for another round, he could not hold.

"Go tell this Magistrate Wang: I'll submit to the Australians—but I want a title. One that lets me command troops. My brothers get enlisted and draw pay, supplied by the county. And Dalang Market remains under my authority." His eyes shifted; he thumped his chest.

Zhang Tianbo knew his sworn brother was currently weak. He wanted to press him to accept Wang Chuyi's terms, but then he recalled Li Shuangkuai's words and grew cautious. He had been sworn brothers with Sun and Feng for years; they had always stood together. If Magistrate Wang harbored ill intent and used this pacification to lure and kill his brothers, they would all perish together. After a moment's thought, he said:

"Elder Brother Sun, I don't think we need to rush. Should we discuss this with Brother Feng?"

Sun Dabiao's eyes shifted. This pacification included Feng Haijiao too. Feng was based at Qinglian Market; thanks to the terrain, he had suffered little during the uprising. He still had considerable strength. If they could join forces to bargain with the Australians, Sun could borrow his influence.

But openly, he was unwilling to say so—he feared Zhang Tianbo would look down on him, and even more feared Feng Haijiao would probe his weakness and then devour him. He blustered: "Why bother with him? He's a river rat. With Australian gunboats running up and down the river, he's already too scared to do business. I doubt Magistrate Wang even wants him! Bringing him in would only be a burden!"

Zhang Tianbo urged: "The three of us swore an oath—one rises, all rise; one falls, all fall. If we don't include him in the pacification, won't people say you lack loyalty? Besides, Magistrate Wang said he'd welcome Brother Feng's submission as well."

"Since you put it that way, so be it!" Sun Dabiao said with feigned reluctance. He turned and summoned a lackey: "Take my card to Qinglian Market. Invite Third Master Feng to discuss business!"

Feng Haijiao had not been having an easy time of it either. Qinglian Market lay on the Lian River's bank, surrounded by water on three sides—easy to defend, hard to attack. The Yao uprising had not reached his lair. But once fighting broke out, merchant traffic on the Lian River ceased entirely; his "protection fee" racket ground to a halt. As for going out to plunder—once the war started, there were no merchants left on the river. The only vessels were Australian supply ships—fat targets, to be sure, but their gunboats also prowled the river. After losing four fast boats, Feng Haijiao finally understood that provoking the Australians was a losing proposition.

Stuck in his water stronghold with no income and expenses unchanged, feeding over a hundred brothers was no small burden.

Just as Feng Haijiao was sighing and wondering which way to turn, visitors arrived.

Feng Haijiao found this curious: Normally, *jianghu* heroes coming to join up or passing through would pay respects—but in such chaotic times, who would purposely travel to Yangshan?

He invited them in and found one was an old acquaintance: Xie Wendong, formerly the second-in-command at Weihu Mountain in Huining County. The others with him were not *jianghu* folk.

After introductions and courtesies, Feng Haijiao learned that the men accompanying Xie Wendong were Bi Xuansheng and Zhan Zhekun, secretaries to the Yang family—a powerful clan from Huining.

He had no prior dealings with the Yang Jinghui household; their sudden arrival via Xie Wendong's introduction was unexpected.

When he asked their purpose, Bi Xuansheng did not hide it. He said that his master had received a commission from Governor-General Xiong Wencan and had risen in "anti-Hair-Clipper, pro-Ming" rebellion. They had already clashed with the Hair-Clippers several times in Huining.

"...This Master Zhan is not actually my employer's secretary—he comes from Governor-General Xiong's staff." Bi Xuansheng lowered his voice conspiratorially.

"I am indeed from the Governor-General's retinue," said Zhan Zhekun—a fair-skinned, beardless, refined-looking middle-aged scholar. "This time I have come specifically to meet the hero and invite him to join the national cause and vanquish the demons."

He produced a document from his clothing. Feng Haijiao took it—a certificate of appointment, stamped with the seal of the Liangguang Governor-General. It bore Zhan Zhekun's name—the title was "Staff Advisor"—and instructed all officials and civilians of Liangguang to extend him every convenience.

Though Feng Haijiao styled himself a bold hero "who fears no official," in truth he held officials in awe. The greatest he had ever seen was a seventh-rank county magistrate. Now, suddenly confronted by a "Staff Advisor" from the Governor-General's entourage, his head swam. He scrambled to his feet to bow again.

"Hero Feng, no need for formalities," Zhan Zhekun said. "This student has risked great danger to come here for one reason: to deliver a great fortune to the hero."

"Yes, yes—please instruct me, Your Lordship."

Zhan Zhekun explained: The Hair-Clippers were ravaging Guangdong; the people were in misery. But Governor-General Xiong had already mustered a great army in Guangxi, and the court would soon dispatch reinforcements. Within months, imperial forces would counterattack Guangdong. The Governor-General was now recruiting heroes throughout Guangdong to rise in "anti-Hair-Clipper, pro-Ming" rebellion. Once the Governor-General recovered Guangzhou and the court assessed merits, everyone would receive official posts—honors for themselves and their descendants.

The pie was painted beautifully, and for a moment Feng Haijiao's blood boiled. But as soon as Zhan Zhekun finished, half that ardor cooled. He was barely keeping his hundred-odd men fed; what "righteous uprising" could he manage? Just preventing mutiny among his followers was stretching his resources thin.

"I appreciate the Governor-General's kindness," Feng Haijiao said with a bitter smile. "But right now I'm besieged in my water stronghold without grain or pay. Even if I wished to support Ming, I lack the means..."

"Grain and pay—what do those matter?" said Zhan Zhekun. "Yangshan County is Ming territory; its people are Ming subjects. Paying grain and taxes is their duty. If you are willing to raise the banner, the Governor-General can appoint you Left-Flank *Bazong* of Yangshan—a bona fide imperial military officer!" He drew a blank commission from his bundle. "Once the hero agrees, I will fill in his name at once, and the hero becomes an officer of the court. The Governor-General authorizes you to act with full discretion within Yangshan County!"
