# Chapter 2130 - The New Official Takes Office

The External Intelligence Bureau seemed like a reasonable choice. But he had no knowledge of the Ming Dynasty and didn't want to be posted at an overseas station—not because he was afraid of death, he claimed, but because conditions at foreign postings were too harsh.

Though he tried hard to brand himself as an "ideology expert," hoping to parlay a PowerPoint presentation titled "A Plan for the Ideological Reconstruction of the Pseudo-Ming Intellectual Class" into a position as "Secretary-General of the Ideological Construction Committee," Zhang Haogu had beaten him to it, establishing the Truth Office first and monopolizing that sphere. As a result, he ended up as second-in-command at the Truth Office, spending his days rewriting and doctoring materials from the old timeline, churning out endless "guidance opinions" and "propaganda pamphlets."

"Without ideals, what's the difference between a man and a salted fish?" Spurred by this sentiment, when the Mainland Offensive began and large numbers of Council members were needed to staff local governments, Xie Erren decided that being a "lord of a hundred *li*" wasn't bad—at least he'd be the one calling the shots locally. Conditions might be rough, but as the top man in his posting, he'd have the clout to build himself a comfortable little fiefdom.

So he promptly signed up for the administrative training course for northward-bound Council members, ready to lead from the front.

He was assigned to the West Route detachment of the Qiongya Column, responsible for receiving the western sector of Guangdong. Wuzhou was the westernmost point of the entire takeover plan and the western terminus of Phase One of the Two-Guang Offensive. It had to be prepared for a possible Ming counterattack from Guangxi, serve as the logistics base for the next phase's offensive into Guangxi, and, as much as possible, restore commercial trade with Guangxi. As the mayor of Wuzhou, his responsibilities were substantial; therefore, a Council member was required on-site. And so Xie Erren became the Wuzhou Regional Director, with jurisdiction roughly corresponding to the old Ming Wuzhou Prefecture.

To get himself up to speed as quickly as possible, Xie Erren had traveled with the Fubo Army from the start of the Mainland Offensive, accompanied by his maidservant and several naturalized assistants. As part of the Forward Headquarters, he had stayed right at the front lines. He figured that even if he couldn't contribute to military decision-making, witnessing the campaign decisions of several brigades firsthand would be useful for later writing a "Chronicle of the Mainland Campaign." And along the way, he could observe specific examples of takeover operations and learn everyone's practical methods.

Throughout the journey, Xie Erren had mostly positive assessments of the takeover work at each location, and he was humble about absorbing lessons. Only on the subject of propaganda work at every stop did he sneer.

As he saw it, the Council's newspapers—run by a temporary worker turned journalist—were bad enough; propaganda work under Zhang Haogu amounted to nothing more than "gold ruble" tactics. In short, it didn't meet his standards.

"These people mock 'press-titutes' all day, but most of them have never seen a real journalist. Once we've pacified the realm, I'll show them what a veteran of the media battlefield looks like."

Of course, the realm wasn't pacified yet. But running some counter-propaganda in Wuzhou should be no problem—a chance to apply his professional expertise.

This time, however, he hadn't made it in time for the "first moment" liberation of Wuzhou. He had been in Zhaoqing, handling the interrogation, screening, and "re-education" of prisoners and defectors, and had only rushed here from Zhaoqing yesterday.

Xie Erren said goodbye to the 1st Brigade officers but didn't immediately lead his team into the city. Instead, he set up a temporary office in a ruined temple by the West River. Zhu Quanxing had already gone in to begin takeover work; barging in now would create a two-headed command situation that would only hinder operations. Better to wait for things to calm down before entering.

Though he didn't enter the city—sparing himself the bother of socializing with "worthies" and the chaos of initial relief work—the work at hand was far from light. The prisoners from the Wuzhou battle and the war refugees who had lost their homes numbered over ten thousand.

The refugees were manageable. Most were Wuzhou locals; though they had lost homes and possessions in the fighting, some relief, help getting back on their feet, temporary housing, and a portion seeking shelter with relatives would settle most of them. Those truly unable to survive locally could be resettled as migrants elsewhere.

The real headache was the soldiers. Local troops, having families in the area, didn't dare cause trouble; after screening, they could simply be released to go home. But most of the prisoners were guest troops.

These men were mostly able-bodied males—strong, organized. They couldn't be released at will, or they'd immediately turn bandit. But they couldn't be kept in custody indefinitely eating rations, which would strain Fubo Army logistics. And they certainly couldn't be "buried alive" as some armchair Council members advocated—after all, the Fubo Army represented civilization, not the Manchus or later fascists. Handling these POWs had become his first major problem.

There were established policies for prisoners. Professional soldiers like these were typically organized into labor battalions and put to work, earning points toward freedom over a set term. After that, they could stay or leave as they chose. However brutal they might have been, a few years of hard labor under strict supervision would domesticate them.

In other locations, this would be the standard procedure. But Wuzhou was on the front lines; the entire supply corridor behind it was flanked by potential trouble zones. Keeping several thousand able-bodied men organized for labor was one thing, but if someone incited them to "sharpen sticks into spears," the consequences could be disastrous.

Yet he was reluctant to ship these several thousand prime laborers to the rear—Wuzhou's development desperately needed manpower.

Xie Erren paced the ruined temple, threw on his short trench coat from the old timeline, clutched a Council-member-issue cigar, and strolled back and forth along the West River, racking his brains for a solution that would satisfy both needs.

In the old timeline, Xie Erren had been a non-smoker, relying on Starbucks to stay awake through workdays. In this timeline, to ingratiate himself with the Army's young Turks, he had taken up smoking. His trench coat had been a luxury brand back in the old world; here, it was part of his personal image.

On the sleeve was an armband: red background, white characters reading "Bopu"—commemorating the battle against pirates at Bopu Harbor, which had cemented his ties to the Army. During that fight, he had wielded an SKS and killed one pirate—the only "blooded" temp among the noncombatants.

Xie Erren stood with one hand on his hip, the other holding his cigar, pacing the riverbank. The troop movements on both shores, the pontoon bridges and gunboats on the water painted a rather impressive tableau of war. He stopped from time to time to gaze intently.

Behind him trailed his secretary: Zhao Fengtian. Zhao Fengtian was a Shandong man saved by Elder Lu during a famine. When they first boarded the ship, the Council member registering names had run out of ideas and started naming refugees after automobile brands: "Ma Benchi" (Mercedes), "Ji Baoma" (BMW), "Liu Bieke" (Buick). When it was his turn and he said his surname was Zhao, the Council member chuckled: "Oh, a 'state surname'—I'll give you a good one: 'Fengtian' (Fengtian, as in Toyota)!"

Though he never understood why every Council member he met would smile upon hearing his name, for Zhao Fengtian—whose family had farmed Shandong soil for generations—"Fengtian" (Bountiful Fields) was truly a fine name. He had been through decontamination, learned to read, passed the cultural exam, and become a cadre of the Council of Elders.

Now he was working as Secretary Xie Erren's assistant, waiting at a respectful distance for instructions.

A few steps ahead, Xie Erren stood with one hand on his hip, the other raising a cigar as he gazed out over the river.

Seeing his trench coat slipping, his bodyguard hurried forward to drape it back over his shoulders.

Xie Erren paused, glanced at the guard, then turned: "Zhao Fengtian!"

Zhao Fengtian had been conferring with a few bodyguards. Hearing his name, he told them "Got it?" and trotted over.

"Take this down." Xie Erren pointed at him, and Zhao Fengtian produced paper and pen.

"I issue the following dispositions: the 4th and 11th Columns plus two independent divisions will reinforce the Tashan defensive line. The 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th, and 9th Columns plus the 17th Division of the 6th Column will take Jinzhou. The 10th Column plus one division will block the Liao Yaoxiang Corps at the Heishan–Dahushan line. The 12th Column plus twelve independent divisions will besiege Changchun. The 5th Column and two divisions of the 6th Column will monitor Shenyang. The 1st Column will serve as the general reserve."

Zhao Fengtian grew more bewildered with every word. He stared at Xie Erren, utterly confused. Xie Erren immediately snapped in a commanding tone: "Repeat that back to me."

"Sir... sir..." Zhao Fengtian was at a loss. "What is all this...?"

"Oh—never mind what I just said. I was just getting into character," Xie Erren coughed awkwardly, pulling himself out of his *The Great Decisive Battle* reverie. "Write down the following."

"Yes!"

Xie Erren dearly wanted to issue orders like Marshal Lin—crisp and forceful: "I order! First—Second—" and finish with "CC: Wang, Ma, Wen..."

But after all that mood-building, though the mood was right, he had no idea what to actually say. He got as far as "First—" and then stalled.

There was certainly no shortage of things to do—a thousand tasks and ten thousand threads. But these all had "precedents"; he just needed to "follow procedure." No need to report, no "creative thinking," and while it might make sense to copy the Wuzhou matters to "Wen" in the field, copying "Wang" and "Ma" at headquarters seemed rather out of line.

Zhao Fengtian waited and waited but heard no instructions. Meanwhile, a messenger had been waiting a good while, watching expectantly. He ventured: "Sir..."

"What is it?" Xie Erren's train of thought was broken; he was a bit annoyed.

"A messenger just came. Director Zhu requests that you come into the city immediately to meet with him—he has matters to discuss."

Zhu Quanxing was the newly minted Wuzhou Regional Garrison Commander, Xie Erren's working partner. If he had something to discuss, Xie Erren could hardly refuse. He set aside his ruminations on what orders to issue and quickly called out: "Into the city!"
