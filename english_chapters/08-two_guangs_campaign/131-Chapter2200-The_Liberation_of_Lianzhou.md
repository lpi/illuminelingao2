# Chapter 2200 - The Liberation of Lianzhou

Accompanying the word "starvation" was the phrase he had encountered countless times in his reading: "cannibalism."

Cui Shizhao had read many histories—accounts of sieges where loyal ministers and righteous defenders held out, their suffering described in just a few terse sentences that, once read, left no lasting impression. But the Sheyi Rebellion of recent years—when rebel forces had besieged Guiyang, the city held out for over a year, officials' daughters were seized by soldiers and eaten, and only "a little over two hundred" civilians survived—was something he had heard about from many lips.

If he wished to remain a loyal minister, there would be cannibalism. And even if he steeled himself for that, he might not get the chance.

When the Eight Pai Yao were besieging the city, he could still organize the garrison and able-bodied men for a sortie from Longjin Gate or Guangji Gate, then dispatch boats upstream to requisition grain from nearby villages. He had done so several times; though the Yao intercepted him each time, if he offered sufficient rewards and the soldiers were willing to risk their lives, the effort usually succeeded—at the cost of several dead.

But against the two small gunboats that patrolled day and night, such methods were useless. Even if the Australians left the landward side completely unguarded, those small boats could never slip past the Australian gunboats' blockade.

Cui Shizhao was paralyzed: to stake the city's lives on his posthumous reputation was beyond him; to surrender outright was equally beyond him. It seemed...

As he paced in his study, a servant came rushing in: "Disaster, Your Honor! Disaster!"

Cui Shizhao started: "Are the Hair-Clippers attacking?"

"No—boats have arrived at the north gate, and the Hair-Clippers are unloading sacks of rice, piling them below the walls. They say the rice is a gift for the city's people—but Your Honor must come out to receive it."

Cui Shizhao hurried up to the North Gate tower. Below the walls, baskets of rice were indeed stacked in rows—at least fifty *shi*, if not more. But soldiers of the Hair-Clippers stood guard on both sides.

Leaning over the parapet, Cui Shizhao called down: "This student is Cui Shizhao! What do you have to say? Speak quickly, and do not make any rash moves—the cannons and arrows on this wall do not have eyes!"

The Hair-Clipper leader raised a large speaking-trumpet and bellowed toward the tower: "Magistrate Cui, your reputation for loving the people like your own children and for your virtue is widely known. Our Great Song's Lianyang Commissioner for Pacification and Suppression, His Honor Huang, has long admired you. Hearing that the city is about to run out of grain, he has specially sent fifty *shi* of rice to assist. If Your Honor will open the gates and surrender at once, these fifty *shi* may relieve Lianzhou's emergency."

The garrison and militiamen on the walls stirred. For days, rations had been cut; many had not eaten their fill. Now, glistening white rice lay just below—and in ordinary times, they could have sallied forth to seize it. But they had all heard of the Hair-Clippers' "stout ships and sharp guns" and their ruthlessness. Hungry and weak, no one was willing to take the risk.

Cui Shizhao's heart churned like hot oil. If he had two hundred crack troops in fighting trim, a single charge could scatter these hundred-odd Hair-Clippers and bring the rice back to the city, buying more time. But all he had were a few hundred famished, exhausted soldiers and even less capable militiamen. To sally forth would be to throw their lives away.

The grain was right before his eyes—yet he dared not cross that threshold!

Seeing no response from above, the Hair-Clippers shouted again: "Magistrate Cui! Commissioner Huang says: open the gates and surrender, and the safety of the entire city is guaranteed, along with grain for relief! Ming officials, soldiers, and civilians who are willing to serve Great Song will be employed according to their abilities; those who are not will be given travel funds and allowed to leave."

From refugees who had slipped out of the city to forage, Huang Chao had learned that Lianzhou was nearly out of food. And so he had devised this stratagem.

Clearly, it was devastating to the city's morale. Cui Shizhao did not answer the shouts. He returned alone to the yamen, collapsing into his armchair. After a long while, he sent for Ma Tiyi and gave him instructions: "Brother Ma, please assemble the gentry and have them open the gates to negotiate. Tell them Lianzhou is willing to surrender—the officials and soldiers within will not obstruct them. But my wife and son... I entrust them to your care." With that, he swallowed a vial of his secret-formula Crane's Crest poison.

For one instant, Cui Shizhao believed he was dying. But through chaotic dreams and wracking pain, through repeated bouts of vomiting, he dimly sensed that he was still alive.

Suddenly he came to—lying on the bed in his chamber, his stomach still aching dully, his head swimming. His wife and children wept beside him; Ma Tiyi stood nearby, along with a young man with cropped hair. Seeing him awake, the young man said: "Prefect Cui, you are badly hurt. Please rest a while longer." Then Cui Shizhao drifted off again into murky sleep.

With Lianzhou secured, Huang Chao kept his promise and invited Yang Zeng to dinner. As a native of this region in the old timeline, Huang Chao had hoped to find the locally famous Dongbei cured meats to serve Yang Zeng. But when he sent someone to Dongbei Market, he discovered that Dongbei cured meats had not yet been invented.

None of the hometown snacks he had craved in the old timeline existed in 1635 Lianzhou. This left Huang Chao frustrated and annoyed. Once he calmed down, he realized that this timeline's Lianzhou was not truly his hometown—everything he longed for did not exist here.

Without Dongbei cured meats, the dinner still had to be held—he would simply cook a few home-style dishes. Though Huang Chao's culinary skills were nothing remarkable, he had some reputation for his home cooking. Before they had children, he and his wife had often hosted dinner parties at home, sometimes entertaining his naturalized subordinates.

Huang Chao had his people procure a two-*jin* pullet, a duck, and a slab of pork belly, along with a pile of vegetables and seasonings. This timeline's ingredients were pitifully scarce, and with hostilities just ended, the markets had not yet recovered. The orderly spent considerable time gathering everything.

Scallions and ginger simmered the chicken for *baiqie ji*—poached chicken; star anise, fennel, cassia bark, and bay leaves made a master stock for the braised duck; rock sugar and soy sauce braised the pork. He also found a jar of local yellow wine, prepared a dish of fried soybeans and pickled radish, and stir-fried a few vegetables. This was both a victory banquet and a farewell dinner. With Lianzhou taken, the Sui River Detachment's mission was complete. In a few days, Yang Zeng would lead the main force away to new operations.

Not only Yang Zeng came to dinner, but also several key officers and cadres. Whether staying or leaving, this was the first time in months they could sit down peacefully for a meal and a drink.

"Commander, once we withdraw, please be very careful," Yang Zeng said. "The Yao are fickle in their allegiances. This time we've suppressed them, but we haven't rooted them out entirely. They could easily be incited again..."

With the main force gone, Huang Chao would have only two infantry companies, one Li-Miao Mountain Company, and four National Army squadrons. Three of those squadrons would be garrisoning three cities; only the Wuzhou Squadron remained as a mobile reserve. The two regular infantry companies had been assigned primarily to guard against a surprise attack from the direction of Hezhou.

Yang Zeng's concerns were not unfounded. Though the Eight Pai Yao had been suppressed, minor disturbances throughout the Lianyang region had not been fully stamped out. Along the route of their march, chaotic conditions in each county had left a deep impression. The "official bandits" Xiong Wencan had stirred up, the "local bandits" hoping to profit from the turmoil—none of them cared about county boundaries and could sweep through at any moment. If they arrived and once again incited the Yao, the scale of the trouble would far exceed the present.

Huang Chao was well aware of this danger—in the old timeline, the expansion of the Eight Pai Yao Rebellion was linked to the merger of roving-bandit movements at the end of the Ming. But for Yang Zeng, a naturalized officer without "transmigrator precognition," to reach such conclusions was commendable.

He nodded. "I understand what you're saying. The Lianyang region's problems are not isolated—they're part of a larger chess game across northern Guangdong. Both military and political efforts are needed. So I have no objections to Old Zhu pulling you out. Keeping you here is a stabilizing anchor for Lianyang, but for the overall campaign it does no good."

This was half-true. Huang Chao knew why Zhu Mingxia was recalling Yang Zeng: the Southern China Army had to maintain a substantial mobile reserve at all times. But who wouldn't want "the more crack troops, the better"—especially in a perilous place like this? He simply did not wish to appear weak in front of naturalized personnel, and he wanted to demonstrate his "big picture thinking."

Being an Elder is exhausting, Huang Chao grumbled to himself.

Yang Zeng, oblivious, was moved: "Commander, you see the whole picture." He added worriedly: "But if something happens..."

"If something happens, don't we have the radio? One telegram and you'll come running! That's our advantage."

"Indeed, Commander!"

Fu De'an said: "Without the main force, we do feel a bit uneasy. But the Council of Elders excels at mobilizing the masses. Give the Commander a few months, and he may have raised several battalions!"

Huang Chao knew Fu De'an was flattering him, but his words captured the essence of governing here: relying on superior firepower could only maintain order for a time—he needed the people's support!

"You're right, Old Fu. You're about to become county magistrate here. Remember: winning the people's hearts is your first priority. Not just the Han commoners—but the Yao in those *pai* too. They are also subjects of the Council of Elders. We need them not only to fear us, but to submit, and ultimately to love us. That's not easy; it will take time..."

"I shall remember the Commander's teachings!" Fu De'an nodded repeatedly. "With you here to guide me, I fear nothing—I'll do a good job."

Looking at his ardently trusting gaze, Huang Chao felt a pang of doubt—would the methods he had used in Hainan to pacify the Li really work here?

He suppressed his unease and smiled. "Come, let's drink. To the liberation of Lianzhou!"
