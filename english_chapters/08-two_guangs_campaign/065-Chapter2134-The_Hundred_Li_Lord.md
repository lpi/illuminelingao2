# Chapter 2134 - The Hundred-Li Lord

If scattered corpses were left unburied, they would trigger a plague. Scattered weapons were also a potential threat. After the Battle of Wuzhou, officers and soldiers abandoned a large number of weapons, armor, and firearms inside and outside the city, visible almost everywhere. With a large amount of military equipment scattered about, there was a potential threat to the new government. They had to be confiscated as quickly as possible. Additionally, his currently weak military force urgently needed some supplementation. Zhu Quanxing's single battalion had to manage the security work of several counties in Wuzhou Prefecture, making it difficult to cover everything.

The final agenda item was repairing the city walls and some infrastructure inside and outside the city. The Battle of Wuzhou actually didn't see fierce fighting, but both sides invested heavily in firepower. Specifically, the Army's artillery and the Navy detachment almost treated the Wuzhou battlefield as live-fire training, pouring a large number of shells inside and outside Wuzhou city, severely damaging Wuzhou's city defense facilities. Now, all of it had to be restored.

In addition, there were two important transportation hubs outside Wuzhou city. One was the Gui River Pontoon Bridge spaning the Gui River and leading to the Sanhezui Grand Drill Ground; the other was the Canglong Pontoon Bridge spaning the West River. These two pontoon bridges connected the east, west, and south banks of Wuzhou, making internal and external transportation very convenient.

Now both pontoon bridges had been destroyed in the siege, cutting off traffic and making travel inconvenient everywhere.

Xie Erren made a rough calculation. Not counting the sewage system he planned, just the restoration projects would keep him busy for half a year. As for the money and grain spent, that went without saying—this "Grand Rehabilitation Fundraising" alone couldn't cope with it.

***

After the Rehabilitation Bureau meeting, Xie Erren convened a meeting of naturalized cadres.

The number of naturalized cadres in Wuzhou was extremely small. Aside from his right-hand man, City Office Secretary Zhao Fengtian, and the 7th Company Commander of the 3rd Line Infantry Battalion, Qian Duo—one civil and one military—there were no more than twenty naturalized cadres. Most of these cadres were hastily promoted and trained from among naturalized citizens in the Senate's ruled areas. Most were from Guangdong, with some from Shandong and Hainan. After being incorporated into the Qiongya Detachment and undergoing specialized training, they could at least communicate in Cantonese.

Now these people gathered together, awaiting Xie Erren's "instructions."

Looking at this group of naturalized cadres—old and young, men and women—Xie Erren felt a bit unconfident. He more or less knew the quality of these northbound cadres: most came from being grassroots rural cadres, and only a very small number were deployed from administrative departments or were veterans.

Xie Erren had absolutely no bottom line on how competent these cadres were. But right now, there were no people more usable or reliable than them.

"Comrades!" He cleared his throat. "Wuzhou has been liberated—this is all to the credit of our heroic officers and soldiers of the Fubo Army's Army and Navy. We, as the first batch of cadres to take over Wuzhou, entered the city relying on the Fubo Army's guns. This isn't rare: the key is not just getting in, but also staying put."

After saying this, Xie Erren suddenly felt he had some confidence.

"Before coming here, everyone read the booklet 'Overview of Wuzhou' compiled by the External Intelligence Bureau. It lists detailed social and civil conditions of Wuzhou Prefecture City and the surrounding areas. This will be our important reference book for carrying out work in the future. I hope everyone will read it more when unoccupied—one can only carry out work by grasping the specific situation."

Next, he assigned several things to be done immediately. Once cities in the Pearl River Delta like Guangzhou were liberated, the primary work of the taking-over Senators and naturalized local chief officials was regime-building work like checking household registration and establishing industrial and commercial registration data. But Wuzhou's situation was different—Wuzhou was a "frontline city," and safety was the number one priority. So the work he assigned also revolved around the issue of "safety."

The specific work was roughly the same as what was just handed over to the Rehabilitation Bureau. Xie Erren distributed the work of each responsibility zone to naturalized cadres, requiring them to supervise and urge the relevant work of the Rehabilitation Bureau at all times. He also designated several cadres to specifically lead labor teams in carrying out corpse and rubble removal work.

Because the National Army allocated to Wuzhou hadn't arrived yet, and Xie Erren was eager to expand his military force, he decided to select seasoned and reliable men from the surrendered local Wei-Suo soldiers to form a militia team, led by Fubo Army soldiers.

His plan was to allocate a platoon from Qian Duo's company, with one soldier leading ten militiamen, to form a three-hundred-person militia team. The remaining regular troops would not move, serving as a mobile force.

"...Do you see any difficulty with this?" Xie Erren asked Qian Duo.

"There's no difficulty. It's just that soldiers use rifles, while militiamen don't have rifles and can only use spears and broadswords—if we have to fight, it equals us losing the firepower of thirty rifles."

Thirty soldiers dispersed among three hundred militiamen to serve as commanders prevented them from concentrating fire as a platoon. This loss was a bit significant. After all, there were only one hundred guns in Wuzhou city.

"The militia team can be equipped with some bows and arrows and old-style firearms. At least we gain three hundred people."

The 7th Company only had a hundred people, which was obviously insufficient for the defense and alert of the entire Wuzhou city, so he didn't express further objection. After all, it was unknown when the National Army would arrive, and even if they came, there would only be one squadron.

In order to further substantiate the military force in his hand, Xie Erren decided to take over all the three classes of yamen runners from the original Wuzhou Prefectural and County Yamens. Although the duties of the Lictors (*Zao*), Fast Constables (*Kuai*), and Strongmen (*Zhuang*) differed, they were generally inclined towards public security work. Although these people were not very suitable, they were at least familiar with the local situation and could cope with the immediate security work for now.

After implementing various miscellaneous details one by one, finally, Xie Erren instructed Zhao Fengtian: Immediately pull together a propaganda team.

Xie Erren himself was from a journalist background; he was most familiar with and valued propaganda work the most.

"Chief! This propaganda team matter isn't urgent, right?" Zhao Fengtian said, "The surrendered officials of this county are waiting outside to see you. It's been half a day."

"Since they've already surrendered, what's the rush? Just give them a position to draw a salary." Xie Erren was quite impatient. He took a few pages of paper from his briefcase. "This is a plan I wrote. You need to implement the personnel and required equipment as soon as possible."

Zhao Fengtian took it and looked; this plan was truly detailed! Organizational structure, number of personnel, how many men and women, what skill requirements—everything was there. It even listed clear details down to brooms and lime buckets for painting slogans, and coarse paper, brushes, and ink for writing slogans. *The Chief really made a good plan!*

But looking again, some requirements inside were hard to handle because it involved a "Culture and Propaganda Team."

Zhao Fengtian knew what a Culture and Propaganda Team was; it was nothing more than organizing a group of men and women who could play instruments, sing, and dance to go around performing or acting out "living newspaper" plays to preach policies—this was a very common form of propaganda in Hainan. Every county had a Culture and Propaganda Team. They had only been in Wuzhou for a few days; where could they find these "professionals" who could play, sing, and dance? Besides, it was hard to say if people were willing to "propagandize."

Finally, there was a "coverage target." Looking down, there were short-term targets—within seven days; medium-term targets within fifteen days; and long-term targets within thirty days. Divided into three stages, specific slogan coverage rates had to be reached, the number of Propaganda Team lectures had to reach a certain number, and the number of attendees had to reach a certain number...

He murmured, "Chief! These things aren't hard, but they aren't urgent tasks, especially this propaganda team..."

"For the propaganda team, just find a few more literate ones from the refugees. Anyway, it's just writing characters," Xie Erren said. He felt that Zhao Fengtian didn't have a deep enough understanding of the significance of propaganda work, and said earnestly, "Propaganda work is the focus of our civil affairs work. Don't look at it and feel it's just wielding a pen with no output. The local people of Wuzhou mostly only know the name of our Senate and Australia but not the details. Some probably even think we are pirates coming ashore to rob, which is very unfavorable for us to carry out work and gives the Puppet Ming voids to smear us. Besides, after entering the city, we have a series of administrative measures that need to be widely advertised so that the masses all know..."

Zhao Fengtian nodded repeatedly, expressing that the Chief had foresight and a comprehensive view. He would definitely handle it well. However, he still reminded the Chief that the "surrendered people" outside were still waiting.

"Then tell them all to come in." Xie Erren was in a good mood and said.

Since the Prefect and Magistrate had both committed suicide, there were no officials with particularly high "gold content" among the "surrendered people" of Wuzhou. Most were figures at the level of clerks and headmen of the local yamen; the highest was just an academic official like an instructor or disciplinarian. Xie Erren had been in meetings for too long and had no interest in talking much with them. He perfunctorily said a few sentences, told them to "handle errands earnestly," and dismissed them.

As the meeting dispersed, he suddenly remembered something and instructed Zhao Fengtian: "Tomorrow, find someone very familiar with the local situation from anywhere to be a guide. I want to inspect this Wuzhou City."

"Understood, Chief!" Zhao Fengtian said. "The candidate is ready-made; I'll arrange it right away!"

After receiving the "surrendered people," it was near dusk. Xie Erren rested in the Prefectural Yamen that night. Bright kerosene lamps were lit in the rear yamen, and tables and chairs were set up. Because this was the first time in many days that he had lived properly in a house, Xie Erren's life secretary was particularly fawning, and dinner was very sumptuous.

Wuzhou was a commercial port of the Two Guangs, with thriving commerce and great attention paid to food and clothing. Although it was the Great Ming era now, and many famous dishes of later Wuzhou hadn't come out yet—like Paper-Wrapped Chicken and Crisp-Skin Dog—some famous local products already existed. The Prefectural Yamen naturally had stocks. Because the life secretary knew he hadn't eaten a proper meal for a long time, she cooked carefully: Wuzhou Paper-Wrapped Chicken used local Three-Yellow Chicken, with a fresh and mellow taste; the rice was cooked with Mengshan Oil-Sticky Rice. Only fresh vegetables were hard to find due to the war, so a few vegetable dishes were barely cobbled together.

Since landing in Guangdong, Xie Erren basically hadn't had a good meal. This time counted as gorging himself. Seeing the beauty snuggling beside him, and thinking that he was also a "Hundred-Li Lord" (County Magistrate/Prefect) now, he unconsciously felt the satisfaction that "a real man should live like this."
