# Chapter 2306 - Luo Yangming and Wen Tietou

Luo Yangming was not worried about that. He understood the situation very clearly: the Ming army was too busy looking after itself to even hold Guangxi, let alone launch a counterattack on Wuzhou. At most, this was a harassment raid.

However, judging by the situation, the scale of the enemy's harassment was not small. The commotion was too great to be just a small group of enemies. Although Luo Yangming trusted that Qian Duo and Zhao Fengtian could control the situation, it was a fact that Wuzhou's defenses were empty. Listening to the cannon fire and footsteps outside, which showed no signs of thinning out but rather became denser, Luo Yangming began to lose his composure.

Suddenly, a rapid drumbeat spread throughout the city. Luo Yangming was shocked: this was the signal for a Level One Alert, declaring that enemies were inside the city.

Has the enemy already breached the city? He was a bit nervous, but upon second thought, it seemed unlikely. Wuzhou's walls were heavily defended; without absolute superiority, the Ming army would not rashly attack the city at night. Moreover, according to reconnaissance reports, there were no large enemy groups within a hundred *li* of Wuzhou. It was impossible for small groups to merge instantly overnight.

He immediately thought of Hao Ran's case. Could it be...

Could it be that they were plotting an internal uprising within the city?!

He had actually considered this thought just now when he went to see Zhao Fengtian to discuss the case. Now it seemed his prediction was completely accurate! This Hao Ran was the key figure!

Why hadn't he noticed him earlier! Luo Yangming felt a pang of regret: he had poured too much energy into the Rehabilitation Bureau's work and neglected the most important job of a "Hidden Cadre"—counter-espionage. He had allowed this Advisor Hao to operate freely right under his nose; to a certain extent, he had even acted as his protective umbrella!

Thinking of this, Luo Yangming could no longer sit still. He stood up with a *whoosh*, called Li Wensheng over, and instructed, "The situation outside is urgent. I need to go out to handle some important matters. You stay home and lead the servants and staff to keep watch. Pick two capable assistants to follow me."

Hearing this, the room instantly turned into a chaotic pot of porridge. Neither Li Wensheng nor Ding Atao agreed to let him go out. Ding Atao was weeping: with the chaos of soldiers outside, if something happened to him, what would become of this large family and the business?

Luo Yangming was annoyed by the noise. Just as he was about to comfort them, a shop assistant came in to report: Master Zhao of the Australians had sent someone to deliver a letter to the Master.

"Bring the letter!"

Luo Yangming hurriedly took the letter. Opening it, he saw only a few lines. Yet these few lines changed his expression drastically. Xie Erren was missing and possibly captured! This news was like a bolt from the blue.

In the eyes of an old naturalized citizen like Luo Yangming, a Senator was a "demigod," an omnipotent existence. Even if he privately disagreed with many measures in Wuzhou City, he had become accustomed to the Senate's meticulousness and their habit of having backup plans everywhere. He always felt that no matter what the Senators did, they had a "divine plan," even if he couldn't comprehend it at the moment. He never expected a Senator could be captured!

The letter mentioned that Wuzhou was not in danger at the moment and that a major search was underway in the city. It asked him to rush to the Prefectural Yamen to discuss countermeasures once the situation outside had settled.

Receiving this letter, how could Luo Yangming sit still? He comforted his wife and children with a few words, then wrote a letter and ordered someone to deliver it immediately to Zhao Fengtian at the Prefectural Yamen. He also asked Ah Chun to take out a large bundle that was always kept in the account room's silver cabinet. Then, taking two sturdy young assistants, he quietly slipped out the back door and headed for the South Gate.

He was not in a hurry to go to the Prefectural Yamen—Zhao Fengtian was already presiding there, and his going wouldn't help much. As for interrogating suspects and chasing escaped fish, that was for later. The most urgent matter right now was to restore order in the city and find a way to rescue Chief Xie—or, in the worst case, find his corpse. Specifically, his head could not be taken away by the government troops.

Luo Yangming was very clear about the military strength in the city: in these most empty months, the men Qian Duo and Zhu Si had on hand were not even enough to control the street intersections and patrol the walls, let alone search. Although Wuzhou's walls were high, it was not difficult for small groups of enemies to climb over them under the cover of night.

The urgent task was to increase the manpower for the search and suppression within the city as soon as possible!

He looked down on the Detective Team, a mixed bag of dragons and snakes. Firstly, most of them were just looking for a meal; showing up to make up the numbers was good enough for them, they wouldn't exert real effort. Secondly, it was hard to guarantee there weren't insiders mixed in. In a complex situation, they couldn't be relied upon.

After thinking it over, only the dock porters under his "brother-in-law" Wen Tietou were reliable. A gang boss like Wen Tietou had a strong bond of dependency with his porters, and they dared to fight and kill—without these two traits, one couldn't stand firm in a major port like Wuzhou.

However, Xie Erren had always been very wary of Wen Tietou and his porters, placing many restrictions on them. Luo Yangming didn't find this strange: the existence of such an organized and combat-capable group in Wuzhou City was obviously a potential threat to local administration. The Ming dynasty's Wuzhou Prefect saw it this way, and the Senate's Wuzhou Director saw it the same way.

If Wen Tietou didn't have this layer of relationship by marriage, Luo Yangming actually wouldn't trust such a local snake either. But having associated with Wen Tietou for many years, he knew his background and character. He knew this man had a strong gangster air but was essentially upright in nature. Moreover, his only kin was in Luo's hands.

Now, he could only rely on him!

Luo Yangming headed all the way to the South Gate. He encountered patrol teams several times along the way. With the highest-level pass issued to him by Zhao Fengtian, he passed through with just a few words each time. There were no delays on the road, and he soon arrived at the Great South Gate.

Because goods had to be moved early the next morning, Wen Tietou had gathered more than two hundred porters under him to stay temporarily in a dozen empty shops outside the gate enclosure of the Great South Gate. With the sound of gunfire and cannons filling the sky, he and his men were all awake. Not daring to go out, they gathered at the door, looking out and discussing.

Seeing Luo Yangming arrive, Wen Tietou hurriedly welcomed him: "Master! What is going on? Have the Great Ming government troops fought their way back?"

Luo Yangming was out of breath from walking. He couldn't speak for a moment. After panting for a while, he said, "The government troops haven't come, but spies in the city are taking the opportunity to cause trouble. I have use for you and your brothers now..."

"What are you saying?" Wen Tietou patted his chest. "You are my brother-in-law! You've been helping everyone all these years. I, Wen Tietou, am a good man whose arm can run horses and whose fist can stand people! Just say it, whatever you need our brothers to do, up a mountain of knives or down a sea of fire, we won't decline!"

Luo Yangming immediately explained that he needed them to arm themselves and participate in the Great City Search, specifically mentioning that the internal traitors had abducted a "VIP" of the local administration and they needed to find a way to rescue him as soon as possible. Wen Tietou frowned upon hearing this: "Master! We have no objections to doing work for you. But this is a matter for the Detective Team and the National Army. If we intervene, what will they think? If there is a misunderstanding, failing to catch the Ming spies is a small matter, but if we clash and kill each other, wouldn't that be a huge disaster? Besides, we don't have weapons."

"I have already communicated with the City Government about your deployment; it won't be a problem. As for identification, I've thought of that too." With that, he instructed the assistant to open the large bundle. Inside was a pile of blue cloth armbands with a red star-and-fist symbol—the same kind worn by the Detective Team.

"These were prepared when Wuzhou was recovered. They are the same as what the Detective Team wears. Put them on, and you won't cause misunderstandings when meeting patrols. As for weapons, each of you has a carrying pole; use that," he said. "These are all your good brothers who handle life and death with you. I won't say more unnecessary words. If you can rescue the captive, the Chief will surely reward you heavily!"

Wen Tietou knew that this "brother-in-law" held high power and position in the Rehabilitation Bureau and was a trusted aide of the Australians. Usually, whether doing business or handling affairs, he placed extreme importance on credit and never went back on his word. Naturally, he wouldn't haggle. He immediately called over his subordinate foremen and explained the situation. Hearing they were going to rescue a naturalized cadre and there would be heavy rewards, everyone rubbed their fists and wiped their palms, put on armbands one after another, picked up their carrying poles, and prepared to surge onto the streets.

Wen Tietou waved his hand to stop them and asked Luo Yangming, "Master! Wuzhou isn't a small place. We can't just grope around blindly in the streets and alleys. Isn't that looking for a needle in a haystack? We need a destination!"

This question was reasonable, but Luo Yangming knew the implications were significant. He pondered for a moment, then suddenly remembered something and asked, "I remember your men often smuggle goods into the city from outside to avoid taxes. What method do you use?"

Wen Tietou laughed, "You know about that too! what other method could there be? We aren't Earth Traveler Sun who can burrow underground, nor Sun Wukong who can ride clouds. We just carry the stuff and climb over the city walls."

"Without ladders?"

"Of course not. Just grip the cracks in the bricks, use hands and feet together, and you can climb up. If there's someone on the wall to receive you and lower a rope or bamboo pole to grab, it's even faster."

"Then tell me, if the enemy wants to escape over the wall with a captive, where might they go? How would they go?"

Wen Tietou knew there was more to this question. He didn't dare answer lightly. After thinking for a moment, he said, "As for right now, the south is definitely out; both the Great and Small South Gates have heavy troops. Sanhezu is making a ruckus, and everyone is staring there—if I were them, I would inevitably choose the Great Cloud Gate in the north!"

Luo Yangming calculated secretly. The Great Cloud Gate area was the most secluded, and the city walls there were damaged the most severely. If the enemy wanted to climb the wall, that was the easiest place. The key was that the defenses around the Great Cloud Gate were also the weakest, completely insufficient to maintain a continuous sentry line on the wall...

"Good!" He nodded. Indeed, this was the most likely route.

"Also," Wen Tietou said, "I wouldn't take a captive through the main streets. I'd go through the alleys at the base of the city wall. Those alleys are mostly the back walls of people's houses, very secluded and desolate. The sentries on the wall can't see clearly in the dark..."

"You're right!" Luo Yangming patted Wen Tietou's shoulder excitedly. "Let's go!"
