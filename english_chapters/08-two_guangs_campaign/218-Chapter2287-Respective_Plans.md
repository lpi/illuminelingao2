# Chapter 2287: Respective Plans

Luo Yangming was busy until people leaning horses turning over; hard easily handled this grain purchasing matter properly. Also no time to pay attention to external check anymore. until various affairs handled finished, only waiting for grain arriving. He then breathed a sigh of relief, went to City Government to ask Zhao Fengtian if there was reply coming back.

"No reply letter." Zhao Fengtian checked incoming mail record said.

"This front and back already half a month..."

"Hard to say ah," Zhao Fengtian said, "Teng County side our regime organization just established; people few matters many. The person you want to check although has specific name address, yet not in Teng County city. At this juncture still have to dispatch people to countryside to query specially; military chaos horse confusion can't be fast."

"Then wait more." Luo Yangming thought he usually observing Yi Haoran coldly had no suspicious things either. Either teaching children reading in room, or amusing self with poetry and books; from time to time going to dock helping Wen Iron Head calculate accounts. Even if he was Ming Kingdom remnant evil, couldn't stir up how big wind and waves either.

"This matter not anxious; at worst after finishing matters arrest person letting you interrogate personally," Zhao Fengtian picked up an official document, "This is notice list Joint Logistics sent us; Dachang’s grain starts shipping tomorrow; expected to arrive Wuzhou on August 5th. Want us to prepare for receiving goods."

"So fast? Our silver just sent..." Luo Yangming somewhat surprised.

"This is policy nature grain transfer," Zhao Fengtian said, "Even if Wuzhou didn't send one tael silver over would ship too. But words said so, now High Level is also very difficult..."

Zhao Fengtian’s eyes red; since he became this City Government Secretary, worked until late night every day, sometimes even working overnight—administrative work too much.

"High Level difficult, we also difficult." Luo Yangming sighed, "Although is good thing, not long term plan either. This situation don't know when can turn better; I feel recently Aftermath Bureau many things doing became not as easy as before."

"Old Moneybags all unreliable." Zhao Fengtian extremely exhausted, "Happened now still have to rely on Old Moneybags to maintain situation. Who teaches us poor? Wait autumn grain comes up, hand has money and grain situation can look better."

"If can fight a few big victories again can cut off this gang of people’s longing."

"Fighting victory easy, just troops eating wearing hard to handle." Zhao Fengtian suppressed voice said, "Now front line hardest is supply; otherwise, Guangxi would have finished earlier. More walking towards Guangxi, boats used smaller, transport more strenuous. Guangxi’s Lang people, Yao people also don't stop; troops are walking one road fighting one road, also have to expand army on spot. Victories fought not few, consumption also shockingly big..."

"You look, to year end can this war finish?"

"Year end always should be about there; I looking at reports coming from North Guangdong side, Senator Huang side progress counts smooth; situation turned better; passing some days probably can settle down..."

"Right now people heart thinks settling; as long as not fighting, Two Guangs side once circulating, market recover. Common people’s days become better; our work also easy to develop..."

"Ten thousand matters beginning hard; back then I followed Chief to South Qiong opening New Area was even harder—no road on land, all relied on sea ship transport supply; coming once a month; county city even smaller than Guangdong’s village, also broken and rotten..."

Zhao Fengtian qualification old; words said many unavoidably would brag his "Glorious History." Luo Yangming naturally also could only wash ears respectfully listen.

"...No matter how difficult situation later also overcame; having Chief, Senate here, need fear nothing." Zhao Fengtian said full of confidence.

Luo Yangming spoken by him, emotion originally more or less having some anxiety dissipated clean. Thinking ten thousand *dan* grain coming; to market and people heart would have huge stabilizing effect; mood couldn't help relaxed much.

"...We better talk about security work." Zhao Fengtian took out a document, "This is grain security plan Qian Duo drafted. You look first."

"I look this not appropriate right." Luo Yangming uneasy said.

"According to duty indeed not appropriate, but you are local person. Familiar than all of us. Maybe have some loopholes..."

Words said to this extent, Luo Yangming also inconvenient to decline; took over flipping reading. According to current relay escort mode, Wuzhou Battalion 1st Squadron responsible for river surface patrol work would arrive Fengchuan County one day in advance waiting for boat fleet arrival; second day dawn escorted by 1st Squadron and Navy of Inland River Fleet boat fleet arrive Wuzhou.

After arriving Wuzhou, 1st Squadron responsible for dock alert; Line Infantry Company one platoon responsible for route alert entering city; other two platoons stay in city holding city key point alert work. 3rd Squadron stationed in Sanheui also had to prepare for battle, reinforcing dock anytime.

At that time Wuzhou would assume full martial law; common people not allowed on street; various city gates closed; only opening Nanxun Gate and Dezheng Gate near unloading dock.

"This way counts ten thousand without one loss." Beihua Yangming laid after reading said, "Just moving 1st Squadron away one day in advance, this city becomes empty."

"Company Commander Qian said problem not big; at worst closing city gate is fine. Moreover we have 3rd Squadron outside city can echo. Emergency situation let them come aid is fine." Zhao Fengtian didn't mind, "Recently Wuzhou surroundings also no big group bandits or Ming Army activity signs."

"Then no problem."

"I then send document to Director Xie place, asking him to circle read." Saying he put document in envelope, stamped seal wax, giving communicator, "Send to Chief Xie office immediately!"

"Chief today not in office, working at Three Headquarters side..." Communicator said, "He said not emergency document send over together after lunch."

Zhao Fengtian slightly frowned; Luo Yangming knew, this was worry and aversion to Chief Xie "Indulging Female Sex." But naturalized citizen cadres generally wouldn't express this emotion publicly or discuss with each other. To them, absolute trust and respect to Chief were already engraved in their bone marrow.

"Okay, you send together at noon." Zhao Fengtian said.

Night color shrouded group mountains; stars blinking cold light. Flowing clouds in sky blocked moon light from time to time. Deep mountain inside even dimmer. Mountain forest inside quiet.

Although mountain high forest dense, human track rare to reach, this place distance Wuzhou still less than ten *li*. Standing on mountain, could see Wuzhou’s city tower.

Inside mountain forest, a stream of bandits was gathering here, exactly Gou Second Master and Hu Rotten Eye’s bandit gang.

Gou Er wearing a tattered scholar robe, using rope binding waist, hanging a government soldier war saber. These years he always followed bandit gang living in caves, drilling forests. Original master appearance basically wore down completely; completely was appearance of a messy beard hair bandit chief.

He stared with cunning eyes, vigilantly observing surroundings. Group bandits one by one hair disheveled face dirty, face feature ferocious, carrying various weapons gathering around him in threes and twos.

Australians coming north created large quantity of scattered soldiers and wandering braves; war fire along road also made many common people displaced, life helpless, joining bandit rank. Original small bandit gang suddenly expanded to more than two hundred people—truth to tell, Gou Er himself didn't know specifically how many people under hand: died in battle, died of illness, fled people every three five days had; but also continuously people joining. Rather than saying for making fortune, better saying purely for mixing a mouthful rice to eat.

But this mouthful rice also wasn't easy to eat; following Australian security strength continuously increasing and fully pushing various villages joint security measures, bandit’s maneuvering room more and more small; and they also faced Fubo Army’s continuous crusade. Fortunately Gou Er and Hu Rotten Eye back then were people eaten Fubo Army loss; more or less had some coping methods; considered not caught. Called one of countless bandit gangs whirling rising whirling extinguishing.

Earlier when Xiong Wencan sent people to Guangdong distributing various appointment certificates in large quantity, Gou Er and Hu Rotten Eye also each got one, counted as "Court Appointed Officer"; but time long they knew, this stuff useless not to say, also big tree attracting wind—Fubo Army specially picked bandit gangs raising government army big flag to fight.

A figure walked over, whispered a few words with him; Gou Er nodded, waved hand summoning everyone over, said: "Brothers! Chief Jiang came back from Wuzhou!"

Bandits had small commotion for a while. Although Jiang Suo joined gang time not long, but his matter leading Xiong Wencan’s house servants fighting Hair thieves bravely at Bangshan everyone knew more or less—facing insufferably arrogant Hair thieves not only dared fight, also could fight a come and go. So once he joined gang became a chief; happened this young man not interested in being chief, only knew burying head exerting force fighting; when charging killing even fear not death; in bandit gang immediately had very high prestige.

Not long ago, Jiang Suo mysteriously disappeared; in bandit gang someone guessed if Gou Er and Hu Rotten Eye couldn't tolerate him, driving him away or assassinated.

"Chief Jiang this time going out, was contacting with Court people. We brothers want to do a big business in Wuzhou! This business done, reward silver can't lack; playing well, can even gamble a proper future on body!"

He complacently swept glance at group bandits; these bandits mostly were government army soldier scoundrels. Used to eating grain, loving leisure hating labor; regarding future, reward silver these looked tighter than anything.

Hearing among bandits someone discussing in low voice, Gou Er knew his set played role; even more vigorously said: "This time Hair thief transported a huge batch of grain and pay silver from Guangzhou; let's go do him a fierce one; is a piece of Great Merit..."

This time, group bandits’ discussion wasn't so warm; instantly cooled down. Grain and silver all were good stuff; Hair thief needless to say would protect with heavy troops—these days bandit gangs attacking Hair thief boat fleet on West River were many; although had individual successful ones, majority were wasting human lives in vain only; half bit benefit couldn't fish either.

Gou Er hurriedly said: "Everyone rest assured! We going to do boat fleet is not fake, but threshold of promoting official getting rich isn't on boat—Since Australians want heavy troops escorting boats, Wuzhou city inevitably empty. We just take this opportunity, hit into Wuzhou!"
