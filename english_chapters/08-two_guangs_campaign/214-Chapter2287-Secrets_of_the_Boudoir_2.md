# Chapter 2287: Secrets of the Boudoir (2)

Currently driven by high prices, although no large bulk grain arrived from Guangxi, small amounts of grain from surrounding rural areas flowed into Wuzhou. Some small grain peddlers risked driving boats along various waterways branched from West River, going deep into rural areas to acquire grain. And Australians also encouraged landlords around Wuzhou to sell surplus grain in hands into Wuzhou. Merchants and landlords selling grain in Wuzhou, none didn't obtain heavy profit. Making Jiang Rongxian very jealous.

However he wasn't a grain merchant—since ancient times separating profession like separating mountain. Moreover situation outside, dared not throw self into this trading betting family property and life either.

While annoying, suddenly servant boy sent a lacquer box, reporting Aunt brought many "Australian Dim Sum" back; Mistress said invite Master to taste too.

"What dim sum, where can I eat down." Jiang Rongxian smiled bitterly, "Just put there."

Servant boy retreated out. Jiang Rongxian sat withered for half a moment, still had no plan. While helpless he subsequently opened lacquer box; inside surprisingly were several round flaky cakes; not only colors different, also emitting different aromas. This Australian really particular; transporting this from Guangzhou over thousands of *li* too!

Thinking here his heart moved: now only one able to get large bulk grain in Wuzhou city, wasn't it exactly Australian! Own family as long as able to hook up relationship with Australian, becoming "Imperial Merchant," wouldn't this wealth source roll coming?

Speaking of hooking up relationship, own family had uniquely endowed conditions! Thinking here, Jiang Rongxian immediately got spirit, getting up coming towards sister’s lodging.

"So say, your brother wants to do grain business?" Yi Haoran hearing this news, somewhat surprised, "Isn't your maiden family doing silk business? Knowing nothing about grain business ah."

"Exactly this reason!" Qiuchan had frowning brows not spreading, "He said I since good with Australian’s concubine, why not devise to blow pillow wind through Cai Lan, letting him mix a foot in too."

"Wanting to mix a foot isn't hard—always this Australian won't not sell this face; just your brother has no grain in hand, take what as capital?"

"He has silver, just nowhere to buy grain. So remembered Liheng is studying here, you old man's employer is..."

Yi Haoran suddenly realized; his employer Luo Yangming was not only grain merchant, also Aftermath Bureau Committee Member and member of Grain Guild. Although business not big, was one of real power figures in this Wuzhou city.

"I understood, he wants to get grain from my Employer."

"Exactly so." Qiuchan nodded, her face skin slightly red; she grew up in deep boudoir since childhood, never contacted such business trading; still had to look up begging people; if not herself living under other's fence, dared not oppose, beaten to death also unwilling to come lobby Yi Haoran.

"Slave Maid maiden family undergoing this difficulty, scene very difficult. Brother also has no method. Illness acute rushing to doctor randomly."

Yi Haoran’s brain turned flying fast; these days all busy planning riot plan, hadn't thought out suitable plan. Hearing Qiuchan’s request at this moment, involuntarily connected this matter to think a bit, seeing if there was opportunity to take advantage. He immediately said: "Since so, wait I inquire my Employer’s tone first, then give you an answer."

Sent away Jiang Qiuchan, Yi Haoran pondered for long time, didn't discover places utilizable; after all this was just a common routine utilizing skirt string to seek private profit; helping or not seemed to have no damage to Australian, nor would lure Xie Hair thief out for this.

He just thinking, suddenly A-Chun came out to call him: Shopkeeper Li invited him to go.

Yi Haoran dared not neglect, hurriedly went into accounting room.

"Mr. Hao, this time received a big business," Li Wensheng said, "Want to buy in a large batch of rice from Guangdong side. You just clear up accounts completely; able to collect try best to collect; in short prepare silver and copper cash properly."

"Silver I have account in heart, only more than three hundred taels, less than four hundred. Outside debts able to collect gathered almost done; remaining probably can't collect back in short time."

"Count how much have, try best more." Li Wensheng didn't mind.

Yi Haoran heart moved, remembering matter of Zhu Fuyuan of Dachang visiting not long ago; looks like, Australians wanted to sell grain to Wuzhou in large quantity! He deliberately said:

"These money can buy at most more than three hundred *dan* grain in Guangdong; if counting freight, only three hundred *dan*; count what big business."

"Our shop small capital tiny, can't do big business. Just count as taking lead managing." Li Wensheng spoke modestly, in language quite proud, "Grain Guild is raising this sum of money, probably needs ten thousand taels silver..."

"This money really not few!" Yi Haoran pretended surprise saying, "Pity, now Wuzhou not like past..."

"You say right," Li Wensheng didn't know he harbored ghost in heart, also followed sighing, "In past ten thousand silver, Grain Guild was a matter of one sentence; even small brand like us, anytime anywhere could take out several thousand taels silver! Now good, ten thousand taels silver, whole guild has to pool!"

"Current events different after all. I heard Wuzhou in past grain going to Guangdong every year had hundreds of thousands *dan*; now have to transport from Guangdong to here instead."

Li Wensheng twisted beard said: "Only beg war fires extinguish early, returning a peaceful world to common people! Now rice price soaring expensive; this batch of grain transferred coming, at least can solve burning eyebrow emergency."

Yi Haoran remembered Qiuchan’s entrustment, quick witted moved, pretended anxious saying:

"Just this silver money is problem ah."

"Employer these few days is just annoying for this matter."

"Shopkeeper, I actually have an idea..." Yi Haoran said.

"What idea?"

"Wuzhou city inside trading firms numerous; since Grain Guild can't take out this much silver, why not seek some other trading firms to enter shares? Isn't it just partnering to do a business." Yi Haoran said, "Now market not good, various brands all output no input. If able to insert a foot here, can also share some profit; isn't it everyone has benefit?"

"This is actually a method!" Li Wensheng said, "Evening Employer comes back, you speak with him!"

Luo Yangming came back in evening; since Zhu Fuyuan handed task of transferring grain to him, he had been running for this matter. Grain coming, various grain shops naturally happy. Although sales would have limited price, this batch of rice was official price only one tael two mace; getting in hand could earn big money.

But although various families extremely enthusiastic, yet encountered same problem: no money.

Grain shops were heaviest damaged among Wuzhou various trades; originally their capital mostly placed on grain. After war fire various families stock remained almost nothing. Capital loss all above seventy eighty percent. Even cargo payment less than thirteen thousand taels silver including freight, in past quite a few brands could take out anytime; now taking out one thousand taels silver felt difficult. Until now Guild only pooled eight thousand taels silver; still five thousand no matter what couldn't pool out.

If in peaceful season, various families always had houses lands to sell, could also borrow. Right now land houses no one asked; nor anyone willing to lend silver—how high interest given didn't have.

Of course, he could also propose letting Dachang advance part of payment temporarily, pay clear after selling rice. This counted as conventional practice too. But Luo Yangming knew currently Senate also difficult; this silver collected, turning hand had use.

Now hearing Yi Haoran propose this suggestion, Luo Yangming hesitated slightly.

Utilizing other trading firms' financial power, he hadn't not thought. But this after all was cross profession operation; since ancient times separating profession like separating mountain; whether other trading firms willing to take money out to participate he had no confidence; secondly doing so, inevitably must have considerable return regarding trend. Current situation military chaos horse confusion, who also unwilling to take silver out easily to do business. Must have excess profit.

Speaking of profit, now grain business profit was big enough; if no limit price, earning double profit was there. Happened original intention of grain business this time was stabilizing grain price. One *dan* grain at most could earn four five mace silver. To grain merchants maybe not few; to investors putting capital might be too low. Loan interest here in Wuzhou, annual interest before war reached sixty seventy percent; some usury annual interest reached two three times. Just this market price, now no one willing to lend.

"Your idea is actually not bad, but this rice grain is limited price; capital big profit small, also has risk. Other brands fear not necessarily willing..."

"Employer! You can't use past to look at now; even more can't use money dog’s appetite to measure shopkeepers of various brands." Yi Haoran said, "Now various families are all output no input; Guangxi pacification also don't know what day to end; various families have no business to do, silver put there can't give birth to small silver. If able to invite Prefect Xie to go out, summoning shopkeepers of various brands with official identity, stating transporting grain benefiting country benefiting people; everyone paying money raising capital; profit of selling everyone share; more or less always have some income, always better than them sitting eating mountain empty."

These words had reason and ground, making occasionally headache Luo Yangming nod repeatedly. Didn't expect this Advisor really had a set! He couldn't help paying attention to this half old man before eyes: this person although clothes old, a desolate appearance, speech and bearing completely different from ordinary advisors.

Although when Ding A-tao recommended him coming said was being private tutor in official family, but looking at his speech and behavior, probably also served as private staff (Makaku).

Luo Yangming heart born suspicion: this was sixth sense profession brought him. This Advisor Hao fear wasn't as simple as an ordinary private tutor. Although these days he kept duty in shop, didn't do any strange things, still had to pay attention to him one or two.

Although having suspicion, Luo Yangming didn't show on expression, only said: "You speak right, I tomorrow will go discuss with various Bureau Directors, advising Chief Xie together."

Luo Yangming returned to inner residence, then asked Ding A-tao about this Advisor Hao's origin again.

"His origin wasn't said to Master?" Ding A-tao strange said, "Is husband family relative of Ruijintang Silk Shop Jiang family on West Street, Teng County person. Being private tutor with official families outside. Now Two Kwangs war fire flourishing, dare not go home, wandering in Wuzhou."
