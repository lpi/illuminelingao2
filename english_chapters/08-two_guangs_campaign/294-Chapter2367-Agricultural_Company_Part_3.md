# Chapter 2367: Agricultural Company (Part 3)

"How much land does his family have now?"

"Estimated to be five or six thousand mu. Besides the land distributed to him at that time, later the municipal government opened up wasteland for cultivation, and he applied for new land deeds several times. At least three thousand mu or more. His family has always been the second largest in the local prominent households, so land is indispensable." Yuan Fei said.

Opening up and planting six thousand mu of land in a place like Sanya was indeed quite a lot. Xu Yanliang nodded secretly; this Hu Wumei was a management talent.

In fact, if Xu Yanliang cared more about the outside situation, he should have known that Hu Wumei had always been a typical "New Farmer" set up by the Senate. Not only had his relevant deeds appeared in "Lingao Times," but he had also participated in commendation meetings in Lingao and attended the representative meeting of the Hainan Provincial Consultative Council. He was a rising star.

In a short while, Hu Wumei had changed his clothes and came out from the inner residence.

He was wearing a semi-new short-sleeved shirt, linen trousers, and rattan sandals on his bare feet. He looked both solemn and simple. A fountain pen was inserted in his shirt pocket, and he wore a wristwatch on his wrist—this wristwatch was no small thing; it was a prize for him participating in the Senate's Agricultural Front Commendation Conference and obtaining the title of "New Era Agricultural Leader."

The whole outfit plus his hairstyle made him look very much like a "cadre" of the Senate. This was also the image he specially created for himself—unlike many members of the Consultative Council who more or less kept, or even deliberately kept, their past attire, Hu Wumei tried his best to wash away everything from the past.

He was originally supervising work in the newly opened coconut plantation today. The family sent a child to call him back, saying a Senator had arrived. At first, he was a bit puzzled. Because there was only one Senator, Mayor Tang, in the entire Sanya. And Mayor Tang just came to his farm a few days ago. He wouldn't come to his farm casually for no reason.

So it meant a new Senator had come. Hu Wumei began to calculate in his heart on the way back to the farm. He was an old timer who took root here since landing in Sanya. He had fully experienced Sanya from the initial hustle and bustle to the current loneliness. Since Senator Wang left office and Senator Tang took over, Sanya's development had become slower and slower, and could even be said to be stagnant. Accompanying this, there were fewer and fewer Senators in Sanya. The original Senators left office one after another, and almost no new Senators came to take office.

When he went to the Sanya Consultative Council meeting last Monday, Senator Tang did not mention that a new Senator was coming to take office. If it was a short-term business trip, the most likely one was a Senator from the agricultural sector—otherwise, he couldn't figure out why they would want to see him.

However, the child who delivered the message was too small and couldn't even say the Senator's surname, only knowing it was a "man" and "came by bike." This range was too large, covering almost more than 70% of the Senators.

Sure enough, he didn't know this Senator—obviously not from the agricultural sector, and he claimed to be "just transferred"—but Senator Tang hadn't said a new Senator was coming... Who exactly was this Senator who suddenly arrived, and what did he plan to do? Hu Wumei felt somewhat apprehensive in his heart.

However, there was one thing he could confirm: this Senator Xu was not an important figure in the Senate.

He changed his clothes and hurriedly came to the courtyard again to pay respects to Xu Yanliang.

"Hey, hey, you don't need to be so polite. I'm just walking by and casually looking." Seeing him so respectful and fearful, Xu Yanliang was a bit unaccustomed, "You are doing well here; Yuan Fei said you are also a model in the agricultural sector, a demonstration farm!"

"It's all the Senate's kindness; I'm just doing my meager bit." Hu Wumei said a few humble words.

Don't look at Hu Wumei appearing respectful and extremely fearful when seeing a Senator; in fact, he had seen many Senators and had been a guest of Wen Desi, Wang Luobin, Wu De, Wu Nanhai, and others. Mayor Tang Menglong's official residence was also open for him to visit at any time. He knew the hierarchy within the Senate very clearly. But he grasped one point in place, that is, when facing a Senator, he never revealed the slightest conceit, always wearing a "tears of gratitude" expression.

"...Ultimately, it's the Senate's policies that are good. Speaking of me, Hu Wumei, I was also a good hand at farming in my hometown. If not for the Ming Kingdom being too chaotic and pirates looting, I wouldn't have engaged in the pirate trade." Hu Wumei did not shy away from his history, "As long as the imperial court can ensure social peace, the common people will naturally be peaceful and happy. No matter how poor, they won't be driven to desperation; there will always be a glimmer of hope."

These words flattered the Senate without showing a trace. Everyone loves flattery, and Hu Wumei's flattery was much more subtle than praises like "recreating parents." Xu Yanliang was instantly "greatly pleased."

"You are right. A government should be able to do this!" Xu Yanliang said, "Your farm here—I see it's called Baocheng Company?"

"Exactly, Baocheng is the name of my former hometown village. Using it as a name counts as 'not forgetting one's roots.' Although I have taken root in Sanya and will spread branches and leaves in the future, I cannot forget where my own 'roots' are. As for registering a company, that was suggested by Chief Da Wan of the Tiandihui. He said my family business is big now, might as well register a company. It's convenient for diversified operations and applying for loans—no need to go through small farmer loans specially; I can apply for loans according to the qualifications of agricultural enterprises."

"Da Wan?"

"It's Senator Wan Lihui from the agricultural sector." Yuan Fei explained.

"Oh, it's him." Among the Wan brothers, Wan Lihui was the eldest, so naturally he was "Da Wan." From this description, this Farm Owner Hu's assets were indeed considerable.

"So you have opened quite a few factories." Xu Yanliang said, "Can you tell me in detail."

Hu Wumei's heart tightened; what kind of approach was this? But thinking again, the Senate knew his little assets clearly, so there was nothing to hide. Immediately, he put on a frank look and laughed: "Calling them factories is a bit too arrogant; they are just some small workshops."

It turned out that besides the mill, his farm also had several small factories such as a hemp rope factory, a coir mattress factory, and a preserved fruit factory.

"...And there is the newly opened aquatic product processing factory over at the port. Called a factory, it's actually just a few workshops. At minimum a dozen people, at most only thirty to fifty people. And it operates seasonally. This way workers have work to do all year round."

These were all agricultural product processing enterprises. Xu Yanliang was slightly disappointed. But thinking again, the Senate hadn't spread any decent light industry to Sanya either. It was considered good for a private enterprise like his to have this level.

"Who is responsible for technical guidance?"

"All hired through Tiandihui. Hu Wumei said, "Installing machines, debugging, production... one-stop service. No problems. It's just troublesome when machines break down. Repairmen have to be invited from Tiandu, and operations stop for several days once stopped."

"That must use a lot of workers. How many workers does the farm employ?"

"Not too many actually. Not counting Nanyang slaves, there are about two hundred male and female workers. Plus children and elderly, there are over three hundred people."

"What? You still use slaves here?"

"Of course use," Hu Wumei looked at Xu Yanliang somewhat strangely, "All large-scale farms here use them."

Xu Yanliang knew very little about the Senate's slave issue. He only knew that a large number of slaves were used when developing Tiandu and Kaohsiung. He didn't expect slave labor to have spread to the private sector.

"How many slaves?"

"About fifty. Originally there were more. Last year, female slaves were matched to workers. Considered as release from slave status."

"What work do you use so many slaves for?"

"They are used everywhere, farming, clearing wasteland, working in factories. To be honest, they are not very good at working and have poor physiques. Last winter digging drainage ditches, seven or eight died of exhaustion at once! A big loss!"

Xu Yanliang looked at his indifferent face and felt a chill in his heart: This is the "New National" we cultivated! However, he also understood that human nature is unreliable in the face of profit, not to mention that the person in front of him was once a pirate who killed without blinking.

"So the mortality rate is quite high."

"Higher than farm workers, but not that much higher." Hu Wumei said, "I bought them with money; I lose if they die. To be honest, if they weren't cheap enough, I really wouldn't be willing to use them..."

"Oh, why?"

"Physique is not good—I just said that; moreover, they are people with hands and feet, and were captured, so they are always dissatisfied in their hearts. Treat them too well, they slack off. Treat them harshly, they run away. Running away is one thing, but they gang up outside to rob, kill, and steal..."

"No wonder your place is heavily guarded."

"Dare not be unguarded. There was a riot here last summer." Hu Wumei seemed to still have lingering fears, "One or two hundred slaves from the mines killed the guards and ran out, robbing small farms in remote local areas all the way, killing and committing arson, expanding their team. Before long, it became three or four hundred people. By the time the garrison at Yulin Fortress wiped them out, they had already harmed dozens of households and killed over a hundred people..."

A shocked expression appeared on Xu Yanliang's face. He didn't remember this incident. He tried hard to recall for a long time before vaguely remembering seeing a few relevant news items in "Weekly News." But there were no specific details.

He asked Yuan Fei: "Are there many such incidents?"

Yuan Fei nodded: "There are quite a few sporadic incidents, but none had such a large scale. Thanks to the local militia, several large local farms served as shelters. Otherwise, the loss would have been greater. After this riot, all farms strengthened their precautions."

"So that's how it is." Xu Yanliang muttered to himself. Hearing these things shocked his heart greatly. He actually didn't agree with slavery much originally. Back then, he felt it was "tolerable" considering the loss of naturalized citizens in developing Tiandu and Kaohsiung was too great. But now it seemed that this system was not only quite cruel but its various negative impacts were also expanding.

It seems necessary to push for the abolition of slavery as soon as possible. He thought. Otherwise, continuing like this would cause endless trouble.

At this moment, he didn't delve deeper into this issue with Hu Wumei. He asked again: "Then is your labor force here sufficient?"
