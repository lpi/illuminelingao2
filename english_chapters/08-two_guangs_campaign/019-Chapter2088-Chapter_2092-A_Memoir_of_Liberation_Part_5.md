# Chapter 2088 - A Memoir of Liberation (Part 5)

"Quick march—Forward!"

At around ten in the morning, like thunder from a clear sky, a Fubo Army color guard divided into two columns. Led by a captain raising his command saber, shouldering Minié rifles, they marched at 170 paces per minute—like a dam cutting through water—parting the crowd packed along East Gate Avenue, clearing a path down the center. Some troublemakers in the crowd tried to jeer or shout insults, but a glance—intentional or not—from the wolf-like Fubo soldiers made them gape and forget what they'd meant to say. The noisy crowd fell deathly silent.

"Halt—!"

"Left face, Right face—!"

"Order—Arms!"

The captain gave continuous commands. The Fubo soldiers on both sides executed a crisp about-face and lowered their rifles in unison, butts striking the ground with a heavy thud.

Before long, faint sounds of bugles, fifes, and drums could be heard from outside the East Gate. The crowd stirred; people stood on tiptoe, craning necks over others' shoulders to see. A grenadier company in three columns, escorting a massive Star-Fist Red Banner, marched through the city gate to "The Grenadiers' March," stepping to the drumbeat—magnificent, dignified.

*My God—such soldiers!*

The crowd's agitation grew. Anyone accustomed to the slovenly, swaggering Ming troops, assuming all armies in the world were like that—who could fail to be awed by the Fubo Army? And these were elite among elites: the grenadiers—ever-advancing, tall and imposing, with combat prowess and bearing both superb!

These soldiers were tall, and with their peaked caps, they looked like giants. Their red uniforms were so splendid and neat—leather equipment belts, gleaming bayonets... I was instantly transfixed.

I, born a "soldier," surrounded by soldiers all my life, living among soldiers day after day—I'd never known a soldier, a military man, could cut such an imposing figure!

What had Uncle Jizai worn to war? A loose, one-size-fits-all "marching coat" that hung like a sack without a belt. Ill-fitting wasn't the worst of it—because officers skimmed off supplies, the coats were always tattered. Forget martial dignity; you couldn't even look like a proper human being. In ordinary people's eyes, soldiers were lumped together with hoodlums and bandits.

Just as we were immersed in wonder and awe, an Elder officer marching at the head—Major Zhu Quanxing, Third Battalion Commander, First Mixed Brigade, my future superior—seemed dissatisfied with the effect. As "The Grenadiers' March" struck up a second time, that storming drumroll making hearts tremble again, he frowned, quickened his steps, stepped out of formation, turned to face the column, and as the fifers finished one verse, waved his arm and shouted:

"All together now! There's one truth that needs no speaking—ready, sing!"

The soldiers' tense faces suddenly broke into smiles. The fifers and drummers happily struck up accompaniment, and the soldiers belted out:

*"There's one truth that needs no speaking—*  
*A soldier's place is on the battlefield...*"

The song spread like a torch touching a prairie, passing from front to rear by word of mouth, igniting an unstoppable wildfire that echoed through Zhaoqing's morning. The long gray dragon sang a stirring tune; every man held his head high with pride, chest thrust forward. Their medals glittered in the sunlight—illuminating a Zhaoqing that had been dark for thousands of years.

I was born into a military household. I'd seen soldiers before, heard them sing in unison. But those were "soldiers" in name only—thugs who could only bully civilians. And those were "songs" no one understood—the "Imperial Battle Hymn" they parroted mindlessly. But soldiers whose faces beamed with pride? Soldiers brimming with vitality? Soldiers overflowing with contempt for the enemy and confidence in themselves? Soldiers with such commanding presence—had I ever seen the like? The Ming military said "Good iron isn't made into nails; good men don't become soldiers." The Fubo Army said "Good steel must be forged into sharp swords; good soldiers must fight the hardest battles." The Ming military spoke of "earning fame with saber and spear, ennobling wife and children." The Fubo Army said "When the Council of Elders calls, we sing our battle song and march forward." The difference was night and day. I understood: this was an army that showed its might on the battlefield!

Children who loved excitement lost their initial fear. Exploiting their small size, they escaped adults' grasps, learned the soldiers' songs, and chased after the columns through gaps in the crowd. One boy of about seven—whether he lost his balance or was too excited—slipped past the color guard and bumped into a young soldier's leg. The soldier instinctively scooped up the child. This friendly action caused a stir in the crowd—everyone had believed the hateful Ming authorities' lies and thought the boy would be seized. The boy's grandfather wanted to rush in and retrieve the child but didn't dare; he stood behind the guards jumping up and down, weeping.

The young soldier saw the old man and understood what had happened. He ran out of formation, handed the child back to the grandfather, smiled shyly, patted the child's cheek, waved, and ran back to his place. This behavior, commonplace in the Fubo Army, caused even greater commotion among the onlookers. Even under the old Ming, bumping into a military formation meant at least a beating if you were lucky; with a bad-tempered officer, you might be killed on the spot with no avenue for justice! People whispered to each other, unable to believe what had just happened was real.

What happened next made everyone feel even more as if they were dreaming.

After the entry ceremony began, several women with baskets and large teapots came to distribute eggs and tea to the entering troops. But most of our soldiers politely declined. The very few who accepted eggs offered thanks in either fluent or halting Cantonese. Thirsty soldiers who took tea stood in place to drink, returned the bowls to the women, expressed thanks, then ran back to their units. Eventually the women stopped distributing eggs and, with the help of bystanders, simply pushed eggs into soldiers' pockets.

In my private-school days, I'd heard about so-called "Royal Armies" warmly welcomed by the people—folk carrying food in bamboo baskets and water in jugs to greet the "King's Troops." But had I ever seen a "Royal Army" that wouldn't even accept the people's food and water? Comrades, in those days, soldiers—whether distant Manchu troops or the nearby Ming army—what army didn't plunder civilians? Like our current enemies the Spanish and Dutch—all bandits preying on the people. We had a saying then: "Bandits pass like a comb; soldiers pass like a fine-toothed comb"—meaning bandits left something behind, but after Ming troops? Nothing remained. The Fubo Army—this army that didn't rob, didn't kill, treated people kindly, and wouldn't even accept their gifts—was something new. As Brother Hai put it: "I've lived this long and seen plenty of armies—what army doesn't plunder civilians? For this alone, the old court can never come back!"

After the Fubo Army liberated Zhaoqing, they imposed military governance. But for the people, apart from some grumbling about the Fubo Army's hygiene rules forbidding public urination and defecation, there was no inconvenience—in fact, city security improved. Fubo Army officers and soldiers traded fairly and spoke courteously; the Ming authorities' rumors collapsed of their own falsity. Children pinning colored trinkets to their chests as pretend medals and marching in formation behind patrolling Fubo soldiers became one of Zhaoqing's sights. The Fubo Army's catchy military songs became popular among the masses; everywhere one could hear "I Am a Soldier" and "There's One Truth That Needs No Speaking." Interestingly, these songs originally existed only in "New Speech" (Mandarin); somehow translations and adaptations emerged in Cantonese and local dialects. Once people understood the lyrics, their affection for our Fubo Army grew even stronger.

To be a soldier is to be a Fubo soldier! From that day, my conviction was firm. When the Fubo Army later recruited locally, I persuaded my parents, and together with Brother Hai, went to the barracks to enlist. When the recruiting officer asked my name, I told him: I am Liu Xing—"Xing" as in "awakening."
