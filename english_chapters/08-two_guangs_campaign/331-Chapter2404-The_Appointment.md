# Chapter 2404: The Appointment

However, this sum of money plus the odds and ends at home only amounted to a little over three hundred yuan. According to the market situation Zhang Yu had asked about, for a member of his level, he had to buy at least a 1000 yuan share of bonds to be justifiable.

Father Zhang showed a difficult expression: "But where can our family find another 700 yuan now? Your mother has some jewelry, but even if pawned, it would only be a dozen yuan. As for the few relatives at home, you know, they all rely on us now..."

Zhang Yu gritted his teeth and said: "Even without money, this opportunity cannot be missed. I think we should ask those old customers to see if they can pay back early. Even if we give them a discount, we need to get the money in hand ahead of time. If it's still not enough, I'll go borrow. Li Ziyu and Zeng Juan can also help me scrape together some."

Father Zhang pondered for a long time and said: "Giving a discount for early repayment is absolutely unacceptable. As for asking Ziyu and A'Juan, don't bother. Don't you know their family backgrounds clearly? The Li family originally had money, but his uncle's family met with disaster and the family was broken. Now he relies on a few dollars of soldier's pay to support the whole family; where would he have savings? Is A'Juan's family any better than ours used to be?"

"His family has a teahouse..."

"How much money can a teahouse save in a month?" Father Zhang said. "Besides, with the plague raging for half the year, it's good enough that the teahouse can maintain itself. You go ask him to borrow money—could he sell the teahouse to raise money for you? Even if he were willing, the teahouse isn't surnamed Zeng!"

Zhang Yu was stunned. Indeed, these two brothers of his simply couldn't take out that much money.

"Then... then where else can I go?" Zhang Yu pondered, and suddenly thought of Gao Ju.

"Official Gao has always been friendly with me; why not beg him!"

"Official Gao naturally has money, but once you ask him to borrow money, won't your bottom line be completely exposed?" Father Zhang said gloomily. "You must be careful."

"Most of the stewards in our factory were recommended by him. Doesn't he already know if there's any bottom line?" Zhang Yu didn't think much of it.

"Ting'er is your cousin. Only she and you are most clear about the money in and out of the factory and shop. Could Official Gao know?"

"So you mean..."

"I'm afraid that while you are single-mindedly thinking of buying bonds and following the Senate closely, will Official Gao have any schemes?"

"Dad, you must be joking. Would a merchant as big as him look upon this little property?" Zhang Yu said so with his mouth, but sweat began to appear on his forehead.

"Of course he doesn't look upon your little property, but your relationship with the Senate is extraordinary—everyone in Guangzhou city can see it, would Official Gao not see it? If you were gone, wouldn't it be better?"

Zhang Yu was a youth after all and hadn't experienced much of the world's evil. At this moment, being lightly tapped by his father, he couldn't help breaking into a cold sweat all over his body.

"...A'Yu, since ancient times, the heart to harm others must not exist, and Official Gao has helped us a great deal; we keep this in our hearts. But the heart to guard against others cannot be missing either—what if he has some thoughts?"

Zhang Yu said: "Dad is right!" What Dad said indeed made sense, sense over and over again, but the problem of money was still not resolved. He couldn't help frowning tightly. Father and son looked at each other in silence for a long time.

Zhang Yu's dad suddenly opened his mouth: "There is still one place to borrow now."

"Where?" Zhang Yu immediately spirited up.

"Senator Hong."

Zhang Yu was startled and hesitated: "I thought of this method too. In terms of financial power, Chief Hong naturally has no worries. But in the beginning, he told me not to find him unless there was a particularly urgent matter, and not to visit easily."

"Isn't this bond issuance a particularly urgent matter?" Zhang Yu's dad said. "Since this debt is as urgent as you say, going to see him to ask for an idea is most appropriate. Whether he helps or not, or how he helps, you must let him know about this!"

"But looking at Senator Hong's meaning usually, he seems unwilling for us to get too close." Zhang Yu was a bit hesitant.

"Zhang's *is* Hong's! Otherwise, he is neither kin nor old friend to us; why would he support you so much?! He says these things to you only because he doesn't want us acting under his banner in everything." Father Zhang said.

"Father's lesson is right!" Zhang Yu was suddenly enlightened. "I will go see Chief Hong right now!"

Father Zhang stopped him: "It's already the first watch; what are you doing disturbing the Chief! Rest a night at home. It won't be too late to visit tomorrow." Father Zhang added, "Also prepare some local products."

Early the next morning, Zhang Yu got up. After washing, he saw that his parents had risen even earlier than him. The table was not only prepared with breakfast but also with four colors of simple gifts.

Zhang Yu first sent a clerk to Hong Huangnan's place to deliver a card requesting a meeting. This clerk had only recently sought refuge with them. Speaking of relationships, he was the grandson of Zhang Yu's mother's cousin. He was only twelve years old, surnamed He. His nickname was Yumai (Corn). Although he came from the countryside, he was quite clever. After he sought refuge, the old Zhang couple let him stay in the family residence to do odd jobs and run errands to deliver messages.

"Take this card and go to the reception desk at the Second Gate of the Great World to deliver it." Zhang Yu instructed him. "The officers inside will take your card; wait right there for a reply."

Yumai took the card, tucked it in his bosom, and asked: "Cousin Uncle! What if the officer refuses to take my card? You know, these gatekeepers are the most vicious. It's my first time going; he'll see a raw face, and without a bribe, not guaranteed he won't just send me away with a 'not in'."

"You don't need to worry. Australians don't have that rule. Besides, this is my card; the officer will definitely take it. Just wait there, and once you have a sure message, come back immediately to report to me—not here, find me at the Zhang's Pastry Shop old branch at the Great World."

"What if Senator Hong isn't in Guangzhou?"

"Then ask the handling officer to make a reservation registration."

Yumai received the instructions and went straight out of the city, heading for the Great World. It wasn't his first time coming—when they first arrived in Guangzhou, the old Zhang couple found a day to take these poor relatives seeking refuge to the Great World to "taste Australian meat." Yumai not only saw many fresh things he hadn't seen in the countryside but also got the first pair of shoes in his life, which made him extremely happy.

So this time coming, he didn't have the shock of the first time. Moreover, although he was young, he knew that at this moment he was "shouldering a heavy responsibility."

The Great World was huge. He circled inside a few times and asked people before finding the "Second Gate," which was the gate leading to the Inner World.

The Great World's "Surface World" and "Inner World" were strictly separated; only Senators and permitted naturalized citizens could enter and exit. To facilitate internal and external communication, a reception desk was specially set up at the entrance and exit.

Anyone who wanted to request to see a Senator had to register at the reception desk to make an appointment. Only then could they visit the Senator at the replied time.

After the plague ended, the number of Senators coming to Guangzhou suddenly increased. Those Senators who didn't yet have their own "yamens" in Guangzhou treated the General Office Guesthouse in the Great World as their "temporary headquarters." The number of "guests" coming in and out of the Great World every day suddenly increased several times. A long dragon of a queue also formed in front of the reception desk counter.

Yumai queued for more than half an hour before getting to the counter. Seeing an "Australian Big Girl" sitting inside, who in this child's eyes was "shining" dazzlingly, he didn't dare look much and quickly handed up the card.

The female clerk had been busy until now and was somewhat irritable. Seeing a befuddled child coming, she became even more impatient. Taking the card and looking at it, she scolded: "Mute? If you don't speak, who knows which Chief you want to see?"

Yumai quickly said: "Sister, my master wants to see Senator Hong... Senator Hong Huangnan..."

The female clerk glanced at the Senator Entry/Exit Table inside the counter—this was a device for recording Senators' comings and goings based on Pinyin alphabetical order of surnames, inlaid with nameplates of Senators currently staying in the guesthouse. Each Senator's sequence had colored tags and simple records indicating whether they were currently in the guesthouse, had guests, etc.

Hong Huangnan's current tag showed: He is not in the guesthouse today. Status is "Out for Inspection." Expected time three days; today is only the second day.

"Senator Hong went out for inspection." The female clerk threw the card back without looking. "Come back the day after tomorrow. Next!"

Yumai refused to leave, because "Cousin Uncle" had said he must have a reply. It was his first time doing important business for his Cousin Uncle; if he brought back a "not home," what impression would it give Cousin Uncle? He clung tightly to the counter and smiled: "Sister, please help out. Even if he comes back the day after tomorrow, help my master register first—take a number?"

"Does your master have the qualification to reserve a number?" The female clerk raised her eyebrows and sneered. Ignoring him, she shouted loudly: "Next!"

Yumai watched helplessly as this errand was not done beautifully, and quickly added: "My master is Zhang Yu! Zhang's Food..."

The clerk became increasingly impatient and shouted loudly: "I don't care if you are Zhang Yu or Li Yu; this is the rule! If you don't leave, I'll call someone to chase you out!"

This shout alarmed the shift leader clerk. Similar quarrels at the reception window had happened more than once these days. It wasn't anything special; too many people wanted to see Senators. If they didn't put on a stern face, countless people would make noise like this. But somehow, a few days ago, there was a surprise inspection of window units. It was said that a Senator's secretary was "severely punished," the charge being very serious, and had been escorted back to Lingao for disposal. This shift leader, after all, had worked under the Senate for an extra year; her "sensitivity" was far beyond these newcomers who had only been working for a few months.

She immediately walked over, stopped the clerk, and asked for the reason pleasantly. Hearing that he wanted to register for an appointment—she looked at the boy in front of her. Although dressed neatly and appearing clever, one look showed he wasn't a servant or apprentice from a local big household or merchant family.
