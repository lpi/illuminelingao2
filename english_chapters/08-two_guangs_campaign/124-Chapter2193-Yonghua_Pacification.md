# Chapter 2193 - Yonghua Pacification

"Although your whole Yonghua Township has guilt, this time besieging the county seat was led by you guys. This is not false, right?"

The other three Tianchang Gong immediately chimed in: "Master, not false! It was exactly Baimang Stockade inciting us to attack the county seat!"

Baimang Stockade's Tianchang Gong couldn't argue clearly with a hundred mouths, only shouting injustice continuously, kowtowing like pounding garlic. Whether Great Ming or Great Song, they were always "official troops." Since ancient times, "pacifying Yao" by official troops often involved killing, arson, and slaughtering villages and stockades. They all witnessed the prowess of Great Song official troops last night. If they really went to Yonghua Township to "pacify Yao," it would be a disaster of breaking families and destroying clans. This Tianchang Gong knew the severity well and had to shout injustice continuously.

Huang Chao himself didn't intend to use Yonghua Yao people to establish prestige: Yonghua Yao people had been registered households for many years and interacted much with local Han people, belonging to objects that could be won over—pacifying local wars, winning over a part of locals could play a great assisting role.

However, the scale of this Yao riot was very large. Even the usually always "law-abiding" Yonghua Yao people participated, showing how chaotic the situation was and how restless the people's hearts were. Without letting these Yao people "know fear," they couldn't be made to obey his command.

"Leaving aside you colluding with Eight Row Yao rebels, just the crimes committed by your Baimang Stockade are enough to slaughter your whole stockade." Huang Chao said grimly.

"Master spare life! The little stockade really wasn't the leader! Every stockade has those who seduced Eight Row Yao! ...All have..." Tianchang Gong shouted hoarsely, "This lowly one is willing to report!"

"He's talking nonsense!" "Speak with conscience!" "Doesn't your conscience hurt saying this?!"

Huang Chao raised his hand to signal them not to quarrel anymore. He swept a glance at the four Tianchang Gong and said: "Who colluded and who didn't, I know clearly in my heart. You guys go down later and each write a confession. Those written clearly and plainly will have merits offsetting crimes! Those ambiguous, and those trying to muddle through, don't blame me for turning my face ruthlessly."

"This lowly one doesn't know characters..."

"You speak, I will naturally arrange people to write." Huang Chao said, "And one more thing, you immediately send people back to the stockades. Whoever robbed things or abducted people, I give you three days time to send them all back to the county seat. If not returned when due, I will have to send people to come to the door to fetch them."

Several Tianchang Gong had frowns on their faces, but had to say "Yes."

"But we still have to go buy salt. There isn't a bit of salt in the stockade..." Pan Tianshun said with a frown.

"Only with a head can you eat salt." Huang Chao said coldly.

The four Tianchang Gong couldn't help trembling hearing this. Seeing this, Huang Chao grinned and said, "Do as I say, listen to my words, and I guarantee you have salt to eat."

The four Tianchang Gong knew Huang Chao would demand something else, so they waited silently for Huang Chao to speak again.

"You can go back tomorrow morning. I can also release your people. But the morning after tomorrow, I want to see your able-bodied men outside Lianzhou City: eighteen to forty years old, all bringing weapons, coming to the county seat to listen to my orders."

The Tianchang Gong looked at each other. This condition wasn't harsh, but revealed a trace of weirdness. Dealing with the government and doing business with merchants for many years, they had long formed the habit of being suspicious. Was this move trying to lure their able-bodied men to kill them? Such things, it was heard that the government had done in the past too.

Seeing them hemming and hawing with difficult looks on their faces, Huang Chao initially couldn't figure it out, thinking *what difficulty is there in this small matter?* He asked:

"What difficulties do you still have?"

"This, this..." Pan Tianshun was quite troubled. Speaking the truth would provoke this Great Song official to fly into a rage. Leaving aside whether the other party designed a trap, once this sentence was spoken, they would surely cover all be pushed out to be beheaded.

It was Peng Shouan who had been here for a long time and had experience dealing with Yao people. Looking at this appearance, he already understood seventy to eighty percent. He whispered a few sentences to Huang Chao. Huang Chao laughed upon hearing it, shaking his head:

"If I wanted to kill, I would have killed everyone last night. Is it worth the effort to engage in these tricks?" Huang Chao expressed disdain.

The four Tianchang Gong knew what Huang Chao said was true, but couldn't make a decision immediately. They discussed with each other, and Pan Tianshun represented the four to propose a condition: "We want a hostage."

"Hostage?"

Huang Chao suddenly laughed towards the sky, laughing so much that the people above and below couldn't make heads or tails of it. After quite a while, he stopped smiling and said sternly: "You all open your eyes and look! Great Song Celestial Troops are here. If I wanted the heads of a few able-bodied men from your villages, I could have slaughtered you all in the battle last night, and killed dogs and chickens without leaving any today in various stockades—do I still need to spend this thought? You all be clearer: I considered that you have been registered households for many years and are all peaceful good commoners, only rising to besiege the county seat under the incitement of Eight Row Yao this time—and many people died. Pitying you, I waited to give a living path! Life or death is all in a single thought of yours!"

These words made the faces of several Tianchang Gong pale. Pan Tianshun glanced at the others and dared not speak anymore.

Huang Chao instructed to release all captured Yao people, and gave simple treatment to the wounded. As for the corpses of those killed in battle, heads were not cut off. He notified various stockades to claim them at will; those unclaimed would be buried on the spot. Captured weapons were also returned to them—Yao people's weapons were used even worse than the worst troops of the government forces; even iron tools were few, many were bamboo spears.

Starting the next day, Yao people of the four stockades successively came over under the leadership of Tianchang Gong. Not only did they bring back robbed property, but they also brought back more than five hundred men and women, old and young, abducted from Yangshan County seat and surroundings.

Huang Chao looked at the property they handed back; it was truly shabby and pitiful. The Han commoners of Yangshan couldn't be said to be rich either, so naturally, there wasn't much soft goods or wealth. Seeing that what they sent back included not only crude furniture from ordinary citizens' homes but also various farm tools... As for cloth, grain, and clothes, in their eyes, they were already excellent war trophies.

"This is truly poor people robbing poor people." Huang Chao looked at the Yao people paying things and local commoners claiming items, secretly sympathizing in his heart. *It seems that to have long-term peace and stability here, we still have to let everyone live a life of warmth and fullness.*

The returned things were miscellaneous, piling up in a big heap in front of the County Yamen. Except for large items like furniture, most things actually couldn't be distinguished. Wang Chuyi then followed Huang Chao's instructions to register them uniformly and distribute them to the commoners.

Robbed items were not registered, so naturally, it was impossible to verify if Yonghua Yao people handed them all back honestly. But Huang Chao just turned a blind eye. The four stockades' Tianchang Gong expressed that robbed things were all returned, only part of the salt was already consumed and couldn't be returned...

"I won't pursue the salt. I have also heard about your difficulty in eating salt and the high price of salt." Huang Chao said.

"Many thanks to Master!"

"Where are the able-bodied men?"

"All came. Waiting for Master to inspect outside the South Gate."

Outside the South Gate, the able-bodied men of the four stockades had finished assembling. Because he only wanted able-bodied men aged eighteen to forty, plus fifty or sixty able-bodied men of the four stockades were killed or wounded in that ambush battle, the able-bodied men who came were only over a hundred people. According to his prior instructions, they uniformly carried bamboo spears and crossbows.

He looked at the complexion of the able-bodied men, feeling it was passable. Anyway, commoners of this spacetime all had dark faces of malnutrition. It was just that clothes were a bit tattered, and some people were wearing clothes obviously robbed.

Huang Chao asked these able-bodied men to all wear blue armbands and organized them into the National Army Yangshan Provisional Squadron. One of the platoons stayed in Yangshan, with the National Army responsible for "military training." The other two platoons were ordered to follow the main force to set off for Lianzhou.

Huang Chao stayed in Yangshan for a day, handling some urgent affairs of Yangshan. Early on June 1st, he led the troops to take the small steam launch reinforced from Guangzhou generally north along the Lian River. Coming to reinforce with the small steam launch were also two small gunboats, 6 12-pounder mountain howitzers and their gunners, plus 12 artillery sergeant students.

At noon, the boat convoy arrived at Lianzhou. Huang Chao was originally a native of Lianzhou in Northern Guangdong. In eight years, this was the first time he returned to his hometown. Looking at the hometown of 1635, Huang Chao was speechless for a while. Back then he and his wife Huang Susu chose to travel through time because families of both sides didn't agree to their marriage. Now he returned to his hometown, but his parents were in another spacetime. Huang Chao couldn't help sighing for a while. Was he too childish back then? Should he have persuaded parents of both sides a bit more back then?

Huang Chao couldn't care to think too much; he didn't even look at the beautiful scenery of Huangchuan Three Gorges on the way. There was a big pile of problems in front of him waiting to be solved. The troops landed at the west of Lianzhou City, opposite Longjin Gate wharf. The Eight Row Yao besieging Lianzhou City were seen sparse and scattered. Outside each city gate, there were only fifty or sixty people, and the age was generally on the older side. Huang Chao estimated roughly: Lianzhou City had ten gates in total for the old city and new city. Except for the South Gate of the old city connecting the new and old cities, the other nine gates all led to outside the city. Now there were about five hundred people surrounding Lianzhou City. The rest were either hiding in some place or scattering to surrounding villages to loot. But doing so had little risk. Most villages in the Lianzhou area had built stockade walls, and every village had able-bodied men guarding the village. Without mobilizing five or six hundred people each time, a stockade couldn't be taken. If many people were mobilized, the defenders inside Lianzhou City would break out seizing the opportunity.

Intelligence before departure showed that Eight Row Yao besieging the city had over a thousand people. According to Pan Tianshun's statement, Huang Chao estimated that for the Eight Rows and Twenty-Four Hollows, the young adults were roughly between 2500 and 3000. The Eight Row Yao besieging Lianzhou City were probably more than a thousand, between 1500 and 2000. So a large part of the Eight Row Yao forces hadn't been discovered yet, and there was also a large part of able-bodied men staying behind to guard.

Now, Huang Chao had only four hundred people at most on hand. One National Army squadron stayed in Yangshan; one squadron was left in Yonghua Township. Those who followed Huang Chao to Lianzhou were only a battalion and the Li-Miao Company. Huang Chao had no ability to attack. He chose to control various ferries on the west bank of the Lian River, blocking the retreat of Eight Row Yao returning west. Now it depended on whether Yang Zeng could occupy Luming Pass in time.
