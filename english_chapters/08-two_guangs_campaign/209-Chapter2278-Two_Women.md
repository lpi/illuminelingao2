# Chapter 2278: Two Women

Ding A-tao couldn't help her face turning red. Fortunately Wen Yun beside her was sensible enough, supporting her all the way, avoiding too much loss of face.

Luckily once she entered the temple gate, a Daoist flew to report to Wu Yuan. Wu Yuan immediately welcomed out, exchanged extremely warm pleasantries, then personally led her to patrol inside the temple. First offered incense in the Main Hall, then went to the Crown Prince Hall beside to offer incense. After offering incense in all halls, then sent them to the backyard quiet room to rest.

Because they were female guests, Abbot Wu Yuan inconveniently stayed long in the quiet room; said some flattering words then excused himself out. Fortunately such big temples usually hired some female guest prefects who were eloquent and liked by superiors, specially accompanying big household dependents coming to offer incense to talk. These people both could observe words and expressions, and could speak well. Quickly coaxed Ding A-tao’s brows to unfold; truly so-called "Today finally know rich people's days are even better than you imagine."

Yi Haoran seeing Ding A-tao settled down, took a leave then came out—for avoiding suspicion he originally inconveniently stayed long in the room either.

Currently yard was quiet; besides three wing rooms at east end occupied by Ding A-tao’s group, other houses had no people. Cai Lan probably hadn't arrived yet? Yi Haoran unconsciously felt somewhat anxious, but thinking he met Qiuchan previous day, she didn't mention matter had changes.

Don't be anxious, Yi Haoran warned himself secretly. Calculating silently in heart how to persuade Cai Lan in a while.

Position of the yard was very quiet; surroundings had quite a few big trees, thick shade covering sun. Walking under trees, cool breeze blowing gently, completely couldn't feel summer heat. Abbot Wu Yuan for pleasing big household female dependents, spent much thought; not only planted flowers and trees widely in yard, but also specially opened up a small garden behind main rooms, embellished with flowers, trees and lake stones.

"This Daoist really knows how to enjoy!" Yi Haoran secretly slandered in heart.

Truth to tell, he hadn't thought well after persuading Cai Lan, what use could let her play. But at least Cai Lan was Hair thief Xie’s pillow person—even if she couldn't influence Hair thief, at least could know quite a few Hair thief matters. From inside maybe could obtain useful news.

He was just thinking in a trance, suddenly outside yard came Abbot Wu Yuan’s voice: "Please this side, please this side." He started: must be Cai Lan arrived!

Yi Haoran hurriedly got up, turned behind the curtain of east wing room eaves. Sure enough, not a moment later, he saw Jiang Qiuchan accompanying a young woman walking in; behind followed several male and female servants and maids.

Once entering yard gate, Qiuchan stopped steps, saying to male servants: "You wait outside this yard." Saying so, supported Cai Lan’s arm again, softly said: "Miss watch under foot."

Cai Lan nodded slightly. Today coming to Dragon Mother Temple to scatter heart; although sun was toxic when going out, this was first time going out in months; getting on sedan chair looking at street scene outside still had a few points of freshness, also washed away much of original tangles and pain in heart. However once arriving before steps of Dragon Mother Temple gate, past event of assassinating Xie Erren here instantly floated onto her heart again; Cai Lan only felt both shame and guilt, wishing to rush out of sedan chair directly jumping into rolling waves of Gui River.

Still Qiuchan considerate to her; seeing her not getting off sedan for long time, suddenly realized something, hurriedly ordered sedan bearers to lift sedan again, entering from side gate.

This delay at gate consumed thought of sightseeing completely clean; Cai Lan had heart to go back directly, still Qiuchan urged strongly: since specially coming to offer incense, entered temple gate, how could there reflect reason of not worshipping. God blaming would be terrible! Cai Lan hearing words, had to get off sedan, went to Dragon Mother Hall to offer incense first.

Wu Yuan was most understanding of human intentions; knew Cai Lan’s heart disease, therefore sent small Daoists early, clearing field around Dragon Mother Hall and pilgrims inside halls, blocking outside yard. Avoiding idle people discussing, provoking Miss Cai unhappiness.

Cai Lan entered Dragon Mother Temple, saw Divine Image precious appearance solemn, yet revealing kindness and mercy; five small dragons coiling on lotus seat under foot, expression intimate, like infants. She only felt the Divine Image before eyes was so kind, as if her mother passed away for years. Grievance, fear, resentment of these days... all surged onto heart, couldn't suppress anymore, instantly collapsed paralyzed on ground, tears like spring gushing.

Abbot Wu Yuan caught off guard, busy came up to advise: "Miss, Miss, need not be like this, need not be like this."

Qiuchan hurriedly came up to support, advising in low voice.

Good half a day, Cai Lan finally stopped crying sound; she crying loudly like this, actually cried out accumulation of these days, mood relaxed quite a bit. Stopped voice saying: "Sister Qiuchan, help me offer offerings."

This side Abbot prepared rattan woven praying mats specially for big households offering incense long ago; Qiuchan also presented brought offerings, lit brought Tibetan incense. Cai Lan took over, prayed silently.

After Cai Lan offered incense, Qiuchan also burned incense praying. Subsequently according to custom offered incense in various halls in order. Then led by Abbot came to backyard.

Jiang Qiuchan supported Cai Lan entering yard, saw there were human voices in east wing room, knew this must be Luo family female dependents Yi Haoran mentioned. Looking again behind curtain under east wing room eaves corridor a man's figure was swaying—probably was Advisor Hao. She then deliberately slowed down steps.

Yi Haoran seeing Jiang Qiuchan’s sight line projecting towards here, slowed down steps again, knew she already noticed himself, so pulled curtain slightly a few times. Saw Qiuchan nodding slightly, supporting Cai Lan walked past.

Entered main room; inside prepared melons and fruits for relieving summer heat long ago; also someone sent cool water and towel for Cai Lan to wash. Cai Lan finished washing, rested in east room. Qiuchan took opportunity to walk out.

Yi Haoran seeing no one in yard, quietly walked out from behind curtain, made a gesture towards Qiuchan, pointing to behind banana tree in corner of yard. Qiuchan nodded slightly, looked at no one paying attention to her in main room, heart banging wildly, actually inexplicably had a stimulation sense of doing bad thing.

Behind banana tree in yard corner had several lake stones embellished, also flowers and trees covering; was a good place for private talk. Yi Haoran asked in low voice: "How is Miss Cai?"

"Today originally somewhat lazy not wanting to come. I instigated her for long time, also said booked already inconvenient to change, she finally came out." Qiuchan said, "Crying a big scene when offering incense just now—looking at appearance mood actually better much. Just she is somewhat weak now, resting in warm pavilion."

"You did well." Yi Haoran praised, "Truly hero among women."

This praise made Qiuchan heart little deer crash randomly, banging straight jump. Mr. Hao before eyes, although age over fifty, yet appearance magnificent, every gesture had a calmness and self-possession bearing; speaking words both kind and transparent with reason—speaking of it, own husband far inferior to him...

"Sir overpraised." Qiuchan unconsciously somewhat coy.

Yi Haoran didn't notice state of mind of little woman before eyes at all, only cared about speaking his arrangement:

"In a while noon will send vegetarian meal; after eating meal, you have to persuade Cai Lan to go out walk to digest food," he pointed to moon gate beside corridor of main room, "Enter that door has a small garden, I will wait there. You just need to device to let Cai Lan enter. Remaining matters I will do."

Qiuchan nodded silently, said: "I know. Just Miss Cai’s mood good and bad at times; Sir entrusting matters need to be careful, don't touch her sore spot."

Yi Haoran returned under corridor; this side small Daoist sent fragrant tea, turns out Lotus Leaf Tea. This kind of tea, Ding A-tao tasted at local Grain Guild Head's home in past; was made by Dragon Mother Temple Daoists themselves, most precious. Daoists mostly used this as human favor gift to big households in this city. Drinking in own mouth at this moment, naturally was another special feeling.

She saw Yi Haoran under eaves refusing to come in, told Wen Yun to send a cup of tea over.

"Many thanks Aunt Wen." Yi Haoran took tea, deadpan serious.

Wen Yun covered mouth with tea tray smiling: "Mr. Hao, you are always so polite."

"Where, this is etiquette." Yi Haoran said.

"Your etiquette is really thorough, indeed a scholar." Wen Yun put down tea tray, face full of innocent appearance, "Why don't you sit in room? Insist on coming under this eaves."

"Here breathable, has wind." Yi Haoran finding her innocent, smiled, "Besides, I a man, weather hot sweating profusely, in room wouldn't I smoke Mistress?"

"Our family is business family, where so particular." Wen Yun said, "Mistress doesn't care about this either."

"Words are so, however Sage says: See no impropriety, hear no impropriety, speak no impropriety, move no impropriety." Yi Haoran liked her innocence, smiled, "Men and women have distinction; you and Mistress in room, I naturally shouldn't be inside."

"Aiyaya, Mr. Hao you are really a Sour-Scholar!"

Yi Haoran laughed loudly, said: "Aunt says right, Hao someone is a sour fellow holding Sage's words as golden rule."

Wen Yun froze, covering mouth with handkerchief smiling: "Sir really interesting. Right, Sir, just now I saw you go behind banana tree? Anything fun behind there?"

Yi Haoran started, didn't expect surprisingly seen by this little woman! He hurriedly covered up: "I saw a few banana trees green lovely, went over to look—indeed a scene of victory in pot, so sat there for a while."

Wen Yun didn't know what was "Victory in Pot," just about to ask; saw outside small Daoist carry tray entering door; behind another fire worker Daoist carrying food box came in, knew lunch delivered, hurriedly said: "Temple sent us lunch. Go eat."

Eight Immortals Table already set in passing hall of wing room, bowls and chopsticks laid out. Luo family after all was merchant family, unlike Yi Haoran so particular about etiquette; he naturally couldn't be too pedantic either, had to excuse seat, sitting on West Guest Seat.

Food on table not much, but quite exquisite: Braised Fat Choy with Winter Mushroom; Cold Dressed Bamboo Shoot Tip; Vegetarian Goose; Arhat Feast. Plus a big bowl of Shrimp Ball Soup; snow white shrimp balls and tender yellow yellow chives floating on soup surface, looking tempting. Staple food was Lotus Leaf Porridge cooked with local fragrant rice, plus a plate of Silver Thread.

Small Daoist also sent Guangxi famous product Guilin Sanhua Liquor and four dried and fresh fruits for wine. Ding A-tao mood very good, asked everyone to drink a cup.
