# Chapter 2278: Two Women

Ding A-tao couldn't help her face from turning red. Fortunately, Wen Yun beside her was sensible enough and supported her the whole way, sparing her too much loss of face.

Luckily, the moment she entered the temple gate, a Daoist hurried off to report to Wu Yuan. Wu Yuan immediately came out to welcome her, exchanging extremely warm pleasantries, then personally led her on a tour of the temple. First they offered incense in the Main Hall, then proceeded to the Crown Prince Hall beside it to offer incense as well. After paying respects at all the halls, he escorted them to the quiet room in the backyard to rest.

Since they were female guests, Abbot Wu Yuan could not appropriately linger long in the quiet room. He said a few flattering words, then excused himself and withdrew. Fortunately, large temples like this typically hired female guest prefects—eloquent women favored by their superiors—specifically to accompany ladies from prominent households who came to offer incense. These women were skilled at reading expressions and spoke well. Before long, they had coaxed Ding A-tao's brow to unfold. Truly, as they say: "Today I finally know that rich people's lives are even better than I imagined."

Seeing Ding A-tao settled in, Yi Haoran excused himself and stepped out—for propriety's sake, he should not linger in the room anyway.

The courtyard was quiet. Besides the three wing rooms at the east end that Ding A-tao's group occupied, the other buildings stood empty. Had Cai Lan not yet arrived? Yi Haoran felt a flutter of anxiety, but then recalled that he had met Qiuchan just the day before, and she had mentioned no change in plans.

*Don't be anxious,* Yi Haoran warned himself silently. He calculated in his mind how he would go about persuading Cai Lan.

The courtyard's location was quite secluded, surrounded by large trees whose thick shade blocked the sun. Walking beneath them, with a cool breeze blowing gently, one could scarcely feel the summer heat at all. Abbot Wu Yuan had spent considerable thought on pleasing the female dependents of prominent households—not only planting flowers and trees throughout the yard, but also creating a small garden behind the main rooms, embellished with flowers, trees, and ornamental rocks.

*This Daoist really knows how to enjoy himself!* Yi Haoran thought with silent disdain.

Truth be told, he had not yet figured out what use Cai Lan could be, even if he succeeded in persuading her. But at the very least, Cai Lan was the pillow companion of that Hair thief Xie. Even if she could not influence the Hair thief directly, she would certainly know something of his affairs. Perhaps from that, Yi Haoran could obtain useful intelligence.

He was still lost in these thoughts when suddenly Abbot Wu Yuan's voice sounded from outside the courtyard: "This way, please. This way, please."

He started. *Cai Lan must have arrived!*

Yi Haoran hurriedly rose and slipped behind the curtain beneath the eaves of the east wing room corridor. Sure enough, moments later, he saw Jiang Qiuchan accompanying a young woman into the courtyard, followed by several male and female servants and maids.

Upon entering the courtyard gate, Qiuchan halted and addressed the male servants: "You wait outside this courtyard." Then she took Cai Lan's arm again and said softly: "Miss, watch your step."

Cai Lan nodded slightly. She had come to Dragon Mother Temple to clear her mind. Though the sun had been fierce when they set out, this was her first excursion in months. Looking at the street scenes from her sedan chair had brought a touch of freshness, washing away much of the tangled pain in her heart. But the moment they arrived at the steps of Dragon Mother Temple's main gate, the memory of her assassination attempt against Xie Erren here flooded back. Cai Lan felt such shame and guilt that she wished she could leap from the sedan directly into the rolling waves of the Gui River.

It was Qiuchan who understood her best. Seeing that she remained in the sedan for a long time without getting out, Qiuchan suddenly realized what was wrong and hastily ordered the bearers to lift the sedan again, entering through the side gate instead.

This delay at the main gate had drained all her desire for sightseeing. Cai Lan was inclined to return home directly. But Qiuchan urged her strongly: since they had made the special trip to offer incense and had already entered the temple gate, how could she possibly not worship? To offend the gods would be terrible! Hearing these words, Cai Lan had no choice but to descend from the sedan and proceed first to the Dragon Mother Hall to offer incense.

Wu Yuan understood human nature intimately. Knowing Cai Lan's sensitivities, he had sent young Daoists ahead to clear the area around the Dragon Mother Hall and block pilgrims from the halls, keeping them outside the courtyard—to avoid idle gossip that might displease Miss Cai.

When Cai Lan entered Dragon Mother Temple and saw the divine image with its precious and solemn countenance yet kind and merciful expression, with five small dragons coiling about the lotus seat beneath it—their expressions intimate, like infants—she felt as if the divine image before her eyes were as tender as her own mother, who had passed away years ago. All the grievances, fears, and resentments of these days... everything surged up in her heart at once. She could suppress it no longer. Instantly, she collapsed to the ground, tears gushing like a spring.

Abbot Wu Yuan was caught off guard and hastened forward to comfort her: "Miss, Miss, there's no need for this, no need for this."

Qiuchan hurried over to support her, advising in a low voice.

After a long while, Cai Lan finally stopped crying. This unrestrained weeping had actually released the accumulation of these past days, and her mood lightened considerably. She stopped and said: "Sister Qiuchan, help me with the offerings."

The Abbot had long ago prepared rattan-woven praying mats specially for prominent households' incense offerings. Qiuchan also presented the offerings they had brought and lit the Tibetan incense. Cai Lan took it over and prayed silently.

After Cai Lan finished, Qiuchan also burned incense and prayed. Subsequently, following custom, they offered incense at the various halls in order. Then, led by the Abbot, they came to the backyard.

Jiang Qiuchan supported Cai Lan as they entered the courtyard. Hearing voices coming from the east wing room, she knew this must be the Luo family's female dependents that Yi Haoran had mentioned. Looking again toward the corridor of the east wing room, she could see a man's figure swaying behind the curtain—that was probably Advisor Hao. She deliberately slowed her pace.

Yi Haoran, seeing Jiang Qiuchan's gaze directed his way as she slowed her steps, knew she had noticed him. He gently lifted the curtain a few times in acknowledgment. Qiuchan nodded slightly and continued supporting Cai Lan as they walked past.

They entered the main room, where melons and fruits for relieving the summer heat had been prepared. Someone also brought cool water and towels for Cai Lan to wash. After freshening up, Cai Lan retired to the eastern chamber to rest. Qiuchan took the opportunity to step outside.

Seeing no one in the courtyard, Yi Haoran quietly emerged from behind the curtain. He made a gesture to Qiuchan, pointing toward a banana tree in the corner of the yard. Qiuchan nodded slightly. Noticing that no one in the main room was paying attention to her, her heart pounded wildly—she felt an inexplicable thrill, as if she were doing something illicit.

Behind the banana tree in the yard corner stood several ornamental rocks, with flowers and trees providing cover—an excellent spot for a private conversation. Yi Haoran asked in a low voice: "How is Miss Cai?"

"She was actually somewhat reluctant to come today. I urged her for a long time, also saying that since the reservation was already made it would be inconvenient to change. Finally she agreed to come out." Qiuchan said, "She cried quite a bit during the incense offering just now—but looking at her afterward, her mood seems much better. She's just a bit weak now and is resting in the warm pavilion."

"You did well." Yi Haoran praised. "Truly a heroine among women."

This praise made Qiuchan's heart flutter like a startled fawn, pounding wildly. Master Hao before her, though over fifty years old, cut a magnificent figure. Every gesture carried an air of calm self-possession. His words were both kind and transparently reasonable. Come to think of it, her own husband had been far inferior to him...

"Sir flatters me too much." Qiuchan found herself somewhat coy despite herself.

Yi Haoran did not notice the state of mind of the young woman before him at all. He cared only about explaining his arrangements:

"In a short while, they'll send the vegetarian meal at noon. After the meal, you must persuade Cai Lan to go for a walk to aid digestion." He pointed toward a moon gate beside the corridor of the main room. "Through that gate is a small garden. I'll be waiting there. You just need to contrive to get Cai Lan inside. I'll handle the rest."

Qiuchan nodded silently. "I understand. It's just that Miss Cai's mood is unpredictable. The matters Sir is entrusting me with—please be careful not to touch her sore spots."

Yi Haoran returned beneath the corridor. By now, a young Daoist had brought fragrant tea—Lotus Leaf Tea, as it turned out. This particular tea was something Ding A-tao had once tasted at the home of the local Grain Guild Head. It was made by the Daoists of Dragon Mother Temple themselves and was most precious. The Daoists typically used it as gifts to curry favor with the city's prominent households. Drinking it now brought her a rather special feeling.

Seeing Yi Haoran under the eaves, refusing to come inside, she told Wen Yun to bring him a cup of tea.

"Many thanks, Aunt Wen." Yi Haoran accepted the tea, his expression as proper and serious as ever.

Wen Yun covered her mouth with the tea tray and giggled. "Mr. Hao, you're always so polite."

"It's simply proper etiquette," Yi Haoran said.

"Your etiquette is really thorough—truly a scholar." Wen Yun set down the tea tray, her face full of innocent curiosity. "Why don't you sit inside? Why insist on staying out here under the eaves?"

"It's more ventilated here, with a breeze," Yi Haoran said. Finding her innocence rather endearing, he smiled. "Besides, I'm a man. In this hot weather, I'm sweating profusely. Inside the room, wouldn't I fill the air with my scent and bother the Mistress?"

"Our family is a merchant family—we're not so particular," Wen Yun said. "The Mistress doesn't mind such things either."

"That may be true, but the Sage says: 'See no impropriety, hear no impropriety, speak no impropriety, do no impropriety.'" Yi Haoran, amused by her innocence, smiled. "Men and women have their distinctions. With you and the Mistress inside, I naturally should not be in there."

"Aiya, Mr. Hao, you really are a pedantic scholar!"

Yi Haoran laughed aloud. "The Aunt speaks truly. This Hao fellow is indeed a sour sort who holds the Sage's words as golden rule."

Wen Yun blinked, then covered her mouth with her handkerchief, giggling: "Sir is truly amusing. By the way, Sir—just now I saw you go behind the banana tree. Is there something fun back there?"

Yi Haoran started. He hadn't expected this young woman to have noticed! He quickly covered: "I saw those banana trees looking so lovely and green, so I went over to look. Indeed, it's quite a fine little scene—like a victory in a pot. So I sat there for a while."

Wen Yun didn't know what "victory in a pot" meant and was just about to ask when she saw a young Daoist carrying a tray come through the gate, followed by another Daoist carrying a food box from the kitchen. Knowing that lunch had arrived, she quickly said: "The temple has sent our lunch. Come eat."

An Eight Immortals table had already been set up in the passageway of the wing room, with bowls and chopsticks laid out. The Luo family was, after all, a merchant household, not as particular about etiquette as Yi Haoran. He could not be too pedantic either, so he excused himself and sat down in the western guest seat.

The food on the table was not abundant, but quite refined: Braised Fat Choy with Winter Mushrooms; Cold Dressed Bamboo Shoot Tips; Vegetarian Goose; Arhat's Feast. Plus a large bowl of Shrimp Ball Soup—snow-white shrimp balls and tender yellow chives floating on the surface, looking most appetizing. The staple food was Lotus Leaf Porridge cooked with local fragrant rice, plus a plate of Silver Thread rolls.

The young Daoist also brought out Guilin Sanhua Liquor—a famous Guangxi specialty—and four plates of dried and fresh fruits to accompany the wine. Ding A-tao was in excellent spirits and invited everyone to have a cup.
