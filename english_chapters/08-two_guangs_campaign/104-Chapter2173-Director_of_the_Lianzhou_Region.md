# Chapter 2173 - Director of the Lianzhou Region

"The Luopang Yao of Luoding were indeed the main force of the Guangdong Yao disturbances in the past, but they are no longer significant enough to be a threat," Huang Chao stated this conclusion after pondering for a moment.

"Oh? Let's hear it."

"Luoding Prefecture, which is the area around present-day Yu'nan County, specifically the Luopang Mountains, was once the main battlefield of the Yao disturbances in the Two Guangs. Historically, they rebounded repeatedly after pacification. However, in the early years of the Wanli reign, the Luopang Yao were thoroughly defeated by the Ming army commanded by Yin Zhengmao and Ling Yunyi. Later, after decades of the 'recruiting people to settle and register' policy, the power of the local Yao people is far less than before."

The Luopang Mountains located in today's Yu'nan County connect the East Mountains, West Mountains, and the rear mountains of Longshui, stretching for seven hundred *li*. They border Xinxing to the east, Yangchun to the south, Yulin (in Guangxi) and Cenxi (in Guangxi) to the west, and extend to the Yangtze River (including areas north of the ridges in Hunan) to the north. Thousands of mountains are connected, with Yao and Zhuang people living among them. For hundreds of years, although government troops suppressed them many times, they would rise again soon after. Since the middle of the Ming Dynasty, large numbers of common people went bankrupt and fled into the mountains, forming various settlements and combining with the local Yao people. They were described as "gathering fugitives from all directions to aid their cruelty, called 'Lang bandits,' plundering in all directions."

"...After the Ming Dynasty concluded its encirclement and suppression campaign in the fifth year of Wanli, they absorbed a large number of refugees from other places to settle and cultivate land in Luoding Prefecture. In terms of the ratio of population and villages in the mountainous areas, the Yao people no longer hold the advantage. Although the Assistant Regional Commander for Defense of Yao East and West Mountains has withdrawn, and some Yao villages might harbor thoughts of rebellion, judging from the current situation, only a small portion of the Yao people in Luoding would truly rise up in response. What is more worrying is actually the local bandits taking the opportunity to cause chaos."

"So you're saying there's no need for a preemptive strike?"

"Yes." Huang Chao nodded. "First, the Luoding Yao no longer pose a major threat. Their population is small now, and their productivity is low. Even if they riot, the National Army coordinating with local militia can suppress them. If we attack proactively, it might instead cause them to unite out of fear. Besides, after several Ming army encirclement campaigns, the Luopang Yao stockades are now almost all deep in the mountains, in places rarely visited by humans. Given their consistent practices, they won't confront a large army head-on. It's all mountain guerrilla warfare tactics. It will inevitably evolve into a long-term, entangled security war. A waste of effort and troops."

Bei Wei nodded noncommittally and asked again, "What else?"

Huang Chao thought to himself, *Is this a civil service exam?* Fortunately, he had researched this issue for quite some time and was fairly confident.

"We must have a strategy when dealing with the Yao people. There are many Yao people distributed across the Two Guangs region. Opening the historical records of the old timeline, government authorities of all dynasties suppressed and suppressed the Yao people again and again, even resorting to massacre. There is not only a blood feud between the two sides but also various economic reasons involved—this is the root cause of the Yao people's repeated rebellions. Our policy towards the Yao people should be similar to that for the Li people on Hainan Island, focusing primarily on economic and political policies, with military means as auxiliary."

Bei Wei laughed. "It seems everyone's attitude is about the same."

With this affirmation, Huang Chao's confidence grew. He continued:

"Actually, by the late Ming Dynasty, the Yao people in Guangdong had been basically pacified. The rebellion of the Eight Row Yao at the end of the Ming Dynasty, were it not for the combination of late Ming refugee uprisings and the Ming Dynasty's financial difficulties, would actually not have grown very large in scale. Our arrival has now broken this balance. It's impossible for the Luoding Yao not to have ideas, but they are currently weak and alone, so they can only watch and wait. We just need to maintain close surveillance and appropriate military pressure. However, if the Yao rebellion in the Lianyang area is allowed to expand, it will definitely rouse thoughts of rebellion and revenge among the Luoding Yao. If the Lianyang Yao move south and link up with the area north of the West River, the Yao people in the Luopang Mountains will definitely rise in response. We cannot let the Yao people have too much confidence in rebellion, so I believe the primary task is to first quell the Yao rebellion in the Lianyang area."

In fact, Huang Chao's insights did not go beyond the content discussed at the North Guangdong Operations Meeting of the South China Army not long ago. But Huang Chao was the person going to preside over the administration on the front lines of Lianyang, so it was very important to "unify thinking" with the military.

Huang Chao paused. Seeing that Bei Wei was still "listening attentively," he became even more enthusiastic about his discourse: "For this Lianyang Yao uprising, strategically we still need to fight first, then divide, and finally pacify. It's just that I'm not very clear about the situation in the Lianzhou area right now, so it's not appropriate to discuss specific details."

"Director Huang, currently among the three cities of Lianyang, we control only Yangshan County. Actually, strictly speaking, even Yangshan County isn't controlled by us, but is being defended by local Ming troops we incorporated and local commoners. Yangshan county seat is currently occupied by Yao people. Lianzhou City is quite special: the Lianzhou Subprefectural Magistrate appointed by the Great Ming, Cui Shizhao, refuses to surrender to us, but he is still holding out bitterly. He is currently under heavy siege by the Eight Row Yao."

"This Cui Shizhao is very capable and has a reputation for integrity. He also has his own methods for local governance. The common people are willing to exert themselves to the death for him. If he can be used by us, he will definitely be a good help," Huang Chao said.

"That will be for you to consider," Bei Wei smiled. "Right now, the main force of the Eight Row Yao is outside Lianzhou City. There are over a thousand of them, armed mostly with machetes and poisoned crossbows, with a small number of matchlocks. The troop strength inside the city is unknown, probably mostly civil militia—the Yao militia have no armor and lack firearms, so they probably can't capture it in a short time. Once our Sui River Detachment arrives, the outcome of the battle will have no suspense, but the subsequent problems will rely on you to solve."

"Rest assured!" Huang Chao knew that this trip carried great risk, but the potential for merit was substantial. "I will definitely pacify Lianzhou!"

"The Administration Council has already prepared your cadre team for you; they will depart with you this time. Considering the complex situation after you arrive in Lianzhou, the National Army commanded by you this time will be a bit larger: one battalion for Lianzhou, and two companies each for Lianshan and Yangshan."

Seeing this, Huang Chao hurriedly said, "I have a small request."

"What?"

"Can you give me a Li-Miao Mountain Infantry Company? The Lianyang area is mostly mountainous."

"That's no small request of yours." Bei Wei smiled. "The Li-Miao Mountain Companies are hot commodities right now. Of the current three companies, one has already been sent to Shaoguan. I only have two companies on hand, and the situation in West Guangdong is also complex—how about this, I'll give you one company, but I might recall them at any time."

"Okay, okay, no problem."

He wanted to ask for a bit more. "If possible, I hope the Navy can send me two small gunboats. The draft must be shallow enough..."

"No problem, the South China Army Command will contact the Navy for you," Bei Wei said. "The Army will also assign you six 12-pounder mountain howitzers, and in addition to the gunners, give you twelve NCO trainees from the artillery training class."

"All personnel check weapons!" Li Dong shouted in front of the formation.

As a unit that had proven itself, the Wuzhou Composite Company had exchanged all their equipment for Nanyang-style rifles this time. The soldiers were very happy—after all, spears were not only unsatisfactory to use but also felt too shabby in front of friendly units fully equipped with firearms.

Regarding the change to firearms, Li Dong had some opinions in his heart. The brothers in the company had indeed always envied the Nanyang rifles, but the timing of the exchange was a bit poor. The veterans had fought their way here with spears. Without the veterans fighting to the death in front, demonstrating combat power and courage, the Senate would not have issued Nanyang rifles to the Composite Company. Now, fresh recruits who hadn't fought a single battle got their hands on rifles. This made the veterans feel a bit unbalanced psychologically, and they inevitably "strictly instructed" the recruits.

Li Dong turned a blind eye to this kind of thing, as long as it didn't go too far—it was unavoidable in a company. However, he vaguely felt that the Senate's attitude toward the newly established National Army was obviously "tentative": they were uneasy about their combat effectiveness and lacked confidence in their loyalty.

He never mentioned this thought in front of the soldiers. Occasionally, when soldiers muttered about it, he would reprimand them "not to let their imaginations run wild," and explain that it was due to "insufficient production capacity." However, deep inside, he didn't quite believe this official explanation. In his experience, the Senate's supplies were always abundant to a luxurious degree; saying that supply was difficult for a few rifles was obviously problematic.

Thoughts were thoughts, but on the surface, he remained as "unquestioning" as ever, busily managing the matters of the advance every day.

The soldiers did not know the specific target of the advance. Li Dong also only knew a place name—he simply didn't know where Lianzhou was. As for Yao people, he had heard of them but never seen them. But he had seen many Li people and fought with them; he didn't feel they were particularly combat-capable, so presumably, these Yao people wouldn't be terribly formidable either.

In the spare time during the unit's reorganization, Li Dong ordered the entire company to step up training and prepare for battle.

Those who have been soldiers for a long time have a saying: Fear not the battlefield, fear the training. On the battlefield, life or death is decided quickly. But this training goes on from morning to night, every day, endlessly. Not only is it exhausting to death, but one also gets cursed by the sergeants down to one's ancestors.

"Damn it, let's get to the battlefield soon. This is killing me..." Many people muttered.

But there were also those who, although tortured half to death by drilling, felt extremely depressed at the thought of going to the front line and wished they could train here forever.

Ai Buyi was one of them. Before being drafted, he was an ordinary military household member who had never been on a battlefield. By nature, he was a man of few words. Everyone else was quite happy to use rifles. Ai Buyi felt very confused but dared not express it for fear of the military stick. It seemed only he didn't understand what there was to be happy about. Wasn't it just going out to fight again soon? Were they not afraid of death?

In theory, he was born a "soldier," but in reality, he had held a hoe all his life. Let alone fighting, he hadn't even gone to roll call a few times. When his superior surrendered to the Great Song, he surrendered too. Originally, he thought that whether it was Great Song or Great Ming, someone always had to farm the land. Unexpectedly, during inspection, the Great Song official saw that he was short and sturdy, with a dull and simple expression and a clean family background, which fitted the troop recruitment philosophy of Qi Jiguang and Zeng Guofan perfectly, so he was incorporated into the National Army.
