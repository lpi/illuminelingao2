# Chapter 2306 - Pleading for Mercy

When Luo Yangming returned home, it was already broad daylight. The whole family was waiting in the main hall. Seeing him return, they immediately surrounded him. Ding Atao and Wen Yun were teary-eyed, holding onto his arms and refusing to let go.

"What are you all crying for?" Luo Yangming let out a long breath. "Didn't I come back safe and sound?"

"Running out suddenly in the dead of night, with such violence going on outside..." Ding Atao's eyes were cried swollen like rotten peaches. "There is a whole big family here relying on you. What benefits are there in selling your life to the Australians? To risk life and forget death like this!"

Luo Yangming originally hated hearing his wife scold the Senate the most and would inevitably reprimand her if he heard it. But seeing her eyes red from worrying about him, he felt love and pity and said, "Following the Senate has plenty of benefits. Don't worry about it." Then he turned to Wen Yun and said, "Your big brother achieved great merit this time. The Senate will definitely promote him."

Wen Yun was originally teary-eyed too, but being young, she didn't heavy worries in her heart. Seeing Luo Yangming return safely, she was already relieved. Hearing him say this, she broke into a smile through her tears. "Is it really true?"

"Of course it's true."

Talking, he sat down on a chair, feeling aches all over his body. "Not only him, but his porters will also have benefits this time." Speaking to this point, he felt the world spin and collapsed to the floor.

This threw everything into chaos. The women cried, the men shouted, and they talked of calling a doctor quickly. It was Li Wensheng, being older, who held steady. He checked his breathing and pulse and said, "Master is fine. He was just too tense and busy for half the night. Now that he's relaxed, he's actually asleep. Just let him rest well."

Everyone moved hands and feet to remove Luo Yangming's dirty clothes and carried him to Wen Yun's bedroom. Ding Atao instructed everyone that from now on, the Master would see no guests. Even if the sky fell, "wait until he wakes up."

By the time things were tidied up, it was fully bright. Outside on the street, people were beating gongs and reading notices to calm the people: the night's disturbance had been quelled, Wuzhou City was safe inside and out, the four gates were open, and the common people could go about their business.

"Finally, peace and safety." Ding Atao said to Li Wensheng, "My heart was about to jump out of my throat. I really feared the government troops were fighting back..."

"Mistress, set your heart at ease. How could the government troops fight back? Just a few jumping clowns..."

Just as they were speaking, Ah Chun suddenly reported: The Eldest Mistress of the Jiang family begs an audience.

"Which Eldest Mistress of the Jiang family?" Ding Atao didn't react for a moment.

"It's the wife of Master Jiang, the manager of Ruijin Tang Silk Shop..."

"So it's Qiuchan's sister-in-law." Ding Atao finally came to her senses. However, although she and Jiang Qiuchan were close friends, she had no usual dealings with this Jiang family mistress. Why come to visit suddenly? This didn't fit etiquette. Moreover, the situation outside was turbulent; it was better to avoid trouble.

"Go tell her: Master is not feeling well and cannot see guests. Please ask the Eldest Mistress to go back first, and we will pay a visit to receive instructions another day."

Ah Chun went to deliver the message but returned shortly, reporting:

"Mistress! The Eldest Mistress of the Jiang family says she came for an urgent matter. She also begs Master and Mistress to save her family, saying this matter involves Jiang Qiuchan!"

Since the matter involved Jiang Qiuchan, Ding Atao couldn't help but care. she knew a bit about the Jiang Mistress's character—quite snobbish and usually looking down on their family. If it weren't for some urgent matter, she wouldn't come to the door to ask for instructions.

"In that case, invite her in."

As soon as the Jiang Mistress entered, she fell to her knees with a *plop*, clasping her hands: "Madam! I beg you to save our family!"

Now, not only was Ding Atao shocked, but Li Wensheng was also confused. Ding Atao hurriedly said, "Eldest Mistress, why be like this! Get up and speak slowly. Quickly, help the Eldest Mistress up!"

But the Jiang Mistress prostrated herself on the ground, crying and begging, refusing to get up unless Ding Atao gave her personal promise.

"Eldest Mistress, what do you want me to promise?" Ding Atao was increasingly baffled. "Please stand up and speak. If we can help, we will certainly help!"

Only after hearing this did the Jiang Mistress get up weeping and sit on a nearby chair. She rambled on, explaining the origin of the matter one by one.

It turned out that Jiang Qiuchan had not returned from the Three Generals' Office last night. Early this morning, a group of officers came and arrested Jiang Rongxian (her husband).

"...Only after spending money did I get news from a Detective Team member that his sister caused trouble and implicated my Master..." She cried again as she spoke. "The Detective Team people said this matter is huge; I'm afraid everyone involved will be hanged. That spendthrift sister-in-law..." She originally wanted to curse Jiang Qiuchan, but suddenly remembered that the only hope before her, Ding Atao, was her sister-in-law's boudoir confidante. If she angered her, this trip would be in vain.

"What?! Qiuchan was arrested?!" Ding Atao was shocked. To be honest, she didn't care if Jiang Rongxian was hanged. Qiuchan falling into unpredicted crime was the most important thing. After all, in her years in Wuzhou, Jiang Qiuchan was one of her few boudoir friends. Their affection was deep, and there were many things she could only tell her.

"Eldest Mistress, don't panic. Tell me the matter in detail," Ding Atao said.

"Yes, yes..." Seeing her grave expression, the Jiang Mistress knew there was hope, so she recounted the events from beginning to end, including her inquiries for news.

"...Our Jiang family has always been good citizens abiding by the law. It was so under the Great Ming, and it is so since the Senate came. Last time Chief Xie said there wasn't enough silver to buy grain and asked merchants to chip in, my family was the first..."

Although she rambled and wept while speaking, Ding Atao understood clearly: Jiang Qiuchan had been swept into a great conspiracy involving a plot to harm a Senator, so the whole city was searched early today, and the principals of the Jiang family were all arrested.

Ding Atao immediately connected this to Teacher Hao's arrest last night—wasn't this Teacher Hao recommended by Jiang Qiuchan? He was also the tutor for Qiuchan's son! Could it be about the matter on Teacher Hao?

Thinking of this, she couldn't sit still either. This Teacher Hao had worked in her home for so long; if he was truly involved in some "rebellion" case, how could her family stay uninvolved?

She had no heart to listen to the Jiang Mistress's rambling anymore and said, "I will discuss this matter with my Master later. As long as my family can help, we will help! Don't lose your footing."

Sending away the Jiang Mistress, Ding Atao was anxious in the room, turning in circles. She wanted to wake her husband and ask for clarification but worried about his health. She had to consult Li Wensheng. Li Wensheng persuaded, "Mistress, don't worry. The Australians follow rules in doing things; they won't easily convict people, nor will they wrong good people. For a while, neither Mr. Hao nor Qiuchan and the others will be in trouble. We don't need to rush this moment. Master will wake up by noon at the latest. It will be easy to ask then."

Zhao Fengtian was busy with aftermath matters all morning. After dawn, the scouts Qian Duo sent to Sanhezu returned, reporting that Sanhezu had been breached last night. Most of the captives and refugees in the camp had fled, and some were killed. Of the retained personnel responsible for management and guarding inside the camp, not one in ten remained; some were killed, some fled.

"...Some also went with the bandits."

Zhao Fengtian nodded; this was also expected.

According to a preliminary count by the collection team sent by Qian Duo, the Sanhezu camp currently had less than eight hundred people left, mostly women, children, and the elderly. There were more than five hundred corpses in the camp, and the rest had mostly fled. The camp was basically destroyed. Half the buildings were burned, and supplies and tools in the camp suffered heavy losses.

"Who attacked Sanhezu?"

"It was a group of bandits, actually not many in number. But the camp was attacked from inside and outside," Qian Duo frowned. "Jiang Yougong was blown to death as soon as the battle started..."

"Blown to death? Did the bandits bring cannons?" Zhao Fengtian remembered the cannon sounds rising and falling outside the city last night.

"The bandits didn't have cannons, but they brought a lot of gunpowder..."

Zhao Fengtian still couldn't imagine it because the Sanhezu National Army Squadron's camp was a closed fortress; it was impossible for bandits' combat power to approach for demolition.

"He took some medicine or something and ran into the Sanhezu camp to 'listen to opera'!" Qian Duo spat. "Later we found out, he went there to sleep with actresses! In the end, instead of sleeping with the actress, he was blown sky-high by a local bomb planted by an insider directly! Truly damn well deserving of death!"

Before a major mission, the Squadron Leader of the Third Squadron and Warden Liu Youwang were actually "listening to opera" and "playing with actresses." Hearing these details, Qian Duo was astounded beyond measure. he had long heard vaguely that there were "problems" over at Sanhezu, but he didn't expect the problems to be this big!

"Listening to opera? You mean the opera troupe Liu Youwang set up?" Zhao Fengtian immediately remembered the opera chests the Chief had ordered sent out, and his head swelled a size larger.

"Yes, that opera troupe," Qian Duo said. "I'm not clear on the specific situation yet. The camp is chaotic, and many people ran away. But Liu Youwang can't run away from this!"

"How is his condition?"

"He was injured during the explosion and was buried under rubble, but he actually picked up his life (survived)! But the number of dead in the camp is vast; corpses are everywhere. The Third Squadron's ramparts weren't lost, but more than half the men were dead or wounded. This squadron is basically scrapped. It's going to be a spectacle when the grain fleet arrives today."

"Whether it's a spectacle or not is another matter." Zhao Fengtian said heavily, "We have so many debts we don't worry, and so many lice we don't itch. How much worse can it get? Sanhezu is a key location. The Third Squadron's ramparts must be repaired as soon as possible—after the First Squadron returns this time, let them take over the defense and rest and reorganize while they're at it. The Second Squadron will switch to patrolling."

"Then there will be only one company left in the city during the day..." Qian Duo said.

"Although the Third Squadron suffered heavy losses, the framework is still there. Fill up the Third Squadron; they can still handle sentry duty and patrols in the city. Just train them up slowly."
