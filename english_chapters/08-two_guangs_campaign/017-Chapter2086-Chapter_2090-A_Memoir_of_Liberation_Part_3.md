# Chapter 2086 - A Memoir of Liberation (Part 3)

After roll call, I went with my fellow conscripts to the armory to draw armor and weapons. "Armor"—the iron scales were rusted beyond recognition, the fabric lining completely rotted. A bit of force tore it apart. Weapons? I received a long spear, its point so rusted it had gone dull. On a battlefield, it probably couldn't kill an enemy—the shaft would snap first.

The good armor and weapons had long since been issued by the officers to their own household retainers and bodyguards. To them, we common soldiers were just cheap cannon fodder, servants accompanying the army. Looking the part was enough.

I was furious and argued with the warehouse keeper—this junk wouldn't even be worth scrapping, yet we were supposed to fight with it? The keeper said haughtily: "This is what there is. Take it or leave it. Want better? Have your family prepare your own!" What kind of talk was that? In the Fubo Army, any logistics officer who pulled such a stunt would face a court-martial and execution.

That reminded me of something Uncle Jizai often said: "What does your court have to compare with the Council of Elders?" Indeed—what could they compare? These soldiers who couldn't even stand properly? These corrupt, degenerate officers? These weapons that couldn't kill a mouse? Pathetic yet hateful: knowing they couldn't match the Fubo Army, the false Ming authorities spread wild rumors to slander the Council and the Army, hoping to stir fear and bind the people to their war chariot. They claimed the Fubo Army won battles through sorcery and therefore kidnapped boys and girls to sacrifice to evil gods. They said the Australians were sexually depraved and kidnapped virtuous women for unspeakable acts. All of Zhaoqing was in a panic. Even worse, rumors circulated that Fubo Army guns and cannons were made with dark magic, and that if women and girls stood at the front lines, lowered their trousers, and exposed their genitals toward the Fubo Army, the weapons would explode on their own. They called this the "Yin Gate Array." Utterly preposterous! Firearms owe their power to the Council's superior steel, complete manufacturing processes, correct gunpowder ratios, and well-trained soldiers—not to feudal superstitions that insult our sisters. Yet this nonsense, which any modern elementary student would scoff at, found a ready audience among Zhaoqing's populace and officialdom. Markets panicked, especially when the government requisitioned women's menstrual cloths and chamber pots. Many women, fearing they'd be seized for the "Yin Gate Array," hid at home like cloistered ladies, not daring to step outside. For a time, women vanished from the streets entirely.

Once we became soldiers, the officers said each of us would receive one tael of silver as a "family settling allowance"—essentially blood money. But we never saw it. Only after Zhaoqing's liberation, during the public trials, did we learn that Xiong Wenchan had actually distributed the funds, but officers at every level had embezzled them. Public outrage erupted. The relatives of soldiers killed in the outer defense perimeter—widows and mothers—stormed the platform in tears, holding spirit tablets, and literally bit the embezzlers to death, drinking their blood. The scene was shocking. I never received my settling allowance, but I didn't care. My only thought was to survive. The moment the Fubo Army arrived, I'd surrender—no way would I die for the false Ming.

After enlistment, we received useless equipment. There was no physical training, no tactical coordination—just running around following officers' orders: guarding gates one moment, hauling supplies the next, patrolling streets after that. Those were at least military duties, barely tolerable. What infuriated me was being forced to pack up the high officials' households for evacuation! Rolling up baggage so they could board boats and flee to Wuzhou!

The Fubo Army wasn't even in sight, yet these officials were already planning their escape. Remember, when Wang Zunde marched on Lingao, the Council's leaders—even the civilian staff—were prepared to fight to the last!

Big bundles, small baggage—we even hauled their tables and chairs onto the boats. The naval ships, instead of fighting, were ferrying the masters' secondary wives, primary wives, young lords, young ladies, gold, and silver to Wuzhou—one boatload after another, along with forcibly requisitioned civilian vessels. We soldiers toiled like beasts of burden, getting yelled at by their stewards. Some who accidentally damaged goods were beaten half to death. We weren't the court's soldiers—we were just these officers' slaves!

To help the masters move, we were ordered to intercept civilian vessels at the docks and on the river. A single "nail-seal" requisition slip, and we'd seize a commoner's boat. No matter how they wept and pleaded—hearts of stone. Any more complaints and they'd be cut down on the spot, their heads displayed as "enemy spies."

Later, we were sent to the villages to conscript laborers—not for fighting, but because heavily loaded boats couldn't make headway upstream without trackers hauling towlines. These laborers were to pull the masters' boats.

This was originally the job of the Zhaoqing Prefect and Gaoyao County Magistrate, but their superiors complained they weren't conscripting enough and sent garrison troops to do it instead. At first, we still had the *baojia* headmen issue calls for one able man per household or draw lots. Officers could also squeeze some bribes on the side. But as villagers learned to flee at our approach, we couldn't fill the quotas anymore. We stopped bothering with headmen—just grabbed any male we saw, from sixty-year-olds down to sixteen-year-olds. Those who resisted were killed on charges of "collaborating with the pirates." Some thugs used the chaos to rape and plunder; villages were thrown into chaos. Eventually, walled villages refused to open their gates at all, even firing fowling pieces and crude cannons at us. Once they even killed a *zongqi*—dead and never investigated.

The chaos of that era is unimaginable to people today. Let me describe one incident that left a deep impression.

After Guangzhou Prefecture was liberated, many refugees flooded up the West River from the Pearl River Delta—mostly officials, gentry, and wealthy merchants, but also common folk of modest means who believed the rumors. All traveling with families and valuables, hoping Zhaoqing, the Governor-General's seat, would be safer. Many of the hired water-fighters had been river pirates. They colluded with naval thugs to intercept boats fleeing from the Sanshui area in Antelope Gorge. After looting and raping, they killed everyone—even women and children. I saw with my own eyes a thug returning from a raid, proudly showing off a handful of gold and silver jewelry—among them several longevity locks, still stained with blood.

Such atrocities—massacring women and children—actually aroused "envy" among my fellow soldiers. Many who'd farmed honestly their whole lives were lured onto the path of robbery and murder. Several of my childhood playmates thus became military bandits and walked a road of no return. In the end, they lost their lives and brought their families under suspicion as bandit relatives. The old society didn't just devour lives—it devoured conscience.

These dark, chaotic days became unbearable. I yearned ever more desperately for the Fubo Army to arrive, counting the days, wishing they'd strike Zhaoqing like lightning tomorrow and catch all those vermin in one net.

The darkness before dawn is always brief. A little over a month after Guangzhou's liberation, on April 2 by the new calendar, Uncle Jizai secretly told me the good news: the Fubo Army was about to attack Zhaoqing! He told me to be ready—"Whatever you do, don't die for these people." I said: "Don't worry, Uncle. I remember it all. When they order me to charge, I'll move slowly. Once the government troops collapse and the Fubo Army comes, I'll drop my weapon and surrender immediately." Seeing that I remembered his instructions, he nodded with relief and hurried off on his own business. I quickly found my comrades who'd enlisted with me, and we discussed the surrender plan clearly. They unanimously agreed we mustn't die for the false Ming—when the time came, they'd follow my lead. All they wanted was to go home alive. Honestly, whether under the false Ming or the Fubo Army, I was a soldier. As a soldier, surrendering without a fight is undeniably the shame of shames—no amount of whitewashing changes that. But I've never regretted my determination to surrender at that time. What I will say as a result of self-reflection is this: after I joined the Fubo Army, I never retreated a single step on the battlefield.
