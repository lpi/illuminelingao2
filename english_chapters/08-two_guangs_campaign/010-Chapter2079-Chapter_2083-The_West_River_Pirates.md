# Chapter 2079 - The West River Pirates

"This sort of thing is inevitable. Even in the old time-space, military supply trains were pillaged by thieves—there were even organized robberies of military trains." Xi Yazhou said, "To be honest, if they steal a bit of grain or carry off some bedding, it's not critical. What matters is that our weapons and ammunition don't fall into outside hands."

"That hasn't happened yet. But as our military shipping increases, similar incidents may well occur." Hong Huangnan said, "Currently we're transporting ammunition and weapons separately. Though it can't one hundred percent prevent losses, at least it minimizes the consequences of any loss."

"So bandit suppression is still essential." Xi Yazhou said. All along this journey, the military pressure hadn't been great; every concern focused on "security." "What's the pirate situation on the West and North Rivers? What do you know?"

"River pirates are as thick as fur," Hong Huangnan said. "And the situation is complicated."

The river pirates of the West and North Rivers were dominated by the Xu, Zheng, Shi, and Ma clans of the boat-dwelling Tanka people. Their power extended throughout the West and North River basins; their followers and vessels were numerous. They could control and influence many Tanka boat folk throughout the region—their reach was sky-high.

"Basically, anyone in this trade at any scale, whether Tanka-born or not, has to attach themselves to one of these four surnames and pay regular tribute," Hong Huangnan said. "Boat operators also have to pay them tribute—otherwise they'll end up with their boats destroyed and lives lost."

When the Fubo Army liberated Guangzhou and pursued the enemy through the Pearl River Delta, that had been the river pirates' "golden age." Crowds of officials and gentry fleeing the Delta's prefectures and counties, dragging families and loaded with valuables, had scrambled toward Zhaoqing and elsewhere. The river pirates enjoyed an unprecedented "feast"—every sortie brought back women, treasure, and silk. Even the boat operators carrying the refugees had openly and covertly made tidy profits through theft and robbery.

"...When we first arrived at Sanshui, the river surface and sandbars were covered with corpses—all victims who'd gotten the 'knife-noodle dumpling treatment.' The pirates had made their fortunes; the boat crews saw red and started robbing their own passengers. Anyone who resisted got thrown in the river... Hearts in troubled times..." Hong Huangnan shook his head as he spoke of these events.

Still, since the Fubo Army reached Sanshui, pirate activity in this area had dropped sharply—not only because Joint Logistics ships had strong hulls, powerful guns, and tight security, but mainly because once warfare erupted, merchants stayed home, and the flow of people and goods ceased. Without business to conduct, boat operators had nothing to do. When pirates roamed the riverways now, they could at most rob a few fishing boats or ferries—slim pickings.

"...Though activity has decreased, their strength remains intact. If someone incites them to become 'political bandits' and launch deliberate waterborne attacks against us, our escort forces will be stretched thin."

Currently, Joint Logistics' cargo transport was guarded mainly by its own security personnel and vessels dispatched by the Navy's Pearl River Squadron. Generally, one or two armed medium or small landing craft escorting a convoy was enough to ensure safe passage. Encountering scattered pirates, a few shots would drive them off. But escort forces weren't strong.

"Clearly, we need to accelerate bandit suppression—" Xi Yazhou said. He recalled Hong's earlier proposal to establish garrison commands along the depot lines under Joint Logistics' control, unified to handle bandit suppression and escort duties along the route—avoiding the coordination failures and poor cooperation inevitable when riverside counties each handled their own sectors.

Hong Huangnan said: "River pirate suppression should really recruit some locals familiar with the river situation. Headquarters needs a concrete policy. From what I understand, the river situation is extremely complicated. Besides professional pirates, fishermen, day laborers, and boat crews all exist in a 'gray area'—killing, plundering, and theft are just part of their daily life. How to calibrate our approach requires careful consideration."

Hong Huangnan then briefed him on the supply convoys he'd organized. Besides some standardized vessels brought from Hong Kong, the transport ships currently sailing the West and North Rivers were mainly locally requisitioned from boat operators at Sanshui—minimizing vessel redeployment.

For the East River basin's supply, Joint Logistics used vessels requisitioned in Guangzhou. Guangdong's boat operators were concentrated primarily in Sanshui and Guangzhou; both places had large numbers of transport vessels.

"So we're not short of ships or sailors. But as I just said, these people have long existed in a 'gray area.' Untransformed, they carry heavy old habits and are very hard to discipline."

"When you use their vessels, how much freight do you pay? Is the funding you've been allocated enough?" Xi Yazhou was somewhat worried.

"General Xi, I'm requisitioning labor service, not hiring," Hong Huangnan said.

The cost of requisitioned vessels was merely the daily food consumption of sailors and helmsmen, plus periodic repair materials. Beyond that, Joint Logistics spent nothing.

"You operate this way—the boat crews don't protest?"

"Protest? My requisition system is the most preferential possible," Hong Huangnan said dismissively. "The Ming dynasty also requisitioned vessels—that was called 'nail-sealing': an official would nail a document to your deck, and off you'd go on imperial service. Forget freight payments—you'd even provide your own food. If your boat sank, tough luck. If you were seized for battle, losing your boat and life wasn't unusual."

"You're just comparing to worse..."

"It's a world of comparing to worse. I won't mention other things: right now, commercial shipping on the West and North Rivers has almost completely stopped. The boat operators' vessels sitting in the water would just rot. Even if crew and helmsmen aren't paid wages, they still need at least a bowl of thin gruel—that's all cost. Real silver flowing out. Now that they transport cargo for us, at least they don't have to feed the crew themselves. If a boat is damaged, we repair it. If a vessel is destroyed, we compensate. Just these few points make this the most benevolent policy in centuries."

"How cooperative are the boat crews?"

"Very cooperative," Hong Huangnan said. "The biggest boat operator here is named Chen Hongyi. When Thorpe passed through Sanshui on his staff tour of the West River, this Master Chen even sent over a banquet." He chuckled. "Of course, the banquet was ostensibly for the accompanying Embroidered Guard officer, but Master Chen had assumed Thorpe was some big shot from the capital. When he later heard it was actually an 'Australian pirate,' his jaw nearly hit the floor."

"Why else would they call him 'Thorpe the Magnificent'?" Xi Yazhou said.

"Ever since learning there was this connection, Chen Hongyi suddenly became extremely enthusiastic. Not only does he keep asking me to put him in touch with Thorpe, he keeps sending gifts for me to forward as 'respects' to Thorpe."

"He certainly knows how to network!"

"Doesn't he!" Hong Huangnan shook his head. "But to navigate these West River waters, you do need some tricks."

"What's he like as a person?"

"A typical feudal gang boss," Hong Huangnan said. "Crafty, wary, patriarchal-minded, loyal to his word. But utterly ruthless."

"That's quite vivid."

"Want to meet him? His home is just outside Sanshui County, not far from here."

"No need," Xi Yazhou said. "How many boats does he have?"

"Over a hundred forty—with about two thousand sailors and helmsmen. He's a local tyrant on this West River. Very reliable in getting things done. Though few of his people can read, they really know how to move cargo. Moving grain or supplies—one order, and whether it's consolidating shipments, on-and-off loading en route, however complex the arrangements, whatever the types and quantities... they rely on verbal communication and hardly ever make mistakes."

"Traditional trades all have their own tricks," Xi Yazhou said. "I'm confident in this sort of person's competence. But since ancient times, those in the boat trade have never been good people. 'Cart, boat, inn, porter, broker—innocent or not, they deserve to die'—people who make their living among them are none of them easy marks. You're requisitioning their vessels now, which means using their sailors. Be careful they don't use our name to harass the common people."

"I'll pay attention to that," Hong Huangnan said. "When all those heroes were making their fortunes on the West River recently, I'm sure Chen Hongyi's men had their share."

"If they didn't, I'd find that strange. But that's the past. We won't pursue it. For the future, you'd better keep a close eye on things—and start building up your own fleet. Joint Logistics can't always depend on Navy vessels."

Hong Huangnan's expression brightened slightly: "You're right, General. Inland river shipping is heavy on tasks, complicated in operations, and highly specialized. It really needs a dedicated organization to manage it."
