# Chapter 2161 - Pursuit Planning

Zhu Si suddenly understood Mi Longtao's intention: he wanted to pursue the bandits and wipe them out in one sweep.

But the forces assembled at Xugang were really quite small—they had no advantage in numbers and no advantage in weapons.

His face paled a bit, and he stammered: "Perhaps... perhaps we should request that Yunan County also dispatch forces to coordinate..."

"I've already sent word. But with the round trip, by the time they arrive they'll only be doing cleanup." Mi Longtao said, "Still, that's fine. With the enemy concentrated in force, this is a good opportunity for a combined sweep." He pointed at the map with one hand. "Though the enemy has fled, there aren't many routes they can take in this area. Before entering Xugang, I already sent the Investigation Squad and scouts to track them down..."

As he spoke, a runner hurried over and whispered a few words in his ear. Mi Longtao's eyes lit up. "Where is he?"

"At the Declaration Pavilion. He says he escaped—he's wounded!"

"Good. Let's go have a look." Mi Longtao rose and told them, "A villager just came to report that a large body of bandits has arrived in his village and is resting there. Let's go assess the situation together."

"Yes, sir!"

Because one of his arms was injured, Mi Longtao had trouble handling the map; Zhu Si hastily helped him fold it up.

When they arrived at the Declaration Pavilion, a crowd of villagers had already gathered outside, craning necks and standing on tiptoes to peer inside. Village militia held back the crowd. Seeing them approach, the men quickly cleared a path.

Inside the pavilion, several soldiers and guards watched over a gaunt, dark-skinned man slumped on a long bench. A medic was busy bandaging him; several village elders stood in the courtyard looking on.

"This is the one. He ran all the way here and collapsed outside the gate—the militia carried him in." The sergeant on scene reported. "He caught an arrow. The medic is treating him."

"Is he conscious?"

"Yes." The sergeant said, "We searched him. No weapons."

Mi Longtao nodded. "Bring him here. I have questions."

From the brief interrogation, they learned the man came from a small hamlet called Lizui. About half an hour ago (two meals' worth of time), a gang of bandits had stormed the village, rounded up all the inhabitants, and forced the women to cook while they rested.

"...All the villagers are being held in the ancestral hall. When I ran, they shot me with an arrow and I passed out. They thought I was dead, and that's how I got away..."

Mi Longtao said nothing, exchanging a few low words with the Fengchuan Investigation Squad captain. Then he asked: "How many bandits?"

"I was running—didn't get a clear count. About two hundred."

Mi Longtao signaled for the man to be led out. He then questioned local villagers, opening the map to point and compare. Zhu Si and Li Dong didn't dare interrupt.

"Come look," Mi Longtao beckoned them over.

"I just asked the locals. Lizui is a small hamlet about two and a half kilometers from here—only twenty-odd households. A few days ago, the residents scattered to take refuge in larger fortified villages with militia. Only some elderly and infirm who couldn't or wouldn't leave stayed behind."

"Is the informant reliable?" Zhu Si asked.

"Good question." Mi Longtao nodded approvingly. "There are refugees from Lizui here in Xugang. This man is definitely a Lizui native—ordinarily just a common villager, not a dubious character."

"So the information is genuine."

"Yes. This enemy group is probably part of the force that besieged Xugang and ambushed us. I intend to destroy them!" Mi Longtao said. "What do you think?"

Since Mi Longtao had said so, Zhu Si and Li Dong could only express agreement.

"Immediately send a few men to conduct reconnaissance near Lizui!" Mi Longtao issued orders. "Also, find some more Lizui villagers to interview—get details on the local situation!"

Before long, they had gathered considerable intelligence from Lizui refugees, and an apprentice ensign had sketched a crude map.

From the map, Lizui was a small basin set among low hills, surrounded on all sides except for a lower gap on the north. But the map was quite primitive—no contour lines or similar markings; it was barely more than a rough diagram.

"According to the locals: the hills are low—mostly under ten meters—with gentle slopes, not a major geographic obstacle. They're planted with fruit trees, with a few other hardwoods. The surrounding terrain is similar: large areas of flat land dotted with hills of varying sizes. Between the hills are mostly paddies, ponds, channels, and streams. In terms of terrain alone, the hamlet is very well concealed—which is one reason some residents didn't want to leave and take refuge."

"Honestly, if the enemy decides to hold out, attacking would be tough on us," Li Dong said.

Though the hamlet itself was indefensible, the surrounding paddies and wetlands actually favored the defenders. An attacking force could only advance along a single village road and a few paddy dikes; however many troops you had, you couldn't deploy them. And the Beiwei Army's firepower advantage would be hard to bring to bear.

"You're right," Mi Longtao agreed with his assessment. "But though attacking isn't easy for us, it's also hard for the enemy to run."

In this kind of terrain, a defending force trying to retreat had only one route available too.

"We just need to flush the enemy out of the village—then they'll be easy to hit." Mi Longtao checked the sky. "Has the Yunan County force arrived?"

"Not yet!"

"Too slow." A displeased expression crossed his face. He turned to Zhu Si. "I need to borrow the mountain howitzers from your boats."

"No problem. The guns and ammunition are all in good order—ready to fire at any time." Zhu Si nodded repeatedly. He had a fair idea of Mi Longtao's plan: most likely he intended to mass all the shipboard artillery for a barrage of Lizui, then drive the enemy out of the village with a single charge and intercept them along the escape route.

By a little past four in the afternoon, the scouts who had gone to Lizui returned.

"...There are about two hundred-plus holdouts defending the village. They've concentrated their defenses at the village entrance. They've positioned firearms on the surrounding hills—wooden cannons and various guns. Security is tight; we couldn't get close enough for detailed reconnaissance." The scout pointed at the marked-up map. "But the enemy hasn't built fortifications. It looks like they're ready to run at any moment."

"You all heard—the enemy situation isn't complicated," Mi Longtao said. "I estimate the enemy is holed up there waiting to slip away under cover of darkness. There's no time to lose. We move out now."

The task assigned to the Wuzhou Composite Company was to assault Lizui from the front, while Mi Longtao's force lay in ambush on the enemy's escape route to intercept the routed troops.

"How does this sound? Any problems?" The plan took full account of each unit's equipment, combat capability, and the enemy situation. The enemy's morale was low; the National Army had artillery support; the assault shouldn't meet too much resistance. In contrast, the troops fleeing the village would be fighting like cornered beasts, so the more elite Beiwei regulars and mountain warfare company would do the blocking.

For Zhu Si, however—whether storming the village or intercepting on the road—neither was a good assignment. The Composite Company was poorly equipped and undertrained. Any fight was likely to be a hard one. But he dared not show any reluctance; instead, he declared he would "absolutely complete all missions."

"I'll have the Xugang militia send some men to support you," Mi Longtao said. "Make as much noise as possible."

"From here to the village entrance is at least half a *li*." Zhu Si stood on a small hillock, scanning through binoculars.

The entire Wuzhou Composite Company, plus three mountain howitzers and about a hundred able-bodied men from Xugang, were now gathered in the woods on this hillside.

Li Dong said nothing. Through his binoculars, apart from a haphazard barricade of furniture and debris at the village entrance, there were no real defensive works—just a few sloppily dressed bandits loitering behind the barricade.

But on the hills flanking the entrance, in the trees, he could make out figures moving—and even the wooden cannons and matchlocks they had set up in the undergrowth.

"...There are enemy positions on both flanks," he reminded Zhu Si.

"I can see." Zhu Si said irritably. "Small cannon, matchlocks—well equipped, aren't they? If we march up there in formation, one volley will kill or wound half of us!"

Li Dong's heart sank. He understood Zhu Si's concern. Sending the Composite Company on an assault like this was an uncertain proposition. In the Beiwei Army, he had been just a soldier—orders were orders, no discussion. But now he was a National Army officer. Though his status was lower, behind him stood over a hundred brothers' lives. If a battle ended in a carpet of corpses, even if his superiors didn't hold him accountable, he couldn't live with himself.

How should they do this? He pondered silently, continuing to observe through his binoculars. He noticed that the enemy firepower on the hills was concentrated near the village entrance; the other areas had no firearms deployed.

"Captain, our men can't fight straight up—a frontal assault would be cut down by a single volley. I suggest we split our forces: one column attacks the front to draw the enemy's attention, while I lead another column around to the flank and work our way up from there..."

"What nonsense!" Zhu Si snapped. "Flank! Over there it's all paddies you sink into and can't get out of, or else channels. Before you and your men can crawl out of the mud, there won't be any bandits left in the village!"

"Let the soldiers go barefoot. A lot of the lads in the company are locals—many grew up working paddies; they can manage." Li Dong said. "I can lead the group around quietly first. As soon as Lieutenant Mi's side fires the signal rocket, we launch from both sides simultaneously..."
