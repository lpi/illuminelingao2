# Chapter 2281: Each Harboring Thoughts

Cai Lan returned from Dragon Mother Temple, spirit in trance; shortly after returning to Three Headquarters she used excuse of "body unwell," slept early. Even the painting Xie Erren brought to her she didn't look again.

Painting, Senator Xie said he painted himself, but Cai Lan looking once knew, this wasn't his handwriting.

She of course didn't reach level of knowing person by seeing painting, but Senator Xie’s brush characters usually written were all leaning east and falling west, naturally impossible to paint a landscape painting.

Although knowing not painted by him, yet Cai Lan these days more or less had some affection for this man. Woman's state of mind sometimes was so strange. Although man before eyes counted as "Enemy Killing Husband," yet he didn't calculate her assassinating on street, also let her have a footing place in drifting and loneliness, living comfortably. Speaking fairly, that tenderness and considerateness Xie Erren treated her with, no second man in this world ever gave her.

Today her conversation with Yi Haoran, however hooked up hatred originally starting to fade—if not for Australians rebelling, how would she reduce to this, becoming an unclear lowly dirty woman!

However next how is good? Although Yi Haoran didn't say what he wanted to do, but intention wasn't hard to guess: he hiding in city, also devising to see herself, naturally not for returning some fan, but for Great Ming. Cai Lan thought, unexpectedly inside this Wuzhou city still had such loyal gall and righteous guts scholar! Since these days, what she saw and heard, all were disciples bowing and scraping to Australians. Now surprisingly had such a hero, for Court actually willing to brave strange danger. Heart couldn't help admiring secretly.

Cai Lan lay on bed for long time, yet eyes burning, always couldn't fall asleep.

Because she slept badly at night, as long as Xie Erren didn't come to stay overnight, she often called Qiuchan to accompany sleeping—she was lonely and helpless here, Qiuchan also newly lost husband, two people pitying each other in illness, actually could talk very well. Having her accompany at night, could slightly relieve sense of loneliness and distress.

Jiang Qiuchan heard her breathing heavy, knew Cai Lan didn't fall asleep, so comforted: "Miss Cai, today went out strolling for a day, watch already started, rest early..."

Cai Lan shook head saying: "I'm not tired." Saying so draped clothes getting up from bed. Staring blankly at night sky outside window, suddenly asked: "Aunt Jiang, how do you feel about this person Mr. Hao?"

"Is a good person." Jiang Qiuchan answered without thinking.

"Yes, is a good person..." Cai Lan's eyes blank, "Pity, not measuring own strength."

"Not measuring own strength?" Qiuchan started, not understanding why she said so.

"En, not measuring own strength."

"What happened to Miss?" Qiuchan didn't know what exactly Yi Haoran said to Cai Lan today, could it be that Chang Qingyun was some "Key Criminal"? She busy said: "Not measuring own strength, just treat he spoke a few crazy words..."

Cai Lan shook head, asked again: "Aunt, how did you know that Mr. Hao?"

Jiang Qiuchan heart started, how could matter of this Mr. Yi killing chaotic soldiers back then be said! Forced smile saying: "He is my maiden family relative, counting generation is my cousin uncle..."

"You don't deceive me anymore." Cai Lan said, "Mr. Hao is fundamentally not your cousin uncle."

This made Qiuchan panic spirit; just about to open mouth, Cai Lan said: "You don't need to fear. Speaking of this Mr. Hao, time I knew him was much earlier than you—he originally was staff under Governor Xiong, wasn't he?"

Qiuchan got even more flustered now; half a moment later said: "Maybe. I only knew he was advisor in yamen in past..."

"This is it." Cai Lan’s eyes burning with spirit, "Speaking of it, he and late husband also counted as colleagues."

This matter Qiuchan knew, just didn't know why she suddenly mentioned these matters in pitch black night. Unconsciously somewhat heart panicked.

"So speaking..."

"Aunt rest assured." Cai Lan said leisurely, "Although I am a woman wanting no face, conscience hasn't gone bad yet."

Qiuchan breathed a sigh of relief slightly, forced smile: "I trust Miss!" She was anxious to diverge topic, said: "Time not early, rest early."

Xie Erren had not gone to Cai Lan’s place to stay overnight for a week continuously. One, he was already somewhat tired of her. After psychological pleasure of conquering passed, solely speaking from joy of bed, Cai Lan wasn't a suitable partner. Two, documents like snowflakes flying to desk before eyes, work of him as Wuzhou Mayor was really not good to do; truth to tell, heavy affairs work wasn't quite suitable for a literary old youth like him.

Since he presided over administration in Wuzhou in April, now three months already passed; in aspect of construction could be called achieving nothing; originally grand "Wuzhou Commerce Revitalization Plan" already became waste paper because of Guangxi war affairs. Wuzhou market was still half dead. He this Wuzhou Mayor rather than saying local administrative chief, better saying Station Master of Fubo Army station; most important thing every day was coordinating water and land transshipment matters of endless supply teams.

Front line war affairs smooth, messy things in rear were emerging one after another. Especially since Yao Chaos broke out in April and Guangxi’s "Indulging Soldiers as Bandits," he in rear not only had to be responsible for material transshipment, but also "Suppress" locality. Finally entering August, large scale bandit riots were basically suppressed; West River shipping route resumed smooth; although still couldn't lack armed escort, compared to condition of beacon fires everywhere few months ago already improved.

But he couldn't relax for a moment; although following Fubo Army advancing towards Guangxi and local security improving, Wuzhou market compared to when just recovered few months ago had some improvement, generally still very desolate. Besides selling grain calculating mouth, families needing relief were more and more; local since pontoon bridge and city wall repaired, had no imminent projects needing to do anymore; "Work as Relief" then declared emergency. Fortunately Wuzhou was transportation hub; Station Department established large scale station here, recruiting quite a few local unemployed labor, making work as relief able to maintain.

A few days ago, Zhu Fuyuan of Dachang came to Wuzhou secretly, informing him about plan of transferring grain. Although specific grain distribution didn't need him to handle, ten thousand *dan* grain water transported to Wuzhou, still had to distribute out from Wuzhou; various aspects involved inside all needed him to coordinate and arrange—once thinking here, Xie Erren’s head was about to explode.

And this grain problem, happened to be most urgent thing right now, even could say concerning overall stability; in case some loophole appeared, he in Senate need not think about others anymore, waiting for same treatment as Old Zhang mixing food waiting death share.

This day, he busied in office for half a day; resting for lunch at noon, only felt head dizzy brain swelling. Thinking himself hadn't been to Cai Lan’s place for this week, unconsciously somewhat missed. Although he had no much emotional foundation with Cai Lan, guarding lonely city alone, affairs busy, only her place still had a shred of tenderness to comfort.

"Old Zhao!" He shouted once.

Zhao Fengtian answered voice coming: "Chief."

"You send a person to Three Headquarters side, notify, say I will go over in evening."

His office and dormitory were both set in Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen; every time going to Cai Lan’s place all needed to notify in advance, letting servants prepare for welcome, also had to add guard personnel supervising preparation work of food and lodging.

"Yes, Chief." Zhao Fengtian just about to go out, Xie Erren called him again:

"Was my painting sent over?"

"All sent over." Zhao Fengtian said.

"What did Miss Cai say?"

"Didn't say anything. But she doesn't paint often recently. I asked her what request she has, she didn't say either."

"Oh, not painting is also good." Xie Erren nodded, "Just having no amusement, afraid she will think wildly again."

"That Aunt Jiang used recently, actually suited her heart! Often keeping her by side overnight; feeling mood recently also better much. having a person speaking accompanying is different after all."

"Since so, next month raise some wages for this Aunt Jiang—I heard she is a widow, also bringing a child, not easy."

"Came not even a month, saying raise is too fast. Anyhow pass three months then say."

Xie Erren smiled, this Zhao Fengtian really kept house! He thought and said: "Then won't raise wages, next time bring some candies for her child."

News of Xie Erren coming immediately transmitted to Cai Lan’s room. Servants in Cai Lan’s room then busied up.

Although house was swept daily, at this moment still had to sweep again; Senators loved cleanliness; stains and dust people accustomed to were hard to tolerate for them. Yet century old mansion like Three Headquarters was hard to keep tidy. So staff of Xie Office would do comprehensive cleaning before every time Xie Erren visited.

After cleaning finished, maids and servant women exchanged bedding, also placed a big block of ice in room—this ice was transported from Guangzhou over thousands of *li*. Pajamas Xie Erren needed to use at night, clothes for changing after bath were all prepared properly. Coolies carried well water, pouring into cast iron enamel bathtub transported from Guangzhou; fire worker outside started lighting fire to heat water.

Cook sent from Municipal Office General Affairs Section brought ingredients, preparing right in Three Headquarters kitchen—Xie Erren adhering to literati hobby, was relatively particular about eating. But Wuzhou after all was front line city, he couldn't be too extravagant either; eating simple for usual work, coming to Cai Lan’s place was "Relaxation"; diet men women, eating and drinking naturally had to be more particular.

Jiang Qiuchan helped changing flowers in room—Senator Xie liked this tone; selected a landscape "Autographed by Chief Xie" to hang up, lit incense. Also served Cai Lan to bathe and change clothes.

Cai Lan bathed, wiped dry hair, applied light rouge and powder. Jiang Qiuchan just about to fetch dress, Cai Lan suddenly called her.

"Aunt Jiang, just bring that set of clothes Master sent for me to wear."

Jiang Qiuchan was startled; that set of clothes she said had been sent for long time; this Miss Cai never opened to look once, how suddenly remembered to wear?

This set of skirt and dress was "Song Clothing" Xie Erren ordered from Shop 82. This so-called "Song Clothing" actually was "Hanfu" female Senators brought.
