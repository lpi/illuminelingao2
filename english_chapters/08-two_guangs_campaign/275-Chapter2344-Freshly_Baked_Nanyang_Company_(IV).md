# Chapter 2344 - Freshly Baked Nanyang Company (IV)

Forty-three ships although not considered many, but for Southeast Asia trade in history not considered few either. According to Dutch records, in 17th Century Chinese merchant ships going to Batavia every year were at most fifty sixty in many years, only ten twenty in few years. At that time China-Southeast Asia long-range trade volume was only this much.

Arrival of Senate more or less changed this historical situation. Senate's massive import export trade, specially huge demand for bulk commodities, made quantity of ships coming and going increase drastically. And future once several resource colonies in Southeast Asia opened, demand for transport capacity would only increase further. Matter of increasing shipping tonnage should start to proceed from now.

Planning Academy gave him a gift, that was two Manila Galleons captured from Spanish hands in Hunger Action initially. Tonnage of these two ships not to say in Southeast Asia Company fleet, even placed in whole East Asia, Southeast Asia region were large ships second to none. *San Louis* load 800 tons, displacement 1450 tons, *San Raimundo* load 650 tons, displacement 1200 tons.

Since captured in 1632, after experiencing year-long maintenance and modification, these two ships were compiled into Joint Logistics directly subordinate transport fleet in 1633, executing various "Strategic" transport missions for long term. Round tripping between Jeju, Sanya, Kaohsiung etc. After Continental Strategy started, executed emergency transport missions to Guangzhou many times again.

However, *San Louis* and *San Raimundo* although carrying capacity very large, hull sturdy durable, but limited by Galleon ship type and sail rig defect. Speed too slow. Under fair wind condition, maximum speed only 7 knots. Average speed not exceeding 4 knots. Loading unloading ability also far inferior to T800 specially optimized for freight. Key was crew needed ridiculously many, when far sailing each ship needed at least two hundred people to operate normally. After Joint Logistics fleet transport capacity enriched, Minister Hong "loved new loathed old", Nanyang Company opened, these two ships were eliminated from Joint Logistics to Zhou Wei's hand.

Zhou Wei frankly speaking also looked down on these two dumb-headed big ships—this ship style although stylish, compared to later large sailing battleships like "Sovereign of the Seas", "Victory" appeared much clumsier, also couldn't install too many cannons—Galleon essentially was still merchant ship.

But having better than not having, saying nothing else, in whole Southeast Asia Company fleet there was no ship bigger than these two. Largest few Chinese Sail ships full load displacement didn't exceed 800 tons either. Now these two ships currently already entered dock in Hong Kong for maintenance work. Estimated to officially put into use by next year.

"Re-modified still a Galleon," Zhou Wei shook head not without regret, put down ship registry. In heart, what he wanted was Clipper, in his view, this kind of fast merchant ship designed by British to transport tea met his demand most.

In his heart, future Nanyang Company not only wanted to dominate sea trade of whole Southeast Asia region, but also imitate past events of British East India Company, capturing Indian Subcontinent, making it a jewel on future crown of Senate.

Ordinary sailing ships, coming and going between Southeast Asia and China counted as qualified, but running India, even farther Red Sea route was beyond ability. Speed of six seven knots at best could only satisfy trade in this "Inland Water" sea area of South China Sea. Going to India and Red Sea coast, even further arriving East Africa all needed ships faster, suitable for ocean voyaging.

Zhou Wei was in trance; someone came in to report: Wang Kai came.

"What does he come for?" Zhou Wei was somewhat strange. This person served as Trade Commissioner in Ministry for long time—frequently shuttling between various ports coordinating trade and shipping plans, rarely in office. In Colonization and Trade Ministry could only count as nodding acquaintance. But he knew Wang Kai was very fanatical about navigation. In *Uncharted Waters* era except 1, 2, 3, 4 all knew like palm, played unknown how many times. But he and Zhou Wei didn't have much social intercourse, let alone friendship.

*Probably preparing to come to Nanyang Company to display grand plan?* Speaking of which not impossible. After all this person's obsession degree for navigation was obvious to all. Initially when Bopu Shipyard was still a beach shipyard he ran to shipyard all day long. He also participated in managing a "Great Navigation Club". Hasty launching and rotting tail (unfinished) of *Lichun* initially, all had inseparable relationship with this club's advocacy.

Since just setting up separate portal someone came to insert incense and join partnership, was also a good omen. Zhou Wei immediately said: "Invite him in."

After a few minutes, a slightly fat slightly balding glasses man appeared in Zhou Wei's office, carrying a fake brand briefcase in hand.

Two people exchanged few polite words then sat down individually. Wang Kai looked around, sighing: "Unexpectedly Southeast Asia Company is actually so shabby!"

"This counts as not bad. Initially we worked in containers. Anyway this is a proper house." Zhou Wei saying took out a box of "Golden Nanhai" from drawer, "Come one branch (have one)?"

"No, no," Wang Kai shook head hurriedly, "Drinking wine is okay, smoke forget it." He saying put briefcase down carefully, as if containing some precious thing inside.

Zhou Wei took one, lit fire puffed a mouth. Actually he had no interest in tobacco products, couldn't experience nicotine happiness either. But since Senate produced Cigar, this kind of thing held in hand having ritual sense obtained his favor. After all when discussing problems holding one in hand, sucking a mouth from time to time, then spurting curling smoke, not only appearing calm and composed in momentum, but also could leave sufficient thinking time for himself before speaking.

"Container that was matter of which year," Wang Kai said, "Southeast Asia Company is important enterprise of Senate radiating Nanyang, actually just this treatment, some people too not put the Sea in eyes!"

Southbound Faction people opening mouth not three sentences definitely dragging to "Short-sightedness of Executive Committee", "Unprofessionalism of Administration Council" such topics. These few sentences out, knew was own people. Next definitely was turning into demonstrating topic of "Going South is Senate development important opportunity".

However Wang Kai didn't develop according to this routine. He instead opened door seeing mountain (straight to point): "You now new shop opening, I want to come to your place."

Zhou Wei nodded, this was in expectation. Speaking of which, his so-called Nanyang Company right now was his one-man company, indeed needed a few Senators joining to discuss grand plan together. Wang Kai engaging in sea trade for many years, professionally indeed was person he needed.

"Welcome!" Zhou Wei nodded, "I need people here right now, just inside Ministry..."

"Old Si over there doesn't matter, I say a word is enough." Wang Kai carelessly said, "I propose transfer, can he not release person?"

"Words not wrong. But work in your hand..."

"These few days I grasp time to handover is enough." Wang Kai said, "One week time sufficient."

"That's good." Zhou Wei said, "I am right at the time of building team now, coming here do you have any work intention?"

"Me well, Colonization Trade Ministry profession is engaging in trade, to Nanyang Company can also do this. But I prefer doing some exploration work, like Portuguese sailing along African coast back then, landing at a place, doing some business with natives, looking for resources worth developing..."

"Then count as Exploration Division," Zhou Wei saying frowned again, "We are company, cannot use official names like Division (Chu), Section (Ke), how about calling 'Development Department'. You serve as Development Department Manager."

"I don't care," Wang Kai waved hand, "You love calling whatever is fine, as long as let me do these. Saying he opened briefcase, taking out a few documents handing to Zhou Wei.

"You look at memorandum I wrote, this is some of my thoughts on company ships."

Zhou Wei thought this was rare, himself just considering company ship configuration, this Wang Kai ran over first thing was talking about ship! Let's see what specific thoughts he bas.

Receiving document in hand, front as usual had a lengthy analysis on Nanyang trade and navigation status—this was also consistent habit of these people turned bald by papers. Zhou Wei skipped this part directly reading main text regarding ships.

Turned out Wang Kai mentioned two types of ships he "Designed" or rather calling "Improved" in memorandum.

First type, he named "Surprise" (Jingcha). Its prototype was old spacetime "SS RJ Hackett" wooden hull steam powered bulk freighter, used for bulk cargo transport in North American Great Lakes region.

"SS RJ Hackett" length 63.84 meters, width 9.88 meters, depth 3.81 meters, ship form square upright, space very big, registered total tonnage close to 1500 (4245 cubic meters), could load 1100 tons heavy cargo. According to plan "Surprise" would install Lingao self-produced 500 horsepower steam engine, heavier than prototype ship steam engine, could also reach 10 knots speed.

Bulk ship biggest advantage was fast loading unloading, of course corresponding cargos were also like ores able to withstand rough operation. This ship's wide thick hull could handle rapid currents of lake region very well. Even on sea, had good seaworthiness.

Bulk cargo was main source of Senate current foreign trade, including coal, rice, timber and various ores to purchase transport in future plan. While currently ships owned by Senate, almost none suitable for these bulk cargo ship types. Loading unloading time long not saying, often needed large amount of extra packaging. Bulk cargo like coal, til now still mainly relied on *Big Whale* this coastal barge brought from old spacetime to transport. This "Surprise" only existing on paper obviously fit Nanyang Company requirement very much.

Only pity this ship needed steam engine. Zhou Wei knew, with industrial sector capacity, high power steam engine had to queue at Planning Academy. Most optimistic estimate also had to queue one year to get goods.
