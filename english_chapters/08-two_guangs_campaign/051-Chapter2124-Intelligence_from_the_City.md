# Chapter 2124 - Intelligence from the City

Using four companies to cordon off and capture over ten thousand refugees was quite a stretch. Fortunately, refugees moved slowly at night, and with no light and nowhere to run, they usually stopped and waited to be collected as soon as a dozen soldiers showed up with torches and called out.

Each company had plenty of veterans who had participated in Operation Engine; they had a knack for managing refugee collection. With only bayonets for coercion, they herded the refugees together; for a while, wails rose on all sides, with cries of "Mercy, Australian master!" filling the air. It took a full four hours to escort the more than ten thousand refugees to the eastern foot of Beishan, where three companies guarded them. By then, it was already dawn.

Zhu Quanxing was overwhelmed—he had to arrange the assault while simultaneously dealing with the refugee problem. The reserve forces and civil affairs cadres were on the move, preparing to take over this mess.

Just as he was swamped, a runner reported that an old man among the refugees who had left the city insisted on personally delivering a letter to him.

"He says it absolutely must be handed over in person."

"Search him and bring the letter." Zhu Quanxing had no interest in listening to an old man ramble. If this was about "pacifying the people" or something, he had no time to waste.

"He says he was sent by Lone Wolf!"

Zhu Quanxing paused. He knew about Lone Wolf—an intelligence operative planted in Wuzhou by the External Intelligence Bureau. Not long ago, he had even sent signals from the city walls.

That changed things.

"All right, bring him." Zhu Quanxing said. "And report to Chief Xu—have him come at once!"

Sun Sancai was from Shandong, a refugee collected during Operation Engine. Because he was tall and strong, he had been recruited into the Army. Now Sun Sancai was a sergeant and squad leader. But his combat record was slim—apart from a handful of bandit suppression operations, Sun Sancai had never truly fought a battle. It wasn't until the Mainland Offensive that he finally saw real action. He had hoped to kill enemies and win great merit on the battlefield, so he could advance, get rich, and bring honor to his wife and children.

But to his surprise, from landing all the way to Wuzhou, Sun Sancai hadn't fired a single shot—he had just carried his rifle and traveled by boat the whole way. That killed half his ambition to make his mark.

At Zhaoqing, he had heard that over ten thousand Ming troops were massed at Wuzhou; there would surely be a great battle. Sun Sancai was excited, thinking his chance had finally come. But to his dismay, once they reached the battlefield, his company's first combat mission was... intercepting refugees who had left the city.

Now the refugees were penned in at the eastern foot of Beishan, surrounded by barricades of wire and stakes. They sat on the ground while medics made the rounds, providing simple bandaging for those who were injured. Sun Sancai's company had received new orders: guard duty around the perimeter of this makeshift refugee encampment.

Sun Sancai was in a foul mood. If he spent the whole time watching these refugees, he wouldn't get to fight at all. At this rate, when would he ever get promoted?

Grumbling was one thing; orders still had to be followed. That was "iron discipline." Sun Sancai didn't dare slack off; he led his men on patrol along the cordon. In particular, they had to watch for anyone "making trouble" inside the refugee crowd—such things had happened before. Even among "fellow sufferers," and even on the brink of survival, the law of the jungle prevailed in refugee camps: robbery, brawling, rape... every kind of crime.

Suddenly, an old man pushed through to the cordon, waving his arms and jabbering in a tongue Sun Sancai couldn't understand. It only soured his mood further. He barked: "Stay in line!"

The old man was none other than Li Wensheng, the elderly manager under Luo Yangming. Though Li Wensheng was a shopkeeper, he only spoke Cantonese Mandarin. Sun Sancai, being from Shandong, naturally couldn't understand—apart from the new standard language used in the military, he only knew his hometown dialect. He couldn't even communicate in the western three prefectures, let alone here in Wuzhou.

Because "New Speech" was the common tongue in the military and he rarely interacted with outsiders, Sun Sancai knew almost nothing of Cantonese Mandarin.

Li Wensheng grew more agitated, even trying to climb over the barrier. Sun Sancai reflexively raised his rifle and pushed Li Wensheng back with the bayonet.

Li Wensheng remembered his master's instructions. Steeling himself, ignoring the warnings from those around him, he pushed forward again, waving frantically and shouting that he wanted to see the chief.

Sun Sancai still couldn't understand a word. Seeing the old man being obstinate and disorderly, regulations called for "enforcement measures"—using the bayonet directly wasn't allowed, but the rifle butt was right there. He flipped his rifle around and gave the old man a solid butt-stroke.

Li Wensheng took the hit squarely, toppling to the ground with a thud. The refugees around him stirred, quickly backing away.

But Li Wensheng was nothing if not persistent—"entrusted by another, faithful to the end." After taking the blow, he immediately scrambled back up and resumed shouting.

Now Sun Sancai was truly annoyed. He ordered: "Tie him up! Stuff some grass in his mouth!"

"What's going on here?"

Sun Sancai turned to see Platoon Leader Lin Gongyong. He snapped to attention and saluted: "Reporting, Platoon Leader! An old man refusing to obey orders and causing a disturbance!"

Lin Gongyong was originally from the Lin clan of Baitu Village—by the genealogy, a nephew of Lin Xianming and a younger cousin of Lin Gonglao. After the Baitu Village expulsion, the Lin clan had been scattered; some had been relocated to Sanya, some remained in Lingao. As the territory under the Council of Elders expanded, both branches were further dispersed. Lin Gongyong's father, being a shipwright, had been moved to Kaohsiung, and the whole family now worked at the local naval shipyard.

Because Baitu Village had once serviced ships from everywhere, its villagers knew multiple dialects. After moving to Kaohsiung, Lin Gongyong interacted with people from all corners and could speak not only his native Hokkien but also Lingao dialect, Qiongshan dialect, and Cantonese—all without an accent others could detect. It was precisely this linguistic talent that had gotten him into the NCO training program before the Mainland Offensive.

He understood Li Wensheng's words. Hearing him repeatedly shout that he wanted to see the chief, Lin Gongyong found it odd—"Chief" was a term of respect for members of the Council of Elders, not widely known in this border city between Guangdong and Guangxi. How did this old man know it? He calmed Li Wensheng in Cantonese, asking what the matter was.

Li Wensheng, finally encountering someone who understood Cantonese and could speak it, was beside himself with excitement. Ignoring the gleaming bayonets all around him, he lunged forward, seized Lin Gongyong's hands, and wouldn't let go, repeating: "I have important intelligence for the Australian chiefs."

"What?"

"Please tell the chief—I have intelligence from Lone Wolf!"

At the word "intelligence," Lin Gongyong didn't dare delay. He immediately pulled Li Wensheng aside for questioning, but the old man refused to say anything beyond "I have important intelligence for the Australian chiefs" and "I was sent by Lone Wolf."

Lin Gongyong worried this might be a Ming spy who wanted to get close to the chiefs for an assassination attempt. He had the soldiers search the old man thoroughly—even undoing his hair bun—but found no weapons. Apart from some odds and ends, there was only an ordinary family letter.

He turned the items over and over but couldn't see anything unusual. Finally, he ordered the man held in isolation and sent a runner to report to battalion headquarters.

Li Wensheng was placed in a tent, sitting nervously on a camp chair. Beads of sweat the size of beans had formed on his forehead. He felt that in all his years, he had never been this anxious.

A soldier with a bayoneted rifle stood just outside the tent—if he tried to escape, he would certainly be shot without hesitation. His master had long done business with the Dachang Rice Company, and it was an open secret that Dachang was backed by the Australians. Anyone in Wuzhou's rice trade had to deal with Dachang, and naturally knew some of the stories.

If his master dealt with Dachang, perhaps he had some connection to the Australians that couldn't be openly discussed. His master never said, and Li Wensheng never asked—that was his master's private affair. But Li Wensheng didn't know the Australians' full background; to protect his master, it seemed wiser to reveal as little as possible. So he simply stopped talking—apart from what his master had instructed, "I have important intelligence for the Australian chiefs" and "I was sent by Lone Wolf," he said nothing else.

After a long wait, a sedan chair arrived. Xu Ke, upon hearing that someone had brought news from Lone Wolf, immediately demanded that Zhu Quanxing have the man brought to the command post south of the city.

"Put him in a sedan chair and bring him at once!"

For ease of command, Zhu Mingxia had established a forward command post south of Wuzhou city; Changzhou Island served as the rear supply depot and troop rest area—Yang Zeng's 8th Battalion was currently resting on Changzhou Island. Preliminary counts of the collected refugees came to over eighteen thousand, mostly elderly, children, and women; some able-bodied men had slipped out in the chaos. These were held under separate guard to prevent Ming spies from hiding among them.

Zhu Mingxia was now deeply troubled: Xiong Wencan had really pulled off a masterstroke of passing the buck!

Wuzhou's flourishing trade meant most of its residents made their living from commerce and crafts, relying on the city's role as a hub for rice distribution from northern and western Guangxi. The big rice merchants were one thing, but most ordinary folk had no farmland or estates outside the city walls—and now they had nowhere to go. Whatever valuables they had carried were long since stripped by the soldiers who had expelled them. On top of that, Xiong Wencan had systematically requisitioned grain from the surrounding villages before the war, half-buying, half-seizing it. Most of the villages' stores could now barely sustain themselves; for these elderly, infirm women and children to find food was next to impossible.
