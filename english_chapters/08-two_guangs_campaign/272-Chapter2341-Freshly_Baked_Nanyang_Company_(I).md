# Chapter 2341 - Freshly Baked Nanyang Company (I)

"This isn't a F-king document, it's..." Zhou Wei held the file *"Reply on Establishing Nanyang Company"* in hand, flipping through again and again, "It's... It's..." He couldn't think of what vocabulary to use for a time.

"It's a gold mine!"

"Gold mine counts as a fart! This is wealth and merit for thousands of autumns and ten thousand generations!" Zhou Wei put down this document read by him unknown how many times, strictly word by word almost able to recite, excited uncontrollable himself. He leaned back, falling heavily onto the sofa in Nanhai Coffee House private room, lying facing heaven with limbs spread, truly not letting down these few months of his painstaking planning and secret operation! Lobbying all the way, making promises, pulling heads (recruiting)... Zhou Wei felt he wasn't much different from selling insurance or doing pyramid schemes.

A burst of wild laughter erupted from the crowd in the private room. They were all hardcore elements of Southbound Faction. Number not many. Among them were "Old South" constantly advocating "Empire's future is in Nanyang" since D-Day, also "New South" lobbied because of distress over stagnation, believing "Only going South can solve all current problems".

On the red sandalwood table in the private room, piled full of large and small wine bottles and dinner plates, a mess on the ground. Visible the liveliness degree of this gathering.

Whether "Old South" or "New South", at this moment the private room overflowed with a cheerful atmosphere. This successful internal operation made everyone have a feeling of "World is mine". What did this Senate's wealth count as? This Southeast Asia, and even North and South America were the true splashing-sky wealth.

First master the company, then master the Senate, finally master the whole Human Empire...

Just at this time, the private room's doorbell rang. Waitress came in to report: "There is a phone call looking for Chief Zhou."

"Oh, who is calling?" Zhou Wei crawled up from sofa, looking at the waitress at the door.

"It's from Organization Section, saying please go answer the phone immediately."

"Fart!"

"Let him wait!"

"Any big matter is more important than us celebrating now?!"

"Tell him, Chief Zhou has no time!"

"Right, tell him to come find Chief Zhou himself!"

...

Zhou Wei waved hand, saying: "I come immediately."

Saying that he pulled clothes hem clean, walking out quickly.

The telephone on this floor of Nanhai Club had a separate telephone room. After walking in he closed the door, only then picked up the phone.

"I am Zhou Wei."

"Hello, I am Ming Lang of Organization Section." Ming Lang's voice in the phone was exactly same as usually when they contacted, a kind of "friendly", but tone without any emotional color, "Do you have time between ten and eleven tomorrow morning? We want to talk with you alone."

"Have time, have time." Zhou Wei said hurriedly. A burst of ecstasy in his heart, *there is a door (chance)!*

"That's good, we settle it then: Tomorrow morning ten o'clock. Wish you work smoothly!"

"Serve the Senate and People!"

This cliché Zhou Wei said unknown how many times, this time he really counted as from bottom of heart. He finally was going to "Serve the Senate and People"!

Why Ming Lang called he knew clearly in heart. Just when Senate General Assembly passed relevant resolution, before formal document came out, he already started drafting the plan for newly established Nanyang Company.

He had written this plan long ago. Of course, in the past he wrote as "Colonization Division Chief", now since changing to company operation, naturally had to write according to commercial operation mode. This was a piece of cake for him. Back then in the bank he read countless such reports and plans. Completely knew how to write this plan beautifully and substantially.

Purpose of writing this thing was to apply for Chairman, General Manager or Director... etc. of the newly baked company. Regardless called what, anyway it was the position of sect master (leader).

As soon as job recruitment news appeared on internal website, he submitted his registration form and this heavy plan at the first time.

Although right now Southbound Faction was beaming with joy, a group of harmony. But before heavy interest everyone was equal. In case someone was plastic brotherhood, that would be bad. And judging from current situation, someone wanting to play the trick of two peaches killing three knights wasn't necessarily impossible—he didn't plan to make wedding dress for others after spending several years to get things done.

Making the plan solid and good himself left ample room for counterattack. Even if someone wanted to play tricks they had to weigh it.

Now it seemed, his planning ahead had effect. Ming Lang indeed came to interview him. According to normal organization process, after interview, appointment for him would be issued soon... Thinking of here, he couldn't suppress his joy.

From a mere Planning Academy clerk, empty-shelf Colonization Division Chief rising to National Policy Company Sect Master, this leap was historic for him personally, for his future whole family!

He returned to the private room calmly.

"What did Ming Lang say to you."

"He asked me to submit a detailed report on Colonization Division work..."

"This isn't under his charge either!"

"Is it Organization Inspection!" Zhou Wei said nonchalantly, "Should transfer me to Nanyang Company to take office soon."

From bottom of heart, he didn't want to tell everyone this news. After all before formal appointment came out there would still be many unknown factors. More people knowing, spreading out, heaven knew what things would happen.

But keeping mouth shut meant no go either. Everyone understood what Organization Section did. Wait until appointment publicity came out, these New South Old South would definitely feel he was "not enough friend (loyal)".

"Haha, maybe wanting you to be Chairman!"

"There is this possibility." Zhou Wei nodded lightly, "But Chairman is a bit high, those people in the Cabinet willing to let go?"

"Fart! If they unwilling to let go we force them to let go! Except you, who else is more suitable?"

"Correct, this victory fruit cannot fall into others' hands!"

"Except you Zhou Wei, we recognize no one!"

For a time the whole private room was chaotic. A group of people all immersed in this beautiful longing for future. Only Zhou Wei returned to thinking after experiencing temporary excitement.

 Taking office as Nanyang Company leader was already nailed on board. This was certainly a congratulable thing, but analyzing prospects carefully, difficulty was really not small.

He rose by relying on public opinion. If unable to hand out an answer satisfying the Senate quickly, especially unable to satisfy those long-term scarce materials in industrial sector, he would soon become a lone man.

The Senate's reply this time adhered to traditional routine of "Not Giving Resources Giving Policy". To a certain extent "Giving Policy" was better than "Giving Resources". Since wanting people to dig food themselves, couldn't restrict too much. How did old saying go? "Whoever F-king gives more money, I work for whom".

Judging from the document, this Nanyang Company obtained extremely large authorization: Counting down, except three core powers of Minting, Army Building and Diplomacy, almost obtained power of "Acting at Discretion" in all aspects. Force cannot be said not big. However compared to those few "East India Companies" currently running rampant in Southeast Asia, these powers were still far behind. Crucially, Southeast Asia Company didn't obtain the vital power of "Trade Monopoly".

Not obtaining Southeast Asia's "Trade Monopoly Right", meant they had to eat from same pot with current Foreign Trade System. Moreover they also had no right to expel those merchant ships of British, Dutch, Japanese etc. foreigners sailing to Sanya, Lingao, Guangzhou, Kaohsiung. They all sailed over under the banner of the Senate's "Free Trade".

"Engaging in Free Trade in 17th Century, this is F-king idiot behavior! Let Europeans earn how much money in vain!" Zhou Wei slandered this policy secretly more than once.

However slandering Trade Freedom naturally wouldn't do. After all this counted as Senate Consensus. And regular arrival of foreign merchant ships saved transport capacity to a large extent, lowering prices. Especially in these years Dutch East India Company transporting large amount of rice to Lingao could be said to have greatly relieved the Senate's food pressure.

Pity Dutch technology gap with Senate was too much. Senate could persuade Dutch to plant rubber and oil palm in East Indies, but had no way to tell them how to mine various non-ferrous metal minerals urgently needed by industrial sector. Even willing to teach hand in hand, Dutch might not have motivation to do this business of large investment and small profit. After all selling locally produced rice to Senate was easier.

Such bone-gnawing things naturally only we come to do, Zhou Wei roasted secretly.

However, the Senate gave him another opening. That is trade within whole Southeast Asia range, Foreign Trade Company wouldn't intervene. Nanyang Company could act at discretion. Organizing trade activities in Southeast Asia region autonomously.

As for army, he didn't care too much. All stationed-abroad stations had no army, but they could more or less pull some armed forces themselves. And once colony established, could establish armed forces in the name of organizing "Militia" perfectly justifiably. Simultaneously applying for National Army stationing. These National Army arriving in Southeast Asia would still be under company command all the same.

Minting power he himself didn't care either. Originally this wasn't something enterprise could ask for. And once colony and Southeast Asia local trade network formed climate, could also help Reserve Bank expand usage area of Silver Yuan and Silver Yuan Notes. Cheng Dong and others would only be more grateful to him.

As for Diplomacy, Senate had fart diplomacy now. Just sent a Consul to Batavia. Of course this wasn't anything either. What he was interested in was engaging in colony construction and mining, not signing some friendly commerce clauses.

Where should his first step land? As freshly baked Nanyang Company General Manager, Zhou Wei started calculating in heart. From deep in his heart, managing Vietnam had always been his main goal. And Senate had foundation in Vietnam. Besides Hong Gai Coal Mine, these years through trade and armed penetration, intervening in chaotic war between Northern and Southern Dynasties, already obtained quite a few interests in Vietnam.
