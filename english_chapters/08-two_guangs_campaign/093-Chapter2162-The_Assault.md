# Chapter 2162 - The Assault

Zhu Si calculated that even if the entire company pressed forward, the outcome might not be favorable. Having been a soldier for many years, he knew that having more men wasn't necessarily an advantage in battle—chaos leading to accidental trampling could cause heavy casualties instead. Since Li Dong's plan wasn't bad, he agreed immediately.

The two sides agreed on communication signals. The Composite Company would maintain the organization used during the boat transport, divided into Left and Right Detachments. Zhu Si would lead the Left Detachment in a frontal assault, while Li Dong would lead the Right Detachment in a flanking maneuver.

Li Dong gathered all the personnel of the Right Detachment and briefly explained the operation plan.

"Since we have to flank through water ponds and paddy fields, anyone who can't swim or can't go into the water should speak up now and swap with someone from the Left Detachment."

A dozen men who were either injured or couldn't swim were swapped with men from the Left Detachment.

Li Dong ordered all personnel in the detachment, except for the Nanyang rifle shooters, to leave their firearms behind and carry only spears and machetes. Backpacks and other gear were all left in place. He also collected all the hand grenades in the detachment and handed them to a few soldiers with the best throwing scores and the most courage. Each grenadier was assigned an ammunition carrier.

The grenadiers put the grenades in double-ended pouches and hung them around their necks for ease of movement.

"Everyone, take off your military boots! Roll up your trouser legs," Li Dong ordered. "Is there anyone with tender skin who isn't used to walking barefoot?"

This question amused the soldiers: "We're all born poor," "Never wore shoes since we were little," "Calluses are thicker than shoe soles."

"We've all worked in the fields; what are these paddy fields to us? We'll sneak over and give the bandits a taste of hand grenades first. Then let them see the power of our machetes!"

After Li Dong finished speaking, he led the troops into the woods, detouring westward to avoid the eyes and ears of the bandits on the hills. Meanwhile, Zhu Si instructed his soldiers to set up the various firearms Li Dong had left behind—regardless of accuracy, firing a concentrated volley first would never be wrong.

"Raise the muzzles of these broken pieces! Aim them all at the village entrance and the hills on both sides," Zhu Si ordered in a low voice.

The distance from the position to the village entrance was about five hundred meters, far exceeding the effective range of these miscellaneous firearms. Elevating the muzzles could increase the range, but the projectiles would essentially spray like a shotgun; it was hard to expect hitting specific targets.

However, although these projectiles lacked precision, they still retained enough lethality. If the enemy formation was dense, this kind of saturation fire could cause significant casualties.

Suddenly, a red rocket soared into the twilight sky—this was the signal that Mi Longtao's troops were in position. Zhu Si gave the order:
"Fire!"

Three 12-pounder mountain howitzers roared one after another. Soldiers could see with the naked eye black iron balls accompanied by red flashes flying out of the white smoke, dragging smoke trails as they struck the street at the village entrance. Soil, tree trunks, and fragments of various debris flew in the air; the barricades blocking the road were instantly pierced. Through the blur, moving human figures could be seen.

The miscellaneous firearms crackled to life. This time, the soldiers couldn't see the effect of the projectiles clearly, as white gunpowder smoke enveloped the entire forest. Zhu Si stood on the hill, nervously watching the village entrance through his telescope.

The village entrance and the hills on both sides were now completely shrouded in thick smoke, with only faint flashes of fire visible. Zhu Si looked in the direction of Li Dong's flanking movement, feeling a bit anxious in his heart.

Although he had three mountain howitzers, he carried very little ammunition—only twenty-four shells and propellant charges. As a contingency, at least one-third of the ammunition had to be reserved, so very little was available for fire preparation. Zhu Si ordered the artillery to fire three rounds first, and then the charge would begin.

If the shells and firearms failed to completely suppress the bandits, then after rushing into the village, they would inevitably have to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy—since ancient times, this has been the touchstone of soldier organization and morale. Unfortunately, Zhu Si had absolutely no confidence in this.

"That kid Li Dong, where exactly has he flanked to?" he cursed silently, anxiously searching for the Right Detachment's signal with his telescope.

To avoid being spotted by bandit sentries, Li Dong led the Right Detachment in a rapid leap-frog advance westward for over a hundred meters, entering a hilly area before circling toward the flank of Lizui. He chose his route very carefully, avoiding country paths and field ridges. instead, he cut directly through the paddy fields, "frog-jumping" from one hill to another, or using the mulberry hedges by the fish ponds as cover to constantly approach the village.

The Right Detachment's rapid flanking maneuver seemed not to have attracted the enemy's attention. The soldiers, barefoot and lightly equipped, passed through the muddy paddy fields. When they encountered rivers, they swam directly across, unexpectedly flanking to the west of Lizui.

The hills to the west of Lizui were more "perilous" than imagined, featuring "cliffs" seven or eight meters high—in reality, they were only about sixty degrees steep. One could climb up bare-handed by grabbing onto vegetation. Looking up at the hill, apart from various fruit trees, there were mulberry trees, lush and dense.

"Luo Mao!" he called out softly.

"Here!"

"Take a few men and go up first to have a look. If there are sentries, capture a live one!"

"Roger!" Luo Mao nodded, casually handing his rifle to another soldier, and led a few men to climb up the cliff using both hands and feet.

In just a moment, Luo Mao poked his head out from above, signaling that it was safe. Then, he threw down a rope. The soldiers of the Right Detachment grabbed the rope and soon all climbed up.

Li Dong was the first to go up. Luo Mao whispered that the bandits had only two sentries there; one was killed, and one was kept alive.

The captive was immediately brought over. Li Dong took a look; the man was tall enough but scrawny, with messy hair and clothes tattered beyond belief. His hands were tied behind his back, showing not a shred of the heroic air of a Greenwood outlaw; instead, he cowered, not daring to look up. Li Dong had encountered many bandits along the way. Although their appearances varied, their ragged and sloppy image seemed to be cut from the same mold. Amidst his disdain, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity—what kind of banditry was this...

"How many people are in the village?"

"Two hundred... more than two hundred..."

"Why are you hiding here?"

"We didn't dare leave during the day, afraid we couldn't get away. We're hiding here waiting for dark."

"Are you Han or Yao?"

"Han! Han!" The captive was deeply afraid of being associated with the Yao people. "There are only a few Yao in the grooup, all using poisoned crossbows..."

Li Dong had many questions he wanted to ask, but the immediate task was to deal with the enemies in Lizui. He continued to ask:

"Where are they gathering?"

"Most of the brothers are over by the village ancestral hall. I was sent here to keep watch..." Seeing Luo Mao's gleaming machete, he hurriedly added, "Just now they said... the Aussie... grand army arrived. I saw many brothers rushing to the village entrance."

"Apart from that village entrance, are there other roads out?"

"Over the northern hillock, there's a small path..."

"Is it guarded?"

"Yes, yes, there are brothers guarding every spot. I dare not lie."

"How many people?"

"Fifty each on the north and south roads, both led by chiefs. The head boss is resting with the remaining brothers at the Shenming Pavilion."

Li Dong wanted to ask more, but suddenly a red rocket shot up into the sky—this was the signal Mi Longtao had set for the operation to begin. Moments later, the rumbling sound of cannons rang out from the south of the village: Zhu Si had started the action as planned!

He couldn't bother interrogating for further details and ordered: "Take him down!"

"Grandfather spare—" Before the word "life" could leave his mouth, Luo Mao stuffed a walnut gag into his mouth and dragged him away.

"Assign someone to watch him, don't let him die!" After saying this, Li Dong waved his hand: "All units, move out!"

The Right Detachment silently passed through the orchard on the hill, and seeing the terrain start to slope downward, Li Dong signaled to stop. He personally led a few men to quietly creep forward. Below the slope lay the streets and houses of Lizui Village. Right at the bottom of this slope, close to the road, the bandits had converted a pigsty into a gun emplacement. Inside, two wooden cannons were mounted, pointing directly at the village entrance to the south. A dozen bandits, holding swords, spears, or bows and firearms, were hiding behind the emplacement, their attention entirely focused on the road coming from the south. They had absolutely no idea that someone would circle around from behind the hill.

"Listen up," Li Dong gathered the squad leaders and section leaders. "Zhu Si is attacking from that side now, attracting the enemy's attention. We have the perfect chance to catch them off guard."

The two squads of the Right Detachment each formed a column three men wide. Each squad was led by the most combat-experienced sergeants and veterans. Riflemen and grenadiers were at the very front, launching the assault in a skirmish line.

"Upon engaging the enemy, riflemen fire two volleys first, then grenadiers throw a wave of grenades. Afterwards, the whole unit charges in column formation. Act fiercely, don't hesitate for a moment!"

After assigning the combat plan, he drew the command saber from his waist and whispered: "Everyone ready, listen to my command! Advance!"

The riflemen of the two squads first passed through the orchard and appeared on the slope. Then, the soldiers in the first three rows of both columns leveled their spears and marched through the woods in unison. Li Dong could no longer care whether the bandits below had spotted them; he walked on the right side of the formation, looking back every few steps, terrified that someone might lose their nerve and flee before the battle. The National Army soldiers, appearing suddenly without a sound, startled the bandits. Some tried to turn their cannons around, while others ran to the front of the emplacement waving weapons to resist. The Right Detachment's speed down the slope grew faster and faster, almost jogging as they charged toward the routed troops. The formation stretched out a bit, and Li Dong had to shout loudly "1, 2, 1" to make the riflemen slow down slightly for the others to catch up. As the distance closed, he discovered there were many more bandits in the emplacement than before, at least fifty. But the charge could no longer be stopped. Li Dong's heart beat faster and faster. He shouted, "Fire!!" and commanded the troops to accelerate and charge down the hill.
