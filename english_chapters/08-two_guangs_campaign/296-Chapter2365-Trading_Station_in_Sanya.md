# Chapter 2365: Trading Station in Sanya

The last stop of Xu Yanliang's trip to Sanya was the trading station of the Southeast Asia Company. There were few ships of the Southeast Asia Company with Sanya as their home port. In winter, there was almost no business, so only a dozen or so staff members stayed behind, responsible for guarding the warehouse, ships, and offices. Business activities had basically come to a halt. Most of the clerks had been temporarily transferred to terminals in other places.

The expense management of this Southeast Asia Company is quite strict. Xu Yanliang thought.

The person in charge staying at the trading station was named Tang Zheng. He was neither a captain nor a shareholder, but a genuine "cadre" appointed by the Senate. Xu Yanliang knew that the naturalized cadres serving in such companies were not just "one of us" so simple; they were very likely also hidden cadres of the Political Security Bureau. He could trust him completely.

After simply asking about the company's operation, he asked seemingly casually: "Where is your hometown?"

"My hometown is in Gaozhou Prefecture, Guangdong." Tang Zheng said, "That year I went to Nanyang (Southeast Asia) to do business and encountered pirates in the Qiongzhou Strait. Fortunately, I was saved by the Senate. But I lost my capital and couldn't do business anymore, so I simply stayed."

"No wonder you came here to take office; so you were also a merchant who went to Nanyang."

"Chief, you are laughing at me. For a merchant like me, the goods I carried were only a few bundles—a business that couldn't be smaller. Going to Nanyang is small capital and big profit. As long as nothing happens, one trip can feed the whole family for a year. But if natural or man-made disasters are encountered, the family is ruined immediately. That's how I stayed in Lingao." Tang Zheng was quite emotional. He followed the Hai family's ship to Nanyang back then and was robbed by pirates before leaving the Qiongzhou Strait. Although he was rescued in the end and saved his life, the goods were soaked by water and severely damaged.

"So that's how it is." Xu Yanliang nodded, "How many times have you been to Nanyang? What goods did you sell? Silk?"

"Five or six times in total. Silk requires too much capital; what I sold were food and daily necessities. Everything is lacking over there; something worth one wen can be sold for twenty or thirty wen."

Tang Zheng was a small merchant, so the places he went to were not the major Southeast Asian ports Xu Yanliang often heard of, such as Manila and Batavia, but some ports unfamiliar to him. Compared with the major ports where merchants gathered, business in relatively remote small and medium-sized ports was easier to do, and profits were higher. The downside was that safety was lower.

He was a merchant by origin and was very talkative. Xu Yanliang originally knew very little about maritime trade and basically got information from reading books and materials. Now listening to him talk about practical affairs and examples, it was vivid and interesting. Unknowingly, they talked for a long time. They also talked about the current operation of the Southeast Asia Company.

Xu Yanliang knew that the operation of the Southeast Asia Company was similar to taxi companies in the old spacetime. The company did not manage specific operations but was only responsible for management, taxation, personnel, and logistics. Specific operations were the responsibility of the captain. And this captain was either hired by the shareholder or was the shareholder himself.

He asked about the operation of the Southeast Asia Company's ships and how the operating costs were calculated. Tang Zheng said that the Southeast Asia Company now adopted a route license system. Ships subordinate to the company, if engaging in trade and not acting as carriers, needed to apply for a license from the company.

"It's the Command Flag of the past, right?"

"Yes, some call it that—speaking of which, it is indeed a flag." Tang Zheng said that this kind of license had two calculation methods: annual package and per voyage. The annual package was expensive but had unlimited voyages, suitable for routes run all year round; buying per voyage alone was cheaper, suitable for routes not run very often.

"I remember that merchant ships going to Nanyang usually could only make one round trip a year; can they make several trips now?"

"That's the old almanac." Tang Zheng said, "Now there are specialized navigation charts. As long as the captains run according to the navigation charts and run different routes according to the wind direction and ocean currents in each season, they don't need to wait on the pier for half a year and sail only when the monsoon rises. Besides, the sail rigging has also been improved, and they can sail against the wind, only slower. The problem now is that there are not enough competent navigators; most captains can't learn the new navigation technology..."

So that's how it is, Xu Yanliang thought. The new technology brought by the Senate had greatly promoted traditional maritime trade. Having been in the office for a long time, he had no concept of these progresses at all—and he still mingled in the Age of Discovery Club...

Thinking of this, his face couldn't help but burn slightly. He asked again:

"Then what is the price of this flag? If paid annually."

"Originally, it was two thousand taels of silver for large ships going to Nanyang, one thousand for medium ships, and five hundred for small ships. After changing to silver coins, it is calculated in yuan."

"That's quite a lot of money!" Xu Yanliang was a bit surprised. According to the data provided by Wang You, there are currently forty-three trading merchant ships running the Nanyang route. Even if calculated entirely according to the median, the income from "license fees" alone is 43,000 yuan per year. In fact, very few small ships run Nanyang trade; most are large ships. From this item alone, the Southeast Asia Company can sit and collect almost sixty or seventy thousand yuan.

With so much money, the net profit reported was only 27,000, and dividends to shareholders were over 10,000. This Planning Committee is really quite something.

"This money doesn't belong to the company." Seeing his surprise, Tang Zheng explained that the proceeds from shipping licenses had to be turned over to the fiscal and tax department, "...Our company can extract 20% of it."

"So that's how it is." Xu Yanliang thought that was more like it! Otherwise, the heart would be too black! He asked: "Are there other incomes?"

"That would be many, all bits and pieces." Tang Zheng enumerated them as if listing his family valuables. Besides various miscellaneous fees, another important income was the fee for the shipping operation certificate paid by captains acting as carriers. This was much cheaper, calculated annually. It also included the "vehicle and vessel tax" collected on behalf of the government. This also amounted to tens of thousands of yuan a year. The company's commission in it was 50%.

Xu Yanliang added and subtracted in his mind, knowing that the net profit on the Southeast Asia Company's statements was normal and didn't hide much. He couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed—he originally planned to challenge the fiscal and tax department to see if he could retain more money. Now it seemed impossible.

"Are these all the incomes? Are there any channels to tap more potential?" Xu Yanliang asked.

Tang Zheng laughed: "Chief, if talking about tapping potential, it can still be tapped. Those shipowners, which trip of Nanyang business doesn't earn thousands or tens of thousands. If you really want to get more money, just come up with some unconventional charging items. But Minister Si said in the past that the company was originally used to 'placate people from afar.' As long as it doesn't lose money in operation, it's fine. Don't be stingy and ask for money for everything—if they earn a lot, let the Tax Bureau go to them to collect income tax."

"Minister Si is right." Xu Yanliang didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Thinking, your words are light! Indeed, the Tax Bureau has a hundred thousand ways to "adjust income," and he did not doubt that the Senate could obtain a huge amount of tax revenue from these people every year. The problem was that this money wouldn't go into the pocket of the Southeast Asia Company.

But this also reminded him that there was not much potential to be tapped on the Senate's current Nanyang route. It was difficult for the newly established Nanyang Company to get rich just by relying on traditional China-Nanyang trade; it had to find another way. Not just routes, but also commodities.

He thought of bone china. Since this thing was developed, someone proposed to export it. However, export kilns in Fujian and other places had ample supply sources. Neither foreign trade companies nor the later established China Merchants Bureau had enough interest in this new product. After all, the production cost of bone china was much higher, and the output was not high enough. Except for a small amount exported as high-end porcelain, it did not occupy a large export share.

However, recently Engineer Qi developed a new process for bone china, which should be able to significantly increase output and reduce costs. The Nanyang Company could promote this product as a future main product.

Another commodity he thought of was "ice blocks." This business was not unconventional, but an old business in the old spacetime. In the 19th century, merchant ships from Europe and America trading in East Asia, having no goods to transport, were often stuffed with sawdust for insulation to transport ice blocks from Europe and America to India, East Asia, and Southeast Asia for sale, profiting handsomely.

In May 1833, American merchant Tudor sent the "Tuscany" carrying 180 tons of ice from Boston, sailing directly to Calcutta, crossing the equator twice along the way. The loaded ice had to remain unmelted for four months. The Tuscany arrived at the destination as expected. The people there saw natural ice as rare and a delicacy, so this first ship of ice made a huge profit, also making Tudor famous, and the ice transportation business between Boston and the Far East developed rapidly. Based on the experience gained in the Caribbean, Tudor built an icehouse in Calcutta and urged local Anglo-Indian mixed-race people to buy household refrigerators, cold drink makers, and the like; he took out apples, butter, and cheese refrigerated on the ship to share with everyone, trying to influence their eating habits.

Soon, Boston's ice reached everywhere and was successful everywhere. In 1846, Boston exported 65,000 tons of ice; ten years later, the total amount more than doubled, with 400 ship voyages, selling to more than 50 places including the United States, the Caribbean, South America, and India, China, the Philippines, and Australia in the East. Ice became an important commodity and a major cargo of New England in the world market.

Guangzhou, China's foreign port at that time, was also an important sales market for European and American ice blocks. Now the business in Guangdong was not for the Nanyang Company to do, but in places like India and Southeast Asia, the ice business was still completely blank.

Thinking of this, he suddenly felt like he had discovered a new continent and asked: "Is there a cold storage here?"

"Yes. There are several." Tang Zheng was stunned, thinking why the Chief asked about cold storage; this was only used by fishery cooperatives and food processing factories. They only bought some ice in summer to cool down, "If Chief wants ice blocks, I'll send people to buy them right away..."

"No need, just send someone to ask each ice house what their maximum output is and what the local demand is."
