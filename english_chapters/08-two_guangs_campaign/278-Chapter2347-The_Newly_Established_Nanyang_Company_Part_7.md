# Chapter 2347: The Newly Established Nanyang Company (Part 7)

"If we're looking purely at grain, we might as well go straight for Pathein in Burma—that's the largest grain trading port in the 17th century," Wang Kai said. "If we go for Prey Nokor, that place is a battlefield where multiple powers compete. If fighting breaks out, we'll have to expend extra resources..."

The current Mekong Delta, including the future site of Saigon, still belonged to the Champa Kingdom. But this Champa bore little resemblance to the ancient kingdom that once dominated the Indochina Peninsula. Since the era of Le Thanh Tong of Annam's Le Dynasty, border conflicts between Vietnam and Champa had been constant. Thanh Tong personally led an expedition that captured the Champa capital of Vijaya, splitting Champa into three small tributary states: Hoa Anh, Nam Ban, and Champa itself. In 1611, Nguyen Hoang conquered Hoa Anh and established Phu Yen Prefecture in the occupied territory. Nguyen Hoang died in 1613. On his deathbed, he instructed his clansmen: "To the north, Thuan-Quang has the danger of the Transversal Mountain and the Gianh River; to the south lies the solid protection of the Hai Van Pass and Non Nuoc Mountain. The mountains produce gold and iron; the sea yields fish and salt. It is truly a land for heroes to exercise martial force. If we can pacify the people and sharpen our soldiers to contend with the Trinh clan, it will suffice to build a foundation for ten thousand generations."

The remaining rulers of Champa had accepted the title of Viceroy of Cambodia and were theoretically vassals of the Khmer. Simultaneously, they declared themselves subjects of the Southern Nguyen. The Ayutthaya Kingdom, which ruled Thailand, also had designs on this area. Three parties were competing here. Intervention carried considerable risk. This was what worried Wang Kai.

Business hadn't even opened yet, and already there was debate about the direction of development—not a good omen. Thinking of the various proposals within the Southward Faction, Zhou Wei realized his future days would probably involve a great deal of verbal sparring.

Under a major premise, there were bound to be countless personal agendas. It would be difficult to satisfy everyone.

Xu Yanliang spoke up: "Only with multiple parties restraining each other do we have a chance. The King of Champa clearly understands his current situation; our entry into this game strictly benefits him. A few years ago, Ping Qiusheng of the Colonization and Trade Ministry went there and even signed a trade agreement with the local King of Champa. That agreement should still be valid."

"Is that the Ping Qiusheng who handles Japanese business?" Wang Kai asked.

"Yes, that's him. He went on the Southeast Asia expedition back then—visited Vietnam, Champa, and Ayutthaya. But he was most interested in Japan. Wore an *eboshi* all day long, playing at being a descendant of the Taira clan. Right now he's basically stationed in Japan..." Zhou Wei was rather dismissive of Ping Qiusheng's peculiar tastes.

However, Ping Qiusheng's Southeast Asia trip had effectively paved the way for the current Nanyang Company. At least if they went now, there would be someone to talk to locally.

"It's a pity he's not here—otherwise we could consult him. Senator Ping must have quite a few talents in his pocket from that area," Zhou Wei said with some regret.

"His original report should be in the Colonization and Trade Ministry archives. Just dig it out and take a look," Xu Yanliang reminded him. "As long as names are mentioned, check their current whereabouts. Transfer those who can be transferred. That'll help flesh out our personnel."

Xu Yanliang immediately issued a document requesting access to the relevant Ministry files. He suggested that since the Nanyang Company's first target was the Indochina Peninsula, they might as well apply for the Great Library to lead a special research project, extracting relevant materials to compile situation reports.

"Though historical materials on the Indochina countries aren't abundant, the historical events at major junctures are still relatively clear, along with trade patterns and the like. They'll prove very useful to us."

"You're right. The work at the Great Library is too leisurely anyway; this will keep them busy," Zhou Wei said. "Save them from always causing trouble internally."

Seeing Wang Kai looking somewhat dejected, he added: "As for the Pathein work you mentioned—we know nothing about Pathein. We might as well send a ship to scout things out first. After all, we haven't directly surveyed Burma yet."

"Burma in the 17th and 18th centuries was one of the minor hegemons of Southeast Asia. If it weren't for Taksin, whether Siam could have survived is anyone's guess," Xu Yanliang said. "Sending a ship to investigate is fine, but we must proceed cautiously. It would be more appropriate to find a Senator from the Remote Exploration Department to go."

"No—I think we should go in person!" Wang Kai said, unable to contain himself.

Zhou Wei certainly had no desire to go himself, but since Wang Kai had spoken up, it wasn't convenient to object: "Why don't you make the trip personally?"

"I'd like to, but I don't know how to sail..."

"Do you get seasick?"

"It's tolerable. I've taken boats often enough now that I'm somewhat used to it."

"Then that's settled! We'll find a ship specifically to take you."

"Safety must be thoroughly considered," Xu Yanliang said.

"The Senate has so many ships. Surely we can identify a few excellent captains. The Remote Exploration Department goes out exploring often; they should have candidates."

"Finding candidates isn't difficult—they're in the Southeast Asia Company."

"Who?"

"There's a female captain named Li Huamei..."

"You mean that female pirate!" Wang Kai remembered. "She seems to have become a naturalized citizen a few years ago."

"That's right. She's affiliated with the Southeast Asia Company. When we first circumnavigated Hainan Island to go to Sanya, she served as navigator. She's very familiar with routes to India and Southeast Asia. After naturalization, she also participated in Operation Overlord. She's an excellent captain—fully capable of this job."

"Have her come see me immediately." Zhou Wei had originally shown no interest in the Pathein inspection, but hearing that such a figure existed within the Southeast Asia Company, his enthusiasm suddenly surged. He immediately summoned Wang You.

Hearing that Chief Zhou was asking about Li Huamei, Wang You had an immediate answer:

"She's not in Lingao."

"Where did she go?"

"The *Hangzhou* went to Taiwan," Wang You reported. "It was transporting the 6th Taiwan Expedition Team for exploration."

"When can she return?"

"Probably about a month," Wang You said. "It depends on notification from the Remote Exploration Department."

A month was too long. All three felt somewhat disappointed. Wang Kai said: "Let's proceed first. We'll discuss the inspection when she returns."

"Why not find someone else?"

"No, no—I think she's perfectly suited," Wang Kai said. "For this kind of inspection work, we really need someone like her at the helm." He ordered Wang You: "Send a telegram to Kaohsiung. Tell her to report to Nanyang Company headquarters in Sanya immediately upon her return!"

Wang You hesitated for a moment: "Manager Wang, I can send the telegram. But isn't this a bit rushed? She'll be back around New Year's. After being away for several months, we should let her go home and rest..."

"Can't she work overtime?" Wang Kai said somewhat impatiently.

"Well," Wang You hesitated, "Li Huamei is Chief Qi's wife..."

"Chief Qi? Which Chief Qi?"

"Chief Qi Feng of the General Construction Company."

"So it's him!" The three exchanged glances. No wonder Wang You was so "considerate" about Li Huamei—the female pirate leader of yesteryear had become a Senator's wife! And the legal wife at that, not some life secretary!

Who would have thought that kid Qi Feng had quietly taken the female pirate home!

Though Li Huamei wasn't exactly a stunning beauty—years of life at sea had given her a somewhat "rough" appearance—she was, after all, a famous figure in the Senate. The aura of her notoriety still carried considerable weight. These few felt a mixture of envy, jealousy, and resentment stir in their hearts.

Xu Yanliang said: "Since she's a Senator's family member, we should still be courteous. How about this: send the telegram as planned, just say there's an inspection assignment on the Indochina Peninsula to offer her, and ask her to arrange her own schedule."

"I'll do it right now," Wang You said and turned to leave. Shortly afterward, he returned carrying several thick files.

"Chiefs, these are some detailed materials on the Southeast Asia Company's current situation. Please have a look." Wang You placed the materials on the table and pulled out the thickest one. "This is the company's secret roster. It has a classification level. Please verify the sealing wax and sign for receipt."

Xu Yanliang examined the sealing wax—it was intact. He nodded and signed.

Wang You was quite capable. He'd spent less than a week organizing the Southeast Asia Company's basic materials. This was partly due to the experience he'd accumulated as an advisor in pirate gangs for many years and the skills he'd honed. It also benefited from his time serving in Joint Logistics.

Though he had largely governed by doing nothing in the Southeast Asia Company's operations and hadn't played any active role, he was extremely thorough in managing assets and personnel. The summary tables and situation reports he presented were clear and detailed.

The three immediately divided the work of reviewing the Nanyang Company's capital. Zhou Wei was most concerned about ships; Wang Kai focused on money and goods; and Xu Yanliang cared most about employees.

In his view, whether ships or money, these could be resolved in the future. Only team building was truly difficult. As the Senate's HR specialist, he knew the Senate suffered from inherent deficiencies in its cadre corps—he had seen too many serious losses caused by naturalized cadres who were just filling slots.

Once the Nanyang Company was established, it would inevitably require a large number of cadres. Looking at the current situation with the Southeast Asia Company as a foundation, there was no shortage of maritime professionals for the time being, and some commercial talent existed. But management cadres for business operations were relatively scarce. Especially for future colonial pioneering in the Mekong Delta, management cadres with certain leadership abilities and prestige would be essential.

Such people weren't easy to find. Xu Yanliang flipped through the secret roster of employees and shareholders. Beneath each name, besides a photo, there was an introduction to their personal and family situation, along with a detailed biography. It was evident that whether shareholders or employees, most came from pirate backgrounds in the Fujian and Guangdong regions. Their political ratings were mostly unremarkable—just above the standard for normal use. Quite a few were still classified as "controlled use." He noticed that Li Huamei was also a controlled-use subject.

"This 'controlled use' has been controlled all the way to a Senator's bed. What exactly are they controlling!" Xu Yanliang silently complained. Qi Feng had probably insisted on marrying her—indeed, even heroes have a hard time resisting the beauty trap.
