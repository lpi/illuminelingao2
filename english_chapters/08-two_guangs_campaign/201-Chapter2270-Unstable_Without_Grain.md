# Chapter 2270: Unstable Without Grain

However, no matter how Yi Haoran fished for words to inquire, this Zhu Fuyuan steadfastly refused to reveal the purpose of coming here. Instead, he bragged about various "good policies" after Hair thieves conquered Guangzhou, which sounded dull and tasteless to Yi Haoran.

However, the more he was like this, the more Yi Haoran became suspicious. Right now in military chaos, disturbances along the West River banks were ceaseless. Neither land nor water routes were peaceful. There was no market to speak of, and the road was unsafe; how could a businessman run from Guangzhou to do business?

However, before he finished fishing for words, Ah Chun and Luo Yangming returned together. Yi Haoran noticed Luo Yangming was not surprised by Zhu Fuyuan’s visit. It could be seen that although it was the first time the two met, they revealed a feeling of being very familiar with each other.

This was really rare. Yi Haoran felt even more strange. But the boss wanted to talk business with the guest; unless summoned, he as an accountant had no reason to participate. He had to return to the account room.

Abnormality is a demon. Yi Haoran closed his eyes to rest his spirit in the account room, thinking more and feeling it wrong. This Zhu Fuyuan with deep Hair thief background running from Guangzhou to here must have a plot, absolutely impossible purely for doing business.

Just thinking about how to probe for information, Ah Chun came in, asking: "Master ordered me to ask Sir, how much silver and rice grain inventory are currently on the account?"

Yi Haoran was stunned: Really doing business?

Fortunately, business was light these days, accounts extremely simple; he knew the numbers by heart long ago.

"Cash silver on account is three hundred seventy-one taels three mace nine candareens four cash. Inventory regardless of category totals two hundred thirty-six *shi* seven *dou* one *sheng* three *he*. Accounts owed by people and owed to people not included..."

"Your number is indeed small." Zhu Fuyuan heard his numbers and said.

"To be honest, having my bit of family assets in Wuzhou City, now counts as a large household." Luo Yangming sighed, "Xiong Wencan was in Wuzhou for a month; merchants in Wuzhou City were tormented heavily by him. Not a few couldn't recover and closed doors to stop business."

"This matter, Chief told me. I came here wanting to investigate the specific grain storage figures in Wuzhou," Zhu Fuyuan said, "Chief told me this matter cannot be done by official face, have to investigate secretly."

"I can do this. But must have a name. Merchants are all very shrewd; no one is willing to reveal the bottom card right now." Luo Yangming smiled bitterly, "This doesn't blame them either. We business people, even if owing a butt-load of debt, still have to act like grandfathers when going out... Wuzhou experienced this disaster, many shop names pulled a deficit, barely supporting."

Revealing the bottom card, inevitably would be taken advantage of by others. In the turbulence of current times, there always would be some shop names surviving or even gaining development by swallowing their own kind. No one wanted to be reduced to the one being swallowed.

Zhu Fuyuan came from a shop assistant background, naturally understood this principle. He nodded: "Chief said, might as well put a fragrant bait."

"This fragrant bait has to be big enough and fragrant enough to work." Luo Yangming said.

"This matter will be grasped by you. Also good for your future status."

Zhu Fuyuan coming here was indeed not for doing business, but came with a mission.

This mission concerned the grain supply security issue of Wuzhou, and even Two Guangs. So the Commercial Department sent a special person to contact Luo Yangming.

Once war started in Two Guangs, the grain problem of Two Guangs became the issue the Planning Court paid most attention to. Guangdong grain could not be self-sufficient, needing Guangxi assistance. Once war started, grain coming from Guangxi was interrupted.

Trade can stop, but people cannot stop eating. This was also why although beacon fires were everywhere and riots rose everywhere, the Senate still took Guangxi in the state of shortage of troops and cadres, stretching left and right—at least had to take the mobile official rule areas of Guangxi. Because without grain supply from these places, the eight million population of Guangdong not only couldn't transform into productive forces but instead became a heavy grain supply burden.

Although Zhu Quanxing’s battalion suppressed bandits everywhere around Wuzhou, preparation for marching into Guangxi didn't stop for a moment.

But in this way, a second problem arose. Wuzhou's stored grain had basically been ruined completely. Grain demand for the army marching into Guangxi was imminent. According to reports from Wuzhou Prefecture and neighboring counties, grain storage in various counties had dropped to the warning line, already having to adopt administrative orders restricting price increases and the "rationing by mouth" mode to guarantee supply. This also produced black markets, causing people's hearts to float.

Because Wuzhou used to be a distribution center for Two Guangs grain trade, grain storage condition was slightly better. But according to Xie Erren’s report, Wuzhou's condition was equally not optimistic. Because Wuzhou not only had a large population but also bore on-site procurement of grain for frontline captives and part of National Army and Fubo Army. Consumption was faster than other counties.

Once people's hearts float, they will inevitably be used by the remnants of Usurper Ming who are causing chaos everywhere currently. If handled improperly, the original spark might turn into a prairie fire.

After discussion between the Planning Court and Commercial Department, to maintain people's hearts and morale, it was decided to transfer grain into the West Guangdong area to guarantee military and civilian grain supply in that area. The specific transfer location was Wuzhou.

Wuzhou was a commercial key town in West Guangdong, having a natural commercial network radiating West Guangdong. The Planning Court only needed to transport grain to Wuzhou, then could distribute it down through commercial channels here, thereby alleviating current grain supply difficulties.

This decision was undoubtedly quite difficult, equivalent to further exacerbating the tense situation of grain supply and a series of problems like price soaring and transport capacity occupation caused by sharp increase in imported grain. Although the continental strategy was fairly smooth, land, population, natural resources, and markets couldn't immediately transform into useable wealth. Yet the cost the Senate had to pay for it became larger and larger.

"Right now the figure of accounts receivable of this company of ours is rising constantly. The income statement is unbelievably beautiful. But our cash flow is starting to have problems." Cheng Dong said so at a secret meeting of the Planning Court and Ministry of Finance.

Even so, they still had to brave it out to collect grain from multiple sides to put on the market. The purpose was nothing more than keeping social order stable.

This matter couldn't be given to Xie Erren to handle. He had absolutely no commercial channels in hand, nor understood grain trade. Official operation mostly would only be coaxed by merchants. So this grain transfer was decided to be handled by Luo Yangming, this "own person."

According to the Planning Court's line of thought, Luo Yangming would come forward to organize merchants of the Wuzhou Rice Grain Guild to raise funds jointly to purchase grain in batches, then distribute to various counties. Grain source provided by Dachang Rice Shop.

"...This work is very important," Zhu Fuyuan said solemnly, "This rice is all imported by us from Nanyang. Although the CIF price is much lower than Guangdong, transporting thousands of *li* to Wuzhou, the cost is not small either. Must minimize waste and embezzlement in intermediate links as much as possible."

"That's why want them to buy!" Luo Yangming said, "Spending money to stock goods is doing business; everyone will be careful. If relief, that would be terrible; first have to eat until vomiting themselves before talking." He asked: "When can the first batch arrive? About how much? Price?"

"First batch ten thousand *shi*," Zhu Fuyuan said, "Will arrive around July 1st. Price not set yet, need to refer to prices in various places to set a number. Don't know what Wuzhou's grain price is now?"

Luo Yangming frowned saying, "Although there is an order forbidding price increase now, the price still floated up somewhat. Before Xiong Wencan arrived in Wuzhou, local coarse rice price per *shi* was no more than one tael; when high no more than one tael four five mace. Later fighting a war, it rose to more than two taels in one breath. Now retail of one *shi* coarse rice has reached two taels eight mace. To be honest, at this price common people basically can't afford to eat rice anymore."

"Public resentment is very big, right?"

"How can it not be big. But engaged a rationing by mouth; as long as having local household registration, each person is supplied ration household rice monthly according to the price of one mace five candareens per *dou*—otherwise really would cause a famine." Luo Yangming said, "Now Wuzhou commerce stopped, hundred trades depressed. Chief Xie wants to revitalize industry and commerce, summoning us to meet to discuss countermeasures. But fighting wars all around, simply no one dares to come do business. Unemployed people are many, relying on relief to live."

"I see on the streets there are no beggar..."

"All taken in, locked over at Sanheui, given a bowl of thin porridge to drink, just not letting them starve to death. Doing some simple work."

"How is the market price?"

"Our Rice Guild public consensus, right now not releasing big market; small market temporary release is two taels four mace five candareens per *shi* coarse rice."

"So say small market merchants' gross profit is only a mere three mace five candareens."

"Correct. Fortunately price below is higher. Heard on black market there is selling up to three taels four mace... this price is too high. Common people are all cursing the Senate's mother..." Luo Yangming sighed, "But to be honest, selling coarse rice at this wholesale price, we lose on every *shi* sold. So daily sell at most a few *shi* then stop selling, considered dealing with Municipal Government's order..."

"What about Chief Xie?"

"He pretends not to know." Luo Yangming shook head, "To be honest, what method can he have? Clever wife hard to cook meal without rice. He can only target gentry large households now, asking them to pay Reasonable Burden. Gentry large households you also know, every one is an iron rooster. Finally Fubo Army's prestige is outside; these large households are still willing to take out more or less some. Considered filling some gaps."

Zhu Fuyuan nodded without speaking. The situation Luo Yangming told him was about the same as the background material report he read before coming. No wonder Chief urged this special supply very urgently.

"Since so, what do you think the price tag for us releasing big market this time should be?" Zhu Fuyuan asked.

Luo Yangming looked up to think for a moment: "Coarse rice one tael two mace per *shi*. To distribute down and let price fall, have to give merchants below profit and room..." He suddenly thought of something, "Can this rice be supplied continuously?"

"Can." Zhu Fuyuan said certainly, "Senate handling things you know; since Want to do, will do to place. Absolutely won't give up halfway."

"Then I'm reassured," Luo Yangming felt relieved of a heavy burden, "Since ancient times people are unstable without grain. If problems arise in grain again, whether we can sit steady in this Wuzhou city is hard to say..."
