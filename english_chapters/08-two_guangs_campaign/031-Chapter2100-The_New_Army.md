# Chapter 2100 - The New Army

Inside the west wing of the Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen administrative complex, a precious Australian oil lamp had burned steadily through the entire night. Yi Haoran hadn't managed to sleep even once again, his mind too active with tactical concerns.

All day long he had stood tensely on the city walls, carefully observing the Australian troop movements below. The Hair-Bandits' tactical actions were unhurried and methodical—their advances and withdrawals precisely choreographed like a military ballet, executed with professional discipline. They truly deserved their fearsome reputation as the "Giant Canal" that made imperial troops blanch with terror and flee in panic. An army like this, even without the decisive advantage of superior ships and devastating artillery, could still defeat the demoralized imperial forces with cold steel alone through sheer discipline and morale.

He had developed a growing, vague sense that Xiong Wenchan's determined pursuit of acquiring "superior weapons" as the solution was not entirely strategically sound. Even if every single soldier in Wuzhou's entire garrison were somehow equipped with modern Nanyang rifles, he honestly doubted they would have much realistic chance of victory against such a professional force. And at the moment, he had only a mere five hundred men of this experimental new army—a drop in the ocean.

On the surface, this particular organizational arrangement was clearly Xiong Wenchan's calculated way of balancing the bitter rivalry between the advisors Chang Qingyun and Yi Haoran. But in Yi Haoran's private view, the Governor-General actually possessed considerable strategic foresight in making this decision.

The regular Ming army was utterly beyond meaningful reform, its accumulated corruption and incompetence far too deep to cure with half-measures—even if he were merely a staff officer, Xiong Wenchan himself dared not touch the entrenched interests. A "surrendered bandit" like Jiang Suo had no personal troops of his own or political connections; placing him carelessly within the existing rigid military structure—let alone giving him any free rein to reform—would make even basic survival deeply uncertain. By deliberately dispatching Yi Haoran and Jiang Suo together to Guizhou to recruit household guards and build a force from absolute scratch, Xiong Wenchan had actually done them a considerable favor. The legendary Qi Jiguang himself, after all, had started out the exact same way, raising an entirely new force from nothing.

Training an effective army from scratch took serious money, substantial resources. Fortunately, Guizhou remained poor and barren; a settling-in recruitment fee of merely four taels per man proved sufficient to attract volunteers. But three taels a month per soldier in ongoing pay was still no trivial sum to maintain. Xiong Wenchan allocated ten thousand taels of silver to Yi Haoran's command: four thousand five hundred for three months' wages in advance, two thousand for settling fees and equipment, and the remainder designated for "miscellaneous expenses."

This particular "miscellaneous expense" fund required no itemized accounting or receipts—it was essentially a lump-sum arrangement where any surplus legitimately belonged to the manager. A seasoned old bureaucratic hand with a little nerve and fewer scruples might even dare skim off a portion of the settling fees and regular wages as profit. Thus, when Yi Haoran received this lucrative assignment, he instantly became recognized as a "man in favor" among Xiong Wenchan's crowded staff. Colleagues and fellow officials who were either well-acquainted or complete strangers came by to offer congratulations—and, of course, to slip in a few names of relatives or clients they hoped he might "take care of" with appointments.

Yi Haoran had served in various staff positions for many years and understood these political games perfectly. He couldn't very well refuse such requests outright—even if the person requesting couldn't actively help him later, at least they wouldn't actively sabotage him out of resentment. So when he and Jiang Suo finally departed for Guizhou, their recruiting party had swelled from the planned dozen to well over a hundred hangers-on seeking positions.

The recruitment site was strategically Xiong Wenchan's own home region: Yongning Guard in Guizhou Province. Since Guizhou lay outside Xiong Wenchan's official jurisdiction, Yi Haoran's official bureaucratic pretext was recruiting "household guards" for personal protection rather than formal "soldiers" for the state. The court didn't explicitly forbid such practices, but he knew perfectly well that Xiong Wenchan had accumulated many bitter enemies at court who might eagerly seize on this as a convenient pretext for political attack. So after hastily filling the ranks to the required five hundred, he quickly marched the men back to Guangxi for proper drilling—the training camp was prudently set up at Teng County, not far from strategic Wuzhou.

A few days after arriving at Teng County and establishing the camp, Yi Haoran summoned Jiang Suo privately to his quarters and handed him five hundred taels of silver in heavy ingots.

"What's this money for, sir?" In all his hard life, Jiang Suo had never personally seen so much silver in one place. He was visibly shocked.

"You accompanied me loyally to Guizhou and will be helping me train this entire force. This is what you're rightfully owed as your share."

"But... the monthly pay was just issued to everyone..."

Since taking command of the raw recruits, Yi Haoran had never once delayed wages—that much was true. Yet the actual pay distributed wasn't the originally promised three taels a month but only two. The bureaucratic excuse given was that three taels applied only to active combat deployments; during peacetime training, two taels would suffice. That one simple adjustment alone yielded five hundred extra taels of profit every single month. Jiang Suo received his full officer's stipend, but it sat deeply uneasily with him—among the Australians, the agreed sum was always the sum paid, never arbitrarily skimmed or short-changed.

"This particular payment is from the miscellaneous fund," Yi Haoran explained calmly. "It's your rightful share of the proceeds. Just take it and don't worry."

Yi Haoran certainly possessed a genuine sense of "public loyalty to the realm"—that was sincere enough. But that lofty sentiment didn't preclude enriching himself reasonably from opportunities. He was past fifty years old now; whether he'd ever hold another lucrative position was deeply uncertain given court politics. If he didn't squeeze some silver out of this assignment while he could, he wouldn't even have money saved for a proper coffin and burial! Besides, ever since accepting this post, the necessary "entertaining" of superiors and "smoothing" of relationships had cost heavily. If he didn't take it ultimately from the soldiers' allocated funds, the "miscellaneous fund" Xiong Wenchan had allotted wouldn't even begin to cover his considerable overhead expenses.

"But wasn't the expense fund already disbursed before we left for Guizhou?" Jiang Suo knew exactly what this practice was—"drinking soldiers' blood," as they'd called it during the political instruction sessions back when he first enlisted with the Australians.

"What could you possibly know!" Yi Haoran read his disapproving expression and felt a stir of surprise at such naivete. "You're an official of the court now, not an Australian Hair-Bandit soldier anymore. As an official in the Ming system, there are appearances to maintain, expenses to cover, people to entertain constantly. How could your pitiful official pay ever possibly suffice? Right now, we're training in isolated detachment, answering to no one. But once you're eventually posted amid the regular forces, you'll have demanding superiors and jealous colleagues to constantly appease—who will you not have to lubricate with gifts and bribes?" Seeing Jiang Suo about to protest this cynical reality, he waved a hand impatiently. "Just hear me out. This is the entrenched corruption of Ming officialdom—it cannot be changed. Forget you and me—even Governor Xiong himself daren't touch it, it runs so deep. Even legendary heroes like Qi Jiguang and Yuan Chonghuan had to curry favor with court factions in their day just to survive. Otherwise, never mind accomplishing anything meaningful—you won't keep your post or your life!"

He sighed heavily with evident regret. "When you enter the maze of officialdom, you must go along to get along. Sometimes you must even deliberately sully your own reputation for pragmatic reasons. Don't take it personally to heart!"

Jiang Suo said nothing more, silently accepted the heavy silver, and made to leave the quarters.

"Jiang Suo, you still haven't selected any personal guards for yourself?" Yi Haoran had been pressing him for days to select a dozen or so bodyguards from the best men.

"I have one attendant now. That's sufficient for my needs."

---

"You're far too naive and bookish!" Yi Haoran sighed in exasperation, then remembered the man wasn't actually classically literate. "On the battlefield, even a legendary general commanding a million elite troops needs a few absolutely trusted guards who'd willingly stake their lives for him. Otherwise, in a crisis situation, you're utterly alone and vulnerable!"

"Yes, sir. I understand now." Jiang Suo bowed his head respectfully and carefully tucked away the silver, then departed.

Yi Haoran shook his head inwardly with bemusement. These men that the Hair-Bandits had trained really were utterly hopeless sticklers for principle.

---

These five hundred new soldiers had all been carefully selected according to the rigorous standards laid out in the classic *Effective Discipline Manual*—robust mountain folk with good physiques, every single one. Yi Haoran handed all of them over to Jiang Suo for direct training.

Unfortunately, though Jiang Suo was genuinely well-versed in "Hair-Bandit drill methods" and could speak at impressive length about their training techniques, he was still just an ordinary former private—technically not even a corporal—with absolutely no practical experience commanding a large body of men. Suddenly being tasked with teaching five hundred alone naturally overwhelmed him completely. For several chaotic days, everything was disorder.

Yi Haoran recalled his extensive reading of military classics and changed tactics intelligently. First, he selected ten of the cleverest, most capable men from the five hundred for Jiang Suo to personally mentor intensively in marching, forming ranks, and handling arms. Then he drew out a hundred men to be drilled by those ten newly trained instructors, with Jiang Suo constantly correcting and guiding them. Finally, those hundred trained men drilled the remainder in turn. In barely three months of hard work, the unit had become visibly "orderly and presentable." Yi Haoran was quite pleased with himself and this achievement.

Even by Jiang Suo's demanding standards, the training level was honestly nothing particularly remarkable. Never mind comparing to the elite Fubo Army—it didn't even truly match the competent National Army garrison forces. At best, it was solid militia-grade. What he could personally teach was limited to only the most basic formation drills; the few battle formations he actually knew—deploying on the march, double-rank volley firing lines, defensive hollow squares—were the most elementary. How exactly to apply them flexibly in actual chaotic combat, he honestly wasn't confident.

Shooting practice likewise followed the basic training regimen Jiang Suo himself had received: fifty dry-fire drills for muscle memory, thirty precious live-fire rounds for accuracy.

This ammunition expenditure proved an absolute agony for the budget-conscious Yi Haoran. Each rifle came originally with only one hundred rounds of ammunition total. Ammunition was an Australian monopoly, and the prices were absolutely exorbitant. Setting aside even the gunpowder and lead bullets, the little copper "percussion caps" remained a complete mystery—no one knew how they were manufactured.

Though the money being spent wasn't his own personal savings, too much spending and he'd have serious trouble justifying it to Governor Xiong.

Still, watching the Nanyang rifles perform impressively on the firing range, Yi Haoran felt it was ultimately money well spent for capability.

The real trouble was, there were only a hundred of the precious rifles total—far too few for the entire force. Yi Haoran had originally planned to arm the rest with Portuguese matchlock muskets purchased in Macau. But Jiang Suo argued convincingly that the two firearm types differed too drastically in performance to coordinate effectively in battle. Instead, he proposed equipping the rest with long pikes, following a combined-arms method he'd observed during his militia-captain training course with the Australians.

Standard pikes were far easier to obtain than scarce Nanyang rifles. Before long, Yi Haoran's purchasing agents returned from Macau with several hundred Lingao-manufactured pikes of good quality. Jiang Suo then systematically drilled the spearmen and musketeers together in combined formations, following what he'd learned during his militia training.

On paper in the manuals, this combined drill looked straightforward and simple. In actual practice, it was anything but easy. Shifting formations fluidly on the fly—mixing pike and firearms units—required a professional caliber army with extensive experience. A rank amateur like Jiang Suo and a book-taught autodidact like Yi Haoran simply couldn't manage it alone. Recognizing this limitation, Xiong Wenchan assigned an experienced *bazong* named Song Ming to assist with the training.

Song Ming was a capable young officer who had survived the disaster at Chengmai. Since that humiliating defeat, his career had languished unfairly. But he remained ambitious and hungry. On arriving at Teng County and meeting Yi Haoran, the two hit it off at once, and Song Ming took direct charge of the field exercises.

Jiang Suo sketched out the combined-arms tactics on paper based on his memories, and Song Ming worked systematically to implement them in actual field drills. His training methods were sound and professional, and soon the drills took recognizable shape. Yet a fresh problem arose: Jiang Suo's knowledge was only skin-deep—the largest-scale unit movements he'd personally seen were at the company level. How to coordinate five hundred men across a battlefield, he honestly had no idea. The three of them experimented continuously, probing by trial and error, and eventually groped their way toward something workable.

But they had run completely out of time. The sudden shocking Australian amphibious landings, the successive rapid fall of Guangzhou and Zhaoqing, the uncertain fate of the Chaoshan Vice Commander's desperate defense—Xiong Wenchan's fledgling new army, barely formed and untested, was about to be thrown into a last-ditch fight against the vastly superior Australians at Wuzhou.

"Alas—the new army is not yet properly tempered by battle, and I have only five hundred men!" Yi Haoran's heart ached with deep regret and frustration.
