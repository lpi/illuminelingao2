# Chapter 2100 - The New Army

Inside the west wing of the Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen, an Australian oil lamp had burned through the night. Yi Haoran hadn't slept once again.

All day he had stood on the city walls, observing the Australian movements below. The Hair-Bandits' actions were unhurried and methodical—their advances and withdrawals precisely choreographed. They truly deserved their reputation as the "Giant Canal" that made imperial troops blanch and flee. An army like this, even without the advantage of superior ships and artillery, could still defeat the imperial forces with cold steel alone.

He had a vague sense that Xiong Wencan's determined pursuit of "weapons" was not entirely sound. Even if every soldier in Wuzhou's garrison were equipped with Nanyang rifles, he doubted they would have much chance of victory. And at the moment, he had only a mere five hundred men of this new army.

On the surface, this arrangement was Xiong Wencan's way of balancing the rivalry between Chang Qingyun and Yi Haoran. But in Yi Haoran's view, the Governor-General had considerable foresight.

The regular army was beyond reform, its accumulated corruption too deep to cure—even if he were a mere staff officer, Xiong Wencan himself daren't touch them. A "surrendered bandit" like Jiang Suo had no troops of his own; placing him within the existing military structure—let alone giving him free rein—would make even survival uncertain. By dispatching Yi Haoran and Jiang Suo to Guizhou to recruit household guards and build from scratch, Xiong Wencan had actually done them a favor. Qi Jiguang, after all, had started out the same way, raising a new force from nothing.

Training an army took serious money. Fortunately, Guizhou was poor and barren; a settling-in fee of four taels per man was sufficient. But three taels a month per soldier in pay was still no small sum. Xiong Wencan allocated ten thousand taels to Yi Haoran: four thousand five hundred for three months' wages, two thousand for settling fees, and the remainder for "miscellaneous expenses."

This "miscellaneous expense" fund required no itemized accounting—it was essentially a lump-sum arrangement where any surplus belonged to the manager. A seasoned old hand with a little nerve might even skim a portion of the settling fees and wages. Thus, when Yi Haoran received this assignment, he instantly became a "man in favor" among Xiong Wencan's staff. Colleagues and officials who were either acquainted or not came to offer congratulations—and, of course, to slip in a few names they hoped he might "take care of."

Yi Haoran had served in staff positions for years and understood these games. He couldn't very well refuse outright—even if the person couldn't help him later, at least they wouldn't sabotage him. So when he and Jiang Suo departed, their party had swelled from a dozen to over a hundred.

The recruitment site was Xiong Wencan's home region: Yongning Guard in Guizhou. Since Guizhou was outside Xiong Wencan's jurisdiction, Yi Haoran's official pretext was recruiting "household guards" rather than "soldiers." The court didn't forbid such practices, but he knew Xiong Wencan had many enemies at court who might seize on this as a pretext for attack. So after hastily filling the ranks, he quickly marched the men back to Guangxi for drilling—the training camp was set up at Teng County, not far from Wuzhou.

A few days after arriving at Teng County, Yi Haoran summoned Jiang Suo and handed him five hundred taels of silver.

"What's this money for?" In all his life, Jiang Suo had never seen so much silver. He was shocked.

"You accompanied me to Guizhou and will be helping me train this force. This is what you're owed."

"But... the monthly pay was just issued..."

Since taking command of the recruits, Yi Haoran had never once delayed wages. Yet the pay wasn't the promised three taels a month but two. The excuse was that three taels applied only to active combat; during peacetime, two taels would suffice. That one adjustment alone yielded five hundred extra taels every month. Jiang Suo received his full stipend, but it sat uneasily with him—among the Australians, the agreed sum was the sum paid, never skimmed or short-changed.

"This is from the miscellaneous fund," Yi Haoran said. "It's your rightful share. Just take it."

Yi Haoran certainly possessed a sense of "public loyalty to the realm," but that didn't preclude enriching himself. He was past fifty now; whether he'd ever hold another position was uncertain. If he didn't squeeze some silver out of this assignment, he wouldn't even have money for a coffin! Besides, ever since accepting this post, the "entertaining" and "smoothing" had cost heavily. If he didn't take it from the soldiers' hides, the "miscellaneous fund" Xiong Wencan had allotted wouldn't even cover his overhead.

"Wasn't the expense fund disbursed before we left for Guizhou?" Jiang Suo knew exactly what this was—"drinking soldiers' blood," as they'd called it during the political instruction sessions back when he enlisted.

"What do you know!" Yi Haoran read his expression and felt a stir of surprise. "You're an official of the court now, not a Hair-Bandit soldier. As an official, there are appearances to maintain, expenses to cover, people to entertain. How could your pitiful pay ever suffice? Right now, we're training in isolated detachment, answering to no one. But once you're posted amid the regular forces, you'll have superiors and colleagues to appease—who will you not have to lubricate?" Seeing Jiang Suo about to protest, he waved a hand. "Hear me out. This is the entrenched corruption of officialdom. Forget you and me—even Governor Xiong himself daren't touch it. Even Qi Jiguang and Yuan Chonghuan had to curry favor with court factions in their day. Otherwise, never mind accomplishing anything—you won't keep your post or your life!"

He sighed. "When you enter officialdom, you must go along to get along. Sometimes you must even sully your own reputation. Don't take it to heart!"

Jiang Suo said nothing more, accepted the silver, and made to leave.

"Jiang Suo, you still haven't picked any personal guards?" Yi Haoran had been pressing him for days to select a dozen or so bodyguards.

"I have one attendant now. That's enough."

"You're far too bookish!" Yi Haoran sighed and then remembered the man wasn't actually literate. "On the battlefield, even a general commanding a million elite troops needs a few trusted guards who'd stake their lives for him. Otherwise, in a crisis, you're utterly alone!"

"Yes, sir. I understand now." Jiang Suo bowed his head and took the silver, then departed.

Yi Haoran shook his head inwardly. These men that the Hair-Bandits had trained really were hopeless sticklers.

These five hundred new soldiers had all been selected according to the standards laid out in *The Effective Discipline Manual*—robust mountain folk, every one. Yi Haoran handed all of them over to Jiang Suo for training.

Unfortunately, though Jiang Suo was well-versed in "Hair-Bandit drill" and could speak at length about their methods, he was still just an ordinary private—technically not even a corporal—with no experience commanding a large body of men. Suddenly teaching five hundred alone naturally overwhelmed him. For several days, everything was chaos.

Yi Haoran recalled his readings and changed tactics. First, he selected ten of the cleverest men from the five hundred for Jiang Suo to personally mentor in marching, forming ranks, and handling arms. Then he drew out a hundred men to be drilled by those ten, with Jiang Suo constantly correcting and guiding them. Finally, those hundred trained the remainder. In barely three months, the unit had become "orderly and presentable." Yi Haoran was quite pleased with himself.

Even by Jiang Suo's standards, the training level was nothing remarkable. Never mind the Fubo Army—it didn't even match the National Army. At best, it was militia-grade. What he could teach was limited to the most basic formation drills; the few battle formations he knew—deploying on the march, double-rank volley lines, hollow squares—were the most elementary. How exactly to apply them in actual combat, he honestly wasn't sure.

Shooting practice likewise followed the training Jiang Suo had received: fifty dry-fire drills, thirty live-fire rounds.

This proved an agony for Yi Haoran. Each rifle came with only one hundred rounds of ammunition. Ammunition was an Australian monopoly, and the prices were exorbitant. Setting aside gunpowder and lead bullets, the little copper "percussion caps" were a mystery—no one knew how they were made.

Though the money wasn't his own, too much spending and he'd have trouble justifying it to Governor Xiong.

Still, watching the Nanyang rifles perform on the firing range, Yi Haoran felt it was money well spent.

The trouble was, there were only a hundred of the rifles—far too few. Yi Haoran had originally planned to arm the rest with Portuguese matchlocks purchased in Macau. But Jiang Suo argued that the two firearm types differed too greatly in performance to coordinate. Instead, he proposed equipping the rest with long spears, following a method he'd observed during his militia-captain training course.

Standard pikes were far easier to obtain than Nanyang rifles. Before long, Yi Haoran's men returned from Macau with several hundred Lingao-manufactured pikes. Jiang Suo then drilled the spearmen and musketeers together in combined formations, following what he'd learned during his militia training.

On paper, this combined drill looked simple. In practice, it was anything but. Shifting formations on the fly—mixing pike and firearms units—required a professional caliber army. A rank amateur like Jiang Suo and a book-taught autodidact like Yi Haoran simply couldn't manage it. Xiong Wencan assigned a *bazong* named Song Ming to assist with the training.

Song Ming was a young officer who had survived the disaster at Chengmai. Since that defeat, his career had languished. But he was ambitious. On arriving at Teng County and meeting Yi Haoran, the two hit it off at once, and Song Ming took charge of the exercises.

Jiang Suo sketched out the combined-arms tactics on paper, and Song Ming worked to implement them in the field. His training methods were sound, and soon the drills took shape. Yet a fresh problem arose: Jiang Suo's knowledge was only skin-deep—the largest-scale movements he'd seen were at the company level. How to coordinate five hundred men, he had no idea. The three of them experimented, probing by trial and error, and eventually groped their way toward something workable.

But they had run out of time. The sudden Australian landings, the successive fall of Guangzhou and Zhaoqing, the uncertain fate of the Chaoshan Vice Commander's defense—Xiong Wencan's fledgling new army, barely formed, was about to be thrown into a last-ditch fight against the Australians at Wuzhou.

"Alas—the new army is not yet tempered, and I have only five hundred men!" Yi Haoran's heart ached with regret.
