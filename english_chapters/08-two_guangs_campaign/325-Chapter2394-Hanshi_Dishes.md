# Chapter 2394: Hanshi Dishes

The shop's walls on all four sides had shelves, and in the middle were large long tables full of glass compartments with lids, filled compartment by compartment with various goods.

The floor and walls here unusually used ceramic tiles. Probably because they had just been cleaned when opening, the floor and walls were shiny clean, even the glass was spotless.

Limited by packaging materials, the Senate's light industrial products and foods mostly adopted a large-package retail model, easily contaminated in terminal channels. So cleanliness and hygiene had always been emphasized.

Both Chu He and Park Jihyun came from Jeju Island and were used to Zhongyi Trading Company's style, not finding anything unusual. But the local customers in the shop felt somewhat amazed—after all, the cleanliness brought by ceramic tiles was hard to come by in the 17th century.

Chu He looked at the goods in these glass compartments—this branch was not only larger than the Jeju branch, but the variety and grade of goods were also considerably higher. Probably due to differences in market consumption power.

Different from Zicheng Records, the former's food and daily necessities were positioned for high-end crowds, with high premiums and exquisite packaging. Zhongyi Trading Company's goods were mostly aimed at the middle and lower classes, not only diverse in variety but also relatively more affordable in price.

The reason for saying "relatively" was because the goods here were still unaffordable or only occasionally affordable for the truly bottom-tier local common people.

If only we could get more quality goods at low prices from Southeast Asia, Chu He thought.

Unlike the deserted atmosphere outside, there were quite a few customers inside browsing and selecting goods. Upstairs, laughter and the clinking of bowls and dishes could also be heard, suggesting there were quite a few customers.

It seemed the Senate's commerce and goods were still quite attractive. Chu He's heart settled somewhat—as long as the Senate was still a golden brand, it would naturally attract enough investors.

The shop's clerks were almost all female—in the commercial retail field, Senate-affiliated enterprises' employment principle was to use women as much as possible whenever they could handle the job. Zhongyi Trading Company was no exception. They wore white tops with coffee-colored trim, black long pants, tied with coffee-colored short aprons, wearing coffee-colored headscarves—exactly the same as the Jeju Island branch. The only difference was that they spoke Cantonese, not "New Speech."

Watching the female clerks greet customers, recommend goods, weigh and package... Chu He suddenly thought of something and quietly asked: "Little Piao, how did they know I'm a Senator?"

Park Jihyun smiled: "As soon as you opened your mouth, it was 'just browsing'—speaking New Speech isn't rare, but this 'just browsing' sounds like a Chief's phrasing right away."

"There's such a thing?" Chu He found this very novel.

"That's right." Park Jihyun nodded. "Although Chiefs and us naturalized citizens both speak New Speech, the differences are quite big. First, Chiefs speak New Speech with accurate tones. Second, the words and sentences are also different from ours."

"So that's how it is." Chu He nodded repeatedly.

"There's actually more. For example, when Senators walk, men all like to walk with hands behind their backs, taking measured strides. Women basically all take big strides with heads held high..." Park Jihyun imitated Senators' walking postures. "And then there's the expression. This expression, I can't learn it either. Poor people are all evasive, rich people look down on everything, but Chiefs' expressions and gazes are especially different..." He also started imitating.

Chu He couldn't help laughing, thinking this summary was really quite on point! He suddenly thought of Little Piao's sister—also so slyly clever and lively and interesting, the most favored among his life secretaries.

"You're really something." Chu He teased. "I think you should go be an actor in the drama troupe."

"How could that work? Then there'd be no one to serve you, sir. Besides, if I weren't by your side, my sister wouldn't feel at ease either..."

"Didn't expect you had such heavy responsibilities." Chu He teased. His originally somewhat worried mood was relieved. He suddenly felt hungry—probably the dazzling array of food had aroused his appetite. Seeing the "Hanshi Dishes" advertising board hanging at the first-floor stairway entrance to attract business—although not a photograph, the pattern drawn by a skilled painter was still very tempting—he couldn't help swallowing.

"Let's go upstairs to eat something."

"Chief, there's still a dinner banquet tonight..."

"You talk too much! In a bit, you stand aside and watch!" Saying this, he headed upstairs.

Coming upstairs was the trading company's "dining department." Zhongyi Trading Company's dining department also catered to middle and lower-class common people, belonging to the "fast food" and "snacks" category.

The dining department's decor was completely fast-food restaurant style, with small tables for two or four people. The chairs were also small-sized, seeking maximum use of space. Large menus were posted on the walls, all with illustrations and prices. Customers could see everything at a glance upon entering.

Chu He led Park Jihyun to the cashier counter and ordered a basic "Hanshi Cold Noodles."

"Would you like to add meat?" the cashier asked.

"No need..."

Park Jihyun couldn't help saying: "Chief, it's still winter right now..."

"What do you know? Cold noodles are most satisfying eaten in winter." Chu He said. "Do you want to eat? If not, stand aside."

Park Jihyun had no choice: "I'll have a bowl too."

The two chose a table and sat down. Chu He browsed the menu on the wall. Besides cold noodles, there were also hot noodles, stone pot bibimbap, Hanshi pancakes, seaweed fish-meat rice rolls, Hanshi stir-fried rice cakes... At another counter, there were also more than ten large porcelain jars with glass lids, containing various types of "Hanshi side dishes": dressed bellflower, dressed dried tofu, dressed sea hare, dressed mixed, dressed konjac...

Actually, most of the dishes sold in Zhongyi Trading Company's dining department were "Korean cuisine" from the old spacetime. Although the Joseon Dynasty in this plane also had some high-class banquet cuisine popular in the palace and among the yangban, it hadn't yet developed the flavors familiar to everyone from the old spacetime—take the representative Korean pickled vegetables for example. Because chili peppers hadn't yet been introduced to the peninsula, they didn't have the taste Senators were familiar with.

Chu He knew that the dishes here were basically all from Doctor Zhong's hands. Zhong Lishi was quite skilled at making Joseon-style food from the old spacetime and had some taste preferences—after all, his hometown was in Jilin. It was precisely under his guidance that Senators could taste again the cold noodles, rice cakes, spicy stir-fried rice cakes, spicy pickled cabbage, and side dishes they often ate in the old spacetime.

However, Senators couldn't admit these things came from the old spacetime, so these foods that didn't originally exist in this plane were called "Australian Hanshi." The original plane's "Korean cuisine" was called "Hanshi Dishes" in Lingao—similar to how fried chicken burgers were called "Kaifeng Dishes" in Lingao.

Before long, the server brought two bowls of "Hanshi Cold Noodles" to the table. The noodles were served in large sea bowls, topped with a layer of pickled vegetables. Chu He took a sip of the soup—cool and refreshing, but with a fresh, fragrant taste—probably simmered from beef. After swallowing, the cool sensation was refreshing to the heart and spleen. Then he ate a piece of pickled vegetable—fragrant, spicy, crisp, sour with a touch of sweetness, and a fruity aroma. The cold noodles slipped into his stomach before he could even chew carefully.

"These noodles are really well made!" Chu He praised. Looking at Park Jihyun across from him, also slurping away enthusiastically, he couldn't help smiling.

Chu He had witnessed the entire process of Doctor Zhong "inventing" "Hanshi Cold Noodles." After Jeju Island was occupied, Doctor Zhong took the opportunity of building the new astronomical observatory to establish a presence on Jeju. In his view, Jeju had excellent conditions for agriculture and animal husbandry. It was exactly the right place for Zhongyi Trading Company, which mainly produced and sold subsidiary food products, to establish a presence.

So, using the construction of the astronomical observatory, Doctor Zhong "incidentally" built the trading company on Jeju. This trading company, from design to decoration, was all personally done by Doctor Zhong, making Chu He, who was on Jeju at the time, quite unable to understand: why was this seemingly unrelated Doctor so enthusiastic about this?

Before the trading company was even completed, Doctor Zhong had already drilled into the kitchen of the former Jeju Provincial Office and began developing "Hanshi Dishes."

As the Senator stationed on Jeju and an "idle person," Chu He was the first to taste Doctor Zhong's "invented" "Hanshi Cold Noodles."

It must be said, these Zhong-brand cold noodles were more delicious than any cold noodles he had eaten in the old spacetime, completely overturning his impression of Korean cold noodles.

Out of curiosity, he asked to see the Korean cold noodle production process. Doctor Zhong readily agreed, not only taking him to the kitchen to observe but also personally explaining:

"A bowl of cold noodles looks simple, but actually has many ingredients and is quite particular to make. Authentic cold noodles are freshly pressed, immediately put into the pot to boil after pressing, then served in a bowl with ice shards after cooking. Cold noodles are cold outside but warm inside, soft yet resilient, and won't clump together even after an hour. The main ingredient is buckwheat noodles, smooth and chewy with bite. The disadvantage is the rough texture. The shop's method is to mix in some flour, but flour is currently a 'precious ingredient'—if added, the masses couldn't afford it. Fortunately, Jeju is most suitable for growing potatoes, and mixing in potato flour works just as well." Doctor Zhong pointed at the noodle-pressing machine shipped from Lingao and talked eloquently. "The soup base is also particular. Generally, beef broth is used—actually dog meat broth is more flavorful—first wash large pieces of beef clean and put in the pot, add enough water at once, boil on high heat and skim off the foam, add soy sauce and salt, change to low heat and simmer for three or four hours. Then put scallions and carrots in a cloth bag, tie it tight, put it in the beef soup, and simmer again for a little while. Finally, take out the beef and cloth bag to cool. This beef is sliced, carrots cut into strips. The beef soup should be settled to remove residue, then seasoned with condiments to taste and set aside. As for toppings, besides beef slices or dog meat slices, Korean pickled vegetables are essential, plus apples, pears, watermelon slices, or other seasonal vegetables to choose from. On top, yellow and white egg strips are used as decoration, sprinkled with chili powder, drizzled with soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil, finally sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds—and that makes an authentic Korean cold noodle."

Chu He thought: no wonder he wanted to come to Jeju Island to develop this so-called "Hanshi Dishes." Besides Jeju Island, where else could he get a stable supply of beef!
