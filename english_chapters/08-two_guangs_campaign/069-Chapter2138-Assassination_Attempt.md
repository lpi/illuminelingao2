# Chapter 2138 - Assassination Attempt

There were multiple Dragon Mother Temples in Wuzhou: by the West River inside the city, by the Xun River on Changzhou Island, and by the Gui River north of the city. However, in terms of long history and grand scale, the one by the Gui River north of the city was the foremost—founded during the Xianping era of the Northern Song Dynasty—so He Dongli led him towards the north of the city.

Wuzhou's economy relied on water transport; the markets outside the city had always been prosperous, with numerous docks along the river. To the north of the city was the famously known "North Gui Grand Dock." Originally, shops and trading houses stood in great numbers here, with many merchants, and there were many porters, boatmen, and raftsmen who lived off the water... Now, however, there was only a stretch of ruins. Outside the North Gate, the fortifications built by the Ming army were being dismantled, and there were also labor teams in twos and threes clearing up the ruins.

The Dragon Mother Temple was just east of the Gui River, opposite the famous North Gui Grand Dock. It wasn't far after exiting the Dayun Gate to the north. This temple building was complete and had not been destroyed—the Ming army had directly abandoned this area outside the city, so it had not suffered the ravages of war.

By the standards of the old timeline, the Dragon Mother Temple couldn't be considered large, but in the 17th century, it was enough to be called "magnificent." The halls faced south with their backs to the north, nestling against the mountains and near the water.

Hearing that the "Great Song Prefect" was coming to offer incense, the temple curates and Daoists hurriedly came to the gate to welcome him. Because rumors had long spread in the neighborhood that the "Australian Prefect" was coming to the Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense, quite a few idle commoners had gathered at the temple entrance to watch the excitement. The bailiffs of the Cangwu County Yamen shouted to maintain order.

Surrounded by a crowd, Xie Erren walked up the steps, entered through the mountain gate, and went straight to the front hall.

Although the Dragon Mother Temple had not been looted by war, it housed many refugees who had suffered disasters outside the city. At this moment, the able-bodied men had all formed teams and gone out to work, while the old, weak, women, and children gathered under the eaves of the corridors on both sides. Bailiffs were guarding them, forbidding them from lighting fires. Before Xie Erren arrived, bailiffs had already reported it, and the bailiffs inside the temple drove the refugees to squat on both sides, forbidding them from whispering to each other. It was just that the ground hadn't been cleaned up in time; broken bowls and tattered quilts were strewn all over the floor.

Xie Erren entered the temple and was stunned when he saw the refugees under the corridor: he didn't expect there to be so many here too! Judging by their clothes, some refugees should have come from well-off or even wealthy families, but now they were reduced to squatting under the temple corridor relying on gruel distribution for survival. There were also children and elderly people who had suffered from wind and cold or shock, now lying sick on the ground with neither medicine nor beds, groaning and crying by the wall under the eaves. He couldn't help but sigh secretly: no wonder people said it's better to be a dog in peace than a human in chaos. Wuzhou had only fought for a few days, yet the people had suffered such ravages!

However, he couldn't come up with any way to improve the refugees' living conditions; for now, he could only temporarily guarantee the food supply.

The scale of the front hall was not large. Ideally, the plaque bore four seal characters. Xie Erren didn't recognize them. He Dongli explained that these were the four characters for "Li Ze Tian Xia" (Benefiting the World).

In the center, the Dragon Mother statue was enshrined, with five small dragons coiling under the altar. The temple curate had prepared incense and candles long ago. Xie Erren took them—he had originally intended to just go through the motions, but the tragic state of the people's livelihood along the way made him involuntarily burn incense and pray, praying that this "Goddess of the West River" could protect Wuzhou's peace.

Dragon Mother worship could be said to be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in Wuzhou and other West River basins. Although scholars like He Dongli mostly held an attitude of "keeping them but not discussing them" or "teaching through the gods" towards gods and immortals, folk beliefs would more or less affect them. Seeing this "Great Song Prefect" from overseas being so pious towards the Dragon Mother, not only He Dongli but also the commoners watching inside and outside the temple had more or less favorable impressions of him.

After offering incense, Xie Erren walked around the temple led by the temple curate and He Dongli. The Dragon Mother Temple here was of considerable scale. Starting from the mountain gate, there were the front hall, rear hall, left and right corridor rooms, corner pavilions... According to He Dongli's introduction, this temple was founded in the Northern Song Dynasty and rebuilt in the Wanli era. It was the largest and had the most flourishing incense among the several Dragon Mother Temples in the local area.

"When the first day of the fifth lunar month arrives each year, it is the Dragon Mother's Birthday, which is the liveliest time," He Dongli said. "Boats sailing on the river, upon encountering the Dragon Mother's Birthday period, when sailing within three *li* of the Dragon Mother Temple, regardless of day or night, must blow whistles and beat gongs, bowing towards the temple from afar. When sailing to the river surface in front of the temple, they stop the boat and go ashore to enter the temple to pay respects, offering incense and candles."

He said that the worship for the Dragon Mother's Birthday started from the first day of the fifth month and ended on the fifteenth of the fifth month. The three days and two nights of the seventh and eighth day and night of the fifth month and the daytime of the ninth were the climax. Not only did merchants and peddlers gather in clouds, but various entertainment troupes from all over also came here to perform. People from local and neighboring counties' villages and towns also came here to offer skills and sacrifice, making it very lively.

Xie Erren immediately thought that this was a great opportunity for "religious festivals to set the stage, and economy to perform the play." At the very least, it could promote urban-rural economic exchange. However, thinking again about the Eight-Row Yao riots and the unsafe roads right now, merchants and commoners probably wouldn't have such good spirits.

The root of improving the economy was to have a peaceful environment. Xie Erren suddenly had a profound understanding of this sentence.

While he was sighing, the guard holding a rifle whispered, "Chief, many commoners have gathered outside. There are few bailiffs to suppress them, and it's difficult to guarantee safety—let's leave through the side door."

Xie Erren disapproved. "We have no grievances or enmity with the Wuzhou people; what safety issues could there be? This is also an opportunity to connect with the masses' feelings. Don't be panic-stricken at the slightest sound."

Coming out of the Dragon Mother Temple, he saw quite a few commoners gathering outside to watch the excitement. Xie Erren stood on the stone steps, smiling and waving to the crowd to show his "closeness to the people." Seeing that he had no official airs, the people all wanted to take a good look at what this "Australian Prefect" looked like and surged forward one after another. The bailiffs who were maintaining order were caught off guard and immediately couldn't suppress them. The guarding soldiers urged Xie Erren to leave quickly.

Xie Erren was in no hurry. He enjoyed this feeling of "sharing happiness with the people." He took square steps, walking slowly down the stairs, waving all the way. Just as he reached the last step, a woman suddenly squeezed out of the crowd and shouted:

"Bald thief! Die!"

While shouting, a gleaming knife had already appeared in her hand, and she charged straight at Xie Erren.

This shout came suddenly. Xie Erren was stunned. The guard was quick-eyed and deft-handed; he gave him a fierce shove, pushing him directly to the ground, and spread his limbs to cover his body.

This shove and press made Xie Erren see stars, almost unable to breathe.

The guarding soldiers carried rifles on their backs and completely couldn't react in the hurry. It was a bailiff on the side who was agile; the long whip used for suppression in his hand lashed out, hitting the woman's calf with one strike, and with a smooth roll, he dragged her to the ground.

The bailiffs on the side swarmed up, pinning the woman down with seven hands and eight feet. Someone grabbed her wrist and snatched the sharp knife from her hand.

The soldiers quickly formed a circle, surrounding Xie Erren in the center. Xie Erren climbed up from the ground, only feeling a cold sweat of fear, unable to speak for a long time. Seeing that the place where the woman fell was less than two or three meters away from him, if not for the guard's quick reaction and the bailiff's fast movement, he would be doomed at this moment: even if he didn't die on the spot, the chance of survival after having his stomach pierced in this place far from the Senate and without Senator doctors was minimal.

It was the first time his life had been threatened at such close range. While extremely terrified, he immediately erupted with great anger. In a fit of rage, he intended to flare up on the spot and "hang her on a lamppost" to demonstrate the power of the "Senate and People's Democratic Dictatorship." However, at this moment, under the gaze of the public, it was inconvenient to get angry. Being pushed down by the guard just now was already a "loss of dignity"; if he jumped in a thunderous rage now, it would make him appear to have no "depth." So he just coughed and pretended to be calm, saying:

"First... take... her down, interrogate... slowly..."

"Yes!"

The bailiffs carried ropes with them and tied the woman up in a few moves. Only then did everyone see clearly that the assassin was a young woman, wearing a blue cloth short jacket, a moon-white vest, and a skirt below, with a white velvet flower pinned to her temple—she was a widow in mourning.

"What a pretty woman!"

"Why did this little widow want to assassinate the Australian?"

"Could she be the wife of a soldier who died in battle?"

"What a pity for a perfectly good woman! This is seeking her own death!"

"Looking at her actions, she is very unyielding, truly a remarkable woman."

... The surrounding onlookers whispered. Xie Erren originally wanted to say a few more words, but the guard urged him to leave quickly—perhaps there were second or third assassins hiding.

Xie Erren felt weak and diffident at this time. He originally felt "the world is in my hands," but now he felt "everyone is an enemy." He had no heart to show off anymore, so he nodded and said, "Let's go back!"

The woman being taken down suddenly stopped her footsteps, lowered her head, and bit the bailiff next to her fiercely. Taking advantage of the moment the bailiff cried out in pain and let go, she struggled to break free from the bailiffs around her, turned her head, and shouted loudly: "Kill me or cut me to pieces, as you please! I was born a person of the Great Ming, and I will die a ghost of the Great Ming. I will never bend my knees to serve the bald thieves!"

The bailiffs turned pale with fright and rushed up to press her down on her knees again. The woman still cursed endlessly:

"I am a descendant of Huaxia, long educated by civilization. You bald thieves have no ruler and no father, plunging the people into misery; you are all banished criminal thieves. Seeing me, why do you not bow down!

"Although the soldiers and horses before your bald thief hall are fierce, your indulgence in violence is roughly the same as the Eastern Barbarians! Even a rat has skin, but bald people have no manners. If a person has no manners, why shouldn't he die!

"The mothers of bald people are all servant women; the fathers of bald people are all slaves! You thieving bones, in the future when you fall into the hands of the government troops, you will be crushed to powder."

The shrill voice echoed on the stone steps in front of the Dragon Mother Temple. An old bailiff hurriedly came over and dislocated her jaw, and the string of curses turned into incoherent sounds.

Xie Erren was extremely annoyed in his heart. A perfectly good "close to the people show" was ruined by this woman alive. He could tell from the expressions of the surrounding people that they more or less sympathized with this woman—since ancient times, commoners would always involuntarily worship their own kind who resisted power—and he couldn't help but sigh secretly in his heart: truly unable to appreciate favors!

He composed himself and said to the people around him with feigned casualness, "Take her back. Watch her closely; don't let her die."
