# Chapter 2147 - Domestic Affairs at Luo Yangming's House

Though this further diminished the combat effectiveness of the other three companies, it would at least allow the supplementary company to serve some purpose. It also aligned with Qian Duo's desire to keep his forces from being diluted, so it was immediately approved.

"Have your troops enter the garrison immediately and begin fortification work," Qian Duo said. "There are many damaged sections of the city wall—some of the breaches are so large that one can pass through without climbing. Though repairs have been ongoing these past few days, they're only stopgap measures. Be extra vigilant when posting sentries. Leave no gaps in coverage."

"Yes, sir!"

"Master, another Australian army unit has entered the city..."

"What kind of unit?"

Luo Yangming set down the ledger in his hands and asked.

The one reporting was the young shop assistant Achun, who had just returned from buying vegetables. These past days, Luo Yangming had specifically instructed him to report anything he saw or heard on his outings.

"I'm not sure. But they're not carrying muskets—they're armed with long spears."

Hearing that the arriving troops carried spears, Luo Yangming knew they had to be the National Army coming to take over city defense.

With the National Army in the city, the stone that had been weighing on Luo Yangming's heart finally settled. When the main body of the Beiwei Army had withdrawn, he had been quite confused—having just taken Wuzhou, why not press on to attack Tengxian County and thoroughly wipe out the remaining Ming forces? Instead, they had hastily withdrawn, leaving only one battalion behind, with just a single company stationed inside the city proper.

Was this asking Chief Xie to perform the Empty City Stratagem? If Xiong Wencan were to counterattack from Tengxian, this war-scarred Wuzhou City and its skeletal garrison would crumble like paper.

Luo Yangming was full of questions, but discipline forbade him from approaching Xu Ke, so he could only continue his "undercover" work.

"Were there many of them?"

"Several hundred! They don't look like Australians! Their speech has a local accent, and they're slouching about—not as spirited as the ones who came before!" Being a young lad, Achun was particularly curious about new things. Since the Beiwei Army had turned out not to be man-eating monsters, he naturally wanted to get a closer look.

"Ah, I see." Luo Yangming nodded. Most of the National Army had been hastily recruited, so their poor military bearing was to be expected.

Poor was still better than nothing. Though Luo Yangming had been busy with the Relief Bureau's work these days, he had learned quite a bit about the outside situation. Many of the gentry who had been in Wuzhou had fled to the countryside—fearing the city might become a battlefield again if the Ming army counterattacked. But in recent days, gentry and wealthy landowners from the surrounding villages had been streaming into the city instead. Rumors were circulating in the streets that "the mountain Yao have come down to kill." Even the "Wolf and Zhuang" settlements that had been dispersed in the mountain regions as a blockade line were reportedly showing signs of unrest.

Temperature Ironhead had also told him at the docks that most ships arriving from Guangdong were now Australian armed convoys—ordinary civilian vessels rarely came to Wuzhou anymore. The boat captains and helmsmen were all jumpy as startled birds—reportedly, on the West River from Zhaoqing upward, armed Yao militants were highly active along the banks, and any vessel that ran aground would inevitably suffer plunder and casualties.

So the First Brigade had declined to pursue the nearby Tengxian prey and instead hurriedly pulled its main force back to Zhaoqing—behind it all lurked such a major hidden danger!

Having operated undercover in Wuzhou for many years, Luo Yangming understood much about the local Han-Yao tensions and knew that if a large-scale "Yao uprising" erupted, the consequences would be unthinkable.

The National Army might not be able to hold their own in battle, but as long as they repaired the city walls properly, they could still be useful for defense. So he thought.

Just as he was pondering this, someone arrived with a message: the Relief Bureau requested his presence that afternoon.

"Tell him I'll come after lunch," Luo Yangming replied, thinking that now with the National Army's arrival, matters of city defense and provisions would need to be settled.

"Going again! Always going!" Atao was bringing him his tea and meal when she heard this and complained, "The Relief Bureau's affairs are always dragging you away! You're not the Cangwu County Magistrate! You have no official seal, no salary, and yet you rush off to handle these thankless chores! Can't even eat a meal in peace!"

The Relief Bureau's work was both numerous and miscellaneous, and most of the bureau members were the type to "contribute money but not effort." Luo Yangming had no choice but to put in extra work himself, neglecting his own business. His wife inevitably had complaints. Fortunately, old Manager Li Wensheng had returned safely, and since business at the rice shop had been rather slow after Wuzhou's liberation, they could just barely manage.

Luo Yangming soothed his wife: "Though this work brings no direct profit, it does have its benefits—look at me now, I'm practically a semi-official figure in Wuzhou. Won't doing business be easier from now on? Even the people in the Australian bureaus have to show me some courtesy."

"Australians! Australians!" Atao's face was displeased. "The Imperial troops are right there in Tengxian! If they fight their way back, our family can't bear the consequences—I don't think these Australians look like True Dragon Sons of Heaven anyway. With their impoverished scholar appearance, they can't possibly sit on the Dragon Throne..."

"Shut your mouth!" Luo Yangming shot to his feet and slapped his wife hard across the face, bellowing, "What do you know! Such womanish shortsightedness!"

That they could live again in this world, that husband and wife could be reunited—all of it was thanks to the Australians' benevolence. Luo Yangming would never forget this debt of gratitude. His wife speaking such words was, to him, nothing short of ingratitude. What "doesn't look like a True Dragon Son of Heaven," what "impoverished scholar appearance"... this was a tremendous insult to both the Council of Elders and to himself. He trembled with rage.

---

The couple had always been harmonious; Ding Atao had never been struck by her husband before. That single slap left her stunned. When she came to her senses, she covered her face with her hands and began to weep softly, turning away and whimpering "how bitter my fate is" as she went out. Coming from a minor scholarly family, she naturally could not wail loudly—that would have made her a "shrew."

Her tears made Luo Yangming's mind clear slightly, and he silently cursed himself for being rash. The Council of Elders had shown such great benevolence to his family, yet he had never told her a single word about it. When they had fled as refugees, it was his wife who had been sold and humiliated... In truth, he had greatly wronged her...

Feeling guilty but not knowing what to do, he was stewing in frustration when a petite young girl walked in.

The girl was Wen Yun, Temperature Ironhead's younger sister, whose original name was "Water Girl." The name Wen Yun had actually been given by Luo Yangming. By his aesthetic standards, she could only be considered "common and vulgar," and she also had a bit of "jianghu demeanor"—which was probably unavoidable.

Wen Yun was actually still a young girl, small in age and without much guile. Though uneducated and somewhat rough around the edges, she was cheerful and frank, so Ding Atao quite liked her. She normally kept her close by, treating her as both a little sister and a maidservant.

"Master, the person Madam mentioned last time has arrived and is waiting outside."

"Which person?" Luo Yangming couldn't recall for a moment.

"The accountant you said you were looking for..."

"Oh, oh, I remember now."

Because of the Relief Bureau's many affairs, and because Li Wensheng had risked his life by slipping out of the city and was now an old man of sixty after all—having spent a night roughing it outside the walls, his health was inevitably affected—Luo Yangming was often at the Relief Bureau. After Li Wensheng had struggled along for half a month, he felt he truly couldn't continue and proposed to resign.

Resignation was out of the question. First, this was his family's old manager who had always been "loyal and steadfast"—from any angle, he had an obligation to provide for him in his old age. Second, a capable rice shop manager wasn't easy to find. So Luo Yangming proposed hiring an additional accountant to help with bookkeeping and clerical work, leaving Li Wensheng to just oversee things.

Since they only needed an accountant, anyone who could write and calculate would do—a perfect choice for a down-on-his-luck scholar. Quite a few people had come to recommend candidates, and even Ding Atao had put forward someone. She said he was a relative by marriage of the daughter of the Jiang Family Silk Shop on West Street, a man from Tengxian. The roads having been blocked by the fighting, he was stranded in the area.

"Show him in."

At first sight, the visitor was a Confucian scholar in his early fifties, somewhat shabby in his attire. Yet his eyes held a spark of vital spirit, and his speech and bearing were thoroughly poised and confident. Luo Yangming saw at once that this was no ordinary impoverished scholar—he must have seen something of the great world beyond.

He probed: "May I ask what line of work Master Hao was in before?"

The visitor was none other than Yi Haoran. The Jiang Family Silk Shop had some dealings with Luo Yangming's rice business, so before her marriage, Jiang Qiuchan had had some acquaintance with Ding Atao, and they had built up a social connection. When Yi Haoran needed to find work, and Luo Yangming was looking for an accountant, she took the opportunity to recommend this "uncle-by-marriage."

"This student long resided in other provinces," Yi Haoran said, knowing that his appearance and bearing were not those of an ordinary pedantic tutor. "I mostly served as a private tutor in the households of officials and nobles."

From Luo Yangming's perspective, regardless of the "private tutor in official households" background, the fact that he came from Tengxian, an "enemy-occupied area," would have been grounds for immediate rejection. But at the moment, he felt somewhat guilty toward Ding Atao and couldn't bear to directly go against her wishes. So he examined the man's calligraphy and tested his abacus skills, finding both to be excellent; his speech and responses were also quite good—to be honest, working as an accountant was beneath his talents. Moreover, Ding Atao had said he was stranded here due to "the roads being blocked by fighting," which indicated he hadn't originally intended to stay long. Using him for a short term shouldn't be a problem. Besides, he was only asking for three meals and lodging, with wages "as you see fit"—a very high-quality "cheap laborer." So he agreed on the spot.

"The room here is ready-made. Just move in whenever it's convenient for you. Do you have any luggage? I'll send some of my workers to help you."

"I'll move in tonight," Yi Haoran said. "I originally came to Wuzhou just for some sightseeing and to visit relatives—I never expected to be stranded here by the fighting. What luggage could I have?"

---

Yi Haoran hurriedly finished his lunch and headed to the Relief Bureau.

The Relief Bureau was set up in the City God Temple by Wuzhou's west gate—supposedly so that everyone would be too ashamed to "cheat their conscience"—since the Relief Bureau handled large sums of grain and money. Luo Yangming knew that the Bureau had remained "clean" so far, though this had little to do with the City God's supervision and everything to do with fear of the Australians' "harsh laws and severe punishments."

That said, petty theft, corner-cutting, substituting inferior goods, and padding labor accounts were still inevitable—Luo Yangming took this in stride. Such things couldn't be avoided even in Lingao. Wuzhou had only just been liberated, and most of the personnel used were holdovers from the old system. With only those few cadres who had come up from the south, they were so busy they could barely walk and talk at the same time. Getting the relief work done to a passable degree was already good enough; as for the rest, they could only turn a blind eye.
