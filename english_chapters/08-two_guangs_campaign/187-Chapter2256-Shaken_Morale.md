# Chapter 2256: Shaken Morale

The order to abandon Qinglian Market and run was issued very quickly. Although Feng Haijiao had set up a Central Army and an Old Camp following the style of government troops since getting the title of "Squad Leader," and selected more than twenty trusted minions as "personal guards," and randomly bestowed titles like Team Officer to his subordinate leaders, in reality, he still followed the old style of a water bandit. Everything was done by directly dispatching his personal guards, while the leaders below were not trusted. The only force he could truly control was his original group of a hundred or so men. When this "moving" order was passed down, although the entire Qinglian Market immediately bustled with chaotic activity, it was busyness without order. By the afternoon of the next day, more than half of the people had still not packed their luggage.

His subordinates had doubts in their hearts, not knowing what the situation was at the place they were going. Many people's homes were in nearby villages. Hearing they had to leave, they were naturally uneasy about leaving their families behind, but the hardships of running away with families were obvious—not to mention whether there would be houses to live in or grain to eat upon arrival was unknown. Inevitably, people were panic-stricken, crying and shouting.

The bandits who had recently defected to join were originally here to take advantage of the situation. Now that the wind direction had changed, they were not optimistic about Feng Haijiao’s prospects. Hearing he wanted to abandon Qinglian Market and run, they felt even more panicked. Some minions whose homes were nearby thought that they were just ordinary minions, becoming bandits just to make some extra money. Now that Feng Haijiao’s "wind" was not favorable, why follow him to abandon home and property to run away? Immediately, people used excuses like "going to pick up family members" or "going back to arrange family affairs" to slip away home in twos and threes.

Feng Haijiao couldn't care about these—his family had been entrenched locally for many years and had accumulated a huge amount of wealth. Just packing luggage and soft valuables kept them incredibly busy. At this moment, the residence was shrouded in an atmosphere of panic and alarm. Stewards shouted, directing servants to carry heavy valuables in and out. The spirit screen outside the gate was piled high with boxes and cages, and piles upon piles of things were arranged in the courtyard, waiting for porters to load them onto boats. Female dependents and maids were busily packing gold, silver, and soft valuables in the rooms.

Feng Haijiao sat in the study, looking calm in the face of chaos. Occasionally, stewards came to ask if a certain item should be taken or how to dispose of it, and he answered them one by one, like a most astute and capable housewife.

Over years of business, the wealth accumulated in the residence was vast. Some were his beloved items, but many objects were either bulky or fragile, inconvenient to transport. he could only painfully part with them, abandoning them in the residence.

"Master, this jewelry-inlaid screen..." The steward came to ask again.

Feng Haijiao knew what the steward was asking about. This screen had twelve panels in total, very large in size, made of red sandalwood, inlaid with islands, sea fish, and sailing ships made of various precious materials—he had robbed it from a merchant ship in his youth. It was said to be a treasure ordered by a foreign noble for use in a palace.

Since this item fell into Feng Haijiao’s hands, he loved it too much to put it down and displayed it at home. Strangely enough: since robbing this screen, his "business" had been smooth sailing, getting bigger and bigger. Feng Haijiao had always regarded it as his "lucky object," always placing it in the center of the main room of his study. As long as he saw this huge screen that made the room feel congested, he would feel that his fortune was still flourishing.

Now that he had to run, this huge and very heavy screen was obviously difficult to transport. It was fine on the boat, but once off the boat and walking on mountain roads, not only would transportation be difficult, but bumps and collisions along the way would also be unavoidable.

Feng Haijiao pondered for a moment, looking at the huge screen for a long time without speaking. The steward tentatively said, "Master! The small one will call people to prepare more reed mats and straw ropes. How about we wrap it carefully and hide it in a cave by the river, seal the outside with loose stones, guaranteeing no one can tell..."

Feng Haijiao thought over and over, stomped his foot and said, "Find more straw mats for wrapping, grab more porters, and take it!"

No matter how difficult the current situation was, he couldn't lose this "lucky object" that brought him fortune. Bandits were often very superstitious and attached great importance to these things; Feng Haijiao was no exception.

The steward opened his mouth but dared not persuade further. He knew how much meaning this item had for Feng Haijiao, and naturally dared not defy the decision of this murderous demon king. He withdrew to call people to grab porters and scrounge for materials.

After arranging this "lucky object," Feng Haijiao let out a breath of turbid air, feeling less irritable and uneasy. The screen was still there, his "luck" was still there. As long as he could safely reach the mountain stockade, maybe there was still a chance to turn the tables! The Australians surely wouldn't chase into the deep mountains and old forests. When the government troops returned, he would come down the mountain to assist in the battle, and would still have this good family business—of course, by then he would probably have received the imperial court's title and be a proper gentry master...

While Feng Haijiao was immersed in this beautiful dream, someone suddenly burst in, flustered and exasperated.

"Master!"

Feng Haijiao frowned, turned his head and asked, "Why so panicked?!"

The person who entered was his personal guard leader Mo Chong, who was somewhat related to him by marriage. Although not much good at fighting, he had always been good at fawning and liked to slander others behind their backs. Thus he won the favor of this "cousin-uncle" and was regarded as a confidant. He became even more reckless in prying into others' privacy and eavesdropping on fragments of words. Because of this, he had harmed many people. Not only did the commoners suffer deeply from him, but there were also quite a few people in the bandit gang who had tasted his bitterness.

Mo Chong let his hands hang down and said, "Just now I was watching outside and saw many family members of the brothers coming... They said they wanted to migrate with the team, but they didn't bring luggage or dry provisions. They came in empty-handed and stealthily, found their relatives, pulled them aside to whisper, hiding from others so they wouldn't hear. There is probably a big plot in this..."

It turned out that at noon on the second day after the order to pack luggage was given, new chaos appeared in Qinglian Market: family members of the bandit gang entered the town one by one. Wives looked for husbands, parents looked for sons. Some pulled, some persuaded, some made a scene, some cried. Feng Haijiao’s group was originally a mob. Many people were quickly impacted by this huge wave, becoming fragmented and chaotic.

Thus, various news spread with invisible wings: "Going home you can live, caught you will be killed surely!" "The Li barbarian female magistrate is transferring tens of thousands of Li and Miao soldiers from Qiongzhou Prefecture; there will be soldiers everywhere in the mountain gullies." "Can't even eat rice a few times; officers eat the good stuff, we small soldiers eat the ugly stuff!" "At home owed rent and got spanked by moneybags; here late for roll call and got beaten with military cudgels by leaders. Poor people get bullied everywhere!" "Government, government my ass! Xiong Wencan himself is going to be beheaded, why go die with them officials!" The bandits' hearts wavered. The originally sneaky running away turned into open action. Many bold ones had already taken their things and left with their relatives...

Hearing his words, Feng Haijiao flew into a rage: "This is outrageous! If I don't kill one to warn a hundred, do they think this place is a playground?! Kill! Kill! Kill!" Saying this, he reached out and grabbed his waist saber, intending to go out and see clearly.

Just reaching the door, he encountered Bi Xuansheng. Seeing him angrily taking his sword to go out, Bi Xuansheng pretended to be surprised, "Master, why the anger?"

"These brats who newly joined the dock, haven't fought a battle but ate my grain for months for free. Now that we need to move, each one runs like a rabbit!" Feng Haijiao said hatefully, "I have to let them see what military law is like."

"Yes, without this we cannot awe the military heart." Bi Xuansheng hurriedly fawned. He watched Feng Haijiao go out, glanced at Mo Chong following behind, and nodded slightly.

Carrying a whip and leading a dozen personal guards, Feng Haijiao rushed angrily to the market square. It was piled chaotically with sundries, with bandits and family members shuttling back and forth, a noisy scene of busyness.

He looked around and indeed saw quite a few women in the market, old and young, some dragging children—mostly unfamiliar faces, obviously family members of minions who had recently sought refuge. Seeing them pulling and pushing with the minions, weeping and wailing, Feng Haijiao became even more annoyed, feeling these family members were here to ruin his business.

"Unfamiliar faces, arrest them all for me!" He waved the whip in his hand and shouted the order.

The personal guards beside him acting like wolves and tigers, instantly bound more than ten female family members with ropes, escorted them to Feng Haijiao, and shouted loudly: "Kneel!"

Feng Haijiao raised his horse whip and scolded: "You bold demon women! With a big battle imminent, you dare to infiltrate the camp and confuse the crowd with rumors! Speak: who told you to come!"

Those arrested were all rural women. Because they heard Squad Leader Feng's team was moving, they hurriedly came to visit their men at home. Naturally, some advised their men to run, but most women were timid and afraid of trouble, not daring to instigate their men to go home. They just brought some clothes and dry food to send off, to avoid freezing and starving on the march. Also to say a few intimate words; if the man had a few taels of pay silver or a few pieces of looted soft valuables to bring home, that would be best.

Unexpectedly, before saying a few words, they were bound and escorted to Feng Haijiao.

Who Feng Haijiao was, no one in Yangshan County didn't know. Seeing this evil star looking fierce, the family members were all scared out of their wits. Letting him scold for half a day, finally someone tremblingly responded:

"We slaves heard Master Feng's team was moving, feared our men would be short of clothing and food in the team, so came to send clothing and food."

"Nonsense! I see you are spies! Here to bewitch the military heart." Feng Haijiao stomped in fury. "Drag them down, kill them all!"

The market square instantly went into an uproar. A dozen minions busily came over, knelt down together to Feng Haijiao, kowtowed and wailed, saying these were their old mothers and wives coming to send clothes and dry food, not daring to instigate desertion. To show what they said was true, they took out the tattered clothes and black, hard miscellaneous grain cakes they brought.

"Master!" One of the minions inside said, "If they told the small ones to flee, why send clothes and dry food? The small one's home is just ten *li* away. If I really wanted to run, I would run empty-handed. Please investigate clearly, Master!"
