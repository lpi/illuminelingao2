# Chapter 2092 - The Spy in Wuzhou

Having heard that enemies would "cut the grass and dig up the roots," Luo Yangming had fled with his family overnight to Guangzhou. Along the way, family members were lost or separated; by the time they reached Guangzhou, only his aged mother remained—and she had contracted the epidemic, hovering near death. At his wit's end, Luo Yangming was fortunate to be taken in by the Guangzhou Station, which was everywhere recruiting manpower. His mother received treatment; both mother and son settled in Lingao.

Luo Yangming was literate, had studied for several years, and had helped his father manage their rice shop. Fresh out of the quarantine camp, he caught the eye of several departments. Ultimately, he was selected to work at the Foreign Trade Committee for a year, where his business talents emerged and drew high praise from Sikkert, Li Mei, and others. But Luo Yangming's ambitions lay elsewhere. He was consumed by vengeance, and the transmigration group's constant ideological conditioning had deepened his hatred of the Ming government. When he learned by chance that the External Intelligence Bureau was recruiting trainees, he resolutely abandoned his promising career at the Foreign Trade Committee and submitted an application to the Intelligence Bureau, hoping to return to the mainland and exact revenge on that rotten Ming bureaucracy.

In training, he studied diligently and trained hard, always ranking near the top. He was among the outstanding graduates of his class of intelligence trainees. After graduation, Jiang Shan had hoped Luo Yangming would stay at headquarters, but Luo refused and volunteered for frontline work.

Before departure, Jiang Shan asked him: "Frontline work is extremely dangerous. If you're captured, you'll certainly be executed as a spy—the Center won't have time to rescue you. Have you thought this through?"

"I have. I want to serve the Council of Elders wherever they need me most," Luo Yangming replied.

So Luo Yangming was dispatched to Wuzhou, posing as a Guangzhou merchant, to go underground in the city. To facilitate his work, with Qiwei's help, the Intelligence Bureau eventually located his wife and sister, who had been sold during the flight. Only his son—sold to a passing merchant—could never be found.

He brought his family to Wuzhou and opened a grain warehouse. Jiang Shan had not assigned him a dedicated assistant. His instructions to Luo were simple: "Be self-sufficient like a true merchant." Aside from a monthly courier, he had no contact with "the Center." Beyond initial startup funds, the Center provided no further financial support or operational expenses—only permitting him to keep and use the profits from his grain trade.

During his years in Wuzhou, Luo Yangming cultivated connections with the government and built good business relationships with many local merchants. Through these networks, he gathered substantial intelligence on Wuzhou and even the entire Guangxi Province, which flowed continuously back to Lingao via the courier network. For his achievements in intelligence work, Luo Yangming had received commendations from the External Intelligence Bureau.

About ten days ago, he had received instructions via courier: The Fubo Army would soon launch operations against Wuzhou; he should take care of his safety. The instructions added: if the situation became critical, he could evacuate from Wuzhou to the outskirts temporarily. After Wuzhou's liberation, he should return to the city and contact the Fubo Army's Joint Logistics Department, supplying the grain in his warehouse for military provisions—this would be his final assignment in Wuzhou.

He had no intention of leaving the city. After all, his business and home were here. If he fled to the countryside, looters might take advantage of the confusion during the city's capture, causing losses he couldn't explain to the Center. Moreover, his family were mostly women and children; there was no suitable refuge in the countryside—they'd be even more vulnerable to rural bandits.

The Fubo Army rarely conducted prolonged sieges; typically, they took a city in half a day to a day. He just needed to wait calmly in the city for them to arrive.

He went over his accounts for a while, calculated receivables and payables, and checked the warehouse's cash and grain figures. Though he had managed this grain business for years, it was the Council's property. In another ten-odd days, he would hand it over completely to the Council.

His wives and sister probably didn't know this estate wasn't his. Thinking back to when he'd recovered his wife—after they'd embraced and wept together, the delighted expression on her face when she saw the "fortune" he'd supposedly earned... If she knew it wasn't really his, what expression would she wear then?

As for what he'd do after returning the business, Luo Yangming had never considered. Perhaps he'd return to a commercial department. He understood the Intelligence Bureau's personnel principles clearly: once an operative was used, even if their identity wasn't blown, they wouldn't be used a second time.

Just then, a woman's voice came softly from the counting-room door: "Master! Master!"

It sounded like his wife. Luo Yangming said: "What is it? Come in and speak."

In walked a young woman of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, hair done up in a paojia bun, face lightly powdered. She wore a lotus-pink narrow-sleeved vest and a patterned plain-colored long skirt, already half-worn. Her features weren't striking, but she had regular features, fair skin, and was reasonably attractive.

His wife was surnamed Ding, known as A-Tao. Her birth family had been small merchants in Sanshui—now long since ruined. During their flight, short on travel money, Luo had pawned her to a wealthy household as a secondary wife. Though he'd later redeemed her, she'd already borne a child in that household.

By custom, children born to pawned wives belonged to the receiving family; when the term expired or the woman was redeemed, she couldn't take the children with her.

She longed for the child she'd borne while pawned, and was haunted by that "shameful" period of belonging to another man. So her face always wore a melancholy expression, as if some heavy burden weighed on her brow.

"Well? Have all the doors been secured?"

"All secured," A-Tao said. Like young wives from "scholarly families," she was gentle and quiet, never speaking loudly. "The workers have barred the doors as you ordered, and piled straw bales and stones against them. Only the side door is still open, also barred."

Before he could ask more, A-Tao continued: "I've checked our food stores. Rice—naturally we have plenty. Salted vegetables and dried fish too. Just a little short on firewood."

Luo Yangming nodded. "Has A-Chun returned?"

A-Chun was the young shop hand—an orphan he'd taken in, only fifteen years old. He ran errands and did odd jobs around the house and warehouse. Early this morning, Luo had sent him out to gather news.

Because of the "pirates'" approach, Wuzhou was tense. A grain warehouse was a prime target for both the government and mobs during wartime. So for several days, Luo had kept the doors closed—fortunately the warehouse dealt in bulk trade, not retail; closing didn't cause public panic.

"Just got back."

"Any news from the streets?"

A-Tao shook her head gloomily. "They say only the north and south gates opened today; the other gates stayed shut. Some say the pirates' fast boats have already left Fengchuan..."

She sat down with a sigh: "How can we survive in times like these! We barely managed a few peaceful years, and now these accursed pirates! Seizing Qiongzhou wasn't enough—they have to take all of Guangdong too!"

She cursed the pirates through gritted teeth. Luo Yangming smiled faintly and comforted her: "Don't be afraid. Everyone says the Australians love their people like children, have strict discipline, and never loot or burn. Wuzhou will probably be fine."

"Even if the pirates are as good as you say—you run a rice warehouse. War means grain requisitions. What if the government comes for grain? What if there's a siege and mobs come to plunder?... Alas..." The woman's brow furrowed; she couldn't say more.

Her worries were reasonable, but for Luo Yangming these weren't concerns. He consoled her: "Don't worry. The Australians take cities lightning-fast. In three to five days, this place will be under Great Song rule."

"But I keep worrying... A-Chun says: quite a few wealthy families left the city today with their households."

"Probably fleeing to fortified villages in the countryside."

"But government offices have lost many people too. The city granaries are shipping grain out. Could Governor Xiong be preparing to abandon the city and flee...?"

Luo Yangming started: "What did you say?"

"A-Chun says soldiers are moving grain outside the city—the docks are piled high with it..."

"Bring him here—I need to question him myself!"
