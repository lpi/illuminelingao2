# Chapter 2096 - The Intelligence Conference

Before long, the sentries were sprawled around the gate tower, mumbling: "Good wine! Good wine!" These country bumpkins—to them any wine was good wine. This was just cheap watered wine, doctored with knockout drops.

Luo Yangming sneered inwardly, but he had no time for such trifles. He quickly took down the Australian oil lamp hanging from the carrying-pole and began signaling toward the city's exterior.

If possible, Luo Yangming would not have chosen such an inefficient method as Morse code to transmit intelligence. The code's nature demanded the briefest possible messages. He much preferred traditional methods—using the courier network, he could compose a detailed intelligence analysis.

But Luo Yangming had no choice now, and there was no guarantee anyone would even respond. He sent the same message over and over: "I am Lone Wolf. Please respond!"

Every External Intelligence Bureau operative had a codename. Luo Yangming's was "Lone Wolf." Right now, he truly felt like a lone wolf—isolated, without support, fighting alone.

After countless transmissions, Luo Yangming grew weary, hope fading. The night was half gone—should he give up?

Then the Fubo Army fleet on the West River sent back a signal: "This is the Center. Message received."

"The Center" was the External Intelligence Bureau's designation for "headquarters." Seeing this signal, he relaxed completely. The Fubo Army had not only noticed his signal—there was an intelligence officer among them. This made things much easier. Luo Yangming felt a surge of excitement, but an excellent operative's discipline quickly steadied him.

Luo Yangming immediately transmitted three messages. Just then, his seemingly abnormal behavior caught someone's attention.

As on every previous night, Yang Yi was on watch at Nanxun Gate tower. Fortunately, tonight a rice merchant from the city had come bearing wine and meat for the troops. The wine was strong, went straight to the head—good stuff. Yang Yi felt he hadn't drunk much yet was already getting drunk, unsteady on his feet.

He didn't know how long he'd been out, but eventually some awareness returned. He wanted to drink more, eat more meat—only to discover Luo Yangming by the battlements, furtively doing something.

Luo Yangming was manipulating the Australian lamp's cover, opening and shutting it, making the light blink on and off. Yang Yi was puzzled and called out: "What are you doing?"

Luo Yangming was startled but deliberately showed no reaction. This soldier had drunk drugged wine yet woken so quickly—his constitution was truly unusual. But Luo Yangming had no time to express surprise. He feigned calm: "Nothing, soldier."

Then, seeing it was Yang Yi who'd challenged him, Luo Yangming instantly formulated a response.

He decided to silence him permanently. He couldn't let his odd behavior be reported. The Ming had already begun killing people indiscriminately throughout the city; the slightest suspicion meant death as a spy. Luo Yangming still wanted to see the day when the Council of Elders' glory illuminated the whole world. So Yang Yi had to die!

Yang Yi was greedy. From the way he'd persistently begged for reward money when Luo had brought the wine and meat up, that was obvious. Luo Yangming drew a piece of silver weighing over an ounce from his coat and waved it at Yang Yi: "Soldier—come here. This is for you."

Yang Yi swallowed and was drawn toward the battlement. Luo Yangming mentally rehearsed the combat techniques he'd learned in intelligence training. In an instant, fast as wind and thunder, he darted forward, seized Yang Yi's head with both hands, and twisted sharply—snapping his neck. Luo Yangming caught the body, gave it a gentle push, and sent it tumbling down the wall's outer face.

Before dawn on April 13, an emergency intelligence analysis meeting convened at the First Mixed Brigade headquarters on Changzhou Island, prompted by the three messages just received from the agent codenamed "Lone Wolf" inside Wuzhou. Attendees included the four Elders currently near Wuzhou—Zhu Mingxia, Zhu Quanxing, and Xu Ke—plus several trusted senior naturalized officers: Eighth Battalion Commander Yang Zeng, Siege Artillery Company Commander Zhang Dapao, and Pearl River Task Force Detachment Commander Schneider. Zhu Mingxia chaired the meeting.

The first agenda item: analyze the three pieces of critical intelligence. This part fell mainly to Xu Ke. Zhu Mingxia didn't intend to comment; no one else in the room would either—after all, apart from scattered briefings, Xu Ke was the only one who understood the situation.

The atmosphere was distinctly chilly. Aside from the brass kettle on the coal stove, just now boiled and hissing steam, no one seemed inclined to speak—including Xu Ke, who was supposed to lead the first item. Zhu Mingxia understood: as the actual supreme commander of the Wuzhou campaign and meeting chair, he had to break the silence.

He glanced at Zhang Dapao: "Um, Xiao Zhang—pour the tea."

Zhang Dapao had the least seniority present. Though his name "Big Cannon" sounded intimidating, he was probably the youngest of the eight people there—hard to say whether he or Ruan Xiaowu was younger. Undoubtedly, "Dapao" was some Elder's whimsy—either Lin Shenhe or Ying Yu had given him that name. Zhang Dapao was an outstanding graduate of the Artillery NCO Academy, rising from artillery private to company commander in a few years, promoted from private to lieutenant. Quite promising.

"Right!" Zhang Dapao answered briskly, then turned to lift the kettle and pour water into everyone's cups. Tea leaves were already in the cups; the boiling water set them churning.

"Everyone have some tea first—wake up," Zhu Mingxia said casually. "This is from the spoils at the Governor-General's office in Zhaoqing. Haven't had time to share it with you—probably some fine stuff Xiong Wenchan had stashed away."

The atmosphere seemed to ease somewhat. Some picked up their cups and sipped slowly; others blew into their cups, waiting for the tea to cool enough to gulp down.

"Staff Officer Xu—have some tea and then begin your report," Zhu Mingxia pivoted. Xu Ke moistened his throat with tea and commenced.

"After Lone Wolf received our acknowledgment, he sent back three critical pieces of intelligence: first, 'A spy has defected to the Ming'; second, 'If the Ming are defeated, they will burn the city'; third, 'Most grain stores have been shipped out.' The first item is somewhat vague: all we can confirm is that Xiong Wenchan has gained assistance from a defector familiar with our army's tactical characteristics—otherwise Lone Wolf wouldn't have specifically mentioned a 'spy.'

"We can basically rule out the possibility of one of our officers defecting to the Ming camp. Our personnel files are complete; deceased officers all have detailed casualty reports, and the few missing-in-action cases can generally be presumed dead with bodies unrecoverable. We have no records of officers being captured or defecting. Therefore, this spy is most likely a deserter who went AWOL, or possibly an infiltrator who had been embedded in our forces. He cannot be an ordinary civilian or naturalized cadre; outside the Army and Navy systems, naturalized personnel have little knowledge of our tactics."

If this traitor was merely a deserter, he'd only be familiar with squad and platoon tactics; his understanding of company-level and higher operations wouldn't exceed anyone else's. Lone Wolf's emphasis on him seemed somewhat excessive.

"The second and third items can be analyzed together. First, they indicate the Ming have no certainty of victory in this battle." This drew laughter around the room. Zhu Mingxia coughed twice, signaling for quiet.

Xu Ke sipped his tea and continued: "...Otherwise they wouldn't have adopted such a self-destructive backup plan. Whether burning the city or shipping out the grain, the obvious purpose is to make it impossible for our army to hold Wuzhou after taking it, forcing us to withdraw—so Xiong Wenchan can claim a 'recovery' and redeem himself. What Xiong Wenchan is thinking isn't our concern. But his preparation to burn the city indicates he intends to fight street battles, luring our main force into the city before setting it ablaze—a 'Burning of Xinye' stratagem."
