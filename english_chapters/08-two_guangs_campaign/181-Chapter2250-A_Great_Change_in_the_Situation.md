# Chapter 2250: A Great Change in the Situation

Ten *jin* of salt was nothing in the Han areas, but for the Yao areas, which had been blockaded for a long time and could only eat high-priced salt, it was a small fortune.

"I will give you another salt ticket for one thousand *jin* of salt. Take it back and distribute it to the families of the able-bodied men from the stockades who died in battle. You should also distribute some to the families of the other able-bodied men who are still serving in our county, as you see fit."

Of this one thousand *jin* of salt, Pan Tianshun and the other Yao leaders would certainly take a share. However, the Yao people still retained a strong element of communal society; headmen positions were not hereditary, nor could they completely obscure the sky with one hand. Therefore, Bi Da handed the salt ticket to him for distribution.

Pan Tianshun left happily. Bi Da’s three days of "recovering loot" at Dalang Market yielded a bountiful harvest. Sun Dabiao had originally resisted confessing to the death—he was indeed tough, refusing to loosen his mouth no matter how severe the torture. It was only when the yamen runners chopped off three of his grandson's fingers in front of him and then gestured with a knife at his grandson's "life root" (genitals) that Sun Dabiao finally collapsed completely. To prevent him from concealing anything else, the Sun family grandson ultimately lost six fingers.

Bi Da interrogated for loot at Dalang Market for three days, flogging over ten people to death. Soldiers and laborers dug up Dalang Market thoroughly, recovering a great deal of gold, silver, and soft valuables. The gold, silver, and wealth Sun Dabiao and his leaders had buried in Dalang Market were almost completely exhausted by the excavation.

Although the minor minions were not subjected to "torture for loot," after watching three days of the "big show," when the naturalized cadres asked them to "voluntarily hand over illicit goods," every one of them scrambled to empty their pockets and hand over their accumulated gold, silver, and soft valuables. Although most only had three to five taels of silver, gathering sand into a tower resulted in a quite bountiful income. Some who could not produce silver implored that their silver had already been used to build houses or marry wives, begging only to be allowed home to sell their houses and wives to "pay the loot."

Bi Da stayed at Dalang Market for six or seven days, handling all affairs. She left Luo Yiming and half a company of the National Army to garrison the place, while she herself led the team to escort the prisoners and goods back to the county seat.

With money and grain in hand, getting things done became much easier. Bi Da immediately ordered the local recruitment of able-bodied men in the county. Combined with the Yao able-bodied men brought by Pan Tianshun, they were formed into two new companies. Although they had no rifles and could only use cold weapons, there was no problem with them guarding the county seat and patrolling the roads.

The news that the female magistrate sent by the Australians had personally gone into battle and achieved a complete victory in the surprise attack on Dalang Market spread throughout the county in these few days. Sun Dabiao had entrenched himself in Dalang Market for generations, and successive county magistrates had been helpless against him. Unexpectedly, this female magistrate operated on him as soon as she arrived. Not only did she flatten Dalang Market in one night, she also captured several hundred bandits alive, and even Sun Dabiao himself failed to escape. This forced the local powerful households, who had originally harbored suspicions about the Australians, to re-examine their attitude toward them.

Many people came to both Dalang Market and the county seat these days. In the bustling markets of both places after the disaster, they were full of "farmers" and "peddlers" who bought nothing and sold nothing. They silently listened to what others said, squeezed into crowds to read proclamations, and also went to look at the heads that had already begun to turn black.

When Zhang Tianbo’s head was hung at the county gate, it caused a small sensation. Not only did the commoners in the county seat vie to watch, but commoners from neighboring villages who had suffered from his scourge also flocked over. For a time, people cried and laughed in before the head, throwing stones and tile shards at the head box—it was a chaotic scene, and the guarding National Army soldiers had to disperse the crowd.

However, this was nothing compared to the subsequent "Living Person Display": Bi Da ordered dozens of wooden cages to be erected in front of the county yamen, confining Sun Dabiao, his family members, and the captured bandit leaders inside for display. This caused a sensation throughout the county. For a time, spectators blocked the way in the county seat. Not only did the county seat commoners come to watch, but even commoners from the most remote parts of the county rushed over. The front of the county yamen was like a bustling market. Large groups of onlookers gathered at all times, cursing before the cages and throwing things—in a short time, all the garbage on the county streets disappeared, and the front of the county yamen became filthy mess. Later, because people threw feces, creating a stench that reached the heavens, an order was finally issued prohibiting the throwing of garbage at the cages. However, this torment was enough to leave the people in the cages dying; every day, dead or dying prisoners were pulled out of the cages and beheaded for public display.

The front of the county yamen was crowded with commoners filing complaints. Bi Da instructed that all complaints be accepted without exception and posted entirely on the spirit screen in front of the county yamen. Among the wall full of complaints, many were written in blood, mixed among the black ink on white paper, shocking to the eye like sprayed bloodstains.

Bi Da was not in a hurry for the final reckoning—she already had a plan in her heart for how to settle accounts. She wanted the public sentiment to ferment fully, forming a state urgent enough to explode, before lighting the fuse, thereby thoroughly shaking the foundations of the various powerful households in the county. So after returning these past few days, she allowed the commoners to abuse the prisoners, but maintained a degree—at least the main bandit leaders could not be killed; they were to be saved for the finale.

On one hand, she cleared the county streets, provided relief to the commoners, and repaired the city walls; on the other hand, she restored the system of National Army patrols along county roads. After this battle, public security in the county improved drastically: scattered bandits that had originally been active outside the county seat, and rampant bandit activities throughout the county, now completely vanished in the areas neighboring the county seat.

The county cadres, encouraged by this victory, saw their originally low morale rise significantly. You Ciren, disregarding that his body had not yet recovered, persisted in working every day. Even Peng Shou’an’s spirit was much better than before—though he was still ashamed to see people.

On this day, Peng Shou’an was called to Bi Da’s office.

"Mr. Peng, it is time for you to make an appearance."

"Yes, this student is willing to serve."

"These are my personal letters. Prepare some meager gifts and visit each family." Bi Da handed him several letters. "These wealthy households are the ones you mentioned to me last time, who have a relatively upright reputation and some strength. Go and lobby them, asking them to set an example for the county."

The so-called example was naturally to stand on the platform for the county government—but this was not enough; the county also needed them to contribute money, grain, and manpower.

"Go talk to them. First, they must pay the Reasonable Burden. Second, they must each dispatch a number of able-bodied men to the county for employment—I won't mention the specific figures; let them report it themselves, but it cannot be lower than this number," Bi Da said.

"This student understands." Peng Shou’an now knew what the magistrate meant by a "generous gift." He was both happy and ashamed. "This student will definitely do his best! Alas, it is all scholars' empty talk harming the country..."

"You, sir, should not blame yourself. A scholar like you who can be pragmatic and willing to work is already one in a hundred," Bi Da said. "As for some past events, do not mention them again—it was all for official business."

Bi Da sent Peng Shou’an away. While she was working, Zhou Da suddenly announced: "There are bandit family members at the county yamen gate asking to see the Magistrate."

"I won't see them," Bi Da said.

"It's an old woman," Zhou Da seemed to have developed compassion. "She has been kneeling for a day and insists on seeing you."

"I don't have time. If she refuses to leave, arrest her, lock her up for a night, then release her."

"She says she is willing to offer all her family property plus her own life to beg for her son's life."

"Oh? Who is her son?" Bi Da put down her pen and asked.

"Jiang Xiaotian."

"It's him." Bi Da recalled. This person was also captured in this battle. Because he had an unimpressive appearance, with clear rough hands and feet full of calluses, looking like an ordinary farmer, he was thought to be just an ordinary minion. It was only when someone among the bandits, seeking to "atone for crimes with merit," bit him out that it was revealed he was the county's famous "Solo Bandit" Jiang Xiaotian.

Jiang Xiaotian was straightforward; after being identified, he admitted it. He even explained clearly where he hid his gold, silver, and soft valuables: buried at Li Shuangkian’s manor. A few days ago, the Mountain Company had just retrieved this floating wealth: a small water vat stuffed with gold and silver, many of which were women's jewelry.

Now that Jiang Xiaotian’s old mother had come to plead for mercy, it indicated he still had hidden property. This was worth interrogating properly.

"Summon her in."

"She has a few kinsmen who want to come in together," Zhou Da pleaded. "The old lady is advanced in years and her body is inconvenienced."

"Bring all three in." Bi Da glanced at Zhou Da, wondering if he had accepted a bribe from them.

After a while, two half-old men were seen supporting a white-haired old woman as they entered, kneeling before the hall to pay respects.

"You are Jiang Xiaotian’s mother?"

"It is this common woman," the old woman said tremblingly. "These two are elders of the Jiang family..."

It turned out these two old men were Jiang Xiaotian’s uncle and a solitary elder of his family's village.

"I heard you knelt in front of the yamen for a day asking to see me. What exactly is the matter?" Bi Da asked.

Watching this, Zhou Da secretly wondered. He had followed Bi Da to the county; this female official never accepted grand curtsies from others, nor did she have the habit of making people kneel to answer questions—the Australians were all like this. Why did she not even say "rise and speak" today?

"That Jiang Xiaotian has fallen to this state today is all because he was muddled himself; his crime is deserved!" The old woman said sorrowfully. "Only, he is this common woman’s only son... The four brothers of the Jiang family only have this single seedling. That he did not walk the correct path and committed robbery and murder outside is all because I failed to discipline him. I beg the Old Lord, considering that this common woman was widowed in her youth, and the Jiang family combines four branches into one son, to spare Jiang Xiaotian's life. This common woman is willing to take his place for his sins..." Saying this, she kowtowed repeatedly.

Beside her, Jiang's uncle also kowtowed and said, "This small one is also willing to take his place!" As he spoke, both sides presented a stack of papers. "This is all the land and real estate of the Jiang family, willing to offer it to redeem one or two of his crimes..."

The elder also spoke up to support: "Old Lord! Although this Jiang Xiaotian is a great river and lake bandit, he is a purely filial son. Not to speak of supporting his widowed mother for many years, his three uncles were also supported and buried by him. Serving relatives with supreme filial piety; although we are outsiders, we also feel his filial heart is sincere. We ask the Old Lord to spare him under your pen, sparing his life so the Jiang family has a successor; it would also be a meritorious deed."

"Speaking of which, presumably Jiang Xiaotian is also quite good to the village?" Bi Da opened her mouth to ask.
