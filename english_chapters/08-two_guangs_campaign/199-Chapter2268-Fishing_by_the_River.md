# Chapter 2268: Fishing by the River

"So it's you." Chang Qingyun said such a sentence upon seeing Yi Haoran, "I should have thought of it earlier."

Yi Haoran put down the bundle containing the account book and umbrella, saying leisurely: "Is it because of Jiang Suo?"

"Yes, given such a dull and foolish person as him, usually he only deals with you alone. How could he run errands for others."

Yi Haoran smiled, chose a stone by the river to sit down, and picked up a fishing rod: "Come, come, I borrowed this fishing rod from the fisherman over there—heard there are good fish in this river."

Chang Qingyun didn't want to fish at all, but knowing Yi Haoran was doing this to deceive people's eyes and ears, he had to take it, saying grumpily: "You really have elegant interest."

Yi Haoran picked up the fishing rod, didn't even hook bait, and threw it into the river bay, saying: "So what if dull? Rather a pure child at heart. This Wuzhou city is full of smart people; how many went up Bang Mountain to fight to death? My Dynasty lacks everything, only not lacking smart and clever people. Aren't you and I, trapped in Wuzhou now, also foolish people?"

"Alright, don't put a high hat on me," Chang Qingyun hooked an earthworm and let the fishing rod hang into the water, "Finding me with such great trouble, what matter is there to talk about?"

"Heard you are in the Australian captive camp now."

"Correct, I'm considered to have 'entered the palace a second time,' being an Australian captive for the second time."

Yi Haoran looked at his attire: "It seems this captive life is passing fairly okay."

"Naturally can't compare to being in Governor Xiong's Shogunate, just dragging out an ignoble existence in the world." Chang Qingyun sighed, "I've tossed about enough..." He gazed at the river surface, "Followed the army into Qiongzhou, a complete defeat. Captured alive by Hair thieves, tasted all kinds of humiliation, dragged out an existence, finally returned to the human world. Who expected to do the same old trade again! If I can be redeemed this time, I will return to my hometown to live in seclusion until old age."

Yi Haoran gazed at ripples on the water surface—this was a river bay, river water was slow, ripples appeared on the surface from time to time, probably quite a few fish underneath—not looking at him: "A real man stands between heaven and earth, not asking for merit and career, but seeking no shame in heart. You were also selected by Governor Xiong from insignificant ranks, a person who received his great grace—not to mention you are a dignified filial and honest *Juren*; Lord's grace is deep and heavy, don't you blush saying such words?"

Chang Qingyun sneered once, saying: "Old Yi, don't use the goading method on me. This heart of mine died long ago. We both know clearly, whether Australians can take the world is another matter, but separating and occupying the Two Guangs is as easy as turning a hand. Compared to the Jiannu, they are a hundred times better! When we were in Governor Xiong's staff, at any rate, Governor Xiong still had tens of thousands of generals and soldiers under his command, and backed by Guangxi, it couldn't be said impossible to fight. Now however hearing Guangxi prefectures and counties have lost more than half, Governor Xiong's whereabouts unknown, us two poor scholars, how can we serve the Imperial Court?"

Yi Haoran smiled: "Master Chang! I won't speak big principles. Could it be you really count on doing labor here, waiting for Hair thieves to let you go?"

"If Australians don't let me go, what use keeping me?" Chang Qingyun retorted, "I'm a person almost fifty, shoulder cannot carry, hand cannot lift, not engaged in farming, not skilled in hundred crafts, useless except for knowing characters. I am of *Juren* origin again; they originally didn't trust me, let alone keeping me to appoint as an official. Could it be Hair thieves have too much grain and rice, insisting on raising me, a rice weevil?"

"What if they want to borrow your head for a use?" Yi Haoran said softly, suddenly lifting the fishing rod, cursing: "Empty! Looks like must have fish bait!"

Chang Qingyun naturally knew Yi Haoran’s meaning. Once the "Burning City Plan" was known by Australians, his head inevitably might be used by Australians as a prop to win people's hearts.

"What kind of figure am I, that Australians want to borrow my head?" He pretended to be relaxed. "Besides, even if Australians have a thousand bad points, there is one good thing: never frame others. If they can't catch Chang Pu, they won't insist I am him."

"This statement is wrong." Yi Haoran tried to stimulate him with righteousness at first; seeing him indifferent, he could only resort to blackmail. This basin of dirty water had to be splashed on him to make him dead set—even if he couldn't play a big use, at least he wouldn't cause harm.

"Master Chang, the plan of burning Wuzhou, how can it be counted as a frame-up?" Yi Haoran still didn't look at him, "Leaving aside that Chang Pu was recommended by you initially, when he offered the plan, you were advising in detail by the side. Specifically wrote a hand-book to Governor Xiong—could it be Brother has forgotten?"

Now sweat dripped from Chang Qingyun’s forehead—not only did he write a hand-book agreeing with the plan of "burning Wuzhou," but he also raised many suggestions. If this hand-book fell into Australian hands, without them holding any trial, throwing him on the street would get him beaten to death alive by local commoners.

However, this hand-book was sent directly to Xiong Wencan’s official desk. Before Governor Xiong fled, he had burned many documents. Yi Haoran couldn't be counted as Governor Xiong's trusted aide; reasonably he shouldn't see it, let alone get the hand-book.

"Spouting yellow nonsense!" Chang Qingyun said anxiously, "I submitted many hand-books to Governor Xiong; when was there this hand-book?! You want to frame me, I won't sit and wait for death either! At worst the fish dies and the net breaks."

Yi Haoran suddenly smiled: "Brother Chang, if you want the fish to die and the net to break, it doesn't matter. Jiang Suo and I both crawled out of piles of dead people. His relatives were killed by Hair thieves, my relatives died under Jiannu's horse hooves. Both alone, without home or property. It doesn't matter when this life is handed over. If cherishing body, why stay in Wuzhou, and why insist on coming to find you?"

Chang Qingyun’s face turned pale. Although Yi Haoran’s face was calm, it revealed a "desperado's" fierceness.

Yi Haoran added: "Don't think your hand-book has been given to the Fire God—I have read it respectfully. The literary talent is truly not bad, making one can't help wanting to chant it..." Saying this, he started reciting the content of this hand-book from the beginning.

Actually, Chang Qingyun himself didn't remember the words and sentences in the hand-book very well. But when Yi Haoran read the first few sentences, the whole text suddenly surfaced in his mind, clear as if he just wrote it by himself.

Typically inexplicable fear gripped him: Could my hand-book have fallen into Yi Haoran’s hands? Neither Yi Haoran nor Jiang Suo was captured. Getting documents abandoned by Governor Xiong in the chaos of Wuzhou's fall was very possible...

Thinking of this, he couldn't help trembling: "Don't read anymore!"

Yi Haoran stopped, suddenly saying: "Fish hooked!" After saying this he lifted the fishing rod, hoisting up a large crucian carp.

Chang Qingyun watched him take the fish off and put it into the fish creel, lowering his head weakly, saying: "What do you want?"

Yi Haoran actually didn't have this hand-book in hand, but he had indeed studied it carefully several times back then, so he could remember the opening part. From the angle of strategy alone, he felt this was a clever plan—only damaging commoners too much, inevitably inhumane.

"Rest assured, don't need you to take any risks. I want to walk around in the Sanheui captive camp; still have to trouble you to arrange."

Chang Qingyun couldn't refuse, so he had to "join the gang." Yi Haoran spoke clearly: he and Jiang Suo were people with nothing, different from Master *Juren* Chang Qingyun who had home and property. Barefoot not afraid of wearing shoes. Moreover, he held evidence enough to take his life... This all made Chang Qingyun dare not resist.

Watching Chang Qingyun’s soul-lost back figure, Jiang Suo in the dark walked out, saying: "Is Master Chang reliable?"

"Of course not reliable." Yi Haoran said, "But he has home and property, cherishing life very much. Holding his vital point, naturally he will be at my disposal—only can't ask him to take big risks either. This person usually lacks backbone; if there is worry of life, can't guarantee he won't betray us."

Jiang Suo nodded silently: "Sir, what to do next?"

"How is Song Ming's side?"

"I have met with Zhang Yong. He said General Song, after being rescued from the river, was taken by personal soldiers to outside the city, surviving in a broken temple in the mountains. Still has several dozen brothers in hand—there are soldiers under him, and also part of the 'New Army' house guards originally under my command."

"Says surviving, actually acting as bandits. Song Ming’s subordinates are his own personal soldiers and house guards; both combat power and cohesion are stronger than ordinary bandits. Song Ming is not a person willing to degenerate either. Acting quite methodically, only finding rich households far away, asking them to "assist with provisions," amount not large either. If the other party refuses, with their combat power, killing back a hundred or so village braves is no problem. So often can succeed."

"How is his attitude towards us, willing to meet?"

"Originally very cold, not even very willing to accept your letter to General Song. Later he took the initiative to find me, saying General Song dare not forget the grace of you, Old Sir, and me saving his life, willing to meet."

"General Song is indeed a person of affection and righteousness." Yi Haoran nodded approvingly, "With him, our great matter is considered half done."

Although Second Master Gou also had a team of a hundred or so people in hand, he looked down on the combat power of such bandits. At the critical moment, still had to rely on Imperial Court troops like Song Ming.

"Zhang Yong appointed to meet you tomorrow at the Dragon Mother Temple outside Dayun Gate. He said General Song will also come then."

Not declining at all, showed Song Ming was not depressed like Chang Qingyun, still plotting something—with such loyal official and righteous warrior present, no matter how rampant Hair thieves were, there must be a day of defeat and death!

Yi Haoran thinking of this, unconsciously felt somewhat excited. Felt his strategy was originally somewhat "whimsical," now actually had the possibility of realization—could this be "Heaven's Will"?

He immediately reminded himself not to be anxious. Now in an enemy country, Hair thieves were known for strict patrols and investigation. Slightly careless, not only would he lose his life, but he would also implicate many loyal officials and righteous warriors.

Especially this Jiang Suo, these days he was the one running around; the risk involved was self-evident.

"You temporarily do this ferry boat business these few days, don't run around anymore, to avoid attracting attention. Meeting acquaintances, temporarily don't recognize either. Wait for me to meet these old people one by one then make plans." Yi Haoran instructed, "If there is urgent matter, just hide and conceal. I will go to Dragon Mother Temple every fifteenth; if you have no hindrance, meet there. Don't be impulsive when encountering things; keeping a useful body, only then can plan big things."

"Sir please rest assured, I still want to keep this life to kill a few true Australians!"
