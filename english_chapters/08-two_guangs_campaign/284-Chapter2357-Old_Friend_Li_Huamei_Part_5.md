# Chapter 2357: Old Friend Li Huamei (Part 5)

"Transparent." Guo Yi nodded slightly, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.

*Damn, why do these people all have the same tone?* Xu Yanliang couldn't help but complain in his mind. *Flat faces, emotionless tones, pedantic words...*

"Yes, transparent." Xu Yanliang repeated with emphasis.

"How exactly transparent?"

*This is asking me to make an offer.* Xu Yanliang thought, *There's a way!*
"How about this: the director of this Internal Security Department within the company will be concurrently held by me or a Director-level Senator of the Nanyang Company. You send a Senator or a naturalized cadre to serve as the executive deputy director. The specific business will naturally be managed by the executive deputy director. But relevant work must be approved and audited by the director. There cannot be any concealment."

"And then?"

"As the director, I guarantee that the company will not interfere with the daily work of the Security Department."

"Then I want to know, what benefits can the Bureau get?"

Xu Yanliang thought he heard wrong for a moment and quickly asked: "What did you say?"

"I said, what benefits can the Bureau get?"

This he indeed hadn't thought about, because in the view of the Nanyang Company leadership, the Political Security Bureau would inevitably establish a branch in the Nanyang Company. Even if they were unwilling, the Bureau would try every means to "infiltrate." Allowing them to exist and send people to manage was already a very generous condition.

"Isn't setting up PSB branches your job?"

"This requires approval from the Senate. So far, we haven't received such an approval document."

"Even if there isn't one now, there will be in the future."

"In that case, what kind of deal is this?" Guo Yi smiled, "This is selling me something that already belongs to me."

Xu Yanliang was stunned, then thought about it; it was indeed true.

"Then the Nanyang Company can also refuse the entry of the PSB agency..."

Guo Yi smiled: "If the Senate issues a document agreeing, that's no problem. But judging from my years of experience working at the Guangzhou Station, this is not very realistic."

Xu Yanliang thought about it and understood; the other party was not satisfied with just the condition of "not interfering in daily work": "Then tell me your conditions."

"I think the conditions you proposed are very reasonable, not excessive at all. The Bureau can also provide more goodwill: we can provide you with a list of all hidden cadres who will work in the Nanyang Company in the future, guaranteeing that their reports are 'controllable'." Guo Yi said.

This condition was even better than Xu Yanliang thought. But he knew that the better the conditions, the higher the asking price would be next.

"What do we need to pay?"

"Support the Bureau's work." Guo Yi said, "Not just in Nanyang."

*Good heavens!* Xu Yanliang thought this condition was not low. He pondered for a moment, looked up and asked: "Is this your meaning or..."

"Of course, this is the Bureau's meaning." Guo Yi said, "You don't have to answer me immediately."

Watching Xu Yanliang's figure walk out of the courtyard gate from the window, Guo Yi sat back at his desk, picked up a green telephone receiver, gave instructions softly, then lowered his head to write something on official paper. He put this draft paper into a kraft paper envelope, then took out a small square seal to stamp the seal. He pulled the bell rope casually.

The doorknob turned, and his secretary appeared at the door.

"I'll dictate, you draft the material." Guo Yi raised his hand and pointed to a small table piled with bound documents.

"Yes, Comrade Chief." The female secretary immediately sat down behind the small table, taking out pen and paper, "I'm ready."

"First, draft a memo in the name of the Political Security Bureau, send it to the State Council, copy to the Ministry of the Navy, Ministry of Colonization and Trade, General Office, Foreign Intelligence Bureau, and Nanyang Company. Its content includes the following points: First, our Bureau has decided to take a series of active measures to thoroughly eliminate the threat of the Li Siya group to us. The preliminary plan is through the current Southeast Asia Company shareholder, Navy Reserve Lieutenant Li Huamei channel; Second, it has been ascertained that Li Huamei had intersections with the Li Siya group in her personal history. Our Bureau intends to use this operation to clarify her true resume; Third, for this purpose, the Political Security Bureau will set up a special team within the Nanyang Company to execute this mission. That's all."

As he spoke, the female secretary noted down the key points sentence by sentence on the paper. Then she started writing.

Guo Yi picked up his teacup and drank a few mouthfuls. His temples were swelling a bit, and he massaged them with his hand. Since coming to the Political Security Bureau to be this division chief, in order to get familiar with the situation as soon as possible, he had been reading materials until midnight for many days—to be honest, working until midnight was not a rare thing among Senators. No matter in which department, there were offices and workshops with lights on at two or three o'clock in the morning. If not for the Ministry of Health and the General Office repeatedly reminding Senators that this would increase their chance of sudden death and launching "mandatory rest" patrol actions at night, there would be plenty of people staying up all night for several days in a row.

However, he was no longer quite adapted to such high-intensity work. When he was in Guangzhou, no matter how busy he was, he would go to "bed" by past ten o'clock. He had lived in such a slow and long medieval rhythm for almost ten years, and now returning to his old profession, he was somewhat unaccustomed.

Compared to Li Siya or Li Huamei, he knew that the Nanyang Company was the tricky existence. To some extent, the Nanyang Company would sooner or later become an existence like the British East India Company. The British government also spent some twists and turns and costs to deal with the East India Company back then. But they couldn't help but allow its existence and development; after all, realistic needs outweighed countless rational speculations.

Actually, neither Zhao Manxiong nor he was interested in setting up a branch in the Nanyang Company. The reason was simple: the vast ocean and broad Southeast Asia. Dropping a mere few "Committees of Ten" and reconnaissance teams down there would be like sprinkling sesame seeds. They didn't have radios available either and could only rely on mail sent back by regular ships to transmit news and orders. The PSB's management and command over them would exist in name only.

To carry out work in such an environment, it was fundamentally impossible without the full cooperation of the Nanyang Company. This was also the reason why Director Zhao was so "generous" on this matter.

"...Comrade Chief, the report is written!" The secretary interrupted his contemplation, "Please have a look."

Guo Yi quickly scanned the lines of correct, almost printed-effect characters, nodded, and picked up a pen to change "utilizing the special relationship between Li Huamei and Senator Qi" to "leveraging the recent change in Li Huamei's ideological tendency."

"Copy one for the file, then take it to be mimeographed." Guo Yi added, "Also, the summary of the Two Li Special Case file materials I asked you to do yesterday should be photocopied in the same number of copies as attachments. By the way, send one copy to Senator Wu Nanhai as well."

"Should we send the memo to Chief Wu? He is not on the copy list."

"Don't send it; only send the summary attachment to him."

"Understood." The female secretary repeated, "A total of six memos and seven summary appendices. Senator Wu Nanhai only gets the summary appendix."

"Correct. Here is the Top Secret document copy permission slip," Guo Yi said as he signed his name in the lower right corner of a straw-yellow form, "The classification of this letter and the attachments are both Top Secret."

Not long after the secretary left, she knocked and entered again, reporting that two trainee commanders had arrived under orders.

"Please let them in."

The door opened, and two young men wearing black uniforms walked in with standard strides. Their faces still retained the childishness of their teenage years, but their expressions were extremely serious. Their thin bodies maintaned a standard standing attention posture, and their bright eyes looked straight at Guo Yi by the desk.

"Comrade Chief! Trainee Commanders Lin Zhijian and Zheng Yicheng reporting for duty!" Mandarin with a faint Minnan accent.

As students of the PSB training class, Lin Zhijian and Zheng Yicheng could be said to be extremely representative types of "cadres the Senate is willing to cultivate." Both came from Minnan fishing families and were eighteen years old this year. Their resumes were also very similar. Most of their parents and family members died in natural and man-made disasters, and they were eventually taken in by the Senate.

Different from ordinary children with "bitter hatred," they were not orphans. The Political Security Bureau was actually not very keen on selecting "orphans." The common characteristic of these two people was that they both had relatives: one had a younger brother, and the other had a disabled grandmother. Both came out to make a living to support their families at a very young age.

In Zhao Manxiong's view, people with such family ties were more resilient and more loyal.

The Political Security Bureau would select suitable training targets from the children admitted to the Military and Political Training School every year. Wu Mu noticed that the files of these two teenagers both had comments of "silent, calm, intelligent, and agile" from Senator teachers. After interviews and a series of tests, they were formally admitted to the PSB training class.

The PSB training class two years ago was no longer the short-term training class of Ke Yun and Lu Cheng back then, but a serious two-year systematic study. Whether in cultural level or professional knowledge, there was a qualitative leap compared to the students graduated from the short-term training class back then. They were also newcomers Zhao Manxiong placed high hopes on.

"Lin Zhijian, you personally deliver this letter to Senator Qi Feng of the General Construction Company. Yes, he is the Chief Planner. Ask him to open and read it in front of you and then destroy it, then bring back his reply orally."

"Yes!" Lin Zhijian took the envelope, clicked his heels, and turned to leave.

"Zheng Yicheng, I have another job to entrust to you. Sit down first..."

When Lin Zhijian stepped into the gate of the General Construction Company, Qi Feng was sitting in his office drawing as usual, or rather, constructing the perfect city in his mind on paper.

This artistic idealist was actually not as simple as many people thought: he never banged the table and argued loudly about design concepts with General Construction Company Manager Mei Wan like Ji Runzhi did. Instead, he always silently completed the design tasks assigned to him—these designs basically didn't require him to use any brains or artistic imagination; just applying relevant standards was enough. Countless plans could be directly borrowed, or rather "simplified." And he invested most of his spare time in the "noble cause of art." The reason why it was only most of it was because he was also quite keen on managing his personal life and was a man full of zest for life.
