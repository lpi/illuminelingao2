# Chapter 2340 - The Hearing (IV)

His remarks were extremely mild, not only exonerating Xie Erren, but also letting off other responsible departments lightly along with him. However, Ma Jia understood clearly in his heart. These words seemed itching but not painful (superficial/harmless), but the underlying subtext was that the Liangguang Campaign exceeded the capability range of the Senate.

Since it exceeded the Senate's capability range, what to do next was ready to come out at a call.

*Young man has a future,* Ma Jia thought, *this plan Comrade Zhou plotted secretly for a long time in the past is finally revealing the dagger (intentions) this time.*
*
What would happen next? Ma Jia himself didn't know. But judging from the appearance of Liangguang stretched at every turn, proposals of further expanding the war, burning war to Jiangxi, Lianghu (Hunan/Hubei), landing and thrusting into Jiangnan, Shandong, and landing on Liaodong Peninsula etc. were basically ruined. Even if there were, the scale of projection would be limited.

Next would be nothing more than squatting locally (consolidating) or going south to open mines. Ma Jia knew about Zhou Wei going to Danzhou Industrial Park to lobby in the previous stage, and also knew what he said at the meeting.

But Ma Jia wasn't interested in his activities: whether going south or squatting in Liangguang, it had no practical meaning to the Law Society. What the Law Society was most interested in now was establishing a new judicial system in Liangguang—if successful, he and his Law Society would be counted as immortalized in history.

Next a few more Senators spoke. Xie Erren was already a dead tiger; criticism of him was basically just an opening remark passed over with one stroke. Firepower gradually concentrated on the Personnel Department and Political Security Bureau.

Why could Xie Erren obtain the appointment of Wuzhou Director? This was the most query—obviously, Xie Erren didn't have any local administrative experience before holding this post. Was there any certain "backstage deal" in his obtaining this appointment? Secondly naturally was the absence of the Political Security Bureau in Wuzhou.

Then someone proposed a motion, requiring these two departments to send representatives to provide relevant answers regarding the issues. If the answers couldn't obtain trust and pass at the hearing, then establishing a specialized investigation team to conduct "in-depth investigation" on these two departments would be proposed at the General Assembly.

The motion passed unanimously. Because both departments had specific work, usually the hearing would end here, continuing tomorrow. But Hai Lin expressed opposition, believing main responsible persons of these two departments were both in Lingao and should send representatives to attend the hearing immediately. This was "respect" for the Senate. His motion immediately obtained passage. Organization Section was one thing, usually presence not strong, but Political Security Bureau was always ranked first in many Senators' persecution delusions.

Ma Jia knew his mind, fearing meeting again every other day would lose the current atmosphere, and also give them prep time.

"Since the meeting has passed the proposal, we will send people to invite their representatives over." Ma Jia announced, "If everyone temporarily has nothing to speak, the meeting rests now."

The originally somewhat tense assembly hall instantly restored its original relaxed sense. Attending Senators gathered in groups of three or five, whispering to each other. Judging from many people's excited faces and almost unconcealable joy, many people were confident. There were a few people who remembered Ma Jia was the Director of Political Security Bureau, so their gazes moved towards his side from time to time, seeming to want to see some clues from his face. Ma Jia couldn't help laughing secretly, deliberately making a look of being worried and restless.

Unexpectedly this was discovered by Dong Shiye, asking: "Court President Ma, you look..."

"Nothing, nothing, just feeling funny." Ma Jia's expression didn't change, continuing a look of uneasiness.

"I don't find it funny at all." Dong Shiye's expression was very grave, "To be honest, I am still very approving of Pan Jiexin's formulation. The Senate should conduct a Rectification, not these baffling hearings—current hearings have turned into what..." He paused, "To be honest, I feel the Senate's current ethos is very bad. Any matter will become the utilizing object of a certain faction force. How to handle a certain matter or person, is not first considering the Senate's interest and consequences caused, but putting striking opponents or expanding own faction's proposition in the first place. Even vaguely there is a trend that one cannot accomplish things without attaching to a certain faction: wanting to accomplish things, must form cliques, expanding influence. Going on like this, aren't we no different from bureaucrats keen on party struggles in late Ming?"

"You are right." Ma Jia said, "Last time He Ming also talked about this privatley with me. Such phenomenon of watching other departments make fools of themselves, gloating and even using this as evidence is appearing more and more now. Even in the troops there are similar signs."

"My heavan, he wouldn't be talking about Hai..."

Ma Jia interrupted his words: "Who it is isn't important. Just that such an atmosphere has formed. Reversing it probably isn't [work of] one morning or evening." He sighed, "We have natural defects. To be honest, such a bizarre system operating smoothly till now, can only say it's because we used cheats (hacks) in this spacetime..."

In just an hour's effort, two representatives from Organization Section and Pol-Sec Bureau came. And both were specific persons in charge, one was Ming Lang, and one was Zhao Manxiong who rarely showed his face in public occasions.

The two performed the ceremony first, then entered the inquiry stage. Ming Lang was the first.

This Section Chief had performed duties for many years, basically still preserving appearance and habits of the civil servant era in the past. Dressed simply, expression rigorous. After sitting down in the listening seat, he took out a notebook and a fountain pen.

"I want to ask Section Chief Ming Lang, Xie Erren was appointed as Wuzhou Regional Director. Who made this appointment." Hai Lin raised the first question.

Ming Lang first recorded a few strokes in the notebook, then answered:

"The appointment was suggested by the Senate Organization Section according to Attachment 11 *Interim Regulations on Appointment and Removal of Senator Cadres*, reviewed and passed by the Senate Standing Committee, then formally filed and appointed by the State Council."

"Then what function does your department play in the whole process?"

"Organization work is relatively complex to speak of. Specifically can be divided into multiple items. Specifically to the cadre part: mainly responsible for macro-management of cadres served by Senators. Including planning, research, guidance etc. in aspects of management system, policies and regulations, personnel system etc., proposing suggestions on term change adjustment appointment and removal etc."

Hai Lin's face twitched once, saying impatiently: "Don't drop book bags (show off bookishness), please answer the question directly: In the matter of Xie Erren becoming Director, how did you handle affairs?"

A trace of imperceptible disdain appeared at the corner of Ming Lang's mouth. He smiled slightly, saying: "I will explain in simple terms. Any position served by Senator Cadres must go through these steps: 'Nomination or Registration' - 'Organization Section Filing and Inspection' - 'Senate Approval - State Council Appointment'.

"Among these, 'Nomination and Registration' is open. Whether the Senator himself, or various departments, can all propose candidates—can be others or oneself. As long as conforming to relevant nomination conditions."

"Who nominated this Xie Erren?"

"Himself."

"Not others? Perhaps likely a certain Senator signaled him to register?"

"I cannot judge this speculation. According to the content on the nomination form, Xie Erren registered himself."

"Even if he registered himself. Since you are responsible for filing and inspection, naturally you should screen out unsuitable candidates right? Why wasn't he screened out? Judging solely from Senator Xie's resume, he has fundamentally no local political experience, nor educational background in this aspect."

"You are completely correct." Ming Lang said, "In our preliminary inspection we also indeed believed he wasn't suitable for assuming local administrative position. But..."

"Did certain people give you instructions?"

"No." Ming Lang said, "At that time in the second recruitment of Liangguang administrative chief officials, we posted a total of fifteen local administrative cadre positions served by Senators. Actual registrants were only ten. Basically there was no choice."

"It is said Ma Qianzhu once said: give Xie Erren a chance. Was there such a thing?"

"Haven't heard him say such words." Ming Lang said, "Meetings regarding appointment of Liangguang Senator Cadres all have meeting minutes. Can be queried."

"We will query. Such an important location as Wuzhou, handing to such a person with zero administrative ability to hold, is it appropriate?" Hai Lin continued to press, "I believe with your professional attainment, you wouldn't make such a choice."

"Indeed inappropriate." Ming Lang said without hesitation.

"Then why recommend him up again?"

"Because among these ten places to go, the environments of the other nine were more complex. Mostly Han-Yao mixed habitation or counties with serious bandit scourges. In comparison, Wuzhou belongs to the rear of our battle line, and is a water and land wharf. Whether defense posture, social condition or local resources, relatively are all better. Letting him serve as Wuzhou Director was exactly considering his deficiency in this aspect." Ming Lang said, "If needed, we can provide the list of these ten places and the final appointment results."

"Hehe, what you say now is nothing more than shirking responsibility. No matter what, you pushed an incompetent person onto the post of Wuzhou Director, causing him to commit serious mistakes in the end. Cannot say you have zero responsibility for this."

"Responsibility is definitely there. If the Senate ultimately believes our department should bear main responsibility in this matter, then I have nothing to defend either." Ming Lang said calmly.

Hai Lin stared fiercely at Ming Lang for a good while, only then said: "I have no questions."

Next, several Senators raised inquiries again. But all circling on these few questions. Ming Lang answered one by one tirelessly.

Obviously, on Ming Lang's part, Hai Lin didn't get any handle on Ma Qianzhu. A disappointed expression appeared more or less on his face.
