# Chapter 2319 - Go South!

The group of Senators was bewildered by Zhou Wei's extravagant roadshow, expressing their willingness to "invest" in this plan one after another like investors. Seeing the great effect, Zhou Wei immediately took out sketches and explained his calculated investment-return situation one by one. He specifically mentioned the acquisition cost of grain in Vietnam and oil in Brunei—"almost low enough to be nothing."

"I won't say much about Vietnam's situation; everyone has seen many reports. It can be said there is much to be done. The water and heat conditions there are superior all year round, unlike here, where it's either flood or drought." Zhou Wei knew these people were not very interested in grain, so he glossed over Vietnam's superiority and went straight to the theme: "Brunei's oil."

Petroleum was hailed as the blood of industry. In fact, it was not only about providing power as fuel; its greater use was in chemical production. Whether petroleum or natural gas, both were important raw materials in the chemical industry, especially organic chemistry.

The Senate's petroleum industry was very weak. It wasn't that technology was insufficient or the Planning Commission was stingy, but that there was no ready-made industrial chain for oil supply to utilize in this spacetime.

As long as a resource had been utilized in this spacetime, such as iron, coal, sulfur, lime, tin, copper... there was more or less a certain industrial supply chain. Whether through trade or organizing mining themselves, it was relatively easy.

Petroleum didn't have this advantage. Although there were many records of sporadic mining and use, there was no commercial mining in the 17th century yet. From exploration, equipment, to worker training, the Senate had to do it all themselves, and the initial investment was very large.

So far, the petroleum resources the Senate could mine and use were limited to some shale oil and oil produced in Taiwan. The mining cost of the former was huge, and the output of the latter was also very small. The petrochemical industry, apart from some indigenous oil refining equipment, could be said to have almost nothing.

This had also been a lingering illness of the chemical industry sector for a long time.

"Brunei's oil, according to data from the old timeline, is mainly produced in the Belait District." Zhou Wei deliberately repeated it in English to reflect his "professionalism," although he didn't know how much error there was in reading this Malay word with English pronunciation.

"This area is very small, less than three square kilometers, located in the southernmost part of Brunei. Brunei's oil and natural gas exploitation are concentrated here."

The Senators present all knew the famous name of the Brunei Oilfield; some had even come into contact with Brunei crude oil in their work, but few understood how this oil was produced. Zhou Wei attracted their attention with a few sentences.

"Everyone may know that Brunei's most famous oilfield is called Seria Oilfield..."

Petroleum exploration near Brunei in the old timeline began in 1899. It started closer to the vicinity of Bandar Seri Begawan—roughly in the later Bandar Seri Begawan city. Later it gradually extended to the southwest of the country. Exploration in the Seria area was carried out by the British in 1926. The first commercial well produced oil in 1928, and formal commercial production began in 1929. Later, oil exploitation in the Seria area was monopolized by Royal Dutch Shell, lasting until the 21st century.

"I remember Brunei oil is offshore mining. If it's offshore oil extraction, then there's no hope." Someone asked.

"The main oil wells of the Seria Oilfield were onshore wells before the 1960s, and the main oil wells were all in areas along the coast. They are shallowly buried. Easy to mine—and doesn't require us to invest too much strength to go deep inland."

Zhou Wei summarized that the Brunei oilfield had the following advantages:

1. Shallow burial, early development. The earliest exploration began in 1899. Commercial oil production was in 1928. And reserves were relatively large; it could produce stably from the 1920s until D-Day.

2. The oilfield area is relatively small, and the coordinates are quite clear.

3. The crude oil produced by Seria Oilfield is high-quality light crude oil. Currently, it is relatively suitable for utilization levels—after all, the Senate's industrial capacity can only perform simple atmospheric distillation now. Catalytic reforming and such are basically lifetime-level goals.

4. The oilfield area is right on the coast. Convenient for shipping. In the old timeline, a light railway was built from the oilfield area to the port near Bandar Seri Begawan because of the sequence of construction. If hydrological conditions in the area near the oilfield are found suitable in this plane, building a new port directly on the shore might be considered. Before the new port is completed, small boats can be used for lightering.

His remarks were no small matter; the Senators of the chemical industry almost boiled over—such superior conditions were left unused for a long time. Let alone mining, even exploration hadn't been done. What exactly were these "Executive Committee," no, "Thieves of the Senate" doing?!

Whenever people felt unhappy, they naturally wanted to find a culprit. Unfortunately, since the Second General Assembly, the big target of the Executive Committee had disappeared, and Senators more or less participated in politics. To say who specifically was most hateful, no specific person could be recommended for a while. Specifically regarding Wu De of the Planning Commission and Zhan Wuya of the industrial sector, their favor and prestige in the industrial sector were very high. Whether from reason or face, it was unjustifiable to open fire on them.

In the end, Ma Qianzhu was unfortunately shot again and put on the hat of "Thief of the Senate." Although Ji Tuisi had also long coveted the Brunei Oilfield, the current emotions had a tendency to get out of control. Since "thoughts were unified," there was no need to blow things up, so he signaled everyone to stop at a suitable point. Moreover, if they blindly dug up old accounts, he would be suspected of being "Ma Qianzhu's Black General."

"We are holding a seminar here; the focus is on solving problems in chemical production. As for resources, it's good for everyone to discuss, but don't expand infinitely, and definitely don't engage in personal attacks." Ji Tuisi had led the chemical industry sector for a long time and maintained its operation under extremely difficult circumstances, possessing quite some popularity. "Since Comrade Zhou Wei made such a good suggestion, we should conduct discussions around petrochemical construction."

"If we can mine Brunei's oilfield, our petrochemical project in Danzhou now will have to be changed—at least there's no need to launch the oil shale plant." Someone suggested, "Isn't this low-level repetitive construction? Wouldn't it be better to use the saved resources directly for petrochemical projects?"

Everyone expressed agreement one after another. Oil shale was a resource that petrochemical enterprises would avoid if possible. Its mining cost was too high. In the old timeline, unless the oil price per barrel exceeded 60 US dollars, there was almost no profit to speak of—and this was the cost suppressed only after the US adopted new fracking technology. In this spacetime, the only way for the Senate to mine oil shale was to dig oil shale ore directly and then refine it. Apart from the huge transport cost, it severely polluted the air, produced a large amount of waste slag, and the yield was not high.

Seeing the heated atmosphere, Zhou Wei winked at the Two Zhangs. Zhang Xiao interjected: "No need to be so anxious. The oil shale in Danzhou and Maoming is real at least. It's just transported slower and quantity is smaller. This Brunei crude oil hasn't even started yet; who knows in which monkey year and horse month it will fall into our hands?"

"Speaking of which, it's still Ma Qianzhu playing tricks, choking us everywhere!" Someone said.

"I think it's not just Ma Qianzhu's problem alone. A bunch of people in the Senate are afraid of going south—I don't understand what exactly they are afraid of? As soon as overseas resource mining is mentioned, they immediately list a pile of unfavorable factors for you!"

"Afraid of what? Afraid of our industrial sector turning the sky over." Zhang Hao whispered behind people, "Otherwise how to reflect the importance of their administrative leadership?"

These words made the Senators explode again because they spoke to their hearts. Almost all industrial Senators had this fear inside. Administrative Senators had increasing power and gradually had the strength to govern the overall situation. Except for a few, although every industrial Senator was appointed as an official and had various titles, without exception, they were all technical cadres. No matter if you were a leader of an industry or a technical elite, when it came to specific projects, you had to depend on the whims of administrative bureaucrats.

Many people were very disgusted with this phenomenon in the old timeline. But in the new spacetime, as the Senate grew continuously, it began to appear again—bureaucratization seemed to be an inevitable consequence of organization. Industrial Senators almost all had experiences of "running to ministries," "finding people for approval," and "using connections."

"No! We can't be at other's mercy like this anymore!" Zhou Wei stepped forward at this time, waving his arms and saying excitedly, "We endure these hardships and difficulties in this spacetime, working 607 day and night. In the final analysis, isn't it for the Great Cause of the Senate? Now being ignored to such an extent that we can't even get raw materials for work, what exactly is this for?!"

Zhang Xiao also jumped out at the opportune moment: "We can't be tool people anymore! We must propose our stance to the Senate! Blind command by laymen commanding experts cannot continue!"

The dozen or so Senators at the seminar boiled over at once, as if someone suddenly spoke out the doubts in their hearts for many years. Some recalled the past events of the Maid XX back then and were instantly excited. It seemed the hot blood of the beginning returned to their bodies.

Just at this moment, Zhou Wei shouted the slogan: "Go South! Go South! The South is the future of the Senate!"

The Two Zhangs immediately followed with applause, leading to shout rhythmically with Zhou Wei: "Southbound! Southbound! Southbound!"

Under their agitation, the Senators at the seminar were infected, standing up to applaud one after another and shouting the southbound slogan.

Just as Zhou Wei was shouting excitedly, he saw Ji Tuisi also applauding there, but he didn't shout anything. Seeing Zhou Wei looking at him, a trace of a smile appeared at the corner of Ji Tuisi's mouth.
