# Chapter 2317 - Danzhou Development Seminar

Hundreds of kilometers away from Lingao, by the shores of Danzhou Bay, a storm was sweeping across the land.

Surging dark clouds shrouded the sky, and torrential rain mixed with lightning and thunder poured onto this land. The originally leveled land was washed away, and the fierce wind tore at the straw mats and tarpaulins barely covering the materials, blowing them into the air like kites.

The sea also surged under the gale, washing against the coastline—fortunately, Danzhou Bay was an inner sea, and the waves had weakened significantly by the time they reached the shore. But even so, the several H800 freighters docked at Yangpu Wharf were tossed about on the waves like toys.

Less than one kilometer from Yangpu Wharf, several container huts still stood erect in the storm. The branches and leaves originally covering them for sun protection had long been scattered to unknown places. Rainwater that couldn't be drained in time gathered at the bottom of the containers—the containers themselves were raised with stones, temporarily escaping the invasion of rainwater, but the equipment and goods in the yard couldn't avoid the disaster of flooding.

In the wind and rain, one could barely see a few black characters on a wooden sign hanging in front of one of the container huts: "Danzhou Industrial Park Construction General Headquarters."

That's right, this was the key project of the Second Five-Year Plan: the "Danzhou Industrial Park."

Danzhou Industrial Park wasn't a single factory, nor a few factories, but an entire chemical industry system. To describe it, it was a chemical industrial park. In other words, the crude chemical enterprises that the Senate had cobbled together since D-Day would undergo comprehensive integration and upgrading here. Not only would they start producing many chemical products they dared not even ask about in the past, but they would also achieve a leapfrog increase in the output of basic chemical categories that were originally pitifully small and could only rely on constant low-level repetitive construction.

In the long run, this place would also develop industries such as petroleum refining, pharmaceuticals, and related machinery manufacturing support. It could be called ambitious. Reading the description of Danzhou's industry drafted by the chemical industry department was ambitious enough to make one's heart surge with excitement and infinite yearning. But right now, the Danzhou Industrial Park consisted of only these few container huts.

The construction work of the industrial park began almost simultaneously with the Senate's launch of the mainland strategy. However, compared to the army's momentum of splitting bamboo on the mainland, the construction of the industrial park was struggling.

The reason was nothing more than insufficient resources. True, the Senate launched this project to solve the resource problem, but before a project could generate returns, it required more resource input.

The Second Five-Year Plan was quite grand. Although some obviously unrealistic projects were "paused" according to Senators' suggestions and actual conditions before the launch, the Planning Commission still faced a situation of too many monks and too little gruel: on one side was the rollout of the Second Five-Year Plan, and on the other was the huge expense of the Liangguang battlefield. A large amount of productivity was occupied for military production, and the occupation of transport capacity also slowed down the circulation of materials. This caused a substantial reduction in investment and materials put into industry and agriculture. Two months after the start of construction of the Danzhou Industrial Park, by the third month, a situation of work stoppage pending materials had already appeared because materials could not be put in place in time.

The Senators who were originally ambitious and prepared to do a big job in Danzhou could only gather in the container huts with nothing to do but curse. High-level leaders of the Government Administration Council, from Ma Qianzhu, Wu De, Xi Yazhou, to Cheng Dong... none were spared from the venom.

Seeing that the project was not going smoothly, Ji Tuisi thought that rather than letting these people gather together to curse, it would be better to do something else. So he convened a "seminar" for the main backbone personnel of the chemical industry in Danzhou.

Since it was a seminar, naturally it focused on "inspection," letting everyone relax their nerves—serving in the chemical industry sector was definitely a test. Senators not only faced danger at all times but also frequently faced death. The mortality rate of the chemical industry sector had long ranked first in the Senate's industrial system. Therefore, salaries and subsidies were also the top in the Senate, on par with the metallurgy sector.

Almost every chemical industry Senator had witnessed various ways of death of naturalized workers. They could well film a "A Thousand Ways to Die in the Chemical Industry," which made their nerves somewhat unbearable—moreover, oftentimes they faced sudden fatal accidents just like the naturalized workers. It was just that their vigilance was far higher than that of naturalized citizens, and they strictly followed rules and regulations in all aspects. So they luckily maintained a safety record of no Senator deaths or serious injuries for ten years.

This kind of mental pressure naturally needed timely relief. Coming to Danzhou for the seminar this time, Ji Tuisi entrusted the General Office and the newly appointed Director of Danzhou to prepare "programs" locally.

Unexpectedly, before the programs could start, the group encountered a storm just after walking around the civil engineering site of the Danzhou Industrial Park.

The Senate's weather forecasting ability was quite weak. After all, they had no satellites, no computers, and no weather radar, relying only on manual observation to infer the weather. Wanting accurate weather forecasts was tantamount to a fantasy.

The storm came quite suddenly, and they couldn't withdraw to Danzhou City for a while. So the group gathered in this construction headquarters, boringly chatting and killing time while waiting for the storm to stop.

At this moment, none of them paid attention to the wind and rain outside. Instead, they stared intently at the "Danzhou Industrial Park Project Planning Blueprint" hanging on the wall, which was densely marked with various factories and institutions, covering the entire Danzhou Bay surrounding area.

 However, currently under construction were only auxiliary facilities like the Yangpu Lighthouse, Yangpu Wharf, and the Industrial Park Transportation Center—roads and railways leading to other places on the blueprint would converge here. Right now, there weren't even worker dormitories; the thousands of construction workers building the Danzhou Industrial Park could only live in simple work sheds.

As for the production part, only the civil engineering of the oil shale refining plant was slowly underway; other factories were even less than a glimmer.

The blueprint was as fierce as a tiger, but looking back, it was just a sick cat. This was the current status of the Danzhou Industrial Park. Looking at the contrast between the two, the attendees felt increasingly unhappy.

"We've been transmigrated for almost ten years, and our basic industrial construction is still a pile of shit..." Zhang Xiao sighed, "Let alone our chemical industry—simply the shit among shit. Up to now, the production scale is at most laboratory level. For several most basic products, a single pilot test output by my senior brother is higher than the output of our largest workshop!"

"If it weren't a pile of shit, why would we come here? The chemical industry has been delayed!" Zhang Hao followed without showing weakness, "The main culprit, first is the Planning Commission, then the metallurgy sector. The former constantly suppresses and suppresses again, and the latter shirks and shirks again!"

As the head of the chemical industry, Ji Tuisi naturally couldn't let the "Two Zhangs" attack "friendly sectors" like this, let alone attack the omnipotent Planning Commission. He coughed and said: "The Planning Commission can't conjure up materials itself; it's just a distribution department. As for the metallurgy sector, if stainless steel can't be made, it can't be made—you can't make them produce nickel and chromium out of thin air."

"Last time working on silicon steel, huge resources were tossed in, and the result was a pile of scrap iron. Made the electric power sector happy for nothing."

"That technical route was wrong to begin with!"

"Then tell us your technical route?"

"My technical route is stuck at several key nodes. Those guys in mechanics can't make it, saying key materials are missing."

"Isn't that nonsense? This is a damn infinite dead loop!"

"If it could have been achieved back then, it would be good. If the electric power sector had a breakthrough, everyone would benefit. at least we would be much better off with non-ferrous metals than now, and some rare elements wouldn't choke us. Now not only has the electric power sector made a half-assed project, but we also have to add a power workshop when modifying the factory!"

"Multi-rivet steam steel, Ma Qianzhu's favorite."

"The factory using large and small water vats as distillation equipment for a long time fits Ma Qianzhu's aesthetic style very well, but it's killing us."

With everyone putting in a word in the container, there was a tendency to turn into a complaint conference. Ji Tuisi laughed: "Stop pulling this useless nonsense. Coming to this seminar was originally to discuss the coordination issues of the industrial park construction—we've been engaged in construction here for so many years; we can't use old sayings to shirk anymore. We have to bring out some new breakthroughs and new things. Zhan Wuya is coming the day after tomorrow too."

"Even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." The speaker was named Zhou Wei. He was a young man—to say he was young, he wasn't too young; in short, he was that kind of "young man" whose exact age wasn't easy to tell. But since he was a Ph.D., this person was probably around thirty.

Dr. Zhou came with his wife; they were one of the few Ph.D. couples in the Senate. His participation in the transmigration was also an accident: purely because his wife saw it on the internet and thought it was interesting, thinking it would be fun to come and play. Zhou Wei thought this was an organization scamming money and fooling people, but since his wife found it interesting, he might as well participate. Anyway, at most spending a few thousand yuan, treating it as a trip to Leizhou. If there was a chance to shoot a few videos and post them online as "Records of the Destruction of an Online Fraud Group," maybe he could become an internet celebrity UP host.

Unexpectedly, this "trip" turned into a "permanent tour" for the couple. Zhou Wei stomped his feet and beat his chest. He held a management position in a commercial bank in the old timeline, with a decent position, lots of money, and many new little girls... now everything was damn gone! Gone!

As for his wife, she also originally held a management position in the banking industry. Such superior conditions made many Senators think they participated in the transmigration truly for "ideals," and Dr. Zhou had to accept his persona by mistake.

Since he came, he might as well settle down. Fortunately, his major was still useful. He successively participated in the preparation work of the Planning Commission, Delong Bank, Cheka, and other financial and tax departments. Plus, Zhou Wei was a person who liked socializing and always had good popularity. Everyone thought he was aiming for the position of the future President of Delong or the Central Bank—however, he wasn't. His ambition had not a dime's relationship with finance.
