# Chapter 2122 - Breaching the City

By first light, the garrison inside the city had lost all heart.

In the first half of the night, women, children, and the elderly had been expelled, sparking riots throughout the city. Flames sprang up and died down repeatedly; under the desperate efforts of prepared militia, they never spread into a citywide conflagration. The thousand-odd Wolf Soldiers left inside to set fires and loot found resistance everywhere—from "friendly" troops and militia alike—and most of their raiding attempts failed. In the latter half of the night, the loudspeakers outside the walls began broadcasting, exposing the arson plot. This only stiffened the resolve of the civilians and militia remaining in the city; some rioters considered fleeing, while others, not yet resigned, planned to rally at dawn, mass together, and set fires upwind throughout the city.

With defenders and populace alike each harboring their own anxieties, morale utterly broken, the soldiers guarding the northern walls were in a state of dread. No one knew what to do next.

The day before, the militia had been ordered by "higher-ups" to dig open the blocked gates—supposedly to let civilians leave the city. But that night, no civilians had departed through these gates. Now the gates stood open, with no order to re-seal them.

The barbican and gate at Dayun Gate had already been destroyed in the bombardments of the preceding days. Without the gate blocked up, the entrance stood wide open. The defending commander ordered the gate re-blocked, but the militia, so eager when digging it open, now played deaf and dumb, ignoring orders entirely. When threatened with force, they looked ready to draw weapons and fight on the spot. In the end, the gap could only be blocked with knife-carts and makeshift barricades.

The Hair-Bandits opposite showed no signs of activity—no neighing horses, no shouting men. Probably they wouldn't attack just yet.

Fearing the Australian snipers, the walls were kept dark apart from a few lanterns—no torches, no fires. A deathly stillness prevailed.

At this moment, Zhu Quanxing's force, assigned the main assault on Wuzhou's northern wall outside Dayun Gate, had completed combat preparations. The companies slated for the attack had eaten emergency rations and formed columns in assault order. Ladders and ropes for scaling the walls, and explosives for breaching the gate, were all ready.

His 2nd Battalion's position was only about two hundred meters from the fortifications outside Dayun Gate. The Red Barbarian cannons on the walls had long since been silenced by artillery fire; even in daylight, soldiers in the trenches didn't need to worry about Ming artillery—rather, snipers kept the Ming defenders from even showing their heads.

Now the guns positioned at the forward line were silent; artillerymen watched the dark outline of the walls cautiously. They hadn't yet received the order to fire.

Under cover of the darkest hour before dawn, on Wuzhou's northeastern flank, the vanguard of the 2nd Battalion's light infantry company had crept to within only thirty meters of the Ming fortifications. The riflemen moved in groups of three, three groups to a squad, each group in triangular formation. Squads advanced in alternation—one moved forward while the other dropped prone to provide cover; once the lead squad halted and went prone, the trailing squad rose and advanced under cover of the lead.

The light infantry company's mission was to knock out the fortifications covering the gate outside Dayun Gate, ensuring the combat engineers could deliver their explosives in time.

The fortifications outside Dayun Gate had suffered severe damage in the preceding bombardments. Many trenches had been collapsed; the rampart walls had caved in at multiple points. Because of constant sniping by light infantry, the militia and soldiers sent out to repair them had taken heavy casualties. In the end, they had only hastily sealed the gaps with knife-carts and earth-filled baskets.

At this moment, a sentry on the rampart wall seemed to notice something. In the pitch darkness he could see nothing—they dared not light torches for fear of the Fubo Army snipers—he could only hear rustling sounds, growing louder and closer.

His hair stood on end. He spun around and shouted: "Enemy att—"

Even as he cried out, a red signal rocket suddenly rose from the Australian lines. The sky was beginning to lighten—dawn!

The attack had begun!

The officers and soldiers startled awake by the sentry peered out and saw dozens of Australians already crossing the collapsed trenches, some already scaling the rampart walls.

"Grab your weapons! They're on us!"

Amid a chorus of screams, the entire garrison was roused. Commanders shouted at the top of their lungs, leading their retainers to drive soldiers up the ramparts to fight.

At that moment, the artillerymen who had been waiting for this instant shoved friction primers into the touchholes, hooked on the lanyards, and with a twist of their bodies, the guns shuddered and spat forth red-hot shells, arcing toward Dayun Gate.

The first salvo landed inside the fortifications, shattering the officers and soldiers just scrambling to their feet—bones snapping, limbs flying. The camp dissolved into screams and chaos.

To avoid friendly fire, the covering barrage was limited to one volley. Originally, Zhang Dapao had planned to bombard targets on the Dayun Gate walls, but there was nothing left—the gate tower had been collapsed and burned, and in places even the battlements had been shot away. With nothing left to hit, they had to hold fire.

Under cover of the barrage, the lead platoon of light infantry surged into the fortification in an instant. The combat engineers attached to them wielded axes and grappling hooks, swiftly hacking apart or pulling down the knife-carts and baskets blocking the gaps, clearing several breaches. An artillery section dragged two 12-pound mountain howitzers across the gap via planks laid by the engineers.

Behind them, the remaining light infantry, covered by the vanguard, crossed the Ming trenches in under a minute and charged into the fortifications. Except for a few sentries, most of the Ming soldiers garrisoning the position had been asleep; caught off guard, many died to bullets or bayonets before they could even pick up a weapon. The commander defending Wuzhou's northern wall had also been awakened by the gunfire. Realizing the Australians were attacking, he steadied himself and began organizing a counterattack.

This commander was an old adversary of the Fubo Army: none other than Li Modao, the former Firearms Battalion garrison commander who had fought at Chengmai. After fleeing back, Li Modao hadn't been politically adept enough to advance; he had managed only, through connections, to become a firearms battalion company-grade officer under the Dongshan anti-Yao Regional Commander, scraping by. When the Dongshan Regional Commander's forces retreated to Wuzhou, he had suddenly found his "career taking off"—promoted, and placed in command of the newly formed "Wuzhou Firearms Battalion."

Yet this "Wuzhou Firearms Battalion" had been stationed, from the moment of its creation, in the most dangerous position: the fortifications outside the city gate. Over the past few days of heavy bombardment, half the fortifications had been destroyed, and between casualties and desertions, he had lost half his men.

Li Modao was no paragon of loyalty, but he at least knew whose rice he ate and for whom he should fight. He had no thought of fleeing, and he kept his men from joining the looting—not out of love for the people, but because letting soldiers loose to plunder would quickly cause the unit to disintegrate.

From the sparse gunfire, Li Modao knew the Australians who had infiltrated the position couldn't be many. But if he didn't drive them out immediately, once the Australian main force arrived, they'd be lambs to the slaughter.

So he immediately mustered his personal retainers and a group of able-bodied soldiers—a force of about a hundred men, armed with swords, spears, and rattan shields. Pushing several Frankish cannons already loaded with powder and shot, they charged out through the opened gap at Dayun Gate. Without hesitation, they fired several of the Frankish guns and then surged forward with a battle cry.

The Frankish cannon volley knocked down a few Fubo Army soldiers in front. But by now the artillery had already dragged two 12-pound mountain howitzers through the breach in the fortifications. Li Modao's hundred-odd counterattacking men ran straight into the muzzles. The howitzers spewed fire; canister shot swept the gateway. Amid smoke and screams, the counterattack collapsed instantly. Li Modao himself took a ball in the right arm, blood gushing; he passed out on the spot.

After the light infantry company seized the gate, the combat engineers found they had nothing left to do. The dirt blocking the gateway had been dug away; the gate itself had long since been destroyed by gunfire. All they could do was use their axes to clear away the knife-carts and barricades.

The light infantry used bayonets to disperse the defenders clustered in the sally ports and atop the walls. In some places, fierce hand-to-hand fighting broke out, but in most cases the garrison either scattered or dropped to their knees to surrender. The militia at the north gate had displayed a white flag from the start, every man with a white cloth strip tied around his left arm.

"Dayun Gate is taken!" The news reached Zhu Quanxing, and he immediately ordered: "All companies proceed according to plan—with maximum speed!"

At that moment, inside the Rice Guild hall, Luo Yangming—who hadn't slept all night—perched on the roof ridge, red-eyed, gazing toward the booming northern sector of the city. He didn't know from which direction the Fubo Army would attack, but the sound of guns from Dayun Gate told him the chiefs had begun their assault. It brought some relief: once the Fubo Army attacked, the officials and soldiers were nothing but clay chickens and pottery dogs!

But he also worried: would the rampaging soldiers inside the city go completely mad? Last night had been harrowing. Rioters had looted and set fires everywhere. Even the Rice Guild's compound had been attacked by a mob of soldiers; fortunately, local garrison troops were present, and the guild's masters had been willing to spend silver. After a vicious battle that left dozens of corpses and blood all over the ground, the masters and their families had narrowly avoided being trussed up as "fat pigs."

But not many places had armed protection. The local troops' strength was limited, enough only to guard key locations. Many neighborhoods had held off rioters with militia and street barricades and put out fires. But many other places had been ravaged—murder, rape, robbery... Some areas burned before help could arrive, consuming hundreds of households. From the rooftop of the Rice Guild, Luo Yangming watched the flickering flames across the city, heard the crying and cursing, and his heart ached like a knife—when would this man-made disaster ever end?
