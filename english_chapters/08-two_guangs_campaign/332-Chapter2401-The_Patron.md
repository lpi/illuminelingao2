# Chapter 2401: The Patron

*Even like this, he wants to see a Senator!* She too silently criticized, but since the scene had reached this point, she might as well play it out fully—the people in line were all watching eagerly.

She took Zhang Yu's name card and said, "Little brother, it's not that we won't give you an appointment, but appointments have prerequisites..."

At this point, her voice paused, and she cried out in her heart: *Lucky—luckily I came over to take a look!*

The reason a shift leader could be a shift leader was not only because of her longer service but also because her professional skills were more refined.

According to the General Office's relevant regulations, reception personnel maintained a reception list for every Senator. Who could be seen at any time, who needed permission to see, who could make an appointment, and who could only make an appointment under certain conditions—all had clear records.

And these records changed with the passage of time and changes in Senators' stationing locations.

As a shift leader cadre of the Great World Guesthouse Reception, she could memorize the relevant roster of every checked-in Senator in a short time. On Senator Hong Huangnan's roster, "Zhang's Food Company General Manager Zhang Yu" was listed in Category B. This meant that except during rest, meetings, or when Senator Hong ordered "do not disturb," Zhang Yu could see him at any time. Delivered letters or oral messages could also be sent directly to his private secretary, rather than being opened and handled by the reception desk. If Senator Hong couldn't see him temporarily, an appointment had to be arranged for him.

If she had really chased this child back, there would be big trouble today! As long as Zhang Yu mentioned it to Chief Hong, it would constitute a solid "Level 2 Administrative Accident." Zhang Yu was also the number one favorite in Guangzhou city for "supporting the Senate." If his visit to a Senator was unreasonably refused and the "Group of Ten" learned of it and reported upward, it wouldn't be a simple "administrative accident"!

*See how I deal with you later!*

She glared fiercely at the still-indignant clerk. Then she changed her expression to look pleasantly at the boy's face. Finding it unfamiliar, and having heard his quarrel with the clerk, she knew this should be a new servant at Zhang Yu's side. This would be easier to handle.

So she said pleasantly, "Little brother, don't be anxious. This sister is new and unfamiliar with the procedures. Let me check the appointment book for you..." Saying this, she ostensibly took out the roster and flipped through it. "Senator Hong has time the day after tomorrow. We'll register you here."

Hong Huangnan had no idea Zhang Yu had caused such a drama to see him. These days he'd been running around Guangdong, establishing military depots everywhere, organizing supplies, and occasionally selecting locations for his "Joint Logistics Farm"—busy beyond measure. Just settling down after returning to Guangzhou to look through delivered memorandums and meeting requests, he saw Zhang Yu's request.

*Don't tell me it's a funding problem again*, Hong Huangnan thought. Suddenly his mind stirred, remembering the recently clamorous Southward Advance Plan and various financial schemes.

Senator Hong was actually quite interested in the Southward Advance. As the main person in charge of Joint Logistics, the rich lands of Southeast Asia naturally made him covetous. However, he personally appeared unenthusiastic about it. The reason wasn't strange: once the Southward Advance began, it would inevitably involve complex logistical support work.

Although the Southward Advance case promoted Nanyang Company as a commercial entity, essentially it was no different from the Senate going down to the field itself, just utilizing more private capital. The required ships, rations, tools, farm implements, grain, building materials, population... still needed the cooperation of various departments under the Senate to supply. Joint Logistics, as a specialized support force, naturally couldn't escape this errand.

Since there was the disadvantage of not being able to escape, getting some benefits as compensation was only fair. So a few days after the Southward Advance Plan was announced, Joint Logistics had also quietly held a small meeting and made "work deployments" regarding the Southward Advance.

Zhang Yu running urgently to see him was nine times out of ten related to the Nanyang bonds Delong had recently started issuing.

As Zhang Yu's "Patron," Hong Huangnan was clearer than anyone about the Zhang family's financial situation. Though Zhang Yu hadn't sent financial reports for his review, he came almost once a month to verbally report operating status. Moreover, the policy loans from Delong were secured by Hong himself; for the sake of loan security, Delong also sent him all relevant financial reports of the Zhang family.

He knew Zhang's situation perfectly well: the money supply was extremely tight.

Under such tight conditions, it was already good management that Zhang Yu didn't come begging for new loans; how could he have any thought of buying bonds?

The interest on these Nanyang Company bonds was very low by this spacetime's standards, but as soon as news of the bond issuance spread, wealthy merchants and big households in Guangzhou city were all itching to move. Several local big households who usually dealt with Joint Logistics had also visited frequently to inquire about the inside details.

Hong Huangnan speculated that this bond—with scarcely a word written yet and interest far lower than local rates—was so hot before issuance probably because many wealthy households saw it as a "safety ticket." Buying bonds could bring them some illusory sense of security, and some thought to use this to cultivate connections with the Senate.

Of course, they were all mistaken. As Prefect Liu had said: This was purely a commercial act.

As for why Zhang Yu wanted to buy, it was probably the same as Gao Ju and these new nobles—harboring an intention to "set an example." After all, they'd reached their current positions thanks to the Senate. With such a major policy move, they couldn't have no reaction.

To state a position, but having no money. Needless to say, he'd come to borrow. In that case, Hong Huangnan wanted to see what this young man was planning.

"Schedule Zhang Yu's appointment for tomorrow evening," Hong Huangnan said to his private secretary.

---

"...That is how the matter stands; I would like to ask Chief Hong for guidance on how to proceed." Zhang Yu recounted the entire sequence of Gao Ju sending someone to pass a message to him.

After speaking, he looked at Chief Hong. Hong Huangnan, wearing a flowing poplin nightgown tied with a sash, leaned casually in an "Australian armchair," drinking tea served by an Australian maid. He didn't know what was brewed in the tea; it emitted a bitter fragrance. A look of lazy enjoyment.

"Still too much sugar," Senator Hong said to the maid.

"I'll go change the cup."

"No need."

Hong Huangnan picked up a small towel to wipe his mouth and nodded slightly—the situation was exactly as he'd thought. He asked:

"What is your thinking?"

"I originally thought that since these bonds are issued for the Senate's national policy, and I have received the Senate's grace, buying a portion to support the Senate is a duty I cannot shirk. It's just..."

"Pockets are empty, right?"

"Yes! With Master Gao there, even if I don't exceed him, I can't be too far behind either."

That made sense. Hong Huangnan nodded again. "Do you know how much he's preparing to buy?"

"I don't know, but he specifically sent a letter to ask—obviously wanting to use me as a benchmark. To avoid buying too much and overshadowing me, hurting my face; it's good intention..."

"You think quite thoroughly." Hong Huangnan laughed. Zhang Yu really knew these social niceties! "What's your estimate?"

"With his financial power and status, if he had no concerns about me, buying five thousand yuan should be no problem."

"You guessed low." Hong Huangnan shook his head. "With Gao Ju's wealth, buying fifty thousand is a matter of reaching out his hand. If he wanted to gamble his entire net worth and life, producing five hundred thousand probably wouldn't be a problem."

"Yes, I'm far behind him," Zhang Yu said somewhat ashamedly.

"Hehe, what's there to be ashamed of? He's already a middle-aged man who's struggled in Guangzhou all his life. In the past, he had eunuchs as backers, and later..." It was very inappropriate for Hong Huangnan to compare eunuchs with the Senate. "Later, he did business in Australian goods. Financial power, tactics, connections—which one can you compare with? But you're younger than him."

Zhang Yu understood in his heart that Senator Hong was not repulsed by his coming to ask for help. He secretly rejoiced and quickly said, "Yes! Besides being young, my luck is better than his! All relying on fortune and coincidence to meet a noble patron!"

Hong Huangnan smiled, thinking: *If we talk about luck, you're far worse than Gao Ju! Wen, Wang, and Xiao falling into his backyard—what kind of luck is that?* But he still enjoyed the flattery. He asked, "Setting aside his thoughts, how much do you plan to buy?"

Zhang Yu's courage also grew a bit. *Senator Hong knows my situation clearly; there's no need to hide.* He said:

"To speak from the heart, being able to pass the New Year hurdle safely is already the greatest luck; I dare not think of anything else! But Nanyang Company's fundraising must be supported somewhat. Not hiding anything from the Chief—I plan to buy one thousand yuan of bonds. But moving things around, borrowing the family's reserves from my father, I only scraped together a little over three hundred yuan."

"What do you plan to do about the missing money?"

Zhang Yu's face instantly turned red. "Beg... beg Chief Hong... to help..."

Hong Huangnan already had a plan in mind. He looked carefully at Zhang Yu and spoke: "Money, I will lend you. No need for seven or eight hundred; let's make it a round one thousand. Term of three years. Write me an IOU. Interest... let's count it as 1.2 *fen*!"

Zhang Yu was overjoyed. If Australians hadn't abandoned the practice of kowtowing, he would have knelt immediately to knock three loud heads for Hong Huangnan.

Let alone 1.2 *fen* interest—he would borrow it even at 3 or 4 *fen*.

Though it somewhat failed Gao Ju's good intentions, a quota of one thousand yuan counted as entering the threshold—barely a passable explanation. He couldn't care about dignity or face anymore.

"Many thanks to Chief Hong!" Zhang Yu bowed. "Chief Hong's grace to the Zhang family and Zhang's shop—this humble one will never forget until my teeth fall out!"

Hong Huangnan waved his hand. "Such words are meaningless." He added, "One thousand yuan is a lot, strictly speaking. It's enough for a hundred small households in Guangzhou city to eat and drink for a year. But this sum is still too little compared to your status."
