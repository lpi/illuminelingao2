# Chapter 2401: The Patron

Even like this, he wants to see a Senator! She also secretly criticized in her heart, but since the scene had reached this point, she might as well play it out fully—the people queuing were all watching eagerly.

She took Zhang Yu's name card and said, "Little brother, it's not that we won't give you an appointment, but appointments have prerequisites..."

At this point, her voice paused, and she cried out in her heart: *Lucky, luckily I came over to take a look!*

The reason a shift leader could be a shift leader was not only because of her long service but also because her business skills were more proficient.

According to the General Office's relevant regulations, reception personnel held a reception list for every Senator. Who could be seen at any time, who needed permission to see; who could make an appointment, and who could only make an appointment under certain conditions... all had clear records.

And records changed with the passage of time and changes in Senators' stationing locations.

As a shift leader cadre of the Great World Guesthouse Reception, she could memorize the relevant roster of every check-in Senator in a short time. On Senator Hong Huangnan's roster, "Zhang's Food Company General Manager Zhang Yu" was listed in the B Category. That meant, except during his rest, meetings, or when he ordered "do not disturb," Zhang Yu could see Senator Hong at any time. Delivered letters or oral messages could also be sent directly to his private secretary, rather than being opened and handled by the reception desk. If Senator Hong couldn't see him temporarily, an appointment had to be arranged for him.

If she really chased this child back, there would be big trouble today! As long as Zhang Yu mentioned it to Chief Hong, it would be a solid "Level 2 Administrative Accident." Zhang Yu was also the number one favorite in Guangzhou city for "supporting the Senate." If his visit to a Senator was unreasonably refused and known by the "Group of Ten" and reported up, it wouldn't be a simple "administrative accident"!

*See how I deal with you later!*

She glared fiercely at the still indignant clerk. Then she changed her expression to look at the boy's face. Finding it unfamiliar, plus having heard the content of his quarrel with the clerk, she knew this should be a new servant by Zhang Yu's side. This would be easier to handle.

So she said pleasantly: "Little brother, don't be anxious. This sister is new and unfamiliar with the business. Let me check the number book for you..." Saying this, she ostensibly took out the roster and flipped through it, saying: "Senator Hong has time the day after tomorrow. We will register you here."

Hong Huangnan had no idea Zhang Yu had caused such a drama to see him. These days he had been running around Guangdong, establishing military depots everywhere, organizing supplies, and occasionally selecting locations for his "Joint Logistics Farm," busy beyond measure. Just settling down after returning to Guangzhou to look through delivered memorandums and meeting requests, he saw Zhang Yu's request to see him.

"Don't tell me it's a lack of funds problem again," Hong Huangnan thought. Suddenly his heart moved, remembering the recently clamorous Southward Advance Plan and various financial schemes.

Senator Hong was actually quite interested in the Southward Advance. As the main person in charge of Joint Logistics, the rich lands of Southeast Asia naturally made him drool. However, he personally appeared unenthusiastic about it. The reason was not strange: once the Southward Advance began, it would inevitably involve complex logistical support work.

Although the Southward Advance Case promoted Nanyang Company as a commercial entity, essentially it was no different from the Senate going down to the field to work itself, just utilizing more private capital. The required ships, rations, tools, farm implements, grain, building materials, population... still needed the cooperation of various departments under the Senate to supply. Joint Logistics, as a specialized support force, naturally couldn't escape this errand.

Since there was the disadvantage of not being able to escape, getting some benefits as compensation was only normal. So a few days after the Southward Advance Plan was announced, Joint Logistics also secretly held a small meeting and made "work deployments" regarding the Southward Advance.

Zhang Yu running urgently to see him was nine out of ten related to the Nanyang bonds Delong had recently started issuing.

As Zhang Yu's "Patron," Hong Huangnan was clearer than anyone about the Zhang family's financial situation. Although Zhang Yu hadn't sent financial reports for Hong Huangnan to see, he came almost once a month to verbally report the operating status. Moreover, the policy loans from Delong were secured by him personally; for the sake of loan security, Delong would also send all relevant financial reports of the Zhang family to him.

He knew Zhang's situation perfectly well: the money supply was extremely tight.

Under such tight money supply, it was already good management that Zhang Yu didn't beg for new loans; how could he think of buying bonds?

The interest on these Nanyang Company bonds was very low by the standards of this space-time, but as soon as the news of the bond issuance spread, the wealthy merchants and big households in Guangzhou city were all itching to move. Several local big households who usually had dealings with Joint Logistics also frequently visited to inquire about the threshold inside.

Hong Huangnan speculated that this bond, with scarcely a stroke of a character written yet and interest far lower than local rates, was so hot before issuance probably because many rich households saw it as a "safety ticket." Buying bonds could bring them some illusory sense of security, and some thought to use this to cling to the Senate's connections.

Of course, they were all wrong. Just as our Prefect Liu said: This is purely a commercial act.

As for why Zhang Yu wanted to buy, it was probably the same as Gao Ju and these new nobles, harboring an intention to "set an example"—after all, they had relied on the Senate to get to where they were today. With such a major policy move, it wouldn't do for them to have no reaction.

To state a position, but having no money. Needless to say, he came to borrow money. In that case, he wanted to see what this young man planned.

"Schedule Zhang Yu's appointment for tomorrow evening," Hong Huangnan said to his private secretary.

"...That is how the matter stands; I would like to ask Chief Hong for a pointer or two on how to decide." Zhang Yu recounted the entire process of Gao Ju sending someone to pass a message to him.

After speaking, he looked at Chief Hong. Hong Huangnan, wearing a flowing poplin long nightgown tied with a sash, leaned casually on an "Australian armchair," drinking tea served by an Australian maid. He didn't know what was brewed in the tea; it emitted a bitter fragrance. A look of lazy enjoyment.

"Still too much sugar," Senator Hong said to the maid.

"I'll go change a cup."

"No need."

Hong Huangnan picked up a small towel to wipe his mouth, nodded slightly—it was the same as he thought. He asked:

"What is your thought?"

"I originally thought that since these bonds are issued for the Senate's national policy, and I have received the Senate's grace, buying a portion to support the Senate is a duty I cannot shirk. It's just..."

"Pockets are shy, right?"

"Yes! With Master Gao there, even if I don't exceed him, I can't be too little."

That makes sense. Hong Huangnan nodded again: "Do you know how much he prepares to buy?"

"I don't know, but he specifically sent a letter to ask, obviously wanting to use me as a comparison. To avoid buying too much and suppressing me, hurting my face; it is also good intention..."

"You think quite thoroughly." Hong Huangnan laughed. Zhang Yu really knew quite a lot about these twists and turns on the scene! "What is your estimate?"

"With his financial power and status, if he didn't have concerns about me, buying five thousand yuan should not be a problem."

"You guessed low." Hong Huangnan shook his head. "With Gao Ju's wealth, buying fifty thousand is a matter of easily reaching out his hand. If he wanted to gamble his entire net worth and life, taking out five hundred thousand would probably not be a problem."

"Yes, I am far behind him in dust," Zhang Yu said somewhat ashamedly.

"Hehe, what are you ashamed of? He is already a middle-aged man who has struggled in Guangzhou all his life. In the past, he had eunuchs as backers, and later..." It was very inappropriate for Hong Huangnan to compare eunuchs with the Senate. "Later, he did business in Australian goods. Financial power, tactics, connections—which one can you compare with? But you are younger than him."

Zhang Yu understood in his heart that Senator Hong was not repulsed by his coming to beg. He secretly rejoiced and quickly said: "Yes! Besides being young, my luck is also better than his! All relying on karma and coincidence to meet a noble person!"

Hong Huangnan smiled, thinking *if we talk about luck, you are far worse than Gao Ju! Wen, Wang, and Xiao falling into his backyard—what kind of luck is that?* But he still enjoyed this flattery. He asked: "Ignoring his thoughts, how much do you plan to buy?"

Zhang Yu's guts also grew a bit bigger, thinking *Senator Hong knows my background clearly; there's no need to hide.* He said:

"To speak from the heart, being able to pass the New Year's Eve hurdle safely is already the greatest luck; I dare not think of anything else! But Nanyang Company's venue must be supported somewhat. Not hiding from the Chief, I plan to buy one thousand yuan of bonds. But moving left and right, borrowing the family's old bottom from my dad, I only scraped together a little over three hundred yuan."

"What do you plan to do about the missing money?"

Zhang Yu's face instantly turned red: "Beg... beg Chief Hong... to help..."

Hong Huangnan already had an idea in his heart. He looked carefully at Zhang Yu and spoke: "Money, I will lend to you. No need for seven or eight hundred; let's make it a round integer of one thousand. Term of three years. Write me an IOU. Interest... let's count it as 1.2 fen!"

Zhang Yu was overjoyed. If not for the Australians not practicing kowtowing, he would have knelt immediately to knock three loud heads for Hong Huangnan.

Let alone 1.2 fen interest, he would borrow it even at 3 or 4 fen.

Although it was a bit sorry to Gao Ju's good intentions, a quota of one thousand yuan counted as entering the threshold, barely passable for an explanation. He couldn't care about dignity or face anymore.

"Many thanks to Chief Hong!" Zhang Yu bowed. "Chief Hong's grace to the Zhang family and Zhang's shop, this small one will never forget until my teeth fall out!"

Hong Huangnan waved his hand and said: "Saying this is meaningless." He added: "One thousand yuan is a lot strictly speaking. It's enough for a hundred small households in Guangzhou city to eat and drink for a year. But this sum is still too little compared to your status."
