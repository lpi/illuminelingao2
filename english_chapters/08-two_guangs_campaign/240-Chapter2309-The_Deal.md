# Chapter 2309 - The Deal

Cai Lan was originally under house arrest as well, but at daybreak, she was taken to the interrogation room. Zheng Ergen selected two burly "female wardens" specifically to "attend" to her. Cai Lan was after all from a humble but respectable family. When she failed her assassination attempt back then and first entered the cell, a bout of "authority-killing" minor plank beating had knocked her soul out of her body, making her feel like she had fallen into hell. Not to mention this proper torture interrogation; before long, she couldn't endure the torture and confessed everything she knew in detail.

At this moment, seeing Yi Haoran with disheveled hair, tattered clothes, and blood on his cheeks, yet still wearing a face of righteous awe, she felt both respect and shame. Breaking free from the female wardens supporting her on both sides, she curtsied deeply: "This servant sends her regards."

Yi Haoran turned sideways to avoid receiving the full bow and said, "Miss Cai, this student is about to depart. We part ways here."

Cai Lan was startled and murmured, "So soon?"

"A step fast, a step slow, what does it matter?" Yi Haoran said calmly. "It is only hateful that this time I could not take the head of Xie the Thief to avenge the officials, civilians, and scholars of the Great Ming who died wrongful deaths! However, this student has exerted his full strength. Heaven's mandate is such and cannot be violated. Farewell." With that, he bowed again, turned, and left freely.

Seeing him flick his sleeves and leave, Cai Lan admired him even more in her heart. Two sturdy women grabbed her wrists and pushed her forward again, locking her in the wing room of the Earth God Temple. She had been "treated well" here for some days back then. Now revisiting the old haunt and returning to the status of a prisoner, looking at the room and the furniture inside, she felt a peculiar taste in her heart.

She carefully sat on the bed board, but the two female wardens were un ceremonious, shouting sternly: "You slutty hoof, stand up for me!"

Cai Lan was startled. Daring not to disobey, she had to support her body to stand up. Before she stood firm, she took two solid slaps to the face.

"Kneel!" Before the voice fell, she was kicked in the back of the knee and forced to kneel on the ground.

"You adulteress! Still putting on airs for the Old Lady at this point? Watch how the Old Lady sorts you out!" the female warden laughed hideously.

Yi Haoran naturally wasn't taken to be beheaded—Xie Erren still wanted to save him for a public trial rally. He realized that the more he covered up this matter, the more people would see it as a lack of confidence. Instead, it would attract the siege of those "nitpicking demon kings" in the Senate. Only by remaining calm in chaos and handling this matter according to normal procedures could he show his position was stable and his confidence full.

The escorting soldiers took Yi Haoran to the gate tower of the Great South Gate. Looking down from the tower, hundreds of ships gathered on the river surface. Besides the grain ships towed by tugs, twelve gunboats of the Inland River Fleet cruised the river, spewing black smoke and white steam. Soldiers of the Volte Army and National Army stood with gleaming bayonets, a forest of swords and guns both atop and below the city walls.

Security was tight on the wall. The gate tower of the Great South Gate had been destroyed and not yet repaired; a tent was temporarily set up. Inside were a desk and chairs. Xie Erren sat upright in the center, supervising the grain unloading on site. Xie Erren's Senator Flag and the Morning Star Flag hung high—there was no trace of the wretched appearance from closely escaping capture during the raid last night.

Yi Haoran was escorted into the tent and came before Xie Erren.

Xie Erren finally saw the man who had nearly destroyed him. He had a strong curiosity about this person. He wanted to see what kind of ability he had to cause such a huge event in the city! Seeing his dignified appearance—a typical Great Ming scholar's look with "straight eyes and a proper nose," exactly the so-called "official physiognomy"—Xie Erren noted that although fettered in cangue and chains, the man walked with dignified bearing, looking like a steady and shrewd person at first glance. Only the age surprised him: his beard and hair were already graying.

He hadn't paid attention to Yi Haoran's age in the confession. Seeing him now, he felt quite amazed. Such a semi-old man actually contained such great energy and passion in his body. With neither gold nor silver, nor a foot of weapon, relying solely on his own strength, he had stirred up such a storm in Wuzhou and nearly ruined Xie Erren!

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but admire him. This Yi Haoran not only had backbone but also ability. He was a rare talent!

He signaled his attendants to withdraw and asked, "Are you Yi Haoran?"

"That is this student," Yi Haoran responded calmly. "Is your honored self the Fake Wuzhou Prefect of the True Kuns, Xie Erren?"

"I am Xie Erren." Xie Erren nodded. "Your guts are not small, and your ability is quite large too!"

"I am ashamed." Yi Haoran looked up at the sky and sighed. "I failed to take your head! To sacrifice to this great land and the countless wrongfully dead commoners!"

Xie Erren smiled and said, "Although you didn't succeed, you turned Wuzhou upside down. It wasn't entirely fruitless. It's just that this tossing and turning caused many innocent people to die in vain."

Yi Haoran sneered and didn't answer.

"Take Jiang Qiuchan, whom you saved back then. Later you used her, had her lurk beside me, and used her as a contact person—Mr. Yi, this move of yours was clever enough. Jiang Qiuchan still doesn't know how she became your accomplice. But it doesn't matter whether she knows or not..."

Yi Haoran's heart tightened. "What do you want to do?"

"Do what? Naturally, act according to the law." Xie Erren said leisurely, "Although she doesn't count as a principal offender, acting as a liaison in the middle makes her one of the key criminals in this case. According to the law, she should be hanged..."

As Xie Erren spoke, he glanced sideways at Yi Haoran—he learned from the confessions and the accounts of Zhao Fengtian and others that Yi Haoran was an upright and upright person. He could leverage this to threaten him.

"...What a pity. This Jiang Qiuchan really has a bitter fate. Her husband was killed by government soldiers, leaving a widow and orphan to live relying on a harsh brother and sister-in-law. She finally found a job to settle down and work happily, only to be used by you. Now not only is her life not guaranteed, but she leaves behind Qi Liheng—a young child becoming an orphan everyone can bully! By the way, he is also your student."

Yi Haoran felt guilt in his heart. Although he believed "great undertakings do not stick to small formalities," he felt guilty toward both Cai Lan and Jiang Qiuchan. If Cai Lan's involvement still had the rationality of "sacrificing herself to avenge her husband," Jiang Qiuchan was completely used by him. He knew very well that once the matter was exposed, Jiang Qiuchan could absolutely not escape the thieves' pursuit, and it might even implicate her family. As for Qi Liheng, his heart ached even more—this was a seed of reading (a scholar in the making), smart and sensible...

In the past, he didn't want to think about it, but now Xie Erren pointed it out to his face, leaving him speechless.

"...Speaking of Jiang Qiuchan, we also have to mention the whole Luo Yangming family. You probably think Luo Yangming deserves to die a thousand times for joining us. But what about his family? Old Manager Li, Ding Atao, Wen Yun... and Ah Chun. These people treated you like family—when you were arrested last night, Madam Ding even asked Luo Yangming to plead for you overnight. You did well; you dragged them all into the water cleanly."

This hit his heart even harder. During the days Yi Haoran lurked in the rice shop under a pseudonym, the Luo family treated him like kin, letting him experience the family warmth he had lost for many years. To say he had no feelings for them would be a lie.

"What will you do to them?" Yi Haoran asked.

"Luo Yangming's family, their crimes don't warrant death. Besides, he has the merit of running errands for us. It will likely be lenient treatment, exile to overseas barbarian lands—whether they survive depends on their fortune."

"What exactly do you want?" Yi Haoran was a smart man; he naturally knew Xie Erren wasn't saying these things merely to ridicule him.

"Mr. Yi is indeed a smart man." Xie Erren nodded. "You know, I am a Senator—what you call a True Kun."

"Correct."

"Since you exhausted your strength trying to capture or behead me, you naturally know the status of a Senator is incomparably noble."

Yi Haoran spat on the ground and said, "I suppose so!"

"So, as long as I am willing to spare them with a stroke of my pen, none of these things need happen. Jiang Qiuchan can live, her son won't become an orphan, and the Luo family won't be exiled..."

"Don't put on airs and play joyous tricks. Speak, what exactly do you want me to do?" Yi Haoran sneered. "Only if you want me to do disloyal and unfilial things, that is wishful thinking!"

"The matter is simple. That is to cooperate with us..."

Xie Erren knew that even if he killed Yi Haoran and Cai Lan, checking their confessions against each other would still reveal holes and handles. To further minimize his guilt, the best way was to make Yi Haoran change his confession, further alleviating Xie's responsibility.

Only changing the confession wasn't enough; Xie Erren planned to have him repeat this confession personally at the public trial rally. This would not only expand the scope but also form "ironclad evidence." Executing Yi Haoran after the rally would leave "dead men telling no tales."

Naturally, this couldn't hide it from the Senate; Senators had various channels to get the truth—but truth didn't equal evidence. Now these evidences were solid. As long as he adhered to the principle of procedural justice at the hearing, it was very likely he would pass.

Hearing Xie Erren's few sentences, Yi Haoran's heart became clear as a snow cave. This True Kun was eager to wash away his responsibility. He sneered secretly; it seemed this True Kun was also mediocre. When faced with real trouble, he wasn't much better than the corrupt officials of the Great Ming!

"It's not hard for me to cooperate; it's death anyway," Yi Haoran said. "But why should I trust your words? You are now the local emperor of Wuzhou, turning your hand into clouds and turning it over into rain. If you regret it afterward, can I turn into a ghost to settle accounts with you?"

"Mr. Yi, you are indeed a smart man." Xie Erren nodded with feigned admiration. "First, I swear on the honor of a Senator..."

Yi Haoran gave a cold laugh.

Xie Erren continued, "Second, I will handle the issues of Jiang Qiuchan and the whole Luo Yangming family first. I will leave you for the final public trial. You will see the results of the handling and know I haven't eaten my words. Since ancient times, one case is not judged twice. Can you trust this?"

Yi Haoran nodded and said, "This I can trust. But I have another person to ask about: What do you intend to do with Cai Lan?"
