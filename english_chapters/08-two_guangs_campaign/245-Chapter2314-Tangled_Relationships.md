# Chapter 2314 - Tangled Relationships

Capital relocation and industrial transfer had been topics of debate in the Senate ever since the recovery of Guangzhou. From a development perspective, basing on the mainland was the established national policy of the Senate; Hainan was just a springboard. Leaving Hainan was the first true step for the Senate to embark on its journey.

However, unlike the Senators whose minds were full of grand plans, many Senators didn't want to leave Lingao. Ten years after landing, Lingao had become a de facto hometown. It had everything they were familiar with. It was their "comfort nest." Moreover, moving meant moving most of the medical power of the Lingao General Hospital. Obviously, everyone trusted the Senator doctors and nurses more than the "high disciples" they trained.

After some gaming and discussion, a compromise plan was barely reached in the end. Administrative departments would move to Guangzhou, while core industrial departments currently in Lingao would not move—besides the industrial Senators not wanting to move, the already installed industrial equipment was not suitable for frequent dismantling and moving.

Educational institutions and research departments set up in Lingao would not move either—after all, Lingao was much safer than Guangzhou. Only the health system concerned the vital interests of Senators, so a split decision was finally made: some people and equipment would move to Guangzhou, and some would stay in Lingao under the leadership of Shi Niaoren to continue serving the Senators.

Originally, a consensus had barely been reached on this matter, but moving the capital to Guangzhou and industrial transfer would inevitably occupy significant resources. This would inevitably affect the resources allocated to the Southbound Faction. Therefore, to compete for resources, the Southbound Faction recently began to constantly attack the Liangguang policy, believing that the strategy and governance of Liangguang were completely "wasteful," gaining only large amounts of low-yield farmland and a massive illiterate population, bringing only "burdens" rather than benefits to the Senate.

This argument was once rampant in the Senate. Especially since the supply of non-ferrous metals and oil had not been effectively solved for a long time, many industrial Senators threw themselves into the embrace of the Southbound Faction one after another. After all, compared to Liangguang which could only solve coal and iron resources, the temptation of various non-ferrous metals and oil in Southeast Asia was greater.

The shift in the wind direction of the industrial sector greatly boosted the momentum of the Southbound Faction. Even Zhan Wuya was moved. At the Government Administration Council meeting, he raised the question of whether to carry out limited resource extraction work in Southeast Asia—especially for the oil supply issue that had long plagued the chemical industry.

Zhan Wuya's unintentional suggestion immediately caused a chain reaction. For a time, remarks like "Liangguang is insufficient to rely on" and "Going South is the lifeline of the Empire" became popular in the Senate, with such great influence that there was momentum to change the Senate's strategic layout. For a time, extensive debates began within the Senate on how to allocate resources, where to tilt the focus, and actions after the end of the Liangguang war situation. Both sides engaged in constant verbal battles from the Senator BBS to the Senate conference room over where to invest resources, with memorandums flying everywhere.

Of course, up to now, the Southbound Faction had not achieved a decisive victory, and all parties were in a stalemate.

"The Southbound Faction bunch thinks resources will be in hand just by going to Nanyang for development. How can it be that simple?" Minister Hong lit a "Sonia Lily Sharpel Cigar." "I just hehe. Can mining resources on tropical islands in Southeast Asia be done without a construction cycle of five to eight years? Empty big cakes are eaten with great relish one by one!"

Liu Xiang coughed. He personally didn't quite approve of rash expansion under conditions of insufficient cadres and finances, especially expansion on the mainland. So he was somewhat inclined towards the Southbound Faction's idea of getting resources first. But seeing the Southbound Faction seemingly intending to abolish Liangguang construction, this was far from his interests. However, Old Hong's words were too heart-condemning; he had to come out to defend a bit.

"Don't worry if it's an empty big cake. Isn't marching north to Shandong, Tianjin, and Jiangnan also an empty big cake? The industrial sector won't get any benefits either. In the final analysis, going in any direction has pros and cons. It would be best if we could bloom on all sides, but us? Unceremoniously speaking, we are poor-ass imperialists—comparable to the Little Japanese. If we get serious, we aren't even as good as the Little Japanese..."

Wen Desi waved his hand: "Going south or north are both strategic decisions of the Senate. As long as it is passed by the General Assembly, we as Senators should resolutely execute it. So there is no need to discuss the specific strategic direction. The key is to minimize the negative impact of the Wuzhou Incident on the Senate."

Liu Xiang lowered his head in deep thought for a moment and said: "My suggestion is to end the campaign in Liangguang as soon as possible. After completing the occupation of the regular official rule areas controlled by the Ming government, stop large-scale military operations of the Volte Army, continue to reorganize and expand the National Army, and ensure security and tax collection in the occupied areas first. As for the next step of deep governance, it can be postponed—after all, our administrative cadres are really too few. Without a cadre allocation of more than seven per thousand of the population, it is impossible to achieve it in one step..."

Everyone present expressed agreement.

"...As for the capital and industrial relocation, it concerns the century-long plan and should continue to be pushed forward. In addition, besides Guangzhou, choose a few prefectures and counties in the Pearl River Delta and locations where our power can be effectively projected as templates for deep governance. Concentrate strength on model governance. Cadre staffing can be over-allocated, serving as training bases for administrative cadres."

"Run more schools in Guangzhou—we can't rely solely on Fangcaodi for training; we can't wait that long. I suggest establishing schools in Guangzhou roughly equivalent to the Fangcaodi level. Absorb local students and students from the whole province of Liangguang on the spot as reserves for building Liangguang. The Guangzhou civil service exam should be held every year, and the scope of candidates can also be expanded to Liangguang—to facilitate candidates from Guangxi, exam sites can be set up in Wuzhou, Guilin, or Nanning. Admitted civil servants can be sent to the Guangzhou Cadre Academy for unified training."

After talking about his "administrative philosophy," Liu Xiang finally said: "As for Xie Erren's problem, I suggest not delving too deeply. Just handle it according to his reported stance."

"I agree, although very reluctantly." Bei Wei said hatefully, "He is so disorganized and undisciplined, only seeking personal likes and dislikes and enjoyment. Not to mention harming the people, the damage to our cause is simply irreparable..."

"Especially our status in the hearts of naturalized citizens; this time it will be discounted again." Wen Desi sighed quite helplessly. "He was actually rescued by naturalized citizens. This Luo Yangming simply deserves to die a thousand deaths..."

"Alright, President Wen, don't engage in that god-making stuff." Hong Huangnan said, "You know better than me what kind of birds the various monsters and freaks in the Senate are. Naturalized citizens' worship of Senators will collapse sooner or later. Without Luo Yangming this time, if Xie Erren were really caught and presented to Chongzhen, our fun would be big..."

"What's difficult about this," Wen Desi sniffed and smiled, "Nothing more than Chongzhen using him to threaten us, or chopping off his head after presenting the captive at the Meridian Gate to make us lose face. We just directly announce that Xie Erren is not a Senator."

Liu Xiang couldn't help saying: "President Wen, isn't that too toxic..."

"If I had the power, I would announce right now that Xie Erren is not a Senator." Wen Desi waved his hand dashingly.

"Alright, no need to speak angrily." Bei Wei interrupted their gags. "What do you think of Mayor Liu's suggestion?"

"My opinion is the opposite of yours." Wen Desi said.

The other three were shocked. Liu Xiang asked busily: "Why?"

"Didn't you read this *Wuzhou Highlights*? If I guessed correctly, it should be from his own hand. Honestly, I understand dumping the pot—it's human nature. But this dump landed on the resource allocation issue. Look at these objective factors he raised; they are all caused by insufficient resources..."

"Exactly because insufficient resources caused such a situation, we need to increase investment further..."

"No, no. In the mouths of the Southbound Faction, this becomes 'Knowing resources were insufficient but still forcefully pushing the Liangguang strategy, placing Senators in extreme danger, almost causing irreparable results.' What do you think of this charge?"

Liu Xiang sucked in a breath of cold air: "I overlooked it!"

He only thought about the currently most jubilant Southbound Faction, forgetting there was still the "Senator Supremacy Faction" in the Senate, which was always vigilant that "Senator Power is Sacred and Inviolable." If they followed Xie Erren's stance, Shan Liang and others could seize this handle to make trouble—this was different from allocating maids back then; it threatened the personal safety of Senators. Once incited, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"In that case, we can only be sorry to Elder Xie." Director Hong said slowly.

"We aren't in a hurry about this matter. I'm afraid many Senators who have material in hand are waiting for an opportunity to move. Let's see how they plan to move first." Wen Desi said, "Our primary task now is to clean up the mess in Wuzhou."

"Who to send to replace him now?"

"Send no one for now," Wen Desi said. "First, no Senator is more familiar with the situation in Wuzhou than him. Sending someone would take at least a month to get started. The current Wuzhou situation isn't suitable for changing generals mid-battle; second, although the Guangdong Region has the power to select and appoint administrative chiefs of cities and counties, he was appointed by the Organization Department. Dismissing him like this has no procedural problem, but it's inappropriate—disrespectful to the Senate."

"Should we send someone to assist him?" Liu Xiang asked, "Replace him after the results come out."

"This is okay," Wen Desi nodded, "But no rush. The most urgent thing now is to project more military power to Wuzhou. Bei Wei, can you mobilize new troops from your side?"

"There are new troops. We have Ming army surrendered soldiers being retrained in Hong Kong. Several new squadrons have finished retraining. They are much stronger than those temporarily cobbled together to fill pits before. However, they were originally intended for Northern Guangdong."

"Northern Guangdong doesn't matter; Huang Chao and the others can hold the overall situation. Send two squadrons to Wuzhou first—depart immediately!"
