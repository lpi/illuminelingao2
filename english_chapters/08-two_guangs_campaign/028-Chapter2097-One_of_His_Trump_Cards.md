# Chapter 2097 - One of His Trump Cards

"...If that last stratagem fails, the shortage of grain in the city will quickly lead to our army's supplies running out, eventually forcing us to withdraw. In my view, this scheme to export grain was likely something that traitor told Xiong Wencan—that we rely heavily on logistics—and then some cunning adviser on Xiong's staff devised this plan."

Zhu Mingxia nodded his acknowledgment to Xu Ke, who concluded his remarks and lowered his head to drink several more sips of tea. Next came the second item on the agenda: discussing counter-strategies for the upcoming campaign based on the intelligence analysis.

The second agenda item naturally required Zhu Mingxia to take center stage. As the de facto commander of the Wuzhou Campaign, he had full discretionary authority over how to fight, when to fight, and how far to push.

At this moment, he felt somewhat uneasy. Though he was effectively a dictator whose word was law, he still had to accommodate the democratic sentiments of the Elders present. Of course, no one would oppose any decision he made, but the formalities of democracy still had to be observed.

The battle plan had already been set. Ever since the reconnaissance report had landed on his desk a few hours earlier, he had confirmed that the original operational plan would remain unchanged. Even with these new pieces of intelligence suddenly emerging, they would have no impact on his strategy. How they should fight was how they would fight—no general would alter his battle plan based on a few pieces of intelligence alone. It was the commander's judgment that decided victory or defeat on the battlefield, and intelligence was merely one factor informing that judgment.

Another moment of silence passed. Clearly, everyone was waiting for Zhu Mingxia, the military chief, to speak first.

Zhu Mingxia was naturally aware of this, but he had no intention of laying out his battle plan straight away. Instead, he instructed Zhang Dapao, "Xiao Zhang, go fetch the map."

Zhang Dapao was roughly the same age as Ruan Xiaowu, but his seniority was far less. Having him attend this meeting was pushing his limits a bit, but in order to maintain a one-to-one ratio of Army to Navy personnel, he had eventually been called in.

A large-scale military map of Wuzhou and its surroundings was spread across the table. Zhu Mingxia took a sip of tea to rinse his mouth, and then began gesturing with his hands as he spoke: "To ascertain the Ming army's defensive deployments, I dispatched a reconnaissance team the night before last to scout the perimeter of Wuzhou. These lads only returned to their units a few hours ago—several were wounded. I'll now brief you all on their findings."

"First, regarding the southern part of the city: the Dezheng, Nanxun, and Yangming gates are all sealed shut, and the bridges over the moat have been dismantled. No Ming troops have been spotted in the shantytown south of the city—not even local braves or naval militia. To the east, a small number of Ming soldiers are stationed on Beishan Hill, with very few firearms—mostly cold weapons. To the north, extensive fortifications have been constructed around the Dayun Gate, consisting mainly of three interlocking rings of trenches connected by artillery emplacements equipped with small cannon such as breech-loading *Falangjis*. The number of Ming troops stationed there is unknown, but visual estimates suggest around five to six hundred men, armed primarily with ranged weapons like bows and matchlocks. To the west, Ming patrols are active, and the Xijiang Gate is the only gate that remains open. According to observations, grain shipments are being unloaded at the Xijiang Gate from boats coming downriver from the Gui River."

"Didn't Lone Wolf say that most of the grain in the city had been moved out?" Xu Ke raised a question.

"That's not a contradiction. The reconnaissance report shows the grain boats are few in number—barely enough to maintain the city garrison's supplies. It's clear the Ming army has no intention of a prolonged defense. Xiong Wencan's ultimate goal is likely to give us a bloody nose and then abandon Wuzhou. From there, it would unfold as the intelligence suggests: burning Wuzhou to the ground, or conversely, trapping us inside to starve."

"Trapping us inside Wuzhou? Would that even work?" Meng De countered.

Zhu Mingxia smiled and said, "I think Xiong Wencan's ultimate aim is still to negotiate a settlement, but he knows he doesn't have the capability or confidence for that right now. His defeat is certain—but if he can avoid losing too badly, he'll gain the confidence he needs."

"Then let's dampen his confidence first. Since grain boats are entering the city, there must be a granary somewhere upstream. I suggest we divert a portion of our forces to search upstream and eliminate this granary depot," Zhu Quanxing proposed.

"That's unnecessary. Setting aside whether this granary even exists—what if those grain supplies are coming directly from Guilin? Are we really going to split off a column and march all the way to Guilin? Besides, this might well be a smokescreen laid by the Ming to lure us into dividing our forces and weakening our siege capacity. Who knows whether an ambush is waiting upstream on the Gui River—perhaps Xiong Wencan's personal elite guard. The Ming's mobilization capacity shouldn't be overestimated, but it shouldn't be underestimated either."

At this point, Yang Zeng, commander of the 8th Battalion who had remained silent until now, spoke up. He pointed at a small hill across the Gui River from Wuzhou and said, "Then let's seize that hilltop, establish an artillery position, and cut off Wuzhou's food supply directly."

"That hill is called Bangshan. The scouts report that Ming troops are already stationed there, and they've dug trenches on the summit. The exact number is unknown, but their firepower is fierce—and notably, quite a few are using Nanyang-pattern rifles that we manufacture. That's where our reconnaissance team was spotted, and they took casualties. Fortunately, the Nanyang-pattern rifle has limited range and power, or we might have left several men behind."

"Nanyang-pattern rifles!" Everyone was surprised.

"There's nothing strange about it. The Nanyang rifle was always an export product, and although it was only supposed to be sold to select clients, there's no guaranteeing those clients wouldn't resell the weapons. Some ending up in the hands of the Wuzhou garrison isn't particularly unusual. Xiong Wencan amassed quite a fortune during his tenure as Fujian Grand Coordinator, and he's been Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi for several years now. Buying a few dozen Nanyang rifles, along with enough percussion caps and ammunition for one campaign, to equip his household guard against us is perfectly normal. And don't forget—he also has a traitor advising him."

"Damn that Xiong—so this enemy's going to be a real hard nut to crack!" Schneider exclaimed.

"A few dozen Nanyang rifles won't make a difference. But this does show that Governor Xiong has thrown in his full stake," Zhu Quanxing remarked. "This is one of his trump cards. He's bound to have others, and we must be on our guard."

"Even the strongest enemy will fall before the might of the Fubo Army! My decision is as follows: the full assault begins tomorrow afternoon! Yang Zeng, you take the 8th Battalion and capture Bangshan. The enemy has approximately a thousand men there, and they certainly understand the strategic importance of the Gui River waterway—they won't give it up easily. Bangshan won't be easy to crack; think of something clever, and don't throw men at it recklessly. Also, they've built a pontoon bridge at the foot of Chashangang. If possible, don't let a single enemy retreat across it." Zhu Mingxia began outlining his battle plan.

"Yes, sir!" Yang Zeng rose and saluted, accepting his orders.

"Xiao Zhang, you take the siege artillery company and land south of the city. Clear the fields of fire and establish your artillery positions."

"Yes, sir!"

"Lao Zhu, your battalion will leave three companies south of the city. The rest will swing around to the east, and another detachment will move north. Set up positions outside enemy artillery range and maintain a standoff with the Ming forces—standoff only, no engagement."

"Am I to serve as a diversionary force to draw enemy attention? The southern wall is obviously lightly defended—are we making it the main axis of attack?" Zhu Quanxing asked.

"No. The northern wall is the main axis. The weak defense in the south is clearly meant to lure us in—a trap the Ming want us to fall for. Our intelligence confirms this. The enemy obviously wants us to take the bait, assault the south, and then get burned after breaching the walls. The Ming won't stay in the city to roast alongside us. We must first seal off their escape routes, then compress them inside Wuzhou so that any fire they set will only burn themselves."

"Understood."

"I'll order one field artillery company deployed to both the eastern and northern sectors to support you. However, big guns are still big guns—getting the artillerymen and their pieces up those hills isn't easy. I estimate they'll arrive at least a day after your units are in position."

"Then what does the Navy do?" Meng De asked.

"Pound the southern wall of Wuzhou with everything you've got, making them think we really are attacking from the south! The siege artillery company will coordinate with you."

Schneider and Ruan Xiaowu said nothing, but they had no objections to this plan. At present, apart from supporting the 2nd Combined Brigade's siege, the Pearl River Task Force West Detachment had nothing else to do.

And so, Zhu Mingxia adjourned the meeting, instructing the naturalized officers to rest for a few hours while the Elders remained behind—there were other matters to discuss.

The battle plan had been finalized: trap the Ming forces inside Wuzhou and let them burn themselves. But if that fire really did break out, what to do about the civilians of Wuzhou was not something Zhu Mingxia could decide on his own.

Although no concept of "humanitarian disaster" existed in this timeline, Wuzhou was still a major city of several tens of thousands. Once the city was destroyed and the citizens stripped of their livelihoods, the burden of their welfare would fall entirely on the Council of Elders.

In theory, by destroying the Ming's outer defenses and besieging them within Wuzhou, they could simply starve the Ming garrison into submission without a single torch lit—thereby sparing the citizens from death by fire. But a prolonged siege meant the time needed to capture Wuzhou would depend on how quickly the defenders surrendered. By then, most of the city's population would likely have starved to death anyway.

Zhu Mingxia could not allow the Wuzhou Campaign to drag on. A protracted siege was not among his options. The Fubo Army's supply system had always carried an element of living off the land, and their logistics problems had never been fully solved. Stockpiled materiel in the rear was finite; if the siege dragged on too long, the Ming forces might not run out of food before the Combined Brigade did. Every Elder-officer in attendance was intimately familiar with this reality. Xiong Wencan's willingness to defend the city was likely prompted by the traitor's tip-off, exploiting this very weakness in the Fubo Army's logistics.
