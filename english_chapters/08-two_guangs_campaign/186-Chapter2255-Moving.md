# Chapter 2255: Moving

"Was the road difficult?" Feng Haijiao waited until the servants cleared away the leftover food and served tea before asking.

Bi Xuansheng had only cared about eating and drinking just now; only now did he recover his wits, gasping, "It was dangerous! I almost lost my life!"

"Was it that dangerous?!" Seeing his appearance, Feng Haijiao knew the journey had not been peaceful. "Don't be anxious, tell me slowly."

Bi Xuansheng ate and drank his fill, gained some spirit, and then recounted his liaison trip in detail.

When he left Qinglian Market, he was still dressed as a scholar, bringing a dozen attendants, without concealing his identity. However, after traveling less than half a day, he encountered a "Joint Patrol Team." At first, Bi Xuansheng didn't mind, thinking it was village braves under some local strongman on the road. With Bi Xuansheng’s status, he naturally didn't need to be afraid; a greeting would suffice. Only when he got close did he realize that although the other party was local troops, there was a small squad of Australian soldiers mixed in.

At that time, the two sides were only a hundred *zhang* apart. The subordinates Bi Xuansheng brought were still wearing Feng Haijiao’s uniform. The village braves on the other side rushed up with a clamor to arrest them. Bi Xuansheng, riding a horse, took the lead and ran, managing to avoid being "captured alive." However, most of his subordinates were captured, and only a few escaped.

"Whose troops were they? To be so bold?" Feng Haijiao was startled. Although the situation had taken a sharp turn for the worse these days, in the surrounding area, the various strongmen had not yet openly torn their faces with him. Now someone actually directly attacked his men!

"I didn't see clearly whose troops they were, but they must be from those few large gentry households around here." Bi Xuansheng shook his head with a bitter smile. "Now, patrolling the county are not only the National Army, but the village braves of various large households have also come out. Notices are posted everywhere..."

"Notices? What notices?" Feng Haijiao asked urgently.

"Here." Bi Xuansheng pulled a ball of crumpled paper from his bosom. "I asked a subordinate to tear it down from the market."

Feng Haijiao opened it and saw it was a proclamation issued by the female magistrate. It could be considered a reward notice, because it explicitly offered rewards for him and the main bandit leaders under him, including Bi Xuansheng, Zhan Zhekun, Xin Laonan, and others; not a single one was left out, all listed on it. Densely packed, there were fully thirty or forty names.

Looking at the reward amounts, however, crooked Feng Haijiao’s nose with anger: for him, one of the Three Tyrants of Yangshan, this Li barbarian female magistrate actually offered a reward of only three taels and five mace of silver—not only that, he was ranked second, behind Zhan Zhekun: whose reward was four taels of silver. The ones following were nothing more than one tael, two taels, with the lowest being only five mace. Bi Xuansheng was also offered a reward of three taels of silver.

"Master, don't look at the reward amounts; look at the main text." Seeing him gnashing his teeth while staring at the wanted list, Bi Xuansheng hurriedly reminded him.

Feng Haijiao hurriedly looked at the main text. It turned out that "Reward for capture, dead or alive" was only the first article of this proclamation. There were several articles following, all targeting the local large households, requiring them to "rectify the *Baojia* system and patrol day and night," strictly prohibiting "colluding with bandits." Not only were the large households strictly forbidden from associating with bandits themselves, but if their clan members, relatives, tenant farmers, servants... if any wanted to do so, once there was evidence of associating with bandits, the whole family would be prosecuted for colluding with bandits: heavy punishment would be beheading, confiscation of property, and exile to "malicious armies in distant prefectures," while light punishment would be fines and forced labor.

The second article was addressed to the bandit gangs themselves, proclaiming to the ordinary minions in the gangs that those willing to forsake darkness and turn to the light would be pardoned for past misdeeds. If they could bring information on the whereabouts of bandit leaders or their heads, there would be additional rewards.

Feng Haijiao read on, becoming more alarmed as he read. He didn't care about the reward on his head, but the following articles clearly intended to force the local large households to "cut the mat and break relations" with him. This was digging up his roots.

Since ancient times, the relationship between bandit gangs and large households had always been quite subtle. Especially in remote mountainous areas like Lianyang, the connection between bandits and large households was not as simple as "secret collusion"; sometimes they were "allies": in the common clan and local-guest armed conflicts in the local area, large households often hired bandits to increase their combat power, and bandit gangs were also happy to act as thugs for large households, thereby obtaining extra income, safe shelters, and channels to communicate with the government. In particular, the large quantities of grain, cloth, and salt needed by bandit gangs relied almost entirely on colluding large households for supply.

The articles issued by the Australians were naturally worded severely—the key was that carrying the might of the Battle of Dalang Market, no large household in the county dared not take their words seriously: Sun Dabiao’s whole family's heads were hanging neatly.

It was no wonder the first thing Bi Xuansheng did was show him the proclamation. This was a matter of life and death!

He shook his head, put the proclamation over the oil lamp to burn it, then asked, "Did you see Master Zhan?"

"I saw him," Bi Xuansheng said. "I didn't dare take the main road with my followers, only detoured on small paths—damn it, there were village braves from large households even on the small paths. Every village and stockade had people standing sentry. As soon as they saw strangers approaching, they beat gongs to summon village braves for interrogation. Fortunately, I brought plenty of dry provisions and didn't starve to death..."

Feng Haijiao had no interest in listening to his adventure story and interrupted him, "What did Master Zhan say?"

"Master Zhan's meaning is the same as what I said last time. He asks you, Old Sir, to immediately abandon Qinglian Market, take your men and horses to join forces with him, and then make plans. Xin Family Manor has precipitous terrain, easy to defend and hard to attack. The Hair thieves won't be able to fight there for a while..."

"I know that manor of Xin Laonan. Precipitous is precipitous, but the manor is a palm-sized place. We are bringing several hundred brothers plus family members; where will we live?"

"We can only ask everyone to build sheds to make do. This place, Qinglian Market, has no natural barriers to defend." Bi Xuansheng persuaded, "The Hair thieves' navy on the river is strong, and they control the entire water route, with ships coming and going at will. If the Hair thieves attack by both water and land, we won't be able to resist..."

Although so far, the Australian fleet and patrol boats had only reached the county seat and had not yet gone upstream to the Qinglian Market area, going upstream to the local area was only a matter of time.

Qinglian Market was surrounded by water on three sides. Feng Haijiao could entrench himself here entirely relying on the water potential. However, the Australian gunboats were a hundred times more powerful than his own rowing boats. If it was truly as Bi Xuansheng said, and the Australians advanced by both water and land, this Qinglian Market would be a death trap!

Thinking of this, Feng Haijiao collapsed into the grand arm chair, silent for a long time.

Bi Xuansheng knew these words had moved him, secretly admiring Master Zhan's brilliant plan, so he spoke according to what Zhan Zhekun had taught him beforehand: "I looked at that place, Xin Family Manor. The manor is a bit small, but there is plenty of land and few people on the mountain. We build sheds to make do for a few months first, then slowly build houses—the brothers' dwelling places will naturally be there..."

Feng Haijiao shivered; he remembered: Xin Laonan’s manor was very small, with no more than twenty households: either his kinsmen or his trusted aides. Counting fully, there were no more than twenty able-bodied men. Zhan Zhekun and Bi Xuansheng brought thirty-some followers to Yangshan. That is to say, there were less than a hundred able-bodied men at Xin Family Manor now...

He immediately racked his brains to recall the appearance of Xin Family Manor: he had been there once many years ago, and the impression was already very blurred. But he roughly remembered it was amidst the mountains. The manor was on a flat piece of land at the mountain top. To go up the mountain, one had to pass a rugged mountain road, with several dangerous passes along the way. It indeed had the meaning of "one man guards the pass, ten thousand cannot open it."

There were dozens of *mu* of fields and a water source on the mountaintop. He had also hoarded a lot of grain and provisions; taking them all up the mountain, several hundred people could hide up there without worrying about food and drink. No matter how powerful the Hair thieves were, they couldn't pull cannons onto the steep mountain road...

Feng Haijiao was moved. As long as he took his men and horses to Xin Family Manor, this Xin Family Manor would take the surname "Feng." Even if Zhan, Xin, Bi, and others had complaints, they wouldn't dare to act rashly—if they really disobeyed, he would just slaughter them all in one go! Xin Laonan had robbed on the Lian River for many years; presumably, he also had quite a few good things.

Thinking of this, Feng Haijiao nodded and said solemnly, "It seems this is the only way!" He pretended to shake his head painfully and sighed, "What a pity. This Qinglian Market is the capital with which I made my fortune; now I actually have to leave it to the Hair thieves!" After saying this, he squeezed out a few tears.

Bi Xuansheng persuaded, "Master, do not be sad. A great man can bend and stretch. Now we go up the mountain to avoid the wind. When the imperial army counterattacks, won't Master come down the mountain and have this Qinglian Market returned to its original owner just the same?"

Although it was empty talk, it was very agreeable to Feng Haijiao. He laughed, "Master Bi is indeed a scholar, knowing how to speak so well!"

"Not at all; we all have to rely on the Master's great fortune." Bi Xuansheng said respectfully. "Won't this Yangshan be the Master's sooner or later?"

Feng Haijiao put on an act for a while, then immediately ordered the various leaders and steward bandit chiefs in the gang to pack up luggage and items, organize grain, fodder, gold, and silver, and prepare for the whole gang to retreat to Xin Family Manor.

However, wanting to run was not simple. Feng Haijiao had entrenched himself in Qinglian Market for many years. Just the family members of the gang living locally numbered two or three hundred. Including those who joined in recent months, there were fully five or six hundred people. Among them were many women and children. They had to bring supplies and soft valuables. Xin Family Manor was fully seventy or eighty *li* away from here, mostly mountain roads. His team had both family members and carried many supplies; walking twenty *li* a day would be considered good. Even if the journey was smooth, it would take at least four or five days to arrive. If they encountered an attack halfway, such a team dragging families and mouths would instantly collapse.

He thought over and over: only by risking taking the water route of the Lian River. If they didn't encounter Australian patrol boats, they could save more than half of the road. Once they entered the mountains, it wouldn't be easy for the Australians to intercept them.

Therefore, while ordering boats to be prepared, he sent people to monitor various key points along the river near the county seat. Once they discovered Australian boats coming toward Qinglian Market, they were to immediately light beacon fires to raise the alarm.

"If it really doesn't work, we'll sail at night," a subordinate suggested.

Sailing at night was extremely unsafe. Neither locals nor Australians sailed at night. Feng Haijiao lived off the water all year round and was very familiar with the hydrology and geography of the Lian River, so risking night navigation was barely feasible.

"Just do it like this!" Feng Haijiao said. "Pass the order down: tell everyone to pack up their bedding and prepare to move house!"
