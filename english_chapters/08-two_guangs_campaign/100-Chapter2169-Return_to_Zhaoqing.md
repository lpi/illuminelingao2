# Chapter 2169 - Return to Zhaoqing

Li Dong's militia training assignment at Xugang lasted one week. Though setbacks occurred, progress ran reasonably smooth—the bandit siege had terrified Xu family elders thoroughly. They looked toward "Great Song military lords" for salvation; not only did they readily consent to reorganizing the militia, they'd have gladly offered concubines besides.

Bei Wei had issued directives governing militia reorganization. Fundamentally, militia required emphasizing "localization" while stressing "home territory" concepts. Only then would individuals lacking political training possess sufficient motivation fighting for "defending homes and

 villages." As long as they didn't depart homeward, their combat effectiveness would actually exceed regular soldiers'.

The deteriorating late Ming social security environment had prompted villages of any scale organizing vigilante groups centered on clans or local gentry and magnates. These village vigilantes ranged from dozens to over a hundred members, effectively forming militia prototypes. However, vigilante quality varied tremendously. Most lacked training; some included local "ruffians" who'd prey first upon villagers instead. Moreover, clan-centered and magnate-centered vigilantes frequently became "private armies." Consequently, Bei Wei's militia reorganization fundamentally focused on transforming existing vigilantes.

Though some questioned how effective transformation could prove without addressing rural villages' socioeconomic foundations, current circumstances left the Senate no alternatives. They could only adopt "half-baked rice" approaches—dispatching armed patrols to various villages for initial organization, bringing grassroots settlements under preliminary control.

Militia organization experience had accumulated amply during Hainan security operations and proved largely applicable in Guangdong. Following models conscripting one in two able-bodied men from large villages and all able-bodied men from small ones, village militias organized and equipped with cold weapons, minimal captured firearms, and armor. Villages were additionally urged constructing defensive facilities.

Currently, given Senate capacity limitations, directly leading and training these village militias proved impossible. Bei Wei established this objective: Village militia unit commanders and deputy commanders must receive appointments from local county National Army garrison squadrons while accepting county-level command.

The militia commander's primary duty involved maintaining local village security while establishing mutual defense relationships with surrounding settlements. Mutual defense transcended merely designating certain village quantities—it derived primarily from terrain conditions. Generally, inter-village distances shouldn't exceed 3 kilometers straight-line—reachable on foot within thirty minutes—permitting villages mutual support.

When militia units received county summons for external missions, deployments generally wouldn't exceed one month. Under normal circumstances, village militias wouldn't fight beyond their county.

Villages with insufficient populations would adopt consolidation measures, merging several small settlements into one with superior defensive conditions, ensuring each village possessed at minimum thirty able-bodied men.

The baojia system was strictly enforced across all villages—"strictly" because baojia systems had already existed under the Ming Dynasty. The Liangguang region, given Yao unrest problems, already maintained baojia in every village. Now it underwent further rectification and continuation. Bei Wei ordered each county garrison dispatching squads to villages, improving baojia sequentially while establishing village household registration books: one copy retained per individual, one by the county. Outsiders lacking fixed residences required obtaining guarantees from established local families. Those without guarantors, possessing suspicious backgrounds, or constituting local "undesirables" were all concentrated into county seat labor camps for re-screening.

"Mutual vigilance" policies implemented in villages. Each village established signal towers. Neighboring settlements communicated alerts via smoke signals daily and fire signals nocturnally. Once alarms raised, relays proceeded to county seats. When distress signals transmitted, excepting nighttime when departure could delay until dawn, all mutual defense network villages must dispatch militia assistance. When goods transported by water or land, each village's militia would escort in relay; any losses compensated by villages responsible for that leg.

Under normal circumstances, such transformation would demand tremendous effort, especially given heavy village militia burdens. But presently, threats of bandit pillage, murder, and abduction made villages enthusiastic about establishing militia, implementing baojia, and constructing defensive walls. Village consolidation also proceeded relatively smoothly. Though consolidation meant property losses, bandits couldn't steal land. As long as people survived and times became peaceful, family fortunes could always rebuild.

Li Dong's Xugang assignment progressed fairly smoothly. Xu Weicheng agreed to all requests, rapidly training a 120-man militia, all armed with standard spears and machetes. They also distributed a dozen or so bird guns and light Folangji cannons from Yu'nan County cached captured goods. They even specially procured several armor suits.

When these armor suits arrived, they appeared quite shabby: rusty, with some leather straps connecting pieces already broken, parts missing. But when the militia's select "elite" donned them and paraded, Li Dong noticed quite a few of his own men observing enviously.

Regardless, possessing armor meant improved survival prospects.

For Xugang's residents high and low, this weapons and equipment arrival deepened their Senate trust: timely neighboring county National Army rescue during their crisis hour, now counties distributing weapons and assisting militia training. Common folk, rich or poor alike, felt that in this precarious, turbulent era, they'd finally discovered a reliable protector.

Li Dong lacked mental bandwidth for soldiers' thoughts. He urged them relentlessly training the militia. One week proved far too abbreviated for proper militia training, but vigilantes from various villages hadn't received substantial prior training anyway—barely managing village stockade defense. Now, following brief training, combat effectiveness had improved somewhat. Particularly, former vigilante leader Xu Yong demonstrated tremendous training enthusiasm, constantly pestering Li Dong learning "Australian martial arts." He refused believing  Ausländer soldiers' close-combat training truly comprised merely those few simple moves. Li Dong found him exhausting.

After one week, Li Dong's detachment boarded transport ships heading downstream from Wuzhou. However, his orders specified not returning to Wuzhou but immediately proceeding downstream reporting at Zhaoqing.

The company they'd departed with had split in two: Battalion Commander Zhu Si remained at Fengchuan with half a company, while he led the other half to Zhaoqing. What was happening?

Orders were orders. Regardless of Li Dong and others' confusion, all soldiers boarded downstream transport ships and arrived at Zhaoqing.

Zhaoqing hosted First Brigade headquarters and West Guangdong Forward Command seat. Massive troop concentrations had always characterized it. When Li Dong arrived with his half-company, he discovered even more troops here than during last month's passage, alongside numerous transport ships.

Anyone possessing minimal military experience could discern that Zhaoqing was brewing large-scale military operations.

"Careful—boat's docking..."

With a sailor's shout, three Daihatsu boats slowly berthed.

"Disembark! One at a time, no shoving." Sergeants called out as Li Dong stretched his back and stepped onto the gangplank.

Immediately upon debarkation, a logistics station officer approached them.

"Which unit?"

"Wuzhou National Army Composite Company..."

"From Fengchuan?"

Li Dong reflected they certainly knew situations well:

"Correct."

"Leave all weapons behind," the logistics officer directed. "Retain only daggers and Nanyang rifles."

Everyone exchanged bewildered glances. Constant weapon-carrying since enlistment had been emphasized relentlessly during training. Even when resting, weapons required proper stowage permitting instant access. Why were they being instructed disarming immediately upon debarkation? And if disarming, why permission retaining rifles?

Still, having received instructions, they naturally must comply. They surrendered standard spears, machetes, and similar weapons—Li Dong noticed quite substantial piles of standard spears and cold weapons already accumulated groundward.

Could they be receiving complete re-equipment? The thought flashed through Li Dong's mind.

Before he could think it through, additional boats arrived dockside. Several officers onshore waved flags bearing unit numbers, calling assembly—reinforcements from the Guangzhou National Army had arrived.

These companies already bore double-digit numbers. The soldiers still exhibited raw recruits' characteristic unease. Clutching their standard spears, they appeared pathetic and comical. Battle-tested Wuzhou Company men walked past feeling quite superior. Li Dong suddenly experienced some sentimentality: his brothers had appeared equally green departing Sanshui last month. In such brief time, they could now flaunt seniority—time genuinely flew.

The logistics officer assigned them temporary tent barracks areas—requisitioned barracks and temples already were filled completely.

"We possess company establishment but only half-company strength," Li Dong puzzled, seeing assigned barracks could accommodate over one hundred.

"Submit your shortage report tonight—we'll bring you to strength." The logistics officer held a clipboard, writing upon it. "Logistics issued instructions: all units must reach establishment strength. You observed replacement soldiers dockside? They'll supplement the squadrons."

"Adding forty greenhorns to make half—this promises rough fighting..." Luo Mao interjected.

The logistics officer smiled. "Fight several rounds and they'won't remain greenhorns. Tonight, inspect your Nanyang rifles; report damage immediately. Don't forget reporting ammunition shortages either."

"Are we receiving rifles for everyone?" Li Dong asked.

"Correct." The logistics officer nodded. "Your company performed well, consequently selected for re-equipment. Work diligently—plenty of merit-earning opportunities ahead!"

These words confirmed suspicions that major operations loomed imminently. The soldiers stirred. Li Dong quickly responded, "What's all this gabbing? Continue and you'll conduct night drills tonight! Now go prepare for billeting!"

"After billeting preparations conclude, send twenty soldiers to the logistics station for work detail picking up supplies." The logistics officer observed the formation. "How many do you actually possess currently?"

"Report—actual strength is sixty. However, three lack military registration..."

These three constituted "locally recruited" personnel during their Xugang stay. Logistics acknowledged such local replenishment but required completing formalities afterward.
