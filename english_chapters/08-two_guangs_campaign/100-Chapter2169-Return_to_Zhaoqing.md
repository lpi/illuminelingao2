# Chapter 2169 - Return to Zhaoqing

Li Dong's militia training work in Xugang lasted a week. Though there were setbacks, things went fairly smoothly—the bandit siege of Xugang had scared the Xu family elders out of their wits. They looked to the "Great Song military lords" for salvation; not only did they readily agree to reorganize the militia, they would have happily offered up their concubines.

Bei Wei had issued a directive on how to reorganize the militia. Basically, the militia had to emphasize "localization" and stress "home territory." Only then would people lacking political training have sufficient motivation to fight for "defending their homes and villages." As long as they didn't leave home, their combat effectiveness would actually exceed that of regular soldiers.

The deteriorating social security environment of the late Ming period had led villages of any size to organize vigilante groups centered on clans or local gentry and magnates. These village vigilantes ranged from a dozen to over a hundred people, effectively forming a prototype of "militia." However, the quality of these militia varied greatly; most were untrained, and some included local "ruffians" who would first prey on the villagers instead. Moreover, vigilantes centered on clans and magnates often became "private armies." So Bei Wei's militia reorganization was essentially focused on transforming the existing vigilantes.

Although some questioned how effective this transformation could be without touching the socioeconomic foundation of rural villages, the current situation left the Senate no choice. They could only adopt a "half-baked rice" approach, dispatching armed patrols to various villages to initially organize and bring the grassroots villages under preliminary control.

Experience in organizing militia had been amply accumulated during the security operations in Hainan and was largely applicable in Guangdong. Following a model of conscripting one in two able-bodied men from large villages and all able-bodied men from small villages, village militia were organized and equipped with cold weapons, small numbers of captured firearms, and armor. Villages were also urged to construct defensive facilities.

Currently, with the Senate's capacity, direct leadership and training of these village militia was impossible, so Bei Wei set the goal: The commanders and deputy commanders of village militia units must be appointed by the local county National Army garrison squadron and must also accept county-level command.

The militia commander's main duty was to maintain local village security while establishing mutual defense relationships with surrounding villages. Mutual defense wasn't simply a matter of designating a certain number of villages; it was primarily based on terrain conditions. Generally, the distance between villages shouldn't exceed 3 kilometers in a straight line, reachable on foot within half an hour, so villages could support each other.

When militia units were called up by the county for external missions, deployments generally wouldn't exceed one month. Under normal circumstances, village militia wouldn't fight outside their county.

Villages with too few people would adopt consolidation measures, merging several small villages into one with better defensive conditions, ensuring each village had at least thirty able-bodied men.

The baojia system was strictly enforced in all villages—"strictly" because the baojia system had already existed in the Ming Dynasty. The Liangguang region, due to the Yao unrest problem, already had baojia in every village. Now it was being further rectified and continued. Bei Wei ordered each county garrison to dispatch squads to the villages, improving baojia one by one while establishing village household registration books: one copy kept by each individual, one by the county. Outsiders with no fixed residence had to obtain guarantees from established local families. Those without guarantors, with suspicious backgrounds, or local "undesirables" were all to be concentrated into the county seat's labor camps for re-screening.

"Mutual vigilance" policies were implemented in villages. Each village established a signal tower. Neighboring villages communicated alerts with smoke signals during the day and fire signals at night. Once an alarm was raised, it would be relayed to the county seat. When a distress signal was sent out, except for nighttime when departure could be delayed until dawn, all villages in the mutual defense network had to dispatch militia to assist. When goods were transported by water or land, each village's militia would escort them in relay; any loss would be compensated by the villages responsible for that leg.

Under normal circumstances, such a transformation would require great effort, especially given the heavy burden on village militia. But now, the threat of bandit pillage, murder, and abduction had made villages enthusiastic about establishing militia, implementing baojia, and building defensive walls. Village consolidation was also proceeding relatively smoothly. Though consolidation meant property losses, land couldn't be stolen by bandits. As long as people survived and times became peaceful, family fortunes could always be rebuilt.

Li Dong's work in Xugang went fairly smoothly. Xu Weicheng agreed to all his requests, quickly training a militia of 120 men, all armed with standard spears and machetes. They also distributed a dozen or so bird guns and light Folangji cannons from the Yu'nan County cache of captured goods. They even specially procured a few suits of armor.

When these suits of armor arrived, they looked quite shabby: rusty, with some leather straps connecting the pieces already broken, missing parts. But when the militia's select "elite" put them on and showed off, Li Dong noticed quite a few of his own men looking on with envy.

Regardless, having armor meant better chances of survival.

For Xugang's residents high and low, the arrival of this weapons and equipment deepened their trust in the Senate: the timely rescue by the neighboring county's National Army in their hour of crisis, and now the county distributing weapons and helping train militia. Common folk, rich or poor, felt that in this precarious, turbulent era, they finally had a reliable protector.

Li Dong didn't have the mental bandwidth for the soldiers' thoughts. He urged them relentlessly to train the militia. A week was far too short for proper militia training, but the vigilantes from various villages hadn't received much training before anyway and could barely manage to defend the village stockades. Now, after their brief training, combat effectiveness had improved somewhat. In particular, the former vigilante leader Xu Yong was very enthusiastic during training, constantly pestering Li Dong to learn "Australian martial arts"—he didn't believe that the Australian soldiers' close-combat training was really just those few simple moves, and Li Dong found him exhausting.

After a week, Li Dong's detachment boarded a transport ship heading downstream from Wuzhou. However, his orders were not to return to Wuzhou but to immediately proceed downstream to report at Zhaoqing.

The company they'd left with had been split in two: Battalion Commander Zhu Si had stayed in Fengchuan with half a company, while he led the other half to Zhaoqing. What was going on?

Orders were orders. Regardless of how confused Li Dong and the others were, all soldiers boarded the downstream transport ship and arrived at Zhaoqing.

Zhaoqing was the headquarters of the First Brigade and the seat of the West Guangdong Forward Command. Large numbers of troops had always been concentrated here. When Li Dong arrived with his half-company, he found even more troops here than when he had passed through last month, as well as a large number of transport ships.

Anyone with a little military experience could tell that Zhaoqing was brewing a large-scale military operation.

"Careful, the boat's about to dock..."

With a shout from a sailor, three Daihatsu boats slowly docked at the berth.

"Disembark! One at a time, no shoving." The sergeants called out as Li Dong stretched his back and stepped onto the gangplank.

As soon as he came ashore, a logistics station officer came to meet them.

"Which unit?"

"We're from the Wuzhou National Army Composite Company..."

"From Fengchuan?"

Li Dong thought they certainly knew the situation well:

"That's right."

"Leave all weapons behind," the logistics officer said. "Keep only daggers and Nanyang rifles."

Everyone looked at each other in bewilderment. Carrying weapons at all times was emphasized constantly in their training since enlistment; even when resting, weapons had to be properly stowed so they could be accessed instantly. Why were they being told to disarm as soon as they came ashore? And if they were disarming, why were they allowed to keep rifles?

Still, since they'd been told to do so, they naturally had to comply. They left behind their standard spears, machetes, and other such weapons—Li Dong noticed there were already quite a lot of standard spears and cold weapons piled on the ground.

Could they be getting a complete re-equipment? The thought flashed through Li Dong's mind.

Before he could think it through, more boats arrived at the dock. Several officers were on shore waving flags with unit numbers, calling for assembly—turns out reinforcements from the Guangzhou National Army had arrived.

These companies had numbers already in double digits. The soldiers still had the unease characteristic of raw recruits. Holding their standard spears, they looked so pathetic and comical. The men of the battle-tested Wuzhou Company walked past them feeling quite superior. Li Dong suddenly felt a bit sentimental: his brothers had looked just as green when they left Sanshui last month. In such a short time, they could now flaunt their seniority—time really flies.

The logistics officer assigned them to a temporary tent barracks area—the requisitioned barracks and temples were already full.

"We have a company establishment but only half a company's worth of people," Li Dong was puzzled seeing that the barracks assigned could house over a hundred.

"Turn in your shortage report tonight, and we'll bring you up to strength." The logistics officer held a clipboard and was writing on it. "Logistics has issued instructions: all units must be brought up to establishment strength—you saw the replacement soldiers on the dock? They're to supplement the squadrons."

"Adding forty greenhorns to make up half—this is going to be a rough fight..." Luo Mao interjected.

The logistics officer smiled: "Fight a few rounds and they won't be greenhorns anymore—tonight, check your Nanyang rifles; report any damage right away. Don't forget to report ammunition shortages too."

"Are we getting rifles for everyone?" Li Dong asked.

"Correct." The logistics officer nodded. "Your company performed well, so you were selected for re-equipment—work hard, there'll be plenty of opportunities to earn merit!"

These words confirmed the guess that a major operation was imminent. The soldiers stirred. Li Dong quickly said, "What are you all gabbing about? Keep it up and you'll be doing night drills tonight! Now go prepare for billeting!"

"After billeting preparations are done, send twenty soldiers to the logistics station for work detail to pick up supplies." The logistics officer looked at the formation. "How many do you actually have now?"

"Report, actual strength is sixty. But three don't have military registration..."

These three were "locally recruited" during their stay at Xugang. Logistics acknowledged this kind of local replenishment but required formalities to be completed afterward.
