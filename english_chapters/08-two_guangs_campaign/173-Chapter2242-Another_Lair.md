# Chapter 2242 - Another Lair

"Bring him in quietly—and fast." Bi Da said. "Use him as the breakthrough to catch Zhang Tianbo!"

Li Shuangkuai had spent the last few days in fear. Zhang Tianbo's turning coat was no surprise to him—they, the yamen regulars, had never been the same sort as the Australians. But he had not expected Zhang Tianbo to be so bold as to openly play inside-man at the county gates!

True, Sun Dabiao had won a victory at Dalang Market—reportedly taking a hundred baldy heads, slaying the Australian County Magistrate on the spot—and the whole county was talking. But Li Shuangkuai, with his years of experience, could guess that the Australians would not take this lying down. Especially since Sun Dabiao had failed to take the county seat itself—the most critical point in the county was still in their hands, and Australian ships were still plying the river without pause.

At the moment, the baldies were holed up in the city. But once they caught their breath and brought in reinforcements, Sun Dabiao's days would not be so easy.

What happened to Sun Dabiao did not concern Li Shuangkuai. What worried him was Zhang Tianbo.

Not that he worried about Zhang Tianbo's life or death—in fact, if Zhang died now, Li Shuangkuai would breathe easier. He worried that his connection to Zhang Tianbo might bring the Australians down on *him*.

Everyone in the county knew of his relationship with Zhang Tianbo. The Australians never let a grudge go unanswered. If they could not get at Sun Dabiao, venting on Zhang Tianbo was the obvious next step.

Zhang Tianbo was hiding with Sun Dabiao—out of reach. But his family was not at Dalang Market. Though not hidden on Li Shuangkuai's estate, he knew where they were. If the Australians came to force him to reveal where Zhang Tianbo's family was, what would he do?

Jiang Xiaotian had urged him: just grab your valuables and join Sun Dabiao at Dalang Market—they all had old ties, and Zhang Tianbo was there too.

"You can go; I can't." Li Shuangkuai smiled bitterly. "You're still young, no family. I've got one foot in the grave and a houseful of women and children. As for face, I've probably got a little left with Sun Dabiao and Feng Haijiao. Going alone isn't a problem—but I'd have to bring my family. Dalang Market is a bandit lair now—not a single building left, all grass hovels. How would women and children settle in? Even Zhang Tianbo didn't dare bring his family to Dalang Market!"

Worrying about the women and children was real, but Li Shuangkuai was even more worried that joining them would count as "going greenwood." All the property he had scraped together over a lifetime—his estate—would vanish.

Li Shuangkuai was loath to give up his holdings but afraid of implication. He sighed all day long. He thought of entrusting his family to someone—but looking around, there was not a single person he could trust. He had been a constable in Yangshan for decades, "friends" all over the county—but now, not one was reliable.

Still, the last few days had calmed him a little. He had heard the Australians had not shipped in reinforcements—instead, they had sent a new County Magistrate—a *woman*, no less! That became big news. Everyone in the county—whatever their trade—gaped: *A female County Magistrate? What kind of move is that?*

Li Shuangkuai could not figure out what the Australians meant. But since no reinforcements came, they would not be taking action. And he had heard that over the past days they had been loading large goods and wounded onto boats at the dock—one boat after another sailing away—no longer heavy in, light out.

*Could the Australians be running?* Li Shuangkuai reckoned it was possible. They had suffered badly at Dalang Market. Without reinforcements, they could not hold. And word was their grain-collection teams were having no luck—if they could not collect grain, they could not stay in Yangshan...

If the Australians could not hold on, naturally they would have no time to settle accounts with Zhang Tianbo. Li Shuangkuai felt better—*Hurry up and leave!*

That evening, Li Shuangkuai finished dinner and went over his accounts. He had his widowed daughter-in-law bring his grandson to recite lessons. This grandson was the only male heir of the Li family. Li Shuangkuai treasured him like a jewel; two years ago he had hired a tutor to start his schooling. But the boy's aptitude was nothing special. Two years of teaching, and while others could recite the third or fourth volume of the *Book of Odes*, he could not even finish the first.

The boy was stumbling through the *Odes*. Li Shuangkuai listened with eyes closed—but his mind was not on the recitation. He was planning the Li family's next move. Yangshan was full of danger. If the Australians left, the county would not be peaceful. The Ming were not coming back anytime soon; the various bandit factions would fight it out. Though he had connections with all sides, at this juncture, old friendships might not outweigh hard cash. How should an old man like him maneuver to keep home and hearth safe?

It suddenly occurred to him that it would be better if the Australians did *not* leave. With them here, at least there was still "law and order"; once they left, it would be lawless chaos. He sighed softly—at bottom, those who ate the yamen's rice prospered only in peaceful times. In troubled times, without the yamen, who would respect a head constable?

At this moment, he even felt a twinge of regret.

The grandson's halting recitation stopped. Li Shuangkuai grunted: "Why are you so rough on the text? Your tutor needs to drill you harder..."

He opened his eyes—and froze in shock.

In the hall, four or five men had appeared out of nowhere. Each wore short jackets and leggings, carrying double-barreled shotguns. They had the servants at gunpoint. His widowed daughter-in-law clutched the grandson, trembling like chaff.

"Gentlemen..." Li Shuangkuai panicked—*Which crew is this?* Then he knew: Australians!

His heart sank. *They came after all!*

He forced calm: "What hill, what mountain do you good men come from...?"

The lean, dark leader grinned: "Constable Li! No need for thieves' cant—we're from the Yangshan County Government. Please come be our guest!"

"I... this old man is getting on in years..."

"No matter. We've arranged a sedan chair. And the County Magistrate says that with law and order so bad, she's worried your family might be in danger once you leave the estate—so she has invited everyone to be guests together."

---

"Li Shuangkuai's whole family has been brought in?" Bi Da asked.

"That's right." Luo Yiming smiled. "Company Commander Zhen and his men swept up the Li estate—old and young, top to bottom—brought them all to the county seat. Not one got away!"

"And the estate?"

"I posted a squad to hold it, with a few prisoners. Anyone who shows up gets grabbed."

"You handle the interrogation. Get everything about Zhang Tianbo out of them—fast." Bi Da instructed. "The old man was a constable—probably slippery as an eel..."

"No problem. We've got his only grandson—can Zhang Tianbo be more important than his grandson?"

Without much effort—just a mention that his "precious family has been comfortably settled"—the crafty old ex-constable spilled Zhang Tianbo's whereabouts.

Zhang Tianbo was indeed with Sun Dabiao—but he was not prospering. His attempt as inside-man had failed; the county gates had not opened. Zhang Tianbo had become useless and was being sidelined.

As for Zhang Tianbo's family, they were still at Xin Laonan's estate. But there was another force there now—ostensibly protecting, actually guarding.

"Whose force?"

"I don't know." Li Shuangkuai said dejectedly. "I'm told it's some Ming official's men. To keep Zhang Tianbo hostage."

"We got the location of Xin Laonan's estate from him. We've sent scouts. We should hear back soon."

The scouts brought news quickly: Xin Laonan's estate was indeed heavily guarded—tight security everywhere.

"The estate is in a very remote spot; the terrain is treacherous, hard to find. We couldn't get inside. But we gathered intel from nearby villages. This 'Master Xin' always had underworld ties—twenty or thirty thugs under him. Not long ago, a new force came and took over the whole place. Now there are over a hundred men—all from out of the county, by their accents. Word is they came from Guangning County!"

"So Li Shuangkuai's confession checks out! Zhang Tianbo's family really is at Xin Laonan's estate!" Luo Yiming slammed his fist on the table.

"If there are a hundred guards, we'll need to deploy troops to grab him." Zhen Huan said. "Our company can move out immediately!"

"I don't think we need to grab Zhang Tianbo's family anymore." You Ciren said. "The enemy is already guarding against that move. Even if we seize his family, we can't hide the news. Zhang Tianbo would instantly become 'worthless'—very likely he'd be disposed of right then... But there's something odd here."

Everyone looked at You Ciren.

"After Zhang Tianbo's insider attempt failed, he became insignificant. Why would the enemy post a hundred men at Xin Laonan's estate?"

"You mean...?"

"That estate may not be just a hideout for family." You Ciren said. "It could be one of the enemy's secret lairs... The scouts said the newcomers came from Guangning—and many out-of-county bandits have been pouring in, some joining Sun Dabiao. They're probably all connected!"

"Then we hit Xin's estate first?"

"No—our goal right now is to assert authority. Even if we catch a big fish at Xin's estate, it won't help our credibility campaign." Luo Yiming said. "I say: we stick to the original plan—attack Dalang Market. At the same time, keep Xin's estate under surveillance. First, we map out their connections; second, if there really is a big fish, we can scoop him up in one stroke!"
