# Chapter 2085 - A Memoir of Liberation (Part 2)

When I returned home, I discovered the family truly couldn't make ends meet. Though my sisters were young, there were many of them, and they ate a lot. My parents couldn't support us, so they sold my eldest sister to the Sun household as a maid. They also gave away my third sister as a child bride—hoping to give her a way to survive. But within a few years, her in-laws abused her to death. To this day, I can't forget the sight of her crying and begging our parents not to take her away the day she was led off—whenever I think of it, I can't stop my tears. How I wish she could have lived to see these good days! But back then, poor people simply had no choice.

With many mouths at home, and myself at the age when a growing body needed nutrition, I never ate enough. So I went to the mountains to cut firewood to help the family. Each day I'd carry a load to the street—sell half, give half to Brother Hai. Then I'd do odd jobs so at least I'd have three meals. Whenever Brother Hai slaughtered a pig, he'd save the cuts that wouldn't sell well—offal, scraps, the like—as a return gift. Thanks to Brother Hai, my family occasionally tasted meat. This was how we depended on each other, bound together through hardship.

My memories of that era are two things: hunger and disorientation. The hunger—real, constant hunger, as if a cat were clawing at my stomach twenty-four hours a day. Worse than hunger was the loss of direction. With no more schooling, my dream of passing the imperial examinations and bringing glory to my family was shattered. The road ahead offered two choices: one was to follow my father's path, tilling Sun Shiwan's land for life without pay, passing the hope of escaping military registration to the next generation. The other was to follow Uncle Jizai's path—become a common soldier, charge into battle, perhaps trade for glory through military merit. But I wanted neither. I sensed dimly that farming as an unpaid tenant would only perpetuate a cycle. And becoming one of those common soldiers who terrorized civilians—my gut rejected the idea.

Just as I was sinking into this double despair of body and spirit, the guide who would lead me toward the Council of Elders' great cause appeared.

Uncle Jizai was my father's youngest brother—my uncle. He was a garrison "operating soldier."

In my childhood memories, Uncle Jizai used to behave no differently from those military thugs: idle all day, picking fights. Later, when Wang Zunde recklessly launched the so-called "Second Encirclement," Uncle Jizai followed the Ming bandit army to Hainan Island. He was captured at Chengmai Beach and spent several years working off his redemption before returning home.

The Uncle Jizai who came home was transformed!

That was my first impression upon seeing him. I couldn't possibly connect this dark, muscular man—eyes sharp, movements swift, sitting and standing like a soldier—with the sickly layabout in my memory. Looking back now, the Uncle Jizai who reported back to the garrison was more like a Fubo Army soldier than a Ming troop. More astonishing still: Uncle Jizai, who had never attended a day of school, could now read!

It was about his second month back. I was in the courtyard reviewing the *Analerta* I'd once copied out. Uncle Jizai happened to return from outside. Passing by, he glanced over and scoffed: "The *Analects*? Confucius's crap—what good is it?" I was stunned. If it had been my father, he couldn't have told whether I was reading the *Analects* or something else. I asked, "Uncle Jizai, how do you know this is the *Analects*?" He pointed at the page I had open, laughing: "This line is 'To study and practice timely, is this not joyful?' right? Ha! Surprised? Your uncle can read now!"

I was astonished and begged him to explain. It turned out Uncle Jizai had once considered staying in Lingao—and in Lingao, illiterates couldn't get anywhere. To land a decent job, you needed a diploma. In the Lingao POW camp, there was a literacy program. Uncle Jizai had actually applied himself and earned a Class-B diploma. He'd even given himself a proper adult name based on a homophone: Liu Ji. He'd gotten the equivalent of a *juren* degree, he said. After that, whether joining the military academy or the civil service, everything would be within reach. If not for fear that the Ming authorities would treat him as a deserter and harm our family, he wouldn't have come back at all.

Now I was truly amazed—this was unprecedented in thousands of years of Chinese history! I pestered Uncle Jizai to tell us about what he'd seen and heard in Lingao. He was happy to "tell stories" to us children, teaching us "new characters" and "new speech." In those dark days, Uncle Jizai showed us an entirely different world and brought a bit of light into my life. Self-propelled iron ships without sails! Steel giants as strong as oxen (Editor's note: referring to excavators)! Great trains spewing black smoke yet racing along rails at tremendous speed! At the time I thought he was exaggerating. I just loved hearing about how the Fubo Army drilled and fought, impatiently interrupting whenever he talked about technology. Only when I later reached Lingao myself did I realize Uncle Jizai hadn't been boasting! From then on, I utterly despised Confucius and his followers. As Uncle Jizai used to say when telling his "stories": Can the *Analects* make a train run? Win a hundred battles? Make enough grain grow to feed the people? Give people good lives? If not, what right do his followers have to sit on the people's heads and shit?

*(Editor's note: According to our research, "Uncle Jizai" refers to former Zhaoqing Deputy Mayor Liu Ji, who held positions including Zhaoqing Garrison Office Liaison, Zhaoqing Municipal Propaganda Department Staff, Fengkai County Deputy Magistrate and National Army Company Commander, and Fengkai County Magistrate. He received one Chairman's Commendation, two May First Labor Medals, and all three grades of the "Service to the Council of Elders and the People" Medal. He made tremendous contributions to Guangdong's liberation and reconstruction.)*

The year 1635 AD was destined to become the most memorable year of my life. First, my eighth brother—"Fazai"—was born just after Spring Festival. Though my carefree sisters were delighted, my parents were torn between joy at the new life and worry at another mouth to feed. To ease the family burden, Uncle Jizai said he could feed himself outside and rarely came home for meals. I took odd jobs for the Sun household—asking no wages, only food—to save portions for the family. We barely scraped by, keeping my little brother from dying of malnutrition.

The second thing was much bigger.

That year, our Fubo Army swore their oath and crossed the sea for the Northern Expedition. On March 1, Guangzhou was liberated. When news arrived, the then-Governor-General Xiong Wenchan panicked, ordering garrison mobilization and issuing proclamations to organize local militia. People who'd never had to serve were being conscripted. But my family had old ties to Sun Shiwan—the whole garrison knew. The conscription officer wanted to fill his quota but feared offending Sun Shiwan, so he came to our house with threats and inducements to get me to register. My father dared not speak, only sat sighing. My mother, fearing I'd die in battle, urged me to run. But where could I run? If caught at this juncture, I could be beheaded. Uncle Jizai went to argue with the officer: our household had only two adult males counting him, and he was already serving as an operating soldier. By the rules, one man per household was enough—why should I also have to go? The officer pointed to little Fazai in my fourth sister's arms and said that with Fazai, I counted as a surplus male and had to enlist by regulation. Uncle Jizai cursed him loudly, swearing he'd die a miserable death for such cruelty. But the local official trumped the distant court—what could we do? In the end, Uncle Jizai came up with a plan. He told my parents that the Fubo Army was a civilized force that didn't kill prisoners. As long as I followed him, he'd bring me back safe. So I reported for duty.
