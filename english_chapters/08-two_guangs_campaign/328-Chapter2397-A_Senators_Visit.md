# Chapter 2397: A Senator's Visit

Zhang Yu had already learned about the Nanyang Company's stock subscription from the *Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce Weekly*. This weekly publication was distributed free to members, and while most people simply used it as wrapping paper, for merchants like Zhang Yu who understood the Senate's methods, it was an important window into policy trends.

The Nanyang Company's nature, function, stock subscription, and bond issuance had all been reported in detail. Though Zhang Yu was a small merchant of the seventeenth century, concepts like raising capital and issuing debt were not modern inventions. Ming Dynasty Guangzhou had its own primitive versions. Even his family's small "Zhang's Old Shop" had neighbors who deposited money at the counter to earn interest—was that not essentially issuing debt?

Zhang Yu was very supportive of the matter itself. In his view, whatever the Senate did was correct. The Nanyang Company's fundraising was, in fact, another huge "windfall"—yes, Zhang Yu could already skillfully apply these new terms.

Going down to the South Seas to make big money was a consensus among Guangzhou citizens. They'd seen too much of it. However, going to the South Seas also meant enormous risk. Many went and never returned, and some who were lucky enough to come back did so destitute. Ordinary people had neither the financial resources nor the courage to attempt it.

Zhang Yu knew the Australians themselves had started as sea merchants and possessed all kinds of great ships and heavy cannons. The silver they earned every year flowed like water. To attach oneself to them and do business in the South Seas promised easy money. Offering Federation of Industry and Commerce members a chance to subscribe was not merely to raise funds but also signified acceptance as "one of us."

He understood Gao Ju's intention: whether stocks or bonds, Gao Ju wanted to coordinate subscription quantities with him. Gao Ju was now the number one merchant in Guangzhou under the Senate's banner, and Zhang Yu was number two. Although his wealth couldn't compare to even one of Gao Ju's pinky fingers, his status was very high. Naturally, Gao Ju wanted to hear his plans first before deciding on a reasonable number to preserve everyone's dignity.

If it were anyone else, the consideration would differ—but the problem was that Zhang Yu had no spare money, only added worries.

If he told Gao Ju he didn't intend to subscribe, wouldn't that put Gao Ju in a difficult position? It would waste his good intentions. Master Gao was now a rare "friend" of Zhang Yu's in Guangzhou's business circles; he offered suggestions and helped solve many operational issues. From any angle, Zhang Yu couldn't afford to embarrass him.

Furthermore, as a "key private enterprise" supported by the Senate and one of the twenty-five council members of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, if he didn't contribute a single feather to such a major Senate project, what kind of intention would that show? What attitude would it express?

Thinking of this, his back felt cold.

It is lonely at the top. Young Master Zhang had already deeply experienced this feeling.

*If only I could find a sum of money somewhere!* he thought, feeling that he'd never worried about money as much as he did now—even before he'd struck it rich, he hadn't lost sleep over it.

Whatever the case, he went to the factory that morning for a routine walk-through to check on things. Listening to the stewards' reports, everything was normal. He breathed a sigh of relief and returned to the shop.

Although the shop's signboard still read "Zhang's Old Shop" and theoretically wasn't his company, in the minds of ordinary Guangzhou citizens, the fact that he was the young owner was rock solid. So he often showed his face in the shop, greeted customers, and asked for their opinions. First, to show he "dared not forget his roots," and second, to solicit feedback on products—now that production was high and many new varieties had been introduced, firsthand feedback was essential.

Zhang Yu had helped out in the shop since he was small and was most familiar with the routines of welcoming and sending off guests. He was handsome and sweet-talking, bringing a lot of goodwill to his shop. Especially after he made his fortune, his occasional presence to greet customers won him even more favor.

In the afternoon, customers were sparse. Zhang Yu was organizing the running accounts behind the counter when he suddenly heard a greeting from a clerk. Looking up, he saw two customers enter. One was tall and one short, both with short hair and wearing "Kun" clothing. The short young man walking in front looked about sixteen or seventeen, carrying a briefcase. The tall one followed behind, fair-skinned, about thirty years old, and appearing to be in a good mood.

One look and it was clear they were "eating Australian rice." Zhang Yu dared not neglect them and quickly put down the ledger.

Observing their expressions and demeanor, he immediately determined that the tall one was a "Senator." This was reflected not only in his posture and expression but also in his clothing: although the style was similar to the short one's, the material and cut were obviously of a different class.

It wasn't rare for Senators to visit the shop to browse or buy. After all, Zhang's Walnut Cakes were famous, and Senators wanted to see and taste for themselves.

But the more who came, the more careful Zhang Yu became. He firmly remembered his father's teaching: "A hundred people have a hundred hearts." It was true that Senator Hong and others looked highly upon him, but there was no guarantee of what other Senators thought. So he'd issued a strict order in the shop: all guests must be treated with diligence; no slighting of guests was allowed.

Since this was a Senator, he was twelve thousand times more careful. He quickly went up to welcome them personally, bowing and saying, "Welcome, honored guests, to Zhang's Pastry Shop. May I ask what you'd like?"

The Senator didn't answer immediately but scanned the entire shop before saying, "I'm just looking around."

This confirmed the Senator's identity even more. Zhang Yu had contacted many Senators and knew their temperaments varied, but they were similar in one respect: everyone tried to show that they possessed deep "city" (shrewdness). So they often spoke very briefly and rarely made specific declarations in public.

He immediately responded, "Yes, yes, please call if you need anything."

Chu He scanned the shop. The decoration style here was very similar to Zhongyi Trading Company—nine out of ten, it was the work of the same construction company. However, the decor here was slightly more exquisite. The counters against the wall and display tables in the middle were all glass food bins with glass lids. Inside, a dazzling array of various pastries, biscuits, and candies filled the view. In a trance, it had a bit of the flavor of Yili Food Company from the 1980s.

Seeing so many varieties, Chu He hesitated—he wanted to taste them but didn't know which walnut cake was most famous. Just as he was about to ask, Zhang Yu chimed in.

"Chief, if you aren't sure, you can try the flavors first." Saying this, he personally brought over a large lacquer tray.

The lacquer tray was rectangular and very large, divided into many small compartments, each containing fragments of various pastries and candies. As soon as it approached, a sweet fragrance overflowed, mixed with the rich aroma of spices and dairy products.

Chu He laughed, "Your family really has a lot of varieties!" He didn't pick up a toothpick immediately but asked, "I've heard your walnut cakes are famous. Which ones are they?"

Zhang Yu quickly put down the tray and pointed. "These compartments hold our shop's signature walnut cakes. There are three flavors: original, salt and pepper, and sesame candy."

Chu He picked up a toothpick and tasted a few pieces—honestly, while the taste was decent, this kind of heavy oil, heavy sugar, heavy seasoning food wasn't exactly a delicacy for people from the old spacetime.

However, he still smiled and praised, "Delicious!" Then he said to Piao Zhixian, who was already showing a greedy look, "You try some too."

Piao Zhixian had been waiting for this sentence. He immediately picked up a toothpick and started eating, repeatedly saying, "Delicious!"

Chu He said, "I'll take two *jin* of each of these three flavors of walnut cakes. I'm traveling a long way, so pack them sturdily."

Zhang Yu said eagerly, "Chief, please rest assured. My humble shop has special travel packaging. Wooden boxes with rattan woven outer covers, lined with paper inside. Even with the bumps of boats and carts, I guarantee they'll be intact when you get home..."

Chu He laughed, "You knew I was a Senator?"

"As soon as the Chief entered the door, I could tell. How could ordinary people possess the Chief's bearing and demeanor..."

"Alright, enough flattery." Although the praise was low-level, it was still pleasant to hear. Chu He then looked him up and down seriously and said, "You're the young owner here, Zhang Yu, right?"

"I dare not accept the words 'young owner.' This small one is Zhang Yu."

"What's this 'small one' and 'big one'? You've shaved your head and worn our Australian clothes—why do you still speak like that?"

"Yes, yes, I am Zhang Yu." Zhang Yu thought to himself that every Chief's routine was exactly the same! But with every unfamiliar Senator who arrived, he referred to himself as "this small one." First, to show humility, and second, because while the Chiefs said they disliked it on the surface, they actually enjoyed the tone.

Seeing Senator Chu looking around, Zhang Yu immediately invited, "Chief, please sit upstairs. Let me serve tea."

Chu He had intended to talk with this benchmark private entrepreneur of the Senate anyway, so he said, "Good, I wanted to chat with you too." Then he said to Piao Zhixian, who was currently "taste-testing," "Try them all. If there are good ones, bring some for your sister."

Piao Zhixian said, "Sister loves sweets! I think buying one or two *jin* of each is just right..."

Chu He laughed, "Are you preparing to feed your sister into a pig? She's gained quite a bit of weight lately!"

Zhang Yu accompanied them with a smile and welcomed Chu He into the reception room on the second floor. This was where he specially entertained guests and discussed business. The decoration was done in "Australian" style. Though he hadn't managed to obtain authentic "Australian leather/fabric sofas," the room full of Australian-style rattan living room furniture was the first of its kind in Guangzhou city.

Since it was winter, the rattan sofas were covered with hand-embroidered cotton cushions, making them very comfortable. Chu He looked around the reception room and saw a plaque with gold characters on a black background hanging on the wall, reading eight characters: "Be an Honest Person, Do Honest Business." On the other wall were pasted four propaganda posters: "Launch the New Life Movement!", "Epidemic Prevention and Rat Extermination is Everyone's Responsibility", "Strictly Guard Against Spies!", and "Enliven the Market, Satisfy the People's Needs."
