# Chapter 2277: Hundred Aspects in Camp

The several scrolls opened were all orchids, postures different, forms distinct. Yi Haoran looked and was secretly surprised—he was very shallow in the path of calligraphy and painting, but basic literati cultivation was still present. Looking at these orchids, all had an air of gloomy and scattered state.

Since ancient times zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting could all be voice of the heart; the person painting this obviously had low spirits.

"Orchids painted by this person, without exception have a desolate artistic conception of fishing alone in cold river snow; truly lamentable. This should not be painted by a True Australian Senator."

"Of course not." There was only one chair in the room; Chang Qingyun could only sit on the bamboo board bed, hugging knees saying, "I originally also thought this was painted by some Senator. However, at this moment they are exactly at the time of success; how can they have such a state of mind? Does not make sense, does not make sense. Besides..."

"Besides, this is also a woman." Yi Haoran said.

"You also saw it?" Chang Qingyun stared blankly, saying, "Unexpectedly Old Brother is also skilled in this path..."

"Where, these brush strokes are slender and soft, absolutely not a man's handiwork. Hair thieves in Wuzhou don't have women."

Yi Haoran came in originally to probe the actual situation of the captive camp. At this moment these few paintings hooked up his curiosity—obviously, Hair thieves valued this painting so much, naturally also valued the painting woman very much. Who exactly was this person...

"Over there Australian wants painting and singing in harmony. To be honest I don't know how to put down the brush. Her painting intent is too desolate and lonely. Painted orchids either rootless and soilless, or growing in sludge and muddy water. If complying with her painting intent, my painting should also be a scene of bleakness and sorrow..." Chang Qingyun was chattering about his own creation experiences.

Suddenly Yi Haoran slapped the table, shouting loudly: "I know whose painting this is!"

"?" Chang Qingyun opened his mouth wide, not knowing why he was so excited, "What person?"

"This is Cai Lan’s painting!" He said excitedly, "Definitely won't be wrong, all matches up!"

"Who is Cai Lan?" Chang Qingyun was confused.

"Xing Chenghuan’s fiancée."

"Xing Chenghuan?" Chang Qingyun searched his guts and belly, suddenly remembered, "Could it be Master Hu, Wuzhou Prefect's advisor?"

"It is him." Yi Haoran nodded heavily, "Wuzhou city broke; he committed suicide to martyr for the city and died."

"So it is like this..." Chang Qingyun suddenly realized, "No wonder her painting realm is so dejected, and specially painting orchids!"

"I only heard some days ago, there was a woman assassinating True Australian Senator at Dragon Mother Temple. At that time I suspected it was her. Heard at that time Cai Lan failed assassination and was captured. Originally thought mostly she martyred for husband curbing thieves and died; didn't expect unexpectedly followed True Australian Senator..."

Originally Yi Haoran seeing this painting, and hearing Chang Qingyun’s description, had this heart. At the time of military chaos, the woman Wuzhou city's True Australian was willing to spend such great thought to please, only Cai Lan who specially sought Qiuchan to accompany was the one person.

This Hair thief Xie indeed had elegant interest! Yi Haoran disdained secretly.

"She is alone here; being able to do the thing of assassinating True Australian is already not easy. Now obeying Australians, is nothing more than compromising to seek completeness..."

"Hehe! Isn't starving to death a small matter, losing chastity a big matter! She has no children below to extend heirs for husband, no parents-in-law above to support. Seeking what completeness? Nothing more than greedy for life and afraid of death, dragging out existence in the world! Rare that Master Xing treated her with a piece of ice heart. When things came to a head, she refused to die to martyr for him, instead doing such shameless matter!" Yi Haoran cursed like venting.

Chang Qingyun’s face turned red, vaguely feeling this Yi Haoran was pointing at the mulberry to curse the locust. However, he dared not contend with him, having to swallow anger and submit.

Yi Haoran cursed a few sentences, suddenly realizing he lost composure too much. What place was here?! If heard by people and reported, he and Chang Qingyun dying was not to be regretted, wouldn't this Anti-Hair Great Cause be ruined!

Immediately said: "Ashamed ashamed, I lost composure. Brother Chang forgive, forgive."

"Easy to say, easy to say." Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly with a face of helplessness.

Yi Haoran calmed down at this time. He thought this was actually also a good opportunity. Judging from her painting, although Cai Lan had followed thieves, her heart was unwilling; painting intent was full of pain and shame. If having a chance to explain with reason, move with emotion, then reproach with great righteousness, she could greatly be used by me—this function was far from what Jiang Qiuchan could compare.

Thinking of this place, he was secretly excited. But he didn't intend to reveal it to Chang Qingyun. He felt this Master *Juren*'s will was very unstable; although barely participating in his "Great Cause," still unwilling. If he spoke too clearly, scaring him bad, it would be easy to ruin matters instead.

Thinking here, he had already thought of a countermeasure.

"According to my view, rather than saying you paint this painting for Cai Lan to see, better say painted for Australian to look." Yi Haoran made up his mind, "You look at this Cai Lan’s painting; orchids either rootless or in sludge and muddy water. What meaning is this?"

"Orchids rootless, formerly Zheng Yiwong painted orchids mostly like this—to show noble and unsullied, unwilling to be stained by soil of barbarians. But also painting orchids in sludge and muddy water... aren't the painting intents of the two opposite." Chang Qingyun somewhat couldn't understand.

"This is actually pain in her heart." Yi Haoran sighed with emotion, "At first she martyred for husband, actively went to assassinate Australian, because Han and thieves cannot both stand; after being captured followed thieves, lost chastity, heart unwilling."

"So it is like this." Chang Qingyun nodded, "Only this echo of mine..."

Yi Haoran said: "I see for Brother Chang to echo is also easy. This Australian mostly harbors intentions towards Cai Lan. Wanting to entice her happiness. If you blindly cater to Cai Lan, painting all cold suburbs and lean islands paintings, firstly Australian won't like looking, secondly just in case this Cai Lan is hooked up infinite sadness by your painting, seeking short-sightedness herself, wouldn't you be a big sinner."

Chang Qingyun trembled, thinking in heart I was truly confused to the extreme! Just thinking hard about how to echo, didn't expect the joint here at all! If really Cai Lan sought short-sightedness, the first one True Australian angered would inevitably be himself!

"Master Yi truly has far-sightedness! However, if making it festive and rich, fear can't match intent either..."

"This Cai Lan at any rate is a jasper of small family from a scholar line, also has pain of losing husband. If painting brocade chicken and peony, instead greatly inappropriate." Yi Haoran pondered for a moment, "Brother besides flowers and birds, can paint landscape?"

"Naturally can paint too."

"That is it. Brother Chang might as well paint a few 'Spring Outing Map' 'Treading Snow Seeking Plum Map' and such; artistic conception take leisurely and comfortable. Australian naturally can't spot anything; this Cai Lan seeing won't overthink either."

"Good!" Chang Qingyun was somewhat excited; he almost forgot why this old man in front of him came into the captive camp. He was just about to open mouth to speak, suddenly a burst of noisy sound sounded outside. Among which were men's cursing, also women's splashing and crying, and people advising by the side.

"What matter?" Yi Haoran startled, asked.

Chang Qingyun gestured him not to speak, walked to bedside himself, quietly pushed open the grass curtain on the window to look out. After a moment turned head back saying: "No hindrance. A little housework of other family." Saying so sighed.

"After all what matter?" Yi Haoran aroused curiosity, whispering.

"Ashamed to say." Chang Qingyun sighed again, "I just told you, living here are all officials and dependents sent from various places."

"So what?"

"Australians considered treating them well, allowing their families to live together, usually assigning light tasks too. Although tasks are light, you also know these households serving as officials outside: passing exams for fame mostly after middle age; young adults are one in a hundred. Also mostly four limbs diligent not, five grains distinguish not. Even lighter tasks done are topsy-turvy; being able to finish quota is considered not bad, let alone exceeding quota.

"In outside post, had clerks and servants to support; now locked in this camp, all servants are gone, everything has to be done by hands. Still has a family old and young to eat and drink. Relying only on Australian rationing, how is enough! Although not to extent of starving to death, but this life lacking food and clothes is really hard to endure. Days long can't endure this suffering, ordering wives and concubines to sell smiles in camp, earning some extra food and clothes..."

He shook his head not without bitterness, "Earlier these people mostly felt ashamed, only asking maidservants and concubines to sell smiles. Gradually there were those pushing daughters into fiery pits too. Lamentable fathers, brothers and husbands spend days enjoying this, actually shameless, often even haggling over money amount, making noise for this... Just now was for this matter."

Yi Haoran was not surprised by this kind of thing. He had seen much more suffering in the human world than Chang Qingyun. Under desperate straits, whatever reputation and integrity would be abandoned by people.

"So it is like this." He asked, "Australians don't care?"

"Australians don't care about matters of reputation and integrity; perhaps better say, wishing under heaven there are no words 'Reputation' and 'Integrity'!" Looking at Chang Qingyun’s appearance, obviously also had quite some criticism towards Hair thieves, "This kind of thing, in their view isn't it a big good thing? Both damaged scholars' face, and soiled Daming's officials and gentry; to them that's called wished for but not obtained! The gang of stewards here originally are not kind kind; now Australians indulge again, even more lawless. As long as paying donations and taxes on time, surprisingly everything can be at own convenience! Originally this flesh business was done only for captive guards in camp; later fame grew big, even fake Australian soldiers stationed nearby came to destroy soul, increasingly flourishing!" Chang Qingyun sneered.

Noisy sounds outside gradually subsided. Suddenly, door of a room next door was fiercely pushed open, someone ran inside. Immediately following, door was kicked open by someone, heard someone shouting:

"You adulterous woman slave, Master Liu calling you to accompany wine yet dare to put on airs! Think yourself still some golden honored jade expensive Eldest Miss?" Saying so was crisp four slap sounds and sound of crying pain falling to ground.

Then heard a man curse: "You get up and kneel for me! See if I don't whip you rotten, a hoof! Don't deny face given!" Then sounded leather whip, mixed with woman's miserable howling. This whipping was a dozen whips. Suddenly door sound rang again, another woman's sound came in saying: "Brother, don't beat her bad! Skin and flesh broken appearance, how to accompany Master drinking at night?"
