# Chapter 2192 - The First Step Starting from Yangshan

When Peng Shouan was first assigned to Yangshan, everyone thought it was a hardship post, but he didn't care. Although there were many mountains and little land here, and Yao people causing trouble, it was a remote place after all. The Hair thieves who roamed the four seas would definitely not run to this poor remote place of Yangshan to look for trouble with him.

His expectations were not high either; scrape a little if possible, and resign to return to his hometown after the three-year term expired.

This wishful thinking almost succeeded. Just when his term expired peacefully and he was waiting to hand over to the successor magistrate, news came that Guangzhou had fallen and the Hair thieves set up officials to govern locally.

Since Guangzhou had fallen and the Hair thieves wanted to set up officials to govern, the following things were obvious without asking—Peng Shouan had also read a few geography gazetteers and knew a bit about mountains and rivers geography. Since the Australians intended to manage Guangzhou for a long time, they wouldn't just hole up in one place. They would surely go north to the Five Ridges—this remote Yangshan County seat wasn't a paradise outside the world either.

Thus, he waited for the successor Zhou Liangchen with eager expectation. After waiting for Zhou Liangchen with great difficulty, someone sent a document. Although this document was sent by a Hundred Household of the Guangzhou Guard, the signature was "Grand Song Liangguang Pacification Commissioner Wen Desi."

The content of the letter was nothing more than asking him to offer the city and surrender, saying Great Song would absolutely not "make things difficult" for him, and would let him "stay or leave at will." Peng Shouan originally wanted to throw this hot potato to Zhou Liangchen, but after reading this letter, Zhou Liangchen had other plans. He insisted on not letting Peng Shouan leave office, insisting he "help manage the difficult times together," saying the situation was critical and it was time to use people. He was new to your honorable county and didn't know the local sentiments clearly, needing him, the former magistrate, to assist more. Peng Shouan wanted to run away several times but was intercepted by his family servants. Later, this Magistrate Zhou simply put him under house arrest.

Peng Shouan naturally knew what abacus this kid was beating. If the Hair thieves really came, he could just walk away, leaving his former magistrate to be the scapegoat; if the Hair thieves didn't come, his magistrate post could continue. So Peng Shouan just dragged on with Zhou Liangchen for a few days. Then another news came: Qingyuan and Yingde counties were captured by the Hair thieves successively. Yingde County didn't even persist for more than a day; it was broken in less than two hours.

Yingde was only one day's water route from Yangshan. Those Hair thieves could arrive under the city anytime. Yangshan didn't have many soldiers, nor suitable generals, and grain and grass were not sufficient. Everyone knew Yangshan County didn't have the capital to resist the Hair thieves. So only two choices were left in front of Peng Shouan: one was to fight, then die in battle or commit suicide for the city. Peng Shouan didn't want to die, and neither did Zhou Liangchen. Originally the two faced each other without speaking, but now forced by the situation, they had to gather together to discuss this issue.

According to Zhou Liangchen's calculation, he prepared to walk away if the Hair thieves really attacked, lying that he hadn't taken office in Yangshan yet and "surrendered to the enemy." However, for the current situation, "running is the best policy" couldn't be done. The various counties around Yangshan surrendered to Great Song one after another—this was secondary; the fatal thing was that unruly people everywhere took advantage of this chaotic situation to become bandits one after another. Not only did the "people outside civilization" in the mountains come out to loot, but even the registered commoners in the valleys also transformed, intercepting merchants and killing passersby on the roads. If the two magistrates wanted to flee the city, they would become "fat sheep" before running out of Yangshan County seat.

Peng Shouan couldn't run, nor could Zhou Liangchen. A group of large and small flowing officials in the county had nowhere to go—many of them also dragged families along. Without the official prestige of Great Ming, they would be unable to move a single step once leaving Yangshan County seat.

The two discussed with other officials in the city. Everyone coyly and hypocritically talked about "life is difficult," sighed about the "critical current situation," and lamented "people's livelihood is hard," then from the angle of "sharing worries for the people," decided to "submit to Great Song to keep the commoners safe."

Immediately they drafted a surrender letter, stating that the Yangshan County Yamen up and down "all admire Great Song's heavenly grace, looking forward to the Senate like looking forward to sweet rain during a long drought," willing to "serve like dogs and horses" for the Senate.

Finally, starting from Zhou Liangchen, civil and military officials of Yangshan, regardless of rank, all signed their names. When Peng Shouan wrote his name, his hand trembled a bit, having quite a meaning of "being forced to follow thieves." After the group finished signing, Zhou Liangchen ordered three reliable family servants to take this surrender letter and travel day and night with the messenger back to Guangzhou, sending this surrender letter to the Hair thieves' high official.

After the family servants left, an old man in the yamen office, unknown whether an Instructor or Jail Warden, started sobbing. Then quite a few people followed to howl dryly. Peng Shouan also followed to cry for quite a while.

Crying was crying. Surrendering was like selling oneself in a brothel; before selling, there was all kinds of suffering and a thousand kinds of worries in the heart. Once really sold, it was just like that. Without Great Ming, there was still Great Song. At least there was a backbone—it was this thought that allowed them to unite under the siege and attack of Yao people, holding out until Huang Chao came to rescue.

Recovering Yangshan, Huang Chao didn't feel too happy. First, Lianshan was destroyed very severely; his plan to replenish grain here went completely bankrupt—not only was it difficult for the troops to replenish grain here, but they also had to transport grain from outside to support the local population. Second, there was no "mass foundation" here at all. Because this was a remote backwater, both transportation and commerce were extremely undeveloped. The External Intelligence Bureau didn't station intelligence personnel locally, and merchants of the Five Mountains and Five Banks rarely came here. The three words "Australians" didn't have high popularity locally. This meant they had no credible people locally, and could only rely on retained personnel in the county yamen. And the Senators had always been untrusting of retained personnel.

"Let's go inspect the county seat. This place is also an important support point for us." Huang Chao really couldn't figure out why such a large Yangshan city was occupied by a mere few hundred Yao people without decent weapons in hand. But walking to the southeast corner of Yangshan County seat and seeing the city wall being repaired by concentrated manpower after being collapsed by floods, he understood immediately. The accompanying Peng Shouan said that after the city wall was soaked and collapsed by floods a few years ago, although money and grain were raised quickly to repair it, it was never repaired well, and the construction progress was slow.

"...For the repair of this city wall, the subordinate also donated thirty taels. However, the collapsed city wall exceeds a hundred *zhang*; a mere few hundred taels of silver isn't enough at all..." Peng Shouan was full of complaints speaking of this matter. For repairing the city wall, he ran around for several months and managed to get more than two hundred taels of silver from local gentry, big households, and merchants with great difficulty, yet it wasn't completed after more than a year of repair. After Zhou Liangchen came, he had been watching the situation and had no heart to repair the city either. The gap in this city wall remained open like this until the Yao people rushed in.

Huang Chao sighed and shook his head repeatedly: The efficiency of this ancient government doing things was really low enough.

He ordered an immediate check of the material losses in Yangshan County seat. Although the Yao people didn't set fire after attacking into the city, they looted everything exhaustively. Not to mention soft goods and valuables, they didn't even let go of tables, chairs, benches, and baskets—it could be imagined how poor their usual life was.

"It seems that without solving the economic problem, this Yao chaos cannot be calmed."

Huang Chao called over the captured Tianchang Gong of several Yao stockades. The Yao people of Yonghua Township frequently dealt with Han people of Yangshan County, so they all spoke Han dialect and could communicate without interpreters.

"As far as I know, the Yao people of Yonghua Township have always been law-abiding. Why did you suddenly rebel together with the Eight Row Yao?"

"It was the Majian Row coercing us. If we didn't agree, they would go down the mountain to rob our stockades." Pan Tianshun took the lead to say.

"Coercing you, so you rebelled? Your four stockades are still afraid of one Majian Row?"

"Our four stockades have few people. Dragging along children and old people, able-bodied men are only just over four hundred. Majian Row combined with the other seven rows, just able-bodied men are two or three thousand. Our four stockades are not opponents. Besides..." Pan Tianshun stopped here.

"Besides what?" Huang Chao pressed.

"Dalang Market's Sun Dabiao doesn't let others sell salt to us. We can only buy his salt. Recently he raised the salt price. If we buy salt, we don't have enough money to buy grain. The harvest hasn't been good in recent years, and now it's the time when green is gone and yellow hasn't connected. Without salt to eat, we will die; without grain to eat, we will also die. The Magistrate doesn't dare to control him, so..." Pan Tianshun hesitated again.

"So what, speak quickly!" Huang Chao was impatient.

"So we had to do it with everyone, first finishing off Sun Dabiao, this salt dog, and his whole family—it's just that he managed to run away."

Huang Chao knew this person Sun Dabiao. Through the Intelligence Bureau's Yangshan material compilation, he knew Sun Dabiao was ostensibly a merchant selling salt in Dalang Market, but in fact was a bandit leader. He had over a hundred underlings and three or four hundred home-dwelling bandits listening to his orders. No wonder the Yao people of Yonghua Township hated and feared them.

Yonghua Township Yao people rebelling was barely excusable, but Huang Chao was very dissatisfied with Pan Tianshun pretending to be pitiful. He asked again: "Let's not talk about you burning and robbing Sun Dabiao's home—he deserved it. But the commoners in this county seat have no grudge against you, right? Usually, you would come to the county seat to attend markets. Now look at what this county seat has been ruined into by you! You robbed quite a few commoners of Yangshan County seat, right? Where are the people you abducted? And the things?"

The four Tianchang Gong looked at each other, then three Tianchang Gong stopped their gazes on the Tianchang Gong of Baimang Stockade.

Pan Tianshun immediately threw stones down the well: "Those looting in the city were all people from Baimang Stockade. Many people in their stockade are bandits under Sun Dabiao, and they also communicate with Eight Row Yao all the time. Their entering the city this time was purely to grab things."

Baimang Stockade's Tianchang Gong was scared pale. He hurriedly knelt down to defend: "Lord, those robbing things were not only Baimang Stockade people, right? Those communicating with Eight Row Yao were not only Baimang alone either! Everyone had a share!"

Huang Chao didn't want to investigate the truth of Baimang Stockade Tianchang Gong's words deeply. The matter of Yao people looting Yangshan County seat must have a scapegoat, and slaughtering the entire Yonghua Township Yao people was not quite realistic. He could only let Baimang Stockade take the blame.
