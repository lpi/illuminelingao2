# Chapter 2398: A Sky-High Opportunity

This "Ming-Australian" hybrid decoration style was now quite popular among merchants in Guangzhou who interacted with the Australians, used to show that their relationship with the Australians was "not ordinary." However, it was the first time Chu He had seen it, and he found it quite fresh. He couldn't help looking around and saying:

"Your layout here is really distinctive!"

"New society, new atmosphere," Zhang Yu replied. "Chief, please drink tea." As he spoke, he went to get the Kung Fu tea tray.

When Hong Huangnan did business in the past, he had picked up the habit of drinking Kung Fu tea from Fujian merchants. In the new space-time, ever since the Agricultural Committee tossed out "Limushan Oolong Tea," he had gradually restored the Kung Fu tea set. Zhang Yu followed suit and also started drinking this "Australian Kung Fu Tea."

Seeing Zhang Yu bustling about to brew tea, Chu He waved his hand: "I can't drink that Oolong tea. Do you have simpler tea water?"

"Yes, yes," Zhang Yu busily said. "We have loose tea here, and also Kvass, all specially imported from Hainan Island..."

Seeing the Chief's lack of interest, Zhang Yu suddenly thought of something and said, "Chief, you can try our family's new fruit tea. We currently have kumquat lemon and passion fruit. We use fresh jams and juices delivered daily. Many Chiefs have said it's good."

Chu He didn't expect to find fruit tea here. He was surprised and asked, "Really? Okay, okay, bring one cup of each flavor. Did you come up with this yourselves?"

Zhang Yu instructed the clerk to prepare it while saying, "It was a recipe given by Senator Zhang Xiaoqi. We just followed it—it's just that the jams and ingredients still need to be imported from Lingao. Chief Zhang said that in a few years, when the farms here are set up, the local food factories can produce their own jam."

"With this channel, you're bound to make a fortune in the future. Open a fruit tea counter in the shop to sell alongside your dry pastries. Once you have brand recognition, you can sell it all over the streets. Guangzhou weather is hot; with ice cubes, it will be cool and refreshing. Your wealth will roll in, tsk tsk..."

This idea was exactly what Zhang Xiaoqi had proposed back then; otherwise, Zhang Xiaoqi wouldn't have given him the recipe and allowed him to buy ingredients from special supply channels. But at this moment, Zhang Yu put on a "suddenly enlightened" expression, beaming with joy as he said: "What the Chief says is true! Why didn't I think of that! This is a good way to make money!" He then put on a look of worship: "No wonder everyone says the Chiefs can touch stone and turn it to gold!"

This flattery was struck just right, making Chu He feel "Senatorial joy." Although he had to show some modesty, the smugness in his heart inevitably leaked out.

Seeing this, Zhang Yu felt a bit more confident about how to handle what was coming next.

Seeing the Senator drink the fruit tea and lean back against the rattan backrest, Zhang Yu knew that the Senator was physically and mentally relaxed. It was a good time to talk, so he quickly asked, "I wonder how I should address the Chief?"

"Oh! My surname is Chu, Chu He."

"So it is Chief Chu!" Zhang Yu's heart tightened, because he had learned of Chu He's "deeds" yesterday.

The content he knew was very limited, including "explosive" news like Chu He making a scene at the City Hall, but he knew that the Senator Chu before him was a rising "new star" in Guangzhou city. And he knew that Senator Chu had a close relationship with the newly established "Nanyang Company."

That he came to his small shop and specifically "sat down to talk," made Zhang Yu's heart constrict—one must know that a Senator's time was very precious. Even his great patron, Senator Hong, wouldn't sit down specifically to talk with him unless there was urgent business. This Senator Chu obviously came prepared. Could it be he came to solicit shares?

Thinking of this, his heart instantly hung in suspension. Yet he dared not show a fraction of it, hurriedly saying:

"Hello, Chief Chu. Your face looks a bit unfamiliar; is this your first time in Guangzhou?"

"It's my first time." Chu He didn't care at all. "Originally I came on a business trip, but now it looks like I'll probably be stationed in Guangzhou long-term."

"Then you must have been promoted," Zhang Yu complimented.

"Where, where, it's all to serve the Senate and the people," Chu He said. "You are the boss of this Zhang's shop, right?"

"Yes, I am the General Manager of Zhang's Food Company." Zhang Yu used this "Australian-style" title.

"I've long heard that your management is impressive and that you are a famous emerging enterprise in Guangzhou. I even saw military rations and pastries produced by you in Jeju."

Zhang Yu quickly said: "This is all due to the Senate's promotion. My family was originally just a small brand in Guangzhou city, a business of three or four people. To have today is entirely reliant on the Senate's policies!"

Chu He came here today partly on a whim, but also with the intention of showing goodwill to Hong Huangnan. Undoubtedly, this Senator who controlled military logistics and practically was in charge of the actual supply affairs for all Senators and naturalized citizens in Guangdong was obviously "especially worth befriending."

Nanyang stocks and bonds were equivalent to "boat tickets" for the new government. Who could get them, and how many, contained benefits far greater than economic returns. The new nobility supported by the Senate would not fail to understand this principle. Hong Huangnan would certainly know the implications.

But as a dignified Senator, he couldn't open his mouth to peddle like an insurance salesman. So he beat around the bush and asked:

"How is the revenue situation of your Zhang's?"

Zhang Yu's heart shook: *As expected!*

Asking about revenue was nothing more than checking his bottom line to see how much financial power they had, so shares could be apportioned.

He dared not be reckless and hesitated for a moment before saying: "Thanks to the great fortune of the Senate, business is quite remarkable. The monthly sales are over a thousand. If not for the plague, and labor and raw materials failing to keep up, we could have done even more..."

"Sales over a thousand—that's over ten thousand a year. This turnover isn't small." Chu He came from a finance background and naturally understood the meaning in his words: not mentioning gross profit, not mentioning net profit, only stating sales volume, and an approximate imaginary number at that. Obviously, there were reservations.

Of course, leaving three points of leeway when speaking to strangers was normal. To put it bluntly, if he weren't a Senator, Zhang Yu would probably just laugh and say nonsense like "business is pretty good."

From this, it seemed Zhang Yu acted prudently and spoke carefully; he possessed neither the arrogance typical of the nouveau riche nor the loss of wits and loose tongue upon seeing a Senator. Chu He's impression of him improved a few notches.

"From your words, I fear there are still difficulties in this business?"

Zhang Yu's heart tightened again. It seemed he couldn't dodge this. The other party's words were gentle and seemed to leave room for discussion. However, if he just sighed about his hardships now, it would be tantamount to a disguised refusal. Letting Senator Chu come in high spirits and leave disappointed would be highly inappropriate.

Zhang Yu stood up to refill Chu He's fruit tea, taking the opportunity to deliberate, then returned to his seat and said: "Our difficulties, compared to our peers, count as being pretentious! First, there is currently a shortage of manpower. Suitable workers are hard to find, and qualified stewards are even scarcer. It affects production; many orders are pressed down and can't be fulfilled. It delays things!"

Chu He was already prepared to hear him talk about turnover difficulties and tight funds—for a company like Zhang's that had risen so explosively, capitalize turnover problems were normal. Otherwise, what were banks and investors for? He didn't expect him to speak of manpower difficulties first; there must be a mystery in this.

But since there was the disadvantage of not being able to escape, getting some benefits as compensation was only normal. So a few days after the Southward Advance Plan was announced, Joint Logistics also secretly held a small meeting and made "work deployments" regarding the Southward Advance.

Wait, I think I mixed a paragraph from Chapter 2405 (about Joint Logistics / Hong Huangnan having a meeting) into the thought process of Chu He in 2402?
Let me check the source of 2402 again.
In 2402:
"But since there was a 'first', naturally there would be a 'second'..."
"Second is the capital turnover..."
It does not mention the "work deployments". That was in 2405.
Let me double check my translation draft for 2402 above.
"But since there was a 'first,' naturally there would be a 'second,' let's hear him out." is correct.
I seem to have pasted the wrong text into the "thought" block in my brain just now, but the `CodeContent` I prepared earlier for 2402 looked correct.
Let's review the `CodeContent` for 2402 again.

Source 2402:
"不过既然有“一”，自然还有“二”，且听他说下去。"
"二就是资金周转了。想必首长您也猜到了..."

My previous `CodeContent` in thought process:
"But since there was a 'first,' naturally there would be a 'second.' Let's hear him out."
"Second is the capital turnover..."

It matches. I will proceed with writing 2402.

One small correction: "But since there was the disadvantage of not being able to escape, getting some benefits as compensation was only normal. So a few days after the Southward Advance Plan was announced, Joint Logistics also secretly held a small meeting..."
This paragraph is definitely NOT in 2402. It was in 2405.
I will ensure I don't include it in 2402.

Let's re-verify the end of 2402.
Source 2402 ends with:
"下得楼来，只见朴智贤端坐在店里，面前堆了许多小筐小盒，一面大嚼曲奇饼一面指点着铺面上的各种商品：“这个也要二斤！对！一个也不要少！都要！”"
Translation:
"Coming downstairs, they saw Piao Zhixian acting like a lord in the shop... 'Two jin of this too! Correct! Not one less! I want them all!'"

Okay, good to go.

Order of paragraphs in 2402:
1. Decor...
2. Fruit tea...
3. Chu He name...
4. Revenue...
5. Difficulties...
6. Manpower...
7. Capital turnover...
8. Chu He's reaction...
9. Nanyang opportunity...
10. Zhang Yu agrees...
11. Departure...

Wait, in my thought stream for 2402 just now, I saw:
"But since there was the disadvantage of not being able to escape, getting some benefits as compensation was only normal. So a few days after the Southward Advance Plan was announced, Joint Logistics also secretly held a small meeting..."
This text appeared in my *interrupted* thought process when I was checking 2402. It is indeed from 2405. I must ensure I don't accidentally write it into 2402.

Ready to write 2402.
