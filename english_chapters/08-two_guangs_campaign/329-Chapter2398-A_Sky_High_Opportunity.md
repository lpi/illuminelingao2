# Chapter 2398: A Sky-High Opportunity

This "Ming-Australian" hybrid decoration style was now quite popular among Guangzhou merchants who dealt with the Australians, used to signal that their relationship with the Australians was "not ordinary." However, it was Chu He's first time seeing it, and he found it quite novel. He couldn't help looking around and remarking:

"Your layout here is really distinctive!"

"New society, new atmosphere," Zhang Yu replied. "Chief, please drink tea." As he spoke, he went to get the Kung Fu tea tray.

When Hong Huangnan had done business in the past, he'd picked up the habit of drinking Kung Fu tea from Fujian merchants. In the new spacetime, ever since the Agricultural Committee had introduced "Limushan Oolong Tea," he'd gradually restored the Kung Fu tea set. Zhang Yu had followed suit and started drinking this "Australian Kung Fu Tea."

Seeing Zhang Yu bustling about to brew tea, Chu He waved his hand. "I can't drink that Oolong tea. Do you have simpler tea water?"

"Yes, yes," Zhang Yu hurried to say. "We have loose tea here, and also Kvass, all specially imported from Hainan Island..."

Seeing the Chief's lack of interest, Zhang Yu suddenly thought of something and said, "Chief, you can try our family's new fruit tea. We currently have kumquat lemon and passion fruit. We use fresh jams and juices delivered daily. Many Chiefs have said it's good."

Chu He hadn't expected to find fruit tea here. Surprised, he asked, "Really? Alright, bring one cup of each flavor. Did you come up with this yourselves?"

Zhang Yu instructed a clerk to prepare it while saying, "It was a recipe given by Senator Zhang Xiaoqi. We just followed it—it's just that the jams and ingredients still need to be imported from Lingao. Chief Zhang said that in a few years, when the farms here are set up, local food factories can produce their own jam."

"With this channel, you're bound to make a fortune in the future. Open a fruit tea counter in the shop to sell alongside your dry pastries. Once you have brand recognition, you can sell it all over the streets. Guangzhou weather is hot; with ice cubes, it'll be cool and refreshing. Your wealth will roll in, tsk tsk..."

This idea was exactly what Zhang Xiaoqi had proposed—otherwise, Zhang Xiaoqi wouldn't have given him the recipe and allowed him to buy ingredients from special supply channels. But Zhang Yu put on a "suddenly enlightened" expression, beaming with joy as he said, "What the Chief says is true! Why didn't I think of that! This is an excellent way to make money!" He then put on a look of worship. "No wonder everyone says the Chiefs can turn stone to gold!"

This flattery struck just right, giving Chu He a surge of "Senatorial joy." Though he had to show some modesty, the smugness in his heart inevitably leaked out.

Seeing this, Zhang Yu felt more confident about handling what was coming next.

Watching the Senator drink the fruit tea and lean back against the rattan backrest, Zhang Yu knew the Senator was physically and mentally relaxed. It was a good time to talk, so he quickly asked, "I wonder how I should address the Chief?"

"Oh! My surname is Chu—Chu He."

"So it's Chief Chu!" Zhang Yu's heart tightened, because he'd learned of Chu He's "deeds" just yesterday.

The content he knew was very limited, including "explosive" news like Chu He making a scene at the City Hall, but he knew that Senator Chu was a rising "new star" in Guangzhou city. And he knew that Senator Chu had a close relationship with the newly established "Nanyang Company."

That Chu He had come to his small shop and specifically "sat down to talk" made Zhang Yu's heart constrict—a Senator's time was very precious. Even his great patron, Senator Hong, wouldn't sit down specifically to talk with him unless there was urgent business. Senator Chu had obviously come prepared. Could he be here to solicit share subscriptions?

Thinking of this, his heart instantly hung in suspense. Yet he dared not show a fraction of it, hurriedly saying:

"Hello, Chief Chu. Your face looks a bit unfamiliar; is this your first time in Guangzhou?"

"It's my first time." Chu He didn't care at all. "Originally I came on a business trip, but now it looks like I'll probably be stationed in Guangzhou long-term."

"Then you must have been promoted," Zhang Yu complimented.

"Where, where—it's all to serve the Senate and the people," Chu He said. "You're the boss of this Zhang's shop, right?"

"Yes, I'm the General Manager of Zhang's Food Company." Zhang Yu used this "Australian-style" title.

"I've long heard that your management is impressive and that you're a famous emerging enterprise in Guangzhou. I even saw military rations and pastries you produced in Jeju."

Zhang Yu quickly said, "This is all due to the Senate's promotion. My family was originally just a small brand in Guangzhou city, a business of three or four people. To have today is entirely thanks to the Senate's policies!"

Chu He had come today partly on a whim, but also with the intention of showing goodwill to Hong Huangnan. Undoubtedly, this Senator who controlled military logistics and practically managed actual supply affairs for all Senators and naturalized citizens in Guangdong was obviously "especially worth befriending."

Nanyang stocks and bonds were equivalent to "boat tickets" for the new government. Who could get them, and how many, contained benefits far greater than economic returns. The new nobility supported by the Senate would not fail to understand this principle. Hong Huangnan would certainly know the implications.

But as a dignified Senator, he couldn't hawk shares like an insurance salesman. So he beat around the bush and asked:

"How is the revenue situation of your Zhang's?"

Zhang Yu's heart shook: *As expected!*

Asking about revenue was nothing more than checking his bottom line to see how much financial power he had, so shares could be apportioned.

He dared not be reckless and hesitated for a moment before saying, "Thanks to the Senate's blessings, business is quite remarkable. Monthly sales are over a thousand. If not for the plague, and labor and raw materials failing to keep up, we could have done even more..."

"Sales over a thousand—that's over ten thousand a year. This turnover isn't small." Chu He came from a finance background and naturally understood the implications: not mentioning gross profit, not mentioning net profit, only stating sales volume, and an approximate imaginary number at that. Obviously, there were reservations.

Of course, leaving three points of leeway when speaking to strangers was normal. To put it bluntly, if he weren't a Senator, Zhang Yu would probably just laugh and say something vague like "business is pretty good."

From this, Zhang Yu seemed prudent in action and careful in speech; he possessed neither the arrogance typical of the nouveau riche nor the loss of wits and loose tongue that could come from seeing a Senator. Chu He's impression of him improved several notches.

"From your words, I suspect there are still difficulties in this business?"

Zhang Yu's heart tightened again. It seemed he couldn't dodge this. The other party's words were gentle and seemed to leave room for discussion. However, if he just sighed about his hardships now, it would be tantamount to a disguised refusal. Letting Senator Chu arrive in high spirits and leave disappointed would be highly inappropriate.

Zhang Yu stood up to refill Chu He's fruit tea, taking the opportunity to deliberate, then returned to his seat and said, "Our difficulties, compared to our peers, almost count as being pretentious! First, there's currently a shortage of manpower. Suitable workers are hard to find, and qualified stewards are even scarcer. It affects production; many orders are backed up and can't be fulfilled. It delays things!"

Chu He had been prepared to hear him talk about turnover difficulties and tight funds—for a company like Zhang's that had risen so explosively, capital turnover problems were normal. Otherwise, what were banks and investors for? He hadn't expected manpower difficulties to come first; there must be something behind this.

But since there was a "first," naturally there would be a "second." Let's hear him out.

"Second is capital turnover. I'm sure the Chief has already guessed..." Zhang Yu's expression grew difficult. "Orders have grown explosively, but our cash flow hasn't increased proportionally. We've had to continually borrow to expand. Right now, accounts payable to various suppliers total an alarming figure. Honestly, just getting through the New Year hurdle requires careful maneuvering..."

Chu He nodded, unsurprised. "Rapid growth always brings cash flow problems. This is quite normal."

"Yes, yes, Chief understands thoroughly." Zhang Yu paused, then continued, "Actually, Chief's visit today—I suspect you've come about the Nanyang Company matter?"

Chu He laughed. "You're quite perceptive! Indeed, I wanted to hear your thoughts. The Nanyang Company's stock and bond subscription is a major project for the Senate. As a key private enterprise supported by the Senate, your family naturally should participate. What do you think?"

Zhang Yu's heart sank, but his face remained composed. "Chief Chu is absolutely right. The Senate has given the Zhang family so much; supporting Senate projects is our duty. I... I certainly want to participate. It's just that right now, funds are truly tight..."

Chu He waved his hand. "I understand your situation. But consider this: participating in Nanyang Company isn't just about money—it's about standing with the Senate. The returns will far exceed what you put in. Think it over carefully."

Zhang Yu nodded vigorously. "Chief Chu's words are enlightening. I will definitely find a way to participate!"

"Good." Chu He stood up. "I should be going. Think about it and make a decision. If there are any difficulties, we can discuss solutions."

Coming downstairs, they saw Piao Zhixian seated like a lord in the shop, with mountains of small baskets and boxes piled before him. He was chomping on cookies while pointing at various products on display: "Two *jin* of this too! Correct! Not one less! I want them all!"
