# Chapter 2350: Old Friend Li Huamei (Part 2)

But now, Li Huamei had the protective talisman of Qi Feng. Without clear evidence of "acts harming the Senate," it was difficult to make a move against her.

In this predicament, Zhou Botao could only further strengthen surveillance. All persons in contact with her were listed on the monitoring list and checked one by one. Since Li Siya's lair was roughly identified, he also specially configured a group of people in Macao to monitor her whereabouts and letters.

Perhaps Li Siya had realized that Macao was no longer her safe zone. Not only did she live in seclusion in Macao, but many times she simply didn't stay in Macao but hid everywhere. For a while, they still couldn't grasp her specific whereabouts.

However, the monitoring in Macao brought them another harvest. Zhou Botao was surprised to find that Li Mo, the Chief of General Affairs at the Lingao General Hospital, actually had correspondence with Li Siya!

As everyone knew, the Lingao General Hospital was the most important hospital in the Senate's health system. It mainly served Senators and core naturalized employees, so the staff inside were all identified as the most reliable personnel.

The Chief of General Affairs in such a hospital actually had contact with Li Siya, the "Enemy of the Senate"! This not only piqued Zhou Botao's interest but also made him break out in a cold sweat.

He suddenly remembered that in 1632 he had handled a whistleblower report involving Li Mo. The content reported her abnormal behavior during a trip to Guangzhou. It didn't attract his attention at the time, but out of prudence, he asked Ke Yun to investigate.

Ke Yun investigated for several months, and the conclusion was "suspicious points, no evidence." The Political Security Bureau had few resources and couldn't invest strength in such a case with no obvious problems for a long time, so the case was closed at the end of that year. However, Li Mo was put on the "Level 3 Surveillance List" since then.

He instructed his secretary to immediately retrieve all the files of this case.

In the file, the weekly monitoring reports on Li Mo had piled up into a thick stack. Zhou Botao read through it carefully and didn't find anything juicy—if there were really any problems, Ke Yun would have restarted the case long ago. He read Ke Yun's original investigation report again; to be honest, there wasn't anything juicy either. The only thing that could be certain was that Li Mo likely connected with Li Siya during that trip to Guangzhou.

The file contained a copy of Li Mo's personal file. According to her own account, she was a "native of Gongchang Division, Xiangshan County, Guangzhou Prefecture." In the Ming Dynasty's administrative division, the location of Macao belonged exactly to Gongchang Division!

And according to her account, her former husband was also a pirate on the Guangdong seas—according to the intelligence they collected, Li Siya's Portuguese father was a "merchant" who did gray business with pirates...

From this perspective, Li Mo's relationship with Macao was not shallow, and it was not surprising that she had a special relationship with Li Siya.

Not digging up the root of this matter while the iron was hot back then was hidden danger after all. Zhou Botao thought, the key was that Li Mo was quite popular among the agricultural Senators. She also believed in Elder Wu's religion and was very close to this small Protestant church. So they were somewhat hesitant at the time and didn't take decisive action immediately.

He immediately sorted out the relevant situation and went to report to Zhao Manxiong.

Zhao Manxiong listened to his report with interest and carefully studied the materials he brought. He asked:
"How long have they been in contact?"

"Maybe two or three years. The specific start time is unknown. But judging from the context, I'm afraid they had already established contact before Li Huamei came to naturalize."

"But analyzing from the existing materials, Li Huamei and Li Mo have not had any lateral contact—this girl even understands single-line contact; she's really an interesting character," Zhao Manxiong said. "From the letters, what is the relationship between them? What is the main content of the letters?"

"The letters are not written in code," Zhou Botao said. "At first, I was very surprised, thinking there was secret writing or some code, but after handing them to the relevant department, they concluded there was no secretly transmitted information; they were just ordinary letters."

Zhao Manxiong nodded: "Is there anything in the letters we are interested in?"

"To be honest, no." Zhou Botao smiled bitterly. "Most of it is about domestic trivia. The frequency of correspondence between Li Siya and Li Mo is very low, far less than Li Huamei's; there is only one letter about every six months. The content is very long, but mostly domestic trivia."

Besides the usual greetings, the letters also contained various requests: Li Mo asked Li Siya to buy certain things in Macao and Guangzhou, and sometimes the other way around. The letters also mentioned gifts attached... Anyone reading them would see the common content between relatives and friends.

"However, there is one rather unusual detail."

"What?" Zhao Manxiong became interested.

"The forms of address between them: Li Siya calls Li Mo 'Sister,' while Li Mo calls Li Siya 'Miss.' The writing is respectful, obviously the attitude towards a superior."

Li Siya called Li Mo sister, but Li Mo dared not call Li Siya sister, using "Miss" instead. This clearly meant she was half a head shorter than the other party.

This form of address, with obvious class difference yet carrying a kinship surpassing the master-servant relationship, was confusing for a moment.

"The relationship between them might be special," Zhao Manxiong said. "When Yu Eshui gave us a lecture, he specifically said that ordinary people in the Ming Dynasty could not keep slaves. Some kept slaves in the name of 'adopted sons' and 'adopted daughters,' who were actually bondservants. Li Mo probably has this kind of semi-bondservant status."

"That's possible. In the letters, they also frequently mentioned a person named 'Sister Chun,' whom Li Mo calls 'Little Chun.' From the context, she is Li Huamei—that is, Li Chun. And we already know that Li Chun is not Li Siya's biological sister. The only possibility is that Li Mo and Li Chun are biological sisters. Because Li Mo mentioned her in every letter, very concerned about her whereabouts and safety."

"How did Li Siya answer her?"

"Most of the time, Li Siya made excuses saying she hadn't seen her for a long time or wasn't clear, only saying she was out sailing for business, and guaranteed Li Mo it wasn't some shady, dangerous business. She never mentioned who 'Sister Chun' was doing business with. However, sometimes she would pass on some of 'Sister Chun's' gifts to Li Mo, and also passed on letters—unfortunately, we didn't intercept the letters."

"So, Li Siya doesn't want the Li sisters to meet." Zhao Manxiong thought, obviously, only by keeping them unaware of each other's whereabouts could she threaten and control them. Although the Li sisters were both in Lingao, they had all changed their names. Li Mo worked in general affairs at the Lingao General Hospital for a long time, living a secluded life in both work and daily living; while Li Huamei actually spent very little time in Lingao, sailing outside for at least half a year. Moreover, her activity trajectory in Lingao was basically in the coastal areas around Bopu.

This woman Li Siya was really quite meticulous in her thinking. No wonder she could survive at sea until now and still maneuver. It had been so many years!

"Yes. Now Li Siya probably relies on Li Huamei for a large part of her income. This is also the reason why she wants to firmly control 'Sister Chun'."

Zhou Botao secretly investigated Li Huamei's trade operations. He also managed to get the operation status of Li Siya's ships through connections in Macao. The conclusion was that among the goods currently sold by the two Lis, the proportion of Australian goods exceeded 50%. And the source of Australian goods was mostly purchased through Li Huamei's channel, which had much more advantages in price and variety compared to other indigenous wholesale channels.

In other words, the Senate was continuously creating profits for Li Siya. Zhou Botao consulted the materials of the Southeast Asia Company and found that since Li Huamei joined the Southeast Asia Company, her annual sales calculated by tonnage were always in the top ten.

"It seems our practice of mercantilism is very thorough." Zhao Manxiong commented, "What is Li Siya doing now?"

"According to Lando's report, she often went to the Philippines before we crushed the Zheng Zhilong group. The Spanish are her traditional customers. She is also a secret messenger between Macao and the Spanish. She also has contact with the Dutch and the British—I estimate she acts as a mixture of broker, mercenary, or intelligence peddler. Of course, there is also her main profession of trade and piracy."

Zhao Manxiong pondered for a moment and asked, "What is the current living state between her and Qi Feng? I remember the report said they were already cohabiting."

"Their cohabitation location is in the 'Commercial District,' which is..."

"I know this place."

"The house was built with Li Huamei's money, and the property rights are also hers. It is said that Qi Feng did the design. As long as Qi Feng is not on a business trip or in a meeting, he will live there—he also brought his maid over, as well as many personal belongings. I think this basically counts as moving." Speaking of this, he suddenly remembered something, "By the way, our informant also reported that Li Huamei built a secret cellar in this house. It is likely prepared to hide some valuable items."

"Do you think Li Huamei is good-looking?" Zhao Manxiong suddenly asked.

"This... if talking about looks, her contours are quite good," Zhou Botao didn't expect the Director to ask such a question and answered somewhat hastily.

"If according to the maid selection rating standard issued by the General Office, she is at the C-level standard. But you have to admit, such a woman has a different kind of charm, and this charm is rarely seen in this spacetime. So Comrade Qi Feng has true love for her... this makes it quite tricky."

Zhou Botao understood Zhao Manxiong's meaning. Since it was true love, and Qi Feng was from an art background and had romantic sentiments, it was very possible to create a melodrama plot like "No matter who she is, even if the whole world is against us! I will love her to the end!"
