# Chapter 2195 - Two Magistrates

Only after entering the county seat did Huang Chao realize that the intelligence about Yangshan County not falling was discounted. To be precise, the Yao armed forces had already broken the city. The officials, soldiers, and some commoners in the city withdrew into the Battalion City of the Battalion Office to continue resistance. Although the population loss wasn't large, the wealth in the city was basically completely lost. After the Yao armed forces rushed into the county seat, they didn't even spare a basket; everything was robbed.

At this moment, the officials and gentry in the county no longer had the shyness of "following thieves" when they were forced to surrender. They almost hugged Huang Chao's thigh calling him "Benefactor." Especially the newly arrived Magistrate Zhou Liangchen, whose eyes were filled with tears—his speculation finally didn't fail!

There wasn't a single naturalized citizen in Yangshan County seat. Although this place had surrendered to "Great Song," in reality Wen Desi hadn't had time to send cadres here yet. Only a few temporary appointment letters were sent by the messenger who came to recruit surrender. The surrendered officials filled in their names themselves, and it counted as taking the post.

Although the title changed, everything in the county remained as before: holding court to try cases, urging levies and collecting grain. The Magistrate and officials didn't know what Great Song's specific uniform system was either, only knowing that Australians all had short hair and short clothes—but no one in the county had this craft. So they still wore round-collar robes and gauze caps to hold court and handle affairs. Just to show the difference between new and old, the rank badges on the front and back of the official robes were removed.

Huang Chao looked at this magistrate who had removed his rank badges, feeling quite absurd. But seeing his robe full of scorch marks and dust, and torn in several places, presumably his days hadn't been easy recently.

Regardless of how he was as an official or person, at least he held Yangshan County seat and pinned down the Yao forces. For the Senate, it was still a great merit. Immediately, he comforted everyone with gentle words and praised them all.

"Chief praises too much; the subordinate was just fulfilling duty faithfully." Zhou Liangchen bent his waist so low his head almost touched the square bricks. "Great Song Celestial Troops were swift, sweeping the den with thunder, cleansing the crowd of ugliness. Only then were the people of the whole city preserved..."

He spoke these grateful words sincerely because if the Australians hadn't come, he, Zhou Liangchen, would mostly likely have died for this Great Song coming from who knows where.

"No need to say polite words," Huang Chao said. "How is the situation in the city now?"

Zhou Liangchen dared not neglect and hurriedly introduced the current situation in the city. Currently, there were about a thousand officials, soldiers, gentry and commoners in the city, many of whom fled from neighboring villages. There were about four hundred able-bodied men.

"What about grain?"

"Money and grain are almost gone, all looted by Yao barbarians. Only the Battalion City still has a little stored grain..." Saying this, he glared fiercely at a middle-aged man beside him, thinking: *You got off cheap!*

Huang Chao wondered secretly, thinking *what act is this?*

Among the surrendered officials and soldiers in the county, except for a few who fled before the Yao chaos broke out, almost every official in the county seat was present—petty clerks were mostly locals with nowhere to flee; officials were blocked on the road and dared not flee outside. So Yangshan County's team was particularly complete; even the former Magistrate Peng Shouan was there.

Under his introduction, Huang Chao learned that the middle-aged scholar glared at by him was Peng Shouan. *No wonder he looks dusty and disgraced with a face full of bad luck—originally landed safely, now 'following thieves.' He looks like he is unwilling.*

Finally, there were several officers of the local Guard Battalion. Although the Guard Battalion was lax, because of the local "Yao Situation," the officers of the Guard Battalion were still relatively decent and had a dozen or so capable personal soldiers. In fact, Yangshan holding out relied entirely on the core of these few officers and their personal soldiers, these few dozen people.

"Everyone has worked hard in defense. Go back to your homes to rest for a few days—if there are things to account for, just speak to the cadres under me. Those with difficulties don't need to be afraid of anything; just speak up. What can be solved, I will definitely help." He glanced at the officials below. "I also have a few ugly words here. Now that chaos and bandits are everywhere, everyone lives in the same city; you should only have the thought of helping each other in the same boat, don't have other thoughts. My Great Song has always stressed voluntariness in everything. If you are unwilling to be officials or citizens under Great Song rule, when the Yao chaos is pacified and roads are open, we will naturally send you out of the border with courtesy. But if anyone plays tricks in secret during this time, don't blame me for being impolite."

Immediately, the group hurriedly expressed loyalty, stating they would absolutely not do anything betraying the inside for the outside.

To show his "special loyalty," Zhou Liangchen bowed and came out saying: "Since the subordinates have surrendered to Great Song, request the Superior to bestow robes and uniforms, so we can also shave hair and change clothes."

The atmosphere in the hall instantly became awkward. Everyone cursed this Zhou Liangchen as "shameless" in their hearts, but being under someone else's roof, no one dared to make a sound.

Huang Chao said: "This matter is not urgent. First, I came in a hurry and don't have so many uniforms; second, the Yao situation is urgent now, not the time to do these things. You just wear civilian clothes for now—no need to wear this gauze cap and round collar anymore."

"Yes, yes, many thanks to Lord for understanding." Zhou Liangchen originally just wanted to show sincerity. Whether the Senator agreed didn't matter to him—after all, keeping the hair bun left some room for maneuver in times of crisis.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Huang Chao then announced personnel orders. He called up several men and women with short clothes and short hair. Seeing their appearance, Zhou Liangchen knew they must be "Fake Hair"—rebellious people who joined the Hair thieves earlier.

"This is Wang Chuyi. The Senate has appointed him as the new County Head of Yangshan County." He introduced.

Wang Chuyi bowed slightly and introduced himself in not-too-standard Putonghua: "My name is Wang Chuyi. Thanks to the Senate's trust, I assume the post of local County Head. Hope to cooperate happily with you all in future work!"

The group below hurriedly offered flattery. Zhou Liangchen was quite lost. He thought since he took the initiative to surrender to the Hair and had the credit of maintaining the county seat, this Magistrate under Great Song rule should be done by him no matter what. Unexpectedly, it was given to a mud-legged person—judging by the name. However, he didn't show any expression on his face, complimenting him extremely.

Peng Shouan felt secretly comfortable inside—he could have escaped earlier, but was entangled by this Zhou Liangchen and trapped here alive, ending up with the reputation of following thieves!

Wang Chuyi continued to read an appointment letter in extremely non-standard Mandarin. Since Zhou Liangchen just arrived in Yangshan to take office and wasn't familiar with county affairs, but had merit in offering and protecting the city, he was appointed as the Director of the General Office of Yangshan County. Zhou Liangchen was very unhappy. Although he didn't know what this General Office meant, he vaguely knew this official position was roughly meant to assist the County Head. So he dropped from the status of Magistrate to County Deputy Magistrate all at once.

The other surrendered officials also had their own appointments; anyway, they were all official titles never heard of. For surrendered Guangdong local officials, theoretically, they should be sent to Guangzhou for screening and "re-education" instead of being arranged for positions locally. But the situation was special now, so Yangshan counted as a special case handled specially.

Finally, it was Peng Shouan's turn—he was appointed as "Chief Advisor" of the Yangshan County Government.

Peng Shouan didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He had already left office. If not for Zhou Liangchen, he might be on the way back to his hometown by now. Now it was great; he was stuck between advancing and retreating. Not accepting this "puppet position" was absolutely impossible—he didn't plan to die in the line of duty; accepting it, the crime of "surrender" would be terrible. Thinking over and over, saving his small life was most important. *As long as the green hills remain, even if there's no firewood, it's fine.* He expressed "deference is better than obedience." Fortunately, he had already handed over the seal and hadn't received papers from the Ministry of Personnel; theoretically, he was no longer an official. He didn't have to wear the biggest charge of "official defending soil surrendering to the enemy."

Although Wang Chuyi was a "mud-legged person" looked down upon by surrendered officials, he did things very methodically. On one hand, he arranged people to take over granaries and city defenses; on the other hand, he conscripted able-bodied men to repair city walls. He also asked gentry and commoners who fled into the city to announce everywhere: Great Song Celestial Troops have arrived at the county seat and will suppress the Yao chaos soon, asking all village stockades to "guard carefully." At the same time, he levied "Reasonable Burdens" on big households and gentry... While the group of surrendered officials were surprised, they were also secretly lost. *Where did this mud-legged person learn this way of governance!* However, everyone dared not show this emotion, so they had to brace themselves to handle errands—regardless of what heresy this Great Song practiced, suppressing the Yao chaos and preserving their own lives and property were important.

In comparison, Peng Shouan was much freer. He was very depressed inside. He originally thought he could finish this term safely, then take the gold, silver, and soft goods scraped over these years back to his hometown in Putian County, Fujian, to be a gentry in the countryside safely and steadily. Yangshan was a poor county without much flat and fertile land, surrounded by mountains. Peng Shouan scraped for oil and water desperately, yet only saved less than two thousand taels of silver in a few years. Peng Shouan had a principle: seek wealth but don't harm lives. As long as no human life was involved, he would respond to whatever those local tyrants and evil gentry asked him to do, as long as filial silver came over.

Moreover, Peng Shouan considered himself to have a conscience. He had also donated funds to repair the city wall collapsed by floods before, and donated to the county's militia. He prided himself on being a "good official." Originally, he had the heart to look for opportunities to see if he could transfer to a good vacancy. However, the situation in recent years was bad, and even Guangdong, which had always been calm, was no exception.

Years ago, the Hair thieves occupied Qiongzhou as bandits. Governor of Liangguang Wang Zunde raised an army to suppress them, but ended up with the whole army annihilated. The Hair thieves' warships sailed straight to the foot of Guangzhou City. The news coming from his hometown later surprised him even more: Zheng Zhilong, the Great Sea Lord who dominated the Fujian and Zhejiang coast, was defeated by this group of Hair thieves overnight, and Zheng Zhilong also ended up with his head separated from his body.

Since the Hair thieves occupied Qiongzhou and repeatedly invaded Guangzhou, they must have designs on Guangdong in the future. This made his enthusiasm for being an official much lower. To say he could be selected to a comfortable nest like Jiangnan was impossible given his ability. If it were other places, whether Lianghu, Jiangxi, or Shandong, Guanzhong, Heluo... roaming bandits filled the roads everywhere, and natural and man-made disasters never ceased. Going to be a magistrate, the two errands of levying grain and pacification would be extremely difficult to handle. So he had the thought of resigning and returning to his hometown. Anyway, having been an official for more than ten years, he had accumulated tens of thousands of taels of silver; going back to be a rich man wasn't impossible.
