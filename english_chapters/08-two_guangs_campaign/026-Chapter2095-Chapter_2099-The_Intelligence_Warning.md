# Chapter 2095 - The Intelligence Warning

Of the Pearl River's three major tributary systems, the West River system had the largest watershed and most branches. Most rivers within Guangxi were tributaries or main channels of the West River system, so controlling the West River meant controlling Guangxi. Of course, to control the vast West River system, the Pearl River Task Force's Western Detachment's size was far from sufficient; for now, they could only settle for holding Wuzhou, this key point for waterway traffic.

Originally, Schneider had hoped that "one barrage of cannon fire and one charge" would take Wuzhou—they'd fought plenty of such sieges along the way. But looking at the current situation, the Ming had learned from their defeats. They absolutely refused to come out for "open battle," let alone the suicidal folly of "naval combat."

This meant combat would settle into the tedious routine of "building fortifications," "positioning guns," and "fire attacks." The Navy's main job at Wuzhou would be providing fire support.

Throughout the day, the First Brigade and Western Detachment busied themselves below Wuzhou's walls: constructing fieldworks, requisitioning supplies, preparing for the siege. The Navy towed six bombardment boats into position before the city, their 280mm mortars having proven highly effective during the Pearl River estuary breakthrough campaign. Though the 280mm mortar's explosive shells contained only high-density black powder, their destructive power was enough to demolish most of this era's defensive fortifications. Even if they didn't destroy them outright, the violent explosions and shrapnel would shake and rout the defenders.

Meanwhile, the Ming were also busy on the walls. First Brigade reconnaissance troops infiltrated the hills around Wuzhou and used telescopes to observe the city interior. They noted the Ming's activity wasn't about reinforcing defenses—it looked more like they were moving something. Masses of straw sacks were being carried to the city gates, apparently to block them.

Thus both sides spent a busy day. By nightfall, both Fubo Army and Ming had lit large bonfires, guarding against enemy night raids.

At midnight, the captain of Boat 42, Ensign Cao Dachuan, was awakened by his sailors. Bleary-eyed, he muttered: "What's happening?" The sailor couldn't explain clearly, only saying: "The lights on Wuzhou's south wall keep flickering—something's odd." Cao Dachuan thought it was something serious. Woken up, his temper flared and he was about to scold the sailors—but remembering they were green recruits only recently assigned to him, he swallowed his irritation.

"It's just lights—what's the fuss?"

"That lamp is blinking on and off, like someone's sending light signals."

"Pattern?" Out of caution, Cao Dachuan scrambled up, threw on his uniform, and climbed from the hold to the deck. Following the sentry's directions, he did indeed see flickering points of light on the wall.

One look told him everything. Cao Dachuan instantly understood what that blinking light meant: flash-dark-dark, flash-flash-flash, dark-dark-dark, flash-flash-flash-flash... Wasn't this lamp signaling?

In naval operations at sea, ships communicated with each other: by day, semaphore flags; at night or in bad weather, lamp signals. For Navy personnel, this was elementary.

This communication system had been part of his training at the Officers' Training Unit. Whether semaphore or lamp signals, they used the telegraph code system.

But this system was fairly specialized. For most Navy sailors—basically illiterate before enlisting, barely earning their C-grade diploma through military literacy programs—this was just "common knowledge." Actually mastering it required specialized signal training.

Signal duty wasn't something an ordinary C-diploma holder could do; signalmen were considered a "technical specialty" in the Navy. On his small gunboat, besides himself, only the signalman understood lamp signals.

The Ming couldn't possibly know Morse code. Whoever was sending this lamp signal had to be one of their own people.

*Someone inside the city is signaling us!*

This wasn't surprising in itself. Officers planting informants or arranging contacts inside enemy cities was routine. Along the way, he'd seen plenty of local "collaborators" rising up. Having such contacts in Wuzhou wasn't strange. These matters weren't his concern; someone else handled them.

"Don't worry—must be one of ours..." Cao Dachuan started to say, then suddenly noticed the sender was using plaintext!

Flash-dark-dark was "w"; flash-flash-flash was "o"; dark-dark-dark was "s"; flash-flash-flash-flash was "h"...

Strung together: *woshigulangqinghuihua*.

Obviously Pinyin romanization. The message was clearly: "I am Lone Wolf. Please respond!"

What "Lone Wolf" meant he didn't know, but four words floated instantly into his mind: *This is urgent.*

Cao Dachuan's training told him that covert operatives sending signals used encryption; only someone with the corresponding codebook could decode them. Navy ships communicating with each other didn't encrypt, but only Navy signalmen and officers could read those signals.

This plaintext message meant the sender had no specific recipient—it was broadcast to the entire Fubo Army. The sender could only hope someone would see and understand the signal.

This was no trivial matter. Was this signal genuine or fake? Why was it being sent at night from the city wall? What was the purpose? All questions. But Cao Dachuan knew none of this was for him to worry about.

He ordered his men to signal the *Zhujiang*: he needed to report an important matter to his superiors immediately. The signal was acknowledged; Cao Dachuan's request was approved. So Cao Dachuan, lantern in hand, boarded a small boat rowed by a sailor and headed straight for the *Zhujiang*.

He reported the matter to the duty officer at the *Zhujiang's* command section. The duty officer felt the situation was serious and immediately reported to Schneider.

"Really?" Schneider, just awakened, looked bewildered. "I don't understand this either—better report to the Brigade Staff Intelligence Section and see what they say."

So the news traveled to the First Brigade headquarters on Changzhou Island. The duty staff officer quickly roused the number-one figure sleeping aboard the *Zhujiang*: Naval Intelligence Staff Officer, Elder Xu Ke.

Xu Ke had only arrived at Wuzhou that evening. After days on boats, he'd been so exhausted upon landing that he'd skipped dinner and gone straight to an empty cabin to sleep. Being suddenly awakened naturally infuriated him, but the news turned his anger to delight. Ignoring proper Naval dress uniform, he ran to the signal deck in his shorts.

Xu Ke's mission, assigned by Jiang Shan, was to proceed to Wuzhou and oversee intelligence operations for the Guangxi theater, preparing for the next phase of the Guangxi offensive. The External Intelligence Bureau's network in Guangxi was sparse—only a few agents in key prefectural cities. These agents, due to distance, had infrequent contact and mostly operated in semi-dormant status. "Activating" them quickly was Xu Ke's main purpose.

He knew there were intelligence operatives inside Wuzhou, though he didn't expect much from them. For one, these operatives were "long-term sleepers" focused on routine political and economic intelligence gathering, not network expansion—unlike Zhaoqing, which had developed secret organizations of dozens or even hundreds who could coordinate and "open the gates." Once the city gates closed, the agents were completely useless. The Bureau's instructions had been for them to "lie low and preserve themselves."

Now an agent inside the city was suddenly signaling—obviously urgent intelligence. Otherwise they wouldn't take such a risk.

So Xu Ke ordered a lamp signal reply: "This is the Center. Message received!"

The other side had obviously received the signal, but replied with a cryptic sentence: "Spy inside the city! Ambush prepared!"

This was rather baffling. They immediately signaled back: "Details."

Luo Yangming had spent half the night atop Nanxun Gate tower. Using the lamp's cover to make it blink in Morse code, he finally got a response. Using this method to transmit intelligence, Luo Yangming had given himself only a fifty-fifty chance—it was largely a gamble. He had no other channel to relay his urgent intelligence.
