# Chapter 2302 - The Watch is Struck

The night grew darker. The sound of the watchman's clapper rang out; it was time to strike the first watch. In the fields outside Wuzhou city, a small detachment moved quietly toward the city.

This small team was dressed entirely in black, their faces smeared with pot soot—indistinguishable from the bandits active in the countryside. Such small bands were a common sight; the village braves in the areas they passed were accustomed to them. As long as there were no hostile actions near the villages, no one would raise an alarm at night.

This team was Song Ming's men. According to the prior arrangement, he had set out with his troops at nightfall from their daytime hiding spot in the mountains, pouncing straight for Wuzhou.

According to the plan, Jiang Suo would lead the insiders to receive him on the city wall—at the most secluded location, the Great Cloud Gate neighborhood. This area had been heavily bombarded by artillery during the Australian attack on Wuzhou, causing severe damage to the walls. Although Xie Erren had later organized refugees and able-bodied men to repair the walls, basically restoring their integrity, the original watchtowers, guard shelters, bastions, parapets, and battlements remained largely unrepaired or were fixed very sloppily. The repairs at some large breaches had not reached the original height, and the north-facing wall only had a moat below it; traversing the moat or climbing the wall was relatively easier there.

Most critically, Yi Haoran and the others had scouting information from within the city: the defensive strength at the Great Cloud Gate was the weakest. It had originally been garrisoned by the Second Squadron. After the Second Squadron departed to receive the boat convoy, the responsibility for security fell to a single squad of the Volte Army and a small team from the Detective Team—less than fifty men in total. At night, the garrison strength here was halved.

This scanty alert force was concentrated at the Great Cloud Gate and its immediate surroundings. The sections of the wall between the various gates were basically unmanned, patrolled only by roving sentries and scheduled patrols. As long as one moved quickly and had a bit of luck, one could easily surmount the wall without being discovered.

At this moment, on the wall between the Great Cloud Gate and the Yangming Gate, two roving sentries from the Detective Team were on patrol. They were both routed Ming soldiers who had been taken in around the time of the Wuzhou campaign. They had been placed in the Detective Team to do odd jobs and earn a meal.

Wang Ken and Mai Dang had been in the army for a long time. Although they did not share a surname, they hit it off and became sworn brothers. After being reorganized by the Australians, they served together.

The pay in the Detective Team was meager—just enough to eat. Determining they were unwilling to accept this, the two naturally harbored thoughts of "making a big score" and then fleeing.

Old soldier ruffians with such thoughts naturally could not escape Yi Haoran's keen eyes. Through Jiang Suo and others, he tested them several times and, deeming them usable, lured the pair aboard with the fragrant bait of "capture and behead the True Kuns, achieve extraordinary merit."

Yi Haoran had not developed many internal lines within the city. Although Gou Er had provided him with many potential contacts among the former Ming remnants in the city, he was extremely cautious. Since ancient times, most conspiracies failed due to internal betrayal. The more people pulled into a plot, the greater the likelihood of leaking secrets.

Therefore, after joining the group, Yi Haoran established the premise of only recruiting people in key positions, ignoring general personnel who were inconsequential.

Because Wang Ken and Mai Dang were long stationed at the Great Cloud Gate, they were key figures. Early this morning, they received word: the move would be made today, and they were to facilitate it during their night patrol.

On ordinary days, when the Second Squadron was garrisoned around the Great Cloud Gate, the night roving sentries consisted of one National Army soldier paired with one from the Detective Team. To coordinate, one would either have to drag the National Army soldier into the water or kill him halfway. Both carried significant risks. By comparison, tonight presented no difficulties.

Due to the shortage of manpower, the Detective Team not only had to patrol alone, but the length of their patrol route had also increased, making the probability of discovery even lower.

Seeing that the city watch had struck the second watch, third point, the two exchanged a glance and raised their lanterns high to expose the bastion, repeating this three times. This was the signal for reception.

According to the agreement: they would signal starting at the second watch, second point. If there was no response, they would repeat it after one point. If there was no response after three consecutive attempts, the matter would be considered off.

Shortly after the signal was sent, the sound of frogs croaking came from below the wall: three fast, three slow, and finally three fast again.

The two exchanged glances—they were here! Immediately, Wang Ken raised the lantern again to confirm receipt. Mai Dang took out several bundles of rope buried in a pile of defensive supplies nearby, tied them to the battlements, and threw them down.

Moments later, two men in black carrying swords and shields climbed up through the crenels. Without conversation, the men on the wall lowered the ropes, rappelled down the city wall, and quickly vanished into the streets below.

The two watchers were secretly alarmed: What kind of troops were these? To be so intrepid! While they were wondering, the last person to climb the wall beckoned and whispered, "You, come here!"

The two were terrified and hurried over, bowing and scraping involuntarily: "Greetings, Master..."

"You guard this place. In a while, chaos will break out in the city—don't be afraid, just wait quietly. No one will come here!" After saying these few sentences, he leaped agilely, grabbed the rope, and slid down.

Several hours earlier.

"Are these the opera chests from the Three Generals' Office?" Liu Youwang watched as strong laborers, under Chang Qingyun's direction, carried in eight large chests.

"Precisely!" Chang Qingyun laughed. "Master, your words to Chief Xie got the job done!"

Liu Youwang stuck out his belly, smiling beamingly. "Not bad, not bad. Quickly, carry the chests to the back. I want to take a careful look in a while to see what tricks they hold!"

He felt excellent today. Not only had he cajoled Chief Xie into promising him the opera chests with some sweet talk, but the Chief also seemed to have a favorable impression of him. A few opera chests were nothing, just toys for amusement. But the Chief's high regard was rare to come by! Over the years, he had served under several Chiefs. None had given him a good face. He had seniority, yet his position never rose; even relying on tenure, he was several notches below others.

This had always rankled him. He hadn't expected to prosper in this prison warden job! Not only did he enjoy endless wine, women, and wealth, but he had also raked in a lot of goods. What pleased him most was that he had acquired such a good advisor as Chang Qingyun!

In the past, he had no fondness for advisors, thinking them merely scholars full of bad water who gave ideas to officials. But once he really used one, he discovered it was wonderful—truly too useful! Compared to those "training classes" he had attended that made him doze off, this advisor was what really worked. He spoke pleasantly and was truly a talent!

It seemed the Australians overestimated themselves; for some things, the Great Ming's methods were still better.

Chang Qingyun, however, said, "Master, you'd better not go look..."

"Oh? Why is that?"

"These opera chests have been sitting idle for decades. Although they looked intact on the outside when moved, the condition inside is unknown. These decades-old things, stored in a large warehouse for so long, might harbor some evil spirits," Chang Qingyun said solemnly. "Let me send someone to fetch women's chamber pots and menstrual cloths to perform a ritual to break it..."

Liu Youwang laughed loudly, "Old Chang, you really can bullshit! There are no evil spirits in this world. We of the Senate do not believe in this..."

Chang Qingyun insisted, "Better to believe it exists than to believe it doesn't. You are an official, Master. If you clash with something, it might hinder your official fortune."

The phrase "hinder official fortune" touched Liu Youwang. He had been hopeless of promotion for years and had many thoughts in his heart. Now that there was some hope, there was indeed no need to fight over this moment—what if there really were evil spirits?

"Fine then, I'll leave this to you. Let me know when it's done!"

"More than just letting you know," Chang Qingyun laughed. "Once these items are in hand and the ritual is done, we'll take out the costumes and headgear and have the troupe sing a few plays tonight—they've rehearsed several times; finally, they won't have to sing a cappella."

"This... isn't very appropriate," Liu Youwang said. "The grain fleet arrives tomorrow. If we sing opera with great fanfare, it won't sound good if word gets out..."

In truth, his heart was itching terribly, unable to hold back.

"The grain fleet business has nothing to do with you, Master. Besides, I have another plan. Tomorrow, when the grain fleet finishes unloading, you go see Director Xie and say this is a great joyous event for the people of Wuzhou, and it would be better to set up a stage in the city for the opera troupe to perform and celebrate..."

"That could work!" Liu Youwang thought. This Advisor Chang was truly formidable; changing the phrasing made it completely different. But he still didn't understand:
"But that's a matter for tomorrow..."

"If we are to perform opera tomorrow, must we not have a dress rehearsal today?"

Liu Youwang laughed heartily. "Well said! Well said! Advisor Chang, you are truly a talent! Work hard with me, and when I strike it rich, I'll get you a cadre position too!"

"Many thanks for the Master's patronage!" Chang Qingyun accompanied the laugh. He hurried away.

He returned to the courtyard where the opera troupe was located. The opera chests were placed in the storehouse in the backyard. He quietly opened one of the chests. The chest was indeed piled with messy opera costumes and headgear, but underneath, it was stuffed full of gunpowder and sulfur. The eight chests were eight large bombs.

The gunpowder and sulfur had been secretly collected by Jiang Suo over these days—after the Battle of Wuzhou, there were quite a few firearms and gunpowder scattered outside. They had been swapped in on the way from the Three Generals' Office. The people carrying the chests this time were all their men.

Chang Qingyun took out all the costumes and headgear from inside and piled them on the table. He tore open the gunpowder packets and sprinkled them all over the chest—when the time came, throwing a torch on the chest would ignite it.

With all this tidied up, he locked the chest. He let out a sigh of relief.

He ordered men to carry the chests under the eaves of the corridor and set up the newly acquired menstrual cloths and chamber pots, counting it as performing the ritual. He also instructed that no one was allowed to touch or open the chests tonight.

Chang Qingyun returned to the front and saw several porters drinking water and wiping sweat. Several people exchanged glances. Chang Qingyun knew that everything in the Sanhezu camp was normal, just waiting to launch. At this moment, Liu Youwang's small kitchen was steaming and bustling with figures. They were probably cooking delicacies for his enjoyment tonight. He heard the sound of the watchman's clapper striking the first watch from the watchtower in the camp. The corner of his mouth smiled slightly; this would likely be Liu Youwang's last meal.
