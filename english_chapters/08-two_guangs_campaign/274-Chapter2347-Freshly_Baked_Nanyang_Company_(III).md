# Chapter 2347 - Freshly Baked Nanyang Company (III)

Brief delay is inadvisable; Nanyang Company has a thousand things waiting to be done. Logically should run a trip to Guangzhou immediately. But Guangzhou's Rat Plague epidemic hadn't been lifted yet; going to Guangzhou to raise shares at this moment was impossible.

He thought again and again, deciding to send a telegram to several Senators in Guangzhou, informing about Nanyang Company establishment and intention to come to Guangzhou for share raising first. Letting them also have a preparation. He knew nothing about Guangzhou, inevitably needing these people to lead way and introduce.

First telegram object naturally was Ai Zhixin; he was now Director of Guangzhou Finance and Tax Bureau, Number One in finance. To take money from Guangzhou must greet him. Second telegram sent to Meng Xian; wanting to raise shares, inevitably needing bank's support and cooperation. As for third one, was sent to Liu Xiang in Guangzhou—taking money on his one acre three cents land (turf), also had to greet.

Finishing drafting telegram handing to confidential clerk, Zhou Wei circled in an office on third floor of Customs Building.

This office was exactly where original Southeast Asia Company headquarters located. Ever since he collected key from General Office, he had been nestling here browsing Southeast Asia Company's operation archives.

Third floor of Customs Building all belonged to Southeast Asia Company headquarters, area wasn't small, but third floor was actually attic. Roof ridge highest point only 2.2 meters, roof eaves lowest point only 1.8 meters. With Zhou Wei's height staying inside was more or less somewhat stifled. Let alone temperature of top floor in summer.

*Must move company headquarters away before next summer.* Zhou Wei thought. *This place will definitely turn into large size steamer in summer.*

Southeast Asia Company headquarters set here, imaginable this company's status in Senate mind.

Its staff were also very few. Naturalized cadres and clerks working in headquarters were less than twenty people. Nominal Chairman was Liu Xiang. Of course actually Liu Xiang and his big family were living small days collecting dividends in manor in Sanya, only collecting some "Carriage and Horse Fee" here. Specific person in charge was naturalized General Manager.

Speaking of which shabby. Southeast Asia Company despite history not short, status in National Policy Enterprises wasn't high. According to rank only Second Class National Policy Company. Although Planning Academy held 51% shares, investment in Southeast Asia Company in these years was very little. Main assets were ships of various surrendering pirate leaders.

When Zhou Wei worked in Finance Sector he read Southeast Asia Company's financial report; commenting on its performance could only use "Mediocre" to describe. Although Southeast Asia Company theoretically was a large shipping-trading company, its majority business adopted "Affiliation Mode" (Gua Kao).

After various big and small leaders surrendered, they "invested" with ships, affiliated under Southeast Asia Company banner, uniformly hanging Senate Merchant Flag and "Nine Segment Flag", then according to routes they were familiar with, operating shipping and trade business themselves. Of course, their fleet scale was drastically reduced. Crew were also uniformly deployed by Southeast Asia Company, instead of composed completely by own family members, clansmen and fellow villagers in the past.

Naturally, this extensive operation mode couldn't bring too much profit. Although Southeast Asia Company's Affiliation Fee wasn't set low, all affiliates could share Southeast Asia Trade and Mainland Coastal Trade licenses. This was much cheaper than the price of 2000 Taels silver per flag in Zheng Zhilong era. And after company collected Affiliation Fee, bad sufficient force and consular protection ability for subordinate ships. Risk borne by ship owners reduced greatly.

Even if ship owners were too lazy to use brains on operation, solely undertaking shipping business could also guarantee sufficient profit every year. This shipping business came not only from Senate, but also from domestic and foreign merchants coming to Senate ruled area for purchasing.

Overall viewing, Southeast Asia Company profit limited, but foundation still not bad. At least not a mess. This more or less reassured Zhou Wei—because he hadn't seen Southeast Asia Company's detailed financial report for several years.

No wonder this company's headquarters only had such small scale. Looking at asset situation again. Different from his expectation, Southeast Asia Company didn't have many ships. This greatly exceeded his expectation. Because when pirate gangs surrendered, every shopkeeper (captain) had three or four ships at least, many like huge bands like Liu Xiang, ships could reach as three to five hundred. He roughly estimated, ships under Southeast Asia Company name, at least should be six seven hundred above.

However checking asset table today, discovered ships were far less than he imagined.

Currently ships "affiliated" under Southeast Asia Company name were only 225, among which 182 were hired by "China Merchants Bureau", operating mainland coastal freight and trade freight to Japan, Korea. Truly running on Southeast Asia routes were only 43 ships.

Where did so many ships fleeing over initially go now? Zhou Wei was somewhat puzzled. He found the General Manager.

Southeast Asia Company General Manager was Wang You who served as accountant under Zhu Cailao initially, later mixed with Zheng Bao. After Zheng Bao was annihilated, because he "abandoned darkness for light" timely. After purification assigned to Southeast Asia Company to take office.

He mixed in pirate bandit gangs for many years, knew pirate habits and thoughts very well. Mixing in pirate group for many years, could also speak most dialects in pirate group. Key was over long term he was only a "Advisor" identity, frankly speaking just mixing a mouthful of rice to eat. Had no too much common interest with real pirate leaders. So from start listed as "Key Cultivation Object". Wang You was also a person knowing interest and understanding current affairs, naturally also "Actively demanding progress". So very quickly obtained Senator trust. Promoted repeatedly over several years. Wait til Senate digested Southeast Asia Company pirates about enough, Senator no longer concurrently served as this company General Manager, Wang You sat on the throne of General Manager.

Zhou Wei taking office, this Wang You was somewhat uneasy. Not that he embezzled or took bribes etc—although Wang You wasn't flawless white jade in these years, didn't do anything excessive either, nothing more than exempting freight carrying some private goods reselling some non-controlled commodities.

What he worried more was what exactly it meant to suddenly re-appoint a Senator to arrive. Wang You knew, Senate didn't trust pirate surrenderers, especially pirates coming to surrender in groups in the past. Even more objects of key prevention and division. In the first few years of company establishment, he served under Senator, already witnessed various means of Senate dividing and disintegrating surrenderer forces. Now sudden re-appointment of Senator to be General Manager, even creating a "Nanyang Company", exactly what meaning?

*Could it be someone in Southeast Asia Company old surrenderers "plotted unruliness", having some people unknowing death plotting conspiracy in dark?*

Thinking of here, hair on back of Wang You's neck stood up. If this really happened, wouldn't it mean sudden big imprisonment! He served as General Manager in this Southeast Asia Company for several years, at least would get a charge of "Negligence of Duty", maybe capped with hat of "Accomplice" or "Tacit Connivance", then small life not guaranteed...

Hearing him ask about ship quantity matter, Wang You only then breathed a sigh of relief. Said: "Chief Zhou—"

"Call me General Manager."

"General Manager." Wang You hurriedly corrected, "This matter is like this..."

Turned out quantity of pirate ships surrendering to Senate was indeed very large. According to company receiving ledger, over years various pirate surrenderers hand over ships many hundreds, few one or two. Summarized up, total exceeded one thousand above.

But among this one thousand plus ships small ships occupied absolute majority, sixty percent above were single mast or double mast ships, small ships with load capacity only thirty forty tons. Such ships could also sail sea, but basically could only use on offshore coastal routes. Unable to go far sea. Even engaging in offshore shipping and trade was uneconomical.

So these small ships were eliminated very quickly. Remaining were all large medium ships.

"...General Manager probably doesn't know, quality of these ships mostly bad, many were Material Ships..."

"What is called Material Ship?"

"Our sea merchants over Fujian side, all cut wood to build ship one year before going to ocean, ship not particular either, no matter workmanship or material usage all sloppy, even wood is wet wood..."

"Going to Nanyang to do business, using inferior ship, not afraid of death? Even if he himself doesn't go to sea adventure, cargo drifting away (lost) is also loss." Zhou Wei was very strange.

"General Manager doesn't know, this kind of ship is all one-way. No matter go where. Arriving at locality then sell cargo. This ship is also demolished at locality selling as timber. After selling everything, take other sea ship back."

Zhou Wei was very puzzled about this. Shipbuilding was a high input investment. A good sea ship, cost could reach thousand taels silver, but once built, could use fifty years to hundred years. Why build this kind of "Disposable Ship"? Sea merchants weren't unable to afford this money. And since going to Nanyang trade every year, why spend effort to build new ship every year?

*This matter is really strange!* Zhou Wei thought. *But since sea merchants do so, definitely there are certain reasons behind.*

Wang You explained this kind of ship originally quality poor, drifting on sea for several years again, ship condition mostly very poor, so very quickly all eliminated.

Remaining, were all ships with larger tonnage, better ship condition. Actually among them some ships were new ships purchased in Hong Kong Shipyard by Southeast Asia Company shareholders and part of "Special Service Warships" eliminated from Navy. Ships truly brought by surrenderers weren't many.

"Speaking so, now ship condition of Southeast Asia Company fleet is relatively good."

"Yes." Wang You hurriedly nodded, "Operation rate is eighty percent above."

Zhou Wei thought, ships hired by China Merchants Bureau were mostly small medium ships, having no big use to himself. His main capital was those 63 ships running Nanyang.

"You make the ship owners of 63 ships currently running Nanyang route and their ship status, operation situation into a report—roughly need how many days?"

"Three four days time."

"I give you five days time." Zhou Wei looked at calendar, "Material must be as detailed as possible!"
