# Chapter 2328 - Going to Wuzhou (III)

"They are key witnesses; we should extract them and detain them separately. This is safer." Chen Baibin, thinking of Cai Lan who "committed suicide" inexplicably, suggested.

"No need for that. It's been more than half a month since the Wuzhou Incident; those who should die have long died. Those who remain are naturally those who shouldn't die." Ji Xin saw a tea set on the table, uncovered it to see tea already brewed, temperature just right. He poured tea for himself and Chen Baibin.

"Come, drink a cup of tea first."

"I'm not thirsty..."

"A cup of clear tea after a bath is best for relieving dryness and soothing the spirit, refreshing the internal organs. People like us who sit in offices and labor over paperwork benefit from drinking more." Ji Xin picked up the tea cup and took a shallow sip. This was West Lake Longjing specially supplied to Senators by the General Office's Shop No. 82. "Even if we detain them separately, where can we detain them? Who do we send to guard? We don't have a single 'trusted aide' here. Even those four new orderlies were transferred only after Xie Erren applied."

Chen Baibin was somewhat confused: "You mean..."

"If the superiors really thought the situation in Wuzhou was bad enough to require assigning a special task force to us, then naturally they would assign followers to us. But now, neither Ma Jia, nor Ran Yao, nor Director Xiong arranged accompanying personnel for us. Naturally, we don't need to worry about these things."

"Then what if there is a 'what if'?"

"If there really is a 'what if', it means this is a 'what if' approved by the Senate."

"Alright, although I don't quite understand."

"Baibin, you asked me on the boat what the Senate's 'official line' (mouth caliber) was, and I answered you there was no official line. However, as long as it involves a Senator's case, there must be an official line, only no one will tell you—you can only experience it yourself."

Ji Xin saw Chen Baibin silent, seemingly chewing on his words. He picked up the materials of the two prisoners prepared for arraignment tomorrow, ready to study them carefully.

Yi Haoran's resume interested him quite a bit. Such an intellectual with an ill fate, under the manipulation of the tide of the times, actually walked onto the path of being an enemy of the Senate, and in the end even came close to success. Such ability, if in the court of the Great Ming, probably wouldn't be inferior to those famous officials of the late Ming at all. Pity, let alone him being a mere scholar, even those high officials in the court couldn't break free from the laws of history...

He sighed for a while, then picked up the second document. This one was much thinner. As soon as the two words "Jiang Suo" entered his eyes, Ji Xin felt a long-lost familiarity, as if he had seen this name somewhere, but couldn't recall it. But this sense of familiarity could no longer be brushed away.

Looking at the confession of his own background on the material, it only said he was from Henan, drifted to Guangdong, joined the army and became Xiong Wencan's family retainer. Later promoted to squad leader.

Ji Xin had a strange feeling that this Jiang Suo seemed to have hidden something about his background.

Early the next morning, Ji Xin and Chen Baibin came to the county yamen and interrogated the detained Yi Haoran and Jiang Suo in the rear hall.

Yi Haoran was the "principal offender", naturally he was arraigned first.

Yi Haoran was brought to the rear hall, and according to Australian rules, locked in the interrogation chair.

Ji Xin saw his dark skin and wrinkles like knife carvings, knowing this person must have been running around outside for a long time, not a scholar who sat and talked about the Dao. However, his demeanor was elegant, and his gestures all demonstrated his calmness and composure. Obviously, he was a person who had experienced big scenes.

"You are Yi Haoran?" Ji Xin asked.

"It is this student."

"I've read your confession." Ji Xin said, "Is there anything that needs to be added or changed? If there are important hidden facts you can provide, when sentencing naturally the punishment can be reduced by one degree."

"Sin?" Yi Haoran smiled sarcastically, "I led officers and righteous people to risk death to recover Wuzhou. Now defeated and captured, what sin is there?"

Chen Baibin wanted to scold him, but Ji Xin waved his hand, not angry, and continued asking: "So, you have nothing else to say?"

"What needs to be said I have already said. What benefit is there in saying more?"

Seeing him holding tight to the confession, Ji Xin stopped entangling with his confession problem and turned to ask: "What is your relationship with Luo Yangming?"

"I worked as an accountant in his shop."

"You are a foreigner, with no shop or guarantor locally, and no relatives to turn to. Why would Luo Yangming employ you?"

"I am a distant relative of Jiang Qiuchan's husband's family. After Wuzhou city broke, I had nowhere to go, so I went to seek refuge with her. She then recommended me to the shop through Luo Yangming's wife."

"You are a person from Liaodong, how do you have relatives in Guangdong?"

"Just vine-tendril relatives from ancestors." Yi Haoran said, "Contact had long been cut off for years. Just that we still recognized this kinship. If not for having no way out, I wouldn't have saved my face to beg her."

Ji Xin asked again: "Since you were in distress in Wuzhou when the city broke, why did you have the idea of organizing a riot?"

"Under the whole heaven, is there any land that is not the King's territory of Great Ming. You bandit thieves stole the King's territory. Is it impermissible for this student to raise troops to recover it?"

"Mr. Yi, matters of great righteousness need not be said much. You and I each have our stance. I think you originally sought refuge with Jiang Qiuchan probably just to linger on in life, without the thought of rioting. Exactly why did you have this thought, and how did you organize it, tell it one by one!"

"Why this thought arose, and how it was organized, this student has stated clearly in the confession, without concealment."

Chen Baibin thought, *this old scholar is quite a chatterbox, turning over and over refusing to say a useful sentence, all things in the confession.*

Ji Xin didn't pursue further, just nodded slightly, and asked again: "What is your relationship with Cai Lan?"

"She is the fiancée of an old friend of mine, Xing Chenghuan." Yi Haoran answered calmly, "Wuzhou city broke, Mr. Xing died for the country. Cai Lan drifted here. I originally didn't know her, just one day on the street she saw my fan—the fan was painted by her fiancé."

"And then?"

"She asked my whereabouts and dwelling, and what I did for a living. Since exposed by her, this student didn't hide anymore, so I told her everything."

"You didn't ask what she did for a living at that time, and where she stayed?"

"Naturally I asked. She said after the city broke she was almost abducted and raped by villains, fortunately met the bandit soldiers who saved her. Pitying her for being lonely and helpless, and knowing she was literate, the bandits let her do odd jobs in the San Zong Fu."

"What job can she, a weak woman with bound feet, do?"

"This, the student doesn't know." Yi Haoran said.

"Since Cai Lan received the great grace of my Senate, why did she become your insider?"

"Great grace?" Yi Haoran smiled disdainfully, "If not for you, she and my old friend would be harmonious like qin and se (instruments), a deeply loving couple. Living a stable and happy life. How would she fall to the state of being abducted and raped by chaotic soldiers? This student provoked her with national hatred and family enmity, then made her an insider."

"Since she was an insider, what did she do?"

"Naturally the movements of the bandit thieves. Every few days she would tell the news to this student."

"She is a woman, how could she pass news with you?"

"Although she is a woman, bandit thieves have always slighted etiquette and law. The bandit female cadres in Wuzhou show their faces in public, considered not strange. What strange is there that she can enter and exit freely?"

"When you led people to rush into the county yamen and raided Senator Xie, was she the insider?"

"No. Cai Lan served in the San Zong Fu. Xie the Bandit lived and worked in the county yamen. How could she be an insider? Besides, for such a big matter, this student dared not entrust into the hands of a woman."

*This Yi Haoran cleaned Cai Lan quite thoroughly!* Ji Xin thought. This set of confession was obviously prepared by someone. Yi Haoran admitted all parts that couldn't be hidden, solely hiding the key point of the relationship between Cai Lan and Xie Erren.

Ji Xin asked some more questions. Yi Haoran answered fluently, fitting the confession seamlessly without flaws.

"...Take him down." Ji Xin ordered.

After the guards took Yi Haoran away, Chen Baibin asked puzzledly: "Director Ji, these are all things in the confession, why ask again?"

"Naturally to see if they match. Fake confessions are often accurate in general direction; asking more will reveal differences in details. Also to verify if our people told the truth."

"You mean Luo Yangming?"

"Luo Yangming wrote in the report how Yi Haoran lurked in the city. Now looking at it, there is basically no problem." He said, "There is another point, I don't know if you discovered the suspicion."

"Cai Lan."

"Correct." Ji Xin nodded, "In Yi Haoran's confession, Cai Lan is very unimportant. And he avoided the key thing: namely the relationship between Xie Erren and Cai Lan."

"Pity Cai Lan is already dead." Chen Baibin said with some regret. However, he noticed Ji Xin didn't have any regretful expression.

Ji Xin didn't immediately interrogate Jiang Suo, but called the local police chief Zheng Ergen. Asking him about Cai Lan's interrogation and death situation.

"After Cai Lan was arrested, she was detained in the Earth God Temple of the county yamen. Two female wardens guarded her specially. But before we could arraign her, she committed suicide..."

"The body?"

"After encoffinment, it is temporarily stored in the nunnery outside the city."

"How did she die? Was an autopsy performed?"

"Examined. But we don't have a forensic doctor here, it was the coroner of the local county who examined. The conclusion is hanging suicide." Zheng Ergen said, looking at Ji Xin, asked, "Chief, do you want to open the coffin and examine again..."

"No need, we didn't bring a forensic doctor this time." Ji Xin shook his head, and asked: "How was she discovered to be a spy?"

"It is said someone anonymously reported to Chief Xie. Chief Xie's security secretary personally went to arrest her."

Ji Xin remembered Xie Erren's report wrote: The security secretary died in battle on the night of the riot. And his office was also broken into by Ming troops that night. He himself led guards to resist fiercely in the office. According to the report, "gunshots and fire burning, heavy losses".

"It is said Cai Lan served the Senate in the San Zong Fu. Is there such a thing?" Ji Xin asked.

Zheng Ergen hesitated a bit, answered: "She indeed served in the San Zong Fu."
