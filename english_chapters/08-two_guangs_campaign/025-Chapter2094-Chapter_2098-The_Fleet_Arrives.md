# Chapter 2094 - The Fleet Arrives

Yang Yi had made up his mind: regardless of whether Wuzhou could hold, once chaos broke out in the city, he'd rob a few wealthy households and make himself a fortune amid the turmoil. Someone had already recruited him; they'd strike together once the city descended into chaos.

Thinking of this, Yang Yi felt quite pleased with himself, suddenly wishing the Australians would hurry up and attack so he could reap a windfall. But before he could close his eyelids, he saw several streaks of light arc across the southern sky—like shooting stars. The bright trails crossed over Wuzhou's south wall and plunged into the city.

Yang Yi gaped in confusion. Only after a moment did he realize: he'd heard that Australian rockets flew far and true. Years ago, Guangzhou had been struck by Australian rockets—the city had been set ablaze, devastation everywhere. Yang Yi frantically grabbed a conch horn and blew with all his might, then shouted toward the city interior:

"Enemy attack!"

At his roar, alarm gongs and drums thundered across the sky. Lanterns and torches flared everywhere amid panicked voices.

The Australians had finally come.

In the predawn darkness of April 12, under cover of night, Schneider led the Pearl River Advance Squadron's Western Detachment onto the West River waters south of Wuzhou. The squadron's vessels dropped anchor on the spot and launched a dozen or so Hale rockets to announce the Fubo Army's arrival. Several rockets set fire to boats moored at the docks outside the city, igniting blazing flames.

Though he couldn't see inside Wuzhou, the roaring fires along the riverbank were enough. Standing on the *Zhujiang's* deck, Schneider smiled with satisfaction: "Look at the big gift we've sent Governor Xiong!"

Ruan Xiaowu, by comparison, was much calmer. He asked: "Commander, shall we now engage the enemy naval forces at once, or rest here?"

Schneider considered: the Wuzhou Naval Battalion probably wasn't capable of fighting the Advance Squadron at night and wouldn't come out in the dark. So he said: "Signal all ships: all personnel except watch duty—rest."

"Yes, sir!" Ruan Xiaowu saluted.

"Remind all ships to prepare against night raids," Schneider added.

The *Zhujiang* then sent lamp signals to the other vessels. Crews took the opportunity to rest; tomorrow would bring heavy combat operations requiring full energy.

Zhu Mingxia had given Schneider three tasks: first, to destroy the Wuzhou Naval Battalion's fleet at the first opportunity and seize control of the river; second, to conduct fire reconnaissance of Wuzhou's defenses and assess their strength; third, to guide bombardment vessels into favorable positions to shell Wuzhou.

Wuzhou sat at the confluence of the West and Gui Rivers, commanding the waterways leading to Guangxi's capital Guilin and to western Guangxi—a vital transportation hub, the gateway to Guangxi Province. Having taken Wuzhou, the next step would be to advance up the Gui River to threaten Guilin, or to move west and control the vast agricultural regions of western Guangxi. Thus the strategic plan for the Two Guangs campaign made occupying Wuzhou a stage objective—preparation for the next phase of controlling all Guangxi.

The Pearl River Advance Squadron's Western Detachment, as the first vanguard to reach Wuzhou, was tasked with completely controlling the West and Gui River waters and cutting the city's supply lines. Schneider knew his responsibility was great. He dared not relax; already keyed up, thinking of this made him even less able to sleep. So he simply sat in a rattan chair leaning on his command saber, eyes closed, waiting for dawn.

But closing his eyes, Schneider couldn't help recalling the recent Battle of Antelope Gorge. The battle had been a great victory for the Western Detachment, but this "great victory" left Schneider embarrassed—two gunboats lost, dozens of casualties. For an old hand like Schneider, this was unacceptable. Such a victory would earn him only ridicule from colleagues, not honor. Thinking of Antelope Gorge made him angry; he was planning to take it out on the Wuzhou Naval Battalion.

*Just wait—tomorrow I'll slaughter you to the last man.*

At 0600 hours sharp, battle stations sounded—not because the enemy navy was attacking, but because Schneider had planned all along to wake Wuzhou with cannon fire. His calculation was: shell Wuzhou's south wall, lure the Naval Battalion out to fight, then form up and annihilate them in one blow. But as he sailed up the West River, Schneider was dumbfounded. Not only were there no Naval Battalion warships—there wasn't even a sampan. The entire river surface was empty; no vessels were moored at the docks on either bank.

*Probably the Naval Battalion won't come out this early.* Schneider consoled himself.

Then an hour passed. Two hours. Three hours. As ten o'clock approached, the Wuzhou Naval Battalion still hadn't appeared. The reconnaissance boats he'd sent out were returning with identical reports: no boats within nearly ten kilometers of the West River.

*Something abnormal is definitely afoot.* Schneider immediately thought of fire-ships. It seemed the enemy planned to repeat their old trick. The West River here was broad; the Battle of Ersha Point five years ago had proven fire-ships were useless on wide waters against the Fubo Navy. But the Gui River west of Wuzhou was different—only about five hundred meters wide. The squadron couldn't spread out there easily; they'd become sitting ducks for fire-ships. Since the West River surface was clear, the Naval Battalion must be ambushed up the Gui River, perhaps with masses of fire-ships waiting.

Yet the reconnaissance boats sent to the Gui River soon returned to report: no enemy vessels there either.

"What—they know they can't win, so they're just lying down to take a beating?" Schneider puzzled, then ordered: "Fire some shells at Wuzhou first!"

Shells screamed across the river—first landing on the docks outside the south gate, demolishing several buildings; then knocking down a stretch of battlement crenellations; then punching a dozen holes in the gate tower and starting a small fire. But the walls remained silent—no return cannon fire, no troops marching out to prepare for battle.

The Ming had apparently wised up. This was the consensus across the Huanan Army during the Two Guangs campaign: not firing at targets out of range, not randomly exposing themselves to Fubo Army artillery—this had become common wisdom among Ming commanders.

Schneider's original plan was to destroy the Naval Battalion before entering the Gui River, but as time slipped away, he grew restless. Speed was essential in war; sitting on the West River waiting for rabbits to run into the tree only wasted opportunities. The First Brigade's infantry boats had been waiting a long time. If he didn't commence full battle operations soon, he'd not only fail his objectives—the shame would be his alone to bear. The Gui River wasn't ideal terrain: narrow waters unfavorable for deploying the squadron, and completely covered by cannon fire from Wuzhou's west wall.

Worst of all, according to hydrological data from the Intelligence Department, the Gui River was much shallower than the West River. The main problem was numerous shoals that shifted unpredictably, making accurate navigation difficult. The reconnaissance boats had just reported signs that the enemy had blocked the Gui River with sunken boats and stones. Though not enough to ground gunboats, the *Zhujiang* definitely couldn't enter.

But without entering the Gui River, he couldn't complete the mission of blockading Wuzhou from the water.

"Send Fifth Squadron into the Gui River. Have one tugboat follow as cover."

With no time to fully map the Gui River's hydrology, he'd have to push through. If any vessel ran aground, the paddlewheel tugboat could quickly tow it free.

Fifth Squadron's six large armed landing craft headed into the Gui River, ready to engage. The ships quickly saw the signal flags on the *Zhujiang* and, per Plan B, advanced in two columns with the tugboat bringing up the rear, sailing grandly into the Gui River.

"All vessels maintain lookout!"

The two lead gunboats formed an angled formation, with Boat 38 at the front. Boat 38's captain, Ensign Yan Youcai, had been recently promoted; leading the advance, he was on highest alert. Not that Ensign Yan was overly cautious—he was eager to add more achievements, so he had to concentrate fully to obtain excellent results. But fate played a joke on Yan Youcai. Boat 38 had barely entered the Gui River mouth when—*thunk*—it stopped dead.

From the deck, Schneider saw Boat 38's distress flag in the distance and muttered a curse: "Damn it—what the hell were those reconnaissance boats doing?!" Before he'd finished speaking, the other lead gunboat also ran aground. Two gunboats sat motionless at the Gui River mouth, their boilers still belching black smoke.
