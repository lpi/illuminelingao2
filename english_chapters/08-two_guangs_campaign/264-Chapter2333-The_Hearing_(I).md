# Chapter 2333 - The Hearing (I)

Once the Wuzhou Riot Investigation Report was publicly published in the Senate, it indeed set off a wave of disturbance.

However, this disturbance was much smaller than past disturbances involving such matters. Firstly, Guangzhou was suffering from plague; including Hainan, various regions adopted strict prevention and control measures. Senators' energy was severely distracted. Except for a few people, the majority were busy enough to be overwhelmed, naturally having no great interest to toss about Xie Erren's problem. Secondly, over these years everyone had become less interested in that bit of matter on the BBS (lower body/scandal); everyone was more interested in how to use the topic to their advantage.

Naturally, the most enthusiastic about this was the Southbound Faction headed by Zhou Wei. He originally contacted dissatisfied industrial sector Senators everywhere, just waiting for such an opportunity. As long as the Liangguang campaign turned into a rotten mess, turning south would be logical and follow the natural course.

Aside from the Southbound Faction actively preparing materials, ready to "fully demonstrate the superiority of going south" at the Senate General Assembly, another part of Senators prepared to use this event to get rid of the Political Security Bureau—at least make it "harmless to humans and animals". As for the third faction of Senators, they prepared to use this to argue that investment in Liangguang was seriously insufficient and must be further increased.

Although the three parties currently had no specific actions, they each published various articles in the two journals and one newspaper and the internal BBS, making public opinion preparations, ready to have a large-scale tear-up (argument/fight) at the hearing a few days later.

As for Xie Erren, he also received notification to return to Lingao to attend the hearing. Wuzhou's specific work was temporarily managed by Zhao Fengtian.

Because of the plague, to reduce personnel flow, except for the person involved, Senators in the Liangguang region didn't return to Lingao to attend the hearing. Ma Jia listed several main topics based on proposals from all sides, and sent these topics and related materials to the hands of dispatched Senators. They only needed to elaborate their stance and reasons based on these topics—it didn't matter if they didn't elaborate reasons, as long as they had a specific stance.

As for personnel attending the hearing, fifty people were randomly selected from Senators in Lingao. Specific administrative work was responsible by the Judicial Sector.

The hearing was held secretly in Bairen City. Senators knowing shorthand and quick sketching conducted full recording.

"Shorthand is fine, but quick sketching too? We are imitating the American style." Dong Shiye looked at the tables and chairs arranged in a horseshoe shape in the venue and said.

"On the rostrum one red flag and one blue flag, adding radiance to each other! Matching this Rome-style Senate Emblem, isn't it a bit like the Human Empire (Imperium of Man)?" Ma Jia laughed.

He and Dong Shiye were the moderator and supervisor of the meeting respectively, so they arrived at the venue in advance.

"Right, right, pity not enough Steampunk." Dong Shiye looked at An Xi who was vigorously directing naturalized citizens to do the final arrangement work, "Is this all his idea?"

"Could he have this ability? These are all designed by Senators specializing in art." Ma Jia said, "Our assembly hall originally was too unparticular; minimalism must have limits too. Anyway this Lingao is our 'Land of Dragon Rising'. Spending some resources to make it better is no problem. Later when holding General Assemblies, D-Day Memorial Assemblies, it will also be more magnificent—can't always hold them in the open-air cinema."

"Ma Jia, do you say Xie Erren can pass safely this time?"

"This depends on how you define the word pass." Ma Jia smiled, "If you ask me, he should be better off than Dugu. Just afraid he will have to be an idler for a stage."

"Being an idler isn't a bad thing either." Dong Shiye said, "We are busy until pissing and shitting streams, aren't we also Senators? Even being the Senate Chairman, State Secretary, isn't it also one vote?"

"Although all one vote, influence is far different. Does your speaking in the Senate work as well as Wen Desi and Ma Qianzhu speaking? Dispatched Senators used to not speak loudly in the Senate; Chang Shide, Zhao Yingong these people were all fussed until faces covered in ash. Now it's different. Liangguang Strategy until now, dispatched Senators have solemnly become a big force in the Senate. This time industrial sector Senators are rubbing fists and wiping palms; isn't it because they feel their words don't work, ready to come earn a wave of existence?" Ma Jia sighed, "But if always losing voice, no one will take you seriously. Making a fuss, isn't without benefits."

Here An Xi had finished the final arrangement work, letting naturalized service personnel leave—from this moment on, the venue had no service personnel; everything including pouring water had to be self-service.

Fifty attending Senators arrived successively. Ma Jia saw quite a few familiar faces inside. Naturally, nowadays almost half of the Senators went to Liangguang. Selecting fifty from the remaining less than two hundred and fifty people, the winning ratio was still very high.

If in the past, several faces in here were enough to give Ma Jia a headache, but now, his technique of playing parliamentary struggle became more and more sophisticated—or rather, as more and more Senators rose in power and position, their buttocks began to sit on other benches. Things that could incite people's hearts originally, now increasingly had no combat power.

"Court President Ma, time is up." An Xi reminded him in a low voice beside him.

Ma Jia looked at his watch; sure enough, it was already 13:00 afternoon sharp.

"Last clearing of the field, close the main door." He ordered.

1 PM was the closing time for the hearing. Failure to arrive by the deadline was regarded as automatic abstention.

With the closing of the main door, the originally somewhat quiet assembly hall suddenly had more voices speaking—a room full of "own people", speaking naturally didn't have so many taboos.

"This Xie Erren is really acting recklessly! Not doing serious business, just doing women!"

"Exactly, playing sentiment all day long, talking about culture, I found him an eyesore long ago."

"Send him down to Danzhou to go down to the workshop for labor reform for three years."

"We Danzhou Chemical Industry don't want such a burden."

"Since ancient times pen-pushing cultured people are unreliable. After all, liberal arts students..."

"Did liberal arts students dig your ancestral grave? Or did they screw your family's life secretary?"

Both sides glared angrily, and immediately someone came out to smooth things over.

"This matter isn't entirely Xie Erren's responsibility. Being a bare commander sticking in Wuzhou, being able to maintain the situation counts as not bad. Isn't getting a woman a common phenomenon now? Didn't you push that female lab assistant in the Light Industry Central Laboratory last time?"

"I am not! I didn't! Don't talk nonsense!"

"Old Xie is quite wronged in this matter. Critical point is various departments gave him too little support. Just like in storytelling, giving you three thousand old and weak remnant soldiers to fight a tough battle—obviously sending to die!"

"Hehe, isn't Pol-Sec Baiureau known as omnipotent? Always having diarrhea (dropping the ball) at critical moments. Last time they slipped past, I want to see what rhetoric they have this time!"

"Fubo Army also has problems. A Senator in Wuzhou, giving him a company for joint defense—is this F-ing playing people? At least must leave a battalion!"

"Don't blindly BB (babble), how many battalions does Fubo Army have in total? Protecting him Xie Erren needs a battalion? Wen Desi in Guangzhou doesn't have such big pomp!"

"Wen Desi is also just a Senator, based on what is he more awesome than Xie Erren?!"

"Senator and Senator are inherently different," someone pretended to be profound, leisurely saying, "From the moment we stepped on the beach it was different..."

When the Senate's discussion began to diverge aimlessly as usual, Xie Erren quietly made his entrance.

Xie Erren dressed up carefully today, basically according to the standard of an American murderer going to court. Specially cut his hair, shaved his beard, wearing a neat set of half-new cotton "Cadre Suit". According to regulations, two Senators were assigned by the General Office to "escort" him.

Although the group of people came in quietly, as soon as he walked in, he immediately attracted the attention of Senators present. Some people even issued boos.

Xie Erren wanted to show some smiles to show he was "calm as usual", but right now his mood simply couldn't squeeze out any smile, so he had to keep a blank face, turning a deaf ear to the boos.

He had already read the main text of the investigation report. Although Ji Xin and Chen Baibin didn't hint anything to him when leaving, their every move during the investigation process was under his eyelids. Although he couldn't know exactly what the questioned people said, he could roughly guess the direction of the whole investigation.

Basically, the investigation was walking in the direction he expected. However, whether they collected more information, what exactly Zhao Fengtian and others said to the investigation team... he didn't know. So inevitably he was somewhat apprehensive in his heart.

After seeing the report, Xie Erren's heart roughly settled down. This report basically didn't exceed his expectations. He was secretly grateful in his heart; although he made arrangements beforehand, Ji Xin obviously "raised his hand high" (was lenient). Next, he had to count on the Senate to "raise hands high" on him.

For this, he had already figured out the questions he might encounter, and envisioned what way he should use to answer. To be honest, he greatly appreciated Chang Shide's defense back then, both solemn and humorous, mocking and scolding freely. However, his current problem was much bigger than Chang Shide's, better to maintain a low-profile, humble attitude.

He took a seat in the listening section. Looking somewhat nervously at Ma Jia who was on the presiding seat, only feeling his whole body "pierced by ten thousand arrows" by the gazes of attending Senators. Can't help heartbeat accelerating, forehead involuntarily seeping out sweat beads.

See people had all arrived, Ma Jia knocked with the gavel, saying: "Everyone please be quiet!"

followed by a whole set of "ceremony"—sense of ritual was an important component of the "Dignity of Law" Ma Jia pursued. So the current hearing procedure was much more complex than the past. Not only reading the Senate's "Hearing Resolution", but also reading relevant regulations etc.

After walking through a round of ceremony, more than ten minutes had passed. All Senators were somewhat impatient. At this time the gavel sounded again.

"Senators, the Wuzhou Riot Investigation presided over by Senators Ji Xin and Chen Baibin has finished. Relevant reports have also been distributed to all Senators. Are there any Senators participating in this hearing who haven't read this report or hold objections to this report?"
