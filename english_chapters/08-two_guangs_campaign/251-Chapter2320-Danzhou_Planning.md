# Chapter 2320 - Danzhou Planning

Zhou Wei won the first battle in Danzhou, gaining the support of a group of chemical industry Senators. To be honest, he knew nothing about chemistry or planning and originally had no interest in this meeting. He intended to leave right after achieving his goal, but the intensity of the summer storm was quite considerable. Sea transport around Yangpu Bay was suspended, and land routes were flooded. He couldn't leave even if he wanted to. Besides, Zhang Hao also suggested he build more rapport with the Senators; it would be more secure.

"After all, you don't come from a STEM background..."

"I am a science student, okay? My profession is finance, and finance is a science subject!" Zhou Wei quickly defended.

"Working in finance is original sin," Zhang Hao said. "In short, say less about your background in finance. Mention more about the fact that you are a science student; it's easier for everyone to have a common language."

After the excitement, the chemical industry Senators returned to the proper business of the seminar—after all, to speak loudly in the company, one either needed high EQ and social skills or had to be a business backbone with achievements.

"Next, we will conduct an overall review of the construction planning and process of the entire industrial park." Ji Tuisi stood up and said, "Although this plan is the result of brainstorming by our chemical industry sector over half a year and has obtained the approval of the Planning Commission, this project has huge investment and a long construction period, basically in a state of construction while designing. We must carefully consider how to execute the plan and how to arrange production lines—especially constantly paying attention to the Senate's actual industrial capacity..."

The map on the wall was drawn very grandly, filled with dense factory patterns and various bluffing annotations: "Special Chemical Combine," "Electrochemical General Plant," "Synthetic Gas and Liquefied Gas General Plant," "Chemical Machinery Plant," "Aniline Soda Plant," "Union Carbide Group"... At first glance, one would think it was a map of the Ruhr area.

This blueprint was the crystallization of the chemical industry sector's years of ambition. Since the Senate's "Lingao First Chemical Combine's" set of crude ammonia synthesis equipment started operating, the chemical industry sector had begun pursuing the path of expanding production capacity.

But expanding the capacity and variety of chemical products involved far more problems than other industrial sectors. First was the equipment problem. Although some key equipment and consumables were brought from the old timeline, these things were far from enough. The corrosion-resistant material they urgently needed—stainless steel—could not satisfy the supply for a long time due to the lack of critical nickel and chromium. This forced the chemical industry to use glass and ceramics, which were difficult to process and had poor material performance, as main production equipment materials for a long time, making it difficult to expand output and scale.

Moreover, with the development of the city in recent years, land, water resources, and pollution made it difficult for the chemical industry to further expand production scale in Lingao. A few people in the chemical industry calculated that only by moving as soon as possible could chemistry be given a new development opportunity.

Where to move specifically? After discussion, among the counties in Hainan, Southern Qiongzhou was basically rejected—too low development level, sparse population, many mountainous areas. Although there were some resources, most were difficult to develop. And except for Sanya, almost no county had a natural port with relatively good conditions. This was a fatal problem for a chemical industrial zone heavily reliant on imports and exports.

The industrial sector and the Planning Commission discussed and selected Danzhou, west of Lingao, as the chemical industrial zone.

Danzhou was next to Lingao, relatively close; although Danzhou's development level was not as good as Lingao and Chengmai, agriculture had a considerable foundation, with population and grain. Land supply was also relatively abundant. Moreover, Danzhou Bay was in the northwest of Hainan Island, on the leeward side of typhoons, making it one of the most ideal industrial development sites on the whole island. Industrial projects on Hainan Island in the old timeline were also all in the west.

Yangpu Port in Danzhou was a natural deep-water shelter. Even without terrain modification, it had natural excellent anchorage and shelter. The locality was rich in volcanic rock, which could be used as construction material on the spot, reducing the transfer of materials. In terms of land transportation, the distance from Danzhou to Lingao was not only short but also had good road-building conditions. Whether building high-grade highways or laying railways later, it was relatively convenient.

The location of Yangpu Port itself was also very superior. It could receive coal transported from Vietnam and timber transported from Laos, Cambodia, and other places nearby. Moreover, on the coastline north of Yangpu Port, there were salt fields, where sea salt needed for the salt chemical industry could be obtained locally.

Although the Senators' ambition was mainly in oil, with salt, coal, and timber, the chemical industry could be considered having great prospects. Even if oil could not be supplied in a short time, there was a backup option, which was the oil shale in Changpo, Danzhou—although not serious oil, it could make do.

Once the plan for the Danzhou Chemical Base was passed, it was included in the key projects of the "Second Five-Year Plan" in the form of a "Special Case."

Once the project was established, the "Danzhou Industrial Park Management Committee" was established in Danzhou as a comprehensive management agency responsible for the construction and coordination of the industrial park. Then the "Danzhou Industrial Park Construction General Headquarters" was established, with Lingao Construction General Company specifically undertaking the construction.

Several planners from the Planning and Design Institute of the Construction General Company conducted field exploration and map work around Yangpu and listened to the chemical industry's requirements for production layout.

The plan proposed by the chemical industry itself was to build around Danzhou Bay. But Qi Feng, who was responsible for specific planning and design, expressed that such a layout had many disadvantages.

First was the pollution discharge problem. Qi Feng wasn't an environmentalist, but he pointed out that the current plan of the chemical industry to gather all sewage into a main sewage canal or Beimen River and then discharge into Danzhou Bay wouldn't work. Because Danzhou Bay was a relatively closed inner sea with almost no wind and waves and lacked the drive of ocean currents. The runoffs of several rivers flowing into this bay were particularly small, so the bay's self-purification ability was very weak. If the sewage in the bay couldn't flow out, the whole thing would turn into a big jar of stinky water, and cleaning it up would be very difficult!

Secondly, water resources in Danzhou Bay were extremely unbalanced. The north bank severely lacked water. Although Danzhou had as much as 1500mm of annual precipitation, the rainfall was extremely uneven. It was a typical tropical monsoon climate. The north bank in the dry season presented a landscape of tropical savanna. Once rainfall was insufficient in the rainy season, the north bank would definitely suffer severe drought. If factories and living areas were built on the north bank, the water use problem must be considered, and water pipelines built.

The Beimen River estuary on the south bank had many wetlands and mudflats. These wetlands and mudflats required massive earth filling to be used as industrial land. It was not suitable to arrange a large number of industrial enterprises.

Although Danzhou Bay had a vast area and many large and small natural harbors, the only deep-water port was Yangpu. However, the planned Management Committee and garrison were located in Baimajing Town, while some factories and warehouses requiring large amounts of resources for production had to be located around Yangpu. This involved transportation issues. From Yangpu Port on the north bank to the Volte Army camp in Baimajing on the south bank, taking the train required circling the entire Danzhou Bay! The distance was quite considerable. To connect this node, the Yangpu Bridge must be built, but the Senate obviously didn't have the ability to build such a bridge capable of letting large ships pass.

Synthesizing the above issues, Qi Feng's suggestion was: most factories be set in Yangpu to facilitate nearby utilization of bulk cargo terminals and oil tanker terminals. A small portion of industries with huge water consumption be located in Baimajing, with lighter transfer and ferries communicating between the two; another portion of industries with low pollution be placed in Zhonghe Town, which was the seat of Danzhou Prefecture at that time. As for other enterprises, they could be arranged along the Beimen River as appropriate, close to the Beimen River for easy water intake and infrastructure; sewage must be discharged to the open sea, not into rivers or Danzhou Bay.

Because most chemical enterprises started with indigenous methods and were accident-prone, and there were multiple enterprises producing flammable and explosive hazardous chemicals, to avoid one exploding and taking the whole family with it, the safety distance between factories must be large enough, and the spacing between workshops must be greater than general standards.

The result of factory sparsity was an increased demand for transportation. Besides roads, light railways had to be laid within the industrial park for internal connection, and multiple wharves set up everywhere in Danzhou Bay to arrange short-distance ferries.

Most Senators in the chemical industry saw this new planning map for the first time. Although it was simpler than the map they produced themselves the first time—many projects were removed or merged—the drawing was exquisite, accompanied by a large number of color blocks and explanations, looking very "professional." Everyone looked somewhat fascinated.

"If this succeeds, we'll be like a heifer sitting on a train..." (Note: A pun meaning "awesome," referencing the cow's vulva and the train's whistle.)

"Chemistry is the primary productive force! How would that bunch of animals in the Executive Committee understand?"

"Say it again, there is no Executive Committee anymore!"

"Then that bunch of animals in the Government Administration Council understands farts!"

"I feel is our factory area too big? It simply divides up all of Danzhou—might as well cancel Danzhou and change it to Industrial Park management."

"Exactly! What meaning is there for Liu Yixiao to squat in Danzhou? Once the Danzhou Industrial Park Management Committee is established, several Senators will be sitting inside. What can he do? He can only fully cooperate with us in construction and production. He wouldn't be happy himself. Rather than this, better get a naturalized citizen to be the county magistrate."

"Correct, at least obedient. If Magistrate Liu refuses to cooperate, we can't easily lay a black hand on him. Hahaha."

"As long as arms, fertilizers, and medicines can be produced, these aren't issues. However, everyone is a Senator; don't make the face look too ugly. Better ask him to seek other high employment as soon as possible."

Ji Tuisi coughed, interrupting everyone's discussion: "Regarding the factory area, although the park is large, it's actually very scattered. According to old timeline standards, they are just some small workshops. In terms of energy, the mode of direct power supply from DC power stations is mainly adopted—everyone understands the reason. Unable to produce silicon steel, naturally we can't make transformers, circuit breakers, and a series of electrical control equipment, so networking is impossible. Fortunately, our main power supply targets are the Changpo Factory Group and Yangpu Factory Group. Of these two factory groups, the Yangpu Factory Group is mainly electrolysis plants, and Changpo is graphite plants and silicon carbide, both of which can directly use direct current."
