# Chapter 2346 - Freshly Baked Nanyang Company (VI)

After contact, he felt this person's temperament steady, handling affairs organized. The Senate's HR wasn't easy to do. Work had thousands threads ten thousand clues, also dealing with massive forms and data... Being able to handle a side alone for years like one day, work ability definitely not ordinary.

He suddenly remembered, Xu Yanliang and Wang Kai were both members of Great Navigation Club. Back then advocating launching of 854 Project he also had a share.

Speaking so, persuading him to join had great possibility.

Sure enough, Zhou Wei found Xu Yanliang to talk, he agreed fully immediately.

"HR work I am also tired of doing. Changing environment just right." He said, "Anyway all routine works. Lacking me naturalized citizens can continue doing this work. I write an application then come. You prepare Appointment Letter."

"Letter of Appointment (Employment)."

"Fine. Whatever called."

So three days later Xu Yanliang arrived at third floor of Customs Building. Officially became "Nanyang Company Board Secretary". Nanyang Company Zhou Wei spent pains to set up finally had a basic team.

Three people of Nanyang Company convened a small meeting in Zhou Wei's office. Meeting theme was establishing future development road of Nanyang Company.

Topic very big. But also very vague. Yet was a guiding thought for Nanyang Company future development. What should do, what shouldn't do, how to do. All had to find basis from this historic document formulated today. Speaking not too accurately, this was future *Basic Law* of Nanyang Company.

"Gentlemen, our Nanyang Company's future, is in today's topic." Zhou Wei said, "I roughly elaborate my basic view on future operation first."

Undoubtedly, Nanyang Company's blueprint was various "India Companies" most popular in this spacetime. Starting from Dutch initiating establishment of first East India Company. European countries competed to establish "East India" and "West India" companies for colonization and trade purposes. Although these companies mostly had varied operation situations. But from Dutch East India Company with most urgent momentum back then to British East India Company exiting historical stage last. Without exception left respective heavy strokes in Asia and America. Influence even far-reaching. British East India Company even pioneered unprecedented precedent of ruling whole subcontinent of millions square kilometers, controlling regime of dozens native states, squeezing hundreds of millions population by a commercial company.

Whether pioneer Dutch East India or late comer catches up British East India. Were all objects of envy and imitation of Zhou Wei these people.

Compared to administrative organs, a company's conduct naturally much "looser". Could proceed perfectly according to principle of "Whatever law doesn't prohibit is allowed". Almost anything could be done. Compared to Colonization and Trade Ministry controlled and commanded by Senate. Nanyang Company could be said to completely offload shackles, going into battle with light pack.

Nanyang Company blueprint drawn by Southbound Faction and Zhou Wei was very big. From India, Australia, North South America... Wherever having coastline. Almost all had Senator's coveting and relevant development plans. However principle of eating rice mouthful by mouthful was still understood. Current strength of Nanyang Company didn't allow him to squander. Could only start from projects with little investment and fast effect.

So things like America, Australia, New Zealand. Even including India. Were all removed from schedule by Zhou Wei. Wanting to open branch mines in so many places simultaneously. Let alone his empty shell company couldn't do. Even Senate betting all resources couldn't do either.

"...Frankly speaking, Senate and Administration Council willing to open this hole now. Still due to insufficient material reason. Original Colonization Trade Ministry cannot satisfy demand. So let go letting us try. My view is: Must obtain profit as soon as possible—this profit even must be instant effect. Time passes very fast. If by this time next year still engaging in layout setting points opening bases. Our company counts as half yellowed (failed)."

"Your requirement is too high right." Wang Kai said, "One year time can do what? Even building a ship needs half year! Going out doing sea trade. Round trip calculated by year. One year effort building framework is about enough. Besides we raise funds ourselves. Not using Senate money. Based on what they chirp and squeak."

"I understand Chief Zhou's meaning." Xu Yanliang nodded, "This time we borrowed Wuzhou Incident opportunity. Showed hand (All in) winning once. People unconvinced in heart are many. If cannot bring out some solid achievement then. Immediately will encounter inquiry. In case appearing any leak. Then inquiry, hearing will come tightly..."

"No way..."

"I see this is inevitable." Xu Yanliang spread both hands.

"Fine. Then you say." Wang Kai more or less somewhat unhappy. His bag contained a plan of conquering Manila, then controlling Philippine Islands.

Zhou Wei spread open a huge East Asia - Southeast Asia region map on conference table. But he didn't point mountains and rivers on map immediately elaborating Nanyang Company grand map. Instead said:

"First thing we have to do right now is moving house." He said, "Company headquarters cannot be placed in Lingao."

"Approved." Xu Yanliang said.

"Why?" Wang Kai couldn't understand. Now Senate "Productivity" seventy percent in Lingao. And supply of naturalized cadres, technical personnel, workers relied on Lingao ninety percent above. Leaving Lingao. Wouldn't it lose convenient condition of obtaining resources nearby?

"Lingao water too deep. Eyes too many too." Zhou Wei said, "Although running to apply for resources is more convenient. But once company starts operating. Many company internal news and status will leak out quickly—although we have operation autonomy. But Senators have supervision right on National Policy Enterprise. If someone wants to find fault. Grabbing certain things to make trouble. Company operation will receive great influence."

Xu Yanliang said: "Since so I propose moving to Guangzhou. Our export materials mostly come from mainland. Setting up Head Company in Guangzhou convenient for direct purchasing. If wanting colonization in future. Can also recruit immigrants locally in Guangzhou. No need to transfer via Lingao once."

Direct purchasing and recruiting immigrants in Guangzhou saved constraints of Planning Academy. As long as having money. Willing to stock how much goods. Recruit how many people all Nanyang Company self said counted (decided).

"Going to Guangzhou aren't we Colonization Trade Ministry changing face." Wang Kai expressed opposition, "Guangzhou isn't near Southeast Asia. We people not visiting front line personally. Hiding in rear to command won't do. Anyway Lingao is closer to Southeast Asia than Guangzhou."

Zhou Wei nodded: "To be honest. I also thought so. But now probably cannot realize..."

Guangzhou having Rat Plague. At least waiting few months later to end. Nanyang Company couldn't wait so long. Zhou Wei's thought was moving Nanyang Company team out first.

"Otherwise we take down Malacca..." Wang Kai said jokingly.

"I also want ah. But taking down Malacca such expedition action we don't think temporarily."

Xu Yanliang suddenly said: "I actually have a place. Can serve as transition temporarily."

"Where?"

"Sanya." Xu Yanliang said: Sanya Special City although established initially for shipping out local iron ore and other special products. Senate consistently held high expectation value on it. Sanya consistently obtained massive policy, industry and fund supports. Not only enjoying Special City rank. In various trade agreements Senate listed Sanya as Open Port. Greatly having meaning of developing Sanya foreign trade.

But Sanya foreign trade generally speaking not too successful. Although having good harbor. Sanya distance from Senate ruling Core Zone still traffic inconvenient. Commodity transport inconvenient. For many foreign merchant ships. Trading at Sanya. Except minority cargos. Mostly needed longer waiting ship period. Cargo selectable room also not as big as Lingao and Guangzhou.

"...These are all Sanya's disadvantages. But exactly because of disadvantages. We going to Sanya will receive City Government welcome. Presumably many aspects will receive local government support. This is much better than us in Guangzhou or Lingao. Departing from Sanya to Nanyang also more convenient. Disadvantage is typhoon relatively frequent."

"Says so too. Foreign Trade General Company has strong influence in these two places. We going there has no meaning either." Wang Kai said, "Actually choosing Kaohsiung is also okay. Neighboring Fujian—that is also important export commodity output place."

"Kaohsiung infrastructure is too poor." Zhou Wei shook head, "And Dutch sticking there."

At the meeting first decision was made quickly: Nanyang Company headquarters move to Sanya.

"Then Southeast Asia Company?"

"Move away together." Zhou Wei said, "We and Southeast Asia Company actually is one set of organ two plaques. But we must have an office in Lingao. Taking care of company interest."

"This has to be Senator."

"Guangzhou also must have an agent." Xu Yanliang said.

"En. But these two not necessarily need to be full time personnel. As long as Senator identifying with our company purpose and operation guideline is okay. Counted as part-time." Zhou Wei said, "We can give him a Director seat. Of course have to invest shares."

Everyone no objection. Next Zhou Wei started talking action plan.

"My plan is engaging Mekong Delta first." Zhou Wei pointing at later Saigon region, "Senate most uneasy problem now is food. Taking down Saigon. Helpful to food security."

"That place development degree no good." Wang Kai shook head, "Has development. But difference with our that spacetime very far."

"So we still have to colonize. Acquiring food while developing." Zhou Wei said, "To be honest how much food can get solely relying on trade? Better getting from local directly faster. Right. Don't those Agriculture Committee people like engaging big farm most? Arriving Mekong Delta they can Enclose Land casually—this temptation should be big enough."
