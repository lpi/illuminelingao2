# Chapter 2143 - Regrouping

In the past, he wouldn't even dare to think about this: the difference between him and Xiong Wencan was like clouds and mud. Let alone seeing him in person, he didn't even know how much silver it would cost just to see his staff or stewards. But right now, Xiong Wencan had lost Guangdong completely. Now, besides "sitting and waiting for death," he could only "turn to any doctor in a desperate illness." He would inevitably be more courteous to the worthy and condescending to the scholarly.

But this person was not easy to find. Gou Xunli was originally just a "local gentry" in a remote small county. At best, he could call brothers with the "Five Giants of the County Town"; once out of the county, he wasn't so "worthy" anymore. When the Gou family was at its peak, the advisor of the Qiongzhou Prefect was considered the most powerful political figure they had associated with.

When they fled to Guangzhou and looked for ways to file complaints everywhere, Gou Xunli profoundly realized his own insignificance. On the ground of Guangdong, except for Li Siya who actively came to recruit him later, he had no connections worth mentioning at all.

Fortunately, the opportunity came quickly. For safety and ease of robbery, the mountain stronghold had planted quite a few spies inside and outside Wuzhou city. These people secretly colluded with the bandits, constantly passing various news to the stronghold. After the Bald Thieves broke the city, Gou and Hu had worries in their hearts, so they sent even more people into the city and the four countrysides to contact the "sitting spies." First, to see if the Bald Thieves had any movement to suppress bandits; second, to try to find if they could secretly contact scattered government personnel to serve as their guides.

One of the sitting spies used to be a "White Body" (unofficial) bailiff serving in the county yamen. After the Australians entered the city, he heard the rumors and hid at home—anyway, white bailiffs were not on the roster; as long as they didn't go to the yamen to handle official business, they were considered to have severed ties.

Because of his service in the yamen, this person had been assigned to stand guard outside the Viceroy's Yamen, so he had seen Yi Haoran a few times and knew his background. The day before, he went to the street to do business and saw Yi Haoran, who was serving as a "receptionist," in front of a house holding a funeral.

This bailiff originally just wanted to take the opportunity to extort some money from Yi Haoran. Encountering the bandit coming down from the mountain looking for a "guide," he told the visitor this news.

Gou Xunli obtained the news like a treasure. Because according to the sitting spy: Yi Haoran had once commanded Xiong Wencan's house guards—from this, it could be seen that he must be a trusted advisor in Xiong Wencan's private staff. Since he was hiding among the people, he surely wouldn't have defected to the Bald Thieves. Even if he couldn't persuade him, he wouldn't be reported by him. So he risked changing his appearance and personally came to Wuzhou to make contact.

His self-description about being a "Lingao gentry," "defecting to the Liangguang Viceroy," "being in Commander He's staff," and so on, were all to raise his own status and also to eliminate Advisor Yi's wariness.

Sure enough, after he said these few sentences, the wariness in Yi Haoran's eyes decreased a lot. He whispered, "In that case, what did the strong man come here for?"

Gou Xunli also whispered: "Does Sir forget that this is the land of the Great Ming and want to live peacefully as a citizen of the Great Song forever?"

Yi Haoran looked at him deeply: "I dare not forget!" He perfunctorily said a few words to the people around him and asked again, "Where are you staying?"

"It's inconvenient for me to stay long in the city—the Bald Thieves want to inspect household registration," Gou Xunli quickly looked around and whispered, "I will go to the Dragon Mother Temple in the north of the city to offer incense at noon tomorrow. Sir can go there to wait for me."

Gou Xunli didn't dare to fully trust this Advisor Yi. Meeting outside the city, he could send people to the scene in advance to check for ambushes, lest this advisor suddenly wanted to use his head as a meeting gift.

That night, Yi Haoran thought again and again and decided to connect with Gou Xunli's line. Now that the funeral of Jiang Qiuchan's family was basically finished, he had no reason to continue living here. And he had nowhere to go in Wuzhou—not only that, if he said he would go to Teng County now, the roads were not peaceful. Even if the Bald Thieves didn't block the roads, it was hard to guarantee his life if he encountered robbing bandits.

Gou Xunli's background was certainly suspicious, but he was a down-and-out advisor, a semi-old man, neither a handsome man nor a beautiful woman, nor did he have family wealth. Gou Xunli wouldn't go so far as to design a trap to deceive him. If it were a trap by the Bald Thieves, he wasn't some important figure; moreover, he was right in the city. Killing or arresting him was just a matter of a sentence for the Bald Thieves; why go to such great trouble?

No matter what this "Warrior Gou" plotted, it wouldn't do him any harm. The worst was losing his life. Conversely, in case this Gou Xunli really had some brilliant plan and could turn the tide, it might not be a bad thing—anyway, the situation of Xiong Wencan and the Guangdong Ming army had deteriorated to the extreme. Fighting to the death, perhaps misfortune turned to blessing, could still reverse the universe.

Thinking to this point, he quietly went to see Qiuchan.

"Your niece-in-law's major event is finished. It is inconvenient for me to stay here any longer—it hinders your reputation." Yi Haoran weighed his words, "Tomorrow I will go outside to look for a house and move out immediately."

"Uncle has no relatives or friends in Wuzhou, and it's a time of chaos and war; where can you easily rent a house to settle down?" Qiuchan had relied entirely on Yi Haoran running around outside and supporting the scene these days to manage this funeral peacefully. She was very grateful to this "Advisor Yi": one must know that for a widow and orphan like her, without relatives supporting the scene outside, she would be an object of bullying and extortion in society. Often after a funeral, before the bones were cold, the family would be bankrupt.

Although she knew that "Hao Ran's" departure was good for herself and this remaining broken family, the fear of orphans and widows being helpless and the good impression of his gentlemanly character and decisiveness in times of crisis during their day-and-night association these past few days made her unwilling to let him leave just like that.

However, his staying like this was indeed unjustifiable. Qiuchan thought for a while and said, "Cousin-uncle, don't worry. It's a time of chaos and war now, and you are a stranger; no one will be willing to rent a house for a while—it's better to find a job here to settle down—either teaching a private school or being an accountant. Once you have a job, you will also have a place to live."

Yi Haoran said: "That sounds good, but where to find a job in such a hurry."

"Cousin-uncle, don't worry. My natal family does business locally and has quite some connections. Tomorrow I will ask my natal relatives to inquire for you."

Yi Haoran naturally respectfully accepted. The next day, he went out of the city as agreed.

This was his first time out of the city after the war. Seeing the withering and desolation outside the city after the flames of war, he sighed endlessly. However, order outside the city had largely recovered. Bald Thief soldiers leading a group of "militiamen" equipped with long spears and broadswords were patrolling and standing guard, giving a feeling of stability. The ruins on the streets were being cleared by teams of laborers. On the riverbank south of the Dragon Mother Temple, various collected materials were piled up like mountains, and many ships were moored. Presumably, they were going to repair the pontoon bridge on the Gui River. The shops had opened their doors; although business was sparse, there was finally a bit of vitality of surviving a disaster.

Suddenly, a whistle came from afar. Looking up, thick smoke rolled over the West River, and another fleet of ships, connected head to tail, slowly sailed towards here—this must be the Bald Thieves' warships coming. Yi Haoran suddenly felt that he was really a fool. Xiong Wencan sat on tens of thousands of troops but was beaten to pieces in Wuzhou, ending up fleeing in panic. He, a mere scholar, wanted to "discuss state affairs" with a greenwood hero. Could his hundred or so greenwood heroes reverse the universe?

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel secretly sad. He just felt the future was dim and lightless; he was merely carrying snow to fill a river or cooking sand to make rice.

While he was feeling sad, he suddenly heard a voice speaking: "In your team, there were a total of seventy-six work shifts this morning. Where did ninety work shifts come from? Look, the tallies are clearly recorded here..."

This voice was very familiar. Yi Haoran looked in the direction of the voice and saw a person who looked like a scholar talking to several foremen in a straw shed by the roadside. looking closely, who else could it be but Chang Qingyun!

While shocked, this Chang Qingyun suddenly raised his head. Judging from his instantly frozen expression, he must have recognized him!

Chang Qingyun was stunned, then immediately said: "...If you don't believe me, I'll calculate it for you right now..." After saying that, he gave Yi Haoran a "go quickly" glance.

Yi Haoran nodded slightly, daring not to stay any longer, and hurried his steps towards the Dragon Mother Temple.

On the way, he hesitated once whether to go meet Xun Li at the Dragon Mother Temple. But on second thought, although Chang Qingyun had been captured by the Bald Thieves, it seemed he was treated reasonably well and hadn't been driven to carry loads to repair the city walls. He recognized him but didn't report him on the spot, instead signaling him to leave quickly; it seemed a thread of conscience remained in his heart.

Influenced by seeing Chang Qingyun again and his "unyielding captivity," Yi Haoran's mood improved somewhat. He walked briskly, thinking:

"As for this Warrior Xun, regardless of how much ability he actually has, at least he can serve the country with a red heart. Whether turning the tide or being a mantis trying to stop a chariot, I must try again!"

Just as Yi Haoran was secretly meeting Gou Xunli at the Dragon Mother Temple, the fleet coming from the West River docked at the North Gui Grand Dock outside the Dayun Gate. As soon as the gangplank was set up, teams of soldiers wearing brand-new gray uniforms walked down from the ships in formation.

probably because they had been on the boat for too long, the formation was sparse and not neat, and the soldiers also appeared listless. Qian Duo was on the dock, shaking his head as he looked at this troop—he had received a notification that the National Army Wuzhou Battalion would arrive today. He had been waiting for this battalion for a long time; after all, relying only on his one hundred men and a few hundred militiamen, Wuzhou's defense was really too weak.

However, looking at the troops in front of him: new clothes, new guns, obviously the people were also new. Judging from their military appearance, it wasn't guaranteed that most of them hadn't expanded locally in Guangdong—many still held standard spears.

To expand enough National Army from the "homeland" was really too difficult for the Senate. Therefore, in the construction of the National Army, the main body was still the original National Army as the backbone, expanding with old Wei-Suo soldiers and surrendered Ming troops recruited locally in Guangdong.
