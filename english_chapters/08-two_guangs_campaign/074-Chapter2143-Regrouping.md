# Chapter 2143 - Regrouping

In former times, even contemplating such an approach would have been inconceivable—the gulf separating him from Xiong Wencan yawned as vast as that between clouds and earth. Securing an audience with the Viceroy himself? Impossible. He couldn't even estimate the silver required merely to access Xiong's staff or household stewards. Yet circumstances had transformed dramatically. Xiong Wencan had lost Guangdong entirely. Now his options had narrowed to "awaiting death passively" or "seeking any physician in desperate illness." Inevitably, he would extend greater courtesy to worthy men and condescend to scholars.

The challenge lay in identifying the right intermediary. Gou Xunli had been merely "local gentry" in a remote backwater county. At his apex, he'd claimed brotherhood with the "Five Giants of the County Town"—beyond those boundaries, his "worthiness" carried negligible weight. During the Gou family's zenith, the most powerful political connection they'd cultivated extended only to an advisor serving the Qiongzhou Prefect.

When they'd fled to Guangzhou seeking redress through every available channel, Gou Xunli had confronted his own insignificance with brutal clarity. Throughout Guangdong, aside from Li Siya who'd actively recruited him later, he possessed no connections worth mentioning.

Fortune, however, arrived swiftly. For security and profitable robbery, the mountain stronghold had planted numerous spies throughout Wuzhou and its environs. These operatives maintained clandestine collaboration with the bandits, continuously relaying intelligence to the stronghold. After the Bald Thieves breached the city, Gou and Hu's anxieties intensified, prompting them to dispatch additional agents into urban and rural areas to contact their "embedded spies." Their objectives were twofold: ascertain whether the Bald Thieves planned bandit suppression operations, and attempt covert contact with scattered government personnel who might serve as guides.

One embedded spy had formerly served as an unofficial "White Body" bailiff in the county yamen. Following the Australians' occupation, he'd caught wind of various rumors and retreated to his home—white bailiffs lacking official roster status could sever ties simply by ceasing yamen attendance.

His yamen service had included guard duty outside the Viceroy's offices, affording him several glimpses of Yi Haoran and knowledge of his background. The previous day, while conducting street business, he'd spotted Yi Haoran serving as "receptionist" before a household conducting funeral rites.

The bailiff's initial intent had been merely extracting some extortion money from Yi Haoran. When a bandit descended from the mountain seeking a "guide," however, he'd shared this intelligence.

Gou Xunli received the news as precious treasure. According to the embedded spy, Yi Haoran had once commanded Xiong Wencan's household guards—clear evidence of trusted advisor status within Xiong's private staff. Since he remained concealed among the populace, he surely hadn't defected to the Bald Thieves. Even if persuasion failed, betrayal seemed unlikely. Thus Gou risked altering his appearance and personally entering Wuzhou to establish contact.

His self-presentation as "Lingao gentry," "refugee to the Liangguang Viceroy," "member of Commander He's staff," and similar credentials served dual purposes: elevating his own status while dispelling Advisor Yi's wariness.

The strategy succeeded. After these few statements, the caution in Yi Haoran's eyes visibly diminished. He whispered, "What purpose brings you here, then?"

Gou Xunli leaned closer still. "Does the gentleman truly forget this remains Great Ming territory? Do you intend to live peacefully as a Great Song subject forever?"

Yi Haoran regarded him with penetrating intensity. "I dare not forget." He offered perfunctory remarks to nearby mourners before inquiring, "Where are you lodging?"

"Extended stays in the city pose difficulties—the Bald Thieves conduct household registration inspections." Gou Xunli scanned their surroundings swiftly before whispering, "Tomorrow at noon, I'll offer incense at the Dragon Mother Temple north of the city. You can await me there."

Gou Xunli dared not extend complete trust to this Advisor Yi. An extramural meeting allowed advance reconnaissance for ambushes, preventing this advisor from potentially using his head as a tribute offering.

That evening, Yi Haoran deliberated extensively before deciding to pursue Gou Xunli's connection. With Jiang Qiuchan's household funeral essentially concluded, his pretext for continued residence had evaporated. Moreover, he possessed nowhere else in Wuzhou to retreat—beyond that, attempting passage to Teng County now meant confronting dangerous roads. Even if the Bald Thieves maintained no roadblocks, encountering plundering bandits could prove fatal.

Gou Xunli's background certainly invited suspicion, yet Yi himself was merely a destitute advisor, aging and unremarkable, possessing neither striking looks nor family wealth. Gou Xunli wouldn't expend such elaborate deception on him. If the Bald Thieves had set a trap, his insignificance rendered him unworthy of such machinations—they could eliminate or arrest him with a simple command. Why pursue such convoluted measures?

Whatever plots this "Warrior Gou" harbored, they posed minimal threat to him personally. The worst outcome was death. Conversely, should Gou Xunli genuinely possess a brilliant stratagem capable of reversing fortunes, potential benefits beckoned—regardless, Xiong Wencan and the Guangdong Ming forces had deteriorated catastrophically. Desperate struggle might yet transform calamity into blessing, reversing the cosmic order itself.

Reaching this conclusion, he quietly sought out Qiuchan.

"Your niece-in-law's mourning ceremony has concluded. My continued presence grows inappropriate—it compromises your reputation." Yi Haoran chose his words carefully. "Tomorrow I'll seek lodgings elsewhere and remove myself immediately."

"Uncle possesses neither relatives nor friends in Wuzhou, and these times remain chaotic with warfare. How can you easily secure rental housing for settlement?" Qiuchan had relied entirely upon Yi Haoran's external advocacy and presence management these past days to conduct the funeral peacefully. Her gratitude toward this "Advisor Yi" ran deep. For a widow with orphan like herself, lacking relatives to provide external support rendered one vulnerable to societal exploitation and extortion. Often following funerals, before bones cooled, families faced bankruptcy.

Though she recognized "Hao Ran's" departure benefited both herself and her shattered household, fear of widow-and-orphan helplessness combined with favorable impressions formed through their continuous association—his gentlemanly character and crisis decisiveness—made her reluctant to see him depart so abruptly.

Yet his continued residence truly lacked justification. Qiuchan contemplated briefly before suggesting, "Cousin-uncle, please don't worry. In these chaotic times, as a stranger, you'll find none willing to rent housing readily. Better to secure employment establishing your circumstances—whether teaching private academy or serving as accountant. Once employed, lodging naturally follows."

Yi Haoran nodded. "Sound advice, yet where might such employment materialize with such urgency?"

"Cousin-uncle, rest assured. My natal family conducts local commerce and maintains considerable connections. Tomorrow I'll have natal relatives make inquiries on your behalf."

Yi Haoran accepted with respectful gratitude. The following day, he departed the city as arranged.

This marked his first extramural venture since the warfare. Witnessing the devastation wrought by flames of war, he sighed endlessly. Yet order beyond the walls had substantially recovered. Bald Thief soldiers leading "militia" groups equipped with spears and broadswords conducted patrols and maintained guard posts, projecting stability. Labor teams cleared street ruins systematically. Along the riverbank south of the Dragon Mother Temple, collected materials towered like mountains, numerous vessels moored nearby—presumably preparations for Gui River pontoon bridge repairs. Shops had opened their doors; though commerce remained sparse, faint vitality of disaster survival emerged.

Abruptly, a distant whistle pierced the air. Glancing upward, thick smoke billowed across the West River as another fleet, vessels linked bow-to-stern, sailed slowly forward—certainly more Bald Thief warships approaching. Yi Haoran suddenly perceived his own foolishness with crystalline clarity. Xiong Wencan had commanded tens of thousands yet suffered catastrophic defeat at Wuzhou, fleeing in panic. He, a mere scholar, presumed to "discuss statecraft" with a bandit chieftain. Could this hundred-odd greenwood warriors reverse the cosmic order?

Despair settled over him. The future appeared utterly lightless—he was attempting to fill a river with snow, to cook sand into rice.

While depression claimed him, a familiar voice penetrated his melancholy: "Your workforce logged seventy-six labor shifts this morning. Where do ninety shifts originate? Look—the tallies clearly document this..."

The voice struck recognition immediately. Yi Haoran's gaze found its source: a scholar-like figure conversing with several foremen beneath a roadside straw shelter. Closer inspection confirmed the impossible—Chang Qingyun!

Shock paralyzed both men momentarily. Chang Qingyun's expression froze upon recognition.

Recovery came swiftly. "...If you doubt me, I'll recalculate right now..." Chang Qingyun declared, simultaneously flashing Yi Haoran an urgent "depart quickly" glance.

Yi Haoran inclined his head fractionally, daring no further delay, and hastened toward the Dragon Mother Temple.

En route, he briefly questioned whether to proceed with meeting Xun Li. Reflection clarified matters—though the Bald Thieves had captured Chang Qingyun, his treatment appeared reasonably humane. He hadn't been degraded to hauling construction materials. Recognizing Yi yet declining immediate betrayal, instead signaling urgent departure, suggested some remnant conscience endured.

Witnessing Chang Qingyun again and his "unyielding captivity" somewhat ameliorated Yi Haoran's mood. His stride quickened, thoughts crystallizing:

*Regarding this Warrior Xun, regardless of actual capability, at minimum his heart serves the nation loyally. Whether reversing destiny's tide or acting as mantis confronting chariot, I must attempt this course!*

While Yi Haoran conducted clandestine meetings at the Dragon Mother Temple, the West River fleet docked at North Gui Grand Dock beyond Dayun Gate. Gangplanks descended, disgorging formation after formation of soldiers clad in pristine gray uniforms.

Extended riverine transport had evidently taken its toll—formations appeared sparse and untidy, soldiers listless. Qian Duo observed dockside, shaking his head at this assemblage. He'd received advance notification: the National Army Wuzhou Battalion would arrive today. He'd awaited this battalion extensively—relying solely upon his hundred men and several hundred militia, Wuzhou's defense remained perilously vulnerable.

Yet surveying the troops before him—new uniforms, new firearms, obviously newly recruited personnel as well. Judging from military bearing, most had clearly undergone local Guangdong expansion—many still bore standard-issue spears.

Expanding sufficient National Army forces from the "homeland" posed insurmountable difficulties for the Senate. Consequently, National Army construction employed the original core as backbone, expanding through veteran Wei-Suo soldiers and surrendered Ming troops recruited locally throughout Guangdong.
