# Chapter 2400: Zhang Yu's Predicament

This owner of Zhang's Walnut Pastry, Chu He had long heard of. After Ren Youzi mentioned him, he had learned a bit more about Zhang Yu himself and his company's background.

Although he hadn't had time to look at deep background investigations like financial reports, a rough sketch of this person and his enterprise had already been made in his mind.

"A talented person born at the right time."

This was Chu He's first assessment of Zhang Yu. There was nothing extraordinary about Zhang Yu as a person. To put it bluntly, he had caught the "wind." To put it more bluntly, he was "a pig flying on the wind."

But merely "born at the right time" was too simple. The Senate had helped thousands upon thousands of people, all of whom had changed their fates because of it, but the vast majority stopped there. In comparison, this young brother Zhang hit every beat of the Senate's rhythm—never mind whether there was Senator Hong's guidance behind this, this level of courage and insight wasn't something ordinary people had.

Better to see for himself than to just hear about him. He'd go look at his shop first. Even if he couldn't see the person, at least he could learn a thing or two from the shop.

Zhang Yu was currently at the main store in the Great World.

Since following Zeng Juan's advice to separate from his father and each establish their own company, his father's company stayed in the original location, keeping the old brand name, still called "Zhang's Old Shop Pastry." It operated workshop-style with production behind the shop, mainly supplying old customers and some "new money" who had "come because of the reputation." He himself registered and established "Zhang's Food Products Co., Ltd.," purchased land outside the city to build a factory, and factory-produced various packaged foods. The main customer, needless to say, was the Senate. He rode the trend and set his company headquarters at the Great World store.

Everything he had could be said to come from the Senate's blessing. His business was also almost entirely given by the Senate. "Closely follow the Senate" was his guiding philosophy for running the company. For this, he needed to stay in the place closest to the Senators—in Guangzhou, this place was the Great World.

Since it was headquarters, he rented all three floors of the entire storefront at once. The first floor was the shop, the second floor was offices and warehouse, and the third floor was dormitories—actually, he usually also stayed in the Great World dormitory with the staff half the time, rather than going home.

His parents' home had also been relocated to a new place. They had purchased the old residence of a gentry family. This family had been implicated in a kidnapping and murder case, the whole family was exiled to Kaohsiung, and their property was confiscated. This residence was then "auctioned" by the Planning Committee Special Search Team's Guangzhou Unit.

The newly purchased residence wasn't large but was exquisitely built, very much to Old Master Zhang and his wife's liking. According to his father's thinking, now that his son had established his career and purchased a residence, it was time to "start a family"—matchmakers seeking to arrange marriages were about to wear through the doorstep, including daughters from "high branches" they wouldn't have dared dream of in the past.

But Zhang Yu wasn't in a hurry to find a wife. For one, he currently wasn't in that mindset. For another, he had long had feelings for the tofu shop owner's daughter. Although the two hadn't "privately pledged eternal love," Zhang Yu always felt he couldn't just marry someone else like this. Besides, business was getting busier by the day, so this matter was set aside.

To outsiders, Zhang Yu's current situation was smooth sailing, everything going his way. Not only had his family's walnut pastry shop become famous throughout Guangzhou city, with officials and nobles all considering it an honor to taste his pastries, but also the newly built factory outside the city had products that weren't worried about sales—whatever was produced, the Australians' ships would take it all. Only ships waiting for goods, never goods waiting for ships. People inside and outside the city all said the Zhang family was now "making a fortune daily."

But Zhang Yu couldn't feel happy at all. He had encountered the troublesome matters that all rapidly growing enterprises face.

First was lack of people. That's right, Zhang's Food Products had fallen into a severe "labor shortage."

Of course, he didn't lack laborers who just needed to exert physical effort. What he lacked were "workers" and "management personnel."

Zhang's Food Products Company used many new machines. According to Senators from the machinery sector, this equipment wasn't even as good as a small food factory's equipment from the 90s—at best "bootleg workshop" level.

But even "bootleg workshop" level semi-mechanized, semi-manual labor required training workers from scratch. The Lingao Machinery Factory that sold him the equipment naturally sent people to train him, but once the naturalized training masters left, he started getting headaches. The freshly minted operators had little practical experience and only half-understood the operational procedures. All sorts of accidents occurred, equipment kept breaking and being repaired, starting and stopping. They rarely reached full capacity. Worker injuries also cost him plenty in medicine fees. Several had crushed fingers or broken arms. Originally, he wanted to just give them some money and send them home, but Senator Hong said it would "look bad" and told him to keep them at the factory doing odd jobs within their ability.

This was still secondary. In the past, Zhang Yu's family had only run a small shop, with just two or three people including assistants and apprentices. Even when the scale grew larger, there were only about ten or so staff. The whole family could handle it. Now his factory had over two hundred workers alone. Several workshops, two or three warehouses, raw materials and finished products coming and going numbered in the tens of thousands daily. There was a severe shortage of managers.

Following traditional business practice, naturally, family members and relatives would be employed first. But Zhang Yu obviously couldn't manage with just family. First, his parents needed to watch the old shop. Second, the Zhang family wasn't populous and didn't have any capable people. His only uncle by blood was a waiter at a teahouse. The couple also worked for his father. Their one daughter, Zhang Ting, was exceptionally clever, but sadly there was just this one. She was now Zhang's Food Products' accountant, simultaneously managing the old shop's accounts too—completely unable to split herself. Besides, she was just an unmarried young lady who couldn't show her face in public.

Zhang Yu's mother wasn't local, so he couldn't count on his maternal uncle's family. Although he had written a letter asking them to "come to Guangzhou quickly," the journey was long and chaotic with war, not something he could count on immediately.

This kept Zhang Yu busy running around in circles, wishing he could split into several bodies. The factory was producing while simultaneously "leaking." Zhang Yu knew full well the losses were severe but had to tough it out and maintain production. Fortunately, at this time Gao Ju wanted to win him over and helped him hire several experienced managers, reorganizing the factory and finally getting operations roughly straightened out.

Second was the cash crunch.

Zhang's Food Products Company receiving a big order from Joint Logistics was naturally a good thing. But funding pressure came with it. With the Zhang family's original financial strength, they fundamentally couldn't have taken an order of this scale. It was entirely thanks to Hong Huangnan putting in a word at Delong Bank, using "Zhang's Old Shop" as collateral, that he got a large loan—only then did he have the startup capital to buy land and equipment.

Following proper lending procedures, this loan's collateral was obviously unqualified. Even with Hong Huangnan's guarantee, both Yan Ming and Meng Xian were very hesitant. In the end, it was reported to Wen Desi, who made the final decision to grant it as a special loan in the name of "supporting private sector benchmark enterprises."

Such loans with almost no collateral had been issued several times in total. The accumulated figure had reached a level that made Zhang Yu feel scared.

"What if I can't repay the loans?" This thought had been swirling in his mind lately. The orders from Joint Logistics were getting bigger and bigger. He had no choice but to continuously expand scale, increase equipment, and hire more workers. The account payables for purchasing raw materials were also getting larger and larger.

Every time he looked at the account books Zhang Ting gave him, Zhang Yu had a feeling: after all this busy work, besides a pile of receivables and payables and that constantly expanding factory, he hadn't made any money at all.

Although Joint Logistics gave him orders on very favorable cash-on-delivery terms, he could only get payment after delivery. The Food Products Company's advance production costs were also staggering. Currently, the supply arrangement between him and suppliers still followed the old rule of "settling accounts at the three festivals." This somewhat relieved Zhang's Food Products Company's funding pressure. But as orders kept increasing, suppliers also began complaining bitterly: they couldn't hold on anymore—most suppliers had never encountered a customer of Zhang's scale.

In the past month alone, quite a few suppliers had come, either sending intermediaries to plead or personally coming to beg face-to-face, hoping he could pay some of the account balances appropriately. Some begged pitifully, almost kneeling and kowtowing to him. Some were old customers of the shop who came to plead through his parents. Some came through Zeng Juan's connections... In short, the Eight Immortals crossed the sea, each showing their talents—making things very difficult for Zhang Yu.

Due to personal relationships and moral obligations, Zhang Yu couldn't refuse harshly. He could only deal with each party a bit, using delaying tactics.

After this round of delaying tactics, Zhang Ting gave him some very bad news. According to current delivery plans, receivables and payables, cash flow... calculated out, the 1636 Lunar New Year's Eve would be very difficult to get through.

According to Zhang Ting's calculations, from now until New Year's Eve, there could be no more large expenditures. Moreover, the year-end bonus originally planned to be given to employees on New Year's Eve would have to be delayed until after the first month. Only then could Zhang's Food Products Company just barely pay all account payables and bank interest, avoiding the huge news of being unable to pay.

Although Zhang Yu came from a small business family background, he fully understood the value of the word "credit." Back then on New Year's, when his father had no cash on hand, he would rather pawn his mother's jewelry and his own longevity lock to pay for goods—Zhang Yu remembered all these past events clearly. His father had said: in business, as long as you have credit, even if you lose money you can still get by. Once you lose credit, nothing works anymore.

Please don't let there be any extra expenses. Zhang Yu silently prayed in his heart. He really couldn't take any more stimulation right now. However, troublesome things still came one after another. Just yesterday, he had received a message from Gao Ju, saying the Senate's newly established Nanyang Company was preparing to offer stocks and sell bonds, asking if he was interested in participating—if so, roughly how much money was he prepared to put in, so Gao Ju could have an idea to prepare.
