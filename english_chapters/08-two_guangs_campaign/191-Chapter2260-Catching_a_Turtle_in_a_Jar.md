# Chapter 2260: Catching a Turtle in a Jar

Xie Wendong bowed his head to listen to his instructions. As each point was explained, he couldn't help but be secretly alarmed: this Advisor Zhan was indeed insidious!

"...Do you understand?"

"Yes, the small one understands." Xie Wendong said, "The small one will go arrange it right away!"

Feng Haijiao led the main force stumbling forward in Huangdan Gully. Because food was insufficient, they had to stop for a day on the road to let some porters return to Hu Bay to fetch grain supplies. When they reached the Great West Gate, it was actually a day later than Zhan Zhekun predicted. Stumbling with great difficulty to the front of the Great West Gate, men and horses were already exhausted.

At the foot of the mountain, more than ten water vats, filled with herbal tea, had been prepared very properly.

"Greeting Master." Huang Daqiao, ordered to welcome here, had a face full of smiles. "Manager Xin sent the small one to welcome Master. Please rest here for a moment with your brothers, Master, before going up the mountain; it's not too late." After saying this, he waved his hand, and servants served a table of cold meat dishes with eight bowls and eight plates.

"This is a small token from Manager Xin. Please use some snacks first, Master and your precious family."

Feng Haijiao sat in a sedan chair for several days, eating and sleeping makeshift; his body ached and his mouth was tasteless. Seeing Xin Laonan so attentive, he didn't feel suspicious, but rather very comfortable, thinking this old fellow was quite sensible!

Here servants served several trays again, which were bright shining two hundred taels of silver.

"This is a little greeting gift from Master Zhan to the brothers."

Seeing Xin and Zhan so attentive, Feng Haijiao felt they must be afraid of him, hence trying their best to fawn. He was complacent in his heart and said, "Too polite! You go tell the two that I am resting here for a moment and will go up the mountain to visit right away."

Huang Daqiao responded "Yes" and was about to withdraw. Feng Haijiao suddenly stopped him and asked, "How has Manager Xin been recently?"

"Thanks to Master Feng's blessing," Huang Daqiao paused, "Manager Xin, his old man's body is still tough, just his legs and feet are slightly inconvenient."

This was Xin Laonan’s old injury, which was why he washed his hands in a golden basin a few years ago.

"No headaches or brain fevers?"

"Master Feng really loves to joke," Huang Daqiao smiled apologetically, "Fine weather, neither cold nor hot, how come suddenly a headache or brain fever..."

Feng Haijiao didn't smile. A pair of yellow eyes stared dead at Huang Daqiao. Only after a long time did he suddenly beam and say, "I am just worried about my old partner."

"Many thanks to Master Feng." Huang Daqiao paid respects again and slowly retreated.

Feng Haijiao’s probe just now didn't reveal anything unusual. Here the main force arrived successively. Thirsty minions cheered upon seeing clear water and were about to crowd up to drink, but were dispersed by his personal guards with whips.

"Throw his mother, rushing to be reincarnated!" While scolding, he called the doctor under him to test each vat for poison with silver needles.

Upon testing, there was no poison, so he let the minions drink. He himself wasn't at ease, so he called the doctor to test the wine and food on the banquet table sequentially. Confirming no obstruction, he sat down and began to eat and drink.

After eating and drinking, he began to arrange the matters for going up the mountain.

Although he had determined that Xin and Zhan had no conspiracy, a bachelor who had been a bandit for many years had many thoughts and had to guard against the ten thousandth chance. He immediately called his trusted aides over to arrange the mountain ascent one by one.

"We men are going up the mountain now." Feng Haijiao said to his trusted leaders, "Keep your eyes bright, every one of you! Old Man Xin although old is not muddled yet. With so many of us going up the mountain, needless to say, he has to guard against us. I feel it's awkward for everyone to guard against like this, might as well merge into one family for straightforwardness."

The leaders cheered loudly. Feng Haijiao signaled them to keep their voices down.

"Xin Laonan did business for decades, picking official merchants and large households to trade. Needless to say, there are plenty of excellent things in the manor—"

Speaking of this, the eyes of all leaders revealed greed, all somewhat eager to try. Feng Haijiao continued: "...But Old Man Xin is not a mediocrity either. That he is willing to let us up the mountain, presumably he has some preparations. You also saw, the terrain of this Thunder Struck Slope is precipitous. We cannot act rashly. You must all act according to my instructions."

After saying these few sentences, he dispatched his subordinates one by one. He had walked the road up the mountain and knew roughly that the key terrain depended on the three gates starting from the Great West Gate. So he sent three capable subordinates, each leading twenty minions, to stay put after passing each stockade gate.

"Each stockade gate is guarded by people from Xin Family Manor, not many. You just stay put and watch them. If they ask, say you are looking after the follow-up team transporting wealth. As long as they don't drive you away, don't fight them. Avoid making noise to alarm the mountain."

These troops were his direct line. Letting them control the stockade gates was equivalent to controlling the road up and down the mountain. Attack to advance, run to retreat; he, Feng Haijiao, would stand in an invincible position. If Xin Laonan was honest, fine; if there were any schemes and plots, in the worst case, he could pull the team and run.

In this way, his direct troops remaining were less than fifty. But considering Xin Laonan’s able-bodied men were no more than twenty or thirty, and although Zhan Zhekun had thirty-some people, he was an outsider and completely unnecessary to stand up for a powerless Xin Laonan—after all, since Sun Dabiao was finished, he was the biggest strength faction in the three Yangshan counties, and Advisor Zhan still counted on him to fight the Hair thieves.

If he refused a toast only to drink a forfeit, eating him wouldn't be hard; after all, he had absolute superiority in military force.

He calculated in his heart again and again; this matter was a sure win for him.

After dispatching his subordinates, Feng Haijiao ate and drank some more. It wasn't until gradually noon that he saw Bi Xuansheng riding a nag, lazily catching up from behind.

Although he was no longer as guarded in his heart as at the beginning, he always treated him as an "outsider," so for this relocation, he sent him to bring up the rear escorting property.

Escorting property and grain was exhausting and responsible. If this kid Bi Xuansheng could do it, he might as well promote him more in the future.

He didn't greet Bi Xuansheng, only called a minion:

"Pass my order to Advisor Bi, say he worked hard escorting luggage. The moving brothers and everyone's families are also tired. Let them rest at the foot of the mountain for an hour (two hours) before going up the mountain; it's not too late."

Next, he called Mo Chong:

"You take a hundred newly joined brothers and follow behind the central army up the mountain. If there are changes ahead, you immediately bring people to rush over to support!"

"Yes, Master!"

"Up the mountain!"

In the temple hall, people reported Feng Haijiao’s movements continuously. Zhan Zhekun’s mood was slightly nervous. Looking at Yang *Juren*, however, he was chatting and laughing nonchalantly. He couldn't help admiring secretly—worthy of being a figure who could command wind and clouds in Guangning!

Thinking of this, he forced himself to calm his mind, putting on a calm and composed expression, unwilling to let Yang *Juren* look down on him.

"Reporting to the two Masters, Master Feng has already passed the second stockade gate."

"Did he leave people at the stockade gate?"

"He did! Only the distance is far, small one couldn't see clearly, about twenty or thirty people."

"How many people are around him now?"

"Small one counted, fifty or sixty people."

"These are probably all his direct line." Yang Jinghui said.

"Are there follow-up troops?"

"There are about a hundred people, following to climb the mountain, but haven't passed the second gate yet."

"This Feng Haijiao is really a slick old fox." Yang Jinghui laughed, "It's hard on him too, arranging quite tightly."

"If he weren't a slick old fox, how would he be willing to eat my fragrant bait?" Zhan Zhekun was confident at this moment.

Feng Haijiao led the team, full of ambition, climbing the mountain and passing checkpoints all the way without obstruction. Of the two stockade gates passed, only the first had twenty able-bodied men guarding, the second simply had two old men watching. And no one dared to object when he left people behind.

Seeing the main gate was just ahead, once past this gate, Thunder Struck Slope would have no danger to defend. Xin Family Manor would be in his bag.

The more he thought, the more proud he became. Seeing a few more tenants coming respectfully to welcome him ahead.

"Where is your Manager Xin?"

"The Manager is waiting in front of the temple, waiting to wash the dust for the Master." The tenant smiled apologetically.

Feng Haijiao nodded. Reaching the mountaintop, he saw open space all around. Only seven or eight tenants guarded the main gate, and more than ten people worked in the paddy fields. Birds in the mountain forest were not startled, obviously no large troops were hidden. His heart settled a few points more.

Arriving in front of the temple, he saw Zhan Zhekun with a face full of spring breeze, welcoming in front of the temple, surrounded by no more than three or four attendants. He couldn't help but be secretly suspicious, arched his hands in return and said: "Where is Manager Xin?"

"Manager Xin had an old injury flare up these days, inconvenient to move, waiting in the hall." Zhan Zhekun smiled. Feng Haijiao felt vaguely uneasy, but relying on the thirty or forty minions around him, all his direct trusted aides, even if there was an ambush inside, they could protect him to charge out, so he said carelessly: "In that case, let's go inside to talk again!" After saying this, he signaled his subordinates with his eyes and followed Zhan Zhekun in.

His subordinates immediately followed in. However, the temple itself was not big. Once dozens of people came in, the courtyard was immediately packed full. The main gate of the main hall was open. Xin Laonan was sitting in front of the Buddha statue in the hall. Although not seeing clearly, his complexion seemed not bad. There were only a few attendants in the hall too. Feng Haijiao’s heart settled greatly. Smiling, he raised his head and entered the hall, laughing: "Manager Xin, I trust you have been well since we parted..."

Before his voice finished, he only heard a gust of wind behind him, followed by a loud bang, dust flying. Feng Haijiao was startled. Just about to turn his head, he felt heat on his face, as if splashed with hot water. However, the special sticky feeling made him immediately realize: This is human blood!

Feng Haijiao turned pale with fright. looking back, he saw the four attendants who followed him closely into the main hall had all been killed on the ground. The originally open main gate of the main hall was also closed tightly, and a few minions were putting the top door bar on.

Outside were the wild shouts and desperate door-banging sounds of the minions he brought. Feng Haijiao wanted to draw his sword, but was forced not to dare move by several long spears.

He forced himself to be calm and roared: "Surname Xin, what is your meaning?!"
