# Chapter 2282: Secrets of the Boudoir (1)

This "Australian Hanfu" produced by No. 82, although style similar to Ming Dynasty, used modern cutting technology; wearing was more fitting and beautiful, using top quality fabric too. Plus a set of magnificent handmade hairpins. Cai Lan dressing up was extremely stunning.

Jiang Qiuchan was somewhat surprised; Cai Lan’s attitude towards Senator Xie’s visit, although couldn't use "Ice Cold" to describe, had quite some perfunctoriness. Bathing and changing clothes quite reluctant; combing makeup done hastily. How come today had meaning of "Makeup for One Who Pleases Oneself"?

What exactly did Mr. Hao say to her, making such big change in her state of mind?

"Aunt, is this clothes good looking?"

"Wearing on Miss body, nothing more suitable." Qiuchan praised sincerely; sure enough was "People need clothes, Buddha needs gold"! Cai Lan originally was just middle appearance; even Qiuchan didn't understand why Australian would be so attentive to her. Now this attentive dressing up, indeed different!

Corner of Cai Lan’s mouth revealed smile slightly; Qiuchan for first time seeing her having such smile these days, unconsciously full belly of suspicion, dared not ask much either.

Xie Erren came to Three Headquarters sitting in sedan chair. Every time he came to Cai Lan’s place was dusk falling; at this time basically had no pedestrian on street.

Usually he coming to Three Headquarters, always went to inspect National Army stationed here and naturalized citizen personnel of various organs first. But coming to Cai Lan’s place, he went nowhere else; sedan chair entered directly from corner gate, getting off sedan directly in Cai Lan’s yard.

Earlier when he came here, Cai Lan was very cold, let alone coming out to welcome. Recently he discovered this woman was passionate to him a bit; seemed to have some attachment emotionally too. This made Xie Erren secretly proud; sure enough picking up girls still had to depend on "Soft Grinding" Kung Fu.

Today once he got off sedan, Cai Lan already stood before steps, bowing body deeply curtseying.

"Master Ten Thousand Blessings..."

Xie Erren waved hand, didn't speak any words, walked directly into main room. He unbuttoned outer cotton cadre uniform taking off coat. A maid hurriedly came up to receive, propping open with bamboo hanger hanging on coat rack. Another maid fetched straw slippers for him to change on.

"Bath water already heated, please Master change clothes enter bath." Cai Lan said in low voice.

Xie Erren sat in enamel bathtub, lighting a cigar, bathing while appreciating small yard outside window: bathroom was designed and rebuilt by himself; below enamel bathtub was heating chamber, burning fire from outside to heat air then heat whole bathroom and bathtub; this way neither "Boiling Living Person," nor could heat air of whole bathroom—although right now was summer, but estimating he had to work here for a year or two anyway; Wuzhou in Little Ice Age probably wouldn't be warm either.

Opposite bathtub inlaid glass transported from Lingao; outside window was a less than two square meters "Japanese Style Courtyard" built under his own design and supervision. White sand, flake stones, water bowl, grass and trees embellished exquisitely. While bathing smoking while appreciating, letting spirit and body both relax, liberating him from busy official business of daytime. Letting him restore from a Senator, Wuzhou Regional Director... to an ordinary man.

Finished bathing, he changed into silk pajamas specially supplied by No. 82, coming to main room. Maids and servants all avoided already, leaving main room; a kerosene lamp lit snow bright.

A table of wine and dishes not much quantity, but quite exquisite. Cai Lan poured wine for him; Xie Erren drank a few mouthfuls, only felt comfortable all over.

Looks like, still better coming out for external post; where in Lingao had such particular enjoyment! Xie Erren’s originally soaring grievance also calmed down slightly. Looking at Cai Lan serving head bowed aside, also felt gentler and more beautiful than past; his mood greatly good, casually asked:

"Few days ago, you went to Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense?"

"Yes, Slave Maid went."

"Dragon Mother Temple side, how was situation?"

"Actually quiet." Cai Lan said.

"Oh," Xie Erren got interest, "How about common people?"

"Generally passable." Cai Lan said, "Just..."

"Just what?" Xie Erren got interest; usually he talking with Cai Lan was one ask one answer; rarely heard Cai Lan having own expression.

"All say grain too expensive." Cai Lan said, "Abbot Wu Yuan spoke to me, saying outside security not good, tenants unwilling to pay rent; this year grain afraid can't count on; rice on market expensive again, about to afford no more."

"Doesn't their temple also have registered residence rice to buy?"

"This Slave Maid doesn't know..."

Abbot Wu Yuan indeed said this to her; purpose nothing more than hoping Cai Lan could blow pillow wind to Director Xie, seeing if could strive for some benefits for temple—fawning on favored concubines of high officials and noble families was a method temple tried repeatedly effectively.

"This doesn't count anything. Endure a few more months, ground all quiets down, naturally can collect rent." Xie Erren talk interest burst at this moment, "Besides not long later huge batch of grain arrives Wuzhou, grain price will drop immediately. Need not worry!"

Second day after Xie Erren visited, arrived Qiuchan’s rest day again. Jiang Qiuchan’s maiden family was right in Wuzhou city, opening a silk satin shop named "Ruijintang," not counting big business, but also a century old brand inheriting, family bottom quite substantial.

Qiuchan’s father already passed away; only old mother in hall; one managing family business was eldest brother Jiang Rongxian.

At this moment this Jiang family head was sitting straight in accounting room behind brand, eyebrows frowning not spreading.

Hearing family member say sister returned, he nodded slightly, threw account book flipped countless times in hand onto table, worrying secretly.

Seeing Mid-Autumn right before eyes, people owing owing people all had to settle clear one by one. Dragon Boat Festival season encountered right after war chaos; shop damaged, households fled. So various families didn't clear accounts. Seeing two more months would be Mid-Autumn; this time, account must be calculated.

Account book was sent by accountant; he flipped countless times, also flipped on abacus countless times. Worrying was not loss—doing business profit and loss were common things. But this situation of having output no input right now.

"Ruijintang" in Wuzhou battle three months ago also suffered robbery; funds in shop almost all plundered by government with various names, loss quite heavy. Finally shop and goods still preserved, not yet bankrupt.

Just now although Wuzhou market recovered somewhat, silk satin this thing was business good to do when under heaven peaceful; right now Two Guangs situation, ordinary people livelihood difficult, rich people because repeatedly suffering disasters, unwilling to spend money either. Desolateness of business could be imagined.

Business bad, expenses not few. According to Senator Xie’s instruction, no business had to open shop too, not allowed to lay off partners, all had to feed—although not paying wages, feeding these people was also an expense. Jiang family had numerous relatives in Wuzhou; Wuzhou battle, relatives friends bankrupt were not few, coming to beg help one after another. Out of face, Jiang family more or less had to help a bit. Plus after Wuzhou recovered Senator Xie’s "New Policy," all apportioned to various trading firms by Aftermath Bureau. Jiang family only had output, no input; Jiang Rongxian’s worry could be imagined.

Happened at this time, own sister’s husband was killed by chaotic soldiers again; at time of military chaos dared not return to husband family either, bringing child lodging in home. He as elder brother was duty-bound; helpless wife in home wasn't this virtuous, seeing this sister-in-law living in home for three months, had complaints—fortunately recently sister got a job, earning one tael silver back every month, ears finally idle quite a bit.

Deficit before eyes, deducting those on accounts, he himself had a secret account in heart bottom; calculating down generally, probably less than two thousand taels, one thousand big number was there.

His gaze returned to account book, gutting intestines scraping belly looking at which could be "dealt with," which must be paid.

Fortunately, payment for upstream goods he headache most could delay a bit. Silk satin suppliers were all in Guangzhou Prefecture. In past all sent people to Wuzhou; after collecting debt used silver to purchase goods in Wuzhou, then transport back to Guangzhou to sell, could earn money twice. Now road not peaceful, upstream unlikely to risk wealth being robbed sending people to collect debt.

Like this, could subtract nearly one thousand taels payable. Remaining seven or eight hundred taels, some must pay, some greatly could drag first; calculating back and forth, had about five hundred taels silver to pass barrier.

Money, he naturally still had. Shop, home accounting room still stored more than three hundred taels silver. Mother and wife concubine hands had some private savings more or less. Pooling up five hundred taels to deal wasn't hard. But like this, shop and home would have no cash—goods in shop couldn't move; couldn't take satin to offset rice money—rice shop wouldn't agree either.

Thinking of rice shop, remembered home fingers numerous; eating rice every month was a huge expense. "Ruijintang" used six partners and three apprentices. Home had five male and female servants. Just buying rice every month was a huge number—happened grain price flying up again! Even "Registered Residence Rice" calculated mouth sold in Australian yamen was two three times more expensive than pre-war.

These days of military chaos horse confusion, when would be a head!

Jiang Rongxian calculated again and again in heart; debt needed to pay still couldn't lack one tael silver. He unconsciously felt irritable—best right now could make a fortune of several hundred taels silver!

Thinking here, he unconsciously smiled bitterly: didn't expect himself surprisingly would have such absurd thought!

He suddenly remembered a matter; own sister now was serving as accompanying woman for Australian Senator Xie’s "Concubine." This concubine was said to be very favored by "True Hair"—if could find some way from this woman, could blow pillow wind giving own family some business then would be good...

But he thought depressingly again, own business was silk satin; this thing Australians right now basically couldn't use, not interested either.

Speaking of doing what making money most now, needless to say was grain business. Grain shortage in Wuzhou city; price of non-tiger mouth rice already doubled compared to normal price; if anyone could get grain at this time, immediately was double profit!
