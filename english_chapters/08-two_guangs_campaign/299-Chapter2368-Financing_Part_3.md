# Chapter 2368: Financing (Part 3)

Chu He frowned deeply, thinking why there was such a thing; nothing had been done yet, and they started fighting among themselves first. The Nanyang Company hadn't even taken shape yet, but conflicts had already arisen with the Political Affairs Yuan. How to proceed? He had suspected before that there were other reasons why his proposal was ignored besides his own obscurity. Now it seemed that he released this proposal at the wrong time, and it was not surprising that he was regarded as someone jumping on the Southbound Faction's bandwagon. What should be done now? Chu He fell silent.

Seeing Chu He silent, Sun Butao didn't disturb his thinking, waving to call the waiter to add two bottles of grape soda on the table. After a while, Chu He looked up and said: "Damn it, if the Political Affairs Yuan doesn't care about this, I'll go to Zhou Wei. Since he asked for the policy, he has nothing but policy now. I don't believe he isn't worried about money now. I don't care what conflict there is between the Southbound Faction and the Political Affairs Yuan. Anyway, I brought the financing plan. Whoever wants to use it, give me a position to sit."

Sun Butao smiled and said: "I think it will work, but you have to hurry. Zhou Wei is busy as a beaver now, running back and forth between Lingao, Guangzhou, Sanya, and Danzhou several times. He is also visiting Senators everywhere in Lingao to build relationships. He won't have time to pay attention to this for a while. Wait until he is free; he himself is from a finance major background, said to be a Ph.D. If you go late, I'm afraid he will finish it himself."

"Is that so?!" Chu He only remembered that this person worked in the Ministry of Colonial Trade and was some kind of division chief, but he didn't expect him to be a peer!

"His wife is also from a finance background, now the Director of the Currency Division of the Central Reserve Bank. Don't they know the tricks of financial migrant workers better than others?"

"Damn, now that you say it, I have to hurry!" Although Chu He said so, his heart sank. Speaking of academic qualifications, seniority, and professional ability, this Zhou Wei might be a large cut above him. His stuff might not necessarily enter his eyes.

Seeing his face darken, Sun Butao, also from a financial migrant worker background, was the most clever. He immediately knew Chu He's thoughts. He encouraged him:
"Zhou Wei is a big leader now; he can't do everything himself. There are many people around him now, but I don't know anyone who can help him with financing. Brother Chu, if you go to him, it will be exactly what he wants. Maybe this task will be left for you to carry in the end."

This reminded him that just because Party A is an expert doesn't mean they don't need Party B; otherwise, wouldn't Party A just finish it themselves? Besides, his ambition was to engage in the stock exchange, not to be a worker for the Nanyang Company. Thinking of this, his spirits lifted, and he asked:
"Where is Zhou Wei now? Danzhou?"
"He just returned from Danzhou a few days ago, and seems to have gone to Guangzhou recently. But you have to consult the General Office about this; they keep track of all Senators' whereabouts."
"Okay, if he went to Guangzhou, then I'll go to Guangzhou tomorrow too!" Chu He said and was about to get up.
"What's the rush?" Sun Butao grabbed him, "Zhou Wei can't run away. You reveal the bottom line to your brother first—selling the plan so hard, you don't want to be a financial consultant for the Nanyang Company, do you?"
"Being a financial consultant for the Nanyang Company, I might as well stay on Jeju Island..."
"That's right," Sun Butao looked around and lowered his voice, "You have to have some ambition. Let me give you a tip. Big Boss Cheng recently said at the Senator Cadre Regular Meeting of the Ministry of Finance and Economy: At present, we are still very primitive in the securities and financial field, and support for the financing needs of enterprises of various ownerships is too little. We must focus on improvement..."
"Did he really say that?!" Chu He's eyes widened instantly—this was a very obvious signal.
"Mm." Sun Butao nodded, "I can tell you another piece of news..."
"Say it quickly, brother! Don't squeeze toothpaste!"
"Zhou Wei's wife is also eligible to attend the Senator Cadre Regular Meeting of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. So he knows exactly what you are thinking now. You have a number in your heart. I'm afraid the asking price won't be too low."
"Damn, I give him a plan for free, and he still asks for a price?"
"There are many people who can come up with plans; there are quite a few senior financial migrant workers in our Senate." Sun Butao said, "As far as I know: you are not the only one currently coming up with financing plans intending to use this to test the waters. Your plan must cater to his likes..."
"Thank you so much." Chu He shook his hand tightly.

That night, Chu He contacted the General Office, confirming that Zhou Wei was in Guangzhou and had no new travel plans recently. He immediately asked the General Office to book him the earliest fast passenger ship to Guangzhou tomorrow morning.
Two days later, Chu He stepped onto the Guangzhou Great World Pier.
Of course, by the standards of this spacetime, Guangzhou could be called "slightly damaged" this time.
However, arriving in Guangzhou this time, he could feel that the city had begun to recover—after all, this was the largest city in South China. The piers along the way were noisy with people, and masts stood like forests. The sound of steam cranes working was deafening, and scenes of loading and unloading were everywhere. A wide variety of industrial products produced in Lingao and bags of military supplies were unloaded and transshipped. Pig iron, porcelain, tea, and other materials transported from the mainland were immediately loaded onto ships and transported away. The endless stream of shipping showed that the largest city under the rule of the Senate was emerging from the impact.

The pier for fast passenger ships was the Senator-exclusive pier of Guangzhou Great World, also known as the "Inner World Pier." Landing from here, one could directly walk through the Senator-exclusive passage into the part of Guangzhou Great World not open to the public.
Since Chu He came to Guangzhou for private action and deliberately kept a low profile, only asking the General Office to send a simple "Senator Itinerary" notification telegram, no Senator greeted him at the pier, only three staff members of the Great World were welcoming.

"Welcome Senator Chu to Guangzhou, Guangzhou Great World welcomes your arrival. I am Xiao Gao, Deputy Manager of Guangzhou First Guesthouse. I hope you don't mind our simple welcoming ceremony, we will wholeheartedly..."
Chu He didn't care about this pomp and interrupted: "Does Senator Zhou Wei live in the guesthouse? Where is he now?" After speaking, he walked inside.
Deputy Manager Gao was obviously choked, but he was accustomed to the Senator's straightforwardness. While signaling the waiter to take the luggage, he followed up and said: "Senator Zhou lives here, but he is in the city now and may not come back until evening—or maybe not come back."
Chu He asked while walking: "Where is his secretary? Is there anyone around him currently in the Great World?"
Deputy Manager Gao hesitated and replied: "Uh... it seems Senator Zhou's Secretary Zhou is here now."
Chu He turned his head and said to Pu Zhixian: "Go find this Secretary Zhou and ask her if she received the telegram I sent to Senator Zhou the day before yesterday. Give her the summary in your bag and tell her: I have urgent business with Senator Zhou. Let her notify you as soon as Senator Zhou comes back."
"Yes, I'll go right away."

It was also Chu He's first time coming to Guangzhou Great World. To be honest, the appearance of this Great World was somewhat like the large comprehensive commercial markets he had visited in some third or fourth-tier small county towns before.
"Please come this way." Deputy Manager Gao led the way in front.
The First Guesthouse was specially designed to host Senators and high-ranking naturalized cadres, occupying a part of the second floor of the East Wing Building of the Inner World Building, with more than twenty guest rooms. All came with their own bathroom facilities.
Chu He was led to a first-class room by Deputy Manager Gao. This kind of room was a suite. In addition to the bedroom, there was a living room that also functioned as a study. The decoration was luxurious, and the bathroom was also the standard decoration of the bathroom for Senator residences decorated by the General Office, which was about the same as the furnishings in Chu He's home in Jeju.
On the table was a large plate of welcome fruits—in this era where greenhouses were not popularized, only Guangzhou adjacent to Hainan had the condition to supply fruits in winter.
The waiter put down the luggage and immediately withdrew.
Deputy Manager Gao handed the key to Chu He: "Your guard's room is in the entourage dormitory on the first floor. Rope number one by the desk leads directly to his dormitory room. Number two by the bed leads to the main service desk. If you want to go out for a walk, you can call a car at the front desk. Although the epidemic in Guangzhou has basically ended now, it is still not recommended for you to go to crowded places. Currently, Guangzhou urban area belongs to the Yellow Zone, and the Senator security standard is a minimum of two people. I see you only brought one. Please notify us in advance before you go out, and we will equip you with guards."
"Okay."
"Do you have any other needs now?" Deputy Manager Gao asked.
"No more, thank you." Chu He said.
"Then I won't disturb you." Deputy Manager Gao said while retreating. Before going out the door, as if remembering something, he said: "By the way, there is a service item list of our Great World in the drawer, some of which are quite distinctive," after speaking, he was about to push out, but suddenly remembered something else and asked:
"How do you plan to arrange dinner?"
"Just give me a set meal directly, no need to order dishes."
"Yes, we will arrange it for you now." Saving so, he closed the door and withdrew.
"Hehe, the General Office is really particular nowadays..." Chu He muttered to himself, "It has a bit of the meaning of a star-rated hotel."

Chu He opened the drawer and saw multiple service categories such as catering, entertainment, consumption, and tourism written on the list. Whether it was food delivery, Karaoke, watching movies, shopping guides, local guides, or some unmentionable items, all were available. Of course, some items needed to be enjoyed at the Purple Ming Pavilion and were not directly provided here. Naturally, the prices also belonged to potential prices that only Senators could afford.
"This Liu Xiang engages in all these things; really low taste." Chu He slandered secretly. Naturally, he was in financial difficulties now, so he had to make up for it in various aspects, which was not incomprehensible. However, the key was to dig the silver out of the hands of the local old money in Guangzhou; that was the serious business.
Talking about digging out the hoard of old money, in his opinion, Liu Xiang did not do enough. Since he couldn't do it, let him help Governor Liu with such a small favor. He would definitely be infinitely grateful to him.
