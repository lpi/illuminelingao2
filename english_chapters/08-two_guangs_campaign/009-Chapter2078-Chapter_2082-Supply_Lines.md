# Chapter 2078 - Supply Lines

"How is it? Good tea, isn't it? Spoils from the front—supposedly tribute grade." Hong Huangnan sat down across from him. "I'm preparing to ship a batch back to Lingao for everyone to try."

Xi Yazhou found it hard to understand the man before him. Was this "enjoyment attitude," regardless of occasion, a genuine character trait or a facade of "going along with the world"?

"That's not urgent. Let's discuss the logistics situation first."

"The current situation is that our supply stations can't keep pace with the troops' advance." Hong Huangnan said, "As we anticipated, the speed of advance depends on how fast the troops can march. But for now, supply difficulties aren't severe."

According to Hong Huangnan's pre-planned logistics scheme, all of Guangdong Province served as the Huanan Army's depot zone. The zone headquarters and main depot were in Sanshui, with supply stations established along both waterways and postal roads.

Because of the natural river systems—the West, North, and East Rivers—the Huanan Army units were basically advancing along these three waterways. Even for counties not directly on the rivers, the principle was to use water transport wherever the waterways could accommodate small landing craft.

The advantages were obvious: soldiers could conserve maximum energy; attached artillery could advance with the troops; units could carry more rations and ammunition. Not only could small baggage for combat operations accompany the troops, but even the large baggage normally carried by logistics columns for unit food and lodging could be transported alongside, greatly simplifying departure organization.

Because preparations had been made in advance in various localities, during the Pearl River Delta advance, troops along the way barely needed Joint Logistics resupply. First, ammunition consumption was minimal. Second, the grain, salt, and even firewood needed by troops had already been arranged by Joint Logistics. Dachang organized personnel to transport "reasonable burdens" collected in various areas and rent-rice gathered by Wansheng Rental Yards to transport nodes. Troops collected these with triplicate requisition forms. Dachang also organized local women to cook meals per Joint Logistics requirements: once cooked, the rice was doused with salt water, mixed, wrapped in reed or bamboo leaves as rice balls, and handed to passing troops.

Waterborne troops received rice balls and ate them on the boats while advancing, supplemented by dried radish strips, pickles, and other quick foods they carried. Though calories and protein were slightly insufficient, there was virtually no physical activity on the boats, so not much energy was needed.

Troops advancing along postal roads were resupplied by the same method. But this local procurement became impossible west and north of Sanshui—because during the Guangzhou campaign, the Fubo Army had operated mainly in the Pearl River Delta, reaching only as far northwest as Sanshui. Areas west and north of Sanshui had no "reasonable burden" system, and Wansheng Rental Yards had no farmland there for collecting rent.

The Council had no "liaisons" in these areas and less influence than in the Pearl River Delta. Orderly, sufficient food supply would have to depend on Joint Logistics.

Therefore, Joint Logistics leveraged the advantage of high ship carrying capacity. Not only did each waterborne company stockpile ammunition at the "light three, heavy two" standard, but beyond the two-day "emergency rations" each soldier carried personally, each company's large baggage also carried ten days of "marching rations."

"By comparison, troops advancing along roads have more supply problems," Hong Huangnan said. "According to our establishment, each company's large baggage should carry six days of marching rations. But due to our chronic shortage of mules and transport vehicles, we've had to have soldiers carry the rations themselves. This greatly increases their load. Moreover, limited by stamina, the ration contents are simplified—they contain no meat or bean products, very few dried vegetables—just enough to ensure calories and minerals."

"In other words, troops advancing along postal roads have at most eight days of sustained combat capability," Xi Yazhou said.

"Theoretically, yes," Hong Huangnan said. "But once troops start supplementing through captures and temporary requisitions en route, sustained operations can last longer. However, we can't estimate such resupply efficiency. It's entirely luck—good luck, and you eat all the way; bad luck, and it's feast or famine, possibly going several days without food—completely running out."

When armies passed through, locals' natural tendency was to flee—especially in areas that knew little about the Council or the Fubo Army. When people fled, they'd take as much property and food as possible; what they couldn't carry, they'd bury. Without encountering people, you couldn't buy food. Passing troops moved too quickly to conduct thorough searches. Aside from procuring food in towns, rural areas offered no guarantee of local supply. Thus Hong Huangnan needed to establish depots at key overland transport nodes.

He explained on the wall map the depots already opened and those planned, along with related supply routes. Xi Yazhou studied it carefully and commented:

"It looks like quite a challenge."

"For now, the problems aren't too serious. Most units' advances don't face major enemy concentrations; there's no need to establish long-term supply systems. As long as we can safely deliver the National Army companies and cadres meant to take over the counties, we've achieved our objective. The difficulty is maintaining the transport lines afterward."

"As our troops push farther and deeper inland, transport difficulties will become more pronounced," Hong Huangnan said. "Although Guangdong's eighty-five prefectures and counties are all connected by postal roads, most road conditions are poor. Some remote and mountainous postal roads have fallen into disrepair, barely passable on foot, let alone by vehicles—without road repairs, even a wheelbarrow can't pass."

Hong Huangnan now understood why his "4S Horse-carriage Service" plan hadn't been approved. Setting aside the inland and remote areas with poor road conditions, even in the Pearl River Delta—the area with the best roads he'd encountered—many stretches could barely accommodate carriages. The problem was that postal road bridges mostly hadn't been designed for vehicle traffic. And the Pearl River Delta was famous for its many waterways. Almost every three to five *li* there was a bridge.

Some bridges spanned busy waterways and were built with high arches to allow sailing vessels to pass, creating semicircular high-arch bridges—carriages couldn't climb them, let alone handcarts. Other bridges, though not high, had very narrow decks. In many places, bridges were bamboo-and-wood construction with low load capacity.

"If we get drawn into a counterinsurgency war in the mountains—which is quite possible," Xi Yazhou said, studying the wall map, "keeping inland transport lines open becomes a real problem!"

"Maintaining transport lines requires coordinated military and political effort; Joint Logistics alone can't solve it." Hong Huangnan rubbed his head. "We'll have to divert substantial forces for patrols and garrison duty along the lines. That increases supply needs even more."

Xi Yazhou nodded. "Is traffic on the West River running smoothly?"

"So far, no serious harassment. You could say it's been smooth sailing." Hong Huangnan said, "There are many river pirates, but their fighting power is limited and their will to fight is weak. They prefer robbing civilians and merchant vessels; when they encounter armed ships, they won't risk their lives. A few commandeered civilian vessels have been attacked, but escorts drove them off. Running aground and hitting rocks are actually more common. We still don't know the local hydrology well."

"And land transport?"

"Terrible," Hong Huangnan said frankly. "Put it this way: without armed escort, you'll encounter bandits within one or two kilometers of leaving any town. Every sort of demon and devil has come out right now."

As if to confirm his words, gunfire suddenly crackled outside—sporadic. Xi Yazhou was startled. Hong Huangnan rose to look out the window. "See? River pirates again. Absolutely brazen. As soon as it gets dark, they paddle their little boats up and steal from the transport ships. Killing them doesn't help."
