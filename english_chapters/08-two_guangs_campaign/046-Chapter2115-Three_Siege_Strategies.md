# Chapter 2115 - Three Siege Strategies

Yi Haoran had barely crossed the threshold when he beheld his courtyard transformed into a tableau of supplication—kneeling civilians packed every available space.

Though none possessed official rank, these were "prominent figures" among the merchant class: mostly prosperous traders, along with several "venerable elders" whose advanced years commanded respect.

At their head knelt none other than Guild-master Qiao of the Rice Merchants' Guild.

In ordinary circumstances, Guild-master Qiao presented the picture of a well-fed, dough-faced merchant prince. Now he wore plain cotton garments and knelt at the foot of the entrance steps, wailing as though attending a funeral. The moment Yi Haoran emerged, the guild-master raised his voice in theatrical lamentation.

"Master Yi, you must save the people of this city..."

At his cry, the mob kneeling behind him erupted in collective wailing, transforming Yi Haoran's courtyard into a cemetery of living mourners.

Yi Haoran hastily returned a respectful bow. "I dare not accept such courtesy! Elders, please rise and speak plainly. This is excessive—I cannot bear such honor!"

Inwardly he puzzled over this unexpected delegation. These visitors comprised mostly local merchants, supplemented by several neighborhood headmen. Though they didn't qualify as "gentry" in the strict sense, they represented individuals of genuine standing—folk whom the prefectural and county yamen treated with considerable deference. Why had they all converged on his modest quarters to weep and wail?

His position within the Governor's staff hardly merited such attention. Originally he had been merely a "rice-stealer"—occupying space without purpose. His status ranked lower than the entertaining jesters who made jokes for the great man's amusement. Only the new army training program had elevated him to "favorite" status, with nominal responsibility for the staff's "military desk." But precisely because he dealt with military affairs, his social network consisted primarily of officers, soldiers, and civil officials. Local gentry and magnates rarely sought his counsel.

Now this delegation of "people's representatives" had sought him out specifically—obviously concerning Wuzhou's defense.

Guild-master Qiao refused to rise. He continued prostrating himself, wailing: "Master Yi, you must save the people of Wuzhou..."

"What exactly troubles you? Guild-master Qiao, please stand and explain. Whatever lies within my power, I shall exert my utmost effort."

Qiao apparently judged the theatrical moment sufficient. He struggled to his feet, wiping theatrical tears as he spoke: "Since Governor Xiong arrived with his Guangdong officials and officers, Wuzhou has exhausted itself in support. The wine, meat, and silver to reward troops, the grain and fodder the army requires—each time, we've delivered promptly without complaint. Take my humble self as example: I'm merely a rice dealer, yet I donated five hundred taels of silver and five hundred *shi* of rice. Beyond that, three thousand *shi* were requisitioned at merely one-third market value—and I dared not voice the slightest objection."

This sparked a chorus of grievances from the others. Some complained that soldiers had raided their shops demanding goods without payment, leaving them too terrified to request compensation. Others lamented the relentless requisitions—forced to acquire and deliver goods they didn't possess, daring not to fall short on any demand. Still others sobbed that soldiers had demanded women to "wash clothes"—offering maidservants proved insufficient, they wanted household women; only substantial silver bribes had finally bought reprieve.

This litany of complaints left Yi Haoran impatient—he had heard identical stories countless times. Obviously, these "notables" were establishing that they had "fulfilled their obligations" to government and army, laying groundwork for whatever request would follow.

He quickly interjected: "All these matters are known to Governor Xiong. Military affairs demand urgency; discipline has naturally suffered some degradation. The brothers have marched great distances and live perpetually on the knife's edge—minor inconveniences are inevitable. Please, elders, exercise patience." Then, lowering his voice to address Guild-master Qiao directly: "What constitutes the pressing matter?"

"Today the Governor's yamen dispatched Master Chang distributing invitations throughout the city—the Governor wishes to host a banquet for merchants and discuss the city's defense."

Yi Haoran nodded. "I've heard of this."

"If truly concerning the city's defense, we would certainly attend. But rumor suggests Master Chang has proposed three poisonous stratagems to Governor Xiong—measures that may harm the Hair-Bandits but will devastate Wuzhou's people. These are tactics that kill a thousand to wound five hundred—a ruinous, lineage-ending scheme!"

Yi Haoran's blood froze. The arson contingency had been maintained in strict secrecy. Few possessed knowledge of it. Even though most gentry had fled to countryside estates or mountain retreats, many officials holding examination degrees remained trapped within the walls. A great conflagration would certainly kill substantial numbers among them. Should anyone raise formal complaints afterward, managing the political consequences—even attempting to blame the Hair-Bandits or Wolf Soldiers—would prove extraordinarily difficult.

He hastily protested: "No such thing exists..."

Even as the denial escaped his lips, he realized his catastrophic error. Guild-master Qiao hadn't yet specified what the "three poisonous stratagems" *were*!

Sure enough, he detected a flash of cunning shrewdness in the old merchant's tear-reddened eyes.

Disaster! The fox caught that slip!

Yi Haoran scrambled to recover: "Master Chang is upright by nature—he would never propose such destructive schemes. This is merely rumor..."

Even as he spoke, his face burned with shame.

Guild-master Qiao said: "Rumor claims Master Chang advised Governor Xiong to seize all stored grain citywide, conscript every able-bodied man into militia, and expel all women, children, and elderly beyond the walls. We humble merchants find all three measures profoundly unwise!"

Hearing no mention of the arson plot, Yi Haoran exhaled quietly in relief. These three measures might indeed be genuine proposals.

As long as they weren't incinerating Wuzhou, the city could at least preserve some vitality. Expelling women and elderly was cruel, but offered them survival opportunities—the Hair-Bandits were famously "benevolent" and wouldn't slaughter civilians indiscriminately. They might even provide relief grain.

Still, since the "elders" had come seeking reassurance, he needed to offer some response.

Before he could formulate words, Guild-master Qiao continued: "What I say is true. Yet if grain is forcibly seized, the city's morale will certainly collapse entirely. Conscripting every man for defense sounds admirable, but most lack any training—on battlefields, they would simply fill mass graves. And if women, children, and elderly are expelled, which man inside these walls would risk his life defending them?"

"Master Qiao speaks with wisdom. But these remain merely rumors after all." Yi Haoran calculated: as long as you possess no concrete evidence, I'll simply insist it's unfounded rumor—what recourse do you possess?

"How can Master Yi still characterize them as rumors!" Guild-master Qiao's voice rose. "Right now, soldiers are conducting door-to-door searches for grain—so-called 'searching,' but actually looting!"

As if choreographed to validate his claim, a shrill scream suddenly echoed from the distance, then cut off with unnatural abruptness. Everyone collectively flinched.

"Master Yi! The Hair-Bandits haven't even breached the walls, yet Wuzhou is already transforming into a living hell."

Yi Haoran's eyes practically shot flames. He hadn't anticipated the situation spiraling this catastrophically beyond control. He bellowed: "Jiang Suo!"

Jiang Suo materialized instantly.

"Take your men and restore order immediately! No soldier may engage in plunder! The Governor's command token is in my study—fetch it now!"

Orders issued, he turned to Guild-master Qiao: "I knew nothing of this. Regarding the soldiers looting outside, I cannot determine whether they act under orders or purely as rioters. Please remain calm. I'm proceeding to the Governor's yamen immediately to demand explanation from Governor Xiong personally!"

"We thank Master Yi with profound gratitude." They all began prostrating themselves again. Yi Haoran had exhausted his patience for courtesies. He waved them off dismissively and commanded his people to saddle his horse.

Watching Yi Haoran and a dozen servants and guards thunder away at full gallop, the "notables" who had come to "plead" also hurried homeward—who knew what condition their own residences might be in by now? Only Guild-master Qiao and Luo Yangming, hidden within the crowd, demonstrated no urgency.

"Brother Luo, your assessment proved entirely accurate." Guild-master Qiao's expression carried equal parts fear and venomous hatred. "These officials are devoid of honor! Honey words masking hearts of stone!"

Luo Yangming felt simultaneous relief and anxiety—relief that Guild-master Qiao now fully believed him;anxiety because time was evaporating rapidly. He assumed a worried expression: "Circumstances have deteriorated to this extreme. I wonder..."

"If he possesses no honor, then I owe no loyalty," Guild-master Qiao declared flatly. "Should the Australians choose to become Emperor, what concern is that of mine?"

"Whether the Australians assume the dragon throne is irrelevant. At present, the situation demands..."

"Come with me. Let us return and deliberate in private."

Yi Haoran rode at breakneck gallop toward the Governor-General's yamen. The streets exhibited far worse disorder than previously observed. Everywhere, soldiers carried looted goods on shoulders or tucked under arms—sacks and bales of grain predominating, but also every conceivable variety of valuables. Some dragged women by their hair, victims beaten and bloodied.

On any other day, Yi Haoran would have halted to reprimand them. Now he possessed no time. He rode directly to the yamen compound, leaped from his mount, threw the reins aside carelessly, and charged inside.

As a recognized "favorite" within the staff hierarchy, servants and guards didn't impede him. Yi Haoran burst into the inner signing chamber. The Governor-General was absent; only Chang Qingyun sat in the exterior flower pavilion, sipping tea with perfect composure.

Yi Haoran dispensed with all pleasantries. He demanded sharply:

"Where is Governor Xiong? I must see him at once."

"Governor Xiong is indisposed and resting," Chang Qingyun replied evenly. "Whatever matter concerns you, you may communicate it to me. The effect is identical."

Chang Qingyun had maintained persistent friction with Yi Haoran, but his position within the staff hierarchy ranked considerably higher. To access Xiong Wencan, Yi Haoran genuinely required Chang Qingyun's intercession.

Suppressing his volcanic impatience, he asked: "Is it accurate that tonight will feature a banquet inviting the city's magnates to discuss defense measures?"

"It is."

"And that this banquet will announce three siege strategies to be implemented via the magnates and headmen..."

"Also accurate."

"Then seizing all stored grain, conscripting all able-bodied men, and expelling women, children, and elderly beyond the walls—all true?"

Chang Qingyun paused fractionally, then nodded: "That too is accurate."

"So the plan proposed by Enping County Magistrate Chang Pu is no longer under consideration?"

Chang Qingyun set down his teacup with deliberate care. "Master Yi, these three strategies constitute defensive measures for fighting to the death. Isn't that precisely your desired outcome?"

Yi Haoran found himself momentarily stunned into silence—this observation was undeniably true. Only a siege prosecuted to total annihilation would necessitate these three measures. Otherwise, why implement any of this when simple arson would suffice?
