# Chapter 2115 - Three Siege Strategies

Yi Haoran had barely stepped out the door when he saw the courtyard filled with kneeling civilians.

Though they were all commoners without official rank, these were the "prominent figures" among the populace: mostly prosperous merchants, along with some "venerable elderly" of advanced age.

At their head was none other than Guild-master Qiao of the Rice Guild.

In ordinary times, Guild-master Qiao was the picture of a well-fed, dough-faced rich man. Now he wore simple cotton clothes and knelt at the foot of the steps, wailing as if in mourning. The moment he saw Yi Haoran emerge, he immediately raised his voice in lamentation.

"Master Yi, you must save the people of this city…"

At his cry, the crowd kneeling behind him burst into wailing as well, making Yi Haoran's courtyard sound like a funeral.

Yi Haoran hastily bowed and clasped his fists. "I dare not accept such courtesy! Elders, please rise and speak. This is too much—I cannot bear such honor!"

Inwardly he was puzzled: these visitors were mostly local merchants, along with a few neighborhood headmen. Though they weren't "gentry," they were people of standing in the city—folk whom the prefectural and county yamen took seriously. Why had they all come running to his place to weep and wail?

He held no high position in the Governor's staff—originally just a "rice-stealer" taking up space. His status was lower even than the entertaining jesters who made jokes for the great man's amusement. Only because of the new army training had he become a "favorite"—nominally in charge of the staff's "military desk." But precisely because he dealt with military matters, his social contacts were mostly officers, soldiers, and local civil officials. Local gentry and magnates rarely called on him.

Now this crowd of "people's representatives" had come looking for him—obviously it was about the city's defense.

Guild-master Qiao refused to rise. He continued to wail at the ground: "Master Yi, you must save the people of Wuzhou…"

"What exactly is the matter? Guild-master Qiao, please rise and explain. Whatever is in my power, I'll do my best."

Qiao seemed to judge the moment was right. Only then did he struggle to his feet, wiping his tears as he spoke: "Since Governor Xiong arrived with the officials and officers from Guangdong, Wuzhou has done everything possible to support them. The wine, meat, and silver to reward the troops, the grain and fodder the army needs—every time, we've delivered promptly. Take me, for example: I'm just a rice dealer, but I donated five hundred taels of silver and five hundred *shi* of rice. On top of that, three thousand *shi* were requisitioned at only a third of the market price—and I didn't dare say a word."

At this, the others chimed in with their own complaints. Some said soldiers came to their shops demanding goods without payment, and they dared not ask for money. Others lamented the endless requisitions—things they didn't have, they had to buy and deliver, and they didn't dare fall short. Still others sobbed that soldiers had demanded women to "wash clothes"; handing over maidservants wasn't enough—they wanted household women too; only silver had finally bought a reprieve.

This chorus of grievances left Yi Haoran impatient—he had heard such stories countless times. Of course, the "notables" were establishing that they had "done right" by the government and the army, laying the groundwork for whatever request would follow.

He quickly spoke up: "All these matters are known to Governor Xiong. It's simply that military affairs are urgent and discipline has slipped. The brothers have marched a long way and live on a knife's edge—a little inconvenience is inevitable. Please, elders, bear with it." Then, lowering his voice to Guild-master Qiao, he asked: "What exactly is the pressing matter?"

"Today the Governor's yamen sent Master Chang around distributing invitations—the Governor wants to host a banquet for the city's merchants and discuss the city's defense."

Yi Haoran nodded. "I've heard about this."

"If it's for the city's defense, we'd certainly attend. But there's a rumor that Master Chang has offered Governor Xiong three poisonous stratagems—stratagems that may harm the Hair-Bandits but will devastate the people of this city, killing a thousand to wound five hundred—a ruinous, line-ending scheme!"

Yi Haoran was startled: the arson plan had been secret. Few knew about it. Even though most of the gentry had fled to the countryside or the mountains, many with official degrees remained in the city. A great fire would certainly kill not a few of them. If anyone raised a fuss afterward, it wouldn't be easy to manage, even if they tried to blame the Hair-Bandits or the Wolf Soldiers.

He quickly said: "There's no such thing…"

Even as he spoke, he realized he had slipped: Guild-master Qiao hadn't yet said what the "three poisonous stratagems" were!

Sure enough, he saw a glint of shrewdness flash in the old man's tear-reddened eyes.

Bad! The old fox caught that!

Yi Haoran hurried to add: "Master Chang is an upright man; he wouldn't propose such ruinous schemes. It's only a rumor…"

Even as he said it, his face burned.

Guild-master Qiao said: "It's rumored that Master Chang advised Governor Xiong to seize all the stored grain in the city, conscript every able-bodied man into militia, and expel all women, children, and the elderly outside the walls—we humble folk find all three of these unwise!"

Hearing that the arson plan wasn't mentioned, Yi Haoran let out a breath of relief. These three measures might well be real.

As long as they weren't burning the city, Wuzhou could at least preserve some vitality. Expelling the women and elderly was cruel, but it gave them a chance at survival—the Hair-Bandits were famously "benevolent" and wouldn't slaughter civilians. They might even provide relief.

Still, since the "elders" had come, he had to offer them some reassurance.

Before he could open his mouth, Guild-master Qiao continued: "Master Qiao speaks truly. Yet if grain is seized, the city's morale will certainly collapse. Conscripting every man for defense is all well and good, but most are untrained—on the battlefield, they'd simply fill the ditches. And if women, children, and the elderly are expelled, what man inside the walls would risk his life to hold it?"

"What Master Qiao says is true. But these are only rumors after all." Yi Haoran thought: as long as you have no evidence, I'll just insist it's a rumor—what can you do about it?

"How can Master Yi still call them rumors!" Guild-master Qiao said. "Right now, soldiers are going door to door searching for grain—so-called 'searching,' but actually looting!"

As if to prove his point, a shrill scream suddenly came from the distance, then cut off abruptly. Everyone flinched.

"Master Yi! The Hair-Bandits haven't even entered the city, and Wuzhou is already becoming a living hell."

Yi Haoran's eyes nearly shot fire. He hadn't expected things to spiral so completely out of control. He bellowed: "Jiang Suo!"

Jiang Suo answered instantly.

"Take the men here and go out to restore order at once! No soldiers may plunder! The Governor's command token is in my study—fetch it!"

Orders given, he turned to Guild-master Qiao: "I knew nothing of this. As for the soldiers looting outside, I don't know whether they were acting under orders or not. Please remain calm. I'm going to the Governor's yamen immediately to demand an explanation from Governor Xiong!"

"We thank Master Yi." They all began to kneel again. Yi Haoran had no patience left for their courtesies. He waved them off and told his people to saddle his horse.

Watching Yi Haoran and a dozen servants and guards gallop away, the "notables" who had come to "plead" also hurried home—who knew what shape their own houses were in by now? Only Guild-master Qiao and Luo Yangming, hidden in the crowd, were in no hurry.

"Brother Luo, you were right." Guild-master Qiao's face showed a mix of fear and venom. "These officials are no good! Honey words, hearts of stone!"

Luo Yangming felt both relieved and anxious—relieved that Guild-master Qiao now fully believed him; anxious because time was running short. He put on a worried expression: "Things have come to this. I wonder…"

"If he is without honor, then I am without loyalty," Guild-master Qiao said. "If the Australians come to be emperor, what of it?"

"Whether the Australians become emperor doesn't matter. Right now, the situation is…"

"Come with me. Let's go back and discuss."

Yi Haoran rode at a gallop toward the Governor-General's yamen. The streets were in far worse disorder than before. Everywhere, soldiers were carrying off loot on their shoulders or under their arms—bags and bales of grain, but also all manner of valuables. Some were dragging women by the hair, beaten and bloodied.

On any other day, Yi Haoran would have stopped to reprimand them. Now he had no time. He rode straight to the yamen, leaped from his horse, threw the reins aside, and charged inside.

As a "favorite" of the staff, the servants and guards didn't stop him. Yi Haoran burst into the inner signing room. The Governor-General wasn't there; only Chang Qingyun sat in the flower hall outside, sipping tea with perfect composure.

Yi Haoran had no patience for pleasantries. He demanded:

"Where is Governor Xiong? I must see him at once."

"Governor Xiong is indisposed and resting," Chang Qingyun replied. "Whatever matter it is, you may tell me. It's all the same."

Chang Qingyun had always been at odds with Yi Haoran, but his position in the staff was considerably higher. To see Xiong Wencan, Yi Haoran really did have to go through him.

Suppressing his impatience, he asked: "Is it true that tonight there will be a banquet inviting the city's magnates to discuss the city's defense?"

"It is."

"And that the banquet will announce three siege strategies to be implemented by the magnates and headmen…"

"Also true."

"Then seizing all stored grain, conscripting all able-bodied men, and expelling women, children, and the elderly outside the walls—all true?"

Chang Qingyun paused, then nodded: "That too is true."

"So the plan proposed by County Magistrate Chang Pu of Enping is no longer in use?"

Chang Qingyun set down his teacup. "Master Yi, these three strategies are for defending the city to the death. Isn't that exactly what you wanted?"

Yi Haoran was momentarily taken aback—this was true. Only a siege to the death would require these three measures. Otherwise, why bother with any of it when you could simply set fires?
