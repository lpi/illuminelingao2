# Chapter 2183 - Shijian (Part 3)

"Since when was I from the Fubo Army? I'm authentic National Army origin. A few months ago, I was just like you, an ordinary big-head soldier—didn't even have a Nanyang rifle! Held a spear."

"That fast?" The new recruits didn't believe it.

"What's rare about that? Fighting wars with the Senate, there are plenty of chances to make contributions and establish careers. What's promoting to NCO count for? If you fight well, you enter the Training Team after the battle, and come out as an officer with stars on your shoulders and a command sword!"

To big-head soldiers, "promotion" was always the most attractive topic. Whether in the old Ming army or under the Senate's command, officers were always "high-class people" above, and this future was somewhat visible and tangible. So these few words immediately stirred everyone's ambition for fame and gain.

Becoming an officer might be a bit hard, but becoming an NCO—head of soldiers, tail of generals—was probably easy. It was nothing more than fighting and selling one's life with sword and gun. They had fought several battles; to be honest, they hadn't fought any particularly tough ones yet. The enemy largely couldn't resist them, let alone enter bayonet combat.

"The Chiefs are Sages vying for the world; there will be plenty of times to use soldiers in the future. As long as you fight bravely and obey commands, are you worried about not being promoted? Hmph, but looking at your bird-like appearances today, you have a share in dying, but promotion will be hard! Remember, the first to die in battle are the soft eggs. The two today are examples!"

"Speaking of which, it was really miserable; they were shot directly!" Someone whispered an injustice.

"Can't blame anyone for that. Fighting a battle, you can't disorder the ranks—even in the Great Ming, this is the rule! When I went on campaign as a government soldier back then, there were House Retainers supervising the battle right behind us. Not to mention retreating, anyone who even looked back would be beheaded directly..." The old soldier slicker started bragging.

"That breaks it down clearly. Being a soldier fighting a war, no matter which country or dynasty you serve, the first thing is neat ranks, the second is strict discipline! Without a command, even if a sword chops on your head, you are not allowed to fire, understood?! Next time, if anyone dares to move a finger, I'll chop you up on behalf of the supervising team!"

Yang Erdong cursed a few more sentences. Logistics sent supplies over, and Yang Erdong took the Quartermaster to receive them. Once the officer left, although the soldiers' hands didn't stop working, their mouths started chatting. The topic started from scolding officers for treating people like livestock, unknowingly fell back to "who was the first to chicken out and fire the first shot when attacking the wall," and finally no one could distinguish clearly, only able to prove their innocence by swearing cynically.

Ai Buyi buried his head in digging earth, not participating in the bragging contest routinely carried out by his comrades. Someone suddenly mentioned: "Luckily we won in the end. If we hadn't taken it down, messing it up, they might have shot a few of us when we retreated tonight."

Hearing a matter concerning life, everyone present pricked up their ears.

"Don't talk nonsense; the Chiefs don't kill people indiscriminately," someone said quickly.

That person hmphed, nodding towards Malay, who was sewing clothes for relief: "What do you think Luo Mao's direct control squad does? They kill those who don't advance at the drum beat and fear the enemy. Malay, isn't that right?"

Malay was a new recruit; of course, he dared not fail to respond when asked by an old soldier. He shook his head: "I dare not say that. But Sergeant Luo certainly has the Squadron Leader's trust; he always stays by his side..."

"So that's it. Squadron Leader Li trusts Sergeant Luo most. When fighting, his squad always stays by his side, and he sends them up at critical moments—what is this? Isn't it just House Retainers?" The speaker was Gou Shangtian. He was also of Ming army origin, but had been a combat soldier, better than these replacement soldiers who had only been miscellaneous soldiers. He loved bragging and talking big on ordinary days.

Ai Buyi followed the crowd to look at him. Gou Shangtian got even more excited: "Didn't we sit on the main street to eat lunch the second day we came to Zhaoqing? I saw with my own eyes Luo Mao taking people into a government office courtyard, then closing the door and chopping down the hundred or so captives inside. Tsk tsk, that blood, flowing like a small stream. It's said they were all captured bandits and local landlords who refused to pay levies..."

"Is there such a thing?" Everyone was a bit skeptical. Killing people in this time wasn't rare, but killing hundreds in the city at once without any noise before or after was too magical.

"If you don't believe it, forget it. Anyway, that night their squad had extra dishes specifically, while other squads didn't. Isn't that eating the meal after an execution?" Gou Shangtian spoke vividly. "Look at those people under him, every one of them... tsk tsk, that murderous aura—I've seen it; only people who kill often have it..."

At these words, everyone shuddered, turning to rejoice endlessly about today's events.

...

Yang Erdong finished receiving and counting supplies and came back to start inspecting weapons according to orders. Li Dong worried that the soldiers hadn't learned to use rifles for long and feared problems, so he ordered squad leaders of every squad to personally inspect every soldier's weapon integrity every night.

He inspected the soldiers' rifles one by one to see if they cleaned their guns according to regulations. Old soldiers were better; basically, they all had the habit of cleaning guns. New soldiers were uneven; some forgot while being busy. Yang Erdong unavoidably cursed them out again and ordered those who didn't clean guns to stand night watch today.

Weapon inspection finished, Yang Erdong frowned and called:

"Ai Buyi, come here!"

Ai Buyi handed over his gun and it hadn't been returned to him; his heart had been trembling. Hearing Yang Erdong call his name, his head buzzed. Walking up shakily, he saw Yang Erdong holding exactly his rifle. Knowing the matter couldn't be covered up, he flopped down on his knees.

Yang Erdong said nothing, raising his hand to slap him twice, then raised his foot and kicked Ai Buyi, making him howl in pain. At this time, Luo Mao was leading a squad of the direct control team on night patrol. Hearing the commotion, he came over to ask what was happening, scaring Ai Buyi pale.

Yang Erdong handed Ai Buyi's rifle to Luo Mao.

"Take a look!"

As an old soldier of Fubo Army origin, Luo Mao was thoroughly familiar with the work of handling guns. Once the gun was in hand, a slight check revealed the problem. He immediately tilted the barrel, and surprisingly poured out four bullets. The two looked up at each other and sighed.

Ai Buyi felt he was dead for sure. Not collapsing on the ground was entirely due to the military discipline drilled into him over the past few months. He didn't even realize he was begging with a crying tone: "Officer, beg you to let me return to my hometown. I really dare not shoot at people..."

The two NCOs also knew that other squadrons of the National Army, and even the Fubo Army, had had such cases. Looking robust and bold, with good obedience and not bad training scores, but just dared not kill people, fainting as soon as they went onto the battlefield. Not only failing to fight themselves but also dragging down comrades.

Now his own squadron had discovered such a good-for-nothing! Luo Mao was somewhat in a difficult position. Beating him up in public would treat the symptoms but not the root cause; shooting him wasn't that serious. If it were ordinary times without war, dismissing him would be fine. But now they were in combat; if a sound, strong man could go home just because of cowardice—this war couldn't be fought anymore.

In the end, Luo Mao took the matter on: "I'll talk to him; you busy yourself with your stuff."

Luo Mao sat on the breastwork, lit a cigarette, beckoned Ai Buyi closer, and asked him: "What are you afraid of? Tell me."

Ai Buyi answered hesitantly: "I'm really scared; I dare not shoot at people. And I can't beat the enemy. I followed the unit for a few battles; standing in the back I saw clearly. My little skill isn't enough to fight the Ming army... I have an old mother at home; I'm afraid if I die no one will take care of her. Beg you to speak to Squad Leader Li and let me go home." Saying this, he was about to burst into tears.

"Everyone is afraid of death; who isn't? But will you not die if you are afraid? Fighting a war isn't your personal business; there are over a hundred brothers standing with you. If you want to leave because you are afraid, what about the brothers of the whole squadron? Now we are in combat; your conduct today counts as desertion in the face of battle, enough to be shot as a deserter! Do you remember the two brothers who were shot?!"

"Report to Officer, I remember."

"Good that you remember!" Luo Mao paused, softening his tone. "Now I'll teach you a way to be a soldier and not die. Listen carefully: If you don't want to die, you have to win battles, win them absolutely! Understood? Tell me, how can we win battles?"

"...Shoot to kill the enemy."

"Bullsh*t! I see you've forgotten everything taught in training; the beatings back then were for nothing." Luo Mao scolded angrily, making Ai Buyi shudder. "I'll teach you once more, remember this: You are a soldier; a soldier's duty is to obey orders! Repeat it, louder! When told to line up, you line up. When told to fire, you load and shoot at the fastest speed. Without orders, stand honestly; don't move even if a knife chops on your head. You are afraid because you think too much and don't listen clearly to orders, being half-hearted. No matter what the enemy opposite does, don't think about how to kill the enemy; that's what officers should ponder. Keeping an eye on the officer's every word and action is where your duty lies. Victory doesn't lie in how many enemies are killed, but whether you can complete your duty. And as long as everyone performs their duties, we will keep winning."

"Yes..."

Luo Mao didn't know if these words were useful to him. He softened his tone: "Besides, you follow the troops to fight. Although brothers die or get injured in every battle, how does it compare to the enemy's corpses littering the field? Fighting with the Fubo Army, you won't throw your life away easily—as long as you obey orders and listen to command!"

Luo Mao didn't want to push too hard. After saying what needed to be said, he sent him back.

"Luo Mao actually didn't shoot you? What did he say to you?" As soon as Ai Buyi returned to the trench, the brothers surrounded him. Ai Buyi just gripped the shovel handle tightly, bowing his head in silence.

"Little brother, next time fighting you'll definitely be the vanguard..." Gou Shangtian said, unknown whether with good or malicious intent.

After returning, Luo Mao reported Ai Buyi's matter to Li Dong, suggesting observing a while longer.

"New recruits are inevitably timid; they'll be fine after fighting a few more battles."
