# Chapter 2139 - Difficulties Abound

Because of this incident, Xie Erren had no intention of continuing to "patrol" inside and outside the city. However, two pontoon bridges had not yet been "inspected": the Canglong Pontoon Bridge and the Gui River Pontoon Bridge, which connected the east, west, and south of the river, linking Wuzhou's three rivers and six banks into one piece.

Now both pontoon bridges had been destroyed in the flames of war. The daily life and livelihood of the Wuzhou people were greatly affected. For the Wuzhou Municipal Government, whether the traffic was smooth also related to whether the security forces could quickly reach various important points outside the city. So Xie Erren had to go and see them.

To go to the Gui River Pontoon Bridge from the Dragon Mother Temple, one only had to follow the bank of the Gui River all the way south. This area of the riverbank was close to the urban area and used to be full of docks, warehouses, and shops, very lively. At this moment, however, there were broken walls and ruins everywhere—fortunately, most of the markets and docks were preserved, but every house was closed, a scene of coldness and desolation. Xie Erren sighed as he walked: the Fubo Army fought a bit too excessively, beating it into such a miserable state!

He suddenly remembered something and turned his head to ask, "Why are the shops here all closed? Didn't we ask them to open for business as soon as possible?"

The Paijia accompanying him apologized with a smile, "Master doesn't know, this area outside the city is now in chaos with turmoil. Bandits and bad people run rampant, and the street gates are all damaged. Even in broad daylight, people are robbed—how would the shopkeepers dare to open their doors for business!"

Xie Erren didn't expect the security outside the city to be so poor, but on second thought, it was inevitable: the old "Three Classes of Bailiffs" were either dead or fled. Many people, knowing about the cleanup of bailiffs in Guangzhou, asked themselves if they had blood debts and public anger; even if they didn't die, they naturally didn't dare to come back. In the end, only twenty people came to report for duty. Just being responsible for security inside the city was already beyond their ability. As for the hurriedly established militia, that was a mob with nothing to show for it yet.

"Rest assured, I will arrange for the militia to come on duty immediately. It's just that the merchants here also need to contribute and repair all the street gates. Wherever there are damaged gaps, regardless of using bricks or wood, they should be blocked up."

The Paijia naturally agreed repeatedly. Zhao Fengtian hurriedly made another note in his small notebook. This was an instruction for all Senator secretaries: speeches made by Senators during inspections and talks outside must have key points recorded to form a memorandum—in the past, Senators often issued various "instructions" frequently during inspections, but forgot them completely after returning, leaving a bad impression of "liking empty talk" on naturalized citizens and indigenous people.

Xie Erren declined the sedan chair, walking and looking along the street, stopping from time to time to inquire and "ask after their needs," before arriving at the Niu Shi (Cow Dung) Dock where the Gui River Pontoon Bridge was located.

The location of the Gui River Pontoon Bridge was roughly at the location of the later Yuanjiang Bridge. To the east of the bridge was Niu Shi Dock, connecting to Xiaonan Road in the east; to the west of the bridge was the Sanhezui Grand Drill Ground. At the bridgeheads on both banks, dozens of steps were built with bricks and stones. There was a pair of iron pillars on each side, hung with two wrought iron chains. Boats were moored to the chains, and wooden planks were framed on the boats and between the boats to form a bridge, with railings on both sides. However, at this moment, not only were the boats missing without a trace, but even the two iron chains were broken and sunk in the river water.

Below the dock, there were also many wrecks of ships that had been sunk or burned. Combined with the houses destroyed by war near Niu Shi Dock, it was a desolate and lonely scene after the war.

He Dongli introduced that this pontoon bridge was first built under the auspices of Han Yong and the local Garrison Eunuch Chen Ping. It used a total of 56 boats, with another ten boats as reserves to be added or removed according to the rise and fall of the water level to facilitate the lifting and lowering of the bridge deck. It had been repaired and replaced over the years; only the iron pillars and chains were still the original items.

The iron chains themselves could be opened and closed. When ships passed, they could be loosened to give way to the channel. When no ships were passing, they could be connected again. Although it was slightly inconvenient for the traffic on the Gui River, it was a great benevolent policy for the people on both banks.

Whether from the perspective of winning popular support, the convenience of deploying troops, or restoring market prosperity, this pontoon bridge had to be repaired as soon as possible.

Xie Erren asked the local Paijia to summon the bridge keeper. Upon asking, he found out that the boats had not been completely destroyed; seven or eight reserve boats survived—even so, the gap was not small. The bridge keeper also complained incessantly. It turned out that although this bridge was built by the government, the daily use and maintenance were the responsibility of nearby merchants and people. although the government sent people to set up checkpoints at the bridgehead to collect taxes, the maintenance costs of this bridge were all "self-raised" by the merchants and people, which became a major burden for shops on both banks.

Listening to the "representative" complaining there, he felt a little impatient in his heart—he had heard too many such words since entering the city. Endless complaints: the retained clerks and bailiffs in the yamen, the "gentry and elders," the common people... as long as he asked about the specific situation, there were many difficulties. They looked at him eagerly, hoping he would come up with a solution. Even the naturalized cadres and soldiers had this tone: in their view, Senators should be omnipotent.

*How do you know that I am also a clay bodhisattva crossing the river, not knowing where the solution is myself!* Thinking of the poverty-stricken appearance of the gentry in the Rehabilitation Bureau, Xie Erren's mood worsened a bit—he didn't know how the fundraising for money and grain was going.

With such a weary mood, Xie Erren hurriedly left the ferry crossing and returned to the perfecture yamen. The Planning Agency's search team had already inventoried part of the spoils of war and the contents of various public treasuries at the Wuzhou Prefecture and County levels and made them into a booklet.

Xie Erren looked at it. Overall, there wasn't much profit: almost no grain or money. He hated Xiong Wencan even more in his heart: how much money and grain had been wasted in Wuzhou with tens of thousands of people!

There were quite a few miscellaneous materials in the spoils, but most were swords, spears, and military weapons, which were of no help to his current predicament—he couldn't use so many swords and spears, and the Senate didn't care for the Ming Dynasty's firearms. Looking around, only the ships abandoned by the Ming army had some value; at least they could be used to repair the pontoon bridge.

He calculated which things could be used and which matters needed to be handled as soon as possible, writing while thinking. After a long time, he felt a headache. He got up and walked around a circle, suddenly remembering the female assassin, and called Zhao Fengtian:

"How is that female assassin?"

"Detained in the perfecture prison," Zhao Fengtian said. "According to the bailiff, her temperament is particularly unyielding. She tried to bite her tongue after being caught, and later tried to hit her head against the wall on the way. Right now she is cangued to the wall, and even her mouth is stuffed with things. The clerk of the punishments room asks for the Chief's instructions: how to dispose of her?"

This kind of thing just needed a naturalized cadre responsible for security to handle it. The importance was nothing more than digging out if there was a "anti-Senate group" behind the scenes. If it was troublesome, direct disposal was also fine: whether it was execution on the spot or showing leniency and escorting her to Lingao for "labor reform," it was just a matter of one sentence.

However, Xie Erren's journalist instinct revived: there must be big news behind this! His nose seemed to smell the stench of major social news, completely disregarding that he was one of the parties involved.

"No, I want to interrogate her personally!" Xie Erren said decisively.

In addition to his nature being hard to change, this also contained his intention to use familiar things to dilute the boring emotions in front of him.

"Yes, I'll go call someone to bring her over!" Zhao Fengtian had worked with the Chiefs for a long time and was used to their sudden ideas. The phrase "The Chief is always right" had almost become a superstition for old naturalized citizens. So he turned to do it without any doubt.

Xie Erren stopped him: "I'll go to the prison cell to interrogate; don't bring her over."

This place had been changed into an office, full of documents and maps. It was not appropriate to let prisoners and retained bailiffs come in. Xie Erren still had this bit of confidentiality awareness.

Zhao Fengtian immediately led the way, taking him to the gate of the prefecture prison.

The Wuzhou Prefecture Prison was actually in the southwest corner of the prefecture yamen—although the scale and construction quality of the prefecture and county prisons in the Great Ming varied, they were all carved out of the same mold in terms of form. Specifically, they were all built according to the yamen form set by Zhu Yuanzhang. Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen was no exception.

Don't look at ordinary civilian houses which were mostly wooden structures or bamboo fences pasted with mud; this large prison and the county yamen received the same treatment, both built with hand-made blue bricks, very fastidious. The walls were tall and solid. With the passage of many years, it appeared very gloomy.

The main gate of the prefecture prison was hard-mountain style tiled house, three bays wide and one bay deep, facing north. The middle bay was the main gate, and the two side bays were vertical lattice windows. This was the entrance to the prison and also the place where the guards sat on duty, so it was also called the "Passing Hall."

In the Passing Hall, the prison head and jailers had already received the news. One by one, they changed into neat clothes to welcome him. Seeing Xie Erren coming, they bowed in unison.

Xie Erren waved his hand: "No need for formalities. Where is the assassin?"

"Detained in the death row at the back." The head stepped forward and reported respectfully, "This woman is very unyielding and attempted suicide several times. We can only cangue her. Please give instructions, Master, where to interrogate?"

Xie Erren looked at this Passing Hall. The place was not big, and the east and west rooms were inconvenient because they were office and duty places for the prison head. He remembered seeing the Prison God Temple in the Beijing Opera *Su San Under Police Escort*. Since it was a temple, there must be at least one room, which could be used for interrogation.

"I heard there is a Prison God Temple in the prison. Let it be there."

The prison head was stunned and smiled apologetically, "There is naturally a Prison God Temple, only... only... the place is too small and not very convenient..."

This, on the contrary, aroused Xie Erren's suspicion. He hadn't been to a prison before, and at this moment he intended to take a look, so he said, "What are you afraid of if it's small? If it's not suitable, we'll change then—lead the way!"

Seeing that he had made up his mind, the prison head couldn't disobey, so he immediately led the way in front.

Passing through the Passing Hall, there was a long and narrow courtyard. There was a row of prison cells on each of the east and west sides, with a corridor in the middle, only 2 meters wide. Above the whole courtyard, there was truly only a "strip of sky." Walking in the corridor felt indescribably gloomy and depressing. From time to time, one could smell the stench of dampness.

The head said this was the cell for ordinary prisoners. There were eight cells on each side. At this moment, because the government had released all prisoners before the city fell, the cells were empty. Xie Erren looked in curiously at the door for a moment: the area of the cell was extremely small, with a depth of no more than 1.5 meters and a width of no more than 2 meters.
