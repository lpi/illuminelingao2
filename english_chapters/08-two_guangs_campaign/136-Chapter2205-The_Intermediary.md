# Chapter 2205 - The Intermediary

Simply sending word that the bandit chief was invited to surrender and expecting him to come—that sort of thing only happened to Song Jiang in *Water Margin*. Real-world pacification was far more complicated. A go-between might have to shuttle back and forth for lengthy negotiations—much like a business deal, with a chief's life and fortune hanging in the balance. Unless the outlaws were cornered and desperate, negotiations could drag on for ages.

When the Ming court pacified Zheng Zhilong, from his first acceptance of terms in 1626 to his formal submission in 1628, the process took over three years, with multiple reversals and several breaks in talks. The success was due partly to Zheng Zhilong's strong desire to surrender and partly to Governor-General Xiong Wencan's sufficient "sincerity"—essentially meeting all of Zheng's demands.

Now, if Wang Chuyi wanted to arrange a pacification, he too had to show "sincerity." Otherwise, the other side would never believe him.

"This emissary is very hard to find," Wang Chuyi said, troubled. The envoy not only bore heavy responsibility and required quick wit, but also had to command considerable respect with Sun Dabiao and Feng Haijiao—someone whose words carried weight.

The Zhangzhou-Quanzhou Maritime Circuit Intendant Cai Ji, who had mediated Zheng Zhilong's pacification, had once bestowed a favor on Zheng during his tenure as prefect. Right now, though, Wang Chuyi could think of no such figure.

"The ideal candidate is Zhang Tianbo, but he has fled," said Peng Shou'an. "Even if we sought him out, he probably would not emerge. However, I have another option in mind."

Peng Shou'an explained: There was a retired old functionary named Li Shuangkuai—formerly the head constable of Yangshan County—who had retired over a decade ago and now lived in the countryside. By seniority, Zhang Tianbo was his "disciple's disciple."

"...Every year when Li Shuangkuai celebrated his birthday, Zhang Tianbo would come to pay respects and bring a modest gift. If we ask Li Shuangkuai to find Zhang Tianbo, Zhang will certainly agree to meet. Your Honor might first seek to win over Zhang Tianbo—promise him a bright future and tempt him with rich rewards—then have him act as the envoy..."

Wang Chuyi burst out laughing and clapped Peng Shou'an on the shoulder. "You're quite something! No wonder they say scholars have only schemes in their bellies! That's exactly what we'll do!"

The slap nearly dislocated Peng Shou'an's shoulder. Paired with that backhanded "compliment," his inner thoughts were unprintable—but he forced a smile: "The County Magistrate flatters me. These are merely my humble observations. The actual execution is for Your Honor to decide."

Wang Chuyi nodded: "No wonder the Commander called you a treasure—he's absolutely right! We'll proceed just like this!" He immediately assigned everyone tasks. The National Army squadron commander sent men to reconnoiter the bandit lairs while others went to find guides—and to locate the old constable.

Li Shuangkuai's home was only five or six *li* outside the north gate. During the Yao uprising, he had taken refuge in the city with his family. After the Australians lifted the siege, he returned home.

Having served as head constable for many years, Li Shuangkuai had amassed considerable savings. He had purchased a good deal of land outside the city—the Yao might burn houses and loot goods, but they could not steal land. Returning home to find the house in ruins and moveable property stripped, his family wept and lamented. But Li Shuangkuai remained composed. He had his people dig up the tools, utensils, and silver they had buried beforehand, hastily erected a few shacks, and managed to settle in.

One day, while overseeing his workers in the garden, the local *baojia* headman came to tell him that "a squad of soldiers from the county has escorted several officials" who wanted a word with him.

Li Shuangkuai was surprised. He had left the yamen over a decade ago. Though he still had old acquaintances there, his household had no entanglements with the government. Why would the Australians suddenly come calling?

Saying "I'll be right there," he leisurely patted the dust from his clothes.

As a career functionary, his mind worked fast. Before he had finished brushing off his robe, he had guessed: the Australians' sudden visit was most likely connected to Zhang Tianbo.

Zhang Tianbo was one of the county's notorious "Three Tyrants." Evidently, the Australians meant to go after him!

Entering the main room, he found three Australian "officials" standing there. After a few courtesies, the visitors introduced themselves—the leader was none other than the Australians' newly appointed County Magistrate of Yangshan.

Li Shuangkuai hastily dropped to his knees: "So the County Magistrate himself has arrived! This humble commoner failed to welcome you from afar—pray forgive me!"

To demonstrate sincerity, Wang Chuyi had come in person. Seeing the old man so deferential, he felt obliged to exchange pleasantries and help him to his feet.

Once host and guest were seated, Li Shuangkuai uttered the usual phrases—"Your Honor's presence in my humble abode leaves me greatly honored"—and Wang Chuyi, assuming the old man was merely intimidated by officialdom, took his excessive courtesy at face value. But behind Wang, Lu Dabang—the National Army squadron commander who doubled as head of the county Public Security Section—sensed otherwise. Though Li Shuangkuai feigned bewilderment and timidity, a keen glint flashed in his sidelong glances. Clearly this was a formidable character.

*The old fox is slippery!* Lu Dabang thought. *He won't be easy to handle; we may have to put in extra effort.*

But the conversation took an unexpected turn. Li Shuangkuai was a veteran constable, seasoned in the ways of the *jianghu*, and understood that an Australian county magistrate coming to his door could not be easily fobbed off. Furthermore, he had heard that the Australians loathed functionaries and purged them wherever they went—arresting some, executing others. Though he had long since retired, prudence dictated compliance.

When Wang Chuyi asked about Zhang Tianbo, Li Shuangkuai was forthright: "Zhang Tianbo is my disciple's disciple—my son's apprentice."

Li Shuangkuai recounted the history: When he retired, he had, as customary, passed the head constable's position to his son. But his son died of an epidemic after only a few years in the role. The position then went to the son's apprentice, Zhang Tianbo.

Zhang Tianbo was not much younger than the son; the apprenticeship had been purely a means to secure the position. After the son's death, Li Shuangkuai had no wish for his grandson to take up constable work. He sold the position to Zhang Tianbo for fifty taels.

"After he became constable, did he stay in contact with you?"

"Because my family is considered to have 'patronized' him, Zhang Tianbo has always been respectful. He visits on every festival and holiday; he comes to pay respects on my birthday, drinks a cup of rice wine, and leaves." Li Shuangkuai did not hide this—it was easily confirmed by asking anyone in the village.

In truth, the situation was more complicated. Though no one in Li Shuangkuai's household still worked as a constable, Li Shuangkuai leveraged his old yamen connections and his relationship with Zhang Tianbo to broker disputes and "negotiate settlements" for a fee, colluding closely with Zhang. He naturally knew all about Zhang's doings—but to this old functionary, none of it was unusual. Being a functionary was all about the money!

Li Shuangkuai greatly feared that Magistrate Wang would probe these matters—he could not easily disentangle himself from Zhang Tianbo, and he had things to hide. If pushed, he himself might not escape unscathed.

Fortunately, Wang Chuyi did not dig deeper. He simply said: "Since you know Zhang Tianbo well, I ask you to pass on a message for the county government: Right now the county is in ruins, chaos reigns within and without, and we urgently need to restore order. He was Yangshan's head constable. If he is willing to serve, we will let bygones be bygones."

Li Shuangkuai demurred: "Your Honor, I do not know where Zhang Tianbo is now..."

"If you set your mind to finding him, can you fail? I give you three days. On the morning of the fourth, I will send someone for your answer."

No matter how Li Shuangkuai protested that he had no way of contacting Zhang Tianbo, Wang Chuyi refused to relent. Left with no choice, Li Shuangkuai agreed.

After seeing Wang Chuyi off, Li Shuangkuai paced his courtyard for some time. He was puzzled: he had heard the Australians held functionaries in contempt and purged them wherever they went. Why suddenly want to use this "sworn brother" of his?

Of course, the county was in turmoil and security was poor; it was not so strange for the Australian-appointed magistrate, desperate for order, to summon an old constable to take charge.

And yet, the wily old constable still detected an ominous whiff.

*Could this be a trap?*

But try as he might, he could not see why the Australians would set such a trap for him—he was just an ordinary old man now. Zhang Tianbo, stripped of his constable's credentials, was likewise worthless. There was no reason for the Australians to expend such effort.

*Forget it!* he thought. It had nothing to do with him anyway. Since the Australians wanted Zhang Tianbo, he would find him! Otherwise, he would have no answer to give in three days.

He had not lied earlier—he truly did not know Zhang Tianbo's whereabouts. The man would certainly not be hiding at home; he must have sought refuge with some friend.

Functionaries had many friends, but most were fair-weather or self-interested connections; genuine trust was rare. Li Shuangkuai reasoned that the only people who would dare shelter Zhang now were Sun Dabiao or Feng Haijiao. Leaving aside their sworn brotherhood, even without that bond, those two had to safeguard him—otherwise, all three would sink together.

The problem was, even if he went asking, those two would probably deny it, given the current climate.

After much thought, only Zhang Tianbo's own family could get through.

Zhang Tianbo had fled to a bandit lair, but his wife and children were hiding elsewhere.

Veteran rogues were full of tricks, and Zhang Tianbo was no exception. Though he had sworn brotherhood with Sun Dabiao and Feng Haijiao, he still guarded against his sworn brothers—*jianghu* loyalty never trumped hard silver. Over the years as constable, he had embezzled a fortune, and his household had accumulated substantial savings. If his sworn brothers turned on him and "swept the den," it would be the end of him. Following the "cunning rabbit, three burrows" principle, before going into hiding, Zhang Tianbo had entrusted his family to Li Shuangkuai. Li Shuangkuai dared not shelter them at home—he had no room anyway—so he placed them with his sworn brother Xin Laonan's estate.
