# Chapter 2308 - Cover Up

"The unloading is underway. Everything is going smoothly so far, please rest assured," Zhao Fengtian reported. "The ships of the Inland River Fleet are also patrolling the river."

"That is good, that is good." Xie Erren's mind wasn't actually on the grain ships—with heavy troops guarding inside and outside the city and the Inland River Fleet suppressing the array, even if Xiong Wencan led a large army personally, it would be useless.

Zhao Fengtian understood his thoughts naturally and coughed lightly, saying, "Regarding last night's night raid, Comrade Zheng Ergen has already obtained a preliminary result from interrogating the captives..." Saying so, he handed the folder containing the confessions to him. "Please take a look."

Xie Erren read the confessions carefully, especially Cai Lan's part, truly experiencing what "the bone-deep pain of betrayal" meant. As for Zhao Fengtian, he deeply understood what "furious out of shame" meant from the Chief's twisted face.

After Xie Erren put down the confession, remained silent for a long time, and exhaled a deep breath, his face gradually turning from red to white and then back to normal color, Zhao Fengtian finally spoke:

"Chief..."

"Zhao Fengtian, what do you think of this matter?"

"Yes," Zhao Fengtian said cautiously. "The main reason for Wuzhou's night raid last night was our weak defensive strength. Although the Region and Forward Command pressed too many tasks on us, the resources were insufficient. Especially after the bandit riots, the police force in Wuzhou wasn't strengthened but weakened significantly. We had to rely on the unreliable Detective Team to strengthen security. That the enemy could launch a night raid and infiltrate the city... it cannot be denied that this is the main reason..."

With that, he listed the various specific tasks assigned to the City Government by various departments since the recovery of Wuzhou, which were detailed and well-documented, with clear figures.

"...We not only bore the heavy responsibility of transshipping supplies to the Guangxi front line and evacuating the wounded but also had to guard the captives escorted down from Guangxi and refugees from surrounding areas. Yet the cadres, Volte Army, and relevant funds allocated to Wuzhou were severely insufficient. The lesson this time is comprehensive."

These words immediately fit Xie Erren's thoughts. He thought this secretary was truly not simple; his words were watertight and incidentally shifted the blame. This could serve as the keynote for the report.

"Given that the enemy's insiders and spies inside and outside Wuzhou City have been caught in one net, and the captured captives have little value left, it is suggested to deal with them publicly as soon as possible. First, to display the martial prowess of our Great Song Senators and warn other fence-sitters with double hearts; second, to soothe the hearts of the people and the army in Wuzhou."

The meaning of the latter sentence couldn't be clearer. Xie Erren was silent for a long time, then suddenly whispered, "Zhao Fengtian!"

Zhao Fengtian jumped in fright. What was wrong with Chief Xie?

"How many years have you been my secretary?"

"More than two years." Zhao Fengtian drummed in his heart, thinking Chief Xie wouldn't pull out a line like: "How do I treat you usually?" If he said that, he really had to be careful.

Fortunately, Xie Erren didn't say that:
"Since it's been more than two years, you don't need to use official jargon to cover up and pull back and forth. Wuzhou has poked such a big hole this time. Although you and I—one a Senator, one a City Government Secretary—are different, neither of us can slide past this matter. We definitely must give a clear explanation to the Senate."

Zhao Fengtian relaxed slightly and whispered, "Chief, I've thought about this too. Only these two points can be played up. Honestly, the rest is hard to manage..."

"What about the second point?" Xie Erren asked. "For such a big event, there can't be zero witnesses. What if the Senate investigates?"

"Chief, you are the administrative head of Wuzhou. The power of life and death over all Wuzhou people is in your hands. Killing or not killing anyone can be done at your discretion. Why struggle over witnesses? Isn't striking enemies strictly and quickly the consistent aim of the Senate?" Zhao Fengtian said, "Speaking of which, this matter isn't too big. Aside from burning a camp at Sanhezu and some casualties in the 3rd National Army Squadron, damage inside the city was slight, and casualties were very small—those retained personnel aren't in the army or staff organization charts, so their casualties can be disregarded..."

Calculating this way, the Senate's total loss in Wuzhou was only forty-five National Army soldiers killed and six staff members killed. At a time when whole squadrons of the National Army were occasionally written off, this loss figure really counted for nothing.

Xie Erren nodded. No wonder the Americans liked using contractors!

Undoubtedly, the biggest problem now was people like Yi Haoran and Cai Lan. In fact, Xie Erren had already formed murderous intent in his heart but was still hesitant—after all, these people were related to the Wuzhou night raid. Rashly executing them would leave suspicion of "silencing witnesses." But hearing Zhao Fengtian's words, he felt they made perfect sense.

"What you say makes sense. But this Yi Haoran and Cai Lan are key criminals..."

"Yi Haoran is a remnant evil left by Xiong Wencan. He brought chaos to Wuzhou; his crimes are heinous. Not killing him is insufficient to appease public anger and settle people's hearts. As for Cai Lan, though a woman, she ran errands as a lackey for Yi Haoran. Her crimes are also notorious and pointed at by thousands. She likely won't escape a bad end; it's unknown if she might commit suicide out of shame."

After speaking, seeing Xie Erren still hesitating, Zhao Fengtian whispered, "Chief! If we leave Cai Lan for the higher-ups to investigate, it will inevitably involve many private boudoir matters. I'm afraid that's not appropriate..."

This remark jolted Xie Erren awake. Correct. Although his "taking in" of Cai Lan wasn't a secret, if interrogators from Lingao faced Cai Lan directly, wouldn't all his private matters be questioned out of her? Even if the General Office withheld the relevant testimony, this material would become a handle on him that could never be washed away. If he eliminated Cai Lan, there would be no hard evidence for this matter! He only needed to deny it flatly.

Xie Erren nodded slightly. "Let's do it that way!"

Zhao Fengtian understood tacitly. As long as Cai Lan died, the person Chang Qingyun would vanish like smoke—anyway, he wasn't among the captives. Whether he was alive or dead, it couldn't be traced to Xie's head. As for Jiang Qiuchan, she had an old friendship with Luo Yangming's wife and a connection to Manager Da, so she couldn't be disposed of casually. Fortunately, her crimes were limited; at most, she was used. The key was that she knew little, so she could be let off. Luo Yangming wasn't a fool; he wouldn't entangle himself too much in Jiang Qiuchan's matter, otherwise, his wife would also be implicated.

Although he got Xie Erren's approval, this task wasn't easy to handle. If it were a Ming Yamen, there were countless ways to make a prisoner die. But this was under the Senate's rule. Whether intentionally "accidentally killing during torture" or having them "die of illness" in prison, both would become suspicious points attracting the attention of future investigation teams.

The only thing that could be engineered was "suicide."

Of course, making Cai Lan "be suicided" wouldn't work; that was no different from before. But Zheng Ergen said she already had the will to die. Just give her a chance and urge her a little.

Zhao Fengtian quietly found Zheng Ergen and conveyed Xie Erren's meaning. Zheng Ergen hesitated and whispered, "Will this work?"

"Naturally it will work." Zhao Fengtian said, "Didn't you see that Cai Lan's will to die is set? You just need to send her on her way."

"Yi Haoran!" The voice of a jailer came from outside the room.

Yi Haoran, who had been groggy, struggled to open his eyes. The door was open, and several Fake Kuns stood before it, looking fierce.

How long had it been? Ever since being interrogated and fainting from torture, he had lost the concept of time. He only realized upon waking just now that he had been returned to the temporary cell in the County Yamen's Earth God Temple.

After his arrest, Yi Haoran had been kept in the County Yamen jail. At first, it was "preventative detention," and later, although moved from a group cell to solitary confinement, because he had no charges yet and had the connection with Luo Yangming, he wasn't put into the main dungeon but temporarily detained in the Earth God Temple.

Yi Haoran had no illusions about his arrest. Once tonight passed, it was very likely his identity would be exposed—fortunately, by then, it wouldn't matter whether his identity was exposed or not.

The cannon fire outside the city and the shouts of killing inside the city excited him endlessly. The plan he had painstakingly managed, run back and forth for, and plotted for many days was finally put into action. Everything he had paid seemed to have paid off.

At this moment, although covered in sores from torture and with his life hanging by a thread, he didn't care at all—he had sought benevolence and gained it. The only regret was that, seeing the calm appearance of the Fake Kuns in the city, the True Kun seemed not to have been captured or beheaded.

"Yi Haoran," the leading Fake Kun whispered, "I'll give you one more chance now. If you are willing to confess thoroughly, we will treat your injuries and exempt you from death—you are just an ordinary advisor, not some chief evil. Our Great Song has always ruled by law; at most, you'll be sentenced to exile."

"And if I am unwilling?" Yi Haoran said.

The flesh on the Fake Kun's face twitched. "If you are unwilling to confess, we won't tangle with you anymore. Whatever secrets you want to keep, just keep them—anyway, we can figure things out eventually."

"Is this sending me on my way?"

"Correct." The Fake Kun said, "Since you don't confess, what use is there in keeping you?"

"Then let's go. I've lived ignobly for decades; it counts as enough." Yi Haoran didn't care. "Wait for me to straighten my clothes."

Just as they were speaking, another person was escorted into the yard abruptly. It was a woman. Although dressed neatly, her hair was disheveled and her face grimy. She also walked with difficulty, supported by two sturdy women—it was Cai Lan.

Although Yi Haoran had long regarded Cai Lan as a "person who should die," seeing her suffer torture because of him and unlikely to live long, he felt inevitable guilt in his heart.

If he hadn't provoked her with righteousness, she could have totally lived on ignobly.

Thinking of this, he straightened his clothes and bowed solemnly to Cai Lan: "Miss Cai, this student pays his respects!"
