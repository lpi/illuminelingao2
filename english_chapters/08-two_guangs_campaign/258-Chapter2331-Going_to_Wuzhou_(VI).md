# Chapter 2331 - Going to Wuzhou (VI)

Chen Baibin's speculation was obviously more in line with the facts. The two faced each other, silent. Obviously, the things brought out by coming to Wuzhou were not as simple as just Xie Erren.

After a long time, Chen Baibin said: "After the recovery of Wuzhou, Xu Ke wrote a specific field report, mentioning the battle of Bangshan."

"The matter of the outflow of Nanyang rifles?"

"You probably didn't look closely. According to this report, the retainers at Bangshan were not only equipped with Nanyang rifles but also had improvements in tactics and fortifications. At that time, Xu Ke suspected that there were traitors from the Fubo Army among the enemy."

"It seems this traitor is Jiang Suo."

"Only this possibility remains."

"I think we should first access relevant materials from the Political Department of the Fubo Army, and it won't be too late to draw a conclusion after seeing the materials." Ji Xin said, "Yi Haoran's confession mentioned that he was once responsible for the recruitment of the retainer team, so he should have a relatively good understanding of Jiang Suo. We can ask him again."

Interrogating Yi Haoran again, he didn't hide anything either, telling the past events of how he met and knew Jiang Suo, and how he recommended him to Xiong Wencan and got him appointed.

"...General Jiang abandoned the dark and turned to the light, returned to his motherland, was loyal to the King's affairs, and finally was trapped and captured, without losing the word 'loyalty'!" Yi Haoran spoke with forceful resonance, "Before seeing Jiang Suo, I thought the Bandit influence was monstrous and hard to resist. Only after seeing him did I know that in turbulent times there are naturally loyal ministers. Although the Great Ming is in imminent danger, it has not yet lost the Mandate of Heaven..."

Chen Baibin secretly criticized in his heart: *An exile, having been a soldier for a few days and learned some chicken feathers and garlic skins (trivialities), is blown up into a "Defender of the State". And pulling what "Mandate of Heaven is not lost", the brain circuits of this bunch of literati are truly peculiar one by one!*

Ji Xin didn't refute his remarks. In his view, letting them fully express their inner thoughts made it easy to obtain some extra intelligence.

Sure enough, Yi Haoran spoke smoothly and unconsciously let slip a sentence: "...Even Master Chang was overwhelmed with admiration for General Jiang's heart of loyalty to the sovereign and serving the country..."

Wait until Yi Haoran stopped speaking, Ji Xin asked: "Who is this Master Chang you mentioned?"

"Master Chang Qingyun." Yi Haoran didn't hide it at all.

"Chang Qingyun?" Ji Xin seemed to have seen this name somewhere. Thinking again, he was mentioned in the report on the Sanhezui camp. He seemed to be Xiong Wencan's staff, a *Juren* degree holder, who became Liu Youwang's "dog leg" (lackey) in the camp.

"What is your relationship with Chang Qingyun?"

Only now did Yi Haoran feel he had misspoken. But on second thought, Chang Qingyun obviously wasn't captured, and the dirty work he did in the camp couldn't be exonerated anyway, so he frankly said: "I am an old friend with him in Governor Xiong's staff."

"So, he is also one of your gang."

"This is natural. Master Chang is also a scholar loyal to the sovereign, what is impermissible?"

Originally Ji Xin and others only suspected that Sanhezui and the riot inside the city were connected. Now since Yi Haoran confessed so, the relationship between the two was nailed on the board.

The two organized Yi Haoran's confession, then cross-referenced it with the investigation records from Sanhezui and related reports of the whole event to summarize and organize. Listing the timeline of events, they roughly clarified the ins and outs of this Wuzhou riot.

Obviously, in this Wuzhou riot, Yi Haoran was the undisputed core figure. Although the initial cause of the riot didn't start from him, without him running around and contacting people in between, even if the riot in Wuzhou happened, it wouldn't have made the Senate so embarrassed.

Secondly was this "Master Chang". Looking from Yi Haoran's confession, the chaos at Sanhezui was basically facilated by him single-handedly. Although Chang Qingyun escaped the net, from Yi Haoran's indirect testimony, Chang Qingyun catered to Liu Youwang's whims, seduced him to further corruption and degeneration, causing great public grievance in the camp, and finally introduced insiders through the relationship of handling the opera troupe and unpacking opera chests... The whole routine could be called intricately linked.

As for Jiang Suo, he was instead not such a critical figure. The role he played in this event, besides running back and forth for contact, was a warrior charging in front.

"I think the course of events is roughly clear." Chen Baibin said, "The main unclear part now is the Cai Lan part. From the currently mastered data, Chang Qingyun also had contact with Cai Lan."

"Of course there was contact." Ji Xin said, "We just haven't obtained the confession. This matter probably has to be clarified by directly interrogating Liu Youwang."

"Do we want to interrogate Liu Youwang?"

"No hurry. Since they didn't issue a conclusion, we don't need to rush for a moment." Ji Xin said, "We have enough data from the captives now. Now talk to retained personnel and naturalized cadres."

The most important among naturalized cadres were three people: Luo Yangming, Zhao Fengtian, and Zheng Ergen.

But Ji Xin's attitude was not to talk to them first. Luo Yangming mastered too much truth; once talking, it was equivalent to playing the King Bomb. And Zhao Fengtian and Zheng Ergen were under Xie Erren's command; talking was equivalent to asking them to state their stance. This was a lot of pressure for naturalized cadres, and they inevitably did some shameful things for Xie Erren. Whether confessing under pressure or resisting to the end, it was absolutely not a good thing for naturalized cadres.

"It's not easy for us to train naturalized cadres. These few count as elites. Cannot push them onto a dead end..." Ji Xin said, "Talent is rare."

"But they followed Xie Erren and did quite a few... quite a few... unpresentable things. Wouldn't it be too cheap for them if we just let them go lightly? This tends to encourage the unhealthy trend of soldiers belonging to generals."

"Factions and mountain-strongholds have existed since ancient times, and our Senate is no exception. Naturalized cadres attaching themselves to a certain Senator is extremely normal. Doing things violating regulations or even laws isn't a rare thing either. We can't put an end to this kind of thing, let alone eradicate it." Ji Xin smiled bitterly, "If in the old spacetime, there's nothing to say, uneven ground just shovel it flat. There are plenty of people to fill the vacancy. But here it won't do, we lack people. Sometimes we can only look at problems from the perspective of protecting people first. The same charge, placed on naturalized citizens is a monstrous crime, placed on others may not be. Besides, one active one forced, there is still a difference."

Chen Baibin pondered the meaning in his words, understanding he hoped Xie Erren would bear the main responsibility. This way the punishment for naturalized cadres wouldn't be too heavy. Otherwise, once the hat of "deceiving the Senate" was put on Zhao Fengtian, Zheng Ergen and others, basically they couldn't turn over. The best result would be going to Kaohsiung or Jeju to be cadres.

"What if..."

"I think he won't fail to understand. The Senate could even tolerate Dugu Qiuhun (Dugu Proposing-Marriage); what can't be forgiven about this bit of his romantic crime? If he really makes his trusted aides take the blame, how can he come out to work again in the future? He should be able to figure out this key point. The most worrying thing now is that there are too many people wanting to eat Wuzhou's human blood buns right now; we cannot but be cautious."

In the next few days, Ji Xin and Chen Baibin summoned naturalized citizens and retained personnel in batches. Among them were National Army soldiers who fought that night, retained personnel in the yamen, and captives and refugees who didn't flee from the Sanhezui camp...

All personnel were directly summoned by people sent by Ji Xin, and then interrogated one by one. From their mouths, important intelligence was soon learned. Among them, Cai Lan's matter was especially strange, because any relevant personnel involving her had all disappeared: either died in the riot that night or "went missing". Even the two female servants guarding her when Cai Lan committed suicide were so.

Although the report said Cai Lan "served" in the San Zong Fu doing some simple paperwork, in the interrogation, actually not a single colleague of hers was found. Most people didn't know there was such a female retained staff member in the San Zong Fu.

This abnormal behavior basically confirmed that Cai Lan not only had an improper relationship with Xie Erren, but also played a quite important role in the riot that night. So much so that Xie Erren spent great effort to "clean up" all relevant personnel who knew the detailed situation.

As for what kind of role she played, probably only Zhao Fengtian and others knew.

However, from these conversations they also learned quite a lot about the Sanhezui camp, including Liu Youwang's various evil deeds in the camp, Jiang Yougong's participation, and Chang Qingyun's activities. It was said that he became "active" in a short period before the riot—but indeed did many bad things.

Ji Xin also obtained an important piece of information: Chang Qingyun was once called into Wuzhou city, and shortly after returning received preferential treatment, painting in the room every day. Paintings were constantly sent in and out of Wuzhou city, very busy.

Although the person providing this information had low status and wasn't clear why Chang Qingyun was called to paint, nor knew why paintings were transported back and forth, the only person with power to do so was Xie Erren.

Ji Xin had accessed Xie Erren's file before departure. Although he was also a cultured person, from personal background and his relevant self-statement, no special hobby for Chinese painting was reflected, let alone specifically finding someone to exchange paintings—and this practice of only asking Chang Qingyun to paint had nothing to do with exchanging paintings either.

Associating with what Yi Haoran and some others said, that Cai Lan "excelled in painting" (Dan Qing), and the material procurement personnel of the city government also provided information about collecting paints, paper and other painting tools in the city. Correspondingly, this was undoubtedly Cai Lan's hobby, and Chang Qingyun painting was also because of Cai Lan.

"Good guy. Didn't expect him to be a sentimental seed..." Chen Baibin sighed, "So attentive!"

"Scholars are sentimental, and also particular about life tastes, not surprising. Not to mention our current status, what can't we do if we want to. Aren't there Senators in Lingao doing even more absurd things?" Ji Xin smiled, "This bit of his romantic crime really counts as nothing. The bad thing is that such a messy matter happened in Wuzhou, and this Cai Lan is a key figure inside again."
