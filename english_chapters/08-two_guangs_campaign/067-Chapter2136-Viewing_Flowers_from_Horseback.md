# Chapter 2136 - Viewing Flowers from Horseback

"I heard that since Lord Han captured Dateng Gorge, the waterway has been open to boats and merchants."

Though He Dongli wasn't entirely ignorant of Australians, the fact that this "Overseas Barbarian" could recall Han Yong's deeds based on a single sentence proved commendable—these events occurred a hundred and fifty years ago! Even locally in Wuzhou, commoners aside, many ordinary scholars wouldn't recognize "Han Yong's" name, much less Dateng Gorge.

"Though Lord Han pacified Dateng Gorge, he actually permitted local Yao caves to collect taxes from merchant vessels crossing the gorge. Since then, Dateng Gorge has remained open to commerce."

"Is the Yao situation peaceful currently?"

He Dongli shook his head slightly. "Though Lord Han pacified the Yao twice, in reality, Two Guangs territory has never achieved true tranquility—it simply hasn't escalated to major crisis!"

Throughout the Gui and West River basin mountains surrounding Wuzhou, Yao and Zhuang stockades proliferated. Though most possessed appointed native officials and chieftains, most in reality "refused to submit to imperial civilization." Various uprisings rose continuously. Even capable officials like Han Yong and Wang Shouren could only govern peacefully for decades; trouble inevitably erupted again afterward. The so-called Yao-Zhuang uprisings carried no novelty for an old Wuzhou resident like He Dongli.

Xie Erren fell silent. Viewing the collapsed barbican outside Dezheng Gate and the mutilated battlements, parapets, and defense towers scarring the city wall, his heart grew heavy. *The artillery bombardment was too fierce then! How long will repairs require!*

The city wall stood approximately eight meters high—a quite respectable height. Xie Erren extended his neck beyond the parapet to peer downward, feeling that once the wall was repaired, safety would remain assured.

Observing his concern for city defenses, He Dongli informed him that five hundred sixty-nine defense towers stood along the city wall, plus thirty-six watchtowers housing guard soldiers. However, only Dezheng Gate possessed a barbican.

"Zhao Fengtian!"

His secretary immediately followed, clutching a small notebook and pen—Xie Erren's preferred style, issuing "instructions" at every opportunity.

"Upon return, instruct the Rehabilitation Bureau to prioritize manpower and resources for repairing the city wall and defense facilities!"

"Yes, Chief." Zhao Fengtian hastily recorded it.

Descending from the wall, Xie Erren followed He Dongli's guidance to inspect the city. Commerce indeed flourished here. According to He Dongli, eleven *fang* markets existed within the city alone. East of the Prefectural Yamen gate lay the Prefectural East Market, one of the two most prosperous markets. Walking along, shops lined the street in great numbers. Though pedestrians remained scarce, most shops had reopened their doors, and street barricades everywhere underwent repairs. Xie Erren observed the scenery throughout. Though fires had occurred within the city, damage wasn't excessive—only these structures proved too unsafe. He privately complained: *Most residential shops are either wooden or bamboo-fence-and-mud construction. Whatever fire prevention measures exist, the best are merely river mussel shells inlaid. Apart from government offices, temples, and a few major shops and mansions, almost no brick-and-stone buildings exist.*

*If Xiong Wencan had truly succeeded in setting fires, wouldn't this have become a sea of flames!* Xie Erren inwardly clicked his tongue.

Even without entering shops, merely judging from signs and displayed wares, the local commodity economy possessed considerable scale. Goods represented extremely diverse types, with various industries clustering together. As a former journalist, Xie Erren possessed substantial observational power regarding commercial environments.

"I hadn't expected Wuzhou's commercial market to flourish so vigorously." Xie Erren had visited numerous county and prefecture cities. Honestly speaking,除了 Lingao under Senate rule and the newly liberated Guangzhou and Foshan Town, no town in Hainan or the Two Guangs could rival Wuzhou.

Witnessing this, Xie Erren's previously dimmed spirits revived. *This place possesses tremendous potential! Indeed, risk accompanies opportunity. As long as I can firmly hold Wuzhou City and manage it methodically, I dare not aspire to become Guangdong Province's number two, but number three will certainly be attainable. Moreover, this constitutes an important commercial gateway to Guangxi and the interior.*

He gazed into the distance, viewing three rivers converging near Wuzhou City, with mountains encircling it beyond. "Leaning on Tea Mountain, facing Gui Water, with the Great River winding before"—known as the "Scenic Equal of Lingao"—this praise indeed proved no exaggeration.

"Truly worthy of the three-river convergence and two-province thoroughfare!" Xie Erren praised. *This splendid and magnificent landscape now belongs to our Senate!* At this thought, excitement surged through his chest.

Ming Dynasty Wuzhou already functioned as an important Two Guangs commercial center economically. Since antiquity, Wuzhou had served as a major Lingnan inland river port with obvious locational advantages. One could travel upstream to Nanning, Liuzhou, and Guilin, reaching deep into the Great Southwest, or proceed downstream to the Pearl River Delta, directly to Guangzhou and Macao. This granted Wuzhou Port functions as both inland river and coastal port. During the Qin Dynasty, the Lingqu Canal opened, connecting the Yangtze and Pearl River systems. "Northern waters flow south, northern boats cross the ridge," establishing Wuzhou Port's critical Lingnan status. During the Han Dynasty, Wuzhou Port gradually developed into a Guangdong-Guangxi water transport hub. From the Tang Dynasty onward, Wuzhou Port operated wooden sailing ships traveling to Guangdong's coast. Thereafter, numerous Guangdong merchants traveled upstream to trade in Wuzhou. Though located in the inland mountains at the Two Guangs junction, it enjoyed coastal port conveniences. Many "foreign goods" proved commonplace in Wuzhou, and "Australian goods" circulated widely.

Xie Erren assumed control over such territory—honestly, if Wuzhou weren't situated on the "frontline," given his abilities and resume, he couldn't have secured Wuzhou's mayoral position.

"The Master speaks truly." He Dongli glanced at this Australian; his face virtually read "Establish Merit and Build Career." Only, though Wuzhou possessed merit, establishing one's position depended on capability.

He Dongli harbored no particular bias: the Great Ming had treated him generously, and he held no enmity toward Australians. Regarding which possessed superior prospects, anyone not blind who'd toured Qiongzhou Prefecture would find the answer obvious. But Qiongzhou Prefecture was merely a small place; governing all Guangdong successfully demonstrated true capability. Particularly current Wuzhou, where internal and external environments proved extremely complex. Senator Xie's actual capabilities remained genuinely uncertain.

"This prefecture has constituted the Two Guangs thoroughfare since antiquity, a gathering of boats and carts, an accumulation of goods, and a congregation of all crafts." He Dongli observed. "Truly excellent land! Only, recent great battles severely injured its vitality! Master, please observe..." He gestured outside the city.

The Gui and West River banks beyond the city previously hosted market wharves. War devastation destroyed more than half. Surveying the scene, broken walls and ruins dotted every vista. Along the bank shoals, sunken ship wreckage and scattered timber protruded above water everywhere.

"Upon this river surface originally existed 'water execution markets.' Beyond Dan household boats, merchant vessels gathered from all directions, merchants constructing shops upon bamboo and wooden rafts for vending goods. In peaceful times, connected wooden rafts moored along the river here, presenting magnificent spectacle. Small boats shuttled throughout the day; at night, lights merged in patches, voices boiled, and wares-hawking continued endlessly. Outsiders considered it marvelous scenery." He Dongli's words carried infinite regret.

"Where are these wooden raft merchant ships?" Xie Erren felt somewhat puzzled. *I observed nothing arriving here.*

"Those capable of fleeing fled. Those wooden rafts unable to flee also transported their goods away. The remainder burned clean during city defense and siege days ago."

"What a tragedy!" Xie Erren shook his head. "We must restore it immediately!"

He Dongli remained less optimistic—Australians had always valued commerce, and he believed Master Xie spoke sincerely. Still, with warfare turmoil surrounding Wuzhou presently: Governor-General Xiong's troops hovering nearby, plus merchant reports of West River Yao cave instability. This Chief would succeed admirably merely keeping Wuzhou's four borders secure.

Walking along the city wall, they proceeded entirely to the "Three General Headquarters" in the city's east.

Viewing from the wall, these Three General Headquarters possessed enormous scale, four vast courtyards occupying several dozen *mu*. He Dongli explained these Three General Headquarters were established during Emperor Xianzong's Chenghua years following Han Yong's recommendation. They comprised the Governor-General of Two Guangs' Office, the Commander-in-Chief's Office, and the Grand Commandant's Office.

The architectural layout centered on the Governor-General's Office. The Governor-General's Office occupied an earthen mound in the city's northeast, the highest city point. The Commander-in-Chief's Office stood right of the Governor-General's Office, the Grand Commandant's Office left. The Three Offices Conference Hall fronted the Governor-General's Office. They formed a vast administrative complex for the Governor-General of Two Guangs, Commander-in-Chief, and Eunuch Grand Commandant to respectively reside, work, and hold discussions.

"Wuzhou hosted eunuchs?" Xie Erren knew from history lectures that the Governor-General of Two Guangs originated in Wuzhou, but hadn't expected the Eunuch Grand Commandant's station here as well.

"Indeed, they stationed here previously. Later, the Governor-General's Office relocated to Zhaoqing, no longer stationing internal officials here. However, tax eunuchs returned during the Wanli years."

Xie Erren followed He Dongli before the Governor-General's Office. Flanking the main gate, left stood the Opening Office Stele, right the Nominating Stele. Memorial archways also fronted the gate. The southern archway read: "Controlling Two Domains"; the eastern archway: "Lingnan Seas Tranquil and Clear"; the western archway: "People and Goods Peaceful and Abundant." The style proved impressive, but since the Governor-General of Two Guangs relocated to Zhaoqing, the Three General Headquarters had actually forfeited their function. Vacant for many years, the buildings inevitably deteriorated. Additionally, positioned close to the eastern wall and immediately beside Yangming Gate, they suffered serious artillery damage during battle. Traces of pierced and collapsed roofs and walls marked them.

Several yamen runners and gatekeepers still guarded here, appearing listless. Seeing the "Australian Master" arrive, they hurriedly rose to welcome him.

The accompanying old clerk instructed: "Open all main gates, invite the Chief to inspect!"

Xie Erren entered the Governor-General's Yamen following the clerk. Because Xiong Wencan had recently stationed here, the interior had undergone some renovation and repair, appearing less desol than the exterior. However, judging from small trees and weeds upon the roof, abandonment here had persisted quite long.

The couplet before the Governor-General's Office main hall read: "Opening Office in Wuzhou, Controlling Hundred Yues," contrasting with the chaos left by panicked flight and rogue soldier looting during the city breach days ago, carrying distinctly ironic flavor.
