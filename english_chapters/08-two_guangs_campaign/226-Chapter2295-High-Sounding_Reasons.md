# Chapter 2295: High-Sounding Reasons

However he thought of another matter. Although he had no culture, but when wandering in childhood also listened to village old people telling ancient stories. Inside spoke: ancient big officials favored ministers to verify if Emperor’s favor trust not declining, would deliberately submit memorial, requesting some non-appropriate graces.

If Emperor agreed at once, indicating still favor trusting self; if agreed after hesitation, then favor trust already declined; if refused immediately, then arrived time of telling old returning home.

Now self also could use Opera Chest matter to test Chief Xie’s view on self. If trusting added to self, then next he could slowly think method driving Jiang Yougong away.

As for that matter self did in camp, Sanheui Camp basically was a closed camp; inside besides him, no second naturalized citizen cadre. Jiang Yougong responsible for outer perimeter supervision alert was breathing same air with him again. Retained personnel even no one dared provoke his tiger whisker—after all in camp he controlled life death great power. He even though did many things provoking civil anger inside. But captives and refugees at least livelihood no worry, wouldn't make trouble either.

Thinking so he heart had bottom; today specially came to see Xie Erren.

"You have what work to report?"

"Is like this." Liu Youwang on stool carefully landed seat (sat down), "I in Sanheui Camp, ran an Opera Troupe."

"Oh, Opera Troupe?" This matter really fresh! Xie Erren thought.

"Yes," Liu Youwang heart thought this had to see if routine Chang Qingyun taught him correct or not, "In camp captives originally had wealthy family big house’s family kept opera troupe personnel; actors and musicians both have. Outside coming refugees also possess such people. I contemplated, camp holding so many captives and refugees; although Senate gives them rice eating, letting them work, after all is group gathering several thousand people; not giving them some pastime, suppressed long, afraid will make out chaos."

Speaking here he looked at Xie Erren’s face; seeing his face color as usual, then bolded guts continue saying: "So I contemplated organizing them, getting a troupe acting opera; one providing some pastime entertainment for everyone; two also can serve as a position of Art Literature Propaganda..."

This scratched Xie Erren’s itchy place. He himself was Art Propaganda background; in Lingao also mixed quite a few mass propaganda activities; on this aspect could be called both having theory and having insight. After arriving Wuzhou also counted small test cow knife, did quite a few propaganda work—although condition limited, only could brush slogans on wall, get some newspaper reading board and so on.

He carefully sized up sturdy man before eyes; how also couldn't imagine such a rough man surprisingly could think of "Art Literature Weapon"—truly person can't judge by appearance. Senate’s influence on people indeed powerful. Thinking here, Xie Erren sincerely praised Senate.

Liu Youwang seeing Chief Xie staring at self, involuntarily calf belly soft, heart empty. Idea Chang Qingyun coming out for him was lifting Opera Troupe to "Art Literature Propaganda" this height to blow big blow special; definitely could move Chief Xie’s heart—because Australians loved this mouthful most.

Chang Qingyun squatting in POW camp for a few years in Lingao, although on flesh body was torture to him; afterwards he also felt was a rare cultivation. In Lingao, he saw many things never thought in dream; through Hair thief’s words actions and policies, more or less could figure out their thoughts. Remembering self cognition to Hair thief before Chengmai Great Battle back then, simply innocent like child, yet was that arrogant big.

Now idea he came out for Liu Youwang, not only catered Hair thief’s taste, more was figuring out Chief Xie this person—this ability he originally was very big. These days in captive camp, either going out handling affairs or listening people talk, basically touched through Xie Hair’s temper hobby. So taking this idea out counted having arrow released at target. Dare not say hundred percent useful, but definitely could hit target.

His judgment indeed not wrong; Xie Erren’s face floated out smile: "Your idea very good ah."

Seeing Chief Xie affirming self, Liu Youwang instantly had bottom energy; busy smiled: "This isn't Senate teaches well! Before I read newspaper, Chief said: 'Art Literature is weapon, is position; we want to occupy this position'..."

"Didn't expect your theory level relatively not bad." Xie Erren greatly appreciated him, "Since so, this Opera Troupe you continue running down. Pass some days wait situation stable, maybe want you to come Wuzhou city perform."

"Yes, I recently already called them rehearsing plays—but they currently only know old plays. Want to rehearse a few new plays but no script."

"This easy." Xie Erren this moment mood not bad, "Script, I pass a few days call Joint Logistics send over is fine."

"Too thank Chief’s care." Liu Youwang made grateful expression, "Still has one matter."

"You say."

"Opera Troupe recently rehearsing plays; but no Opera Chest; only can clear sing; no way to perform either." Liu Youwang said, "Later captive said, inside General Town Office has Opera Chests left by Eunuch guarding Wuzhou decades ago. I want to ask instruction, can or not lend these Opera Chests to Opera Troupe temporarily using?"

"Three Headquarters inside still have this?" This somewhat out of Xie Erren’s expectation. According to rule, these things all verified registered by Planning Commission. Part used on spot, part sent back. Opera Chest such thing priority was arranged at last; he applying use on spot had no relation; temporarily borrowing just register a bit then easy.

"This matter easy; I come coordinate a bit then okay." Xie Erren nodded, "You tomorrow bring a few people find Zhao Fengtian, move boxes away is fine—temporarily count lending you use; later supplement procedure. But things you must watch well; can't miss broken."

"Yes!" Liu Youwang attention said, "I will call them cherish well. Chief rest assured."

"I trust pass you." Xie Erren made admiring valuing expression, "Recently grain boat fleet wants to come; you must suppress camp well; cannot make out riot."

"Yes!"

This Advisor Chang really TMD is a talent! Coming out from Xie Erren place Liu Youwang couldn't help patting his own thigh; now looked, not only Advisor Chang capable, Chief Xie also very trusting self; then getting Jiang Yougong killed pointing day can wait!

August 4th early morning, 1st Squadron boarded Inland River Fleet’s patrol boats departing from Wuzhou; started their patrol work. This time patrol different from past—usually patrol was same day return. But today, they had to patrol all way to Fengchuan County city, waiting there for grain transport boat fleet arrival then escort return.

Qian Duo stood on Nanxun Gate tower watching boat fleet spraying black smoke slowly leaving; heart somewhat seven up eight down. After 1st Squadron departed, Wuzhou’s defense strength was severely weakened. Huge a city pool only left company under his hand to guard.

Gazing far at Sanheui; floating bridge locking river; cooking smoke curling in camp. Various barracks all transmitted bugle sound. Hearing bugle sound, Qian Duo’s heart slightly settled. This National Army 3rd Squadron at Sanheui now became only external aid he could rely on.

However he not relieved about 3rd Squadron and Jiang Yougong—Jiang Yougong’s old army habit very thick; subordinates mostly were reorganized Ming Army surrendered soldiers; saying going on battlefield killing combat power still had some; but discipline loose; tenacity insufficient. Key moment couldn't count on.

"Transmit my order; today Dezheng Gate not open; only open four gates. Various sentries and patrol teams reduce half."

Reducing city gate sentries and patrol teams, this way he could separate out a platoon people resting during day, shouldering night duty work.

Gap of sentry and patrol work, he gave to "Security Team" under command of Zheng Ergen to responsible. These people mostly were retained yamen runners and poor people recruited on spot; purely acting as Door God maintaining security.

"Battalion Commander Zhu, you look we now still have what place needing strengthen?" Qian Duo asked.

Zhu Si now empty had a National Army Battalion Commander title, actually became a bare pole commander. In city he only left two guards and a messenger able to command directly. Whole day he accompanied Qian Duo wandering everywhere; following behind shouting one calling six.

Wuzhou Integrated Squadron victory reports frequently transmitted; Li Dong and his subordinates' names appeared on army internal commendation notice many times; making Zhu Si looking very uncomfortable.

"Li Dong this brat true TMD walks dog shit luck!" Zhu Si now had huge sense of crisis; Li Dong’s squadron performance so eye snatching; holding merit receiving reward promotion was very fast thing; maybe not long would adapt into Fubo Army—such thing already had precedent on Two Guangs battlefield; he then was dignified Fubo Army Captain; before self then could shake up... thinking past self had quite a few difficult places to him; in case developed want to revenge self how to do?

However, he secretly comforted self again, soldier danger war fierce; this North Guangdong battle ten days half month couldn't finish either; maybe what time directly small life sent—National Army casualty not small; from time to time had news of certain squadron whole army annihilated or heavy damaged.

Compare down, self staying in Wuzhou actually peaceful no matter; as long as war affairs smooth, finally arguing merit awarding reward promotion always couldn't lack him; thinking here he open minded again.

Hearing Qian Duo ask, he immediately answered: "Company Commander Qian arranged very in place. I have nothing good to supplement. Night military force although few, but we have city wall city gate; after closing city gate don't say small group enemy, even several thousand Ming Army can't rush break."

This didn't count exaggeration. Wuzhou city wall after repair, any enemy wanting to attack city under Fubo Army fire power, had to equip cannons and various siege machines.

"Surrounding situation?"

"Detective Team came back last night reporting: within 15 kilometers from city didn't discover large group enemy."

Qian Duo didn't speak; truth to tell if responsible for scouting was Fubo Army, then he indeed was reassured; but Detective Team this kind fish dragon mixed retained personnel team, truly made people hard to trust.
