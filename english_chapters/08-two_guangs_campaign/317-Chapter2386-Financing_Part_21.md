# Chapter 2386: Financing (Part 21)

Then I'd definitely find a way to squeeze out liquidity... Oh, you mean the situation where the successor isn't my wife...

"Once this precedent is opened, those bearing the risk are either brothers on the same boat, or our brothers' children." Liu Xiang earnestly advised: "We're just a small circle, bump into each other constantly. No matter the position, no matter the work one leads, when the final decision is made, who has more votes than whom? Now, the spacetime we're in is not the original one!"

Hearing this, Zhou Wei was silent for quite a while before saluting Liu Xiang again, not knowing what to say.

"I don't care about the fundraising methods. I just ask you, do you really have no collateral on hand?" Liu Xiang brought the topic back to the beginning.

Zhou Wei thought carefully, abandoned the "coax coax coax" approach, and said to Liu Xiang: "The Southeast Asia Company's inventory check isn't complete yet. Mainly because the inventories and contracts at various trading posts scattered across the South China Sea are really hard to quickly verify, so I can't say much about the overall company valuation either..." Especially since the original Southeast Asia Company had 49% of shares belonging to the absorbed pirate groups. The Southeast Asia Company's assets were transferred, the state-owned shares were moved away—how to handle this 49%? This was a big mine. Without clearing it, he, Zhou Wei, didn't dare use the Southeast Asia Company's name at all.

"What's completely usable now are just 47 trading ships currently operating. The ships themselves are valued at... roughly between 100,000 and 140,000. Then there are the trade orders these ships are currently running and the long-term contracts already confirmed for this year, but these also need to wait for the inventory check to finish before there's any conclusion." Zhou Wei unhesitatingly followed the "pawn pawn pawn" approach and offered up the old sailing trade ships that were already planned for phasing out in the next year or two.

"Get the asset information like ship conditions, trade records, etc., and prepare some materials as soon as possible. At least there's some basis." Liu Xiang finally relented after hearing there was actual collateral. "The first phase doesn't need to be too stingy either. With these ships, you might as well take bigger steps."

Hm? Opening it up this big all at once?

"Also, forget about bundling the urban construction fund. Your Nanyang Company, as a national policy company, has so many people watching! I won't compete with you for money." Liu Xiang also released goodwill.

Huh? There's such a good thing? Zhou Wei felt something wasn't right—a feeling of being a steak getting rubbed with red wine while being massaged.

"But, this fundraising matter..."

Sure enough, nothing good! This is getting the blowtorch—fifteen seconds on each side!

"Those brothers over there proposed establishing a 'Guangzhou Investment Development Bank.' I think it's great! Why not put the Nanyang Company fundraising platform here?" Liu Xiang smiled and suggested. "Of course, if you think private placement is more efficient, you can also go the private placement route. I support that!"

Ha! You're not competing for money! You want to hold the money yourself!

"How about... we just... go over together and discuss?" Liu Xiang continued smiling and suggesting.

Zhou Wei finally understood. "So many people are watching! I won't compete with you for money"—this was genuine. But Old Liu couldn't openly grab. Naturally, the people he had offended would stand out to help, both venting their own frustrations and showing their skills to Old Liu. And he still had mud all over himself that hadn't been washed!

From the small conference room to the large conference room was still some distance—going from the west corridor to the middle building, then to the east corridor. The two walked slowly, extracting more information from each other. Zhou Wei also figured out that the leader was Chu He, but the heaviest firepower was Ren Youzi. The two had just received the salute from the guards at the east corridor entrance and turned in. Just a few steps in, they heard a huge voice coming through the not-very-soundproof door of the large conference room.

"The Senate contributes knowledge, manpower, and military! Conquered vast territories!"

"On what basis! These natives! Contributing a bit of silver, can get shares!"

"39%!"

"On what basis!"

"And that whatever state-owned, Senate-owned. This thing is unclear! Is this the Senators' asset, or the government's asset?"

...

Zhou Wei's gaze asked: This is... Ren Youzi?

Liu Xiang's gaze answered: You guessed right, no reward.

Zhou Wei wordlessly looked at the sky—commonly called an eye roll.

Liu Xiang didn't know whether he should spread his hands or tuck his hands... ultimately decided to push the door open.

"Aiya, comrades, let me introduce to everyone!"

"Nanyang Company CEO, Zhou Wei!"

Liu Xiang moved aside, opening the line of sight, using Zhou Wei to cut off the meaningless speech in the large conference room.

Zhou Wei was still thinking about several big mines in his company's equity structure when he was suddenly pushed out to make an appearance. His heart panicked, thinking: you Old Liu have no martial virtue, how did you put me out without any preparation? Fortunately, he had already met with Chu He, defusing the biggest time bomb. He hurriedly clasped his hands in the classic Andy Lau New Year greeting pose, piled his face with apologies, and greeted everyone from left to right. Then he brought out the prepared excuses like "had some internal affairs at home," "trusted the wrong person," "took feathers as imperial edicts" and explained.

Those Senators weren't completely inexperienced newbies. When Zhou Wei's explanation was about to end, the other five looked at Chu He and Ren Youzi. Ren Youzi glanced at Chu He from the corner of his eye. Chu He, having met privately with Zhou Wei earlier, though Liu Xiang was also present, still felt somewhat guilty. After observing, he looked toward Liu Xiang who was watching the show. His look led Zhou Wei to also turn around, looking toward Liu Xiang.

Liu Xiang sat among the several "local faction" Senators, sunk into a rattan chair, hands resting on the armrests, right hand fingers drumming on the armrest one by one in rotation. Only when everyone's gaze had gathered did he speak: "After Comrade Chu He reported the situation yesterday, I felt this probably wasn't an isolated case but likely a common phenomenon—we've overexpanded! It will definitely reduce our control!" Saying this, the "busy" right hand even stretched out to make a chopping motion for effect.

However, several Senators were complaining in their hearts: Can we not use the Paradox worldview?

"So, under the warning of Little Zhou's typical case, we immediately conducted a snap inspection on administrative work style issues. The result was, sure enough, we found quite a few feudal remnants of old rules and bad habits!"

Oh, so this way I'm not an isolated case. As long as I'm mixed in with everyone, I can extricate myself... Wait, under the warning of my typical case?

"However, this matter still needs to follow the legal procedures. Our Senate governs by law! So the final conclusion will have to wait until the investigation of all involved personnel is complete." Saying this, Liu Xiang gave Zhou Wei a seemingly comforting glance. "Now, let's all work together to help sort out the business logic of this national policy company Nanyang Company on our Guangzhou territory. Let's see how we can quickly and well support the establishment of various Nanyang Company businesses, while at the same time bringing more benefits to our Guangzhou's economic development."

After receiving that "comforting" glance, Zhou Wei quickly understood its true meaning—how the final conclusion is made depends on your performance now. The latter sentence set the tone: the establishment must be done, and done successfully, but must "bring benefits to Guangzhou's economic development."

"How about Little Zhou first talks about what we just discussed?" Liu Xiang pointed to the "Meeting Minutes" that had been handed to Zhang Yunmi. Zhou Wei followed the gaze over, but noticed Zhang Yunmi was looking at it while... showing a disdainful expression.

What's going on?! Is she looking down on my proposal or... looking down on Old Liu's notes... Sigh! Old Liu didn't show me the notes to sign when I left the conference room. What exactly did he write?

Zhou Wei actually guessed right. Zhang Yunmi looked at Liu Xiang's "Meeting Minutes," with screens of "That's it?" in her heart, expressing disdain for Liu Xiang's "shorthand" level... Never mind the incomplete shorthand content, this handwriting usually looked fine when he signed things, but when written fast and written a lot... it looked like chicken scratches. Forget it, I'll transcribe it for him.

Seeing Liu Xiang had designated the topic, Zhou Wei detailed the Mekong River Delta development plan again. When it came to the fundraising plan, Chu He's and Ren Youzi's expressions were quite spectacular: this plan was too similar to what they had prepared. After Zhou Wei made the collateral clear, Zhang Yunmi only took 5 more seconds to swiftly finish writing the last row and put down her pen.

After listening to Zhou Wei's speech, everyone's gaze gathered on Liu Xiang again. This surprised Zhou Wei somewhat. Asking Old Liu for something, fawning like this—he could understand. But the local faction, including central commissioners like Wang Qiyi, also giving Old Liu this much face? This "Prefect" was doing pretty well!

Liu Xiang didn't put on airs this time and directly took over to explain: "Little Zhou's proposal makes me very happy. After the plague, we're immediately going to face two consecutive years of drought. But from general ancient texts, we can't find the scale and degree of these two years of drought. Just one phrase 'major drought' passes by. And compared to history, we have an additional burden—the refugees we saved from various places, who historically probably wouldn't have run over to eat rice here. Our Senate definitely has to prepare rations for them too, which will further increase our burden. And Guangzhou, as the preeminent major city of the Lingnan region, plus our 'good name' cultivated over years, will definitely attract large numbers of refugees. So besides intensifying spring plowing preparations, maintaining water facilities, and going to Lingao to beg for food." Saying this, Liu Xiang paused, pointed at his own chest with his finger, then continued: "Now it seems there's another path, which is Little Zhou's proposal."
