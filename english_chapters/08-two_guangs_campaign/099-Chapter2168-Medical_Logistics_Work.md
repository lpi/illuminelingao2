# Chapter 2168 - Medical Logistics Work

This seemingly perfect system operated very poorly in execution due to the shortage of specialized personnel and medical supplies.

In previous wars of the Senate, battles generally didn't last long, and overall casualties were low. By concentrating most health resources for a blitz-style response, results were generally good—except for some severe external injuries and infections, the survival rate for treatment was quite high.

During the security operations on Hainan Island, the troops mostly encountered small bandit groups with few numbers, low quality, and very crude weapons. The Fubo Army generally held absolute advantage, with extremely few combat casualties and even less demand for medical logistics.

Now the situation was completely different. In the security campaign along the West River banks, the enemy was numerous, well-equipped, and mostly very familiar with the terrain and local conditions. By comparison, the National Army, which had taken on most of the routine tasks in the security operations, was often inadequately trained and poorly equipped.

Because many units were reorganized from surrendered troops, their fighting will was poor, and their casualties in battle were much higher than the Fubo Army. After each engagement, the number of wounded requiring processing and evacuation often exceeded the unit's handling capacity.

Bandit suppression operations were mostly conducted at the company/squadron level, with a battalion/brigade's operational area potentially covering several square kilometers. The battlefields were often in mountains and hills, and wounded soldiers at the front had to overcome great difficulties to reach the battalion aid station.

"...Even after they arrive, they don't get much treatment," Lin Motian said glumly. "I've gone down to the units to see. The battalion aid stations can only be called dressing stations. The medics' medical kits have nothing useful in them; they only know basic wound cleaning and bandaging, and can barely do simple fracture immobilization. Slightly complicated wounds are beyond them. In some places, the wounded can't even get drinking water..."

Transferring from dressing stations to the field hospital required first climbing mountains and crossing ridges before switching to boats. The jolting during this transport was more than severely wounded soldiers could bear. And each transfer stage required long waits; many wounded who could have been saved had their conditions worsen during the waiting and eventually died.

The soldiers' own summary was roughly "if you can walk, you'll live" and "getting on a stretcher means death." Lin Motian had to admit these sayings were basically correct.

Long-distance, slow evacuations often left the severely wounded to die after much suffering, so in many cases, the traditional practice of "finishing off" the severely wounded at the company level had revived. While it seemed like a "merciful" case of a quick death being better than prolonged suffering, it actually dealt a massive blow to morale.

"I also know that with our conditions, there's very little we can actually do—especially for the severely wounded... I'm a surgeon myself, and with our conditions, the common large open lacerations, penetrating wounds with organ damage... I know best how many we can actually save. Whether we transport them or not, it's about the same. But the current situation is just too ugly..."

"Don't be too hard on yourself—we in the health sector know all too well what the Senate's medical standards are like; others might not," Liu San also lit a cigar. "How many armies in the 17th century can establish field medical units? Having one is already something! Remember the Austro-Prussian War in the mid-19th century—an army of tens of thousands had only six military doctors! This progressiveness is all relative."

"You're right, but..." Lin Motian still couldn't let it go. The days working at the field hospital had hit him too hard. Knowing how things were and actually experiencing them were two different matters.

"As for the resource problems, don't be too hung up on them either." Liu San consoled him. "Hong Huangnan and I have already discussed it and are preparing to expand the medical evacuation team establishment. Especially stretcher teams—we need to significantly increase them. Also, we need dedicated medical transport boats so the wounded don't have to wait for returning supply ships—even if they die, let them die in the field hospital."

"What about medical personnel?"

"We'll do our best," Liu San said. "As for Senator doctors, there's probably no possibility of increasing them. However, we can bring in another dozen or so medical students being trained to intern here—Chief Shi says these people cannot go to the front lines; their safety must be guaranteed."

Ever since a naturalized medical assistant was unfortunately killed in combat in the North River region, Chief Shi was heartbroken—a "quasi-doctor" qualified by this timeline's standards required over three years of training by the health sector, and that was based on the individual being talented and the Senator doctors teaching diligently. This incident led the General Staff and the Health Department to specifically issue documents requiring the troops to "protect every medical worker's safety."

"I understand."

"Also, a batch of samples of the new first-aid kits you designed have been produced, and some were sent for trial use—I brought a batch over this time."

"Excellent!" Lin Motian's frowning face immediately showed some joy.

The medical kits currently in widespread use by medics were very basic: a wooden stethoscope, a wound-cleaning set, a set of acupuncture needles, a small bottle of alcohol, a packet of hemostatic powder, a small bottle of Xingjun San, a packet of berberine, a small bottle of sulfonamide, a small number of water purification tablets, as well as some gauze, bandages, triangular bandages, and tourniquets. This kit had been in use since just before the Second Anti-"Encirclement" War and had been making do until now.

The new medical kits he had designed were named "Type 35 First Aid Kit" and "Type 35 Military Doctor Kit," designed for distribution based on the original medic's field case, serving as an improved version and an expanded version respectively, in Medic and Military Doctor versions.

The Type 35 First Aid Kit made partial improvements on the original. Two layers of tung oil cloth lining were added inside the original cowhide case to enhance waterproofing. The acupuncture needles and wound-cleaning set were greatly simplified in the medic's first aid kit, with the cleaning set retaining only one each of knife, scissors, needle, and thread. As a supplement, the types and quantities of surgical instruments for battalion-level medical stations were increased. In addition to alcohol, small bottles of iodine glycerin and hydrogen peroxide were added. The variety of Chinese patent medicines was greatly enriched: the original hemostatic powder and berberine had improved formulations, and snake medicine, burn ointment, Angong Niuhuang pills, and oral opium tincture were added. Chemical drugs added oxytetracycline, which could now be produced in mature quantity, and refined morphine specifically for emergency use. Some areas also added pituitary extract and adrenal extract, along with corresponding syringes and needles. Dressings were basically retained, with the addition of five-color casualty tags copied from the PLA: red bleeding tags, white fracture tags, black infectious disease tags, yellow poisoning tags, and since the Fubo Army wouldn't encounter radiation injuries, the blue tags were temporarily designated for "other injuries" such as frostbite, burns, and stings.

The Type 35 Military Doctor Kit was supplemented with more instruments and medicines. Besides discretionary increases in medicines, dressings, and instruments from the first-aid kit, the Military Doctor Kit also added several bottles of saline solution and glucose injection. Additionally, larger quantities and a richer variety of epidemic prevention disinfection drugs were included. Several small medical instrument packs were added, such as small orthopedic packs, wound-cleaning packs, and midwifery packs (to meet civilian needs when stationed locally), as well as a slightly larger general instrument pack simplified and combined from exploratory laparotomy packs and amputation packs—of course, due to current material inadequacies, items like wire saws and Kirchner wires were not included in any of the instrument packs. Splints and plaster bandages were added, as well as simple resuscitator bags, metal tracheal intubation tubes, and metal urinary catheters. Since the size and weight exceeded that of an ordinary field case, the Military Doctor Kit abandoned the backpack design and was instead equipped with detachable handles and wheels for mobility.

"To be honest, the simple resuscitator is controversial. Some think that under current conditions, the significance of transporting and resuscitating field casualties who can't maintain autonomous breathing is very limited, so the simple resuscitator balloon can be left out. But this thing isn't difficult to manufacture, and having one more resuscitation option is good."

"Honestly, nothing is useless, only insufficient." Lin Motian smiled bitterly. "According to my original view, the medic's first-aid kit shouldn't have a wound-cleaning pack at all—just simple bandaging and then evacuation... The complete wound-cleaning pack is in the Military Doctor Kit. But after thinking it over, I felt having not even a needle and thread in the first-aid kit seemed too pathetic, so I added this minimal version. Because the medic's first-aid kit needs to provide the most basic health care not only on the battlefield but also in peacetime, the needle and thread were kept. But in my concept, wound cleaning should be done by the Military Doctor Kit."

"As for the individual first-aid pack, the plan was revised according to your suggestion, but the Enterprise Planning Institute says the current enamel bowl production capacity is insufficient and will have to be added gradually."

The new individual first-aid pack added an enamel bowl and a wide belt. The belt was two fingers wide, made of cotton with numerous holes punched at close intervals, and could be used as a tourniquet. The enamel bowl was for temporarily containing intestines spilling out of abdominal open wounds in injured soldiers—and of course could also be used as eating utensils.

Originally, every Fubo Army soldier had one first-aid pack, but these things had expiration dates, and the Health Materials Factory lacked effective sealing packaging methods, resulting in very short shelf lives for first-aid packs. When expired, they had to be unpacked, re-sterilized, and re-sealed, so inventory was always kept at relatively low levels. Full-scale production only began a few months before the Continental Campaign, but consumption far exceeded prior estimates—the National Army expansion plan had repeatedly grown, and combat intensity was much higher than expected. Currently, first-aid packs couldn't be distributed one per person; basically only the Fubo Army and "veteran National Army" had them. The large batches of "second" and "third" wave mobilized National Army troops had no equipment—in fact, many companies didn't even have medics. After being wounded, there were basically no treatment options.

"This kind of differential treatment has a huge, huge impact on morale," Lin Motian said. "These new National Army troops are mostly poorly equipped to begin with, and their medical equipment is minimal or nonexistent—many soldiers feel discriminated against. In the long run, not only will troop morale not improve, but loyalty might become a problem too: the National Army's desertion rate has been quite high recently."
