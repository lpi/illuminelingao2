# Chapter 2119 - Captured Again

"It's alright—as long as we're alive!" Chang Qingyun said. "If they have any conscience, they'll come back on their own. If they don't want to follow me anymore, let them take the silver and find their own way."

Just as he spoke, Changqing suddenly squeezed through the crowd toward him, crying out when he saw him: "Master!"

"Shh!" Chang Qingyun hastily silenced him. "We're fleeing for our lives—no formalities. Don't give us away!"

Changqing quickly shut his mouth, looked around, then said in a low voice: "Changwei turned bad! He deliberately left me behind and ran off with the silver, mixed in with the crowd!"

"Never mind. When disaster strikes, even husband and wife must look out for themselves. Let him go." Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly. Of the three servants, Changwei had been his favorite. Who would have thought that when the moment came, he would be the one to abscond with the funds.

"Let's go quickly—if we get out, we'll live!" With that, the three of them blended into the crowd and headed toward the river.

A saber suddenly barred their way: "Hand over your valuables!"

Seeing several men in military tunics closing in from left and right, Chang Qingyun knew there was no reasoning with these soldiers now. He put on a fawning smile: "Brothers, we left the city in a hurry and didn't bring any silver. Please let us pass..."

Before he could finish, the lead soldier had grabbed him by the collar, snarling:

"Drop the act, you bookworm. Look at you—soft and pale, with servants in tow. You must be from a big household! Better hand over the silver yourself, nice and dignified, or don't blame this blade for not recognizing faces." With that, he suddenly slashed at Changshan's throat. Chang Qingyun felt something hot and wet splatter his face; Changshan collapsed, legs twitching rhythmically, dark blood pooling around him.

Chang Qingyun was petrified with terror. These soldiers were murdering openly—utterly lawless. He was penniless; if he angered them, he was dead. He stammered: "Brothers... brothers... please don't be rough—I really don't have any money..."

By now he was nearly in tears. He bitterly regretted his rash decision to volunteer. The determination to die a hero's death had vanished; in an instant, his aged mother, wife, concubines, children... all flickered through his mind like a revolving lantern.

Just as Chang Qingyun shut his eyes and awaited death, a string of sharp reports rang out like firecrackers. The sound was all too familiar to him—not a three-eyed blunderbuss, not a matchlock, but the quick-firing guns of the Australians!

At the first shot, Chang Qingyun instinctively dropped into a crouch. From the nearby hillside came a man's voice, amplified so loud everyone could hear:

"All Ming soldiers and civilians, hear this! The Fubo Army of the Great Song has surrounded you. Further resistance is futile..."

"Damn it all—follow me, we'll fight our way out!" The soldier who had confronted Chang Qingyun swung his saber and rallied the scattered troops to charge.

"Whoosh—thunk." A bloody hole exploded from the man's chest; he fell backward in slow motion, landing beside Changshan's corpse.

Everyone within several hundred meters froze.

The voice continued: "...Your resistance is futile. Throw all your weapons on the ground, clasp your hands over your heads, and squat down! The Fubo Army of the Great Song shows mercy to the good and treats prisoners humanely..."

Clang—a saber clattered to the ground. Then came a chorus of weapons hitting the dirt.

All resistance collapsed. No one wanted to test the marksmanship of the Hair-Bandit sharpshooters. Several hundred people squatted in a great mass. Chang Qingyun peeked up and saw ten or so soldiers in short blue tunics descending the slope, each cradling a quick-firing gun fitted with a short blade.

"Have I... been caught again?" Chang Qingyun felt dazed.

What followed was a "familiar routine." First, a dozen Hair-Bandit soldiers spread out along both sides of the road, each crouching with guns still raised—what he knew to be "securing the area."

Two more Hair-Bandits stood on the high ground, directing thirty or forty soldiers to herd the crowd together and begin organizing them. By Chang Qingyun's estimate, there were perhaps five or six hundred people captured alongside him. The soldiers worked in squads of seven or eight, holding their bayoneted rifles, torches lit, dividing the mass of people into small groups. Despite their numbers, the captives didn't dare resist—not a cough among them.

An officer on the high ground pulled out a megaphone and shouted in both Cantonese and Mandarin, over and over: "All women and children, stand up! All men, stay squatting! Anyone who moves without permission—don't blame the bullets for not having eyes."

After repeating this several times, the mass of squatting people began to stir. First a few, then most of the women stood up. The soldiers paid no heed to propriety—they dragged the ones who hesitated to their feet. A few men from wealthy households tried to shield their womenfolk, but one look at the bayonets and they hurriedly squatted back down. All thewoman and children below waist height were grouped in tens, bound by the right arm with rope, and led to the roadside in strings. The women began to weep; the men squatting on the ground joined in with their own wails.

"The rest of you—civilians, stand up! Soldiers, stay squatting!" the officer shouted again. This time a large crowd stood. Chang Qingyun thought: I'm a scholar, not wearing a military tunic—so he stood up too. This time, the soldiers were clearly more cautious, standing outside the group with bayoneted rifles. "Come out one by one!"

The men were also bound in groups of ten and led to the opposite side of the road. Pleas for mercy rose on all sides; some who looked like wealthy merchants were clearly trying to curry favor, pulling out silver and calling cards: "Sir, sir—my family does business with the Austr—ah, with the Great Song, in Guangzhou. The chiefs know my house's name..." The soldiers remained stone-faced, accepting neither silver nor words. They left everyone's belongings alone, letting each person carry their own.

The remaining Ming soldiers numbered only about fifty—some bare-chested with tunics slung over their shoulders, some in armor. By the torchlight, Chang Qingyun could make out four or five different units' insignia. These were apparently the ones who had decided not to risk their luck "striking it rich" inside the city.

The discarded swords, spears, and matchlocks littered the ground. The soldiers didn't bother sorting them; they simply tied up all the prisoners together and held them separately.

"Everyone, calm down. The Fubo Army does not oppress the good or harm prisoners. Women and children will be released as soon as the fighting ends. Except for soldiers, all other civilians will be released after we finish our investigation." Halfway through, a crisp cannon shot suddenly echoed from the direction of Wuzhou city; the crowd flinched.

"Don't be afraid," the officer said, grinning. "That's the Fubo Army's victory signal. By tomorrow morning, Wuzhou city will be back in the hands of the Council of Elders of the Great Song. Everyone will be able to go home soon! As for tonight, I'm afraid you'll have to bear with us for a bit."

The bound prisoners whispered among themselves, but no one dared speak aloud. Keeping their lives was already the best of luck—no one dared hope for more.

"Good thing I'm in the civilian queue," Chang Qingyun thought. "Who knows where the soldiers will be sent for hard labor." He was tied behind a porter, whose greasy back pressed against his chest, making him queasy. He could only close his eyes and endure.

Suddenly, shouting broke out among a group of newly captured soldiers.

"Sir! There's an official over here!"

Chang Qingyun started and opened his eyes. The soldiers were pointing at him—he vaguely recognized them as men from Xiong Wencan's standard battalion.

It's over! Before Chang Qingyun could shrink back, two soldiers had seized him and dragged him before the officers.

Both officers were naturalized locals, speaking official Mandarin with a Qiongzhou accent. "You're a Ming official?"

"No, no—those soldier-scoundrels are lying! Just now they tried to rob me and killed one of my servants. They're trying to frame me—please investigate, Chief..."

But the soldiers raised a clamor:

"Sir! Don't listen to his nonsense! He's Xiong Wencan's staff officer!"

"He was always with Xiong Wencan—Xiong Wencan did everything he said!"

...

Chang Qingyun's face went white; he kept protesting.

"Oh? Then what are you?"

"I'm a merchant—a cloth merchant."

"If you're a cloth merchant, how much does a foot of Songjiang cotton cost? A foot of watered silk? A foot of Shandong homespun? If I want three feet of Songjiang cotton, five feet of watered silk, and six feet of homespun, how much altogether?" the officer asked.

"I..." Chang Qingyun never concerned himself with household expenses at home—how would he know cloth prices? But Changqing was the one who handled shopping; he would surely know. "Sir, I have a servant here—" He turned to look for Changqing. "Sir, if you please..."

Changqing, having no guile, saw his master brought before the officers and looking back for him; he thought his master had made a connection. Excitedly, he waved: "Master! Master!"

He was brought before another officer. "What business does your master do?"

Seeing the officer's pleasant expression, Changqing relaxed considerably. "My master is a provincial graduate—how could he do business?"

Realizing he had slipped, both officers exchanged smiles.

"Men—take them both to the prisoner group! One at the front, one at the rear."

Chang Qingyun cried "Injustice!" but no one paid him any mind. He was dragged to the prisoner group and tied together with the very soldiers who had denounced him.

At a command, the prisoner column moved out first. Escorting soldiers marched ahead with torches; firelight glinted off their bayonets. Chang Qingyun's heart went cold—he wasn't like these common soldiers; he had a "record." If the Hair-Bandits recognized him, this "second arrest" might well cost him his life!

At the thought, his stomach lurched. He couldn't help looking around for a chance to escape. Before the guards could even scold him, the soldiers who had "exposed" him had already hissed at him:

"Hold still! You bookworm!"
