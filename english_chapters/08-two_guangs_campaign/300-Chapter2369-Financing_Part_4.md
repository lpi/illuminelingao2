# Chapter 2369: Financing (Part 4)

Chu He in Jeju Island had a large family, and it was quite eclectic. Moreover, he came to Guangzhou to promote his plan, so naturally, he was not interested in these sensual pleasures.

Although the guesthouse was equipped with a power socket, Chu He did not bring his laptop—the life of this thing was one day less with each day of use, so a paper notebook was more reliable. He opened the notebook, silently pondering how to conduct the "roadshow" when meeting Zhou Wei tomorrow, and occasionally recording the key points he thought of one by one.

The target of his roadshow was not various capital tycoons, but a peer. This was the first time in his career. Chu He felt somewhat uneasy in his heart.

To occupy a decisive position in the future stock exchange, the financing of the Nanyang Company was a game that must be won. Only success was allowed, no failure.

However, in a short while, someone knocked on the door. It turned out to be Manager Gao delivering dinner. Chu He disliked him disturbing him, so he instructed him "not to come again if there is nothing urgent."

After a hasty dinner, Chu He continued to pace and rehearse in the room. Suddenly the door was knocked again.

"Damn it, what is it this time?" He shouted impatiently: "Come in!"

This time it was not Manager Gao, but the guard Pu Zhixian, with some anger on his face.

Chu He knew something was up at a glance and asked: "What happened? Did you see Zhou Wei's secretary? Is the time set?"

Pu Zhixian said indignantly: "I saw her, but this Secretary Miss puts on such great airs. To see her, one has to take a number—there were at least twenty or thirty people waiting outside. I waited for almost an hour to see her, and that was only because I said I was delivering a letter for a Senator that they let me go in first."

"So hot and popular?" Chu He was not surprised.

"Waiting was one thing, but Chief, you don't know that what this Secretary Zhou said was simply infuriating." Pu Zhixian was indignant, "I said I was your guard, coming to find Senator Zhou. She said she hadn't heard of your name and asked what you wanted with Senator Zhou. I said you wanted to discuss Nanyang Company matters with Senator Zhou. Upon hearing this, her face changed instantly. I asked her if Senator Zhou received the telegram you sent him? Guess what she said? She said she had no comment on Senator Zhou's official business. I asked her when Senator Zhou would return, and she also said she didn't know. I had to ask her when an appointment could be made to meet Senator Zhou, and she actually said this had to be approved by Senator Zhou, and anyway, Senator Zhou was very busy these days and had no time. You didn't see her impatient face, Ah Xi Ba... I had no choice but to give her the proposal summary, saying this document was for Senator Zhou and was very important. She took it and threw it into the file basket next to her, then dismissed me. Tell me, why is she so arrogant? Isn't she just a..."

Chu He waved his hand to stop Little Pu's complaints: "Alright, I know." He thought: It seems it's really "when one person attains the Dao, his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven"; a small secretary putting on such big airs. It's not surprising; as soon as Zhou Wei's appointment as General Manager of Nanyang Company came down, countless people must be eyeing him, wanting to get a share of the pie from him. Wasn't he one of them?

"In that case, let's wait and see the situation first. If there is still no news tomorrow or the day after, I will go find him personally."

Unexpectedly, this wait lasted three or four days, and there was no movement from Zhou Wei's side at all. Chu He couldn't hold back and sent Pu Zhixian to inquire a few times. The answers he got were all "General Manager Zhou has no time." When asked when he would have time, it was customarily "No comment on the Chief's official business."

Now, Chu He also began to sit still no longer. If in Lingao, he could just call Zhou Wei's Little PHS directly. But Guangzhou didn't have this thing, and Zhou Wei didn't have a fixed office in Guangzhou, so naturally, there was no office phone. To see him, he could only go to the door, but now with Secretary Zhou as the door god blocking there, he had no way at all.

After waiting for a few days, he decided to find Zhou Wei personally. Even if he wasn't in the office, at least the time had to be finalized.

"Must not get angry." Chu He secretly warned himself before setting off. He said to Pu Zhixian again: "Later when we go to see Secretary Zhou, don't speak, and don't quarrel with her, understand?"

"I understand! But this is indulging her too much; even Senators don't have bigger airs than her..."

"A great man can bend and stretch."

A Senator condescending to see a secretary. This was somewhat losing face. But Chu He knew that this was no longer a rare thing in the Senate. Especially for some big shot-level Senators, the status of their secretaries was at least not something ordinary Senators could ignore. Anyone seeing Hou Wenyong had to politely call him "Secretary Hou." As for Qian Xuanhuang coming out to handle affairs for Speaker Qian, the receiving Senators also had to show "enthusiasm."

"In the final analysis, we are no longer one family. We just sit on the same boat." Whenever Chu He thought of this, he always felt somewhat sad.

However, this is also the inevitability of historical development, right? A temporary low profile is to strive for a better status. The ancients said: A great man can bend and stretch. For the future positions in the Securities Regulatory Commission and the Stock Exchange, what does a Secretary Zhou count for?

Zhou Wei's temporary office was actually also in the Inner World of the Great World. When Chu He went, although there were quite a few people waiting outside for Secretary Zhou's reception, after he revealed his identity, the clerk responsible for registering numbers immediately took him in.

Before he could walk in, he heard a young woman's crisp voice:

"I cannot reveal General Manager Zhou's work arrangement and schedule; this is the rule." "Even if you are a Senator, it won't work. I cannot violate General Manager Zhou's instructions. Don't make it difficult for me." "I don't know when he will be back." "Please register first. When the Chief has time, he will definitely make an appointment with you." "Just leave the materials here; I will pass them on."

Chu He frowned, thinking that Little Pu indeed didn't exaggerate. Listening to this female secretary's voice, she was a tough one to deal with. He didn't know which Senator was inside; he couldn't even make a sound. He coughed immediately to avoid embarrassment for the person inside. He waited for a moment before walking in.

The office inside was not big, with only one desk. Behind the desk sat a young woman with beautiful features and a pair of very large eyes. Her expression was very different from ordinary female naturalized citizens:
Female naturalized cadres of the Senate were either from bitter backgrounds, entering factories and farms after purification, working hard all the way and being promoted; or they were from Fangcaodi or the College of Arts and Sciences. But whether "grassroots" or "academy background," when facing Senators, their expressions were either worship, awe and fear, or perhaps admiration. But this one had none of these expressions, only a look of impatience.

"Then I'll come again in a few days." The tone of the speaker was somewhat frustrated. It could be heard that it was not his first time here.

"Senator, take care! I will notify you immediately when General Manager Zhou decides to see you."

Chu He thought this was damn well the same meaning as "I'll treat you to dinner when I'm free." Seeing the other party turn around, he was slightly stunned. He knew this person; his name was Ren Youzi, also a peer. A former securities firm employee who fled with money after insider trading was exposed.

Because of such a "glorious history," Cheng Dong didn't like him much and sent him to the Cheka. The Cheka was the place financial migrant workers in the Finance Department least wanted to go. But Ren Youzi was unwilling to change his profession, so he kept muddling along in the Cheka. It is said he also muddled into a position like a division chief—anyway, nowadays as long as one is a Senator, one is definitely a division chief.

"Old Ren!" Chu He called out.

Ren Youzi was startled. Looking up and seeing it was Chu He, a mixed expression appeared on his face, seemingly feeling somewhat awkward about reuniting in such a situation: "Chu He? Why are you here? Didn't you go to Jeju Island?"

"Just came back, just came back," Chu He said, "It's a long story. Why don't you wait for me for a while? After I finish my business, let's go for a drink together?"

"Okay, anyway, I have nothing damn to do." Ren Youzi waved his hand, "You go ahead!"

After Ren Youzi left, Chu He asked about his appointment request and whether the relevant summary had been delivered to Zhou Wei.

"General Manager Zhou has no arrangement to meet with you." This Secretary Zhou didn't even say "please sit." Rolling her eyes, she directly took out a large notebook and flipped through it a few times, "Until next Monday, General Manager Zhou has no free time."

"Then what about his recent schedule? I'll go find him myself."

An undisguised impatience appeared on Secretary Zhou's face. It could be seen that she was trying hard to make her expression look better:

"This, forgive me for not being able to reveal General Manager Zhou's work schedule. This is confidential."

"Is it confidential to Senators too?"

"This is the rule; don't make it difficult for me." Secretary Zhou squeezed a trace of a smile on her face, "I have registered your appointment request. If General Manager Zhou doesn't arrange it, I can't do anything either..."

"Then what about the summary I asked my guard to send? Did Zhou Wei read it?"

"This, I'm not clear. I send all relevant documents to General Manager Zhou every day."

Chu He was about to say something when suddenly Pu Zhixian shouted loudly: "Chief, look!"

Following the direction of his finger, Chu He saw a covered file basket next to the desk. At this moment, the lid of the file basket was half open. Just as he was about to lean closer to look, the previously calm Secretary Zhou stood up from her seat as if a spring was installed on her butt, pouncing over to close the lid of the file basket.

"Stop!" Chu He shouted loudly—he didn't even expect his voice to be so loud. Because in that instant, he saw the corner of a familiar envelope.

This envelope was no different from all Senate official document envelopes, but it had wax seals that he accidentally dripped on when sealing it.

He walked over and took the envelope out. That's right, it was the memorandum he wrote to Zhou Wei. The handwriting on it was clear.

Chu He turned around and asked with a forcibly suppressed voice, trembling slightly: "What is going on here?"
