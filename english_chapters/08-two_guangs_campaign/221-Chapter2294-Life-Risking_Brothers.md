# Chapter 2294: Life-Risking Brothers

Originally he felt stationing at Sanheui was a risky errand—hanging alone outside city, side still had captive camp of several thousand people; really going to happen some incident could be called inside outside pincer attack. Therefore at beginning wasn't willing. Privately complained to Zhu Si several times too.

But days long, he felt this was a good errand instead; although captives in camp many, didn't need him to worry. Australians trained them submissive; although bandit activity outside city, but their task was guarding captive camp; need not go out to suppress specially; as long as controlling surrounding well considered completing task. Bandits also not that hard thinking, coming to attack captive camp directly. So 3rd Squadron besides daily patrolling sentry duty more trivial, almost needed not fight war; had no task either. Counted as leisurely and not dangerous errand.

Jiang Yougong since responsible for guarding camp, naturally had much coming going with camp person in charge Liu Youwang. Truth to tell, Jiang Yougong looked down on naturalized citizen cadres like Liu Youwang, muddy leg background and mixing out no fame.

Looking down returning looking down, resources and prestige this Liu Youwang mastered made him envy incessantly. These several thousand people all grasped in this Camp Manager hand; exactly called wanting him round then round, wanting him square then square. In Sanheui, Liu Youwang was Earth Emperor.

National Army treatment although not counting bad, stationing outside city, had no enjoyment to speak of. Sanheui inside was different; inside not only had market, also had women. Need not spend a few money could soul vanish one night; National Army and even Fubo Army officers soldiers when not on shift coming here quietly "Spring wind once" was already not some secret. Jiang Yougong no exception.

Liu Youwang, although having more than two hundred claws and teeth under hand, all were local retained personnel; following him bullying common people captives no problem; really meeting hard stubble fundamentally not useful—moreover still outside city! Quite a few people in camp were past government army captives; really going to cause trouble he couldn't suppress either. So added intention roping in Jiang Yougong; from time to time invited him and subordinate officers, soldiers to drink wine, play women.

Because having this benefit, Jiang Yougong towards Liu Youwang this vulgar rude ramming goods also endured—anyway had him being host. On surface two people false emotion fake intention, hitting fiery hot.

Jiang Yougong since returned to National Army, returning to Farm being worker again—even semi-detached Militia Captain he felt unwilling. Where had being soldier free. Especially this National Army, need not go to battle fighting hard war. Doing all were jobs like guard alert; no worry of life.

Since wanting to mix down in troop, Jiang Yougong’s first thought was finding backing mountain. He was Guangdong Government Army surrendered soldier background; also separated from troop for several years; no human connections usable. Therefore he placed object of fawning on Zhu Si.

Zhu Si in his view was a very suitable object: qualification old enough; participated action in Shandong; Australians trusted him; re-enlisting not long appointed him as Battalion Commander; he was also government soldier background; both sides background same; easy to same voice common energy.

Jiang Yougong was an old soldier ruffian; mixing in government army for dozen years; even served as whistle officer; how could big head soldier like Zhu Si represent his opponent; by his three two moves methods coaxed down. Felt this Squadron Commander Jiang was much stronger than Li Dong those few officers not knowing interest.

Don't look Zhu Si served as Battalion Commander, counting as "Official Luck Prosperous"; actually he was quite uneven about own situation. Always felt self in Shandong credit very big, yet didn't get reward. Arriving here becoming this "National Army Battalion Commander"—position although not low, Zhu Si felt self should serve as a proper officer in Fubo Army more, instead of serving in National Army everyone looked down one eye, doing miscellaneous works.

Li Dong these people were even incompatible with him like square peg in round hole. He had a feeling. Australians actually liked officers like Li Dong more, not him. This time Wuzhou Integrated Squadron going on expedition to North Guangdong, was Li Dong serving as Squadron Commander. Seeing their position in Australian heart.

This sense of loss made him quickly regard other party as "Confidant" under Jiang Yougong’s twisting will flattering. Jiang Yougong from time to time in name of inviting him "Inspect Work" pulled him to Sanheui eating drinking playing having fun—anyway these were all provided by Liu Youwang; he cost not a penny; counted borrowing flower offering Buddha.

Liu Youwang naturally was suitable happy about matter of fawning local National Army Battalion Commander. These three people gathering together, could be called "Smell appealing to each other."

Originally this enjoyment was conducting secretly; but following Wuzhou troops and cadres continuously deploying to Guangxi, Xie Erren busy with supply and bandit suppression, couldn't attend to Sanheui side—to him, currently Sanheui as long as no accident, working normally was fine; Liu Youwang and others started somewhat unbridled. Chang Qingyun’s suggestion of making opera troupe although was throwing its favorite, was also bowing meeting its time.

Recently because had huge batch grain transferring to Wuzhou, Zhu Si however muddled also knew this was first class big matter; therefore dared not consume much time in Sanheui; these days all wandering inside outside city, inspecting rectifying defense.

This Wuzhou defense, truth to tell Zhu Si was not quite reassured—if not had Qian Duo’s company suppressing in city, he really felt this Wuzhou simply was singing Empty Fort Stratagem.

He inspected at various city gates; because Integrated Squadron transferred away, 1st Squadron river patrol and troops continuously reducing personnel; now personnel responsible for standing sentry alert at various places already appeared gap. He discussed with Qian Duo down; decided Wuzhou East West South North various city gates, every direction only open one; to reduce sentry personnel. All guards and night patrol of key places inside city responsible by Fubo Army; 2nd Squadron’s all personnel responsible for 24 hour alert work of various city gates and city walls. 1st Squadron responsible for carrying out river patrol daily served as night reserve team. Calculating this way, personnel barely enough.

"When can this Guangxi be taken down," Zhu Si grumbled, heart very gloomy. These days bandits making chaos everywhere; security pressure everywhere increased steeply. Making him tired of dealing not to say, psychologically also had huge pressure. Sometimes he surprisingly would produce thought of "Whether Australian can't hold up."

This kind or thought he dared not reveal before outsiders; but greatly influenced his state of mind. Making him every time tour inspecting and arranging task having huge fire, easily scolding subordinate officers soldiers; making atmosphere inside Wuzhou Battalion tense.

Jiang Yougong went to calculate with Liu Youwang; had to give this Battalion Commander Zhu "Remove Fire."

"He now has big matter pressing body; naturally heart anxious. You hiding him is fine; why go provoke him again?" Liu Youwang didn't think so, "He doesn't come, we brothers happy ourselves is fine!"

Liu Youwang always felt Zhu Si holding identity, always somewhat "Carrying" (Putting on airs); so behind back often said he "Not a straightforward person."

"Old Liu, you speak easy." Jiang Yougong knew this Liu Youwang belly had no ink, was a vulgar fellow; sometimes couldn't even figure out basic interest relation, "This Zhu Si is National Army Battalion Commander, is my superior!"

"Then what? Here is Sanheui Captive Camp; not his turn to point hand draw foot." Liu Youwang patting belly.

"Yes, yes, indeed not his turn to point hand draw foot. But he is Wuzhou Garrison Deputy Commander, National Army Battalion Commander; one sentence order, can call me 'Rotate Defense', changing 2nd Squadron over—you willing?"

This hit on Liu Youwang's seven inches (weak point). Saying which squadron escorting him no problem. But Jiang Yougong these months already had collusion with him on interest.

Captives and refugees taken in Sanheui Camp passed many times transfer; currently still had three four thousand people. So many people, ration issued daily was a huge number. Here also involved daily work situation, rationing of camp different age gender, different work type... even in Lingao, wanting to make camp orderly and water leak not through was hard to do. Not to mention Wuzhou belonging to "New Area"! Wanting to practice graft was really easiest thing.

Liu Youwang naturally understood how big oil water here; but he chest without a drop of ink; bestowed by Australian literacy education, probably recognized a few characters; wanting him to do refined management was need not think. Xie Erren knew he couldn't do these; if assigning to retained personnel to manage, that equaled using wolf herding sheep. Therefore specific assigning work recording work were responsible by City Government; camp only cared holding record book issuing according to account.

But even so, this issuing link still bad many loopholes to drill. When Liu Youwang just took office, subordinate retained personnel played tricks; monthly "Filial Respect" him money grain. Liu Youwang knew being official had oil water; but how this oil water came, how to get knew nothing. Only could subordinates respect how much accepting how much; no way to dispute.

This Jiang Yougong was different; he lived in army for long time; extremely familiar to practicing graft, embezzling military pay this set. Although in majority situations he was object being embezzled; but various tricks were clear in chest. He usually observed secretly; knew corruption situation here in Sanheui clearly one clear two. Knew what Liu Youwang obtained, was only one tenth of obtained from corruption usually.

Rather than benefit earned by these retained personnel, better let them take—this gang of retained personnel clipping tail dared not compete with them either: need know Sanheui Big Camp was "Military Law Management"; Liu Youwang theoretically couldn't kill people casually, however wanting to kill a few people didn't count difficult.

Under planning of Jiang Yougong this "Dog Head Advisor," Liu Youwang suddenly "Showed Great Divine Might"; first arrested several key retained personnel; beating ones beating, arresting ones arresting; revealed a "Corruption Group." Human testimony material evidence all there; reporting to Xie Erren place, naturally was "Killing one warning hundred," hanging execution. Remaining people none not soul fly spirit scatter. Jiang Yougong took opportunity grasping wealth power here. After a beating, new proportion came out: Liu Youwang shared half, Jiang Yougong took forty percent, handling retained personnel took ten percent.

Now, relation between them rose from wine meat friends to "Life Risking Brothers" (Brothers sharing life and death).
