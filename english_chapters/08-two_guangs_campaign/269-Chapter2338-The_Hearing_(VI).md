# Chapter 2338 - The Hearing (VI)

In this state, Ma Jia proposed many times to "do some work" privately among Senators to improve the situation of the Pol-Sec Bureau, but Zhao Manxiong wasn't enthusiastic about this. Insisting on completely "acting according to regulations". For a time he even felt this Director Zhao's brain was somewhat pedantic, didn't expect this was all his self-protection strategy!

Zhao Manxiong explained various rejected plans, budgets and schemes on the slides unhurriedly. From beginning to end he didn't say "because no money or very little money so we couldn't do it", only explaining due to relevant budgets and plans being rejected by the Senate, so the Pol-Sec Bureau "strictly followed the Senate's will, absolutely not launching and expanding relevant work and business".

"Comrades, I introduce these situations to everyone not intending to shirk responsibility. Our responsibility is naturally unshirkable. Specifically what kind of responsibility my Bureau has to bear, this is completely decided by the Senate. After all the Senate is our highest authority organ. My entire answer to inquiries is here. If everyone still has any questions, please continue to ask."

Next, people asked questions successively again, but already turning over and over not producing any new tricks. Whenever involving specific Pol-Sec work, Zhao Manxiong consistently answered with "A certain work proposed plan and scheme on certain year certain month certain day, File No. XXX, rejected at relevant meeting on certain year certain month certain day, therefore Pol-Sec Bureau strictly followed Senate's resolution, not launching not expanding relevant work".

Such answers often left questioners speechless. Things not even approved in plan naturally couldn't bank on Pol-Sec Bureau to execute. Otherwise this would become "Despising Senate Authority" and "Disrespecting Senator Power".

"Since so, why does the Senate need to set up such a department as Pol-Sec Bureau? Completely unnecessary!" Finally someone said it out.

"Regarding whether Pol-Sec institution has necessity to exist," Zhao Manxiong said calmly, "My personal view is, Pol-Sec Bureau's work is completely necessary, is one of the security foundations of our existence. Our current attention degree to Pol-Sec work is insufficient, investment too little. But, whether an institution should exist, depends completely on the Senate's will. No matter what the result is, I personally and colleagues will unconditionally accept the Senate's decision. But our attitude won't change."

Inquiry reached here, also counted as the dagger revealing when the map was unrolled (intentions fully revealed). Ma Jia was somewhat worried, but he more or less understood Zhao Manxiong's method. Attacks on Pol-Sec Bureau inside the Senate were more and more; relying on being slippery couldn't muddle through. If not forcing inside of Senate to take sides and declare position at this moment, most centrist Senators would be coerced by radical public opinion of a few people. Then the ending of Pol-Sec Bureau would have no suspense to speak of.

Ideally, the venue's emotion was somewhat boiling. Could see quite a few people wanted to come up and beat Zhao Manxiong ruthlessly. Quite a few people were cursed, but not a single one could open mouth to query.

"If everyone has no new queries, this hearing ends here. Relevant materials will be distributed within the Senate range after the meeting. Specific resolution will be made after convening the Senate General Assembly."

After the meeting scattered, Ma Jia made an appointment with Zhao Manxiong to meet in the Pol-Sec Bureau conference room, discussing the next action.

"...You count as tearing the face skin completely." Ma Jia said.

"This piece of paper is sooner or later going to be poked through, better poked through early." Zhao Manxiong said, "Attacks on our department have been completely systematized, even having the trend of transforming into 'Political Correctness' inside the Senate. If we don't interrupt this trend now, later those Senators supporting us won't dare to make voice anymore either."

"However, now it seems our situation is not good..."

"Situation is indeed unsatisfactory." Zhao Manxiong nodded, "To be honest, I also didn't expect their slander and attacks on our department in these years would develop to such a degree, even affecting the views and attitudes of quite a few department chief officials. This is my miscalculation—I originally hoped using low-profile conduct could avoid such attacks."

Ma Jia felt the fat man in front was somewhat strange, because he rarely could hear the other party being so frank and clear.

"What do you prepare to do next? I saw when you went out just now everyone had the meaning of beating you up."

Zhao Manxiong laughed: "But they dared not, right. Because they don't know what consequences there will be if they beat me."

"Afraid of your Black Materials (kompromat)."

"Where do I get Black Materials," Zhao Manxiong raised both hands, shaking head helplessly, "Investigation after Trouble in Lingao incident, didn't the investigation team read our Bureau's archives? Conclusion was having nothing."

"They don't believe." Ma Jia said jokingly, "To be honest, I don't believe either."

"Look, the crux of the problem lies here. Everyone thinks we possess some Black Materials. Regardless of what the investigation result is, they don't believe."

"Fine, you talk about how to obtain Senators' trust?" Ma Jia said.

"Since they don't believe, no matter what we do they won't believe. Even if I open all archives it's useless. Because they will think I still have a secret archive storage." Zhao Manxiong smiled slightly, saying, "So since it is like this, might as well let them generate another kind of hallucination: Once Pol-Sec Bureau is finished, these fictitious Black Materials will flow out comprehensively..."

"Fine, you tell me first, exactly do you have these materials or not."

"Of course not, I am not a fool." Zhao Manxiong put hands on belly, "The Senate is a freak polity, cannot simply apply various polities in human history. Do so-called Black Materials Senators fear really have any meaning? In my view, this is truly a monstrously strange thing. Unless someone conspires to kill another Senator or prepares to betray the Senate to Great Ming or Later Jin or certain foreigners. Otherwise like XXing a female clerk; having X relationship with daughter of a certain naturalized citizen then promoting him; getting franchise license for Life Secretary's old dad? What do things like these count as to rulers?" He paused for a moment and said, "But Senators, as long as he has no problem with intelligence, can occupy a prominent position on the Empire's highest ranks list in the future—even Dugu who was characterized like that having no problem being a Governor-General. Except for Senators like Ma Qianzhu intending to dominate highest level positions, any Black Material has no meaning to Senators."

"You can say they 'don't have ruler's consciousness'—on this point I completely agree. Quite a few of our Senators have delusion of persecution. But I feel this is instead a good thing. At least they can still maintain the morality view of petty citizens in the past, maintaining the Senate's moral standard. Won't be too unscrupulous." Ma Jia said.

"Let's cast these aside not to talk. Since they dread so much. Now it seems we can only let them continue to dread." Zhao Manxiong said helplessly.

Ma Jia didn't ask him "what prepare to do". He didn't want to know such things. Before leaving he asked one sentence again: "Did you really not gather Senators' materials?"

"Really didn't." Zhao Manxiong said, "Guarantee to XXX."

Sending away Ma Jia, Zhao Manxiong pondered for a long time behind his own office desk. Don't look at him talking and laughing freely when facing Ma Jia, calm and composed; in heart he was very clear, the storm this time was much more serious than he estimated.

Up to now, Pol-Sec Bureau treated criticisms with an "Open" attitude, trying to offset everyone's suspicion and hostility by this. But now it seemed this method had little effect, just didn't let political enemies catch handles. And opponents held the determination of not finishing until Pol-Sec Bureau was rectified to death completely. Going on like this, sooner or later handles would be caught by them. Moreover this passive response mode he adopted had great influence on work and morale inside the Bureau.

In leaders of high level and administrative departments, views on Pol-Sec Bureau were still relatively positive. But the Senate was one person one vote; relying solely on support of high level was far from enough.

Through investigation he knew ordinary Senators actually knew very little about Pol-Sec, usually cared very little too. As long as containing the constant incitement of several main sprayers (trolls/critics), the momentum could be suppressed.

He pondered for a moment, dialed internal line telephone, summoning Reconnaissance Section Chief Zhou Botao, Technical Section Chief Wu Fo and Action Section Chief You Guotuan to the office.

These three Section Chiefs were core departments inside Pol-Sec Bureau. Crucially, like Wu Mu, they were "old comrades-in-arms" present when Pol-Sec Bureau was established, iron-clad hardcore elements.

"Alright, Comrades," Zhao Manxiong said, "I think everyone is very clear about the situation we face now." Saying that he introduced the hearing situation simply.

"This is f*cking messing around..." You Guotuan almost slapped the table to rise.

"Don't be excited, Section Chief You." Zhao Manxiong said, "The crisis before eyes, we muddled through relying on previous tricks of 'Inaction' plus 'Pot Dumping' (blame shifting). But next probably there will be bigger crisis. Wanting to reverse certain people's hostility toward us relying on low profile and openness now seems impossible. If we continue pretending to be grandsons (submissive)? Sooner or later will be deposed because of 'Uselessness'. Although high level's view on us is very positive, but may I ask what meaning is there to keep a department that cannot fully exert function?"

Everyone expressed agreement.

"All along, there are calls demanding merging police affairs with us. Director Ran there also had abacus (plans) long ago. General Affairs Section 9 and Section 10 we are all clear; that is the spy agency of police administration department. Our crisis is not small ah."

"Should we discuss with Ma Qianzhu?"

"Whether Ma Qianzhu, or Wen Desi, they won't express support for us explicitly." Zhao Manxiong said, "They first have to guarantee themselves 'not making mistakes'. As for other high level figures, except Ma Jia, we can only count on their goodwill, impossible to obtain their explicit support."

"Director Zhao, just say it, specifically prepare to do how?"
