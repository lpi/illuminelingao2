# Chapter 2118 - Self-Rescue

"Master Qiao speaks truly. Only there is now yet another perilous matter. Has your honor heard of it?"

"Please enlighten me!"

"I fear that should Wuzhou not hold, the officials and soldiers in their desperation may commit unspeakable acts!" Luo Yangming said, and then related what Wen Tietou had witnessed.

"Such a thing!" Guild-master Qiao's face went pale. He didn't question the claim; instead he rose and paced the hall several times, muttering to himself: "So that's what it is!"

Luo Yangming knew the guild-master must have also noticed the illogical actions. They simply hadn't had Wen Tietou's dockside contacts to observe closely enough to deduce that Xiong Wencan might burn the city.

"Unbelievable!" the guild-master murmured. "This is the lives of an entire city!"

"Given Governor Xiong's current situation, it's not so strange that he would do this."

The guild-master nodded to show he understood.

"In that case, trying to persuade Governor Xiong is impossible."

"Precisely." Luo Yangming nodded. "He's at the end of his rope. How would he listen to our entreaties?"

The guild-master nodded slightly. Though the two weren't well acquainted, they had already reached an unspoken understanding.

"There are some things it's not convenient for me to handle openly. But Master Luo can act more freely." Guild-master Qiao quietly instructed his personal servant a few sentences. The servant immediately left and returned shortly with a tray.

"This is my visiting card. Take it." The guild-master lowered his voice. "First go and pay a call on—"

The day after Bangshan fell, daytime Wuzhou had become a dead city. Every door was shut, every shop locked. On the streets, there were only scattered groups of roving soldiers and conscripted militia. As long as it wasn't urgent, no civilian dared go outside, for fear of being robbed or even killed by rampaging troops. Every street barricade was closed; wealthy households had not only barred their gates but also distributed weapons to their servants and guards.

The guest troops in the city were now frantic to the point of madness—the fall of the city was imminent. Sensing the end was near, whatever discipline remained had utterly collapsed. Not even the guest officers could fully control their men. Throughout the streets, soldiers robbed and murdered civilians; clashes with the local garrison were frequent. Had it not been for Xiong Wencan's household guards constantly patrolling and occasionally suppressing the riots, the city would have disintegrated into total chaos.

Amid this tension came bad news: Xiong Wencan had still not appeared by noon, sending only his personal servant to say he was "indisposed." This immediately sparked panic—after all, the only senior official in Wuzhou was Xiong Wencan himself. If he truly "fell ill," the only authorities left were the Prefect and the Magistrate. For them to command the arrogant guest officers was a fool's dream.

While everyone was still in turmoil, a trusted staff officer named Chang Qingyun emerged and sent people around distributing invitations, announcing that the Governor-General would host a banquet that evening for the city's merchants and gentry to "discuss the defense of the city."

If Chang Qingyun was here, then Yi Haoran—who commanded Xiong Wencan's household guards—must also be in the city, leading patrols to suppress the rioters. Both were the Governor-General's current "favorites." And since his other staff officers were still around, the rumor that Xiong Wencan had fled seemed to be baseless.

Yet the collapse of that rumor only brought new anxiety to the invited merchants—it felt like the weasel inviting the chickens to dinner.

Still, facing the glowering colonels and soldiers who came to "invite" them, they could hardly refuse. Even feigning illness would only get them "carried there."

Luo Yangming, though not one of the major magnates, was a board member of the Rice Guild and thus within the invitation's scope. His wife and concubines were distraught, fearing they would be bled dry. But Luo Yangming's expression was far more serious.

Xiong Wencan's banquet was obviously a trap. But even more alarming was his scorched-earth plan.

Once fires were lit, it was no longer a matter of losing money—it was the lives of his entire family!

His recent activities had all been aimed at obstructing the arson plan. Through his efforts at liaison and persuasion, the local constables and a portion of the garrison had now pledged that once the Australians attacked, they would immediately open the gates to welcome them. If anyone tried to set fires, they would do their utmost to stop it.

But whether these people's words could be trusted—whether they could actually hold off the wolf-like rioters—or whether they themselves might simply join the mob—was another matter entirely.

The area where he lived was a district of prosperous merchants' shops. If the city descended into chaos, it would be first in the line of fire. The street barricades and the guards alone might not be enough to keep the neighborhood safe.

He called Wen Tietou over and quietly gave him instructions.

"I'm leaving home in your hands."

"Rest assured! I'll keep everyone safe." Wen Tietou thumped his chest. "Too bad my dock brothers aren't inside the city!"

"Our possessions don't matter—only people's safety!" Luo Yangming urged repeatedly, and only then did he set out with a few servants.

It was too early to attend the banquet, and in any case, he hadn't decided whether to go at all. Luo Yangming still couldn't fathom Xiong Wencan's thinking—if he meant to burn the city, he had no intention of defending it, so why bother holding a banquet to ask everyone to "assist in the defense"?

After much thought, the so-called banquet could only be a delaying tactic!

He recalled that since dawn Xiong Wencan hadn't shown himself—first they said he'd slept late, then by noon he was "indisposed." And then suddenly everyone was invited to a banquet...

Luo Yangming suddenly realized: Xiong Wencan had very likely slipped out of the city the previous night. Today's series of ruses were only meant to buy time—to make the officials, gentry, and populace believe he was still in the city "directing grand strategy."

At the banquet that evening, if he didn't appear, the charade would collapse...

Luo Yangming broke into a cold sweat: could it be that the fires would be lit when the banquet began?!

Thinking further: those invited to the banquet were the city's "notables"—not high officials, but people with some clout and influence. The militiamen mustered for the defense included many who owed their loyalty to these men.

If these notables wanted to surrender—if they wanted to resist Xiong Wencan's remaining guest troops and their arson—they would have a real chance.

So this was Xiong Wencan's trap! Luo Yangming thought. Most likely, once they entered, the doors would be locked, and then the fires would start—burning them all to death, or at least shocking them senseless so they couldn't organize any resistance against the rioters.

Luo Yangming felt a chill all over. He had to act immediately!

With that thought, he told his servants: "Hurry! Take me to Master Qiao's residence!"

Master Qiao was not only the head of the Rice Guild but also the chief headman of Wuzhou's South City. Though he held no official rank, in Wuzhou he could summon wind and rain, commanding both the underworld and the legitimate world. He could influence not only the local constables but also the movements of the militia in the South City.

If he could be persuaded to change sides now, the Dezheng and Nanxun gates in the South City would surely be within reach!

With that thought, he quickened his pace.

Yi Haoran had arrived at the Governor-General's yamen early that morning. Hearing that Xiong Wencan couldn't yet receive guests, he had returned to his own quarters. Unlike the other staff officers, he had no thought of fleeing with the Governor-General. Life and death were no longer his greatest concerns. With a great enemy at the gates, he had no heart to sit in the yamen's flower hall making small talk with the other advisors.

But he hadn't been idle. He had returned to his quarters, spread out paper and ink, and begun writing.

What he wrote was less a letter than a summary of the battles from Zhaoqing onward. Though he hadn't personally experienced most of them, he had carefully collected accounts from the officers and soldiers involved—especially yesterday's Battle of Bangshan, about which he had questioned Jiang Suo in detail, particularly concerning the Australians' assault procedures.

After writing several pages, he had his attendant copy them out in multiple copies. He intended to send these letters with the courier carrying Xiong Wencan's memorials to Beijing, addressed to several friends and mentors—most of them serving as staff in various government offices. The more people who knew the Hair-Bandits' true capabilities, the better.

Jiang Suo stood nearby, distracted. After the previous day's battle, he was utterly exhausted and hadn't woken until past noon. The moment he rose, he had run to Yi Haoran to request assignment to the Dayun Gate defenses outside the walls. Yi Haoran refused. "You nearly lost your life on Bangshan. Now you want to throw it away at Dayun Gate?"

"This humble one wishes only to serve the realm faithfully!"

"Don't lie to me. You're just looking to die! You won't say it, but I can guess—you must have a blood feud with the Hair-Bandits. National hatred and family grudges are one thing, but seeking death is unwise! You're still young; you think feelings are more important than anything. Once you've truly experienced catastrophe, you'll understand that being alive is better than anything!"

He sighed. Seeing Jiang Suo about to argue, he waved a hand.

"Say no more. A moment ago, take the remaining new army troops out to patrol the streets and maintain discipline—things out there are already a mess. Go and rest for now."

With that, Yi Haoran sent Jiang Suo away. That Xiong Wencan was "indisposed" came as no surprise—the Governor-General's situation was desperate. Even if his servant came to report that Xiong Wencan had hanged himself, Yi Haoran wouldn't have been shocked.

But what was to be done about Wuzhou? Yi Haoran thought of County Magistrate Chang Pu's scorched-earth plan. It might indeed be a desperate survival strategy, but it was too vicious—an absolute last resort.

As the sun began to set and he was about to go out and inspect the city gates, a servant burst through the door, whispered a few words, and Yi Haoran's face went pale. He leaped up and rushed out the door.
