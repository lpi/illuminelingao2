# Chapter 2118 - Chang Qingyun

Only higher-level or specialized units were equipped with radios. Besides runners and traditional bugle signals, units communicated using light signals at night and semaphore by day. Later, the Science and Technology Department developed a mirror-based reflector device using historical references, which by day used reflected light to transmit Morse code—roughly two or three signal groups per minute. Much faster than semaphore, but the obvious disadvantage was a greatly reduced transmission range in poor weather.

Whether semaphore or light signals, neither was particularly convenient for transmitting information in combat. Especially in field operations—unless fighting from prepared positions—it was hard to set up a communication network at leisure. In most situations, they still relied on traditional bugles and runners.

However, siege warfare was a slow, methodical operation, with units spread far apart—precisely the ideal scenario for visual signaling networks.

The 1st Brigade's Signal Battalion visual signal teams were divided into six squads, deployed at Bangshan's northern slope, the summit of Zhushan, south of Wuzhou city, southeast of Wuzhou, atop Beishan, and north of Wuzhou. Each squad consisted of a signalman, observer, decoder, runner, and reserve. For a better view and unobstructed signals, each squad was equipped with a tall platform similar to a lifeguard chair at a swimming pool—made of steel tubes and connectors, which could be disassembled for transport and reassembled on site. The platform was secured with guy ropes and long spikes driven into the ground; only two people could fit on top, with the signalman and observer secured by safety harnesses. When they needed to send or receive signals, they would stand up and move into position. Observers were equipped with high-powered binoculars; upon spotting a "ready to transmit" signal from any direction, the signalman would respond with the appropriate motion or light signal, then begin receiving. The standard flag signals consisted of thirty motions, representing either 26 letters or 10 numbers; A through I also represented 1 through 9; K represented 0; the remaining four motions indicated "standby/space," "following signals are numbers," "error," and "cancel"; J also meant "following signals are letters." Light signals used Morse code directly.

During daylight when observation was good, semaphore was simpler than Morse-based light signals and faster for transmitting simple messages. But now it was night, so only light signals were in use. The observer watched the transmitting station through binoculars, calling out the corresponding letters, numbers, or meanings aloud; the decoder recorded them and quickly interpreted the message, then had the runner deliver the decoded message to the intended recipient. Conversely, the decoder would encode a message into the appropriate code, read it aloud to the signalman, who would transmit it. If the message needed to be relayed to the next station, the decoder would issue the relay command upon completing the decode, and the signalman would transmit to the next station after receiving their "ready" signal.

Each squad's positions weren't fixed; they maintained a rotation of four on duty and one resting, ensuring timely transmission and reception of information.

When the sentry atop Bangshan observed the unusual activity at Wuzhou's Xijiang Gate through binoculars, he watched while simultaneously reporting to the senior officer on Bangshan—the artillery company commander. The commander didn't dare delay; after observing carefully through his own binoculars, he had the signal squad transmit the message.

The message read: "Station 1: Over ten thousand refugees pouring out of Xijiang Gate."

Station 1 referred to the signal squad south of Wuzhou city. The squad atop Zhushan received the message and immediately relayed it down. Station 3—the Bangshan signal squad—then received the following reply: "Station 3: Intensify observation. Continue to report."

Then the reply: "Station 1: Ming soldiers shooting arrows at refugees."

Followed by: "Station 1: Refugees heading north."

And then: "Station 1: Refugees approaching northern perimeter."

Zhu Mingxia couldn't yet figure out what the Wuzhou garrison was up to, but with such a huge crowd of refugees suddenly pouring out, there was no telling if Ming soldiers were hidden among them. Carelessness here could mean disaster. He made a snap decision, ordering the squad to transmit to Zhu Quanxing: "Station 4: Intercept outgoing refugees."

From a tactical standpoint, intercepting refugees wasn't a good idea. There were many of them, and Ming soldiers might be mixed in; thin lines could easily be overwhelmed. A more cautious approach would be to open a gap and let them disperse on their own.

But Zhu Mingxia considered that if Ming soldiers were among the crowd and slipped through, that would be one thing—but if they then circled back for a surprise attack on the rear supply points, that would be disastrous.

Upon receiving the order, Zhu Quanxing used light signals to command the position northeast of the city, at Beishan, to coordinate with the two companies dispatched from the northern perimeter to form an encirclement before the refugees attempted to penetrate the lines—keeping them from scattering en masse.

Though Yi Haoran privately grumbled that Chang Qingyun had run faster than a rabbit, Chang Qingyun hadn't been as composed as his "I have a plan" demeanor suggested. Before order in the city completely collapsed, he had already slipped away.

Chang Qingyun hadn't been "left behind" in the city—he had actually volunteered to be the one to give the order to set the fires. At the time, he had felt rather heroic about it, something of a "the wind blows cold over the Yi River" sentiment. Even when Yi Haoran had burst in to confront him, he had maintained a certain "calm and composed" air.

However, as order within the city began to unravel and the messengers he sent out failed to return, Chang Qingyun's courage began to drain away bit by bit. When he realized the situation had completely spiraled out of control, he couldn't help but grow panicked. The determination to "die a martyr's death" that he had felt earlier was no longer so firm. He stopped worrying about fires and called for his servants to bring a change of clothes.

He had secretly prepared several sets of commoner's clothing in the yamen. Now he and three personal servants all changed into brown jackets and small caps, disguised as ordinary townsfolk. They rushed out the main gate and blended into the crowd of civilians being expelled.

The streets were already in chaos—heads everywhere, the cries and wails of the crowd filling the air. Chang Qingyun looked up and saw flames rising in the northern part of the city; he guessed the fires had already begun.

The crowd froze for a moment, everyone raising their heads to stare at the red glow on the horizon. Then suddenly a man's voice, high and breaking with terror, shrieked from somewhere in the crowd: "This is bad—fire!" Everyone jumped as if whipped, surging toward the Dayun Gate. The fleeing crowd rolled down the streets and alleys; people kept joining the stream, and those who hesitated even a few seconds were knocked down and swallowed by the human tide.

In the torrent of fleeing people, there were both civilians and soldiers. Some wealthy households had servants shielding them as they clutched boxes and ran; some had been eating dinner and still held a broken bowl as they ran; disheveled scholars, women whose skirts had been trampled off—all ran among the crowd. Soldiers at first tried to beat a path with their scabbards, then simply drew their blades and cut down anyone in their way.

Chang Qingyun was panicked: the fires had been set too early!

But now there was no time to think about that. Master and servants were swept along by the crowd, crashing through a porridge stall set up by some charitable soul. The cooking stove was knocked over, and the embers rolled under the eaves, where several clay jars were stored. A spark touched one, and with a "whoosh" flames leaped up. The fire quickly licked at the straw on the roof, and in an instant the whole building was ablaze.

"The city's burning! Run!" The already panicked crowd went berserk. Those near the fire shoved desperately toward the opposite side of the street; those on the other side pushed back just as hard, and a great swath of people went down. Before they could get up, more people had already trampled over them. Those in front felt the ground go soft for a moment; those behind no longer even noticed.

The fire spread from one building to the next, from one block to another. Chang Qingyun felt disaster closing in; he swung his elbows left and right, struggling to break free of the crowd. But it was useless—a harder elbow smashed into the side of his head, and he heard only a "boom" before his mind went blank.

Chang Qingyun stumbled to the left, but was pushed back by those on that side. He had no control over his direction, couldn't stop his feet, could only be carried forward by the crowd. In a daze, he seemed to see the north gate ahead; then, still dazed, it seemed he was already outside the city.

It was his servant Changshan who had his wits about him. Seeing a stone stele by the roadside, he pulled Chang Qingyun behind it—just barely avoiding the crowd. By the time Chang Qingyun came to his senses, he found himself sitting in mud by the road; the surging crowd had somewhat dispersed outside the city.

Of the three servants he had brought, only Changshan remained.

Having been through the great rout at Chengmai, Chang Qingyun quickly composed himself. He looked back at Wuzhou city; the fire wasn't large, and the choking smoke had already dispersed on the wind. He felt a twinge of disappointment. He recalled that the last intelligence he had received before leaving the city indicated that the garrison and militia throughout the city were already resisting the officials—apparently, everything had once again been ruined by "collaborators"!

At this moment, his whole body ached. Looking down at himself, he was a mess—his trousers torn at the knee, hands scraped raw. He must have fallen countless times while fleeing the city. Looking at Changshan, he too was in sorry shape—no doubt his struggles all along the way had kept Chang Qingyun from falling and never getting up again.

"Changshan, I owe you my life this time!"

"Master, don't say that," Changshan said, somewhat embarrassed. "It's just that Changwei and the others are gone—the food and the silver were all with them."
