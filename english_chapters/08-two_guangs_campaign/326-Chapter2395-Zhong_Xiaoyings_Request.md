# Chapter 2395: Zhong Xiaoying's Request

"There's another trick here," Doctor Zhong had said, getting into the explanation. "The chili powder produced in Lingao usually contains a certain amount of salt. If you want the cold noodle soup to be saltier, add more sugar instead of salt. Hanshi side dishes work the same way: add more sugar instead of more salt. Side dishes can also have crushed sesame, crushed peanuts, and other nut powders added to enhance the fragrance."

Chu He took another sip of soup. Indeed, the broth had a distinct sweetness. Compared to what he'd eaten on Jeju, the flavor seemed heavier. He wondered if this taste could be accepted by Cantonese palates...

Looking at the dining department's business, the occupancy rate was about one-third—quite good for this time of day. But he noticed most customers were naturalized citizens. This type of cuisine apparently hadn't been accepted by locals yet.

Just as he was musing on the topic of "how to guide consumption," a female server suddenly appeared at his side and quietly asked, "Excuse me, are you Chief Chu He?"

Chu He was startled. Park Jihyun immediately put down his chopsticks and looked at her alertly.

"I am."

"There's a guest who would like to see you. Would you be willing to meet them?"

Chu He thought: *This is my first time in Guangzhou! Besides, I'm unfamiliar with most Senators here. Could it be that my reputation has already spread, and some local native big shot is rushing to flatter me, wanting to attach themselves to the Nanyang Company?*

This wasn't impossible. After all, in a place like Zhongyi Trading Company, Senators would definitely frequent it. Waiting by a tree stump would eventually catch a rabbit.

"Yes." Chu He didn't hesitate. Regardless of the other party's motives, as the future leader of the Guangzhou Exchange, broadly cultivating contacts with local big shots would be very useful for future work.

"Please follow me to the private room. The guest is waiting."

Park Jihyun didn't even have time to wipe his mouth before blocking the way. "Chief, this isn't safe. Have them come here to see you!"

Chu He smiled. "You're overthinking. This is the Great World, Doctor Zhong's property. What is there to fear?" He stood up. "Lead the way."

"Comrade, you needn't worry," the female server smiled. "The private room is just upstairs."

Chu He followed her to a private room on the third floor. Upon entering, he saw a long-haired young woman wearing a woolen pinafore dress with a thin wool short jacket. Seeing him enter, she immediately rose to greet him, bowing deeply. "Uncle Chu."

Chu He was startled again. Looking at the young woman's clothing and makeup, he'd originally thought she must be some Senator's life secretary. But calling him "Uncle" wasn't how life secretaries or even naturalized citizens addressed people. Only little Senators or second-generation Senators would call him that.

He'd met all the little Senators in the Senate. As for second-generation Senators, the oldest hadn't even started elementary school yet—they couldn't possibly be this eighteen or nineteen-year-old young woman.

He couldn't help showing a wary expression. "You are...?"

"Uncle doesn't recognize me? I'm Zhong Xiaoying."

"Oh... so it's you." Chu He suddenly understood, thinking how he could have forgotten her! Come to think of it, when Doctor Zhong came to Jeju to survey Seongsan and build the astronomical observatory, she had come along.

"So it's Xiaoying." Chu He's face immediately relaxed. "I really..."

As Doctor Zhong's adopted daughter, Zhong Xiaoying enjoyed considerable fame in little Senator circles. Although she didn't study at the Academy, she was familiar with most little Senators and visited frequently. She held the highest status and greatest fame among the Senators' adopted children.

"Uncle Chu is busy with work and it's been a long time. It's normal not to remember me." Zhong Xiaoying smiled. "Please, sit down."

Compared to the innocent sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl in his memory, the Zhong Xiaoying before him was much more mature, completely adult in appearance.

Chu He immediately grew suspicious: Doctor Zhong rarely concerned himself with mainland strategy. Why had he suddenly sent his adopted daughter to Guangzhou? Her presence at this time must have a reason—could it also be about the Nanyang Company? Perhaps she wanted Zhongyi Trading Company to get involved? But there was no need to specifically seek him out. Buying shares was an aboveboard matter...

"This time Father sent me to Guangzhou for preliminary investigation about establishing schools locally," Zhong Xiaoying said, seeming to guess what he was thinking. "Also to look after Science Department's industries. I invited Uncle Chu here because I personally have something I'd like to ask your help with... To be honest, I only thought of this after seeing Uncle Chu today."

"It's nothing at all. Doctor Zhong and I are old acquaintances from Jeju. Whatever you need help with, just ask."

"I just arrived in Guangzhou a few days ago. Recently I heard Uncle Chu is leading the Nanyang Company project..."

"Ahem, I need to clarify. The Nanyang Company is Zhou Wei's project. I'm not with the Nanyang Company. I'm only responsible for fundraising—the securities side of things." Chu He quickly clarified.

"I think, since you're leading the Nanyang Company's fundraising, you must be quite familiar with Uncle Zhou."

"Yes, quite familiar." Chu He understood immediately—this young lady wanted something from him.

*I'm indeed "quite familiar" with Zhou Wei, but this familiarity belongs to the not-so-pleasant kind.* He naturally understood that although Zhou Wei and the "Seven Senators" now appeared harmonious and intimate, who knew what grudges might be harbored in his heart.

But he didn't want to lose face in front of the young woman. He immediately put on a dignified air. "Is there something you want me to convey to Zhou Wei?"

"Yes," Zhong Xiaoying lowered her head. "Uncle Chu may not know, but I and some girls from the Academy have a sailing club..."

"I remember, I remember." Chu He immediately recalled the sensational "Storming Lingao" incident from back then. Qian Duoduo and several girls had made quite a splash. "You still have a ship, called Xiaocang, right?"

Zhong Xiaoying raised her head with pleasant surprise. "Uncle Chu, you know?"

"Of course I know." Chu He greatly enjoyed this kind of admiring gaze from girls. "And Qian Duoduo, Zhang Yunmi..."

"I didn't expect Uncle Chu to know our club so well." Zhong Xiaoying's initial sense of distance immediately disappeared. "Since that's the case, I won't beat around the bush. Our club has a foreign girl..."

This "foreign girl" was Sonia Lily Sharper. After the auction, she had become Lin Hanlong's life secretary. A year ago, when Lingao established its museum, Sonia officially started working there and also participated part-time in several exploration team surveys of various islands along the mainland coast, all of Hainan Island, and southern Taiwan.

"...Sonia heard that Southeast Asia is going to be officially developed. She's very interested and wants to participate. But..." Zhong Xiaoying's face showed a difficult expression. "She doesn't know how to bring it up with Uncle Lin."

"Lin Hanlong won't let her go?"

"Not exactly. It's just that she feels Uncle Lin has already been very magnanimous, allowing her to work outside, even letting her join overseas surveys, visiting many coastal islands and Taiwan Island. If she now proposes going to Southeast Asia—gone for at least half a year—she doesn't dare bring it up again. After all, she's still a slave..."

Chu He nodded. "I understand. You want Zhou Wei to approach Lin Hanlong about this?"

Zhong Xiaoying clapped her hands and laughed. "Uncle Chu, you're so sharp! If Uncle Zhou says the survey needs her, Uncle Lin probably wouldn't object."

*Not so certain, little one!* Chu He thought. This Zhong Xiaoying was still too naive. Were surveys of Hainan Island, southern Taiwan, and coastal islands the same as surveying Southeast Asia? Not to mention the great risks of surveying Southeast Asia—Sonia's sailing skills were quite formidable. What if she seized the opportunity to escape during the survey? Could Zhou Wei bear that responsibility?

If it were an ordinary life secretary, running was running. The problem was this girl was not only knowledgeable herself but also clever and eager to learn. Working at the museum for several years, she had acquired considerable new knowledge. She was already a very important assistant to Lin Hanlong.

If she really escaped or had some other accident during the survey, it would offend Lin Hanlong terribly.

He thought for a moment and said, "This isn't difficult. I'll talk to Zhou Wei about it."

"That's wonderful. I'll thank you on Lily's behalf." Zhong Xiaoying, having no idea of the complications involved, happily clapped her hands. "Uncle Chu, you're so kind!"

"It's nothing, don't be so polite." Chu He felt guilty inside and gave a few dry laughs. "I have other matters to attend to, so I won't chat longer..."

Zhong Xiaoying stopped him and handed over a small ceramic jar with a rattan shell. "This is a nourishing paste I made myself. Inside is top-quality Korean ginseng and Liaodong deer antler—excellent for replenishing vitality. I heard Father say you've been overworking. I thought this might help nourish your body. Please don't refuse it."

"Ah, this is really too kind..." Chu He felt his face burning. "You father and daughter are both too generous. I'm unworthy, truly unworthy." He quickly took the jar and left.

Downstairs, Park Jihyun was craning his neck to look. Seeing him come down, he immediately came forward:

"Chief, are you alright..."

"Nonsense, what could happen to me?" Chu He scolded him, casually handing the jar over. "Hold this!"

"I mean, is there anything important?" Park Jihyun took the jar and asked again.

"No, nothing."

"Then why is Chief's face red?"

"It's from the... Just ate cold noodles, the heat from that!" Chu He feared this fellow would say something even more exasperating. "Let's go, we're going to the walnut pastry shop!"

The two left Zhongyi Trading Company and walked along the road for a stretch. The air suddenly filled with a rich baking aroma.

"Chief, that shop up ahead is it." Park Jihyun pointed.

Looking carefully, Chu He saw three or four storefronts up ahead with a wooden shop sign hanging outside, carved with two large characters: "Zhang's." Below were two slightly smaller characters: "Pastry Shop." Next to it was another line: "Main shop in Nanhai County..." The rest Chu He couldn't read clearly, but presumably it gave the main shop's address, thereby indicating their "authenticity."
