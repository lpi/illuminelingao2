# Chapter 2345 - Freshly Baked Nanyang Company (V)

An obvious thing was the shipyard couldn't possibly arrange a slipway for a ship that would roughly need a year to get power unit, even those 901 gunboats claiming "Ninety Days" impossible. So must have definite quota plan, shipyard only then could arrange construction schedule—this was still when shipyard shipbuilding capacity had vacancy. In fact most times Senate shipyards were very busy.

Wanting shipyard to start work as soon as possible, arranging ship schedule, sufficient advance payment was very important. Of course, Planning Academy instruction was better, but Zhou Wei now obviously couldn't get Planning Academy "Priority Ranking" document. Could only rely on real gold silver to smash.

*When can this Guangzhou Rat Plague end...* He slandered secretly. Why Senate otherworld ruling road so difficult! Just took down Guangzhou then plague broke out.

Wang Kai obviously didn't experience his complex mood, instead still introducing his own ships endlessly.

"...Because Nanyang Company mainly uses for Philippine route. This region typhoon frequent. Lao Luo and I were a bit worried when designing. So considered adopting some measures to improve this matter: First increased freeboard, reducing water intake at small wind waves. Second adopted large angle inverted V cargo hold bottom, guiding water to side cabins, using water pump to drain. Third installed a huge canvas covering open cargo hold, forming an inverted V soft top, can drastically reduce water intake at relatively large wind waves. To support this soft top, set a longitudinal beam in ship center, higher than freeboard, setting pulleys on longitudinal beam and gunwale, for fast retracting soft top. Gunwale outside has angle iron protruding ship body, for fixing canvas cover. Fourth added stiffeners for gunwale..."

Zhou Wei said "En" absent-mindedly. Ever since Guangzhou plague broke out, Hong Kong Island also fell into semi-blockade state. Various personnel flow received fairly strict control. Shipyard originally busy enough, material and manpower supply insufficient making production speed more unable to keep up. Own side wanting to build new ship estimated to queue to Monkey Year Horse Month. Wang Kai's "Ship Plan" in his view close to Arabian Nights.

However own team just opened, had to be polite to new coming brother. So he listened on properly with patience.

"Of course, best way to cope with storm is still evasion. Besides avoiding typhoon season, we should set up more observation stations on South China Sea islands, using radio to exchange data and warning. Of course, this isn't matter able to do immediately. Can be included into Senate long-term meteorological observation master plan to implement. Relatively realistic consideration is conducting specialized training for lookouts serving on mast, equipping better optical equipment and simple meteorological instruments. Thus, can discover weather threat earlier to a certain extent. With such series of measures, surprise class on Philippine route should be able to maintain sailing steadily for 6 months above every year."

Zhou Wei wanted to remind him Manila was still in Spanish hands. And inside Senate attitude toward whether taking down Manila was very ambiguous. Reason well, nothing more than reluctant to part with Spanish silver flowing out from Manila. Of course, Philippines itself very big, places Manila Spanish could manage not many either. Occupying a few resource locations doing development no problem...

"...Of course, such merchant ship still has to face pirate threat. Places on this type ship able to install weapon not many. Installing naval gun occupies space relatively. So my thought is installing one Hotchkiss manual Gatling gun on each side of lower layer of forecastle and front of poop. Such firepower configuration is very suitable for shooting enemies already boarding ship. Just very easy to sink oneself too." Wang Kai pointing on drawing. Zhou Wei nodding cooperatively.

"Of course, reliable security plan is still escort. Adopting convoy mode. A convoy composed of at least three 'Surprise' class, then Navy sends one 901 gunboat to escort. After all, 'Surprise' and 901 speed both 10 knots. Coordinating has no difficulty. And 901 is ship type tested by long distance sailing. Just four ships all use steam engine, so need to equip collier accompanying fleet for supply."

Zhou Wei continued maintaining posture of "Listening attentively", nodding from time to time proving himself listening. Wang Kai talked more excited, pulled open another drawing.

"This is second ship I designed, 'Orient Express'! Its prototype is American clipper *Sea Witch*. *Sea Witch* counts as relatively early clipper, construction craft simpler than younger generations. Simultaneously, length width ratio not as exaggerated as latecomers. Wider body makes it have more mission selectivity than same tonnage clipper. And its most main characteristic is small ship carrying big sail, so although body looks fatter, speed not inferior. Can easily run out 17 knots high speed. Key is, this ship cost low. If really all built into 'Short Shirt' (Cutty Sark) class ship, Planning Academy and Finance Tax Bureau will hold knife to approve. I calculated myself, *Orient Express* single ship construction cost roughly slightly less than 2 H-800. And its transport capacity equivalent to 5 H-800. Presumably they can calculate this account clearly."

This ship with first class cost performance in Wang Kai's mouth, in dimension and total registered tonnage basically consistent with *Sea Witch*: 51.8 meters long (hull), 10.3 meters wide, hold depth 6.5 meters, registered total tonnage: 908. Because wood and metal used different materials, other data had to rely on actual measurement. Finally measured self weight 837 tons, maximum load barely reached 1000 tons. Wang Kai proposed this ship number could be H1024 class. Capable of running and fighting. 2-3 grade wind could soar to 17 knots full speed. Can transport, can also armed patrol. Its rapid reaction capability can make Nanyang pioneering activity without worry behind.

"...At the same time, she possessing spacious cabins, is also very suitable as Senator Traffic Ship, is intimate partner in your dream journey!" Wang Kai made final lyrical summary speech with emotion.

Zhou Wei waited for him to finish introduction with difficulty, hurriedly nodded saying: "Your plan not bad! I see you hurry write into report, we go to Planning Academy to report for approval..."

"Cannot Nanyang Company build ships ourselves? We self raise funds..." Wang Kai stunned.

"Self raising funds isn't fake, but we have no shipyard." Zhou Wei smiled bitterly, "And shipbuilding material and machine all have to wait for quota. Getting money is only first step—moreover we have no money now."

"Damn, I thought arriving Nanyang Company could display hand and feet greatly, didn't expect still so troublesome!" Wang Kai said disappointedly, "Then what do we have now?"

"We actually control roughly forty plus ships, all originally Southeast Asia Company's. These ships' condition I currently not clear yet. But should be if not on route then in dock maintenance. But Wang You said these ships all usable, no lease contract. As long as returning can call anytime."

"Who is Wang You?"

"Southeast Asia Company General Manager."

"Right, how to handle relationship between Southeast Asia Company and Nanyang Company?"

"This involves equity problem." Zhou Wei pressed out almost finished cigar, "According to Planning Academy guidance opinion, Southeast Asia Company is our Nanyang Company subsidiary. I feel this is quite good—Southeast Asia Company brand cannot throw. Keeping to appease hearts of Wang You these old Southeast Asia Company middle high level naturalized cadres. They worked for Senate for several years too, managed to get title of General Manager, Deputy General Manager with difficulty. Suddenly asking them to be Section Chief, Unit Chief inappropriate."

"Actually their rank at most is Section Unit level."

"Administrative rank indeed not high, but name sounds good." Zhou Wei said, "Otherwise why everyone strives to go to County Level City? Since we are mixed ownership enterprise, in name can loose some. Naturalized citizens also have a goal."

"As for specific equity structure, although Planning Academy issued guidance opinion now, but how to do still needs us to design ourselves. With this only can talk about raising funds—of course, now we can't go to raise funds either."

"This Rat Plague really not right time!"

"When is right time for plague." Zhou Wei felt now counted as entering main topic, "Anyway in recent one two months Guangzhou fund is hopeless. Shipbuilding probably no hope either. However according to guidance document, we can raise private shares from Senators first. With this money can do many things in Lingao too."

"Wait, your equity structure not done yet, how to raise private shares?" Wang Kai asked, "One share how much money, how to divide dividend no specific saying, which Senator willing to pay?"

"This matter I thought—I am from finance background anyway..."

"I also did investment."

"That couldn't be better." Zhou Wei said, "Convene a few interested finance aspect Senators. Discuss first."

Sent away Wang Kai. Zhou Wei recorded things to do one by one in notebook. Writing casually, actually wrote twenty plus items. Inside many material collection and analysis content—these works he couldn't count on Wang You such naturalized cadres. Urgent thing right now was building the team first.

First need to find Nanyang Company Board Secretary or Office Director alike. Roughly a Chief Steward role. Such person not easy to find. Must have strong work ability, also must coordinate well with chief official work. Must be presentable in all aspects.

He wrote a few names on notebook, crossed out one by one. These people although were Southbound Faction comrades, either talent insufficient, or heart nature very high, not willing to be under people. Not suitable candidates.

Thinking over and over, he thought of a person. That was Xu Yanliang. This person worked in Military Group in early years, was Marine, later retired due to injury transferring to administration department work. Under Yang Yun responsible for industrial sector personnel work. Zhou Wei met him when inciting industrial sector Senators to support Nanyang Company plan.
