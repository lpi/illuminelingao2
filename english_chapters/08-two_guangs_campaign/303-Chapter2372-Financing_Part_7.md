# Chapter 2372: Financing (Part 7)

Hearing this, everyone was stunned at first. Then those who had been soaking in the office for a long time like Director Wang, Director Zhang, and Mu Min immediately reacted. Although some of them might not understand why Liu Xiang was preparing to swing the hammer, this matter wouldn't cause them any loss!

Director Zhang smiled and chimed in: "Hey! What do we have to be afraid of? If nothing's found, all the better. If something is found, we'll just treat it as building up work style! I also just want to know if those little brats are playing two-faced!"

Director Zhang took the lead, and even though the others didn't understand why, they all followed and agreed.

"Then let's do this. We won't bother with Senators who aren't here. Just the few of us here and our departments, let's first discuss the order of the snap inspections."

"Little Zhang, pack up too and come with us—after all, you're also the principal of the Cadre School. This inspection work is also part of your job." Liu Xiang called out.

"Okay, I'll come right over." Zhang Yunmi agreed readily, closing the notebook—this was internal meeting records, which as a rule couldn't be taken out, so she put it back in the meeting room's filing cabinet and took out a new notebook in hand.

The group left the conference room one after another, with Zhang Yunmi being the last to leave. In the corridor, she saw an orderly quickly walking with a tray of snacks and black tea—this was probably to be sent to that "Senator Chu He." She stopped the orderly:

"Who is this for?"

"It's for the small conference room over there. There's a Senator looking at materials, saying he wants to draft some kind of plan." The orderly said quietly, "Mayor Liu said to take good care of him and not slight him—he's in a bad mood."

"Go ahead."

Watching the orderly carry the refreshments over, Zhang Yunmi thought, this Senator named Chu He was probably sitting under the lamp right now, "researching" a pile of materials, thinking about what kind of "plan" he could come up with.

In his heart, he probably still hoped that this plan could win Liu Xiang's favor and become his "stepping stone"—after all, he couldn't get close to the hot-cake General Manager Zhou of the Nanyang Company anymore.

Was the contrast between the two rooms stark?

On one side, Senator Chu He, angered by a naturalized citizen into coming to reason, was sent off to do unpaid labor before his anger had even subsided. On this side, several powerful Senators, with feathered fans and silk turbans, leisurely reclining in chairs, in their casual chatting and laughing, used Senator Chu as a pawn.

Power, what a terrifying thing.

A sense of sorrow welled up from the bottom of her heart—this was still a Senator!

On the other side, Chu He was flipping through materials while sorting out his thoughts.

Zhou Wei taking the fall was probably inevitable—as long as he was willing to make it big, and Zhou Wei wasn't a blockhead. As for whether some passerby would pop up playing saint and question "why must Senator A's secretary respect Senator B," Chu He felt that such brain-damaged people shouldn't be in the Senate.

But, he Chu He didn't come here to vent! He didn't come to step on the current hot shot and slap his own face in self-celebration!

The route he designed, the so-called "raise 300,000 in thirty days," was to show off himself, to get himself a real position and status!

I TM didn't come here to be a Shan Liang!

Now thinking about it carefully, having made such a fuss, even if Zhou Wei "laughed it off and forgot past grudges" with him, what if it was all smiles on the surface but cold feelings underneath...

While thinking, he absent-mindedly flipped through the economic data materials handed over by Liu Xiang's orderly, but the gradual awakening of professional habits made him occasionally pay attention to the key data on each page. Unexpectedly, the more he looked at this data, the more interesting it became. Gradually, his thoughts turned to the materials.

After roughly flipping through once, Chu He suddenly stood up and paced back and forth. He tore open the letter he wrote to Zhou Wei, read it again, and then looked at the economic data materials again and again...

After quite a while, Chu He suddenly punched his right fist into his left palm: "Holy cow! This desperate doctor-shopping actually found the right one!"

After Chu He shouted this from his heart, he also realized his voice was too loud—no, he shouldn't be making a fuss. He slowly walked to the window at the vent, and exclaimed excitedly in his heart:

"I didn't notice! They still have this contradiction here! I really came to the right place! Moreover, the idea I wrote to Zhou Wei actually started too small; the aftermath is huge! Sooner or later, it will have to go to Liu Xiang anyway!"

"Damn! Tell me... why did I rush to find Zhou Wei first! Can he approve land for me or what!"

"Right, make suggestions for Guangzhou's economic work! Hehe, then don't mind if I do!"

Chu He strode to the door, opened it, and called out loudly:

"Orderly!"

"Come here!"

"Get me paper and pen!"

The orderly, specially instructed by Liu Xiang, respectfully handed over brand new paper and pen. Then, another tray of snacks was brought in.

"What? Black tea?" Chu He wasn't used to this taste.

"I'll change it for you right away!" The female orderly was most clever, immediately understood, and asked very attentively, "What kind of tea do you prefer?"

"I'm used to drinking green tea, nothing too fancy. I'm not a picky person." At this moment, he appeared even more "approachable," "Leave the black tea. It's already brewed; can't waste it. Just bring me a cup of green tea later."

"Okay, we have Longjing tea from Hangzhou, I'll bring it to you shortly."

This small gesture made Chu He's mood even more pleasant. After muttering a few curses about Zhou Wei, Chu He finally settled down and started organizing his thoughts from a mind map.

When one concentrates on work, time flies. Before Chu He knew it, he had drunk the entire pot of pre-Qingming Maojian dry, and only then realized he must have been sitting for a long time; his old waist couldn't take it anymore. Standing up and briefly organizing the four or five pages he had drawn in an extremely stream-of-consciousness manner, Chu He pounded his waist and twisted, doing four sets of eight counts left and right before feeling a bit better. Just as he was about to call someone to refill the hot water, the door suddenly knocked dong dong.

"Reporting to Chief! Senator Ren is here!" Judging by the voice, it was his own guard. This guy... was also quite foolish, going to call someone and almost getting himself lost...

And this Senator Ren...

Hiss! Who would have thought Liu Xiang's side was so straightforward, and yet this fellow arrived so late! He didn't make it to the grievance session, and now I'm here thinking of ideas, and he finally shows up!

Oh, right! Respect! Damn it, respect! Must respect!

Chu He quickly adjusted his state, assuming the posture of the Duke of Zhou spitting out food and wearing shoes backwards to welcome guests. He stomped loudly on the floor, forcefully twisted open the door lock, grabbed the hands of the person at the door with a delighted expression: "Old Ren! You finally made it!"

Ren Youzi had been "politely declined" again today. He came to Guangzhou specifically after asking Yi Fan for leave. This Cheka leader was already very unhappy about his leave request—the Cheka was always busy. But since everyone was a Senator, Yi Fan couldn't refuse, so he just said a few words like "there's a lot of work, come back early."

"Come back my ass! I'm never coming back!" When walking out of Yi Fan's office, Senator Ren thought to himself—he had spent several days drafting an "ingenious" plan, preparing to submit it to Zhou Wei in the form of a "memorandum," and "take off" with it.

However, upon arriving in Guangzhou, there were quite a few people wanting to ride the hype—this was fine. The problem was that Zhou Wei was nowhere to be found. He went to the office several times, and besides submitting his memorandum, he didn't see a single hair of Zhou Wei. That pretty female secretary, apart from rolling her eyes and saying a few "not convenient to disclose," couldn't get any information out of.

"Damn, had I known I should have done a thorough audit when doing the departure audit for the Ministry of Colonial Affairs! Even a piece of toilet paper should have been investigated thoroughly!"

Already in a bad mood, he didn't take seriously the invitation from that chance-encountered Senator to "have a drink together." In the end, instead of going back to his lodging by the shortest route, he took his guard to stroll by the Pearl River for quite a while. He slowly made his way back to the guesthouse entrance—tomorrow he was preparing to try his luck one more time; if he couldn't run into Zhou Wei, he would book a ticket back to Lingao.

"Just you wait, as long as your Nanyang Company is still state-owned, if I don't audit you to the bottom and make you rectify for 365 days a year and hold twelve hearings, I'll change my surname to Zhou!"

With such resentment, he had just stepped into the guesthouse door when he was stopped by the front desk attendant—pointing to a blockhead dozing off in the lobby, saying a Senator had sent a guard to contact him. Upon waking this blockhead and asking, he learned that a "Senator Chu He" he had just coincidentally encountered who wanted to "have a drink together" with him wanted to meet, and the location was actually the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Ren Youzi was puzzled—when did this guy airdrop into the Guangzhou Municipal Government?

Meeting at the government, just go then!

Going was going, but Senator Ren also kept an eye open, chatting up this Little Pu on the way. It turned out Little Pu was quite honest, and in a few words spilled everything about Chu He.

Now Ren Youzi was about to spit blood: So you, Senator Chu, came to run relationships just like me! As a result, you had a conflict with Zhou Wei's secretary and ran to the municipal government to "find someone to reason"?! Can Liu Xiang handle this matter? If he could, I would have gone long ago. What business would you have! Are you a primary school student, fighting and calling your parents! Pah! What kind of parent is Liu Xiang!

Needless to say, calling himself to go was to strengthen the "complaint" team. Was this anything to show one's face about? He didn't want to continue walking before taking many steps, but on second thought, it wasn't good to turn back halfway—regardless of whether Liu Xiang backed this Chu He or not, he was already halfway there. Turning back, wouldn't that be offending this whoever Chu He to death? So on one hand he was dissatisfied with Zhou Wei, and on the other hand he was giving Chu He the cold shoulder? No matter what he thought in his heart, he couldn't do things this way! Thinking of this, Ren Youzi had no choice but to drag his feet unhappily—he was already late returning, and if he delayed a bit more, the other side should have finished talking and sent Chu He away. Maybe they'd meet on the way, and they wouldn't have to meet at the municipal government, which would be super awkward.
