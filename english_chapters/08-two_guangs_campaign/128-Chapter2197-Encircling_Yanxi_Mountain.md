# Chapter 2197 - Encircling Yanxi Mountain

It did not take much effort before Li Wu confessed. But he was merely Li Sanjiu's bodyguard, possessing little information of value. He only knew that roughly two thousand Yao tribal warriors had come to Lianzhou, though they claimed to be "five thousand elite soldiers." They were well-armed but had almost no armor, few firearms, and very little gunpowder. The headmen put little store in firearms. Beyond this, he could provide nothing useful. However, the work team did learn from him one crucial cause of the uprising: salt.

After Xiong Wencan assumed his post as Governor-General of Liangguang, he had begun rebuilding the military. Rebuilding required money. And the means of raising money was naturally "taking from the people." Salt was naturally included.

Thus salt prices had been climbing steadily for years. The Yao territories lay deep inland and produced no salt of their own, relying entirely on Han merchants for supply. Salt in the Yao regions was always more expensive—Han peddlers selling salt there charged far above market price. Trading a fat chicken for a single *jin* of salt was not unusual. In recent years, prices had doubled again, leaving many *pai* and *chong* settlements subsisting on bland food. Resentment ran deep. Li Sanjiu had merely seized the opportune moment.

When the Council of Elders had taken Guangzhou, fighting erupted across Guangdong. Salt trade routes were severed; coastal salt could no longer be transported inland, driving prices higher still. In Lianzhou city, some salt merchants had already sold out their stocks while others hoarded for exorbitant profits. Salt prices in the Lianzhou region had soared to extraordinary heights. In the Yao territories, salt had become unavailable at any price—the roads were too dangerous for any merchant to risk transport. In truth, the Eight Pai Yao rebellion's primary spark was the salt stored within Lianzhou city.

Salt—always salt. Huang Chao recalled the academic papers he had read which stated that the Great Wattle Gorge Yao Rebellion had erupted precisely because certain Guangxi *tusi* chieftains and local officials had monopolized the salt trade, inflaming social tensions. In Huang Chao's experience, whether dealing with the Li uprisings in Hainan or the Yao rebellions in Liangguang, there were primarily two causes: first, unequal terms of trade with the Han; second, harsh living conditions and low productivity. Under such combined pressures, it was hardly surprising that these mountain-dwelling minorities turned to violent plunder for survival. Temporary military suppression could manage things for a while, but given enough time, the cycle would inevitably repeat.

But it was still too early to address the root causes. Huang Chao pulled the *Lianyang Region Economic and Cultural Development Outline* from his satchel—the same document he had reviewed countless times—and stuffed it back in. He had written this document himself, drawing on his experience in Hainan and referencing poverty-alleviation materials from the old timeline.

In truth, the Lianyang region's population pressure was far lighter than in the old timeline, and the environment was well preserved. Though mountains dominated and flat land was scarce, much wilderness remained to be cleared. Inland river transport was remarkably convenient, and abundant resources awaited development. Compared to the counties in Hainan where he had once served, this place could be called prosperous.

"As long as peace can be maintained, this region has tremendous potential."

Though this was not the same timeline—this "Lianzhou" was not the Lianzhou Huang Chao had come from—his affection for this land had never wavered.

Yet the Eight Pai Yao problem weighed constantly on his mind. He understood clearly: whether the Lianyang region could enjoy peace depended entirely on whether he could successfully pacify the Yao.

The so-called Eight Pai Yao were the collective name for the Yao people living in the territory between Lianzhou and Lianshan. Their larger villages were called *pai* by the Han, and their smaller ones *chong*—hence "Pai Yao." The eight largest settlements—Majian, Junliao, Libadong, Huoshao, Dazhang, Nangang, Hengkeng, and Youling—along with numerous smaller villages gave rise to the saying "Eight Pai, Twenty-Four Chong," and thus the name Eight Pai Yao.

Unlike neighboring Han clan villages, a single *pai* did not necessarily contain only one surname—Nangang Pai, for instance, had the Deng, Tang, Pan, and Fang surnames. Of the Eight Pai, the three eastern ones—Nangang, Hengkeng, and Youling—fell under Lianzhou's direct jurisdiction and were called the "Prefecture's Three Pai," "Eastern Three Pai," or "Outer Three Pai." The remaining five were in Lianshan County's territory and were known as the "County's Five Pai," "Western Five Pai," or "Inner Five Pai."

The Pai Yao were a settled branch of the Yao people with relatively advanced social organization and production levels, making them somewhat more formidable in battle than the nomadic "Mountain-Wandering Yao." The *pai* were mutually independent and answered to no central authority, so although Pai unrest occurred year after year, full-scale uprisings involving all Eight Pai were relatively rare. Historically, the Eight Pai Yao rebellions would continue until they were finally suppressed in the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty.

"This operation must be swift and decisive!" Huang Chao murmured to himself.

In the predawn hours, the troops began constructing pontoon bridges. With the *Dafa* launches serving as tugboats, even though sunrise was still two or three hours away and they could only work by torchlight, the bridges were quickly completed. One pontoon bridge used over a dozen small boats collected along the river as floats; the other used inflated ox-hide bladders brought along with the army. They were connected with cables, anchored with wooden stakes on both banks, and planked over with boards.

The troops, having rested for most of the night, began crossing the river. The Fubo Army, the Li-Miao Company, and the various National Army units were all in high spirits. But the Yangshan Provisional Squadron, which had marched mountain roads all day and arrived only a few hours earlier, was visibly flagging. This provisional squadron of Yonghua Yao numbered only about eighty men—already stripped of the old and weak—but their physical condition could not compare to the Fubo Army's. After the long march without adequate rest, fatigue was showing.

Huang Chao did not expect much from them for combat—nor did he trust this unit that had not yet been reformed and trained. But their very presence sent an important signal to the Eight Pai Yao: their alliance with the Yonghua Yao had already collapsed. This was Huang Chao's first step in fracturing the rebellious Yao.

As dawn broke, all units had crossed the river safely. The Fubo Army company covered the artillery team's seizure of North Hill; two National Army squadrons, each accompanied by a contingent of Yonghua Yao, split into upper and lower routes and encircled Yanxi Mountain before the Eight Pai Yao on the summit could react. The Li-Miao Company deployed south of Yanxi Mountain to observe and defend against both the Eight Pai Yao besieging the city and the Lianzhou garrison within.

When Li Sanjiu awoke, he discovered that the Australians had encircled him completely. He was stunned—reports of the Australians building pontoon bridges had reached him from the very start. Li Sanjiu had estimated that even if the enemy began construction at midnight, they would be unlikely to finish by the following evening. Given the Yao force's organizational capacity, launching a night attack rashly would likely fail and might throw their own ranks into chaos. So he had merely instructed his men to "keep watching."

He had not expected that by first light, the Song troops had already crossed the river and encircled the Yanxi Mountain area!

Li Sanjiu was a veteran campaigner and did not panic. He sent men to liaise with the various headmen on the mountain while dispatching others to gather intelligence on the enemy.

The news was mixed. The good news was that the enemy numbered far fewer than he had imagined—at most around a thousand, and dispersed across multiple positions. Though they held key chokepoints, they might not withstand a concentrated assault from his main force.

The bad news was that the force surrounding him included Yao warriors.

A sudden realization struck him: had the Yonghua Yao already betrayed him?

This thought sent a chill down his spine. Coercing the Yonghua Yao into joining the uprising had been his "masterstroke"—a feint to draw the Australians' attention and constrain their movements.

As long as the Yonghua Yao had not submitted to the Australians, even if the Australians recaptured Yangshan, the Yonghua could still tie down their forces. Yet the Yonghua had proved so feeble—not only had they meekly surrendered Yangshan, they had followed these Song troops to attack him!

"Quickly, arm yourselves and prepare to break out!" Li Sanjiu was issuing orders when suddenly someone reported: Li Wu had returned.

"Bring him to me at once," Li Sanjiu commanded.

When Li Wu arrived, Li Sanjiu berated him furiously, demanding to know where he had been and whether he had delivered the message in time.

Li Wu protested his innocence, recounting every detail of his mission. He explained that he had been released by the Australian "Lord Huang, Commissioner for Pacifying and Suppressing Lianyang and Military Governor of Lianzhou," to bring back a message.

"What message?"

"This..." Li Wu hesitated, glancing at the headmen and *tianchang gong* around them. "Lord Huang... wants you... to surrender immediately... and your life will be spared..."

Li Sanjiu erupted in curses. The enemy had not only refused to negotiate—they had pressured the Yonghua Yao into submission and now demanded his surrender as well. His clever schemes had come to nothing; in moments, he would lose everything.

"Chief! Now is no time for anger," Li Wu urged. "The Song forces are mighty and have brought heavy artillery. If we fight, we'll suffer for certain—we must flee at once."

This reminder sobered Li Sanjiu. Breathing heavily, he said: "Fear not—I still have a trick up my sleeve."

That trick was the two hundred Junliao Pai warriors concealed on Jinfeng Mountain—originally positioned to guard against the Lianzhou garrison. Should the garrison break the siege, Li Sanjiu planned to lead the Yanxi Mountain Yao in a feigned retreat eastward, luring the garrison to pursue. When they reached Jinfeng's southern flank and exposed themselves, a smoke signal would send the Jinfeng force charging down to strike from the side while his main force wheeled about for a pincer attack.

Though the Australians carried muskets and artillery, they were fewer in number. If he signaled the Junliao Pai to descend and strike at the enemy's flank and rear, their deployment would be thrown into chaos, drawing their attention. The Yao on Yanxi Mountain could then charge downhill for a pincer attack on the Australians positioned at the north of the mountain, then break through in the confusion.

Victory or defeat hung on this moment! Li Sanjiu made his decision instantly. "Quick—raise the black smoke signal!" He added: "Summon all the headmen to me immediately!"

The Junliao Pai on Yanxi Mountain were among the most defiant of the Eight Pai. Whenever the Eight Pai rose in rebellion, Majian and Junliao invariably led the charge. Not only did they have the most able-bodied men, but they were also more fierce and battle-hardened. This force was, in effect, Li Sanjiu's emergency reserve.
