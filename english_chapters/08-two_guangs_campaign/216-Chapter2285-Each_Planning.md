# Chapter 2285: Each Planning

Of course, regarding taxation, the senior Finance Bureau officials in Guangzhou had policies in place. For a "front-line city" like Wuzhou, control rested mainly with the central government, and allocations came from the center—though localities could also claim a share. Given Wuzhou's current status, the Finance and Tax departments would very likely just process the paperwork and allocate the summer grain to Wuzhou directly...

Thinking this through, Xie Erren felt his confidence rise. He nodded. "Your idea is sound. Go back and work out the details, then sound out the merchants."

Luo Yangming agreed at once. Then he mentioned his suspicions about "Master Hao" and expressed hope that a letter could be sent to Teng County for an "external verification" of the man's background.

"That's simple," Xie Erren said, jotting it down casually in his notebook. "I'll have Old Zhao send a document when he's drafting papers this afternoon." He added, "If you really suspect him, just detain him. One round of interrogation and we'll know everything."

"He hasn't done anything wrong—why arrest him for no reason? I think he's a capable man with practical skills, and an upright gentleman as well. If there's no problem, he could be useful. But if he does harbor some sinister intent, having evidence first will make it easier to get him to talk."

"Very well, you're the expert. I won't interfere with your methods." Xie Erren was in good spirits. "The external check should have results within a week at most. Just wait for word."

Armed with this authorization, Luo Yangming returned to make arrangements. If he was going to raise funds, he needed to select the right targets—no simple matter. He suddenly remembered that this idea had come from Master Hao in the first place. He might as well consult him and see what suggestions he had. If the man really was a cunning old fox, perhaps his true colors would show.

With this in mind, he summoned both Li Wensheng and Yi Haoran, betraying nothing in his expression. He explained that the Chief had approved raising capital from merchants to purchase grain, then added with an air of mystery:

"For now, this is still confidential. The Chief has entrusted me with handling the matter. We'll need to proceed carefully. You two, I know, are men of deep wisdom—please advise."

Li Wensheng, unaware of the hidden agenda, smiled. "What's there to advise? As long as there's silver to be made, the merchant families will come swarming like flies to blood. The moment news gets out, our threshold will be trampled flat."

Yi Haoran remained wary. He knew his employer already suspected him, and the man served the Australians regardless of whether he was actually their spy. He would need to respond carefully.

Reviewing the situation, he decided he shouldn't avoid this matter—otherwise he would only appear guilty. So he said with carefully calibrated enthusiasm, "This is truly a venture that benefits both country and people! In my humble opinion, among the local merchants, the wealthiest are the Pingma firms—but most of them are lying low these days, hoarding their silver. Next would be the rice and grain traders—Employer knows their situation better than anyone. Then there's the Silk Cloth Guild. The silk trade requires heavy capital investment. Though Governor Xiong squeezed them once, they should still have some reserves..."

"Well said, sir." Seeing that Yi Haoran didn't dissemble but directed the conversation toward the Silk Guild within a few sentences, Luo Yangming—no fool—immediately thought of Jiang Qiuchan. Miss Jiang was Ding A-tao's best friend, and Hao Ran had been recommended to the shop by Jiang Qiuchan through Ding A-tao's connections...

So that was it. Luo Yangming understood now: the man was simply returning a favor, trying to throw the Jiang family some business. Perhaps there was even some personal benefit involved. His suspicion of Master Hao eased somewhat—at least in this matter, there was no conspiracy, just the usual patronage politics.

"The Silk Guild is a good choice. But who specifically should we approach?" he asked deliberately.

Hao Ran gave a dry laugh. "As far as I know, the Ruijintang Jiang family has always been eager to cooperate with the Senate. Master might pay them some attention."

Luo Yangming nodded slightly. "Shopkeeper Jiang? Since he took over from his father, the shop hasn't shown any particular growth. A man capable only of holding the fort."

"Exactly. Because he can only hold the fort, and with all this chaos, he probably can't even manage that much longer. He'll be willing to take a gamble."

"Since you recommend his family so highly, I'll pay him a visit tomorrow."

"There's no need for Master to visit him personally—just send A-Chun with a message and he'll come running." Yi Haoran deliberately adopted an anxious expression.

Seeing his eagerness, Luo Yangming actually felt somewhat reassured. Whatever else this Master Hao might be—even if he was a former government man—he was just a stranded scholar. He couldn't stir up much trouble. Better to wait for the Teng County verification to come back and proceed accordingly.

"Luo Yangming suspects me now. We need to move faster." Yi Haoran surveyed their surroundings carefully, confirming no one was watching, and spoke in a low whisper.

"General Song sent Zhang Yong to contact me," said Jiang Suo, poling the boat. "Everything's ready on his end. I've also arranged our people—we're just waiting to move. But there's been no news from Advisor Chang. He hasn't come out for several days now."

Hearing that Chang Qingyun had gone silent, Yi Haoran couldn't help feeling worried. That Juren Chang had never shown much backbone. Yi Haoran had coerced him using leverage; if the man couldn't bear the psychological pressure and reported them, everything would be lost.

Unfortunately, there were still several matters that required someone in Chang Qingyun's position to handle. That was precisely why Yi Haoran had risked recruiting him in the first place.

"Should we send someone to contact him?"

"Not yet. Where he's staying, there are too many people and too many eyes. It would be too conspicuous."

"That's not a problem. We have a newly recruited brother serving right in Sanheui. Let him take a look first—if nothing seems amiss, he can quietly pass a message and invite him out."

"Good. Do it that way."

As it turned out, Chang Qingyun had been forced to become Sun Qiaoniang's "adoptive father." That same night, a "wedding" of sorts had been held. Liu Youwang was a boor who cared nothing for proper customs like the three matchmakers and four betrothal gifts. But there were plenty of sycophants in the camp. The moment Liu Youwang announced he wanted to "marry," someone rushed to decorate the hall while others brought congratulatory gifts. Before nightfall, a wine banquet had been laid out.

Chang Qingyun had been unwilling to play "adoptive father," but he didn't dare resist. In a daze, he put on new clothes. Two sturdy servant women escorted Sun Qiaoniang to "kowtow to her adoptive father." The girl absolutely refused to bow. They forced her to her knees and pressed her head to the floor three times. Chang Qingyun was so mortified he turned his face aside, unable to look at her.

What followed was a chaotic whirl. Chang Qingyun moved like a puppet—doing whatever others told him, completely numb, as though trapped in a nightmare.

The farce lasted until nearly the third watch before it wound down. Liu Youwang and his pack of cronies naturally drank themselves unconscious. Chang Qingyun, the "adoptive father-in-law," was also plied with wine until he could barely stand. He didn't wake until the following afternoon, in his own dormitory bed.

Once the wine fog cleared, Chang Qingyun was filled with regret. Not only had he lacked the courage to help Sun Qiaoniang preserve her honor—he had actually aided a tyrant's evil by acting as "adoptive father." And then he had gotten dead drunk and swallowed his humiliation at the "wedding banquet."

He had wanted to find Yi Haoran immediately to discuss plans for an uprising. But that very night came the news that Sun Qiaoniang had taken her own life. Liu Youwang flew into a thunderous rage; Chang Qingyun was swept up in the aftermath and arrested. He received a beating for no clear reason and was only released two days later.

Sun Qiaoniang's suicide struck Chang Qingyun like a hammer blow. Her desperate, helpless cry of "Master, save me!" as she was dragged away after the forced kowtow seemed to echo constantly in his ears. Chang Qingyun had known few moments of heroic passion in his life, and what fire he'd had usually burned out in three minutes. But this time, he steeled his resolve: even if it cost him his life, he would fight these Hair thieves to the end!

As soon as the message from their inside man reached him, Chang Qingyun found an excuse to leave the Labor Camp and made contact with Yi Haoran.

By then, Yi Haoran had already learned what had happened in the camp. Within a few words of meeting, he could tell Chang Qingyun was no longer the same man. He then quietly explained the current action plan.

The core of the plan was exactly as Gou Xunli had suggested: raid the Prefecture Yamen, capture or behead Xie Erren. Simple in concept, difficult in execution. The garrison inside and outside Wuzhou City wasn't large, but the units were positioned to support each other, communications were convenient, and response times were fast. A surprise attack would not be easy.

The biggest obstacle was the infantry company stationed at the Three Headquarters—the core of Wuzhou's garrison. As long as that company existed, any raid inside Wuzhou City was doomed to fail.

Secondary obstacles were the four squadrons of the National Army's Wuzhou Battalion. These squadrons varied widely in equipment and training; most soldiers didn't even have muskets. But however poor their combat effectiveness, the bandits under Second Master Gou were no match for them. Only Song Ming's veteran soldiers could put up a fight.

Yi Haoran had roughly mapped out the Australian defenses inside the city. Wuzhou itself was small. Luo Yangming's rice shop was also responsible for military ration distribution, and Wen Iron Head often came by the shop to chat—from him, Yi Haoran gleaned quite a bit of useful information.

"...This True Hair usually works and sleeps at the Prefecture Yamen. At night, he goes to the Three Headquarters to stay over. Neither location is easy to strike." Yi Haoran spoke calmly.

The Three Headquarters not only housed the line infantry company but also part of the National Army—it was heavily guarded. Meanwhile, the City Defense Command and National Army Wuzhou Battalion Headquarters were located in the Cangwu County Yamen, right next to the Prefecture Yamen. The strongest National Army squadron directly guarded the Prefecture Yamen and the adjacent Nanxun and Dezheng Gates. If an alarm sounded anywhere, reinforcements could arrive within moments.

Trying to imitate Hou Dagou's old tactic—sneaking into the city and seizing a high official—was virtually impossible. Even if they managed to break through by sheer luck, they would quickly find themselves trapped and surrounded. It would be throwing their lives away for nothing.

For the plan to succeed, they had to "lure the tiger from the mountain." Such opportunities were rare and couldn't be forced. Yi Haoran had recruited Chang Qingyun partly in hopes of creating a disturbance at Sanheui—whether a riot or arson, either could pin down a National Army squadron there.
