# Chapter 2166 - Arrival of the Chief

The assembled officers fell silent. "Sound east, strike west" required no explanation. The "east" where enemies created noise was clearly Yu'nan County seat. But where lay the "west"?

Consulting the map revealed over a dozen county seats and fortified nodes studding the West River corridor alone. Each position garrisoned at minimum one National Army squadron—first-mobilization soldiers whose equipment and training vastly exceeded the second wave of emergency supplementary forces. None would crack easily. Capturing these nodes demanded concentrating five or six times the defenders' strength plus substantial firearms.

The Fubo Army implemented divided responsibility along the West River. Within designated zones, siege reports or major enemy concentrations triggered sorties from attached stronghold garrisons. Troops from adjacent zones generally avoided engagement absent headquarters redeployment orders.

Therefore, if the enemy's "sound east" target was Yu'nan, their genuine objective should encompass various strongholds upstream and downstream centered on Yu'nan County.

Among these positions, Fengchuan County presented the most attractive prize—a transportation node accessing the He River, where the Logistics Department maintained a depot and hospital harboring massive supply stockpiles. But this nut was manifestly hard. Even regular Ming government forces would struggle capturing it, much less assembled bandit mobs.

Regarding counties downstream from Yu'nan, the most valuable remained Zhaoqing. Yet compared to Fengchuan, Zhaoqing hosted the West Guangdong Forward Command and 1st Brigade Headquarters—an even harder nut.

"Since the enemy intends concentrating forces for major operations employing 'sound east, strike west' tactics, their goal obviously transcends capturing minor strongholds or obscure county seats. Their strategy involves inciting bandits—Yu'nan County merely serves as bait attracting bandits to sacrifice themselves," Mi Longtao articulated his deduction.

"The commander speaks absolute truth!" Zhu Si agreed hastily.

Li Shenggang refrained from objecting. In his assessment, this constituted correct but meaningless "opening remarks." He nodded fractionally.

"However, considering bandit military quality and operational capability, this critical objective cannot be Zhaoqing or Fengchuan," Mi Longtao continued. "I personally speculate the likeliest target is Wuzhou!"

At Wuzhou's mention, Zhu Si visibly shuddered.

Wuzhou occupied the extreme forefront, adjacent to Ming forces retreating to defend Guangxi. Once defenders were maneuvered outward leaving the interior hollow, Ming army massing heavy counterattack forces wasn't impossible. Moreover, Xiong Wencan desperately required a significant victory—recovering Wuzhou sounded considerably better than recovering Yu'nan County.

"In that case, our company should return defending Wuzhou immediately..." Zhu Si harbored growing dread toward this increasingly perilous situation. Operating the Wuzhou Composite Company independently under field conditions imposed excessive pressure—he frequently felt "inadequate to the task."

Back in Wuzhou with Qian Duo providing backbone, he'd shoulder minimal responsibility. He refused believing the Ming army could capture Wuzhou—West Guangdong's largest city. Not only did Qian Duo's company garrison the interior, but Zhu Quanxing commanded a Fubo Army battalion outside. Though specific locations remained unknown, proximity to Wuzhou was certain. Despite frontline positioning, safety factors actually ran quite high.

"In my assessment, Yu'nan County isn't merely simple 'sound east'—genuine siege is highly probable." Li Shenggang spoke deliberately. Unlike Mi Longtao, his expression remained gravely serious. He rarely engaged in casual conversation, projecting considerable gravitas. "The Ming army's plan likely employs bandits as cannon fodder attracting our forces. After all, greater Yu'nan County pressure increases likelihood Forward Command draws Wuzhou and other garrison troops for reinforcement. Consequently, the enemy will definitely commit substantial strength attacking Yu'nan County. Pressure we face won't prove trivial whatsoever. Dividing forces currently seems unsuitable."

Mi Longtao expressed agreement.

Zhu Si possessed no counterargument, offering only "resolute obedience to assignment."

The conference determined the entire force would return to Fengchuan the following day. Half the Wuzhou Company would remain garrisoning Xugang for several days, responsible for training local militia. Captured firearms and weapons would also remain with locals—this glorious yet troublesome assignment naturally devolved upon Li Dong.

"Xugang constitutes a relatively large village in this region with substantial population. Now numerous refugees from elsewhere have flooded in. You must seize this opportunity building up militia—currently only the Xu family's private militia exists, which won't suffice."

Zhu Si understood perfectly. The Chiefs harbored greatest taboos regarding clan powers. Presently the Xu family represented forces maintaining social stability requiring full utilization, but "gradual transformation" initiatives could commence. Naturally this wouldn't prove easy—fortunately, Li Dong would remain behind, leaving Zhu Si relaxed.

The next day, after depositing fifty Wuzhou Company Right Detachment soldiers under Li Dong's command plus various firearms at Xugang, remaining troops departed for Fengchuan County.

"This is manifestly Yu'nan County territory—why garrison here?" Watching the boat fleet's black smoke fade distantly, Luo Mao couldn't suppress grumbling.

Li Dong couldn't fathom it either, but replied, "Stop grumbling. It's orders. Told to garrison, you garrison. Come—let's inspect defenses first."

The moment Mi Longtao's boat docked, the remaining vice company commander delivered shocking news.

Bei Wei had arrived at Fengchuan!

Senator presence at Fengchuan County wasn't unusual. Logistics, Navy, Reconnaissance Bureau, Intelligence Bureau personnel... they circulated endlessly. Some passed through, some inspected, some executed specific missions, some worked locally—for instance, Health Department Senators rotated duty at the Fengchuan County field hospital.

As Guangdong Region Garrison Commander and National Army Guangdong Region General Captain, Bei Wei had visited repeatedly coordinating occupied territory security mechanisms. Following the Yao rebellion and comprehensive river bandit disturbances, his visits intensified further.

However, this Senator arrival differed markedly. The vice company commander reported besides Bei Wei, seven or eight additional Senators accompanied him—some uniformed, others in civilian dress.

"The Chiefs arrived nocturnally via gunboat, proceeding directly to headquarters upon docking, seemingly unwilling to advertise their arrival," the vice company commander whispered.

"What instructions from the Chiefs?" Mi Longtao asked urgently.

"Major General Bei Wei requests seeing you immediately upon return."

"Understood. Going now."

Mi Longtao proceeded to Garrison Command alongside Li Shenggang. The space proved expansive. Multiple Eight Immortals tables joined forming a map table. Bei Wei currently stood beside it, pondering. Additionally, a plain-clothed Senator was present—Mi Longtao recognized him: Chief Xu from the Intelligence Bureau.

This Chief Xu remained profoundly mysterious, arriving quietly, departing quietly. Sometimes he'd summon Mi Longtao regarding situations; sometimes he'd convene meetings with soldiers, cadres, and local civilians.

He spoke minimally, predominantly listening. Then posed specific pointed questions. Mi Longtao never fathomed what purpose certain inquiries served. But adhering to the "don't ask inappropriate questions" principle, he never inquired, merely reporting per requirements.

Observing more carefully, he spotted several reed mats spread across headquarters flooring displaying various weapons. Mi Longtao recognized these instantly as enemy weapons captured during yesterday's battle—including even a "Nest of Bees" rocket launcher and wooden cannons.

Researching captured enemy weaponry constituted Chief Xu's consistent practice. Mi Longtao found nothing particularly strange.

"Report—" Even as Mi Longtao vocalized, Bei Wei had already spotted them. He nodded fractionally, signaling approach.

"Report yesterday's battle situation first," Bei Wei directed. "From the beginning."

"The earliest developments occurred during Wuzhou Composite Company transport. Lieutenant Zhu should report initially—more appropriate," Mi Longtao suggested.

Bei Wei nodded, gaze shifting toward Zhu Si.

Zhu Si delivered a crisp salute and commenced reporting battle developments from departing Wuzhou City. Having served the Garrison Battalion for years maintaining close Senator contact while on duty, he exhibited none of the nervousness and constraint typical of ordinary naturalized soldiers meeting Senators initially. His speech flowed fluently; his report remained concise and precise. Bei Wei listened with evident satisfaction.

"Excellent report." Bei Wei assessed the National Army lieutenant standing rigidly before him. "You speak the New Language exceptionally well. Where did you learn?"

"Report to Major General Comrade—at the Lingao Garrison Battalion!"

Bei Wei reflected internally: no wonder his military bearing and discipline proved so exemplary! That report just now earned his favor. He inquired about enlistment year and service record, thinking somewhat regretfully that combat experience remained somewhat deficient!

However, judging from the recent report, his on-site command wasn't inadequate either. Mi Longtao displayed no "disagreement" expressions during Zhu Si's report—if anything, he wore "approval" looks.

A talent worth cultivating, Bei Wei concluded. However, experience remained too limited. Appointing him Wuzhou Battalion Commander was indeed somewhat aggressive. This bandit suppression operation could exercise him thoroughly. This essentially solidified his determination forming a mobile detachment centered on troops Mi Longtao commanded yesterday.

Subsequently, Mi Longtao and Li Shenggang reported yesterday's battle situation and route conditions sequentially. They also marked relevant battle locations on the glass overlay across the map.

"The enemy genuinely harbors major Yu'nan County designs," Bei Wei remarked to Xu Ke.

Intelligence that bandits intended "significant operations" against Yu'nan County originated from Xu Ke. Naturally, he possessed no spies infiltrating bandit groups, government forces, or Yao strongholds. He'd reached this conclusion predominantly by aggregating battle reports, prisoner confessions, and enemy activity traces.

"The bandits you encountered possess considerable combat capability," Xu Ke observed, indicating the various weapons displayed on reed mats. "How could bandits afford such armaments? Even the Great Ming's official forces boast nothing superior!"
