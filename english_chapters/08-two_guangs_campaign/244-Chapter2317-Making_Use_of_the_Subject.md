# Chapter 2317 - Making Use of the Subject

"Currently, most Senators are dissatisfied with the Political Security Bureau deploying Hidden Cadres everywhere. But honestly, the previous few incidents failed to bring them down completely. Although they are very low-key now, the work of deploying Hidden Cadres hasn't stopped for a moment. This time such a big incident happened in Wuzhou; Elder Xie certainly has responsibility, but what about the Political Security Bureau? Isn't their responsibility even greater? Since this crappy bureau was established, no achievements have been seen, but quite a few troubles have been caused. It should have been completely banned long ago—otherwise, what do we need the police for?!"

Wang Qiyi knew his wife had the thought of "borrowing a knife to kill." He understood in his heart that although the Political Security Bureau was annoying, its status was transcendent, basically not involved in the internal struggles of the Senate. If they opened fire on the PSB now, leaving aside what trump cards the other side might have, this would forge a feud for the future.

From any angle, the PSB didn't hinder the work of the Finance and Tax Bureau, and Wu Mu in Guangzhou was also very cooperative with their work. Just because of "dislike," "annoyance," or "incompatible views" to go against them was honestly a kind of political infantile disease.

He coughed lightly. Just as he wanted to speak, Ai Zhixin was already shaking his head vigorously: "Director Zhang, this won't do. The PSB hasn't offended us. What benefit do we get from going against them? It's meaningless..."

Wang Qiyi also quickly added: "I also think it's unnecessary. Many cases we handled in Guangzhou were coordinated by them. And everyone cooperates happily in various works. If anyone is to open fire, it should be those famous thorns in the Senate first; we'll just pull the biased fight from the side."

Zhang Xiaoqi was also acting on impulse. Thinking about it now, it wasn't appropriate. When Chu Xiaoran committed suicide back then, Wu Mu's side was very cooperative. If she took the lead to stab them now, letting alone what Zhao Manxiong and others would think, other Senators would also feel chilled seeing it.

"Since that's the case, how about revealing a little relevant content to Shan Liang and the others..."

"No, there is no need." Wang Qiyi shook his head. "A goose leaves a sound when it passes. Anyway, someone will definitely actively leak these reports to them; we don't need to do it personally."

"That's good too." Ai Zhixin nodded. "Since that's the case, let's archive it first and pretend we don't know..."

Wang Qiyi suddenly remembered something and asked his wife: "You mentioned last time that much of the PSB's funding goes through off-budget special channels—Guangdong must also have such funding allocations, right?"

"Of course." Zhang Xiaoqi nodded. "Basically everything in Guangdong goes through special funding channels..."

"Has it all been allocated?"

"Of course." Zhang Xiaoqi felt strange. "What's the use of keeping this money in the account? Besides, the PSB's funding in Guangdong is already very little; personnel costs alone take up the majority."

"It's good that it's allocated." Wang Qiyi muttered to himself, "I'm afraid there will be a big storm in the Senate."

Sure enough, as Xie Erren's report was passed up layer by layer, every Senator who read it was shocked. Because a prefectural city was raided and breached, and a Senator was captured for a time—this was a groundbreaking first since D-Day. Although the Senate didn't suffer much damage in the overall situation, many people saw the problems revealed behind it.

For the entire Liangguang Campaign, from a purely military perspective, the Volte Army had been like splitting bamboo, invincible and conquering everything. Since entering August, they had not only taken the whole province of Guangdong, achieving the campaign goal, but progress in Guangxi was also fast. Two-thirds of the prefectures and counties under regular official rule set up by the Ming Dynasty in Guangxi had been occupied. The rest were occupied by a small number of Ming troops, merely lingering on. Although Xiong Wencan's situation was unknown, his life or death was meaningless to the war situation now. Tusi (local chieftains) in parts of the Liangguang region had already sent envoys to the Senate to show submission. Even the bandit riots and Yao rebellions that once erupted everywhere tended to ease under timely suppression. Although battles in various places had not subsided, overall, no Ming army or other forces had the ability to threaten the entire Liangguang strategy.

But beneath the brilliant exterior was increasingly weak logistical support and military strength and cadres diluted by the vast area. Now, whether it was Xi Yazhou commanding the operations, Bei Wei sitting in Guangzhou responsible for the security war in two provinces, or Hong Huangnan responsible for logistics, all deeply experienced the situation of the Japanese devils in China, the Soviet army in Afghanistan, and the Yankees in Iraq.

The battle line was long, transportation and resupply weak, and military strength scarce. At almost any point, the South China Army was in a state of insufficient troops. In the rear, a large number of National Army squadrons, temporarily formed to make up the numbers, were routed and severely damaged in batches. Although a batch of excellent teams was forged through the flames of war, the loss of personnel and equipment was real.

The occupied cities, lacking sufficient cadres and garrison troops, mostly found it difficult to carry out work and could only protect themselves. This caused many newly occupied areas not only to fail in providing resources but to consume large amounts of resources instead.

The Wuzhou Incident was merely a representative of the Senate's current embarrassment in Liangguang. This point was clear to Wen Desi in Guangdong, as well as Wang Luobin, Ma Qianzhu, and Wu De in Lingao.

"In my opinion, the war situation in Liangguang has a tendency to turn into Iraq." In a conference room of the Guangdong Regional Government, Bei Wei frowned.

"Let's not set up flags for ourselves." Wen Desi said, "In my opinion, it is time to end the war decently..."

Hong Huangnan said: "President Wen, if you say this, the war hawks in the Senate will definitely slap a 'Surrender Faction' hat on you."

"To be honest, if Chongzhen is willing to negotiate peace with us now, I won't oppose it—at least we don't have to fight during the negotiation, and the army can take a breather. If we keep fighting like this, the troop consumption is too great," Wen Desi said. "We aren't barbarians. What meaning does chopping off more heads have for us?"

"The Ming army isn't the problem now; the key is that our battle line is stretched too long." Bei Wei said, "The number of National Army squadron designations we have granted has exceeded 300, far exceeding the planned 150 squadrons—even so, various places are still requesting increased security forces." Bei Wei said, "However, this isn't the biggest problem. I'm more worried about the Senate..."

"Another uproar." Wen Desi nodded and said, "Needless to say, some people who fear the world isn't chaotic enough will get excited again."

Those present naturally understood whom Wen Desi was referring to.

"Xie Erren is nothing," Wen Desi said. "He poked this hole; he probably has the awareness. It's not hard for us to send another capable Senator to clean up the mess in Wuzhou—at worst, it won't be that bad. However, I suspect he didn't tell the whole truth..."

"You mean..."

"I learned from certain channels that the cause and effect of Xie Erren's capture are quite complex. These circumstances are currently not in Xie Erren's report. I worry that once this news spreads, it won't be an uproar in the Senate, but a monstrous wave."

The Senators present knew very well that if things were stirred up and the root of the Wuzhou Incident was dug deep, almost none of the Senators present would be spared—not only them, but even Xi Yazhou far on the front line, and many ministries and agencies in Guangzhou and Lingao would verify get implicated.

"We can't let people make use of the subject to express their own views!" Bei Wei frowned, "The atmosphere in the Senate is too bad now! It's completely a glass-hearted style that can't tolerate sand in the eyes!"

"The current situation is probably more complicated than in the past." Hong Huangnan said, "Actually, I'm not too worried about those few named opposition members. Rather, some forces might use this as an excuse to completely negate the national policy of marching north to the mainland and capturing Liangguang."

"You mean the 'Southbound Faction'?" Liu Xiang interjected.

The so-called Southbound Faction had been advocating since before the landing for the Senate to invest resources in the Southeast Asia region, developing colonies to obtain local rich natural resources.

Originally, this call had always existed. But after the mainland strategy unfolded, the public opinion offensive of the Southbound Faction became higher wave after wave, recruiting people everywhere. Undoubtedly, they would absolutely not let go of this excellent opportunity.

"Exactly." Hong Huangnan said. "Some days ago, they besieged Si Kaide at the Senate hearing, making him very wretched. This intention is too obvious. Now that Xie Erren's matter has come out, I'm afraid they will use this to negate the Northbound plan..."

"Joke, we bled and sweated to conquer Liangguang, and a few Senators sitting and talking in the rear want to negate it?! Are they worthy?!" Bei Wei said angrily.

"Old Bei, whether they are worthy is another matter. But right now, the Wuzhou Incident is definitely a big melon. Although Xie Erren is safe and sound, who knows how many people in the Senate are waiting to eat his human-blood bun. Let's first think about how to carry this matter over."

"Old Hong, I think you worry too much." Liu Xiang said, "The Northbound Plan originally had the occupation of all Liangguang as the endpoint. No matter how much they fuss, what can they do? We won't retreat back to Hainan entirely, right? I don't think anyone has the guts to say such words!"

"Mayor Liu, you are being a mayor too comfortably and know too little about the current situation in Lingao." Hong Huangnan said, "Giving up Liangguang is naturally impossible. But using the huge cost of the Liangguang strategy as an excuse to stop construction in Liangguang is the most serious consequence of this matter."

"What?!" Liu Xiang had been dreaming of being the "Governor of the Capital," planning the "Greater Guangzhou" scheme in his mind. Old Hong's words were like pouring a basin of ice water over his head.

"Presumably you know yourself that the Government Administration Council proposed shifting the construction focus to the Pearl River Delta region after the Liangguang strategy ended. Specifically including moving the Senate capital to Guangzhou as a whole and relocating part of the industrial production. There was relatively strong backlash within the Senate at that time. Although these Senators aren't Southbound Faction, they would be happy to use this opportunity to veto the capital relocation and industrial relocation. At this juncture, they might very well merge forces."
