# Chapter 2190 - Unexpected News

The "surprise troops" that arrived were not many, only a little over a hundred men, but Luo Mao only had ten basic soldiers. A single volley obviously couldn't withstand the human tide. Their firing speed wasn't enough to form a net of fire either, so they could only fight and retreat. Fortunately, a few men still had some grenades on them. Throwing them consecutively to deter the enemy, they managed not to be caught up and swallowed by the large force.

The 2nd Squad arrived in time. A head-on volley followed by a bayonet charge quickly stabilized the position. However, this group of "surprise troops" was numerous and their fighting will was quite tough. Although dazed by the first few volleys, once they recovered, they continued to charge desperately regardless of everything. Looking at the attire and weapons of these people, they were neither local Han people nor rioting Yao people; they were probably troops from some unknown native chieftain in the deep mountains of Liangguang, conscripted by the government.

Seeing the 2nd Squad's footing was unstable and they could only retreat with alternating cover, Li Dong was anxious inside. Suddenly, a cannon boom sounded from behind. A streak of white smoke swept over their heads and smashed right into the approaching enemy crowd. With a thunderous crack, it exploded, and the enemy troops instantly fell in a patch. Then two more shells flew over, blowing the enemy off their feet.

Now, even the most "fearless" enemy couldn't take it anymore and routed. Li Dong dared not pursue with insufficient forces and immediately contracted his troops back.

At this time, the sound of cannons from the direction of Shijian became denser and denser. Cannonballs constantly flew over Li Dong and his men's heads, flying towards the enemy. The enemy army, which originally seemed somewhat methodical, could not stand firm under artillery fire. Suddenly, the enemy was like ants splashed with boiling water; the nest exploded instantly, and they fled in panic in all directions. Some even ran towards Li Dong's side in their panic.

"Squadron Leader! There's the sound of bugles from the enemy's rear flank!" Malay suddenly shouted.

Li Dong listened sideways. Indeed, the sound of bugles came faintly from the wind. This was the bugle for "Charge." His spirit rose: *It must be the Fubo Army outflanking the enemy's rear to launch an attack!*

Sure enough, the enemy formation was in great chaos. Driven down from the mountain pass by the Fubo Army, several hundred people were compressed into a small area between the pass and Shijian: in front were the constant artillery fire from Shijian and the National Army's volleys; behind was the Fubo Army's fierce attack; to the right was the Sui River; to the left was continuous mountainous terrain. truly no road to heaven and no door to earth, locked in a pocket to be slowly dealt with.

In desperation, many jumped into the Sui River attempting to swim across, only to be shot by cannons and volleys. Those who drowned were countless. By the time the sound of guns and cannons slowly ceased, more than two hundred corpses were left on the battlefield, and only a very few dozen managed to escape.

A company of the 8th Battalion pursued the enemy for nearly ten kilometers, stopping only at the foot of Baoding Mountain, where they took the opportunity to establish a forward camp. The road here left the Sui River and turned north towards Guangning County seat; it was an important transportation node.

The battle at the North Pass of Shijian was the largest battle fought by the Sui River Detachment along the way, and also the one with the greatest casualties. Casualties were mainly concentrated in the Wuzhou Squadron, with four dead, over a dozen wounded, and one missing—Ai Buyi. He had vanished after going to contact the Guangning 1st Squadron; the soldiers of the Guangning 1st Squadron said they didn't see him. And no corpse of his was found when cleaning the battlefield afterwards.

"Could he have been captured by the enemy?" Li Dong wondered secretly. But the enemy routed after being surrounded; it was impossible for them to think of taking captives while running for their lives. Moreover, the direction he ran was completely opposite to the direction of the enemy's attack; how could he be captured?

The Fubo Army also had one dead and over ten wounded. The Squadron Leader of the Guangning Battalion's 1st Squadron, who retreated first, was brought before Yang Zeng.

"You are the Squadron Leader of the Guangning Battalion's 1st Squadron?"

"Yes... yes..."

"Did you order the retreat?"

"Yes, it was me."

"Execute him."

After giving this order, Yang Zeng immediately issued a second order: "Interrogate the captives as soon as possible; I want an intelligence report!"

The detachment quickly cleared the battlefield, treated the wounded, and purged the surrounding remnant enemies. From the corpses abandoned by the enemy on the battlefield, one could clearly distinguish Ming troops wearing uniforms, Yao people wearing indigo jackets, and *Lang* people (Zhuang) from Guangxi... This confirmed the previous speculation of Xu Ke and others: to oppose the outsider, the Senate, Xiong Wencan had mobilized all available resources to "add chaos" to the South China Army.

From the captives' mouths, they learned that this incoming enemy force was a native chieftain's armed force sent by Xiong Wencan from Guangxi, combined with Yao people and local bandits, gathering into a large group commanded by a "General" under Xiong Wencan. As for who this general was, the captives couldn't say clearly. They only said he was a "Han official."

This "Han official" had just arrived in Guangning with his troops half a month ago. Because he flew the official flag and had seals, he soon gathered a large number of monsters and demons. Currently, he had assembled a "mixed armed force" of more than a thousand people. The composition was complex: there were native chieftain forces from Guangxi, Ming army stragglers, various bandits, rioting Yao people, and local militia attempting to make a fortune in the chaos. It converged into a hodgepodge.

This force had occupied Guangning three days ago. Huaiji, due to the strenuous resistance of local village braves and militia, had not yet fallen, but traffic inside and outside the city had been cut off.

"What? Guangning has fallen?" Yang Zeng and Huang Chao were greatly shocked to hear this news.

Although some county seats had indeed fallen after the bandit chaos spread, the county seats that fell to bandits were all those where no personnel had officially been sent to take over yet, and were "maintained" temporarily by local gentry or surrendered Ming local officials. These county seats either lacked armaments or the surrendered garrisons were half-hearted, easily exploited by external forces. Their fall wasn't strange. But Guangning County had a naturalized citizen County Director sent there, and also a squadron of the National Army.

This squadron even had the spare capacity to send a squad to garrison Shijian, showing that the situation around them wasn't critical.

"Where are the Great Song officials in the county?" This was what Huang Chao cared about most.

"The Great Song officials in the county, some died in battle, some were killed. Heard they killed quite a few people. The Magistrate was caught and beheaded..."

This blow was heavier than just now. Especially for Huang Chao. Although he didn't know this County Director, he knew that those who could be appointed as County Directors by the Senate were all top-notch elites among naturalized citizens. Many had followed the Senate for five or six years, working their way up step by step from village cadre or administrative cadre in enterprises and organs, cultivated over many years.

And the more than ten naturalized cadres who went with him to organize the team were also mostly elites carefully cultivated for many years, possessing both grassroots experience and training.

The loss of these cadres was far more serious than the loss of several National Army squadrons.

As for how the county seat fell, the captives couldn't say why, only knowing that a stratagem was used to take it from the inside and outside. Part of the National Army died in battle, another part surrendered to the enemy when the city fell, and the remnants and a few surviving cadres fled to Huaiji.

Hearing that a few people survived, Huang Chao felt a bit better. But hearing that some surrendered, he felt even worse. In all the years since the Fubo Army was founded, no matter what great storms they encountered, there had never been units or soldiers who actively surrendered. This time such a situation actually happened!

"Most of the National Army are insufficiently trained; it's only natural that their fighting will isn't strong. Chief doesn't need to mind too much," Yang Zeng said. "They are all old soldiers and commoners temporarily conscripted; how much fighting will can they have? I think having units like the Wuzhou Squadron that can fight is already exceeding expectations. Even that Guangning 1st Squadron, retreating before the enemy without collapsing on the spot is already considered quite good."

"You're right. We were too rash—didn't train them properly, on what basis did we ask them to send their lives away?!" Huang Chao said somewhat painfully, "Too self-righteous!" He paused and said again, "How many cadres and soldiers were sacrificed in vain? This is all the result of our arrogance and rashness!"

Yang Zeng dared not answer. He knew Chief Huang was talking about the Senate—this didn't belong to the category he could comment on. He whispered: "We should still recover Guangning as soon as possible..."

"Not as soon as possible, but cautiously," Huang Chao said. "Don't make the mistake of being rash again."

Yang Zeng originally wanted to send a few companies light-packed to pounce straight on Guangning, but since the Senator instructed so, it wasn't convenient for him to disobey. So he ordered the Sui River Detachment to abandon boats and land at the campsite near Baoding Mountain, stockpiling transshipment materials, preparing to launch a siege battle against Guangning County seat.

Guangning originally belonged to Sihui. In the Jiajing era, the northwest of Sihui was in turmoil for years, so in the 38th year of Jiajing, Guangning County was established by carving out land from Sihui County, taking the meaning of widespread peace, still belonging to Zhaoqing Prefecture. The city wall used long strip stones as the base, covered with green bricks above, more than eight meteres high. Although not as tall and large as Guangzhou city wall, it was strongly fortified and not a small city easily taken. Originally, Zhu Mingxia and others all thought that no matter how chaotic Guangning was, at least the county seat could be kept from falling.

According to the captive's confession and intelligence: more than a thousand enemy troops were guarding the city. The strength was close to the Sui River Detachment and they had the protection of the city wall, also equipped with quite a few firearms. So whether it was commanders like Yang Zeng and Huang Chao or the ordinary officers and soldiers below, they all knew this would mostly likely be another bitter battle. However, the soldiers' morale was very high. Hearing that the county's naturalized director and National Army were killed by bandits, they all felt a common hatred. They clamored one after another to ruthlessly teach this gang of bandits who dared to provoke the "Senate's prestige" a lesson.

Considering the arduousness of the task and the casualties of the National Army, Yang Zeng decided that this time the 8th Battalion, which hadn't acted yet, would undertake the main attack mission. For the soldiers of Li Dong's squadron, this was undoubtedly a huge sigh of relief. The continuous battles along the way had already made them somewhat exhausted.

The combat power of the Fubo Army was "thunder in their ears," and their equipment was not comparable. The biggest difference between the Fubo Army and the National Army, at least on the surface, was their firearms, or more directly: they had cannons. These hollow iron pillars that were always polished shiny always made National Army soldiers envious. If the Wuzhou Squadron had had cannons during the battle at the North Pass, they might not have let the enemy walk up to the breastwork at all.
