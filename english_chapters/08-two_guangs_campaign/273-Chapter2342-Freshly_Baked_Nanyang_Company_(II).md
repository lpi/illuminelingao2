# Chapter 2342 - Fresh Outlet of Nanyang Company (II)

However Vietnam belonged to "Local Territory" range in future, so currently although the Senate had insufficient resource input to it, generally attached considerable importance. Colonization and Trade Ministry's resources were mostly invested here. Not only setting up multiple coastal strongholds along Beibu Gulf coast, but also established certain trade network in inland regions. Trade exchanges with Northern and Southern Dynasties were also very close.

Wanting to intervene in this, one had to persuade the Senate to hand over whole Vietnam to Nanyang Company—difficulty was too big. Zhou Wei considered again and again, deciding to put eyes on Southern Vietnam. This region was annexed by Vietnam only in 17th Century, development degree very low, Lê Dynasty's control force over here was also very small. But once developed, it would be another big granary—modern Vietnam's main rice production area.

...

He calculated in mind for a long time, drinking wine having no taste. Heart wanted to leave early to sort out thoughts. However to avoid letting others see his anxiety, Zhou Wei had to make noise with companions until midnight before dispersing.

Returning home, wife had fallen asleep; he washed up hastily then fell to sleep.

This sleep lasted until nine o'clock, until sun shone on face Zhou Wei only got up. Groping out watch under pillow to check time already nine o'clock, only then hurriedly got up to wash face and brush teeth, going to Organization Section to report.

He came to Organization Section, after announcing arrived at Ming Lang's office.

Ming Lang's office was very big, yet only he alone working. All rows of wooden drawer-type filing cabinets leaning against walls, sorted by English alphabets. He glanced quickly, thinking *this is also a power center ah*. Compared to Pol-Sec Bureau archive room everyone conjectured, archives here perhaps had more lethal power. After all these personnel archives were all legal, and, completely collected through official channels, much more authoritative than reports of internal lines and secret stakes.

Such powerful archives, actually mastered in hands of such a frail scholar, truly too pity.

Zhou Wei was thinking wildly; Ming Lang already stood up to welcome. Holding a Letter of Appointment in hand.

After a few polite words he said:

"Please stand solemnly facing the Wall of Senate." He said.

On the south-facing white wall, hung a huge Senate Emblem and two crossed flags, respectively blue Morning Star Flag and red Iron Fist Flag.

Zhou Wei hurriedly made an attention posture. Ming Lang immediately read the Senate's Appointment Letter profoundly. Zhou Wei listened carefully; his formal position was "Nanyang Company Director General Manager, Senate Representative".

After he finished reading the final date, handing out Appointment Letter with both hands, Zhou Wei hurriedly bowed 45 degrees receiving with both hands.

"Serve the Senate and People!"

Appointment ceremony ended, Ming Lang showed smile, congratulating him on obtaining appointment.

"I will definitely not fail mission..." His mood burst of excitement.

For National Policy Company like Nanyang Company, although Number One's status couldn't compare with various "Ministers", but having own one acre three cents land (turf), freedom degree increased drastically. Own ambition also had platform for realization.

"Please sit." Ming Lang said smilingly, "No need to say polite words. Let's talk some serious business."

Zhou Wei sat down on the chair in front of him. He was more or less somewhat apprehensive. Speaking of which, this General Manager position had great elasticity. Although company freedom degree was not bad, it didn't mean he enjoyed same power. Exactly what kind of power he possessed, was in Ming Lang's specific explanation next.

"From now on, you are the sect master (leader) of Nanyang Company." Ming Lang said, "Your responsibility range is all in this document..." Saying he handed over a folder, "You can read slowly after going back. Now I say a few relatively urgent matters."

"I listen with respectful attention."

"Nanyang Company is First Class National Policy Enterprise, I don't need to explain more on this concept. Theoretically your direct superior is Planning Academy. However Planning Academy generally doesn't interfere with specific operation measures, mainly supervising implementation of Senate's major policies and guidelines and asset preservation and appreciation. Specifically your business superior is Colonization and Trade Ministry."

"Understood."

"Then is Southeast Asia Company." Ming Lang said, "This company now is Nanyang Company's subsidiary in structure. Its full set of team you can accept over. Utilize it fully."

"I am still relatively familiar with Southeast Asia Company's situation." Zhou Wei had designs on Southeast Asia Company long ago, and in these years although he wasn't responsible for trade work, he was fully familiar and mastering relevant situation briefings and materials.

"That couldn't be better." Ming Lang stood up extending hand, "Wish you everything smooth in new work post!"

Next he ran to Colonization and Trade Ministry again, getting Southeast Asia Company's documents from Si Kaide, then went to Planning Academy, obtaining detailed documents of Nanyang Company relevant authorization...

Running all the way, time stayed in every place wasn't long—according to Ming Lang's saying that was "Routine Business", "Fulfilling Procedures". When he went out in morning he was still Colonization Division Chief of Colonization and Trade Ministry, standing at the finish line of this journey: General Office, he was already "Nanyang Company" Director General Manager. Namely de facto Company Number One.

According to conventional practice, he first went to General Office to collect his "Key", namely new office location.

"Office is already arranged for you." Xiao Zishan took out key card, "This is your temporary office location—just inside Southeast Asia Company Office in Bopu Customs Building."

Zhou Wei knew this place. Southeast Asia Company's office wasn't big—because this company itself wasn't big company, couldn't talk about status either, mainly giving various surrendering pirate leaders an outlet. Theoretically it was a trade company in Southeast Asia direction, actually main business was conducting trade and shipping in China coastal regions.

Advantage was this company's people and ships were all ready-made, having own wharves and warehouses in main ports of Senate controlled area and various trade partners' ports. Also its old business network.

Taking this team over, could start business directly. This counted as largest investment given to him by the Senate.

"Minister Cheng told you about new company's shareholding structure right?"

"Told!" Zhou Wei nodded.

Meeting with Cheng Dong was very important. Newly established Nanyang Company was a mixed shareholding National Policy Company. In specific shareholding so-called State Owned Share 51% was transferring original Southeast Asia Company's State Owned Share part to Nanyang Company.

As for "Senator Personal 5%", this was real. Senate's 5% no need to say more, that was because this money was in General Office's account. Specifically speaking, that was the part collectively possessed by Senators stipulated initially.

This money accumulated till now although consumed by several "Stimulus Consumptions", accumulated number still very considerable, in semi-frozen state. Directional quantitative usage. But now Cheng Dong opened a hole, allowing Senator individual to purchase part of mixed ownership National Policy Company stocks "according to plan and quota". Nanyang Company was the first one.

"Saying there is a sum of money settling, but presumably you also understand, this money is essentially credit. So cannot invest too much at one time, avoiding impacting market."

"So that's why Planning Academy exists, and status important."

"Correct, in the end, we are not some real financial institution, just a large size finance department that's all." Cheng Dong smiled slightly, "Fine, stop pulling these. Specific Senator share capital raising you can go find General Office."

"Since Premier Cheng already explained, I won't say more either. After all you are professional in this aspect." Xiao Zishan took out a document, "This is prospectus regarding stock raising taken from Premier Cheng, I already stamped General Office's seal. Specific underwriting work is handled by Delong, but relevant propaganda promotion work has to trouble your Preparatory Group members."

Zhou Wei took this document, like holding a stack of thick banknotes. This money very likely would be Nanyang Company's main turnover fund for a very long time.

According to figures on this document first batch sold stock Silver Yuan Coupon 1 Yuan 1 Share, total 100,000 shares. Don't look at number not big, this was almost one hundred thousand Taels of silver. In late Ming no matter within which political force range it was a huge sum.

Although Zhou Wei didn't work in Finance Department long ago, didn't mean he didn't understand current financial situation. Senate's fiscal deficit further expanding was already fact. Several relevant meetings convened just listed deficit into budget "Passing Light Road" (Official Approval) "Conforming to Policy" that's all. Deficit increase was solid. And original rigid redemption policy between Silver Yuan and Silver Yuan Coupon although still maintained, actually circulation quantity of Silver Yuan Coupon already exceeded total minted quantity of Silver Yuan significantly. Specific number although he wasn't clear, estimated at least five six times above. Inflation pressure increasing day by day.

Conquering Liangguang although costing huge, huge market volume of occupied area also digested considerable quantity of over-issued currency. Especially policy of promoting usage of new currency for tax payment massively in Liangguang occupied area by Wang Qiyi and others, currently already established Silver Yuan Coupon credit in main Core Zone, also expanding gradually in other places. This more or less gave new currency a plan of respite.

Although so, Zhou Wei also knew current stage couldn't rely on Senate appropriation anymore, this remaining 39% share was policy given to him. He had to attract investment like Zhao Yingong running China Merchants Bureau, absorbing folk savings massively—best be real gold and silver.

Looking around, on Senate territory able to satisfy this condition, only Guangzhou City. Although rich masters and tycoons there withstood blow of new tax system, massive funds accumulated in hand over many years definitely not in minority. If could get ten to twenty thousand yuan, Nanyang Company's economy would be much more ample.
