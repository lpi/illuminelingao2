# Chapter 2206 - Haggling

Xin Laonan was no good man either—he was a highwayman who, when he could no longer survive elsewhere, had fled to Yangshan. Under Li Shuangkuai's protection, he resumed his old trade.

Though Yangshan was a small place, the Lian River was navigable. Merchants traveling to and from Huguang often passed through, so the highway robbery "business" was quite lucrative.

Xin Laonan prospered for years under Li Shuangkuai's wing, but as he aged, he felt his strength waning—the trade was too strenuous. He also knew it was likely to bring disaster on his descendants. So he "washed his hands of the trade," purchased land in Yangshan, and openly became a gentleman farmer.

Given this relationship, Li Shuangkuai could safely entrust Zhang Tianbo's family to him—besides, Zhang Tianbo had also looked after Xin Laonan's "business." That bit of *jianghu* mutual respect still counted for something.

Li Shuangkuai was a seasoned old hand, and he feared this might be a trap—perhaps Hair-Clipper spies were lurking outside, tailing him. He summoned Jiang Xiaotian. This man was another of his sworn brothers, and he pursued the same trade as Xin Laonan—spending years alone on the Lian River, slitting throats and robbing ships under cover of darkness. His skills and swimming prowess were exceptional. After the Australians occupied Yangshan, he had taken refuge on Li Shuangkuai's estate as a "farmhand"—in reality, he was "lying low."

"Tonight, slip down to the riverbank in the village, swim out unseen, and go to Brother Xin's estate," Li Shuangkuai whispered. "When you get there, tell him this..."

After some twists and turns, the message—"The new Song-appointed Magistrate of Yangshan wishes to invite Zhang Tianbo back into service"—reached Dalang Market. Just as Li Shuangkuai had guessed, Zhang Tianbo was hiding at his sworn brother Sun Dabiao's place.

Zhang Tianbo had been whiling away his days eating, drinking, and amusing himself in the stockade—but with a knot of unease in his heart. Word of the Australians' yamen purges had long since reached here. He had heard plenty about how the Australians dealt with functionaries: every manner of cruel "extorting confession," and "entire families executed." Zhang Tianbo was scared out of his wits. Despite Sun Dabiao's repeated assurances that the place was "absolutely safe," Zhang remained despondent, dreading that the Australians would come for him—by Australian "purge" standards, he had earned death a hundred times over. The aggrieved plaintiffs were probably at this very moment lodging complaints!

Then this message arrived. Li Shuangkuai, his "great-grandfather in the trade," was someone he trusted—otherwise, he would not have entrusted his family to the man. But trusting Li Shuangkuai did not mean trusting the Australians: for all he knew, the Australians were laying a trap to lure him out and kill him.

After much deliberation, he consulted his sworn brother Sun Dabiao.

Sun Dabiao was unconcerned. "How many years have you been a constable?"

"I took up the post in the second year of Chongzhen—altogether, a little over five years."

"How many mortal enemies do you have—enemies whose kin you killed?"

Zhang Tianbo counted on his fingers. "If we're talking about those whose money I stole, whose wives and daughters I took—quite a few. But those involving loss of life—only four or five."

"There you have it. You have only four or five lives on your hands. What's there to fear?" Sun Dabiao laughed. "In this stockade of mine alone, there are at least ten or a dozen men with more than ten lives on their hands. Your tally is nothing—even the rampaging Yao have probably killed more than you. The Australians are at war with government troops and guarding against the Yao. Why would they stuff themselves so full as to waste effort tricking the likes of you?"

"Elder Brother is right, but still..." Zhang Tianbo remained anxious. He knew his "Three Tyrants of Yangshan" reputation to some extent.

"Whether the Australians actually want you as their constable is uncertain. But they probably don't want to kill you." Sun Dabiao thought a moment. "Why not meet with the Australians and see what they say? If there's a way to clear your name—whether or not you become constable—you could at least emerge into daylight again, instead of skulking and hiding."

"Elder Brother speaks wisely. I will go and see." In truth, Zhang Tianbo was still uneasy, but since Sun Dabiao had spoken in favor of "trying," he dared not say no. If he angered this bandit chief, the man might simply truss him up and hand him over to the Australians to curry favor.

Through Li Shuangkuai, word was passed to Wang Chuyi that Zhang Tianbo was willing to meet.

"Old Peng, your scheme really works," said Wang Chuyi upon receiving the news. "One whiff of that fragrant bait and Zhang Tianbo surfaces."

Peng Shou'an smiled faintly, conveying "all is within my grasp."

"What happens next?"

"What follows, leave to this humble one. However, the County Magistrate will need to make an appearance—to show due gravity." Peng Shou'an said, "We must give Zhang Tianbo a title to set his mind at ease and make him willing to serve as our envoy for the pacification."

Wang Chuyi nodded: "A title is easy enough. The county has plenty of vacancies; apart from Section Chief, I have the discretion to fill any position. What title should we give him?"

"He was a constable, so naturally he should be assigned detective work. By his old position, he would be the county Public Security Section Chief. But that is a key county post and an official Song appointment. Zhang Tianbo is merely a surrendered Ming official—hardly deserving of such responsibility. Give him the title of 'Detective Squad Leader.' Outsiders will not find it too surprising."

The Detective Squad was an ad-hoc unit formed in each liberated prefecture and county to employ retained constables, handling auxiliary security work. It was not a formal Australian cadre position, but the title sounded impressive.

Peng Shou'an left one thing unsaid: Zhang Tianbo was merely a pawn. Once Sun and Feng were destroyed, he would naturally be "purged." If they gave him a formal title now, cleaning up later would be awkward.

Wang Chuyi understood. He nodded: "Very well. The Detective Squad has only a handful of men anyway—he can hardly stir up any trouble."

"County Magistrate, the fewer who know about his appointment as Detective Squad Leader, the better. Ideally, he should not formally report for duty," Peng Shou'an said. "Once he accepts the post, have him devote himself entirely to the pacification mission." Seeing Wang Chuyi's puzzled look, he explained: "Zhang Tianbo is one of the Three Tyrants of Yangshan; his reputation among the people is abysmal. Though this is a sham pacification, the commoners do not know that. If word spreads, it will damage public trust..."

Wang Chuyi's eyes lit up: "Master Peng is absolutely right!"

The pacification scheme was set in motion. Under Peng Shou'an's meticulous orchestration, with Li Shuangkuai as go-between and Peng Shou'an himself taking the field, he met Zhang Tianbo at Li Shuangkuai's home.

Zhang Tianbo, seeing his old superior, believed a few more degrees—after all, during Peng Shou'an's tenure, he had never offended the magistrate. He had not served with great zeal, but at least he had not caused the magistrate any grief.

Yet no matter how Peng Shou'an soothed and reassured him, Zhang Tianbo remained wary—if this were an ordinary change of dynasty, he would not be so suspicious, but the Australians' notorious treatment of functionaries left him no choice.

Peng Shou'an knew that if he could not overcome this sticking point, the wily old rogue would never fully trust him. After much thought, the only angle was to persuade him that Magistrate Wang was not a "true Hair-Clipper" but merely a "counterfeit."

He explained: although the Australians held functionaries in contempt and purged them wherever they went, Magistrate Wang was no genuine Hair-Clipper—he had once been a Ming subject. He hinted that Wang was dissatisfied with the Australians' militarism and indiscriminate killing and wished to govern the county with "benevolence." With internal chaos, bandits everywhere, and no troops or officers at hand, he desperately needed local "worthies" to lend their strength.

This speech not only allayed Zhang Tianbo's suspicions but also laid the groundwork for the forthcoming pacification of Sun and Feng. Peng Shou'an had indeed exerted himself to the utmost.

As expected, these words dispelled seven or eight parts of Zhang Tianbo's mistrust. He expressed his willingness to "submit to the Council of Elders." Peng Shou'an naturally offered further assurances—"in the prime of life, able to serve the Council of Elders and do good for the people of his homeland," "past matters entirely forgiven."

Peng Shou'an added that Magistrate Wang did not require him to move his family back to the county seat immediately—they could live wherever they pleased. He himself need only come to the county yamen to work for the Magistrate. He was promised the post of "Detective Squad Leader." As for his past ill-gotten gains, no questions would be asked. Should any aggrieved plaintiffs lodge complaints against him, Magistrate Wang would help "smooth things over."

"...Of course, smoothing over the plaintiffs may require some expenditure, and Magistrate Wang cannot be expected to fund that himself..."

"I understand completely. As long as His Honor is willing to mend fences on my behalf, I will gladly bear these expenses." Zhang Tianbo hastened to agree.

Peng Shou'an said: "Very well. Settle your family affairs, then report to the yamen."

Zhang Tianbo replied: "My household affairs are easily arranged, but I have a few lingering questions. I hoped Magistrate Wang might personally resolve them..."

"That is no trouble. Once you arrive at the yamen..."

"Forgive my boldness—I would ask His Honor to meet me at the Heavenly King Temple at the Twenty-Li Courier Station." Zhang Tianbo said, "Might His Honor condescend?"

This put Peng Shou'an in a difficult position. He knew this sly old fox still did not fully trust him; he wanted Wang Chuyi to demonstrate sufficient sincerity.

Peng Shou'an dared not agree on the spot: "Let me report this to the County Magistrate and await his decision."

"I shall trouble Master Peng, then." Zhang Tianbo bowed deeply and presented Peng Shou'an with twenty taels of silver for his pains—Peng Shou'an accepted with a smile.

Back at the yamen, Peng Shou'an relayed Zhang Tianbo's request and added: "Zhang Tianbo does not seem to trust us entirely. Meeting on his terms carries considerable risk."

The Twenty-Li Station, as its name suggested, lay twenty *li* north of Yangshan's north gate—a market that was notorious for bandit activity. It was hardly a safe place. Zhang Tianbo proposing to meet there might well be a trap—he could have colluded with bandits or Yao to ambush the magistrate.
