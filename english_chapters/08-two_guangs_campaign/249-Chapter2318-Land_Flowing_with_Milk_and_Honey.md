# Chapter 2318 - Land Flowing with Milk and Honey

He wasn't particularly interested in the finance profession; engaging in the financial industry initially was merely because the income was high. In an environment like Lingao, the role of the financial industry was very limited; significant development would have to wait at least a few decades. In contrast, he was actually very interested in old stories of the Age of Discovery like exploration, trade, and the East and West India Companies. He was keen on being a colonist in a new spacetime. He also participated in the preparations for the Southeast Asia Company, but soon felt that this company had too little power. It was purely a place to find outlets for pirate merchants attached to the Senate and couldn't count as the Senate's version of the East India Company.

Finally, he applied to enter the Colonial Trade Department. Soon he discovered that although this department had a big name, it didn't get much resource allocation in the Senate's system. Saying "colonial," actually its main business was engaging in import and export trade.

Trade, of course, was very important. Zhou Wei agreed with this point himself, but in his view, Minister Si belonged to the category of being too "peace-loving." Why buy many things? Wouldn't it be better to rob?

The obvious result was that he and Si Kaide had a very unpleasant time. Although Si Kaide came from a foreign trade background, he knew little about colonial history and naturally was no match for Zhou Wei when a debate started.

Although he obtained the pleasure of victory in the debate, it did no good to his "career." In the Colonial Trade Department, Zhou Wei got the position of Director of the Colonial Division as he wished, theoretically managing all of the Senate's colonies in "non-East Asia regions," but this colony was just a stronghold in Hong Gai. Jeju and Taiwan all belonged to the "Mainland," and looking at the Senate's momentum, Vietnam would sooner or later be "Mainland" too.

Zhou Wei thought it over and over; only by letting the Senate "March South" could he get rid of the situation where he, the Director of the Colonial Division, accomplished nothing. Fortunately, there had been debates about "Marching South" or "Going North" since before the Senate entered Lingao City. In recent years, as the plate became larger and larger, this dispute began to surface.

Undoubtedly, facing the chaotic northern continent, the relatively barbaric, empty, and resource-rich Southeast Asia could attract the Senators' attention more. Therefore, from the meeting before the launch of the mainland strategy, there were people opposing the mainland strategy and advocating investing corresponding strength into Southeast Asia instead.

But most Senators considered that if the strategy against Southeast Asia was launched first, it would inevitably result in more naturalized citizens of Southeast Asian indigenous origin in the future population under the Senate's rule, which was very unfavorable for the population structure. Moreover, going south inevitably had to be accompanied by large-scale colonization. Without mastering sufficient native population, it was difficult to recruit enough immigrants to go to Southeast Asia relying solely on semi-public Senate enterprises like Delong and Qiwei under the rule of the Great Ming.

The final result of the discussion was to take Liangguang as the Senate's basic territory on the mainland. The native population of Liangguang, especially the Han population, was at least nine million. This number was enough to maintain the Senators' main population level.

The Liangguang campaign went from advancing triumphantly to recently falling into a quagmire. Although Zhou Wei didn't express his views much, he had been paying attention to the war situation. In his view, the current quagmire of the Liangguang war situation could just check the mouthpiece of the "Northbound Faction" who advocated continuing north to expand the results of war after occupying Liangguang. He could openly put forward the argument for going south—complying with the trend.

Putting forward an argument wasn't hard; the hard part was having people support him. After all, this was a change in strategic direction, which required a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly of the Senate. Merely "complying with the trend" and relying on the support of the old Southbound Faction was far from enough; he had to pull in the centrists.

Who were the centrists? Zhou Wei thought left and right, and finally decided to start with the industrial sector. In his view, the industrial sector was a big vote bank, but its presence within the Senate wasn't strong. Most people were immersed in their professions and rarely cared about political changes and strategic directions. If their enthusiasm for "participating in politics and discussing state affairs" could be stimulated, let alone going south to engage in colonies, being the Chairman of the Senate or Secretary of State in the future wouldn't be a problem.

After thinking it through, Dr. Zhou began to intentionally contact Senators in the industrial sector. Coming to attend this seminar today was also an important link in his plan. After all, he had nothing to do with the chemical industry; his chemistry level was roughly high school level—and he had mostly forgotten it. He didn't understand mechanics, biology, medicine, petroleum... anyway, he had nothing to do with the professions related to the Danzhou Industrial Park.

The reason he came to the seminar was entirely because he squeezed into the meeting by bragging about having a "raw material solution." He had talked about the specific plan with a few people in the industrial sector, and they were considered "like-minded" and formed a consensus.

But to turn the "consensus" of these few people into the "consensus of the industrial sector," further operation was needed.

The industrial sector was a very large department, concentrating almost half of the Senators. Roughly divided by profession, it fell into four major blocks: Energy, Machinery, Metallurgy, and Chemical Industry.

Among these four blocks, those most dissatisfied with the status quo were mainly the Energy and Chemical Industry sectors. Both sectors belonged to industrial categories that were very important but had long been constrained by resource conditions and unable to achieve breakthroughs, remaining at a low level.

Low level meant unable to speak loudly within the Senate, giving a sense of being ignored.

Zhou Wei analyzed the situation of the two major sectors and believed that in comparison, the Chemical Industry sector inevitably had greater grievances than the Energy sector—compared to Senators in the Energy sector, they had the possibility of losing their lives and getting seriously injured every day. And the production conditions they had to endure when giving on-site guidance and supervision to naturalized workers were also harsher.

As long as there were grievances, it was easy to form a consensus. After several observations and probes, Zhou Wei conducted a private "deep-level communication" with the "Two Zhangs." Both sides "fully expressed their views" and "reached a consensus."

Zhou Wei realized that the demands of the industrial sector were actually not consistent, but one point was common to all of them, and that was dissatisfaction with resource allocation.

The Senate was very poor on Hainan Island. There were quite a few resources on Hainan Island, theoretically lacking nothing. But except for iron, there was a widespread problem of too few reserves and scattered production sites. Many resources were also in undeveloped inland areas, making development more difficult.

For a long time, insufficient resources had become a major problem seriously plaguing the industrial sector. Speaking of industrial output, it could be said to be rising steadily, with a large percentage of growth every year. But this growth was simply negligible in the face of massive demand.

Only by grasping the core demand of "resources" could the industrial sector support his southbound policy.

Sure enough, this light sentence "Even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice" immediately grasped everyone's hearts. Zhang Hao responded immediately with understanding: "That's right. Without resources, just making a plan is useless as a fart!"

Zhang Xiao also immediately said: "Large amounts of resources are thrown to Liangguang to farm achievements. They ask us all day long how much gunpowder, how much fertilizer, how much medicine we can provide... Damn it, can I shit these things out? When allocating production materials, there's nothing; when transfering things out, they ask diligently!"

This immediately resonated with the attendees: discounts when starting projects, urgency like sparks when asking for things—this counted as a consistent feature of the Senate. Basically, bargaining became a required course for Senators running projects.

Although everyone knew the Planning Commission didn't piss oil or shit mines, and objectively projects needed overall arrangement based on how much was available, people emotionally always felt this distribution was "unfair" and they were "ignored." Especially the frustration after their applied projects were vetoed or discounted made them full of grievances long ago.

"Anyway, we are just a bunch of tool people." Zhang Hao began to fan the flames. "Anyway, in the eyes of Ma Qianzhu and his gang, we are just high-level naturalized citizens making the Senate greater!"

This poured oil onto the boiling pot. The emotions of the Senators at the seminar were mobilized. What Senators hated and feared most was being treated as "stepping stones for the Great Cause." As long as someone said this, it could immediately receive miraculous effects. Even Ji Tuisi felt unhappy in his heart, but he soon realized that this Director of the Colonial Division with no professional background squeezed into this seminar by every possible means, definitely harboring some purpose.

His thinking was fast, and he immediately guessed Zhou Wei's true thoughts.

However, he was not in a hurry to stop the Senators' complaints and agitation. Ji Tuisi thought, no matter what, what he said wasn't wrong. The Senate's development and scheduling of resources indeed needed to be taken seriously. Since ancient times, the crying child gets the milk. Having such a catfish jump in to toss about might not be a bad thing—at the same time, it could also increase the voice of the chemical industry sector.

Seeing the atmosphere was about right, Zhou Wei coughed and said: "Everyone knows that all the difficulties we encounter now are due to insufficient production capacity. The reason for insufficient production capacity is nothing more than the lack of resource supply. To solve it, we must solve the resource problem from the root."

In the following time, Zhou Wei began to expound on the superiority of going south with his carefully prepared materials. The main content was the "tens of thousands of hectares of fertile fields where triple-cropping rice can be planted casually" in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, "countless minerals on the coastline," "light crude oil that will bubble up just by digging a hole"... These materials were all homework he had done burying his head in the Great Library for months. To be honest, he hadn't been this diligent even when writing his doctoral dissertation.

Although Senators in the industrial sector roughly knew about the resource advantages of Southeast Asia, this was the 17th century after all, and Southeast Asia was still a "barbaric land," so the Senators didn't have much understanding of this land. Now blown up by Zhou Wei like this, it immediately turned into a "land flowing with milk and honey." Everyone couldn't help yearning for it, and the flames of "The Executive Committee harms the country" burned in their hearts—although the Executive Committee had long been dissolved for many years.
