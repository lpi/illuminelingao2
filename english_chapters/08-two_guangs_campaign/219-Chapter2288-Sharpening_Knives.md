# Chapter 2288: Sharpening Knives

This sentence was like a thunder, shocking bandits dumbstruck; one by one looking at Gou Er with suspicious gaze. Wuzhou was a Prefecture City, Two Guangs heavy town, place Two Guangs Governor-General once stationed. After Hair thief entered occupying, repaired city wall, reorganized armament; inside outside city both had garrison.  Without great army gathering, without cannons and siege equipment, relying on their these two hundred people hitting into Wuzhou wasn't it idiot speaking dream!

Half moment, finally someone trembling asked: "Gou Second Master! You... You old really have this intention?"

Gou Second Master nodded, smiled: "Look at your this pair of dumb appearance! What? All feel Second Master I crazy? Don't say you think so, I feel myself crazy too!" Saying he laughed wildly once, "But I tell you, Second Master I not crazy; before eyes has this thousand years rare good chance!"

"What good chance?" Group bandits instantly got interest.

"Truth tell you, inside this Wuzhou city has one biggest treasure, is True Hair!" Gou Er grinned hideously, "As long as this True Hair caught in hand, still afraid have no handfuls silver and future?"

Bandits cheered thunderously; one by one rubbing fists wiping palms; full brain all were confusing dream of promoting official getting rich.

"You say these to them for what? Soldiers as long as having silver, pointing where hitting where..." Hu Rotten Eye complained, "Saying much, soldiers raise thoughts."

"You say that was past!" Gou Er said, "Now situation different. Speaking to bottom, we are not government soldiers, not issuing pay either; everyone following us is mixing a mouthful rice to eat. Some fierce dangerous things, if you don't speak clearly, they won't follow doing." Saying he lit pipe, "Just say this time, directly pulling team to Wuzhou city wall saying we can hit inside, you look how they will be? Directly scared peeing! Able to spread legs running count as having guts! Jiang Suo told me, leading soldiers fighting war, first need to let soldiers know why fighting war, fighting what war. Soldiers think clear, feeling worth, then willing to exert dead force. I feel he says reasonable..."

"Isn't Jiang Suo that set exactly Hair thief’s method? Since that brat likes Hair thief’s routine so much, why being deserter?" Hu Rotten Eye said, "Besides, without silver, solely relying on rhetoric can move this group of Qiu Ba Masters (Soldiers)? Those civil officials commanding army which didn't make a good article, Heavenly Principle Human Emotion spoken distinct and logical; still not same watching demanding pay Qiu Bas staring eyes dried?"

"Nothing more than having hatred. I see him sometimes having nightmare at night would call 'Senior Sister' 'Senior Sister' calling; probably his relative died in Hair thief hand."

"Also counts as a good han!" Hu Rotten Eye said.

"A while he comes over to discuss with us." Gou Er lowered voice, "Some words only we few know."

"Understand!" Hu Rotten Eye nodded, eager to try yet somewhat uneasy, "You say, that Yi Haoran managing matter, will or not use us as sucker?"

"This isn't impossible either." Gou Er said, "Also have to guard against a bit." Saying he blinked eyes, low voice said: "He comes."

Jiang Suo rushed back from Wuzhou in one breath; plan already entered specific implementation stage. Yi Haoran not only gave him detailed Wuzhou inner city regime organization and defense situation, also submitted specific action plan over.

Although Yi Haoran didn't see specific security plan drafted by Qian Duo, but roughly guessed 2nd Squadron would depart one day in advance to Fengchuan to welcome boat fleet. This way, the night before grain boat arrival Wuzhou was emptiest: in city only left one company, then was a National Army squadron at Sanheui.

"...Mr. Yi’s strategy, is exactly starting hand in this night." Jiang Suo said, "That night, raising fire as signal at Sanheui, we then assault Sanheui with full force; Mr. Yi leads people on city responding General Song a stream entering city, raiding killing Xie Hair."

Sanheui’s situation Gou Er knew: several thousand captives, guarding was just one hundred National Army, plus several hundred "Retained Personnel"—mostly were their same kind; meeting war affairs absolutely wouldn't resist to death. Taking advantage of night color attacking over, regardless having inside response or not, whether could take advantage not saving, at least wouldn't eat loss. If war affairs not favorable, at worst walking away, wouldn't sink into city.

Comparing down, Song Ming that stream of men and horses had to risk extremely huge danger; lacking good might whole army annihilate.

However, fortune where disaster lies, Song Ming risked biggest danger, after succeeding credit also biggest. This nothing good to dispute. Own subordinates fish dragon mixed, couldn't bear such heavy responsibility. Able to mix a second class credit counted not bad. Gou Er now heart thinking thought was getting a proper official body, regardless big small, anyhow having a footing place; this days of bandit in mountain ditch he suffered enough.

Hu Rotten Eye asked: "At that time take what as signal?"

"Raising fire as signal inside Sanheui; at that time inside response brothers will commit arson inside; you seeing fire light then drum energy killing inside. Brothers inside combine inside outside with you, breaking camp in one stroke."

Jiang Suo said after breaking camp arson all way, momentum made bigger better. Wait Wuzhou city inside Hair Army coming aid, they immediately withdraw.

"...Brothers as long as luring Hair Army inside city out, matter counts done well. Others depend on General Song." Finished speaking he looked at Gou, Hu two with inquiring gaze.

Gou Er nodded expressing nothing wanted to say. Hu Rotten Eye however frowned saying: "This method I can't say any fault either. Advisor Yi thinks thoughtful! Just this reward money for brothers do what?"

Jiang Suo asked: "What reward money?"

Hu Rotten Eye said: "Brother Jiang, you anyhow served as official for a few months, don't know this Great Ming’s rule? Going to battle fighting killing all need reward money. Past we were doing robbery business, brothers didn't speak, was selling life for self. This time is proper going to battle fighting killing selling life for Court! Without reward silver who willing to exert force?"

"Once matter succeeds, Court naturally has title reward..." Jiang Suo said served as official, actually when leading house steward team daily trivial matters mostly handled by Yi Haoran; knew very little about rules in ranks and officialdom—he had no interest to know either. Hu Rotten Eye once opened mouth he was dazed.

"Brother Jiang, you really are a chick!" Hu Rotten Eye crooked eyes sneered, "Court title reward has bird relation with big head soldiers? Rewarding you two three taels silver, wanting you to remove head, you willing to go? Besides, in case General Song gains nothing? Which Court comes to bird you a chicken X egg!"

Jiang Suo temporary wordless to answer; to him: superior order was unconditional execution; didn't have concept of wanting issuing money then can fight war. He embarrassed said: "Silver, I here don't have; Mr. Yi place afraid also don't have—how about I go find him again, see if any method to raise some."

Gou Er however knew this was Hu Rotten Eye pretending posture, preparing wanting him to see favor, later good to talk condition; so didn't speak broken, only making rounding field appearance saying:

"Big Brother Hu, you don't embarrass Brother Jiang either—where comes he silver? Even Advisor Yi has a few taels silver, hasn't this many."

Jiang Suo where knew routine inside them, only could say: "Only can ask two Big Brothers to help..."

Hu Rotten Eye pretended dissatisfaction, also chattered saying many difficulties; Gou Er hypocritically persuaded for a while; this then stopped.

After this affectation, three people discussed how team depart, how attack again. Originally Hu Rotten Eye wanted to select several capable local bandits going to scout; Gou Er stopped down.

"Advisor Yi has ears eyes there; want what news don't have, why need we send people? In case captured, isn't it leaking secret first?"

Immediately arranged properly; leaving thirty trusted aides guarding mountain stronghold—in case failed always had a footing place. Also eliminating old weak sick disabled; selecting one hundred fifty capable bandits.

Weapons they didn't lack; Ming Army’s scatter in Guangdong left large quantity of saber spear fire weapons; even relatively rare armors also had forty some suits. According to Jiang Suo’s view, these bandits wanting to line formation fighting Australians was not working; but taking advantage of night sneaking attack had forty fifty percent assurance.

Song Ming side also received Zhang Yong’s news; started pre-war preparation. Song Ming’s people were much fewer; including him inside only fifty people; but these fifty almost all were elites; if not his personal soldiers then were civil military staff’s house servants. Almost everyone had armor. War will extremely vigorous; they almost every one was daring brave fellow believing "Wealth Noble Sought In Danger." Once hearing wanting to raid Wuzhou, capture alive True Hair, everyone was howling straightly; busy scraping washing weapons, rectifying armors. Fearing not able to catch this wealth noble.

Song Ming however knew this battle mostly nine deaths one life; not to say rushing into Wuzhou would face face to face fighting with Australian elites; even everything smooth, taking away True Hair. Hair thief absolutely no reason to give up; inevitably would pursue with light troops. Others didn't know, Song Ming was experiencer of Chengmai Great Battle back then; personally experienced terrifying feeling being pursued by Hair thief.

Fubo Army pursuit not only fierce, also very persisting; after Chengmai great defeat, Fubo Army almost forced all way to Qiongshan city wall; infantry forcefully pursued cavalry to collapse. If not he abandoned horse leaving big road halfway at that time, afraid also hard to escape.

Regardless can succeed or not, escape route after war couldn't not think clear first.

Obviously towards Guangxi direction couldn't go—government soldiers there hard to protect selves. Only optional room was towards north, along He River fleeing to Hezhou of Hunan. This almost was their only choice.

These days they robbed around Wuzhou; more or less familiar with surrounding terrain. Roughly walking which road to withdraw, retreating to where to rest, where getting on water boarding boat all calculated one by one; also specially sent people to do preparation work.

Song Ming settled everything well, called personal soldier Zhang Yong, giving him a letter and a bag of silver:

"Silver and letter you carry. Night of moving hand don't enter city. If succeed in Wuzhou, able to flee to Hunan safely need not say much. If war affairs not favorable, I trapped in Wuzhou, you bring letter back to my home, give to my parents wife children—understood?"
