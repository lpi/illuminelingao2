# Chapter 2150 - The First Mission

Bright pine torches were lit across the drill ground, and the men assembled by company.

The blackboards were improvised locally—wooden planks coated with black ink, or else the tabletops of painting desks or Eight Immortals tables from wealthy households. Only the chalk had been shipped from Lingao—transporting such "non-combat" supplies as wooden basins and chalk made Director Hong grumble constantly about how these items greatly complicated the logistics and transshipment work.

The instructors were naturalized cadres and officers stationed in Wuzhou, all holders of at least a Class B diploma. The primary content was literacy education.

Literacy rates in this era were inherently low, and ordinary soldiers mostly came from the bottom rungs of society, with extremely high rates of illiteracy. According to the preliminary survey conducted at enlistment, the vast majority of soldiers' educational level extended only to recognizing their own names—and even those names were usually something simple like "Chen Da" or "Wang Shiwu."

In the "Cultural Education Directive" that Wei Aiwen of the General Staff Political Department had issued to the entire military, he made clear that "cultural education" and "political education" were inseparable. Political education was to be subtly woven into cultural instruction. To this end, the Truth Office and the Political Department had jointly compiled a special *Military Cultural Education Textbook*, updated annually based on current circumstances.

The latest edition of the *Textbook* included material specially added for the Mainland Campaign, such as model sentences like: "We must rescue our suffering compatriots," "The oppressed masses rise up to welcome the Council of Elders," "Overthrow the tyranny of the Pseudo-Ming," "When the Council arrives, there will be food to eat"—which soldiers could learn and then paint directly on walls as slogans. Reportedly this idea had come from Chief Xie, who was particularly fond of discussing "the role of propaganda." So he had specifically instructed Qian Duo to tighten the cultural and political education of the National Army.

The initial education was literacy training, starting with simple basic characters and gradually introducing military and political vocabulary and short phrases. It was progressive.

However, for National Army recruits who had drilled all day and just finished eating, the Cultural Study session was nothing short of a lullaby. Within minutes, some were nodding off—and were promptly jolted awake by military truncheons, then made to stand at attention while listening to the lesson.

Thus the entire drill ground echoed with the screams of soldiers being beaten and the instructors' rebukes, mingled with a chorus of stifled yawns.

After a thirty-minute class period, most soldiers hadn't learned a single character, but they had taken plenty of more beatings.

The command "Dismissed!" made the drowsy rank-and-file feel as if they'd received a pardon from heaven. They hurried back to sleep.

Yang Erdong, having been caught dozing, was made to stand for half an hour—which meant half an hour of yawning, tears and snot streaming down his face. His whole body ached and tingled; everything before his eyes was blurry. The "teacher's" silhouette swayed before the desk, and he couldn't make out or understand what the man was doing. He didn't even hear "Dismissed"—it took Li Pudun tugging his arm before he snapped back to awareness and went inside to sleep.

After all this torment, everyone was so exhausted they fell asleep the moment they touched their pallets. Then, while it was still dark the next morning, reveille sounded through the camp. Most of the soldiers, still unfamiliar with the bugle call, didn't react in time. It wasn't until the "assembly drum" thundered that men scrambled out of their bunks.

And so the three companies stood at attention on the drill ground all morning again, enduring the agony of leg cramps along with the merciless blows of the military truncheon—anyone who cried out earned an extra kick and a comment of "like a woman" from the instructor.

To be a soldier like this made these newly enlisted men miserable beyond words. True, the officers in the Great Ming also beat people—beat them harder, even—but daily drills had been rare, and if you stayed out of the officers' sight, you naturally had fewer chances to be beaten. The Australian army officers were in front of you all day long, issuing orders constantly; if you didn't understand and stood there dazed, you got beaten.

Human potential is limitless. Very quickly, the problem of not understanding the instructors' accent was no longer a problem.

Every day was endless formation drill: wake on bugle, straighten quarters, fall in and form up, physical training, eat breakfast, formation drill, eat lunch, formation drill, eat supper, Cultural Study, then back to the drill ground to fall in and run a few laps, and finally march in formation back to the barracks for sleep. The days were monotonous and hard to bear.

"We've become donkeys turning the millstone!" Li Pudun muttered among the soldiers. Every day, apart from eating and sleeping, they marched endlessly on the drill ground. Annoy the instructors and they'd add "night drill" or "emergency night assembly" or some other torment.

Worst of all were the "tests"—starting from the simplest task of writing one's own name, then spot checks reciting the *Beiwei Army Discipline Regulations*, the *Battle Formation Orders*, the *Soldier's Handbook*... then memorizing the three key theoretical essays published by the Truth Office: *The Sacred Ship and the Dawn*, *The Council of Elders Is the Only ****** of the Chinese People*, and *The Council of Elders Is the ******* Morning Star*.

These three essays weren't terribly long, but they were written entirely in the "New Speech" and stuffed with all manner of new terminology. Even a traditional scholar who had studied for over a decade and held a *xiucai* degree would find them neither easy to read nor easy to understand, let alone these illiterate soldiers. So every company adopted a primary-school style: the instructor read a line, the soldiers repeated it. Never mind if you understood; memorize it first. Those who couldn't memorize it were treated, as usual, to military truncheons and standing at attention.

Reorganization training became the soldiers' nightmare, so much so that duty assignments during breaks from training became the thing everyone looked forward to most. Sentry duty, patrol, and construction labor weren't exactly pleasant duties, but they were far better than trembling on the drill ground. In the old Ming army days, what they'd dreaded most was "marching out"; now, all of them felt a strange longing for "deploying on a mission" or "going to war"—fighting, however dangerous, at least offered a swift resolution of life or death. This endless daily drilling was truly like years dragging by.

Finally, the day of deployment arrived. Qian Duo received orders from Zhu Quanxing: he was to dispatch one company immediately to the area around Fengchuan County seat to escort the transport convoy overland.

From Wuzhou downstream to Fengchuan County seat, there was a stretch of the West River marked by shoals—not only treacherous but shallow. Even the river squadron's shallow-draft gunboats couldn't cross. Only the gunboats with a draft of less than one meter could pass.

Previously, though the situation had been tense and sporadic attacks had occurred along the banks, there had been little danger to transports on the West River channel itself. The convoys traveling from Sanshui to Wuzhou mostly used towboat tandem formations, and vessels seldom ran aground on sandbars due to currents. The escorting motorized gunboats had powerful armaments, enough to drive off scattered attacks from shore. Moreover, the West River was quite broad, and in most sections, the ranged weapons available to bandits or rebellious Yao could not threaten the transport ships.

But on the most recent escort run, the convoy had been attacked on a shoal in the West River channel shortly after passing Fengchuan County seat.

The West River channel had multiple shoals, and to navigate safely, each voyage required hiring seasoned local boatmen to pilot the passage. The Garrison Navy had also set up a number of navigation markers at each shoal.

Yet this time, when the convoy reached Jieshou Shoal—about nineteen kilometers from Wuzhou City—the naval officers discovered that all the channel markers had been destroyed, and parts of the channel showed signs of deliberate sabotage by sunken ships. Just as they struggled to clear the obstruction, an unidentified armed force suddenly attacked from the shoal.

Though the escort party was small, the gunboats' firepower was formidable, and they quickly drove off the attackers. The escort suffered only a few wounded and no further casualties. But the incident set alarm bells ringing at both the Logistics Command and the First Brigade headquarters in Zhaoqing—the West River channel could no longer be navigated in easy complacency.

As an emergency countermeasure, under the First Brigade's direction, the counties along the West River began organizing convoy escort operations. Escorts were to be provided by the National Army companies stationed in each county, relaying the convoys section by section. While underway, National Army troops would patrol aboard motor launches. At narrow stretches of the channel, high ground, and shoals, they would land and establish security perimeters. If attacked, they would go ashore and drive off the enemy. This type of patrol also served to maintain order on both banks of the West River, suppressing bandits and Yao militants.

Qian Duo in Wuzhou received identical orders. Because Wuzhou's National Army had the largest establishment, their area of responsibility was also the largest—from downstream of Wuzhou all the way to Xintan Shoal.

This stretch of the channel included the Xilongzhou, Jieshou, Panlong, and Xintan shoals. Water depths varied—the deepest reached three meters, the shallowest barely one. The river was wide, crisscrossed with sandbars; though the gradient was gentle and the current steady, the sandbars were dense and there were multiple reefs. Upstream navigation for the convoys remained quite difficult. It took a great deal of time to cross the shoals, and boat speed dropped to slower than walking. This was prime ground for enemy land attacks.

Qian Duo and Zhu Si studied the map. The mission was considerable. From below Wuzhou City to Xintan, the channel stretched about fifty kilometers. A patrol squad, even with smooth sailing, would need two full days to complete a round trip.

"Xilongzhou isn't a problem," Zhu Si said. "It's only three and a half kilometers from Wuzhou City—within the garrison's patrol zone. Major Zhu's troops patrol there regularly. The concern is the shoals further downstream."

"For safety's sake, each patrol should be at least one full company," Qian Duo said. "The escort ships have to move along both banks simultaneously to guarantee the fastest reaction time."

"Four companies would be enough, except they're still in the middle of reorganization training..." Zhu Si started scratching his head.

"We'll have to train while fighting," Qian Duo said. "It might even be good—at least it'll temper the troops. As for your concern about the unit's combat effectiveness, for now let's adopt a temporary integrated company system: each time we deploy, we mix veterans and new recruits into a composite company."
