# Chapter 2330 - Going to Wuzhou (V)

He looked at his palm, full of fresh blood—how much hatred did it take to think of using a writing brush to assassinate him!

Chen Baibin came over to support him: "Director Ji, are you okay! Your wound..."

"Not serious, just flesh wound." Ji Xin's shock settled slightly, and he stood up with effort. Several orderlies rushed over. Chen Baibin scolded: "Quickly go get the medicine chest! Find a doctor!"

Ji Xin only felt pain and numbness in his lower jaw, his mouth full of fishy sweetness. He spat on the ground, and it was full of blood foam. He was somewhat worried about whether his teeth were damaged—although the Senate had dentists, due to limitations in materials and medicines, tooth inlay and filling were worlds apart from the level of the old spacetime. Ji Xin really didn't want to inlay a gold tooth just like that.

Fortunately, the teeth seemed undamaged, just the inside of the mouth bled in multiple places from this violent collision. Just as he secretly called it lucky, his right arm suddenly felt a burst of sharp pain. Rolling up the sleeve to look, a pitch-black circle of grab marks on the forearm, he couldn't help being stunned.

"Give me a cup of water, rinsing the mouth will do." Ji Xin barely calmed his mind—that strike just now was too out of his expectation. He had interrogated countless criminals and captives, seen all kinds of people. But no one was like this person, exploding with such powerful hatred in an instant...

With almost panicked feelings, Ji Xin unfolded the paper stained by blood, only to see amidst the scattered blood spots, thick ink writing filled with the character "Injustice" (冤), looking shocking to the eyes.

He raised his head, staring at Jiang Suo who was shackled and pressed on the chair, scolding: "Who are you?!"

"Bandit Thief! Do you still remember Sai Qingxia of Sanliang Market?!" Although Jiang Suo missed the strike, he made this bandit's face completely painted, dripping with fresh blood. The blockage in his chest for many years loosened, laughing loudly, "Look at you sanctimonious, you also have today!"

The three words "Sai Qingxia" poured into his ears, instantly opening his memory valve. That trial he presided over in Sanliang Market many years ago reappeared like yesterday, returning to his mind scene by scene. In an instant, he remembered everything.

"You are Jiang Suo!" He cried out involuntarily.

"Correct, I am Jiang Suo who doesn't change given name or surname." Although Jiang Suo was beaten until his head broke and blood flowed at this moment, and bound by chains, he didn't wither at all, instead raising his head high, speaking loudly.

Ji Xin couldn't say a word anymore, actually stunned on the spot. Chen Baibin was afraid something demonic would happen next, immediately ordering: "Take the person back! Watch him, don't let him die!"

Jiang Suo laughed loudly: "Die? I won't die, I want to watch you bandit thieves be cut into a thousand pieces..." Then he burst into loud crying again, saying: "Senior Sister! Did you see?! I have no ability to avenge you, but I made him bleed! Bleed! I'm coming to find you right now..."

Before the voice fell, several bailiffs had already dragged the person out, only his wild laughter still echoed in the air.

Chen Baibin hurriedly ordered people to prepare sedan chairs, sending Ji Xin and the arrived doctor together back to the residence in San Zong Fu. The doctor was of naturalized citizen origin, but at least had received three-year medical education from the Ministry of Health. He cleaned the wound for Ji Xin, saw the wound mark was deep, and said sutures were needed.

"Stitch then stitch, just this wound is on the face, stitch with care!"

"Chief please rest assured. Although my medicine isn't considered good, I've done unknown numbers of small surgical operations like suturing and debridement."

The doctor seemed very confident. He immediately stitched the wound for Ji Xin, and applied a layer of anti-inflammatory powder and bandaged it. Chen Baibin saw his stitches were neat, indeed not bragging.

"Take oral anti-inflammatory drugs on time. I will come again tomorrow to change the dressing for the Chief."

Senators on business trips had relevant medicine rations in their carry-on emergency kits. The efficacy was much stronger than the anti-inflammatory tablets distributed by naturalized doctors, naturally no need to prescribe medicine. Chen Baibin took out the pills, brought water for Ji Xin to take orally, and showed a relieved expression only seeing him roughly normal.

"Your appearance just now really scared me to death." Chen Baibin packed up things, "Face full of blood! Who is this Jiang Suo?"

"An old account from years ago." Ji Xin felt no major issue besides the faint pain from the wound at this time. He leaned back on the rattan chair, "I had long forgotten this matter. Didn't expect, there would actually be today!"

He didn't hide it either, telling the past events that happened in Sanliang Town during the "Pearl River Estuary Operation" back then one by one.

"...Speaking of which, my heart was also too hard. Qingxia was just forced by life, completely a bottom-level small character unable to be independent." He closed his eyes and said, "At that time, the Senate's attitude towards armed resisting militia teachers was execution without exception. I felt it was excessive. But this was the Senate's decision after all. 'Hurting a Senator' was actually not a reason for mandatory death either. At that time I also thought about pleading for her, asking President Wen for a special pardon. But thinking we had already killed many people similar to her before, now pleading just because she was a woman, if spread to the Senate, wouldn't it be a huge joke?" Speaking of this, Ji Xin shook his head full of bitterness, "Since ancient times, human words are fearful. I am no exception. So I hardened my heart to order her execution. Since ancient times sticking to beliefs is never without cost. Sticking to wrong beliefs requires cost, sticking to correct beliefs is the same, even the cost is greater..."

Chen Baibin saw his miserable face, comforting: "You don't need to blame yourself. How many things that can't see light has the Senate done purely these years! These sins of yours count as nothing."

"I don't feel guilty, just feel I was duplicitous." Ji Xin sighed, "This Jiang Suo was upright and fair, neither hiding his name, and during my interrogation, mentioned past events in every sentence. I was completely unaware, only thinking about what secrets of the Senate Standing Committee—probably being in a high position for a long time, I have long lost the heart of empathy for bottom-level people..."

Just speaking, Xie Erren came. Hearing that Ji Xin was injured while interrogating a prisoner, almost scared his soul away. If Ji Xin had any problem, the Senate would definitely eat him.

Seeing Ji Xin seemed to have no major problem except a piece of gauze wrapped on his face, Xie Erren finally let down half of his heart. Hurriedly stepped forward to hold his hand, asked full of emotion:

"How is it, nothing wrong right?"

"Just a scratch on the face, no hindrance." Ji Xin waved his hand, "This was also me being paralyzed and careless—didn't expect this fierce disciple would actually use a writing brush to assassinate!"

"This Jiang Suo is truly a daring fellow!" Xie Erren said, "Looks like we need to give him some suffering to taste!"

"That's not necessary." Ji Xin shook his head, "Besides he is an important criminal. Many things haven't been verified clearly yet. If he is killed accidentally, it's hard to explain."

"Correct, correct, what you said is right." Xie Erren regretted speaking blindly, "Wait until interrogation is clear then punish by law!" Saying that, he hurriedly asked people to send various comfort gifts. Making Ji Xin laugh and cry.

After finally sending away the overly enthusiastic Xie Erren, Chen Baibin asked: "Director Ji, I have one point I don't understand. Since this Jiang Suo was a person in the case back then, and he was sentenced to exile by you, how could he become a squad leader in Xiong Wencan's family retainer team? Aren't exiled people all escorted back to Hainan?"

"I also find it strange." Ji Xin said, "At that time we didn't have Kaohsiung and Jeju yet. Those sentenced to exile were customarily sent to several counties in Southern Qiongzhou (Hainan). Which specific county is unknown. Although exile isn't imprisonment, running out from these counties back to the mainland probably wasn't that easy."

Several counties in the south of Qiongzhou were truly places of the ends of the earth. Except for the round-island highway built by the Senate and scheduled liners, there were almost no ways to leave. As a purely exiled criminal, Jiang Suo had no legal ID, nor money. It was fundamentally impossible to leave by land or sea, let alone go to Guangdong.

Obviously, from the place of exile to Guangdong, Jiang Suo still had a hidden past he didn't tell.

Chen Baibin then suggested Ji Xin investigate this matter clearly first.

"Jiang Suo alone doesn't have such great ability, definitely someone helped him. If we can clarify the process of his escape, maybe we can dig out a certain underground organization or several collaborators. I suggest interrogating him directly, focusing on questioning this experience."

"Jiang Suo's current state probably has fallen into semi-madness, ordinary torture won't be of much use to him. If torture is too tight, killing him is even more inexplicable." Ji Xin said, "We start from the periphery first, see if there are places to cut in."

Immediately, a document was sent to Xie Erren, asking him to interrogate the original retainers, staff, and relevant personnel of Xiong Wencan currently detained and stranded in Wuzhou one by one, focusing on interrogating Jiang Suo's situation.

This interrogation asked out a big problem.

It turned out not a single person knew Jiang Suo's origin exactly. They only knew he was suddenly sent to the retainer team as a squad leader—and this retainer team was recruited by Xiong Wencan from his hometown Guizhou, equipped with Nanyang rifles, regarded as a "mighty brigade" by Xiong Wencan. And Jiang Suo came to train this team.

Such a team Xiong Wencan relied on as his belly and heart, instead of asking a veteran of the bloody field to be responsible for drilling, he got a person running horses and selling arts to train? Whether Ji Xin or Chen Baibin, both faintly felt bad.

Next, they learned from the interrogation that Jiang Suo trained the retainers to use Nanyang rifles, trained their formation, and various combat tactics. Moreover, he worked seriously, never embezzling or deducting military pay and rations, and rarely beat or scolded soldiers. He could be counted as an anomaly among lower-ranking officers.

"Needless to say, he definitely was a soldier!" Chen Baibin said, "He mostly defected from the Fubo Army! Otherwise, these simply cannot be explained!"

"Wasn't he an exile? I remember sentencing him to seven years of exile. It hasn't expired this year. Even if expired, with this criminal record, how could he join the army?"

"Because of this Liangguang strategy, the Fubo Army recruited soldiers comprehensively. In order not to crowd out workers, recruitment restrictions were relaxed. An exile like him who has been exiled for many years, if having no bad deeds locally, could totally be recruited. Pity, we are in Wuzhou. In Guangzhou or Lingao, we could look up the missing personnel list of various military branches since going north. He nine out of ten survived arriving in Guangdong with the Fubo Army, then absconded."
