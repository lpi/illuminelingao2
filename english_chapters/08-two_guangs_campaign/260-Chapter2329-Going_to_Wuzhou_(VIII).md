# Chapter 2329 - Going to Wuzhou (VIII)

When he heard that the City Government wanted to see him, He Dongli was not panicked. He immediately followed the police to the San Zong Fu.

Unexpectedly, he didn't see the familiar Xie Erren, but two strange Australians. He couldn't help being slightly startled.

He Dongli immediately associated that the arrival of these two unfamiliar Australians was nine out of ten related to the Wuzhou riot not long ago. Xie Erren's absence—perhaps his position in Wuzhou was already unstable.

He grew nervous unconsciously. Such matters easily led to major imprisonments and fabricated charges, often involving a wide range of people. Not a few innocents had lost their families and lives for this. He must respond carefully.

However, judging by appearances, it didn't look like an interrogation—at least they hadn't adopted an interrogation posture. Like Xie Erren summoning him, they offered him a seat and tea.

"Your Honor is Mr. He Shouren?"

"This humble scholar is exactly that." He Dongli bowed respectfully with hands cupped.

"We came from Guangzhou. Hearing that you're a longtime Wuzhou native, familiar with every aspect of local customs and sentiments, we wanted to speak with you."

"This humble scholar has lived in Wuzhou for generations. I indeed know quite a few local matters. The two gentlemen need only ask."

"I hear there's a Dragon Mother Temple by the Gui River here."

"Precisely. This temple is outside Dayun Gate. It is said to have been built during the Xianping era of the Great Song Dynasty. It's also the largest Dragon Mother Temple locally—extremely efficacious."

"I heard when Senator Xie came to Wuzhou to take office, you guided him as he visited famous scenic spots inside and outside the city. He also went to this place."

"There was indeed such an occasion." He Dongli's heart tightened. *Could it be about that matter?* He answered carefully. "That day we went to the Han Gong Shrine first, then to the Four Worthies Shrine. Finally, we went to the Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense."

"What happened when offering incense at the Dragon Mother Temple?"

"A woman attempted to assassinate Senator Xie in the street at the temple gate. However, it was threatening but not dangerous. Senator Xie had heaven's protection and wasn't hurt..." He Dongli's heart sank. *Sure enough, it's about this matter!*

Though the incident hadn't resulted in any consequences, he had seen Senator Xie's disheveled appearance at that moment with his own eyes—it could be counted as hanging by a thread. What worried him most was that going to the Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense had been his suggestion.

Fortunately, the Australian before him didn't pursue "how they came to go to the Dragon Mother Temple," but asked another question.

"Who was this assassin woman?"

"This, the humble scholar isn't clear either. She failed to assassinate and was captured on the spot. A young woman, wearing a white flower on her head—should have been a widow."

"How was she disposed of after being captured?"

He Dongli felt great difficulty. Though he hadn't participated in Cai Lan's subsequent matters, he had once come to the San Zong Fu to chat with Xie Erren and truly seen Cai Lan in this courtyard. Moreover, matters concerning Xie Erren and Cai Lan were not secrets among retained personnel and naturalized cadres in Wuzhou. But he had only "heard rumors" of this matter.

"She was taken to the yamen. How she was handled later, the humble scholar doesn't know."

"Is this female assassin named Cai Lan?"

"Yes..." He Dongli trembled, speaking involuntarily.

Ji Xin noticed his fearful expression and said gently: "Mr. need not be nervous. This matter has nothing to do with you."

"Yes, yes. This scholar understands."

"However, you must also understand. Some days ago, certain remnants of the usurping Ming attacked Wuzhou and caused a great mess. The Senate must investigate this matter, and investigate to the end. Who is guilty and who is innocent must be clarified clearly. I hope you will cooperate well with our work and not deliberately conceal anything. You can also rest assured—our Senate never implicates the innocent, nor fabricates charges."

"As it should be, as it should be." He Dongli secretly lamented. "This scholar will surely speak all he knows."

"From where did you hear this woman was named Cai Lan?"

"The humble scholar originally didn't know either—later I heard people say."

"Heard from whom?"

"Many people in Wuzhou city know about this." He Dongli smiled bitterly.

"Regarding Cai Lan, what other rumors have you heard?"

He Dongli hesitated a bit. "This scholar indeed heard quite a few rumors—but just rumors. As for exactly who said them, this scholar isn't clear either..."

"Just say."

He said that after Cai Lan was captured, she had been detained in the Earth God Temple of the county yamen without being dealt with. After a long time, news came out, saying Senator Xie had "taken her in."

"As for whether this is true, this scholar has no solid evidence. Just that she stayed in the San Zong Fu, which was seen by many people. That's not false."

"So many people in Wuzhou know about Cai Lan's matter."

"Such rumors spread faster among the common folk than news of national affairs." He Dongli smiled bitterly.

"Senator Xie should have heard too. Did he make any countermeasures or say anything?"

"Senator Xie seemed not to care about this."

Ji Xin nodded silently. This matched the information he'd collected. Obviously, Xie Erren didn't feel there was anything inappropriate about taking in a female assassin. If not for the Wuzhou riot, even if the Senate inquired, it would be nothing more than a minor romantic indiscretion.

"Do you know of any other strange things about Senator Xie?"

He Dongli was somewhat panicked now. These words were gradually taking on a threatening tone. He stammered: "No more... no more..."

"Think carefully." Ji Xin said seriously. "Don't have any scruples! Speaking the truth can ensure your whole family's safety!"

Chen Baibin was secretly surprised. Ji Xin always looked kind and pleasant when interrogating naturalized citizens or indigenous people, sometimes analyzing pros and cons, rarely openly using the other party's family safety to pressure them like this. What was going on?

He Dongli trembled, lowered his head, and thought for a long while before saying: "This scholar didn't have much contact with Senator Xie. When we met, we talked about local customs, astronomy, geography, and products—nothing special. If you're asking about something strange, there is one thing..."

He said that shortly before the Wuzhou riot, Xie Erren had sent someone to deliver a few paintings, asking if he was skilled at painting and could understand the meaning of the paintings.

"What paintings?"

"All freehand brushwork flowers and birds, mainly various orchids..." He Dongli said. "To be honest, this scholar can manage to scribble a few strokes of freehand landscape, but I really can't do flowers and birds. So I declined."

Chen Baibin and Ji Xin exchanged glances. It seemed their speculation was correct. Before finding Chang Qingyun as a "ghostwriter," Xie Erren had also sought out this more reliable He Dongli. Pity he didn't understand such things...

*Truly the workings of time and fate.* Ji Xin sighed secretly.

He restored his original kind expression and asked: "Mr. Dongli, you're a local native who has lived here for generations. Your connections and information must be wider than ours. I want to ask: how is Senator Xie's reputation among the Wuzhou folk?"

He Dongli didn't hesitate this time. "His reputation is fair. Though grain prices in Wuzhou have risen high these days and livelihoods are difficult—whether shopkeepers or commoners, times happen to be hard. But in the turmoil of war, he can't be blamed. He accommodated refugees in this city and relieved the poor. Under such a dangerous situation, Wuzhou city had neither corpses starved in the streets nor masses fleeing. Damaged city walls and floating bridges were also repaired. He can be called a capable official."

Subsequently, Ji Xin asked some other questions. He Dongli answered one by one. Only then was he allowed to leave.

"After going back, don't mention this conversation to anyone."

Seeing the Australians hadn't asked him to sign and fingerprint a confession, He Dongli felt much more settled. He hurriedly said: "Yes, this scholar understands."

"Looking at it this way, Xie Erren still has some talent." Chen Baibin said.

"Indeed he does. But he was too careless." Ji Xin said. "Next, we meet Luo Yangming."

Chen Baibin knew Luo Yangming was regarded as the "trump card" figure by Ji Xin. Not summoning him upon arrival but summoning him suddenly now meant the whole Wuzhou investigation had entered its conclusion stage.

Luo Yangming was summoned to the residence at San Zong Fu that night.

"Comrade Luo Yangming, please sit." Chen Baibin was very polite to this lower-level subordinate. "I am Chen Baibin of the Political Security Bureau..."

"Yes, Chief!" Luo Yangming said and began to stand up to salute.

"Don't be like that." Chen Baibin waved his hand. "You're an undercover cadre now—you shouldn't make such obvious gestures. We'll just talk quietly. Treat it as you reporting on your work."

"Yes!"

Chen Baibin introduced Ji Xin's identity: "This is Comrade Ji Xin, the leader of the investigation team."

"Hello, Chief!"

"No need to be so polite." Ji Xin said casually. "You talk about your work with Little Chen first. I'll listen by the side. If there are questions, I'll ask you."

Chen Baibin said: "Talk about yourself first."

Luo Yangming knew this was the first inspection of him by the Political Security Bureau after his relationship transfer. He gathered 120% of his spirit, reporting his background, experience, and the timing of his defection to the Senate one by one. Then he reported the process of accepting the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's assignment to come to Wuzhou for intelligence work, up through Wuzhou's recovery. It took about an hour to finish reporting.

These contents were basically the same as Luo Yangming's personal file records they'd accessed before departure. Chen Baibin asked about his work situation for the Political Security Bureau after Wuzhou's recovery.

Luo Yangming knew the stakes were high here and didn't dare be negligent. He briefly described the relevant work he'd done after Wuzhou's recovery, along with major events and public sentiments that had occurred in Wuzhou.

"Now our investigation has learned that among the several important figures in the Wuzhou riot, Yi Haoran, Chang Qingyun, Cai Lan, and Jiang Qiuchan are relatively key. How much do you know about these four people?"

Luo Yangming said: "Report, Chief. I don't know Chang Qingyun and had no contact with him. Hard to say. Yi Haoran worked as an accountant in my shop. My personal impression is that this person is upright, open-minded and generous in dealing with people, simple and hardworking in life, never had bad habits. He can be called a modest gentleman. He does things very meticulously."

"Didn't you find he had suspicious points?"

"I discovered some." He then told the story of how he had initially suspected Yi Haoran, how he reported to Xie Erren, and how Xie Erren proposed sending an external investigation letter to investigate.
