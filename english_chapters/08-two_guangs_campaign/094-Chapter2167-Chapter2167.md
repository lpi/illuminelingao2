# Chapter 2167

A volley from the front-row riflemen stunned the bandits at the foot of the hill; no one had expected a force to burst out from behind them. Just as the crowd fell into confusion, a round of hand grenades flew into their midst. Thick smoke rose everywhere, and the group of bandits that had just arrived to reinforce the village entrance was blown to pieces.

The Right Detachment, rushing down from the hill, used this thunderous strike to instantly pierce the bandit position. The follow-up troops swept through the bandit ranks like a tidal wave. Shouts of killing, curses, and wails, accompanied by the clashing of swords and spears, filled the entire valley.

Li Dong didn't care about maintaining the formation anymore. He knew that at this moment, only by setting an example could he inspire courage in the raw recruits. He roared, waving his command saber, and was the first to charge at the scattering enemy.

The enemies behind the gun emplacement were already in chaos. Some turned and ran, while others waved swords and spears, shouting wildly. Li Dong rushed in front of a bandit—this man was short, clutching a large sword, seeming terrified. It wasn't until Li Dong was right in front of him that he seemed to remember something, raising his sword to stab.

Li Dong slashed diagonally down at his head—although the command saber was ceremonial, the machine-made blade crafted from tool steel was comparable in toughness, strength, and edge retention to the best combat sabers of this era. The short bandit was instantly slashed open from shoulder to neck, and arterial blood sprayed out.

"Ah Ma..." The short bandit let out a shrill scream and collapsed at his feet. The voice was sharp and clear, sounding like a woman, which made Li Dong shudder.

However, he had no time to care who the opponent was. He waved his saber and threw his arm back: "Brothers, charge!"

His slash and shout greatly boosted the morale of the soldiers behind him. They roared and pounced forward.

Yang Erdong, having been a house guard, had experience in close-quarters combat. He was much calmer than the "rookies" around him who were still trembling with their spears. Seeing the bandits in disarray, he knew this was a good opportunity to take heads and earn merit. He immediately roused his spirits, thrusting his spear and charging fiercely. Stabbing wildly along the way, he swept aside all in his path and instantly rushed into the gun emplacement. Inside, a musketeer had already raised a bird gun and was aiming it this way. Yang Erdong immediately let out a loud roar and hurled his spear violently, pinning the enemy to the ground.

By now, he was killing smoothly. He pulled out his machete and chopped down a large bandit who had his back turned and was engaging a comrade. Looking around, the gun emplacement was piled with corpses, the smell of gunpowder and blood rushing up his nose. Among the corpses stood a few stunned rookies, their faces pale.

"Don't just stand there, rush out and kill the enemy!" Yang Erdong shouted, flipping himself over the wall of the emplacement. Unexpectedly, there was a pile of loose rocks below. He lost his footing upon landing, stumbled, and fell dizzily. When he tried to get up, he found his left foot in severe pain and couldn't exert any strength.

"Fuck your mother..." Yang Erdong blurted out a local curse. He quickly dragged his body to the foot of the emplacement wall and sat leaning against it—lying on the ground meant a high chance of being trampled by the chaotic troops, which would skin him alive if not kill him.

Luo Mao, commanding a squad, didn't lead his men into the gun emplacement but charged directly at the bandit group on the road that was in chaos trying to reinforce the village entrance. He had lost his spear in the first round of thrusts and was now waving a machete, leading the charge.

The bandits had fallen into chaos, but a few fierce elements still fought to the death without retreating. Luo Mao saw a bandit with refined sword skills cut down two National Army soldiers in succession. He immediately pounced, swinging his blade at the man's waist. Unexpectedly, the bandit was wearing armor, and Luo Mao's blade bounced off. In a moment of quick wit, Luo Mao kept his momentum and, using a rugby tackle, knocked the opponent down like an ox. He rolled over, pinning the enemy down, and finished him with a slash to the neck.

The Right Detachment's surprise thunderbolt destroyed the defenses at the village entrance in just a few minutes. The bandits turned and fled toward the village entrance on the north side.

Seeing that the battlefield was under control, Li Dong quickly ran to the edge of the gun emplacement and blew the whistle signal agreed upon with the Left Detachment. In just a few minutes, Zhu Si rushed in with his troops.

"How is it?"

"The enemy has fled toward the north village entrance!" Li Dong said, still eager for more. "If we pursue, we can wipe them all out!"

"Good! You take your team and clear the village immediately; I'll lead the troops in pursuit!"

Since the enemy had fled north, Lieutenant Mi's plan was largely accomplished. As long as the fleeing bandits ran out of the village, they would fall into the encirclement of the Fubo Army led by Mi Longtao, with absolutely no way to survive. At this critical moment, Zhu Si naturally wanted to appear "heroic" in front of Mi Longtao and the others.

"Yes!" Li Dong didn't have Zhu Si's intricate thoughts. It just so happened that after marching and fighting all day, his flat feet were hurting terribly. Not going on the pursuit was actually doing him a favor. He immediately accepted the order to clear the remaining bandits in the village.

Li Dong turned back to the gun emplacement. The soldiers of the Right Detachment had stopped fighting, everyone panting heavily—it was less about exhaustion and more about the release after extreme tension.

"Clean up the battlefield! Pay attention to collecting weapons and treating the wounded!"

On the narrow road and beside the gun emplacement lay about forty bandit casualties in disarray. Some were already dead, others were groaning. The soldiers began to clear the bodies. Some were so heavily wounded they were clearly beyond saving, so they were given a mercy strike with daggers.

Walking behind the gun emplacement, Li Dong caught sight of the short bandit he had first cut down. The body was lying face down; Li Pudun and another soldier had turned it over and were groping inside the clothes.

Since the operation was to suppress bandits, who often carried looted wealth, Mi Longtao had ordered that, whether captives or abandoned enemy corpses, they should all be searched if time permitted, and personal wealth confiscated for the public treasury.

The bandit's face, like the others, was smeared with something like pot soot or paint, making it black and blue—intended to scare people. Now, splattered with blood, it looked even more ferocious.

The two soldiers pulled open the clothes, and an extremely thin body was instantly exposed to the setting sun. Li Dong's heart stirred; this bandit's arms were too thin! And the hands were pitifully small.

"Wait!" He stopped the soldiers who were about to lift the body, walked over quickly, looked carefully at the body, then poured water from his canteen onto the corpse's face and wiped it with a rag. The grime instantly came off, revealing a childish face.

Li Dong's heart skipped a beat. The face before him, twisted and pale with fear, undeniably belonged to a boy, at most eleven or twelve years old.

Li Dong came from a humble background. Before coming to Hainan, he had seen seven or eight-year-old kids herding cattle, teenage boys working as laborers, five or six-year-olds stealing on the docks... He had seen it all. But a ten-year-old kid coming out to be a bandit? That was a first.

The two soldiers also sighed. One said, "Someone who hasn't even grown hair coming out to be a 'Great Heaven's Second'? It's a sin!"

"I don't know what's wrong with his parents..."

"What could be wrong? They're dead, probably. No one at home to manage him, so he went down the wrong path? Who from a good family would do this line of work!"

"Is there anything on him?"

"There's a string of cash, five mace of silver, and two changes of clothes in the bundle," Li Pudun said. "And a hairpin—made of wood."

Li Dong looked at the child who had died at his hands, feeling a blockage in his heart—it wasn't guilt. He wasn't as sentimental as the Senators, pitying the old and the poor. He came from poverty and had seen all kinds of ugly and cruel things while struggling at the bottom. Moreover, on the battlefield, swords and guns have no eyes; in a life-or-death situation, there is no room for mercy.

Picking up the hairpin, he remembered the cry of "Ah Ma" just before the boy died. Probably in that moment before death, he thought of his mother. This worthless wooden hairpin was his memento. What kind of disaster had his family encountered? to what extent had life forced him, that he would smear pot soot and paint on his face, pick up a combat saber not much shorter than his own body, roam everywhere, sleep in the wind and dew, and risk his life to be a bandit?

"Becoming a bandit at such a young age, he surely wasn't a kind sort!" another soldier said. "He probably harmed quite a few common folk! His death is deserved."

Li Dong shook his head. "He probably did harm common folk, maybe even killed people. But this isn't his fault..." He couldn't continue, remembering scenes from his childhood while fleeing famine, seeing seven or eight-year-old kids strangling even younger ones for a bowl of porridge outside the gruel shed. "If there is a fault, it's that his parents shouldn't have birthed him into this living hell... Bury the wooden hairpin and clothes with him—so he can find his 'Ah Ma' in the underworld."

After the bodies were cleared, the National Army's casualty figures came out. Although the Right Detachment had advanced like splitting bamboo, they still had two dead and seven wounded in the melee. The Left Detachment had three killed and over a dozen wounded when attacking the village entrance.

"Quick! Send the bandaged heavy casualties to Xugang first," Li Dong urged. Some of the wounded had very severe injuries; if they couldn't be transferred to the field hospital in Fengchuan County seat with the utmost speed, most would not survive.

A dozen captured bandits knelt on the ground, not daring to move. Some of them had minor injuries; Li Dong instructed the medics to bandage them as well, waiting to evacuate them together.

Yang Erdong was somewhat surprised and asked, "Not killing them is courteous enough, but treating their wounds too?"

"What's the use of killing them? Does it make fertilizer?" The medic laughed. "Curd them so they can work for the Senate! You keep talking about others, but didn't you serve as a Ming army house guard yourself?"

Yang Erdong blushed and argued forcefully, "I was a government soldier... Ming army. This bunch are bandits!"

"Bullshit!" someone behind him cursed unceremoniously. "Government soldiers are worse than fucking bandits!"

Yang Erdong was annoyed—it was a fact that government troop discipline wasn't great, but he used to be a house guard, well-paid and fed. He never did things like killing people to claim bounties or raping women. Not willing to accept this insult for nothing, he turned his head to look back.
