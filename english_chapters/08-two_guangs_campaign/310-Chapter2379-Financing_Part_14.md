# Chapter 2379: Financing (Part 14)

Failure to establish wasn't allowed, but total victory and pyrrhic victory were both allowed... Zhou Wei quickly understood Mu Min's meaning. But Zhou Wei had no good solution! Setting the headquarters in Sanya, apart from those high-sounding reasons stated in meetings, was more about buttering up Wang Luobin—to further "fully affirm" the previous Executive Committee's "strategic layout." This had a full effect on easing relations with the big shots.

Moreover, he also knew Liu Xiang wasn't fond of the Industrial Department's proposal to build "Guangzhou Steel" in the Huangpu area, reasoning that "Foshan's metallurgical foundation is better." Zhou Wei understood he was wary of having large state-owned enterprises locally. So he thought placing the headquarters in Sanya should be no problem.

But during his first meeting with Liu Xiang, everything was fine at first. As soon as the topic of headquarters and tax registration came up, Liu Xiang's face immediately fell... If he hadn't publicly announced the headquarters location, or rather, hadn't gone to Wang Luobin to "consult" on the benefits of choosing Sanya, then changing course now would be fine. But who told him to say it first? Now even if he switched to Guangzhou, whether Old Liu would appreciate it was uncertain, but Chairman Wang would definitely be offended!

Now, the Senators who harbored grudges against him had united. How much damage their proposal would do was unknown for now. This Old Liu... Never mind, thinking positively, with his example in front, even if the Senators' joint proposal was a pile of dog shit from start to finish, Old Liu would have to patiently listen carefully.

Sigh, those Senators he accidentally offended were easy to deal with. As long as he, Zhou Wei, was willing to lose face and personally toast and apologize to each one, they couldn't really go for each other's throats!

But Old Liu and his group—what would it take to move the group of Senators stationed in Guangzhou?

Just as Zhou Wei stood in the middle of the room racking his brain, suddenly there was a knock at the door again.

"Hello! There's an encrypted urgent telegram from Lingao, designated for Nanyang Company General Manager Zhou!"

Zhou Wei heard this and broke out in a cold sweat—this... has already reached Lingao?

"What, I heard from the secretary that Chu He came again today?" Zhang Xiaoqi pushed open the dormitory door, hanging up her coat while speaking to Wang Qiyi who was nestled on the sofa reading the newspaper, "Coming to push for results? His efficiency is quite high."

"Not pushing for results. He was looking for me and happened to send our Tax Bureau a proposal, and also CC'd all Senators in Guangzhou." Wang Qiyi replied without looking up.

"Crafted a new proposal again?"

"No. I glanced at the so-called joint proposal chatted up at the tavern—it's just a pile of shit." Wang Qiyi commented without mercy, "Or rather, most of it is shit. Chu He's professional proposal on the Nanyang Company's equity structure and fundraising, plus a basic concept for establishing the Guangzhou Stock Exchange—that's Ren Youzi's proposal. Speaking very politely, saying this is a proposal involving professional aspects, asking us to consider it so he can revise it."

"Oh? Interesting! Clearly saying it's a joint proposal, yet separately distributing the 'professional financial proposal' everywhere. Interesting, truly interesting."

"Others couldn't really say much either. After all, this area is very professional. Our Tax Bureau is relevant, so it's perfectly normal for him to ask us to 'offer some opinions'—besides, whoever makes the final decision on which plan to use, not only can't we decide, even Zhou Wei has to report and request approval."

"That's true. Such a big thing as Southeast Asian development, all handed over to the Nanyang Company? Just saying they're given a policy, don't they still need to coordinate with the Administrative Affairs Yuan for people, money, and materials?" Zhang Xiaoqi said, "I think the people in the Administrative Affairs Yuan are crossing their arms waiting to watch the joke."

"Waiting to watch the joke is certain, but on the other hand. If Zhou Wei can really solve the food and raw materials issue—doesn't need to solve it completely, just make it somewhat better than now—his work in the future will be easier. Right now, you can also see it as the organization testing him..." Wang Qiyi said.

"Didn't you say several big shots in the Administrative Affairs Yuan..."

"Sister Zhang, you're better than me in business matters, but you need to think more about some things." Wang Qiyi wagged his finger, "The Senate's enterprise is still in its rising period. It hasn't degenerated to the point of only looking at butts and not abilities. There are plenty of 'if you're capable, step up' opportunities. As long as you have real skills and can solve problems, the big shots will naturally 'unite' you to their side. Wasn't it the same when we were slacking like Chu He? Later, when the whole Hainan implemented the new tax system, we showed our stuff, and now we're also in the ruling faction, aren't we?"

"Get lost with your ruling faction..." Zhang Xiaoqi laughingly scolded, "If this continues, sooner or later you'll become an official oil-slick like Liu Xiang—I hate this type of person the most."

"Old Liu, well, he's a bit oily, and has quite a few selfish thoughts. But he cares about the country. He doesn't muddle major matters." Wang Qiyi sighed, "Some people say his future goal is the Secretary of State position. I think that's fine!"

"Who do you think you are? You think it's fine, I think you're not fine!"

"Hey hey hey, I'm still quite fine!"

"Listen to me!" Zhang Xiaoqi saw Wang Qiyi about to reach for the newspaper again and slapped his hand.

Wang Qiyi pouted, withdrew his hand, leaned back into the sofa, and mumbled: "Say it then, I'm listening."

"You're quite clear about this. Hey, it's still what I told you last time. You're more familiar with the Senators stationed in Guangzhou than me. You have to help me arrange meetings with all of them. Although I'm not permanently stationed in Guangzhou right now, I'll definitely come often in the future."

"I remember it all. Don't worry. Even if I don't arrange it, with the disaster relief funds in your hands, this god of wealth, they'll come to you themselves."

"That's not good. If the first meeting is about official business, wouldn't it look like your wife doesn't understand social graces? This Chu He..."

Wang Qiyi understood his wife's meaning very well. This Chu He coming to complain was obviously not someone who would stay in the pond. Looking at the current situation, he was likely to become the second "rising star" riding on the Nanyang Company. He waved his hand, "Let's wait and see. Liu Xiang the local snake hasn't specifically spoken yet. We're from central agencies; let's not thrust our hot faces onto cold butts."

"I find it strange. I vaguely remember he volunteered to go teach in Jeju Island, right? By that logic, he shouldn't have such strong ambitions for fame and fortune."

"Haha, you still remember that? Then do you remember during the farewell drinks, he said he was a financial migrant worker, self-deprecating that he wasn't up to important tasks. It made Old Cheng complain for quite a while."

"Ah, now that you mention it, I remember. It's been several years in a blink. Looks like he's finally come around." Zhang Xiaoqi changed the subject, "What do you think of his proposal? What Mayor Liu cares about most is how to collect taxes. He's even asking my opinion."

"What did you say?"

"I said I hadn't seen it yet—anyway, what he writes doesn't have much to do with us. I just said I could offer some ideas on implementation, but for policy, he should look to your opinion."

Hearing Zhang Xiaoqi's words, Wang Qiyi put down the cup in his hand, turned to face his wife directly and asked: "Then speaking objectively, according to his proposal, if we're to come up with a collection method, do you have a general direction?"

"Hey, what's difficult about this." Zhang Xiaoqi smiled proudly, "After scanning his proposal, I had it pretty much figured out. The core of his proposal is control over issuance and premium. In other words, the financial version of a command economy."

Wang Qiyi nodded. His wife was now considering problems more and more comprehensively and deeply. She was no longer like before, limited to technical details. It seemed that managing overall fiscal work was obviously very good training.

Seeing Wang Qiyi not speaking, Zhang Xiaoqi continued:

"Setting those aside, just talking about collection. There's no problem with the issuance stage. Here, the issuing merchant directly pays stamp duty and business tax based on face value. Just add a 'financial products' tax item before implementation. If there are dividends in the future, directly entrust the dividend payer to withhold—we don't have income tax, so using 'financial products gains' as the tax item is fine. These basically have zero collection costs and basically no problems of missed collection or management. Very simple, too simple. But since these stocks and bonds are bearer, they're non-certified transactions (i.e., no third-party or government certification needed), so don't count on taxing the trading stage."

"In the future, if there's registration, can this part be collected?"

"Future? Registration? Hahahaha" Zhang Xiaoqi put her arm on her husband's shoulder, holding his neck and laughing: "Little brother, when you go back to Lingao someday, let your big sister take you to tour the vocational school? Let you see our students, so you won't have such pipe dreams anymore. Do you know the difficulty of a purely manual stock registration system?"

Wang Qiyi sheepishly removed his wife's arm from his neck, "Ah, I didn't say it. It's written in their proposal. I just said these people's understanding of difficulties definitely can't compare to my wife who personally runs the vocational school. They think students come from mitosis. Come to think of it, our Tax Bureau still has cadres from the literacy classes two years ago!"

"That's enough from you," Zhang Xiaoqi rolled her eyes at Wang Qiyi, "Ever since I came in, you've been acting strange. Tell me, what's the deal exactly? Did Chu He offend you?"

"No, I don't have much interaction with him..."

"Mm," Zhang Xiaoqi nodded, listening for Wang Qiyi to continue.

"When I came back, you were already asleep. This morning you left early, and I didn't have time to tell you. The people who went last night weren't many. Everyone also mentioned the Nanyang Company financing matter."

"Mm, go on" Zhang Xiaoqi crossed her legs, sat on the sofa, facing Wang Qiyi.

"Didn't discuss specific business, just talked about visions." Wang Qiyi shook his head with a half-smiling expression, "What do you think Chu He was thinking back then? He turned something that could have been an independent enterprise into something subordinate to the Nanyang Company. Being outside the three realms and not in the five elements, what wouldn't be convenient..."

"That's why, Secretary Zhou seemed cruel to Chu He, but actually did him a great merit. It was like a wake-up call."
