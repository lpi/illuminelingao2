# Chapter 2175 - Yang Juren's Ambition

Under his uncle's "guidance," Yang Erhu was very "incorruptible" as an officer. He never deducted his subordinates' pay and provisions—not only did he not deduct them, but sometimes when his subordinates had urgent difficulties, he would pay out of his own pocket to help. Consequently, the dozens of soldiers under him were grateful to him, and he made many "brothers" in the battalion. They were quite willing to sell their lives for him in battle. On ordinary days, he was willing to spend money to flatter his superiors. After a few years, he actually became a capable officer praised by everyone in the battalion. If the Australians hadn't attacked, he would have been promoted to Squad Leader.

With favor, everything was easy to handle. Cannons, bird guns, gunpowder, and other military equipment from the Zhaoqing Battalion were moved back to his home bit by bit like ants moving house. Later, he became bolder and even brought back some armor, which the Imperial Court strictly forbade private individuals from possessing.

Master Yang was not idle either. He built stockades, organized joint security pledges, and forged weapons. Guangning was not a peaceful place to begin with, and the trend of establishing stockades and training braves was very strong. Because Master Yang's village braves were well-equipped and he had a nephew serving as a military officer, the major households in neighboring villages all fawned over him, electing him as the head of the joint security of the surrounding villages. He became a hegemon in Guangning.

In the battle where Zhu Mingxia attacked Zhaoqing, Yang Erhu's troops routed in confusion after a covering barrage from the mortars on the gunboats before they even engaged the "Hair Rebels." They lost dozens of men, dead or fled. Having witnessed the formidable power of the Hair Rebels, Yang Erhu dared not risk his capital in a desperate fight. Knowing that Zhaoqing was in imminent danger, he took advantage of the chaotic war situation to gather his own troops and take in many routed soldiers. He looted several merchant shops and wealthy households in the city, and fled back to Guangning with valuables and weapons.

Although his return was a sorry sight of thrown-away helmets and abandoned armor, he brought back over two hundred elite soldiers, dozens of suits of armor, and many weapons. The prestige of the Yang Family Village braves was instantly boosted.

The boost in prestige was true, but gaining over two hundred "elite soldiers" out of thin air couldn't be dismissed just by giving them a bowl of rice. Although these grunts were "grateful" to Yang Erhu right now, if they went without pay for a few months, it wouldn't be rare for them to turn their faces and slaughter the Yang Family Village.

Yang Erhu was quite nervous and hurriedly sought his uncle for discussion.

Yang Juren was a well-read scholar and knew deeply that in troubled times, having soldiers made one a Grass King. He sent out invitations far and wide, gathering the gentry, major households, and clan elders of various villages and towns at his village to discuss "countermeasures."

In chaotic times, people were in a constant state of anxiety. Everyone wished for someone to step forward, especially since Yang Jinghui held the title of Provincial Graduate. Once the invitations were sent, more than a dozen local villages sent representatives immediately.

Yang Jinghui had Yang Erhu lead the village braves, "fully equipped with armor and weapons," to line up in front of the village. He also displayed the cannons his nephew had brought from Zhaoqing one by one. After a display of martial power, Yang Jinghui became the leader of the township's Regiment Training Bureau without any suspense. Money and grain were apportioned to every village. Calculated out, not only was it more than enough to support the soldiers, but he also made a significant profit.

"Uncle is truly a master!" Yang Erhu was sincerely convinced.

"Hehe," Yang Jinghui stroked his beard and smiled. "Since ancient times, if you have grain, you have soldiers; if you have soldiers, you have grain. In peaceful times, these soldiers would be a scourge, but right now they are capital. As long as we use this capital well, we can not only keep this area peaceful but also earn double the profit! As long as we adapt to the times and earn more family property to guard this patch of land, no matter who becomes Emperor in the future, this fine family property won't run away."

Yang Jinghui's calculation wasn't bad; he could be said to have figured out the basic laws of dynastic change. Soon, with the collapse of the Great Ming's rule, the social order in the county began to fall into chaos: bandits ran rampant, Yao people rebelled, and locals fought with guest settlers (Hakka). It was a chaotic mess for a time. Yang Jinghui took advantage of this chaos to become a "hero created by the times." His nephew Yang Erhu followed his instructions to "conquer east and west." First, they broke a Hakka village that had fought with Yang Family Village over water rights in the past, killing a hundred or so villagers and swallowing all their land, houses, and valuables. Then they attacked several neighboring villages that "did not obey orders," forcing them all to pay money and grain. As for the villages that had disputed land and mountain fields with Yang Family Village, they were now very "sensible" and obediently handed over their land deeds.

Although the local villages of some scale all trained village braves, their numbers were small and their weapons couldn't compare to the Yang Family Village braves, let alone the core of over two hundred combat soldiers and various firearms the Yangs possessed. Winning every battle effectively, villages everywhere collapsed at the sight of the wind and surrendered.

In this series of "conquests," the Yang Family Village braves also destroyed several small groups of local bandits creating disturbances, annexed and expanded their power, and even seized a mountain stronghold. Yang Jinghui felt that his own village on the plain was not very safe, so he planned to establish a new stockade there as a lair.

In less than a month, Yang Family Village's "prestige spread far and wide." Especially after Yang Erhu led the regiment braves to Shijian Town and forced the town merchants to take out hundreds of taels of silver plus hundreds of bolts of cloth, hundreds of *shi* of grain, and many valuables to "reward" them, many "heroes" within the county came to join one after another. The Yang Family Stockade braves expanded to over eight hundred men, becoming a major power in the county merely like that.

However, the good times didn't last long. Before long, the magistrate appointed by the Hair Rebels arrived at the county seat with the National Army and raised the banner of "Great Song." The official roads and waterways leading to the prefectural city were restored, Senate patrols and gunboats patrolled everywhere, and social order improved. The Hair Rebel County Director also sent former yamen runners to the countryside to inform the villages everywhere, requiring them to "train militia, guard their own villages, and not cross boundaries to cause trouble."

The villages and towns that had suffered from the Yang Family Village's scourge sent people to the Australian Yamen to complain one after another. Before long, the Australian County Yamen sent someone to deliver an invitation, asking Yang Jinghui to "come to the Yamen for a chat."

Yang Jinghui knew that in the current situation, "going to the Yamen for a chat" was impossible—impossible in this lifetime. The only way was to establish a foothold based on strength and force the Hair Rebels to acknowledge the *fait accompli*.

Although the Hair Rebels' firearms were powerful and their ships and cannons were the best in the world, this place was not by the sea and was mountainous. The cannons that could be transported here wouldn't be very large. Moreover, the Hair Rebel soldiers accompanying the County Magistrate to his post numbered no more than a hundred—no matter how capable they were, they couldn't split themselves in two or scatter beans to make soldiers. These hundred or so men were already stretched thin just guarding the county seat and maintaining road traffic. Therefore, he was not afraid of the Hair Rebels' "suppression." Following Master Bi's idea, he used the "delaying" tactic. He wrote a petition with humble words, the content being nothing more than that his family had always been "good citizens" and although they had trained some regiment braves, it was only for self-preservation in chaotic times. He had absolutely no disloyalty toward the Great Song. As for the accusations from various villages, they were pure slander—the stale, rotten disagreements inside had been entangled for generations; they were acts of personal revenge, and the specific reasons couldn't be explained clearly in a short time. Finally, he said he was in poor health and couldn't travel far, so he could only beg the County Magistrate for magnanimity to excuse him from going to the Yamen. If there were any instructions, just send a letter, and he would certainly comply, and so on.

After writing, he asked Master Bi's son, Bi Xuansheng, to deliver it. Although Bi Xuansheng was as good-for-nothing at studying as his old man, his lips were much glibber. He was naturally slippery, knew how to watch the wind to speak, and was young, so presumably, the Hair Rebels wouldn't make things difficult for him.

Aside from the petition, two gifts were prepared. One was pigs, sheep, wine, and cloth, meant to "reward the brothers." The other was three hundred taels of silver and a set of gold head ornaments—this was for the County Director.

Bi Xuansheng went to the county seat but did not bring back a reply letter upon his return. He only brought back the gifts, accompanied by an old yamen runner kept on by the county. With much bowing and scraping and mouthfuls of "sent by superior orders, compelled by necessity," he said the Australian County Magistrate had already spoken: not only must he come to the Yamen for a chat by a set time, but he must also immediately hand over all armor and firearms, retaining only basic swords, spears, and bows. The village Regiment Braves must not exceed two hundred men. Otherwise, they would be deemed an "illegal armed force."

Naturally, Yang Jinghui refused to hand over his capital. Furthermore, the Australians were weak in Guangning, and would likely find a punitive expedition beyond their reach. So he simply ignored it and sat back to watch the changes.

Sure enough, the County Director's arrival didn't immediately reverse the chaotic situation in the county. Although the mixed battles between local and guest villages were temporarily quelled, scattered rogue soldiers combined with bandits continued to cause chaos. Just as the Hair Rebel "Director" of Guangning was busy rebuilding institutions, establishing militia, contacting the four countrysides, and trying to restore social order, envoys carrying Xiong Wencan's handwritten orders sneaked in from Guangxi. These envoys were mostly locals who relied on local social connections to move around, visiting various major households and gentry, inciting them to "serve the Imperial Court" and promising them all kinds of benefits when the Court fought back in the future.

As a local "powerholder," Yang Jinghui naturally received the treatment of a visit from an envoy. Provincial Graduate Yang didn't quite believe these promises—after all, his own nephew had watched how Master Xiong greased the soles of his feet and slipped away from Zhaoqing, and had seen the power of the Hair Rebel shelling. For the Great Ming to fight back, they would need to accumulate troops for at least three to five years—and they might not even win.

However, even if the Great Ming didn't fight back, it didn't mean the Hair Rebels could sit securely on the throne. Even if they could eventually sit securely, it would probably remain chaotic for several years—Provincial Graduate Yang had received a lot of news from friends and relatives fleeing the chaos and knew that bandits were making trouble on both banks of the West River, and the Yao people in Lianshan were also rebelling. Even the situation in this county wasn't necessarily much better.

Taking advantage of this chaotic situation and the capital in his hands, his family could make a huge profit! Yang Jinghui made up his mind and told the envoy that he was willing to "serve the Imperial Court and spill his brains and blood on the ground," only asking Master Xiong to grant a title. The envoy immediately expressed: Master Xiong didn't have much else, but he had plenty of command arrows. At the same time, he hinted that if he could kill a few prominent Fake Aussies in the county or go a step further and recover the county seat—even for just one day—Master Xiong would claim merit for him. With his degree as a Provincial Graduate, he would certainly be directly awarded an official position.

The accumulated prestige of the Great Ming's three hundred years was still there, after all. Listenings to these prospects, Yang Jinghui couldn't help but be beguiled, especially by the four words "awarded an official position," which were particularly moving. He immediately promised he would undertake a great endeavor and "not disappoint Master Xiong's hope."
