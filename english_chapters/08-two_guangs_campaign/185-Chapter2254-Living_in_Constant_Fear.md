# Chapter 2254: Living in Constant Fear

Feng Haijiao couldn't sleep these days.

His old nest, Qinglian Market, was in a commotion of panic and unease. The news of Sun Dabiao’s destruction had been brought here the next day by a few minions who had lost their souls.

At first, Feng Haijiao didn't quite believe it, because Sun Dabiao had a full five or six hundred men there, while the Hair thieves had less than two hundred in total. How dared they go attack Sun Dabiao and not even want the county seat?

However, the minions swore to heaven and earth that everything they said was true, which aroused Feng Haijiao’s vigilance. At daybreak, he sent several astute minions to Dalang Market and the county seat to inquire about news. Unexpectedly, the news brought back was worse one after another. Dalang Market was broken. Spears with the heads of Sun Dabiao’s subordinates were erected all along the road toward the county, totaling more than two hundred. Two large grave mounds were also made at the intersection of Dalang Market, gloomy and chilling, frightening to look at. Sun Dabiao himself and his main subordinate leaders were captured and were now all being "shown to the public" in front of the county yamen. They all looked like they had suffered heavy torture, each one beaten out of human shape.

Although Feng Haijiao and Sun Dabiao secretly had some disagreements, and recently the two sides nearly conflicted over spheres of influence for collecting provisions, they were sworn brothers of many years and knew the principle of "when the lips die, the teeth are cold." The sudden destruction of Sun Dabiao’s gang was tantamount to tolling the death knell over Feng Haijiao’s head.

The sunny spring turned into freezing winter snow in the blink of an eye. Feng Haijiao’s gang, originally arrogant and insufferably supercilious, was now living in constant fear from top to bottom, feeling doomsday was imminent. Not only did the various heroes who used to come in an endless stream to "join the partnership" no longer appear, but even those who had joined were finding various excuses to slip away, and some simply left without saying goodbye.

Feng Haijiao forced himself to be calm. During meetings with his leaders, he even said a few words looking down on Sun Dabiao to show that Sun Dabiao was insignificant to him. However, behind the scenes, he was already in complete chaos. He sent several waves of people to Xin Laonan’s manor to ask Zhan Zhekun for a plan—especially wanting to get a truthful word from his mouth: were the Great Ming government troops coming or not?

However, this word never came. Instead, the news came that Sun Dabiao and others were beheaded and displayed in the county seat.

"Really killed?!" Although Feng Haijiao had long expected Sun Dabiao’s end, hearing this news still shocked him. "Who else?"

"Not a single one of those caught and taken to the county seat remained; all had their heads chopped off. Jiang Xiaotian was also killed—the Hair thieves even killed his old mother and uncle!" The minion who went to inquire about news said in panic, "Sun Dabiao’s son and grandson all had their heads chopped off..."

"This woman is ruthless enough." Feng Haijiao had heard earlier that the new magistrate was a woman. Hearing that she wiped out Sun Dabiao’s family as soon as she started, he couldn't help but add three points of admiration. "Were the other family members also killed?"

"No," the minion said. "I heard people say that for the captured family members of various leaders, any man who was accused by someone would be punished by law—that is, hanged. Other women and children who had places to go could do as they pleased; those with nowhere to go were exiled overseas. Although they said this, the enemies of each family were waiting on the road. Kill one as soon as one comes out, leaving not even chickens or dogs... Now many people would rather go into exile... Sun Dabiao’s wife hanged herself that night..."

"He and his wife never got along well. That she was willing to hang herself for him makes her a chaste and fierce woman!" Feng Haijiao gave a thumbs up. "What about his flock of concubines? Any hanged?"

"Not a single one. They all went back to their natal homes."

"Damn it, what a pity. His Seventh Concubine was a stunner..." Feng Haijiao suddenly had lustful thoughts and slapped his thigh. "Why didn't she come to seek refuge with me!"

"This... perhaps she didn't know the Master admired her?" The minion hurriedly chimed in. "How about the small ones go get her..."

Feng Haijiao thought again: now he himself was in imminent danger. Not to mention concubines, if he were killed by the Hair thieves, his wife might not even be willing to hang herself. He felt dispirited.

Sun Dabiao had called the wind and summoned the rain for decades only to end up like this; Feng Haijiao naturally felt like the fox mourning the death of the rabbit. Moreover, Sun Dabiao's defeat brought more than just this: the wind direction in the county changed instantly. The various powerful households who used to actively associate with him now avoided the people he sent. Exploring provisions, which used to be quite smooth, now became very difficult. Many villages simply refused to pay—even those willing to pay had a pile of words to stall him, either delaying or giving less. It made him very annoyed. Over time, he actually became somewhat strapped for cash.

He also had a big family and business now, gathering nearly five hundred brothers under his command. Just eating cost dozens of *shi* of rice every day. His main income in the past was "living off the river," specializing in extorting and robbing passing passenger and cargo ships. Since the war started in Guangdong, there were few passenger and cargo ships on the Lian River. There were quite a few Australian ships, and Bi Xuansheng had agitated him several times to ambush the Australian fleet, even specially getting him some firearms, but he never had the guts—he was also afraid of fighting hard with the Australians and both sides suffering, letting Sun Dabiao take advantage.

After he raised the banner of the Great Ming, he used this to levy grain and pay in the surrounding areas. After Wang Chuyi failed at Dalang Market, Feng Haijiao had infinite prestige for a time, levying grain and pay on a large scale in the name of the Yangshan Right Wing Squad Leader. For a time, he was infinitely glorious, with gold, silver, money, and grain flowing continuously into his Qinglian Market. Now not only could he not levy grain and pay, but the National Army in the county also strengthened patrols. When teams went out to levy grain, they often encountered patrol teams and would lose a few brothers more or less.

Continuing to drain like this, he would be finished sooner or later. Feng Haijiao suffered in his heart. He discussed with Bi Xuansheng several times, and Bi Xuansheng persuaded him to abandon this place and join forces with Zhan Zhekun at Xin Family Manor—Xin Family Manor was not only remote but also had perilous terrain, conducive to defense.

"Master Yang of Guangning has a mountain stockade not far from Xin Family Manor. If we station troops there, we can coordinate with him."

He trusted the person Xin Laonan. Moreover, this person had limited strength and couldn't possibly play the idea of annexing him—if he were Xin Laonan, he would probably have to guard against Feng Haijiao swallowing him.

But to abandon this "feng shui treasure land" of Qinglian Market where he made his fortune, Feng Haijiao simply couldn't make this determination.

In such a panicked dilemma, Feng Haijiao lived days where eating and sleeping were difficult. He had always been very superstitious. At this moment, he regarded this as a spiritual sustenance even more, burning incense and worshipping gods every day, counting on a "miracle" to fall from the sky that could save him from the critical juncture of destruction.

However, the situation showed no signs of improvement. Fewer and fewer villages were willing to pay money and grain. Conversely, he heard that the large households in the county not only gave the Australians money and grain but also gave them many able-bodied men. Now the female magistrate had strong soldiers and sturdy horses—needless to say, raising so many soldiers and horses, she would deal with him sooner or later.

Feng Haijiao was at his wit's end and had to send Bi Xuansheng to Xin Family Manor again to ask Zhan Zhekun for a plan—in his view, this person with the halo of "Assistant to the Viceroy of Two Guangs" was his last hope.

After Bi Xuansheng left, calculating the journey, he should have returned yesterday. However, he did not go up the mountain as scheduled. Feng Haijiao slept anxiously for a night. The next day, he came out of his own residence, wearing his military officer uniform, and took a few personal guards to inspect his subordinates.

Although Qinglian Market used to be a commercial port, since being occupied by Feng Haijiao, it had become a bandit den with no shops or residents. He originally had no more than a hundred men, so there were not many houses. Since becoming a Squad Leader, the team expanded rapidly, and many people had no place to live. Many bandits could only dwell under thatched sheds. At this moment, sleeping, sitting, gambling, making noise... they were scattered lazily and messily by the river, with absolutely no appearance of a military unit. Even when he walked by, only the minions close to him stood up to welcome him; those further away simply pretended not to see. He looked for a while, recalling the glory when various heroes came to "dock at the pier" when he became Squad Leader, and couldn't help but feel a burst of melancholy. Looking at the military officer uniform on his body: how proud he was when he put it on back then, and his subordinates praised him for having "official prestige." But at this moment, this gorgeous attire seemed to be mocking him—he didn't deserve to wear it at all.

Feng Haijiao asked again if Bi Xuansheng had returned. After getting a negative answer, he became even more lost. He completely forgot his past disdain and guard against Bi Xuansheng, and couldn't help but look forward to his return a moment earlier so they could discuss things.

Seeing the sun turn west and Bi Xuansheng still missing without a trace, Feng Haijiao returned to his residence in disappointment. He ignored the attentive care of his concubine and maids, walked with heavy steps back to his study, sat down on the grand arm chair, then collapsed softly onto the bed, looking up at the old roof, sighing long and short, not saying a word.

Just as the sky turned dark, a maid suddenly shouted outside the door: "Master!"

Feng Haijiao blinked his eyelids twice, gave a soft "mn," but didn't move yet. The maid had to report at the door: "Master Bi has returned..."

Hearing this sentence, Feng Haijiao immediately got his spirit back. He suddenly sat up and said, "Set up a banquet; I want to wash the dust off for Master Bi!"

In an instant, the maids set up a table of wine and food and poured the wine. Feng Haijiao looked at Bi Xuansheng eagerly—his face was dark, travel-worn, obviously having suffered some hardships on the road.

Bi Xuansheng only gave a hurried bow seeing Feng Haijiao, then impatiently went to the banquet table. After sitting down, he didn't stand on ceremony: first grabbed a chicken and gnawed on it. In two or three bites, he tore a chicken clean, then reached out his greasy hand to drink the wine in the cup in one gulp. He said repeatedly: "Pour wine!"

Feng Haijiao hurriedly signaled to pour wine, saying, "Don't rush, there is plenty of wine and meat."

Bi Xuansheng was not polite at all, bowing left and right, eating wine and meat, gorging himself. Only after making a mess of cups and plates on the table did he rest his hands and pant heavily.

Feng Haijiao watched with secret alarm. What exactly had this Bi Xuansheng encountered? To actually end up like a starving ghost reincarnated? And he was almost two full days late compared to the normal journey!
