# Chapter 2349: Old Friend Li Huamei (Part 1)

The group had made their decisions and were about to split up for action when Xu Yanliang remembered something:
"I recall one thing; Li Huamei's file has a special surveillance marker. If we use her temporarily once or twice, there's no problem, but if we plan to reuse her heavily in the future and need her to participate in some important operations, we definitely need to submit an application. It has to be approved by the Political Security Bureau."

"So troublesome? What heinous crime has this Li Huamei committed?" Wang Kai asked with dissatisfaction.

"Since there is this procedure, let's just go through it. I don't think she has anything shameful to hide," Zhou Wei said.

As soon as the correspondence regarding the Nanyang Company's preparation to employ Li Huamei was sent out, the relevant agencies of the Political Security Bureau began to move.

Although Li Huamei had been "naturalized" for more than three years, in the files of the Political Security Bureau, she belonged not only to the "controlled use objects" but also to the "perennial surveillance objects." From the moment she "defected to the Kuns," the Political Security Bureau had established a special personal file for her.

Zhao Manxiong was interested in her not because her name was Li Huamei, but because he had always suspected a connection between Li Huamei and Li Siya.

It wasn't too hard to make such an association: Macao was very small and couldn't accommodate too many female pirates.

In the 17th century, extremely few women drifted on the sea. In the entire East Asia, including Southeast Asia, one probably couldn't find more than one or two female captains. Although Li Siya was only a mixed-race woman of Chinese and Portuguese descent, her fame had spread throughout the ports of East Asia, and she was known even in distant Goa, India.

Li Huamei, however, was different. The Political Security Bureau sent people specifically to Macao to investigate Li Huamei's situation. Surprisingly, no one knew of such a female pirate. No one had even heard of the *Hangzhou*. Added to the bizarre coincidence of Li Huamei and the *Hangzhou*, Zhao Manxiong and his subordinates had to highly suspect that this was not accidental, but some kind of inevitability—someone knew about the "Age of Exploration complex" within the Senate.

But, since this person knew the Senate had an "Age of Exploration complex," why did they deliberately use this combination? Wasn't this equivalent to telling everyone: "I have information sources from the old spacetime"?

Things having reached this stage, the Political Security Bureau further suspected that there were other people from the old spacetime behind Li Huamei. The first to bear the brunt of suspicion was naturally Black.

Since Black's name became known to the Senate, the Political Security Bureau shifted the focus of their investigation on Li Huamei to the connection between her and Black—naturally, they wasted their efforts. There were no clues to prove that Li Huamei had any contact with Black, and intelligence from Manila confirmed this point.

The only thing in Li Huamei's activities that aroused their interest was her romantic history with Qi Feng. Out of reasonable consideration, Zhou Botao naturally thought of the possibility of a "honey trap."

Although Li was a pirate and a rare independent woman in this spacetime, under the social customs of the 17th century, suddenly launching such an active pursuit of Senator Qi was obviously illogical...

Zhou Botao had suggested informing Qi Feng of Li Huamei's "suspicious" status, but Zhao Manxiong thought this was inappropriate.

"If we tell him, he might think we are trying to interfere in his emotional problems—we can't be that bad guy. Even if Li Huamei turns out to be a spy in the end, Qi Feng will vent his resentment on us."

"If we don't tell him, just in case this Li Huamei does something detrimental to the Senator..."

"Let's do a routine 'notification'," Zhao Manxiong said. "Didn't Qi Feng apply to go to Qiongshan?"

"Yes, he said he wanted to inspect the supply of building materials in Qiongshan. He also applied for an inspection ship—the *Hangzhou*."

"Good. Use this as a reason to send him a memo explaining that Li Huamei has been naturalized for a short time and her historical issues cannot be verified at present, so she belongs to 'controlled use objects.' Suggest that he not take the *Hangzhou*—if he insists on taking it, ask him to bring more security personnel." Zhao Manxiong said, "Then attach a reply slip and ask him to reply after confirmation."

The memo was sent, and Qi Feng's relevant reply was received, stating that he was already aware of the situation but did not plan to change his travel plans. He thanked them for the reminder and said he would increase the security level.

After receiving the reply, Zhao Manxiong instructed Zhou Botao to plant members of the "Committee of Ten" around Li Huamei and on the *Hangzhou*.

"According to the rules, at least half of the *Hangzhou*'s crew must be replaced after retraining. It's very easy to mix sand in. You must find a way to develop informants among the old crew members remaining on the ship. In addition, there must be someone arranged by Li Huamei's side."

"Understood! She newly accepted a little black slave girl, who looks like she's from East Africa. She is currently undergoing purification in the purification camp. Li seems to like her very much; we can start with her."

Thus, she was added to the long-term surveillance list, accumulating surveillance reports continuously. However, in several years, no useful intelligence was obtained. This was the first time Zhao Manxiong and his subordinates encountered such a predicament. They clearly knew Li Huamei's origin was suspicious, and it could even be said she came to "naturalize" with ulterior motives, but they couldn't find any suspicious points about her.

"If she is a spy, then she must be a dormant spy," Zhao Manxiong said. "Let's just keep a good eye on her."

Since there was no further evidence that Li Huamei was harming the Transmigration Enterprise, she continued to live her little life and dream her little spring dreams as a surveillance target and a lead for counter-espionage work.

It wasn't until more than a year later that Qi Feng first submitted an application to marry Li Huamei—according to the rules, for a Senator to marry a naturalized citizen or a native, they had to apply to the General Office of the Senate, and the General Office would instruct the Political Security Bureau to conduct a relevant background investigation.

Wang You's news was not quite accurate. Strictly speaking, Li Huamei was not yet Qi Feng's wife. Although the two were already cohabiting and Qi Feng introduced her as his "wife," the Senate had not yet formally approved this marriage.

As a result, the background investigation on Li Huamei was put back on the agenda. This time, the Political Security Bureau quickly discovered new clues.

The Senate's power along the coast of Guangdong was increasing day by day, and the Portuguese had to rely on their breath. The result was that the Senate's influence in Macao became extremely great, and the channels for obtaining intelligence also became smooth. coupled with the significant advancement of the Senate's photography technology, the Macao Station of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau soon sent news: Li Huamei's photo had been recognized.

The information was provided by the Portuguese. Among the Portuguese in Macao, Li Huamei was not a mysterious figure. Intelligence showed: her real name was Li Chun. More than one Portuguese pointed out that Li Huamei was the "maid" or "follower" who had constantly followed Li Siya. Moreover, the time Li Chun disappeared from Li Siya's side coincided with the time Li Huamei "naturalized."

In this way, the long-term suspicion of Zhao Manxiong and others finally had a definite answer: Li Huamei was indeed a person from Li Siya's group.

After opening this breakthrough, the many surveillance materials originally accumulated were instantly connected. Their understanding of Li Huamei also reached a new level. Zhou Botao immediately ordered an investigation into the "Li Huamei-Li Siya Case."

Li Huamei held a position in the Southeast Asia Company and went to sea all year round. After returning to Lingao, she was in a semi-cohabiting state with Qi Feng. In this case, upgrading the surveillance on her was tantamount to monitoring the Senator himself, and it was also his quite sensitive private life. Zhou Botao felt it was very tricky.

Since there were many inconveniences in Lingao, Zhou Botao focused his efforts on the times she went to sea. Without a doubt, Li Huamei had to contact Li Siya regularly. At present, they had intercepted and inspected all letters mailed to her from outside and found no suspicious points.

Then her only chance to contact Li Siya was when she was overseas, especially when docked in Macao.

Hard work paid off. After a few months of monitoring, they quickly intercepted letters between Li Siya and Li Huamei. Some of these letters were in Macao, and more were transited through Indian merchants in Goa.

However, the content of the letters disappointed them greatly. The letters between the two Lis were less like communications between spies and more like business correspondence between a boss and a sales manager.

In the letters, Li Huamei reported the cargo load of each voyage and the profit situation after sales, various account transactions, and the demand for goods and price trends at each port of arrival. At the same time, there was also the situation of merchant ships from various countries arriving and leaving ports. Li Siya's letters were mostly ordering her to purchase or transport certain goods, instructing her to make payments or collect debts in certain places. Sometimes she would also provide various information to her. It seemed that the two were exchanging commercial intelligence.

Similar letters were common in the archives of the British, Dutch, and other East India Companies in the 17th to 19th centuries. There was no content particularly worth noting.

Of course, if Li Siya's main activity was robbery, then this intelligence would be of great use. But ships flying the Senate's flag had never been attacked by Li Siya. As for her attacking merchant ships of other countries, that had nothing to do with the Senate. Moreover, there had been very little news of the *Lotus*'s operations in recent years.

If there was anything related to the Senate, it was that the letters would mention the Senate's current personnel changes and military movements. Li Siya also often asked her to provide certain specific news. But to put it bluntly, this news was all public information that anyone in Lingao could collect with a little attention.

Judging solely from the content of the letters, the activities between the two Lis did not touch upon the Senate's interests, nor could they be said to be harmful.

Of course, both the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and the Political Security Bureau knew that Li Siya had played a role in multiple incidents against the Senate. She was well-deserving of the title "Enemy of the Senate." If it were in the past, the reason of merely having lose contact with Li Siya would have been enough to secretly arrest and interrogate Li Huamei or Li Chun.
