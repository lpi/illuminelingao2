# Chapter 2271: Rough Plan Formed

As a member of the Aftermath Bureau, Luo Yangming understood the current situation in Wuzhou better than anyone. The grain shortage was secondary; the real problem was the interruption of trade—and until Guangxi was taken, this deadlock would persist.

Wuzhou's prosperity had always depended entirely on trade. Without it, many city residents had fallen into unemployment. To stabilize the situation, Xie Erren had forbidden shops from closing or laying off workers, even forcing them to open for business daily under the guise of "maintaining market appearances."

Luo Yangming understood the Senator's predicament—this was about maintaining stability. But it was a fragile stability, sustained only by constant transfusions from the Senate and the Aftermath Bureau.

The merchants had already been tormented once by Xiong Wencan. After Xie Erren entered the city, the aftermath measures had consumed substantial money and grain. Combined with soaring prices, both inside and outside Wuzhou's walls, the common people—apart from the homeless surviving on relief—were all nursing grievances. Luo Yangming saw it clearly and it filled him with anxiety.

Yet the Senate in Wuzhou, for all its skills and clever strategies, could not solve this fundamental problem. For now, all they could do was hold things together and wait for the situation to improve.

The two men discussed the remaining details before Zhu Fuyuan took his leave.

"...Will you be returning to Sanshui right away, or..."

"I'll need to stay in Wuzhou for a few more days," Zhu Fuyuan said. "I'm lodging at Maoyuan Inn in the west of the city."

Luo Yangming understood that Zhu Fuyuan almost certainly had other assignments. It would be inappropriate to ask further, so he simply saw the man out.

In the account room, Yi Haoran was going through the ledgers, but his mind was occupied with the visitor from Dachang Rice Shop. Setting aside the Hair thief connections of the rice shop, since it was a rice shop, its business was naturally grain. This Boss Zhu's visit was probably related to that.

Speaking of grain—Yi Haoran knew that Wuzhou was currently short on supplies, and public sentiment in the markets was volatile. Zhu Fuyuan's arrival was most likely connected to this crisis.

Could it be that the Hair thieves had made major progress on the Guangxi front? Yi Haoran's heart suddenly lurched. Xiong Wencan was in desperate straits. Even if he could immediately recover Wuzhou, the Imperial Court would probably never forgive him for losing the territory. Could it be that Viceroy Xiong had surrendered in desperation?!

Upon reflection, it was not impossible. Yi Haoran had studied the *Records of Military Geography* thoroughly and knew well that Wuzhou was not only the gateway to Guangdong but also one of Guangxi's vital strategic points. Communication between the Xijiang basin and the interior depended primarily on the water transport route through Wuzhou, Lijiang, Lingqu Canal, and on to Hunan. After the Fubo Army occupied Wuzhou, they had effectively severed the main artery connecting interior Ming forces with Guangxi Ming forces. Although a few alternative routes from the interior to Guangxi existed, none could match this water route for convenience and economy. If the Guangxi Ming forces could not recover Wuzhou, even an army of a hundred thousand would be trapped in Guangxi, unable to move.

With both his personal future and Guangxi's prospects looking hopeless, if Xiong Wencan was unwilling to take his own life in martyrdom, surrender was the only path left.

Yi Haoran's heart clenched. If that were true, the Two Guangs would be beyond salvation!

Yet he was powerless to affect Xiong Wencan's movements or the overall situation. A wave of intense frustration washed over him. Even if he possessed divine strategies and brilliant calculations, even if he could kill one True Australian—what help would that be to the larger cause?

At this thought, irritation rose unbidden within him. Then a sudden idea struck. He had long heard Chang Qingyun say that the status of True Australians was incomparably noble, even more exalted than the Qinwang princes of Daming—after all, the princes could not interfere in politics, while Australian True Senators wielded real administrative and deliberative power. If he could capture a True Australian alive in Wuzhou and take him to Guangxi, the Hair thieves would surely hesitate, like a marksman afraid to shoot a rat sitting on a precious vase. Whether the Imperial Court chose to fight or negotiate, they would at least have a bargaining chip in hand.

Capturing a True Australian alive—anyone else would think this pure fantasy. Though Xie Erren did not live in complete seclusion, his guards were tight. Ever since Cai Lan's assassination attempt, he knew he was not universally beloved. Not only had he drastically reduced his outings, but each excursion was now accompanied by multiple guards.

Yet Yi Haoran felt there was an opportunity. He had already established a connection to Cai Lan through Jiang Qiuchan.

Although Jiang Qiuchan knew nothing of his intentions, and he himself was uncertain of Cai Lan's current mindset, this connection gave him eyes and ears that could reach directly to Xie Erren's side.

To proceed, however, he would need to bring Qiuchan into the scheme. He could not approach Cai Lan himself, nor could he divine her thoughts from a distance.

At this realization, he felt a moment's hesitation. After all, this was an extremely dangerous endeavor. Regardless of success or failure, the Australians would inevitably investigate afterward. He, Jiang Suo, and the others could simply flee, but Qiuchan could not escape—she would almost certainly lose her life.

He pondered the matter repeatedly before finally raising his head.

*Never mind!* Though Qiuchan's situation was pitiable, her husband was dead and she had already provided heirs for his family. She was a woman who had lost her chastity; now, given the chance to demonstrate loyalty to the Imperial Court, she would not lack for posthumous honors and commendation... This glory after death would be sufficient compensation.

With this thought, Yi Haoran felt immediately at ease. Jiang Qiuchan was, in fact, an ideal candidate. She was educated, a woman who understood reason and knew shame. Whether it was her near-violation or her husband's death, both tragedies stemmed from the Hair thieves' siege of the city. And her composure in expecting the retreating soldiers back then showed she was calm and collected, not timid or easily frightened. Not to mention he had saved her life—and yes, Chang Qingyun had saved her as well.

If he could appeal to her with great righteousness, to avenge both national hatred and family grudge, she could surely be persuaded.

"Old friend, I'll have to trouble you today." Yi Haoran was dressed as an accountant making rounds to collect debts in the countryside, as usual.

Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly. "Still 'old friend'? I'm practically becoming an old ghost." Seeing Yi Haoran's grizzled beard and self-righteous air, he couldn't help cursing inwardly—how had he gotten mixed up with such a madman! Not content to seek death himself, the man insisted on dragging someone else along for the ride!

"Old friend, that's an ungrateful way to speak." Yi Haoran was unfazed. "Back in the city, if I hadn't pulled you from death's door, you would have died at the hands of the Wolf Troops long ago. How could you still be here, living peacefully as a clerk?"

"Fine, fine, it's all my fault." Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly again. "The Sanheui was a parade ground in the past. Now it's an Australian captive camp. Besides people and houses, what's there to see?"

"Sanheui is the key lock outside Wuzhou city. Naturally, I want to take a good look." Yi Haoran said, "You just lead the way."

After Yi Haoran had brought Chang Qingyun under his control, his first demand was to be guided to the Sanheui parade ground. In Yi Haoran's view, the Sanheui captive camp was the Australians' greatest vulnerability. A place where several thousand people were gathered, only a few *li* from Wuzhou—if a riot broke out, it could immediately threaten Wuzhou and endanger the Xijiang waterway.

The Australians presumably recognized this themselves, which was why their first priority after entering the city had been repairing the floating bridge. In case of emergency, they could quickly dispatch troops to restore order.

"I can take you in, but you must follow my instructions. Don't speak out of turn or act rashly—it would arouse suspicion." Chang Qingyun said helplessly. "On the Sanheui side, the Australians have a National Army company on guard duty. That's not much concern—they only manage the perimeter and ignore internal matters entirely. But inside the camp, there's also a Detective Team. That lot are mostly veteran scoundrels from the old yamen, with sharp eyes and black hearts. If they catch a whiff of something wrong, they'll sell you out in a heartbeat!"

"I understand," Yi Haoran nodded.

"It's just that your identity is awkward..."

"No matter. I'll go in using my real identity as a rice shop accountant. Many people in Wuzhou city know me; making up an identity would be more likely to arouse suspicion."

"What reason will you give for entering?"

"How about visiting to reminisce about old times with you?"

"Absolutely not! That won't work!" Chang Qingyun waved his hands frantically. His eyes rolled as a thought struck him. "Old Yi, didn't your employer supply military provisions for the government troops in Wuzhou back then?"

"Every local grain merchant did," Yi Haoran said. He had heard Li Wensheng and the Madam discuss this many times. The Luo family and other grain merchants in the city had all suffered heavy losses and bore deep hatred for Xiong Wencan and his government.

"Then you should know who specifically handled those transactions, right?"

Yi Haoran naturally knew. Ding A-tao had cursed that man's name, wishing him "a bad death," thousands of times.

"I know who it was. But although his fate is unknown, as one of Governor Xiong's trusted aides, he probably fled long ago..."

"That's just it. Since you're an accountant, just say you heard this person was captured by the Australians and you've come specifically to collect a debt he owes."

Yi Haoran paused, then clapped his hands and laughed. "Old friend! You do have a certain devilish cleverness!"

"Please, please," Chang Qingyun sneered. "When you're nearly a ghost, you have to be somewhat clever." He added, "Getting you in is easy enough. Just adapt to circumstances once inside, and absolutely don't ruin things!" He asked again, "Do you have gifts prepared for greasing palms?"

"Gifts? I heard the Australians don't practice that sort of thing..."

"The Australians don't, but the stewards and petty officials holding power inside are all local yamen scoundrels. I'm taking you in on the sly—if we don't offer some bribes, they'll definitely make trouble."

"Old friend thinks of everything. I did bring some silver."

"I'll let you know when it's needed; just follow the usual customs."

Having settled the details, the two crossed the floating bridge and headed toward the Sanheui parade ground.

Sanheui was originally a sandbar deposited by the Gui River. After Wuzhou became the seat of the Viceroy of Two Guangs, the need to "pacify the Yao" required a large standing garrison. A parade ground was established at Sanheui, convenient for reviewing and training the troops and serving as the main camp for the local garrison. Thousands of soldiers were stationed there year-round.

The site thus contained not only a martial arts hall, a grand review platform, and a parade ground, but also numerous barracks and living facilities. After the Australians occupied Wuzhou, this location became the primary captive camp for the Guangxi front. Prisoners transported from various locations were gathered here for detention and transit.

Given the limited resources at Xie Erren's disposal, he naturally could not manage the captive camp with any thoroughness or attention to detail. He could only rely on surrendered personnel to "self-manage"—maintaining order, distributing rations, organizing labor, and so forth—all under the supervision of former clerks experienced in prefectural and county administration. Internal security was handled by retained personnel, primarily former Fast Class and Strong Class yamen runners.
