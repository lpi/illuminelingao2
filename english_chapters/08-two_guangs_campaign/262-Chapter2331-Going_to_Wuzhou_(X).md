# Chapter 2331 - Going to Wuzhou (X)

They asked a few more questions, and Zheng Ergen answered them one by one. Finally, Chen Baibin expressed there were no more questions. Ji Xin asked: "Where were you employed before coming to Wuzhou?"

"Worked as Deputy Director in Sanya Police Bureau," Zheng Ergen answered.

"That must have been for quite some time?"

Zheng Ergen was somewhat surprised, *how did this Chief know?* He looked at Ji Xin again, feeling somewhat familiar, but couldn't say when he had seen him.

"I went when Sanya was just developed." Zheng Ergen seemed to be reminiscing about those arduous years, shaking his head, "At that time went to be deputy station chief, five people including me."

After Zheng Ergen left, Chen Baibin said: "This person looks like nothing much, feels like a person turning according to the baton. Estimate he knows some situations, but doesn't master key things."

"This person was originally a policeman of Dongmen City Police Station." Ji Xin said, "If I remember correctly, should be a trainee of the first police training class. After the Maid Revolution, I went to Dongmen City Police Station and interrogated the policemen on duty that night one by one."

"Your memory is really good! Still remember such distant things!"

"Impossible not to remember, because after Dugu called people to distribute guns at that time, he was the first to stand out and refuse." Ji Xin said, "He was the only one who remembered the regulations firmly. That night's matter didn't turn uncontrollable, this Zheng Ergen had merit."

"He even had such a glorious past?" Chen Baibin was somewhat surprised, "Looks just like a yes-man grassroots cadre. Ability not so standard either."

"His advantage is being a yes-man. You say he has any consciousness, not necessarily, but if regulations say cannot do, he won't do. This counts as a rare advantage too." Ji Xin said, "I wondered why he disappeared not long after, turned out transferred to Sanya." Ji Xin sighed, "No wonder he is more cautious now."

"Just came out of Sanya, encountering Wuzhou's mess again, this Zheng Ergen's brain must be hurting."

"Small character's fate is just drifting with the waves, nothing much to say." Ji Xin said, "We just try not to let them suffer collateral damage."

Chen Baibin saw him falling into deep thought and didn't disturb him. Seeing his brows gradually unfolding after a good while, only then asked: "Director Ji, who and what matters do you think we need to investigate next?"

"Speaking of relatively key figures, there is also Da Xinxuan—according to existing materials, Jiang Qiuchan going to Cai Lan's side as a companion woman was his recommendation. But honestly speaking, this person won't have much juice." Ji Xin said, "However, you better ask, forming a written record is better."

So they interrogated Da Xinxuan again. Sure enough as Ji Xin said, Da Xinxuan knew nothing about the specific situation. He recommended Jiang Qiuchan purely because of her brother Jiang Rongxian's relationship. After all, Jiang Qiuchan lost her husband and was trapped in Wuzhou with nowhere to turn to, needing to find a livelihood. Avoiding Jiang Rongxian's wife nagging every day, disliking this widow and orphan "eating free rice".

They delayed in Wuzhou for a few days, interrogating all relevant personnel still in Wuzhou, including Qian Duo. Forming nearly a hundred written records. Some records seemed simply unnecessary to Chen Baibin, but Ji Xin was meticulous, doing it once according to process.

However, until now, Chen Baibin hadn't heard any explanation from Ji Xin regarding the investigation conclusion of the case. Of course, he already knew Ji Xin's case-handling thought process from fragments of words during the investigation.

Actually analyzing his thinking wasn't hard. Chen Baibin knew: Ji Xin valued the Senate first; he wouldn't let anything harmful to it exist. Secondly was maintaining the rights of naturalized citizens and indigenous people. Under the Senate's governance, open trampling and plundering of rights of naturalized citizens and indigenous people were rare, but many Senators in the Senate were not so. Inevitably there would be similar things. Ji Xin wanted to prevent such things from happening as much as possible.

Combining these two lines of thought, what direction the final report led by Ji Xin would be written in was vaguely clear. It was just that in details, there were still too many places Chen Baibin felt unable to justify. What exactly did Ji Xin prepare to use to round it up? He was extremely curious.

A few days later, the reply from Teng County also arrived, explicitly stating they never received the external investigation letter about "Hao Ran" sent from Wuzhou. And complying with their request, the Teng County side investigated Jiang Qiuchan's husband's family situation, proving Jiang Qiuchan's identity and narration of relevant events were true and reliable. Also learned that neither her close nor distant relatives had "Hao Ran" or "Yi Haoran". In addition, Jiang Qiuchan's in-laws said Jiang Qiuchan and son didn't return to Teng County, currently whereabouts unknown.

"These are all known things, no juice..." Chen Baibin said, "Pity let Jiang Qiuchan run away! Don't know if it's truth!"

"It would be strange if there was juice. Jiang Qiuchan is already not very meaningful to us now." Ji Xin said, "Our work is about done too, should write the conclusion. But before writing, there is one last person to interrogate."

"Who?"

"Of course it's Xie Erren." Ji Xin said, "He is the party concerned."

The next day, they interviewed Xie Erren.

Xie Erren seemed to have a well-thought-out plan for this interview, calm and composed when meeting and greeting. After taking seats, Ji Xin first asked some questions regarding Wuzhou's work situation. Xie Erren also answered one by one crisply. Preheating finished, Ji Xin asked:

"You encountered an assassination when visiting Dragon Mother Temple, was there such a thing?"

"There was such a thing." Xie Erren's expression became slightly grave, "So dangerous at that time!"

"Do you know the assassin's name?"

"Know, called Cai Lan." Xie Erren said, "Later I kept her in San Zong Fu to do some odd jobs."

These words directly blocked a series of subsequent interrogations. Chen Baibin had to ask the vital question directly.

"A person like Cai Lan is obviously very dangerous. According to relevant regulations, even if you are unwilling to hand her over to the military court or other judicial institutions for disposal, at least should hand over to the prisoner camp, treated as a prisoner. Why did you retain this person?"

"Because she painted well." Xie Erren said, "I just needed such a person in literature and propaganda..."

"Since she was retained personnel, there should be relevant work records—such as drafts and the like."

"There are all these, all these." Xie Erren had a plan ready, "But the riot that night destroyed quite a few materials, not sure if still complete..."

"Someone reported that the relationship between you and Cai Lan was not work relationship. She actually became your life secretary—is there such a thing?"

"Of course she wasn't my life secretary. To be a life secretary requires registration in the General Office. Cai Lan didn't have one." Xie Erren equivocated.

"Alright. We change a way of saying. Between Cai Lan and you, did a relationship between man and woman exist?"

"This, yes." Xie Erren spread his hands helplessly, "I am a man... made a mistake all men would make... I know this is wrong, but at that time couldn't control myself for a moment, sigh!"

"After having such a special relationship between you and her, did you give her corresponding special care? Please answer truthfully."

"That naturally there was. I'm not Pan An..." Xie Erren said with a tone of helplessness, "I arranged residence for her, food was also following me eating from the small stove. Also found someone to serve her—Jiang Qiuchan was too... didn't expect to be utilized by the enemy!"

Chen Baibin was slightly surprised, not expecting this Xie Erren to admit so readily. He glanced at Ji Xin; Ji Xin didn't say a word.

"Do you know how the enemy specifically utilized her?"

"This I am not clear."

"Then how do you know?"

"She was captured on the spot by my Security Secretary."

This statement was exactly the same as in his report, obviously carefully considered.

"According to Luo Yangming and Zhao Fengtian's statements, you once prepared to send a letter to Teng County to investigate Yi Haoran's situation—but Teng County side didn't receive the external investigation letter. How do you explain?"

"Maybe it was burned on the night of the riot."

"From you proposing this matter to the riot, about two weeks. Would an external investigation letter be delayed so long?"

"This is hard to say. I have many things to do, many documents to read and sign. Sometimes careless, pressing it underneath, it would be left unprocessed for a long time too—this is a mistake in my work."

This was inevitably somewhat forced arguing, but in terms of human witness and physical evidence, Chen Baibin had no powerful evidence to prove he was lying. Could only skip over.

Chen Baibin asked some more questions. Xie Erren answered one by one. But regarding the relationship between him and Cai Lan, he consistently insisted on the previous statement. Denying everything else.

Ji Xin didn't say a word during the entire conversation process, only listening carefully to their dialogue. Until the conversation ended, only then did he let out a long breath.

"This Xie Erren, really ghostly!" Chen Baibin said, "Refusing to speak about the external investigation letter to death."

"This precisely illustrates a point." Ji Xin said, "Cai Lan has a huge connection with this mysteriously vanished external investigation letter."

"You mean..."

"Correct," Ji Xin nodded, "He and Cai Lan cohabited in this courtyard. The wing room over there was obviously one of his offices. Imagine, as Cai Lan, did you have the opportunity to enter the office and contact the documents inside?"

"Opportunities were plenty."

"That's right." Ji Xin said, "Although we have no direct evidence, it seems extremely likely now that Cai Lan extracted and destroyed the external investigation letter."

"Why was he only willing to admit the relationship with Cai Lan, but kept secretive about this matter?"

"Man-woman relationship with Cai Lan doesn't count as a big matter—of course, it is, but the nature is relatively much lighter—the latter is a matter of principle... So he had to choose the lesser of two evils." Ji Xin said, "His relationship with Cai Lan is known to all in Wuzhou. Whether Zhao Fengtian or ordinary naturalized cadres, soldiers, and even local natives, hundreds and thousands know. Even if he has ability as big as heaven, he cannot cover it up."
