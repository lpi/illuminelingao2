# Chapter 2331 - Going to Wuzhou (X)

They asked a few more questions, each answered in turn. Finally, Chen Baibin indicated he had nothing further. Ji Xin spoke up: "Where were you posted before coming to Wuzhou?"

"I served as Deputy Director at Sanya Police Bureau," Zheng Ergen replied.

"For quite some time, I imagine?"

Zheng Ergen was surprised. *How does this Chief know?* He studied Ji Xin more closely, finding something vaguely familiar about him, though he couldn't place when they might have met.

"I went when Sanya was just being developed." Zheng Ergen seemed to be reminiscing about those difficult years, shaking his head. "I was sent as deputy station chief. Five people total, including myself."

After Zheng Ergen left, Chen Baibin said, "This man doesn't seem particularly capable—the type who just follows orders. I'd estimate he knows some things, but nothing crucial."

"He was originally a policeman at Dongmen City Police Station," Ji Xin said. "If I remember correctly, he was a trainee from the first police training class. After the Maid Revolution, I went to Dongmen City Police Station and interrogated every officer on duty that night."

"Your memory is remarkable! You still remember things from so long ago!"

"Impossible to forget. When Dugu ordered weapons distributed that night, Zheng Ergen was the first to stand up and refuse." Ji Xin paused. "He was the only one who remembered the regulations clearly. The fact that things didn't spiral completely out of control that night—Zheng Ergen deserves credit for that."

"He has such a distinguished past?" Chen Baibin was surprised. "He comes across as nothing more than a yes-man grassroots cadre. Not particularly competent either."

"Being a yes-man is precisely his advantage. I wouldn't say he has any special awareness, but if regulations say something can't be done, he won't do it. That's actually a rare quality." Ji Xin's voice grew thoughtful. "I wondered why he disappeared not long after—turns out he was transferred to Sanya." He sighed. "No wonder he's become so cautious now."

"Fresh out of Sanya and straight into this mess in Wuzhou. Zheng Ergen's head must be splitting."

"Such is the fate of minor figures—drifting wherever the current takes them. Nothing much to be said." Ji Xin's tone softened. "We can only try to ensure they don't become collateral damage."

Chen Baibin saw him fall into deep contemplation and didn't disturb him. After a long while, when Ji Xin's brow finally unfurrowed, Chen Baibin asked, "Director Ji, which people and matters do you think we should investigate next?"

"Among the relatively key figures, there's also Da Xinxuan—according to existing materials, he recommended Jiang Qiuchan to become Cai Lan's companion. But honestly, there's no juice to squeeze from him." Ji Xin considered. "Still, you should question him and create a formal record."

So they interrogated Da Xinxuan. As Ji Xin predicted, Da Xinxuan knew nothing of substance. He had recommended Jiang Qiuchan purely because of her brother Jiang Rongxian's connections. After all, Jiang Qiuchan was a widow stranded in Wuzhou with no prospects, needing to find a livelihood—and constantly enduring her brother's wife's complaints about the widow and orphan "eating free rice."

They remained in Wuzhou for several more days, interrogating every relevant individual still in the city, including Qian Duo. Nearly a hundred formal statements were recorded. Some of these seemed entirely unnecessary to Chen Baibin, but Ji Xin was meticulous, insisting on following proper procedure.

Throughout this process, however, Chen Baibin heard no indication from Ji Xin regarding his conclusions about the case. Of course, from fragments of conversation during the investigation, he could already discern the general direction of Ji Xin's thinking.

Analyzing it wasn't difficult. Chen Baibin understood that Ji Xin's first priority was the Senate itself—he would permit nothing that could harm it. Second came protecting the rights of naturalized citizens and indigenous people. Under the Senate's governance, blatant violations of these rights were rare, but many Senators held different views. Incidents were inevitable. Ji Xin wanted to prevent such occurrences wherever possible.

Combining these two principles, the general direction of Ji Xin's final report was becoming clear. But in the details, there were still too many points Chen Baibin couldn't see how to justify. What exactly did Ji Xin plan to use to smooth everything over? He was intensely curious.

A few days later, the reply from Teng County arrived. It stated explicitly that they had never received any inquiry letter about "Hao Ran" from Wuzhou. In compliance with their request, Teng County had investigated Jiang Qiuchan's husband's family circumstances, confirming that her identity and account of events were truthful and reliable. They also confirmed that neither close nor distant relatives of the family included anyone named "Hao Ran" or "Yi Haoran." Additionally, Jiang Qiuchan's in-laws reported that she and her son had not returned to Teng County; their current whereabouts were unknown.

"All of this we already knew—nothing new," Chen Baibin said. "Pity Jiang Qiuchan escaped. Who knows whether any of this is even true!"

"It would be strange if there were anything new. Jiang Qiuchan is no longer particularly relevant to us anyway." Ji Xin said, "Our work here is essentially finished. It's time to write the conclusion. But before we do, there's one final person to interrogate."

"Who?"

"Xie Erren, of course. He's the central figure."

The next day, they interviewed Xie Erren.

The Senator appeared to have prepared thoroughly for this conversation, calm and composed throughout the introductions and pleasantries. After they were seated, Ji Xin began by asking several questions regarding the general situation of work in Wuzhou. Xie Erren answered each one crisply. Once this preliminary warming was complete, Ji Xin asked:

"You encountered an assassination attempt while visiting Dragon Mother Temple—is that correct?"

"It is." Xie Erren's expression grew slightly grave. "It was an extremely close call."

"Do you know the assassin's name?"

"Yes—Cai Lan." Xie Erren said, "Afterward, I kept her at San Zong Fu to perform various tasks."

This statement preemptively blocked an entire line of questioning. Chen Baibin had no choice but to ask the crucial question directly.

"A person like Cai Lan is obviously extremely dangerous. According to regulations, even if you were unwilling to hand her over to the military court or other judicial institutions for prosecution, you should at minimum have remanded her to a prisoner camp. Why did you keep her?"

"Because she painted well," Xie Erren said. "I needed precisely such a person for cultural and propaganda work..."

"Since she was retained as staff, there should be work records—drafts and the like."

"Yes, yes, all of that exists." Xie Erren was clearly prepared. "But the riot destroyed quite a few materials that night. I'm not certain everything is still intact..."

"Someone reported that your relationship with Cai Lan was not a working relationship. That she had effectively become your personal secretary—is there any truth to this?"

"Of course she wasn't my personal secretary. Registration with the General Office is required for that. Cai Lan had none." Xie Erren's evasion was smooth.

"Very well. Let me phrase it differently. Did a romantic relationship exist between you and Cai Lan?"

"That... yes." Xie Erren spread his hands helplessly. "I'm a man... I made the mistake any man might make. I know it was wrong, but in that moment I couldn't control myself." He sighed.

"Having established such a special relationship with her, did you provide her with corresponding special treatment? Please answer truthfully."

"Naturally I did. I'm no Pan An..." Xie Erren's voice carried resignation. "I arranged quarters for her. She ate from the same kitchen as me. I even found someone to keep her company—Jiang Qiuchan was the one... I never expected she'd be exploited by the enemy!"

Chen Baibin was mildly surprised. He hadn't anticipated such ready admissions from Xie Erren. He glanced at Ji Xin, who remained silent.

"Do you know exactly how the enemy exploited her?"

"That I don't know."

"Then how do you know she was exploited?"

"She was caught in the act by my Security Secretary."

This statement matched his report exactly—obviously carefully considered.

"According to statements from Luo Yangming and Zhao Fengtian, you once prepared to send a letter to Teng County to investigate Yi Haoran's background—but Teng County never received the inquiry. How do you explain this?"

"Perhaps it was burned on the night of the riot."

"Between your proposal and the riot was approximately two weeks. Would an inquiry letter be delayed that long?"

"It's hard to say. I have many responsibilities—many documents to read and sign. Sometimes I'm careless and leave things beneath other papers, and they go unprocessed for a long time. That was a failure in my work."

This was clearly forced reasoning, but in terms of witnesses and physical evidence, Chen Baibin had nothing powerful enough to prove he was lying. He could only move on.

Chen Baibin asked several more questions, all of which Xie Erren answered. But regarding his relationship with Cai Lan, he consistently maintained his earlier position, denying everything else.

Ji Xin said nothing throughout the entire interview, only listening carefully. When it finally concluded, he let out a long breath.

"This Xie Erren is quite the schemer!" Chen Baibin said. "Absolutely refuses to discuss the inquiry letter."

"Which precisely proves a point," Ji Xin said. "Cai Lan is deeply connected to this mysteriously vanished inquiry letter."

"You mean..."

"Exactly." Ji Xin nodded. "He and Cai Lan lived together in this courtyard. That wing room over there was clearly one of his offices. Consider: as Cai Lan, would you have had opportunities to enter the office and access the documents inside?"

"Plenty of opportunities."

"That's right." Ji Xin said, "Although we have no direct evidence, it now seems extremely likely that Cai Lan extracted and destroyed the inquiry letter."

"Why was he willing to admit the relationship with Cai Lan, yet keep this matter secret?"

"A romantic relationship with Cai Lan isn't a major offense—significant, yes, but relatively minor in nature. The document matter is a question of principle... So he chose the lesser evil." Ji Xin explained, "His relationship with Cai Lan is an open secret throughout Wuzhou. Whether it's Zhao Fengtian, ordinary naturalized cadres, soldiers, or even local natives—hundreds, perhaps thousands know. Even with powers beyond heaven, he couldn't cover it up."
