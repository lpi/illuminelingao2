# Chapter 2137 - The Way of the Gods

Examining the architecture closely, though dilapidated, one could still discern the grandeur of original construction. Main beams and pillars utilized precious *nanmu* wood. Not only did the main hall appear magnificent and elegant, but surrounding areas featured extensive halls, pavilions, terraces, and open porches. Inside stood the main hall, side rooms, wing rooms, connecting corridors, a retiring hall, the Yanxi Hall, the Youqing Hall, and dozens of other pavilions and terraces. Several *mu* of ponds dotted with flowers and trees completed the grounds.

"Officials have certainly known how to enjoy themselves since antiquity," Xie Erren sighed. Though this Three-General Headquarters dated over a century old, its condition actually surpassed some civilian residences. In area and imposing manner, it far exceeded the Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen where he currently resided.

Xie Erren suddenly considered: this place could entirely house refugees! Yet he immediately rejected this notion. If thousands of refugees moved in, they would inevitably kindle fires for cooking, and once flames erupted, major disaster would follow. Better to keep them settled in dispersed fashion.

However, these buildings could serve as future offices and factory buildings...

As Xie Erren pondered, he arrived before the General's Yamen. No General had stationed here for considerable time, but before the gate stood a peculiar pair of massive drums. The drum bodies proved enormous, large as Jacuzzi tubs. The drum skins had already tattered, but the drum bodies appeared stranger still. Not only was the surface texture rough, but the shapes weren't perfectly circular; they appeared crafted from some plant's skin.

Observing Chief Xie's fascination with this drum pair, a clerk hurriedly explained that after Han Yong conquered Dateng Gorge, he felled the giant rattan spanning the river, covered several sections with cowhide to fashion large drums, and distributed them to military headquarters in Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and Zhaoqing to demonstrate the martial achievement of "pacifying the rebellion." Legend held that when these drums were beaten, "the sound resembled thunder and could be heard for several *li*."

"This is rattan?" Xie Erren felt somewhat astonished—how thick must this rattan be! However, examining the drum body's color and texture, it indeed possessed old rattan's character.

"That is precisely why it bears the name Dateng [Great Rattan] Gorge," He Dongli explained. "Legend states this giant rattan was century-old vine spanning the Qian River. It sank during daylight and floated at night. Anyone wishing to cross the river merely had to cling to this rattan to traverse the water. After Lord Han conquered Dateng Gorge and captured Hou Dagou alive, he severed this rattan. Previously, merchants and travelers couldn't pass through Dateng Gorge, but passage began thereafter. Reportedly, a broken rattan section drifted down the Qian and Xun Rivers, reaching Teng County. Legend holds that Teng Prefecture and Teng County derived their names from this."

Xie Erren nodded repeatedly. This Han Yong was truly talented! Hearing that Han Yong possessed a shrine in Wuzhou, he proposed visiting the Han Duke Shrine to offer incense.

He Dongli experienced slight surprise, but considering that offering incense and praying to former sages constituted proper duty for local officials, he immediately led the way.

News that the "Great Song Prefect" would offer incense at the Han Duke Shrine spread immediately, and Wuzhou Prefecture and Cangwu County bailiffs sprang into action. First, they completely evicted all refugees and beggars lodging in the shrine, then dispatched personnel to "suppress" and "clean streets" along the route. The entire city stirred. By the time Xie Erren reached the Han Duke Shrine, streets already appeared spotless—because rumors held that Australians valued "environmental hygiene" supremely, they'd swept streets completely and even sprinkled clear water—only padding the road with yellow earth remained undone.

Everyone claimed Ming government efficiency was poor, but it didn't appear poor at all! Xie Erren privately approved.

Not only were streets "clean," but Rehabilitation Bureau directors particularly eager for favor, plus the local Ward *Paijia*, also arrived upon hearing news to "respectfully welcome" and "attend" roadside.

However, this Han Duke Shrine somewhat disappointed him—perhaps because familiarity with various magnificent "reconstructed ancient buildings" from the old timeline set expectations too high. Though a memorial archway stood before this Han Duke Shrine's gate, it simply resembled an ordinary residential courtyard! Though built of brick and tile, years of disrepair showed. Plaques and couplets had weathered and peeled, writing blurred.

Entering the shrine, towering ancient trees filled the interior. He Dongli stated these trees all possessed over a century of history, and legend held that Wang Shouren planted one.

"Wang Yangming visited here too?" Xie Erren expressed surprise again.

He Dongli explained, "Master Yangming served as Viceroy of Liangguang during the Jiajing reign. The Yangming Tower atop the East Gate was constructed by his successor, Viceroy Lin Fulin, to commemorate him."

Xie Erren held Wang Shouren in high regard. Learning he'd also served as Viceroy of Liangguang here, he secretly regretted not carefully studying manuals compiled by the Intelligence Bureau and Great Library. He hurriedly inquired, "Are there any relics of Master Yangming here?"

"A Four Sages Shrine exists in the city, where Master Yangming receives enshrinement..."

"Good, we'll visit shortly."

He Dongli thought this Australian showed considerable respect toward Great Ming's former sages! He immediately offered several observations about the School of Mind, but unexpectedly, Xie Erren exhibited absolutely no reaction and couldn't articulate anything sensible—obviously, he lacked understanding.

The shrine comprised merely a courtyard with three main rooms. The center enshrined Han Yong's spirit tablet. Nothing special appeared, nor did any displays resembling "deed exhibitions" or "celebrity item exhibitions" from the old timeline exist, leaving him slightly disappointed.

Xie Erren observed that though buildings here appeared somewhat dilapidated, they remained clean. Upon inquiry, he discovered no special guardian existed; only the family residing in the shrine's rear courtyard bore responsibility for guarding and sweeping. Hearing bailiffs announce the "Great Song Prefect" was coming to offer incense, this family's head emerged with his son to "welcome," terrified beyond measure, and wished to invite him to "sit for tea."

"No need, I only came to offer incense expressing my respect," Xie Erren waved dismissively.

Hearing the "Prefect Lord" wished to offer incense, father and son hurriedly arranged vase and burner properly and prepared incense sticks. Xie Erren stood solemnly before the tablet, offered incense, and bowed according to ritual. The crowd inevitably bowed and followed suit.

He Dongli and the Rehabilitation Bureau gentry who'd heard news all felt somewhat puzzled. This Australian master toured the entire city, neither examining treasuries nor observing culture and people's livelihood, but first inspected city walls and General Headquarters, then suddenly ran to Han Yong's shrine to offer incense. What routine was this? Yet this wasn't particularly strange: when county magistrates or prefects assumed office, worshipping gods everywhere was considered proper form. Only a few connected it to recent news of the Eight-Row Yao "rebellion"—perhaps Prefect Xie was expressing his "great ambition" thereby?

Exiting the main room, verandas stood on the courtyard's east and west sides. Ink marks covered the veranda walls. Approaching to examine, these proved various inscribed poems. Many years had passed, and many were already illegible. He'd formerly appreciated poetry, so presently he selected those with relatively clear calligraphy and read them individually.

Most inscribers had signatures, but most were unknown to Xie Erren; presumably officials residing in Wuzhou or local and passing literati. Some proved well-written, but most were merely average. Later, he suddenly spotted a familiar name: Zhu Yunming.

Xie Erren's understanding of Zhu Yunming extended beyond "Four Talents of Jiangnan." He vaguely recalled Zhu Yunming had also served in Guangdong—he hadn't expected he'd visited Wuzhou too! Examining the inscribed poem, it was a seven-character regulated verse rhyming on *ma*.

*Respectfully replying to Vice Commissioner Gu's poem at the Han Duke Shrine in Wuzhou*
*Towering timber constructs the Imperial house,*
*Leaning on heaven, heroic strategy regards insects and sand as trivial.*
*Sincerity returns to the palace towers, the heart hangs like a stone,*
*Blood drinks the Xiongnu, courage breaks the melon.*

*Midnight feast at the Kunlun Privy Council,*
*Three words of slander, the Fubo General's cart.*
*Where are the sharp tongues of that time now?*
*The old tree and grand shrine, the sun sets again.*

Judging solely by the poem, it wasn't top-grade, but the word "Fubo" in this poem suited his taste perfectly. He felt this was a favorable omen, and he didn't even feel annoyed by the Eight-Row Yao riot news, troop shortages, and rear area instability.

"These wall poems constitute precious Wuzhou cultural heritage; they must be well protected."

The crowd didn't recognize "cultural heritage," but understood "heritage." Obviously, Prefect Xie valued these wall poems highly. The local *Paijia* possessed quick wit and could discern that what he valued most was this Zhu Yunming poem, so he silently memorized it.

Since Xie Erren spoke thus, everyone naturally echoed agreement.

Xie Erren departed the Han Duke Shrine and proceeded to the Four Sages Shrine, performing rites as before. Observing his extreme respect toward local former sages, He Dongli surmised he intended "teaching through gods," so he suggested visiting the "Dragon Mother Temple" to offer incense.

During the Ming Dynasty, Wuzhou city and suburbs contained as many as seventeen ancient temples, including City God Temple, Guan Yu Temple, Xuanwu Temple, Wuxian Temple, and others, but the one with longest history and most flourishing incense was the Dragon Mother Temple.

Dragon Mother worship had always existed throughout the West River basin, possessing very long history. Legends related to the Dragon Mother's life experience had been included in local chronicles since the Jin Dynasty.

It was said the Dragon Mother's surname was Wen, her name Ao. She was born during King Huai of Chu's era, in Xiaotong *Fang*, Shuidong Street, First Division of Teng County, Guangxi.

Legend holds the Dragon Mother once adopted five small dragons. Later, with the five dragons' assistance, she led villagers splitting mountains and diverting water, controlling floods and benefiting the people, enabling everyone to live with favorable weather and abundant crops. Thus, Lady Wen was honored by West River basin inhabitants as "Dragon Mother" and became a "Goddess" benefiting people and protecting peace.

The Dragon Mother legend developed particularly in the West River basin. According to several New Daoism priests, the Dragon Mother legend shared similarities with the Mazu legend; both were deities born from spiritual needs of people living along rivers and seas praying for blessings and avoiding disasters.

Beginning from the Song Dynasty, due to increasing believers, Dragon Mother worship was listed in official sacrifices, and Dragon Mother worship gradually rose throughout Lingnan. During Ming and Qing dynasties, Dragon Mother belief spread even more widely among the people, expanding to Lingnan's surrounding areas, and Dragon Mother step by step became a water goddess with unique Lingnan characteristics.

West River basin inhabitants and masses who journeyed to the southeast coast and Southeast Asia to make livings across generations still constantly remembered the Dragon Mother's grace, hoping to often receive the Dragon Mother's protection, and established temples for sacrifice successively. Since the Dragon Mother was the West River's river god, Dragon Mother Temples were all constructed on riverbanks. In former days, Dragon Mother Temples existed in every West River county, serving as "Dragon Mother Traveling Palaces." People visited temples to sacrifice annually, praying for favorable weather and national and popular peace.

Xie Erren had read the Dragon Mother worship introduction in the *Wuzhou Situation Manual*. Knowing the Dragon Mother's status in Wuzhou people's hearts, visiting to offer incense also held meaning of winning popular sentiment, which was entirely appropriate.
