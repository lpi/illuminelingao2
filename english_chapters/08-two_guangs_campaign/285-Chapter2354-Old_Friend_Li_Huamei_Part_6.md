# Chapter 2354: Old Friend Li Huamei (Part 6)

The detached house Li Huamei built in the "Commercial District" was handled by Qi Feng from architectural structure to interior decoration. The design was exquisite, and the construction was meticulous, taking nearly two years in total. Many of the brick and tile building materials inside were specially customized. The attached courtyard was designed by Li Xiaolu. After completion, it aroused the envy of many Senators. If it weren't for the Liangguang Campaign distracting the Senators' energy and the subsequent large number of Senators moving north, "building villas" would probably have become another storm in the Senate.

Qi Feng didn't know yet that his villa had become a "model house," but in this new spacetime, he finally had a building built according to his own ideas, which was some comfort.

Running the past two years of dating and cohabiting with Li Huamei, borrowing his girlfriend's east wind, he took the *Hangzhou* to many places. The Ruins of St. Paul's in Macao were still under construction, but Qi Feng didn't disdain this semi-finished product. He drew sketches of the construction site at the site, exchanged architectural insights with the presiding priests and Portuguese craftsmen, saw the blueprints they drew, and saw with his own eyes how Japanese and Chinese craftsmen built this cathedral brick by brick.

To be honest, although he had traveled through time for nearly ten years, the feeling of witnessing with his own eyes how the wreckage of a building standing in another spacetime was built brick by brick back then was still very marvelous.

Besides Macao, he went most to Japan and India. Japan didn't leave much impression on him. As a fanatical believer of the "Western Fine Arts Religion," Qi Feng had little interest in Japan. But the large number of Portuguese buildings in Goa left a deep impression on him. especially the newly completed Se Cathedral. This building, which started construction in 1562 and took half a century to complete, was the largest church in all of Asia at that time. It had a Gothic style, combining a Tuscan Renaissance exterior and a Corinthian interior. It made Qi Feng mesmerized, and he stayed there for months. Because he was so obsessed with this church that he went to the church almost every day, the local bishop thought he was a devout believer.

Although Li Huamei's family had served the Portuguese for a long time, her parents had never converted to Christianity. They were very puzzled by Qi Feng's behavior of having absolutely no religious belief yet being so obsessed with church and monastery architecture. Anyway, this was just one of the countless incredible things about the Australians.

Apart from this, the relationship between the two was quite harmonious. Probably because they gathered less and parted more. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. They could always find freshness in each other. And both Li Huamei and Qi Feng were enthusiastic about their own careers and attached great importance to personal space.

During the days when Li Huamei was not around, Qi Feng's main pastime in his spare time was studying and teaching. He and Trini became a pair of "good buddies"; either he went to this Italian's house, or the Italian came to his house. The two would either talk loudly or comment on creations, sometimes staying for a whole day.

Qi Feng also accepted a few students—all seedlings selected from Trini's training class. In terms of painting and sculpture skills, he was not as good as this Italian, but when it came to architecture, he still left this Italian several streets behind.

Naturally, what he explained to the students was not the "Bauhaus School Lingao Style" that dominated the General Construction Company, but "Architecture of Pure Beauty." Of course, he also taught knowledge of architectural space, mechanics, and functionality, but the main theme was still "how to design beautiful buildings."

When Trini was busy, he would lead the students in his own studio to knock and beat, make models, engage in sculpture, and paint, busy and happy. Covered in dirt. But Qi Feng enjoyed it tirelessly. Although he couldn't build the various magnificent buildings he had drawn countless times now, at least his life was very fulfilling.

"Someone from the PSB is looking for me?" Qi Feng put down the ruling pen and pretended to be solemn, "Strange, I have nothing to do with them."

"Do you want me to turn him away?" his secretary asked.

"No need, let him in." Qi Feng thought, *Could it be about Li Huamei?*

Ever since knowing his "wife" had "historical issues," this matter had always been a worry in his heart. Although Zhou Botao swore to assure him back then that as long as Li Huamei had no factual "hostile behavior," the PSB would never take action against her. In recent years, his affection for Li Huamei deepened day by day, and he became increasingly worried that this tough woman of the sea, the little woman in his arms, would be momentarily confused and commit some "hostile incident."

Don't look at Li Huamei's great fame in the Senate; since she started dating him, there were quite a few people who turned from love to hate. Back then, they didn't hesitate to hang an innocent female instructor; now they might not necessarily be unable to do this. When the time came, he would probably only have to flee to the ends of the earth with her. But his ideal of transmigration would be annihilated...

This hidden worry had been hidden deep in his heart. He once thought about whether to let Li Huamei go to Europe in advance to buy some property as a final escape plan. After all, it would still be difficult for the Senate to extend its jurisdictional hand to Europe in his lifetime.

But after thinking it over again and again, he gave up this idea. A voyage to Europe took eight or nine months one way. Neither the Southeast Asia Company, the Navy, nor the PSB would let her just disappear for two years. Since the PSB had already sent a letter informing that Li Huamei's "background was suspicious," there might have long been spies planted among her sailors and entourage. These little tricks couldn't be hidden from them—at that time, it would instead become some kind of "evidence of crime."

Qi Feng opened the envelope with slight nervousness, scanned it hastily, and then his brows suddenly tightened. Then his brows relaxed again.

"A new official applies three fires," he complained in a low voice, then looked up and said:
"I've read the letter. Go back and report to your leadership; my answer is: 'Why not.'" As he spoke, he took out a metal lighter from the drawer, lit the note, and threw it into the large brush washer on the table serving as a wastebasket.

"So Qi Feng expressed willingness to cooperate?"

"Saying cooperate might be too much, but at least he won't interfere with our actions." Guo Yi said, "I think he won't let go of this opportunity to 'detoxify' Li Huamei."

"You are right. This matter is very tricky. Right now is a good opportunity to solve it. Since everyone has a consensus, I approve your plan." Zhao Manxiong nodded, "Who specifically do you plan to send to execute it?"

"I arranged two young men. Although they lack experience, they have been systematically trained by us. I have attached the relevant files to the action plan. One is responsible for infiltrating the Southeast Asia Company, and then the Nanyang Company will be responsible for arranging him to be by Li Huamei's side. His public identity is a newly attached naturalized citizen transferred to the Nanyang Company. The other, I plan to let him work on the periphery as an entourage of an indigenous merchant."

"Good." Zhao Manxiong expressed satisfaction, "Li Huamei won't have any major problems; the main issue is Li Siya..."

Guo Yi knew these words set the tone for the entire operation: "I understand."

"Also, regarding the cooperation with the Nanyang Company. Who do you plan to send as the deputy director?"

"I have a suitable candidate, but he is a bit old. I'm afraid he can't stand the tossing of boats."

"Are you talking about that old man?" Zhao Manxiong laughed, "I think the problem isn't big. The Nanyang Company is all ships and colonies; he, the deputy director of the Security Department, won't have many opportunities to go to sea—the headquarters of the Nanyang Company is currently planned to be in Sanya, and in the future, it will probably be moved to places like Malacca. Just let him do more paperwork at the headquarters residence. You decide the other candidates—give young people more opportunities."

*The chief chooses an old man, while the subordinate must "give young people more opportunities,"* Guo Yi thought, *this Director Zhao's instructions remain unique.* However, he had long been accustomed to the leader's kind of steady, seemingly plain but actually information-heavy words. He nodded in agreement immediately.

Liu Fuqing opened the window. He took a deep breath of the outside air.

Lingao's winter was not as cold and damp as his hometown Nanjing; the sun was warm and the sky was clear for miles. The flowers in the flower beds in the courtyard downstairs were blooming prosperously, faint floral fragrance drifted past his nose, and small birds were chirping.

This place was truly a fairyland on earth, Liu Fuqing thought. Who could have thought that a government office could look like this!

He turned around. The air in the office with closed windows seemed a bit stale. He had sat in this small office for nearly three years—since returning from Jeju Island, he had been working here.

He looked at his office with mixed feelings. The mountainous pile of documents on the table had been cleared away, and the filing cabinet was sealed with handover strips. The desk lamp with a green glass shade was wiped clean. The document baskets marked "Incoming" and "Outgoing" were empty; there were no more varied documents.

On the coat rack at the door hung his uniform, the winter wear just issued this year. Adorned with his rank: Region Commander. This was the end point of his service to the Great Song.

Taking a boat from Xuwen across the sea to Lingao to defect to the Chiefs seemed like something that happened yesterday. In the blink of an eye, he had served the Senate for six years. He was already an old man of sixty-two.

A few days ago, he received a notification from the Personnel Division asking him to handle the handover and prepare for retirement.

He naturally understood retirement; the Ming Dynasty also had this rule. When one got old and couldn't work anymore, one had to go home. For officials, it was called resigning from office; clerks weren't so particular. Once the superior spoke, those who knew what was good for them would resign. Fortunately, after being a clerk for so many years, he had accumulated some family property. Spending his remaining years in peace and playing with grandchildren was not difficult.

If he hadn't met with that calamity back then, he probably would have been "retiring" in the Nanjing countryside like this seven or eight years ago.

Unexpectedly, a disaster almost put him to death, ending up with his family broken and dead! All that was left to him was a chest full of hatred. It was precisely this hatred in his chest that supported him to be exiled to Lingnan with his aging body, and then cross the sea to "defect to the Kuns."
