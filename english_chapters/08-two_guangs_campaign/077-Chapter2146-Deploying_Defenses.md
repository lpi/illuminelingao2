# Chapter 2146 - Deploying Defenses

Gou Xunli smiled unfathomably. Rotten-Eye Hu knew that this sworn brother had some "material" to educate him again.

"Big Brother, you must know that there is a gorge on this Gui River called Duanteng (Broken Rattan) Gorge."

"I know that; that's the Yao people's territory."

"Exactly. The Yao people in Duanteng Gorge rose against the government in the Jiajing reign. Their leader, Hou Dagou, once captured Wuzhou with only seven hundred men, captured several court officials, and killed the Administration Commissioner."

"Is there such a thing?!" Now it was Rotten-Eye Hu's turn to be surprised.

"Of course it's true." Gou Xunli said, "Not only that, from the Tianshun era to the Chenghua era, the Yao people captured Wuzhou seven times. Each time they won with fewer numbers—are we inferior to a few Yao barbarians?"

These words moved Rotten-Eye Hu's heart, but Hou Dagou had seven hundred men after all, while they only had two hundred. And the Great Ming's soldiers and the Bald Thieves' soldiers were not the same thing.

"...So what we want to do is not to capture Wuzhou..."

"If we don't capture it, what fortune can we make?" Rotten-Eye Hu was greatly disappointed. "We are not government troops; we can claim credit by rushing in and chopping off a few heads—besides, how many taels of silver can one head get? Maybe it will be embezzled by the officials. Won't do it, won't do it."

"Hehe, Big Brother, you are wrong. In my opinion, we don't even need to chop heads." Gou Xunli said, "Do you know there is a priceless treasure in Wuzhou city—as long as we get this treasure, promotion and wealth are just around the corner..."

Rotten-Eye Hu slapped his thigh and shouted: "Brother, stop tormenting people with mysteries. Just speak frankly. How do we plan to do it?!"

"Good!" Gou Xunli knew he had made Rotten-Eye Hu determined, so he stopped playing with words and said, "The biggest treasure in Wuzhou city is the Bald Thieves' 'Director'!"

"Director?"

"It is the True Bald Senator." Gou Xunli nodded heavily. "As long as we capture him and present him to Viceroy Xiong, hehe..."

"But he is in the city; how do we catch him?"

"So I say, we sneak attack, 'raid the bed'." Gou Xunli said, "We only have this many people in total. Don't think about conquering Wuzhou and looting for three days. But sneaking into Wuzhou and kidnapping this True Bald out is not without opportunity."

This idea was daring to the extreme. Rotten-Eye Hu was stunned for a moment. However, thinking it over, the temptation of this spoil of war was indeed too great—so far, in the battles between the Imperial Court and the Bald Thieves, let alone catching a True Bald, not even a Fake Bald leader had been killed in battle. Once a True Bald was captured and presented to the Court, this credit would absolutely not be small. Moreover, True Balds and Fake Balds differ greatly in temperament and image; they are hard to impersonate, so there was no need to worry about Xiong Wencan not believing it.

"Brother's idea works! Just that he is inside Wuzhou city and must be guarded by heavy troops. How do we start?"

"I entered the city a few days ago and have thoroughly understood the situation inside. This Bald Thief Director, upon arriving in the city, is busy with irrelevant matters and doesn't care about military preparations. Instead, he paints words on walls every day, asks people to sing and speak on the streets to engage in some 'propaganda' to confuse the people; asks merchants to open for business to 'prosper the market,' and is anxious to gather large sums of money to 'repair bridges and fix roads'—set on being a Lord of a Hundred Li. He doesn't care much about military preparations alone. This is an opportunity we can take advantage of..."

"Which year were you a soldier?" Qian Duo asked Zhu Si on the way to the command post.

The Senate's army, inevitably like all armies in the world, liked to rank by seniority. Which year you were a soldier could roughly determine your status.

The sources of National Army soldiers were naturally wide and varied, but the officer class was invariably from the Fubo Army. Zhu Si was no exception. He immediately answered crisply: "Report! I was originally a camp soldier of the Denglai Town of the Ming State. I joined the army in 1632 through Battalion Commander Huang Ande's introduction while serving in the Shandong Detachment. Upon enlistment, I belonged to the Forward Column of the Shandong Detachment."

"Oh, so you're a veteran too." Qian Duo nodded. "Where did you serve before transferring to the National Army?"

"Served in the Lingao Garrison Battalion." Zhu Si was very proud of this resume: although the Lingao Garrison Battalion had limited strength, it was the unit defending the capital and the Senate. The officers and soldiers inside all considered themselves the "Imperial Guards."

"What rank?"

"Corporal." Speaking of this, Zhu Si was a bit embarrassed. His service time in the Garrison Battalion wasn't short, but his performance couldn't be called good. He was just promoted to Private First Class step by step according to seniority. This "Corporal" rank was only promoted before the temporary transfer to the National Army—they couldn't let a Private First Class transfer to the National Army to be an officer.

Among the soldiers who joined the army in Shandong at the same time as him, many had already become officers. Sergeants were considered very common.

"No wonder you became a Battalion Commander as soon as you came out. You are a veteran!" Qian Duo said in an appreciative tone.

"Sir is joking," Zhu Si felt very comfortable hearing his words. He said respectfully, "It is all the Senate's cultivation!"

Although in rank Zhu Si was only one grade lower than Qian Duo, the rank of the Fubo Army was much more "valuable" than that of the National Army. After all, officers in the National Army were filled by NCOs from the Fubo Army. Transferring from the Fubo Army to the National Army was truly "three promotions in a row."

The Wuzhou City Defense Command was located in the Cangwu County Yamen. Next to it was the Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen acting as the Municipal Government. This place was close to the city wall and was one of the few large masonry buildings in Wuzhou city, making it convenient for troops to maneuver or garrison.

Qian Duo spread out the Wuzhou city defense map on the table and pointed at it.

"Originally, our strength was insufficient, and defending Wuzhou was very strenuous." Qian Duo, the actual supreme commander in Wuzhou city, indicated on the Wuzhou map, "You also saw, the perimeter of Wuzhou city is nearly three kilometers. Currently, one company is simply not enough."

Zhu Si was secretly alarmed seeing this deployment map. The defense of Wuzhou was too weak. No wonder he originally commanded only a company but was suddenly reorganized into a battalion before departure—it turned out that Senator Xie here was playing the Empty Fort Strategy!

"In addition, we have to guard the Sanhezui POW camp. The prisoners in this camp haven't been transferred completely yet. There are currently about a thousand people—although we used some retained bailiffs to guard them, without our troops anchoring the formation, the strong-arm bailiffs simply can't suppresses these old soldier rascals."

"I understand. Please instruct, Sir. What is our battalion's mission?"

"Your mission is to replace the 3rd Line Infantry Company in assuming the city-wide security mission. This way, I can concentrate the 3rd Company as a fist, ready to be used at any time—you probably discovered on the way here that the environment along the route is very complex. To our west are the Guangxi Ming troops of Xiong Wencan still entrenched in Teng County, and around us are countless Yao and Zhuang stockades. The situation is very unfavorable to us. We have to deal with possible attacks anytime and anywhere."

"Yes! Guaranteed to complete the mission!" Zhu Si had roughly understood the situation before coming to Wuzhou. He was from the old camp army and wasn't afraid of being a soldier and fighting battles—as long as there was money to take and promotion to get. Those years in the Garrison Battalion had stifled him: standing guard, escorting, and practicing formation every day. When could he accumulate enough credit to become an officer?

Transferring to the National Army, although it was more than three promotions, the National Army wasn't considered a regular army, and did chores. Zhu Si was quite disheartened. Until he heard he was going to the front line, he got his spirit back. Not only was he not afraid, but he also had some secret delight: following the Senate to fight rarely resulted in death, but opportunities to earn merit were numerous.

"Good, come look." Qian Duo pointed on the map with a red and blue pencil:

"Our current position is the Cangwu County Yamen, and next to it is the Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen—that is, the new City Government. Chief Xie and the entire City Government team are here, so this area is our defense focus."

Zhu Si nodded.

"Which company in your battalion has the strongest combat power and is the most reliable?"

"Of course it's the 1st Company," Zhu Si said. "They are composed of old naturalized citizens, all equipped with Nanyang rifles, and the officers are retired veterans."

"Then your 1st Company will garrison here, and at the same time be responsible for guarding the Nanxun Gate and Dezheng Gate, which are the Great South Gate and Little South Gate. These two city gates were damaged severely in the siege battle; you have to watch this place well!"

"Yes! Chief, I will also set up the Battalion Headquarters here. I will be personally responsible!"

"Good." Zhu Si nodded, moving the pencil on the map. "Look, due south of the Wuzhou city wall is the Nanxun Gate (Great South Gate), extending west to the Dezheng Gate (Little South Gate), then extending northwest to the Xijiang Gate—that is the West Gate, then curving north to the Dayun Gate in the north, then extending east to the foot of Beishan Mountain, along Beishan Mountain southeast to the Yangming Gate in the east, and finally turning back to the Nanxun Gate. Your 2nd Company will garrison the West Gate and North Gate; the Supplementary Company will garrison the Yangming Gate." Qian Duo straightened up, "3rd Company, station at Sanhezui. Guard the POW camp."

"Yes! Sir."

"As for the 3rd Line Infantry Company, I will concentrate the entire deployment at the Three-General Headquarters. This is our core mobile force."

Zhu Si understood Qian Duo's intention. The Three-General Headquarters was the commanding height of the whole city. Deploying the strongest troops here could control the whole city on one hand, and could come out to reinforce anywhere at any time on the other hand. It was equivalent to the general reserve of the entire Wuzhou army.

"To be honest, I am more worried about the Supplementary Company. This company has only been established for a dozen days. Most are stragglers and local unemployed able-bodied men. Both combat power and discipline are very poor—I originally intended for the 3rd Platoon to return to its unit, but now it seems that to make them play a role, the 3rd Platoon can only continue to stay in this company as the backbone."

However, in this way, the 3rd Company lost one-third of its strength, which made Qian Duo really a bit uneasy.

Hearing this, Zhu Si hurriedly came to share the worry: "Report, I suggest transferring some personnel from the other three companies of the National Army to mix with the Supplementary Company."
