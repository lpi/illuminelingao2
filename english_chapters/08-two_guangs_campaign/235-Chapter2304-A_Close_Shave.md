# Chapter 2304 - A Close Shave

"The situation is critical!" Luo Yangming could no longer care about anything else and roared at the sergeant, "Something big is about to happen!"

The sergeant also knew the situation was bad and immediately said, "Go quickly!" Then he said to the soldiers around him, "All units attention, prepare to fire!"

Luo Yangming shouted, "Brothers, grab your weapons and charge!"

As soon as Song Ming climbed onto the wall, he heard the sound of bird guns and the ensuing shouts of slaughter. He knew the pursuers had arrived and there wasn't much time left. They had to leave the city as soon as possible—as long as they got out, with the pitch-black darkness and the thieves lacking cavalry, playing hide-and-seek in the wild terrain familiar to his side would make it easier to escape.

However, the personal guard carrying the thief, burdened with a living person weighing over a hundred *jin* and having run all the way, was exhausted by the time they reached the foot of the wall. He had no strength left to climb while carrying him and had to switch with someone else. This delay took quite a while. Just as they struggled to drag Xie the Thief up the wall bound in ropes, a roar came from the direction of the Great Cloud Gate tower. Countless lanterns and torches swayed as they approached.

Discovered! Song Ming's heart tightened. This was too fast! Only a dozen or so men had climbed the wall; the rest were still at the base. Even if they all came up, there would only be about thirty men, insufficient to resist for long.

"Quick! Lower the thief down!" he ordered.

There was no time to set up the rope ladder properly. Several soldiers immediately tied long ropes around Xie Erren and dragged him toward the battlements.

Although Xie Erren had been rendered blind and mute, his ears could still hear. From the tossing about and the words he heard just now, Xie Erren knew this group wanted to kidnap him out of the city.

Kidnapping him out of the city—the purpose required no asking. They definitely wanted to hand him over to the Great Ming court. He never thought the joke among Senators—"sending you to taste the methods of the Eastern Depot Eunuchs"—would actually fall upon his own head. Thinking of this, Xie Erren's hands and feet went cold. Although trussed up like a *zongzi*, he struggled desperately.

When a person faces life or death, they can erupt with great potential. Moreover, hearing the sound of pursuers arriving, he struggled desperately regardless of everything. For a moment, three or four soldiers couldn't handle him.

Seeing this, Song Ming ruthlessly slapped the back of his blade against Xie Erren's head, knocking him unconscious on the spot.

"Quick!" he urged.

However, at this moment, the Great Cloud Gate tower had judged from the firelight and sounds of fighting at the base of the wall that there was a problem here. A warning signal rocket soared into the sky. Immediately following was the crack of Minié rifle volleys tearing through the night sky. Three soldiers moving on the wall were instantly struck down. The soldiers who were dragging Xie Erren toward the battlements were also hit and fell to the ground.

Song Ming was truly anxious now, roaring repeatedly: "Quick! Quick! Lower him down!" Then he waved to the others, "Stop them!"

Seven or eight personal guards who had already climbed the wall immediately moved to intercept. Luo Yangming saw people coming out to fight in the darkness and knew his trip was not in vain. With a command, everyone threw their lanterns and torches simultaneously, instantly illuminating the rappelling area meant for the wall descent. For a moment, Song Ming and the others were clearly illuminated. He even saw Xie Erren collapsed on the ground.

Unable to suppress the excitement in his heart, Luo Yangming shouted, "Brothers, wealth and glory are here today! Everyone risk your lives and charge!"

Seeing the opponents were few, the courage of the hundred-odd porters grew. Each picked up their carrying poles and chopping knives and charged forward killing. Although the opponents were elite soldiers, they couldn't withstand the large number of people with bolstered courage. In just a moment, they were overwhelmed by the superior number of porters. The entire section of the wall was filled with the sounds of slaughter and shouting. Occasionally, people lost their footing and fell from the wall.

Song Ming saw the situation was out of control. Not only was his side on the wall swamped, but lights and torches were surging toward them from all directions below the wall. Knowing it was impossible to take the True Kun away, he decided to take his head instead!

But at this moment, the entire crossing point was surging with heads; fighting crowds and rolling bodies were everywhere. He couldn't find Xie Erren's whereabouts for a while. Even if he found him, taking his head in this chaotic army was difficult upon difficult. Seeing his personal guards and retainers becoming fewer and fewer, knowing that if he didn't leave he would be trapped too, Song Ming couldn't help but sigh long and shout, "Go, go quickly!"

With that, he leaped out of the battlement himself, grabbed a rope, and slid down.

Several soldiers immediately followed, grabbing ropes and rappelling down. The rest were either killed or beaten to the ground and captured alive. At the base of the wall, Jiang Suo's dozen men were also dead or wounded. Jiang Suo backed against the wall, desperately waving his sword to resist, but the surrounding porters grew more numerous. These men were all killing-red-eyed; carrying poles rained down on him like raindrops. In moments, Jiang Suo was beaten until his head broke and blood flowed. Losing his weapon, he fell to the ground unable to get up.

Wen Tietou stopped the others: "This is an officer. Tie him up and hand him to the Australians for a reward!"

On the wall, Luo Yangming frantically searched for Xie Erren among the piles of corpses and wounded, terrified his judgment was wrong and he had delayed the rescue of the Senator. It wasn't until he searched under the parapet that he found a person bound tightly with a black cloth hood over his head. By the firelight, he could see the man was wearing a cadre suit.

Luo Yangming's heart beat wildly. He rushed forward a few steps, turned the person over, and pulled off the hood. Seeing it was indeed Chief Xie, eyes closed tightly and blood on his head, he was horrified and hurriedly reached out to check his breathing.

The breathing was steady. Touching the neck, there was still a pulse. Luo Yangming felt his whole body lose strength as if unloaded; he could no longer stand and fell to his knees with a *plop*, so limp he didn't even have the strength to lift a hand.

The gate-guarding sergeant also arrived. Seeing the scene, he was startled and asked, "What is going on?" Looking closely at the person Luo Yangming was holding on his knees, he exclaimed in shock, "It's Chief Xie!"

Luo Yangming nodded slightly and whispered, "Don't make a noise. Find a stretcher quickly. Send him back quietly."

"Yes, yes," the sergeant sweated like rain, remembering how he had strictly refused earlier, nearly ruining a major affair! If Chief Xie had been taken by the Ming army or killed, wouldn't he become the chief culprit? Thinking of this, he stammered involuntarily, "I, I'll go right away... Master, don't take it to heart; I was blinded by lard just now! You, Master, represent the number one merit!"

Luo Yangming shook his head. "Don't take it to heart, go quickly. The Chief is injured and needs to be sent back for treatment. Don't speak of this matter."

"Yes, yes. I know." The sergeant saluted and hurried to find a stretcher. In his heart, he cursed himself for being stupid beyond reach: not only did he let a sky-high merit slip away, but now he might even bear responsibility!

Before long, a stretcher was brought. Luo Yangming ordered two porters to untie the ropes on Xie Erren first, then lift the stretcher to return to the Prefectural Yamen. He himself was supported by a porter and stood up with difficulty. At this time, Wen Tietou arrived panting, covered in bloodstains and sweat.

"Master!" he said excitedly. "We caught a leader—is the person saved? I saw someone carrying a stretcher down."

"Saved." Luo Yangming nodded. "Safe and sound! You and your brothers have achieved great merit!"

"Ancestors finally showed their spirit!" Wen Tietou said. "Old me is going to turn his luck around!"

Luo Yangming smiled slightly. "Gather all the brothers. Those dead or injured must be settled well. Make a list for me first. The living will be rewarded according to merit, and the dead must have pensions. They are all good brothers; we can't let them sell their lives without a proper end..."

"Rest assured, I'll do it right now!" Wen Tietou looked at his appearance and suddenly frowned. "Master, are you injured?"

"I'm fine, just my body is very soft." Luo Yangming was anxious to return to the Prefectural Yamen to discuss the aftermath with Zhao Fengtian. "Call two brothers, carry me in a sedan chair or on a back, just send me quickly to the Yamen." He added, "Mention today's matter to no one!"

"Understood!"

Zhao Fengtian was like an ant on a hot pan in the Prefectural Yamen. He had also heard the gunshots at the Great Cloud Gate. Upon hearing the shots, he immediately sent men to reinforce the Great Cloud Gate and gather news.

Hearing that Luo Yangming had saved Chief Xie on the Great Cloud Gate wall and sent him back, Zhao Fengtian also collapsed into a chair, trembling all over.

It was truly a close shave! Zhao Fengtian thought. If not for Luo Yangming, the mess in Wuzhou City this time wouldn't be settled even if he apologized with death...

In a crisis, these old locals were indeed useful...

Right now, the most important thing was to get the Chief back to the Yamen and seal the news as much as possible—it couldn't be kept from the Senate, but that had nothing to do with him; Elder Xie would take the heat anyway. The main thing was to block the news from the naturalized citizens and local natives as much as possible to strictly prevent the people's hearts from wavering.

"Carry Chief Xie quietly to his residence in the Three Generals' Office immediately!" He ordered his subordinates. "Just say Chief Xie was wounded in the attack and needs quiet rest. Say nothing else."

He thought of Sanhezu again. Not knowing the situation there, he was just about to send someone to inquire when Qian Duo returned.

"The fire and cannon sounds at Sanhezu have gradually subsided—we've made contact with Sanhezu; the enemy has retreated." Qian Duo took off his hat wearily. "What a night of tossing and turning! I heard drums in the city just now; did enemies infiltrate?"

"Something big happened in the city!" Zhao Fengtian explained the events in a few words. Even an old officer experienced in battle like Qian Duo turned pale, stunned for a long while before saying, "Good Heavens! So that's what happened! We almost caused a catastrophic error!"

"This time it was really thanks to Luo Yangming!" Zhao Fengtian smiled bitterly. "It seems the Chief was not fated to die."

"It's also our good luck," Qian Duo said. "We really must thank him properly."

While they were talking, Zhu Si also arrived, looking exasperated. As soon as he entered, he asked if there was news of Xie Erren. Hearing he had been rescued, he let out a long breath and also collapsed into a chair.

"This really saved my life," he murmured.
