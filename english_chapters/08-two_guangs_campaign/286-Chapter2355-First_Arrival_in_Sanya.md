# Chapter 2355: First Arrival in Sanya

The Senate did not disdain his old age but promoted him to this position. And he devoted himself entirely to his duties, serving the Senate with due diligence.

Now he was truly "old," and the Australians were telling him to "retire." Today was his last day working at the Political Security Bureau.

The handover procedures had all been completed. Yesterday afternoon, his colleagues held a farewell tea party for him. Although there was no banquet, plenty of tea and snacks were prepared. Colleagues from the Reconnaissance Division pooled money to buy him a gift, and everyone toasted him one by one with tea instead of wine. Finally, Chief Guo, the new head of the Reconnaissance Division, also came. Although he was a new official taking office, he said many praiseworthy words about him, thanking him for his service to the Senate over the past few years. Finally, a brief ceremony was held, awarding him a "Certificate of Appreciation" and a "Labor Service Medal" signed by the Director and Deputy Directors.

The "Labor Service Medal" was not a particularly high honor: according to regulations, all naturalized cadres and employees of the Senate who retired normally could receive it. However, when Guo Yi personally pinned the medal on his chest, Liu Fuqing shed tears, something he hadn't done in a long time.

He himself couldn't explain clearly why he cried. Apart from the mixed feelings of leaving his post, it was more about the Senate's recognition of him. This was an emotion he had never experienced in all his years as a clerk in the Ministry of Justice.

*Alas, I am old,* he thought.

Liu Fuqing felt a bit empty inside. His family members were either dead or scattered, and he hadn't organized a new family after coming to Lingao. For the past few years, he basically treated the bureau as his home. Now that he was retired, where could he go?

Naturally, he couldn't go to the bureau's single dormitory and canteen anymore. Colleagues from the General Affairs Division rented a "Standard Single Residence" for him in the civil servant residential area of Lingao Old Town. The rent was very low—almost symbolic. The problem of eating was also easy to solve; there were plenty of "canteens" locally catering to single people. Whether it was à la carte or a "meal plan," it was no burden for a person like him with a "pension."

*The Australians think very thoughtfully; they won't let their hawks and dogs have a bad end,* Liu Fuqing lamented secretly. *The Great Ming is no good; the masters treat you as a human when you are useful, and as nothing when you are not. Petty officials like them are truly worth less than a piece of toilet paper!*

Although he wouldn't have to worry about food and clothing in the days to come, what would he do? Liu Fuqing was certain of one thing: he could live for at least another five or six years. Would he just muddle along and wait for death in these five or six years?

He packed up his last belongings: his PSB ID and personal sidearm—he would turn them in at the guardroom when leaving, then walk out the gate—in the future, he would have to apply for a pass separately if he wanted to enter this courtyard again. He took one last lingering look at this small office, and just as he was filled with emotions, the office door opened.

"Comrade Region Commander! Chief Guo invites you over."

Xu Yanliang stood on the surveillance tower of Anleyou Pier, with the rippling Dadonghai in front of him.

In the old spacetime of the parallel universe, he had been to Hainan, so naturally, he had visited Dadonghai. But for someone who had already been to Southeast Asia and seen pure tropical islands, attractions like Sanya and Dadonghai were really too ordinary. Especially when he went diving, the gap was even greater.

The trip to Sanya in the old spacetime only gave Xu Yanliang a lot of material for complaints, with no commendable memories.

This was his first time coming to Sanya under the rule of the Senate.

His trip to Sanya this time was quite rushed; he only brought a few attendants from the Southeast Asia Company who were familiar with the local situation. He didn't even bring Li Huamei, whom they intended to put in an important position.

Since Wang Luobin was transferred back to Lingao, Sanya's development had stagnated. Although it was still a "Special City" and the "Southern Central Metropolis" in the island-wide planning of the Hainan Region, in reality, it didn't show much of the scale a "Special City" should have in various constructions.

On one hand, naturally due to financial difficulties, the Senate couldn't fork out too much money to build Sanya; on the other hand, Sanya's awkward location and geographical environment also limited its development in the Senate's urban system.

In the Senate's plan, besides being the administrative center of southern Hainan Island and the export port for Tiandu iron ore, Sanya would also become an important chemical and commercial trade center in southern Hainan Island in the future. Xu Yanliang saw the plan compiled under the lead of the Planning Committee in the Great Library: it planned to use petroleum from Southeast Asia and salt from Yinggehai to open a chemical industrial zone, and also listed Sanya as a "Nanyang Trade Center."

However, after these few years, most of these ambitious plans remained only on paper. Even the planned "Navy Base and Command Center for the Nanyang Direction" had not been implemented.

The ambitious salt chemical and petrochemical bases were completely missing. Needless to say about petrochemicals, even the "mature" industry of salt chemicals hadn't been rolled out. The reason was simple: no matter how superior the salt-drying conditions in Yinggehai were, it was just a barren beach, requiring massive manpower and resources to turn into a salt field. And the edible salt produced by salt fields in northern Hainan Island and along the southern coast of Guangdong was enough for the Senate's current salt chemical industry usage.

Of course, further expanding the production capacity of salt chemicals was always a good thing, but the manpower and resources required to build the Yinggehai Salt Field daunted the Planning Committee. Although the "Yinggehai State-owned Salt City" unit was now in the Planning Committee's SOE sequence list, it was just a small salt field. The annual output was only comparable to the Ma'ao Salt Field. Rather than providing more salt for the Senate, it was more like a providing employment base for exiles.

In the industrial planning given to Sanya at that time, apart from the Tiandu Mining Bureau, the only thing truly realized was the coconut product processing base. Currently, the trade and processing center for coconuts in southern Hainan Island was located in Sanya. Another large-scale industrial enterprise was the Arrack Distillery.

Although the trading center facing Nanyang was once pushed by the Senate, and Sanya was listed as an "Open Port" when concluding various trade agreements, the fact was that, apart from Quark Poor's labor trade, most European merchant ships would not use this place as a trading port.

The Senate originally thought that since this place was a necessary stop on the route to Nanyang, and historically Nanyang trade ships docked here, then as long as there was policy support, a trading port would naturally form locally.

On the other hand, it was Sanya's awkward geographical location. The Senators ignored one problem: although European merchants were not choosy when looking for trading ports along the Chinese coast, willing to occupy even a savage place like Tainan, the premise was that they had no better choice. If there was a choice, everyone hoped to trade at a port close to the product sales and supply areas, rather than at a transshipment trading port.

Sanya happened to be a city that didn't produce any export commodities and consumed very few imported commodities. The products exported most here were iron ore and various coconut products, which strictly speaking were not commodities but materials of the Planning Committee. The only local commodity that could truly be sold to foreign merchants was Arrack.

Various bulk export commodities favored by foreign merchants: silk fabrics, sugar, rum, industrial products, steel products, glass products, food, porcelain... Sanya produced very little or none at all. This meant that these commodities all had to be transported from Lingao and the mainland.

Although the Planning Committee and Sanya Special City established many preferential conditions, including low-priced land, tax exemptions, etc., to attract private capital to invest in setting up factories and participate in overseas trade, and indeed attracted quite a few merchants to set up "Limited Companies" in Sanya, Xu Yanliang walked around Sanya and felt that there were few local manufacturing enterprises; most were "companies" hanging a sign. And there was no feeling of "busy business."

The Agricultural Sector spent a lot of resources opening "Tropical Crop Gardens" around Sanya, but the conditions for tropical crops on Hainan Island were far inferior to Southeast Asia. Producing spices was inferior to India and the Moluccas in both cost and yield, while the climatic conditions for planting rubber, cocoa, and palm oil in Sanya were somewhat insufficient, and the production cycle was very long. So far, no trade scale had formed. Moreover, in the long run, Hainan Island was not an ideal planting place either.

As for imports, there were even fewer commodities that could be directly consumed locally. Because the city scale couldn't rise for a long time and the industrial level was limited, Sanya's formal residents so far were only fifty thousand, mainly mining bureau workers and agricultural immigrants settled by the Planning Committee in surrounding farms. Their own consumption of materials was not enough to support sufficient imports. Currently, the only bulk "commodities" imported by Sanya were labor and rice. The former was also in decline because the Mining Bureau's demand for labor was constantly dropping.

For the British and the Dutch, going to Lingao or Kaohsiung didn't require much extra cost, but there was a lot of leeway in cargo selection. Although the Planning Committee once attempted to use tariffs to regulate the destination of merchant ships, the fact was: since foreign merchant ships could transport goods directly to Lingao, why force them to unload in Sanya, adding an extra cost of loading, unloading, and transshipment in vain?

This made no sense in terms of cost no matter what, so Sanya, on which the Senate pinned high hopes back then, fell into a half-dead state. After Wang Luobin left office, few people paid attention to this place.

The plan is always plump, but reality is always skinny. Xu Yanliang spent a few days in Sanya and deeply realized the meaning of this sentence.

"It seems that Sanya in the old spacetime wasn't an industrial and commercial city, and we don't have this magical power in this spacetime either," he said secretly.

Sanya in the old spacetime could engage in tourism and real estate, but these would be things at least a hundred years later in this spacetime. Besides, even if these could really be done locally, they had nothing to do with the Nanyang Company.

Xu Yanliang couldn't help but doubt the decision to set up the headquarters in Sanya. Speaking of advantages, it was probably that there was a good harbor locally, and housing and land were quite abundant. Also, the climate and scenery were pleasant.
