# Chapter 2355: Old Friend Li Huamei (Part 3)

"But according to the situation we grasp, she probably cannot pass the relevant background investigation—to be honest, not arresting her immediately is already very polite," Zhou Botao said.

"Naturally, we can't let her pass this background investigation," Zhao Manxiong said. "Draft a report to the General Office, list all relevant situations, mark it as 'Top Secret, Single Copy,' expressly for Director Xiao's reading only. After Xiao Zishan sees it, he will naturally talk to Qi Feng—after all, it is his job whether to approve the marriage or not."

"Can Qi Feng accept it?"

"If he doesn't accept it, the General Office won't issue him a marriage certificate either. No one can bear this responsibility." Zhao Manxiong said, "Let's consider how to 'disinfect' the situation."

Since both Li Mo and Li Huamei had contact with Li Siya, they were potential "dangerous elements." constrained by objective conditions, no action could be taken against them publicly. Therefore, other actions had to be taken to ensure the potential harm was reduced to a minimum.

"For the time being, this pair of sisters has no substantive harmful actions against the Senate. Moreover, judging from their usual performance, they are not treacherous people. So we don't need to be too nervous, worrying that they will commit some shocking crime. As long as the monitoring is in place to prevent any eventuality, it will be fine." Zhao Manxiong's words were the result of some consideration. "First, upgrade all surveillance on them to Level 1. Establish a special task force for the Li sisters."

"A special task force? Who will handle the case specifically?"

"Let Ke Yun be the team leader, but this task force only 'exists'."

"Understood." Zhou Botao understood tacitly. Neither the bureau nor Ke Yun had the energy and resources to handle a case with no substantive content, but with the existence of a task force, if any leaks occurred in the future, it could reduce their responsibility significantly.

"As for Li Mo, I think we may need to talk to Wu Nanhai and Director Deng Boyun of the Ministry of Health to get their cooperation. It is best to transfer Li Mo to a position that poses no threat to the Senators. Director Deng can handle the specific operation at his discretion. Of course, to obtain Elder Wu's understanding, the new position should preferably not be away from Lingao. At the same time, it is best to cut off the contact between them... Through what channel do they communicate now?"

"Through Qiwei. Li Siya rented a mailbox at the Qiwei Escort Bureau in Guangzhou through an agent." Zhou Botao said, "The simple and crude way is to intercept the letters directly through postal inspection."

"Keeping these letters might be a scourge for Li Mo in the future." Zhao Manxiong said, "As for Li Huamei, we must also try to cut off her contact with Li Siya—this is probably quite difficult. After all, she is a captain running all over the seas. The people we planted can't stop her..."

He thought for a moment: "I think we can recommend her to the Remote Exploration Department. Last time at the meeting, the Remote Exploration Department mentioned applying for a fast and flexible sailing ship capable of long-distance voyages, equipped with an excellent long-distance captain—I think Li Huamei and her *Hangzhou* are very suitable."

The Remote Exploration Department had long-term missions, and they went to places outside commercial routes, so Li Huamei would lose the possibility of contacting Li Siya through the Southeast Asian commercial network.

"That's a good idea! Let's do it this way. In addition, I have another view: whether to cut off contact or not may not matter much." Zhou Botao hesitated and said, "I have a feeling that Li Huamei and Li Siya are not of one mind. Li Huamei probably has had other intentions for a long time."

His reason was that Li Huamei had never mentioned to Li Siya her romance and current cohabitation with Qi Feng. It was hard to imagine that on such a major personal matter, Li Huamei actually didn't inform her "Miss" or "Sister"; it could be imagined that their relationship might not be that intimate.

"...There is one more thing, which was also discovered when monitoring her initially. The reason Li Huamei met Qi Feng was because she went to the Italian Trini's house, and she went to Trini's house to exchange gold. And every time she returned to Lingao afterward, she would go to Trini's house to exchange gold."

In Lingao, precious metals were prohibited from circulation and private exchange, but the Senate had a few fixed outlets that tacitly allowed their existence, considered officially recognized "gray industries." Trini was one of them. Here, gold could be exchanged for silver. Whether from plunder or trade income, Li Huamei had a part in gold, so it was excusable for her to often go to Trini's house to sell gold. Zhao Manxiong knew this didn't prove anything, so he listened patiently.

"...However, when she reported the accounts to her 'Miss,' the ratio of gold exchange was calculated according to our bank's exchange rate... Besides this, she obviously hid a lot of money..."

"So she had to dig that secret cellar."

"Exactly," Zhou Botao said. "I feel she may not be happy to be under Li Siya's control forever. It's just that the cooperative relationship between the two is still profitable now."

Zhao Manxiong pondered for a long time without speaking. Zhou Botao added: "Actually, the most thorough way is to make Li Siya disappear completely! In this way, all problems will be solved."

Come to speak of it, this was indeed a good way to cut the Gordian knot.

Zhao Manxiong shook his head: "This matter isn't that simple. We don't have armed forces ourselves; to do this, we have to ask the Reconnaissance Bureau to dispatch the Special Reconnaissance Team. If we want to intercept and kill her at sea, we need the Navy's cooperation. Her importance hasn't reached this level."

Li Siya was now drifting indefinitely; whether arresting or assassinating her would require a large investment of manpower and resources. With the resources of the Political Security Bureau, it was impossible to accomplish; it required authorization from the Senate.

"Besides, Li Siya is not alone; she controls a network behind her and is very familiar with many forces in the Southeast Asian seas. It would be a pity to eliminate her directly. It would be great if we could take over her network." Zhao Manxiong said, "The ideal way is to turn Li Huamei against her and use her. Let her become Li Siya's successor..."

"This, I'm afraid we have to lay our cards on the table with Li Huamei. I'm worried that Li Huamei will be frightened away, which would be troublesome—even if she doesn't run away, the subsequent work will be difficult to carry out." Zhou Botao reminded him, "For now, no discord has been found between the two, at most Li Huamei has some selfish motives for her own plans."

"No, the discord between them has long existed. If our speculation is correct: Li Mo and Li Chun are biological sisters. Li Siya clearly knows that both sisters are in Lingao, but has always concealed it from them, sitting by and even exploiting their separation..." Zhao Manxiong thought for a moment, then shook his head, "What you said also makes sense. Maybe the rift between them is not deep enough yet. Let's wait... You just execute according to the plan we discussed first."

Shortly thereafter, Li Huamei was "booked long-term" by the Remote Exploration Department, becoming one of their dedicated ships, frequently exploring and surveying in Taiwan, Ryukyu, and the Japanese archipelago; while Li Mo was transferred to the newly established Model Veterinary Station of the Nanhai Demonstration Farm as the Chief of General Affairs.

As for Qi Feng, naturally, he did not get the marriage permission. However, Xiao Zishan guaranteed that once "circumstances permit," he would be issued a marriage certificate retroactively.

"Anyway, it's no different from being married now; you get all the treatment you should have. It's just missing a document. When the time comes, we'll make it up to you with a grand wedding!"

Although Qi Feng was reluctant, after seeing some of the materials in the relevant report, he also knew that neither the PSB nor the General Office dared to open this door of convenience for him, so he had to wait for "circumstances to permit."

This matter temporarily came to a close. As soon as the application from the Nanyang Company Preparatory Committee to employ Li Huamei came out, this special case was back on track. The newly appointed Chief of Reconnaissance Division, Guo Yi, felt it necessary to talk to them.

Not long after Xu Yanliang's application was submitted, he received a call from the Political Security Bureau, asking him to come over for a "talk."

Xu Yanliang had dealt with every Senator in the PSB, but the voice on the phone today was unfamiliar:
"Director Xu, regarding the application report on Li Huamei you sent over, specific matters involve some circumstances that need to be explained in person. Sorry to trouble you to come over to talk; what time do you think is suitable?"

Judging from the tone and accent, this was definitely a Senator.

"Is it very serious?" Xu Yanliang suddenly became nervous.

"Not at all, let's talk when we meet."

Xu Yanliang understood that the PSB never discussed matters involving classified items and documents outside the bureau.

"Then let's make it one o'clock this afternoon."

Since transferring back from the Guangzhou Station, Guo Yi has been in a state of "semi-retirement." His main work was to cooperate with the commerce department on some tasks, and at the same time write a "work report" on his years in Guangzhou.

He had been in Guangzhou for nearly ten years, experiencing thousands of people and things. If not for his special work notes, many things and people would really be hard to recall. To be honest, although this work experience in Guangzhou gave him unforgettable memories, he was not nostalgic for it.

In the end, he was still an ordinary person. Although he handled the role of Proprietor Guo with ease, he didn't truly enjoy such a life. In the days in Guangzhou, every day was like acting—he could never integrate into the atmosphere of medieval society.

Now sitting behind the desk, flipping through the files and picking up his own trade again, he felt at ease in his heart. The knot that had been pressing on his heart for more than ten years was also untied—I am finally "one of us" now.

The file of the Two Li Special Case was personally handed to him by Zhao Manxiong, who also said some words that could not be recorded in the file. At the same time, he also talked about the consideration of turning her against the enemy between him and Zhou Botao back then.

"Of course, now you are the Chief of Reconnaissance Division; how to handle the case specifically is up to you to decide." Zhao Manxiong said, "My and Zhou Botao's opinions are purely for reference."
