# Chapter 2116 - Panic and Confusion

"But doing this, the Governor-General will lose the hearts of the people!"

"Hearts of the people? What good is that now?!" Chang Qingyun leaped to his feet and thundered: "This whole city of Wuzhou is seething with undercurrents. Every big or small household has probably prepared blue cloth and red paper, incense burners and candlesticks, ready to welcome the heavenly troops and become obedient subjects of the Great Song! The only one who doesn't know is the Governor-General himself!"

Yi Haoran answered: "What you say is true. Yet the sage taught: 'When the ruler treats his subjects like grass and weeds, the subjects treat the ruler like a bandit.' Ever since the soldiers entered the city, discipline has grown worse by the day. From the gentry to the common folk, all have suffered. They came to defend and protect the people, yet they've brought nothing but harm! Today's situation—isn't it of our own making?!"

Chang Qingyun's face was iron-hard, but he didn't interrupt. When Yi Haoran had finished, he asked: "Very well, then what brilliant plan does Master Yi have?"

At this, Yi Haoran was struck dumb. Every possible stratagem had already been tried. Wuzhou was truly at the end of its rope—nowhere left to turn.

If there was any way to save both the city and its people, it was only to open the gates and surrender.

Yi Haoran stood bewildered. He couldn't bring himself to say the word "surrender."

Chang Qingyun said nothing more. He rose and paced the room: "With the Changzhou and Bangshan positions lost, Wuzhou is cut off inside and out. The grain and supplies from Guilin Prefecture can't get through. In a moment, the soldiers in this city will be starving. If we don't seize the stored grain, are we waiting for them to mutiny? Having seized the civilians' grain, if we don't conscript the able-bodied men into militia and keep them under watch, aren't we afraid that among them agents will emerge and open the gates to the enemy as happened in Guangzhou? And leaving women, children, and the elderly inside—is it to let them starve to death in this doomed city, or to let them burn when it falls?"

"But outside the walls there may be nothing to eat. The Hair-Bandits have campaigned far from home—how much grain can they spare for refugees?"

"Aren't the Australians famous for their 'benevolence'?" Chang Qingyun said coldly. "Even if the civilians drink only gruel, the Hair-Bandits will consume quite a bit. Even if they take Wuzhou, they still won't have enough to eat. The Hair-Bandits may be formidable, but at most they can only hold this one city of Wuzhou. Guangxi will remain secure!"

Yi Haoran drew in a sharp breath. His mind went blank. A moment later, he recovered and cried out: "You still intend to burn the city?!"

"As things stand, the only option is for everything to perish together!" Chang Qingyun said. "We cannot hold it; the Hair-Bandits shall not have it either!"

"I demand to see Governor Xiong!"

Chang Qingyun said: "Governor Xiong is no longer in the city."

"What?!"

"Master Yi, please calm yourself." Chang Qingyun's tone was very mild. "The Governor-General is the viceroy of two provinces. What use is it for him to be trapped in Wuzhou? Naturally he must go out to direct the greater situation."

Yi Haoran felt a stab of disappointment. He had been the staff's rising star these past months—a clear "favorite" of Xiong Wencan's—and yet his patron had slipped away without a word, leaving him behind! Such callousness! More wounding still was the realization that his departure without Yi Haoran meant Xiong Wencan hadn't considered him important.

At least Chang Qingyun was also in the city, which slightly eased his feelings.

"Doesn't Master Yi want to defend Wuzhou to the death? I shall now share life and death with you. Ha ha ha, ha ha ha." Chang Qingyun let out a strange succession of laughs. "Come, let us have tea together…"

Meanwhile, Luo Yangming's mind was in turmoil. The other magnates who had been summoned to the banquet were frantic: not only their stores of grain, but their families too faced disaster—and they themselves would be trapped here. In the distance, screams echoed from time to time. Luo Yangming knew that the Ming soldiers were seizing grain from every household. Clearly the common folk's reserves were negligible; the soldiers had their eyes on the big merchants. Order was tottering; the leash on the rioters was slipping looser and looser. A catastrophe for the people was imminent!

He and Guild-master Qiao met with the guild heads of various trades in Master Qiao's residence. After deliberation, they reached a consensus. First: the banquet must not be attended—not only must they not go, they must do everything possible to warn nearby magnates not to go either. Going almost certainly meant being burned alive inside. Second: the headmen's militia units must be firmly controlled—they must not be swept up by the soldiers. Third: fire brigades throughout the city must ready their equipment. At the first sign of fire, they must move to extinguish it, with militia escort. Fourth: they must be prepared to fight the soldiers.

Despite their usual rivalries over business, the magnates were willing to cooperate now—after all, Wuzhou was their livelihood. Without much difficulty, they raised twenty thousand taels of silver to distribute among the garrison soldiers, constables, and militia, ensuring their loyalty when the moment came—or at least that they wouldn't join in the looting. At the same time, they promised the officers: if Wuzhou could be delivered safely to the Australians, there would be further rewards afterward.

At that moment, someone came to report that soldiers were directing the militia at the eastern and western gates to dig open the blocked gateways—apparently to expel civilians tonight.

"Once the gates are opened, the heavenly troops can enter. But it's already dark; the heavenly troops may suspect a trap and not attack."

"If only someone could risk his life to slip out of the city and make contact with the heavenly troops!" someone proposed.

The suggestion was sensible. Yet the magnates looked at one another, and no one volunteered. Slipping out to make contact wasn't hard—if you were willing to spend money, someone would certainly brave death to go. But to gain the Australians' trust, there must be some credential—inevitably a letter. If that fell into the soldiers' hands, it would be an instant disaster!

"I'll handle it!" With no other choice, Luo Yangming stepped forward. "I've done business with the Australian rice traders at Dachang. I've heard that Dachang is supplying the Australian army's provisions this time—I'm an old trading partner of theirs."

With someone volunteering, the magnates all relaxed and rushed to assure him: "Your wife and children—we will care for them as our own. Fear not."

Luo Yangming had no time to judge whether these pledges were sincere or hollow. He hurried out of Master Qiao's residence, bringing his servants, taking back alleys and side lanes, threading through deserted corners, rushing home.

The city was pervaded by an atmosphere of panic. On the main streets, many houses and shops had already been smashed open. Dead bodies lay in the streets from time to time; everywhere rose howls and weeping.

Luo Yangming couldn't afford to care about any of that. He hurried back to his shop, where his old manager Li Wensheng and Wen Tietou had been waiting anxiously. When they saw him return, they were overjoyed. Li Wensheng, already sixty and a longtime family retainer, immediately began to weep: "Master, the soldiers took all the rice from our warehouse! I couldn't save a single grain!"

Wen Tietou also looked sheepish, mumbling: "The soldiers were many, with swords and spears. I was alone… outnumbered…"

The rice depot Luo Yangming operated was, strictly speaking, property of the Council of Elders. Still, as the nominal merchant, losing so much rice pained him nonetheless. But now was not the time for recriminations. He said reassuringly:

"Let them take the rice if they want. These soldier-bandits won't be eating much rice for long! As long as people are safe, everything else can be worked out." He then instructed Wen Tietou to look after the family in the back courtyard and called Li Wensheng into the study.

Li Wensheng had originally been a clerk at Luo Yangming's rice shop in Sanshui. After the shop was seized, Li Wensheng had been left homeless. When Luo Yangming came to Wuzhou as an intelligence operative, he encountered the destitute Li Wensheng in Sanshui and recruited him again—an asset for running the Wuzhou rice depot. Though Luo Yangming never revealed any intelligence work to Li Wensheng, and rarely even mentioned his experiences in Lingao, he still trusted this old retainer who had watched him grow up—now his head clerk.

The old man was elderly—a doddering appearance—but "expelling the old and weak" would let him blend into the crowd without a problem. And his body was actually quite robust; he could still manage a trek through the mountains.

Luo Yangming wrote a letter in cipher and instructed Li Wensheng that when he got outside the city, he absolutely must deliver this letter to an Australian officer.

"If they won't let you see an Australian chief, tell them you have intelligence for the Australian chiefs. If that still doesn't work, say you were sent by 'Lone Wolf.' Just that one phrase—remember it well."

"Master, this old servant will not fail the mission. Only, after we part tomorrow, who knows when we'll meet again." The loyal old clerk wept as he spoke.

"We will meet again."

That evening, the Governor's yamen banquet to host the city's merchants saw almost none of the expected magnates or headmen. Only Guild-master Qiao came—and instead of coming alone, he brought a mob of commoners: several hundred people blocking the yamen gate to petition. Somehow the rumor had spread that Governor Xiong intended to burn the city, taking everyone—men, women, and children—down with it. The old and infirm knelt in the street, wailing, begging Governor Xiong to "have mercy on the people and surrender the city without bloodshed."

The news spread like wildfire; within half an hour, the entire city was in uproar. Wuzhou seethed with chaos; people ran through the streets like headless flies.

The commotion and tumult inside the city caught the attention of the Fubo Army's reconnaissance patrols outside the walls. They couldn't tell exactly what was happening inside. From the confessions of soldierswho had come out to surrender over the past few days, they knew the situation inside was unstable, order was collapsing. But exactly how chaotic it had become, and what the officials from Xiong Wencan on down intended to do—the surrendered soldiers knew little.

From those confessions, however, Zhu Mingxia had a rough idea that the soldiers might set fires once the city fell. This worried him greatly. Once the soldiers torched the city, Wuzhou might be destroyed, and the grain he had counted on requisitioning locally would go up in smoke. So after taking Bangshan, he immediately began deploying troops and preparing to attack—to seize Wuzhou as quickly as possible.
