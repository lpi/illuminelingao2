# Chapter 2330 - Going to Wuzhou (IX)

"... The first time Director Xie suggested sending a letter, I actually refused. I always felt he was a good person; even if he was Xiong Wencan's staff, he wouldn't do anything bad. Should give him a chance. This was completely my carelessness." Luo Yangming said with a tone of regret, "By the time it was sent the second time, the riot broke out before the reply came."

"An external investigation letter for Yi Haoran was sent from Wuzhou?" Chen Baibin felt strange because this matter wasn't mentioned in the case materials.

"I reported to Director Xie. Director Xie proposed sending a letter, I agreed. The letter was sent through Xie's Office."

He was a hidden cadre in Wuzhou. Except for secret reporting, he had no power to send official documents and had to go through other departments.

"That means you don't know whether the external investigation letter was sent or not?"

"Yes, I indeed haven't seen the letter. But there was indeed such a thing. Because I waited for the reply for a long time without result, I asked Director Zhao. Director Zhao even specially checked the reply registration book..."

"How long did you wait?"

"From Director Xie saying send the item to me asking, roughly half a month."

Ji and Chen looked at each other. This was fishy. Hard to say if this matter was forgotten by Xie Erren or Zhao Fengtian—of course, few people and many matters in Wuzhou, forgetting was excusable. But from Zhao Fengtian's action, the external investigation letter should exist.

Then how did it disappear?

"Talk about Cai Lan and Jiang Qiuchan."

"I don't know Cai Lan personally, only know her fiancé was a Ming scholar who died in Wuzhou. She went to assassinate Director Xie for revenge. Before and after this, I had no contact with her, nor can talk about any views."

"What role was she beside Xie Erren?"

Luo Yangming said: "She had no specific official duty, counted as Director Xie's maid-concubine. Usually living seclusively in San Zong Fu, almost never stepping out."

"What about Jiang Qiuchan?"

"She is my wife's boudoir close friend, usually discussing everything. Sometimes also picks up Ding Atao to stay at her home for a short time. Just a young lady of an ordinary merchant family. Nothing special. Later recommended by someone to enter San Zong Fu, said to be keeping Cai Lan company to relieve boredom. Her son Qi Liheng was sent to me every day, taught by Yi Haoran."

These situations were all they had mastered. Luo Yangming didn't provide any new situation either.

"Repeat the things that happened on the night of the riot again."

"Yes," Luo Yangming dared not neglect, thought carefully, and started from when he checked for the reply without result, Zhao Fengtian proposed arresting Yi Haoran, returning then Yi Haoran was arrested, detailing his personal experience and what he heard and saw that night.

Chen Baibin looked at Ji Xin. Ji Xin shook his head. Chen Baibin said: "Hard work for you today. You go to work first. Will find you for follow-up if there are things."

"Yes."

"Do you have any thoughts about your own work? Have you considered transfer or changing jobs?" Ji Xin suddenly asked.

"Everything listens to the Senate's arrangement. I personally have no special request."

As soon as Luo Yangming went out, Chen Baibin said: "Director Ji! This external investigation letter seems to be the key!"

Ji Xin nodded: "An external investigation letter involving Yi Haoran, why did Senator Xie keep it secretive? This is truly a strange thing!"

"Could it be Teng County sent a reply, but it was detained for some reason?"

"Why detain it? This doesn't make sense." Ji Xin said, "Senator Xie is a Senator, without any human relationship ties in this spacetime. He cannot have any connection with this Yi Haoran, let alone take this risk. If he wanted to protect Yi Haoran for some reason, why propose dragging him out (investigating him) twice?"

"We can easily check clearly the issue of the reply. Just send a letter to Teng County to investigate immediately." Chen Baibin said, "Actually checking the sending and receiving registration here can also find it."

"I'm afraid this registration is already incomplete." Ji Xin said, "Never mind, you go fetch it to check."

Chen Baibin went to the City Government immediately. The result was exactly as Ji Xin estimated. The sending and receiving registration book suffered collateral damage on the night of the riot; a part was destroyed. From the preserved part, there was no relevant registration number.

Next, they interrogated Zhao Fengtian. Zhao Fengtian's attitude was calm, answering relevant questions in full detail. When asked "What specific work was Cai Lan responsible for in San Zong Fu", Zhao Fengtian smiled and said:

"Chief, speaking of specific work, probably just serving Chief Xie."

Although the relationship between Cai Lan and Xie Erren was counted as "known to all" in Wuzhou, this City Government Secretary, Xie Erren's direct line cadre, was actually so frank, completely not speaking according to the report's tone, which was somewhat out of Chen Baibin's expectation. He originally thought there would mostly be some quibbling.

"Do you know that a status like Cai Lan remaining by the Senator's side is very dangerous? Also not compliant with regulations."

"I know." Zhao Fengtian said frankly, "But I cannot go against the Chief's will."

*Good guy,* Chen Baibin thought, *you dump the pot (shift blame) cleanly. Ji Xin considered for you in vain.*

"Since you worked by Senator Xie's side for a long time, definitely had more contact with Cai Lan. Talk about your view on her."

"A lonely and helpless little woman, what is there to say much." Zhao Fengtian sighed, "Speaking of which her background is also truly pitiful. 'Background drifting like duckweed in rain', just a bitter person drifting with the waves!"

"You are quite good at pitying fragrance and cherishing jade."

"No, no, I just sigh." Zhao Fengtian said, "Cai Lan in San Zong Fu, usually almost never went out. Except sometimes speaking a few words to Cai Lan (sic - probably meant Jiang Qiuchan or maid) beside her, sometimes didn't say a word all day. Pastime was just painting and playing chess. If Chief Xie went to her place, she served Chief Xie. If not, she didn't even go out of the main room, most quiet and duty-bound."

"Did she have contact with Senator Xie's documents?" Ji Xin suddenly asked.

"According to rules, Chief's documents are kept in the office. Carrying them around also requires putting in the confidential document box. All done according to rules."

"Did Senator Xie bring documents or confidential document box when going to Cai Lan's place?"

"No." Zhao Fengtian thought for a while, "At least I haven't seen it."

"Did you handle an external investigation letter about Hao Ran—that is Yi Haoran? Recipient should be Teng County Police Station."

"Handled." Zhao Fengtian nodded without hesitation, "This was what Director Xie instructed me to handle back then."

"And after handling?"

"Handed over to be sent according to process."

"Do you still remember the serial number?"

"This I definitely can't remember clearly. Too many documents handled every day."

"Are you sure this document was sent?" Ji Xin asked.

A trace of panic appeared in Zhao Fengtian's eyes, which didn't escape Chen Baibin and Ji Xin's eyes: "Should have been sent."

"Tell us what your document sending process is like?"

"All done according to the General Office's process." Zhao Fengtian said, "After drafting, hand to the leader of the corresponding department to sign agreement, hand to sending and receiving department to send."

"Who should have signed this external investigation letter?"

"It was Senator Xie who signed."

"Did he sign?"

"Should have signed." Zhao Fengtian looked blank, "If not signed, it would be returned to me. This is all recorded."

*Recorded my ass!* Chen Baibin thought, *your record books are destroyed to pieces.* He now confirmed in his heart: there was a ghost on this external investigation document!

"Who was responsible for document sending and receiving?"

"By right there should be a dedicated confidential clerk responsible, but naturalized cadres were insufficient in Wuzhou, so Senator Xie's Security Secretary was responsible for sending and receiving registration."

Ji Xin couldn't help smiling. Chen Baibin also smiled: Some people really died in time, died in the right place!

Zhao Fengtian showed a scared expression instead, saying: "Two chiefs, this... implies... is there anything funny?"

"Nothing, nothing." Chen Baibin patted Zhao Fengtian's shoulder, "You go back first."

The last one summoned was Zheng Ergen.

After he came in and saluted, he looked at Ji Xin eagerly, revealing a suspicious expression on his face.

Chen Baibin spoke a few sentences with him simply, finding a feeling of trembling with fear, walking on thin ice from him. Obviously, his cultivation was far inferior to Zhao Fengtian.

But the things he could know were inevitably much fewer than Zhao Fengtian. Chen Baibin simply asked him some things about Wuzhou's police work and the situation on the day of the riot, then asked about Yi Haoran's external investigation letter.

Zheng Ergen said he didn't know about the external investigation letter, but he handled the arrest of Yi Haoran that night.

"Who gave the order?"

"It was Director Zhao who ordered. He said this person had great suspicion. Protective detention first."

"Did he say what specific suspicion?"

"No."

"I see in the material, you later arrested Cai Lan too. Who gave the order?"

"Also Director Zhao."

"Why arrest her?"

"Said she might have collusion with rioting enemies. Later according to investigation she indeed had collusion with Yi Haoran—contacting through Jiang Qiuchan." Zheng Ergen said.

"Do you know the relationship between Senator Xie and Cai Lan?"

"Know, know." Zheng Ergen nodded repeatedly.

"Why not report to superiors?" Chen Baibin asked again, "Placing such a person by the Chief's couch side, the risk is very big."

"Chief! I am a small bureau director, how does a Senator's matter turn to me to interrupt?" Zheng Ergen put on a bitter melon face, "Senator's matters, I dare not mix in."

"How did you arrange her after Cai Lan was arrested?"

"Detained in the County Yamen Earth God Temple, guarded by special personnel."

"How did she die?"

"Hanged herself. She suffered quite some bitterness when we interrogated, probably couldn't endure the torture, fearing suffering in pieces again, simply ended it all." Zheng Ergen seemed afraid they wouldn't believe, added, "Remains haven't been buried yet, can open coffin for autopsy anytime..."

Chen Baibin thought *the result of autopsy, death by hanging is probably certain, just how she hanged is hard to say.*
