# Chapter 2396: Financing (Part 27)

"But this long-term plan definitely needs to be done, and done solidly. Get both the Finance Province and Administrative Affairs Yuan to approve it—the team can be understaffed, but we need to set up this framework first, to avoid disputes later."

Chu He finally understood. So this "smooth operator" had the idea of "staking a claim." Set up the framework first, mark this territory, to avoid complications down the road.

"Brilliant, brother!"

"Hehe, I wouldn't say brilliant. Just got squeezed enough these years to understand." Ren Youzi took out a box of cigars as he spoke. "Want one?"

"I don't smoke..."

Ren Youzi lit a cigar for himself, took a deep drag, and slowly exhaled. Only after a while did he say: "You, little brother, surely understand too. This securities exchange, stocks and bonds, essentially it's all about getting money for the Senate and Nanyang Company. This money? It's all under the beds of Guangzhou's old money. Our Senate particularly wants to save face and won't hold bayonets to force them to take it out, so we came up with this soft method."

"The problem is this method works well."

"Works well is works well, but this exchange—" Ren Youzi lowered his voice, "To be honest, whether it exists or not doesn't really matter."

Chu He was shocked, thinking: don't f***ing say all your true thoughts out loud! But since the other party said this, he was already being treated as "one of us." He immediately stated his position:

"Brother, you're seeing things from a high vantage point. But as you just said, whether it can be done or not aside, we first need to set up this framework..."

The two looked at each other and smiled. Ren Youzi continued:

"Actually, this fundraising, whether stocks or bonds—if you really set up a stall to sell them in this exchange, who the hell would buy! Even if some did, you couldn't sell hundreds of thousands. When it comes to fundraising, we still have to take the old road! In this Guangzhou city, Liu Xiang probably knows all the wealthy people who can put up money. Get the list and run through them one by one—even now, investment banking business requires roadshows. Don't find it troublesome, this is efficient. Besides, right now big households are also anxious to establish relations with the Senate, buy some peace. Buying a few thousand in bonds from you, isn't that like getting a certificate of allegiance? So they'll definitely buy, it's just a matter of how much. As for other people, we don't need to covet the middle class and lower class's bit of money right now, and with Great Ming's Gini coefficient, they don't have much money anyway. As for those new money, I know you, brother, are probably eyeing the Zhang family of walnut pastry, thinking their family is the typical example of rising under the Senate's support. Wanting to build on success, give them icing on the cake, create a spectacular demonstration effect. This isn't impossible, but in my view, this family isn't quite suitable: their money is basically all invested. They currently owe Delong loans. It's hard to get these people to invest money to support the southern expedition. It's not that they're unwilling—they really don't have the money."

Chu He lowered his head and thought, then said: "I indeed had this thought. I really didn't think the Zhang family's liquidity was so tight—their business is doing great!"

During Guangzhou's epidemic, merchants weren't having a good time, but Zhang Yu's family supplied the military and wasn't affected by the sharp decline in retail sales. Moreover, their new workshop was right outside the Great World, wasn't locked down, and had been steadily producing throughout the entire epidemic. So both production and sales were unaffected.

Ren Youzi exhaled a puff of smoke: "This is the benefit of being in the Cheka. We can see Delong's monthly financial reports. I've been paying attention to Delong's lending situation to Guangzhou city merchants over the past six months. The Zhang family has taken quite a lot of loans—if we're talking purely business, the Zhang family's company couldn't possibly get this much lending."

Now Chu He became somewhat nervous: "Is there a problem with these loans?"

"If we're talking about problems, it's that there's no collateral. They're basically all policy loans." Ren Youzi said, "Jin Zhijiao specifically mentioned this to me, asking me to pay more attention to the Zhang family's loan situation. So I specifically went to check. The usage is all normal—all used in areas like building factories, buying equipment and raw materials, expanding production. Then I went to Delong to check the specific approval process—basically all instructed by Old Hong."

"So you're saying Old Hong..."

"Right, it's Old Hong's intention. Otherwise, how would the Zhang family be set up as a model?"

"Damn, could it be that Zhang Yu has a good-looking sister? Or else Zhang Yu himself is very good-looking—"

"Not really," Ren Youzi looked at Chu He with slightly disdainful eyes. "Zhang Yu has no sisters, and he himself is just an ordinary young man. Wouldn't say he's particularly good-looking. Besides, Old Hong doesn't have that inclination."

"Now I really don't understand. Old Hong is that selfless? And Zhang Yu's surname isn't even Hong!"

"Little brother, how did you get by in the financial circle back then," Ren Youzi's eyes glittered. "This Zhang family might very well be the white glove Old Hong set up for himself."

"How did I forget this." Chu He made a "suddenly enlightened" expression and slapped his forehead. "Been away from the circle too long."

"So you see, never mind that the Zhang family doesn't have money right now. Even if they did, they shouldn't be allowed to ride this hot stove."

"Unless Old Hong comes forward himself..." Chu He said.

"If Old Hong really comes forward himself, this face must definitely be given." Ren Youzi said, then suddenly remembered something and added: "Also, the exchange's rule settings must be fair. I don't believe an exchange established with harvesting leeks as its aim can do well. If you really want to make quick money, just open a casino, do horse racing, or at worst run a lottery. But if you want to play long-term, you need to let the first batch of investors make money to have a demonstration effect, to let the wealthy landowners from all over Guangdong and Guangxi see the opportunity and pour in to invest. If they have concerns during the first fundraising, we can also do tranching, with priority and subordinated shares. Senators put up the subordinated, give the local tycoons priority protection. That way, even if it's just for face, they'll put up the money."

"That's natural. Even farming requires fertilizer."

The "First Guangzhou Exchange Work Meeting" concluded successfully. Chu He saw Ren Youzi off, thinking: since such a special person as Zhang Yu was mentioned, why not go take a look at his shop. Zhang family walnut pastry is quite famous now. He'd been admiring the name for a long time. Whether their family could participate in the stock offering or not in the end, it wouldn't hurt to do some research first.

Going to research wasn't difficult, because currently Zhang Family Walnut Pastry had a store in the Great World, and their workshop wasn't far from the Great World either.

Since Zhang Family Walnut Shop got Delong's loan, they wanted to expand production. The main shop was in a busy market area, and even though they had moved their residence away, space was limited. In comparison, the storefront here at the Great World was much larger, and there was lots of vacant land outside that could be developed. So they purchased land outside the city to build their workshop, and the center of production shifted outside the city.

"Little Piao!" he called.

Park Jihyun immediately appeared at the doorway and asked: "Chief!"

"Do you know where Zhang's shop is?"

"It's right in the Great World. I went to buy some just a few days ago. The taste is really good." Park Jihyun saw him asking. "If Chief wants some, I'll go buy it right now."

"No need for you to buy. I want to go look at the shop."

"I'll arrange contact right away!" Park Jihyun said, about to turn and go find Manager Gao.

"Hey hey, no need, no need. Just the two of us will go take a look." Chu He looked at his own clothes. "Bring me one of your cadre uniforms."

He was wearing the Senator-exclusive cadre uniform specially provided by Store 82. Although the style was no different from what naturalized cadres wore, the materials were worlds apart. A special fabric made from cotton thread mixed with wool, comfortable to wear and very crisp. The tailoring was also made-to-measure by a tailor, not mass-produced by a garment factory.

"Chief, you're going incognito?" Park Jihyun's brain turned quickly.

Chu He laughed: "You're the quick-witted one! If I go to the Great World like this, it won't be very convenient."

"Even if you wear my clothes, once you walk into the Great World, people will still recognize you're a Senator—this bearing isn't something ordinary people have, just as the moon stands among the stars..."

"Alright, stop finding different ways to flatter me." Chu He said this, but his heart still enjoyed it. "Don't say more, hurry and bring a set over."

After changing clothes, Chu He and Park Jihyun came from the special passage "Inner World" to the "Outer World." The "Outer World" of Zhang's Great World was originally designed according to another spacetime's SHOPPING MALL. Except for lacking sufficient steel and cement, resulting in fewer floors and no huge hollow atrium, the basic business model was completely the same.

The only difference in operations was that although the shops in the Great World were also rented out, more than half of the various shops inside were opened by the Senate itself. Besides selling goods, they were more for cultural and shop promotion—"new life," "new culture."

They went out through an inconspicuous small door and arrived at the "Outer World," which was the Great World's outer plaza. A four-story brick-and-concrete "giant" building with a clock tower and large glass roof stood in the center of the plaza—this was the Great World Department Store.

However, Zhang's Pastry Shop wasn't inside this mall, but in the three-story long building surrounding the entire plaza. This building used to exist as the Great World's wall. The first floor on the outside had no windows; all doors and windows faced the plaza. Only the second floor and above had outward-facing windows. Merchants could only operate within the first-floor storefronts, not go up to the second floor. However, with the liberation of Guangzhou, the Great World's military significance had become minimal, and the second floor and above could now also be rented out.

There were very few people in the outer plaza—Guangzhou hadn't fully recovered from this disaster yet, and commerce was depressed. Without spare money, naturally no one had the mood to come see "Australian scenery."

"The market is still sluggish." Chu He saw the sparse crowds and couldn't help worrying secretly. A sluggish market would seriously affect commercial confidence. People would tend not to spend money—not only consumers but investors too.

In this atmosphere, whether stock offerings or bond issuance, both would face severe tests. If his group's optimistic calculations resounded loudly but financing failed in the end, and they had to resort to mandatory apportionment, that would be a major embarrassment.
