# Chapter 2184 - Fight Alone

"I don't think it's that simple. I've seen this type before." Li Dong's combat experience showed. "Others sharpen in battle—these men deteriorate. They'll be casualties soon enough."

"The more afraid, the more mistakes. Mistakes lead to wounds."

"If he's wounded, we'll declare him medically unfit and discharge him."

"Agreed. Let's hope he has that luck."

Dawn had barely broken when the high-pitched, rapid bugle blast jolted Li Dong from fitful sleep. His blood ran cold—the "Enemy Attack" call.

He threw off his blanket and scrambled up, buckling his belt while running for the breastwork. The camp erupted in controlled chaos. Soldiers with disheveled uniforms jammed hats on their heads, grabbed rifles, and sprinted to designated positions.

Li Dong climbed the lookout tower they'd built last night from excavated earth. Luo Mao was already there. Seeing him arrive, he immediately indicated the threat.

"About three hundred. Not government troops."

Li Dong raised his telescope. Mountains blocked the rising sun, but as dawn light crossed the peaks and burned away the morning mist, it exposed figures that had crept close under night's cover. Hundreds of men and horses massed before the mountain pass—over three hundred at rough count. More kept pouring onto the small plain, seemingly endless. Close inspection showed most wore no armor and flew miscellaneous banners. Weapons and clothing were chaotic—definitely not government troops.

"See that dust cloud behind? Follow-up forces."

"Quick, report to Company Commander Wu in town!"

"Wuzhou Squadron, on me! Move!"

"Rifle team, fall out!"

Commands overlapped in rapid succession. Disheveled officers raced about, gathering equally bleary-eyed soldiers into formation.

*Could it be those stubborn Yang Family Village braves from yesterday?* Prisoner interrogations suggested they could field these numbers. But they'd suffered two defeats yesterday, losing nearly two hundred men. Too late for retreat and rest—how could they resume attacks on Shijian?

He studied the terrain. Their position was dangerously exposed. The Wuzhou Squadron stood isolated at Tangzaijiao in the far north. Right flank: mountainous terrain. Left flank: the National Army Guangning Battalion's 1st Squadron, deployed along Shijian Levee backing Banbian Gang (Half-Side Hill). The road between formed the junction of both squadrons.

Li Dong knew the Guangning 1st Squadron all too well—a newly formed unit with few veterans and masses of recruits. With even more green troops than the Wuzhou Squadron, their combat effectiveness was questionable at best.

The Fubo Army 8th Battalion concentrated in Shijian Town behind them, with logistics and civilian personnel massed at Tougang (Head Hill) where the Sui River bent.

"Putting us on the forward line—what is Battalion Commander Yang thinking..." Luo Mao whispered.

"Quiet! Focus on observation."

Li Dong cut off his subordinate's complaint. He understood Yang Zeng's deployment perfectly: standard defensive doctrine placed weaker troops on the first line to absorb enemy momentum. When the attack stalled and lost impetus against first-line resistance, elite second-line troops would counterattack.

Brilliant in theory. Brutal for those absorbing "kinetic energy" on the first line—heavy casualties, sometimes total annihilation.

*So we National Army are still "cannon fodder."* The thought rankled, but Li Dong expelled this "less than absolute loyalty" from his mind and shouted orders. "Messenger! Contact the 1st Squadron leader. Tell him to watch the junction—prevent a central breakthrough!"

After speaking, he lowered the telescope and spotted Ai Buyi cowering beneath the lookout tower, nervously watching outside. He barked, "You! What's wrong? Why aren't you with your squad?"

"Re... port..." Ai Buyi's articulation failed. "I... can't find the squad leader..."

Li Dong looked around. Ai Buyi's squad deployed on the right flank near the mountains. He pointed. "Right there. Go quickly!"

Ai Buyi acknowledged, grabbed his rifle, and started running. Li Dong suddenly realized his messenger had just left—he needed someone close for dispatch. This Ai Buyi wouldn't contribute much in the squad anyway. He called him back. "You! Don't return. Stay with me!"

Li Dong moved toward the left flank junction to prevent central breakthrough. He saw Ai Buyi nearby, clutching his rifle and trembling, looking soul-lost. He shouted loudly, "When I inspect later, nothing better be in that gun barrel!"

He turned his attention to the armed forces gathering a *li* distant—over five hundred now. These suddenly appearing enemies carried only simple swords and spears; no firearms visible. Their formation lacked cohesion—perhaps fearing the "Hair Men's" repeating guns, they stood very sparse. Overall, they seemed composed of many small groups with weak coordination. Some rushed forward impatiently, then retreated seeing others didn't follow.

Luo Mao appeared suddenly. "Squadron Leader! I think this gang looks like Yao people!"

"How do you know?"

"A new recruit said so. He's *Lang* (Zhuang) and fought Yao before!"

"The clothing doesn't match..."

"There are Han among them too—probably bandits. He says when Yao rebel, they sometimes act with Han bandits."

"Doesn't matter who they are. Those attacking us are enemies." Li Dong drew his command sword and shouted, "All squads, steady! No firing without orders!"

This enemy force definitely exceeded what their two squadrons of two hundred could handle. Battalion Commander Yang wanted them to "defend firmly and await reinforcements"—so they would die defending here, waiting for the Fubo Army's countercharge.

"Afraid there'll be heavy fighting today," he told Luo Mao.

"At worst, throw our lives away here." Luo Mao smiled, obviously not expecting to die. Ai Buyi beside him thought otherwise, trembling violently.

Li Dong had no energy to scold Ai Buyi. As commander, his only hope was that the Fubo Army's counterattack would come quickly—otherwise, his brothers faced inevitable heavy casualties. He watched nervously as enemies kept arriving more than a *li* away.

Fortunately, the enemy hadn't committed to attack yet. Just when both sides stood in standoff and the situation teetered on breaking, change came—seeing the enemy multitude, the Guangning 1st Squadron on their left flank took it upon themselves to withdraw from Shijian Levee, retreating toward Banbian Gang to rely on Shijian's stockade wall and gain fire support from the Fubo Army in town. This exposed the entire Wuzhou Squadron's left flank to the enemy.

"Who the hell ordered them to retreat!" Li Dong nearly died of rage. "Ai Buyi! Chase them down. Find their squadron leader. Tell them to return!"

Ai Buyi ran after them. Li Dong shouted, "All units! Steady! Prepare to fire!"

"Let's withdraw too!" Luo Mao looked worried. "Fall back to Banbian Gang and form line with 1st Squadron."

"With 1st Squadron withdrawn, we're the rearguard." Li Dong smiled bitterly. "Now if I order withdrawal, you think the whole squadron won't collapse?"

The 1st Squadron could retreat in good order because friendly forces stood behind them—no fear of pursuit. Behind them, however, lay nothing. Soldiers had no psychological security. Once the enemy charged, the whole squadron would probably break.

"Ill fortune then." Luo Mao fixed bayonet to rifle. "I'll take a squad to the left flank."

"Good. Don't throw your life away..."

Li Dong walked along the breastwork, shouting encouragement to "hold position." But facing the massive pressure of being outnumbered, men couldn't help wanting escape. The entire battle line began wavering. The Yao people saw the defense wavering. They seized the opportunity. Gongs and drums thundered through the enemy array—they launched a full-line charge.

Rumbling footsteps echoed through the valley, but the rifle team stood motionless—they hadn't heard Li Dong's order yet. In Li Dong's eyes, even by National Army standards, the enemy formation was too loose. The already sparse column stretched even more open once they ran. Moreover, they'd launched their charge while still a *li* from the breastwork—halfway through, their speed slowed.

"Steady... steady...!" The sergeants kept repeating Li Dong's order. Then the first volley of arrows launched from the enemy mass.

"Hug the breastwork! Heads down!"

The National Army lacked steel helmets—they could only duck low, pressing against earthworks. This shielding proved effective; no one was hit under the swishing arrow rain.

Malay's head nearly drilled into the earthen wall. He gripped his rifle tight. The sound of arrows cutting air terrified him, and their landing sounds nearly drove him mad. When four or five arrows impaled the ground less than two *zhang* away almost simultaneously, he nearly lost his wits.

Fortunately, eight weeks of training had made him regard discipline as god—he dared not move. Moments later, a second arrow volley fell.

Li Dong crouched behind the breastwork observing the enemy's advance. They showed no impatience—the main body spread out and slowly approached the breastwork, with archers behind firing arrows in rotating ranks. The command looked quite methodical.

One hundred meters. Eighty meters. When the enemy entered fifty-meter range and the 5th Squadron (Wuzhou) brothers could clearly see enemy faces, they finally heard the captain's order: "Sight fifty meters! Ready, aim!"

Commands shouted in unison by NCOs. The rifle team impatiently aimed their loaded rifles at the enemy. The shorter second rank extended muzzles through gaps in the front rank to avoid deafening comrades—at this distance, even Nanyang rifle accuracy couldn't miss. Li Dong glanced at Ai Buyi, drew his machete, and chopped down forcefully. "Fire!"
