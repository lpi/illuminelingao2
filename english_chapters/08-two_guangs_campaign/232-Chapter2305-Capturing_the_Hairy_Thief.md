# Chapter 2305 - Capturing the Hairy Thief

Xie Erren’s face turned pale. As a reporter, he had seen his share of scenes, but this was his first time having a blade pressed directly against his chest—unlike the posturing "cutting people" of the old spacetime, these natives would truly drive a white knife in and pull a red knife out.

"Is this the Xie bandit?" another man in black walked over and asked.

"That's right, it's him." The small, wiry man managed Xie Erren. "This appearance, this attire, and the pistol in the drawer—only a True Kun has these." With that, he took Xie Erren's revolver and ammo box from the drawer and casually tucked them into his waist.

Xie Erren was terrified, barely maintaining his composure. Although this small man spoke with a slight accent, it was the "New Language" that only naturalized citizens spoke. He remembered that when they first entered Wuzhou, Xu Ke had warned him: there were very likely traitors in the Ming army. Seeing this man not even stopping to look at the pistol but tucking the revolver directly into his waist with practiced movements, he was clearly not a native...

Meanwhile, Jiang Suo searched every pocket on his body, not even sparing his toilet paper. Only then did they bind Xie Erren with ropes, gag his mouth with a walnut, and hood his head. For a moment, Xie Erren's world went dark; he only knew someone was dragging him from the front, and he could only stumble along.

Song Ming wanted to search the office to see if there were any confidential letters, but Jiang Suo warned that once gunshots rang out, the bandits' reaction speed would be very fast, and people would arrive shortly—Wuzhou City was small, and this place was close to both the Great and Small South Gates. Once the Australians reacted, these few dozen men wouldn't be able to withstand them.

Song Ming thought so too, but having come here, he couldn't return from a treasure mountain empty-handed. Regardless of the consequences, he swept everything in Xie Erren's drawer into a bag and shouldered it all. Only then did he sprint toward the back courtyard.

They left just in time. At the sound of the gunshot, Qian Duo, who was observing enemy activity at the Great South Gate, was startled: Gunfire in the city! And it wasn’t from bird guns or firelocks, but the sound of Nanyang rifles!

Judging by the loudness and direction of the gunshot, the shooting had occurred in the southern city, near the County Yamen or Prefectural Yamen!

Qian Duo broke out in a cold sweat. If the Prefectural Yamen was attacked, it would be a disaster! He immediately summoned a sergeant to take a squad to the Prefectural Yamen to check the situation.

The gates of the Prefectural Yamen were tightly shut, showing no abnormalities, but the sentries at the door were missing, and the side gate was wide open. Knowing something was wrong, the sergeant immediately ordered:

"Fix bayonets, prepare to fire!"

The squad made brief preparations and burst into the front courtyard through the side gate—the courtyard was empty. The sergeant ordered men to open the main gate while sending point men to search. After only a few steps, they found the bodies of two sentries at the entrance to the service lane leading to the Second Hall; one had been hit by a crossbow bolt, the other hacked down.

Knowing the situation was grave, the sergeant immediately sent someone back to inform Qian Duo while leading his men to search further inside.

Entering the main hall of the second courtyard, they found four or five more bodies in the yard. Among them were men from the "Guard Squad" as well as unidentified men in black. Blades, spears, and weapons were scattered all over the ground.

"These fledglings!" the sergeant muttered. A major incident had occurred at the county office; he could no longer care about "caution." He roared directly:

"Fire!"

"We can't!" A soldier beside him grabbed his arm. "The Chief might be inside."

The sergeant cried out that it was a close call. If a volley went in and injured the Elder, his whole family would be executed! He immediately raised his rifle and fired a shot into the sky, shouting, "Charge!"

Unexpectedly, as soon as they rushed into the courtyard, they were met with a chaotic volley of fire. Two men were hit on the spot. Then, with strange screams, more than ten men in black charged out from the flower hall and the corridors. The Volte Army soldiers didn't have time to fire; both sides immediately fell into melee combat.

Most of the Volte Army soldiers had served for years and were skilled in bayonet fighting. Although they lost two men at the start and were at a disadvantage, they immediately grouped in twos and threes, back-to-back, and fought bayonets against the enemy.

Those ambushing them were Song Ming's family retainers and personal guards, the most ferocious and brave. Having stayed behind as the rearguard, they had long harbored the will to die. Each fought with disregard for their own life, fighting to the death. For a moment, neither side could do anything to the other.

During the stalemate, Zhu Si charged back with the Guard Squad. The soldiers Song Ming left behind as the rearguard could not hold out; they were either killed or captured. Zhu Si broke into the office and saw it was a mess. The security secretary lay dead on the spot. His jaw dropped in shock—the Chief was gone!

A commander lost—whether killed or captured—carried consequences that Zhu Si, having served in the Great Ming army, knew all too well. He didn't know how the Australians would handle it, but an Elder's status was obviously far more illustrious than a Great Ming Governor-General or Provincial Governor; at the very least, it was on the level of a Prince of the Blood.

Thinking of this, his hair stood on end. He immediately ordered a search of the entire Yamen and sent men to report to Qian Duo and Zhao Fengtian.

The searching soldiers quickly discovered the bodies of several guards killed in the back courtyard. The back gate was wide open; clearly, they had fled through there.

Zhu Si's eyes glared blood-red. He dragged over a captive who had been heavily wounded by bayonets and asked, "Who are you?! Where have you taken the Chief?"

The captive had been stabbed in the abdomen, intestines spilling out. He was clearly beyond saving. Gasping for breath, he laughed, "What if you know..." With that, his head tilted, and he died.

Zhu Si was so angry he hacked wildly at the corpse with his sword. Neither Xie's body nor any sign of him had been found in the courtyard or halls, so he had clearly been abducted by this group. Judging by their combat power and weapons, they were by no means ordinary bandits, but elite government troops. This raid into the city was well-prepared.

Zhu Si organized men to track and pursue, while sending others to beat the drums at the Bell and Drum Tower to signal a city-wide Level One Alert—this told all naturalized personnel and retained indigenous staff in the city: There are enemies in the city!

According to the prior contingency plan, upon entering alert status, all defense zones would go on full alert, and the reserve team at the Three Generals' Office would immediately conduct a city-wide dragnet search in coordination with the Detective Team to hunt down the enemy.

But now the plan deviated slightly because of the troop shortage. Neither Zhu Si nor Qian Duo had any reserves to speak of. Zhu Si was anxious as a headless fly. Just as he was helpless, Qian Duo and Zhao Fengtian arrived.

"What is the situation?"

"The Chief is missing!" Zhu Si said in fear and trepidation. "I've sent people to track them, I don't know if it's too late..."

Qian Duo cursed fiercely, "No wonder! So the enemy was making a feint to the east while attacking the west!" He thought for a moment and raised his head. "The situation is clear now. The enemy has no intention of attacking Wuzhou. I will gather the whole company immediately and launch a city-wide search! Even if we have to dig three feet into the ground, we must find the Chief!"

Zhao Fengtian felt these words were ominous and hastily said, "No need to dig three feet. It's been fifteen minutes at most from the gunshot to now. The enemy hasn't gone far. Surrounded by city walls, they can't run away either!"

The three of them assigned tasks on the spot. Zhao Fengtian would stay at the Prefectural Yamen to handle the aftermath, Zhu Si would go to the Great South Gate to be responsible for defense, and Qian Duo would take his company to search the city.

"...Battalion Commander Zhu, send out everyone from the Detective Team immediately. Tell them: Anyone who finds traces of the enemy will be rewarded with ten taels of silver; anyone who finds traces of Chief Xie, twenty taels; and anyone who rescues Chief Xie, one hundred taels," Zhao Fengtian said.

The Detective Team was composed entirely of retained personnel. At such a critical juncture, they might not be willing to exert themselves to the death; they could only be driven by heavy profit.

As the three split up to act, Zhao Fengtian stomped his feet and sighed, even contemplating suicide. At this moment, Zheng Ergen also arrived, his face full of panic.

"Why was there shooting? Why was the Detective Team sent out all at once..."

"Something big has happened!" Zhao Fengtian explained the situation, and Zheng Ergen's face turned white too—wasn't this a huge matter! He stammered, "Chief Xie... Chief... won't... won't have anything happen to him, right..."

"The Chief is a lucky man and has heaven's help," Zhao Fengtian comforted him. "Besides, they weren't in the Prefectural Yamen for long. It won't be that easy for them to run out in the dark."

"I hope so, I hope so..." Zheng Ergen murmured, then suddenly remembered something. "That Advisor Hao, he's probably the ringleader!"

"Even if he isn't, he must be involved." Zhao Fengtian suddenly thought that the major suspects, Cai Lan and Jiang Qiuchan, had not been arrested and were still in the Three Generals' Office. These two weak women couldn't escape, but with such a big commotion outside, they might very well commit suicide...

He immediately said, "Old Zheng, take men to the Three Generals' Office immediately. Arrest Cai Lan, Jiang Qiuchan, and all the servants in the courtyard—anyone who has had contact with Cai Lan. We must prevent anyone from committing suicide!"

The explosion had sounded when Luo Yangming had already returned to his residence. Because he was worried, he didn't go to his room to rest but dozed in his study instead.

The explosion outside the city woke him immediately. Luo Yangming threw on his clothes and stood by the window to look out. Hearing the intermittent cannon fire, his heart tightened: What was happening?!

This cannon fire didn't sound like Volte Army artillery—it was more muffled and dull, obviously the sound of government firearms. Could it be Xiong Wencan counterattacking? That was obviously impossible...

Although full of doubts, he was a HID (Hidden Intelligence Division) cadre and could not run to the Prefectural Yamen to ask about the situation at will, nor could he attend meetings without authorization. He could only pace in his study, waiting for news.

Solely from the sounds outside, the situation seemed somewhat critical—not only did he hear cannon fire, but also the whistle of signal rockets crossing the sky, followed by gunshots.

The gunshots worried him in particular; this indicated the enemy had approached the city walls.

Everyone in his home and shop had been awakened by the sound of guns and cannons. No one dared to light a lamp. One by one, they put on clothes and quietly came over to ask.

"I also don't know what the situation outside is," Luo Yangming comforted everyone. "It's probably a sneak attack by the Ming army. It's nothing serious. Don't be afraid."

"Oh Heavens, oh Buddha," Ding Atao's hair was disheveled, and her eyes were teary. "If the Great Ming army retakes Wuzhou, and the government investigates that you worked for the Australians, Master, what will we do?!" With that, she began to weep.

Li Wensheng hurriedly comforted her, "Mistress, don't worry. There are plenty of big shots in the Rehabilitation Bureau; even if the sky falls, they will hold it up. Besides, the Ming Kingdom might not be able to fight its way back."
