# Chapter 2165 - Post-Battle Summary

"So—has everyone eaten?" Li Dong asked with a smile.

"Reporting to Captain, we've all eaten!" the sergeant major acting as deputy commander replied crisply.

Li Dong issued his order: "Conduct post-battle summaries by squad!"

"Yes, sir!"

Post-battle summaries constituted mandatory protocol under General Staff "Combat Regulations." Absent urgent follow-on missions, commanders conducted comprehensive combat reviews after each engagement—squad-level analysis compiled into company reports for battalion submission.

The practice served dual purposes: first, consolidating lessons learned while identifying operational and training deficiencies; second, fostering soldier participation and cultivating independent combat awareness.

Li Dong settled by the fire alongside Yang Erdong and the others. They rose reflexively.

This reflex wasn't merely old-army conditioning. Even within the Fubo Army system, the hierarchical gulf between officers and enlisted remained an emphasized absolute authority.

"Relax. Sit down." Li Dong gestured dismissively. "We fought all day. You must have thoughts. Let's hear them."

Luo Mao was a veteran. Seeing Li Pudun and others looking bashful and reluctant to speak, he smiled. "I'll start. Captain, your command today was brilliant..."

"Skip that part," Li Dong interrupted with a laugh, nudging him with his boot. "Save the flattery for after we return. Talk about your direct impressions."

"Biggest impression—our equipment's inadequate." As corporal squad leader wielding a Nanyang rifle, Luo Mao had witnessed the spearmen's awkward performance throughout the day.

"Spears don't lose ground in close combat on open terrain. But today's landscape—all these hills and trees—spears proved cumbersome. Not nearly as practical as machetes."

The observation immediately resonated:

"Constantly snagging passing through woods."

"Burden on long marches."

"Especially awkward climbing or crossing water. Rifles sling across the back."

Yang Erdong watched everyone speaking enthusiastically. He wanted to address rifles too, but hesitated. Instead, Li Pudun stammered:

"I also have a thought. Can't we receive more of these bird guns—Nanyang rifles? This weapon's genuinely effective, but currently we've only twenty-odd rifles total. Sometimes during combat it's frustrating..."

This ignited everyone's emotions. Regarding why the National Army lacked rifle equipment, many had harbored unspoken thoughts for considerable time. Many of these soldiers were Ming army veterans who'd initially disliked firearms—primitive weapons boasted weak power, poor usability, and frequent accidents. They'd felt indifferent about lacking rifles, considering spears more reliable. But actual battlefield experience instantly revealed the Nanyang rifle's combat performance advantages. Particularly, every rifleman volley could instantly suppress enemy momentum and shatter formations—far superior to arrows or spear thrusts. Especially coordinating with Mi Longtao's forces, the Fubo Army's firepower output and combat effectiveness exceeded theirs severalfold, making these common soldiers secretly envious. *This* was real combat! Originally they'd thought avoiding dangerous firearms was preferable—now carrying spears felt inferior.

"The Fubo Army's fully equipped with rifles, naturally. But other National Army units have guns too—among the hundreds of men in Xugang, we're the only ones without!"

"Even the Li tribesmen have matchlocks! We're worse equipped than them!"

Seeing everyone talking over each other, Yang Erdong found courage. He

 considered momentarily, then raised his hand. "Why not issue me a firelock? During this morning's river battle, I spotted the enemy—but without a firelock in hand, unable to shoot with just a spear, I could only watch helplessly as enemy archers shot first. With a firelock, I could've eliminated those archers. Several brothers wouldn't have taken arrows."

"Fine sentiment—but would you even know how to operate one if issued?" a soldier nearby asked deliberately, provoking general laughter.

Yang Erdong stiffened his posture. "Of course I can operate one! I used them serving as house guard for Governor Xiong—no, Xiong Wencan. Even practiced extensively."

Li Dong looked surprised. "You're trained on Nanyang rifles?"

"Yes!" Yang Erdong displayed evident pride. "I learned in Xiong Wencan's house guard squad. During assessments, three hits from five shots. Even learned some Ausländer... er, foreign foot drills from Advisor Yi."

"You served as house guard!"

"Xiong Wencan's house guard at that!"

"Isn't Xiong Wencan a high-ranking Ming official? How would he possess Ausländer rifles?"

Li Dong raised his hand, silencing the discussion. "I've heard everyone's input. I'll relay it upward. But the rifle matter requires time. The Senate can't manufacture limitless Nanyang rifles instantaneously. How long has our unit existed? Tens of thousands of National Army soldiers are organizing across Guangdong. Even allocating twenty rifles per squadron means thousands upon thousands total."

Various suggestions followed. In the old army, even low-ranking officers rarely discussed campaign success or failure before generals—"strategy" remained supervisors' and commanders' exclusive domain. Consequently, this practice simultaneously intrigued soldiers while sparking discussion enthusiasm. From rifles, conversation shifted to personal equipment—many soldiers advocated for armor.

"We exclusively wield spears, possess no bows or arrows. When enemies launch arrow barrages, several comrades get wounded simultaneously. Iron armor or cotton armor would dramatically improve survival—at minimum, a single arrow wouldn't prove fatal." A veteran combat soldier spoke.

"Precisely. Battle-experienced brothers know the adage: three arrows don't match one blade. Armor protection means as long as vital organs aren't struck, fighting continues even with seven or eight arrows embedded. Currently, wearing only uniforms, one arrow means half-dead."

Regarding armor, Li Dong had heard soldier complaints repeatedly. He'd served several years, participated in numerous battles, yet never considered armor particularly important. However, during his service, troops carried rifles rather than spears. Combat meant suppressing enemies with vigorous long-range firepower. Conversely, these National Army soldiers charged enemy formations directly without adequate suppression—casualties from arrows proved inevitable.

Still, he refrained from refuting or explaining, permitting soldiers to speak freely. Most discussions proved essentially worthless—but Li Dong possessed sufficient experience recognizing summaries meant panning gold from chaotic rubble. Luo Mao contributed sparingly, notebook and pencil in hand, occasionally recording notes and adding observations.

While the summary meeting proceeded, a military conference convened in the Xu Ancestral Hall.

Participants included Mi Longtao, Zhu Si, and newly arrived detachment commander Lieutenant Li Shenggang.

Li Shenggang and Mi Longtao were training corps classmates—both officers rapidly promoted during the Guangdong campaign. Predominantly veterans with extensive service records, having served as sergeants, experienced in combat and troop leadership.

Li Shenggang's unit had originally targeted Lianzhou. Shortly after departing Sanshui, they'd received new orders: "Intelligence indicates major enemy operations imminent within Fengchuan and Yu'nan county borders. Abort original mission immediately. Proceed to Yu'nan County and await orders."

Similar directives arrived via Fengchuan County messengers. Headquarters had obviously obtained significant intelligence.

"Comrades." Mi Longtao, being most senior among present officers, temporarily commanded the mixed force as frontline commander. "You've all reviewed South China Army Forward Command orders. Intelligence suggests the enemy will launch major combat operations against Yu'nan County, preparing to capture the county seat decisively. Consequently, Forward Command ordered the Yu'nan County Garrison to prepare for combat, defending the county seat and surrounding strongholds firmly. As mobile forces, we must somehow encircle and destroy this enemy concentration."

Immediate stirring arose. Since the Yao rebellion's commencement, several county seats surrounding Yao territories had fallen. However, those settlements had merely submitted recently to Senate authority; government troops possessed weak fighting spirit, facilitating easy capture. Yu'nan County, conversely, constituted a West River county seat—critical for ensuring smooth West River waterway passage, a key defensive support node along communication lines. Each such county seat garrisoned at minimum one National Army squadron, equipped with naturalized cadre working teams, maintaining ample ammunition and provisions. Recently, escalating tensions triggered secondary emergency reinforcements; new supplementary squadrons prioritized counties along the West, North, and East Rivers. Yu'nan County received a supplementary squadron as well.

Though the county lacked Fubo Army core forces, two National Army squadrons' combined strength sufficed for self-defense. River patrol fleets passed endlessly, ready to deliver reinforcements from upstream or downstream positions instantly.

Given this posture, bandit mobs actually intended besieging Yu'nan County seat? Wasn't that excessive confidence?

Li Shenggang coughed. "I believe this intelligence contains questionable elements. Upstream from Yu'nan County sits Fengchuan County—among our largest West River strongholds. Not only are heavy forces stationed there, but the Navy's inland river fleet resides there too, prepared to sail downriver for immediate reinforcement. Time available for city attacks remains minimal. Even if enemies capture Yu'nan County seat, they cannot hold it long—much less sever the West River channel."

"Yes, my assessment agrees," Mi Longtao replied. "However, headquarters insists the intelligence is reliable. Consequently, their motive likely involves making a feint to the east while striking west..."

"Sound east, strike west?" Zhu Si asked, puzzled.

"Meaning their genuine target isn't Yu'nan County—they harbor alternative designs?"
