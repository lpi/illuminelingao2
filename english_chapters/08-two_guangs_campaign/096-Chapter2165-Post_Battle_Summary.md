# Chapter 2165 - Post-Battle Summary

"So, has everyone eaten?" Li Dong smiled and asked.

"Reporting to the Captain, we've all eaten!" the sergeant major, acting as deputy commander, reported.

Li Dong ordered: "Now, conduct a post-battle summary by squad!"

"Yes!"

The post-battle summary was mandated by the "Combat Regulations" issued by the General Staff. As long as there were no urgent tasks after a battle, a comprehensive summary of the day's combat had to be conducted. It was done by squad and then compiled into a report at the company level to be submitted to the battalion command.

The purpose of this summary was, first, to consolidate lessons learned from combat and identify deficiencies in troop operations and training; second, to increase soldier participation and cultivate soldiers with more independent combat awareness.

Li Dong sat down by the fire with Yang Erdong and the others. Yang Erdong and the rest stood up reflexively.

This was not only a habit from the old army; even in the Fubo Army system, the hierarchical difference between officers and soldiers was still an emphasized absolute authority.

"Don't be stiff, everyone sit down." Li Dong waved his hand. "We fought all day today, you must have plenty of thoughts. Let's hear them."

Luo Mao was a veteran. Seeing Li Pudun and the others looking bashful and afraid to speak, he smiled and said, "I'll start. Captain, your command today was brilliant..."

"You don't need to summarize that," Li Dong laughingly kicked him. "Save the flattery for when we get back. Talk about your direct feelings."

"The biggest feeling is that our equipment isn't good enough." As a Corporal Squad Leader, Luo Mao used a Nanyang rifle, but he had seen the awkward performance of the spears all day.

"Speaking of spears, they really don't lose out in close-quarters combat on open ground. But in today's terrain, with so many hills and trees, spears are hard to use—not as handy as machetes."

This remark immediately resonated with the soldiers:

"Always getting snagged when passing through woods."

"Carrying them on a long march feels very cumbersome."

"Especially hard to hold when climbing mountains or crossing water; a rifle can be slung over the back."

...

Yang Erdong saw everyone speaking enthusiastically and wanted to talk about the rifles too, but he hesitated and didn't open his mouth. Instead, Li Pudun stammered:

"...I also have a thought. Can't we be given a few more of these bird guns—Nanyang rifles? This gun is really easy to use, but right now there are only twenty or so rifles. Sometimes it's frustrating during a fight..."

With this said, everyone's emotions rose. Regarding why the National Army wasn't equipped with rifles, many actually had thoughts in their hearts for a long time. In fact, many of these soldiers had served in the Ming army and initially didn't like firearms much—primitive firearms had weak power, poor usability, and often caused accidents. So they weren't very interested in not being equipped with rifles, thinking spears were more reliable. But once on the battlefield, having fought a real battle, they immediately appreciated the combat performance advantages of the Nanyang rifles equipped by the National Army. especially, every volley by the riflemen could instantly suppress the enemy's offensive momentum and disrupt their formation. The effect was far better than arrows and spear thrusts. especially when coordinating with Mi Longtao's troops, the firepower output and combat effectiveness of the Fubo Army were several times stronger than theirs, making these grunts secretly envious—this was what fighting should look like! Originally they thought they could avoid dangerous things like firearms, but now they felt that carrying a spear made them inferior.

"...It goes without saying that the Fubo Army has rifles, but other National Army units have guns too—we're the only ones among the hundreds of men in Xugang who don't!"

"Even the Li savages have skirts... stick guns; we're worse off than them!"

...

Seeing everyone talking over each other about this, Yang Erdong grew bolder. He thought for a moment and raised his hand. "Why not issue me a firelock? If I had a firelock, in the battle by the river this morning, I saw the enemy, but having no firelock in hand and unable to shoot with a spear, I could only watch helplessly as the enemy shot arrows first. If I had a firelock, I could have taken out the enemy archers first, and several brothers wouldn't have been hit by arrows."

"Beautifully said, but would you know how to use it if given one?" a soldier nearby asked deliberately, causing everyone to laugh.

Yang Erdong stiffened his neck and said, "Of course I know how to use it! I used it when I was a house guard for Governor Xiong... no, Xiong Wencan. I even practiced many times."

Li Dong was somewhat surprised: "You know how to use a Nanyang rifle?"

"Yes!" Yang Erdong was a bit proud. "I learned it in Xiong Wencan's house guard squad. During the assessment, I hit the target three times out of five shots. I even learned some Aussie... er, Aussie foot drills from Advisor Yi."

"So you were a house guard!"

"Wow, Xiong Wencan's house guard!"

"Isn't Xiong Wencan a big official of the Ming Dynasty? How would he have Aussie rifles?"

Li Dong waved his hand to stop the discussion and said, "I've heard everyone's opinions. I will reflect them to my superiors. But the rifle issue has to take time—the Senate can't produce so many Nanyang rifles all at once. How long has our unit been established? There are tens of thousands of National Army soldiers being organized across Guangdong. Even if the Senate gives twenty guns per squadron, adding it up means thousands upon thousands."

Then everyone expressed various ideas. In the old army, let alone soldiers, even low-to-mid-ranking officers rarely discussed the success or failure of campaign tactics in front of generals—"strategy" was something for the Supervisors and Commanders to consider. Thus, this practice, while making the soldiers curious, also sparked their interest in discussion. From the rifle issue, they moved to personal equipment—many soldiers felt it would be best to have a suit of armor.

"We all use spears and have no bows or arrows. When the enemy shoots a barrage of arrows, several of us get wounded at once. If we had a suit of iron armor or cotton armor, it would be much better; at least we wouldn't die from just one arrow." A soldier with a combat soldier background said.

"That's right. Brothers who have been in battle know the old saying: three arrows are not as good as one blade. With armor for protection, as long as vital parts aren't hit, one can continue fighting even with seven or eight arrows in them. Now, wearing just a uniform, one arrow means half-dead."

Regarding armor, Li Dong had heard soldiers complain more than once. He had been a soldier for several years and participated in many battles, but never felt armor was that important. However, when he was a soldier, the troops were equipped with a rifle for every man, not spears. Once in combat, they could suppress the enemy with vigorous firepower from a distance. In contrast, these National Army soldiers had to charge enemy formations directly without sufficient suppression, so casualties from weapons like arrows were inevitable.

However, he didn't refute or explain, but let the soldiers speak their minds freely. Most of the discussions were completely worthless, but Li Dong was experienced and knew that a summary meant panning for gold from a pile of messy fragments. Luo Mao didn't talk much either; holding a notebook and pencil, he engaged in taking notes occasionally and added a few comments.

While the summary meeting was being held, a military conference was taking place in the Xu Ancestral Hall.

The participants, besides Mi Longtao, included Zhu Si and Lieutenant Li Shenggang, a detachment commander who had just arrived.

Li Shenggang and Mi Longtao were classmates from the training corps, both officers promoted rapidly during this Guangdong campaign. They were mostly veterans with long service records, having served as sergeants, experienced in both fighting and leading troops.

Li Shenggang's unit was originally intended for Lianzhou, but shortly after departing from Sanshui, they received orders: "Intelligence shows the enemy will have a major operation within the borders of Fengchuan and Yu'nan counties. Abort the original mission immediately and proceed to Yu'nan County to await orders."

Similar orders were also conveyed by messengers from Fengchuan County. The headquarters had obviously obtained some important intelligence.

"Comrades," Mi Longtao, being the most senior among the present officers, temporarily served as the frontline commander of the mixed force. "You've all seen the orders from the South China Army Forward Command. Intelligence says the enemy will launch a major combat operation in Yu'nan County, preparing to take the county seat in one stroke. For this, the Forward Command has ordered the Yu'nan County Garrison to prepare for combat, defending the county seat and important strongholds around it firmly. As a mobile force, we must find a way to encircle and destroy this group of enemies."

A stir immediately arose in the venue. Since the start of the Yao rebellion, several county seats around the Yao area had fallen. However, those county seats had mostly just submitted to the Senate and the government troops' will to fight was weak, so they fell easily. But Yu'nan County was a county seat along the West River, an important guarantee for the smooth passage of the West River waterway, and a key defensive support point along the communication line. Each of these county seats was garrisoned by at least one National Army squadron, equipped with a working team of several naturalized cadres, and had ample ammunition and food. Recently, due to the tense situation, a second emergency reinforcement was carried out, and a batch of new supplementary squadrons was prioritized for the counties along the West, North, and East Rivers. Yu'nan County also received a supplementary squadron.

Although the county had no Fubo Army as a core, the strength of two National Army squadrons was enough for self-defense. Patrol fleets flowed endlessly on the river surface, ready to bring reinforcements from upstream and downstream at any time.

Under such a posture, a mob of bandits actually wanted to besiege the Yu'nan County seat? This was too overconfident, wasn't it?

Li Shenggang coughed: "I think this intelligence has doubtful points. Upstream from Yu'nan County is Fengchuan County, one of our largest strongholds on the West River. Not only are heavy troops stationed there, but the Navy's inland river fleet is also there, ready to sail downriver for reinforcement at any time. The time left for the enemy to attack the city is not much. Even if the enemy takes the Yu'nan County seat, they cannot hold it for long, let alone cut off the West River channel."

"Yes, I see it that way too," Mi Longtao said. "But the headquarters says the intelligence is reliable. So their motive might be to make a feint to the east while attacking in the west..."

"Sound east, strike west?" Zhu Si asked, puzzled.

"Meaning their real target isn't Yu'nan County, but they have other designs?"
