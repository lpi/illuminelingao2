# Chapter 2256: Borrowing Troops

"Master, Master Peng has come to visit. Here is the visiting card."

Following the servant's announcement, the man addressed as Master turned from the fish pond. By the standards of any timeline, he was an old man. He dusted off the fish food crumbs from his hands and asked unhurriedly:

"Which Master Peng?"

"It is the former Magistrate of this county..."

"It is him."

This man was Ouyang Xi, the local "worthy" recommended by Peng Shou’an. Ouyang Xi himself had no degree, but his son Ouyang Da was a *Juren* of the fourth year of the Tianqi reign—in Yangshan, a place where academic success was rare and martial men were common, his family counted as the number one gentry.

The Ouyang family residence was originally inside the Yangshan county seat. When the Yao people breached the city, his family also suffered a catastrophe. Although the soft valuables and family members had been transferred to the village stockade beforehand, the residence in the city was ruined beyond recognition. After the Australians came, the situation did not seem to pacify, and he intended to avoid suspicion, so he simply used the excuse of the dilapidated house to not return to the city, staying in the countryside stockade to watch the wind direction.

Because his family's foundation was in the city, the Ouyang family was not as cold to the Senate as other gentry, or even refusing to pay money and grain to them. When Wang Chuyi came to Yangshan, although there was some bargaining over the amount of the "Reasonable Burden," once the money and grain were agreed upon, he paid every grain of rice.

Although Ouyang Xi hoped in his heart that the Great Ming could return—after all, Ouyang Da’s *Juren* degree was from the Great Ming—and did not like this new foreign regime, he still tried his best to perfunctory on the surface. After all, he knew somewhat of the Australians' strength. If the Great Ming was truly going to perish, he had no intention of letting his family be buried with the Great Ming.

Wang Chuyi wanted to suppress bandits, and Ouyang Xi naturally approved. His family was the number one gentry, with money, grain, and able-bodied men; ordinary bandits naturally dared not provoke them. However, his family had many members and extensive connections. Even if the bandits gave the Ouyang family face, they might not give face to the Ouyang family's relatives and friends. Moreover, he had a large amount of land and other properties at home. No matter how many militia braves he had, he could not cover everything. Therefore, he had to "make friends" with various heroes of the greenwood and spend some money to ensure peace. If Sun Dabiao could be suppressed, it would naturally be a good thing.

Later, he heard that Magistrate Wang wanted to grant amnesty to Sun Dabiao. This did not exceed his expectations: this was the norm locally. So while he paid the "Reasonable Burden" to the county, he also spent some money on the Sun and Feng bandit gangs who came to ask for provisions. If one day the Great Ming government troops fought back, he would invariably "assist with provisions" as well. For the Ouyang family, this was not a huge burden, merely a harmless way of survival.

That Sun Dabiao openly ambushed Wang Chuyi at Dalang Market and completely turned against the Australians greatly exceeded Ouyang Xi’s expectations.

Ouyang Xi also knew the strength of the Australians—Yangshan was not a place closed to news. Merchants coming from south and north often passed through here. He had seen Australian goods and heard of Australian deeds.

Although Yangshan was remote and the Australians could not bring many troops here, if they were truly provoked, the combat power of people like Sun Dabiao was definitely no match for the Australians—after all, the Australians had defeated General He’s army of tens of thousands back then.

He heard that the county's two major bandit leaders, Sun Dabiao and Feng Haijiao, had accepted the imperial court's amnesty and became some Yangshan Left and Right Wing Squad Leaders. Although there had been a saying since ancient times of "killing and arson to receive amnesty," Sun and Feng had notorious records in Yangshan. That they could openly become government troops made Ouyang Xi secretly despise them in his heart.

Regardless of whether he despised or appreciated them, the fire at Dalang Market plunged Yangshan into chaos. The newly arrived "Great Song" looked unreliable to everyone, and the groups of Sun and Feng flying the "Great Ming" banner were just a bunch of bandits. Both sides claimed to represent the "Royal Law" and sent people everywhere to conscript men and grain. Ouyang Stockade had also been visited by several groups. Ouyang Xi’s response was "speak nice words, don't spend money." When messengers came, he sent people to entertain them warmly, serving good wine and food, but when it came to grain and men, the steward would cry poverty. In short, not a single feather was plucked.

It was not that he was stingy with money and grain, but the situation in Yangshan was confusing for a time. No one could see what would happen next, so he was naturally unwilling to take sides easily.

At the same time, he instructed his son to hoard gunpowder, forge weapons, repair the stockade walls, and prepare for battle—not entirely to guard against the Australians or Sun and Feng, but because today’s Yangshan was completely devoid of law. Not only did various villains take the opportunity to become bandits, but some large households in the county also took the opportunity to settle old scores. For a time, fires burned in every village, and smoke rose from every stockade. Ouyang Stockade was also crowded with commoners from the vicinity seeking refuge.

Some days ago, he heard that the Australians had sent a new magistrate—and it was actually a woman. Ouyang Xi didn't believe it at one point; since ancient times, how could there be a woman magistrate! Although there had been a Wu Zetian, she had been an Empress before becoming Emperor. Later, hearing that it really was a woman magistrate, he immediately felt the "Great Song" was finished.

A few days ago, however, shocking news came: this female magistrate had personally gone into battle, flattened Dalang Market, and captured Sun Dabiao’s entire family alive. Master Ouyang naturally did not believe it either—the Sun family were bandits of many years, and successive magistrates had been helpless against them. Now that they had received the imperial court's title and were at the peak of their strength, how could they be flattened by a woman hiding in the county seat?

However, the spies he sent to the county seat returned and vividly described the sorry state of Sun Dabiao and his gang being displayed in the county. This forced the Ouyang father and son to believe.

Regardless of whether this great victory was due to the female magistrate personally entering the field or the Australians sending elite troops to handle it, Sun Dabiao’s destruction was solid. Dalang Market was a vital passage to the Yao area. By taking it, the Australians not only made gold daily but also grasped the lifeline of the Yonghua Yao people.

With this, although the Australians could not yet be said to have turned the tables, they held the upper hand. Feng Haijiao probably wouldn't be able to jump around for many more days. With his experience, given the Ouyang family's status in the county, they would inevitably encounter the problem of "taking sides"—where should his family go?

At this critical juncture, Peng Shou’an suddenly visited. He certainly didn't come to drink tea with him—mostly likely he came under orders. Ouyang Xi couldn't gauge the other party's intention. He wanted to discuss it with his son, but Ouyang Da had gone to another estate the day before yesterday and was not at home.

Peng Shou’an was a magistrate of the Great Ming, and after surrendering to the Australians, he became some "consultant." Naturally, he had been to the Ouyang home before. Although the Ouyang father and son had felt quite "disdainful" of Peng Shou’an back then, they never showed it. They just dealt with him carefully. When levying the "Reasonable Burden," he had also made "expressions" to Peng Shou’an, so a lower figure was set, and both sides had some friendship.

Why did he suddenly visit at this time?

Seeing the Master's face cloudy and uncertain, hesitating quite a bit, the servant said, "Then this small one will go say Master is not at home..."

"No, no." Ouyang Xi hurriedly stopped him. It was obviously unwise not to see Peng Shou’an at this time. Judging by this woman's actions since arriving in Yangshan, decisive in killing and cold-blooded, she was far above Magistrate Wang, and must be a forceful official. Now that she had just suppressed Sun Dabiao, it was the time she was establishing authority; it was not suitable to sweep her face.

"Change clothes! Open the main gate, say I will welcome him personally," Ouyang Xi ordered.

Ouyang Xi changed into clothes for receiving guests and went out to welcome him. He saw Peng Shou’an waiting under the eaves with a few *Kun* attendants. He hurriedly straightened his clothes, went down the steps with a face full of smiles, bowing and yielding. He welcomed Peng Shou’an into the hall for the ceremonial greetings.

After the two finished bowing to each other, they pulled chairs to sit as host and guest, and attendants served tea. While drinking tea, they exchanged a few polite words. Ouyang Xi first complimented the new magistrate for being "brave and resourceful" with "thunderous force," removing a great scourge of Yangshan, and saying the commoners were "like meeting sweet rain" and so on. Then he praised Peng Shou’an for "assisting in military affairs" and "saving the world and pacifying the people." Although he knew these were flattery, and he basically couldn't be said to have "assisted" anything, Peng Shou’an still found it very agreeable to hear. He also returned a set of flattery, nothing more than "benevolent and charitable" and "benefiting the native place."

After the polite words on both sides were finished, Ouyang Xi opened his mouth: "Sir specially came to my humble stockade today; I wonder what advice you have?"

Ouyang Xi guessed about seventy to eighty percent of his intention; it was nothing more than for money and grain. In his heart, he had actually already judged the situation, preparing to spend fifty *shi* of grain and three hundred taels of silver to send him away. If he wanted to talk about other things, they would have to have a good haggling session.

"This time this student has come, firstly on behalf of our Magistrate to extend greetings: Mr. Ouyang is a worthy of this county. Now Yangshan is in a troubled autumn, and the commoners are like fish swimming in a cauldron. We hope Mr. Ouyang can come out to do more things for the commoners and seek welfare."

"Easy to say, easy to say." Ouyang Xi couldn't understand his meaning for a moment, so he could only perfunctory, "My family has lived in Yangshan for generations. Since Yangshan is in difficulty, naturally we should exert effort." He estimated this was just finding a high-sounding reason to ask for money and grain.

"Good," Peng Shou’an said. "In that case, this student will not beat around the bush. Actually, this student came here under the Magistrate's order to 'borrow troops' from the Master."

"Borrow troops?" Ouyang Xi was stunned. "Sir, do not joke. This student is just a commoner; where would I get soldiers?"

"I am not joking," Peng Shou’an said seriously. "If we talk about militia braves and able-bodied men, which family in Yangshan County can be mentioned on equal terms with the Master's family?"

Speaking of numbers, the number of militia in the Ouyang family was indeed the first in the county; Ouyang Xi himself could not deny this. If he swept the floor for men, he could pull out two or three hundred militia—and his family's militia armament was the strongest in the county.

Ouyang Xi secretly thought this was bad; this "borrowing troops" harbored malicious intent!

"If we talk about the number of militia, my humble estate indeed possesses quite a few braves—but they are mostly rural commoners. Guarding the estate and home, they are competent, but if discussed as 'soldiers,' they are too far off."
