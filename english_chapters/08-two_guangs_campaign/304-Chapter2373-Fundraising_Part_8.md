# Chapter 2373: Fundraising (Part 8)

Reality, as usual, refused to cooperate. By the time he reached the municipal government, Ren Youzi saw Liu Xiang and several other Senators hurriedly climbing into sedan chairs and departing from across the street, but Chu He was not among them. Inquiring at the entrance, he learned the man was still in the building. He showed his Senator credentials and was immediately led to a small office by a staff member whose attitude was conspicuously over-friendly. Just moments after knocking, he was already "shaking hands joyfully."

Let go! Disgusting! Ren Youzi roared internally.

Two "fellow sufferers at the ends of the earth" sat together. Chu He called for the orderly to bring another cup of tea and refilled his own water. Two men facing each other, somewhat awkward—they were barely "nodding acquaintances."

Now they were actually sitting together, with a faint air of alliance-formation. This world really does change fast. Chu He sighed inwardly, then strained to recall what he knew about this Senator Ren Youzi. This Senator Ren was quite famous among the slacker community, nicknamed "Ren Youzi"—the Oily One. The nickname wasn't a parody of his name, nor did it imply slipperiness, but rather... this person excelled at stirring trouble. He confronted everyone he encountered and fanned flames in every matter. His skill at adding fuel to fire suggested he feared the world wasn't chaotic enough. Having been forced into the Cheka unwillingly, work had become his outlet for venting. Whenever word spread that he was coming to audit a unit, Senators and naturalized cadres alike would tremble...

Damn it! This "meeting an old friend in a foreign land" is fine, but why did I impulsively invite him here?

Two people who mutually disliked each other sat together, awkwardly sipping tea, at a loss for words. After half a cup, Ren Youzi couldn't stand it anymore. His eyes flashed, and he found an opening.

"What, has Old Liu already arranged work for you?" Ren Youzi raised his chin toward the documents on the desk.

This opening was much better than "Old Chu, how did your complaint go?" Chu He consoled himself.

"Oh, I just reported the situation to Old Liu, and he gave me some local economic survey briefings, asking me to see if I had any ideas." Chu He deliberately kept "reporting the situation" vague, as though he had come to submit a proposal to Liu Xiang.

"You... even got an office arranged? A position?" Ren Youzi was fooled, surprised for a moment.

"No, no—I can't propose anything without investigation. I'm just studying the materials now." Chu He continued deflecting.

"Hold on, that's not right. Then what were you doing at Zhou Wei's place today? Don't tell me you went to request an imperial edict from Emperor Zhou." Ren Youzi saw through the circling, and looking again, this was just a small conference room, not even an office! Who works here? Muttering to himself, he figured out the situation and called him out directly.

Chu He forcibly avoided embarrassment and stubbornly replied: "I didn't manage to see Zhou Wei! In the plan I conceived, Zhou Wei's side is actually the minor part; the major part is here, so I came to test the waters."

"Heh!" Ren Youzi jabbed mercilessly: "This municipal government is much easier to enter than Zhou Family Fortress!"

Chu He thought he was indirectly jabbing at Zhou Wei and was about to agree when Ren Youzi's reversal came.

"We can't catch up to Zhou Wei's hot stove. Just now, I was strolling by the Pearl River. The cold river wind blew against my chest, chilling to the bone! But my mind also cleared up. When Zhou Wei was jumping around, lobbying and networking throughout the Senate, we didn't help. Now that his revolution has succeeded, we want to squeeze in and share the fruits. Can those who followed Zhou Wei agree to that? Even if Zhou Wei wants to unite the masses, doesn't he first have to take care of his own brothers?"

Chu He's face reddened with embarrassment, mumbling "yes, yes, yes."

"Even if something ends up falling to us, isn't it just scraps? Moreover, it's not like he doesn't have capable people. We come fawning, and forget about his little secretary looking down on us—if it were me, I'd also look down on us. Wouldn't you say?"

"That's right, that's right—human nature!" By now Chu He's ears had turned red.

"...Although I don't know what you're trying to propose, it can't escape three things: people, money, and materials. What does Zhou Wei have? Let me be clear: right now he just has a document with an official stamp! The original assets of the Southeast Asia Company have been transferred to him, but in such a short time, while he's been running around here in Guangzhou, he definitely hasn't even figured out the bottom line, let alone put them to use." Ren Youzi assumed a "don't try fooling me" expression, leaned back on the sofa, and said disdainfully: "If it were a proposal about the original Southeast Asia Company's business, you would have submitted it earlier. What can you propose to Zhou Wei? In the end, implementation definitely falls on Guangzhou's territory—how to coax people, money, and materials out of them."

Chu He thought: You also just figured it out, didn't you? Coming here to act like a know-it-all with me! If you'd understood earlier, why would you have gone looking for that Secretary Zhou every other day? At least I pounded the table; you just slunk away on your own!

"Just tell me if I'm right!"

"You're right..."

But Ren Youzi didn't care about Chu He's response and continued directly: "I've asked many people; who can escape this scope? Why does Zhou Wei disappear every other day? Isn't it because he's afraid Old Liu won't cooperate, won't give him the real picture, and will pull the 'crying poor before the borrower opens his mouth' routine? He wants to investigate the situation himself to avoid being fooled by Old Liu. Secondly, he also wants to see if he can bypass Old Liu entirely!"

With that, he leaned toward Chu He, reached out and rapped the coffee table between them: "Why would we go find Old Liu? What's the use? Tell Old Liu: 'For the sake of my career—your brother's career—hurry up and take out Guangzhou's manpower, materials, and finances, and through me, give them to Zhou Wei, let him get rich and let me get promoted'?"

"Why would Old Liu do that? Even films with billions in box office can be made to show losses when avoiding dividend payouts. Old Chu!" Ren Youzi poked Chu He's shoulder. "We're all insiders; don't we understand these tricks? Once Guangzhou's silver enters the Nanyang Company, just report a few typhoons and tsunamis, and it all disappears."

Ren Youzi finished his long string of words, then leaned back again, caught his breath, and continued: "We help cut Guangzhou's leeks, leaving a mess of rotten vegetable leaves for Old Liu to clean up. You think Old Liu is a fool? Even if Old Liu is foolish, that couple at the Tax Bureau are cunning and crafty—one look and you can tell they're old foxes of officialdom. Can they not foresee this outcome? They're all wearing the same pants and will definitely alert Old Liu! So why would we rush over there just to get sprayed?"

Chu He felt that Ren Youzi had finally finished venting, and he relaxed. He personally rose to take the thermos left by the orderly and refill both their cups.

"Brother sees it clearly!" Chu He quickly flattered. "I only figured this out just now while looking at the survey materials."

Ren Youzi's inner fire had been vented through this roundabout way, and his mood improved. He readily accepted the compliment, proudly picked up the freshly poured tea and took a sip—but unexpectedly, the tea was too hot. Fortunately, he hadn't drunk much and didn't startle himself into spitting it out; he just held it in his mouth, frowning in pain.

Chu He's earlier flattery had been merely preventive, keeping this person from getting angry again; he hadn't really meant it. Seeing Ren Youzi burn himself, he laughed inwardly and relaxed. His mood lightened, and his speech loosened.

"Brother is straightforward! I won't lie either. Today I was angered by Zhou Wei's secretary!"

As Chu He began speaking, a thought struck him: if he got angry and then immediately produced a proposal unfavorable to Zhou Wei, he might get labeled as someone who bears grudges for the smallest slights. Better to drag a few more people in to demonstrate that Zhou Wei was unpopular.

"After getting angry, I immediately came here to complain. Regardless of whether Old Liu can handle it, the arrow has been shot and can't turn back. I can only press forward."

"Otherwise what?" Ren Youzi jabbed again: "Are you going back to repair computers or grow flowers? Or continue going to Jeju Island to teach female students?"

"Pressing forward is pressing forward, but winning this confrontation is useless! Even if I knock Zhou Wei to the ground in the end, what's the point? I still need to find a way forward!"

Hmm? Ren Youzi sensed there was something behind these words.

"Are you switching allegiances?"

"Brother, please don't be so crude. We're all Senators who came on the same boat. Who has 'allegiances'? We're all under the Senate's roof! We need to maintain this awareness." Chu He displayed a disdainful smile, scoring a point for himself.

Ren Youzi gave a mocking laugh and didn't take the bait.

"After Old Liu heard my grievances, he gave me some materials. In my view, there's much that can be done here!" Chu He continued: "Brother sees the contradiction between the Nanyang Company and Guangzhou's local interests so clearly. Don't you think, if we could help Guangzhou's side gain more benefits..."

"Hiss!" Ren Youzi's train of thought was suddenly opened.

"Brother, let me be upfront. I'm preparing a fundraising plan for Zhou Wei. Does this conflict with you?"

Ren Youzi stared into Chu He's eyes for over ten seconds before answering: "No conflict! I'm preparing a personnel recruitment plan!"

Emperor Zhou, don't blame me for your high threshold! Ren Youzi roared internally.

You're deceiving ghosts! Chu He thought. You're a financial migrant worker who never worked in HR; what personnel recruitment plan? But he immediately put on an expression of believing it.

"Brother is straightforward! Then let's discuss and see if we can develop a comprehensive proposal?" Chu He smiled so broadly his eyes curved.

"No!" Ren Youzi suddenly stood up, startling Chu He into thinking this brother had a brain twitch and was about to back out.

"Brother Chu, didn't you want to buy me a drink? How about we go right now?" Ren Youzi said suddenly. "There's a tavern in the Great World with a nice atmosphere. The late-night snacks are also good. Let's round up a few more people and have a proper drink! Won't stop until we're drunk!"

Chu He understood clearly. The other party thought this was the municipal government and feared walls have ears. Some things couldn't be said too openly. He responded immediately:

"Brother! Grand!"
