# Chapter 2373: Fundraising (Part 8)

As a result, reality was just not satisfying. By the time he reached the municipal government, Ren Youzi saw Liu Xiang and several other Senators hurriedly getting into sedan chairs and leaving from across the street, but Chu He was not among them. Inquiring at the entrance, this guy was still at the municipal government! He showed his Senator credentials and was immediately led to this small office by a staff member whose attitude was obviously overly friendly. Just a short while after knocking, he was already "shaking hands joyfully."

Let go! Disgusting to hold! Ren Youzi roared in his heart.

Two "fellow sufferers at the ends of the earth" sat together. Chu He called the orderly to bring another cup of tea, refilled his own water. Two men facing each other with four eyes, somewhat awkward—because they were not familiar at all, barely "nodding acquaintances."

Now they were actually sitting together, with a faint sense of forming an alliance. This world really changes fast. Chu He sighed in his heart, and then tried hard to recall the information about this Senator Ren Youzi in his memory. This Senator Ren Youzi was quite famous among the slacker community, nicknamed "Ren Youzi" (literally "oily person"). It wasn't a parody of his name, nor saying he was slippery, but... this person was quite proficient in the art of stirring up trouble. He confronted everyone he met and fanned the flames in every matter. His skill at adding fuel to fire was as if he feared the world wasn't chaotic enough. Because he went to the Cheka unwillingly, work became his outlet for venting. Whenever it was heard that he was coming to a unit for an audit, Senators and naturalized cadres alike would be terrified...

Damn it! This "meeting an old friend in a foreign land" is fine, but why did I impulsively invite him here!

Two people who mutually disliked each other sat together, awkwardly drinking tea, not knowing what to say for a while. After half a cup, Ren Youzi couldn't stand it anymore. His eyes flashed, and he found a topic to start with and threw it over.

"What, has Old Liu already arranged work for you?" Ren Youzi raised his chin, indicating the documents on the desk.

This opening was much better than "Old Chu, how did your complaint go?" Chu He comforted himself.

"Hey! I just reported the situation to Old Liu, and Old Liu gave me some local economic survey briefings, asking me to help see if there are any ideas." Chu He deliberately made "reporting the situation" sound vague, as if he had come to submit a proposal to Liu Xiang.

"You... even got an office arranged? Got a position?" Ren Youzi was fooled, surprised for a moment.

"No, no, I can't propose anything without investigation. I'm just studying the materials now." Chu He continued to brush him off.

"Hey, wait, that's not right. Then what were you doing at Zhou Wei's place today? Don't tell me you went to request an imperial edict from Emperor Zhou." Ren Youzi saw him talking in circles, and looking again, this was just a small conference room, not even an office! Who works here? Muttering in his heart, he figured out the taste and directly exposed it.

Chu He forcibly avoided embarrassment and stubbornly said: "Didn't I fail to see Zhou Wei! In the plan I thought of, Zhou Wei's side is actually the small part; the big part is here, so I came here to test the wind."

"Heh!" Ren Youzi mercilessly jabbed: "This municipal government is much easier to enter than the Zhou Family Fortress!"

Chu He thought he was indirectly jabbing at Zhou Wei and was about to agree when he heard Ren Youzi's reversal.

"We can't catch up to Zhou Wei's hot stove. Just now, I was strolling by the Pearl River. The cold river wind blew toward my chest, chilling to the bone! My mind also cleared up. When Zhou Wei was jumping around, lobbying and networking in the Senate, we didn't help. Now that his revolution has succeeded, we want to squeeze in and share the fruits. Can those who followed Zhou Wei agree? Even if Zhou Wei wants to unite the masses, doesn't he have to first take care of his own little brothers?"

Chu He was so embarrassed his face turned slightly red, mumbling "yes, yes, yes."

"Even if something ends up falling to us, isn't it just scraps? Moreover, it's not like he doesn't have people he can use. We come here fawning, let alone his little secretary looking down on us—if it were me, I'd also look down on us. Wouldn't you say?"

"That's right, that's right, it's human nature!" Chu He's ears were almost red by now.

"...Although I don't know what you want to propose, it can't be separated from three things: people, money, and materials. What does Zhou Wei have? Let me be clear, right now he just has a document with an official stamp! The original assets of the Southeast Asia Company have been transferred to him, but in such a short time, while he's been running around here in Guangzhou, he definitely hasn't even figured out the bottom line, let alone used them." Ren Youzi put on a "don't fool me" look, leaned back on the sofa, and said disdainfully to Chu He: "If it were a proposal about the original Southeast Asia Company's business, you would have made it earlier. What can you propose to Zhou Wei? In the end, implementation definitely falls on Guangzhou's territory—how to trick people, money, and materials out."

Chu He thought, you also TM just figured it out, didn't you? Coming here to act like a know-it-all with me! If you understood earlier, why would you need to go find that Secretary Zhou every other day? At least I pounded the table; you just slunk away on your own!

"Just tell me if I'm right!"

"That's right..."

But Ren Youzi didn't care about Chu He's response at all and continued directly: "I've asked many people; who can escape this scope! Why does Zhou Wei disappear every other day? Isn't it because he's afraid Old Liu won't cooperate, won't give him the real picture, and pull the 'crying poor before the borrower even opens his mouth' routine? He wants to feel out the situation himself to avoid being fooled by Old Liu. Secondly, he also wants to see if he can bypass Old Liu!"

Saying this, he leaned forward toward Chu He, reached out and knocked on the coffee table between them: "Why don't we go find Old Liu? What's the use of finding him? Tell Old Liu, for the sake of my career, your brother's, hurry up and take out Guangzhou's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and through me, give them to Zhou Wei, let him get rich and let me get promoted?"

"Why would Old Liu do that? Even movies with billions in box office can be made into losses without paying dividends. Old Chu!" Ren Youzi poked Chu He's shoulder and said: "We're all insiders; don't we understand these tricks? Once Guangzhou's silver enters the Nanyang Company, just report a few typhoons and tsunamis, and it all disappears."

Ren Youzi finished a long string of words, then leaned back again, caught his breath, and continued: "We help cut Guangzhou's leeks, leaving a mess of rotten vegetable leaves for Old Liu to clean up. You think Old Liu is a fool? Even if Old Liu is foolish, that couple at the Tax Bureau are both cunning and crafty—one look and you can tell they're old foxers in the officialdom. Can they not see this outcome? They're all wearing the same pants and will definitely remind Old Liu! So why would we rush there to get sprayed!"

Chu He felt that Ren Youzi had finally finished venting, and he also relaxed, personally getting up to take the thermos left by the orderly and refilling both their cups.

"Brother sees it clearly!" Chu He quickly flattered: "I only figured this out just now when looking at the survey materials."

Ren Youzi's inner fire was vented through this roundabout way, and his mood improved. He readily accepted the compliment, proudly picked up the freshly added tea and took a sip, but unexpectedly the tea was too hot. Fortunately, he didn't drink much and wasn't startled into spitting it out; he just held it in his mouth, frowning in pain.

Chu He's earlier flattery was just to prevent this person from getting angry again; he wasn't that willing. Seeing Ren Youzi burn himself, he laughed inside, and he also relaxed. His mood relaxed, and his speech also opened up.

"Brother is straightforward! I won't lie to you either. Today I was angered by Zhou Wei's secretary!"

As Chu He started speaking, he suddenly thought of something: if he got angry and then immediately came up with a proposal unfavorable to Zhou Wei, he might get labeled as someone who bears grudges for the smallest grievances. Better to drag a few more people in to show that Zhou Wei is unpopular?

"After getting angry, I immediately came here to complain. Regardless of whether Old Liu can handle it, the arrow has been shot and can't turn back. Your younger brother can only keep going."

"Otherwise what?" Ren Youzi added a jab: "Are you going to go back to repair computers or grow flowers? Or continue going to Jeju Island to teach female students?"

"Keep going is keep going, but winning this confrontation is useless! Even if I knock Zhou Wei down to the ground in the end, what's the use? Your younger brother still needs to find a way out!"

Hmm? Ren Youzi felt there was something behind these words.

"Are you switching allegiances?"

"Brother, please don't have such a low level, okay? We're all Senators who came on the same boat. Who has allegiances? We're all under the Senate's roof! We need to have this awareness." Chu He showed a disdainful smile, scoring a point for himself.

Ren Youzi gave a heh heh laugh and didn't take his bait.

"After Old Liu heard me pour out my grievances, he gave me some materials. In my opinion, there's a lot that can be done here!" Chu He continued: "Brother sees the contradiction between the Nanyang Company and Guangzhou's local interests so clearly. Don't you think, if we could help Guangzhou's side gain more benefits..."

"Hiss!" Ren Youzi's train of thought was suddenly opened.

"Brother, let me lay it out first. I'm preparing a fundraising plan for Zhou Wei. Does this conflict with you, brother?"

Ren Youzi stared into Chu He's eyes for over ten seconds before answering: "No conflict! I'm preparing a personnel recruitment plan!"

Emperor Zhou, don't blame me for your high threshold! Ren Youzi roared in his heart.

You're deceiving ghosts! Chu He thought. You're a financial migrant worker who never worked in HR; what personnel recruitment plan? But he immediately put on an expression of believing it:

"Brother is straightforward! Then let's discuss it and see if we can come up with a comprehensive proposal?" Chu He smiled so much his eyes curved.

"No!" Ren Youzi suddenly stood up, startling Chu He into thinking this brother had a brain twitch and was going to back out.

"Brother Chu, didn't you want to buy me a drink? How about we go right now?" Ren Youzi suddenly said, "There's a tavern in the Great World with a nice atmosphere. The late-night snacks are also good. Let's round up a few more people and have a good drink! Let's not stop until we're drunk!"

Chu He understood clearly. The other party thought this was the municipal government and feared walls have ears. Some things couldn't be said too clearly. He responded immediately:

"Brother! Grand!"
