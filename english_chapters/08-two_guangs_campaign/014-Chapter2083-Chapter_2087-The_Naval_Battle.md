# Chapter 2083 - The Naval Battle

Several gunboats, unable to evade in time, were struck squarely by fire-ships and momentarily couldn't separate. Nearby gunboats quickly came to help tow the fire-ships away.

Xiong Wenchan listened intently to the distant cannon fire. Though the gunfire from ten *li* away was somewhat muffled, he listened with complete concentration, straining to judge the battle's progress from the sounds.

Dispatches arrived continuously: Naval Patrol Lieutenant Cao Bajiao's fire-ships had launched; the pirates were bombarding the fire-ship squadron; the river surface was covered in thick smoke, and the pirate warships could no longer be seen clearly...

Each time these vague dispatches arrived, the legal secretaries in the Governor's headquarters would snatch them eagerly after Xiong Wenchan had read them, huddling together to discuss, as if trying to extract unfavorable news for the pirates from these fragments.

A few would pace thoughtfully before the wall map, stroking their beards, as if they still harbored stratagems in their minds.

Only Xiong Wenchan himself knew clearly that these legal secretaries were as helpless as he was. Apart from hoping the fire-ships would achieve a great victory, they had no brilliant schemes whatsoever against the pirates.

He recalled how Chang Qingyun had once suggested manufacturing "River Dragons" and similar mines—not only for river blockades but also to drift downstream. Yet the mines that had been trial-produced under Chang Qingyun's supervision, following diagrams from the *Wubei Zhi* (Records of Armaments), had problems: either the fuse timing was wrong—too early or too late—or the waterproofing failed. Poor sealing let in water; too-tight sealing smothered the ignition flame. No matter the inducements of gold or the threats of flogging, the craftsmen simply could not produce satisfactory products. Even when they occasionally made one that worked, two or three *jin* of gunpowder couldn't even breach thick hull planking. Adding more powder meant the mine couldn't float.

Everyone said the Australians were nothing but "ingenious tricks and wicked skills"—but at this moment, how Xiong Wenchan wished those craftsmen had even a little of such skill!

*Useless wretches! They only know how to draw pay, and when they fail, they grovel and beg for mercy!* At one point, Xiong Wenchan had been tempted to behead a few craftsmen to make an example. In the end, Chang Qingyun had dissuaded him—but each man had received eighty strokes of the military rod, and the Gaoyao county magistrate was ordered to recover their wages.

Useless as they were, craftsmen who could manufacture firearms were scarce. He had already ordered that these artisans and their families be loaded onto boats and sent ahead to Wuzhou.

Chang Qingyun also listened silently to the cannon fire. The deep thunder was the Australians' naval guns; the staccato crackle was their rapid-fire guns and rifles. No question—the pirate flotilla was attacking the fire-ships.

He had more experience than most legal secretaries and knew fire-ships were useless on open water. But Antelope Gorge's narrow channel and the advantage of the current gave him some hope.

If they could burn even a few pirate vessels, at least the Ming could show the pirates that they were a force to be reckoned with—future negotiations wouldn't be so one-sided! At this point, Chang Qingyun hadn't even considered the words "defeating the pirates." In his view, that was impossible. Only by making them pay a price for every victory would negotiations become feasible.

"Your Excellency, the gunfire has stopped," a secretary remarked.

Xiong Wenchan nodded slightly to show he was aware. From Kuixing Tower, he could see black smoke rolling from the direction of Antelope Gorge. Obviously the fire was substantial—could the enemy ships have caught fire? The secretaries all nursed this hope, watching tensely.

Another dispatch arrived: *The river surface is covered in black smoke and blazing flames; pirate vessels are completely engulfed in fire...*

"Excellent!" Xie Shiming was the first to cheer. "Congratulations, Your Excellency! The pirate ships must all be on fire!"

With that, waves rippled through the room. Secretaries and officers rose and echoed enthusiastically:

"Your Excellency's brilliant foresight—laughing, the pirates have been reduced to ashes!"

"Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang reborn could not have done better!"

"That's not quite right! Did Cao Cao's forces have rapid-fire guns and giant warships? Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang fall far short!"

"The pirates have boasted of being undefeated since they first took up arms. Today they finally fall to Your Excellency's hand!"

...

The atmosphere in Kuixing Tower shifted from somber to rather relaxed. Only Chang Qingyun remained silent. He knew well: "flames covering the river" didn't necessarily mean Australian ships were burning. Australian warships all carried guns and had substantial gunpowder aboard. Yet the dispatch only mentioned "flames covering the river"—and no detonations of powder magazines had been heard. This meant the pirate vessels had not yet been damaged.

Xiong Wenchan's expression also brightened, but as a frontier governor he prided himself on keeping his emotions hidden. He merely stroked his beard silently and ordered more scouts sent to ascertain the truth.

"Damn it," Schneider cursed. Smoke from the burning fire-ships stung his eyes nearly shut; visibility had plummeted. Blazing straw swirled upward, scattering sparks everywhere. Had the ammunition boxes not been ordered sealed before combat, the propellant charges might well have been ignited.

Sparks had set fire to much of the fabric aboard. Though the canvas sails had been furled before battle, many of the *Zhujiang's* signal flags were now burned through with holes.

Schneider paced the bridge, struggling to observe his surroundings. The dense smoke worried him—not only did it shorten reaction time for evading fire-ships, but it also left him unable to assess the condition of his vessels.

"Fire control!" Ruan Xiaowu issued orders while scanning the river. Burning ships drifted everywhere. Though sailors on the *Zhujiang* pushed fire-ships away from the bow, collisions still occurred. Each impact knocked burning straw from the fire-ships onto the deck—sometimes enough to carpet it with flames.

Fortunately, though straw fires burned fiercely, they lacked staying power. Quick action by the sailors soon reduced them to black ash.

Even so, the situation was perilous. Sweat beaded on Ruan Xiaowu's face as he shouted commands continuously.

Through the smoke came the urgent distress whistles of vessels in trouble. Schneider's heart clenched. From the whistles, perhaps two or three gunboats had caught fire—yet he could only approximate their positions by sound, unable to see which boats were in distress or how serious the situation was.

Suddenly a gust of wind swept through, dispersing the black smoke shrouding the gorge. Now Schneider could see the scene around him: burning, drifting fire-ships everywhere, some already grounded on the banks, others entangled after colliding, forming blazing piles that rotated slowly in the current, floating downstream.

Schneider's heart sank. In the leading group, the 67-type large landing craft was surrounded by several fire-ships. Flames had already consumed the forward deck. Sailors stood on the still-unburned bridge and turret, desperately beating at the flames. But the fire was growing fiercer, nearly reaching the central wheelhouse.

"Signal 67 to abandon ship!"

Though he was reluctant, at this point further rescue efforts would only cost sailors' lives. He cursed inwardly—if only these small boats had radios like the larger warships, he could monitor each vessel's situation in real-time instead of relying on flag and lamp signals alone.

"Bastards!" Schneider swore. He saw that Boat 41 was also ablaze but still attempting damage control. He quickly ordered: "Order 41 to abandon ship! Now!"

Boat 41 had been towed clear of the jumbled fire-ships by nearby gunboats, but it was engulfed in flames from bow to stern. Its captain and sailors were trying to save the craft, desperately beating at the flames from a small section of the aft deck not yet burning. Several nearby gunboats closed in; sailors lowered hand pumps and trained water jets on the blaze.

Suddenly, a white flash lit the midsection of Boat 41, followed by a violent explosion that echoed across the river—the ammunition had detonated. The blast tore the hull to shreds. In an instant, everything above the waterline vanished. A fragment of hull plating crashed onto the *Zhujiang's* deck, still smoking faintly.

The captain and sailors disappeared instantly in the explosion's flames. An arm dropped past Schneider's eyes into the river.

"Signal the trailing vessels: recover the martyrs' remains!" Schneider gripped the bridge railing tightly and gave the order.
