# Chapter 436 Transportation Issues

The forging shop originally had a crude, makeshift free-fall forging hammer, but its efficiency was low. It barely sufficed for now. As industrial standards continued to improve, the machine factory's enthusiasts were prepared to abandon this crude equipment and build a hundred-ton hydraulic press. Later, they realized this goal was too ambitious and decided to start with more primitive means: manufacturing a steam forging hammer. This device wasn't technologically sophisticated, but it was effective enough. The Jiangnan Shipyard had two steam forging hammers made around 1880 that were still in service through the 1990s. Even when the bases broke down, Jiangnan was reluctant to dismantle them and kept patching them up for continued use.

With a steam forging hammer, forging many large workpieces became much easier. The entire steam forging hammer's slide rail was five meters high, entirely made of steel, standing on a foundation of granite plus reinforced concrete. The forging hammer on top weighed one ton and was driven by a steam-operated slide valve.

Compared to the free-fall forging hammer the machine factory had previously designed and manufactured, this hammer's forging capacity and work efficiency had improved three to four times over. Using the old forging hammer was very laborious—you had to constantly operate the steam engine to lift the hammer, then use a cam clutch to control the drop. Each forging strike was separated by long intervals, preventing continuous forging and causing great difficulties for heat treatment.

The forging shop quickly finished processing the low-carbon steel jaw plate, then manufactured the toggle plate and eccentric shaft using the same method. After the eccentric shaft was completed, it was taken to the lathe for turning to make it as circular as possible. Finally, they manufactured two large flywheels with a diameter of 1.2 meters, used to connect to the power source.

These behemoth components were loaded onto ox-carts and slowly hauled to Nanbao. Because ordinary four-wheeled ox-carts had limited carrying capacity, they were placed on specially made large flatbed carts with sixteen wheels, pulled by twelve oxen. Regardless of what this thing was actually for, the convoy alone was enough to attract onlookers and discussion—the folk along the road were amazed at how wasteful the Australians were with steel.

The equipment was installed in the newly built Workshop No. 1 at the Nanbao Mining Site. Workshop No. 1 was a large-span iron truss factory building designed by Bingfeng, three stories high. The structure used reinforced concrete columns for support. The floor was poured with concrete and had iron rails installed for pushing ore carts.

An overhead crane was installed on the workshop ceiling to deliver a large hopper for loading the crusher's materials. According to Zhan Wuya's view, a belt conveyor would actually be best, but they didn't have a suitable substitute for now. Using deerskin would be too extravagant.

Finally, Xiao Gui came to install the steam engine. At last, this system was fully installed. The massive apparatus, weighing about ten tons in total with its steel and giant base, stood in the center of the workshop. Not only were the native workers impressed—even the Transmigrators themselves found it awe-inspiring.

As Xiao Gui ignited the boiler, the steam engine slowly began to turn. Under the transmission of the large gearbox, the final stage transmitted power via belt to the crusher's flywheel. As the flywheel's rotational speed gradually increased, the crusher officially began working.

Workers used flatbed rail cars on tracks to bring in a load of large rocks. The overhead crane, driven by steam-powered pulleys, quickly hoisted a massive rock and dropped it into the crusher. Clank-clank, clank-clank—the crusher operated at a steady pace. The movable jaw plate slowly opened and closed. As the jaw opened and closed, the huge rock sank deeper and was clamped tighter. The rock began to crack, throwing off many chips. With a boom, a plume of white smoke rose, and the rock shattered into several pieces.

Everyone present was startled, but the machine factory people knew this operation was completely normal.

The jaw plate continued its slow, relentless compression. The rocks, now smaller after cracking, were clamped ever tighter in their descent, continuing to endure the compression of the movable and fixed jaw plates, constantly fracturing further.

Crushed stone and powder began to appear at the discharge port. Thick dust began to fill the air. Then a large pile of crushed stone fell into the hopper car positioned at the discharge port.

Below the discharge port was a track with a series of hopper cars connected nose to tail, stopped beneath the discharge port. They were connected by cable to a winch driven by a steam engine. After one car was filled, the operator started the machine to pull the train, allowing the second car to move under the discharge port—and so on until the entire train of hopper cars was full. Then they switched to the second train.

The filled hopper car train was pulled up to the loading station on the slope. Using the height difference, they tipped directly into the ox-cart's cargo bed and hauled away. The entire process minimized the need for manual loading and unloading.

Zhan Wuya calculated that for crushing construction-grade gravel alone, the crusher could process about fifty tons of crushed stone per day. If this crushing work were done by hand, you couldn't do it with fewer than three or four hundred people.

But now, including the boiler maintenance workers and crane operators, one shift needed only twenty workers. The difference in labor efficiency could only be described as earth-shaking.

But for the local people, this rumbling stone crusher represented terrifying power. If it could crush such hard boulders to powder, what couldn't these Australians do?

But the amazement didn't stop there. After the crusher was proven workable on the first day, over the following half month, the Nanbao Ore Processing Plant installed three more crushers in succession. This had an almost devastating effect on the locals.

The result was that the Crossing Group's work in the area went very smoothly. Local gentry and common folk practically obeyed their every word. And many people who weren't originally interested in becoming mine workers now came for odd jobs. Even landlord and gentry households sent some household slaves or collateral nephews to work—all to establish connections with the Mining Office.

With sufficient crushed stone, the transportation department's road hardening work progressed rapidly. Shan Daoqian used crushed stone for the roadbed to increase its load-bearing capacity, then used coal slag and fine sand for road surface leveling on top. After several rounds of compacting, the road became smooth as new—even higher quality than some low-grade rural roads in certain places.

Besides the construction machinery roller, Shan Daoqian also cooperated with the machine factory and vehicle factory to develop animal-drawn road rollers. This was simple—just a giant stone roller with animal harness. Slightly more complex were animal-drawn road graders, water sprinklers, and paving machines. Currently, these could all be pulled by horses, oxen, or human power. These specialized equipment not only reduced wear on construction machinery but, being self-producible, weren't as precious. The Transportation Bureau ordered several sets at once, using them simultaneously on multiple road sections.

Shan Daoqian applied to Wu De for several dozen worker positions, established the Road Maintenance Engineering Office, built maintenance stations along the routes, and formulated rules for regular, scheduled inspection, maintenance, and upkeep of the highways.

"There's another matter—we need to establish traffic rules," Shan Daoqian found Wu De.

Originally, Lingao didn't need traffic rules. Apart from pedestrians, there were at most a few sedan chairs and a few wheelbarrows, with an occasional horse passing through. Even if the dirt roads were narrow and uneven, there wouldn't be any traffic accidents. But now things were different. The Crossing Group's arrival had greatly increased the complexity of road conditions. Besides the ever-increasing pedestrians, there were ox-carts, livestock, bicycles, automobiles, and motorcycles. Road construction also brought new issues, such as intersections and bridges, all requiring some degree of control—there had already been several traffic accidents recently.

"Let the police handle this," Wu De said. "Dongmen Chuiyu is just the man for this."

Dongmen Chuiyu, having long managed the East Gate Market, already had some experience with such matters. He said: "I think we don't need overly complicated traffic regulations for now. First, common folk won't remember them, and they'll be hard for us to publicize. Second, we don't have enough manpower for on-site investigations and such."

When Liu Bang entered Guanzhong, he had only three simple laws. Although from a legal studies perspective this was a major regression, it was easy for the masses to understand and grasp, and easy to accept during the founding stage.

Dongmen Chuiyu established the basic principles: "Keep right, pass on the left, separate lanes for fast and slow."

According to the rules, pedestrians, sedan chairs, and livestock used the slow lane. Horse-drawn carts, ox-carts, and motor vehicles used the fast lane—logically speaking, motor vehicle speed was far different from ox-carts, but motor vehicles rarely went on the road lately, so it wouldn't cause traffic chaos.

Herds of livestock, such as cattle herds and sheep flocks, were not allowed on the road and could only walk below the roadbed. Large herds on the road could easily cause traffic jams.

Shan Daoqian said: "However, motor vehicles should avoid honking horns to prevent startling the livestock. And expecting heavy ox-carts on the road to yield is absolutely wishful thinking. Just pass them yourself."

"There need to be some penalties. Pedestrians should walk on the roadside. What if someone just likes walking in the middle?" Dugu Qiuhun asked.

"Fines won't work," Dongmen Chuiyu rested his chin. "First, implement the concept of 'hit and die with no liability.' For injuries, deaths, and property damage caused by traffic violations, no compensation will be given—"

"Wait, that's not the main point," Shan Daoqian stopped him. "I agree with what you're saying too, but right now we first need to discuss general minor violations. Given our current power, even if we really hit and killed a few commoners, no one would dare come for an explanation."

"Send them to the reform labor team!" Dugu Qiuhun brought out this method.

"That can also increase the labor force." Dongmen Chuiyu thought it was viable. After all, minor violations these days were all compensated with labor, from three days to three months.

Shan Daoqian said: "I think we should do this: anyone caught violating traffic rules gets assigned to our Transportation Bureau."

The Transportation Bureau had many projects and matters, and free labor was always welcome. Not only could they build bridges and roads, but they could also be used to direct traffic.
