# Chapter 332 - First Debate Concerning TCM

Hearing this, Fu Sinan immediately rolled off the bed and kowtowed to Liu San. Liu San hurriedly pulled him up:

"Don't kowtow; we don't practice that here." After speaking, he added, "But to be my apprentice, you have to leave home. Are you willing?"

Fu Sinan expressed willingness on the spot. Liu San remembered a guidance document edited by Wu De called *Handling Relations with Indigenous People*, which stated that matters involving personal freedom like taking apprentices should best be documented to avoid unnecessary disputes in the future.

After resting for a few more days, seeing his illness had fully healed, Liu San asked the liaison officer to call Fu Sinan's parents over to discuss taking him as an apprentice. Having such a capable doctor willing to take their son as an apprentice was naturally excellent for this impoverished family; although they lost half a laborer, there was one less mouth to feed. Both parties signed a contract, stipulating that Fu Sinan voluntarily served as Liu San's apprentice in Bairen Village for a term of seven years. During this period, life and death were up to fate.

With the document signed, in the legal sense of the Great Ming, Fu Sinan was Liu San's apprentice. Liu San could treat him however he wanted, except beating him to death.

After taking the apprentice, Liu San thought he needed to "purify" this apprentice and also wipe out his illiteracy, lest he couldn't even read basic medical books. He had no intention of staying in Daolu Village anymore, and after instructing Dong Weiwei, he took his apprentice back to Bairen.

Fu Sinan fought to carry Liu San's basket. Liu San laughed: "I'd better carry it myself."

"When there is work, the disciple undertakes the labor," Fu Sinan said respectfully.

"Oh, aren't you illiterate? Speaking so bookishly as soon as you open your mouth." Although he said so, Liu San still carried the basket on his own back.

"The village schoolteacher said it," Fu Sinan said seriously. "In the past, when passing by the private school, whenever the teacher asked students to work, he always said this sentence."

"It seems you love studying quite a bit." Liu San felt satisfied. If he didn't love reading, the plan to cultivate him would be hopeless. It seemed he not only loved reading but also had a good memory.

"Yes, Master," Fu Sinan said.

Liu San took Fu Sinan to Bairen. Everything here amazed and confused the boy who had just stepped into this place for the first time. After all, he was a child who hadn't even been to the county seat. He had heard fellow villagers say that outside the county seat there was now an East Gate Market which was the most prosperous, having not only prosperity but also many fresh gadgets that people hadn't seen for generations. Arriving at East Gate Market, his eyes felt insufficient to see everything.

"Stop looking, silly boy." Liu San patted his head. "You'll have plenty of time to look later."

Saying this, he took the child to a group of buildings surrounded by barbed wire outside Bairen City—this was also a quarantine camp. To adapt to the increasing number of personnel recruited from locals recently, the Ministry of Health established a quarantine camp outside Bairen City as well.

The person in charge here was Bai Yu from the Ministry of Education. When this big man of 1.80 meters swayed in front of them, Fu Sinan sucked in a breath of cold air. The legend that Australians were tall and strong was really not a boast.

"Call him Teacher Bai!" Liu San instructed.

Fu Sinan wanted to climb down and kowtow again. Bai Yu stopped him: "We don't allow kneeling to people!"

Being lifted by this big man, the thin and small Fu Sinan had no resistance at all and was immediately lifted up.

"Teacher Bai." He called out honestly.

"Bai Yu, I hand this child over to you."

"Where is this child from?" Bai Yu looked him over, "Looks a bit weak."

"From Thirteen Villages area. He was sick recently, hasn't been well for long."

"Quite a few children sent from that place recently." Bai Yu flipped through the register. "This child of yours isn't in the transfer plan."

"He's the apprentice I took. Just sign him up for a literacy class; I'll teach him the rest myself."

"You took an apprentice too?" Bai Yu laughed. "Person Nanhai (Wu Nanhai) accepts female disciples, raising lolis from a young age. Why did you choose a male apprentice? Raising a shota?"

"Stop joking." Liu San said, "Having an apprentice means having an extra helper. I leave this child to you."

"Okay, I'll teach him well." Bai Yu guaranteed. He said to Fu Sinan: "Come, let's wash you clean first."

Fu Sinan enjoyed the full purification process here. When he came out, he was already a bald kid wearing a standard blue cloth student uniform. He seemed quite confused about his new image.

"Alright." Liu San looked satisfyingly at this person emitting the smell of plant saponin extract all over. "You have to live here for dozens of days, listen to the teachers here, and study hard. Otherwise, he will whip your butt until you can't sit down. I'll pick you up in a while."

Fu Sinan said he was ready to get beaten—which apprentice wasn't beaten by the master, mistress, and senior brothers?

Bai Yu pulled over a notebook: "What's his name, how old?"

"Fu Sinan. Eleven years old."

"The name has to be changed." Bai Yu frowned seriously. "All names like this, who can tell them apart!"

"Just call him Fu Wuben." Liu San said.

So Fu Sinan was renamed Fu Wuben. He received a sturdy cloth bag filled to the brim with two wide straps stitched on, and a small bamboo plaque tied with a rope to hang around his neck—engraved with his name and serial number. Thus, the original Lingao native Fu Sinan formally entered the system of the Transmigration Group and became Fu Wuben.

After completing the formalities, Liu San went to Bairen General Hospital to report on his trip to the countryside.

He excitedly handed the medical record of treating tetanus with TCM to Shi Niaoren: "This is great! We don't have to worry about the problem after the tetanus antitoxin runs out!"

Shi Niaoren wasn't as excited as him. He flipped through all the materials gloomily and commented:

"Insufficient clinical trials."

Although Liu San was from a pharmacy background, hearing this wasn't wrong. After all, since the advent of tetanus antitoxin in China, cases of treating tetanus patients solely with TCM were countable on one's fingers.

"But Yuzhen Powder treating tetanus is also one of the proven prescriptions."

"First, it's hard to say now that what you cured was tetanus." Shi Niaoren said unceremoniously, "No bacterial culture, no pathology report, not even a temperature record. You can't confirm he had tetanus. This violates the rigor of modern medicine."

"Second, regarding so-called proven prescriptions, it's not a minority that have been proven by modern medicine and pharmacy to be completely ineffective or even harmful—rabies also has proven prescriptions, seems to be several kinds. In fact? Once rabies starts, whether it's TCM or modern medicine, there's no cure! Without serum, it's a dead end."

"Then what to do when serum runs out?" Liu San got excited hearing his beloved TCM pharmacy being criticized as worthless. "No matter how much we save, the serum will expire eventually!"

"Mass clinical trials must be carried out. But conducting such trials now is a bit risky."

So-called risky, leaving aside transmigrators themselves, even if their recruited and trained indigenous laborers and soldiers died because of this unsuccessful attempt, it would be a big loss.

"Can't use animal experiments?"

"Put it this way." Shi Niaoren said painfully, "People here thought of everything, but no one thought to bring a pair of white mice."

"Doesn't the farm have rabbits?" With Liu San's limited zoology knowledge, he knew rabbits' reproduction rate was on par with their relative, the mouse.

"According to Nanhai, the rabbits are unwilling to have sex recently; it's too hot here. Right now there are only these few rabbits, a group of people are eager to eat meat, and you expect to use them for experiments?"

"Since animal experiments can't be done, we have to do human experiments!" Someone spoke at the door. The two looked up; it was none other than the sole psychiatrist Jiang Qiuyan. This person had accompanied the round-island expedition team to sea and hadn't appeared in Bairen General Hospital for a while.

"It's you? The expedition team is back?!" Shi Niaoren was somewhat surprised.

"Back, came back without illness or disaster!" Jiang Qiuyan looked dark-skinned, but his body was clean. He was carrying a cattail bag.

"When did you get back? The *Times* didn't publish news."

"Entered port early in the morning. I've already taken a bath, changed clothes, and eaten a meal. Others are still busy at the pier. This counts as one of the benefits of being a doctor." He continued, "Actually, just do clinical trials directly? Minister Shi, you aren't willing to try on indigenous laborers. Just do it together with 'Sending Medicine to the Countryside'."

This meant using non-system P-citizens (commoners) as clinical test subjects. Actually, this was also Shi Niaoren's real intention. However, having stayed in America for a long time, sometimes he spoke relatively implicitly.

"Mm, mm," Shi Niaoren was noncommittal, "Liu San, tidy up this treatment plan first."

This roughly meant approval. Liu San's anger also subsided. He asked Jiang Qiuyan about the results of this circumnavigation expedition.

"Great results!" Jiang Qiuyan said, pouring out several coconuts from the cattail bag, "Come, drink coconut water. We got several thousand; plenty to drink!"

"Good, good." Shi Niaoren immediately ordered everyone to be called over and got some ice cubes from the freezer. A group of doctors immediately drank iced coconut juice heartily.

"Tasty! So refreshing!" He Ma (Hippo) had just finished a clinical class for intern female doctors, sweating all over from the heat. With a cup of cool drink down his stomach, he was comfortable enough to fly. Ai Beibei refused to drink but carefully wrapped a coconut up, preparing to take it home for her child.

"Sister-in-law, just drink freely; this is extra-plan," Jiang Qiuyan said with a smile.

"There's in-plan too?" Shi Niaoren asked.

"In-plan is one per person, regardless of gender or age, regardless of job type." Jiang Qiuyan said, "In addition, heavy physical laborers and officers have extra rations. Indigenous employees can also get some, but not one per person. By the way, after drinking the water, the coconut must be handed over to the cafeteria."

"Preparing to make curry? Wu Nanhai recently transferred the *Ah San* (Indian) from the labor reform team to his farm—he doesn't mind the strong smell."
