# Chapter 288 Sweet Port Turbulence – A New Fundraising Channel

At the same time, Ma Qianzhu looked at the newly received telegram in his hands. Just reading the first line, he also drew a sharp breath. The words "Great Leap Forward" sprang to mind. Deposits—were they planning to open a bank in Guangzhou? Before the Leizhou situation was even resolved, now they wanted to cause a financial storm in Guangzhou?

Reading further, however, it had nothing to do with banking—it wasn't even a money shop. This idea hadn't actually come from the Guangzhou Station itself, but from Shen Fan, the senior manager of the Purple Treasure Studio. He'd made this suggestion not because of any advanced financial awareness, but because it was a traditional form of business capitalization in that era.

Depositing one's idle funds with a well-regarded shop, then drawing annual interest. The shop gained operating capital; the depositor earned a return on their idle money. This practice continued long after money shops and even banks appeared in China—right up until the 20th century, when faith in the legal tender finally collapsed completely. Not just large trading houses and shops, but even small cloth shops and oil-and-salt stores accepted deposits to varying degrees from local residents. Well-established shops with good reputations could attract deposits many times—even tens of times—their own capital. The great Shanxi dried fruit shops in Beijing had reportedly held deposits of several hundred thousand *liang* before the Boxer Rebellion.

For the jewelry trade—an industry that was capital-intensive and required substantial funds—accepting customer deposits was a long-standing practice. Seeing that the masters' business was thriving and their standing with peers and customers was growing, Shen Fan had proposed this approach.

The interest on such deposits was far lower than short-term loans—only 1.5% monthly, or 18% annually. By modern standards, this interest wasn't particularly high. Guo Yi even remembered that back when he was a child, the one-year bank deposit rate had once reached 12%. For shops that frequently needed to borrow for turnover, this was practically an interest-free loan.

"Who would want to make deposits with us?" They ran a jewelry store. Though Violet Sincerity Trading was a general trading house, it didn't deal in finance. For them to suddenly announce they were accepting deposits out of nowhere—who would become a customer?

"That's precisely the advantage of being in the jewelry and curio trade," Shen Fan explained. "We get access to the ladies of the inner quarters. Getting them to make deposits is easier. The wives, daughters, and concubines of great households—even favored personal maids—have private savings they want to put to use. Some have just fifty or a hundred *liang*; others have thousands or even tens of thousands." He smiled. "The bolder ones, with family power behind them, lend money. But lending requires extremely reliable agents, and middlemen inevitably skim off a cut. Word also leaks easily. So most prefer to deposit with the big, reputable establishments."

Hearing Shen Fan's proposal, Guo Yi was uncertain. Having more silver on hand was certainly good, but the Guangzhou Station wasn't short of cash flow at the moment. Taking on deposits now would mean an additional interest expense.

"Master, the benefit of taking deposits isn't just for our own use," Shen Fan continued. "The Guangzhou market sometimes has tight cash flow, sometimes loose. When it's tight, short-term lending can bring several times the interest in return!"

"With lending like this, for a business with no roots like ours, I imagine it's easy to lend out but hard to collect." Guo Yi had been in Guangzhou for several months and knew something about this.

"There's a second benefit here. The deposits come from the inner quarters of official and gentry households," Shen Fan hinted. "The women's private funds may be limited," he said, "but once word gets out, people will see Purple Treasure Studio's connections and influence in a completely different light."

By now, Guo Yi understood. These deposits wouldn't just help with their own turnover—they'd elevate Violet Sincerity Trading's status in Guangzhou! Even without using the deposited silver for lending, it would give them a protective umbrella. From that perspective, 1.8% annual interest was really quite cheap.

Shen Fan pulled out a small booklet and handed it to Guo Yi. Opening it, Guo Yi saw inside a list of names and business names written in fine brush script: "Su Ji," "Jin Yan Zhai," "Run Ji," and so on. About twenty in all.

"These are the passbooks from ladies who've recently expressed interest in opening deposit accounts with Purple Treasure Studio," Shen Fan said. "Since I hadn't received your approval, Master, I haven't accepted their deposits yet. But the account books have been prepared."

"Who are all these people?" Guo Yi looked but couldn't find any personal names.

Shen Fan pulled out another small notebook, filled with symbols only he could read—Guo Yi knew this was commercial code, similar to Suzhou numerals. Used for recording things that couldn't be made "public": transactions, names of contacts, as well as the birthdays of various high officials and their mothers, wives, concubines, sons, and daughters. He opened it and looked. "Most are the honored ladies of official and gentry families. I'll copy out a name list later, but this list must be kept confidential—"

"I understand." Guo Yi thought to himself—since these were private funds, confidentiality was paramount. Who knew that anonymous deposits already existed in the Great Ming? Truly ahead of the world.
"These twenty-odd passbooks come to about ten thousand *liang* of silver," Shen Fan said. "This is excellent business. Barring major upheaval, they typically only draw interest and don't touch the principal."

But this was too significant a matter, involving financial operations. The Guangzhou Station's three officers considered for a long time and decided it would be better to wait until the quarterly report submission to Lingao to explain this plan in person and get approval. But turning away money that came to the door would be hard to justify and might offend customers. So they agreed to let Shen Fan accept this first batch of deposits, with 1.5% monthly interest, paid without touching the principal.

The matter would have remained shelved like that. But the recent "rush to sell" crisis in the Leizhou sugar industry had suddenly strained what had been comfortable cash reserves. This project, originally just icing on the cake, suddenly took on life-saving significance. Guo Yi felt there was no time to waste and immediately brought it to the Executive Committee's table.

Having finished reading the entire report, Wu De finally relaxed. He'd originally thought the Guangzhou Station was planning some kind of financial operation—Wu De had an instinctive fear of such things. Now it turned out the Guangzhou Station was merely proposing "illegal fundraising." The interest looked high, but as a way to ease the cash crunch when the Foreign Trade Department was doing business—an actual good approach. Though he couldn't help thinking of the "bank run" risks he'd often seen in business novels. Weighing it all, he decided to support the Guangzhou Station's approach on this issue.

After sending a telegram from the *Ascending Peace Island* stating his position, the rest of the voyage was uneventful. The ship finally arrived safely at Hai'an Port early on the fifth day after departure. As soon as the ship entered port, Wu De sent someone immediately to the South China Sugar Factory to assess the situation—without real-time communication, what if things had already gone up in flames? Delivering a shipload of silver there would be walking into a trap.

The messenger returned shortly and reported that the crowd of people outside South China was still as thick as ever, but sugar-selling appeared to be continuing with no visible anomalies. Wu De knew the South China cash flow hadn't yet broken and relaxed somewhat. He ordered the crew to maintain outward calm while staying on high alert, guarding against anyone making trouble or sabotage. Meanwhile, he changed his clothes and prepared to personally visit South China to discuss arrangements for taking delivery of the silver.

Wu De's estimate was correct. South China Sugar Factory's funds indeed hadn't run out—but the moment of exhaustion was fast approaching. The night before the *Ascending Peace Island* arrived, silver reserves had fallen to less than one thousand *liang*. At that rate, getting through the next day was questionable. Everyone at South China was like ants on a hot pan. They discussed back and forth without coming up with a plan.

Wen Tong desperately hoped Chang Shide could hurry back from Champa with a shipload of rice—selling it would bring tens of thousands of *liang* to tide them over. But the *Great Whale* had vanished like a kite with its string cut, with no word at all. After waiting several days, someone from the Executive Committee finally arrived—but without the urgently needed silver, only a radio set. Wen Tong nearly despaired. What use was a radio? Fortunately, word came soon after: a ship had been sent to Guangzhou to pick up silver.

Fifty thousand *liang* was still far below the safety threshold, but for Wen Tong and his team, every day they could hang on was a victory. Getting fifty thousand transferred over meant at least another ten-plus days of buffer time.

But when the silver would arrive remained unknown. They watched the reserves dwindle day by day. As a precaution, they tried various approaches: the Liao brothers both went out to see if they could raise funds from the market. But the crushing season in Leizhou was always a time of tight cash—no shop could spare large sums. The only ones with substantial ready silver were the trading houses under Haiyi Hall, which had stockpiled hundreds of thousands of *liang* specifically for sugar purchasing. Borrowing from them would be asking the tiger for its skin.

But their attempts to raise funds couldn't be hidden from anyone. Soon, rumors spread everywhere that the newly opened South China Trading House was running out of cash and would probably default any day. The news spread from one person to ten, from ten to a hundred. The farmers, who had just begun to calm down, grew restless again. Some were even hurrying through the night to sell their sugar. The outflow of silver only accelerated.

Wen Tong was filled with regret. Had he known it would come to this, he wouldn't have let the Liao brothers go out looking for funds. No meat gained, just brought trouble on themselves. He'd basically shown everyone his hand. If the *Ascending Peace Island* didn't arrive soon, the situation at South China might become unmanageable!

As for Xiao Gui, Mei Lin, and the other visiting transmigrators—they were all helpless. Watching the situation on the verge of collapse, Chen Tianxiong said: "The way things stand now—it's 'no breaking, no standing.' Without drastic measures, I'm afraid we'll be squeezed right out of here!"
