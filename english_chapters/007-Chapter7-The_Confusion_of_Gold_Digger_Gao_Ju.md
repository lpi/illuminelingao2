# Chapter 7 - The Confusion of Gold Digger Gao Ju

Chapter 7 The Confusion of Gold Digger Gao Ju

In the mirror, an unfamiliar middle-aged man was staring at him, with distinct hair and beard, even the pores on his nose were clearly visible.

Master Gao was so scared that he almost threw the box in his hand.

He had lived for most of his life, used bronze mirrors, and seen glass mirrors from the West, but he had never seen such a clear mirror, as if taking a person's soul into it!

No wonder there is a legend in the world that mirrors can reflect demons and demons. The person in this mirror is too similar to himself! Master Gao's hand trembled, almost unable to hold it.

Fortunately, the curiosity of the merchant prevailed. He calmed down, took a deep breath, and picked up the mirror again.

This time he saw clearly. This mirror was inlaid in the box cover, shiny and bright, cleaner than the calm water surface.

"Good stuff! Good stuff!" Master Gao couldn't help praising repeatedly. Even the tribute mirrors in the palace were probably not as good as this one.

"Master, those Japanese..." The head reminded cautiously.

"Please! Please! Invite them to the flower hall!" Master Gao shouted repeatedly, "Wait, I'll go personally!"

Master Gao tidied his clothes and hat, took a few deep breaths, and strode towards the backyard.

In the backyard, Wen Desi, Wang Luobin and Xiao Zishan were standing in the middle of the yard, surrounded by seven or eight sturdy family guards holding sticks and knives, staring at them covetously.

Seeing Master Gao coming out, the family guards quickly made way.

Master Gao looked at the three people. Although they were dressed strangely, had short hair, and looked different from ordinary people, they stood upright with a dignified appearance, not like villains. Especially the leading one (Wen Desi), with a calm expression and extraordinary bearing.

Master Gao arched his hands and said: "I am Gao Ju. I don't know where the three warriors come from? Why visit my humble house at night?"

Wen Desi also arched his hands in return, imitating the tone of people in dramas: "We are merchants from overseas. We came here specifically to do business with Master Gao."

"Business?" Master Gao was stunned, "What business?"

"Big business." Wen Desi smiled slightly, pointing to the powder box in Master Gao's hand, "Like this kind of treasure, we have plenty."

Master Gao's eyes lit up. He was a sensible person and naturally knew the value of this mirror. If there were plenty of goods like this, wouldn't he make a fortune?

However, he still had doubts in his heart. These people came and went without a trace, and appeared in his backyard in the middle of the night. It was really suspicious.

"Since you are here to do business, why didn't you enter through the main gate, but broke into the backyard at night?" Master Gao asked.

"This..." Wen Desi paused, "To be honest, we encountered some trouble at sea and lost our guide, so we strayed into your residence. Please forgive us, Master Gao."

This reason was full of loopholes, but Master Gao didn't point it out. Merchants pursued profit. As long as there was profit to be made, he didn't care about their origin. Besides, looking at their appearance, they didn't seem like ordinary pirates or bandits.

"Since it's a misunderstanding, please come to the flower hall to talk." Master Gao made a gesture of invitation.

The three looked at each other and followed Master Gao to the front yard.

In the flower hall, the host and guests took their seats. Maids served fragrant tea.

Master Gao took a sip of tea and asked tentatively: "I don't know how to address the three of you?"

"My surname is Wen, Wen Desi."
"My surname is Wang, Wang Luobin."
"My surname is Xiao, Xiao Zishan."

"Oh, so it's Master Wen, Master Wang, Master Xiao." Master Gao arched his hands one by one, "Just now Master Wen said you are from overseas, I don't know which country?"

"Australia." Wen Desi said a name that Master Gao had never heard of.

"Australia?" Master Gao frowned, searching for this place name in his mind, but found nothing, "Please forgive my ignorance, where is this Australia?"

"It is in the extremely distant south, thousands of miles away from the Great Ming." Wen Desi talked nonsense seriously, "Our ancestors were people of the Great Song. After the Battle of Yashan, they fled to the sea to avoid the disaster of the Yuan soldiers, drifted all the way south, and finally settled on a large island, which is Australia."

"So you are descendants of the Great Song!" Master Gao suddenly realized, and his expression became much closer, "No wonder, no wonder. Although your clothes and hair are different from the Central Plains, the local accent has not changed."

Actually, the three of them were speaking Mandarin, which was completely different from the official dialect of the Ming Dynasty or the Cantonese dialect. But Master Gao preconceived that they were descendants of the Song Dynasty living overseas, so naturally he thought their accent was an ancient lingering sound.

"Exactly." Wen Desi followed the stick and climbed up, "We have lived overseas for hundreds of years. Although the clothes and customs have changed somewhat, the heart of admiring the Central Plains has never died. This time we sailed back, firstly to recognize our ancestors and return to our clan, and secondly to bring some local products back to exchange for some silk, tea and porcelain of the Great Ming."

"Good, good." Master Gao nodded repeatedly, "Commendable loyalty. Since you are descendants of the Chinese nation, we are one family."

Having established the relationship of "one family", the atmosphere became much more harmonious. Master Gao asked about the situation in "Australia", and Wen Desi picked some harmless things to say, describing Australia as a paradise with fertile land and abundant products. Master Gao listened with great interest and kept clicking his tongue in wonder.

After chatting for a while, the topic returned to business.

"Master Wen just said there is big business to discuss, I don't know what kind of charter it is?" Master Gao asked.

Wen Desi winked at Xiao Zishan. Xiao Zishan understood, took off the backpack behind him, unzipped it, and took out a few things from inside.

First, a glass cup.
Then, a glass plate.
Then, a set of colorful melamine tableware.
Finally, a plastic lighter.

When these things were placed on the table, Master Gao's eyes went straight.

Crystal cup! Crystal plate! And those bowls and plates with gorgeous colors and smooth texture like jade but not jade! And that small iron thing!

He picked up the glass cup carefully. It was crystal clear without a trace of impurities. It was simply the best rock crystal!

He touched the melamine bowl again. It was smooth and delicate, light and durable. The pattern on it was exquisite and unparalleled, definitely not painted by manpower!

"These... these are all products of Australia?" Master Gao's voice trembled a little.

"Exactly." Wen Desi smiled, "These are common daily necessities in our place. We brought some as samples this time. If Master Gao is interested, we can supply them in large quantities."

"Supply in large quantities?!" Master Gao gasped. If these treasures could be supplied in large quantities, wouldn't he be rich enough to rival the country?

"I wonder how Master Wen plans to sell them?" Master Gao stared at Wen Desi closely, for fear that he would open his mouth like a lion.

"We are new here and don't know the market in the Great Ming." Wen Desi kicked the ball back, "Why don't Master Gao make an offer?"

Master Gao rolled his eyes and calculated rapidly in his heart. These things were absolutely rare treasures in the Great Ming. If transported to the capital or Jiangnan, they could be sold for sky-high prices. But he was a businessman after all, and naturally wanted to keep the cost as low as possible.

"This crystal cup, I am willing to pay... fifty taels of silver for one!" Master Gao gritted his teeth and quoted a price he thought was very high.

Wen Desi, Wang Luobin and Xiao Zishan looked at each other, suppressing the ecstasy in their hearts. Fifty taels! In the Ming Dynasty, fifty taels of silver was a huge sum of money! And the cost of this glass cup was only a few yuan!

However, on the surface, they still had to pretend to be calm. Wen Desi frowned and said: "Master Gao, this price is a bit low..."

"Sixty taels!" Master Gao immediately increased the price.

"Deal!" Wen Desi agreed readily.

Next, they negotiated the prices of other items.
Glass plate: eighty taels.
Melamine tableware set: twenty taels.
Lighter: ten taels.
Powder box (with mirror): thirty taels.

After a calculation, just these few samples were sold for several hundred taels of silver!

Master Gao immediately ordered people to fetch silver and settled the payment on the spot. Looking at the white silver ingots, the three Transmigrators were blooming with joy in their hearts.

"Master Wen, when will the follow-up goods arrive?" Master Gao asked impatiently after putting away the treasures.

"Three days later." Wen Desi said, "At that time we will send the goods to your residence."

"Good! A word is settled!"

After the agreement was made, Master Gao respectfully sent the three out of the mansion. Watching their backs disappear into the night, Master Gao touched the treasures in his bosom, and a smug smile appeared on his face.

"Developed! Developed this time!"

However, he didn't know that for these three "Australian merchants", this was just the beginning. Their ambition was far more than just doing business...
