# Chapter 148: Casting Cannons (Part 1)

"Artillery Production Leadership Group's First Meeting—commence!"

In the Mechanical Plant's crude but spacious office, a blackboard was erected. Weapon enthusiasts gathered around Mechanical Group head Zhan Wuya. The atmosphere was extremely heated; everyone fervently debated which cannon type to produce.

"First, let me introduce attendees." Zhan Wuya introduced everyone. Mechanical Group's core members—Wang Luobin, Jiang Ye, Xiao Bailang—went without saying. Also came some weapon enthusiasts who didn't necessarily understand machinery: including Zhang Bailin who constantly said "cannons, more cannons" and repeatedly self-proclaimed "Artillery General"; Wang Ruixiang who loved wielding axes; Li Yunxing who'd designed mechanical crossbow structures and supervised on-site construction; Bai Yu with weapons design, engineering design, and armored vehicle command backgrounds... Finally Lin Shenhe—possessing extensive hands-on experience.

This meeting's purpose wasn't production assignment—but determining the technical roadmap. Properly called: "Technical Roadmap Seminar."

"First—don't consider whether 12-pounder mountain howitzer or Type-92 infantry gun is better. Discuss from practical and manufacturing perspectives." Zhan Wuya set discussion parameters.

From the transmigrators' machining capabilities: processing level exceeded every civilization in this world. Now with steel available, manufacturing simple steel rifled breechloaders presented no major technical difficulties. Granted, recoil guns had spring bottlenecks—but carriage-recoil guns were no problem.

Even mid-19th-century industrial levels could manufacture 15-inch cannons. Even steel wasn't needed—many super-caliber coastal guns were cast-iron. Travelers had no ironclad cruisers to fight—needn't build such monstrosities.

What did transmigrators need? Per staff recommendations: primarily equipping naval ships and gun emplacements.

"Rifled breechloaders naturally!" Li Yunxing spoke first. "Advantages are too many."

Following normal thinking, cannon range should be longer the better. This raised a question: modern cannons' increasing range was built on modern observation and fire-control systems. Travelers' sub-late-19th-century industrial level couldn't achieve this. Even using 21st-century-brought equipment—only temporary.

A 24-pounder muzzle-loading heavy gun's effective range didn't exceed 900m. Ship-mounted—due to stability—effective range dropped at least half. British Royal Navy's 18th–19th-century firing regulations specified 24-pounder long guns' maximum range at 400 yards. Relative to more common 32-pounder large-caliber carronades, this was already considerable. Combat distances between opposing ships were often under 100m.

17th-century cannons certainly wouldn't exceed this level. Travelers' naval rifled breechloaders aimed not for high power or long range—but rapid fire and weight reduction. Even if rifling increased range—should be controlled under 2000m. Beyond this, on land there might be some value—but hitting moving point-targets at sea, with transmigrators' fire-control level, became meaningless. Excessive range was pure waste.

Since range requirements weren't high—barrel length could be shortened, saving weight and manufacturing cost.

Another rifled breechloader advantage: rifled guns used pointed shells, not round balls. Pointed shells flew more stably than spherical balls. Their shape—being elongated—allowed rearward extension. Same caliber could adjust weight. Same-weight pointed shell versus round ball: the former's caliber was only ~70% of the latter. Cross-sectional area: only 49%. Meaning: same muzzle velocity, pointed shell's impact energy concentrated on half the area—unit energy twice round ball's. Considering pointed-cone's low drag—same-weight shell, pointed shell's armor-piercing was 3×+ round ball.

This meant: a 12-pounder rifled breechloader with pointed shell (~70mm caliber)—using identical propellant and charge—would have effective range far exceeding 12-pound round ball, while armor-piercing equaled 24-pounder round-ball heavy gun!

70mm rifled breechloader at 16–18 caliber length was very small—historically or modernly. Weight only 400–500kg—could be mounted on 300-ton sailships. With recoil mechanisms—even 150-ton small ships. Meaning: 70mm-armed medium sailships could fully confront British Royal Navy first-rate ships-of-the-line from the sail era's peak.

Considering vastly higher firing rate versus 24-pounder muzzle-loading cannons, plus effective range advantages—result: large sail battleships would be helpless against it, possibly even getting outmatched.

Meaning: in early-17th-century, producing such small breechloaders was completely sufficient. Against any contemporary navy or pirates—overwhelming advantage guaranteed.

"Then let's just copy Type-92 infantry gun?" Someone suggested after hearing breechloader advantages. "Type-92 is 75mm caliber, 2800m maximum range—exactly matching described performance. And Type-92 weighs only 210kg—smaller than the estimated 500kg."

"Type-92's problem is too-short caliber length—only 6—causing low muzzle velocity. For naval guns, flatter trajectories are better. Type-92 is excellent for army use."

Wang Luobin proposed: naval guns could use Armstrong gun structure—relatively mature, reliable, yet simpler manufacturing. Compared to earlier breechloaders and muzzle-loading rifled guns, its feature was introducing screw breechblock and obturator to breechloaders. Removing the breechblock—Armstrong gun resembled through-bored muzzle-loaders. Barrel casting and machining was also similar.

Armstrong's weakness: early-type locking design was very complex, unstable, high failure rate. Travelers naturally wouldn't blindly copy—could adopt screw breechblock. Technical requirements weren't too high—basically, if you could make screws, you could make this.

"Sounds simple," Xiao Bailang threw cold water. "Who knows how to actually make cannons? I think everyone's just read some books? Type-92—all made from ready-made seamless tubes. Where do we find such thick seamless tubes now?"

"Naturally casting is primary. Without large forging machines, deep-drilling requires specialized equipment." Lin Shenhe said. "I've actually cast cannons in America—though only smoothbores."

Bai Yu said: "Actually, I'm not worried about whether cannons can be made—rather, ammunition issues. Previous breechloader advantages explanations—I agree. But one point wasn't clarified: breechloader shells are harder to make than breechers themselves. Even solid armor-piercing is manageable. But HE shells, shrapnel—how to make? Pointed shell bodies require metal-drawing processes—how to solve? Shell fuzes are also issues."

Jiang Ye said: "Shell body manufacturing isn't problematic. Our equipment can make them."

"Just 'can make' doesn't mean batch production. Single-bullet production lines require 30+ specialized machines. Shells need more. Industrial capacity clearly can't support such production lines."

"Correct." Zhan Wuya acknowledged. "Also, materials might not pass." Shell bodies—whether cold-drawn or hot-drawn—required specialized round bar stock, plus specialized equipment. Not that the Industrial Department couldn't do it—but needed entire industrial system support. Otherwise, costs would be unimaginably high.

"No—old-style pointed shells weren't that complex." Lin Shenhe said. "Early breechloader shell bodies were cast-iron, lead-wrapped, with simple impact fuzes, black-powder-filled, black-powder bags as propellant, no cartridges, no primers. Firing still used igniters. Most pre-1890 shells belonged to this type. These shells wouldn't work for Type-92—but for Armstrong guns, absolutely fine."

Rifled cannon shells needed lead-wrapping to embed shells into rifling—cast-iron or steel was too hard, severely damaging rifling. Even modern shells used steel bodies (diameter smaller than rifling inner diameter) with copper driving bands (diameter slightly larger, engaging rifling).

Wang Luobin said: "But lead-wrapping has issues. I recall Armstrong guns being decommissioned after brief service—Britain returning to muzzle-loading rifled guns—partly because firing Armstrong guns caused hot-dipped lead and iron's poor adhesion, tearing off lead fragments that scattered at close range, injuring friendly soldiers."

"I don't think that's especially serious." Lin Shenhe said. "Mechanical Department people can surely devise solutions."

"Also, I personally think smoothbores can also be made." Lin Shenhe added.

Smoothbores' simpler processes had lower material requirements. If steel was insufficient—could directly use cast-iron. Early Armstrong-type breechloaders and smoothbores had nearly identical casting processes. Besides Lin Shenhe, nobody had cannon-casting experience. Using simpler smoothbores to practice, familiarizing with casting processes, was a good choice.

"I suggest the Commercial Department add smoothbores to the export catalog. Portuguese are already Ming's arms merchants—we can't let them take all the silver!"
