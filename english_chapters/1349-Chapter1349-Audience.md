# Chapter 1349 - Audience

Huang Hua held the reins lightly with both hands, letting his body rise and fall with the horse's rhythm using the method Nick had taught him. He sat very steadily, though the saddle under his crotch wasn't the modern style used in Lingao, which made him slightly unaccustomed.

He noticed that although the surrounding cavalrymen weren't tall, their bodies were sturdy—much more robust than most Ming soldiers he had seen. It seemed the Eight Banners soldiers could at least eat their fill; their off-the-charts combat effectiveness was no surprise. Those short, sturdy soldiers had dark complexions, and many faces bore traces left by a hundred battles: scar after scar. This gave their silent faces a ferocious expression.

Their posture, fully armored on horseback, was completely at ease. While riding, they almost didn't need reins, maneuvering the horses purely by knee control. Their horsemanship was far superior to the soldiers of his own Garrison Battalion—and remember, those soldiers had undergone Nick's specialized training.

If it came to one-on-one mounted cold weapon combat, Lingao's trained cavalry couldn't possibly be their match. Although Huang Hua knew the General Staff didn't rate the Later Jin army's combat capability highly, and knew Napoleon's exposition on the difference between irregular and regular cavalry, truly facing soldiers seasoned by countless trials of blood and fire still involuntarily generated a sense of fear.

He forced himself to remain calm, mocking himself privately: essentially, I really am just a small merchant. If I came to this world alone, I'd probably have been reduced to a starving corpse or a bondservant long ago.

Escorted by cavalry, the group was led outside the net-wall of the Imperial Tent, dismounting to await the audience.

At this moment, a Later Jin official outside the tent could be heard loudly announcing something in Manchu. Huang Hua couldn't understand it, but guessed it was reporting his arrival.

A Manchu official and a Han official came to the entrance to welcome Huang Hua and the others.

His retinue couldn't enter the net-wall. From the net-wall gate to the tent-palace, two lines of Bayara soldiers stood at attention, guarding strictly. Silence reigned around the entire curtained enclosure. Full ceremonial guards were displayed outside the tent-palace.

"Please unbuckle your sword, my Lord," the Han official reminded.

Huang Hua undid the sash of the command saber hanging at his waist and handed it to a soldier beside him. He took a deep breath.

"Please lead the way."

Saying this, he walked slowly toward the tent-palace following the two officials.

He had expected Huang Taiji would be sitting upright inside the tent-palace, perhaps even giving him a sudden display of authority to intimidate him. So his heart was already one hundred twenty percent prepared to react to anything. In fact, he was prepared to die.

 Yet none of this happened. When he had just walked to about a *zhang* from the tent-palace, Huang Taiji actually came out from inside to welcome him. Before Huang Hua could react, he had already performed the embrace greeting with him.

This action gave the originally guard-up Huang Hua a huge start. Fortunately, having rolled around in the business world for years, he had plenty of experience with social situations and managed not to lose his composure.

After entering the tent-palace, Huang Taiji took his seat. Huang Hua had his audience guided by the clerks, performing the three-bow ritual. Then Huang Taiji spoke two sentences in Manchu, and immediately the officiating Han official conveyed the order to grant Huang Hua a seat. Someone brought over a stool not much higher than a footstep. This made the 1.8-meter-tall Huang Hua feel rather cramped sitting there.

However, Huang Hua's perception of Huang Taiji had changed significantly. Originally he viewed Huang Taiji as a barbarian chief, a cruel and emotionless middle-aged brawler. But in that moment just now, he felt strangely moved. He couldn't help reminding himself that this was Huang Taiji's technique for winning hearts; he couldn't hold onto a loser mentality where a superior giving a little face or a kind word made him overwhelmingly excited.

It seems Huang Taiji is indeed a character, he thought secretly. Just this magnanimity to lower himself to win people's hearts isn't something ordinary people can achieve. No wonder the Three Submitting Princes, who in the original timeline had deep blood feuds with Manchu Qing and were unruly by nature, would bow their heads in obedience and serve as Manchu Qing's top enforcers in his hands.

Huang Taiji was very interested in his clothing, looking him up and down several times before speaking. He could speak Chinese, but throughout the audience he spoke only Manchu, translated by the Board of Rites clerks.

He first asked about Huang Hua's origins and intentions. This was all prepared material. Huang Hua proceeded to puff up the so-called "Great Australia," mentioning they had already established "prefectures and counties" on "various coastal islands," only lacking population, and hoped to trade with Later Jin to obtain people to populate them.

Population was the main "commodity" the Council plotted to get from trade with Later Jin. Although population transit stations had already been set up in Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Zhejiang, and the mass arrival of people after Operation Engine had alleviated the labor shortage, since this was trade, there had to be a motive—otherwise it would become aid. Let alone the Planning Commission not agreeing, even Huang Taiji himself would harbor suspicions.

For the Council, Manchu Qing's main use was as a magnet firmly attracting the Great Ming's attention and national strength. As long as Manchu Qing was making trouble, the Great Ming wouldn't have enough financial and military power to pay attention to the "Pirate Raiders" far away in Liangguang. After the First Five-Year Plan ended, the Council would inevitably enter the Liangguang region. The "Ming skin, Australian heart" model couldn't possibly continue across such a vast area. To win time for managing Liangguang, letting Manchu Qing toss and turn vigorously was the best containment method.

Overall, the Council didn't incline toward achieving goals through expensive warfare. If they could force the Ming court to compromise with the Council through Manchu Qing's containment, that would be best.

In comparison, other commodities obtained through trade, apart from horses and population, weren't worth mentioning in the overall strategy.

Huang Taiji frowned slightly when he heard the other side wanted "living mouths" (captives) and horses. Population and horses had always been the resources the Later Jin regime valued most.

Although Manchu Qing had captured large numbers of "living mouths" in previous wars, these people had mostly been distributed to Eight Banners nobles and soldiers for agricultural production and servitude. Recently they hadn't entered China proper or fought the Great Ming, so there were no ready-made captives to trade. They would have to be requisitioned from the various estates and residences.

As for horses, although the number of horses raised between the White Mountains and Black Waters was considerable, the Jurchens were generally a fishing and hunting people, not a nomadic herding people. Their horse inventory was limited; normally they even had to buy or forcibly requisition horses from Mongolia to supplement the army.

However, sourcing horses was easier to solve than population. As long as they could import enough goods from Great Australia, buying horses from the Mongols wouldn't be a problem—they could even eat the price difference. So Huang Taiji was relatively positive about this proposal.

While conversing with Huang Hua, Huang Taiji observed this "Great Australian." It was his first time seeing such attire: here in Later Jin, Koreans weren't rare—the first invasion of Korea had brought back numerous captives; Japanese occasionally "drifted in" after getting lost or hitting storms at sea. Only this Great Australian—aside from looking exactly like a Han Chinese, his dress, speech, and manner were unlike any type of person he'd met. He quickly judged that these so-called "Great Australians" were definitely not some Ming sea lord's "false pretense" as several ministers had speculated, but extremely likely a powerful force from overseas—like the Westerners currently casting cannons and training troops for the Great Ming.

Huang Taiji asked him many questions, including types and quantities of goods supplied, and how many years the trade cycle would roughly take. Huang Hua could see the other side had done their homework beforehand; clearly they placed great importance on trade with his side.

He specifically mentioned the supply of armor and also asked about the possibility of buying grain and "the Hongyi cannons used on your ships." Huang Hua gave full guarantees on armor supply. For Hongyi cannons, not knowing the Council's final decision, he could only be vague and say it needed further discussion. As for grain, he said that since Great Australia itself lacked grain, it was very difficult to sell.

"If you can persuade the nobles of your honorable country to buy grain and Hongyi cannons for Us, We will not only pay handsomely for their value but will certainly reward you heavily: beautiful women, handsome pages, fine horses, beautiful jade—you may choose at will," Huang Taiji said with a smile.

"Many thanks for the Great Khan's kindness," Huang Hua said. "Allow me to report this matter after I return."

Huang Taiji nodded: "You Great Australians come here to trade seeking nothing but profit. Though it is a pursuit of minor branches, We praise you for sailing the oceans and braving the waves to venture here. As long as you can bring goods Our Dynasty needs, We will absolutely not treat you unfairly."

Huang Hua could only murmur agreement and thanks.

Huang Taiji ordered "ke-shi" (favors/food) bestowed on Huang Hua—Manchu pastries like sachima. Then he asked some questions about the *Haitian*'s situation, while indicating he had already sent orders to Zhenjiang Fort to supply provisions for the *Haitian*.

As for the incident where both sides had briefly clashed, he didn't mention a word.

Finally he said: "Let it be done this way. Go back and rest first. Tomorrow We will send officials from the Board of Revenue to discuss details with you. We still have to hunt; you all may withdraw for now."

Huang Hua was led to a nearby tent to rest temporarily. Though it was already noon, Manchu Qing before entering the pass—like most Han commoners inside the pass—ate two meals a day. This habit continued even for Manchu emperors after entering the pass. Huang Hua's stomach was rumbling with hunger, so he had to stuff some of the delivered "ke-shi" into his stomach—the taste wasn't bad, especially the sticky millet bean buns, which tasted exceptionally good, only the sweetness was odd, seeming to use honey rather than sugar.

In the afternoon, he was summoned to Huang Taiji's side again to observe the Eight Banners soldiers' hunt.

Horns answered each other from all directions. Thousands of Eight Banners soldiers and bondservants, organized by banner colors, beat drums, fired cannons, waved flags, and shouted from all sides. Birds and beasts hiding in the grass were startled and fled in all directions. Various units, following the drum and flag signals, charged into the hunting ground in sequence, drawing bows and firing arrows to hunt the disturbed game.
