# Chapter 1501 - Centurion Lin

Liu Deshan had sold off all the raw sugar aboard *Dongshan Residence* here at highly satisfactory prices—keeping only the refined sugar goods. According to the *Hong Kong Ship-Head Paper*, prices for coarse sugar in Jiangnan were lower than the going rate in Dayuan, but refined sugar commanded better prices there.

Since they had come all the way to Dayuan, it would not do to leave empty-handed. Empty cargo holds meant wasted money. Their next stop was Shanghai, and the gentry of Jiangnan still had considerable appetite for overseas luxuries. Liu Deshan purchased American furs, high-quality European woolens, Indian printed cotton, and spices from the East Indies, then added various Western curios that the gentry favored, filling up the hold. Liu Deshan had originally wanted to buy some deerskins as well, but was informed that all deerskins and deer products had been sold to the Australians—Dayuan had none left in stock.

"Cousin, should we perhaps make another trip to Kaohsiung? We could stock up on Australian sundries. Australian goods sell very well in Jiangnan..."

"Huamin, there's something you don't understand. Shanghai has large shops that deal in Australian goods, and they've recently been well-stocked, so prices aren't high. If we bring goods there, we won't make much profit. If we had a lot of empty hold space, bringing a large batch would be better than nothing." Liu Deshan explained, "Besides, the Australian goods in Kaohsiung are mainly foreign exports. We can stop there on our return voyage from Shanghai and bring them back to Guangzhou to sell to Master Qin."

Thus they decided against going to Kaohsiung and instead sailed directly for Shanghai. Having loaded fresh water in Kaohsiung and settled all expenses, they were about to set sail when Manager Liu suddenly came to report that someone wanted to take passage to Lingao to find work.

"Did you not tell him our next stop is Shanghai? After that we're going to Shandong, and only then to Lingao."

"He said that was fine—he has no money and is willing to work for his passage."

"Oh? How did he know our ship was bound for Lingao?" Chen Huamin was somewhat puzzled, for their voyage was indeed destined for Lingao. He and Liu Deshan had already agreed that after returning to Guangzhou, they would visit Lingao to assess the "situation" and see what new goods might be worth purchasing.

"That's no secret," Manager Liu said. "He said himself that any look at this ship tells you it's an Australian vessel, and Australian vessels are bound for Lingao."

"He's a discerning fellow," Chen Huamin laughed. "But we're not Australians, and this isn't an Australian ship. He only got right the part about going to Lingao."

Liu Deshan asked, "What sort of person is he?"

"Early thirties, manner and speech suggest he's a lettered man. I caught a Cantonese accent in his speech, and when I exchanged a few words in Cantonese with him, he's clearly a native of Guangdong."

"A scholar—can he work?"

"His build looks sturdy enough, not one of those frail bookish types." Manager Liu said, "He doesn't look like a villain to me—more like the dissolute scion of a wealthy family."

"Can such a man really work?"

"He came to Kaohsiung as a deck hand, then on to Dayuan. That captain is someone I know—an old acquaintance from Guangzhou. He said this man boarded in Guangzhou and is honest and capable." Manager Liu continued, "We're already short-handed on this ship. Adding someone who can read and reckon wouldn't be bad at all, and he doesn't want wages."

"Fine, bring him along." Liu Deshan was always most persuaded by "no wages required," and he made the decision immediately.

"My infinite thanks to the two masters for this great kindness!" Lin Ming kowtowed nimbly. "I shall work diligently and repay your beneficence!"

"No need for kowtowing. I hear from Manager Liu that you're literate, a civilized man. We'll address each other as equals."

"That—I dare not presume, the two masters are the owners; how could I violate propriety?"

"Come now, the ship is cramped, and we don't stand on ceremony here. Since you're literate, can you work an abacus?"

"Yes, yes."

"Then work under Manager Liu." Chen Huamin observed that the man's bearing and speech indicated at least a middle-class educated background, yet he was dressed in rags and willing to work on the ship in such a subservient manner. He could not help but feel some sympathy and instructed someone to fetch a fresh set of short garments. "Long robes aren't convenient for work aboard ship, so make do with these for now."

"Yes, many thanks, Master."

Lin Ming bowed and hurried after Manager Liu back to the hold. Manager Liu had someone bring him a brand-new set of blue cotton trousers and jacket, saying, "Young fellow, you'll sleep in this cabin tonight and keep this old man company with conversation and chess. For now, change your clothes and come help me take inventory in the cargo hold."

Lin Ming kept smiling and agreeing. This was his do-or-die gamble. Ever since his sister-in-law had disappeared in Macau three years ago, he had expended tremendous effort, mobilizing nearly all his connections in Guangdong, desperately trying to rescue Li Yongxun.

But Lingao had become an iron fortress of the Cropped-Hair Pirates, and the Australians' methods were completely unlike those of the Ming—Lin Ming's network was almost entirely useless. It was impenetrable, and most people, upon hearing the matter involved the Cropped-Hairs, no matter how "capable" they were, would avoid it like the plague. Since the Australians had burned the Five Rams Courier Station, their power around Guangzhou had grown day by day. Nobody wanted to oppose the Australians over a mere Brocade Guard centurion. He had expended great effort and gathered quite a bit of intelligence on the Cropped-Hairs, but as for where his sister-in-law actually was, there was still no word.

These past few years, he had eaten without tasting, living in dull misery. His wife gave him no pleasant looks—understandable, really; she'd lost her maternal relative's child under his watch, and it was already quite courteous of her family not to storm over and make a scene. It was fortunate that Li Yongxun had run away from home to Guangdong on her own, so the main responsibility did not fall on him. Otherwise, Lin Ming would truly have wanted to throw himself into the sea.

Li Yongxun had disappeared on his watch, and he had to bear that responsibility. After years of fruitless inquiries, Lin Ming finally resolved: *If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cub?* Since the Cropped-Hairs' lair was in Lingao, his sister-in-law was most likely in Lingao—he would have to go there himself, infiltrate the Australians' ranks, and find out Li Yongxun's whereabouts. Dead or alive, he owed his wife an answer.

Li Yongxun was just a child; the Cropped-Hairs probably wouldn't kill her. But fallen into their hands, her fate was all too predictable. Whenever he thought of this, Lin Ming would sigh with regret—that delicate flower had been plucked by the Cropped-Hairs. If only he had taken the initiative first... If he really could rescue her, the girl would no longer be pure, and there would be no prospect of finding her another husband. He might as well take her into his own household to keep his wife company...

Naturally, Lin Ming could not share these thoughts with his wife, but she did very much approve of his plan to go to Lingao to rescue Li Yongxun. Because of this affair, she had not even dared to return to Nanjing to visit her family. Moreover, every letter from her maternal home asked after Qianqian's whereabouts, leaving her at a loss for words.

"Better sharp pain than dull ache. Instead of floundering about asking everyone for news, it's more proper to go there yourself!" Madam Lin was also from a Brocade Guard military family and supremely practical. "If you can find her whereabouts, there will always be a way to rescue her. And if her fate is truly bitter, at least we'll have closure. At worst, we'll fulfill her filial duties to her parents on her behalf!"

"What you say is right—" Lin Ming nodded repeatedly.

"But you must be careful yourself. I hear the Cropped-Hairs also have their own Depot..."

"The Song called it the Palace Interior Bureau..."

"Whatever they call it, I hear the Cropped-Hairs are adept at such things—eyes and ears everywhere, watching every word and deed. My husband must be ever vigilant."

"I understand. Wife, rest assured."

"How can I rest assured?" Tears rolled from Madam Lin's eyes. "I've already lost a sister; don't you lose yourself too! This whole family, young and old, depends on you!"

"Rest assured. I know what's at stake."

His house boasted "Five Blessings Surrounding Longevity"—and while Madam Lin was "understanding of righteousness," the four concubines were not pleased. After all, Li Yongxun's life or death had little to do with them, and they were unwilling under any circumstances to see their husband risk his life. Some weeping and fussing was inevitable, but fortunately Madam Lin governed the household with method and authority. Between admonishment and persuasion, she managed to bring them all around.

With household affairs settled, Lin Ming had to consider how to reach Lingao.

Getting to Lingao from Foshan was simplicity itself: From Foshan to Guangzhou, go to the Dabao Shipping agency at the Tianzi Wharf and buy a ticket, and within two or three days at most, you'd be on a ship to Lingao. For those with money, there were tidy passenger cabins; for those without, the steerage on cargo ships was still reasonably clean.

But Lin Ming did not intend to go to Lingao that way. He had already inquired among those who had been to Lingao—all outsiders entering or leaving Lingao were subjected to strict interrogation. He himself was most skilled at apprehension, and aside from the fact that he knew too many people in Guangzhou, his appearance—neither merchant nor scholar—would immediately attract the attention of the Cropped-Hairs' Depot agents the moment he appeared at Bopu Wharf.

To work as an agent, one first had to keep a low profile and blend in with ordinary folk so as not to draw attention. But having been a Brocade Guard for more than twenty years, his manner and speech carried an "official air"—he would give himself away without saying a word. After much deliberation, Lin Ming decided on a roundabout approach. Specifically, he would not depart from Guangzhou but set out from somewhere else.

He decided to go first to Kaohsiung—a newly opened Australian territory overseas. He had heard it was a place where all peoples mingled; he could easily conceal his identity there, then take a ship from Kaohsiung to Lingao. This way, not only could he hide his trail, but he could also investigate the situation with the Cropped-Hairs in Kaohsiung along the way. Since the Cropped-Hairs had defeated Zheng Zhilong and swept Zhangzhou Bay, interest in this force had grown among both court and commoners. Lin Ming estimated that within three to five years, the court would inevitably clash with the Cropped-Hairs in another great battle. The intelligence he gathered on the Cropped-Hairs would then be just the thing for promotion and fortune.

His plans set, Lin Ming truly committed himself: disguised as a destitute scholar, carrying only a little silver, he quietly slipped into Guangzhou alone and boarded a merchant ship bound for Kaohsiung as a hand, specifically doing accounts and paperwork. He worked diligently aboard, and despite constant seasickness and not being a deck hand, he put his heart and soul into helping with everything. He earned the captain's high regard.
