# Chapter 361 - The Foshan Journey (Part 10)

"They may look crude, but the scale is truly impressive," Huang Tianyu observed. Every foundry he visited was bustling with activity, flames roaring, whether casting bronze or iron—all extremely busy. The scale of operations was already quite considerable. The open yard of just one workshop held dozens of bronze and iron cannons of various sizes and lengths, leaving Huang Tianyu dazzled.

The cannon casting in these workshops still used the traditional clay mold method, but the craftsmanship was quite refined. However, in Huang Tianyu's view, these were all old-style cannons—either *Hu Dun* (tiger-crouching) cannons or Francophone guns. Even the largest were merely Great General cannons; none were the legendary Western-style red barbarian cannons.

"There are many foundry workers here, and their wages are surprisingly low," Huang Tianyu said quietly back in their room. "I inquired—only the lead craftsmen earn one or two taels per month. Ordinary workers are paid by the day; many can't even afford to marry. Life is very hard. With the wages we offer, recruiting workers shouldn't be difficult."

"What about the ceramic workers you wanted to recruit?"

Liu San wasn't a member of the Industry Committee, but as the leader of this business trip, all matters had to be discussed with him before action.

"Even worse off." Huang Tianyu's expression was grave. "I won't lie—today I saw my first mass grave with my own eyes. Not far from a large kiln, the bottom of the pit was nothing but piled bones. Workers who die with no one to collect them are just tossed in. In the half hour I was there, several bodies were thrown in. The living workers don't look much better—they all look like little ghosts from hell, covered in soot from head to toe. I hear many workers are unemployed. Recruiting them should be even easier than the foundry workers."

"Go ahead and start recruiting then." Liu San said. "But we're strangers here with no official status, so we can't do this openly. If officials come asking what we're recruiting workers for, what do we say?"

"We probably can't hang out a recruiting sign, but we can work through personal connections." Huang Tianyu said. "First approach one or two workers, then have them recruit others willing to go to Lingao. The first batch doesn't need to be large—a dozen or so is enough. Once they've experienced the benefits, we can send them back to quietly recruit more."

"Good, let's do that." Liu San pulled a fifty-tael note from his robe. "Tomorrow I'll go to Yang Runkai Hall to break this into smaller bills, then you can pay out settling-in fees. Give two taels of silver to each worker willing to go. Don't forget—make sure they press their thumbprints on the contracts!" He opened a small jewelry case he kept for important documents and extracted a stack of pre-printed contract forms.

"Qiwei has a branch office here in Foshan," Liu San said. "Once you've gathered the workers, take them to the branch office in batches to make contact. Someone will arrange their departure." He handed Huang Tianyu an ivory chit. "Here's the token."

The two were in the middle of their secret discussion when a commotion arose outside. Chen Tong came running in to report: "Master Liu, there's a beggar who insists on seeing you."

"A beggar?" Liu San frowned, thinking for a moment. It was probably the young beggar he had treated earlier that day. "Give him a few hundred *wen* and send him away."

"I gave him money, but he wouldn't take it," Chen Tong said. "He says you saved his life and wants to meet you in person to kowtow in thanks."

"Fine, bring him in." Liu San nodded helplessly. Sometimes doing good deeds led to inconveniences.

Moments later, a sturdy young man strode in. It was indeed the man Liu San had treated that afternoon. But in just a few hours, he had fully recovered. His walk was powerful and vigorous, with the bearing of a martial man.

Seeing Liu San, he immediately dropped to his knees: "Huang Andé thanks Doctor Liu for saving my life!"

"No need for such formality, please rise." Liu San helped him up, thinking he'd definitely need a bath before sleeping tonight—this fellow gave off a pungent mixture of odors he couldn't quite identify.

Huang Andé stood up. He had Mongolian eyes, high cheekbones, and a straight nose—quite different from the local physiognomy. His eyes, though not large, were bright and spirited. His manner and bearing didn't suggest a professional beggar accustomed to fawning on the streets, nor did he seem like a typical timid countryman. Liu San found himself somewhat favorably impressed. He told Chen Tong to bring five hundred *wen* and a bottle of Plague-Repelling Powder to give him.

"No, no, I couldn't!" Huang Andé shook his head repeatedly. "I came specifically to kowtow to my benefactor in thanks. The pharmacy assistant said if not for your immediate treatment, my life would have been lost."

"Saving lives is the duty of us physicians. There's no need to speak of benefactors." Liu San put on a sincere expression, not mentioning that his real purpose had been advertising. "You have no money now, and it's the height of summer's heat. Take these to have on hand just in case."

Huang Andé said nothing more but bowed deeply once more, then turned to leave.

Liu San noticed his muscular arms and some scars on his hands. Something stirred in his mind, and he quickly called out to ask:

"Might I ask, Brother Huang, what was your former occupation? How did you fall into such straits?"

"I used to work at a foundry here," Huang Andé said gruffly. "Had no real skills—just sold my strength for food. The foreman said I ate too much and had too bad a temper, so he dismissed me a few days ago."

A foundry worker—convenient indeed. Liu San and Huang Tianyu exchanged glances. They had the same thought: keep him. The young man had strength and some foundry experience. With proper training back home, he could become a good worker. At worst, with his physique, he'd make a fine soldier—1.7-meter recruits were still quite rare.

Huang Tianyu said: "Brother Huang, I have a property in Qiongzhou Prefecture that happens to need workers. Since you have nowhere to go, why not come with me to Qiongzhou?"

"Go to Qiongzhou?" Huang Andé rolled his eyes in thought. "No! I've heard that place is full of miasmas and plagues. Go there and you'll likely die."

His refusal was quite blunt. Liu San laughed: "This property is jointly owned by myself and Master Huang here. With me there, what's there to fear? I guarantee your safety."

Huang Andé hesitated at this, then asked after a moment: "Will there be meat to eat?" He quickly added: "Even once every ten days or half a month would be fine! I'm not a greedy man."

"Yes." Liu San's answer was direct. Currently, the New Army and heavy laborers in the Industry Department received a diet standard that included fish daily and meat weekly. Not large quantities, but absolutely guaranteed.

"Then I'll go with you!" Huang Andé nodded, then knelt again to kowtow: "Master!"

"No more kowtowing." Liu San found this fellow charmingly straightforward. A pity he wasn't material for studying medicine, or he'd have kept him by his side. "Just sign the contract."

"I have to sell myself?" Huang Andé looked reluctant. "If it's selling myself into bondage, I won't go. I don't like being someone's slave."

"It's not selling yourself—it's a labor contract. Don't you have to sign a contract when you work as a long-term laborer?"

"Alright!" He nodded.

He pressed his thumbprint on the document. Liu San asked if he had any family here that should accompany him, or if he wanted two taels of silver as a settling-in allowance.

"I'm a bachelor here, no family. No need for silver. Following the master means there'll be meat to eat." Huang Andé grinned broadly.

"Where are you from?"

"Human feces?" Huang Andé scratched his head. "I'm not human feces."

"I mean, where is your hometown?"

"I'm from Shandong, born and raised in Dengzhou." Huang Andé said. "Couldn't make a living in Dengzhou anymore. Heard a buddy of mine was transferred to Guangdong for garrison duty, so I came to seek him out for a meal. But then..." At this point he suddenly stopped.

So this Huang Andé had hidden circumstances. "Transferred"? Combined with his manner and bearing, Liu San guessed he was probably a deserter from the government army. A deserter was a deserter—as long as he could work, it didn't matter.

Liu San instructed Chen Tong to take him for a bath first, find a barber to trim his hair, and buy him two sets of clothes from a secondhand shop. He also told Gao Di to air out their formal attire, in preparation for tomorrow's banquet at that Mr. Lin's residence.

That day happened to be Madam Lin's twenty-eighth birthday. The entire household was in a festive mood. Nearly every prominent merchant and gentry member of the area had come to pay respects, with a steady stream of guests offering congratulations, making the Lin residence extraordinarily lively.

The Lin family were neither merchants nor gentry. The reason everyone valued him so highly and fawned upon him was that he was the Probationary Centurion of the local Embroidered Guard Centurion's Office—effectively the second-in-command. The actual Centurion, old Centurion Liu, was elderly and befuddled. Apart from collecting his monthly stipend, he had long since stopped involving himself in the Centurion Office's affairs. By modern terms, Lin Ming was the Office's de facto chief administrator.

After the midday meal, Lin Ming saw off the morning's guests and ordered tables of fruits, cakes, and refreshments set up in the inner courtyard, inviting close relatives and friends to enjoy the opera together.

On the temporarily constructed stage in the courtyard, performers were presenting Kunqu opera. They had hired Zhang Qiao, a famous Kunqu performer from Nanhai County—excellent both in appearance and singing. The audience watched, enraptured.

In the place of honor below sat the guest of honor, Madam Lin. In Foshan, Madam Lin's appearance had always been a topic of local discussion—high nose, deep-set eyes, slightly curly hair. Her eyes were a brownish-brown color, giving her a resemblance to a Persian beauty. This Madam Lin was indeed a descendant of the *Semu* people—her ancestors had served in the Embroidered Guard for generations, holding middle- and lower-rank positions such as Bailiff, Minor Flag, and Sub-Flag. In terms of social standing, she was well-matched for the Lin family.

According to the laws of the Great Ming, *Semu* people were not permitted to marry among themselves. So after three hundred years of intermarriage, they were no different from ordinary Han Chinese. Women with such distinctively *Semu* features as Madam Lin were quite rare, which was a source of particular pride for Centurion Lin—he had married her even though she was a year older. Everyone agreed that Centurion Lin had rather unique tastes.
