# Chapter 1184 - The Sand Junk Guild

Hirado had become prosperous thanks to Great Ming merchants. It was also Great Ming pirate-merchant Wang Zhi who had led the Portuguese to Hirado. And unlike the Portuguese, Great Ming merchants only cared about business and didn't insist on the Japanese accepting any religion. The Portuguese, by contrast, always demanded that local commoners and daimyō accept Christianity.

Since the Portuguese arrived, Southern Barbarian ships had constantly come to Hirado. Though Hirado was just an ordinary small island, its prosperity earned it the title of "Western Capital." This trade relationship with Portugal lasted fifteen years, but the Portuguese kept trying to spread religion, which met fierce opposition from the Matsuura family.

At the time, Kyushu's daimyō were joining Christianity as if chasing a trend, while the Matsuura family's stubborn resistance was extraordinary. They were more devoted to Buddhism.

The Portuguese were deeply displeased with Hirado's response, and feelings between the two sides cooled. Then another incident occurred—Hirado residents and Portuguese sailors came to blows at Miyamae, killing and wounding over a dozen Portuguese. After that, Portuguese ships abandoned Hirado.

During this period, the Matsuura family and the Portuguese even had maritime clashes. In the eighth year of Eiroku (1565), when a Portuguese ship from Macau was passing through the Hirado Strait en route to the Christian daimyō's port of Ōmura, the Matsuura family dispatched fifty small boats to attack. The Portuguese ship had to deploy all its firearms to fight free from danger.

Replacing the Portuguese were the Dutch and English. The Matsuura family knew these two countries weren't Catholic and weren't interested in spreading religion, so they were very well-disposed toward them. Thus Hirado still received regular visits from Western European ships. But the Matsuura daimyō fully recognized that what could permanently benefit this island were Fujian and Zhejiang ships, so they granted Great Ming merchants on Hirado extraordinary freedoms and privileges in residence and activities.

"Speaking of which, Ikkwan actually got his start in Hirado."

Hamada Shinzō said in mellow tones of intoxication, and began recounting various past exploits of the pirate-merchants in Hirado.

Because trade was inseparably linked with Ming pirates, the Matsuura family allowed rising pirate leaders to live in Hirado, continuing to trade with them.

The first to call himself "Boss of Japan"—that is, chief of the Wakō—was Yan Siqi. He had lived right there in Hirado's castle town. Legend had it he ran a tailor shop at the time, appearing as a tailor. Business was quite good. Shinzō said: Yan Siqi was outstanding, learned, and skilled in martial arts. Among the Chinese in Hirado, he was a remarkable figure. But at the time, no Japanese knew his true identity. Until one day, two pirate-merchants named Yan Zhenquan and Chen De came from Fujian and had secret talks with this Tailor Yan for several days. Soon after, Yan Siqi's figure vanished.

At that time, the Ming Dynasty's pirates were divided into eighteen groups. The various leaders acclaimed Yan Siqi as their supreme chief. For a time, his reputation on the seas was formidable. But not long after, Yan Siqi died in Taiwan after getting drunk and catching an illness.

"The second to call himself 'Boss of Japan' was Ikkwan," Hamada Shinzō said. "It's said Zheng Zhilong was Yan Siqi's son-in-law. Others say he wasn't. Regardless, Ikkwan did marry a wife here—a woman named Tagawa. He often used the name Tagawa here."

The new generation of leaders no longer openly revealed their residences like Wang Zhi's generation, or directly purchased estates from samurai families. Zheng Zhilong had specifically chosen Kawauchi-ura, not too far from Hirado, as his residence. A mansion more magnificent than a samurai's fortified compound was built deep in a bay among the hills. But this mansion was now empty—Tagawa and eldest son Fukumatsu had gone to the Great Ming several years ago, leaving only second son Jirōzaemon in Japan.

Ping Qiusheng knew this Jirōzaemon had lived his whole life in Japan, continuing as the Japanese branch of Zheng Zhilong's line. But he wasn't interested in that. What interested him was how much power Zheng Zhilong actually had in Hirado, and who his agents here were.

"What agents does Ikkwan need here?" Hamada Shinzō laughed loudly, but the laugh carried strong resentment. "The Lord of Hizen is his agent."

Most of Zheng Zhilong's ships went to Nagasaki, but each year a few ships also came to Hirado. The cargo on ships coming to Hirado was mostly purchased directly by the local domain lord. This arrangement greatly benefited both sides—the domain lord gained enormous profits from reselling, while the Zheng family gained every convenience from Hirado, including hiring Japanese sailors and ronin from here, and replenishing firearms and gunpowder.

Ping Qiusheng thought: so Hirado was Zheng Zhilong's base in Japan! But he still had some doubts: "I heard Ikkwan is a Kirishitan believer. Doesn't the domain lord most dislike Kirishitan believers?"

"Whether Ikkwan is Kirishitan I don't know, but he worships Mazu—the goddess Great Ming merchants worship most—and also worships Shinto gods and Buddhas. He can't possibly be Kirishitan, can he? Aren't Kirishitan forbidden from worshiping other deities?"

Ping Qiusheng nodded. Clearly, Hirado's Matsuura family could be treated as "enemies."

From the start, Hamada Shinzō had shown the intense interest that young people in this timeline often displayed toward the time-travelers—whether it was the glass-bottled rum they'd brought or Ping Qiusheng's pistol. While making small talk with Hamada, Ping Qiusheng was observing this young man, pondering how he might use this person to deliver a heavy blow to Zheng Zhilong.

The day after the banquet, led by Hamada Shinzō, Ping Qiusheng toured this so-called "Western Capital" of Hirado. Since summer had just begun, few ships had yet arrived from Fujian. The docks were quite quiet.

Hirado itself was a very barren island. Without maritime trade to sustain it, this place would be a typical impoverished backwater just like the Gotō Islands—and if not for that poverty, the local commoners wouldn't have sailed their small boats across the sea to become Wakō pirates.

Everything was ready; all they needed was the east wind. Ping Qiusheng gazed out over the Hirado Strait from the Portuguese Market wharf. How were Zhao Yingong's preparations coming along?

On the other side of the sea, after receiving the telegram, Zhao Yingong was planning the first ships to Japan.

The Planning Commission hadn't allocated him any ships—the Planning Commission had no ships to give. After the prolonged and intensive shipping operations of Operation Engine, aside from a few vessels maintaining regular routes and combat readiness duties, all ships had returned to port for maintenance. Wu De had made it very clear: no ships were available for his use.

"You need to allocate resources locally," the Planning Commission's reply stated. "Make full use of Great Ming resources."

This meant Zhao Yingong had to arrange his own ships and organize his own cargo. The latter was easier. Jiangnan was after all a wealthy and prosperous region where any kind of goods could be purchased. But arranging ships capable of going to Japan was somewhat difficult.

In the Song Dynasty, Jiangsu and Zhejiang had been the main ports for traveling to Japan. But by the Ming Dynasty, due to strict maritime prohibitions, not only had ship tonnage shrunk, but navigational technology had also regressed. In the Tang and Song eras, Chinese merchant ships could cross the East China Sea directly, sailing straight to Hizen's Matsuura District. By the Ming Dynasty, this had changed to requiring island-chain navigation using coastal landmarks. Zhao Yingong thought ships capable of reaching Japan were easy to find—in this era, vessels of just one or two hundred tons deadweight could circumnavigate the globe, let alone make the short voyage across the East China Sea. But finding sailors capable of piloting ships on the voyage across the East China Sea was another matter.

Still, Zhao Yingong believed that as long as they were given proper navigational guidance, crossing the East China Sea to trade with Japan would by no means be difficult. Chinese sailors had plenty of courage—they had just fallen behind technically. As long as someone showed them the way and set an example, with sufficient incentives, they would unhesitatingly take on the task.

For this purpose, Zhao Yingong had specially come to Shanghai. He had several major tasks to accomplish here.

First was to contact the sand junk guild. Shanghai itself had sand junk guilds run by major merchants, specifically operating the so-called Northern Ocean trade—sailing north to Shandong, all the way to Tianjin, carrying various "Southern goods," then returning from Tianjin to Shanghai with "Northern goods." This business was huge during the Qing Dynasty, with annual sales of several million taels. It didn't reach that level during the Ming, but the total volume was still not small. This shipping capacity was the most suitable target for his designs.

Second was to organize export cargo for Japan in Shanghai, while establishing a specialized organization to implement the plan. Trade with Japan was a very important and complex matter; he had to set up a dedicated organization to handle it.

At this moment, Zhao Yingong was seated in his sedan chair, on his way to meet someone—an exceptional figure among the sand junk guild.

This person was named Shen Tingyang. Shen Tingyang was from Chongming County, Suzhou Prefecture. His fame was closely tied to late Ming ships and navigation. The only attempt at "converting grain tribute from canal to sea transport" during the late Ming was proposed and directed by him: In the twelfth year of Chongzhen, Shen Tingyang submitted *A Book on Maritime Transport* to the Emperor, expressing his wish to build sand junks and restore sea transport. After the Emperor approved, Shen Tingyang raised funds and built sand junks. Soon after, Shen used sand junks to ship Huai rice, sailing the sea route that Zhu Qing had once used, reaching Dagu and Tianjin in ten days—restoring the Northern Ocean shipping lane.

After the fall of the Ming, in the first year of Hongguang, Shen Tingyang memorialized the court, hoping to convert the hundred ships he owned for sea transport into warships by adding sailors, specifically for use as Yangtze river naval forces.

After Nanjing fell, he and various generals commanded several thousand land and naval troops with hundreds of ships, making their way to the Zhoushan Islands. There Prince Lu enfeoffed him as Vice Minister of War concurrently holding Vice Minister of Revenue, with overall command of Zhejiang-South Zhili naval forces.

In the first year of Yongli, when Shen Tingyang led his fleet from Zhoushan to attempt a counterattack on Suzhou, he encountered a storm off Chongming Island and suffered a major defeat. Shen Tingyang's warship capsized at Xuliujing; most of his soldiers drowned. Shen Tingyang was captured and died unyieldingly.

This man, whether in terms of practical ability or national integrity, was exceptional. Compared to the many scholar-officials who died for the Ming cause, his ability to get things done was obviously very strong.
