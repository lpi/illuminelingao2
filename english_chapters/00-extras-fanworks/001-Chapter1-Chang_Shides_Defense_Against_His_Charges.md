# Chapter 1: Chang Shide's Defense Against His Charges

Author: Debuchángshī (SB Crew)

Since this is an inquiry hearing, the accused should at least be permitted to respond to the charges.

I, the defendant Chang Shide, hereby object to the accusations leveled against me and submit the following defense:

**1. The Dangers of Commerce Abroad.** This point requires no elaboration.

**2. Integrating with the Locals.**

During the Ming Dynasty, merchants who traveled far and wide often indulged in pleasures along the way. Even those who ventured into the unsavory reaches of the northern steppes dallied with Mongolian women whose yurts reeked to high heaven the moment their garments fell—hence certain colorful nicknames. Given these circumstances, we who serve as the window through which our enterprise presents itself to the world, the bridge connecting us to outside society—were we to adopt the airs of celibate monks, refusing to integrate with ordinary locals or conform to their customs, we would invite isolation and even rejection. Consider what I have done: I purchased several girls, provided them with food and clothing, gave them work and exposure to advanced culture, and through them gained insight into the actual lifestyles and habits of the local population. As for whatever mutually consensual matters may have occurred in between—even the locals consider this perfectly normal. Comrade Wen, on the other hand, clung to his Puritan façade of virtue, only to invite malicious speculation about his preferences. Is that what serves our fellow transmigrators' interests? Learn from this, comrades. *Learn.*

**3. Women and "Our Own People."**

Though we number five hundred, it should be obvious that when the day comes for us to venture among the common folk, to understand their thoughts and habits, to spread our gospel—will we not need "our own people" whom we can trust? I submit that this is plainly a matter beneficial to the great cause of transmigration. Furthermore, comrades, do not forget: in this era, as masters with absolute control over their persons, our possession of them is actually to *their* benefit. It signals that they have earned their master's trust and established a foundation for advancement at his side. I invite everyone to recall that decadent feudal harem fantasy, *Dream of the Red Chamber*—the maids in that novel scheme and plot endlessly for a chance to seduce their masters. Is this not a fine example of healthy, ambitious young women showing initiative? Thus, on one hand, this demonstrates their trust in us (bricks fly: "You mean '*you*,' not '*us*'"), and on the other, it demonstrates our trust in them (bricks continue to fly: "You mean '*you*,' not '*us*'")...

**4. Defense Regarding the Use of Public Funds.**

I acknowledge the accusation that I used public funds to purchase these girls, but I must clarify certain objective circumstances:

*4.1* When I departed for Leizhou, I left my point coupons and the vast majority of my silver behind in Lingao, untouched. Apart from a dozen or so taels of loose silver for petty expenses, I had only the public funds that Comrade Wen and I jointly managed. Under these circumstances, our residence, our food and clothing—all depended on these public funds. But I can assure you that every expenditure, including the money spent on the girls, followed proper usage protocols and reimbursement procedures. (Bricks fly: "Words are cheap—where are the receipts?" "In this era, you can write your own receipts...")

*4.2* As I mentioned, every penny spent on these servants came from public funds. *However!* Have you calculated the price? A mere fifty taels of silver (according to the discussion in Chapter 49 of Volume Three, the bundled total was ten taels, though here I calculate at ten taels per person). Those of you who have visited the human market know what servant girls typically cost. You also know what wages you must pay workers. Now do the math: for fifty taels, I essentially acquired five female workers and immediately established Leizhou's internal infrastructure and hospitality apparatus, freeing up considerable manpower for actual work. Was that not worth it? I saw girls in the market priced at dozens of taels apiece, dolled up and fair-skinned, but I did not make a move. Why? Brothers, this is the transmigrators' own silver—how could I not be frugal with it?

*4.3* Back when I lived in the collective dormitories in Lingao, I bunked with everyone else. I remember something said during the pre-crossing training phase—whoever said it may have forgotten, but I remember. (I am pleased to see some faces blushing among my accusers.) As a transmigrator, I have earned my rightful share of income since we landed—not much, but a decent sum of silver. Since some of you still find my use of public funds inappropriate, I shall say no more. The situation at the time was that I had no cash on hand; very well then, consider this my repayment to the collective. Deduct the sum from my accumulated wages.

**5. Humanitarianism.**

I, Chang Shide, do not pretend to be a pious saint. Since crossing over, I have fired guns and killed men. I enjoy practicing with my ghost-head saber, and with my dark complexion I carry an air of menace. But those who know me well understand that I am a gentle, conscientious young man—solid with the brothers, humane even with prisoners. You have all seen the malnourished folk around Lingao—this is common in this era. But when I saw these girls in the market, they were more wasted than the frailest villagers we had ever encountered here, practically skin-and-bone livestock. (Comrade Wen mutters: "Was it really that bad? They didn't look that bad when we brought them back.") We are all youth raised under the red flag, grown up in New China. When we see these women beaten near death under the whips of wicked slave masters, and when we consider that our purpose in coming here—apart from liberating ourselves—is to save the suffering masses still struggling under the evils of feudal society... With these thoughts, who could endure such torment of conscience and still bother to worry about how much money to spend, or whose money it is, in order to rescue them? (Comrade Wen mutters: "Just now you were bragging about your bargaining skills and how little you spent; now you're claiming you didn't care about the money?") I simply could not bear to leave them, so I used the money to buy them from the traffickers. By the time we brought them to the doorstep of the Leizhou office, one had already fainted from hunger—truly a sight to move the hardest heart to tears. (Comrade Wen mutters: "And there come the tears. Old Chang, you really are quite the actor.")

**6. A Suggestion for Everyone.**

I, Chang, have spoken at length today. On one hand, when I acted previously, circumstances were urgent and I was stationed in a remote outpost, with no time to report in advance. So now I have laid out the full sequence of events for everyone. With this understanding, I trust there will be no further criticism of me.

On the other hand—ahem—as a former member of the "work by day, self-serve by night" brigade, I have drawn upon my personal experience to conduct, shall we say, an atypical experiment in the domestic bliss of shut-ins, from which certain lessons and insights have emerged. I share these with everyone now. In the future, heh heh, they may prove useful...

I, Chang Shide, rest my defense.
