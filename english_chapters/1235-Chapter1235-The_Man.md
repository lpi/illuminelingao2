# Chapter 1235 - The Man

This ultra-idealistic transmigrator had been living an almost Puritan existence. Besides completing his various tasks for the General Construction Company, he spent time in his dormitory every day sketching and practicing his art skills. Since oil paints couldn't yet be produced domestically and contemporary oil paints and brushes were hard to obtain even in Macau, he could only use charcoal sticks to constantly practice sketching and quick drawing. Every historical building in and around Lingao town had been drawn by him. In the town and countryside, one could often see Elder Qi standing in wild weeds or atop ruins, sketchbook in hand, rendering some dilapidated structure. His figure could also be seen clambering over crumbling old buildings. Thus Qi Feng had earned a nickname in the Senate: "The Liang Sicheng of Lingao"—he'd always rather regretted not having a Lin Huiyin for company.

Though what he drew was all Chinese classical architecture, Florence and Venice were the places he longed for most—and of course Vienna, Paris, Edinburgh, Nuremberg, and Kyoto as well. Only the future Empire's cities would be more perfect, more distinctive. He was never seen at transmigrators' various political salons.

Like Ji Runzhi, he frequently sketched drafts of future imperial cities—from a single doorframe or eave detail to an entire city skyline, he wanted to draw it all himself. But the General Construction Company had never given him a chance to realize his dreams. After Ji Runzhi went to Sanya, he'd been drafted as a stand-in planner, but his actual work remained drawing grids and roads—worse than when he'd been a structural engineer.

Trini's arrival had most changed his work focus—because he knew both Italian and had an art background, serving as Trini's interpreter while training the next generation of artists had become his main task.

As a fervent believer in "Western Art Catholicism," Italy was his Jerusalem. He'd chosen Italian as his second foreign language back in the day, hoping someday to make a pilgrimage. Now an authentic Italian painter had arrived—so Qi Feng became Trini's best buddy, discussing art together almost every day. He'd even learned contemporary oil painting materials preparation and many traditional techniques from this Italian.

Qi Feng discovered that Trini's oil painting technique was far superior to the arrogant university professors of his student days. No wonder the art world spoke of traditional European oil painting with such reverence. Even this nobody's skill left him in the dust—let alone painters who'd earned the title of "master."

Of course, Qi Feng also had many new concepts to share with the Italian. Their friendship had deepened, and Qi Feng had gradually reformed many of the Italian's "bad habits"—like the hygiene practices of bathing and keeping short hair.

Mei Wan was quite happy to kick this planner—who never compromised on anything involving aesthetics—out to the seaside to discuss art with his best buddy, while incidentally designing and supervising the trading house development zone construction. Qi Feng himself was even happier, of course. In his view, Lingao's Bauhaus school had reached the point of obsession in applying their artistic philosophy.

Qi Feng was very tall with handsome features. After several years on construction sites, his skin was dark and his muscles firm. His entire silhouette looked very rugged—imposing when serious, but when he smiled, it was like a spring breeze. Li Huamei felt her heart inexplicably beat faster.

After exchanging greetings, everyone took their seats. Trini rarely had female visitors, so he had his students put away their equipment and leave. He personally brewed red tea and served as company—this Italian now thoroughly disliked that filthy, bath-averse Dutch servant. If not for knowing the fellow had been sent by the Company to monitor him, he'd have fired and kicked the Dutchman out long ago. Through the Colonial and Trade Department in Lingao, he could hire cleaner, more capable servants.

Trini had been looking gloomy for some time—ever since he'd been sweet-talked by Mendoza into displaying gentlemanly chivalry and taken on a 66% annual interest loan to ransom a "noble Spanish gentlewoman." Most aggravating was that in the end, this honor had been stolen by some "Count Lando" who'd appeared from nowhere—also supposedly an Italian.

But the transmigrators who'd lent him money had refused his request to repay immediately without interest: borrowed money had to accrue interest—even immediate repayment required a full year's interest. Result: all of Trini's savings were wiped out.

He'd spent all his savings and gotten nothing for it. This depressed him greatly. Fortunately, the Senate still valued his skills—commissions kept flowing in, so he had no choice but to work even harder serving the Senate.

Qi Feng deeply sympathized with Trini. To further ease his burden and help him earn more money, he'd pulled Trini into the newly-established trading house development zone project—responsible for rendering effect drawings and exterior designs, plus many interior and exterior decorative works.

Poor Mr. Trini worked day and night, at least fourteen hours daily—rivaling many transmigrators in workload. Fortunately, he had a pile of students to exploit. To maximize exploitation, he naturally had to teach them everything he knew.

His studio had expanded. The useless reception room had been demolished—these modular wood-framed houses designed by Zhang Xingpei were very convenient for interior modification. The enlarged studio was fitted with more workbenches, easels, sculpture stands, and other equipment. The naturalized students following him now numbered over forty.

The corner where they sat chatting was Qi Feng's arrangement—a special area for receiving guests and discussing art. Deliberately raised slightly above floor level, with bamboo railings, modular rattan sofas, floor-to-ceiling bay windows facing a green little courtyard, scattered greenery in planters at varying heights on all sides, and two watercolors on the walls—the whole effect was very artsy.

Qi Feng and Trini often held forth on art here. Mr. Trini was quite puzzled by Qi Feng's comprehensive knowledge of Italian art history—even he, an actual Italian, didn't know as much. The schools, lineages, works, and characteristics of Italian artists since the Renaissance—Qi Feng knew them all like the back of his hand. Many of these artists whose works even Trini had never seen, yet this Australian knew everything about them. Simply astonishing.

"Elder Qi is building the trading house district now. He will show you his outstanding works today." Trini's Mandarin, though oddly accented and grammatically strange, had at least reached the point of being understandable.



"Please offer your critiques," Qi Feng said. Most transmigrators were quite modest in everyday dealings—even someone like Skade, who treated human life like grass.

"Miss Li, please offer your critique too."

"I... what would I know... they're really... really beautiful! All those buildings outside... you drew them yourself, Chief? You're so... so amazing." The rest went on in her head: *Oh no, why am I dressed in these rags? I want to die! No face to show! Virgin Mary above, Mazu above, just strike me with lightning.*

"Please don't call me 'Chief'—too formal." Qi Feng smiled. "Just call me by my name."

"Qi... Feng..." Li Huamei felt calling him that way was quite embarrassing.

Li Huamei's maiden heart had finally stirred. Ever since her sister had run off with a man who supposedly looked like an anglerfish, she'd had no good impression of men. At 17, while accompanying the young miss to socialize with Macau's municipal councilors, one attendant had gotten handsy with her while tipsy. He'd ended up with two front teeth knocked out. If Li Siya hadn't appeared in time, his manhood probably wouldn't still be attached. That incident had cost Li Siya a small fortune, and Li Huamei, feeling guilty, had only grown more averse to men.

Li Huamei wasn't a muscular amazon—she actually looked rather slender. But she'd been raised since childhood as the young miss's bodyguard, with strict training in both Eastern and Western martial arts. This woman moved quick as lightning—whether with curved sword, straight sword, or staff, few of the Li family pirates could get close. The result was that men who knew her kept their distance, and Li Siya, for selfish reasons, hadn't been willing to marry off this milk-sister. Now she'd become an old maid.

Over the years, braving storms and several narrow escapes from death, she'd become increasingly indifferent to matters of the heart. But her fully matured body kept sending her brain the most primal instinctive signals.

"This is the finest red tea—from South Sea Farm's Assam Tea Garden. It's a special supply for transmigrators—you can't buy it outside. Try some."

Qi Feng's lips curled into a slight smile. The smile was like a ray of early summer sunshine, piercing into her maiden heart—warm, bringing a wave of heated emotion.

Li Huamei felt her throat go slightly dry. She unconsciously tugged at her skirt hem. She picked up the teacup.

The cup was exquisite colored floral bone china, crystal-clear. Li Huamei had seen them in Macau and knew they were the finest porcelain the Australians made—comparable to the best Ming porcelain.

She took a small sip of the bitter, fragrant tea—the aroma was quite peculiar, hard to get used to, yet she couldn't help saying: "Excellent tea." As she spoke, she stole another glance at him from behind her bangs.

Qi Feng, for his part, was oblivious like every male lead in a shoujo manga—he only found this legendary, storm-commanding female pirate who'd driven the Navy young turks wild quite interesting. Especially seeing her in that ill-fitting, baggy, short, faded naturalized worker's uniform, sitting there all fidgety—he couldn't help being secretly amused.

After some casual chat, Qi Feng suddenly remembered he should ask the female pirate to make a shipping run for him. The destination wasn't far—just a day's voyage to the Jiazi Coal Mine's dedicated dock. He wanted to visit the Jiazi Coal Mine.
