# Chapter 1382 - Rice from Changying Granary

To obtain 50,000 shi of rice in the Southern Zhili area was not something an ordinary merchant could accomplish. Shen Tingyang said he would also try to find a way - Wuhu on the Yangtze River was a large grain distribution center, and perhaps a considerable amount of grain could be raised there. He aimed to gather it within a month. Zhao Yingong returned to the Qiwei Shanghai Branch and summoned Mao Sansheng to discuss this matter.

Since arriving in Shanghai, although Qiwei mainly operated logistics business, Mao Sansheng had handled many goods and accumulated quite a bit of knowledge through exposure.

"I'm afraid buying rice in bulk recently won't be possible." Mao Sansheng said, "We have business dealings with merchants in several rice markets. Recently bulk prices have risen sharply, and they are holding back sales: bulk releases are in amounts of tens or one or two hundred shi. Buying one or two thousand shi in one go is difficult."

Qiwei Warehouse's main business was warehousing and logistics, dealing most frequently with bulk goods merchants like rice hongs, so Mao Sansheng's words were naturally reliable.

"I need to raise 50,000 shi of rice now, and I need it within a month."

Mao Sansheng sucked in a breath of cold air: "Master, this is a bit difficult."

"If you put some thought into buying, how much can you get?"

"By running to every household and relying on past favors and face, we can probably gather over ten thousand shi. It's just that the price is hard to say." Mao Sansheng indicated that the final average price might exceed three taels of silver.

"So expensive!" Zhao Yingong was unwilling.

"If we can buy the rice at this price, this lowly one already feels we should be burning high incense."

"Alright, you send people to handle it first. Buy as much as you can. Transport all purchased rice to Shanghai."

Ten thousand shi of rice was still far from the target. Although Zhao Yingong felt there were many difficulties, he could only brace himself to stay in Shanghai and coordinate rice purchasing matters.

Although the Southern Zhili region suffered constant natural disasters, it was one of the few places under Ming rule at the time that could still be called "stable." Social order was generally normal, so grain supply could still be called sufficient. Although the price of husked rice was rising and rice merchants were holding back sales, rice could still be bought as long as one was willing to pay.

Originally, rice prices at this time were constantly rising. The large-scale purchasing actions of Shen Tingyang and Zhao Yingong caused rice prices to start rising continuously. Originally, rice prices in Southern Zhili, Anhui and other places were lower and could still flow to the severely grain-short Zhejiang this year to supplement the shortage. But with the continuous increase in purchase quantity, large amounts of grain and rice began to flood toward Shanghai where transport conditions were more convenient.

Rice prices in the Hang-Jia-Hu region, which suffered floods and droughts last year, had originally benefited from relief grain distributed by the Famine Relief Bureau and price-stabilizing sales, dropping slightly for a time. At this moment, rice prices began to rise, quietly breaking through three mace per dou. Rising for fifteen consecutive days, by mid-June, Hangzhou's rice price had risen to three mace six candareens, approaching the famine price of four mace.

Far away in Shanghai, Zhao Yingong was completely unaware of this change. Although various social and financial intelligence reports were sent to his desk every week, he was busy purchasing grain and coordinating commercial contracts with Liaohai Hong, and had no mind to attend to them.

Despite both Zhao Yingong and Shen Tingyang spending great effort, they only bought over 20,000 shi of rice in half a month. At this rate, they probably wouldn't be able to gather 50,000 shi by the latest departure time in July.

Zhao Yingong worried about this every day, constantly considering whether to send a distress telegram to Lingao. Although given the current situation, Lingao could manage to transport 20,000 shi of husked rice to him, this would seriously affect his image.

Just when he was in this dilemma, things took a turn. Wu Zhixiang suddenly came to visit him.

After coming to Jiangnan, Wu Zhixiang had successfully joined the Fushe Society by ingratiating himself with Zhang Dai and several other key Fushe members in Hangzhou. Relying on his active enthusiasm for society affairs, he quickly became a relatively well-known Fushe member in Hangzhou Prefecture. Knowing that advancing through the imperial examinations was extremely difficult for him - even Fushe wasn't willing to arrange for an unlearned silk-pants dandy like him to pass the provincial exam - he spent money to purchase the title of student of the Imperial Academy. Currently, he was waiting for an opportunity to get a recommendation from Fushe and get an official position through the connections of Donglin grandees.

Wu Zhixiang had connected with Zhao Yingong early on through Zhang Dai and others. Relying on his experience interacting with Great Master Guo in Guangzhou back then, he was convinced beyond doubt of Zhao Yingong's identity as a "bandit." He just didn't expose this layer. Zhao Yingong knew his background and also intended to win him over, so both sides began interacting with mutual understanding.

Fushe had long known about Shen Tingyang undertaking the Liaodong grain and pay transport - this matter had indeed succeeded only with the support of Fushe and Donglin. Therefore, the Merchants Bureau joining in was no secret either. In Fushe's view, although Zhao Yingong wasn't a Fushe member and had a suspicious "bandit" background, he was a fellow traveler of Fushe on the issue of abolishing canal transport for sea transport. Because of his Catholic faith, his relationship with Xu Guangqi and others was not shallow, making him an important ally for the Donglin-Fushe group which urgently needed support from cabinet grandees.

What Wu Zhixiang brought was exactly what Shen Tingyang and Zhao Yingong dreamed of: rice - ample rice. Not only more than enough to fill the 30,000 shi shortage, but even asking for more would be no problem.

The rice wasn't in Jiangnan, but the distance wasn't far either. The key was that transporting it to Shanghai wasn't difficult. As long as both sides agreed on terms, delivery could be made very quickly.

As for the price, it wasn't expensive either. Transported to Shanghai, it would be just two taels of silver per shi - even if not transported to Liaodong, selling it locally could make money.

Although Zhao Yingong was happy in his heart, he also had great doubts: pies don't fall from the sky. He really couldn't figure out where in this Ming realm one could easily take out tens of thousands of shi of cheap rice.

If he didn't know Wu Zhixiang's family background and his "performance" in Guangzhou back then perfectly clearly, he would probably have directly regarded him as a swindler.

"Where is the rice?" Zhao Yingong pressed.

"Qingjiangpu."

Zhao Yingong secretly cried out in shame; he had actually forgotten this place!

Qingjiangpu belonged to Shanyang County of Huai'an Prefecture. Although itself just a town, since Chen Xuan opened the port in the early Ming and canal transport replaced sea transport, this place had become a transportation hub for north-south land and water transport.

When Chen Xuan managed canal administration in the early Ming, he created the "branch transport" system for tribute grain. That is, transit granaries were built in key towns along the canal like Huai'an, Xuzhou, and Linqing, each accepting tribute grain delivered by civilian boats from designated areas. The Changying Granary was located in Qingjiangpu. 1.5 million shi of grain from Jiangxi, Huguang, and Zhejiang were transferred and stored here. Perennial grain reserves were over a million shi.

Since there was a large granary, there were inevitably countless rats, big and small. revolve around this big warehouse. Those in canal transport, those managing the warehouse, from the Ministry of Revenue director managing warehouse affairs at the top, down to warehouse clerks moving grain and rice, canal soldiers on boats... countless types of people eating from the canal. Of the 4 million shi of tribute grain transported to the capital every year, transport costs and losses along the way amounted to a staggering 8 million shi. Qingjiangpu was the largest of these blood-sucking conduits along the route. It was not surprising that large amounts of granary rice accumulated here available for sale.

Wu Zhixiang certainly couldn't be counted as a "rat," but his father was currently serving in the Ministry of Revenue. He had a share in the benefits from the Changying Granary in Qingjiangpu.

The "benefits" accumulated in Qingjiangpu had to be turned into silver to be spent. From the Minister down to bureau officials in the Ministry of Revenue, anyone who could get benefits from Changying Granary faced this realization problem.

In the past, these small benefits were nothing, handled by specialized people. But this time the amount of grain to be realized was large. Not only Wu Zhixiang's father's benefits, but also the savings accumulated by many people in the Ministry of Revenue. Ordinary merchants didn't have this strength, so Wu Zhixiang thought of this Master Zhao with the bandit background. When he was in Guangzhou, he knew the bandits had a very robust demand for grain, basically only importing and never exporting. Master Zhao couldn't be uninterested in this.

Both sides quickly reached a relevant agreement: Wu Zhixiang should transport 30,000 shi of husked rice to Shanghai before mid-July at the latest, surplus accepted. The Merchants Bureau would purchase at a CIF price of two taels of silver per shi.

"Is there any problem transporting 30,000 shi of rice on schedule?" Zhao Yingong was somewhat uneasy. In an era with backward transportation and communication, long-distance transport of bulk goods was calculated in months. Transporting so much rice from Qingjiangpu to Shanghai was not an easy task even with a month's time.

"Master Zhao can rest assured. This happens to be the time when canal boats wintering in the north return south. There are plenty of empty canal boats in Qingjiangpu. Those transport soldiers are all willing to carry cargo on the return trip to earn a bit more."

"Good, then I'll wait for good news." Zhao Yingong nodded. "It's a deal."

"It's a deal." Wu Zhixiang's face flushed with excitement. This was his first time concluding such a big business deal! Thinking of how his father and brothers would view him, he couldn't help but feel light as air. For years he had the status of a dandy. Although his family didn't restrict him much, letting him loaf around in Guangzhou, he was looked down upon by his family after all. He himself also felt inferior.

Zhao Yingong exhorted him again that if there were any mishaps in transport, he must notify him as soon as possible, and he would arrange for Qiwei Warehouse to relay.

"No hindrance, I can definitely handle this matter." Wu Zhixiang promised with all his might.

"Good, then I rely entirely on you, brother." Although Zhao Yingong felt somewhat uneasy, his promise was payment upon delivery. Even if this dandy had some accident in the grain transport process, it didn't have much to do with him - at worst, the cheap grain wouldn't arrive, and he would earn less money. If the transported rice was traded at a CIF price of six taels per shi, the profit of 120,000 taels would be enough to hand over Guan-Ning's military pay and pay all miscellaneous fees along the way. The transport fee paid by the court for this would be pure profit for the Merchants Bureau.

This Young Master Wu had been very close to Guangzhou Station back then, belonging to the youth deeply poisoned by "Australian decadent culture." Moreover, his family were Guangxi natives, always listed as potential cooperation targets for the Council of Elders. Now was a good opportunity to see how capable Young Master Wu was and whether he was qualified to be a future "collaborator" of the Council of Elders.
