# Chapter 1051 - The Military Control Commission

All in all, Jeju City could simply serve as a massive refugee camp. Beyond that, Daejeong County seat could also be put to the same use. Only Jeongui County seat would be difficult to utilize effectively unless special water supply facilities were constructed for the town. Of course, relying on natural rainfall to supplement daily needs was not impossible—that was how the local population had been living all along.

"Let's put Jeju City to use first—the port conditions here are the best, and there's an abundant water supply." Feng Zongze spoke, though a hint of hesitation crept into his voice. "The only concern is that it's a bit close to the Korean mainland. I wonder how capable the Joseon navy is? I hear those turtle ships are supposedly quite formidable."

Though Feng Zongze was not a military cadre, he was keenly attentive to the security of the base. With tens of thousands of refugees soon to be concentrated in Jeju City, the place would become a massive hornet's nest. If they were caught off guard by a sudden attack, the resulting chaos would be catastrophic.

Currently, the Yi Dynasty's land forces on the island had essentially collapsed. The remaining garrison troops at various outposts were few in number and weak in combat strength—mere lingering ghosts at the bottom of a pot, posing no real threat.

The greatest danger lay in a counterattack from the Korean mainland.

Given Jeju Island's geographical position and its long history of suffering from Japanese pirate raids, it was unlikely that the Yi Dynasty government lacked contingency plans for launching counteroffensives and relief operations should Jeju fall into danger. Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do, which faced Jeju Island across the sea, both maintained naval forces that could cross the strait to interfere at any time.

As a child, Feng Zongze had read *Five Thousand Years of World History* and had developed a deep impression of the miraculous turtle ships. For the first twenty years of his life, Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his turtle ships were the only things he associated with ancient Korea.

According to historical intelligence provided by the Grand Library, combined with information gathered by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau through questioning merchants and interrogating prisoners and refugees, the Yi Dynasty's main naval forces were distributed across the "Three Southern Provinces": the Left and Right Naval Commands of Gyeongsang-do, the Left and Right Naval Commands of Jeolla-do, the Naval Command of Chungcheong-do, and the Ganghwa Island Naval Command.

A glance at a map of the Korean Peninsula revealed that although the peninsula was surrounded by sea on three sides, its maritime defenses were primarily oriented toward the south and west. The south faced the Great Ming, while the west faced Japan. One was a hostile nation that had repeatedly invaded with covetous eyes; the other was the suzerain state to which Korea practiced "serving the great." Yet secretly, the Yi Dynasty had always harbored deep wariness toward both neighbors. Facing the Great Ming, the Chungcheong-do Naval Command responsible for guard duty would not be deployed.

As for Ganghwa Island, it was the historical "backup" for successive regimes on the peninsula—or, to use a more elegant term, the "place of royal refuge." Should the nation face crisis, the king would flee there. Important royal family members, whether for protection or surveillance, were sometimes placed there as well. Prince Gwanghae, deposed several years prior, remained imprisoned on the island. The Ganghwa Island Naval Command's mission was to "guard the home front," and would not be mobilized unless something seriously threatened the nation's very foundations.

Among these naval commands, those of Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do were the strongest and served as the main force for "preparedness against the Japanese." It was precisely these that the Jeju Expeditionary Force would likely have to face.

The most likely to launch a counterattack was Jeolla-do's naval command—Jeju Island was administratively part of Jeolla-do. Once news of Jeju Island's fall reached the Korean mainland, the Jeolla-do forces would almost certainly launch an offensive as a matter of duty.

According to records from the third year of Chongzhen, the Right Naval Command of Jeolla-do possessed a total of nineteen warships. The Left Naval Command was probably similar in scale, meaning the combined fleet amounted to no more than forty warships. Each vessel carried approximately eighty-five to one hundred soldiers and sailors. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau estimated these ships had a standard displacement of roughly fifty to one hundred tons.

Nangong Wudi remarked, "According to the people at the Grand Library, there's nothing to worry about. The Joseon navy was just squeezed dry by Sun Yuanhua. Their current strength is quite weak."

The Yi Dynasty's naval power had been virtually annihilated during the two Japanese invasions. Not only had the invasions consumed the dynasty's warships, but the prolonged war of attrition had also severely depleted Korea's timber resources for shipbuilding. During Prince Gwanghae's reign in the Tianqi era, a court debate had once proposed building a hundred warships to replenish the navy and strengthen coastal defenses, but timber shortages meant only twenty or thirty vessels were actually constructed.

Then in 1631, Sun Yuanhua had sent representatives to Joseon to purchase warships. Though the Yi Dynasty's fleet was already insufficient, not wanting to offend the Great Ming, they had still delivered forty warships to Sun. This brought the dynasty's ship count down to an extremely low level. If the Left and Right Naval Commands of Jeolla-do managed to field thirty warships, that would already be considered good. The entire Yi Dynasty navy had at most fifty to sixty seaworthy vessels. Given the difficult circumstances facing the dynasty, these ships were likely in poor condition as well.

Never mind deploying the four hybrid-powered gunboats against such an enemy—even the Special Operations Boat Squadron alone would be more than sufficient to sweep aside the Joseon navy and control the waters around Jeju Island.

Nangong Wudi was in the middle of his animated presentation on "Why the Joseon Navy Is Not to Be Feared" when Feng Zongze's secretary entered to report: the Special Reconnaissance Team had delivered their captives—County Magistrate Li Qiu of Daejeong and County Magistrate Choe In-gyeon of Jeongui.

"Take them away for now and keep them under watch. Don't let them commit suicide," Feng Zongze quickly instructed. Although they had captured a batch of local officials during the conquest of the three towns, they had not gotten any of the top administrators. Capturing two county magistrates was still quite valuable.

"Should we interrogate them?"

"Let the Political Security Bureau people handle the interrogation. We don't need to concern ourselves with them right now—let them stew a bit first." Feng Zongze believed there was no need for him to personally get involved. The clerks of the Six Offices knew far more about Jeju Island's affairs than the county magistrates ever did. When it came to interrogation, the disciples trained under Zhou Dongtian were far more professional. His role as an Exemplar should be devoted to "political work."

Unlike the Great Ming, Joseon was currently a place where the transmigrator collective could not easily extend its hand directly. Cultivating and nurturing pro-Exemplar official factions would prove quite useful for the Exemplar Council's next steps in Northeast Asia.

That said, the Grand Library had not provided a definitive answer regarding the integrity of Yi Dynasty officials. Without the crucible of dynastic collapse that the Ming had experienced, there was no way to judge the true mettle of the officials and scholar-gentry whose names appeared in the historical records.

Still, the Yi Dynasty and the Great Ming shared many commonalities—the thought patterns of their bureaucrats and literati were probably not so different.

Currently, Lingao controlled a number of Ming Dynasty civil and military officials who had come to serve either willingly or reluctantly. Though their actual usefulness had yet to be demonstrated, keeping them around cost little in terms of provisions. Should the need arise, they could be put to use. The same logic applied to Joseon officials.

For the moment, Feng Zongze's political work was not focused on them. Among the exiles on Jeju Island, there were many individuals similar to the Pak brothers. Compared to those still riding high, these people—bearing criminal labels and having fallen from the clouds into the abyss—would prove far more useful.

He ordered the clerks responsible for managing the official slaves to be brought before him and instructed them to compile a comprehensive list of all exiles currently registered who were former officials or members of the literati class, along with their family members.

The Yi Dynasty's factional struggles were extraordinarily fierce. Starting with the 1595 succession dispute between Prince Imhae and Prince Gwanghae, over thirty years of continuous strife had raged from court to palace chambers, with hardly a day passing without intense partisan warfare. The Great Northerner, Lesser Northerner, and Westerner factions had risen in succession. After the Great Northerners emerged victorious, they further splintered into Major and Minor Northerner factions, with the Minor Northerners subsequently dividing into Clean Minor and Murky Minor sub-factions.

Following the downfall of the Great Northerners and the decline of the Minor Northerners, the Westerner faction resurged and engaged in fierce competition with the Southerners. Eight years prior, the "Injo Restoration" had placed the Westerners in power, but this in turn prompted the Westerner faction to split into the Merit Westerners and Clean Westerners.

After this back-and-forth of mutual attacks and denunciations, the Later Jin's first invasion in 1627—the "Jeongmyo Disturbance"—gave rise to still more divisions: the Young Westerners who advocated for peace negotiations with the Later Jin, and the Old Westerners who opposed it.

The intense court factionalism caused officials to rise and fall like figures on a revolving lantern. Every round of political struggle produced a new batch of exiles. These fallen bureaucrats might not be qualified builders, but they could at least serve as collaborators during a transitional phase.

After several days of work, Feng Zongze established Military Control Commissions in Jeongui, Daejeong, and Jeju. He personally served as chairman of the Jeju commission. The commissions in the other two counties were headed by garrison platoon leaders, with work team leaders serving as vice-chairmen.

Beneath the Military Control Commissions, "Interim County Magistrates" were established. Their structure continued to follow the Yi Dynasty's Six Offices system, even retaining the original petty clerks. Vacancies caused by flight or death were filled by local civilians, allowing the existing administrative apparatus to resume operations. For the most part, the content and form of their work remained unchanged from how things had been under Yi Dynasty rule.

The county magistrates were directly controlled by their respective County Military Control Commissions. Needless to say, the Military Control Commissions were the supreme authority. They supervised the operations of the interim magistrates and issued various directives.

This approach would inevitably have many drawbacks, but at present they lacked sufficient qualified naturalized cadres. They could only temporarily rely on the old system to obtain local resources. Once Shandong refugees arrived in large numbers, more reliable personnel could be cultivated and selected from among them to gradually replace these temporary institutions.

As a constraint on the extensive use of personnel from the old system, the military forces of each interim county magistrate—the "Security Army"—were specifically composed of official slaves selected for their "deep suffering and bitter hatred." Former Yi Dynasty soldiers were not used. A security force composed of such individuals possessed fierce desires for vengeance and would be merciless when striking against the old system and its people.

From the moment they entered the city, the Pak brothers had been extremely active—especially Pak Deok-hwan. He seemed to have completely forgotten his earlier intention to marry and produce heirs to "continue the family line." It was as if he had found meaning in life once again. Dressed in naturalized personnel uniforms, he worked tirelessly for Feng Zongze day after day—one moment drafting proclamations, the next taking inventory of warehouses, then leading teams to arrest "hostile elements," and appearing at "propaganda briefings" soon after. He was so energized that he had no desire to eat or sleep, and his voice had gone completely hoarse.

In truth, much of what the "Chief" had explained to him remained beyond his comprehension. Yet a flame had ignited in his chest: he felt valued by others, feared by others. This alone filled his entire being with strength.
