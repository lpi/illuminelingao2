# Chapter 343 - Acids and Bases (II)
    
Raw lacquer harvested from lacquer trees was unafraid of almost any corrosion, whether water, strong acid, or strong alkali. Lingao didn't produce lacquer trees, but Guangdong had plenty. The Industrial and Energy Committee imported some; Xu Yingjie mixed a large vat of it to a suitable consistency, then soaked straw ropes in it to replace asbestos ropes and water glass. However, he also paid a price—although he wore full-body protection, his hands still got "paint bite" (lacquer allergy). His fingers were all swollen, and he had to rest for several days in a row.

Ji Situi casually picked a jar and tried the threaded lid: "This jar is not bad. To maintain long-term production, the demand for chemicals like sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid... will be huge in the future." Ji Situi said, "I have another list, for chemical equipment. Hurry up and organize people to make them."

"Make more?" Xiao Bailang complained incessantly, "I haven't had a good sleep for three or four days. The ceramic factory only has a dozen people including coolies. This work is too much!" He took the list, which listed over thirty large and small water vats of different sizes, and some other ceramic ware.

"Making so many water vats! Are you making pickles?"

"It does have something to do with salt," Ji Situi said, "They are all for engineering use. Hurry up, please."

"Then give some overtime pay. The ceramic artisans here have been working day and night recently."

"Ask Wu De for overtime pay; where would I get circulation coupons." Ji Situi wasn't interested in the welfare of the natives, "Didn't they work day and night firing kilns in Fujian too? Did kiln owners give them overtime pay?"

"You capitalist are too black-hearted..."

Ji Situi interrupted his complaining: "I need this urgently; please hurry up."

After the jars were transported back, Ji Situi built a straw shed next to the sulfuric acid plant and slept for a while. At night, after 12 hours were up, he instructed people to rake out all the firewood with iron rods, immediately organized people to load a layer of crushed stones about the size of ore into the furnace, and then loaded wood into the four hearths to light the fire.

Seeing the fire was strong, Ji Situi instructed workers to add top-quality Hong Gai anthracite; the firepower immediately became fierce, and flames shot up from the entire sulfuric acid plant.

"Alright, except for people watching the furnace and adding fire, everyone else go rest. Come back to start work the morning after tomorrow!"

Seeing he didn't need to do much for now, Ji Situi rushed to the next construction site—the Caustic Soda Workshop.

The Synthetic Ammonia cum Combined Alkali Plant could only produce soda ash. Caustic soda, used widely in industry, was relatively easier to produce, and raw materials were simple too—salt electrolysis. Not only could caustic soda be obtained, but many useful by-products could also be produced, including another important chemical raw material: hydrochloric acid. Saving the installation of a dedicated hydrochloric acid production line was the benefit of the chemical combined manufacturing method.

Even the Ministry of Light Industry had been eyeing the caustic soda issue—this concerned two fist products of the Ministry of Light Industry: white paper and soap. Ji Situi decided to settle it all at once this time.

"Herding one sheep is herding, driving two sheep is also driving; let the able do more work." Ji Situi thought while walking towards the caustic soda workshop. Just then, a train delivering building materials to the caustic soda plant passed by. He hurriedly jogged a few steps and climbed on, planting his butt on a pile of reed mats.

"Who is it! Do you have a death wish climbing the train!" Someone on the traction tractor in front roared.

"You count as a train?"

"If not a train, what is it?" While talking, this train had already arrived at the construction site of the caustic soda workshop, which was under construction.

Ji Situi got off the car and saw the person wearing a safety helmet turned out to be Bing Feng—it seemed this caustic soda plant workshop would definitely be a steel frame structure.

Sure enough, this caustic soda workshop was crude enough, but compared to the sulfuric acid workshop currently exposed to the open air, at least it had a cover—the electrolysis workshop involved electricity issues and couldn't be exposed to wind and rain. The entire building was a frame structure of brick columns and wooden beams. Except for a few key areas with walls, other places were all open-style, conducive to ventilation. The precious and fragile transformer had a separate transformer room with glass windows for easy observation.

The total area of the workshop was about five hundred square meters. The ground was paved with bricks. Chang Kaishen was leading Ling Tian and several indigenous apprentices to install a transformer: converting alternating current sent from Bopu Power Station into direct current, so it could be used for electrolysis.

Ten electrolytic cells had been installed in place. Ji Situi originally considered purchasing ready-made ones, but the weight made him give up this idea. Finally, only core components were purchased from the another timeline. The tank body was manufactured locally. Square tanks formed by weaving steel bars and pouring cement and yellow sand, each tank 1.4 meters wide, 0.8 meters long (text says wide again, likely length), and 0.4 meters high. The inside of the tank was lined with ceramic tiles to avoid corrosion. An iron wire mesh was inlaid flat inside the tank 0.1 meters from the bottom. Each tank was also equipped with a wooden lid coated with wood tar asphalt for corrosion protection.

The heavy reinforced concrete electrolytic cells were supported by a hardwood board, suspended on two brick-built bottom supports as an insulation measure.

Ji Situi checked the quality of each tank, for leaks and insecure tile lining. He found that linoleum coated with wood tar asphalt was also laid between the supports as an extra insulation measure. Being careful was never wrong—400 Amperes of current, this was no joke.

"Can this be safe?" Ji Situi looked at this makeshift appearance. He really felt uneasy.

"Roughly safe, can't say absolutely." Ling Tian said, "Using electricity still relies on being careful yourself. Pay attention to wearing labor protection supplies and doing safety education well."

"The pressure is so heavy." Ji Situi already foresaw that the chemical plant wouldn't be peaceful in the future, "Indigenous methods kill people."

He walked around again. Outside the house, a chlorine absorption tower assembled from water vats had been set up. The chlorine gas produced during electrolysis would react with slaked lime in this tower to obtain bleaching powder. It was a cheap, effective, and widely usable disinfectant.

Returning from the caustic soda workshop and resting for a while, the furnace warming work was finally almost over. At this time, everyone who had any relation to chemical engineering came.

"We are going to go without sleep for two or three days continuously." Ji Situi said, calling people to drag out several boxes from the shed. "These are protective suits; distribute them first, don't lose them! Now you can't find a single mask or pair of goggles anywhere!"

Ji Situi brought a lot of various labor protection supplies used in chemical engineering—these things couldn't be replenished anywhere for a while. He brought enough consumables for almost ten years.

Everyone put on full sets of protective suits, wore labor protection glasses and chemical masks. Then work started under Ji Situi's command.

Ji Situi first closed the blocking plate of the chimney, then pulled open the drawing plate of the converter. Turned on the blower. he constantly measured with thermometers at various inlets. When the inlet temperature of the First Converter reached 450℃, Ji Situi instructed people to open the top cover of the converter and load quartz sand and catalyst. Then covered the top lid well and smeared acid-proof mud—with soda ash industry, water glass was no longer a rare item, and porcelain powder was even less so, so Ji Situi had no intention of saving at all, sealing both top lids tightly without stinginess.

Seeing him seal the top lids, Xu Yingjie led people to start adding crushed ore into the furnace. 20 kilograms per furnace. Then closed the furnace door. At the same time, added 98% concentrated sulfuric acid collected from the Planning Committee warehouse into the absorption tower as a starter to begin acid circulation.

Ji Situi tested the sulfur dioxide concentration at the outlet of the First Converter; at this time it was already close to 70%. He knew sulfuric acid production was basically successful. After acid circulation started in the absorption tower, 1.5 liters of acid were showering every ten seconds. The tower temperature had risen to 60℃, so he instructed people to turn on water cooling.

In this way, ore was added to one furnace every hour, four furnaces circulating feeding and slag removal, and the indigenous sulfuric acid plant started running like this. As long as stable feeding and firing were maintained, a workshop of this scale could operate 345 days a year, producing 98% concentrated sulfuric acid.

Ji Situi and others didn't have time to cheer for this great moment, but busy working while explaining production key points to indigenous workers—on-site observation was more intuitive than pure classroom teaching, adapting to the cultural level of indigenous workers.

Of course, once running, unless maintenance or other urgent matters occurred, the furnace wouldn't be stopped—after all, warming the furnace took a long time and a lot of fuel, which was economically very uneconomical.

However, Ji Situi only had 20 tons of pyrite in total; running at full speed, it would be consumed in less than a month. When pyrite would be transported again depended on how fast shipbuilding was—but by that time, sulfuric acid from coal coking should be mass-produced. Sulfuric acid production here wouldn't be too important. Ji Situi was already considering that if sulfuric acid from the coal chemical plant was enough, he could use the equipment here to make ammonium sulfate from pyrite as fertilizer.

The first batch of 98% concentrated sulfuric acid was produced; they were carefully loaded into custom-made jars and sealed well. Then the outside of the lid was sealed with plaster of Paris mud. A pottery "basin" was covered on top—to prevent rain.

"Does this method work?" Xu Yingjie was used to seeing modern industrial packaging; now suddenly seeing earthenware jars looking identical to yellow wine jars, he found it inconceivable and had a very unreliable feeling.

"Sulfuric acid has been produced for two hundred years. Rest assured. They were all packaged like this in the past." Ji Situi said.

After pasting labels of "98% Concentrated Sulfuric Acid," production date, and production location on the jars, they were carefully loaded into wooden crates specially made by the woodware factory, one or two per crate. Straw ropes were wound around jars inside the crate for shock absorption cushioning. Then they were loaded onto the train and transported to the chemical hazardous goods warehouse.

After the initial victory of sulfuric acid, Ji Situi led indigenous workers to produce while teaching for more than ten days, until the indigenous workers basically mastered the production technology and process, and memorized all safety production regulations.
