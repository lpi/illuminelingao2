# Chapter 149: Casting Cannons (Part 2)

"No rush to become arms-merchants." Zhang Bailin said. "We can equip smoothbores ourselves—too many firepower-gaps now. Three blockhouses along Bopu-road have no cannons. Bairren Fortress has zero. Also, we'll eventually build native-armies. Native-armies can use smoothbores for artillery-units. Later when converting to Armstrong-guns—we'll have trained qualified-gunners."

As an artillery-fanatic, Zhang Bailin cared most about his dreamed artillery-corps. Any cannon was better than none.

Everyone found this suggestion reasonable. Even ignoring manufacturing-costs and native-army needs—smoothbores' operating-costs were far lower. Without rifling, theoretical-projectiles could be anything fitting the bore—no precision-shells needed. Simplest: solid iron-balls. Even in 19th-century, such balls remained acceptable for land and sea-killing-power. Actually, solid-shot remained most-fired ammunition until smoothbores exited warfare—more reliable than questionable HE-shells.

"Also, we can develop special spherical-shells—like HE and incendiaries."

"Another advantage you might not realize." Wang Luobin said. "Wen-Director's generation-gap theory."

"Generation-gap theory?"

"In this timespace, at least in our lifetimes, we're outsiders. For conquest and rule, we need local-assistance. So eventually we'll build native-armies."

Once native-armies existed, their numbers would inevitably become transmigrator-state's main-armed-forces.

No matter how much brainwashing, political-work, or control—armies as violence-machines, once realizing their power, would become greedy. They'd seek more power and benefits. Travelers' own-strength was limited. Only solution: maintaining tech-gaps.

If native-troops got 20mm flintlocks—transmigrators needed bolt-action-rifles to counter. This ensured tiny-minorities could suppress large-groups. Similarly, if transmigrators could make Type-92 infantry-guns—native-armies' best-cannons shouldn't exceed 37mm carriage-recoil-guns.

Wen Desi hadn't yet perfected this theory—nightly contemplating future military-institutions and political-organizations. "Travelers' eternal-dynasty" was his goal.

After several days' preparation, cannon-casting began. As technical-reserve and practice, Artillery-Group would first cast traditional smoothbores. Generally, smoothbores preferred copper—~1000-round lifespan—versus cast-iron's ~600 rounds. But copper was far costlier—precious industrial-material for transmigrators. *Deng Yingzhou*'s Guangdong pig-iron was excellent-quality, low-sulfur—very suitable for cannon-casting.

Historically, Ming-era Fujian-Guangdong pig-iron was renowned for quality. Regional ironworks used charcoal-fuel—sulfur-content far lower than northern-coal-smelted pig-iron. Sulfur was the primary-factor making pig-iron brittle and degraded. Ming-people didn't understand the reason—but "southern-cast cannons are sturdier than northern" became consensus. Late-Ming dynasty's large-scale cannon-casting all occurred in Guangdong. In 1619 (Wanli 47th-year), Xu Guangqi, commanded to train troops defending the capital, suggested recruiting Fujian-Guangdong craftsmen to cast cannons in Beijing. In Chongzhen 3rd-year, he volunteered to go to Guangzhou for cannon-casting because: "Craftsmen are numerous, iron-materials especially-fine, prices can be saved by one-third..." In early-Chongzhen, Governor-General Wang Zunde cast 200 cannons in one batch.

Wang Luobin suggested recruiting Guangzhou cannon-smiths to demonstrate traditional Chinese cannon-casting—giving intuitive-concepts before improvements. Lin Shenhe said unnecessary: 1628's Chinese cannon-smiths weren't better—even their European-teachers' casting-technology wasn't much higher. Travelers needn't learn from them.

Matteo Ricci wrote about contemporary Chinese-cannon problems: insufficient-powder, short-range, no sights, no aiming-capability. Cannon-bores wide-at-mouth, narrow-inside—couldn't effectively-concentrate propellant-gases. Bore-interiors not properly-circular; bores not polished. Shell-sizes and even shapes were arbitrary. Shell-bore-gaps excessive. Cannons lacked trunnions—and were top-heavy. Dense-packed powder caused self-explosion upon firing.

Contemporary imported "Red-Barbarian Cannons" were fundamentally-identical to Ming's traditional cannons—both smoothbore muzzle-loaders using black-powder and solid-shot. But benefiting from scientific-understanding, European-cannons had design-advantages: thicker barrel-walls, higher caliber-length, barrel tapering rear-to-front. Thus superior range, killing-power, safety. Barrels commonly had sights and rear-apertures; barrels had trunnions—convenient for mounting on carriages, adjusting elevation, moving.

Travelers' planned smoothbores could also be considered "Red-Barbarian Cannons"—but with slightly-advanced blueprints. Copying early-19th-century French 6-pounder cannons. Effective-range 500m, maximum 1500m, barrel-weight ~250kg.

Lin Shenhe and Wang Luobin decided to first use 17th–18th-century Western cannon-casting methods—also requiring clay-molds.

They requested Lumber-Factory to machine specialized wooden-patterns: conical-wood for support-bodies, turned cannon-breech patterns. After completion, first step was positive-mold blanks. Starting with conical-wood supports, hemp-rope was densely-wound into cannon-shape. At this stage, positive-mold-blanks were ~25cm oversized versus final-dimensions. Then clay-water mixture was evenly-layered onto blanks—each layer completely-dried before adding next.

During application, overall dimensions were slightly-larger than actual-cannon—accounting for casting-shrinkage. After final-layer dried and shape-corrected, positive-mold-blank was wax-coated—lacking paraffin, beeswax substituted. Wax surface would be smooth—not sticking to negative-mold during next-step. Breech was turned-wood pattern, screw-fixed to positive-mold-blank.

After positive-mold completion, negative-mold was made. Negative-mold used clay, pottery-clay, fine-sand, and water mixed into semi-liquid—layered onto positive-mold. Again, each layer fully-dried before next. After complete-drying, iron-bar reinforcement-ribs were added externally.

After molds completely-dried, positive-mold was removed. Method: cut negative-mold open at ends, extract positive-mold's conical-wood core, then pull out wound-hemp-rope. The wax-layer between molds allowed easy-separation—if difficult, heating melted wax, creating gaps. Breech-mold was made separately.

Third mold-component was the core—clay-encased iron-rod, generally cylindrical. Powder-chamber might have special-shape. Core was inserted into main-mold; iron core-supports at mold-rear and pottery-ring at cannon-mouth fixed core in position.

Separately-made breech-negative-mold was reassembled with barrel-negative-mold. Three molds firmly-assembled, then fired to fully-harden. Finally, molds were buried cannon-mouth-up in compacted-earth pit beside cupola. Jiang Ye designed/installed a wooden-hoist to lift entire-molds—because during cupola-construction, cannon-casting wasn't considered, and steelmaking-workshop floor was hardened. They built another cupola in casting-workshop—but since only-melting, not iron-smelting, no regenerator was used. Runner-system was one-to-four. Ji Wusheng personally-guided; Zhan Wuya had casting-experience—first casting succeeded.

After pouring, 24-hour insulation before excavating from pit. After further-cooling, external reinforcement-ribs were removed, molds broken, Artillery-Group used hammers and chisels clearing residual slag from barrel.

Finally, cast-iron 6-pounder cannon was cast. Still needing further-processing: bore-polishing. Mechanical-Group made a simple boring-mill—power wasn't electric or diesel, but a donkey. This donkey drove a capstan rotating a boring-bar with high-carbon-steel boring-head.

Bore-polishing greatly-improved bore-surface smoothness—but measurements showed polishing couldn't truly-cut cylinders or correct core-deviation from casting. Throughout the process, hard-residues severely-damaged boring-bars. In other words: this process was too-costly.

"No wonder by 1713, drilling-method replaced it." Lin Shenhe was somewhat-dejected. Drilling-method: first casting solid iron-rods, then drilling bores. First used by Dutch—but not widespread until late-18th-century. British naval-arsenals still used above casting-method for naval-guns until 1770.
