# Chapter 1440 - Entry Point

Cheng Yongxin recalled the meeting from a few days ago with some delight:

As a staff member of the Great Library, the Propaganda Department, the printing plant, and the Public Intelligence Center were places she often visited.

In the organizational structure of the Council of Elders, the Propaganda Department was roughly the place that managed both cultural undertakings and propaganda. Consequently, the organization was complex and the personnel numerous. The area it occupied was also that of a top-tier major ministry.

Three two-story red brick buildings stood in the Propaganda Department compound, along with auxiliary courtyards. Naturalized citizen staff members came and went in a continuous stream. Besides the Propaganda Department's offices, there were also many branches and subordinate organizations here, such as the newspaper office, magazine office, troupe, and mass culture society.

However, the core part here was still the "two journals and one newspaper."

The "one newspaper" among them, as the newspaper conveying the policies and discourse of the Council of Elders to the broad masses of naturalized citizens and indigenous people, was self-evidently important and authoritative.

As the number one Elder on the propaganda front, Comrade Dingding's power and status naturally roses with the tide. Although he rarely gave speeches in public, the commentary articles signed "Special Commentator" and "Voice of the Origin" in the *Lingao Times* were mostly written or drafted by him. He was vaguely known as "The Goebbels of Lingao" and "The Suslov of Bairen." He couldn't help but feel a little elated himself, working with increasing vigor in the propaganda post. Panpan had drunk too much at a Feiyun Club cocktail party once and had cried while saying Dingding had "betrayed his ideals." This was one of the reasons Cheng Yongxin had always been "watching gently" over this couple.

Since she often came to the Propaganda Department for business, the naturalized citizens here almost all knew her. Aside from showing her pass once to the sentry at the compound gate, Cheng Yongxin had unimpeded access all the way to Dingding's office.

However, Dingding was not in the office. The secretary said Chief Ding had gone to the *Times* editorial office, seemingly for something urgent.

"Would you like to wait here for a while?" Dingding's secretary asked with a beaming smile.

"No, I'll go directly to the editorial office to find him; I was going there anyway." Cheng Yongxin seemed to sniff something—Panpan was the Executive Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the *Lingao Times*.

The editorial office was not far from Dingding's office. Before she reached the door, she heard Dingding's voice.

"Panpan, don't be like this; you can't just drop all the work! This newspaper has to be published every day!"

"Work? Fine, I demand that you approve that manuscript immediately! And stop interfering with my right to use manuscripts." Panpan's voice was very sharp; her Mandarin was extremely fluent and accurate in pronunciation. Without looking at her face, no one would know she was an American girl.

"Panpan! You know very well that this report cannot be published!" Dingding's voice couldn't help but rise. Judging from the level of impatience in his tone, this matter was probably not small.

"Do you have a shred of humanity left!" Panpan slammed the table and stood up, with such force that it could be heard in the hallway. Her sharp, high-pitched female voice pierced through the doors and windows. "This is a human life! A human life! Since the matter is still under investigation, what are you afraid of? What is the Council of Elders afraid of? A guilty conscience?!"

Cheng Yongxin's nerves became excited. She slowed her steps and walked softly into the main door of the editorial office.

Dingding looked gloomy and was panting, pacing back and forth in the middle of the room. Panpan sat with her head lowered, saying nothing. The few naturalized editors who had come to ask for instructions didn't know where to put their hands and feet; leaving wasn't right, staying wasn't right either. They stood awkwardly to the side.

"Panpan, we must pay attention to the influence of public opinion. Once this matter is reported, what will you have the naturalized citizens and natives think?"

"Why should I care what they think? Haven't you always wished for them not to think!"

As soon as these words came out, both their expressions changed instantly.

Dingding's face turned ashen. After panting a few times, he turned to the naturalized citizens in the room and roared: "What are you staring for? Everyone get out!"

Panpan's pretty face was pale, biting her lip without saying a word.

The atmosphere in the office became cold. Several minutes later, Panpan spoke, her voice low: "Right, to the Council of Elders, a human life is nothing; everything is for the great cause of the Council of Elders. But I don't want to do this anymore; I quit as editor-in-chief." Her voice became extremely cold.

"Sorry, did I disturb you?"

Panpan and Dingding suddenly snapped back to reality, looking simultaneously at the woman leaning against the door frame with her arms crossed.

"No, you didn't disturb us. You are..."

From the other's posture and demeanor, one could tell she was also an Elder, but Panpan had absolutely no impression of her.

"I am Cheng Yongxin from the Great Library. We have an appointment at nine o'clock—I think I'm not late."

Panpan remembered: her secretary had indeed mentioned it when reporting the schedule in the morning.

"Sorry, I have something going on here..." she said somewhat wearily, seemingly apologetic for the quarrel between her and Dingding just now. "Please speak, what specific matter is it?"

But Dingding's expression showed a trace of surprise.

"Cheng Yongxin?"

Although less than 72 hours had passed, she had already painted a layer of dramatic color over her memory. Dingding's expression should indeed be described as somewhat surprised, but her memory defined this surprise as "shock." And she took it for granted that her appearance at the time—"fitted short shirt plus tight jeans, shoulder-length hair falling smoothly in an arc, collarbone clearly outlined by a simple silver chain"—had left an extremely shocking impression on Comrade Dingding. Mind you, she had even changed her hairstyle today.

Just as she had treated her non-existent wedding as real: actually, it was just splashing a plastic cup of Coca-Cola on her ex-boyfriend who was hitting on a junior female student at a small restaurant table near the university—her ex-boyfriend had never met a third-tier actress, nor had he met many Beijing drifter girls who were doing somewhat decently in the circle.

"You look much prettier without glasses." Dingding complimented.

"Actually, your reaction just now was the best compliment."

Panpan gave him a sidelong glance, rather dissatisfied with her boyfriend's flirtatious reaction after being stunned by beauty. However, this also loosened the originally cold and awkward atmosphere in the room considerably. Dingding hurriedly made an excuse that he still had some things to do and went back to his office first.

Panpan watched her boyfriend leave with a complex expression, then sat back in her chair. Although she had announced "I quit," she still had basic professional ethics. No matter what complaints she had about this job, leaving without permission before someone took over was extremely irresponsible behavior.

"I'm sorry, I'm afraid you saw it too." Panpan managed to squeeze out a smile. "We were arguing."

"It doesn't matter. Arguments are good for enhancing feelings." Cheng Yongxin smiled. "It's better than keeping everything in your heart. Don't you think?"

"True. I envy you being single."

Cheng Yongxin laughed: "Don't say that; I wish someone would take a fancy to me. Living alone is very empty."

When a person is physically and mentally exhausted, it is easy to open one's heart to someone who shows kindness. The meeting that day went very well; the two chatted very congenially, wishing they had met sooner. because it was working hours, Panpan couldn't chat for long, so Cheng Yongxin took the opportunity to propose a date at the café.

"I will definitely go." Panpan agreed very readily.

In her plan, Panpan had always been her number one entry point, and the person she privately assessed as the easiest to make a breakthrough with. But she hadn't found a suitable opportunity until now; this time was truly a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Cheng Yongxin was very certain that Panpan would swallow her bait today. As long as she took the bait, catching the big fish Dingding would be as easy as turning over a hand.

She took a mirror out of her bag and carefully looked at her image. She had specially groomed herself meticulously for today's meeting.

The door was knocked gently three times, and was pushed open after a moment.

"Chief, Chief Panpan is here." The waitress announced.

Panpan could be seen to have groomed herself today as well—she hadn't had such a social activity for a long time. Everyone loves beauty.

"You are really beautiful." Seeing that she had arrived, Panpan greeted her warmly. "I'm not late, am I?"

"Safe on base." Cheng Yongxin cracked a joke. "I reserved the vanilla roasted lamb chops; you won't dislike it, right?"

"I like it very much." Panpan hung her bag on the wall and took a seat opposite her. "Give me a glass of ice water." She instructed the waitress while saying, "You know, the General Affairs Office supplies too little red meat. For most of the week, we eat fish and chicken. God!" She made a praying gesture. "Unfortunately, neither of us can cook, so we can only eat in the cafeteria."

The waitress soon served borscht and vegetable salad, and the two began to eat.

The lamb was sent from the General Affairs Office's special supply pasture in Changhua. The lambs were raised with care, eating pasture grass rich in minerals by the seaside, including many herbs, so they were rich in fat and the meat was tender.

After the main course, the waitress served the signature dessert here: fruit yogurt ice cream and hot coffee. Cheng Yongxin didn't drink coffee, so she asked for a pot of black tea to be brewed.

"What perfume are you using today?" Cheng Yongxin asked. "A very nice scent type."

"I asked a female Elder from the Chemical Industry Ministry to help blend it." Panpan said. "She is very good at this."

"It must be Elder Ge. Rarely see her."

"Yes, compared to you, I have even fewer chances to see her." Panpan looked Cheng Yongxin up and down. "You look very charming today."

Cheng Yongxin had dressed up carefully today. The white shirt, the long light-colored floral skirt made of tulle, and the strappy sandals were all stock from another time-space. Clothing produced by modern industry like this could not be replicated in this time-space, and in the hearts of the Elders, they were rare treasures. Worn on her, the attraction radiated was enough to shatter a bunch of life secretaries who only had looks into pieces.
