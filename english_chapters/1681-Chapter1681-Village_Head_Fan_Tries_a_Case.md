# Chapter 1681 - Village Head Fan Tries a Case

Now, the Senate said "no foot-binding," so he became the most resolute anti-foot-binding activist. Old Yan the Fifth was a "literary scholar" and had some "lotus obsession" hobbies, outwardly agreeing but inwardly opposing the foot-binding policy. He was originally a "foot-binding difficulty household" in the village; his wife's problem hadn't been solved yet, and now he caused trouble with his daughter. Upon hearing this, Liu Yuanhu jumped up in execute, led a few militiamen, and dragged Old Yan the Fifth out.

Yun Suji saw clearly from behind the window. Seeing that half-old man trembling with fear, he felt somewhat sympathetic. He originally wanted to come out to smooth things over, but thinking about the detestable nature of foot-binding, he felt Old Yan the Fifth brought it upon himself. Standing out himself would instead hinder the village's work. It was better to first see how the village cadres handled it.

Before Village Head Fan could speak, dozens of villagers watching the excitement had already gathered from all directions. Yun Suji saw that they were dressed fairly neatly and their spirits were passable.

Village Head Fan coughed and said, "The spirit of the Senate was conveyed at the last general meeting. Everyone knows it. Everyone also expressed their determination: to be the first foot-binding-free village in Qiongshan. Whoever's daughter or wife doesn't unbind their feet, we will punish their man."

A group of villagers stood respectfully. Hearing Village Head Fan finish speaking, they all echoed: "That's right," "Okay"...

Village Head Fan stuck out his belly triumphantly and said, "Old Yan the Fifth's wife still secretly binds her feet to this day. The village hasn't pursued this matter yet, and now he's binding his daughter's feet again. It won't do not to punish him—the state has state laws, and the family has family rules. The Senate is the Emperor. If you dare not listen to what the Emperor says, isn't that the crime of deceiving the sovereign? You'll be beheaded."

Old Yan the Fifth and his wife felt their legs go soft and were already kneeling on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly and begging for mercy, saying "We dare not bind feet again."

Yun Suji was secretly amused, thinking this village head really knew how to bully others by flaunting powerful connections. Now he became even more interested to see how the village head would judge.

He only heard Village Head Fan wave his hand: "Since it's like this, we'll handle it according to the old rules. Auntie San, bind him up!"

A middle-aged woman squeezed out of the crowd. Her expression was reluctant, obviously extremely unwilling. She edged up to Old Yan the Fifth and said with an apologetic smile, "Old Fifth, this is official business, please bear with it..."

Liu Yuanhu said impatiently, "Hurry up, hurry up!" As he spoke, he pressed him down onto a long bench.

Old Yan the Fifth probably didn't expect this. His face turned gray, then white, then red, truly looking worse than holding back a bowel movement during a meeting. Seeing Auntie San bending down to take off his shoes, he jumped up as if cramping, frantically trying to grab his own shoes. Liu Yuanhu shouted, "Hold him!" Several militiamen took action together, grabbing Old Yan the Fifth and pinning him down firmly, taking off both his shoes.

Yun Suji was just wondering when he saw Auntie San, with agile hands and feet, half-kneeling on the ground, holding one of Old Yan the Fifth's muddy black feet. She first placed the right foot on her own knee, applied some alum liquid in the toe crevices, squeezed the five toes tightly together, and then bent the instep forcefully like a curved bow. Then she used cloth strips to bind it; after winding only two layers, she took a needle and thread to sew the opening tightly: binding ruthlessly on one hand and sewing densely on the other. Old Yan the Fifth was held tightly by four militiamen beside him, and his foot was held by two other militiamen, unable to move at all. By the time it was finished, he only felt his foot burning like charcoal fire, waves of pain. In pain and shame, he wailed and cried.

Yun Suji watched with palpitation, really not expecting this village head to have such a move.

"Put these lotus shoes on him too, very beautiful," Village Head Fan said.

Auntie San bowed her waist: "Old Fifth, sorry, this is official business." She picked up the pair of small shoes made by Old Yan the Fifth's wife and tried to put them on his feet—how could they possibly fit? Liu Yuanhu took out a knife, cut open the heel of the shoe, and just like that, put it onto Old Yan the Fifth's "Golden Lotus."

Village Head Fan said, "Old Yan the Fifth is at fault in this matter, and his wife is also at fault. Yuanhu, hit her with forty strokes of the carrying pole! Don't take off her pants, she's a woman, leave some dignity."

Liu Yuanhu agreed, led people to drag Old Yan the Fifth's wife to the ground, and beat her with the carrying pole one by one. Old Yan the Fifth's wife wailed for mercy, crying to heaven and earth saying she "dared not" do it anymore.

After forty strokes, Liu Yuanhu told Auntie San to take off Old Yan the Fifth's wife's shoes. Sure enough, inside the big shoes, the feet were still bound, stuffed with cotton. Immediately, the foot-binding strips were removed.

"Yuanhu, take a foot cangue and lock Old Yan the Fifth to the stone mill for three days. Let everyone in the village take a look at his small feet. You tell people to bind their feet, you taste the flavor yourself too. Don't just care about your own pleasure after blowing out the lamp and ignore the life and death of your daughter and wife. Everyone say, is that right?"

Everyone said it was right.

Village Head Fan then shouted to Old Yan the Fifth's wife, "Today I originally intended to lock both of your 'Golden Lotuses' on the stone mill to show off, but your family still has daughters and boys waiting to eat, so I'll spare you this time. No more foot-binding! Take your daughter and go back quickly."

Old Yan the Fifth's wife couldn't care less about her burning buttocks. She kowtowed and crawled up. Her daughter quickly came over to support her, and the mother and daughter limped back.

Yun Suji watched this scene of "trying a case" with mixed feelings. Honestly, his impression of Village Head Fan and Liu Yuanhu wasn't very good, but to summarize it as "simple and crude" didn't seem that simple either. Take this foot-binding matter today for example, it had quite a bit of peasant-style wisdom. The title of this advanced village indeed had some real substance.

While he was pondering, Village Head Fan walked in and bowed: "I made you laugh, I made you laugh. If we don't do this, it's hard to handle."

Yun Suji said, "It doesn't matter." Only then did he give him the letter of introduction. Village Head Fan took it and saw that it read:

"Hereby is the Tiandihui Technical Instructor, Senator Yun Suji, going to Qiongshan to inspect and supervise agricultural grassroots work. Please provide assistance..."

After the village head read the letter, his legs went soft: "Good heavens, it's actually a Chief!"

He ushered Yun Suji into the inner room, said a few polite words, and wanted to invite Yun Suji to his home for tea. He accompanied him with a smile: "Chief, this lowly one is from Laizhou. It was Chief Lu who saved this lowly one's life and promoted this lowly one to this position. Giving this lowly one land to farm, the Chief's kindness is greater than the sky. You haven't had lunch yet, right? I'll tell someone to prepare it right away!"

Yun Suji said, "Don't stand on ceremony. Don't rush to eat first. Tell me about the situation in the village."

The village head wanted to use conventional politeness, but Yun Suji said, "This is the system, it cannot be broken casually!"

Seeing his rustic appearance but unyielding speech, the village cadre couldn't think of how to deal with him for a moment, so he said: "Alright, Chief, please rest a bit, I'll go get the village archives for you!"

After speaking, he went out of the public office to find the village accountant. The village accountant was a refugee from Zhejiang, originally a shop assistant. He was good at abacus calculation and was a person who was smooth and slick, the village head's "strategist." The village head listened to his advice.

He first showed the introduction letter to the village accountant, and then described how this person was dressed in rustic clothes.

The village accountant said, "I heard Chief Liu say a few days ago that there was such a person. You can't underestimate this person! I heard Chief Liu say that there are things Chief Liu has to discuss with him to handle."

The village head said, "Yes, yes, yes! Now that you mention it, I remember. That time we went to Lingao County for a Tiandihui meeting to discuss scientific farming, the Chief held a meeting first, and it seems he was there, wearing blue clothes, his eyebrows and eyes were just like that."

The village accountant said, "I think we should entertain him well and not offend him!"

The village head walked out the door and returned to ask, "I invited him to eat at my house, but he refused. He asked to see the archives. What should I do?"

The village accountant became impatient and said, "If the Chief wants to see the archives, just show them to him. Our ledgers are complete."

"But how can we show them to the Chief now! Dozens of types of forms, big and small, more than half haven't been filled out."

"Now is not the time for inspection. Chief Yun is a cadre from the central government, what does he know... You take out the ones that are done for him to see, speak a little more beautifully, and muddle through," the accountant said. "Did anyone come from the county?"

"Four guards came, resting under the banyan tree outside the village office."

"That doesn't matter. Well, you go get the archives, I'll go beat the gong and call the group heads of each Jia to see the Chief. By the way, hurry up and tell Liu Yuanhu to have the militiamen watch those old fellows closely, don't let them come out and cry out grievances."

Yun Suji waited for a while before the village head returned with a face full of smiles, opened the file cabinet in the wing room, and took out the ledgers. He moved them onto the table stack by stack.

" This is not complete yet. Chief, which types do you want to see?" The village head accompanied with a smile, "I'll bring them all to you."

"No need." Yun Suji clicked his tongue secretly. Just these ledgers piled up on the table, and it wasn't even complete! Leaving aside this bureaucratic style, just based on the actual level of the naturalized cadres, one should thank the effective cadre education that they didn't use them as toilet paper.

Yun Suji asked, "How many households are there in your village? Where are they from? What is the total population? How many laborers?"

Seeing that Chief Yun indeed only casually flipped through various booklets, the village head felt slightly relieved. Hearing him ask questions, he quickly stood up.

Yun Suji said, "Sit down and talk, sit down and talk."

The village head said, "There are eighty-four households here. The whole village has four hundred and thirty-one people. Most are from Shandong. There are also some from Shanxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. One hundred and ninety-two laborers."

Yun Suji nodded: "There are really many laborers in your village."

The village head said: "Chief, most people here are refugees, many young and strong, few old and young."

Then he asked some other questions. Fortunately, the Chief asked about paddy fields, dry fields, yield per mu, water conservancy, soil moisture conservation, and pest control. He could answer all of them, and he was logical, with data coming out of his mouth. It could be seen that Chief Yun was very satisfied.

Suddenly there was the sound of gongs and drums outside. Chief Yun was startled: "What is that for?"

The village head explained that this was to notify each Jia to come for a meeting and meet the Chief.

Chief Yun laughed: "Don't be so formal. I'll eat something first to fill my stomach."

The village head took the opportunity to ask: "What would the Chief like for a simple meal? There are chickens, ducks, fish, shrimp, and vegetables."
