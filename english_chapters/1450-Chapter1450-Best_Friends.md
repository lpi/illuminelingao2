# Chapter 1450 - Best Friends

"Fangcaodi?" Su Wan was a little surprised. To solve the male Elders' lower body problems, the Council of Elders had paid a huge cost in manpower and material resources. Transferring a life secretary trained at such a high cost directly to Fangcaodi? Wasn't this a huge loss! Once at Fangcaodi, she would be a "female student" under the Ministry of Education, not a "female slave" under the control of the General Affairs Office. Although she would still be a "slave" belonging to the Council of Elders, in terms of personal autonomy, at least on paper, she would have more than a "death contract" life secretary.

"Exactly, I was also very surprised." Mu Min said, "Spending such a huge price to bring these life secretaries here, and actually letting her leave? Would those men agree?"

"Do you know how many students we currently have in 'pending assignment' status?" Dong Weiwei smiled bitterly.

"Don't know."

"About three hundred. If according to that rating document issued by the General Affairs Office, two-thirds of the students in the academy now are B-grade or above. Almost no D and E."

"So many!"

"High quality and sufficient quantity—" Dong Weiwei suddenly realized that saying this about female students had the suspicion of "objectifying" and self-deprecating women, paused for a moment, then said, "Students haven't been distributed for quite a long period."

Starting from 1630 when the first batch of life secretary students entered the school, small batches of students entered the school irregularly every year, ranging from a dozen to twenty or thirty per batch. Although there were fewer life secretaries above B-grade, under the hungry and thirsty state, Elders were not picky, so there was basically no backlog. A few D and E-grade students who really couldn't be distributed were transferred to the Human Resources Department for redistribution except for those staying at the school.

After the Engine Operation began, the number of students increased sharply. "Good seedlings" were sent from quarantine camps in Shandong, Jeju, Taiwan, and Zhejiang. Each batch ranged from twenty or thirty to nearly a hundred. Then came female servant students from Europe, Korea, and Vietnam. For this reason, the scale of the school was expanded—fortunately, when the General Affairs Office planned the Elders' human racial museum, they had fully estimated the ambition and made backups when enclosing the land. As for the shortage of teachers caused by the expansion of scale, it was filled by students from previous phases who failed to be distributed and had outstanding academic achievements in various specialties.

The result of the large arrival was a large backlog. Elders' interest in maids had decreased significantly, and limited residential area and busy work further suppressed the demand for second life secretaries. After all, Elders' time, energy, and physical strength were limited. After the initial "solving existence" problem, the result was that most Elders did not establish a harem as they imagined.

In recent months, except for a very few S-grade maids and European female slaves who were still in short supply due to scarcity of arrivals, the school had a situation where students finished their studies but no one cared to ask. Even A-grade ones couldn't be distributed.

To solve this problem, the General Affairs Office and the Ministry of Education stipulated: after students complete six months of study, add a six-month "candidate" period. During this period, they continue to receive various vocational trainings according to their abilities. Ready to be selected by Elders at any time.

If after six months no one cares to ask, then hand them over to the Human Resources Department for distribution according to the content of vocational training. Those with good grades stay to teach or transfer to various vocational training classes in Fangcaodi, and the rest are handed over to the Human Resources Department for distribution, leaving the identity of maid students.

"In this case, it's better not to be picked by this bunch of people. At least the future isn't bad: now the administrative branch is short of people terrible, doing anything outside is better than being a professional mistress."

"The Executive Committee finally did something human for once." Being the boss alone for a long time made Dong Weiwei outspoken, making Mu Min slightly nervous. Fortunately, she didn't elaborate on this issue, "But Lin Xiaoya's case is a bit special."

"How special?"

"According to the document, maid students transferring to Fangcaodi all enter vocational training classes. Unless the basic subject grades are particularly good can they enter the normal class. But Lin Xiaoya entered the first year of higher primary school at Fangcaodi."

Maid School students roughly had to reach primary school equivalent academic ability before graduation. In terms of this level, entering higher primary school was no problem, but there was no entry for higher primary school in the placement document.

"How is this possible? Since there is no such item in the placement document, who solves her tuition? Besides, the Higher Primary Department of Fangcaodi wouldn't accept her either."

"With an Elder's recommendation, it's possible. And he also agreed to fully sponsor her tuition and living expenses."

"So generous, who recommended her?"

"Yang Xinwu—an Elder teacher at Fangcaodi."

"So it was him."

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing." Mu Min covered it up. The situation that Yang Xinwu was the main suspect hadn't reached the point where it could be talked about everywhere, "But unrelated Elders aren't allowed inside the school. How could he know Lin Xiaoya?"

"Actually it's not strange," Dong Weiwei said, "His maid Yang Jihong was Lin Xiaoya's roommate. The two had a very good relationship, they were best friends. I guess it was probably Yang Jihong's effort—their relationship was really good."

Mu Min nodded, the interpersonal relationship surrounding the victim was completely connected. She opened Lin Xiaoya's file. On the black and white photo taken by glass plate wet process photography, Lin Xiaoya looked plain, rated C—according to Dong Weiwei, now even A-grade in the Maid School couldn't be distributed, C-grade was overflowing.

Her file was very brief, identical to most maid students. On the thin few pages were her native place, age, naturalization time, transcript, physical examination form... Finally, a document for transfer of student status. The Maid School's stamp was already stamped, but the stamp place for the receiving party was still blank—forever blank.

"If Elders are allowed to recommend and sponsor like this, wouldn't they be able to bypass the procedures prescribed by the General Affairs Office and choose life secretaries at will?"

"Lin Xiaoya's candidate period was full. Theoretically, she was no longer a maid student." Dong Weiwei said, "Besides, she did not belong to 'best-selling goods'—sorry I have to describe it like this."

"I see." Mu Min asked again, "Can I see Yang Jihong's file?"

"No problem, the original copy of Yang Jihong's file is in the General Affairs Office, but we have a copy here." Dong Weiwei stood up, rummaged by the filing cabinet for a while, and pulled out a document.

Yang Jihong's file also had no highlights. Her rating was only D. Age was 2 years older than Lin Xiaoya. She noticed that Yang Jihong's enrollment time was earlier than Lin Xiaoya.

"Correct, she was from the second phase. Although a bit late, she was distributed. Lin Xiaoya was several phases later, and wasn't distributed even after the candidate period passed. Speaking of looks and grades, actually Lin Xiaoya was much better than Yang Jihong. Sigh, looks like beauties suffer bad fates."

Mu Min was not interested in Dong Weiwei's literary sighs. She realized that the relationship between Yang Jihong and Lin Xiaoya must be the breakthrough point to solve the case. As for what role Yang Xinwu played between these two women, it was hard to say.

Saying he coveted Lin Xiaoya's beauty didn't seem to make sense. Since even A-grade maids could be chosen at will, Elder Yang didn't need to stare at a C-grade maid. Unless this girl could satisfy some special need of his, making him have to have her—even so, he could follow the normal process and buy Lin Xiaoya back directly, no need to go through this troublesome path of recommendation and sponsored enrollment.

Logically speaking, Yang Xinwu's recommendation showed that he himself didn't have much interest in Lin Xiaoya, very likely just out of Yang Jihong's request. The homicide was very likely a matter between Yang Jihong and Lin Xiaoya, with not much connection to Yang Xinwu.

The only thing that didn't make sense was why Yang Xinwu would issue a pass to call Lin Xiaoya into the Elder residential area. If this was also Yang Jihong's request, then what was Yang Jihong's purpose?

Common sense dictates that even for best friends, it is unlikely for Yang Jihong to recommend a competitor of her own to her master.

"Was their relationship really very good?"

"Should be." Dong Weiwei said, "If you are worried, I can find a few students to ask."

"Thank you so much."

Dong Weiwei rang the bell and instructed the female secretary with a few words. Then asked: "Anything else I can help with, don't be polite! I also want to catch this murderer sooner."

"Can the students here go out normally? Is there a curfew time?"

"Students normally cannot go out, only when participating in social activities and visiting for study can they go out collectively. However, for students like Lin Xiaoya who have passed the candidate period and are about to transfer or enter the distribution process, they can go out. Getting three chances to ask for leave to go out per month, four hours each time. The curfew is until nine in the evening."

"What about staying out overnight or returning late?"

"Staying out overnight gets one hundred strokes of the rattan cane, three days of confinement in the dark room. If entering the normal class, downgrade to the Human Resources Department for direct distribution; late return and overstaying leave get ten to sixty strokes according to the length of late return, one day of confinement in the dark room. During confinement, only relief rations and clean water are given."

"Really strict."

"Nothing can be accomplished without norms or standards. I have no opinion on corporal punishment. Only regarding the purpose of corporal punishment, I have reservations."

Mu Min remembered that Dong Weiwei was a Ming dynasty fan girl, knowing she wasn't actually too resistant to these things—no wonder the Executive Committee chose her to be the principal.

"Dong Weiwei found me a few students who were relatively familiar with both Lin Xiaoya and Yang Jihong. But they didn't provide anything particularly useful. Yang Jihong was reticent, while Lin Xiaoya was lively and active—considering their backgrounds: the former was a farm girl, the latter was from an urban poor family, such personalities are not surprising. It is said that Lin Xiaoya was a very thoughtful and smart girl, usually with many clever ideas."

Su Wan said: "Actually, such girls suit those men's appetite better."

"Yes, it's a pity Lin Xiaoya can no longer prove her ability." Mu Min said, with deep regret in her words.
