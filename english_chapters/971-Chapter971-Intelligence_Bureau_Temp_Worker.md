# Chapter 971 - The Intelligence Bureau's Temp Worker

Huang Ande found his clothes very uncomfortable. The topknot rewound on his head felt heavy and unpleasant. All that hair, under the blazing sun, made sweat beads drip continuously down from his hairline.

So much better to have the buzz cut from the army. Huang Ande couldn't help but miss his days as a soldier in the Fubo Army. In summer, not only was the hair cut nice and short, but the clothes were made of cotton-linen blend—breathable, absorbent, and quick-drying. So much more comfortable than this thick, coarse cloth jacket.

Both Huang Ande and Huang Xiong came from the Shandong garrison troops, and the two were distantly related—cousins beyond the fifth degree of kinship. However, Huang Xiong had later transferred to Qizhen and made it as a minor officer, while Huang Ande had remained a drifter in the Shandong garrison until the day he fled after being implicated in a plot to steal from the official granary.

Because the theft was disgraceful, Huang Ande had never mentioned it. The truth only came out during the Political Security Bureau's deep investigation when Huang Ande was up for promotion to officer. The investigation also revealed he had originally served in Dengzhou.

Because of this background, Huang Ande had not only been transferred to the Northern Expedition Support Team but, like Huang Xiong, was among the first to join the advance party. His current identity was as one of Lu Wenyuan's personal attendants.

After Zhao and Lu had opened up channels with Sun Yuanhua, they also actively participated in Shandong church activities through the Jesuits, quickly becoming familiar with the local church. They gained considerable freedom of action and support, and immediately got to work.

Because Huang Ande was a local, he had received special training from Navy Intelligence Officer Xu Ke of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau before departure. As a temp worker for the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, he was assigned to operate in Dengzhou city and gather information on local conditions—especially the garrison situation. This was the intelligence that Operation Engine Command most wanted.

In the instructions Xu Ke gave him, he specifically hoped Huang Ande could obtain information on troop deployments in Penglai Water City and the specific locations of yamen, military camps, and artillery batteries inside the water city. Though the Grand Library had provided Xu Ke with as much material as possible, what the Ming-era water city actually looked like inside still required firsthand information.

At the moment, he was wandering outside Penglai Water City. This water city was located on the east side of Danya Mountain, northwest of Dengzhou city. During the Song, a Knife-Fish Patrol Station was established here, with knife-fish war boats stationed to defend against the Khitan—it was called Knife-Fish Fort. In the ninth year of Hongwu in the Ming, the water city was first built; a water gate was constructed to the north, and Zhenyang Gate was established to the south, with an earthen wall encircling it. Seawater was channeled into the city, and it was renamed Beiwō City. In the twenty-fourth year of Wanli (1596), the earthen walls were faced with brick and stone. During the Tianqi reign, Dengzhou-Laizhou Governor Yuan Keli had trained the navy here, commanding troops from both Dengzhou and Dongjiang garrisons. He had over fifty thousand army and navy troops, equipped with advanced artillery and numerous warships. In a memorial, Yuan Keli described it thus: "Warships connected prow to stern; the barbarian chieftain's courage froze." The Dongjiang garrison's ability to persist for so long on the Later Jin's flank was inseparable from the powerful logistical support provided by Penglai Water City.

Due to the Liaodong wars, successive Dengzhou-Laizhou Governors had carefully developed this place. Combined with the large quantities of supplies destined for Liaodong that were transshipped here, and the official and trade exchanges between Korea and the Great Ming all passing through, merchants gathered here, creating a prosperous scene. A Korean visitor crossing the sea at that time recorded this place as having "beacon towers set on every peak with a lookout view; military farming camps visible everywhere; merchant ships and warships anchored near shore beyond counting"—a prosperous and orderly scene.

Within Penglai Water City, the navy alone stationed over eight thousand men. Adding in the civilian laborers and craftsmen repairing the water city, shipwrights building and maintaining vessels, blacksmiths conscripted from various places to cast cannons—tens of thousands of people gathering here with at least some stable monthly income made the area outside Zhenyang Gate develop into a considerable market district. Shops and vendors crowded together, all manner of businesses thriving. Hawkers' cries were constant.

He sat at a roadside tea stall, ordered a pot of tea, crossed his legs, and drank slowly, occasionally looking up at Penglai Pavilion atop Danya Mountain. He put on an expression of great interest. Huang Ande knew he was currently a "spy," but he wasn't particularly afraid. Unlike the Elders who easily slipped up the moment they opened their mouths, he was a local born and bred. The Huang family had been military households here for generations. Though his immediate family was gone, he still had many clan relatives locally, most serving as soldiers. Getting a familiar contact to help him enter the water city wouldn't be a problem.

But though many soldiers in military vests came and went on the market street, he didn't recognize any of them. Some faces looked vaguely familiar, but he couldn't recall their names and didn't dare approach carelessly. He had "fled as a criminal" back then. He needed a reliable person to ask around first. Otherwise, if he really got bound up and dragged to the navy yamen, by the time Master Zhao got him out with Sun Yuanhua's calling card, he'd have suffered plenty.

While staring blankly, Huang Ande suddenly felt someone tap his back lightly. Turning around, he saw a young man looking at him.

The man had appeared somewhat hesitant at first, but upon seeing his face clearly, his expression turned to delighted surprise.

"It really is you!"

"You are... Ah! Little Brother!" After a moment's hesitation, Huang Ande recognized him too. The man was named Sun Yuan. By the reckoning of distant relations, he could be considered a cousin. He was also a former comrade-in-arms who had served locally.

After several years, Sun Yuan had filled out quite well. Though still wearing a military vest, the quality was good, and his complexion was healthy.

Huang Ande clasped Sun Yuan's hand, looking him up and down for quite a while before asking: "Cousin, after several years apart, you're quite different now. Still at the battery?"

Sun Yuan smiled: "I'm a personal retainer for Governor Sun now. The higher-ups said once I get a recommendation, they'll promote me to a supernumerary officer position."

Huang Ande knew that in the army, becoming a personal guard for a general or civil official was a good way out for ordinary garrison soldiers. Promotions aside, at least you got your pay on time and the food was much better than regular soldiers. Especially serving as a retainer for a governor like Sun Yuanhua—few opportunities to fight and die, less likely to lose your life—truly an excellent position.

He laughed: "After all, there's only one way to write the character 'Sun'—your surname gave you the advantage!"

Sun Yuan looked a bit embarrassed: "Not at all. I got this retainer position through my artillery skills. You know, Governor Sun brought quite a few Franks from Guangzhou to train artillery casting and gunnery. The Portuguese artillery instructor Master Pedro praised me several times, and I was taken on as a retainer."

"Not easy! But you really were dedicated to learning artillery!" Huang Ande knew that soldiers generally didn't want to be gunners. Though cannons weren't rare in the Ming, their quality was poor and usage wasn't well standardized. Operating cannons often caused accidents with frequent casualties. In peacetime, you also had to keep the cannon clean, yet the extra pay was only a few coins. Most soldiers just went through the motions when drilling with cannons—few were actually dedicated.

"Not at all!" Sun Yuan demurred modestly, then asked: "Brother De, you've been gone for years now—where have you settled? Not a word!"

Huang Ande asked quietly: "Let me ask you first—is that old business settled?"

Sun Yuan started, then realized he was asking about the granary theft. "Settled long ago. Among those caught, Zhu San took all the blame—he was beheaded. The others got arrow parades and a few dozen military strokes."

Hearing this, Huang Ande couldn't help but sigh: "Zhu San was a real man—loyal and true!" He thought about reaching into his pocket for some silver to have sent to Zhu San's family, then remembered that Xu Ke had said during training not to flash money around until he knew the situation.

Sun Yuan said: "Who would disagree! Don't worry, everyone's been looking after them!" He looked at Huang Ande: "Brother De! Want to come back to duty? Using your real name to enlist would be risky, but with a new name you'd be fine! My family's fifth uncle helps with paperwork—change your name and get enlisted first."

"No need for that." Huang Ande said. "I'm working as a personal attendant for someone now—food and clothing provided. Nothing to complain about." He then recited the cover story the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had fabricated: that after fleeing to Guangdong, he had sold himself to a gentry family as a retainer, earned his master's trust, and was now a personal attendant. This time he had accompanied his master to the Penglai area on business.

"Doing business here without some skill won't work—your master must be quite a person of importance!" Having spent many years here and seen much, Sun Yuan was also happy for Huang Ande. Being a personal attendant to gentry, though a servile position, had good prospects—just as being a retainer was better than being a regular soldier. And serving gentry meant no fighting and risking one's life—even better.

"Of course. Though my master is only a *xiucai*, he's a great landowner from Guangzhou with connections to the big officials in the capital." Huang Ande boasted. "Just a few days ago he visited Governor Sun." He said, "Come—let's share a drink, just us brothers!" Having finally found a contact, Huang Ande naturally wanted to solidify the relationship quickly. Besides, this Sun Yuan really wasn't an outsider—they had often hung out together in the old soldiering days.

Since Sun Yuan was off duty today with no drills, and it was a reunion of old friends, he was quite happy and readily agreed. He even insisted on treating.

"Let me treat instead." Huang Ande said. "I know you—though you're a retainer now, your pay is only two taels, and you probably don't even get the full amount each month. You've got your old mother and brothers at home. I'm a bachelor—I eat my master's food, drink his drink, and my monthly allowance is never short. No problem!"

They found a small tavern and got a private room, ordering wine and dishes. The two talked of old times and old friends. Huang Ande inquired about many former friends, relatives, and acquaintances. Gradually the conversation turned to news about generals and officers. Sun Yuan had no wariness and no sense of secrecy. After a few cups of wine, he told everything he knew: who had been promoted, who had died in battle, who had been transferred... Before long, Huang Ande had learned about fifty or sixty percent of the general situation at Penglai Water City.
