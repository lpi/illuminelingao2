# Chapter 323 - County-wide Bandit Suppression

The collection of bandit intelligence in Lingao began in full swing after the Political Consultative Conference ended. With the liaison officer system, the intelligence department could obtain firsthand direct information from local natives, which was much more in-depth than the objective observations made by reconnaissance teams who were unfamiliar with the people and places in the past. Moreover, the ins and outs were also clearer.

To ensure the accuracy and objectivity of intelligence, the Intelligence Committee cross-referenced and compared the intelligence provided by various villages when collecting data.

Because bandits often had obvious regional characteristics, various villages, either due to clan relationships or being fellow townsmen, often shielded bandits from their own townships. And bandits mostly followed the rule of "rabbits don't eat grass around their burrows," leaving some leeway for locals while specifically plaguing villages in other areas.

In this social ecology, liaison officers were not immune either. Therefore, their reports would inevitably contain concealments or exaggerations based on the closeness of the relationship between the bandits and their own villages. Between villages and between clans, there were also interspersed feuds, so it couldn't be ruled out that some people deliberately mixed in untruths to slander and malign others. Therefore, clues could only be seen by comparing intelligence from various villages.

After more than a month of research on liaison officers, the intelligence department had already understood a lot of intelligence on Lingao's bandit situation. Another important channel was Wang Zhaomin. Although he was an outsider, he had lived here as a guest for more than five years and usually assisted the magistrate in handling government affairs, so he knew a lot about various situations in the county, especially regarding banditry, where the yamen had abundant data. The intelligence department met with him privately several times and obtained a large amount of useful materials from him.

"Although the bandits in Lingao are as messy as hemp, the most critical one is the stubborn bandit Dang Namen," Wang Zhaomin said in a low voice in a private room at the "Half the Sky" restaurant. "The others are all small bandit bands and can't make any big waves. These two groups of bandits are deeply rooted and very hard to deal with. As long as they are eliminated, Lingao's scattered bandits will naturally lose their reliance. And Lingao will be peaceful within its four borders."

Most bandits were "home-dwelling bandits." If the mountain stronghold was destroyed and the bandit leaders and core personnel eliminated, the "home-dwelling bandits" would lose their backbone and old nest. Naturally, they would have no heart to continue doing evil. As long as they were then pacified and recruited, the bandit trouble could be settled very quickly.

"Historically, in bandit suppression, the ringleaders must be punished, but followers are not prosecuted," Wang Zhaomin said. "You cannot be unaware of the four words 'temper severity with mercy' (宽严相济)."

"Yes, yes," Luo Duo just nodded in agreement, then asked, "Why do you say this group is the hardest to deal with?" He poured him a full cup of wine. "Please teach me, Sir."

"It's a long story." Wang Zhaomin was slightly tipsy, but his mind was actually very clear. He knew the intentions of this group of Australians; most likely they wanted to clean up the "side of the couch." But this was also good. Since the government could neither deal with the bandits nor eliminate the Australians, letting them tear at each other might even allow him to reap the third party's profit. So he pretended to be drunk and started talking:

Dang Namen, formal name Dang Guodong, was a native of Daolu Village. After his parents died, he made a living herding cattle for a family in the village. After growing up, he lived as a small peddler. Because he had no relatives in the village, he was bullied for a long time. His own homestead was also seized by a family in the village.

Dang Namen later frequently engaged in petty theft. In the late Wanli years, he was twisted to the county yamen by villagers and thrown into prison. The next year, he broke out of prison, gathered a few like-minded brothers, returned to the village, and killed more than ten villagers who had grievances with him. Then he looted property and went to Baopang Mountain on the border of Lingao and Danzhou to become an outlaw.

"Don't look down on Dang Namen just because he comes from a mud-legged background. He is literate and loved reading since childhood. Unfortunately, with no one to promote him, a perfectly good seed for reading fell into the evil path." Wang Zhaomin sighed. "Having read books and then taken the evil path, he is even harder to deal with than ordinary bandits."

Because Dang Namen knew some characters, although he hadn't read serious military books, he had read quite a few novels like *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* and *Water Margin* and learned strategies and tactics from them. Therefore, the bandits he led often made unexpected moves, and the general village braves of the county were simply no match for him.

"Take his attack on Longbo Stronghold for example," Wang Zhaomin said excitedly. "Dang Namen took dozens of people, dressed up as farmers going to the market, and entered Longbo Stronghold with goods. Using the opportunity of paying taxes to the market, they mixed into the militia bureau. A few people guarded the door, and a few set off firecrackers outside. He led people rushing in and killed the militia instructor in the bureau. The militia fell into confusion, and Longbo Stronghold with over a hundred militia was broken by the thirty people he led. Tell me, is he formidable or not?"

Luo Duo nodded. This Dang Namen indeed had some little tricks. This tactic of coordinating inside and outside to strike the snake at its head was quite beautiful. No wonder Master Wang said this group of bandits was formidable.

"Moreover, he knows how to win people's hearts!" Master Wang tapped the table lightly. "This Dang Namen consistently advocates 'rob the rich, not the poor' outside, which has attracted a group of ignorant fools. It caused villagers in places like Jialai and Meitai to refuse to pay rent, making landlords complain endlessly. They often come to the county yamen to sue. Finally, a few years ago, Master Huang helped and led braves to inflict heavy losses on Dang Namen's gang. Their arrogance became less rampant."

"Master Huang?"

"It's Huang Shoutong of Huang Family Stronghold, Master Huang." Wang Zhaomin noticed Luo Duo's reaction. "The braves he leads are very sturdy; Dang Namen is no match for them. Unfortunately, the villagers are ignorant and many cover up and hide tracks for him, allowing him to run back to Baopang Mountain in the end, failing to achieve total success! truly a pity..."

"So Master Huang is a public-spirited and righteous person."

"Naturally, naturally," Wang Zhaomin vaguely knew that the Australians wanted to take root locally, but the militia of Huang Family Stronghold was the only force Magistrate Wu could rely on. He couldn't let the Australians pull them over or consume them in the name of bandit suppression. "Unfortunately, Master Huang was injured last time and his health has been poor. Regarding bandit suppression, I'm afraid he won't be able to help."

Luo Duo remained noncommittal, only nodding.

"...According to intelligence, the Dang Namen bandit gang mainly entrenches in the Baopang Mountain area at the junction of Lingao and Danzhou. This is their old camp." Luo Duo held a pointer, pointing at the map to introduce. "There are perennially more than three hundred bandits in the stronghold. They have firearms."

The officers below watched the markings on the map intently. Luo Duo continued: "But their base area is in the 'Thirteen Villages' region at the junction of Jialai and Meitai. Whether supplies or personnel, they are replenished from this area. Once something happens, they can pull up another team of four or five hundred people from here."

A murmur of discussion arose from the crowd. Someone raised a point: "Doesn't this equate to 'no good people in Hongtong County'? Are all able-bodied men in this area suspected of being bandits?"

"That is the case." Luo Duo nodded. "The Dang Namen gang regards this area as their own forbidden meat; they never harm it themselves, and they don't allow other bandits to intrude. They are very popular."

"Equivalent to a separatist force!"

"No, it can't be called separatist yet. According to Master Wang, the tax payment in the 'Thirteen Villages' area has never been short. It's just that the county gets no extra benefits."

"Actually, Dang Namen's thinking is similar to ours: not a penny less for regular tax, not a penny more for surcharge. With guns as backing, the county can do nothing to them."

"Did the 'Thirteen Villages' area attend the recent Political Consultative Conference?" He Ming asked.

Luo Duo said: "They all came. I checked the relevant records of the meeting. The representatives didn't speak; they basically just followed the crowd. Grain requisition, dispatching labor, sending liaison officers—they agreed to do it all."

"Dang Namen understands struggle strategies quite well."

"That is so." Luo Duo answered very cautiously. "In terms of struggle strategies, he has quite some ideas."

"The Dang Namen gang are mostly poor commoners, and he himself comes from a persecuted poor background. He also knows 'rob the rich, not the poor,' so he should be considered to have revolutionary consciousness." Someone said, "Actually, characterizing them as bandits is wrong, right? They should be a spontaneous peasant resistance organization. We can win them over."

"Not disturbing people is relative." Luo Duo said. "Only the Thirteen Villages area is slightly better, but harassment in other places is very severe." things like robbery, murder, kidnapping, and snatching civilian women—this bandit gang has done them all without exception. It's not just the rich who are harmed; the poor are equally unlucky. To insist on calling it some 'peasant resistance' or 'uprising' is self-deception.

He Ming explained: "The reason the Bandit Suppression Command chose to operate on them first is: one, their power is the largest, knocking them out serves as a warning to others; two, this gang has incurred great public wrath. We have a just cause."

Luo Duo continued, "In the 'Thirteen Villages' area, this bandit gang has two important henchmen leading twenty or thirty people stationed permanently to control the situation. The leaders are named Xin Nari and Wang Wushu."

"Xin Nari and Wang Wushu are two of the Four Heavenly Kings under Dang Namen." Wang Zhaomin said to Luo Duo, "The so-called Four Heavenly Kings are just to make up numbers, but these two people cannot be underestimated."

Xin Nari had been an idler since childhood. After growing up, because he loved ease and hated work, he sucked up to the "Fast Hands" (detectives/constables) in the county yamen and became a "Zuo Gong De" (Functionary). "Zuo Gong De" was not a formal runner in the county yamen, similar to an off-the-books "temp," whose income depended entirely on various customary bribes and extortion. Illegal dealings that runners couldn't show their faces for were handled by these people. If something happened, these people would take the fall. Fortunately, with connections inside and outside, they were usually let off lightly, and even the magistrate had no choice. Once the heat passed, they continued to be "Zuo Gong De."

Xin Nari was extremely active in being a "Zuo Gong De." Not counting bullying the common people, he finally lost his mind to greed and targeted the gentry. in the end, he couldn't stay any longer, and the "Fast Hands" were unwilling to offend the gentry for him—after all, there were plenty of "Zuo Gong De"; one more was not many, one less was not few. Xin Nari lost this job and simply went up the mountain to become an outlaw.

"...This person has a flexible mind and some petty cleverness. He is also good at snobbery and very adept at flattering people. So although he is currently a bandit, he has connections with many petty officials in the county yamen and bad gentry locally. At the slightest sign of trouble, someone will naturally tip him off." Wang Zhaomin reminded, "Our Master Wu and Master Huang wanted to arrest him several times, but he slipped away every time."

As for Wang Wushu, although not someone with a flexible mind, he was extremely savage and cruel, famous for killing without blinking an eye. He practiced martial arts since childhood and had some hard qigong skills. When he participated in brawls in his youth, he wasn't killed by knives or injured by spears, having quite a legendary color. These two, one civil and one martial, permanently stationed in the "Thirteen Villages" territory, controlled this area very tightly.

After Luo Duo introduced the basic situation, the attendees discussed how to suppress this group of bandits. The plans were basically divided into two types: one was to hit "Thirteen Villages" first, remove the bandit forces, making the bandits on the mountain lose grain and personnel supplies and fall into chaos without fighting, then besiege the mountain stronghold when the time was ripe.

The other was the idea of capturing the ringleader first, advocating attacking the Baopang Mountain area first to destroy the bandit nest, and then forcing the bandits in Thirteen Villages to surrender without fighting.

Both plans had pros and cons. After comprehensive consideration, it was finally decided to attack the mountain stronghold first.

"If we hit Thirteen Villages first, it will be difficult to handle the local civil affairs issues." As a member of the Civil Affairs Committee and also a member of the Bandit Suppression Command, Wu De said, "The local people have concerns and are unwilling to have much contact with us. The bandits have an old nest to rely on and can use the civilians as cover to launch frantic attacks on us. If our large army stations there, we will be very passive. In the end, we might very likely take indiscriminate retaliatory actions due to endless attacks, finally forming an antagonistic relationship, which will be very difficult to clean up later."

The form of combat would adopt raid battles by lean, synthesized small units. Investing large troops in mountain bandit suppression was not worth the loss. Large troop movements were hard to keep secret; bandits could transfer all materials and personnel beforehand, leaving only an empty stronghold. Not to mention deploying one or two infantry battalions, even if thousands of troops searched the mountains, bandits could easily dodge them. Staying in the mountains for a long time, supplies couldn't be transported in, so large troops couldn't dwell in the mountains for long. Over time, the troops could only retreat. In the past, bandits used this method to deal with government army suppression—it worked every time.

Yang Zeng, Platoon Leader of the 1st Platoon, Jaeger Company, 1st Infantry Regiment, was marching in the mountains. The late spring forest was extremely steep and humid. Sweat had soaked through his uniform. He carried his beloved rifle on his shoulder and carried two hundred rounds of ammunition on his body.

Behind him followed his Jaeger platoon, then a mountain howitzer and all its belongings: shells, gunpowder, ramrods, etc. These odds and ends were all transported by men, using a full forty "Education Soldiers"—soldiers currently under training who hadn't been formally awarded the rank of private. Behind them was an infantry company, and then over a hundred Education Soldiers carrying a large amount of logistics equipment. Named "Military Laborers," they were actually the "Soldiers Replacing Livestock for Transport" created by Xi Yazhou. Recruits weren't of much use, but carrying things was always possible. Bringing up the rear was the Engineer Platoon, led personally by Engineer Company Commander Pan Da.
