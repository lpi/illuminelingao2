# Chapter 99 - Work in Li Area (2)

This strange team walked on the main road leading to Lipan Du. Eight Li people carried salt used as trade goods on their backs. The transmigrators were fully armed—they might encounter Ming troops or bandits on the way, both of whom were equally greedy for wealth.

There were already pedestrians coming and going on the road. Seeing such a strange team coming, they avoided the road from a distance. The farmers in the fields were not disturbed much, still busy with the final work before harvesting. The water in the rice fields had been drained. The rice was about to ripen. The personnel from the agricultural department accompanying the team were estimating how much rice could be harvested roughly.

Less than an hour on foot, the county seat appeared in everyone's vision. In the two months since landing, the transmigrators and the Daming local government in this city had fought a fierce battle. But except for a few personnel from the Military Team and Communications Team monitoring the county seat, most people saw this ruling center of Daming Lingao County for the first time. The original tense atmosphere had disappeared. There were much fewer militia on the city wall. The city gate was also open. People came and went on the road, looking a bit lively. Villagers were setting up stalls at the city gate selling vegetables, chickens, ducks, and firewood. A scene of peace.

Seeing their arrival, there seemed to be a burst of tension on the city wall. The leading Lu Rong saw a person wearing armor looking around on the city wall. To avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, the entire team did not approach the city gate, maintaining a distance and passing slowly. The farmers who were originally packing up stalls ready to run saw them pass by far away without committing any crime, and all breathed a sigh of relief.

According to the few captives, their Dong was more than one hundred li away from the county seat, so they couldn't walk there in one day. They had to rest for one night on the way.

"Didn't expect it to be so desolate along the road!" Mu Min exclaimed. There were few fields along the way, mostly grasslands with large patches of wild grass taller than a person.

"Lingao itself is a remote small county." Wen Desi was also in the team, but his participation in this action was purely out of curiosity and for relaxation. After D-Day, he was busy with meetings, reviewing documents, and drafting materials every day, busier than before. He didn't even have time for his usual favorite outdoor sports. Just take this opportunity to recover.

As for safety issues, he didn't feel any danger. For a person who never left stab-resistant clothing, had many anti-wolf sprays in his bag, and liked to play with and carry a long folding knife and a 1.2-meter-long Western bastard sword, whether Chinese and foreign pirates or Daming official troops, rural militia, plus bandits, were all scum. Let alone the twenty or so people around him were all armed to the teeth, except for steel helmets—for the sake of lightness, replaced with uniform rattan safety helmets. This batch of products was the first batch of finished products manufactured by the industrial department after researching for more than a month. Originally planned to be colonial style, but the product came out looking a bit nondescript. However, after installing leather suspension, it felt okay to wear. A sunshade cloth, commonly known as a butt curtain, was sewn on the back of the hat.

"So strange. Since there is so much wasteland, why does no one reclaim it? Those captives, whether Li or Han, are either tenant farmers or long-term laborers. It's not like there is no water here, and the land doesn't look barren."

"Lack of water." Wen Desi hadn't done farm work, but understood the basic principle.

"Nonsense, such a big river, lack of water?"

"Water is still in the river. It's only useful when irrigated into the fields. Irrigation is a big subject. Need to lift water, have channels, build sluices..."

"Why not open channels?"

"Water conservancy projects are troublesome," Wen Desi explained, "It's too difficult for individual households to dig irrigation canals themselves. In all dynasties, water conservancy was organized by the government. It requires a lot of labor and money."

"So it is. It's really not easy to do anything." Mu Min sighed, "Then why did you come here? Isn't it good to stay in the 21st century? Why run to this space-time to take risks?"

Wen Desi smiled unfathomably. He was embarrassed to say he wanted to be a god in this world. However, Mu Min obviously interpreted that profound smile as obscenity, and curled her lips:
"Really annoying, you men are the most disgusting!"

Ming Lang, following far behind, saw his wife actually chatting and laughing with the bandit leader President Wen, wishing he could rush up and give President Wen a machete chop first. These days really depressed him badly. Since knowing this was Ming Dynasty Lingao, their family of four had been in a state of semi-house arrest. The wonderful family of four Hainan tour turned into a permanent tour of Daming Lingao—this group of crazy bandits wanted to come to Ming Dynasty, but their family had no such plan!

He also hated his wife for being meddlesome, insisting on helping in some Public Security Group, wearing that ugly-to-death training uniform every day, going to work excitedly. Not only coming home very late, but also jabbering about everything she saw to the family after coming back. Dad too: at first he was sullen and silent all day, but after listening to his daughter-in-law say a lot, don't know which nerve was touched, he actually took the initiative to ask them for job arrangement—said to be preparing to be a naval advisor?! Hearing this, Ming Lang thought he was having a fever: Dad, this old Communist Party member, old People's Navy, now actually wants to wallow in the mire with this group of people? As for his mom, originally a social activist, she got familiar with the women here a few days after arriving at Bairen Camp, not staying home every day. A few days ago she was saying she wanted to set up a Women's Welfare Society to do business.

Looking down, only he was doing the worst. Probably feeling he was useless, he hadn't been assigned any formal work until now, just being a miserable "basic laborer" day after day, working with local coolies. This time his wife said she wanted to go to the Li area to carry out work, and he hurriedly signed up too. Xiao Zishan wanted to refuse at first, but on second thought, they are a legal couple, not allowing the man to go seemed unreasonable.

Only in this way did he manage to follow along, but his wife was the "National Consultant" of this team, obviously a core member, much higher in rank than him, a person of porter nature. Since departure, she had been with the few team leaders, sometimes studying work, sometimes talking and laughing—he was very angry, and the consequences were serious!

During the lunch break, the Communications Team called the headquarters in Bairen City with the field radio as usual to report safety. Before departure, it was agreed to contact every three hours. The expedition team should report its current location so that the headquarters could grasp its movements. Everyone began to taste several kinds of field food just developed by the agricultural department: "Jinhua Crisp Cake" personally made by Wu Nanhai but with a very weird taste, so-called "Japanese Rice Ball" with rice vinegar and dried plums added, and walnut-sized things made of unknown stuff, with three combined Chinese characters "Soldier ration pill" written on the packaging bamboo tube, claiming one pill could equal a meal...

"What is all this stuff!" Lu Rong ate a rice ball so sour that his teeth were about to fall out—although this food was not delicious, it successfully dispelled all his strong appetite after walking for half a day, which could be considered achieving the effect.

"Everyone rest for a while, depart immediately." Just saying, suddenly saw Mu Min walk out slowly from behind a stone, clapping her hands.

"Seemed to have lost weight, not exciting to hit—"

The journey was safe and uneventful. As they got closer to the Li area, the ground became more and more rugged, changing from gentle slopes to undulating hilly mountains. Pedestrians on the road were also rare. Occasionally met Han peddlers carrying loads going to the Li area, and also Li people carrying goods out for trade. Seeing them, they all hid far away. Lu Rong wanted to find a few people to ask about the situation ahead but couldn't do it.

The team's marching speed slowed down. Survey team members would stop from time to time to correct the map. Some would also run out to pick up a few stones and gather some plants. Every time at this moment, everyone took the opportunity to rest and relax their muscles and bones.

The exploration results made them very excited: there was a distribution of coal mine belts here. Although the quality was very poor, lignite with very low calorific value, and the reserves were not high, the coal belt should extend very long to the south. The modern Nanbao Coal Mine is roughly in this orientation. Lignite is not very suitable for fuel, but can be processed into very good chemical fertilizer. The most exciting news was discovering traces of many limonite ore veins, and buried relatively shallowly, suitable for small-scale open-pit mining.

"We must open this trade channel as soon as possible." Wen Desi was very excited.

"The Ming army on the road is a trouble." Lu Rong frowned.

On the way, they encountered two Ming army checkpoints and a camp. But seeing them passing fully armed, the guarding soldiers ignored them. Wen Desi took the opportunity to observe the appearance of their future military opponents: the soldiers were all emaciated and yellow-faced. Let alone armor, even a complete piece of clothing couldn't be found on them. Couldn't help wondering in his heart: with an army of this appearance, a few hundred people could actually guard the border of the Li area. Either their combat effectiveness was very strong, or the combat effectiveness of Li people was very poor.

"En," Wen Desi nodded, "Negotiate terms with Li people first. We send technicians, they are responsible for mining. Exchange with products, saving the trouble of opening another branch base."

After breakfast, according to the captives, this was already the edge of the Li area, but Han merchants still came and went frequently. Walking further forward was Juti Village, where there was a large Ming army camp called Nanlue Camp, guarding and monitoring the key pass Fanbao Mountain entering the Li area. However, the soldiers in the camp were all Li soldiers. Although there were interrogations and extortion, there was no major hindrance.

Wen Desi knew from the "Li Situation Bulletin" given to him by the Intelligence and Data Group: The terrain of Fanbao Mountain is dangerous, with only a one-person wide mountain path passing through. This place is the main pass dividing the Han and Li sides. Without safety guarantees, it is best not to cross this place. However, the Li Dongs of these few captives were all to the north of the pass. According to them, passing Fanbao Mountain, there were mostly Sheng Li (Raw Li/Uncivilized Li). Sheng and Shu Li each had their own dialects and living habits were not quite the same. They rarely interacted with each other—only uniting when rebelling.
