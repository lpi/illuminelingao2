# Chapter 103 - Salt Field (2)

Even in modern times with large-scale mechanized production, sun-drying salt remains a labor-intensive and extremely arduous job. It is far from simply digging some condensation and evaporation pools on the beach to produce salt in bulk. The ancients knew very early on that seawater accumulated on shore reefs could evaporate to condense a small amount of salt, but until the Yuan Dynasty, boiling seawater for salt was still the most widespread salt production method. Sun-drying salt was not as simple as imagined—theory needs a systematic process flow to be applied in production practice. Wang Luobin had seen salt field production in rural Guangxi. The process flow involved introducing seawater from the tidal ditch outside the dam into the water storage ditch inside the dam, then using power machinery to send water from high to low through trunk and branch waterways into evaporation pools. When the brine reached 5-10 degrees (Baumé degrees), it was put into the brine sunning pool, then concentrated to 20-25 degrees, collected by the brine transport ditch back to the brine machine room, then lifted by power to the brine pool, and finally injected into the crystallization pool. The brine depth was 6-8 centimeters, and the concentration had to be maintained at 26-28 degrees to dry out salt.

In ancient times, obviously, such production conditions were impossible. How they increased the concentration of brine under primitive conditions was a question he was very interested in.

The village head took him and Xiong Buyou to the dike. Below the dike was a large area of stone salt drying troughs shaped like inkstones. The arrangement of these salt troughs was very particular; they seemed to be piled up irregularly, but in fact, they were scattered high and low in an orderly manner. This was to fully utilize sunlight. In the center surrounded by salt troughs were patches of pitch-black salt fields. The village head said that there were a total of more than 7,000 salt troughs in the village now, all carved and polished by ancestors and passed down from generation to generation.

The salt field is a muddy tidal flat, which they call "salt mud." In the dry season when the sunlight is relatively strong, the seawater from the twice-monthly high tides will flood this salt mud. The salt mud has the effect of absorbing salt from the seawater. When the seawater recedes, the salt mud is raked loose with a rake, and then dried in the sun for a few days to evaporate the moisture. This salt mud then contains a fairly high salt content.

Then the salt mud containing salt is put into the salt pond, which is completely manual labor: using a wooden board rake to put the sun-dried mud into the salt pond. The so-called salt pond is a pool dug on the salt field, 2 meters wide, 3 meters long, and 1 meter deep, lined with bamboo strips and thatch at the bottom to act as a filter.

After the salt mud enters the pond, the salt workers need to tread it solid with their feet, then inject seawater. The filtered water flows out from a small opening reserved beside the salt pond into the brine pool on the side, resulting in a pool of brine.

How to judge the concentration of brine? The salt workers will break a stem of a plant called Huangyuci (Suaeda salsa) growing by the salt field and put it into the brine pool. Only when the Huangyuci stem floats on the water surface is it true saturated saltwater; otherwise, it needs to be exposed to the sun repeatedly.

The brine is carried to the salt troughs. The salt troughs are made of volcanic rock. Wang Luobin looked carefully; there were fine and dense small holes on the stones, perhaps for water permeability? Before the sun rises, the brine is poured into the salt troughs. After a day of exposure, by dusk, the salt can be scraped with a board and collected into bamboo baskets. In the sunniest and hottest season, a salt trough with two or three additions of brine can all evaporate dry.

At this time, most of the salt troughs were empty, but there were still some salt troughs with salt crystals dried out, shining with crystal light under the sun, which was very beautiful.

Wang Luobin looked at these more than 7,000 salt troughs: using such the most primitive labor method, this place could produce more than 200 tons of salt a year. He couldn't help but marvel at the infinite wisdom of ancient people.

There was a shed for tools on the dike. Out of curiosity about ancient salt field tools, Wang Luobin walked in to take a look. Inside were piled many tools, looking not much different from what he had seen in salt fields in the past. He tried the rake for raking the ground and found it much heavier than modern products—ancient times lacked processing capabilities and could only use the clumsiest methods to manufacture. Dragging such heavy tools to work under the sun in the scorching summer was really a very hard thing.

He approached a sun-drying salt trough, which had already condensed a layer of white salt, crystal clear and very beautiful, and extremely fine. It looked very much like refined salt produced by modern salt factories—this greatly exceeded his expectations. He had never seen sea salt reach this level without refining processes. He dipped some with his finger and put it in his mouth; it was much less salty than the fine salt brought along and melted instantly in the mouth.

He didn't know what the sodium chloride content was. There were no instruments here to analyze it. But Wang Luobin knew that just based on the appearance of this salt, there was no worry about it not being a hot-selling item.

But it was too unexpected that this place was so impoverished. The ancient working people were really living in deep water and scorching fire.

While lamenting, he suddenly saw a group of people walking towards the dike. The leader was riding a horse—a rare sight locally—followed by a large group of figures in blue clothes. Seeing this, Village Head Tan showed a look of both fear and disgust on his face. He turned to Wang Luobin and said, "It's Great Household Gou."

"Great Household Gou?" Wang Luobin vaguely remembered this name but had forgotten where he saw it.

"En, en." Village Head Tan seemed afraid of this big household's power, not even having time to say one more sentence to him, and hurriedly went up to welcome them, clasping his hands in greeting, bending his waist and bowing his back, with a very respectful attitude.

Wang Luobin didn't know who this Great Household Gou was, but seeing Village Head Tan's respectful and fearful appearance, this person was certainly not of a kind sort, nine out of ten being a local tyrant or bully. They were currently weak in numbers and found it difficult to deal directly with such a person, so they simply watched from the dike.

He saw the person on horseback scolding repeatedly, while Village Head Tan bowed and scraped, seemingly begging for something. This pantomime went on for a while, and Village Head Tan dejectedly led the people towards the village, actually leaving them on the dike without asking or caring. Wang Luobin busily notified the people still moving salt in the village of this situation via walkie-talkie, asking them to pay attention to alert.

But the comers obviously didn't dare to provoke them. The power of the short-haired pirates was now known to women and children in Lingao. After quite a while, the village head returned to the dike and led them back to the village with a sad face.

Xiong Buyou asked for a long time before finally figuring out the whole story. It turned out that according to government regulations, the salt field adopted a system of commutation payment. That is to say, the salt workers did not need to pay the fixed amount of salt directly to the government, but converted the salt into rice or silver. The old rule was that each yin was converted into one shi of rice. Later, the conversion to rice was changed to conversion to silver: first converting salt into rice, then converting into silver according to the rice price. The salt quota of Maniao Salt Field was "one thousand four hundred and seventeen yin and two hundred and thirty jin," so the commuted rice was more than one thousand four hundred shi. Calculated according to the market price in the Tianqi and Chongzhen eras, the commuted silver would be nearly two thousand taels.

Paying salt tax by commutation had certain benefits for the salt workers: production was no longer supervised and controlled by the government. As long as the salt tax was paid on time, basically one could do whatever one wanted, without needing to dedicate oneself to the Ming Dynasty's salt affairs day and night. After producing salt, merchants would naturally come to buy it. If much salt was dried and the market price was good, life would be quite passable. Some who found sun-drying salt too bitter even paid the salt tax silver with income from business or land reclamation.

But after the earthquake, everything changed. Great Household Gou's father took advantage of the difficulties when the village's salt fields were washed away and salt tax silver could not be paid on time. Through lending money and advancing payments, he gradually controlled most of the salt sales. But his purchase price was much lower than the market price. The salt that the salt workers dried with back-breaking labor was not even enough to fill this serial usury debt. He also colluded with the government to monopolize the salt tax, insisting that since the rice price was now high, the commutation for each shi of rice had to be three taels of silver. The usury here could not be paid off, and the official tax there was owed in a mess. The salt workers knew he was playing tricks but had to beg him to intercede with the government. Over time, the Gou family became the actual rulers of the village. The salt fields seemed to have become the private property of the Gou family, with increasing exploitation. Plus, pirates came to Lingao frequently in these years, always robbing the salt quotas in the salt fields and killing many people, so the village became more and more withered. The able-bodied men dared not go home usually, gathering in some inland places to reclaim land and farm for a living.

As for his purpose just now, it was actually to urge the payment of this month's "customary silver," and also to tell him to call back all the able-bodied men to dry salt, otherwise, the women, children, and elderly in the village would be arrested and put in jail.

"Jail?" Wang Luobin asked, "Is he an official?"

"No, it's his family's private jail." Village Head Tan shuddered as he spoke, "The Gou family is terrible. Not just a private jail, anyone who provokes his family could be arrested and tortured to death—"

Speaking of this, he hurriedly shut his mouth, probably feeling he had said too much, and just urged them to move the salt and leave quickly. Wang Luobin felt that the salt village matter was a complex problem. The issues involved here perhaps really needed a land reform work team to handle.

In order to obtain the Executive Committee's guidance on this, he returned to Bairen City that night. Although some committee members were not in the city, the remaining people discussed and approved the work team idea he proposed: send a capable team to station in the salt field, help the local villagers restore production, and arm the salt workers to get rid of the threat of bullies and pirates, making Maniao Salt Field an important salt chemical raw material base for the transmigrators.

Because this was the first time the transmigrators truly comprehensively transformed a place from a social level, every group attached great importance to this matter and selected personnel to form a salt field work team.

Originally, the Executive Committee intended to let Wang Luobin serve as the work team captain, but Engineer Wang believed that this position would be best held by someone who understood military affairs and had strong social interaction skills. Finally, Xi Yazhou was determined.

The cultural and propaganda organization work was undertaken by Du Wen—since landing, apart from reading broadcast scripts that no one listened to every day, she hadn't gotten any real work to do. Hearing about going for "land reform" this time, she immediately got excited and volunteered to participate. The entire work team totaled thirty people, including a doctor—He Ma.

Everyone carried sufficient weapons: pistols, rifles, daggers, and a large amount of ammunition. He Ma brought many medicines and simple surgical instruments. Considering they might be stationed there for a long time, the work team also brought wind turbines and other equipment. The food problem was troublesome—besides eating themselves, they might also need to relieve the local common people. Although Xiao Zishan had already led people to Guangzhou for large-scale purchasing, there was still some time before the first batch of grain could be transported back. Wu Nanhai dared not give too much either, allocating one week's grain and non-staple food first.
