# Chapter 1936 - Xu Laowu

"Old Xu," hearing this familiar, slightly deep male voice, Senator Xu Yicheng, who was buried in the Senate BBS trying to gauge public sentiment, immediately guessed what he was about to hear. "Could I trouble you to keep an eye on the main hall again? The kindergarten just called saying the child hasn't stopped crying."

Looking up at the middle-aged face that was a mix of haggardness and anxiety, Senator Xu lost any desire to tease him. After all, they were old colleagues who had worked together for years. Being reduced to the "Disgrace of the Senate" was miserable enough. Ever since the Second Plenary Session passed the clause authorizing the General Office to intervene in Senators' domestic affairs when necessary, and under the "strong suggestions" of the Senators, the General Office had used the implementation of the "Centralized Rearing System for Senators' Children" as a pretext to effectively strip Zhang Yunmi's father of his Living Secretary's right to raise the children, sending both kids to the nursery affiliated with the Academy.

With this, the Senators were largely satisfied, but Zhang Yunmi's father was out of luck. Now that Yunyu couldn't look after the children, the nursery notified the father whenever anything happened. Old Zhang was left wanting to cry but having no tears, and Yunyu was making a fuss at home every day. Old Zhang often cried about his family crisis to Xu Laowu. Xu Laowu's ears were practically growing calluses from listening to it.

For these kinds of messy affairs where domestic chores and emotions were tangled together, he, an outsider, really had no room to speak. Xu Yicheng generally held an attitude of "understanding and sympathy," helping out where he could, so naturally, he didn't make things difficult for him this time. Sending off the profusely thanking father of Zhang Yunmi, Senator Xu locked his computer desktop, pushed open the door, and walked out.

He casually locked the door and walked through a corridor dotted with the diamond-shaped transoms common in the local area, crossed a small courtyard, and arrived at the main hall mentioned earlier.

From the outside, the Senate Computing and Data Center was a truss-structured building common in the Bairen City Industrial Zone. The towering wrought-iron frame was filled with locally fired red bricks, and the entire outer wall lacked any other decoration. At first glance, it looked very much like a large factory building belonging to the former Manufacturing Commission.

But if one observed carefully, they would discover many differences. On one side of the first floor, there were steps leading up and a wide gate leading directly to the second floor. The other three sides were almost entirely built of red bricks. Apart from a few narrow ventilation openings and two passages guarded by sentries, there were basically no windows. The second and third floors, however, were covered with large, bright glass windows. As evening approached, bright lights shone from within. If one looked closely, they could distinguish that this was not the slightly flickering yellow light of gas lamps, but the stable white light of electric lamps, which were rare even in Lingao.

If one had the chance to look down from above, they would also find rows of skylights for lighting and ventilation arranged on the sawtooth-shaped roof. Near the roof, instead of the transmission shafts common in factories, one could see crisscrossing wire tracks, giving the illusion that the hall was covered in spider webs, somewhat reminiscent of a modern art gallery in another timeline. coupled with its relatively conspicuous mass, this building, which had just been completed more than half a year ago and was still being expanded, often attracted passersby to stop and watch. In fact, many years later, this so-called "Sino-New" style, which mixed "modern architectural functional structure + plain brick walls + traditional style contours, proportions, and details," would become a representative architectural trend in the early days of the Austral-Song founding.

Although it was an internal passage and the guards knew him, entering the hall still required showing a pass to the guards. The Data and Computing Center was the Senate's "black technology" hub, containing too many secrets and equipment that was too precious and needed protection, so a system of passes with different colors and validity periods was adopted here. The color of the pass restricted the holder's access locations and the scope of business they could conduct.

Even Senators were not unimpeded in the Data Center. This system applied to everyone.

What Xu Laowu held was the highest-level pass of the Data Center. There were only a few such passes, all held by Senators working within the Data Center.

"Good day, Chief!" The guard behind the door opened the door leading to the main hall. As soon as Senator Xu walked in, a warm breeze mixed with the scent of ink, paper, a faint smell of cosmetics, and the smell of humans blew against his face. At the same time, the sounds of abacuses clicking one after another, the swishing sound of clips sliding on wires, and the low hum of ventilation fans rushed into his ears. Combined with the bright electric lights, Senator Xu often had the illusion of returning to the hall of an old-fashioned accounting firm in the original timeline. Walking a short distance, he arrived at the arcade in the middle of the third floor. Against the backdrop of the huge Star Fist National Emblem and the Morning Star Flag on the opposite wall, one could clearly see the two radial layouts presented by the iron wire spider web.

One end of the web connected to a service counter similar to the lobby of the Delong Bank. Messengers and clerks wearing grey naturalized citizen uniforms constantly climbed the stairs in front of the door, handing stacks of materials to the counter. The female clerks inside the counter, also wearing grey uniforms, would check and organize the materials, issue a receipt listing the type and number of pages, stamp it, and hand it back to the other party. Then she would label the materials, put them in a folder overhead, and with a gentle push, send it flying towards a certain area in the rear hall. With a "whoosh," the folder would fly to the vicinity of a high platform marked "Certain Reporting Group" and be quickly taken down. Around the platform were rows of Ikea-style wooden desks and chairs. The taken-down materials would be distributed by the group leader to the clerks at the desks for calculation, verification, and summarization into standardized data tables. Usually, after a burst of dense abacus sounds, the original materials sent over would be placed in a small cart on the side, waiting to be stored in the warehouse on the first floor, while the summarized pages of data tables would be put into another folder, once again pushed along the web-like tracks towards a counter at the rear of the hall. After checking the number and quantity, the female clerk at the counter would constantly pass through a door, sending the data tables into a glass-partitioned room behind her.

Senator Xu knew that in there lay the absolute divine artifacts of this timeline: dozens of computer terminals for input and the servers connected to them. Thanks to these divine artifacts, this was one of the few rooms in Lingao, and indeed this timeline, that possessed a ground-source heat pump air conditioning system. Even the input air had to undergo multi-stage filtration to reduce dust and other harmful components entering the room.

Those working inside were all female trainees he had trained single-handedly. Recalling how they looked when they first came for training, Senator Xu still felt like scratching his head. Training a bunch of illiterate ancient women who didn't speak the language to operate computers was practically the most difficult thing he had done in this world and the previous timeline combined. Many times, Senator Xu had the heart to beat a few of them to death with a rattan cane. For a period, the third-largest user of the standard rattan canes manufactured by the Wood Processing Factory was the Computing Center.

However, after exhausting Xu Laowu physically and mentally, making the trainee girls cry for their parents, and causing Feng Nuo to turn pale from repairing computers and installing systems day and night for several months, the traditional Chinese diligence and eagerness to learn seemed to finally take effect. After eliminating about two-thirds of the trainees, Xu Yicheng cultivated the first batch of operators who could basically operate independently.

This batch of operators could complete general data entry work quite proficiently. With them passing on their skills, things finally started to become a little simpler. But Senator Xu soon discovered that these girls would clutch something on their chests and chant mumbo-jumbo before taking their posts. One day, Senator Xu, unable to suppress his curiosity, semi-forcibly pulled this item out from one of their chests and found it was a small wooden pendant with a fox head painted on it. It turned out that the Senator who initially developed the data entry interface, wanting to save trouble, directly used the FoxPro fox head as the splash screen. Since then, the legend that Fox Immortals lived inside these shells had spread within the Senate Planning Agency's Data Center.

Facts proved that the power of these immortals was immense, which was fully demonstrated during the last Engine Operation. Population statistical analysis and material loss analysis, which historically took years or even decades to complete, were completed within a few weeks with the help of these divine artifacts. Not only could the leaders of relevant departments consult them in real-time on their computers, but even the Senate's "soy sauce" Senators could check quite detailed and specific data on the BBS. Although, judging from the sparse replies and low click counts, most of this data held little significance in the hearts of these Senators. But in the mouths of the Executive Committee and personnel of relevant bureaus, the Data and Computing Center had truly established its reputation. This was probably why this building could obtain funding for construction and be of such high standards.

However, Senator Xu knew that these powerful divine artifacts would eventually break down one day. Feng Nuo talked to him about this every day. Under the glamorous appearance was the trembling maintenance work—Xu Laowu never went to the server room. Firstly, he didn't really understand the technology inside, and secondly, it reduced disturbance to the servers. In that quiet, fully enclosed constant temperature and humidity machine room, the fewer people entering, the better.

This point was fully considered when this building was newly built. Before long, the input data tables would no longer be archived directly as they were now, but would be transferred to the adjacent hall currently under construction. There, a group of clerks would begin attempting manual aggregation and decomposition of data, conducting statistics directly by hand or via the planned future mechanical computers, submitting final reports, and synchronously updating several large data tables occupying several walls and the corresponding large demonstration sand tables.

This method had previously been used in the Planning Agency, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Now the Planning Agency had decided to promote it comprehensively, introducing it to the Computing Center to operate on a larger scale, to gradually fill the gap and replace the constantly declining computer systems. Feng Nuo's sparing no effort to promote the electromechanical computer system in the previous stage was actually because he also saw this trend.
