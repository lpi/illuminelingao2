# Chapter 1446 - Taking Trouble

The meeting between Cheng Yongxin and Salina far exceeded her expectations. Although making an appointment with this lady took her a lot of effort—Salina had great fame in the Council of Elders but low presence. Most of her working time was spent serving as a trainer in the bases of powerful departments, or drafting various regulations, ordinances, and law enforcement procedures for various powerful departments.

Cheng Yongxin didn't know Salina, nor did she even know where she was active usually. However, she had already gained Panpan's "friendship"—both Panpan and Salina were from the United States and were women, so they interacted a lot. Through Panpan's "introduction," she soon got to know Salina.

Salina's Mandarin was already spoken very fluently, but Cheng Yongxin still chatted with her in her excellent American English—she intuitively felt that regardless of whether it was Salina or Panpan, no matter how fluent their Chinese was, they would still have a natural intimacy with their mother tongue, and it was easier to directly express the thoughts in their minds: there are many people who can speak a foreign language fluently, but very few who can think in a foreign language.

Salina rarely met people willing to speak English with her normally. Even Panpan wouldn't converse with her in English in public—to avoid being misunderstood as discussing secrets.

Cheng Yongxin realized that in this political group where ethnic Chinese males dominated and most people had more or less Darwinistic socialist and chauvinistic tendencies, buying and selling slaves and driving slaves to work without hesitation, racial discrimination and gender discrimination were even displayed nakedly.

Although Salina held a high position now, had a seat as an "Elder," and was considered heavily reused in work, she was always an "outsider."

If Panpan was considered one of the Council of Elders' "own people" due to the existence of the "graft" Dingding, the couple relationship between Salina and the fellow "outsider" Xue Ziliang made it difficult for her to integrate into this group—although Xue Ziliang was ethnic Chinese, he was a thorough banana.

Salina had no power to resist this discrimination. Cheng Yongxin believed that to win over Salina, the first thing to show was "recognition" of her cultural background, not "friendliness" or "respect."

Sure enough, her small strategy succeeded: Salina felt like old friends at first sight with her, and they quickly established a friendship. Xue Ziliang had been on business trips very frequently in the last year, often gone for months—although he was full of vigor every time he came back, tossing about three or four times a night aside, doing it again early in the morning, making the neighbors all have red eyes and swollen eyelids—after all, it still made her life very lonely. The interaction between the two quickly became close.

Conversely, she promoted the relationship between Salina and Panpan. She carefully maintained this newborn girlfriend group, subtly spreading dissatisfaction with the Council of Elders' "male chauvinism" and "dictatorial totalitarian tendencies"—she believed her two new girlfriends also had similar thoughts, and she just needed to act as a catalyst.

Today's date could be said to make her feel "blessed by the gods." First, she met Su Wan and knew that this female forensic doctor in the powerful institutions had similar dissatisfaction with the Council of Elders as herself. In other words, there was a possibility of becoming a "fellow traveler" or even an "ally." Second, as a forensic doctor, she held first-hand information on the murder case of Lin Xiaoya, which made Panpan extremely dissatisfied. Judging from Dingding's eagerness to withdraw the report on this case, there was something fishy about it. What was finally released was likely not the truth.

The truth must be in the hands of this Forensic Doctor Su—forensics are people who can make the dead speak. If she could win her over, it meant she could master the first-hand truth. Then she could use this "truth" in the most advantageous way according to the development of the situation.

It was just that the smell of raw garlic and onions eaten by this Doctor Su was a bit hard for her to endure, and the smell of disinfectant on her always caused strong unpleasant associations. So much so that on the way home, she still felt she could smell it.

Back in the dormitory, Cheng Yongxin hurriedly took a shower and changed clothes, then sprayed some perfume, before feeling better.

Unpleasantness aside, the contact with Su Wan still benefited her greatly—out of prudence, she did not ask anything about the Lin Xiaoya case to avoid arousing suspicion. However, from Su Wan's sudden emotional outburst today and subsequent conversation, she guessed there must be some inside story to this case.

Must win her over as soon as possible, let her tell the inside story of this case voluntarily—there are no secrets between women. Must do it even if she is annoying. Isn't my source of power women?

Sun Shangxiang made dinner—regardless of Cheng Yongxin's complaints about the Maid School, the teaching results were undeniable. Not to mention the food was a hundred times better than what she cooked, the variety was also much richer.

The two ate together. Eating at the same table with the master made Sun Shangxiang very nervous at first. She didn't even dare to pick up food. After several days like this, and learning from other maids that it was the same in other Elders' homes, she slowly adapted.

They chatted casually at the dinner table, especially about reading. Cheng Yongxin intentionally guided her to read some books, asking her to come and ask if she didn't understand anything. Besides this "teaching," she also inquired about things in the Maid School, especially Sun Shangxiang's classmates, what they were thinking.

"What do you do at home normally?" Cheng Yongxin asked casually while eating.

Sun Shangxiang stopped her chopsticks nervously: "Buying groceries... cleaning... cooking... and reading books as you instructed..."

"You don't need to stay at home doing housework all the time; I don't have that much housework here." Cheng Yongxin said, "Move around more with maids from other Elders' homes, make friends. Also, get close to your classmates from the Maid School, don't forget them."

"Yes—" Sun Shangxiang didn't understand what the master meant, but dared not ask, so she agreed vaguely first.

"Be generous when spending outside, don't be too stingy." Cheng Yongxin took out a newly issued "Elder Supplementary Card" from Delong Bank. This card was similar to the supplementary membership card of the Farm, derived from the Elder's main card, specifically for maids' consumption. It was actually a debit card. It could be used to pay directly for small daily expenses in all shops in Lingao. A certain amount of cash could also be withdrawn from Delong counters, the limit set by the Elder.

"When you maids have free time, have a meal together, drink tea or something. If you need to spend cash, withdraw it from the account. You are my person, keep up appearances."

Sun Shangxiang went back to her new room to organize, while Cheng Yongxin took a glass of iced black tea into the study.

"Zheng Zhilong finally collapsed... he lasted long enough."

Taking out the black booklet recently concocted by the Office of Truth, this was the "translation" work assigned to her—polishing modern Chinese articles in simplified horizontal layout into traditional vertical layout ancient vernacular that could be directly copied by scholars. If everything went smoothly, a certain paragraph produced on this desk would be spat out from the mouths of storytellers in the capital half a month later.

Judging from this black material, the next target of the Council of Elders seemed to be Guangdong. Cheng Yongxin noticed that the proportion of Guangzhou local officials in the black materials she handled recently showed a significant increasing trend. According to the Executive Committee's consistent style, this was the rhythm of making a move on Guangdong.

She put down the black material in her hand and took off the necklace from her neck. Hanging on the necklace was an excellent Han jade cicada pendant—she bought it at the spoils auction. With her limited knowledge, this piece of jade would attain a price of at least tens of thousands of RMB in the other time-space. On the back of the pendant hung a small copper key.

Removing the copper key, she opened the wooden door of the bookcase. Inside was an iron safe made in Lingao. She opened the safe, took out a locally made red-covered notebook, and began to write in it.

She carefully recorded the materials she considered valuable from the meeting with Salina and Su Wan today.

Since having the ambition to be a screenwriter, Cheng Yongxin had the habit of accumulating material. Before D-Day, she quietly recorded a lot of what she saw and heard in the training camp. In fact, in this safe, there were still records of the daily activities of transmigrators she made at the time and the screenplay outline of *Space-Time Pioneers (Tentative)* she wrote.

Since she no longer prepared to muddle along content with the status quo in the Great Library, she began to consciously record materials that "might be useful." Quite a lot of material had already accumulated in her red notebook.

Although many things weren't secrets, after time passed, they became past events the parties involved were unwilling to mention again. They hoped these things would be forgotten. By then, these materials that weren't secrets would have sufficient effect.

Locking the safe, she began to work. She was completely immersed in her work, and only realized the clock had passed midnight when she finished. Closing the fountain pen, Cheng Yongxin got up thinking of boiling black tea in the kitchen, but found Sun Shangxiang, who should have gone to bed, quietly cleaning her kitchen.

"Shangxiang? Why aren't you asleep?"

The girl bounced up immediately, bowing slightly to her with standard posture.

"Chief, you were still working. I was afraid you might need some snacks at night, so I kept the tea warm."

Cheng Yongxin noticed Sun Shangxiang's expression was a bit distorted—obviously trying hard to hold back a yawn.

"Then pour me a cup of tea. By the way, call the *Lingao Times* tomorrow morning and help me make an appointment for lunch with Chief Panpan."

"Yes, Chief."

Cheng Yongxin looked at the life secretary in front of her and suddenly sighed heavily. Even though she had many complaints about the Qing Dynasty, she still hoped there were a few more Empress Dowager Xiaozhuangs.
