# Chapter 1278: Tiandihui's Ambition

Currently, the entire island of Hainan was under the jurisdiction of the Senate, and the volume of land infrastructure construction required for agricultural development was extremely large. Although various free labor forces were widely used now: from Southeast Asian slaves, prisoners, immigrants, to "compulsory workers" conscripted, and even the army was mobilized to participate in labor, these people still needed tools, food, drink, and clothing. Besides labor costs, there was also a massive input of materials.

The development of several enterprises directly under the Agricultural Committee was also very booming. The working capital required was immense. Especially since the launch of the Engine Plan, the Agricultural Committee had also undertaken the settlement work of a large number of immigrants.

Although the Planning Commission's investment in agriculture was also increasing, compared to the currently soaring industrial capital construction investment and the huge military expenses, immigration fees, and administrative expenses, the investment and demand growth obtained by the remaining departments were already disproportionate. Many departments felt the shortage of funds.

When money wasn't enough, increasing income and reducing expenditure was the main method. However, under the command of the Planning Commission, the current Senate had reached a point where expenditure reduction could no longer be reduced—there were voids everywhere at present, and there were no places where resources could truly be saved. Ultimately, income had to be increased.

Besides trade and plundering through war, many Senators turned their eyes to the interior of the ruled area.

The resources obtained through means of "fighting bandits and raiding local tyrants" during bandit suppression and land measurement had now been almost consumed, and it was impossible to repeat similar methods. Regarding taxation: currently, the tax system was not yet perfect, and the economic census work had not been carried out, so levying new taxes was too hasty.

The only way was to use their brains on private capital in the ruled area. Lingao, including the entire Qiongzhou, had seen rapid development of private capital in recent years driven by the Senate's policies of stimulating the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Not only had a group of "nouveaux riches" emerged, but a considerable number of "middle-class families" had also appeared. The capital in the hands of these two groups combined was a considerable amount. They had a demand for investment and value preservation of their capital. However, the investment channels that the financial sector could provide were currently very limited, roughly only savings.

Naturalized citizens and indigenous commoners all knew that the "Australian Chiefs" had the ability to "turn stone into gold" and could make big money in whatever they did. Many big households had thoughts of trying to buy shares in the Senate's enterprises, but so far, an exception had only been made for the Grand World project in Guangzhou. In Lingao, on the contrary, only a few big households enjoyed such benefits.

Wu Nanhai felt that since the society had such a demand, and the Planning Commission's investment was not in place, there was no need to rely solely on state investment. Absorbing and utilizing private capital was a matter of killing multiple birds with one stone.

Under the current national policy based on an overall planned economy and dominated by the state-owned economy, completely opening up private equity investment was unlikely. Moreover, many Senators in the Senate detested stock markets, this kind of "deceptive ghostly thing", and could not tolerate state-owned enterprises being "tainted" by "private capital". Any proposal to open up equity investment in state-owned enterprises would be denounced as a "feast for carving up the Senate's property", and "The Senate is doomed (drug pill)" would be posted on the spot.

So Wu Nanhai only launched the plan of absorbing private capital through bonds and placing a small amount of equity capital without involving enterprise management rights and ownership. This could significantly reduce the antagonistic sentiment of the "Doomed Party" and also play the role of absorbing private capital.

In order to increase the success rate of passing in the Senate, Wu Nanhai had been negotiating with several Senators from the financial sector at the Farm Teahouse for a week and was gradually perfecting the plan. According to the Senate's rules of procedure, a proposal submitted by a Senator required at least 5% of Senators to second it to enter the procedural process. Through activities, he had already gathered enough co-signing Senators from the Agricultural Committee and the financial sector. The current main task was to try to win over more Senators to vote in support of this proposal.

Last week, the Flying Cloud Club held a party in the cafe rented in the podium of the teahouse. Nanhai specifically communicated with the Qian brothers, had private conversations with some people from the Ministry of Forestry, and frequently communicated by letter with directors of county offices stationed in various counties. Currently, he was confident that this proposal would be passed by a simple majority opinion when the Senate voted.

The finance and economics sector was most interested in this plan: after all, the current financial industry had almost no business to speak of other than insurance and bank deposits and loans. If issuing bonds and raising shares for state-owned enterprises were launched as a "national policy", there would be much more financial business to conduct below. Thus, both sides hit it off immediately.

The draft plan proposed by the finance and economics sector was that the Agricultural Committee would serve as a pilot, and Delong Bank would be responsible for issuing government agricultural bonds for specific uses. The proceeds from the bond issuance would be used as additional appropriation by the Agricultural Committee for specific purposes—specific project audits would still be the responsibility of the Planning Commission. As for issuing stocks, Wu Nanhai originally intended to reorganize several subordinate enterprises into limited liability companies, but the finance and economics sector suggested that it was best not to use enterprises under the Agricultural Committee for restructuring—this would face great pressure to pass in the Senate. It would be more appropriate for the Agricultural Committee to fund the establishment of a limited liability company specifically to raise funds.

"...Actually, it is more appropriate to reorganize the Tiandihui association organization under the Agricultural Committee into a joint-stock company." Wu Di said, "Firstly, this organization itself is engaged in commercial activities—service industry is also a commercial activity; secondly, Tiandihui's reputation is very loud in Lingao, and using it to raise share capital has high attractiveness."

"That's right. I originally intended to make Tiandihui big. It's too pity to just treat it as a social organization similar to agricultural cooperatives now."

"No, the nature of Tiandihui as a social group for agricultural cooperatives cannot be changed," Wu Di said, "You can just establish a limited liability company under Tiandihui with Tiandihui as the major shareholder."

"Then how about I set up a Tiandihui Foundation?"

"That's too far-sighted." Wu Di smiled and said, "Take it slowly."

Wu Nanhai and several Senators from the finance and economics sector had already discussed detailed issues many times. Now he was concerned about roughly when it could be implemented to get enough money.

"I'm afraid it won't be very early." Chen Ce, Director of the Planning Division of Delong Bank, said, "You know that the most important thing for the financial sector in 1633 is to carry out currency reform. Without completing the currency reform, it is unlikely to have such big moves in finance—when the currency unit changes, how will the previous bonds and stocks be calculated?"

"Didn't Guangzhou already issue bonds and stocks for the Grand World?"

"That was calculated in silver. If securities are issued again now, they must be calculated in circulation coupons—what the final new circulation coupons will look like has not been formally proposed yet."

"Like this," Wu Nanhai was somewhat disappointed, "I was counting on expanding production after getting the money."

The group from the finance and economics sector ate and drank their fill, then lifted their butts and left one after another—naturally, Wu Nanhai paid the bill. He asked the waiter on duty to clean up the private room, set up a Gongfu tea set, brewed "Limushan Oolong Tea", and waited for Ye Yuming while drinking alone.

After Ye Yuming arrived, Wu Nanhai immediately talked to him about Tiandihui's share raising issue—the first step was naturally the work of Tiandihui opening commercial enterprises. He originally intended to do this even without raising shares. Great business opportunities couldn't all be taken by the Ministry of Commerce while his own side stared blankly.

In Wu Nanhai's calculation, Tiandihui would be the "tertiary industry" department of the Agricultural Committee in the future. Currently, sideline enterprises under the control of the Agricultural Committee would be gradually centralized into this system. At the same time, this department would also operate new tertiary industry projects itself.

Specifically, Tiandihui would come forward to establish Tiandihui Holdings Limited Liability Company and raise shares from the public.

As the Chief Helmsman of Tiandihui, Ye Yuming had long been unwilling to be lonely. He hit it off with Wu Nanhai's proposal and also proposed trying to recover all fishing rights.

"We have already organized fishing cooperatives and controlled a large part of fishing rights. Regarding the Fishery General Brigade, the Navy won't let go for a while. We can create public opinion first—the Navy's setup is getting bigger and bigger, and they gradually look down on those broken boats." Ye Yuming said.

"Yes, it's a pity that the Fishery Administration Fleet is hopeless." Wu Nanhai wrung his hands.

The two looked at each other in silence for a moment. Ye Yuming took out a memorandum from his pocket:

"This is the summary of institutional organization I made for the next development of Tiandihui."

The document envisioned the organizational structure of Tiandihui. Besides the General Association Heaven Department, existing businesses were all split into different halls for management. The most important were five halls.

Heyi Hall: Organizing agricultural cooperative affairs for small and medium owner-peasants;

Jujing Hall: Responsible for fishery cooperative affairs;

Mengshan Hall: All agricultural technology and agricultural science service affairs;

Fengze Hall: Management of land contracted by Tiandihui;

Xingwang Hall: Micro-loan promotion service business for livestock and poultry breeding.

"These halls, except for Heyi Hall and Jujing Hall, can all establish professional companies," Ye Yuming said excitedly. "If the Senate can loosen the opening a bit more, we can even start an agricultural bank or something, at least an agricultural credit union—the Japanese agricultural cooperatives all have credit unions..."

"This matter will be discussed later. Don't mention the Agricultural Bank outside either; the gang at Wudaokou is very shrewd..." Wu Nanhai whispered.

Ye Yuming became alert: "You are right." He shook his head again with some regret, "It's a pity we can't get the Fishery General Brigade back, otherwise we could directly establish a fishery company!"

"I have no objection to your Tiandihui reorganization plan, it's just that there aren't so many people to set up the framework for you in a short while. Make do for now." Wu Nanhai said, "I want to talk to you about micro-commerce first. I plan to operate it under the framework of Tiandihui's commercial company too. Setup a specialized company."

"Micro-commerce?"

"Yes, like breakfast stalls, cold drink stalls, and the like."

"Isn't this business for individual households?" Ye Yuming didn't understand the meaning, "We don't need to hire a group of people specifically to do this..."
