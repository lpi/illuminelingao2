# Chapter 48: The Night Before

*[Author's note: This makes up for yesterday's chapter. Another chapter tonight.]*

---

The twilight sky was a serene hazy gold. Distant clouds on the horizon were edged with faint gold trim. An evening sea breeze blew gently as the *Fengcheng* steamed steadily on. The weather in the Qiongzhou Strait was excellent—waves under 1.5 meters. Even those with little sailing experience felt no seasickness.

The great bow cut through the waves, riding wind and water. The transmigrators posing as backpackers stood or sat in small groups on deck, gazing at the scenery on both sides of the strait. The Qiongzhou Strait was a very narrow waterway—from the ship, they could see both the Leizhou Peninsula's northern coast and Hainan Island's southern shore.

Less than 20 cables off the ship's beam, a squat flat-deck barge followed close behind, its deck loaded with containers and various vehicles and machinery. Both vessels maintained 10 knots. They were scheduled to rendezvous at 6:00 PM Beijing time with four fishing boats departing from another port.

After Meng De's half-month of running around, the complex loading process was finally complete. Coastal freighters routinely carried everything, so the port authority wasn't surprised. The only puzzled party was the fuel company—both ships had taken only diesel, not cheap marine heavy oil.

The hired crew were Filipinos. Their peculiar English was incomprehensible to everyone except Meng De, who regularly worked around ports. The advantage: they didn't care what the ship carried or why so many backpackers in green training uniforms had come aboard—two-thirds of the transmigrators were concentrated on this ship. Only a few specialists were assigned to other vessels.

The entire freighter actually left little space for transmigrators. All five cargo holds were full; even the deck had containers lashed down. Several livestock containers constantly emitted foul smells. Except for women and children who got crew cabins, most people could only sit on deck, awaiting the fated moment.

Fortunately, everyone was still in that excited state of pioneering a new era and didn't feel too inconvenienced. Some hadn't slept well the night before and were now spreading sleeping bags on deck to catch up. Others stood facing the wind, gazing at Hainan Island's coastline appearing and disappearing in the haze. They'd been born in this timespace, grown up here, and would have grown old here. Countless loves and hates, disappointments and satisfactions, countless firsts of life—they were about to leave and never return, a parting as eternal as death.

The Executive Committee members standing on the poop deck had no such leisure for historical-moment sentimentality. According to plan, the fishing boats and landing craft departing from the fishing port, plus the legendary North American Branch's yacht, should rendezvous with them at 5:00 PM. They kept scanning the sea with binoculars, seeing only scattered fishing boats returning to port.

The North American Branch's yacht arrived first, ten minutes early. Its blue-and-white hull carried snow-white triangular sails, gliding elegantly across the water. This drew cheers and whistles from the transmigrators. Through the Committee's binoculars, they could see Shi Niaoren waving on deck. From the hatchway below the sails emerged a foreign woman with large eyes and a puzzled expression—obviously she didn't understand what was happening.

"Nice figure on that girl." Wang Luobin murmured, binoculars raised.

"Chestnut hair—not a Western mare."

"What do you know? She's Latina. You don't have to be blonde and blue-eyed to count."

A dozen binoculars trained on the newly appeared beauty, completely ignoring the entire North American male contingent waving on deck.

The fishing boats and landing craft still hadn't appeared. Fortunately, radio contact was maintained. The four fishing boats, responsible for towing multiple large floating rafts—a task no one had done before—had wasted several hours just adjusting towline lengths. Finally, twenty minutes past 5:00 PM, they rendezvoused with the waiting ships.

This strange fleet proceeded slowly along Hainan Island's coastline. Bopu Port was nearly in sight. As night approached, the harbor lights were already visible, flickering. Ships on the route had lit their navigation lights.

"GPS shows we're currently 3 nautical miles north-northeast of Bopu Port."

"Reduce speed! Turn on all lights!"

"Take control of the ship!"

"All vessels close on the flagship!"

"Prepare the wormhole!"

With each command, Meng De first gathered all crew on deck in his capacity as charterer. Then the Military Group members produced their five-shot shotguns. Without a word of argument, the twenty-odd crew very cooperatively descended into a lifeboat specially prepared for them and rowed toward shore.

Now all ship lights were on. The freighter's searchlights turned the deck brilliant white. Realizing the historic moment was at hand, transmigrators all stood up, eyes wide, watching the poop deck.

The PA system crackled with test sounds, then an excessively high-pitched male voice:

"Attention, five-minute crossing preparation! All personnel don life vests and enter cabins!"

Anticipating that the wormhole might oscillate from violent energy fluctuations during crossing, and to prevent anyone falling overboard, all except essential deck personnel (secured by safety lines) crowded into the cabins. The watertight doors were sealed.

"Director Wen, let's begin!" Meng De stood tensely at the helm.

"Alright. Begin."

As the wormhole suspended at the bow was slowly pushed open by the ship's prow, this enormous mirror-like surface flashed with unprecedented brilliance, illuminating a large expanse of surrounding sea. The wormhole's edges radiated energy like fireworks.

"Hold steady," Wen Desi muttered, silently praying this thing wouldn't suddenly explode. Failing to reach another timespace would be one thing—but an energy explosion might rival an atomic bomb.

"All ships, attention!" Meng De shouted. "Close up spacing! Full speed through the wormhole! All hands brace for impact!"

The transmigrators in the cabins didn't know what was happening outside. Everyone gripped fixed objects with serious expressions, waiting for the legendary crossing shockwave. Suddenly, lights flickered wildly. Everyone's faces and hands felt mildly electrified, slightly numb. A strange wave of dizziness surged up.

"We crossed!" someone shouted.

No one responded. Many had closed their eyes the instant the lights flickered.

Shortly after the rear-guard fishing boat passed through, the wormhole passage—which had been reflecting the freighter's lights like a mirror—suddenly began glowing. In seconds, it expanded from a plane into a sphere of blinding light, then... vanished! Seawater rushed back into the 50-meter-diameter void the wormhole had left. The colliding water shot 10+ meters into the air with a sound like a giant drum. The rear-guard fishing boat, 100+ meters from the wormhole, took a brutal wash from 4–5-meter waves. Fortunately, preparations were thorough—no losses.

"All ships, report status!" Meng De called on the radio.

"Barge, normal!"

"Landing craft, normal!"

"Fishing 1, normal!"

"Fishing 2, normal!"

"Fishing 3, normal!"

"Fishing 4, normal!"

"North America, normal... ah, there's a motorboat rapidly approaching our vessel!"

The Committee members' hearts sank. Motorboat—where would a motorboat come from in the seventeenth century?

Before Wen Desi could speak, Xi Yazhou was already on the radio calling Zhao De, the fishing-boat flotilla leader.

"Old Zhao, take your people to support the North America boat immediately."

"Understood!"

The *Fengcheng* then switched on two large searchlights, their brilliant beams illuminating the now-darkened sea. Two boats from Zhao De's fishing flotilla broke formation, bows cutting through waves, flanking the sailboat from north and south at full speed.

The lights illuminated the entire area. Through binoculars, Wen Desi saw the motorboat approaching the North American sailboat—just a small 8-passenger marine speedboat. Had they crossed too, or had the transmigrators failed to cross at all?

He glanced at those beside him. Every Committee member wore a grim expression—clearly thinking the same thing.

The Committee members were almost all over thirty, each priding themselves on composure forged through years of social experience. But now even they were losing their calm. The wormhole was gone. If they hadn't crossed, it would be a disaster.

Meng De frantically scanned the surroundings with binoculars. No moon visible on the water. Pitch black everywhere except for the *Fengcheng*-centered area blazing with lights, which made the surrounding darkness seem bottomless.

"We should have made it," he muttered to himself. Something occurred to him, and he hurried to check the equipment.

"GPS has no signal!" he cried.

This reminded others. Several people pulled out phones—"Searching for signal"—in the Qiongzhou Strait, cell coverage should be normal.

Every radio frequency was blank—only the hiss of static.

"Success!" The Committee members threw composure aside and cheered.

Since this was the seventeenth century, whoever was on that motorboat was irrelevant.

Zhao De's voice came over the radio: "Ship secured. Four prisoners. Appear to be tourists."

"Bring them all to the flagship."

The night was still long. Approaching the coast in darkness was clearly risky. The Committee decided all ships would anchor in place and wait for dawn before landing. This was the seventeenth century—no vessel could damage theirs. For safety, all ships turned on their main lights, illuminating the surroundings. Military Group personnel had already opened a crate of firearms from the North American sailboat and distributed them to each vessel. Now they had weapons and manpower—nothing to fear.

"Damn it, what are you doing! Bandits! Pirates! Hooligans! Thugs!" As Xiao Zishan opened the door, he heard an old man's vigorous shouting.

"Dad, stop yelling—let's talk this out..." Another male voice tried to calm him.

"This is the Qiongzhou Strait, not the Red Sea or Somalia! The People's Navy isn't vegetarian!"

"Gentlemen, please, let's discuss reasonably. We're ordinary citizens, not rich people—just a family visiting Hainan..." This was a middle-aged woman's voice.

Xiao Zishan instinctively tugged his collar and straightened his cap—he wasn't used to wearing uniforms. He pushed open the cabin door and entered.

The situation was quickly clarified. The four people on the motorboat were a family: an elderly couple and their son and daughter-in-law. They'd come to Hainan for tourism. The old man had served in the navy for many years and knew all the units around Hainan. Crossing the strait, they hadn't bought ferry tickets—he'd borrowed an old speedboat from an old military buddy, wanting to relive his seafaring memories. Unexpectedly, near Bopu Port, they'd encountered a strange storm. When it subsided, everything was pitch dark, and they'd spotted the nearby ships. Approaching the sailboat was purely to ask for directions—the speedboat had no navigation equipment except a compass. Then they'd been inexplicably captured by people from two fishing boats.

"Please rest for now." Xiao Zishan maintained his smile. "It's dark outside. We'll talk when it's light." He thought: *How could he possibly explain this? They'd think I escaped from a mental hospital.*

"You'll let us ashore at dawn?" asked the son, who looked like a civil servant. Xiao Zishan noticed he kept glancing at his attractive wife throughout the conversation.

"Sir, we really are just ordinary people. What's the point of holding us?" The old lady was explaining again. Despite the sudden situation and several fierce-looking men with five-shot shotguns present, she remained composed, speaking clearly and without panic—clearly someone accustomed to handling situations.

"Look, let me be frank. My husband here used to be in the navy right here. My daughter-in-law is in law enforcement. Maritime, coast guard, customs, fishery enforcement, plus the navy—this strait is constantly patrolled. Does this make sense? We're just ordinary people. We don't want to be heroes. Once we're off the ship, we go our separate ways. Consider our belongings lost..."

The old lady's words were soft yet firm. Impressive. Much better than the son and daughter-in-law. Xiao Zishan nodded politely and said:

"Everything can wait until tomorrow." He stood up. "You'll see—this is a new world!"
