# Chapter 2680: The Capital (Part 32)

Wang Yehao unfolded the paper strip sent by Wang Liang—it was the secret report sent back by Liu Zhao from Guangzhou: departure for the return to the capital was set for the third of this month. Practicaly, the heart that had been suspended for more than three months was finally put down. In the previous planning, what Wang Yehao was most unsure of was exactly how powerful the Hearthstone Immortal's ability of foreknowledge was. If he really had the ability to foresee the future, this calculation might be known by the other party, and the matter of recruitment would fall through.

Wang Yehao recalled the Hearthstone Immortal's way of acting and always felt it was vaguely strange. Although he could always predict the direction of the court situation correctly, he seemed to have no supernatural power regarding other matters. Whether it was being caught practicing medicine in Guangzhou Prefecture, being assassinated in the Yangzhou brothel, or failing to find the Universe Mirror, all signs indicated that the Immortal's predictive ability had great limitations. Therefore, Wang Yehao had a bold guess: this person might only be able to interpret matters in the Book of Life and Death, and knew nothing about the rest.

At the beginning of the year, Wang Yehao sent out the news. The first layer was to make him return as soon as possible; the second was to take the opportunity to test. He informed him that a maid was pregnant, while secretly letting Liu Zhao watch his reaction. According to the news sent back by Liu Zhao, Mr. Zhou seemed not to suspect anything and immediately urged for the return journey. Wang Yehao pondered for a while and decided to continue the next step of the plan.

After Liu Sha settled the two maids, he received no new instructions. Except for sending some rice, flour, vegetables, meat, and money every month according to orders, he didn't ask further—there were special personnel responsible for the guarding and care now. Although there was temporarily no mission, the monthly silver from the Wang family was not short, calculating to be even richer than before. So Liu Sha was happy to be at leisure, continuing to sell divination and read faces in the capital, secretly inquiring about various news.

Liu Sha usually rented and lived in the Dongyue Temple. In his early years, he also had a family, but unfortunately, his wife and son both caught a malignant disease a few years ago and passed away one after another within a few days. Liu Sha felt it might be that his trade damaged hidden virtues and was unfavorable to the family home. Having worked in this trade for a long time, he also took the family line lightly, so he didn't have the thought of marrying and having children again, living a life where one person eating full meant the whole family not hungry.

On this day after getting up, he was packing things preparing to set up the stall. Wang Liang suddenly came finding him, saying the Master wanted to go for an outing tomorrow, and also said it might rain tomorrow, asking him to bring rain gear.

Saying it was an outing, it was actually going to the place where the maids lived. This was their agreed secret code.

The second day, Wang Yehao disguised himself, took a small sedan chair carried by two bearers, brought only a few trusted servants and an empty sedan chair, and under Liu Sha's accompaniment, came to the residence of the two maids.

The residence was near Xuanwumen, not far from the Wanggongchang which exploded two years ago. When the explosion happened, households in this area suffered severe damage. Many houses collapsed. Just according to official statistics, "more than ten thousand nine hundred and thirty rooms collapsed, crushing to death five hundred and thirty-seven men and women." As for damaged houses, they were countless.

At this time, it was not more than two years since the explosion. The markets here hadn't recovered yet, and ruins still remained by the streets. Whether officials, gentry, or commoners, generally felt this place was unlucky. Those with some wealth mostly moved away from here, so the popularity was low and the location desolate. When Liu Sha was ordered to take over this courtyard, he considered picked up a bargain. The residence wasn't big, totaling only two entrances front and back. Besides Jieyi and Zhiling living there, there were four servants ordered to "care for" them here, so it appeared empty.

The two maids had been bored in the new house for more than three months. Finally seeing the Master coming, they hurriedly came forward to pay respects. Wang Yehao ordered them to close the main gate first, then come to the inner court to serve.

After closing the door and bolting it, Zhiling asked Jieyi in a small voice filled with apprehension: "Sister Jieyi, Master Wang wouldn't be coming to take us, right? Do you think we still follow Mr. Zhou?"

"Don't talk nonsense. We servants just do whatever the Master says." Jieyi didn't hold much hope for Mr. Zhou's return either. However, the Master might not necessarily take them into his room; it was more likely he would just transfer and gift them to someone else.

"You say Mr. Zhou hasn't had news for half a year; has he forgotten us long ago? I see the Master checking fate and buying a house before; maybe he really wants to take us." Zhiling spoke more and more excitedly along the way, her small face blushing red.

Entering the room, seeing the Master sitting upright in the center, the two hurriedly bowed. Wang Yehao let the two rise with a face calm as an ancient well, then asked Jieyi as if chatting about domestic trivia: "Are you used to living here?"

"Reporting to the Master, this slave is used to it." Jieyi answered with her head down.

"And you?" Wang Yehao smiled and asked Zhiling again.

"Reporting to the Master, food and lodging are all good, just a bit desolate. It's hard to even find a neighbor here; only Nanny Chen can still exchange a few words."

"Oh? Who is this Nanny Chen?" Wang Yehao asked with interest.

"She is an old widow from the front street. Her daughter married, and she usually lives alone, occasionally coming to chat idly."

"Hehe, are there other neighbors here?"

"No more, even Nanny Chen doesn't come often..."

Liu Sha didn't wait for Zhiling to finish speaking, coughed once, and scolded Jieyi: "How did you serve Mr. Zhou before? The Master is here, and you don't even prepare tea?!"

Jieyi hurriedly said: "The water was just put on to boil; this slave goes to urge it right away!" After speaking, she quickly withdrew out of the room to check if the water on the wind stove boiled, leaving Zhiling, who hadn't finished speaking, in the room. Seeing Jieyi sent away, Zhiling felt even more that the Master was interested in her, continuing to chatter about some market gossip intermittently, lifting her head from time to time to steal a few glances at Wang Yehao's reaction.

Wang Yehao listened to Zhiling's report patiently for a while, then turned to Liu Sha guarding aside and said: "Does the Teacher still remember the matter of selecting people before?"

Liu Sha cupped his hands in response: "Remember."

"Handle it now."

Hearing this, Liu Sha was stunned first, then understood. He took out a pill from his bosom and said to Zhiling with a smile: "Miss, Poor Daoist saw your complexion was poor earlier, fearing hidden illness, so we specially settled you here to recuperate. Today prepared a Golden Phoenix Pill, which can solidify the foundation and cultivate the origin, nourish Yin and tonify Yang."

Zhiling took the pill with a heart full of joy and asked: "Sister Jieyi doesn't get one?"

Liu Sha said with a kind face: "You just take it; she doesn't have this fortune."

Seeing Wang Yehao also nodded slightly, Zhiling's brain was left with only thoughts of inviting favor. Where would she harbor half a doubt? Not waiting for tea water, she swallowed the pill in one gulp. Within a moment, she felt dizzy and short of breath. Before she could shout once, she collapsed to the ground. At this time, Jieyi happened to push the door in with prepared tea and snacks. Seeing this scene, she stood wooden on the spot, overwhelmed. Liu Sha was alert, rushing forward in two steps, supporting Jieyi, and covering her mouth and nose. Jieyi only felt a burst of strange fragrance, then her neck was hit heavily, and subsequently, her whole body went soft and lost strength.

"I have already taken one soul and one spirit [*Hun* and *Po*] from you. Advise you not to struggle, to avoid suffering." Liu Sha placed Jieyi diagonally on the chair, then warned.

"Don't be afraid. This Official actually has a matter of wealth and honor to discuss with you." Seeing Jieyi controlled, Wang Yehao began to sing the red face [good cop]. "If you act according to this Official's plan, I guarantee you worry-free food and clothing, glory and wealth."

Although Jieyi was weak all over, her mind was still clear. Seeing Zhiling collapsed on the ground obviously lifeless, where would she have the guts to disobey? Trembling, she said: "This slave relies entirely on the Master's orders."

"Good." Wang Yehao stroked his beard and whiskers, continuing: "This time Zhiling died of difficult childbirth, but left a baby girl. Handed to you to raise, you must care for her well. Remember?"

"This slave remembers." Jieyi answered weakly.

"When Mr. Zhou returns, speak according to this. In the future, if you have a son, this girl is not a concern; this Official will help you become the Main Wife." Wang Yehao's face sank immediately, pointing viciously at Zhiling on the ground and continuing, "If you are long-tongued like her, go to the Underworld to keep her company."

"This slave dares not speak too much."

Wang Yehao stared at Jieyi for a while, then nodded to Liu Sha. Liu Sha recited a spell to Jieyi unhurriedly, then said: "This spell method limits you for half an hour, after which your hands and feet will return to normal. However, your soul and spirit will remain with the Poor Daoist for now as a thought."

"Beg the Master to spare this slave." Jieyi begged for mercy with a crying tone.

"Just do as told; this Official naturally won't harm you." Wang Yehao said to Jieyi unquestionably, then instructed Liu Sha, "In a few days when the child is sent, I will send wet nurses and servants to serve. Clean up this place. Remember to make Nanny Chen shut up."

Liu Sha agreed to the items one by one. Immediately, he stuffed Zhiling into the sedan chair and instructed the bearers to carry her back to the residence quietly. After half an hour, seeing Jieyi had recovered, he left quietly.

The next day, Liu Sha didn't set up the stall. After going out, he went straight south out of the city.

Outside Yongdingmen, refugees fleeing the spring famine from all directions gathered in crowds in front of the porridge factories set up by the government and benevolent bureaus. Liu Sha threaded through the crowd familiarly. After passing through the crowd, he crossed a desolate public graveyard until he stopped in front of a dilapidated small temple. A beggar lying against the wall base sunbathing recognized Liu Sha and quickly got up to welcome him: "Yo, Liu Mutou, haven't seen you for days. Why come today?"

"Hehe, what else can I be here for? Is Wu Hai in?"

"Picking stones inside." The beggar led Liu Sha into the door.

Liu Sha bypassed the main hall to the backyard. A man about thirty was fiddling with several delirious young children, occasionally drawing some marks on their limbs and faces. Seeing Liu Sha enter, the man didn't stop the work in his hands, only nodding to greet, continuing to hum and sing: "Harvesting from famine years, cutting fortune and longevity..."

"Wu Hai, any new goods?" Liu Sha stepped forward and asked.

"All here. What kind do you want?"

"Want a baby girl, cleaner. Four or five months old." Liu Zhao started picking as he spoke, seeming not to find suitable ones.

"Yo, which Master wants to refine medicine guide this time?" Wu Hai rubbed his hands with a smile. "There happens to be a pair of brother and sister in the back. Go take a look."
