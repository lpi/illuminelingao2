# Chapter 1200 - Boarding

"Damn, how do the Spaniards store gunpowder? Hurry up and put out the fire, you idiots, put some effort into it!" Lü Yang cursed involuntarily.

"This can't go on. The cannons are silenced quite a bit, but if there's a fire or explosion, it's over. And if we punch a few more holes below the waterline, are we going to fish for silver on the seabed?"

"Cease fire! Formation turn left 180 degrees in sequence, boarding team ready!" Lin Chuanqing ordered while praying the Spaniards would quickly extinguish the fire and plug the holes.

The distance had now shortened to less than 1000 meters. The galleon's broadside suddenly flashed fire and emitted a puff of white smoke, followed by the sound of a cannon. Immediately following were puffs of white smoke from seven or eight consecutive cannon shots. Cannonballs dragging white smoke trails kicked up water columns not far from *Nongchao*.

Lin Chuanqing remained unmoving as a mountain. At this distance, the Spaniards would need incredible luck to hit his ship. However, the Spanish counterattack fully demonstrated they didn't intend to surrender obediently. And the guns on the gun deck weren't fully destroyed.

The formation turned again at the galleon's stern, cutting into a T-formation. The distance between the formation and the galleon had now reduced to about 300 meters; the naked eye could clearly observe conditions on deck. Lin Chuanqing took out a steel helmet and handed it to Zhou Weisen.

"Safety first."

At this moment, four puffs of white smoke rose from the stern; the Spaniards fired a stern volley simultaneously. A loud "clang" immediately came from the rear of *Nongchao*. Zhou Weisen looked out and saw an iron ball bounce off the hull into the sea—although the 901 wasn't made of oak, the texture of Southeast Asian teak was extraordinary; demi-culverin balls from the galleon's stern couldn't penetrate it. However, Zhou Weisen knew well that if a cannonball hit the deck, killing a few sailors would be no problem.

"Distance 300 meters, load grapeshot! Fleet volley!" Lin Chuanqing roared. "Mast-top guns fire at will!"

In this instant, Lin Chuanqing clearly saw the ship's name on the stern: it was indeed the *San Luis*.

The 130mm guns began raking the galleon's decks longitudinally; iron shot swept across decks like a rainstorm. Then the "typewriters" on the masts spewed bullet rain. Through telescopes, wood chips flew on the galleon's poop deck and other decks; several bodies were even seen falling from the towering poop into the sea.

The formation slowed and swept past the galleon's port side, strafing continuously. After firing one or two completely inaccurate shots, the galleon went completely silent, floating dead in the water.

"Try psychological warfare."

"Cease fire! Boarding team ready!"

The high-power loudspeakers specially installed on the flagship for this operation blared. Miss Mendoza's Spanish poured out from the speakers:

"Ultimatum to surrender the *San Luis*:

"Captain, First Mate, Second Mate, all officers, all soldiers, all sailors of the *San Luis*: You are surrounded, with no hope of escape.

"You have seen that your firepower is meaningless. Our cannons and muskets are far more powerful than yours. Your cannons have been silenced, masts broken, sailors suffered heavy casualties. As captain and officers, you should consider the feelings of your subordinates and families, find a way to live for yourselves and them early, and stop making senseless sacrifices.

"We can pull alongside to board and occupy your ship at any time now. You should all lay down weapons and cease resistance. We will guarantee the lives of all officers, soldiers, sailors, and families. Only this is your sole way to live. If you still want to fight, then fight; eventually, you will all be resolved quickly."

"Hoist the white flag and surrender. The Lord is merciful; He will bless your safe return to your hometown."

"Is it useful?"

"Who cares, let's see. Though I can't understand it, the western mare's voice is quite nice to listen to."

"Truly hitting a rat in a china shop—tied hands and feet, walking on egg shells. Luckily these Spanish sailors are effective at firefighting."

Amidst the chatter, several white spots appeared on the opposing ship. Through telescopes, they were white shirts, white towels, and the like, stuck on long poles extending from the poop deck portholes.

According to intelligence suggestions, Zhou Weisen—wearing a bulletproof vest inside and ragged pirate clothes outside, rubbing his fists at the boarding bridge—almost fainted. Is this it? The chick spouts a few words of bird language, and I'm unemployed?

"Prepare to board!" Just as Lin Chuanqing was about to order pulling alongside, suddenly over a dozen puffs of white smoke rose from the opposing deck, and crackling gunfire was faintly heard.

"Fake surrender?" Lin Chuanqing shuddered and spat fiercely. "These bastards, looks like we have to hit them hard again, then kill everyone without mercy!" Saying this, he roared, "All typewriters fire at will! No living person allowed on deck. Sweep every gun port for me!"

After another round of rainstorm-like bullets, the *San Luis* was thoroughly paralyzed on the sea surface. Ship No. 1, which had been sailing with the wind, almost stopped due to loss of wind propulsion, like a dragged whale helplessly waiting to be butchered—looking from any angle like it no longer had the capacity to resist.

"Prepare to board!" Zhou Weisen roared. He put on his helmet and goggles and drew his M1911 pistol—this gun had great power and reliable action, a sharp weapon in close quarters. Because there were very few of these pistols, Zhou Weisen usually only carried a Glock 17. He brought it specially this time; to ensure the pistol wouldn't drop during combat, he specifically got a lanyard tied to his belt.

*Nongchao*'s boarding ramp was already set up on the ship's side. The platform height was exactly level with the galleon's upper deck. *Nongchao*'s bow slowly passed the sailing ship, distance only ten meters. Then *Nongchao* slowly moved laterally, gradually closing in on the sailing ship, and maintained contact with it.

The first wave of five members consisted of Special Recon members using Skorpion submachine guns and shotguns, with an M240 machine gun team holding the line on the platform. Finally, an Ah San sailor who could speak Spanish acted as translator.

The second wave waited on deck. They were elites selected from the Marine Corps, each with four 1630 revolvers crossed on their chests, holding short-barreled Minié rifles or "double-tap"—shotguns made by Li Yiwo himself. Lacking qualified firing springs, he adopted this double-barreled structure with percussion cap ignition, allowing separate firing of left and right barrels.

The two ships got closer and closer. Zhou Weisen's heart was in his throat. The boarding platform had steel plate railings, enough to block matchlocks, flintlocks, and 1-pounder deck guns, but once the ramp door opened, they would be completely exposed to enemy fire. He could only pray the machine gunners and snipers on the mast tops and deck were sharp-eyed and quick-handed.

At this moment, the miserable state of the *San Luis*'s deck was right before their eyes. The deck was scattered with all kinds of oak splinters: shattered gun carriages, collapsed spars, rigging, lifeboats, yards—everything that had existed on the main deck had been swept by bullets, beaten into flakes and strips. Blood smeared the floor, scattered with incomplete corpses—a bloody scene of hell on earth.

The boarding bridge platform slowly approached the *San Luis*. Zhou Weisen's heartbeat accelerated as he flipped off the pistol safety. Suddenly, the boarding bridge shook violently and stopped.

"Attention! Opening door!"

With a loud clang of the door opening, Zhou Weisen was the first to jump out, rolling and steadying himself in a half-crouch on the *San Luis*'s deck. Several team members quickly occupied combat positions, using alternating cover to search.

The deck was dead silent; let alone gunshots, there wasn't even a living person.

"Clear!" he roared. The shout was transmitted to *Nongchao*'s deck via the walkie-talkie on his shoulder. The second wave of Marine boarding team immediately surged up the ladder.

According to the plan, Zhou Weisen led the Special Recon team to control the poop deck for security, while the boarding team controlled the deck and various access hatches in batches.

Zhou Weisen took the lead to quickly ascend the poop deck. Two guys hiding in the corner of the poop deck roof, already trembling with fear, heard someone rushing up and immediately drew swords to resist. Zhou Weisen, already at the ladder entrance, fired two shots in succession with his M1911 in hand, instantly knocking them down. Those following immediately controlled the entire poop deck platform.

After ascending the roof, obstacle clearers quickly chopped down the roof railings, lowered the spanker sail to clear lines of fire, and tied the cables thrown from *Nongchao* to bind the two ships more tightly together.

After controlling the entire roof platform, the assault team began expanding to the cabins below the poop deck. According to data in hand, usually the upper layer of such sailing ship stern cabins housed senior crew like the first mate and helmsman, while below near the stern was the captain's quarters. If there were prominent passengers, they would also be housed in this area.

The assault team rushed down the stairs, first controlling the area at the poop deck cabin entrance. A battle seemed to have occurred here; the cabin door and nearby bulkheads were covered in bullet holes. Four or five people lay dead on the deck in disorder, seeming correctly killed by bullets; some looked high-ranking. Zhou Weisen noticed one still held a wooden stick tied with a white napkin.

"Breach!" At Zhou Weisen's call, one Special Recon member blasted the door open with a shotgun. Another agilely tossed in a chili tear gas grenade. "Bang," it exploded.

"Don't throw bombs! We surrender!" Wails in Spanish came from inside the cabin, followed by sounds of violent coughing and sneezing.
