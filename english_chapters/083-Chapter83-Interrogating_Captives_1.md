# Chapter 83 - Interrogating Captives (1)

Someone proposed to conduct a comprehensive interrogation and screening of the captives, trying to get as much information about the local situation as possible from their mouths. This would be much more useful and faster than the Executive Committee relying only on the Intelligence and Data Group to find information from books. So Ran Yao got a new task: interrogating captives.

Although someone raised questions about human rights of captives and the like, many people were obviously not interested in how to guarantee the human rights of local natives, but had full interest in how to torture captives. Before Ran Yao had figured out how to interrogate, someone voluntarily came up to propose various torture instruments and torture methods.

"I am interrogating captives, not filming 'Top Ten Tortures of Manchu Qing'." Ran Yao didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and had to repeatedly reject various enthusiastic proposals from these people. However, with so many captives, and the Public Security Group having too many of their own things to do to handle this job, after thinking about it, he had to apply to the Executive Committee to borrow the two former colleagues who held temporary ID cards.

Little Guo, who originally planned to show his skills in the battle, was issued a rifle, but because the location was wrong, he didn't even fire a shot, and was assigned some battlefield cleaning work. Just when he was depressed, a transfer order transferred him to the Public Security Group. He was excited for a while: finally can do the old profession again!

"Okay, Little Guo, from today on you are responsible for interrogating captives. Get the process and outline done tonight first." Ran Yao stretched his waist, "By the way, we also transferred Mu Min over. You two male and female matching, working won't be tiring, right."

"Group Leader Ran, this, she has a husband. Matching with me to work, isn't it..." Little Guo euphemistically expressed the inappropriateness of the arrangement.

"You are quite feudal. What, want me to transfer the big ocean horse to you?" Ran Yao teased him, "Salina's body is also about recovered, but they haven't been appointed for the time being. Hard to handle." Saying this, he took off his hat and smoothed his hair, "By the way, Wu De will also coordinate with your work. He is in charge of captives exclusively. People passed through your hands will be received by him."

"No problem, I will definitely coordinate well with Captain Wu's work!"

"No, you are coordinating with each other, not you coordinating with him," Ran Yao chuckled and patted his shoulder, "Comrade Little Guo, although you don't have a formal establishment now, you are a rare specialized talent in our Public Security Group..."

Guo Yi came out of the Public Security Group office a bit dizzy. His office location was by the river, where the Architecture Team was building a captive camp. Bulldozers and excavators were roaring at work. In the river, there was a group of naked bodies; captives were bathing. Guo Yi had no interest in watching men bathe. Just as he turned to walk away, someone chased after him from behind:

"Guo, Guo—" It was Xue Ziliang who came, wearing a steel helmet on his head, "Finally found you. Haven't seen you for two weeks."

"What is it?" Guo Yi stayed a bit further away from him. He didn't want anyone to notice him talking to an ABC.

"Guo, help me find your, um, um—leaders, is it called leaders? Talk to them, change my job," he looked at his worn-out gloves with a sad face, "I've been driving a tractor for two weeks. I am an ATF! A professional, you guys need me!"

"I can't make the decision on this issue," Guo Yi looked around for a while, making sure no one was paying attention to them, "I myself hold a temporary card, how can I speak for you?"

"God, why do you all speak in the same tone!" Xue Ziliang looked up and roared at the sky, "This I can't make the decision... This matter needs to be studied... Leaders have no time..."

Guo Yi originally wanted to send him away with one sentence and run away to discuss work with Wu De and Mu Min. Seeing this ABC's desperate look, he pitied him a bit, "Xue, you have to learn to be a Chinese now, understand? To be a Chinese, first you must have patience," he poked Xue Ziliang's chest with his finger, "Patience, understand? Do your work well, leaders know everything."

After saying this, he hurried away. As for whether Xue Ziliang could understand his words, that was another matter. Looking at it now, the leadership seemed to trust him more than the foreigners, so he didn't want his image to be always connected with Xue Ziliang and his kind.

The captive camp was set up by the river. An open space was temporarily enclosed with barbed wire. The captives built shacks themselves. The five captives led by Wu De now played a big role. Seeing more companions coming, they immediately realized that they would be reused. Therefore, in the entire arrangement, everyone did their best to show their fierceness and capability in front of Wu De.

The interrogation location was outside this temporary captive camp. A tent was set up. To enhance the intimidation effect, a large wooden stump was placed outside the tent, on which lay a medieval giant battle axe found from someone's collection. It was also specially polluted fully with medical waste found from the infirmary—the shiny axe was now full of blood stains. Although this thing had never chopped anyone, those who saw it still felt a chill on the back of their necks.

Yu Eshui, who planned this, originally wanted to set up a forest of spears outside the tent, with a dead person's head stuck on each spear tip, but was opposed by everyone unanimously—the psychological stimulation of this thing is too strong, probably the first ones who can't stand it would be themselves.

At night, raging bonfires were lit on both sides of the road from the tent to the camp. The mysterious and terrifying atmosphere made the captives who were fearful and uneasy about their fate even more apprehensive. When he was brought to the door and saw the blood-stained axe, he would almost immediately collapse softly.

The interrogation was conducted by two people together. Mu Min basically didn't speak during the interrogation, only taking notes, and sometimes prompting Little Guo—when it comes to interrogation experience, the female police officer who had worked in public security and criminal investigation for many years naturally had much more than Little Guo, who mainly invited people to drink tea. However, getting a female pirate to interrogate now seemed to scare this group of Ming Dynasty people a bit too much, so she had to temporarily settle for the second position. The one responsible for translation was Lin Xing, who learned Mandarin best among the captives. Xiong Buyou was also monitoring on the scene to avoid getting the meaning wrong sometimes.

Captive's name, address, age, occupation situation, family background, etc. The Internal Affairs Committee instructed the IT Group to prepare a personnel database for captives in the server, just need to fill directly into the database.

Although the interrogation team created enough atmosphere of terror, Guo Yi and Mu Min both quickly experienced the inherent cunning of Chinese farmers. Everyone said they were poor peasants for three generations, with no tile above and no place to stand below, all having eighty-year-old mothers above and eight-year-old children below. This made Guo Yi very puzzled—was being from a poor peasant background for three generations so popular back then?

As for names and addresses, they were messy and simply impossible to judge—more than one hundred people actually came from eighty or ninety villages. Obviously, many people were concealing their true situations. Quite a few people rolled on the ground when captured, attempting to use mud to disguise themselves, but the river water stripped off all their disguises.

If it were other interrogation officials of this era, they would either be unable to sort out clues from this pile of Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er, and Mazi, or they would have to use torture to get the truth. But for people from modern dictatorship institutions, these were not problems. Temporarily fabricated lies are easy to forget.

...

"Gender?"

"Name?"

"Didn't you just say your name was Zhao San? Why changed surname? What is your name exactly?"

...

No matter how he swore that he didn't say his name was "Zhao San" before, the recording pen would leave him speechless. This little thing like witchcraft made many people speak the truth in fear. Some people continued their lies until exposed again. At this time, he would be driven outside to walk around the fire pile. Several people watched him, not allowing him to sleep, driving him with long spears to walk in circles constantly until he was willing to tell the truth himself. Guo Yi knew this kind of torture was more effective than any cruel punishment. A person with the strongest will collapsed and died after walking in circles for half a night after lying four times continuously and being exposed, giving the captives a terrible warning.

Soon all captives confessed everything about themselves, along with things they knew about others, in full detail.

Most were indeed poor people. Of course, many of them were not really so poor to this extent. One-third of the captives came from a large village stockade called Huang Family Stockade. The leader of this attack was Huang Shoutong, the Corps Head of Huang Family Stockade.

The captured militia from Huang Family Stockade were mostly tenant farmers and long-term laborers. Some had a little land themselves and also rented some of Huang family's land. Because they served as militia, the treatment was better than ordinary tenant farmers and long-term laborers. Tenant farmers could pay less grain, and long-term laborers could get more wages. Others were clansmen or relatives of the Huang family, either small landlords or yeoman farmers. Coming out to fight this time, besides the reward money given by the county, Huang Shoutong also promised to reduce their money and grain taxes for this year if they won, and compensate the whole family if they died.

So Huang Family Stockade militia were particularly brave in this battle, and casualties were also the greatest. According to one of the small leaders, except for those who came to make up the numbers as laborers, more than half of the attacking militia died.

"What about Huang Shoutong?" Guo Yi hurriedly asked.

"Didn't see Corps Head Huang," that leader said, "As soon as the deputy masters fired bird guns, the Corps Head dismounted to command, then disappeared..."

Others came from all kinds of places. Most were long-term laborers sent by masters to make up the numbers. Some were destitute households sent by clans or villages to fight because they had "no ties"—meaning people whose death didn't matter. Those unwilling to tell their situations were mostly small landlords, yeoman farmers, and tenant farmers with some family property, afraid of implicating their families to be looted or extorted by pirates. Many poor people also made up nonsense because of fear.

From the captives' mouths, they learned a lot about the nearby situation, including the distribution of villages, roughly how many people in the village, which were wealthy households and landlords, and what sidelines or special products which villages had. All were told in detail. Some people even became ruthless as they spoke, saying they were willing to join and become pirates, and could lead them to raid the wealthy households in their own villages, as long as they were allowed to kill so-and-so.

The interrogation team carefully recorded the information provided by him. Some people couldn't control their emotions as they spoke and wailed loudly. Lin Xing also shed tears listening.

"What are they saying?" Guo Yi asked Xiong Buyou, seeing looks of deep bitterness and hatred.

"Speaking of which, it's really miserable—" Xiong Buyou showed a look of sympathy, shaking his head, "These who say they are willing to join all have blood feuds."

"Let them speak in detail," Guo Yi suddenly became interested. An idea came into his mind, "One by one."
