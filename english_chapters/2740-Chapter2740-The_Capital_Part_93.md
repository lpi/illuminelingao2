# Chapter 2740: The Capital (Part 92)

Leng Ningyun returned to the bank feeling much more confident.

Having Prefect Zhong's commitment was equivalent to official backing—at least in the eyes of the common people. The key was making the forces behind the kidnappers wary.

Though the capital was full of high officials, the Shuntian Prefecture magistrate was one of the most important positions in the capital. Only trusted ministers of the Emperor could hold it.

The next task was to "persuade" the bosses of Shanxi House.

Winter nights came early. Just past four o'clock, the sky began to darken. Outside, scattered firecrackers sounded. No matter how bad the year, certain traditions had to be observed.

Inside Delong and the residence, however, it was lively. Leng Ningyun's return was a shot in the arm for everyone. Though the clerks had no idea how to handle the run once they opened on the fifth, having the manager back gave everyone a sense of security. After all, over the years of pioneering markets in the capital, they'd weathered plenty of storms, all resolved under the manager's direction. So people still believed Leng Ningyun had such abilities.

As for Leng Ningyun himself, he wasn't actually that confident. Though he'd telegraphed headquarters and knew the Field Bureau and Beiyang Army Reconnaissance Division were dispatching personnel who would arrive in Tianjin early in the New Year—giving him crack troops to command—he still hoped to resolve the market problem "peacefully" rather than through killing and arson. Of course, if it came to that, he wouldn't hesitate.

That day's New Year's Eve dinner, he first dined with the shop staff in the bank, then returned to the inner residence to keep New Year's Eve vigil with the women.

He'd celebrated New Year in the capital many times, but this time, having escaped death, there was a special feeling in his heart.

After the New Year, on the first day of the first month, Leng Ningyun gathered all of Delong's senior staff to prepare for reopening.

After the meeting, he kept Wu Kaidi behind separately to discuss fundraising.

Official seals would be reopened on the third of the first month. Most merchants reopened on the fifth. Wu Kaidi estimated Shuntian Prefecture would send people to unseal on the fourth or fifth.

As for Delong, there was no need to open right at the deadline. By custom, the capital's banking guild would host a banquet on the fifth to entertain peers. It was both for building relationships and discussing important matters for the new year. Only after this banquet would the banking industry officially open for business.

This opening banquet was a matter of life and death for the banking trade's large and small players. The money trade differed from other industries—it was "making money with money," a business of creating something from nothing.

A bank's deposits and capital were limited. When funds were tight, banks had to coordinate among themselves. Such coordination included both long-term loans and short-term advances. Through mutual honoring, clearing, and settlement among the banks, the money trade could make one million taels serve as three million.

Everything had two sides. There were benefits and drawbacks. Banks weren't like street money changers or single-room exchange shops. Each had at least tens of thousands in capital and deposits, leveraging hundreds of thousands in business. Once one collapsed, every connected peer would suffer losses.

Though peers were rivals, in the money trade, there was a sense of shared fate.

Because of this relationship, guild membership was hard to obtain. Not only did one need substantial capital and connections, but also the approval of most guild members. At that time, the Shanxi faction dominated the capital's money trade, with the strongest capital. Next came the Jiangnan-Zhejiang faction and the Lianghu faction. He, a lone Guangdong faction, couldn't even find the door.

It had been quite difficult for Delong to enter the guild originally. Fortunately, his capital and connections were ample. Crucially, he could handle Liangguang remittances—fast and in large amounts—which was rare for the capital's peers. He also used his relationship with Zhao Yingong to win over the Jiangnan-Zhejiang faction. Only then was he admitted.

But Shanxi House's attitude toward this newcomer had originally been mere "exclusion." Though there were many frictions over deposit collection, things generally hadn't reached a life-or-death stage. First, their business scopes rarely overlapped—a case of well water not mixing with river water. Second, he had Eunuch Yang's backing. The power of a great eunuch wasn't something ordinary officials and gentry dared or wanted to provoke.

But through this kidnapping case, Shanxi House's attitude was thought-provoking. It showed someone among them was deeply involved. Whether it was a specific Shanxi House or the entire Shanxi faction remained unclear.

What was known was that Manager Qiao of Xia's Shanxi House was deeply involved. A mere manager couldn't have such audacity. Xia's must certainly be deeply implicated.

"In my view, Shanxi House might kick us when we're down, but intending to kill you is unlikely," Wu Kaidi said. "Even if they bought large amounts of Delong notes at low prices, if we can't honor them in full, they're just waste paper. If Delong falls, everyone suffers losses. Why do something that hurts others without helping themselves?"

"Exactly. So in the kidnapping case, besides Xia's, the other houses probably aren't involved. If they can take advantage and make Delong collapse, they'll be happy to watch. But they're all standing by, waiting to take cheap shots. They won't necessarily make an effort." Leng Ningyun sighed. "So I guess the main force preparing for the run by buying notes cheap is Xia's. The other houses don't need to deliberately come redeem—just bringing the Delong notes they accumulated before the New Year would be enough."

"Xia's willingness to do this losing business is probably at someone's direction..."

"That goes without saying! Must be the Stone Elder Group, and maybe other bigwigs too."

Now that he had returned safely, the other seven Shanxi Houses were probably wary. No matter what the people behind Xia's had told them or promised, his return fully demonstrated Delong's strength.

Kicking someone when they're down was one thing; real sword-and-gun fighting was another. This was also why he believed the Shanxi Houses could still be won over.

"Besides the eight Shanxi Houses, there are six Jiangnan-Zhejiang and Lianghu faction peers who can be approached. Though they're far weaker than the Shanxi faction, something is better than nothing."

Wu Kaidi understood immediately. "I'll go see their managers right away."

"Speak plainly to them. First, Delong really is in difficulty, but if we can stabilize, everyone benefits. Second, Shanxi House is already the most powerful in the capital. If they crush Delong this time, they'll certainly push further afterward. So in this matter, please ask them to send over as much short-term capital as they can."

"Yes, they understand that if lips are gone, teeth will be cold," Wu Kaidi said. "But these six houses all have thin capital. Asking them to send silver will be difficult..."

"Send whatever they can, at double last year's highest interbank lending rate." Leng Ningyun said. "Tell them they don't need to send silver—please send notes instead."

"Each of these six houses can probably lend about two thousand taels. More than that is probably hopeless."

Two thousand each meant twelve thousand—still far short of the 180,000 gap. Moreover, of the existing 150,000, Eunuch Yang had declared he'd withdraw his 100,000 the moment they opened. Calculating this way, there was still a gap of nearly 270,000 taels.

270,000 taels was a staggering figure in late Ming. The court's expenditure on repairing the Three Great Halls during the Wanli and Tianqi eras was only twenty or thirty thousand taels.

But on second thought, it wasn't really that much. Subtracting the 100,000 Eunuch Yang would definitely withdraw, of the remaining 170,000, most were outstanding notes. Delong had nationwide branches with good reputation and fast remittances. Many notes were still in transit or in other regions. The notes circulating in the capital's market were at most 100,000.

"Getting Shanxi House not to kick us when we're down would already be good. Probably can't count on them for timely help." Wu Kaidi sighed.

"Not necessarily." Leng Ningyun said. "As long as Delong doesn't collapse and they can make money, that's enough. These Shanxi fellows even do business with the Eastern Barbarians. Can't they make money from us? Xia's is stuck on the pirate ship and can't get off, but the other seven can definitely be approached. Get about 100,000 taels from them."

"Just doubling the lending benefit probably won't move them."

"Benefits alone won't work—there have to be consequences too." Leng Ningyun chuckled. "The Special Reconnaissance Team will be in Tianjin in a few days. How can we not use such a good opportunity?"

Wu Kaidi had never been to Lingao, but he'd heard stories about the Special Reconnaissance Team. Hearing him mention it, he couldn't help laughing. "Yes, with them here, we can also 'invite Gods of Wealth'!"

"Exactly. If they cooperate nicely, good. If not, we'll have to tear off pretenses and use tactics." Leng Ningyun said. "But if it really comes to that, it'll be hard to resolve. We're just 'stealing the red rope and opening the box'—letting them know what they're dealing with is enough."

"Yes, yes, that'll be enough." Wu Kaidi's face brightened considerably. "As long as these seven don't run on us, we'll be fine!"

"Calculating this way, it should work out." Leng Ningyun said. "To be cautious, we still need more cash on hand. Prepare a visiting card for me. In the next two days, I want to see Li Luoyou."

"You want to see him?" Wu Kaidi was startled. "He's in the capital, but he's famously hard to see. You've asked several times and been refused..."

"Delong is now at a life-or-death juncture. He must see me."

Wu Kaidi was dumbfounded. By common sense, having been refused when things were going well, with Delong now in danger, the other party would be even less likely to respond.

Of course, he didn't know that Li Luoyou had a weak spot in the Short-Hairs' grasp. As long as he cared about his nephew-in-law, he had to help at this time. If things really deteriorated to Delong's collapse, with Leng Ningyun fleeing or being arrested, Gu Baocheng in Lingao might as well forget about doing business—he'd be better off digging sand for Fu Youdi.

Seeing his surprise, Leng Ningyun didn't explain further, only saying, "Don't worry. In times of crisis, Mr. Li will definitely not abandon us."

Seeing his confidence, Wu Kaidi said, "I'll arrange it right away. He's in the capital but doesn't stay at his own residence—he has another place."

"Prepare a generous gift, all the newest Australian goods! Prepare one for his concubine too."
