# Chapter 1298 Lanshantou

"What a terrible place." Although it was sunny and windless now, Wang Ruixiang still couldn't help but shiver. Shandong's winter was hard to get along with—although he was also a big Shandong man in another timeline, now wrapped in a thick overcoat with fur lining exclusively for Senators and thermal underwear brought from the old timeline, wearing a velvet hat on his head, he still felt the piercing cold.

But to maintain the image of a Senator in front of naturalized citizens, Wang Ruixiang still maintained a head-high, chest-out, confident appearance in front of the refugees and soldiers.

The last time he felt this kind of embarrassment from the cold winter should have been more than a dozen years ago. Wang Ruixiang looked back down the hillside. Thousands of refugees lined up in neat columns of five, forming three hollow square formations around several large cauldrons, eating in an orderly manner. The refugees held two-meter-long wooden sticks and half-knelt on the ground on one knee. Only the squad leader at the innermost of each row ran back and forth, taking wooden bowls filled with steaming relief gruel from the cooks and handing them one by one to the other four people in the same squad. After everyone got their wooden bowls, the musicians at the innermost of the square formation blew the bugle three times.

"Save the world and relieve the people to pacify all under heaven, the Senate is supreme!" Although the refugees shouted not very uniformly while holding their bowls, and it was estimated that few people fully understood the meaning of this sentence, the simultaneous shouting of thousands of people was still very imposing. After finishing the pre-meal ceremony, the refugees put down the wooden sticks used as walking sticks, took out the relief cakes warmed by their bodies from their bosoms, and wolfed them down with the gruel.

It seemed that the training in the few weeks before departure was not in vain. Only this sense of accomplishment of changing the world could make him feel that abandoning everything in the old timeline to come to this poor land for this transmigration was worth it.

Destruction and construction give people the greatest sense of accomplishment, not to mention that what he was doing was destroying this old world and then building a new one.

In the old timeline, when various high-tech warm products had not yet appeared, his young self had also stood on this land shrouded in cold winter wearing thick and bloated cotton-padded clothes like this. It was just that his current situation was very different compared to back then. In the old timeline, he was also extremely disgusted with his current status as a desperate military otaku, very regretful and nostalgic about the past, and had fantasized more than once about how he would change his life if he could return to that age again. Although this transmigration was not quite the same as expected, after hesitating again and again, he finally made up his mind: "If I can't change my past, then I will change the future of myself along with this world." With this chuunibyou belief, he firmly stepped onto this road with an uncertain future.

Wang Ruixiang reached out and rubbed his forehead, clearing these past memories from his eyes, looked down at his watch, then looked up at the vast wilderness, and then turned and led the Special Reconnaissance Team members guarding the side to walk slowly down the hillside.

At the foot of the hill, several soldiers of the Northbound Detachment performing escort missions were cooking. The army issued better tasting and higher grade field rations to every soldier, but the soldiers could also get an extra bowl of relief gruel. Trekking long distances in the wild in this severe cold weather, the calories consumed were far from what the ordinary version of field rations could replenish. But high-calorie cold zone version field rations were only distributed to Senators and the Special Reconnaissance Team.

"Chief!" Seeing a Senator walking over, the soldiers gathered around the pot immediately straightened their bodies and saluted. Wang Ruixiang returned the salute and waved his hand to let them continue. He ate from the same stove as the Special Reconnaissance Team. The pot also boiled gruel, with the difference being that dried vegetable leaves were added, and the field rations were the cold zone version. There was relatively more fat and minced meat.

If eaten just like this, the taste could be called bland. However, the chili sauce Wang Ruixiang brought with him made the small stove here and the big pot rice of the refugees simply worlds apart.

After the group finished eating, Wang Ruixiang looked at his watch. The time was about right. He signaled the people around him to continue moving. The musicians returned to the side of the team and blew the bugle. The refugees picked up their wooden sticks one after another and stood up. After drinking the remaining hot water in the bowl, they shook it dry, stuffed it into the bag on their waist, and then marked time to organize the team following the short drumbeats. The squad leaders also returned from the innermost part of the square formation to the far right of the team. After a few more bugle calls, the refugees slowly turned back from the quadrilateral square formation to five columns of marching formation.

The entire refugee team had turned into a marching column half a li long. Several soldiers carrying flags walked to the very front of the team. Several cavalrymen of the Northbound Detachment serving as scouts rode horses forward to one li away.

"Departure!" With a command, after a few bugle calls, the drumbeat changed abruptly. The entire team began to advance slowly and firmly, continuing this long and arduous journey.

"Now is the fourth day. It seems we can arrive on time tomorrow." Wang Ruixiang returned to the front of the central baggage train, calculating in his mind.

The road Wang Ruixiang led the team on this time was not the road from Juyang River to Laizhou Bay they took before the Dengzhou Turmoil. Although the war had subsided now, the several temporary supply points set up along the road in the past had all been abandoned. It was too difficult to rely on the refugees carrying all the dry rations for the journey to walk there on foot. Moreover, the grain consumed along the way was also too much. So it was changed to go to sea from Lanshantou.

To be precise, it was going to sea from Foshou Bay in Lanshantou. This place was the Lanshan Port area of the old timeline. The waters of Lanshan Port were relatively wide, with good water depth conditions. The natural water depth at the front of the 20,000-ton berth could reach 10 meters. Lanshan Port was an ice-free port. In the Ming Dynasty, it belonged to the jurisdiction of Rizhao County, Juzhou, Qingzhou Prefecture.

This was the outbound wharf selected by Wang Ruixiang after leading people to reconnoiter many times. In addition to the hydrological data obtained from the old timeline materials, he found that this place was sparsely populated in the Ming Dynasty. Moreover, it was a full 40 kilometers away from the nearest Ming army garrison, Andong Garrison. The entire defensive force was just a beacon tower and five beacon tower guard soldiers. Without a large-scale alarm, the hungry and cold drilling troops of Andong Garrison would not run here. Neither ships docking nor refugee movements would attract attention.

Moreover, the road distance from Yishui City here was only 128 kilometers, and they could roughly march along Provincial Highway 335 and Provincial Highway 222. If the refugees marched at an average speed of 30 kilometers per day, they could arrive at Foshou Bay in at most 5 days. In this way, the dry rations prepared for the refugees on the road could also be significantly reduced.

According to the Song people, a soldier carrying six dou could support ten days of grain. This was also the maximum ration count a soldier could carry with him. But this was for able-bodied young men, not the same thing for a refugee group with men, women, old, and young in a state of long-term malnutrition.

In terms of the refugees' physique, it was impossible to carry ten days of rations, and Wang Ruixiang simply dared not let them carry so many rations: if no one was watching, many people would eat three days of rations on the first day. Some people would be stuffed to death by dry rations without water. Some refugees would also take the opportunity to run away with the rations—this kind of thing had happened many times before.

So currently, Wang Ruixiang adopted the method of the baggage train carrying rations centrally. The baggage train used wheelbarrows. Pushing and pulling carts were done by young and strong refugees rotating daily. The baggage train was escorted by the guard team. This ensured that the grain could be distributed safely without adding manpower.

The refugees marched in a formation of five people per squad. Except for young children, everyone had to carry a wooden stick—this thing could effectively save physical strength during long treks, and could also be used for self-defense when necessary. When marching, young and strong refugees were on the outside, and the baggage train and women and children were on the inside. Young children and the weak rode wheelbarrows in the baggage train to advance. If anyone fell ill or fell behind on the road, they were also taken in by the baggage train.

Every refugee marching column sent to Foshou Bay was equipped with a guard team: composed of a mixture of the Northbound Detachment and the Yunshenguan militia. The Yunshenguan militia was responsible for maintaining order in the team and guarding the baggage train. The Northbound Detachment sent scout cavalry forward to conduct reconnaissance, and used force to disperse hostile forces when necessary.

It was truly not easy to take these thousands of people through more than a hundred kilometers of disaster-ravaged areas. Famine caused most of the settlements along this road to be abandoned. Starving people and wandering bandits were everywhere. Along the way, let alone replenishing grain, even firewood and drinking water were not easy to raise. The weather was severely cold again. Walking to the fourth day, dozens of people had already been lost—this was considered an action with few losses. There were several times when encountering blizzards or other natural disasters, it was not rare for hundreds of people to die or be lost at once.

At noon on the fifth day, the refugee column finally arrived at Foshou Bay. There was only a small fishing village and a beacon tower here. Ever since Wang Ruixiang and the Daoist Priest chose this place as the refugee departure port, the Northbound Detachment sent a detachment to directly control this place. Most of the commoners in the fishing village had been abducted to Jeju Island, leaving only a few fishermen familiar with the hydrology and tide conditions of Lanshantou to be used as pilots.

The beacon tower was also controlled by the Northbound Detachment. The five beacon tower guards and their families became prisoners. Wang Ruixiang didn't trouble them much, just requiring them to operate "as usual every day"—of course, they had to be very tactful and "not see" everything happening in Foshou Bay right now.

Seeing the beacon tower of Foshou Bay in the distance, the young men of the guard team let out a burst of slight jubilation. For the sake of temporary transition for transshipping refugees, in addition to the pier built for boarding ships, Foshou Bay also had some additional supporting buildings built: a simple camp was built with the fishing village as the core, with many shacks built, which could accommodate at most two thousand refugees and three hundred guard and labor personnel. There was also a simple stockpile capable of storing one hundred thousand person-portions of relief rations.

The ships coming to pick up refugees were all fully loaded with relief rations. After unloading locally, they loaded refugees. The arrived grain was transported back by the returning guard team. Sometimes it was necessary to specially send a transport team to Foshou Bay to pick up grain. The round-trip grain consumption was large. If it were not for obtaining more population, doing so would be quite uneconomical.
