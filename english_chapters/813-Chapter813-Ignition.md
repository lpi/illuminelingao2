# Chapter 813 - Ignition

Directly developing Hongji meant a major investment. On the military side alone, they'd need to deploy at least one full-strength infantry battalion to Hongji. Northern Vietnam was different from the desolate Sanya or Hong Kong Island, which could rely on naval protection. Here they would directly face a North Vietnam army with considerable numerical superiority in land forces. The Northern Court's army had been armed with Portuguese and Dutch assistance; in terms of professionalization, firearm capabilities, and combat experience, it was a cut above Guangdong Ming forces.

Establishing a port and mining coal at Hongji would inevitably provoke armed expulsion from the Northern Court. Without at least one infantry battalion plus some artillery and naval support, they couldn't secure the mining area. The General Staff had drawn up a plan for occupying and defending the Hongji mining zone: permanent garrison strength would exceed three battalions. For the already stretched Army and Navy, this was pure fantasy.

The Army's five battalions were currently distributed across the entire northern half of Hainan Island, from Danzhou in the west to Wenchang in the east, conducting large-scale pacification operations. Except for one battalion stationed at Ma'ao as the general reserve, all units had been deployed. Mobilizing more troops would seriously impact agricultural and industrial production.

After much deliberation, Wu De decided to proceed cautiously. They would start by expanding trade—striving to use the armed-trading-post model and rely on local powers for extraction. This too required increased investment. At minimum, the Vietnam Trade Company's establishment could no longer remain under the Leizhou Station; it would need direct investment and management from the Council of Elders.

The steelworks' stockpiling of raw materials proceeded faster than Ji Wusheng and Wang Luobin had anticipated. The Planning Commission organized ships for a crash transport effort, and refined ore from Sanya, coking lignite from Qiongshan, and lignite from Leizhou were shipped continuously to Bopu and Ma'ao. Although a third of the Navy's vessels had been pulled ashore for repairs, temporarily reducing cargo capacity, the freed-up sailors were plentiful. The Navy adopted a "rotate crew, not ship" approach, keeping some vessels running continuously. Though this accelerated ship wear, for a Navy about to receive new toys, this sacrifice was worthwhile—steel expansion benefited both Army and Navy, but in the long run, the Navy stood to gain more: after all, the steel consumed by 100,000 rifles couldn't match a single ironclad, and one large-caliber naval gun used as much steel as ten M1857s.

With the Navy's all-out transportation effort, Lingao Steel Company's raw-material reserves reached the baseline 7-day target ahead of schedule. Ji Wusheng decided there was no time to lose—they would begin smelting immediately. The second drying process would take about 48 hours before they could begin charging, which would add several more days to the stockpile.

The Steel Company had already trained Lingao's first generation of steelworkers at the old converter workshop. Some had come from various smelting operations in Guangdong or had backgrounds as blacksmiths, with some ironmaking experience. The shift foreman was surnamed Li—originally the only blacksmith in Lingao town. Traditional blacksmiths were more like manufacturing workers and weren't really familiar with metallurgy. Most blacksmiths recruited by Lingao ended up in the Machinery Department. But this particular man's skills were so poor that even Lu Youtian shook his head after watching him. So he was sent directly to the Metallurgical Department as a furnace-front worker at the melting furnace.

Still, Blacksmith Li did have some basic smelting and casting ability—more than most others. Ji Wusheng noticed during work that the man was reasonably diligent and willing to learn, but learning required a skilled master and a competitive environment—both of which were in short supply in Hainan.

No one in this timeline had ever seen a blast furnace or open-hearth furnace. The steelworkers' only experience with modern steel technology came from the melting furnace and converter. For this reason, Ji Wusheng personally took charge of training the future steelworkers. He had scale models of the blast furnace and open-hearth constructed specifically for teaching smelting principles. Theoretically, the workers only needed to know what to do. But Ji Wusheng felt they should still receive some theoretical knowledge to promote their overall understanding.

These workers came to the Steel Company every day to work and study, participating in the steelworks construction. Especially when they saw the magnificent blast furnace and open-hearth—beyond their wildest dreams—rising from the ground, their excitement was palpable. To them, the small converter and melting furnace had already been miracles. How much more so this enormous tower!

"Can this blast furnace really make good steel?" Every day Ji Wusheng had to affirm this doubt from workers more than a dozen times.

Now the blast furnace was fully complete. The workers had carried out the first drying, gaining some understanding of charging. Ji Wusheng decided to officially ignite the blast furnace on February 6.

He personally supervised the workers loading charge—after the previous charging, they had gained some experience. But the second drying required even more care. In effect, the second drying meant entering formal production; any problem would seriously impact blast-furnace operations.

Ji Wusheng inspected the prepared coke powder—made from the finest coke sent from Bopu's coal-coking combined plant. The workers mixed tar into the coke powder, stirring it evenly, then added a proper amount of water to give it some moisture. Coke powder served as lining material during drying; it needed a certain moisture level to adhere to the furnace wall, but too much moisture would affect furnace temperature.

After applying the lining, Ji Wusheng personally crawled inside the furnace chamber, checking the thickness and moisture meter by meter, ensuring every step was done correctly. Wherever the thickness fell short of 20mm or the moisture was off, everything was torn out and redone.

After the lining was complete, wood shavings were delivered from the woodworking factory—shavings made excellent kindling: dry and easy to ignite. Several dozen large bales of shavings were loaded into the bottom layer of the blast furnace, followed by firewood stacked in a grid pattern. Additional shavings were placed near each tuyere. On top of the wood came coke, layered at 300mm per layer, with limestone added to the upper layers. The coke was arranged loosely for good airflow. Charging continued until the entire shaft was filled up to the throat.

Once charging was complete, it was time for the official ignition. Lighting a blast furnace was a major event even in the old timeline—large and super-large blast-furnace startups had been worthy of the evening news. For the transmigration enterprise, blast-furnace ignition was a significant step forward in "our enterprise."

On February 6, a simple but solemn ignition ceremony was held beneath the tall roof of the blast-furnace workshop. Steelworks workers, construction workers who had participated in building the plant, students, and Army and Navy soldiers crowded beneath the steel-truss canopy. Though this behemoth before them had been built by their own hands, brick by brick, seeing it complete and towering before them still left everyone marveling—this enormous thing could actually smelt iron! It was beyond imagination.

The sight amazed not only the naturalized citizens but also the Elders—most had never seen a blast furnace in person. Standing at the foot of the furnace, nearly a dozen meters tall, they were awed, and from the depths of their hearts swelled immense pride—they were about to possess a "divine artifact" of this era. The roaring flames of the blast furnace and the streams of molten iron it would pour forth would sweep the old world clean, leaving behind a new world that belonged to them.

The Executive Committee's key figures and active members of the Council of Elders naturally wouldn't miss this chance to make an appearance and turned out in force. Fang Fei, who specialized in organizing large-scale events, was also the main planner for this occasion. He asked Ji Wusheng if he wanted to hold a reception or something similar.

"The Industrial Sector has no budget line for receptions."

Under the reimbursement system established by the Cheka, only a very few external-facing departments had the authority to record and reimburse reception expenses. Other departments weren't even allowed to list such expenses in their accounts.

Fang Fei said, "The General Affairs Office can cover this expense. Just submit an application."

"No thanks. The blast-furnace ignition is significant, so we're holding a ceremony. But using that significance to eat and drink—let's not." Ji Wusheng had always despised the old-timeline practice of holding receptions to commemorate Pavlov's birthday and the like. So this ceremony only issued announcements, not invitations. The site had no decorations beyond banners, and no beverages, cigarettes, or food were prepared—the announcement specified that attendees should bring their own refreshments.

Despite the steelworks' lukewarm hospitality, the Elders came in droves. Besides the Executive Committee's top leaders, many from the Industrial and Military sectors showed up. Both were major steel consumers.

The Elders gathered beneath the blast furnace, excitedly discussing steel production capacity and applications. Inevitably, there was much militaristic talk of building ironclads, and railway construction became a hot topic. A minor debate even broke out over whether to build meter-gauge, standard-gauge, broad-gauge, or super-broad-gauge track. The female servants looked curiously at the blast furnace and their masters below it—gesticulating animatedly, faces flushed with excitement.

Some Elders used their privileges to approach the blast furnace for a closer look, scrutinizing the body, base, and tuyeres... Occasionally someone would excitedly point out that this or that component had been designed, manufactured, or sourced by their department or workshop. For the Chemical Sector Elders, their contribution had been enormous—solving the blast-furnace refractory materials alone had taken tremendous effort.

The blast-furnace workshop already looked quite "modern." Not only was the entire building's structure made of steel, with overhead cranes on the roof and rails on the ground, but the stairs, corridors, walkways, and most internal structures were industrial-style wrought-iron grating. It looked rugged and powerful.

Wen Desi and Ma Qianzhu had both arrived on-site, as if by prior agreement. Wen Desi circled the blast furnace several times, then suddenly said to Ma Qianzhu beside him: "Director Ma, I hear that in ancient times, furnace openings were consecrated with human sacrifices."
