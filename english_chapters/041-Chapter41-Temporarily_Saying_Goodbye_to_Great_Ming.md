Chapter 41 Temporarily Saying Goodbye to Great Ming

Although the "prophecy" matter was handled in this way, the transmigrators were still not completely relieved. After all, history is full of variables.

However, the preparation work for the large-scale transmigration could not be delayed.

After a discussion by the Executive Committee, it was decided that Wen Desi, Wang Luobin and Xiao Zishan would return to modern times first to handle the final material procurement and personnel gathering. Bei Wei, Lin Baiguang and others would stay in the Ming Dynasty to continue to manage the stronghold and collect intelligence.

Before leaving, Wen Desi gathered everyone for a meeting.

"Comrades, we are going back temporarily." Wen Desi's expression was solemn, "But this does not mean we are retreating. On the contrary, we are going to gather strength for the final general attack!"

"When we come back, we will bring thousands of troops and endless materials. We will completely change the face of this world!"

"Bei Wei, Lin Baiguang, the burden on your shoulders is heavy." Wen Desi looked at the stay-behind personnel, "You must hold the position and keep a low profile. Remember, safety first."

"Don't worry, President Wen!" Bei Wei saluted a military salute, "We promise to complete the task!"

Xiao Zishan also exhorted Gao Di and Gao Chang repeatedly: "We will leave for a while. During this period, you must listen to Master Bei and Master Lin's arrangements. If there is any situation, report it in time."

"Yes, Master." The two nodded respectfully.

After arranging everything, Wen Desi and his party opened the wormhole and returned to modern times.

Back in modern times, they immediately plunged into intense work.

The first thing was to recruit people.

Through the Internet and the introduction of the North American Branch, they recruited a large number of professionals.

"Mechanics, electricians, chemical engineers, doctors, teachers, agronomy experts... We want them all!" Wang Luobin waved the recruitment form and shouted.

The second was to purchase materials.

This time, their purchase scale was even larger. Not only daily necessities and tools, but also various large-scale equipment.

"Generators, machine tools, tractors, excavators... Buy, buy, buy!" Xiao Zishan commanded the procurement team to sweep the major markets.

In order to transport these materials, they even bought a 500-ton cargo ship - the "Fengcheng" (Abundance City).

"With this ship, we can transport hundreds of people and thousands of tons of materials at one time!" Wen Desi stood on the bridge of the cargo ship, full of pride.

Of course, such a large-scale operation also attracted the attention of relevant departments.

"Who are you? What are you doing?" An official from the maritime safety administration came to inquire.

"We are... an ocean fishing company." Wen Desi lied without blushing, "Preparing to go to the high seas for fishing."

"Fishing? Why bring so many machines?"

"Processing on the ship, fresh-keeping."

Although the official was suspicious, seeing that their procedures were complete (forged by the Intelligence Bureau) and they were willing to pay fines (bribery), he turned a blind eye.

Finally, everything was ready.

On a moonless night, the Fengcheng, fully loaded with materials and personnel, sailed out of the port and headed for the deep sea.

"Coordinates confirmed."
"Energy filling completed."
"Wormhole opening!"

A huge aperture appeared on the sea surface. The Fengcheng slowly sailed into the aperture and disappeared into the night.

Goodbye, 21st century.
Hello, 17th century.
