# Chapter 70 - Great Household Huang

Chapter 70 Great Household Huang

Wu Mingjin turned pale for a moment, feeling very moved in his heart. He knew that this Great Household Huang, because of being eager for public welfare and righteousness, often led clan members and militia to help suppress bandits whenever there was bandit trouble in the local area. He had already lost several nephews of close branches. But didn't expect that even a son died this time.

"Please restrain grief, old gentleman. After the bandits retreat, this student will naturally report to the superior officials to request pension and honor for your noble son." Great Household Huang had no academic degree, but he had a son who was a Xiucai, and Magistrate Wu intended to elevate him, so he usually called him "old gentleman".

"My dog son died for pacifying the local area. My Huang family has received national grace for generations, naturally should crush body and bones to serve the imperial court and defend the homeland, not coveting this pension and honor." Huang Shoutong was unwilling to talk more about his son - although he had three sons, this one was born of a concubine and had no academic degree, but the pain of losing a son was still heartbreaking.

"Shoutong came here to warn the Grand Master." He said straight to the point, "This time pirates are different from usual. My Lingao will have a great disaster!"

"Why does old gentleman say this?" Wu Mingjin was greatly surprised. He knew this old man was calm and tenacious, not a person who spoke empty big words.

Huang Shoutong then recounted the situation of his son leading a dozen militia to ambush three pirate scouts near Bailaren Beach yesterday. Although he didn't participate himself, the description of the militia who fled back surprised him very much. A round of bow and arrow attacks only shot down one. Although the old saying goes three arrows are not as good as one knife, and the bows used by militia were not good, the opponents had no armor. Two big men were hit by seven or eight arrows but could still charge all the way, killing several people in a row, and finally killing his son too.

He closed his eyes, remembering the miserable state after the militia brought back his son's corpse. Half of the cheek was almost smashed, and one eye was missing. Listening to the militia talking about the whole process, this person was hit by several arrows and surrounded by militia. His son, who liked to play with spears and sticks since childhood, was killed by him in only one round. Such a character would be a rare fierce general even in the official army.

He was not very worried about personal martial courage alone. But another thing brought back by the militia worried him very much.

"Pirate firearms are very powerful. One of them used a small hand gun, killing several people in a row without even loading powder. Grand Master please look -" Saying this, he handed over a cloth bundle from his bosom. Wu Mingjin opened it and saw a piece of dark blue iron inside. The appearance was very small. Judging from the style, it looked slightly like the hand gun used by Red-haired people, but the appearance was concise, without extra lines, nor a place to clip the match cord.

"This is a hand gun?"

"Exactly," seeing Magistrate Wu's face full of doubt, Huang Shoutong said this was picked up by militia when returning to the battlefield afterwards, probably lost by pirates in the melee.

"This, is what the militia said credible?" Magistrate Wu still didn't quite believe it. He was a literati, but in the last twenty years, literati and scholar-officials all liked to talk about soldiers and firearms. Although he hadn't seen real objects of various firelocks, he had seen drawings in books. This thing didn't touch the edge of any firelock, except that it also had a muzzle and a trigger.

(Note: In the late Ming Dynasty, there was a climax of discussion on firearms and gunpowder among intellectuals. Of course, most people just talked on paper. Song Yingxing criticized this trend in "Tiangong Kaiwu")

"Credible. This gun doesn't need loading powder. Pulling the trigger can fire." Huang Shoutong twisted his beard and said, "After bringing it back, I tried firing one shot. The power is quite considerable. It can penetrate thick wood at five zhang. But firing again didn't ignite. I guess multiple portions of ammunition are pre-stored in this gun. Pulling the trigger once fires one portion."

"That is truly an object of great power." Wu Mingjin looked at this small dark blue object in front of him, worried. If pirates had many such firelocks, how could the bows and arrows of militia and braves resist in field battles? It seemed that relying on cannons to defend the city was the best policy.

"I came to the county this time, firstly to warn, secondly to ask Grand Master to allocate some weapons."

He was now the group commander of the six-village joint protection. He had several hundred strong men under him, but weapons were scarce. Except for big and small leaders and some family guards having knives and spears, ordinary militia only had wooden sticks. Lingao lacked ironware originally, and weapons were even fewer. The knives and spears used by his family guards were left by ancestors many years ago. Although there were quite a few bows and arrows, the climate of Hainan itself was unfavorable to bows and arrows, and they were not handy to use.

Wu Mingjin couldn't refuse, so he allocated twenty waist knives, ten shields, forty tiger forks, and five iron spears from the armory to him. He also gave him some gunpowder and iron pellets - there were some iron cannons and gingals in Huang Family Stockade, only gunpowder was a prohibited item of the government and difficult to prepare.

Just as Huang Shoutong was about to take his leave to rest, the gatekeeper reported that the scout who went out for reconnaissance in the morning came back. Since the pirates landed, the county sent a batch of scouts every day to inquire about the situation. These people were local natives, familiar with the terrain and paths.

They dared not open the gate on the city wall, only lowered the prepared large basket to pull people up to the city. Scouts went out every day without damage. Coming back today, they were very panic-stricken. Seeing their appearance, the people on the city wall discussed spiritedly.

"What, building roads?" Magistrate Wu asked in surprise.

"Yes, Master." The scout knelt on the ground, peeking at the master secretly.

"Building from Bopu towards Bailaren Beach. There are markers along the way. Pirates heap earth to make roads. They have built almost five or six li."

"Five or six li of road, you didn't see wrong?!" Huang Shoutong rushed forward and asked pressingly.

"This small one didn't see wrong." The scout looked fearfully at this figure famous in Lingao.

Huang Shoutong was very astonished. He turned his head and arched his hands to report: "Grand Master, the militia of this stockade went to fight yesterday, and haven't seen roads along the way..."

Wu Mingjin nodded and said in a deep voice: "The matter of building roads is indeed seen with eyes, without exaggeration? If there is half a word of falsehood, will definitely not spare you!"

The scout kowtowed repeatedly: "This small one dare not deceive Master. Indeed road has been built for five or six li." He also said pirates had evil arts. Many carts could walk without wheels. There were huge iron arms on them, able to use giant shovels to dig earth. Soil like small hills could be dug out and moved easily... and many things he couldn't explain clearly... in a word, this group of people was full of evil spirit.

Now he was anxious. He didn't believe much in statements of supernatural power and chaos. Wu Mingjin came to Hainan to be an official. On the way in Guangdong, he had seen Portuguese big ships and cannons, and also seen telescopes. He knew overseas people had many strange and ingenious things. Who knew if this group of pirates would rely on some overseas strange things to attack the county seat? In Lingao city, besides runners and yamen runners, available were only eighty militia plus twelve archers returned from the inspection station, totaling just over one hundred people.

So he hurriedly asked Assistant Magistrate Wu Ya to take silver to the Rear Camp to move reinforcements. At this moment Wu Ya came back to report: The Chiliarch of the Rear Camp agreed, and would send thirty people and one cannon over tomorrow morning, only after the event, each person had to be given a reward of one shi of rice.

Originally, this beacon tower alarm, he didn't take it too seriously. Pirate harassment was already a common meal here. But the words Fu Bowan said when fleeing back with archers really scared him not lightly.

The pirates came in unprecedented "giant ships". The hull was higher than the Dacheng Hall of Lingao Confucian Temple. The following ships were each bigger than the warships of official troops. None used sails or oars, coming and going freely on the sea, like divine skills.

The most incredible thing was that those ships were actually made of iron! Iron giant ships floating on water, this greatly exceeded his understanding range. People have instinctive fear of things beyond their understanding.

When seeing these people really start landing, Fu Bowan hurriedly took people to run back to the county seat wildly - he instinctively predicted that these people were not the same thing as any pirates or merchants he had seen or heard of before. They couldn't have come to Lingao just to rob common people of a few piculs of salted fish and a few shi of rice!
Of course Wu Mingjin couldn't listen to his one-sided words only - warriors fear war, exaggeration is a common thing. In panic, he still sent a runner of Tanka origin familiar with the situation near Bopu in the county yamen to visit. When coming back at noon, that runner couldn't even speak smoothly. From his chaotic description, Grand Master Wu knew that this group of pirates had a large number, over a thousand. After landing, there were carts that could walk on the beach. The carts didn't harness horses or drive cattle. People sitting on them would go. Some carts could easily lift very very big iron boxes and move them around... and many things he couldn't explain clearly... in a word, this group of people was full of evil spirit.

Now he was anxious. He didn't believe much in evil arts and the like. Wu Mingjin came to Hainan to be an official, seeing Portuguese big ships and cannons in Guangdong on the way, and also seeing telescopes. He knew overseas people had many strange and ingenious things. Who knew if this group of pirates would rely on some overseas strange things to attack the county seat? In Lingao city, besides runners and yamen runners, available were only eighty militia plus twelve archers returned from the inspection station, totaling just over one hundred people.

So he hurriedly asked Assistant Magistrate Wu Ya to take silver to the Rear Camp to move reinforcements. At this moment Wu Ya came back to report: The Chiliarch of the Rear Camp agreed, and would send thirty people and one cannon over tomorrow morning, only after the event, each person had to be given a reward of one shi of rice.

Hesitating, he hurriedly ordered to invite officials in the county yamen, Liu Dalin and the Hundred Household coming for reinforcement. Everyone discussed countermeasures together. After listening to the situation from the scout and Great Household Huang, the officials and gentry in the hall were all silent. Originally they thought pirates landed, how bad could it be? At most looting common people and burning a few villages and markets. Since Song Dynasty, this county had never been captured whether by Li people riots or pirate looting. Some people even rejoiced that this group of pirates landed after Mid-Autumn. If it were the time when autumn grain came to market before the Beginning of Winter, the loss would probably be much heavier. However, bad news came one after another in these few days. First, scouts reported that the opponent set up a big camp in Bopu, unloading goods to the shore day and night. Then the Huang Family Stockade militia, known for bravery and daring to fight, was defeated. Now the pirates were actually building roads. No one could figure out what this group of short-haired people wanted to do.

Wu Mingjin looked at Liu Dalin who he relied on as a senior staff: "What does old gentleman think?"

Jinshi Liu supported his forehead with his hand, and said after a long time: "Grand Master, this matter has great danger."

Magistrate Wu and Wu Ya present were both startled. Magistrate Wu hurriedly arched his hands: "Please old gentleman teach me."

"I fear the intention of these short-haired pirates is to attack the city!"

"How do you see that?"

"Mountain bandits and sea pirates are mostly light-packed for plundering. Why need to build roads? If building roads, the only explanation is intending to attack the city. Dalin thinks pirates must carry siege equipment, very heavy, cannot be transported to the city without building roads."

Siege equipment that can only be transported to the city by building roads, how big and heavy must the object be? Everyone up and down was instantly silent. Wu Mingjin said tremblingly: "Could it be Red Barbarian Cannons..."

"Besides this, hard to think of other things."

Hainan is close to Guangdong and Macao. Red-haired barbarians' ships pass by from time to time. The matter of the imperial court buying big cannons from Red-haired people in Guangzhou was also heard in official circles. Wu Mingjin knew this cannon was very heavy, but its power was amazing. The imperial court used it for defense in Liaodong. The siege of Guangning last year was held fast relying on this cannon; it can be called a sharp weapon in the army.

If such a thing is pulled to the city now - Magistrate Wu dared not imagine what result it would have.

"What to do then? This county is just a small city." Wu Ya had already screamed in shock. Actually, the officials and gentry present understood his implication. What in this remote small city of Lingao was worth the pirates mobilizing so many troops? what sin did Lingao commit to attract such a killing weapon like Red Barbarian Cannon.

They didn't know at this time that what they were going to face were things more monstrous than Red Barbarian Cannons. Just as the storyteller in the Hundred Families Storytelling Field in Lingao city later said: "Tragedy!"

Everyone cast their eyes on Hundred Household Sun wearing a mandarin duck battle jacket. This hereditary Hundred Household originally thought this was a good errand. As soon as he arrived in the city and got off the horse, he received a reward of ten taels of silver. The reward issued by the county to the soldiers was scraped by him by half again. Wine and meat for every meal in these two days were much more comfortable than the half-dead days in the guard station. As for pirates attacking the city, he felt it was impossible.

Seeing the whole hall looking at him, he couldn't help panicking. He knew deeply that although he held the title of hereditary Hundred Household, he was actually a small landlord. The thirty big-headed soldiers brought along spent more days holding hoes than holding knives and guns. The only thing with a little power was that Folangji cannon. How could he come up with a countermeasure if asked? Besides, if the pirates really dragged Red Barbarian Cannons over, he wouldn't have time to flee for his life. Knowing saying anything was bad, he simply pretended to be calm and said nothing.

Magistrate Wu cursed Hundred Household Sun as a waste in his heart, but he didn't expect much from guard station soldiers originally. Probably this matter still had to ask General Tang to send troops.

"The plan for now is only the strategy of harassment." Liu Dalin said, "The short-haired thieves can't always gather together when building roads. We send more militia, promise heavy rewards, harass with bows and arrows, or set fire when there is a gap. Harassing day and night to make them restless. Will definitely stop their road building."
