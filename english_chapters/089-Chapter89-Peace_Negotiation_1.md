# Chapter 89 - Peace Negotiation (1)

Everyone came trembling to the earthen rampart. Seeing that although the camp gate was closed, there was no drawbridge on the trench, but the road surface was left directly without being dug off, they all felt strange. Actually, it was because the drawbridge didn't have such a large bearing capacity. Heavy machinery in the camp had to go in and out, so a drawbridge would be troublesome.

Outside one arrow shot distance, the comers all stopped and sent someone to call the gate. The people on the camp gate seemed to know they were coming; someone answered as soon as they called. Because Zhang Youfu often dealt with various pirates, he could speak some Mandarin, Guangzhou dialect, and Minnan dialect. However, the pirate on the camp gate spoke a weird Mandarin that was neither donkey nor horse. Fortunately, they could still communicate with each other. Zhang Youfu explained his intention. Not long after, there was a commotion on the camp gate, and the gate opened. More than ten people came out.

Zhang Youfu knew that kings on mountains or seas often liked to put on some airs to scare the negotiators and extort more property. he had seen this set of things a lot. However, this group of pirates had no ostentation. Only more than ten people came out, all ordinary figures in green short clothes, carrying bird guns with short swords on their backs. When he saw the leader in the middle, he was simply surprised: this person wore the same dark green short clothes and long trousers as other lackeys, a pair of gray short boots on his feet, and a leather belt around his waist. From the appearance, there was no difference from the surrounding lackeys. From his appearance, expression, speech, and behavior, he was also gentle and elegant, without a bit of the look of a hero of the greenwood.

Unexpectedly, the head of this 'Kun' bandit is so simple! Zhang Youfu couldn't help shouting in his belly.

The comer was very polite to them, introducing himself as Xi Yazhou, but did not invite them into the stockade. Ordered people to bring out many chairs and benches, placed them on the river beach in front of the camp gate, and invited them to sit. Someone also brought out many wooden bowls and wooden buckets from the stockade to invite the laborers to drink water.

The things brought to Zhang Youfu and the others made these local rich men stare wide-eyed: all were glass cups! Although they were on Hainan Island, they still understood the value of glass cups: two or three taels of shining silver could only buy a colored glass bowl, let alone such a crystal clear glass cup.

The thing in the cup was lackluster: a small white paper bag floating in the water, slowly dyeing the water light green. Sniffing it, it seemed to have a slight smell of tea, but it was very inferior.

The ostentation is really big! Zhang Youfu was both happy and worried. Happy that the 'Kun' bandits brought out such high-class things to entertain, they should be very sincere. Worried that their ostentation was so big, I'm afraid the price wouldn't be settled with a small number later.

This Xi Yazhou could speak some Guangzhou dialect, and they exchanged a few polite words. Then only heard another burst of roar inside the camp gate. A four-wheeled small car bumped over, causing a commotion among the people on the river beach—'Kun' bandits have cars that can move without oxen and horses. This strange thing had long spread throughout the city. Some said there was witchcraft in the car, driven by the power of ghosts and gods. Others said 'Kun' bandits obtained the art of creation of heaven and earth. Various sayings emerged one after another.

Zhang Youfu knew from spies and militia that those who sat in such covered cars were all big leaders among the 'Kun' bandits, so he knew the person in the car had a big background, and hurriedly stood up trembling.

The few people who got out of the car were dressed the same as the leader just now, with nothing special. Then saw a few more people walking over one after another. One of them, although having a shaved head, wore local local cloth clothes, probably a local captured who followed the bandits.

The Lingao dialect of Xiong Buyou, who served as a translator, sounded a bit weird to Zhang Youfu, but the meaning was very clear. Xi Yazhou explained that they were not pirates, but Chinese merchants residing overseas, engaged in industry and commerce, returning to the country to start a business this time—Xiao Zishan laughed secretly in his heart: when did we become "sea turtles" (returnees). Since arriving in Lingao, they had never harassed the common people or confronted the government. Then his tone became severe again, accusing the local "evil gentry" of organizing militia to attack without cause, causing them losses. They were forced to defend themselves and reserved the freedom to take further actions.

Zhang Youfu just said yes repeatedly, praising their practice of not disturbing the people profusely, and immediately presented the gift list. Listed on it were one hundred taels of fine silver, eight bolts of big red colored satin, twenty bolts of miscellaneous colored silk, twenty bolts of Songjiang cotton cloth, ten shi of coarse and fine grain in total, two pigs, four suckling pigs, one soup deer, and two hundred jin of wine. Xi Yazhou took the gift list and read it, then passed it to the other people sitting behind to read. Feeling the things were very useful, he smiled:
"We build a city in this area, disturbing the locality much, how dare we accept such heavy gifts. But not accepting would also let down the elegant intention of your gentry. Since so, we have to accept all. It is really disrespectful to refuse, but receiving it makes us feel ashamed."

Seeing him accept the gifts, Zhang Youfu took the opportunity to mention several requests of the gentry: First, the autumn harvest is imminent, hoping they won't loot the farming households and common people working; second, redeem those captured people; third, return the corpses of those killed in the last battle to each family for encoffining and burial.

Then he promised that if agreed, the gentry in the county were willing to "assist with grain and pay", in short, they wouldn't let them suffer losses. As for the specific number, everyone can talk again.

Xi Yazhou just nodded very politely without answering. The matter was significant. He looked inquiringly at Wen Desi and others behind. Several people winked, and they got up together to the duty room under the tower to discuss first. Everyone thought this matter involved future policy direction, and it was not very appropriate for a few people to decide. However, since the other party had the intention to ease tension, they also had to give a positive response.

Therefore, when Xi Yazhou came back, he directly agreed that each village stockade could send people and carts to dig up corpses. They would send people to direct the burial location directly. To show sincerity, they would also release a few disabled captives. As for the other two points, he said they had to discuss again, asking Zhang Youfu to come again every other day.

Zhang Youfu didn't plan to settle the matter at once originally. Seeing the other party agreed very readily to dig up corpses and even released a few captives, seeing it was giving him extreme face, the remaining things probably wouldn't be difficult, nothing more than the matter of high or low price. He didn't worry about this; anyway, it was borne by the gentry families. After negotiating this time, his reward wouldn't be small. And he could also establish a relationship with this group of 'Kun' bandits—he already faintly felt that this group of pirates was different from all the heroes going up the mountains and down the seas he had seen.

Before leaving, Xi Yazhou, following Wen Desi's instructions, gave back a fresh water pearl necklace originally priced at twenty-five RMB to Zhang Youfu, and gave fifty wen of reward money to each porter. Everyone from top to bottom was satisfied with this group of strange people.

Magistrate Wu and the officials and gentry of the whole city were anxiously waiting for Zhang Youfu's reply. In the afternoon, seeing him come back with people, passing the word that 'Kun' bandits were willing to return corpses and also willing to release a few captives back. Also hearing Zhang Youfu say that the few leaders looked like steady and simple people without any bandit habits. All beyond everyone's expectations.

In the past, even if the bandits killed the kidnapped hostages, relatives had to pay a considerable ransom to retrieve the corpses for burial. This time they agreed so readily. So each village hurriedly went to recruit laborers, rush-make thin-skinned coffins, and prepare to go together tomorrow to collect corpses. Because Magistrate Wu felt guilty that many people died in each stockade, he also asked the county's benevolent hall to go collect corpses together. If there were unclaimed ones, collect them back together.

The next day, laborers from various village stockades harnessed carts, carrying coffins, reed mats, and many lime bags, went over together. Here people were arranged to lead the way, pointing out the graveyard, then hurriedly withdrew. Only people were asked to monitor from a distance with high-power binoculars. The Health Team measured the wind direction and thought it wouldn't blow the smell over, but everyone still put on masks coincidentally.

Xi Yazhou led a few people to monitor on the watchtower. Through binoculars, laborers with faces and hands wrapped in cloth could be seen digging, moving soil-stained objects aside from time to time. Every time a corpse was moved out, some women, children, and elderly would pounce on it to examine and identify the corpse. Some cried to heaven and earth, some fainted on the ground. After watching for a while, he also felt he couldn't stand it anymore. Fighting and killing people, he never felt it was a big deal, but the miserable scene after the war really made people panic.

"Just cremated them all at the beginning, why bury in soil? The appearance is too miserable." Xi Yazhou knew those corpses had been buried for more than ten days. Dug out, except for looking at clothes, basically they were rotten beyond recognition.

"Burning corpses would incur resentment," Xiao Zishan refused to put his eyes on the binoculars all the time, "Wouldn't that become crushing bones and scattering ashes? Now family members can still collect the corpse, burial for peace can make them feel slightly better more or less. This counts as buying people's hearts."

Originally regarding how to deal with corpses after the war, the Health Team, out of consideration for health and epidemic prevention, suggested either setting up pyres in the wild to cremate, or transporting all to Bopu to throw into the sea. Most people agreed with such opinions. Yu Eshui opposed. He proposed: Ancient people valued the corpses of the deceased very much. "Collecting corpses and bones" has historically been a manifestation of benevolence and righteousness. If the corpses were destroyed like this, it would greatly damage the image of transmigrators—after all, this place would be their base in the future.

Therefore, finally, they were collected and buried in a place far away from the camp. Originally thought it was just a saying, didn't expect that among the three conditions proposed by the negotiators from the county, the third one was collecting corpses. Many remarks originally questioning why Yu Eshui, this person who talked big and liked to make shocking statements, occupied a seat in the Executive Committee, disappeared completely after this.

After tossing for a day, various villages finally collected and transported the corpses away. Some deceased, because they were "waste" in the village and sent to die, naturally had no one to collect them after death. Finally, they were all encoffined and transported away by the county's benevolent hall and buried in the public cemetery.
