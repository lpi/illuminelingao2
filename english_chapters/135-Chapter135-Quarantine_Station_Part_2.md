# Chapter 135: Quarantine Station (Part 2)

Supervising women's Purification was Qian Shuiting's wife Ai Beibei from the North American contingent. In America she'd been an epidemiologist—really unsuited for such "Purification" work. She was called to supervise simply because she was the Medical Group's only female doctor. Seeing this heaven-shaking wailing, the normally domestic woman was immediately flustered, anxiously soothing: "Don't be scared, don't be scared. It's just haircuts—for hygiene reasons—"

But the women completely ignored her. Crying was contagious. Wails filled the quarantine station sky. The temporary workers naturally showed no tenderness, continuing their head-shaving. Ai Beibei stamped her feet frantically, repeatedly admonishing the rough-handling female workers: "Be gentler! Don't frighten them!"

Female temporary workers had no such scruples. Payment was half a *liang* of rice per shave—everyone rushed to earn more. Under such rapid, efficient action, all fifty-three women young and old were quickly shaved smooth, revealing bluish scalps. Workers then hurried to the men's side to continue their money-making.

Apparently realizing wailing was useless—or perhaps exhausted—the sounds gradually subsided. Someone opened the stocks, driving them onward to the bathhouses.

The quarantine station bathhouse had required Engineering's considerable creativity. Pressurized supply still used water towers. Water came from filtered settling pools beside the Wenlan River—simple sand-and-stone filtering. Bamboo pipes; the simplest lever-style faucets. Lacking seals meant constant leakage—solved by installing separate gate valves on the tower, closing them when no one bathed, preventing wasteful seepage.

Bathrooms were divided male and female, with a wooden wall partition between. Each side had twenty shower stations. No showerheads—water poured directly from bamboo pipes. Wooden plank flooring; drainage ditches on the sides. Naturally, this wastewater didn't go to treatment plants—it was discharged straight to sea.

Guo Sanniang followed the crowd into this large, long building. Damp and humid inside. Crisscrossing bamboo pipes of various sizes. The female manager—this beautiful, authoritative woman must be a favored housekeeper—gestured at them, speaking unintelligibly. Then a maid beside her announced in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Minnan dialects: remove clothes; prepare to bathe!

Women began shrieking again. Bathing was normal for southerners—but stripping naked together was unprecedented. Some better-bred girls even crouched, covering their faces, absolutely refusing to undress.

Bathroom chaos again halted work. Ai Beibei was helpless—having exhausted every possible explanation and comfort—discovering nobody listened, or understood. Chuyu—the Gou Manor maid who'd defected to the transmigrators—saw this female short-hair at wit's end. She stepped forward, respectfully asking: "Madam, may this servant handle it?"

Ai Beibei wiped her forehead: "Hmm? Sure. By the way—I've told you many times—don't call yourself 'servant.' Here everyone's equal—"

"Yes." Chuyu acknowledged, knowing this female short-hair was spouting equality nonsense again. She neither understood nor wanted to understand. Her thinking was simple: exert her abilities before the short-hair masters to eventually secure a position like production team leader. Since arriving at the team, she'd diligently studied Mandarin—advancement required speaking the masters' language.

Chuyu took an iron megaphone and bellowed with full-body strength:

"SILENCE!"

Chuyu's roar nearly shook the walls. Even Ai Beibei's ears rang. Nobody imagined this slender girl could produce such a piercing sound. Instantly, everyone stopped—mouths shut.

She turned to face Ai Beibei, seeing this female short-hair also dumbstruck. She realized: her actions had caused this.

"Clothes—all—off!" Chuyu continued bellowing. "Those who don't—dragged out for household punishment!" Her whip cracked through the air.

Ai Beibei disliked this prison-style performance but knew sometimes crude simplicity was more effective than patient persuasion. She nodded, slipping outside.

Tian Sanniang followed everyone, quickly stripping. No more embarrassment—everyone covering chests and privates, trembling, heads lowered, not daring to view others' pale bodies.

Suddenly the overhead horizontal bamboo pipes began spraying water, raining down on them, carrying unpleasant smells. Scattered startled cries arose—but under Chuyu's fierce gaze, they quickly subsided. Female temporary workers brought a basket of soap pods. Temporary workers grabbed them in pairs, fast-processing: rinsing, soap-pod scrubbing, merciless large-bristle brush scrubbing. Nobody dared protest. Quiet sobbing rose and fell.

Guo Sanniang was scrubbed head to toe. Her skin hurt as if being stripped. Crying while bathing—momentarily thinking her skin was being scrubbed off. But those falling flakes were actually years of accumulated grime. After being deemed clean, a worker led her to another room. The manager woman wore a white gown—strange, had someone in the household died?

"Drink water." The manager woman's attitude was gentle, handing over a porcelain bowl. Guo Sanniang obediently drank—sweet, but with bitter undertones. Then she lay on a white-cloth-covered couch, her entire body examined by the manager woman—even her private parts and rear—Guo Sanniang felt both shamed and terrified, completely confused. She surrendered to the handling.

The manager woman examined her and told a nearby worker: "XS!" Then from a shelf she retrieved a cotton cloth outfit. Unexpectedly, new clothes—unlike wealthy households that gave new servants old clothes. Indigo-colored; coarse-textured but clean and soft. The style was peculiar—like a monk's bell-robe. Slipped on; head and limbs protruding. Slightly oversized; the waist belt could be tightened. Footwear: wooden clogs.

Dressed, the manager woman gave her a small rattan box, then examined the bamboo tag at her neck and a clipboard.

"Number 1628020014. Personal item: one broken-toothed comb." She announced loudly. A worker retrieved a steamer basket with a matching bamboo tag—inside was her comb, still damp.

When men and women reconvened behind the bathhouse, Tian Sanwu struggled to identify Guo Sanniang—all identical bald heads in blue uniforms. Without careful scrutiny, even gender was indistinguishable. Some secretly laughed—truly comical.

"Maybe the master's a monk?" Someone muttered. They lined up before several wooden buildings.

"What's your name? Liu Sanba?" The questioner appeared scholarly, though wearing short-hair button-front shirts. Tian Sanwu noticed his hair was stubble-short—clearly receiving the same treatment. Why did masters enjoy shaving servants bald? Tian Sanwu couldn't understand.

"How many Lius is this?"

"Chief—this is the fourth."

"Change to Liu Si!"

"Understand? You're Liu Si now!"

"Thank you, Master, for the name—" This somewhat clever person tried kowtowing for a tip but was already dragged aside.

"Your name—Tian Sanwu?" The questioner Zhang Xingjiao checked the list. "Chief—no Tians yet. Call him Tian Da?"

"No creativity. Tian Liang is better."

"Remember—you're Tian Liang now!" Zhang Xingjiao registered the name.

Newly minted Tian Liang was bewildered, but masters renaming servants was natural. Better than "Sanwu" anyway.

Registered people stood by tables. Tian Liang craned toward the women's side, finally locating Guo Sanniang in the crowd. Seeing nobody forbade talking, he quietly approached: "Sanniang, are you okay?"

Guo Sanniang, seeing this companion of over a year now bald too, imagined her own appearance. Mixed emotions. Wanting to cover her bare scalp—having nothing. Red-faced, she nodded quietly: "Okay. Just the hair—hair—"

"Under others' eaves, heads must bow. Even life belongs to others—what's some hair?"

"Did masters rename you too?"

Guo Sanniang nodded: "Changed. First, some short-hair insisted on calling me Guo Jinjin—but someone else refused. Now it's Guo Fu."
