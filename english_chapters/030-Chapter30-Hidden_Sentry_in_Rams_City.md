# Chapter 30 - Hidden Sentry in Rams City

Chapter 30 Hidden Sentry in Rams City

From the beginning, the Executive Committee regarded the two children of the Gao family as the focus of work. Once an adult's concept is formed, it is difficult to change. In contrast, children's thinking is active, they have a natural contempt for authority, are easily moved by novel things, love adventure, and are eager to prove that they have abilities no less than adults - these are all things Transmigrators can utilize.

Every time they traveled, they spent a lot of time with the two children to observe their personality and ability. Compared to Gao Colgate, Gao Di as a boy was more valuable - girls had a small social circle and rarely had the opportunity to show their faces. Gao Di was younger, and the plasticity of his concept and personality was much greater than his sister.

Gao Di was intelligent and clever. Xiao Zishan taught him some accounting and arithmetic methods, and he learned them as soon as he was taught. Sometimes Wen Desi specially asked him to do a few small things, and he could handle them properly. When rewarded with some modern candies and snacks, he would always take them back to share with his sister, showing that his character was not greedy or selfish, and he was a responsible person.

Entering the study, they saw the pair of siblings kneeling straight on the ground. Bei Wei raised his eyebrows, seemingly about to get angry. Wen Desi knew he couldn't stand this, so he hurriedly stopped him.

"Get up. Why kneel here for no reason? Do you treat us as City God Masters?" Wen Desi raised his hand with a slight smile.

"Please Masters forgive the crime of the slaves' mother." The two children didn't get up, saying together and kowtowing together.

"Already said before, those who don't know are not guilty," Wen Desi said, "You both get up."

"Thank Masters for grace." The siblings looked at each other, showing joy on their faces, and hurriedly stood up.

"Gao Colgate, you go out first. Have words to say with Gao Di."

"This slave knows." Gao Colgate responded briskly and retreated. Bei Wei stood up, walked to the window, and nodded only after seeing Gao Colgate had retreated.

Xiao Zishan asked: "Familiar with Guangzhou city?"

"Familiar. Before, people in the Gao residence often sent me to run errands, giving a few coins each time."

"Those partners asked about just now, still often play together now?"

"Several were selected for errands. The others are resting at home with nothing to do, often asking me out to play."

"Are there reliable people inside?"

Gao Di raised his head suddenly: "Master wants to accept family servants?"

Indeed a smart child. Xiao Zishan nodded secretly.

"Not needed yet," he deliberately kept the words flexible, "This is not the same thing as selecting family servants, but also somewhat related."

"Then please Master instruct, what kind of people are needed."

"Need a few children familiar with Guangzhou city. Report news and market prices on the street every day," Xiao Zishan told him one by one which commodity prices were needed according to the content discussed in advance.

"This is easy. Just go to the tea houses of various trades to look at the water signs."

"Compile these things into a book every day. Do it well according to the bookkeeping method I taught you."

"This small one understands."

"Give you an extra tael of silver every month as activity fee. People are chosen by you. Must pick carefully. Unreliable ones, ones who love to talk nonsense, don't want any. In addition, pay attention to news of the Gao family at all times." Xiao Zishan stared tightly into his eyes, "Don't write down if there is anything. Wait for us to come and say it to listen."

Xiao Zishan said a sentence, and Gao Di responded a sentence. He saw some fear on this boy's face, but excitement was overflowing in his words and expressions.

"Does your family have friendly people in the Gao residence?"

"Yes, Uncle Chang, my dad's sworn brother. Doing odd jobs in the outer house." He said a lot of miscellaneous things. This Gao Chang was his dad's fellow villager, thrown into the mansion for six or seven years. He had great strength and a little martial arts, originally could be selected as a guard, but spoke too straight, and had no money to honor the steward, causing disfavor from above. Doing odd jobs until twenty-five or six, couldn't even match a rough servant girl.

"Is he a bachelor?"

"Yes, but Uncle Chang is very open-minded, doesn't complain much."

Several people looked at each other. This was a suitable development target: People frustrated in the original unit would be happy to change jobs; speaking straight means the person is upright and without schemes; not complaining shows this person's mentality is peaceful; finally, having great strength and martial arts is also useful.

Of course, these words were said by his nephew, inevitably having over-praise. But now is the time to use people, no need to be too picky. Besides, whether the person is suitable or not, will only be known after using.

"Want to summon Uncle Chang over? He is not on duty today."

"Okay, you go invite him."

"I'll just say dad invites him to drink wine, he will naturally come."

High comprehension. Without instructing confidentiality, he understood tacitly. However, this child is so smart, if not controlled well in the future, he might be a scourge instead. Xiao Zishan's thoughts were always relatively dark.

Not long after, Gao Chang came. Introduced by Gao Di, he came over to kowtow and meet. Looking at him, he was not tall, his physique was quite robust, and his movements were quite flexible.

Xiao Zishan only asked about his background and serving in the Gao family.

"...Doing odd jobs in the outer house for six years." Gao Chang reported.

"I see you are dignified in appearance, and your skills are not bad. Why always do odd jobs?"

"This small one is born clumsy, can't speak well, therefore always do odd jobs."

"Ever married?"

"No..." Gao Chang blushed, "Too poor, no woman willing to follow me."

"You served their family for these years, the Gao family didn't assign a maid to you?"

"Really this small person is too poor. Even if assigned a woman, afraid can't keep her."

Xiao Zishan thought this person was good. The master family had no grace to him, and he didn't say a bad word about the master family in front of outsiders.

"How does the Gao family treat you?"

"This small one is a mere servant. The master family giving clothes to wear and food to eat is grace." Speaking neither humble nor arrogant, advancing and retreating freely.

Xiao Zishan glanced at Bei Wei. This former scout jumped up suddenly and pushed forcefully. Gao Chang was caught off guard and fell back fiercely, retreating seven or eight steps before standing firm. Although full of astonishment, he only straightened his clothes and continued to stand with hands down.

Bei Wei nodded. This person's lower body was very stable. Indeed had Kung Fu on him.

"You know martial arts?" Xiao Zishan asked.

"Country Kung Fu, practiced for self-defense and fitness. Made Masters laugh."

Xiao Zishan nodded, didn't ask more, and asked Gao Di to send him out to drink wine.

Gao Di retreated. The result of this interview was that everyone was quite satisfied, but how to recruit this person needed another way. Several people discussed the work to be carried out in Guangzhou city next. Currently, they had developed the first intelligence network. The function of this intelligence network was not to collect any intelligence, but just to see if Gao Di was usable in such a role, and similarly to verify if the Gao family would be loyal.

If Gao Qing obstinately continued to be Master Gao's spy, then the next step would be to find new people as soon as possible.

"I feel Gao Qing's attitude towards Master Gao is also ambiguous." Bei Wei said, "Looking at his wife and children, they don't look like being dead set."

"I agree with this statement." Wen Desi nodded, "Gao Qing is just intimidated by Gao Ju's power. Actually, he has not much loyalty to this old master."

"Actually, what he fears more is to follow us leaving his native land. We are now wearing the title of Australian maritime merchants. He is not from Guangdong and Fujian where people are used to going overseas."

"We win over his wife and children first. After today, he will think carefully before going to report in the future."

"Will he still go?"

"I think he will, just much less. Gao Qing is timid and has no opinion. The accumulated prestige of the old master is still there. He still has the idea of leaving a way out. Before leaving Gao Ju's sphere of influence, this person cannot be trusted."

"We must have our own house as soon as possible."

"Right. At present we seek trade convenience, but before the final crossing, we must get a new house."

"Gao Di is not bad, pity he is a child. Can't do things like buying houses and servants."

"What about Gao Chang..."

"Someone!" Bei Wei shouted suddenly, flashed to the window, picked up a stone from the bonsai and threw it out. A muffled sound outside. Seemed to hit something.

Three city otaku panicked for a moment, collapsing on chairs daring not to breathe aloud.

"What happened?" Wen Desi asked tremblingly.

"A black shadow flashed past the opposite corner of the courtyard." Bei Wei said indignantly, "Coming to infiltrate and reconnaissance before dark, so bold."

"Eavesdropping?"

"Should be." Bei Wei said, "The route was tortuous towards under the window."

"Is it Gao Ju's man?"

"Unlike. Gao Ju already has eyes and ears here. We do business with him so smoothly, he has no need to do such things that would anger us."

"Then who could it be?"

"I'm afraid it's those who are jealous of him." Xiao Zishan thought of what Gao Ju said when giving them the house: "Only recently these rare goods came to market, I receive quite a lot of attention here". This should be those "concerned" people.

Things became more complicated. Associating with Gao Ju's restless appearance today, their thoughts were a bit tense.
