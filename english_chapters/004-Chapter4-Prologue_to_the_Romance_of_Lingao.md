In those days, the Yuan Emperor wallowed in folly, and the realm was in upheaval. The people could barely survive; officials flayed them raw. Spring and autumn exactions, ceaseless warfare, refugees everywhere—throughout the lands of China, banditry flourished, heresies multiplied beyond counting. Add to this the yearly calamities and strange omens never before heard of: a white rainbow piercing the sun, winter thunder booming like drums, serpents and flood-dragons emerging amidst black rains, wolves and jackals appearing alongside swarms of locusts. Floods in the south, drought in the north—living creatures utterly devastated. Such misery as the mortal realm endured, what pen could describe it?

A great famine struck within the passes of Guanzhong, and the people seethed in anguish. Master Yunzhuang was appointed Censor-in-Chief of the Shaanxi Circuit to govern the northwest. From the day he took office, he never once sat in his yamen. Instead, he rode his cart everywhere, distributing food whenever he encountered the starving. He exhausted his family fortune, yet it was not enough to help one in ten thousand. He observed that no chickens or dogs could be heard, that human habitation had ceased to exist. Moreover, he learned that among the common people there were those who killed their own children to feed their mothers, or who swapped children with one another to eat. Unable to restrain his grief, he composed this song.

The voice of this song was fierce and mighty, its spirit unquenchable. It happened to reach the ears of a certain Immortal. This Immortal, having cultivated the Dao since Tang times, had long ceased to trouble himself over the rise and fall of the mortal dust and the waste and ruin of the Central Plains. Yet upon hearing this verse, melancholy stirred within him. He could not help but cast the divination of King Wen to determine the heavenly mandate. Ten days later, his furrowed brow eased into joy, and he laughed aloud: "Never mind, never mind—I see I have worried too much. A great transformation of all under heaven is nigh, within a mere decade."

His disciple asked, "Master, what do you mean?"

The Immortal replied: "You have trained with me for several years. Just now I cast the divination and learned that you have your own destiny ordained by heaven. Pack your belongings and journey to the south of the Yangtze."

The disciple, puzzled, asked: "What am I to do in Jiangnan?"

The Immortal said: "Ask no questions. The rise and fall of empires is at hand. In Jiangnan, a rough-hewn emperor will seek you out. That rough-hewn emperor is the founder of a coming dynasty. His house will command the fate of the realm of China. Your destiny lies therein. Go now, go!"

Within the turn of a few years, the situation rotted away entirely. Beacon fires blazed in every direction, worse than before. One band of heroes—resolute, brave, and fierce—fought their way from south to north. Beneath their banners were elite soldiers like the sea and fierce generals like clouds. With counselors and Immortals to aid them, they swept across the realm and pacified all within the four corners. No emperor of any previous dynasty had risen from such humble origins. They established their capital in Nanjing, named the dynasty "Great Ming," and thereby laid three hundred years of magnificent foundation.

The momentum of all-under-heaven: what has been united must divide. After that rough-hewn emperor departed, generation after generation of his descendants proved unworthy. Within not even a hundred years, the realm was already in decline. The Immortal shook his head: "If such is the nation's fate, what can be done?"

Another hundred years passed. The Immortal observed the heavens at night, watching the purple aura scatter eastward, the baleful Mars in disarray, the Daylight Star casting its glare. Then he saw the southern sector's ruling mansion fall vacant, the Daylight Star shatter. Then he saw the Polar Star surge northward, the surrounding stars grow dim, the Wolf Star pierce the sky, the Vermillion Bird overstep its bounds. Such conflicting configurations had not been seen in a thousand years. Inside, the Immortal trembled with dread; his spirit grew haggard. Unable to perceive the heavenly Dao, he said in fear: "The celestial court is in chaos beyond all precedent. Within five hundred years there must be cataclysmic change—I fear it bodes ill for us. To transcend by cultivation and refining, I must act beforehand."

Thereafter the Immortal paid no heed to worldly matters. He dismissed his disciples and devoted himself wholly to cultivation. But before even sixty years passed, still fearing that cataclysmic turn, he calmed himself and computed the heavenly numbers. In an instant his brow smoothed, and he said: "Ah, so it is merely another change of masters in the Central Plains—another era of chaos like the Five Barbarians or the Mongol Yuan. The Polar Star grows strong and comes from the east; this dynasty's mandate should grant me another two or three hundred years."

Just as he was musing, in an instant all the stars lost their light, and the universe plunged into darkness. Then the stars burst into flame and the vault of heaven itself burned. Then the purple aura scattered and gathered by turns, coalescing like a great sword. The Heavenly Leader's Palace and the Earthly Palace both split asunder. The Literary Star and Martial Star flickered in and out, sometimes vanishing, sometimes blazing across the sky. The Star of Nobility and Star of Longevity now fell silent as the void, now swelled and exploded. All the surrounding constellations were like boiling water cast upon snow, or like willow catkins scattered by wind—they vanished without a trace.

In that chaos, five hundred and more stars of generals and emperors blazed and flew, searing eyes and ears. Where the celestial court had stood was now as if the sun hung at high noon: under heaven there remained no place of shadow. Even the farthest reaches of east and west were dazzlingly bright. All the ancient constellations and heavenly measure had been devoured; every configuration had been shattered.

The Immortal, struck with terror, trembled and shook, his liver and gall splitting with fear, his soul and spirit scattering. He computed upon his fingers again, examined the heavenly signs, extrapolated the numbers of fate—and once more all was as it had always been, no different.

Still in shock, the Immortal said to himself: "So it seems the cataclysm is already upon us. I fear the land of the Divine Province, from this moment forth, shall be overturned utterly. The Dao of antiquity shall be subverted. Hereafter there will be no method by which our kind may cultivate, nor any ground on which we may stand. If I remain here, I fear heavenly punishment awaits."

With that, the Immortal ascended and departed from this world.
