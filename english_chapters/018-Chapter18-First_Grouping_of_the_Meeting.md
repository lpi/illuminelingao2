# Chapter 18 - First Grouping of the Meeting

Chapter 18 Meeting - First Grouping

Xiao Zishan had set his sights on those small coastal cities from the very beginning. After half a month of rushing about, he finally rented a county maritime militia training base in a certain place.

The base rented by the Time Travel Company was a training camp built during the era when everyone was a soldier. It had been empty for a long time after the great disarmament. Because it was located in a hilly area, except for a small port for sea training, it was surrounded by mountains on almost all sides, and transportation was inconvenient. The only road was poorly maintained because it was of little value.

This place was remote, with few idlers, making it easy to avoid people's eyes and ears. Although facilities such as barracks, warehouses, and playgrounds were a bit dilapidated, they were basically complete. Because the location of this place was really too bad, the County People's Armed Forces Department had long been uninterested in it, so the rent asked was very low. The only additional condition was that two retired employees who guarded the gate must continue to be employed. Xiao Zishan agreed readily - they took turns living in the reception room for a week each, and apart from watching the gate and sweeping the floor, they didn't care about other things.

First, a cleaning company was found to clean the base inside and out. Then a renovation company was found to repair the broken glass, blocked water pipes, etc. Because this place was currently still a reserve barrack of the People's Armed Forces Department, the equipment inside was still considered complete. After cleaning and supplementing some things, they could move in directly.

The Time Travel Company moved to this place on a certain day. As for the office in Guangzhou, Wen Desi still kept it. After all, the company's registered address was there.

After having the base, the first batch of key personnel began to report one after another. These were all circled one by one by Wen Desi from the applicants after long-term contact. Basically, they were all experts in various fields.

Many people were full of doubts when they arrived, and quite a few simply thought this was a scam.

When they saw piles of RMB, Ming Dynasty porcelain and that wormhole flashing with strange light, they realized it was true.

Some fled immediately, unable to accept it - this was too crazy.

Some pondered for a few days and still left.

Some burst out with irrepressible excitement and devoted their all fanatically.

Some remained calm in the face of changes, simply registered, settled down and joined the work.

A team needed by a time travel organization was thus preliminarily established.

In order to facilitate management and division of labor, the committee decided to convene all personnel who had reported so far to hold a general meeting to reconstruct the time travel organization.

As for what kind of polity will be adopted after the future crossing, this issue cannot be discussed for the time being. After all, the participants have not all arrived, and it is inconvenient to set up a power organ before holding a general assembly to discuss it. So the purpose of the meeting was limited to setting up a structure equivalent to an administrative department.

The meeting was held in the large conference room of the base. The conference room was large enough to accommodate the nearly fifty attendees. Although the tables and chairs were old, they were still usable. Xiao Zishan also found many porcelain tea cups from the cabinet, saving even disposable paper cups. The only added thing was a whiteboard.

Xiao Zishan took out a voice recorder and turned it on to test it.

"I suggest manual recording." A young woman stood up, "It's uncomfortable to organize meeting minutes by listening to recordings. I type Wubi very fast. Let me do it."

"You are?"

Recently, there were dozens of strangers all at once, and Xiao Zishan didn't recognize them. This woman was thin and small, not beautiful, but her limbs were flexible, obviously a woman who loved sports.

"I am Li Yiwo's girlfriend, named Li Yuanyuan. I used to be a secretary, and taking meeting minutes is a piece of cake."

Xiao Zishan knew this Li Yiwo. He also studied machining, a fanatical gun enthusiast, a gun friend of Zhan Wuya, belonging to the type of person who didn't let out a fart in half a day. Xiao Zishan guessed that the reason he wanted to time travel was just to make guns without restrictions.

This young girl also followed him. "Follow you to the ends of the earth if I love you" seemed not to be empty words. Thinking of this, Xiao Zishan couldn't help feeling sour.

"Okay, but keep the voice recorder on too."

Li Yuanyuan brought a netbook, typed in the time and date casually, and then turned to Xiao Zishan.

"Please start."

Xiao Zishan cleared his throat.

"Although everyone recognizes each other, it's the first time gathering together. I will announce the meeting norms first.

"This meeting will discuss each topic one by one according to the agenda. Do not digress before the discussion of a new topic begins.

"The meeting may last for a long time. For discussion topics not in one's profession or not interested in, one may leave. Leaving is after the end of each topic and before the start of a new topic. Or the break time announced by the meeting host.

"After the end of each topic, the meeting host will ring the bell once, and then wait for three minutes before starting a new topic. Those willing to re-enter must enter during this period.

"Raise hand to speak. Only start after obtaining the host's consent.

"Speeches must be about the matter, and must not involve comments on other speakers.

"That's all," Xiao Zishan looked at the Transmigrators sitting around, smiled and nodded, "Next, we invite President Wen to first introduce the progress of the current time travel preparation activities."

President Wen stood up, coughed, and a room full of dark crowds stared at him.

"Regarding the current time travel status, I will first give an introduction."

Speaking, Wen Desi gave a brief introduction to the current status of the wormhole, the situation of time travel trade, contact with Ming people, and profits. Just after the introduction, someone asked to speak.

"My name is Jin Keshou. I suggest President Wen not to resell porcelain anymore. I know a little about the circle of cultural relics: they are quite independent and familiar. It doesn't matter if you sell a few pieces now. If you sell continuously, in a few days the circle of the whole province or even the whole country will know. This is very unfavorable for our secrecy. I'm afraid it will alarm the cultural relics protection unit then."

Wen Desi leaned forward, very concerned. He indeed didn't know much about the cultural relics circle: "Then what's your suggestion?"

"Medicinal materials." He said, "Many precious medicines in traditional Chinese medicinal materials are now extremely scarce and the price is very high. For example, rhinoceros horn, natural bezoar, musk, these."

"Forget about rhinoceros horn, it will definitely attract the Administration for Industry and Commerce." Someone raised an objection, "But precious spices can also be considered."

"Okay, this suggestion is accepted. Try it in the next trade."

"The next topic is industrial. First, let's start with energy..." Xiao Zishan was speaking when he suddenly saw Ma Qianzhu raise his hand, "What's the matter?"

"Should we set up the administrative structure first and divide into different professional groups? This way it will be more convenient to speak."

"Hmm, I agree." Wang Luobin said, "Otherwise it's clueless to talk."

"Then first is the agricultural group," a sturdy man stood up, "I am Wu Nanhai, graduated from XX Agricultural University. Food is the first necessity of the people. The problem of eating is our primary task."

"Okay, Agricultural Group." Xiao Zishan wrote the first group on the whiteboard.

"Industrial Group!" "Transportation Group!" "Ministry of Geology!" "Ministry of Railways!" "Highway Bureau" "Time Travel Mobile!" "Aviation Commission!" "Military Group!" "Army Ministry!" "Navy Ministry!" "Urban Management Bureau!" "Cheka!" "Development and Reform Commission!"...

Seeing the grouping starting to turn into a spoof, Xiao Zishan had to stop their surging passion:
"Okay, okay, grouping is mainly for the preparation work of time travel. How to set up institutions after opening the base is another matter. Don't think too complicatedly." He smiled, "We haven't crossed yet, let's not engage in the promotion map set first."

Everyone laughed. After a while, the following groups were divided:

Eight professional groups: Industry, Agriculture, Construction, Energy, Communication, Sports, IT, and Intelligence Data. Besides professional groups, two support groups, General Affairs and Procurement, were set up. The General Affairs Group is responsible for arranging and coordinating personnel contact, reporting and registration work, as well as the daily life of all Transmigrators and the operation of the institution; Procurement is responsible for purchasing various equipment and materials according to the procurement list.

Each group recommends relevant persons in charge, and the persons in charge of each group form a temporary Executive Committee. A coordination meeting is held once a week to coordinate the operation of various departments. When needed, it can also be held temporarily.

Wen Desi unsurprisingly became the Chairman of the Executive Committee. Originally Zhan Wuya wanted to recommend Wang Luobin as the leader of the Industrial Group, but Wang Luobin declined, saying he was not professional enough in mechanics, so finally Zhan Wuya became the leader.

The leader of the General Affairs Group was ignored by everyone. Big guys didn't want to do it. Managing eating, drinking, pissing and shitting, and managing personnel, too trivial. If it were an ordinary enterprise unit, at least there would be plenty of oil and water. The problem is they will cross in a year. No matter how many banknotes are saved, they are all waste paper, and finally have to be contributed to the organization.

Xiao Zishan hinted at Wen Desi, and then Wen Desi nominated him, and he obtained the position of the leader of the General Affairs Group.

Xiao Zishan's idea was simple: He had no professional skills. The stage of preparing for time travel was inevitably a period when the technical party would display their skills and their voice would rise. Using this position to keep himself in the management layer was the best. In the next institutional reorganization, he would have enough political qualifications.

However, in order to avoid suspicion as much as possible, upon Xiao Zishan's proposal, a Finance Section directly under the committee was set up within the committee, responsible for funding income, allocation and audit.

After grouping, a chaotic sound of pulling stools and changing seats immediately rang out in the conference room. No one proposed, each group sat in groups. The new group leaders looked around, already feeling quite like leaders.

In contrast, the team of the General Affairs Group was basically a women's detachment. The first batch who came were all technical backbones, so those under the banner of the General Affairs Group were girlfriends and wives brought by these backbones - and an auntie, the mother of a female technician - pity the hearts of parents in the world...

Xiao Zishan began to have a headache about how to get along with the women's detachment in the future. What's more terrible was that these were all "other people's women". He secretly reminded himself to be careful to avoid suspicion.
