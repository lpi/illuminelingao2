# Chapter 360 - The Foshan Journey (Part 9)

Yang Shixiang tried to convince Yang Shiyi to allow his prepared medicines to be sold at Yang Runkai Hall, but Yang Shiyi was evasive about that matter. He suggested instead that Yang Shixiang's medicines could be sold at "Gongjitang."

"Gongjitang?" Yang Shixiang's face darkened.

Liu San noticed his reaction and asked softly: "What's wrong with Gongjitang?"

"It's..." Yang Shixiang seemed reluctant to explain in front of his cousin.

Yang Shiyi had already left to attend to other matters, promising to have the ingredients prepared. While they waited, Liu San took the opportunity to browse around the pharmacy, observing its operations. Yang Shixiang sat in the reception room looking dejected.

A young shop assistant approached Liu San—apparently hoping to make a sale to this well-dressed customer.

"Sir, are you looking for anything particular? We have the finest Liaodong ginseng, aged deer antler, premium amber..."

"Just looking." Liu San smiled. "Actually, I'm curious about something. What is Gongjitang? Is it another pharmacy?"

The assistant glanced around before answering in a lowered voice. "Gongjitang is a branch of Yang Runkai Hall, sir. It's co-owned with the shop's senior employees. It sells... well, more affordable medicines."

"More affordable? How so?"

"The ingredients are... less refined. The preparations are simpler. The prices are much lower. It's mainly for common folk who can't afford our regular medicines."

Liu San understood now. Gongjitang sold the lower-quality goods that the main pharmacy couldn't or wouldn't sell under its respectable name. By suggesting Yang Shixiang's medicines be sold there, Yang Shiyi was effectively saying they weren't good enough for the main shop.

No wonder Yang Shixiang looked so dispirited.

Liu San thanked the assistant and returned to the reception room.

"I understand now," he said to Yang Shixiang. "Your brother thinks our medicines belong with the cheap goods."

Yang Shixiang nodded bitterly. "That's his way. Always condescending."

"Don't be discouraged. We don't need his blessing to succeed. Let him think what he wants—in a year, our medicines will be selling better than anything in his fancy shop."

While they waited for Yang Shiyi to prepare the ingredients, Liu San decided to take a walk outside. The pharmacy fronted a busy street, and the courtyard was crowded with people coming and going.

He was observing the deer pen—admiring the sika deer that the pharmacy kept as both an attraction and a source of ingredients—when a commotion arose nearby.

A man had collapsed in the courtyard. People gathered around, murmuring in alarm.

"He's fainted!"
"Too much heat!"
"Someone get water!"

Liu San pushed through the crowd. The fallen man was a day laborer type—poorly dressed, middle-aged, with the weathered look of someone who worked outdoors. He lay sprawled on the flagstones, his face flushed and drenched with sweat.

Heatstroke. Liu San recognized the symptoms immediately.

He knelt beside the man and checked his pulse—rapid and thready. His skin was hot and dry despite the sweat. Classic heat exhaustion bordering on heatstroke.

"Move back, give him air!" Liu San ordered. The crowd complied.

He reached into his robe and produced his personal supply of Zhuge Marching Powder. Opening the small glass vial, he sprinkled some of the powder into the man's nostrils.

Almost immediately, the man's eyelids fluttered. He coughed, then drew a deep shuddering breath.

"Give him water," Liu San said. Someone brought a cup, and he helped the man drink slowly.

Within minutes, the man was sitting up, looking dazed but alive. The crowd murmured in amazement.

"What medicine was that?"
"It worked so fast!"
"Is that some kind of miracle drug?"

Liu San milked the moment. "This is Zhuge Marching Powder, named after the great strategist himself. It opens the orifices, dispels noxious vapors, clears summer heat, and neutralizes toxins. Extremely effective against heatstroke, miasmic illness, and various summer ailments."

He held up the little glass vial so everyone could see it. "Available soon from Runshitang of Lingao County, in partnership with Yang Runkai Hall's Gongjitang."

If Yang Shiyi wanted to stick his medicines with the low-end outlet, Liu San would make the best of it. People who witnessed this demonstration would remember the name—and they would seek out Zhuge Marching Powder when they or their families fell ill.

The recovered man was pathetically grateful, trying to kowtow despite his weakness. Liu San helped him up.

"No need for that. Just remember the name: Zhuge Marching Powder, from Runshitang."

News of this incident spread quickly through the pharmacy. By the time Yang Shiyi came to tell them the ingredients were ready, he had heard all about the miracle cure in his courtyard.

"Your prepared medicine seems quite effective," he said to Yang Shixiang, his tone thoughtful.

"It is, Elder Brother. Doctor Liu developed the formula. It's based on ancient remedies but improved with modern techniques."

Yang Shiyi looked at Liu San with new interest. "Perhaps we should discuss your medicines' distribution more seriously. Gongjitang may not be the only option..."

Liu San smiled inwardly. Nothing sold medicine quite like a public demonstration. Yang Shixiang's spirits had lifted considerably. Though his cousin had tried to marginalize them, Liu San's impromptu performance had changed the dynamic.

They returned to the reception room to finalize the purchase of ingredients. Yang Shiyi was now much more accommodating—even suggesting they stay for dinner to continue discussions.

"Your cousin's attitude has certainly improved," Liu San murmured to Yang Shixiang.

"I noticed. What changed his mind?"

"A man collapsed from heatstroke. I revived him with the Marching Powder in front of everyone. Word got around."

Yang Shixiang's eyes widened. "You staged that?"

"No, no—it was genuine. The man really was suffering from heat exhaustion. But I certainly made the most of the opportunity."

Yang Shixiang laughed for the first time that day. "Doctor Liu, you're not just a physician. You're a natural merchant!"

"In business, one must seize opportunities when they arise. Your medicine is genuinely good—all I did was let people see it with their own eyes."

By the time they left Yang Runkai Hall, they had purchased all the ingredients they needed and secured a tentative agreement for Gongjitang to distribute their summer medicines. More importantly, Yang Shiyi had mentioned the possibility of more substantial cooperation—something that would have been unthinkable at the start of their meeting.

The Delong Bank note had opened the door. The heatstroke rescue had sealed the deal.
