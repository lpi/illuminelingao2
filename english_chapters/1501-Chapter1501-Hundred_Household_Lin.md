# Chapter 1501 - Hundred Household Lin

Liu Deshan sold all the coarse sugar on the ship here at a quite satisfactory price—leaving only refined sugar goods, according to the market introduction in *Hong Kong Price Current*: price of coarse sugar in Jiangnan was lower than in Taiwan, but refined sugar prices were higher in Jiangnan.

Since they came to Taiwan, naturally they couldn't leave empty-handed. Empty cargo space was wasted money. Their next stop was Shanghai; Jiangnan gentry had considerable demand for overseas luxury goods. Liu Deshan bought American furs, European fine woolen cloth, Indian printed cotton cloth, and spices from East Indian Islands, also buying some Western groceries liked by gentry families to fill the hold. Liu Deshan originally wanted to buy some deerskins, but was told deerskins and all deer products were sold to Australians; Taiwan had no stock at all.

"Cousin, do you think we should go to Kaohsiung again? Stock some Australian groceries. Australian groceries sell very well in Jiangnan..."

"Huamin, this you don't know. Shanghai has big shops acting as agents for Australian groceries; their recent stock is sufficient, so market prices aren't high. We won't earn much shipping them there. If there's much empty space, bringing a big batch would be better than nothing." Liu Deshan said, "Furthermore, Australian goods in Kaohsiung act mainly as foreign cargo; it won't be too late to go when we return from Shanghai, transporting back to Guangzhou to sell to Master Qin."

Thus they decided not to go to Kaohsiung, sailing directly to Shanghai. After loading food and water in Kaohsiung and clearing various fees, just about to hoist sails and depart, suddenly Manager Liu came to report, saying someone wanted to hitch a ride to Lingao to work.

"Didn't you tell him our next stop is Shanghai? Next going to Shandong, finally going to Lingao."

"He said it doesn't matter: has no money, willing to work on ship to earn passage."

"Oh? How does he know our ship is going to Lingao?" Chen Huamin was somewhat puzzled, because the destination of this voyage was indeed Lingao. He and Liu Deshan had already discussed it; after returning to Guangzhou they would go to Lingao to see the "situation," and incidentally see if there were any new goods worth buying.

"This isn't a secret matter," Manager Liu said, "He said himself this ship looks like an Australian ship at a glance; since it's an Australian ship, it must be going to Lingao."

"He is a sensible person," Chen Huamin laughed, "But we are not Australians, nor is this an Australian ship. Only the going to Lingao part he got right."

Liu Deshan asked: "What kind of person is he?"

"Early thirties, behavior and conversation indicate a scholar. I heard his accent carries Cantonese tone, exchanged a few sentences of Cantonese with him—an authentic Cantonese."

"Scholar, can he do work?"

"Looking at his appearance body is sturdy, not a frail scholar blown down by wind." Manager Liu said, "I see his look not like a bad person, rather like a son of a big family coming out to wander."

"Can such a person do work?"

"He hitched rides working to Kaohsiung, then to Taiwan. That shipowner I also recognize—also an old acquaintance from Guangzhou side. He said this person boarded in Guangzhou, person is very honest and capable." Manager Liu said, "Our ship originally doesn't have enough hands; adding one who can write and calculate isn't bad, and doesn't want wages."

"All right, take him along." Liu Deshan listened most to "doesn't want wages," immediately deciding.

"Thank two masters for great grace and virtue!" Lin Ming kowtowed nimbly, "Little one will definitely work well to repay two masters' kindness!"

"No need to kowtow; heard Manager Liu say you are literate, also a cultured person, let's address as equals."

"This, little one absolutely dare not. Two masters are employers, how dare little one overstep etiquette?"

"All right, good, space on ship is small, don't be particular about this empty etiquette. Since you are literate, can you use abacus?"

"Can, can."

"Then follow Manager Liu to do things." Chen Huamin saw the other party's behavior and conversation, at least a studied son of a middle-class family, yet dressed in rags, working on ship humbly, unavoidably felt pity, instructing someone to get him a set of new short jacket, "Working on ship wearing long gown is inconvenient, you just make do for now."

"Yes, many thanks Master."

Lin Ming bowed, hurriedly followed Manager Liu back to cabin. Manager Liu ordered someone to bring him a brand new set of blue cloth trousers and jacket, saying: "Young man, you sleep in this cabin at night, chat with me this old man, play chess. Now, after changing clothes accompany me down to cargo hold to check inventory."

Lin Ming smiled all over, saying yes repeatedly. This time counted as his desperate gamble. Since sister-in-law went missing in Macau three years ago, he spent great effort, using almost all his connections in Guangdong, striving to rescue Li Yongxun back.

But Lingao this place had become Kun thieves' iron bucket, and Australians' way of doing things was completely different from Great Ming; Lin Ming's connections were almost all useless—simply water couldn't splash in. Moreover, once most people heard this matter involved Kun thieves, no matter how much "ability" they had, all avoided it like plague. Since Australians burned Wuyang Post Station, their power around Guangzhou grew daily. No one was willing to oppose Australians for a Jinyiwei Hundred Household. He spent much effort, actually collected quite a lot of information on Kun thieves, but where exactly sister-in-law was, still had no news.

These years he ate without taste, days passed very boringly: wife gave him no good face at all—this was no wonder, wife's maiden family relative lost a child here with him, not coming to door to make a scene was already very polite. Also fortunate Li Yongxun ran away from home to Guangdong herself; main responsibility wasn't on him, otherwise Lin Ming truly had heart to jump into sea to seek death.

Li Yongxun went missing in his hands; he still had to bear this responsibility. After years of futile inquiry, Lin Ming finally made up his mind: unless one enters tiger's den, how can one get tiger's cub. Since Kun thieves' base camp was in Lingao, sister-in-law was nine out of ten in Lingao. Only by personally going to Lingao, mixing into Australians, could he get Li Yongxun's whereabouts. Whether dead or alive, must have an explanation for his own wife.

Li Yongxun was just a child; surely Kun thieves wouldn't go so far as to kill her, but falling into Kun thieves' hands, the end need not be asked. Every time thinking of this, Lin Ming always cried pity secretly, this delicate flower actually cheapened Kun thieves—knew earlier he should have acted first. If really could rescue her, girl being no longer virgin, finding a husband probably couldn't be done, might as well take her into home to accompany Madam...

This thought of Lin Ming naturally couldn't be told to Madam, but his idea of going to Lingao to rescue Li Yongxun was approved by Madam Lin, because due to this matter, she now didn't even dare go back to Nanjing to visit parents. Moreover every time letter came from maiden home, asking whereabouts of Qianqian, leaving her speechless.

"Long pain is worse than short pain; rather than dragging on unclearly like this, looking everywhere to ask, better go personally to be proper!" Madam Lin also came from Jinyiwei military officer family, most straightforward, "If really can find her whereabouts, always can find way to rescue. If her fate truly thin, at least have a whereabouts. At worst we show filial piety to Second Elders of Fifth Aunt's family for her!"

"Madam speaks correctly—" Lin Ming nodded repeatedly.

"Just you yourself must also be careful. Heard Kun thieves also have Factory Guards..."

"Great Song calls it Imperial City Department..."

"Whatever they call it, heard Kun thieves are skilled in this way, ears and eyes everywhere, every word and act pryed upon, husband must be careful at all times."

"I know. Wife you rest assured."

"How can I rest assured." Tears rolled down Madam Lin's eyes, "Already lost a sister, you don't lose yourself too! This family big and small all rely on you!"

"You just rest assured, I know weight of matters."

His family had "Five Happinesses Holding Longevity"; Madam Lin was naturally "deeply understanding righteous cause," but four concubines were unhappy—after all this Li Yongxun's life or death had little relation to them; husband going to risk life and death, they were unwilling no matter what. Inevitably a bout of crying and making noise; fortunately Madam Lin usually managed household with methods, mixing scolding with persuasion, finally convinced everyone.

Settled matters at home, Lin Ming had to consider how to go to Lingao.

Going from Foshan to Lingao couldn't be easier; go from Foshan to Guangzhou, buy a boat ticket at Great Wave Shipping Agency at Tianzi Wharf, at most two or three days could get on boat to Lingao. With money, naturally have clean exquisite cabin; without money, cargo ship steerage was also counted clean.

Lin Ming however didn't intend to go to Lingao like this. He had inquired among people who had been to Lingao long ago; outsiders entering/exiting Lingao all subject to strict interrogation. He himself was most expert in arresting; let alone having too many acquaintances in Guangzhou, just this appearance of neither merchant nor scholar, once showing face at Bopu Wharf, would be targeted by Kun thieves' Factory Guard spies.

To be a spy, first must hide head and tail, appear like ordinary commoners to not attract attention. Only having been Jinyiwei for over twenty years, speech and behavior all had "official manner"; would reveal filling without speaking. Considering repeatedly, Lin Ming decided on a roundabout action. Specifically, not departing from Guangzhou, but changing a place to go.

He decided to go to Kaohsiung first—Kaohsiung was Kun thieves' newly opened overseas territory; heard fish and dragons mixed there [diverse people], easy for him to hide identity going there, then take boat from Kaohsiung to Lingao. Like this not only could hide his tracks, but also incidentally inquire about Kun thieves' situation in Kaohsiung. Since Kun thieves defeated Zheng Zhilong in Zhangzhou Bay, sweeping Zhangzhou Bay, concerns in court and public about this force increased. Lin Ming estimated, within three to five years, court inevitably would fight Kun thieves again; intelligence on Kun thieves collected by himself, by then would be good stuff for promotion and getting rich.

Plan settled, Lin Ming really could put in effort: dressed as down-and-out scholar, carrying only little silver alone quietly arrived in Guangzhou, boarded a merchant ship going to Kaohsiung as a clerk, specializing in bookkeeping and paperwork. He worked very hard on ship; although seasick from time to time, and not a deck sailor, he did his best, willing to help with any work, very valued by captain.
