# Chapter 141: East Gate Market Police Station (Part 2)

Zhou Shizhai had worked at Qiwei Escort Bureau for eleven years. Like his martial-brothers, he came from Sun Kecheng's hometown—knew some boxing and staff-fighting, didn't want to break himself working fields, so found his way into Qiwei.

Escort-life was much better than farming. But Zhou Shizhai as an escort made Sun Kecheng uneasy—he lacked the steady temperament escorts needed. Or rather, he wasn't smooth enough in dealings.

Escort-bureaus walked the line between legitimate and underworld worlds. Escorts needed both integrity and flexibility. Zhou Shizhai knew bureaus "ate friends' food, wore friends' clothes"—yet he despised those "friends" and couldn't tolerate their shamelessness. Disagreements led to fights. Long-route escort-work was no longer assigned. Guarding shops and residences became his specialty. But this also had rules: encountering thieves—only escort out, never capture. Shop-disturbances—stop at minimal force. Bureaus weren't government—protect employers' property and safety; capturing criminals was yamen-business. But Zhou Shizhai repeatedly broke these rules—making many underworld-enemies. Eventually transferred to mule-stables as manager—avoiding trouble.

Dull years passed. Then Bureau-Chief Sun summoned him: those Australian sea-merchants wanted to buy estates in Qiongzhou—needed an escort to "lead" there.

"Leading" meant: wealthy-households, for security, maintained house-guard forces. Typical guards were commoners—knowing neither martial-arts nor underworld-ways. Specialized hired-escorts served as "leaders"—training guards in martial-arts, arranging night-patrols. In residences, this was guest-retainer status.

Leading was responsible but well-paid—no sleeping rough. In bureaus, this was choice-work—but required smooth, flexible people. Zhou Shizhai had led before—then got replaced for over-enthusiastically catching thieves and failing to get along with employers. Now being sent again? Strange—sun rising from the west?

Though puzzled, this was better than handling livestock. Also, bureau recently got much business from Australian merchants—their major patron. Previously-tight finances eased; dead brothers' compensation was covered. Anyone's work could be refused—but Australians' work was mandatory.

He packed, brought two new disciples—sons and nephews of fallen escorts, per bureau-rules. Training-quality too poor for escort-work meant becoming servants or counter-assistants. These two, only sixteen-seventeen, were too young for escorting—sent with Zhou Shizhai for continued training. Sun Kecheng's calculation: also saved bureau some food-expenses. Such youngsters had accumulated.

Hiring escorts was Ran Yao's idea. Despite 21st-century advanced-concepts and equipment, transmigrators knew nearly nothing about this timespace's underworld. Escorts were perfect candidates—compared to yamen-runners who were basically criminals themselves, escorts' professional-ethics were more trustworthy.

Though Dugu Qiuhun was nominally station-chief, actual-operations were under Mu Min. At her request, with Industrial-Commercial Bureau cooperation, they conducted a "security-census"—surveying East Gate's environment, daily-traffic, shop and vendor operations.

Investigation showed: most common cases were pickpocketing, then theft, then fraud and brawling. Robbery and murder were nearly absent—criminals apparently dared not openly attack under transmigrators' eyes.

But that large-scale brawl with fatalities—what was that about? Mu Min personally, with local-translators, questioned many people. Many stammered, eyes shifting—indicating something suspicious. Though Dugu Qiuhun alertly suspected organized-crime fighting over territory, Mu Min disagreed.

Reason wasn't that she thought Ming-era had no organized-crime—rather, Medical-Department's autopsy-report from incident-day. Evidence showed: all seven dead were heavy-laborers—recently doing fieldwork. Also, from her experience: underworld-fights occasionally killed people, but basic-premise was bleeding without killing—using machetes that looked bloody but had low mortality. These bamboo-spears thrust indiscriminately with brute-force resembled rural large-scale clan-feuds.

Indeed, days later, people came to collect corpses. Story emerged: Village-A villagers came to Welfare-Society shopping. At noon, drinking tea and eating at Village-B villagers' tea-stall—minor-dispute escalated. Unfortunately, nearby stalls were all Village-B people or associates. Village-A suffered badly—fled in defeat. Seeking revenge while preparing for retaliation—both sides armed. Fighting broke out like this.

"Such viciousness over such trivial-matters? Too ignorant and backward!" Dongmen Chuiyu was shocked.

"Clan-feuds aren't our business—we can't manage them." To Mu Min, this wasn't news. Rural-feuding existed even in 21st-century China. Behind them lay tangled economic, territorial, cultural, and resource-disputes. Years of accumulated-grievances made any small-incident trigger massive-fights—especially now during agricultural-off-season.

"We must ensure no one causes trouble at East Gate. So this incident can't just end."

"People are dead—what more can be done?"

"Dead people—but corpses remain. Both villages' body-collectors came?"

"All resting at the inn. Bring them?"

"Don't meet them. Send word: five *liang* fine per corpse. Coffins we'll generously provide—cost-price: one *liang*. Payment within seven days—overdue ones get tossed in the sea."

"What?" Dongmen and Dugu stared wide-eyed. "But—didn't Committee require treating natives well?"

"Good-treatment has limits. Let surrounding people see consequences of drawing weapons on our turf." Mu Min was murderous.

Dugu Qiuhun excitedly slapped the table: "Should have been like this long ago! I told Committee—harsh-laws-and-punishments keep peace. If you ask me—future thieves should have hands chopped off! See if anyone dares steal on my turf! 'Good-treatment, good-treatment'—they're climbing over our heads!"

"Hand-chopping is too much." Mu Min told Ran Yao: "Team-leader Ran—what legal-standards do we follow?"

"Just use Public-Security Management Punishment Regulations. It's ready-made." Ran Yao had discussed these issues with Committee. This actually involved legislation. Travelers currently lacked time for this—naturally using existing regulations.

Ma Peng, returning from work that day, saw new notices on the camp-bulletin-board. Many coworkers gathered around. Zhang Xingjiao stood nearby, reading in singsong: "Recruiting police... 10 persons... ages 18–25... height 160cm+, healthy... meals provided, wages, 2.5 work-points daily, plus half-kg rice, bonuses extra..."

Excited chatter erupted. One laborer said: "2.5 work-points. My busiest day I only get 1.5 points. Group-leaders only get 2. Now instantly 2.5!"

"Didn't you hear? Only workers can apply. Workers already get more than us!"

"Why? We do the same work—why do they get more?"

"Don't want it? Then transfer to worker-status."

"Need 12 months' service. Or exceptional-performance."

Ma Peng wasn't initially interested—heard this was yamen-runner-type work, managing arrests and theft-prevention. He feared death; also thought this undignified. But now his mother lived with him. Though short-hairs gave extra 1.5 work-points for "dependents," mother got no free-meals. Finances were tight. Now camp-rumors said workers were getting raises—he regretted listening to Fu Buer, not transferring to worker-status. Such opportunities were passing him by.

But next day he went to commune-office to apply anyway. Though not a worker, Ran Yao saw his decent-physique—finding 160cm+ men wasn't easy—and approved. After questioning, he was called to a back-room, stripped, measured with rulers, and weighed on a large-scale. Finally approved for the native-police squad.

First: ten days learning combat-skills—fastest joint-locks, fighting with peculiar-shaped short-clubs. Then: spotting suspicious-persons, patrolling, questioning pedestrians, pursuit-and-capture, rope-binding techniques. A short-hair called Li Jun taught shield-and-club formations against mobs, plus live-sparring with laborers. These were complex. Ma Peng was illiterate—learning was harder. Fortunately, transmigrators used demonstration-teaching—hands-on instruction, with models and pictures.
