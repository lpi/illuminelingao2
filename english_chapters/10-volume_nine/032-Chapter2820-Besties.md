# Chapter 2820 Besties

Zahra didn't have to wait long. Soon a rickshaw—common throughout East Gate Market—came speeding along carrying a petite figure. The one who alighted was none other than Sonya—formerly the naturalist from Lisbon, now the maid with the greatest freedom and influence in Lingao. Sonya was dressed in an outfit never seen before: a short cross-collared jacket similar to a Senator's, but with a fitted waist. Below were trousers instead of a skirt, and on her feet a strange pair of ankle-high shoes. Yet her signature straw hat, tilted with its silk ribbon, was the same as always. Most importantly, those trademark blue eyes were still as bright as the Persian girl remembered.

Zahra and Sonya had met in the Basra slave market. Since both were prized as rare, top-quality merchandise, after changing hands several times, they ended up belonging to the same slavemaster. The sources of slaves in Basra were varied: most were prisoners of war and abducted civilians from the endless wars nearby; others were freemen who had fallen due to debts or misfortune. Pirate booty like Sonya and political casualties like Zahra were relatively rare types.

Originally, though held in the same slave pen, the two kept to themselves—different races, not to mention different faiths. Though it seemed they'd have nothing in common, the Englishman serving Lingao became their common bond. When Quake Qiong personally led the massive buying spree in Basra, he inevitably dealt with their slavemaster. While Quake was selecting, Sonya, sensing her opportunity, asked him for help in English.

Though Quake was half her countryman, what mattered more than compatriots was making money. The slavemaster saw at once that Sonya could "fetch a good price" and spared no expense to purchase her.

Sonya didn't get her wish to escape slavery, but at least she left that hellish slave market.

It was precisely because of this incident that Zahra realized she and Sonya shared a common language—English. In fact, half of Zahra's English proficiency was thanks to Sonya. Though raised in Lisbon, Sonya's mother was English nobility, making English her pure mother tongue. Compared to Zahra, who had learned English from books and half-baked translators, it was a world of difference.

Though not yet holding the lofty status that would come after Newton's emergence, England's scientific community in this era had begun to make its mark. The most typical representative was Bacon, who said "Knowledge is power," and Harvey, who had just published his work proposing the theory of blood circulation. Especially Bacon—his empiricism emphasizing deep observation of natural phenomena had played a very important role in shaping Sonya's worldview and aspirations. She had never abandoned English.

It was in the stuffy, rocking ship's hold, through constant communication with Sonya, that Zahra truly learned English. Similarly, compared to Sonya—born by the sea and raised on ships as the child of a seafaring family—the pampered princess Zahra had far less endurance for the voyage. During the journey, Zahra fell ill with fever, vomiting, and fainting more than once. Without Sonya's careful nursing and attention, she might not have made it ashore.

Jumping off the rickshaw, Sonya embraced the Persian girl walking toward her and kissed her cheeks.

"You look wonderful!" Sonya said sincerely. "It's been so long since we met!"

Though their New Speech was now good enough to converse, at this moment they still habitually spoke English.

Zahra returned a flurry of kisses: "Dressed so strangely—where did you run off to this time?" She suddenly noticed the curls peeking out from under her hat and asked in surprise: "You cut your hair?!"

"Yes, cut it short." Sonya said indifferently. "Long hair is inconvenient for field expeditions."

"Such beautiful hair!" Zahra said, half regretful, half teasing. "Your master won't like it..."

Two fashionably dressed foreign girls pushing and jostling each other on the street inevitably drew glances from passersby. Fortunately, locals knew these were the darlings of the Senators, so no one bothered them.

"I just got back from an expedition with the Long-Range Survey Team. Only came back a few days ago." Sonya had recently participated in the Nanyang Company's survey of Ceylon. However, all surveys of the Southeast Asian region were currently conducted secretly under the guise of trade, so she could only say "Long-Range Survey Team" and couldn't reveal the specific destination.

"Going to sea, always going to sea! Aren't you afraid of being captured by Malay pirates?!" Zahra's heart pounded at the words "going to sea." In Basra, she had seen too many tragic men and women captured while voyaging and sold into slavery.

"Malay pirates? We captured a few ourselves this time." Sonya beamed. "On the ship, I carefully studied their language and race..."

"Still going back to that in three sentences..." Zahra was a bit displeased. "How's the child?"

"Very well," Sonya nodded repeatedly. "Just that she didn't quite recognize me. Took her a while to remember I'm Mama." Here she looked somewhat rueful.

"You're a mother now. Better cut down on your wild expeditions. Isn't being a museum researcher nice? Respectable, and you get to do your naturalism..."

"Since I'm a researcher, I have to do field expeditions." Sonya's expression was complicated. "Let's not talk about this. Today let's have some fun."

Just as they were about to set off on their happy shopping spree, a crisp voice came from nearby: "Would you ladies like some Australian popsicles?"

Turning, they saw a boy of at most eleven or twelve, freckle-faced, wearing a white vest with a big red flower painted on it. The bag on his shoulder held a large insulated container, and in his hand was a stack of papers. The girls knew he sold Australian iced treats. Sonya generously handed over a twenty-*wen* denomination circulation voucher. "Two mung bean popsicles. Keep the change."

A mung bean popsicle was five *wen*; two was only ten *wen*. This foreign girl had tipped ten *wen* at once. The boy's spirits rose. So what the old-timers said was true—these strangely dressed foreign girls were nine times out of ten Senators' concubines. They were the most generous and loved all sorts of novel things. Making money off them was the easiest.

While taking the money, he continued his pitch: "Ladies, I have the latest Australian ice cream here. The newest Australian product from Tianshan Cold Drinks Factory. Delicious and thirst-quenching. Twenty *wen* each. Would you like to try?"

Sonya was someone who loved trying new things, so she agreed at once. The boy happily used long tongs to fish out two vanilla ice creams. Unlike the bare popsicles, the ice cream was wrapped in a soft white paper—clearly higher class.

He filled a woven straw carry bag with ice and placed the ice cream inside. This measure could keep the ice cream from melting for about half an hour—a simple insulation solution.

Before leaving, the boy slipped them a piece of paper, saying it was a discount coupon for a newly opened Australian restaurant with promotional pricing. The paper wasn't large; it bore some pictures and slogans, clearly typical Australian printing. Sonya was closer to the Australians and could basically read Chinese by now, so she read the text to Zahra: "Originating in Tokyo, flourishing in Australia. Try a bit of joy—I'm lovin' it."

Sonya half understood these words, but the picture in the center was clearer: several men and women gathered around a steaming plate, smiling and eating heartily. At the bottom in large characters: "This month's special: Seafood Supreme Flatbread. Present this coupon for 2 yuan off per serving." The back was printed with a map—on the standard *Bairen Transport and Tourism Map* template, a large double-arch-shaped logo marked the location. It seemed not far from where they were.

Engrossed in the novelty, the girls didn't notice that on the right side of the coupon was actually a row of small numbers matching those on the popsicle boy's vest. This was the Red Flower Society's newest business—distributing flyer advertisements. The Red Flower Society's original goal was solving basic livelihood issues for children from troubled families, later adding a work-study element. Now, through cooperation with merchants, they distributed flyers and coupons. Each used coupon earned the distributor a monthly commission, while also making them responsible for preventing the flyers from being carelessly discarded.

Since it wasn't far, it seemed a good place to sit and rest. The two had originally planned to find somewhere to sit and chat over food. Tempted by the flyer, the girls decided to walk over. They were currently standing adjacent to the Cooperative General Society's new building site, at the intersection of East Gate Avenue and a recently widened cross street. Since this street was almost as wide as East Gate Avenue—much wider than other parallel cross streets—commoners colloquially called it "Wide Street." On newly printed East Gate maps, this street's official name was "Baihui Street." Many assumed it meant "Gathering of a Hundred Trades," but it was actually a certain Senator borrowing from the old-timeline English name for "Wide Street"—Broadway.

In the not-too-distant future, the intersection of East Gate Avenue and Baihui Street would become a world-famous fashion crossroads, like Japan's Ginza or New York's Times Square in the old timeline, with countless tourists passing through. And East Gate Avenue together with the parallel Guangming, Jiefang, Ziyou, and Fuxing would be called the Five Avenues, which together with the cross streets of Baihui, Huaqiang, Chunxi, and Hanzheng would form the brand-new city center.
