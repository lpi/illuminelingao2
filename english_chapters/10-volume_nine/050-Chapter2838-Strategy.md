# Chapter 2838 Strategy

Xi Yazhou ignored Old Di's interruption. "That's right, but Ming-controlled Wuzhou, Pingle, and Guilin prefectures are exactly the areas with the most appointed officials in Guangxi—also the relatively stable regions. What's left for Xiong Wencan is western and northern Guangxi, filled with Yao people, Láng people, and various local chieftains. Of course, historically, Guangxi's Láng people have been one of Ming's important troop sources in the southwest. But to mobilize chieftain wolf soldiers, you need money. How many can he recruit with the paltry 20,000 taels Chongzhen gave him? Last year when the Linlan miners' uprising happened, his standard camp was sent to support Yongzhou. The moment they left, a Yao rebellion erupted in Liuzhou. The prefecture seat at Maping County was burned to white ground. Right now, Ming-controlled Guangxi is fires everywhere and smoke rising from all sides. Most remaining Ming troops are garrison soldiers who can barely defend strongpoints. Old Xiong couldn't even drive Yao and Láng people toward us as 'driving tigers to devour wolves' even if he wanted—no field army, can't drive them! He's supposed to personally lead troops against the Short-Hairs? Might as well just give Old Xiong a rope and tell him to hang himself."

"As for Fu Zonglong—Chongzhen has had him training troops until now. He claims to have trained ten battalions of firearms forces; actually no more than 3,000 men. Most are recruited miners, and they don't even have enough bird-guns—he still looks down on bird-guns, wants to buy Nanyang-style. Miners are decent fighters as long as you pay their wages. Problem is, his wages have never been paid in full. Last year when Zhang Puwei's Mimi Cult rose up, all of Fu Zonglong's forces were pinned down in Jiangxi. By comparison, Pianyan Provincial Governor Chen Ruimo deserves more attention—after all, he has 15,000 men. Besides recruited miners, they're reorganized from original garrison troops—not high combat power. But note that Pianyan Governor's jurisdiction includes Shizhou Guard, Yongshun Pacification Commission, Baojing State Pacification Commission, and other chieftain territories. If the three major chieftains of Yongshun, Baojing, and Rongmei in this area were fully mobilized, they could provide somewhere between 3,000 and 10,000 troops. These chieftain soldiers excel at climbing cliffs and threading through forests. Even if they can't face Fubo Army head-on, once they infiltrate our controlled areas through mountain routes to run amok, they could cause considerable damage."

"Since we're talking chieftains—what about Qin Liangyu?" The questioner was Li Di, the only Navy Senator in the inspection team: "I'd really like to meet those female soldiers under her command."

"Qin Liangyu doesn't command any female soldiers. Stop fantasizing."

"Zhu Youjian certainly hasn't forgotten those toughest-fighting eastern Sichuan chieftains. But the Shizhu, Youyang, and Xiushan forces of eastern Sichuan—especially Shizhu, meaning Qin Liangyu's force you're thinking about—have fought many battles with Li Chuangwang and Western Camp during their repeated incursions into Sichuan, suffering considerable losses. For nearly twenty years, Shizhu's able-bodied men have gone to war for Ming—nearly every family has casualties. However loyal Qin Liangyu is to Ming, she can't spend all her people. I estimate eastern Sichuan chieftains might contribute about three to four thousand troops this time. If combined with Huguang chieftains, that's indeed a significant threat."

"No wonder National Army needs to recruit Vietnamese monkeys. Fight poison with poison. Any other forces?"

"Fujian's Zheng family. These past two years, Zhu Youjian has been vigorously courting the Zhengs—granting Zheng Sen titles and ranks, promising them a transfer to Ningbo to manage maritime trade, summoning Zheng Hongkui for an audience. Would he let them sit this one out when it comes to suppressing Short-Hairs? True, the Zhengs' basic fiscal revenue and military strength have long since shriveled under Senate blockade. But however diminished, they can still field a few battalions on land and dozens of ships at sea. Moreover, according to Manila Station reports, Zheng Hongkui has been colluding with Heer. If he manages to get some fancy toys from Heer and show us something when the time comes—not impossible."

Li Di pursed his lips, swallowing his words, listening to Xi Yazhou continue: "Of course, Ming's real main force—the northern border armies, especially Jizhen, Liaoning-Ningyuan, and Xuanfu-Datong armies coming south—the probability is relatively low. After all, the Qing troops are much closer to Beijing than the Short-Hair bandits. But northwestern border armies are a variable. If Li Chuangwang's defeat is confirmed, Chongzhen may well dispatch Sun Chuanting or even Hong Chengchou to lead the Qin Army in the Short-Hair suppression. Then there's the Brave Guard Camp from the Beijing garrison system. These two forces are probably Chongzhen's trump cards. In sum, if he throws everything in, Chongzhen could mobilize about 70,000 Ming troops for a combined suppression of the Senate. Our assessment is the main attacking force will be around 30,000 to 40,000."

The riding crop moved again to the map's southern portion: "General Staff has war-gamed several Ming army advance plans. Actually, enemy options aren't many. Most likely is advancing from Yongzhou, with taking Guilin Prefecture as the first objective. After capturing Guilin, they'd advance from there to gradually squeeze Australia-Song's presence in Guangxi. Simultaneously, they'd dispatch a diversionary force from Daoxian through Jiangyong and Zhongshan counties via Yinzhu Ridge to raid toward Hezhou, or from Chenzhou taking the Yangshan Pass route to reach the Lianzhou area, then down the North River to raid Guangzhou. The route from Linwu in Hunan down the Wu River to Shaoguan is less likely due to the Wu River's rapids. Splitting forces from Hunan-Jiangxi direction, more likely would be from Ganzhou via Meiguan Pass toward Shaoguan. Meanwhile, the court would mobilize Zheng family forces to infiltrate Chaoshan region, or launch maritime raids to pin down our forces."

"If the Ming main force doesn't aim to directly take Guilin, they might also advance separately from Yongzhou and Chenzhou, with taking Hezhou and Lianzhou as primary objectives. This plan's two main march routes are relatively narrow and rugged, unsuitable for large army movements. However, once Hezhou and Lianzhou are taken, they can threaten Guilin from the northwest and threaten Guangzhou by going downriver to the southeast. We can also judge that once Ming forces cross the Nanling range, they'll inevitably split to attack in multiple directions, forcing us to fight fires everywhere while neglecting some fronts."

"Third possibility is the entire Ming army attacking Shaoguan via Meiguan Pass. This direction has a complete post road system; marching is relatively convenient. Once Shaoguan falls, they'd have waterway resupply advantage. It's the orthodox approach for advancing into the Two Guangs. But correspondingly, our defense difficulty is also lower. General Staff believes the probability of Ming concentrating all forces on this direction is not high."

"So Ming forces will either center on Guilin with coordinated main and diversionary attacks, or split into multiple columns to infiltrate Senate territory and cause destruction." Chairman Wang summarized: "Does General Staff have contingency plans?"

"The most mature and least technically demanding Plan A." Xi Yazhou's riding crop traced a line on the map: "Our forces deploy from Guilin in the west to Shaoguan in the east in a long stretched formation. Specifically, Fubo Army advances to the Xing'an-Guanyang-Daoxian-Ningyuan-Chenzhou-Rucheng line—roughly equivalent to the old-timeline G76 highway—and establishes defensive positions to meet Ming attacks. National Army holds key towns in the second line to counter small enemy forces that might penetrate. Due to the excessive frontline length and limited forces, defensive forces will be spread rather thin."

A snicker came from the carriage: "What pig-like tactics."

"Correct. During war-gaming, we felt this plan was too comprehensive. The flaw of being too comprehensive is it becomes passive and rigid, easily allowing the enemy to find weaknesses to penetrate and cause rear-area damage. Of course, strategically this won't affect anything—Ming forces don't have the ability to accumulate tactical victories into strategic breakthrough. We'd just win less elegantly."

"Plan B substitutes offense for defense. Specifically, two combined brigades from the Guilin direction and one combined brigade from the Lianzhou direction advance north into Hunan, attacking toward the Chenzhou-Hengyang-Changsha line. By threatening Hunan's key areas, we'd draw the Ming main force to respond, planning for decisive battle under Hengyang or Changsha walls—annihilating most enemy combat power in one stroke. This plan could create a large buffer zone in southern Hunan for the Senate, while ensuring Ming couldn't advance south for several years after heavy losses."

"This Plan B sounds like reversing the Ming route of advancing south from Yongzhou and Chenzhou." Jiang Ye chewed on jackfruit while speaking: "The narrow roads and difficult resupply that are problems for Ming would equally exist for Fubo Army, right? Looking at the map, there's no waterway to utilize on this line."

"Yes. Also if Fubo Army advances to the Hengyang-Changsha line, supply lines become very long, giving Ming or local armed forces plenty of opportunities. I personally don't favor this plan." Xi Yazhou's riding crop retracted from Changsha: "Plan C is the reduced version. With one combined brigade garrisoned in Guangxi as main force, advance from Guilin to capture Yongzhou. Meanwhile, one infantry battalion from Zhaoqing advances to Hezhou for defense, one battalion advances to Lianzhou to coordinate in monitoring key routes. Or two battalions from Lianzhou advance to encircle Chenzhou. The goal is still to draw Ming forces to relieve or retake Yongzhou or Chenzhou, luring them into our prepared killing ground for annihilation. Of course, Navy cooperation to strike the Zheng family in Fujian is also needed."

"But what if Ming doesn't follow our script? Say Chen Ruimo is eager to retake Yongzhou or Chenzhou, but can't command Zuo Liangyu. Suppose Zuo Liangyu isn't interested in relieving Yongzhou or Chenzhou, and instead tries to fragment and infiltrate our territory for raiding and destruction—what then?"

"Understood. Attack what the enemy must defend—the key is the word 'must.' Now let me discuss my personal favorite, Plan D." The riding crop moved to the sea, drawing a half-circle along the coastline, finally stopping at the Yangtze estuary: "This plan can also be called the Southern Zhili Campaign. Main force: one Fubo Army combined brigade, reinforced with artillery plus reconnaissance and logistics units. Also draw Marine Expeditionary Force and National Army foreign units to form a task force. Navy dispatches a task fleet. Operations plan as follows—T-Day is confirmation of Ming court's determination to march south:

"T+1 Day: Issue mobilization and operations orders;

T+5 Days: Marine Expeditionary Force and task fleet assemble at Kaohsiung on standby;
T+2 Weeks: Task force main body completes assembly and landing preparations, assembles at Hong Kong and Kaohsiung on standby;
T+10-15 Days: Marine Expeditionary Force captures Zhoushan to establish forward base;
T+25 Days: Task force main body lands at Zhoushan for assembly and rest;
T+1 Month: Task force enters Yangtze River, lands at Wusong;"
