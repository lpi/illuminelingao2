# Chapter 2808 Daya Village (II)

The driver glanced at Tan Shuangxi and smiled: "Sort of."

Having served for many years, Tan Shuangxi knew at once there was more behind those words. But he was an outsider, after all; best not to meddle in village affairs. He immediately changed the subject with a chuckle:

"With so many ducks raised, the local duck meat is also supplied by you, right?"

"Some of it, some of it. Our focus here is still selling duck eggs, plus the culled laying ducks. Meat ducks come mostly from the villages around Fengqian and Fenghou." The driver smiled. "But the braised duck and old duck stew you eat at the market—those are all from our village."

"Wouldn't culled laying ducks be very skinny? Wouldn't they be too dry to eat?" Zhang Laicai asked.

"That shows you don't know. Precisely because they're not laying anymore, the nutrition they eat accumulates in their bodies. Feed them a while longer after they stop laying and you're set. The meat is firm, with plenty of fat and fresh flavor—much tastier than those white-feathered meat ducks that are out of the cage in sixty days."

"You even know about 'nutrition,' sir—quite learned!"

"My family raises ducks too. The Heaven and Earth Society technician talks about it all day long. Even a parrot could learn it by now." The driver laughed.

"You raise ducks and still come out to drive a coach? Really hardworking!"

"Fart! If I had money, I wouldn't be out here driving a coach." The driver laughed and cursed. "It's not like I'm a glutton for punishment; I have no choice. My son won't follow me to tend ducks, and he won't work the fields either. Going to the city to be a factory worker—he complains about being too managed, the work too hard, and getting scolded by foremen. I told him, back in the day, his old man delivered firewood to Master Liu's house in the city, set off while it was pitch dark, arrived near noon half-dead from exhaustion, and then got disdained for the firewood being damp. Argued a few words and took several slaps from the steward for nothing! A foreman scolds you a bit—what of it? You know what he said?"

"What did he say?" Zhang Laicai asked with interest.

"He said, 'A foreman is a person; a worker is a person too. Why can he scold me? If he scolds me, I quit. If it were me delivering firewood back then and the steward hit me, I'd definitely hit him back.'"

"Good kid, got spirit!" Tan Shuangxi praised.

"Spirit counts for bird shit." The driver sighed. "He doesn't understand a damn thing. If it came to fighting, I could beat ten stewards! It's just that afterward, one visiting card from Master Liu to the county yamen, and my ass would be beaten off. Couldn't farm Master Liu's land anymore either—the whole family would drink the northwest wind! It's only since the Australians came that there are livelihoods everywhere. No need for the hardship of fishing and scratching dirt to get by. The kid thinks he's got ability now!"

"What did he do after quitting the factory?" Zhang Laicai started gossiping.

"Came out of the factory and followed a merchant to run trade. Gone more than half a year without a peep. A letter finally came a few days ago; the sending place was somewhere called 'Hirado.' Had to ask the police to learn it's a foreign place. Said he's been to many places, and though he hasn't made money yet, he's gained lots of experience—what kind of bullshit is that? Can experience fill your stomach?" The driver smoked and continued griping about his son. "He's already twenty-five, doesn't even have a wife, just does useless things. Never see him send money back. I can only come out and earn money myself."

"Merchants get rich quick. Give it a few more years and he'll make it. Then afraid he won't find a wife?" Tan Shuangxi laughed.

"Not asking him to make it—just want him to live peacefully. Merchants who make fortunes exist, sure, but those who jump into the sea or hang themselves aren't few either. Where's there a sure-profit business..." Here, perhaps feeling it was a bit unlucky, he spat to the side of the coach. "Whether he makes it or not, I can't count on him—his heart has gone wild."

Zhang Laicai suddenly remembered something and asked, "Do you know a Li Anze from your village?"

"Yes, yes, his family is in the Third *Pai*." The driver nodded repeatedly. "His dad used to be a carpenter—great craftsmanship! Pity he died young. Now his sister and brother-in-law run the household." He suddenly realized something. "You said you're on official business—is it to his family?!"

Tan Shuangxi silently cursed Zhang Laicai for being meddlesome! He roughly knew the location of Li Anze's home, just a bit fuzzy after so long. Besides, the Australians had adjusted the district boundaries since arriving. He had originally planned to get off at the village office of the Second *Pai* and have the village head guide them.

The driver said nothing, but from his expression darkening, he had understood what official business they were here on.

The coach stopped in front of the Second *Pai*'s village office. The two got off and went to find the village head, but he wasn't there. The village accountant said the village head had gone to the commune for a meeting, and the stationed police were also out on a call.

"Is his family still in the old place?" Tan Shuangxi asked.

"Still in the old place. The house has been renovated." The accountant had roughly guessed their "official business." "Should I find someone..."

"No need to find anyone. I roughly know where his family is."

"Then you go ahead first. I'll send someone to wait for the village head; once he's back, I'll have him come over."

Leaving the village office, he led Zhang Laicai not along the main road but turned into a country stone path flanked by large banyan trees. They walked past patches of fast-growing forest and paddy fields for over two *li*, crossed a wooden bridge... Seven big white geese honked majestically and waddled past their feet as if demonstrating. Then turn right... Tan Shuangxi muttered while Zhang Laicai said nothing, following behind.

Despite only three or four years since his last visit to Daya Village, Tan Shuangxi felt it was as if he'd been away for many years. The faces flashing by with northern accents made him feel as though in another lifetime.

"It should be around here; I'm not entirely sure." Tan Shuangxi pointed at a row of red tile rooftops hidden beyond the trees ahead.

The two followed the path around a few bends. The view suddenly opened up—a small bay, with a stone pier along the coast. Several not-so-long wooden jetties extended into the sea, packed with fishing boats.

After circling the docks and asking a few people, they walked along a path to a corner of the bay. Here, a waist-high hedge enclosed a courtyard. The courtyard was tidily kept, growing several plots of vegetables. Most striking was a tall shelter made of reed mats in the yard, beneath which stacks of sawed planks and timbers were piled. A wide carpenter's bench was scattered with carpentry tools, and bags of scrap material were heaped in a corner.

No one was in the yard; it was quiet.

"Anyone home?" Tan Shuangxi shouted toward the house. The silence was uncanny. A breeze brushed his face, leaves rustling. From the two tiled rooms in the middle of the yard came the scent of cooking smoke.

Zhang Laicai sometimes liked to say something that sounded learned. Now he plucked a blade of grass to chew and sighed: "The family's doing quite well! Why bother enlisting?"

"Young people's..." Tan Shuangxi said. "Aren't we the same? No one held a knife to our necks forcing us to enlist."

"I enlisted for a meal. The soldier's pay is high, isn't it?" Zhang Laicai said.

The front door was closed. The two had to circle half the yard. Behind the house's backyard, logs were stacked high. A man in his thirties sat atop the lumber pile, holding a book and reading intently. He was reading so engrossed that Tan Shuangxi had to cough loudly twice before his eyes left the book and looked at them.

Though his expression was somewhat surprised, he showed no alarm.

"Something you need? Buying something, comrades?" His northern accent revealed his immigrant status.

Tan Shuangxi said, "We're looking for Li Anze's family."

The man smiled; the white teeth showing inside his lips made one feel the sun was shining brightly.

"I'm his brother-in-law. His sister is inside. The hedge gate isn't latched; come in and talk."

Despite the invitation, Tan Shuangxi found his feet hard to move. These few short steps he walked very slowly. Zhang Laicai was as unreliable as always, hiding behind him and dawdling.

Li Anze's sister came out. No mistaking her—her brow and eyes were almost identical to Li Anze's. She was dressed simply, her hair pinned up.

Tan Shuangxi looked at Zhang Laicai, who deliberately kept his head down, staring at his own shoes. Tan Shuangxi had to steel himself and say to Elder Sister Li: "We are Li Anze's comrades-in-arms."

"Come in quick, have some water." She said. "I saw through the window and thought you were here on business. Why didn't you invite them in?" She quietly reproached her husband, her face full of joy. "It's about my younger brother, right?"

"No, we won't go in..." Tan Shuangxi answered unconsciously, though he didn't know at that moment whether he should go in or stay outside.

"Don't be polite!" Elder Sister Li still carried a wave of warmth, but this warmth only made Tan Shuangxi's heart clench tighter.

The brother-in-law looked at their expressions and seemed to understand. He held his wife's hand and asked them, "Did something happen to Little Li?"

Tan Shuangxi silently nodded, saluted, and said in a low voice, "Lieutenant Li Anze has fallen in action. We are here to notify the family."

Elder Sister Li gave a startled cry and covered her face with her hands, seeming about to faint. The brother-in-law hurried to support her.

"Don't cry." The brother-in-law said steadily, then turned to the two of them. "What happened? Where is he?"

Zhang Laicai took out the notification and handed it to the man.

Elder Sister Li buried her sobs in her husband's chest. The husband had to bring her into the house to sit down. At a loss, Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai could only follow them inside and carefully sit down on the opposite side.

On a wooden chair in the main hall, she began to talk to herself: "A perfectly fine person, had to take some military academy exam. Said there'd be a future going there, a future! Even talked about being an 'Imperial Student'! Wanted to be an officer, wear a command saber... Only a few years, and they bring back a 'notification'... What kind of thing is this! You made the Li family line extinct. How am I going to face Father when I die..."

Elder Sister Li wept and complained, her sobs rambling on. It made the two feel sour inside. They had seen such scenes many times, supposedly immune to tears by now. But at this moment, these words pounded at their hearts, dredging up many buried sorrows of the past.

"Don't make a fuss. Let them finish talking." The brother-in-law admonished as if giving an order, eyes on Tan Shuangxi. Probably because Zhang Laicai had been the one to pull out the notification, he didn't much like this bearer of bad news.
