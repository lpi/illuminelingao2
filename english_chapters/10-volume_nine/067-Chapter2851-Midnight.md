# Chapter 2851: Midnight

Outside, the night watchman struck the third watch. In the main room of a small courtyard deep within a "Ming-Australian Fusion" style residence in Lingao's high-class residential area, Zhou Suniang was kneeling on the square brick floor "reflecting on her misdeeds." Her body, slumping sideways against the Eight Immortals table, could no longer support itself.

The candlestick on the table burned through the night. The Madam had ordered: after the family discipline was administered, Zhou Suniang was to kneel all night to reflect properly.

The maid keeping watch yawned again. The candle flame on the table flickered twice, about to burn down to the base. Groggy, she stood up to get another candle when the door opened and another maid entered carrying a hurricane lamp: "Ruilan! You go back and rest first. I'll watch for you."

The newcomer was a maid named Fuyue, who served Zhou Suniang. As soon as the First Wife returned, she had summoned all the servants and maids around Zhou Suniang for interrogation one by one.

Ruilan was somewhat surprised: "What? They let you back?"

Fuyue said, "I told the steward's wife and the First Wife: I was helping in the kitchen today. Everyone in the kitchen can testify for me. Concubine Zhou running out can't be pinned on me no matter what."

"Good that you're okay!" Ruilan patted her chest. She looked at the sky outside and asked, "What time is it?"

"When I came over, the clock had already struck twelve, and the third watch had sounded outside."

Ruilan laughed: "Forget it, forget it. At this hour, the night-patrol stewardess will be coming soon. I've already lasted half the night; I might as well last the other half. If she catches me leaving, she'll nag me again!"

"You're that afraid of her?"

"Aren't you? She moves her lips, and a beating keeps you from sitting for two days!" Ruilan seemed to have lingering fears. "I won't court that bad luck."

Fuyue sat down beside her and looked at the drowsy Zhou Suniang. "Asleep?"

"Mm. Beaten and scolded. How could she hold up!" Ruilan sighed with some sympathy. "The Madam has wanted to vent her anger on her for a long time. This time she caught her red-handed!"

Fuyue extinguished the hurricane lamp, replaced the candle with a new one, and sat down next to her: "Then I'll keep you company."

Saying this, she walked over, checked on Zhou Suniang, went into the inner room to get a thin quilt, and covered her with it.

The winter nights in Lingao were still a bit cold. Ruilan had a thin blanket for the night watch, so the two huddled together and draped the blanket over themselves.

"You have a kind heart," Ruilan chuckled softly. "Taking care of her like this!"

"The Master's heart-meat. If something really happens to her, the Madam puts on a stern face, but I'm the one who suffers." Fuyue sighed, dragging out her tone. She looked at Zhou Suniang again and whispered, "I'm afraid her days ahead won't be easy."

Ruilan nodded: if the master's days are hard, the maid's are even harder.

"Living a good life, but she just had to..." Ruilan muttered.

"Shh!" Fuyue made a shushing gesture, glanced at Zhou Suniang, and whispered, "Don't blab."

Ruilan knew she had misspoken and quickly nodded.

"Sigh, in this house, although we don't worry about food or clothing and the work isn't heavy, day after day, it's no different from being in prison," Ruilan said faintly. "Living in fear all day long."

Fuyue whispered, "Have you ever thought about quitting?"

"Quitting?" Ruilan was surprised. "A slave's body, a slave's fate. If they want you east, you go east; west, you go west. If you get slapped, you have to ask if the master's hand hurts. How dare you say 'no'?"

"Didn't Advisor Xia say last time: Qu family's deeds of sale are all void? Now we are all considered hired employees." She jutted her chin toward Zhou Suniang. "Her deed is gone too."

"That's what they say, Sister Fuyue," Ruilan sighed. "So what if the deed is gone? We're still at the mercy of the masters to be molded round or flat. If they're happy, you get a sweet date; if not, you get a slap! Look at her..." She glanced at Zhou Suniang again. "The Master's favorite, right? One word from the Madam, and last night she was beaten half to death; the bamboo board split. If they weren't afraid of killing someone..." At this point, she glanced outside again. "Sigh, what does it have to do with us!"

"You silly girl. Without the deed, you are a good citizen, not a slave." Fuyue lowered her voice very, very low. "Whether to go or stay is your own decision. Go out and find work yourself. Do you remember Sister-in-law Gu San?"

"I know. When they were cutting staff back then, she and her man were let go. She was quite unhappy about it!"

Shortly after the Qu family arrived in Lingao, they stopped keeping family guards to watch the door because of the high cost of keeping slaves, and dismissed many of the redundant household servants.

"She works in a factory outside now. She makes several yuan a month."

"That's really a lot." Ruilan was a bit envious. Older maids like them had endured in the mansion for at least a decade. Their monthly allowance was at most half a yuan. Even the head housekeeper earned only one yuan.

"Although living expenses have to be deducted from the wages. But you are your own master; eat what you want, decide everything yourself—unlike us, at the mercy of others for everything."

Ruilan sighed: "Things like that are just for thinking about. We've done work serving people closely since childhood. If we really get let out, what can we do? Sister-in-law Gu San used to do rough work like fetching water and fire; she has strength and knows how to work. What about us? Serving tea, folding quilts?"

"Serving tea and folding quilts—the Australians need that too," Fuyue said. "Besides, can't you learn something else? Gu San's man used to do rough cleaning and carrying work at home; I heard he's working in a workshop now too."

"You talk so enthusiastically; are you thinking of resigning?" Ruilan felt a bit cold and tightened the blanket.

"I think about it, think about it every day. But I just can't make up my mind. It's frustrating hanging around here, getting beaten and scolded, but going out alone, I feel ungrounded." She suddenly grabbed Ruilan's arm. "Let's quit together and go out!"

Ruilan snorted: "Dream on! Leaving aside what we'd do, don't forget we still owe the Qu family debt! Our price money—we didn't see a copper of it ourselves; it either went to our parents or the human trafficker. Now it's all considered our debt. Plus the interest from so many years... You say resign? Fine, the accountant will first calculate how much you owe. Can you pay it off?!"

"You're really honest!" Fuyue sneered. "Sister Lian's debt—who is the Master going to collect it from now?"

"I couldn't do that. Having debt on me, even if no one asks, I'd feel like I couldn't lift my head for a lifetime," Ruilan said. "Besides, I haven't been pushed to that point yet."

The two maids talked and sighed for a while. Whispering, they failed to notice that Zhou Suniang, whose head had been hanging as if asleep, moved slightly.

They talked for a while longer, yawning one after another, until finally, unable to hold on, they leaned against each other and dozed off.

Hearing their breathing gradually become steady and regular, Zhou Suniang opened her eyes and used her hands to support her body, slowly propping herself up.

She supported herself inch by inch with her arms, moving her legs and feet which gone almost completely numb. It took a full ten minutes before she barely managed to stand up, holding onto the table.

Numbness, pain, and dizziness tormented her for a long time. She stood there for ten minutes before she felt her body, which had seemed to be falling apart, return to her.

She moved cautiously to the door of the west room. This was her usual "study," where she often read and wrote. At this moment, by the faint candlelight, she could see the door to the west room was open, and the floor was covered with messy books and scrolls—during the "interrogation" last night, the First Wife had unceremoniously searched her living quarters from top to bottom, intending to find evidence of her "contacting outside men" and "adultery."

Naturally, there was no evidence, because she had no "adultery" at all. As for "contacting outside men," He Xiaoyue had guessed correctly; she was looking for her brother.

Zhou Suniang had been sold to Yangzhou by a trafficker. She had left her hometown at a young age, and now more than a decade had passed. She had long forgotten her surname and name, who her parents were, or where they were. She only remembered she had a brother.

Her fate was actually quite good among her sisters: she was redeemed at a young age. Although she was married as a concubine to a merchant, she was very favored, so the Qu household naturally looked at her with respect.

Master Qu had been in business for many years and had considerable assets and vision. The whole family moved to Lingao, this blessed land of the Great Song. No longer needing to worry about the chaos of war, and enjoying many fresh and comfortable "Australian enjoyments," she lived a stable, wealthy life, ordering servants around, and felt she had nothing to complain about.

What disturbed her mind was a shopping trip to Wanzi Pavilion where she saw the man named Wu Xinsheng and the mole under his eye. In an instant, those long-blurred memories all surfaced.

Unfortunately, repeated attempts to inquire led nowhere. Wu Xinsheng even went out of town. Luckily, Guo Xi'er had a loose tongue, and she managed to find out the man's address.

The Qu family maintained strict security, making it hard to go out. But asking someone to mail a letter wasn't difficult. Zhou Suniang used some means to finally make contact with the Nansha Cotton Textile Mill.

She wasn't willing to give up this rare opportunity. Taking advantage of the Master being away on business and the First Wife going to the temple for incense and fasting, she sneaked out and went straight to Wanzi Pavilion. Although He Xiaoyue had rejected her request, she could tell the other woman sympathized with her. Moreover, she possessed a more resolute and decisive character than Guo Xi'er.

At this moment, the most important thing was the correspondence with the Nansha Textile Mill. One of the letters, along with the one she wrote to her brother, had been stuffed into the sofa crevice in the reception room of Wanzi Pavilion. But she had to dispose of two other letters quickly. Zhou Suniang knew the First Wife would never let her off so easily. The things would be found sooner or later.

She struck a match and, by its light, went to the bookshelf. Squatting somewhat clumsily, she fumbled on the bottom shelf. Soon, she touched a book jacket stuffed inside.

She pulled out the jacket. Inside were two letters—sent from the Nansha Textile Mill—and, of course, half a wooden comb.
