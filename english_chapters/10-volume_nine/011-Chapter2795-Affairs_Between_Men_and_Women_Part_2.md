# Chapter 2795: Affairs Between Men and Women (Part 2)

Zhang Berlin said "too" twice but didn't find a very suitable word. Best to use a sentence "a fresh flower stuck in cow dung" to describe.

But he immediately chose a moral high ground with more lethality: "This person Liu Xiang has engaged several Life Secretaries; even has children. Speaks with full daddy flavor (condescending/patriarchal), greasy (sleazy) cannot be greasier. Little Zhang marrying him?!"

Dongmen Chuiyu thought it wasn't very good for you to say these heartfelt words out loud. Although in his view the possibility of Zhang Yunmi fancying Liu Xiang was not necessarily greater than fancying him. But Little Zhang had tempered in local places for these years, faintly already having the momentum of governing a region. What about Liu Xiang? Also a rising new star in the Senate galaxy. Future Regional Governor or "Minister" were all within range.

If Little Zhang was a woman with quite some ambition, taking the route of strong-strong alliance through marriage mode was not impossible. Just that this possibility was very small. At least in Dongmen Chuiyu's view, Zhang Yunmi was not such a person.

Of course these could only count as conjectures. After all, no one knew Zhang Yunmi's true inner thoughts.

Dongmen deliberated a bit: "Berlin, when Little Zhang was a student, she liked wearing beautiful clothes singing and jumping, being an idol. This is the privilege of young girls. But idols eventually have to graduate. Little Zhang has already graduated. She now has her own work, life. Little Zhang is already an adult now. Who she gets close to, who she likes, is her personal freedom. Senators are all equal."

"I understand, I understand." Zhang Berlin said urgently, "But, I just feel breath not smooth (unhappy/resentful). Yunmi doesn't like me; I can completely accept. My temper is sometimes impulsive, but I am not unreasonable. Of course she has freedom of choice. Little Zhang dating others, this matter I completely accept. But, why specifically Mayor Liu? I see the grandson surnamed Liu utilized work convenience to cheat Little Zhang!"

Dongmen Chuiyu persuaded: "Who said Zhang Yunmi and Mayor Liu are dating? Aren't you creating a friend out of nothing (making things up)?"

"Guangzhou all spread this..."

"This is a rumor. Didn't they just have a bit more work relationship dealings?"

Zhang Berlin was like not hearing, continuing to vent dissatisfaction: "Right, he Liu Xiang is now the Mayor of Guangzhou Special City, a high provincial official. Because of work relationship, can still display his so-called political wrist and ability in front of Little Zhang every day. Following Liu Xiang, whether now or future, can have much political support and help.

"But so what? Without his Liu Xiang's support and help, can't Little Zhang stand out?!

"The Senate has only 500 or so heads in total, and not everyone has to do administrative work. Wait until controlled areas expand; by then positions will be largely vacant. Even Soy Sauce Senators have to be pushed up hard. Even if they are just conservative talents following routine, probably can't fill vacancies. Have or have not Liu Xiang's so-called support and help. Little Zhang at least mixing a Regional Leader is no problem."

Dongmen spread hands: "Doesn't this conclude it? With or without Mayor Liu's support, Little Zhang will become a Big Leader. She is young too; plenty of opportunities."

"I'm just afraid Little Zhang didn't think clearly for a time, letting this grandson Liu take advantage of a weak point to enter." Zhang Berlin had a face of worry, "Wait until thought through, understood, can she stab this fellow?"

"I understand your concern for Little Zhang." Dongmen paused. "My personal view. These things you thought of, Little Zhang has already thought of. As for whether she will be confused by Mayor Liu's 'advantage' for a time, accidentally boarding the pirate sip, I feel, won't."

"Why?" Zhang Berlin didn't understand.

"No why. No confirmative evidence. Just believe Little Zhang can think clearly. Mayor Liu's so-called 'advantage' is just a special state of this period."

Zhang Berlin was still not assured. "My other fear is that this rumor has already spread among naturalized citizen cadres. Afraid she can't withstand pressure for a time, letting Mayor Liu push the boat with the current."

"Since you like her, you have to trust her. Besides these are all rumors. As long as she makes up her mind, others have no way to shake it."

Dongmen Chuiyu thought: Regarding Zhang Yunmi's matter, Liu Xiang has no chance, you also have no chance!

Suddenly, thundering cheers and applause sounded in the field, interrupting the whispers on the stands. Senators also followed to applaud perfunctorily.

Navy People's Commissar Ming Qiu stood at the most dashing position on the rostrum of Bairen Grand Stadium. Looked around the neatly dressed students and naturalized citizen workers on the stands, then looked down at the several neat Fubo Army squares in the field. At He Ming's request, he made a brief speech. Nothing more than making persistent efforts to strive for greater victories and the like. Ming Qiu didn't have much excitement in heart, nor much joy. Navy People's Commissar Ming Qiu stayed forever on the sea surface of Kinmen. Staying here was just a retired former naval officer. He had already submitted resignation to the Senate, resigning from the position of Navy People's Commissar. In the future, being an instructor at Hong Kong Naval Academy, teaching and educating people to spend the remaining life, laying the foundation for the future navy.

Tan Shuangxi stood in the center of Bairen Stadium. The feeling of being surrounded and cheered by tens of thousands of people made him a bit tipsy. Having such glory in this life, worth it! He listened to the two Chiefs' speeches very seriously. The deafening sounds coming from all directions made it hard for him not to be serious.

"...We all come from five lakes and four seas. For a common goal, walked together. We today already lead the whole Hainan and Guangdong, but still not enough. Need more resources, and more people to walk together with us, to achieve national liberation..."

Tan Shuangxi remembered the flash of thought during the march in the morning again. Why do we fight. he was originally a refugee from Guangdong. After purification, because knowing how to dry salt, was assigned to settle in Manya.

During the Battle of Chengmai, went to the frontline as a laborer, participated in transporting ammunition and treating wounded. Smoke and blood on the battlefield stimulated his blood nature (courage); participated in battle on the firing line. Wrestled with government troops on the earthen dike, rushed to transport wounded. At that time, his thought was very simple: never want to live the past days again.

Post-war recruit company trained near Chengmai, organized everyone to visit the Ming Army's Chengmai Grand Camp. Some Chengmai common folks were invited to tell them the experience at that time. A woman described weeping bitterly: Her husband served as village brave to defend the city, but was captured by government troops and beheaded, treated as a Fubo Army head to report military merit. An old man cried and shouted saying before government troops fled, they robbed everything in his home, and insulted his daughter-in-law. He then secretly made up his mind never to allow government troops to step into this new hometown again, letting family be beheaded to report merit. This belief supported his military career he participated in. But inside the transport ship going north, he started to be confused again once more. Here was not his own hometown; why should I go to "liberate" these people irrelevant to me? This morning, by the Wenlan River, he seemed to have found the answer. To defend the peaceful life of hometown, he really was willing to risk life; but seemed not quite there yet. But the North? Guangdong and Guangxi, even further Great Ming land? Seemed not so worth it.

Days and nights fighting in Guangdong and Guangxi. Every soldier fallen by his side suddenly returned to his side in an instant. "...Save me..." A soldier with blood bubbling on chest, mouth spraying blood foam, two hands grabbing disorderly in the air.

"Platoon Leader, Company Commander orders you to go to Battalion Headquarters for meeting after arriving at camp. New task." A messenger ran over from the front of the team, pulling Tan Shuangxi from Guangdong and Guangxi back to the peaceful world of Lingao. Tan Shuangxi took the chance of replying the messenger to organize his own emotions. At this time the welcome ceremony had ended. There were still quite a few cheering crowds on the stands, but no one on the rostrum. The team ahead already began to form up to march out of the stadium.

It was already dusk when Tan Shuangxi arrived at the station. This bit of distance from Bairen to Manya was not worth mentioning for soldiers accustomed to marching. Let alone they were walking on a road paved flat—this was much stronger than the "Official Roads" and various sheep gut small trails walked in Guangdong and Guangxi.

This road was most familiar to soldiers. Especially for veterans like Tan Shuangxi, he knew not how many times he walked the road from Bairen to Manya. When troops "Supported Industry and Agriculture," most work locations were reached by marching along this road. Even this road itself was left with their sweat.

From a simple highway barely passable for vehicles, to a great road paved with coal ash and gravel, flat enough for carriages to drive briskly past. How many changes inside; could really be said "changing with each passing day" (rapidly changing).

People coming and going on the County Road. People clustered in groups by the roadside, watching the return trip of troops. Constantly someone inquired about news. Marching speed couldn't be fast all along. Only arrived at Manya Fortress after noon.

Manya Fortress also set up a battle array of welcome. The 1st Battalion Stay-behind Detachment and sick and wounded sent to Manya Army Hospital for recuperation earlier all came to the camp gate to welcome. Comrades meeting, exceptionally affectionate. Inquiring about recent situation of this journey and news of acquaintances. Surprise and happiness, also sorrow and sighing.

Returning to Manya Fortress counted as returning home. The canteen had long prepared steaming meals. Chicken, duck, fish, meat, having everything that one could expect. And it was buffet mode. Eat as much as wanted; pipe enough (guaranteed enough). Even alcohol usually forbidden to drink, this time was also supplied openly. Crates of Wenlan River Beer. As long as not drinking until lying down (drunk), at will.

Tan Shuangxi didn't eat and drink gluttonously like others. As Acting Platoon Leader, he and all Company/Platoon Leaders received orders to maintain clear-headedness, so as to handle matters at any time when things happen at night.

Although the battalion didn't say "handle" what, everyone knew clearly in heart. Guarding against night disturbance (riot).

People who served in Ming Army before said this was called "Camp Howl" (Ying Xiao). Someone having nightmare howling madly at midnight, the whole battalion would follow to create disturbance. Also mutual hacking and trampling. In the past Tan Shuangxi and others only felt it was "story." After all he never encountered similar things.
