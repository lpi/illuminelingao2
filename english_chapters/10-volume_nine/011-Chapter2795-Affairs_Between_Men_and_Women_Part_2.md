# Chapter 2795: Affairs Between Men and Women (Part 2)

Zhang Berlin said "too" twice but couldn't find quite the right word. The best description would be "a fresh flower planted in cow dung."

But he quickly seized upon higher moral ground with greater rhetorical force: "This Liu Xiang has gone through several Life Secretaries—he even has children! He speaks with that condescending, patriarchal tone, and he's as sleazy as they come. Little Zhang marrying *him*?!"

Dongmen Chuiyu thought it wasn't particularly wise to voice such heartfelt complaints aloud. Though in his view, the likelihood of Zhang Yunmi taking a fancy to Liu Xiang wasn't necessarily greater than her fancying him. But Little Zhang had tempered herself in local postings for years now, already showing the momentum of someone capable of governing a region. And Liu Xiang? Also a rising star in the Senate's constellation. Future Regional Governor or "Minister"—both were well within reach.

If Little Zhang was a woman of considerable ambition, taking the route of a strong alliance through marriage wasn't impossible. It was just that such a possibility seemed quite small. At least in Dongmen Chuiyu's view, Zhang Yunmi was not that kind of person.

Of course, these were merely conjectures. After all, no one knew Zhang Yunmi's true inner thoughts.

Dongmen considered his words carefully: "Berlin, when Little Zhang was a student, she enjoyed wearing beautiful clothes, singing and dancing, being an idol. That's the privilege of young girls. But idols eventually have to graduate. Little Zhang has already graduated. She now has her own work, her own life. She's already an adult. Whom she grows close to, whom she likes—that's her personal freedom. All Senators are equal."

"I understand, I understand," Zhang Berlin said urgently. "But I just feel this... resentment inside me. Yunmi doesn't like me; I can accept that completely. My temper is sometimes impulsive, but I'm not unreasonable. Of course she has freedom of choice. Little Zhang dating others—this I can accept entirely. But why specifically Mayor Liu? The way I see it, that bastard surnamed Liu exploited his position to deceive Little Zhang!"

Dongmen Chuiyu tried to reason with him: "Who said Zhang Yunmi and Mayor Liu are dating? Aren't you conjuring up a couple out of thin air?"

"Everyone in Guangzhou is saying it..."

"That's just rumor. They merely had a few more work-related dealings, nothing more."

Zhang Berlin continued venting his dissatisfaction as if he hadn't heard: "Right, so Liu Xiang is now the Mayor of Guangzhou Special City, a high provincial official. Because of their work relationship, he can show off his so-called political skill and ability in front of Little Zhang every day. Following Liu Xiang—whether now or in the future—would bring considerable political support and assistance.

"But so what? Without Liu Xiang's support and help, can't Little Zhang stand out on her own?!

"The Senate has only about five hundred seats total, and not everyone needs to pursue administrative work. Wait until our controlled territories expand—positions will be largely vacant then. Even the do-nothing Senators will have to be pushed up to fill spots. Even if they're just conservative talents following established routines, there still probably won't be enough to fill all the vacancies. With or without Liu Xiang's so-called support and help, Little Zhang becoming at least a Regional Leader won't be a problem."

Dongmen spread his hands: "Doesn't that settle it then? With or without Mayor Liu's support, Little Zhang will become a Big Leader. She's young too; she has plenty of opportunities ahead."

"I'm just afraid Little Zhang didn't think things through clearly, and that bastard Liu seized on a moment of vulnerability to worm his way in." Zhang Berlin's face was full of worry. "What happens when she's thought it through and realized her mistake? Can she just cast him aside then?"

"I understand your concern for Little Zhang." Dongmen paused. "Here's my personal view: everything you've thought of, Little Zhang has already considered. As for whether she might be momentarily dazzled by Mayor Liu's 'advantages' and accidentally board the wrong ship—I don't think she will."

"Why?" Zhang Berlin didn't understand.

"No particular reason. No concrete evidence. I just trust Little Zhang to think things through clearly. Mayor Liu's so-called 'advantages' are merely a special circumstance of this particular period."

Zhang Berlin was still uneasy. "My other worry is that this rumor has already spread among the naturalized citizen cadres. I'm afraid she might yield to the pressure for a moment and let Mayor Liu push things along."

"If you like her, you have to trust her. Besides, these are all just rumors. As long as she's made up her mind, no one can shake her resolve."

Dongmen Chuiyu thought to himself: *Regarding Zhang Yunmi—Liu Xiang has no chance, and neither do you!*

Suddenly, thundering cheers and applause erupted from the field, interrupting the whispered conversation in the stands. The Senators joined in with perfunctory applause.

Navy People's Commissar Ming Qiu stood at the most prominent position on the rostrum of Bairen Grand Stadium. He surveyed the neatly dressed students and naturalized citizen workers in the stands, then looked down at the several orderly squares of Fubo Army soldiers on the field. At He Ming's request, he delivered a brief speech—nothing more than the usual exhortations to continue striving for greater victories and the like. Ming Qiu felt no particular excitement, nor much joy. Navy People's Commissar Ming Qiu had remained forever on the waters off Kinmen. The man standing here was merely a retired former naval officer. He had already submitted his resignation to the Senate, stepping down from his position as Navy People's Commissar. In the future, he would serve as an instructor at Hong Kong Naval Academy, teaching and nurturing the next generation for his remaining years, laying the foundation for the future navy.

Tan Shuangxi stood at the center of Bairen Stadium. The sensation of being surrounded and cheered on by tens of thousands of people left him slightly intoxicated. To have such glory in this lifetime—it was worth it! He listened to the two Chiefs' speeches with utmost seriousness. The deafening sounds coming from all directions made it impossible not to be serious.

"...We all come from the five lakes and four seas. For a common goal, we have walked together. Today we already lead all of Hainan and Guangdong, but it is still not enough. We need more resources, and more people to walk together with us, to achieve national liberation..."

Tan Shuangxi recalled once more the fleeting thought that had crossed his mind during the morning march. *Why do we fight?* He had originally been a refugee from Guangdong. After completing the purification process, he was assigned to settle in Manya because he knew how to work salt.

During the Battle of Chengmai, he had gone to the front as a laborer, participating in transporting ammunition and treating the wounded. The smoke and blood of the battlefield had stirred something courageous within him; he ended up joining the battle on the firing line. He grappled with government troops atop earthen dikes and rushed to evacuate the wounded. At that time, his thinking had been simple: *I never want to live those old days again.*

After the battle, during recruit training near Chengmai, they were organized to visit the Ming Army's Chengmai Grand Camp. Some Chengmai common folk were invited to share their experiences. One woman described her ordeal through bitter weeping: her husband had served as a village militia defender, but was captured by government troops and beheaded, his head passed off as a Fubo Army soldier's to claim military merit. An old man cried out that before the government troops fled, they had robbed everything from his home and violated his daughter-in-law. Tan Shuangxi had then silently vowed never to let government troops set foot in this new homeland again, never to let his family be beheaded for someone else's merit. This belief had sustained him throughout his military career. But inside the transport ship heading north, confusion had crept back in. This place was not his hometown—why should he go "liberate" people who had nothing to do with him? This morning, by the Wenlan River, he had seemed to find an answer. To defend the peaceful life of his hometown, he truly was willing to risk his life; but even that didn't feel quite enough. And what of the north? Guangdong and Guangxi, and even further—the vast lands of Great Ming? It seemed not quite worth it.

Days and nights of fighting in Guangdong and Guangxi. Every soldier who had fallen by his side suddenly returned to him in that instant. "...Save me..." A soldier with blood bubbling from his chest, mouth spraying foam, hands grasping blindly at the air.

"Platoon Leader, the Company Commander orders you to report to Battalion Headquarters for a meeting after we arrive at camp. New assignment." A messenger ran over from the front of the column, pulling Tan Shuangxi back from Guangdong and Guangxi to the peaceful world of Lingao. Tan Shuangxi took the opportunity of replying to the messenger to collect his emotions. By this time, the welcome ceremony had ended. Quite a few cheering crowds still remained in the stands, but the rostrum was empty. The column ahead had already begun forming up to march out of the stadium.

It was already dusk when Tan Shuangxi arrived at the station. This stretch from Bairen to Manya was nothing worth mentioning for soldiers accustomed to marching—especially since they were walking on a properly paved road. This was far superior to the "Official Roads" and various narrow mountain trails they had traversed in Guangdong and Guangxi.

This road was most familiar to the soldiers. Especially for veterans like Tan Shuangxi, who had walked the route from Bairen to Manya more times than he could count. When the troops had "Supported Industry and Agriculture," most work sites were reached by marching along this road. Even the road itself bore the marks of their sweat.

From a crude highway barely passable for vehicles to a proper road paved with cinder and gravel, smooth enough for carriages to travel at a brisk pace—how many changes it had seen. It could truly be said to be "changing with each passing day."

People came and went along the County Road. Groups clustered by the roadside, watching the troops return. Someone was constantly inquiring about news. The marching pace couldn't stay fast throughout. They only arrived at Manya Fortress past noon.

Manya Fortress had also arranged a grand welcome. The 1st Battalion's Stay-behind Detachment and the sick and wounded who had been sent earlier to Manya Army Hospital for recuperation all came to the camp gate to greet them. Comrades reuniting, the affection was exceptional. They inquired about recent events from the campaign and news of mutual acquaintances—surprise and happiness, but also sorrow and sighing.

Returning to Manya Fortress counted as coming home. The canteen had long prepared steaming meals. Chicken, duck, fish, meat—everything one could expect. And it was served buffet style—eat as much as you want, with plenty guaranteed. Even alcohol, usually forbidden, was supplied openly this time. Crates of Wenlan River Beer. As long as you didn't drink yourself under the table, help yourself.

Tan Shuangxi did not indulge like the others. As Acting Platoon Leader, he and all the other Company and Platoon Leaders had been ordered to remain clear-headed, ready to handle any situation that might arise during the night.

Although the battalion hadn't specified what kind of situation, everyone understood clearly: they were guarding against night disturbances.

Those who had previously served in the Ming Army called it "Camp Howl." If someone had a nightmare and started screaming madly at midnight, the whole battalion might follow suit, descending into chaos—even hacking at each other and trampling one another. In the past, Tan Shuangxi and the others had thought it was merely a story. After all, he had never encountered such a thing himself.
