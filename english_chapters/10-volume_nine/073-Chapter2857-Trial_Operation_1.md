# Chapter 2857: Trial Operation (1)

Huang Yaomin picked up the phone. It was from Hong Huangnan, saying he had an important matter to discuss.

"Old Hong, aren't you in Guangzhou? Why did you run back again? Did you get the approval for the Guangzhou Carriage 4S Shop project?"

"Getting the approval is a piece of cake. The problem is they only give the approval but no money. What do they think I am? The Boy of Wealth?!"

"Hahaha, seeing that you lost quite a bit on that 4S shop in Lingao!"

Huang Yaomin thought to himself, *You are just too ambitious.* Ever since the Lingao Vehicle Plant launched rickshaws and they sold like hotcakes, Li Chiqi and others had set up a chain of rickshaw maintenance and repair shops. Why didn't you participate in that project? It looks rustic, but it makes money!

"Isn't that the truth? I've been flamed by so many Senators over this matter. It seems I'm not very popular in the Senate." Hong Huangnan complained for a while.

"Enough small talk. You didn't come back to Lingao just to complain to me on the phone, did you?"

"Hehe, then I'll cut straight to the chase." Hong Huangnan laughed dryly a few times. He naturally had official business in Lingao, but he sought out Huang Yaomin mainly for the 82nd Shop and Wanzi Pavilion matters.

"...Take some product photos for me; I want to make a product catalog..."

"That's easy. What do you want to shoot? What about models?"

"I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow night, and we can discuss the details at the table." Senator Hong didn't want to say too much over the phone. "I'll send a car to pick you up."

By the time Huang Yaomin finished taking a set of photos for his maid, it was already evening. After returning home and finishing dinner, Senator Huang went back to his study, turned on his computer, and posted a thread on the BBS: "Which era of old timeline lenses can the optical department replicate?"

Currently, Lin Hanlong's optical factory couldn't manufacture lenses yet. Although the wet plate cameras used in the photo studio now were manufactured in this timeline, the lenses used were still stock brought from the other timeline—just like the cameras currently used by powerful departments and propaganda media.

The BBS was now sparsely populated, with barely a post every ten days or half a month. It was kept mainly because some technology enthusiasts needed it as a platform for non-face-to-face communication. Moreover, the posting and replying mode had no time limit, allowing for good use of leisure time.

Therefore, after the IT department cut most of the resources originally needed to host the BBS, they still kept a lightweight message board system that consumed very few resources.

He didn't expect to get an answer quickly, because most Senator technicians continued to work after dinner and would only take a look when they were free.

Unexpectedly, within half an hour, Xu Qi from the chemical laboratory responded:

"I feel that as long as it doesn't involve special glass and multi-element lens designs, almost anything is possible. After all, developing mathematical calculations is something that doesn't need to be redone. In reality, most will likely follow designs of large and medium format lenses from World War II and before. After all, the use of special glass and coating in modern designs is a hurdle Lingao can't cross yet. Structures like Tessar and Double Gauss, which use few lens elements and are mature, pose no significant problems in manufacturability. These relatively newer structures are actually easier to realize. However, they mostly need to be redesigned for a larger image field, but with software assistance, it shouldn't be too troublesome."

"As for coating, the domestic coating machines in this timeline are quite usable and not too expensive. But obviously, no one brought high-purity materials for evaporation coating on the Holy Ship, and even if they did, it wouldn't help much without a continuous supply. As for climbing the tech tree to build coating machines from scratch, getting stuck on achieving and maintaining high vacuum is a problem that will leave us staring blankly for quite some time. Regarding coating design, there don't seem to be many brothers from optical machinery institutes among the 500 wretches. Although I sold quite a few products, I only played with simple single-layer metal films myself. really trying to unlock the thin-film optics tech tree is another massive pit! By the way, I have an impression that early on, acid etching was used to form a corroded thin layer on the glass surface for anti-reflection. This method should be achievable in Lingao, but I've never seen the actual effect."

"Forget about coating; multi-element lenses are sufficient." At this moment, Li Chiqi also joined the discussion.

"Yeah, without coating, eight air surfaces are the practical upper limit. Luckily, there are plenty of usable structures under this condition."

"Can manual lens structures be copied directly? No need to redesign?"

"Yes, as long as there is glass with matching serial numbers and the image circle distance matches, just produce it directly according to the design," Lin Hanlong also expressed his opinion.

Eight air surfaces? Although Huang Yaomin wasn't an optics major, he knew that being able to make multi-element lenses was sufficient. He decided to search for information again and found a super long article titled "Structure, Performance, and Selection of Large Format Lenses." He looked at the structural introductions of several large format camera lenses inside and found that the Dagor structure lens was more suitable for application in Lingao, so he specifically copied these paragraphs:

*Designed in 1892, the Dagor structure can be said to be the beginning of modern optics... The Dagor lens uses a 6-element, 2-group structure. It is also a symmetrical orthoscopic lens. It can be seen as a derivative of the Hypergon structure. Due to the use of cemented lens technology, a lens element difficult to process can be divided into several parts undertaken by several lens elements respectively. Therefore, this lens was the first design capable of mass popularization. Also, because lens groups cemented from multiple lens elements can utilize different glass properties for better dispersion correction, the Dagor lens structure is actually a structure between wide-angle and standard lens structures. The wide-angle characteristics inherited from Hypergon and the multi-element correction itself have certain conflicts. Most finished Dagor lenses cover between 60-80 degrees, but because it can correct several basic high-level aberrations very well, the aperture can be made larger than previous lenses. The general limit is f/6.8, so the vast majority of lenses of this structure are F6.8...*

*When the Dagor lens first appeared, coating technology did not yet exist. This structure also avoided interface reflection effects caused by too many air surfaces in its design, having only four air surfaces. The light transmittance was considered very high.*

He posted the text above to the forum, expecting good news from the optical department, and then turned off the computer to sleep.

Who invented the first practical popular camera, the Flag brand wet plate camera, has no historical verdict yet. Today, we can only guess based on the "Daguerreotype photography method" mentioned in someone's notes. However, there are abundant records regarding the advent of the Empire's first camera lens. Even today, when looking at these materials, we have to admire the scientific Senators of the Empire's optical industry. Their wisdom and achievements are probably unsurpassable even today. Especially the Tessar lens they designed themselves—what kind of talent was needed to inspire such inspiration to design an optical lens with such extraordinary details? It earned the reputation of "Eagle Eye" at the time. Due to its simple structure and relatively low cost, it is still widely used today. It is no exaggeration to say that the appearance of the Tessar lens made the popularization of photography inevitable.

—*History of Camera Development in the Senate*

The next day, Senator Huang got up early. Starting today was the seven-day trial operation period. For this, more than two hundred free photography coupons and one thousand visit coupons had been distributed to potential consumer groups in Lingao through various channels. Of course, coming or taking photos wasn't mandatory; the main point was to see roughly how many people in this group would respond.

Although not mandatory, considering the human nature of "watching the excitement," there would definitely be no shortage of people coming during the trial operation. Therefore, visiting and photography were both numbered, with a daily limit. Senator Huang was still worried and specially asked the Lingao Police Bureau to send a team of security police to maintain order.

At this moment, he was pacing in the hall, watching the queue gradually forming outside. Today was the mid-month half-day off, and quite a few people had come! Moreover, many came as families, supporting the old and carrying the young. It seemed most were indeed here to watch the excitement.

However, if a lot of photography customers poured in on the first day, this newly minted photo studio would probably be in a flurry. After all, wet plate photography involved many procedures and a long fixing time. He had tested it; the entire process took at least ten minutes for a single person. If it was a multi-person shoot like a family portrait, just the process of adjusting postures and guiding expressions would take more than ten minutes. If things went smoothly, it would take about twenty minutes to complete. It would take even longer with children.

So he limited it to forty coupons on rest days and thirty on weekdays. Two camera positions were used simultaneously. He would consider adding positions and personnel based on the situation after the trial operation.

"It all depends on today's situation." Senator Huang looked at the business hall he had meticulously designed and arranged. From the style of the floor tiles to the color of the walls, the placed green plants, the style of furniture... all the way to the lighting scheme on the ceiling, he had selected everything himself. So it looked somewhat like a TV station broadcasting hall. Wandering in it gave Huang Yaomin a familiar feeling.

The photo studio staff were already in position and waiting solemnly. Huang Yaomin glanced around and found that Chen Shixin, who was usually the most active, was absent. He couldn't help frowning and asked, "Where is Chen Shixin?"

"Today is his public rest day," Old Zhang quickly responded.

Old Zhang was the first photographer he had trained himself. He was a peer of Chen Shixin's father, also a color painter craftsman. Due to his painting background, he was relatively sensitive to patterns and shapes. He could be considered his proud disciple.

Such a strong combat force was actually on leave today! Huang Yaomin cursed himself secretly for not thinking thoroughly. Today was a public rest day, and the first day to boot; there would definitely be the most people. He should have asked him to swap shifts. Old Zhang was reliable, but the others were a bit...

Just as he was thinking, he suddenly looked through the glass window and actually saw Chen Shixin in the crowd of onlookers accumulating outside. He was wearing a brand-new high-end linen "cadre suit," his hair combed shiny and smooth, and was talking and laughing with two young girls!
