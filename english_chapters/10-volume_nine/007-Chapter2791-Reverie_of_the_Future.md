# Chapter 2791: Reverie of the Future

"These are all small matters. Are there no big matters?"

"The big matter is matchmaking (blind date). For common folks, that's just about the big matter," Tan Shuangxi said.

"If matched, then marry over!"

"Where can it be so fast!" Tan Shuangxi shook his head, "First say if matched or not, then discuss betrothal gifts. There are many tricks inside."

"Getting a wife is harder than passing the Number One Scholar exam!"

"It's much better now than two years ago. Women are much more than before; betrothal gifts have also come down."

In the army, there were plenty of hot-blooded bachelors. Once talking about women, there was no end. Speaking of which, everyone wanted to get a wife, but the market price of marriage was unaffordable for most.

"It would be good if we could be discharged in Guangdong. When we were in Shaoguan, big girls and young wives around the station were interested in us. Some came to ask if we were willing to stay. Sigh!"

The speaker seemed to feel it a great pity.

"Why didn't you just stay?"

"Stay and become a deserter? Catch and shoot! But there were really bold ones! Joint Logistics had a soldier running away with a woman. Mobilized us all to search. Searched for a month without whereabouts. Cheapened this kid!"

"What cheap. Lost soldier status for a wife. I don't covet it. Being a soldier is so happy; will have a good place after discharge in the future. Isn't it better than being a live-in son-in-law for others?"

"That's true too. Even after discharge, there's a good future. Taking discharge pay to set up a family property, isn't it beautiful."

"If fighting again in the future, will you still come to be a soldier?"

"Conscripted, definitely have to come. Without beating away government troops and bandits, could it be your kid's turn to have enough big rice for every meal? Besides, dare you not come for conscription? Want to be a non-citizen?" Sergeant Ma said, putting his military cap on that soldier's head, "This team in the future, counts on you guys."

Seeing the topic turned back again, Tan Shuangxi glared fiercely at that unobservant soldier, then continued to interrupt. "Bopu side has already become a fishery cooperative. You don't join the cooperative, preparing to go solo?" Due to frequent support for agriculture and industry, the Fubo Army was familiar with the organization of industrial and agricultural production.

"Cooperatives are for poor ghosts who can't afford boats to join. My family hasn't fallen to that stage yet." Sergeant Ma said quite proudly. "My family and several uncles all have boats. Last time sold family boats together to co-buy a big fishing boat. It's a longline fishing boat made in Hong Kong. Putting down hundreds of hooks at night dragging along, one night can catch a hundred or so big fish. There is an ice cabin below. Load a boat of ice; fish caught go immediately into the ice cabin. Unloading at the port, they are all bang-bang hard." Seeing everyone gathered around listening attentively, the Sergeant couldn't help becoming proud, continuing to brag, "Line-caught fish quality is much better than net-caught. At the fish market grading, they are top grade, can sell for high prices. Earn much more than small boats pulling nets." He spoke with spittle flying, "Just say last time they went to catch tuna. All were tuna more than three feet long. back at the wharf cut open directly. The fish meat is like the best beef, dark red. No need to cook. Take a knife to cut a piece and eat directly. That taste..." Everyone involuntarily swallowed saliva.

"Would it be about the same as Shunde Raw Fish (Yu Sheng)?"

Sergeant Ma rolled his eyes at him, "Chiefs all love to eat this kind of fish! All the best tuna are acquired by Fishery General Company Room 39."

Fishery Company Room 39 was under the jurisdiction of the General Office. Where the goods it acquired went was self-evident.

"Dip a little light soy sauce, add a little ground mustard (wasabi). Eats oily and moist like beef, fresh and bouncy like big sea prawns..."

This description made the group of people drool directly. Wishing to eat early to satisfy cravings.

"...There is a raw fish shop opened by a Japanese in East Gate Market called 'Ba', the boss is named something Kou General Tai (Masa). Don't know where he heard the news that business in Hainan Island is easy to do, ran to East Gate Market to open a shop specializing in selling raw fish. He also often comes to stock my family's goods. Particularly picky. Also brags he is 'Immortal'..."

"Immortal? What kind of immortal is he? Fish-slicing Immortal?"

"Immortal or not hard to say. Craftsmanship is indeed not bad." Sergeant Ma bragged for his client.

"Since you went to sea several times, the boat doesn't lack one of you?" Tan Shuangxi asked curiously.

"Fishermen certainly not lacking. Elders mean to use earned money plus loans to open a fishery company, buy another two boats. The problem is running a company requires dealing with Yamen—you also know, their older generation fears seeing officials most. Even Senate 'Cadres' won't do. So they urged me to discharge and go back."

"Originally thought you were going back to be a fisherman. Unexpectedly to be a Big Boss!" Someone was quite envious.

"Eh eh, how can count as boss. Aren't I still a fisherman." Sergeant Ma immediately became very humble.

Tan Shuangxi originally thought Sergeant Ma was just an honest man. Unexpectedly this honest man had quite some strength. Being soldiers eating rations wearing the same uniform coat, felt like not much difference. Once talking about discharge, everyone's quality became different.

His own family wasn't a poor family either. Family circumstances belonged to upper-middle level in the company. But compared with Sergeant Ma, obviously not enough to look at. After all, his family was just scraping food from the soil.

Just being somewhat melancholy, suddenly a sharp whistle sound came from the hatch, followed by the sentry's loud voice: "To... Officer... Salute!"

With this sound entering the cabin, Company Commanders, Platoon Leaders, and Squad Leaders bounced up immediately like springs, shouting loudly: "All assemble!" Everyone reacted in an instant, jumped off beds and stood straight.

The grille door of the upper deck opened. Three neatly dressed figures came down from the stairs. Due to backlighting, faces couldn't be seen clearly. But looking at the appearance, it should be Battalion Commander Lin Fu. Tan Shuangxi stood barefoot by the bed, stood at attention and saluted, "Report Major! First Company First Platoon is resting. Please instruct."

"At ease!" Lin Fu approached the narrow aisle. Nearby soldiers hurriedly retreated to make a path. Lin Fu circled in the ship cabin, confirmed no prohibited activities were carried out, and soon issued orders:

"All organize internal affairs. After breakfast land at Bopu Port for minor rest and reorganization. After lunch, the whole battalion march back to Anya堡 (Majia/Manya Fortress/Castle). Baggage stay on ship."

Lin Fu finished giving orders to Company Commanders, turned and left the cabin. At the moment of drilling out of the hatch, many soldiers heard him laugh and mutter to himself, "Still dip soy sauce."

After the Battalion Commander left, the whole ship cabin became busy. Everyone busied with personal cleaning and hygiene while joking at the Sergeant, "You keep pulling (bullshitting). Eating fish not dipping vinegar but dipping soy sauce."

Sergeant Ma was very unconvinced, defending: "Battalion Commander definitely hasn't eaten it. Chiefs all eat this way!"

At this time orders came again. Deck open. Each company could go up to deck to wash and get fresh air.

A small burst of cheers immediately rose in the cabin. Because sea conditions were bad, they hadn't been on deck for two days. Everyone was suffocated bad.

People scrambled to put on clothes and shoes, taking washing supplies up to the deck.

The weather outside was extremely good. Although thin mist still drifted in the distance, the sea surface was a piece of clear jade. Light breeze with slight salt taste blew over the T800's deck, washing soldiers' bodies. Hearts and chests expanded for it, like being washed.

Hundreds of ship ropes trembled in the wind, making creaking sounds. Due to wind direction, ship sails were not all hoisted up. But masts tens of meters high and thousands of square meters of ship sails hanging on top were still awe-inspiring existences in the eyes of army soldiers.

There were already quite a few people on deck. Most wore standard white undershirts for sleeping. Some used ladle after ladle of hot water poured out by paymaster soldiers to wet towels to wash faces. Some had toothbrushes inserted in mouths, white foam flowing down from corners of mouths continuously.

The crossbars extended on both sides of the ship rail were full of squatting people. One by one took off pants holding ropes to think about life. This peculiar convenience mode could only be carried out when weather was sunny and fine. Tan Shuangxi disliked the smelly smell, squeezed all the way to the bow before starting to brush teeth.

The ship didn't restrict fresh water use—after all, sailing along the coast. But people were many, and many times couldn't go on deck. Many soldiers simply didn't brush teeth or wash faces, chewing gum everyday as substitute. Tan Shuangxi also made do like this for two days. Today he had to clean himself well no matter what.

From the bow, the entire fleet could be seen: Three T800s and three escorting single-masted patrol boats were breaking waves advancing. Masts like forest, sails like clouds. Just looking at it felt very majestic and powerful.

"Boom rumble..."

Suddenly, a cannon sound came from afar. Then, sound after sound of cannon.

Soldiers on deck couldn't help being stunned: Here was already close to Lingao. Qiongzhou Strait had long been the world of the Senate. Where came unobservant petty thieves coming here to seek death?

"It's salute cannon!" Still the Battalion Headquarters messenger Little Liu was knowledgeable, hearing something from the rhythmic cannon sounds, "It's the Navy coming to welcome us!"

As ships advanced, mist gradually dispersed. A row of blurred bow outlines could already be seen in a slightly farther place, as well as tops of rows of masts even farther. Army soldiers mostly hadn't seen this kind of posture. Each stood dumbly without making a sound, eyes staring straight ahead. Silence on deck. Only sea waves slapping ship rails and the hunting wind sound of the Morning Star Flag at the bow could be heard.

Suddenly, the sun tore a hole in the cloud layer. Golden sunlight immediately enveloped the ocean surface. Sea mist disappeared almost in an instant. More than a dozen single patrol boats were coming head-on in column formation. Sails and masts like forest, momentum pressing people. Morning Star Flags at mast tops fluttered high.

Patrol boats fired salute cannons while advancing. Escort fleet ships also began to fire salute cannons. Rumbling cannon sounds resonated over Qiongzhou Strait. Clouds of white thick smoke permeated. Soldiers cheered together.

The sailor standing at the top of the mast suddenly shouted loudly at Lin Fu on the bridge: "Major! Navy Strait Detachment sent semaphore to you!"

He stared at the incoming ship opposite, shouting out word by word loudly, "Navy Strait Detachment pays tribute to heroic Army soldiers. Welcome home."
