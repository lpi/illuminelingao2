# Chapter 2862: Trial Operation (2)

"I gave you a day off, not a day to pick up girls!" Senator Huang Yaomin felt a pang of jealousy watching the young lad laughing with two youthfully vibrant girls. Back when Senator Huang was at the TV station, he had seen all kinds of beauties, but as a TV laborer, he had never had the luck to get close to any fragrance.

After becoming a Senator, Life Secretaries were naturally available in whatever quantity he desired, but his youth was gone. The regrets of the past left old scars in his heart.

"Dating, dating my ass!"

He immediately called a shop assistant: "You! Go call Chen Shixin in from outside!"

Seeing the Senator's unkind expression, the assistant thought, *No one barged into the studio without knocking this time, so why the long face?* Just as he was about to go out to call him, he saw Chen Shixin already walking in with the two girls.

"Chief!" Chen Shixin greeted Senator Huang as soon as he entered. "Business is booming today!"

Huang Yaomin nodded; this kid was sensible enough! Seeing that he had brought two girls in as well, he couldn't help but size them up curiously. One of them looked vaguely familiar, but he couldn't recall who she was. judging by their hairstyles and attire, they should be naturalized employees, and of a not-so-low level.

Realizing Chief Huang's gaze, Chen Shixin quickly introduced He Xiaoyue and Guo Xi'er, saying he specifically brought them today to "broaden their horizons."

Hearing they were designers from Wanzi Pavilion, Huang Yaomin thought to himself that Senator Hong was indeed formidable; even the female employees he recruited were so charming. It was a waste for him to work in military logistics!

"Ah Xin, it's the first day of trial operation, and the shop is very busy..."

Chen Shixin quickly said: "I'll stay and help in the shop. I just wanted to show them around. What do you think..."

Seeing him being so tactful, Senator Huang was "greatly pleased." He immediately agreed to let him take the two girls for a "tour" of the shop, on the condition that he help with taking photos.

After months of internship, he was already familiar with the entire operation and had been operating independently for a long time. Although he didn't intend to become a professional photographer, Huang Yaomin felt that the skills of the photographers currently being specially trained might not be as good as his.

Taking advantage of the time before opening, Chen Shixin took the two girls for a tour up and down the photo studio.

"...Beep... beep... beeep. The final tone indicates 8:00 AM Lingao Time."

With the hourly time signal broadcast from the "chatbox" at the street corner, the trial operation of Coconut Grove Photo Studio officially kicked off.

"Chief, let's open the door," the female receptionist reminded.

"Open the door!"

As the glass door opened, the "customers" who had been lined up by the police at the entrance began to enter one by one. Since entry required coupons, order management was much better, but the nature of loving to watch excitement still made customers involuntarily squeeze inside.

"Line up, line up, don't push. Whoever cuts in line again won't get a number... You... yes, you... I saw you cutting in line, go to the back..." Just as the door opened, a dozen people rushed in at once. There was still a crowd eager to try outside, forcing the assistants to shout and maintain order while controlling the entrance.

To separate the onlookers from those taking photos, they were diverted to two sides starting from the entrance. Because there were many people wanting to take photos, a congestion formed immediately. Huang Yaomin instructed Chen Shixin to manage Camera Position No. 3 and speed up the shooting process.

Guo and He acted as "assistants" for Chen Shixin. In this era where photography technology was still very primitive, photography not only required assistants, but the assistants' work was also quite heavy. Especially in soothing the restless crowd waiting outside and guiding customers who didn't know where to put their hands and feet during the shoot.

Chen Shixin briefly told them what to do and what to watch out for, and the two began their "duty."

Here, the environment was completely different from the Wanzi Pavilion they were familiar with. Being newcomers, everything looked fresh, and everything they did felt interesting.

"Miss, may I ask if this is the line for photos?" Just as He Xiaoyue came out to call a number and was preparing to return, a voice came from behind. He Xiaoyue turned around and saw a man wearing a neat Fubo Army NCO uniform standing behind her with two elderly people. The old man kept wiping sweat with a handkerchief. The soldier also had a forehead full of sweat, and sweat stains had appeared on his collar. If not for the requirements of military appearance and discipline, he probably would have taken off his hat to fan himself.

"Yes, are you three taking photos too? Where is your number?"

"Here, here." The soldier hurriedly handed over a slip of paper.

He Xiaoyue took a look and handed it back: "This is a visit coupon, not a photography experience coupon."

"Then, then can I pay for it myself?"

"Paying yourself won't work either. For these few days, photos are by coupon only. Why don't you go to the counter outside to get an experience coupon? Come back in a few days; taking photos is free during this period," He Xiaoyue explained.

The soldier took back the visit coupon in disappointment and looked somewhat uneasily at his parents behind him. He whispered, "My parents are over fifty. They are old and haven't been to the city. We missed the public carriage. I rushed over as soon as I picked them up. I didn't expect there to be so many people... I'm back on leave this time and thought I could take a photo as a memento."

Although He Xiaoyue hadn't worked in a photo studio, she had long developed an exquisite heart dealing with clients at Wanzi Pavilion. She had experience with such matters. With so many people around, if she agreed to him, others would make the same request, which would definitely cause more trouble. She thought for a moment and said:

"I have to ask for instructions on this matter. Please wait a moment." With that, she went in and spoke to Chen Shixin.

"It's definitely not possible right now; even people with coupons haven't finished shooting yet."

"Can we add a number? It's not easy for him to bring his parents to the city for a photo while on leave." He Xiaoyue pleaded.

"I'll add a number for you, but they have to come later." Chen Shixin thought for a moment. "Tell them to come over at four in the afternoon. By then, the line should be mostly done. Adding a number then won't be a big problem."

He Xiaoyue took the added number coupon out. Under everyone's gaze, she didn't hand the coupon over but said loudly with a stern face, "The quota for photography coupons is full today; no more numbers can be added. Why don't you pay at your own expense? No need to line up or wait for a number. Just come directly at two in the afternoon." When saying "at your own expense," He Xiaoyue winked at the soldier and emphasized the word "afternoon." Seeing the other party smile at her and nod, it seemed he had understood.

He Xiaoyue pretended to guide them out, led them to the door, and then secretly stuffed the photography coupon into the soldier's hand.

"Come on time in the afternoon. If the photographer leaves, you won't be able to take it."

"I know! I know!" The other party nodded repeatedly.

The photo studio used Flag brand cameras produced by the Lingao Optical Factory. The speed of wet plate photography wasn't fast. What was more troublesome was that the required plates and solutions had to be prepared in advance before taking photos. The prepared plates and solutions couldn't be kept for long and could only be prepared according to the number of issued tickets. Today's issue was forty tickets, but considering photography failures and other uncontrollable factors, Huang Yaomin actually prepared fifty sets of consumables. Adding a number for one or two people was no problem.

Back in Studio No. 3, Chen Shixin had already started getting busy. The first few numbers were all single portraits, mostly young people coming to try it out of curiosity. It wasn't until number six that a couple in their early thirties appeared. Both wore factory work clothes and led two children, a boy and a girl. They were simply a model naturalized family from Australian propaganda posters.

"Are you taking a family portrait? What background would you like? We have the Holy Ship, Bairen Town, farms, factories, and various Western and Nanyang landscapes..." Guo Xi'er, now self-taught, introduced them mimicking Chen Shixin's tone.

The so-called background was a set of painted backdrops and props to make the photos look less stiff. The background walls here were large oil paintings specially custom-ordered by Senator Huang from Trini's studio regardless of cost. They were colorful and extremely realistic, installed on racks that could be quickly changed.

The couple led their children to look at several background props and sample photos hanging on the wall. They whispered and discussed for a good while before deciding to choose the farm background. This made Chen Shixin somewhat proud because he had made the tractor panel prop for this background.

He arranged the couple and children to sit on fixed seats, then pushed the tractor background board over and placed it behind them, making them look like they were sitting in front of an Australian tractor head.

It was evident the couple had dressed up carefully for the photo. Their clothes were new, and their hair combed. The two children were also tidied up neatly. Only the older child's clothes were probably altered from the mother's clothes and didn't quite match her age of around ten. Chen Shixin fetched a set of Fangcaodi Primary School girls' uniform without the school name or badge for her, gave her a prop schoolbag, and had her hold a prop book *Selected Stories of Senators*. The younger child was only four or five. Chen Shixin originally wanted him to sit on a toy wooden horse, but the child rocked non-stop as soon as he sat on it. So he had to stuff a rubber ball into his hands and let the mother hold him, placing the wooden horse at their feet as a prop.

When the couple and children were all posed, Chen Shixin first led them through a rehearsal of the process, staying still and holding the pose for ten seconds. Both children were relatively obedient and didn't need fixing frames, which relieved Chen Shixin. He took a plate prepared just that morning from the workroom, loaded it into the camera, lit the gas lamp covered with white cloth, instructed them again on precautions like not moving, and then stood beside the camera lens.

Chen Shixin shouted "Start," then removed the lens cap, shouting numbers loudly as a timer. The couple and two children were very obedient, looking at Chen Shixin motionlessly, waiting for him to count from one to ten. Then he covered the lens cap and said "Done," before exhaling deeply. Chen Shixin removed the plate and returned to the workroom to register it. These plates would have to wait until the photography work ended today before there was time for developing.
