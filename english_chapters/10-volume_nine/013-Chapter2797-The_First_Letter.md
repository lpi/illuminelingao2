# Chapter 2797 The First Letter

All was quiet during the night. The next day, a battalion meeting was held. Although Tan Shuangxi kept yawning, he had to attend. This meeting was an "expanded meeting" requiring the presence of all officers and NCOs. Just as Sergeant Ma had predicted, the meeting first announced the order for the entire battalion to rest and reorganize for three months. Consequently, there would be many personnel transfers.

"Ensure your mailing addresses are valid, as new orders may be issued at any time."

At the same time, the conditions for voluntary discharge applications were announced. Tan Shuangxi looked at the three criteria: a cumulative twenty-four months of overseas deployment during service; three cumulative combat injuries; or being over thirty-five years of age.

"In addition to these three criteria, those with genuine family difficulties requiring discharge for caregiving may also submit an application. The Political Department of the General Staff will be responsible for the review. Each case will be discussed individually," Lin Fu added.

Sergeant Ma naturally met the criteria. In fact, upon careful calculation, quite a few people in the battalion qualified. Tan Shuangxi knew he could also apply to leave this time. However, he was not willing to do so. He didn't have a family business to manage like Sergeant Ma. Although given his rank, as long as he obtained a Class B diploma, he would likely be sent to the local administration to be a "cadre" or something similar. But the income and treatment would not be as good as in the army. Especially with this Mainland Campaign, the troops received "wartime allowances" in addition to their original pay, making their income several times higher than when they were at the garrison.

After the meeting, Tan Shuangxi intended to return to his platoon to make arrangements, but was called back by the battalion commander for a small meeting. The attendees were specifically selected NCOs from each company.

This time, the meeting was still presided over by Lin Fu, but the real protagonist was an officer from the General Staff's Political Department whom he did not recognize. The meeting's content was simple: the NCOs would pair up and go to the homes of the fallen soldiers in their companies to deliver death notifications and personal effects.

"This is a very important task that may take up a lot of your time. We hope everyone will adhere to the principles of patience and meticulousness, delivering the effects and notifications one by one, demonstrating humanistic care..."

Tan Shuangxi didn't understand the second half of what the officer said about humanistic care and such; he was completely befuddled.

"This is tough!" Tan Shuangxi had lost count of how many times he had repeated this sentence. Subconsciously reaching into his pocket for a cigarette, the vibration beneath his buttocks made him suddenly realize he was on the urban rail—smoking was prohibited on the train—so he shrank his hand back.

From the moment he got on the train, he had read the few sentences in the mission manual hundreds of times, but he still couldn't figure out how to open his mouth and say the words: "Your son/husband is dead."

"This is tough!" Tan Shuangxi's temporary partner, Sergeant Zhang Laicai, also muttered, "What kind of mission is this!"

Zhang Laicai was the "Platoon Sergeant" of this platoon, so he couldn't escape this job either. His grumbling wasn't just because the mission was difficult, but mainly because it delayed a "good thing." He had originally arranged with a former "Yellow Ticket" lover to have a meal in East Gate Market that evening and then enjoy a night of passion. Having taken this job, the night of passion was off. They had to run all over Lingao, which would take at least two or three days. He had been muttering since leaving the camp gate.

"A mission is a mission, what's there to say." Although Tan Shuangxi was also full of complaints, he looked down on Zhang Laicai's impatient look to find a woman.

Zhang Laicai stopped muttering about "delaying things" and just looked worried. He glanced at the two bulging military backpacks on the luggage rack and whispered to Tan Shuangxi, "Old Tan, there are several in here who have nothing but a 'Glory Medal.' The pension is only the minimum. Will the families have objections and cause trouble?"

"Cause trouble?" Tan Shuangxi hadn't thought in that direction and didn't react immediately. Right, there was this even more difficult problem. He couldn't help but take off his military cap and scratch the top of his head vigorously. Why did he have to get stuck with such an unlucky mission? Leaving aside the bad luck, the main thing was that it was hard to open his mouth. This mission was harder than attacking a hilltop position.

"I don't think so. Being a soldier and fighting wars, life and death are fate. What's there to fuss about? If this were in the Great Ming, would they dare to cause trouble?"

"But this isn't the Great Ming, is it? If families are dissatisfied, we can't stop them from speaking, can we?"

"But what's the use of making a fuss with us?"

"That's not called causing trouble, at most it's called having an opinion," Tan Shuangxi admonished. "Watch your wording! If the families have opinions, we just say a few words of comfort. If they say something unpleasant, just let it go in one ear and out the other—after all, they have lost a loved one, bear with it a bit."

"I understand that. It's not like we set the policy."

"As long as you understand that. We are delivering effects to execute an order, not to solve problems," Tan Shuangxi said. "If there are opinions, we listen and report them back."

"Sigh, leave would have been such a good thing." Zhang Youcai began to sigh again. "It's turned into such a depressing mess!"

Tan Shuangxi ignored him. His gaze fell on the empty seat opposite in the carriage. The morning rush hour had passed; at this time, everyone was working, farming, or attending school. Besides the two of them, there were only a few peddlers and odd-job workers. A small vendor was curled up in a corner of the carriage dozing off, a straw hat covering his face, swaying with the movement of the carriage, almost falling off several times before he pushed it back up.

"Military issue straw hat, Lingao Rattan Ware Factory, one yuan two dimes exchange scrip... Bastard! What are you thinking? Why are there these strange thoughts? Focus and think about what to say later... No, it's a high-imitation version from Chengmai Woodware Factory, only eight dimes five cents... Bastard..."

The two got off at Fushan Station near the Lingao-Chengmai border. There were a total of eleven death notifications to deliver, scattered across every corner of Lingao. Among them were bustling thoroughfares like East Gate Market and Bopu Town, as well as villages and farms they had never even heard of.

He and Zhang Laicai had calculated for a long time before setting off and decided to start from Fushan Town in the easternmost part of the county, aiming to finish in two days.

The first place was called Zhongxing Village. The name sounded like it was chosen by a Senator—"China Rejuvenation"; locals wouldn't dare be so bold with names. Since the village name was chosen by a Senator, the village was naturally an immigrant village. Most were refugees transported from Shandong during the Engine Operation, followed by refugees successively settled from Shandong Station, Jiangnan Station, Wuhan Station, and other places, as well as some spontaneous immigrants. After a few years, it had become a large village with a population of over a thousand.

Upon entering the village, according to the rules, they first found the village head to understand the situation. The Guo Dapeng family they were visiting actually consisted of only two elderly parents.

"With only parents at home, how could he go and be a soldier?" Tan Shuangxi was a bit puzzled, because Guo Dapeng had enlisted before the Mainland Campaign. At that time, conscription was "one out of three males, two out of five." If Guo Dapeng was an only son, he wouldn't have been a target for conscription.

"He originally had an older brother, who complained that farming didn't make money and signed up to follow some oil company to Nanyang. He's been gone for two years, writing back once every three to five months." The village head chattered as he led the way. "The old couple also had a daughter, originally married within this village. Last year, her husband went to run a plantation in Qiongnan, and the daughter went with him. The village is left with just them, sigh!"

"How is their family situation?"

"It's alright, they don't worry about food and drink," the village head said. "Both sons send money back, and the daughter used to send food and clothes every now and then. After moving, she also sends things back."

Hearing this, the two felt slightly relieved. Because Guo Dapeng was the fallen soldier Zhang Youcai had mentioned who "only had a Glory Medal." The Guo parents were older and had other children to support them, so presumably, they wouldn't cause trouble.

To be safe, the village head and the militia captain accompanied them to Guo Dapeng's house.

The Guo family's house was on the edge of the village, a three-room tiled house uniformly built by the Senate for immigrants. White walls, black tiles, and a fence of fast-growing trees. A big yellow dog lay in the yard; seeing strangers enter, it immediately barked until the village head shouted at it to be quiet.

The door wasn't locked, but no one was inside. The furnishings were simple and plain. Sunlight streamed in through the clean small window; the house was warm and bright.

"They're probably not at home. Most likely they went to the fields," the village head said. "Let's go find them in the fields."

Following the slowly flowing small river shaded by green trees, they found the vegetable garden. The vegetable plot was large; the village head said they grew vegetables exclusively for the Sky Kitchen Food Factory and the Lingao Cannery. Vegetable farming was delicate work, but the labor intensity was relatively light. The Guo family, lacking strong labor, did some garden work.

From the trellises for cucumbers and tomatoes, Tan Shuangxi distinguished two figures with white towels wrapped around their heads. They squatted amidst the green leaves, quietly doing farm work. The sound of footsteps made the old man and woman turn their heads. Seeing the village head and militia captain bringing two strange Fubo Army NCOs, the old man struggled to stand up. Seeming to sense something, his bright eyes stared straight at the military uniforms on Tan Shuangxi and his companion.

"This is them," the militia captain said softly.

"Time to say something." Tan Shuangxi's brain spun rapidly, but he couldn't utter a single word. He felt Zhang Laicai nudge his leg. He opened his mouth but didn't speak.

The old woman also stood up. She widened her eyes and looked at this group of ominous people, seeming to want to say something.

"Black Egg... Dapeng?" the old man asked in a low voice, pulling down the towel on his head to wipe the sweat. His New Speech was quite good, with a bit of a Shandong accent, reminding Tan Shuangxi of several northern soldiers under his command.

Tan Shuangxi saluted reflexively, then hurriedly took off his hat and said with difficulty, "Guo Dapeng, he... he fell in battle!" Then he remembered something else.

The old man paused, as if he didn't understand what "fell in battle" meant. Suddenly, his whole body swayed, his hands reaching out, grasping at the air as if trying to catch something. The village head rushed up to support him. The old man waved his hand and said, "It's nothing, just a moment of dizziness, an old ailment." He stood there dazed for a long time before nodding to the NCOs and saying, "Coming from so far away, it's hard on you two officers to make the trip. Come home and sit for a while."
