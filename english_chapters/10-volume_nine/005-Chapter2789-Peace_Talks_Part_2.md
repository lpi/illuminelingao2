# Chapter 2789: Peace Talks (Part 2)

The composition of these people was quite complex. There were local officials as well as high-ranking court officials. Although they had never truly contacted a real Kun Thief, they had long been hearing about and witnessing many "Nanyang Goods." From the intertwined relationship network, they learned about the words and deeds of Kun Thieves—especially after Kun Thieves captured Guangdong and Guangxi, officials of Guangdong and Guangxi origin serving in the Capital or outside all tried their best to contact relatives and old friends in the "Enemy Occupied Area" to inquire about the safety of their own families and properties.

After the fighting subsided, some officials even specially sent people home to visit the situation. There were even retired officials who, eager for home, returned directly to their homeland.

What they saw and heard was more naked and accurate than the news "embellished" out of various purposes by various relevant interest parties presented to the Emperor.

Perhaps feelings and judgments varied, but they knew the capability of Kun Thieves clearer than anyone.

Kun Thieves were indeed "Barbarians," but they were "Barbarians" completely different from the past. Not only did they shamelessly desire to "sit as equals," but they also mastered destructive power.

This kind of power made them awe-struck, yet fascinated them. The Kun Thieves' skill of "touching stone into gold" was never a legend, but reality.

The dynasty was swaying in the midst of a storm. Great Ming had been around for nearly three hundred years. Since the Ancestral Dragon (Qin Shi Huang), among past dynasties, except for the Great Han which had the Guangwu Restoration, no dynasty could survive past three hundred years.

The lifespan of Great Ming was almost up. This was a thing many people had already realized.

Although the gentry had more or less prepared for the change of dynasty, world affairs were hard to predict. Every change of dynasty would always bring intense social turmoil. Many prominent families declined. "Turning into founding fathers of another dynasty" was not a share for everyone. As a vested interest group, maintaining the existing court was obviously safer.

Kun Thieves were not peasant armies that the court couldn't suppress; nor were they East Barbarians who could be blocked by piling people and fortresses. "Peace talks" became a reasonable choice.

This kind of thinking had appeared before the Mainland Strategy, only at that time the voice was relatively weak, just "amnesty" similar to Zheng Zhilong.

Now Xiong Wencan, huddled in a corner of Guangxi, had seriously considered this issue and sent people several times to try to contact the Senate.

With the unfolding of the Senate's Mainland Strategy, Great Ming collapsed completely on the Guangdong and Guangxi battle lines. Added to the ravage of peasant armies and Manchus entering the Pass, under the pincer attack of three parties, the voice of "peace talks" and "pacification" naturally rose in the battered and exhausted court.

"...These people are headed by Vice Minister of War Wang Yehao—that is, Shi Weng."

"Unexpectedly Shi Weng's vision is really not bad."

"This is very natural. His understanding of our strength far exceeds all officials of Great Ming. The heart for peace talks is probably even more urgent." Xu Ke took the conversation, "This kidnapping incident, investigating its root cause, was also to use this to seek peace. Just that he was led astray by his subordinates. So, public opinion preparation in the court and the Emperor's intention actually already exist. But..."

There were two biggest obstacles. One was the Emperor's face had to be handled thoughtfully—originally treating funerals as happy events was not a difficult thing for the bureaucratic group. The key problem came from the second obstacle: Factional Dispute.

Factional disputes at the end of Ming developed to the highest climax under Chongzhen's mentality of "hating forming cliques most." Any policy would become a reason for political enemies to attack, reaching the state of "not asking right or wrong, only looking at the butt (position)." Once a big matter like "peace talks" was proposed, it would inevitably attract concentrated attacks from the hostile side. This intense tearing B (bitch fight) made Great Ming waver on many major decisions, looking ahead and behind, causing extremely high internal friction.

Guo Yi, who had been maintaining silence, asked: "What reason do we have to believe that the Great Ming court will unite to negotiate peace this time?"

"Regarding the Great Ming court's decision, we actually have no ability to grasp it." Jiang Shan said, "Perhaps we can influence it, but the final result is still a random number. The only thing that can be certain is that in the not too distant future—probably next year, Great Ming will launch a comprehensive punitive expedition against us."

"If peace talks can be facilitated, it would be a good thing." Ran Yao commented, "Pity!"

As the chief of the security department, he was especially enthusiastic about peace talks. War brought not only dividends but also many, many social problems. Leaving aside those new recovered counties and prefectures in Guangdong and Guangxi with complex public security situations, just for the Senate's lair Hainan Island, various public security problems caused by war were not few.

On one hand, the newly established local governments urgently needed police personnel; on the other hand, there was an extremely tight shortage of manpower.

"It would be best if trade can be resumed. Now our foreign trade with Ming has shrunk severely." Si Kaide said, "Can we adopt some means? For example, killing those who oppose..."

The commercial department equally eagerly hoped for peace talks. Although there were many channels to sell "Australian goods" to the mainland, the "illegal" status made such trade often incur many extra costs.

"It's not impossible to do, just that wanting to turn the situation around by killing a few people is probably very difficult—and Great Ming civil officials are quite stubborn..."

"Forcing peace by war isn't impossible to consider!" Xu Ke said, "We can't purely conduct defense. This way won't hurt the enemy. Must give them a few ruthless blows, let the Great Ming monarch and ministers practically feel the danger of national subjugation without peace talks, then they will not haggle over face issues and sit down to negotiate. For example, we land directly at Tianjin and kill our way to the Capital!"

"Doing a 'Convention of Beijing'? That's a train of thought."

"I'm afraid Chongzhen won't be as flexible in body posture as Xianfeng."

"The military also proposed this matter. But the movement is too big, afraid a resolution can only be made after the Senate discusses..."

...

Opinions varied in the conference room. Everyone was offering advice and suggestions on how to force Great Ming to negotiate peace.

"After all, we are not omnipotent. Some things still depend on the development of the situation." Jiang Shan interrupted the heated discussion. Continuing to say, "Next we invite Comrade Xu Ke of the Reconnaissance General Bureau to give an explanation on matters related to the Shi Weng group in this operation."

Everyone was energized. In these years, the Shi Weng group became a lingering fly on the Senate's head. Although it couldn't cause much damage, it was very annoying. Moreover, the matter of suspected transmigrators inside the Shi Weng group also troubled everyone.

Xu Ke immediately explained the situation involving the Shi Weng group in this operation one by one.

"...We have ample reasons to believe that this suspected transmigrator Mr. Le is the most critical figure in the entire Shi Weng group. Due to his capture, the Shi Weng group will no longer pose a major threat to us in the future."

"Is he a transmigrator after all? If so, how did he come here?" Shalina was very interested in this person's identity and asked a question for the first time.

"Regarding his specific identity, we have no way to know. But the person has been handed over to comrades of the Political Security Bureau. Believe the truth will be known soon. As for how he arrived if he really is a transmigrator, I think it is very likely the same thing as Landu (Lando)."

Hearing that the Political Security Bureau was responsible for this matter, Shalina raised her eyebrows with some disgust. But she controlled her emotions well, then pursued asking: "If he is, what attitude will the Senate hold?"

"This, the Senate has relevant General Assembly resolutions." Xu Ke dodged this question slyly.

"I feel, if he really is. It would be a very troublesome thing." Ran Yao spoke slowly, he asked: "Xu Ke, you said in previous reports that he is a Cantonese..."

"Correct, just in a village outside Guangzhou."

"Alright, suppose he is a transmigrator, and transmigrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou. Referencing the situation of Lando and that gang being swept into the space-time storm at Dongsha. What does this mean?" Ran Yao said, "It means centering on our transmigration location Qiongzhou Strait, space-time teleportation might have occurred within hundreds of kilometers surrounding it!"

"You mean, perhaps such space-time transmigrators are more than just these few?!" Jiang Shan shivered.

"Very possible! Lando and Black (Heier) can be explained by coincidence. If another one comes... how else to explain?"

"Good Heavens!"

Everyone present felt uneasy about this prospect. Because none of these few was a fuel-saving lamp (easy to deal with). If a few more came, the Senate would have endless tossing and turning.

"Should we propose to the Senate to conduct a large-scale screening of suspected transmigrators in Guangdong and Hainan regions?"

Guo Yi coughed lightly and said: "I think everyone doesn't need to be nervous. After all, whether Mr. Le is a transmigrator cannot be confirmed yet. His mastery of some old space-time knowledge may not necessarily come from the old space-time. This conclusion is better made after the interrogation result; secondly, it's been more than ten years since transmigration. Our intelligence sources are already very extensive, not limited to a corner of the southeast. If they really exist, an awl in a bag must have shown its traces. Yet we haven't received such news. This shows a high probability that there are no other transmigrators—taking a step back, even if they exist, having not made a bit of noise these years, either their ability is mediocre, or they have no ambition. Neither is enough to be a trouble."

These words calmed everyone's emotions somewhat. Guo Yi continued:

"Paying attention to whether there are other transmigrators is one of the key works our intelligence/security agencies focus on, but should not be the main work. Otherwise, this work target is too huge, and inevitably has the suspicion of chasing wind and catching shadows."

Jiang Shan nodded slightly, thinking this Comrade Guo still had quite some ideas. Indeed, really spending effort to trace "suspected transmigrators" without a bit of clue was a huge waste of resources. Moreover, even if found, what then? Can't assume "potential danger" and eliminate them; this would be too cruel.

"I agree with Comrade Guo Yi's view. Currently, the most main work is still to confirm the origin of this Zhou Lezhi, and simultaneously grasp the inside information of the Shi Weng group."
