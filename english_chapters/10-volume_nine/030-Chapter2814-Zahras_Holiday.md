# Chapter 2814 Zahra's Holiday

He strolled aimlessly along the street. His uniform, the braid on his cuffs, the medals on his chest, and the NCO's sword at his waist all drew the attention of passersby.

Being the focus of attention—especially the adoring gazes of certain young ladies—gave him a proud feeling. This was the realm he had once fought to protect. Before, he hadn't quite understood when the Senators said "the people's realm must be protected by the people themselves." He thought: isn't this realm the Senate's? We carry rifles just to get paid. Later, after much fighting and seeing how society had changed, he came to feel this way. "The Senate and the People"—this really wasn't empty talk.

Bairen was more prosperous than before. He marveled silently. In two years, so many new shops and goods he'd never seen had appeared. Some he didn't even know what they were for. Truly, if you don't study for three days, you can't keep up...

Just as he was sighing, a small commotion stirred on the street. Tan Shuangxi, soldier though he was, also had that traditional Chinese fondness. He quickened his steps to catch up.

What he saw was a foreign girl waiting for a coach at the public carriage stop. From her attire, she was clearly a Senator's "maid." Though Lingao had grown ever more prosperous over the years, and "ghosts" from East and West had increased through "capture," "trade," or "employment"—common folk were quite used to seeing them—female "ghosts" were still rare. Women of this era, East or West, seldom traveled far.

The exotically colored maids of the Senators had long been an enduring topic in Lingao society. So every appearance drew many curious onlookers.

As one of the senior veterans of the First Battalion, Tan Shuangxi had performed security duty for major events many times and had been temporarily assigned to guard Senator residential areas and offices in Bairen City. So he had seen the "ghost girl" maids around the Senators more than once.

Though curious, he never thought "ghost girls" were pretty. To him, their multicolored hair, blue or brown irises, and overly deep and defined features made them look "like ghosts." This wasn't just his view; privately, soldiers had all expressed "incomprehension" of the Senators' peculiar taste.

Of course, the Senators were unfathomably deep; to naturalized citizens, they were nearly "demigods." Such strange proclivities could only be attributed to "Senators just aren't ordinary people."

The maid before him, Tan Shuangxi found somewhat familiar. He thought he'd seen her multiple times when he was on guard duty at the "Data Center." A guard soldier on duty with him had said this ghost girl was a Persian.

Persian—Tan Shuangxi had heard the name. Old folks in the village, when telling tales of old, said the earliest to arrive by sea for trade weren't the yellow- or red-haired Franks, but Arabs, Persians, and Indians. They also said hundreds of years ago many such people lived in Fujian, then were all killed.

But that was just "old tales." A living Persian—a woman at that—appearing beside him still struck Tan Shuangxi as quite astonishing.

With the jingling of coach bells, two tall black horses pulling a carriage slowly entered the platform. This coach was very large and double-decked. The upper deck was open-air, perfect for sightseeing and riding in the breeze. Tan Shuangxi had wanted to ride this coach for a long time. The platform attendant blew a whistle and waved a small flag, sternly shouting: "Line up! Line up! What's all the crowding!"

People reluctantly formed a queue. The coach had two doors—front to board, rear to exit. No breaking the rules.

Seeing Tan Shuangxi also in the queue, the attendant immediately called out: "Make way for this military comrade!"

Though the rule "military personnel enjoy priority on public transportation" had long existed, Tan Shuangxi still felt somewhat embarrassed. He waved his hands hastily: "No need, no need. I'll board in line."

Fortunately, not many were queuing. Many passengers got off at Bairen Town stop, so it wasn't crowded. Tan Shuangxi climbed easily to the upper deck and sat down. Glancing around, he saw the Persian maid had also boarded and was sitting near the front, gazing at the street scenery, unaware she had become part of the scenery herself.

Zahra on the public coach was oblivious to the stares around her. After the slave market in Basra, no gaze could make her shy anymore. The coach started with a crisp ring of bells. This route traversed all of Bairen Town, offering views of the streets and also of the many buildings inside the once-mysterious Bairen City now accessible due to its opening. It could be called the quintessential route of Bairen Market and had become a new sightseeing line for visitors.

On the other side of the road, a bustling construction site was underway. The old East Gate Market, now Bairen Town, was expanding rapidly. The extension project for the Lingao Urban Rail was also proceeding accordingly.

Two thick iron rails were being laid atop a gravel foundation and wooden ties. Zahra knew this was the railroad that Senator Xu had once taken her on, now being extended. Like most ordinary people, the train was the most incredible thing she had seen in Lingao. These giant steel dragons were like the Senate's ruling power—so invincible and overwhelming.

The coach dropped Zahra off at the junction between East Gate Market and the old Bairen City entrance. Though the old Bairen City no longer existed in name, some important buildings still remained behind high walls and guards, inaccessible to ordinary people. From the coach's upper deck, however, one could see the Data Center's quite prominent red-brick truss building. Regarding this building's purpose, natives and naturalized citizens had imagined countless theories, from a treasure vault to a torture chamber. The Persian girl knew Senator Xu worked here—but she no longer had a pass to enter and could only gaze from afar like everyone else.

East Gate Avenue, leading from the Bairen City entrance to East Gate Market center and East Gate Train Station, was the most prosperous commercial stretch in all Lingao. The bamboo sheds erected at the city's founding had completely vanished. The two-story trade halls that once stood out like cranes among chickens had been crowded nearly out of sight by the four- and five-story buildings that had since risen around them.

These new buildings, uniformly planned by commercial departments, generally adopted an arcade design. Their ground floors were high-ceilinged, with continuous colonnades and recessed large glass display windows. Between the colonnades and windows ran a stone-paved pedestrian path wide enough for three or four people abreast, forming the arcade structure common in old-timeline southern cities. The arcade corridors connected one to the next; even at the alleys separating different buildings, there were usually connecting awnings. Theoretically, even in rain, pedestrians could walk without getting a single drop on them.

This design was very popular in old-timeline Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan, with its presence common in Southeast Asia too—a successful commercial building design for tropical and subtropical southern regions.

The road itself had been repaired and widened. To support the traffic rule of separating fast and slow lanes, the center of the road was divided into two fast lanes for automobiles and carriages, while two slow lanes flanked them for rickshaws and bicycles. Similar to the old timeline, flower beds and shade trees were constructed between fast and slow lanes. Unlike the old timeline, the slow lanes were no less wide than the fast lanes, to accommodate Lingao's current reality where slow vehicles predominated.

Besides these visible changes, many hidden works had been added. Gas street lamps were uniformly moved into the flower beds and among the trees. Their frames were reinforced, and iron crossbars were added between each pair of facing street lamp frames for hanging the Senate's latest slogans and advertisements for nearby shops. Beneath the pedestrian path's stone slabs was actually a reserved utility tunnel.

To avoid the old-timeline blight of cables everywhere and roads constantly cut open, this renovation planning resolved from the start to standardize correctly by using pre-installed utility tunnels for all piping. Thus, pedestrians walking above didn't know that beneath their feet ran water supply pipes, drainage pipes, and gas pipes crisscrossing, with telephone and power cables to follow. The street-facing buildings would connect in sequence according to regulations, enjoying these services while paying the corresponding fees.

Since the agreed time was still ample, the Persian girl was in a leisurely mood. Senator Xu had a 24-hour marathon shift today. The children had all been taken to Lingao Corner Park by Xu Shanshan. With nothing to do, she could leisurely enjoy this rare holiday. Meet a friend or two. She admired the passing shops. Even having come many times, this street still overwhelmed her, full of desire to buy. Before coming to Lingao, she'd seen the dazzling array of foreign goods in Basra's markets. She'd never imagined a world with so many different types of products, displayed in such dazzling ways.

In the new round of commercial district planning, the Commercial Department introduced the old-timeline concept of targeted merchant recruitment. Shop attributes and types along the street were consciously classified to benefit market prosperity and differentiated competition, while also balancing Senate-owned enterprises and private outside shops. On one hand, flagship stores for various departments were centrally opened; on the other, some capable outside trading houses were actively introduced.

Take the Meimei Department Store that Zahra was now passing—a flagship store jointly opened by the Commerce Committee and Light Industry departments. Like its old-timeline counterpart, this was a department store targeting beauty-loving women, with clothing, undergarments, bags, and accessories as core offerings. Li Mei had originally proposed the name "Women's Products Store" at an internal meeting, but some Senators thought that sounded too rustic—like a sanitary pad specialty shop—so it was changed to this more refined old-timeline name.
