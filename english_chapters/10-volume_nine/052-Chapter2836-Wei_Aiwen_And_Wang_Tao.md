# Chapter 2836 Wei Aiwen and Wang Tao

When Wei Aiwen returned to his office from He Ming's office, Wang Tao had already been chatting animatedly with Wei Aiwen's female orderly in the lounge for over an hour.

Seeing Wei Aiwen's unhappy expression, the female orderly quickly assumed the posture of working diligently at her desk.

"Alright, alright, stop pretending. Go get two bottles of kvass—iced!"

"I don't need any. I've already had several bottles."

Wei Aiwen ignored him. He plopped down in the large high-backed chair across from Wang Tao, pulled a cigar from the box on the desk, and lit one for himself.

The female orderly brought the chilled kvass. Wei Aiwen impatiently waved her away, then downed two bottles in one go—but still couldn't suppress the fire in his heart.

"Bottom!"

"What?!" Wang Tao didn't understand this new term.

"Nothing!"

In Wei Aiwen's view, He Ming was a competent commander—whether in combat command, military training, or staff work, there wasn't much to criticize, at least not in his opinion. But he was an unqualified Minister of Defense—of course, now called by that ridiculous title "Armed Forces Minister." Before the Senate and the Council of State, he always had that look of "guaranteed to complete the mission" while being trampled upon.

"Ma Qianzhu's good boy." This was a nickname circulating among the Soy Sauce Crowd, referring to the cadres Ma Qianzhu had promoted and entrusted with important responsibilities during his years at Planning Commission, General Staff, and Council of State. Most were cadres with great "sense of the big picture" who rarely clashed openly over departmental interests. In other words, in the Soy Sauce Crowd's eyes, these cadres just followed Ma's lead—they were the Ma faction. Under normal circumstances, Wei Aiwen treated such gossip as just gossip. But this time, he was getting restless. He'd learned at drinking parties that recently Dingding had been rampaging around, promoting his strategy everywhere. Livelihood, medical, education, and other sectors were all scrambling to sell out for favor. When Dingding's claws reached into the military, the Mainland Cultural Infiltration Strategy would encompass all departments' northern operations. What pained Wei Aiwen even more was that He Ming's attitude toward this was "proceed from the big picture, give strong support." There was nothing wrong with He Ming saying that. But the work he assigned to Wei Aiwen was exactly that, leaving Wei Aiwen feeling like the eunuch worrying more than the emperor.

"I'm caught between enemies on both sides now." Wei Aiwen got up, closed the door, and began pouring out his grievances to Wang Tao. "We used to stay out of each other's way, and even helped each other out plenty. But this time, Dingding has really overstepped!" The two had forged deep combat friendship during the earliest "Recall Past Bitterness" propaganda campaigns. Their relationship transcended departmental interests.

"Oh, really? How come I don't know about this?" Wang Tao said in surprise. He was one of the backbone members of the arts propaganda sector. For Dingding's Mainland Cultural Infiltration Strategy, he was also an important participant and formulator. To Wang Tao's knowledge, there really was no plan to meddle in internal military propaganda. So he was genuinely puzzled why Wei Aiwen would say this. Could Dingding have some secret he was keeping?

"I really treat you like a real brother—you're not treating me like a distant cousin, are you?" Wei Aiwen simply sat down next to Wang Tao, affectionately wrapping an arm around his neck, cigar nearly poking his face. "Your Director Ding indeed hasn't directly conducted propaganda within the military. But his quarantine camp outreach points, plus barefoot doctor training—isn't all that poaching in military camps?!"

Watching Wei Aiwen's anguished expression as he denounced Dingding's outrages, Wang Tao was puzzled. How had this touched Wei Aiwen's sensitive spot? *South Sea Thunder* and *The Ordeal* had been performed in the troops for years without Wei Aiwen objecting.

"What are you going on about? Since when did quarantine camps fall under military jurisdiction?"

"Besides refugees, what group is most numerous in quarantine camps?"

Wang Tao paused: "Troops?" He suddenly understood. Apart from Hainan itself, in terms of "overseas deployment," quarantine camps were mostly managed by the military. Naturally, the majority of workers there were soldiers.

"So what?"

Wei Aiwen apparently saw Wang Tao's confusion and continued, waving his cigar. "The key isn't the form—it's the content. Your next new play is *The Story of Pine Fort*. See, isn't this deliberately causing me trouble? As soon as the northern war eased up, ideological work in the troops immediately showed signs of slackening. You know how many discharge applications I've approved this month?" Wei Aiwen fired off complaints like a machine gun, but Wang Tao's expression grew increasingly awkward. Thinking about it, he asked, "You don't know about *The Story of Pine Fort*, do you? The earliest military romance drama. Women, family—great! Once that's performed, another pile of discharge applications will land on my desk... Isn't that picking a fight?"

Wang Tao understood now. Thinking it over, this really wasn't a big deal. Dingding had absolutely no intention of interfering with military political propaganda. The content choices might be somewhat troublesome, but that trouble couldn't be solved just by changing the subject matter. The woman problem was an unavoidable necessity—a contradiction that couldn't be evaded. The more it was evaded, the more likely problems would arise. Soldiers weren't fools. Instinctive and physiological needs couldn't be glossed over with a few words and a play.

"This is nothing. If you think it's not appropriate, we can adjust the subject matter accordingly. Besides, with troops stationed abroad fighting, they need some light, relaxing content too. A bowstring strung too tight will snap."

Wang Tao set his teacup on the coffee table, pulled a delicate enamel box from his pocket, opened it, picked out a bit of snuff and sniffed it at his nose, then asked: "You said earlier 'internal troubles and external threats.' It's probably not just this one thing, right?"

Wei Aiwen took a sip of tea, hesitated—clearly the other trouble was more thorny than Dingding's. After finishing his tea, Wei Aiwen got up and closed the office door properly. Actually, the door was already closed, with his female orderly outside—there was no risk of being overheard. This gesture just expressed how thorny this matter was. Wei Aiwen pulled a letter from his briefcase and handed it to Wang Tao. "Don't spread this around for now."

Wang Tao took the letter. Opening it with curiosity and puzzlement, he laughed out loud after reading a few lines: "Not bad education level. Really well-written. Just missing one line about 'The Senate isn't divine emperors either.'"

"This 'Post-Ordeal Impressions' was submitted through the Ten-Man Team system." Wei Aiwen said. "Credit to them for transcribing it so completely."

Wang Tao smiled and asked: "Nervous?"

"Preemptive worry." Wei Aiwen smiled. "The thing itself is nothing. People think—that's normal. Nothing unusual about it. We don't live in a vacuum. The plays we perform are based on reality, after all."

"What are you planning to do about it?"

"Nothing. Originally the person was just reflecting a bit. If you get nervous, you'll actually tip them off that there's a lot to dig into here." Wei Aiwen said. "Of course, I have to write a memo to Queen Du, asking her to 'pay more attention.' Whether she listens isn't something I can control. The rest can be left for the bigwigs at Council of State to worry about."

Seeing it was nearly mealtime, Wei Aiwen had the female orderly bring two lunches. The two ate lunch in the office. Wei Aiwen's brow finally relaxed a bit. He told Wang Tao about his just-concluded visit to find He Ming.

Wang Tao picked up a kvass bottle and clinked it with Wei Aiwen's, then laughed and cursed: "You say Old He doesn't understand politics. I think your Political Department could use a renaming too."

Wei Aiwen froze. Though the General Staff Political Department was only a "department," its actual power far exceeded a mere "department." All Fubo Army political work for military personnel fell under his jurisdiction. Most crucially, he'd built it with his own hands. If anyone else had made this joke to him, he'd have taken offense. But Wang Tao was an exception—after all, they'd been "partners" during those early founding days. Though he'd later gone to Cultural Propaganda, that bond was solid.

Wang Tao paused, then analyzed the "struggle situation" for Wei Aiwen. Dingding's plan was correct in strategic starting point, so the military couldn't oppose it, and therefore could only "give strong support." Though Wei Aiwen also agreed, from the perspective of defending his turf, he hoped to execute "strong support" as "mind my own business."

But if He Ming also pulled this, it would be purely creating problems for himself—no practical benefit, while leaving a bad impression with the Propaganda sector.

"...Maybe if you just went ahead and did it without saying anything, He Ming wouldn't say anything either. But once you explicitly bring it up, if he doesn't take a clear stance, that would be very inappropriate." Wang Tao fingered more snuff and sniffed it under his nose.

Wei Aiwen lit a Holy Ship cigarette, leaned back on the sofa, and stared at the ceiling fan for a while. Organizing his thoughts, he swallowed the self-criticism portion and said: "So you're saying passive defense won't work. Better to go on the offensive and achieve some results."

"That's the idea." Wang Tao leaned in. "Think about when we did the Recall Past Bitterness campaign—wasn't Queen Du also doing propaganda? Of course she was, and she started even earlier than us. But what we did was grounded in reality. No slogans, no theories. Soldiers were willing to participate. And then Queen Du was out of the picture—didn't she even have to thank us for the support?"

"That's the way." Wei Aiwen stroked his nonexistent little mustache, showing an expression of deep agreement.

"I'd say your pace has been a bit slow. The troops have started large-scale return and reorganization. After two years of fighting, there must be piles of ideological issues."

Once his thinking opened up, Wei Aiwen transformed into a different person. He rattled off several projects in one breath. Wang Tao helped brainstorm. The two talked until dinnertime. Wei Aiwen's notebook was already filled with several pages. Wei Aiwen grandly waved his hand: "Ziming House? My treat." Wang Tao pressed down Wei Aiwen's hand with a chuckle: "Let me take you somewhere nice."
