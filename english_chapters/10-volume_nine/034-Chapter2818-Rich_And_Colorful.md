# Chapter 2818 Rich And Colorful

In the near future, considering the overly prominent business limitations of the Ziming House brand, to avoid creating the misconception that the Checkered Skirt Club was subordinate to Ziming House, and also to avoid overuse of the word "club," the Commercial Department and the club gentlemen decided to uniformly adopt the name "Troupe East Gate" for developing the idol theater chain. In publicity, it would be completely separated from the original Ziming House Entertainment and Checkered Skirt Club, with only capital and management-level connections.

Though the name changed several times, this merger had far-reaching influence on this timeline's idol entertainment industry. Just as ancient Roman cities inevitably had theaters and arenas, cities in this timeline could usually find Ziming House and Troupe East Gate branches, spreading the distinctly different pop culture and lifestyle of Australia-Song around the world. However, since the club name happened to match Senator Dongmen Chuiyu's surname, many outsiders thought the club was Senator Dongmen's private property. This misunderstanding caused the Checkered Skirt gentlemen no shortage of trouble and disagreements.

Past the Troupe East Gate theater, which looked outlandish to outsiders, was the original flagship unit of the Cultural and Arts Department—the supremely earthy "Pili Hall Puppet Theater." Though using the same red-brick truss structure as the Central Experimental Theater, it had more traditional wooden eaves and windows, and its relatively smaller size looked more approachable. Before the theater was a small plaza, and the steps leading from there to the ticket windows were always crowded with children and young teens.

Compared to the more formal Experimental Theater and the overly niche Checkered Skirt Club, Pili Hall puppet shows currently had the widest audience and the densest performance schedule. Though called "Lingao Puppet Theater," it was actually an improved hybrid based on old-timeline Taiwanese puppetry. Naturally, many famous plays from puppetry were shamelessly "originated" by Senators in another timeline.

As the home base of the Lingao Puppet Troupe, not only were there at least four performances daily, but under the Propaganda Department's guidance, new plays were constantly being developed.

The two girls walking by didn't particularly notice the notice board by the small plaza. On its promotional poster, a girl dressed as a fisherwoman stood resolutely on a reef, braving wind and rain while holding high a storm lantern. This was actually a memorable moment in Imperial theater history, for after *The Trial* and *The Promised Land*, the third of the twelve long-running classics, *The Lighthouse*, would premiere at the puppet theater.

The launch of *The Lighthouse* was an important component of a major propaganda campaign initiated by the Australia-Song propaganda apparatus, signifying the Senate's complete change of attitude toward Zhu Ming. In this play, a female was chosen for the first time as the main subject and central figure, completely overturning traditional drama and literary depictions of women as either virtuous wife-and-mother figures or romantic heroines—considered a milestone in the women's liberation movement. In fact, Du Wen was not only an active advocate and promoter of this play but was herself one of the screenwriters.

Across the road from what would in the future be sent to museums as *The Lighthouse* prototype billboard was the under-construction "Wanbi Bookstore," an export-turned-domestic-sale establishment. The reason it could secure this prime location adjacent to the Central Experimental Theater, rather than being on neighboring Guangming Avenue next to the "Commercial Press," was that the Lingao Wanbi Bookstore was positioned as a so-called cultural bookstore. Inside the bookstore was designed a small performance atrium, providing space for opera and storytelling, with books sold emphasizing so-called literary quality. In appearance, Wanbi Bookstore basically adopted its Hangzhou store's design approach, becoming one of the rare traditional-style buildings in this area.

Past Pili Hall, the girls had already spotted a wide road parallel to East Gate Avenue—this was Guangming Avenue, equally prosperous in the future. Many thought this avenue's name was to praise the Empire's greatness, but actually the name came from the building the girls were currently passing: this timeline's first cinema—Daguangming Cinema.

Since the name "Australian shadow plays" had spread not long after the Senate's landing, this had become a must-visit for outsiders coming to Lingao. Though the Experimental Theater also intermittently showed films, its overly "artistic" atmosphere scared off many commoners. Ordinary people preferred the more accessible "cinema."

The cinema was located at the intersection of Guangming Avenue and Baihui Street. The exterior was not particularly remarkable—still the blue-brick truss architectural style—but at its top was a raised tower-style clock tower, fitted with the latest large clock from the "Taibai Watch Factory." But Zahra, who had been there before, knew the real essence was to be discovered inside.

The main screening hall was a domed structure with seating for three hundred. It had an orchestra pit. Besides screening films, it also supported stage performances. The screen product couldn't yet be manufactured, so substitutes were used—effects slightly inferior, but in this timeline, even projection onto white cloth was stunning enough. When showing "films," the dark room suddenly lit up. With a steam whistle's shriek, a train appeared on the wall, belching white steam and rushing toward the audience...

Just this alone often scared outside visitors who had only seen "Australian flip books" into fleeing out the doors. When they came to their senses and returned, they were invariably amazed at the realistic effects of "films"—truly a massive taste of Australian marvels.

However, limited by equipment, the films shown were mainly movie reels brought from the old timeline. With the continuous increase in chemical developing agent production, the Propaganda Department had already placed this art form in a prominent position in future development plans. But currently serving the public, there was still only this one.

The intersection of Guangming Avenue and Baihui Road where the Australian cinema stood would also become a famous landmark in the future. For the purpose of industrial upgrading and contesting discursive power, with Senate approval, the irregularly published Chuantouzhi was about to be upgraded to this timeline's first professional financial and trade newspaper, *Lingao Commercial Daily*. The Commercial Department would be its sponsor, with the Propaganda Department responsible for unified guidance and management. This marked the formal breaking of Propaganda Department's complete monopoly on media.

In the next decade or so, following *Lingao Commercial Daily*, *Nanyang Express*, *Financial Times*, *Story Magazine*, *Zhiyin*, *Tianshui Life Weekly*, *Knowledge Is Power*, and many other newspapers and magazines would be founded and headquartered here, transforming Guangming Avenue into the new timeline's Fleet Street. Eventually, even the initially displeased *Lingao Times* moved its editorial department here. Since the buildings of several newspaper offices enclosed a small open space, the Municipal Department added greenery, benches, and a statue of the first person in Australia-Song journalism, Senator Dingding, turning it into a modest public plaza. This came to be known as "Times Square" or "Dingding Plaza."

Times Square hadn't appeared yet, but diagonal to Daguangming Cinema, directly facing the future Commercial Daily building, the just-opened "Four Seasons Hotel" was already gleaming. This new-style hotel with its high-end old-timeline name was actually the former commercial hall under the Commercial Department. Since East Gate Market had become increasingly prosperous, keeping the notoriously rough and unhygienic foreign sailors and general merchants here was no longer appropriate. Thus, led by the Commerce Department with cooperation from the Foreign Affairs Department and Port Authority, the original facilities for sailors in the Bopu area were expanded and rebuilt into the new commercial hall.

The original commercial hall was renovated and expanded. The accommodation portion's exterior was largely unchanged, only with internal room renovations, particularly adding independent bathroom facilities to each room. Meanwhile, the original Senator reception area was opened as a lobby, with bars, laundries, and other guest services added, making it this timeline's new high-end hotel serving Senators and premium clients. This change also had the intention of competing with Longhao Bay Resort. After all, for luxury enjoyment, "Australian-style" still had to set the standard.

The original commercial hall's most famous attached dining section, originally called the Commercial Hall Restaurant, was given the independent brand "Xinghua House." It would temporarily continue operating as a hotel subsidiary, with future plans for independent operation and allowing franchise stores. The newly branded Commercial Hall Restaurant was quite energetic. Besides keeping the original building, they built an entirely new three-story building along Guangming Street. Not only with large glass windows and all-new décor, but on its rooftop was an open terrace—watching the bustling Baihui Road while enjoying beer and barbecue became the favorite of some local naturalized citizens.

Directly facing the new Xinghua House Restaurant was the destination the girls crossing the road were about to reach: Peony House East Gate Main Store.

The two girls crossing the road were drawn less by the map than by the aroma wafting into their nostrils. Even standing on the other side of Baihui Street, they could smell the strange food scent in the air. It was an indescribable experience—at first sniff a bit of choking cooking fumes, yet with a certain tantalizing power that created a peculiar hunger. Wave after wave of fragrance struck, making the girls quicken their pace.

Before them was a typical three-story Australian-style truss building. What was special was its alternating layers of blue and red brick. At the top of the building stood a golden logo almost a full story tall. The logo was shaped like two side-by-side Chinese-style memorial arches, but no matter how the girls looked at it, it seemed like a slightly distorted English letter "M." Beside the arch logo, "Peony House" in three Song-style characters confirmed they had reached their destination.
