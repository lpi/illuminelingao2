# Chapter 2827 Performance Troupes

Once the conversation reached this level, some previously unspeakable secrets could now be openly discussed. Sikade revealed a semi-public secret: using Jiangnan literati's pooled capital, Hangzhou Station had specifically established a Yangtze River Shipping company, running routes from Jiangnan to Kaohsiung and Lingao.

"What's so special about that? Wasn't it the same when establishing Zhaoshangju? Just attracting private shares."

"The Senate put in shares for Zhaoshangju." Sikade said. "Yangtze River Shipping—Hangzhou Station didn't put in a single cent." Sikade spoke very quietly, even though only he and Dingding were in the room. Speaking quietly was just to convey secrecy. Then Sikade added: "Joint ventures have great potential."

Dingding thought about it. Finding a native merchant registered in Lingao to incorporate a company and register a few ships—this was all currently legal and above-board. Given the current massive shipping capacity gap, neither the Council of State nor Dabo Shipping as a competitor would have any objections. From start to finish, Zhao Yingong didn't need to do anything—just have someone around him run through the process. Whatever share percentage was obtained was pure profit—really easy money.

"Brilliant, truly brilliant." Dingding gave a thumbs up. The two burst out laughing.

Lying on a massage bed at Ziming House, feeling the gentle pressure of massage on his back, Dingding's muddled mind slowly cleared. He'd drunk a bit too much at lunch. His mood was elated. With Health and Colonial Trade's cooperation, plus a big shot in the Fubo Army already sorted out for him, this plan could officially launch now. Tomorrow, write up a proposal, arrange the first batch of personnel to dispatch, file with the Council of State, and they could get moving. On the surface, this plan didn't gain him much benefit. But thinking the other way, this was the first time he'd led such a large plan involving so many parties. As long as it got done, no one could deny that Dingding had commanded the entire operation.

The qualification of having led a major project—before, Dingding hadn't seen its importance. Now he was starting to get the significance.

He was still young. He still wanted to "advance." But to climb higher, these things became very important. Just as Ma Qianzhu had privately chatted with him: "Without having done practical work, without having commanded large operations involving hundreds or thousands of people, will Senators—especially those somewhat rational soy sauce Senators—feel confident voting for you?"

"Grind reputation, grind prestige. Maybe I can't make it in time for the next Plenary two years from now, but the one after that, hard to say..." Dingding thought to himself.

By the time he returned from Ziming House to the Propaganda Department office in the "Central Administrative District" in the old Lingao county seat, it was already almost 5 PM. At this moment, he was invigorated and full of energy. The moment he stepped into the lobby, a terrible message spread through all the Propaganda Department offices: "Overtime tonight!"

The Senate's administrative organs now enforced a 10-hour work system: 8 AM to 6 PM, with one hour for lunch and rest in the middle—effectively a 9-hour work system.

However, in reality, Senators' work hours were often completely unpredictable. Most Senators not only worked 996 but sometimes stayed in the office for days on end without going home, sleeping in the office dormitory when tired, then working again when awake. This made the departments they managed miserable. Because if the boss didn't leave, subordinates couldn't leave—who knew when he might suddenly summon someone for a talk or ask for some materials?

Such complaints were originally limited to Senators' personal staff or apprentices and students. Gradually, as Senators' power and status grew, their diligent work also spread to entire units under their jurisdiction, making naturalized citizens miserable.

Finally, relevant departments had to step in to regulate and limit Senators' work hours, preventing them from acting arbitrarily and disrupting everyone's biological clocks.

Dingding coming to the office at 5 PM meant that even with Senate restrictions, his subordinates probably couldn't leave until after 8 PM at the earliest. Everyone waited in trepidation for the general affairs girl to come out to "order dinner."

Fortunately, the general affairs girl didn't come out to order dinner. Dingding returning to the office was more to organize his thoughts than to urgently handle any business.

The institutional restructuring hadn't greatly affected his department. Currently, he still managed the old Propaganda section. Though Hu Qingbai was "Minister," he basically didn't concern himself with non-education business.

His jurisdiction wasn't large, but there were many organizations. Any department touching culture or propaganda was under his command. The Propaganda Department building's lobby displayed all its subordinate departments and organizations: Radio Station, *Lingao Times*, Lingao Puppet Troupe, Central Experimental Art Troupe...

The dazzling array of signs was considerable, but broken down specifically, there were really only three parts: publishing, performance, and mass arts. Correspondingly, there were three departments: Propaganda Division, Performance Management Division, and Mass Arts Division.

In the old timeline, his role would be management and guidance. But in this timeline, he also had to do the actual work. Called management, but really operating too.

Take periodically published newspapers and magazines. Whether internal distribution or public sale, from editing, proofreading, final proofs to distribution, everything initially required Senators to do personally. Over these ten years, thanks to the education system's outstanding contributions, Dingding had managed to gradually sort out and delegate these tasks. But naturalized citizens' abilities and knowledge had limitations. Many things still needed Senators to handle personally.

Dingding's wife Penny was now stationed at Guangming-jie in Bairen Town, serving as editor-in-chief of numerous publishing houses, newspapers, and magazines combined. As for the most crucial *Lingao Times*, *Morning Star*, and *Weekly News* editor-in-chief positions—for prudence, Dingding still held those himself.

Performance troupes were relatively less dependent on Senators. After all, the 17th century still had some folk performance groups—circus troupes, puppet troupes, local folk art troupes, various folk artists. But they commonly had problems: small scale, low performance level, unsuitable repertoire. Moreover, most performers were impoverished. Without appropriate guarantees, they'd mostly wander off. Completely unable to "control the team."

So despite liking to talk about "marketization," the Senate in the arts field ultimately had to return to the old path of "official troupes."

Neither Dingding nor the entire Senate liked "government-run performance troupes." Because every additional troupe and project meant additional headcount and operating expenses.

But the problem was, without running them themselves, many new performance forms and content simply couldn't be promoted. The currently flourishing Lingao puppet shows had largely taken off due to the abundant nourishment provided by the Senate. Otherwise, it would just be family troupes doing market-fair-style performances of old repertoire.

So "publicly-run troupes" snowballed into existence along with circumstances and Senators' personal interests. The oldest and most famous was naturally the Lingao Puppet Troupe. Though named "Lingao," it was actually Dingding's strongest performance group. Next was the Central Experimental Art Troupe. The art categories under this troupe were practically comprehensive: music, drama, musicals, children's theater, various singing and dancing styles... Whether conditions existed to perform or not, as long as some Senator knew a little bit, everything was set up with professional or amateur performers selected. Whether they could perform was aside; first, spread the relevant theory, knowledge, and techniques. Its subordinate Lingao Western Orchestra and Folk Music Ensemble frequently performed at various occasions, also filling in as military band for major events. Indeed, the military band performing at every Senate parade or major activity wasn't actually military personnel. Ranked last was the Lingao Opera Society, including folk opera and folk arts excavated in this timeline, plus folk art categories transplanted from the old timeline.

Benefiting from the expansion of the salaried class under Senate rule and improvement in farmers' living standards, common people had a little spare money for cultural entertainment. The puppet troupe and Lingao Opera Society's overall revenue was quite good. Especially the earthy, folksy Lingao Opera Society—with virtually no investment, its profit margin was actually higher than the puppet troupe's.

Overall, Dingding wasn't too happy having such large performance troupes under him. This wasn't entirely about fiscal expenditure—except for the Experimental Art Troupe, the puppet troupe and opera society could currently sustain themselves. But he knew that any government-run troupe would inevitably develop many problems and contradictions over time. According to "Ten Person Group" internal reports, several of Wang Tao's storytelling apprentices in the Opera Society had expressed varying degrees of "strange talk."

Wang Tao had also discussed this with him. He'd taken on quite a few apprentices, originally mostly "art activists" doing amateur performances in the military and enterprises. Later when the Opera Society was established, some higher-level apprentices were centrally transferred over for him to specially train as professional performers.

Thanks to Wang Tao's relatively professional performance level from the old timeline, plus the massive audio materials in the Grand Library—not just traditional storytelling, but also audiobook versions of many web novels—once promoted, it immediately became popular. Compared to popular literature published by Propaganda, storytelling had a lower audience threshold. So a "storytelling craze" quickly formed, with performance invitations pouring in.

This craze was certainly worth celebrating. But with box office success, some people quickly became stars. With the emergence and growing pulling power of "star performers," the question of "who supports whom" inevitably arose.

Of course, Wang Tao as the "founding master" could still suppress them for now. But suppressing meant "oral compliance" not "heartfelt compliance." So Dingding discussed with Wang Tao and others: rather than waiting for internal problems to ferment before dealing with them, better to begin restructuring now.
