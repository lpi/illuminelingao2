# Chapter 2844 Childhood Friends

"Just divorced like that?" Tan Shuangxi still hadn't recovered from the shock, murmuring to himself. Divorce wasn't a new word to him—he heard it often. But someone he knew getting divorced—this was a first.

"What else could they do?" Old Chen exhaled a smoke ring and sighed. "Her parents both came to counsel, brother and sister-in-law too. Said Caiwang was honest and proper, a solid farmer, family doing fine, in-laws weren't nasty people. What was wrong with him! But they couldn't override her! After all, it's the Senate's 'law'—if one party asks for divorce, both can separate. Even if the family disagreed, if she made a scene at the county court, it'd be the same result. Better to preserve some dignity."

Tan Shuangxi still hadn't recovered from this shock. He just nodded silently. In the military, some people always had "your wife dumped you" and "get divorced when you go back" on their lips. But the Senate had policies protecting military marriages, so divorce was rarely heard of.

"Could this woman have had someone on the side?" Tan Shuangxi suddenly thought of the puppet drama *A Flower Coin* he'd seen, promoting freedom of marriage—the heroine was exactly like this.

"Probably." The old scholar said. "Only she wouldn't admit to having an affair. Just said she and Caiwang weren't compatible, couldn't live together. A woman still has some sense of shame."

"If she had shame, she wouldn't divorce."

"I say she's just greedy for money!"

"She's got a wild man!"

...

The "news center" immediately erupted in denunciation of "former Sister-in-law Caiwang." Everyone agreed Caiwang hadn't done anything wrong. In short, the consensus was that Caiwang was "unlucky."

"...Not only did his wife run off, he lost a big sum of money too!"

"Bride price?"

"Exactly, bride price." Old Chen stubbed out his cigarette, which had burned down to his fingers. "Sixty dollars! Her family would only refund half. His dad went begging everywhere. I helped speak for them. Finally, the village put together a group to complain at the town office. The town's Justice Section mediated—in the end, two-thirds was refunded."

"Think about it—a solid twenty dollars just gone like that. Caiwang's family works the dirt. How many dollars can they save in a year? That woman, just a year and she made off with twenty dollars! The world is going to hell!" The old scholar was indignant.

Tan Shuangxi didn't know what to say. In the military, he rarely heard of such jarring things. Now he found it somewhat hard to accept. Suddenly he remembered his agreement with Yang Zhaodi. He had the unpleasant feeling of having eaten a fly. Could that girl be playing some trick to deceive and use him?!

He immediately sank into anxiety and suspicion. His expression changed. He made a few hasty responses and walked away.

Tan Shuangxi wandered aimlessly along the small river, calming his emotions. Thinking it over, Yang Zhaodi hadn't actually deceived him about anything. As for that promise, it didn't really matter. After all, no one had come to ask if things had worked out. If they asked, he could give a vague answer. Besides, he could just report to the Political Department in a month or two that the two had broken up—if married people could divorce, why couldn't people who were dating break up?

Besides, his marriage was guaranteed by the Senate. He really didn't need these worries. Thinking this, his gloomy mood lightened somewhat.

With lighter spirits, his steps grew lighter too. Just as he was passing a stretch of fields, a familiar figure suddenly appeared before him, repairing a leaky spot on a channel bank. Looking closely—who else but Caiwang!

Caiwang's silhouette in the sunlight seemed somewhat lonely. His movements were practiced and strong, but Tan Shuangxi could sense a trace of fatigue emanating from him.

Tan Shuangxi quickened his pace and walked up behind Caiwang, calling softly: "Caiwang."

Caiwang's body tensed. He turned around, surprise on his face. A flash of complex emotion passed through his eyes, quickly replaced by a smile. "Shuangxi? You're back!" His voice was a bit hoarse, but more than that, it was surprised joy.

The two embraced tightly, then Caiwang stepped back, looking Tan Shuangxi up and down.

"Look at you—more and more like a soldier." He laughed, then looked him over again. "Everyone says you got promoted..."

"Acting platoon leader—still just an enlisted boss." Tan Shuangxi laughed too. He patted Caiwang's shoulder. "And you look more and more like an old hand farmer."

Caiwang was a year older than him—already past the green of youth. Field labor had made his frame husky, also etching lines into his skin.

The two exchanged smiles. Caiwang pointed at a rock on the channel bank: "Come, sit." They sat down. Caiwang pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and handed one to Tan Shuangxi, taking one for himself.

Tan Shuangxi saw his cigarettes were the cheapest white-shell Big Production. He wanted to offer his own but worried about giving the wrong impression, so he just took out matches and lit up.

"Fixing channels?"

"Mm. Rain's been light lately. Good time to do repairs." Caiwang said. "Family took on another ten-plus *mu* this year. Planning to go all out next year."

Tan Shuangxi knew: Caiwang's family didn't have much labor. Besides his parents, Caiwang had a married-off older sister, and a younger brother still only around ten—not really a laborer yet.

"Your family's short on labor. Can you farm all that?"

Caiwang lowered his head and silently smoked a few puffs. Then he looked up: "Originally had over forty *mu*. This time I talked it over with Dad—we'll take on another ten-plus and round up to sixty *mu*. We already have one ox. This time I agreed with the Heavenly Land Society to take out a loan for another one. While grain prices are good these years, we'll grow more grain and earn more money."

"That's a lot of hard work. Can you manage?"

"Can't manage still gotta grit your teeth and do it. No choice—gotta make up the losses." Caiwang sighed. "By the way, any plans now that you're back? I heard from Old Chen that veterans can be discharged this time."

Tan Shuangxi sighed. "Not planning to come back yet. Still got fighting to do. I'll just spend time with family for now."

He paused. "What about you? Any plans?"

Caiwang gave a bitter smile. "What plans could I have? Just keep on like this." His gaze fell on the distant fields, eyes carrying a trace of confusion.

Tan Shuangxi watched him, feeling uncomfortable. He knew these past two years hadn't been easy for Caiwang. He wanted to help but didn't know where to start.

"I heard your wife..." Tan Shuangxi hesitated but still brought it up.

Caiwang took a deep drag, then slowly exhaled, eyes somewhat unfocused. "Yeah. She left." His voice carried a trace of helplessness.

Tan Shuangxi was silent for a while. Finally he said: "Having this happen to you—rotten luck."

"Rotten luck." Caiwang shook his head. "When we were matchmaking, they said she'd graduated from Fangcaodi elementary and even self-studied to pass the A-class diploma. I thought it was pretty good—having a wife who could read and do math, how could the family not prosper?"

"She didn't object during the meeting?"

"After the meeting, the matchmaker said the girl was willing. First days after marriage were fine. Later she said she wanted to try for the Agricultural Technical Vocational School. I thought that was fine too—knowledge isn't a bad thing. Look at the agricultural technicians in the Heavenly Land Society—they're all from the Agricultural School. Really know how to farm. So I told her to study hard; we'd handle the housework."

"Then what?"

"Passed the exam and immediately asked for divorce." Caiwang's eyes reddened slightly. "Shuangxi, you probably don't know—it was a bolt from the blue. I never imagined in my dreams. The day before, everything was fine..."

Tan Shuangxi didn't know what to say. Before, watching plays and listening to storytelling, there were often plots about "passing the exams and abandoning the wife who shared hardships." He'd never expected such a reversed version to happen to his childhood friend!

He suddenly thought of those puppet plays and booklets' inspirational stories, now unfolding before his eyes. But in the stories, the man was always ignorant and brutal, arrogant and self-important, bullying the weak and fearing the strong... Caiwang was just an ordinary farmer. Maybe not clever, not interesting, but he absolutely wasn't the "bad man" of puppet dramas.

"Don't be too upset..." He squeezed out a comforting phrase that even he found weak.

Caiwang shook his head. "It's okay. All in the past." He turned to look at Tan Shuangxi. "How's the military treating you? Heard you made quite a few achievements."

Tan Shuangxi smiled: "At least I'm still in one piece!"

Caiwang said: "People say casualties have been heavy at the front. Three salt field villages together, we've already had four killed. The village has had one killed too. And recently two badly wounded men came back—both crippled..."

"War means casualties." Tan Shuangxi was somewhat wistful. He didn't like talking about the battlefield. Though everyone wanted him to share war stories after returning, to not spoil the mood, he always picked interesting anecdotes and foreign sights to tell.

"Last recruitment, I was actually thinking of going. They said military pay was high, plus combat bonuses. I thought three years of soldiering could pay off the debts I've piled up these years." Caiwang said. "Then I thought again—if I died or got crippled, even with compensation, my dad and brother couldn't hold this family together..."

Tan Shuangxi didn't know what to say. He only said: "You thought it through." To lighten the heavy atmosphere, Tan Shuangxi started talking about military life, relating various amusing stories from the Northern Expedition. Caiwang listened with relish. Time slipped away in their conversation. The sun gradually rose higher. Hot sunlight bathed the land.

"Let me help with the work." Tan Shuangxi felt sitting and chatting was delaying Caiwang's tasks.

"Sure, you can help me." Caiwang didn't decline.

The two worked together repairing the channel. Tan Shuangxi soon broke a sweat. He simply stripped off his outer shirt, wearing just his short jacket. Long away from farm work, he was rusty at first. But as he worked, the memories deep in his body seemed to return. He got more and more skilled. Tan Shuangxi felt refreshed and much more comfortable.
