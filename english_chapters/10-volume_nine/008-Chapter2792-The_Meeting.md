# Chapter 2792: The Meeting

"Zishan, you're a rare guest here." Ma Qianzhu smiled, looking up from the document before him.

No sooner had he spoken than an attractive female secretary brought in tea.

Originally, Secretary of State Ma had never employed female staff in his immediate circle—only naturalized male citizens. But starting two years ago, the number of women around him had increased, which inevitably sparked discussion among many Senators. Some said he was "blending in with the mundane world"—a diplomatic way of saying he was compromising his principles—while others claimed he was trying to avoid accusations of gender discrimination. Either way, those "Big Secretaries" in dark cotton tunics with collars buttoned up to their chins had vanished.

Xiao Zishan bowed with a smile plastered across his face and offered his thanks. He picked up the tea cup and made a show of inhaling its fragrance. "Excellent tea." Once the secretary had withdrawn, he continued:

"Secretary of State Ma, about the welcome ceremony plan that was forwarded a few days ago..."

"I've already approved it. Nothing special needed—just spend a bit more money and make the ceremony grander. The army fought for two years; we must give our soldiers the honor they deserve."

"In the welcome ceremony plan, there's still one presiding leader position undetermined. Our preparatory group discussed it and decided we should invite one of the Big Leaders to demonstrate the event's importance." By "Big Leaders," Xiao Zishan meant the Chairman of the Senate, the Speaker, the Secretary of State, and the twelve main Senators who oversaw specific governmental affairs. Though Xiao Zishan technically belonged to their ranks, he never placed himself in that category on formal occasions.

Ma Qianzhu understood perfectly well what he was implying—he wanted Ma to bask in the limelight. Ma had long grown accustomed to such occasions; they held no special appeal. If not for the need to maintain a certain "exposure rate," he would rather not squander precious time on ceremonial functions.

"Invite Chairman Wang to preside over this. He sounded the horn for the expedition, so it's only fitting that he welcome the triumphant return. The first act of our mainland strategy will thus draw to a close."

Ma Qianzhu spoke with considerable emotion.

Xiao Zishan deliberately assumed an expression of difficulty. "Chairman Wang has no free time at the moment. He agreed to Senator Lin—that is, Lin Hanlong's request—and went with him to Gaoshan Ridge to conduct optical experiments. He's not expected back for another week."

"Lin Hanlong? Optical experiments?" Ma Qianzhu couldn't immediately connect the two, and countless questions arose in his mind.

"Chairman Wang specialized in optics. Though he didn't end up working in his field, he received professional training nonetheless. Senator Lin posted a request for help on the BBS regarding the two-meter rangefinder, and Chairman Wang happened to see it. I don't think a welcome ceremony warrants interrupting scientific research. It would suffice to have a *main* leader attend." Xiao Zishan hastened to explain, biting down particularly hard on the word "main." This carefully crafted rhetoric needed to sound reasonable while simultaneously highlighting a certain someone's importance—it had taken him half a day to formulate.

The effort proved effective. Ma Qianzhu immediately acknowledged Chairman Wang's identity as a scientific and technological worker and spoke in his characteristically amiable tone. "Then I'll make the trip on Chairman Wang's behalf."

Xiao Zishan couldn't help but feel a surge of pride. "I'll handle things accordingly, then. I'll send you the detailed itinerary later."

With the major matter decided, Xiao Zishan took a few more sips of tea, chatted about some irrelevancies, and prepared to stand up, pat his backside, and leave.

That's when Ma Qianzhu tossed out another topic. "Have you read the latest issue of *Morning Star*?"

Xiao Zishan had, of course, read it. Every issue of *Morning Star* was sent to the General Office as a proof copy before printing. Apart from Editor-in-Chief Ding Ding, he was always the first to see it.

"Yes, I have. You mean Great Ming's recent intention to negotiate peace?"

"Correct. What do you think?"

"I largely agree with Comrade Jiang Shan's view. Great Ming wants peace, but we'll still need to fight another battle first." Xiao Zishan paused. "If that succeeds, it will be more advantageous for us."

"Securing a period of peace would be ideal." Ma Qianzhu frowned deeply, but said nothing more.

The next day, major matters were discussed and decided at the regular State Council meeting of the Central Government Administration Council. As the meeting drew to a close, Ma Qianzhu raised the matter of peace talks once again.

"...Everyone is presumably aware that the Ming State may very likely seek to negotiate peace with us soon." Seeing a stir among the Senators, he raised his hand to forestall discussion. "Though it appears both sides are inclined toward talks, the war is not yet over. Whether on the Guangdong-Guangxi front or in the rear, sporadic battle reports arrive daily. Every day brings news of cadres and soldiers killed in action.

"From a strategic standpoint, we achieved a complete victory. However, as the sages said, 'Victory always has a price'—and the price we paid was enormous. Two years of war have left negative impacts that are now becoming apparent. Setting aside the fiscal deficit, numerous problems have begun to surface at the level of social governance alone. The General Staff Political Department and the Political Security Bureau's Social Conditions Division have prepared detailed reports. Among both troops and civilians, there are signs of war-weariness and discontent. Discipline issues have also emerged among frontline units. Though these remain isolated cases for now, such sentiments will likely spread if left unchecked over time. Everyone must pay attention and work to address this."

"Frontline units have recently begun returning to their stations successively for rest, reorganization, and replenishment. Naturally, they will receive all the honors and rewards they deserve. But the stark contrast between frontline and rear, the trauma of watching comrades fall, the pain left by the battlefield... these things may well stir up strong emotions among our officers and soldiers. I ask that everyone remain vigilant."

"We've discussed this with the General Staff," Ran Yao said. "Comrade Dongmen is preparing to propose to the General Office that the Lingao Garrison Battalion also wear Military Police armbands. If that's insufficient, we'll mobilize part of Hainan's local National Army troops to ensure main stations and their surroundings are adequately staffed with Military Police. Our police system has also drawn up plans."

Ma Qianzhu nodded. "Discipline inspection is one aspect. The key lies in providing proper psychological counseling and implementing preferential treatment policies. Soldiers must feel respected and needed—that is what matters most."

"Our civil affairs system has issued specific documents and formulated plans. However, preferential treatment and compensation involve quite a few different areas. It would be best to have a coordinating agency to handle everything together."

...

Once serious matters had been discussed and everyone began to chat idly, Xiao Zishan proposed a batch of ceremonial tasks, including the "Welcome Ceremony Host" position, hoping to get quick decisions so everyone could head to lunch. The canteen had already delivered working meals to each Senator's office. After all, unless there were urgent matters that simply had to be discussed over food, everyone preferred to preserve some private space.

Ma Qianzhu shed his earlier seriousness and took up the conversation cheerfully. "These are all matters requiring someone to show face. I say we divide them up together rather than going through them one by one."

With that, he picked up a stack of meeting materials and flipped through them, reading out the names of all the meetings. He held up the documents to show everyone their thickness, his manner relaxed. "Quite a lot. We have many taxes these days, and just as many meetings."

"Actually, our taxes aren't many—they're few. Great Ming's are too few..." Cheng Dong started to say more.

"We'll discuss that problem later." Ma Qianzhu quickly cut him off.

"...The Dutch Trade Delegation—does this sort of meeting really need to be brought before the council? Si Kaide, you and the commercial sector can receive them. For the Dutch, that's respectable enough. This isn't a state visit. If some Prince William shows up, then it won't be too late to invite Chairman Wang."

"Secretary of State Ma, I must point out that these visitors are not representatives of the Dutch East India Company—" Si Kaide raised an objection. "The visiting delegation consists of important bankers and major merchants from the Seven Provinces. While some among them are undoubtedly VOC shareholders, they are not the same thing. It would be better to have Comrade He Ying attend."

*I'm offering you the limelight and you still don't want it!* Ma Qianzhu criticized silently, but he smiled and nodded toward He Ying nonetheless.

He Ying, this "Minister," was the most idle among the Ministers, spending most of his time in a part-time capacity with the commercial trade department. Hearing there was an opportunity to make an appearance, he immediately volunteered. "I can go."

"...The Fourth Advanced Police Training Class Graduation and Rank Conferment Ceremony—can't Ran Yao preside over this himself? I understand that the Navy and Army previously invited the Executive Committee to attend their rank conferment ceremonies, so this is meant to balance things out. My opinion is that, going forward, similar promotion and advancement ceremonies across various departments should be conducted within their own headquarters, not elevated to the Government Administration Council level."

These words met with unanimous approval among the attending Senators. Apart from Wen, Wang, and Ma, as well as Senators serving in the Fubo Army, almost no one had ever presided over ceremonies for awarding honors or conferring ranks. Most harbored at least a touch of envy or resentment. Now that such ceremonies would all be cancelled at this level, it seemed fair. As for holding rank or commendation ceremonies within headquarters to satisfy the itch for leadership recognition—that became an internal affair requiring no report to the Government Administration Council.

"...The Manya Steel Plant New Process Silicon Steel Technology Demonstration Meeting. I know a bit about this. Silicon steel is currently a serious bottleneck on our tech tree. The mass-produced silicon steel sheets we're making now wouldn't even qualify as scrap in the old... Australia. It's choking the development of all electrical equipment—even the electronics industry. Relays, for instance..."

Ma Qianzhu seemed to have been struck on the back of the head by silicon steel, as he launched into technical details for a full five minutes before catching himself. "Apologies for going off-topic. I learned all this while attending the Punch Card Machine Technology Demonstration Meeting some time ago." He lowered his head and flipped through several pages of documents. "This is very important. I think I should attend personally..."

Xiao Zishan grew anxious and quickly reminded him in a low voice, "There's a scheduling conflict."

Ma Qianzhu seemed to only then remember. "Oh, right. No matter. The demonstration meeting runs for three days—I'll just attend on the last day." He made a few quick notes in his notebook. "There's also the Danzhou Industrial Park Planning Scheme Technology Demonstration Meeting. That one's a bit complex. Director Zhan, why don't you explain..."
